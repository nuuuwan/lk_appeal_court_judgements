"The  defence  suggested 
that  the  police  officers  went  in  search  of  a"
"person  by  the name  Wije and  took the accused  into custody as  Wije who"
"is 
the  husband  of  the  accused  was  away.  As  a  matter  of  fact, 
if the"
"information 
regarding 
trafficking  of  heroin  at  a 
informant  had  given"
"grand  scale, 
the  police  would  have  undoubtedly  questioned  him  as 
to"
"the  names  of the  persons  involved.  It is  very  unlikely that a person  who"
"is  employed  as  an  informant  would  have  furnished  information  without"
"naming  the  person/s  really  involved  in  the  commission  of the  offence."
"The  reason  why  the  police  team  consisted  of  such  a  large  number  of"
"men,  although  explained 
to  be 
the  unpleasant  experience 
the  Police"
"had  in the past  having  to face  the opposition  from  the villages,  does  not"
"appear  to  be  credible.  The 
fact  that  the  police  team  consisting  of  a"
"for  the  raid  is 
large  number  of  men  and  3  vehicles  having  been  used"
"suggestive  of the  prior information  they  may  have  received  concerning"
"someone  involved  in  the  business  of heroin  at a  large-scale.  The  police"
"had  decided  to  make  use  of such  a team  keeping  in  mind  the  necessity"
"to resist any unforeseen opposition."
