"Initially,  it is  highly  improbable  to  have  left  out  Basnayaka  51  who  had"
"received  the information through  his  personal  informer from  taking part"
"at the  raid.  The  informant  had  only  pointed  out a particular house  in  a"
"row of houses  and  whether the  police officers  had  in  fact went into that"
"particular house  is  not confirmed  as  the informant had  immediately left"
"having  pointed  out the  house  and  before  the  police officers could  reach"
