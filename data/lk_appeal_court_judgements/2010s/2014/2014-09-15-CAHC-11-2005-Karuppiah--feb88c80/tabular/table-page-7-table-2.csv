"Judge, 
it  appears 
to  me  as 
it  lacks 
lucidity.  The  evidence  of  the  2"
"witnesses  for the  prosecution  has  not been  analyzed  in  the judgment in"
"the correct perspective to ascertain  their creditworthiness.  The  concept"
"of  proof  of  a  criminal  charge  beyond 
reasonable  doubt  has  not  been"
"properly  applied 
to 
the  evidence  unfolded  by 
the  prosecution 
in  a"
"critical  approach.  The 
learned  High  Court  judge  has 
failed 
to  discuss"
"adequately  and  apply  the  concept  of reasonable  doubt  to  the  evidence"
"adduced  at the trial."
