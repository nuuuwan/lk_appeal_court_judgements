"Appellant  did  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the  transporting  of  timber"
"without  a  permit.

"The  learned  High  Court Judge  has  affirmed  the  learned  Magistrate's"
"Order  and  dismissed  the  Revision  Application  on  the  basis  that there  were"
"no exceptional circumstances adduced before him."
"The  revisionary  power of Court  is  a  discretionary  power.  This  is  an"
"extraordinary jurisdiction  which  is  exercised  by  the  Court  and  the  grant  of"
"relief 
is  entirely dependent on the discretion of the Court. The grant of such"
"relief is of course a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and  always"
"be  dependent on  the circumstances  of each  case.  Existence  of exceptional"
"circumstances  is  the  process  by  which  the  Court  should  select  the  cases  in"
"respect  of which  the  extraordinary  power  of  revision  should  be  adopted."
"The  exceptional  circumstances  would  vary 
from  case 
to  case  and 
their"
"degree  of exceptionality  must  be  correctly  assessed  and  gauged  by  Court"
"taking  into  consideration  all  antecedent  circumstances  using  the  yardstick"
"whether  a  failure  of  justice  would  occur  unless 
revisionary  powers  are"
"invoked."
"In  all  the above circumstances,  I take the view that the learned  High"
"Court Judge  has  not exercised  his  revisionary jurisdiction justifiably over the"
"determination made by the learned Magistrate."
