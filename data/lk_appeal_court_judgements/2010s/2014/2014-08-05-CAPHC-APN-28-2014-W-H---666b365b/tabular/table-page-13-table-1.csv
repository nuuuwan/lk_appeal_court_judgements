"deprived of his liberty in an unusual manner."
"This  clearly  shows  that  the  Court  was  without  authority  to"

"enforced by the learned Magistrate in his endeavour to recover"
"the  money  from  the  suspect.  Needless  to  say  that  such  a"
"method to compel payment is unknown to our law."
