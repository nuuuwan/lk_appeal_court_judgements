"obstructions  in  the  way  of restoration  of the  right  to  the"
"person entitled thereto in terms  of the determination made"
"by  the  Court, 
there  is  no  suchÂ· prohibition,  against  the"
"Court exercising such a  power or making such an order .."
"As  was  held 
in  Narasingh  v.  Mangal  Dubey  -
(1883)  5"
"Allahabad  163,  the  Courts  are  not  to  act  on  the  principle"
"that every procedure  is  to  be  taken as prohibited unless it"
"is  expressly provided for  by law.  What in fact  matters here"
"is the converse that every procedure is to be understood as"
"permissible till  it is  shown to  be prohibited.  As  such,  I  can"
"see  no  reason  as  to  how  the  order  of demolition  made  by"
"It 
the  learned  magistrate  can  be  faulted  as  being  illegal."
