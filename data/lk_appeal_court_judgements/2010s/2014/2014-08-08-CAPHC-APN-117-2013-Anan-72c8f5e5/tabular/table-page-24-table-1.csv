"the  fate  of the  petition  could  not  have  been  different  from"
"how it culminated in the High Court."
"Hence,  the  Magistrate  and  the  Learned  High  Court Judge"
"are  amply  justified _ in  their  respective  conclusions  which"
"effectively had prevented the petitioner from  taking the law"
"into his own  hands. The  decision allowing the respondents"
"to  continue  to  enjoy  the  disputed  right  in  the  nature  of a"
"servitude  for  the  time  being,  is  the  only  order  that  could"
"have been lawfully made by the Magistrate."
"Revision  application is therefore  dismissed  subject to  costs"
