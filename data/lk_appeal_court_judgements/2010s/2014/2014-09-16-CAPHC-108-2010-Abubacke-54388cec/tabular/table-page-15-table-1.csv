"an order of confiscation of the vehicle,  then however much the owner"
"comes forward  and says that he  gave  instructions not to  make use of"
"the vehicle for illegal purposes,  by reason of the fact that he is on the"
"monthly  payment  the  vehicle  has  to  be  confiscated.  This  approach"
"does not appear to be reasonable and acceptable in law.  In an inquiry"
"of this  nature,  all what 
the owner has to  prove  is that he  took every"
"measure to ensure that the vehicle is not used for illegal purposes."
