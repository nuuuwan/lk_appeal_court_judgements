"As 
the  affidavit  has  been  attested  outside  Sri  Lanka"
"probably,  it may have been attested according to  the law"
"applicable  in  that  country.  We  were  not  provided  with"
"any  assistance  on  that  matter. 
However, 
in  terms  of"
"section  9  of  the  oaths  and  affirmations  ordinance,  the"
"irregularities pointed out by the 2nd  respondent are not of"
"serious nature that warrant the rejection  of the affidavit."
"In 
the 
circumstances, 
the 
objection 
raised 
against"
"entertaining  the  affidavit  being  too  technical,  merits  no"
"serious 
consideration."
