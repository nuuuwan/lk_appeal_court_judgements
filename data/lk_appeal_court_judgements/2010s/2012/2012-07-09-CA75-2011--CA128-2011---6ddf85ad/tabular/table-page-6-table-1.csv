"For 
the  purpose  of  above 
section 
a  youth 
candidate 
contesting  a local"
"authority  election 
for  the  year 2011  should  have 
reached 
the  age  of  18,  as"
"at  1/06/2009."
"On  a  careful 
reading  of  the  above  provisions 
in  section  28 (4) A  of  the  Law"
"it 
is 
imperative  to 
strictly 
comply  with 
the 
requirement  of 
furnishing 
a"
"the  Registrar  of  Birth or  an 
certified  Copy  of the  birth  certificate  issued  by"
"affidavit  and 
failure 
to 
observe 
the 
above 
requirement in  proof  of  age  of"
"the  youth 
candidate  as 
required  by  section  28  (4)  (A) 
will 
result 
in 
the"
"nomination  paper  being  rejected  by  the  returning  officer."
"It 
is 
to  be 
noted 
that 
the 
requirement  of  a  40%  of 
the 
total  number"
"should  be 
youth candidates  was  brought 
in  by 
the 
candidates  nominated"
"Local  Authorities  Election  Ordinance 
(amendment)  Act  no  25  of  1990."
"Section  28(1) A  of  the  Act

follows:"
"to 
II Notwithstanding  any 
provisions  in 
this 
Act 
the 
contrary, 
in 
each"
"nomination  paper  submitted  in  respect  of an  election  for  the  electoral  areas"
"of  a 
local  authority,  not 
less 
than forty  per centum of  the 
total  number  of"
"candidates  nominated  in  each  nomination  paper  shall  consist of youth"""
"And  as  such 
the 
issue 
to  be  determined  by 
this  court  is  as 
to  whether  the"
"true  copy  of  a  birth 
certificate 
certified 
by  a 
justice  of 
the  peace  and"
"attached 
to 
the 
nomination 
paper  by  a  youth 
candidate  is 
sufficient 
to"
"satisfy  the  requirement 
in  section  28 (4)  (A)  of  the  Law."
"Mr.  A.P  Niles 
who  appeared 
for 
the  3rd

"IICertified 
Copy"" 
in 
relation 
to 
a  birth

therefore 
this

Registration 
Act 
which 
provides 
for
