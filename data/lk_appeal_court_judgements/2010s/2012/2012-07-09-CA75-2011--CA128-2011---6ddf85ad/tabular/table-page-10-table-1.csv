"Deputy  Solicitor  General 
raised 
objections 
that 
the  petitioner 
is  guilty of"
"laches  and 
that 
the  necessary  parties  have  not  been  made 
respondents.  I"
"did  not  consider 
the 
two  objections 
raised  by 
the 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"in  view of the  conclusion  arrived 
that  the  petitioner  cannot succeed 
General"

is  dismissed  without  costs""."
