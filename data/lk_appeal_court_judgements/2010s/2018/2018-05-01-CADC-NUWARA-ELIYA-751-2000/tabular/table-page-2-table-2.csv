"but up to now neither the Plaintiff~Respondent nor any Attorney~at~Law on its behalf"
"has  appeared.  According to the Journal Entries, it appears that several attempts were"
"made to serve notices  on the  Plaintiff~Respondent but to no  avail.  Finally the matter"
"was  fixed  for  argument.  The  Defendant's  Counsel  Mr.  Lakshman  Amarasinghe  has,"
"after  his  oral  submissions,  filed  written  submissions  and  taken  up  the  following"
"grounds  upon which he  has  stated that the  Plaintiff had failed  to follow  the correct"
"procedure specified in the Civil  Procedure  Code  and therefore the Plaintiff could not"
"have  and  maintain  this action.  The grounds urged by the  Defendant  are  enumerated"
"below."
