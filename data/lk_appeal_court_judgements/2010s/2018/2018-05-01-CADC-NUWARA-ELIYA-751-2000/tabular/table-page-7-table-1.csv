"created a leeway in that what is justly due can be gleaned from the affidavit filed and as"
"I pointed out one cannot ascertain what amount is justly due in view of the discrepancy"
"in the affidavit. I take the view that on this ground of uncertainty alone, the plaint must"

"The  3rd  point  is 
that  the  Plaintiff  has  failed 
to  give  the  Defendant  notice  of"
"dishonour of the cheques."
"It is ingrained in the law of negotiable instruments that when a cheque is dishonoured,"
"the holder must give  notice  of dishonor  to  the drawer and indorsers  to  render them"
"liable. In the instant case the Plaintiff sued the Defendant on four cheques and all these"
"four  cheques had been  dishonoured,  but the  Plaintiff gave  notice of dishonor only in"
"respect of a cheque for Rs.l08,333/ ~ bearing No.  280588 and dated 28.06.l996 and failed"
"to give notice of dishonor in respect of the other cheques."
"Notice of dishonor must be distinguished from a ""Letter of Demand"". It is necessary to"
"make a demand by way of a ""Letter of Demand"" but it is equally necessary to give notice"

"Section 48 of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance stipulates the requirement for a notice of"
"dishonor. This provision contains not only the requirement of a notice of dishonour but"
"also the effect of not giving such notice. Section 48 goes as follows:"
"""Subject 
to 
the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  when 
the  bill  has  been  dishonoured  by  non~"
"acceptance  or  by  non~payment, notice  of dishonour  must  be given  to  the  drawer  and  each"
"indorser, and any drawer or indorser to whom such notice is not given is discharged."""
"So 
it  is  clear  that  if  a  holder  of  a  cheque  who  finds 
that  the  cheque  has  been"
"dishonoured gets an immediate right of recourse against the drawer of the cheque and"
