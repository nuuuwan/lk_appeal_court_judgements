"this  Court  in  response  to  the  said  notices  and 
the  matter  had  been 
fixed 
for"
"argument in the absence of the 1st  and  2nd  Respondents."
"When 
this  matter  was 
taken  up  for  argument  on  30th  July  2018, 
the 
learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the"
"-
3rd 
6th  Respondents informed Court that written submissions have already been"
"tendered  and  moved 
that 
this  Court  deliver 
judgment  on 
the  said  written"
"submissions."
"The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows."
"By  a  letter  dated  4th  April  2003,  the  Petitioner  company  had  appointed  the  1st"
"Respondent as  an  'Office Assistant'  in  the 1st  Petitioner company with effect from"
"1st  February  2003.  The  said  letter of appointment,  which  had  been  produced  at"
"the  inquiry  held  before  the  2nd  Respondent,  marked  'R1',  sets  out  in  brief the"
"terms  and  conditions  of employment  of the  1st  Respondent.  It  is  not in  dispute"
"that  although 
the  1st  Respondent  was  employed 
in 
the  position  of  ""Office"
"Assistant"",  in  reality  the  1st  Respondent  functioned  as  the  Chairman's  cook  and"
"carried  out  his  duties  and  functions  from  the  Chairman's  residence.  In  fact,  the"
"letter of appointment stipulated  that the  1st  Respondent  was  required  to  report"
"directly to the Chairman of the Petitioner company as  opposed to the office of the"
"Petitioner.  The  evidence 
led  at  the 
inquiry  before  the  2nd  Respondent  clearly"
"demonstrates that the 1st  Respondent did not have any interaction with the office"
"staff of the Petitioner with regard to his day to day functions."
