"In  June  2007, 
there  was  a  change 
in 
the  post  of  Chairman  of  the  Petitioner"
"company,  with 
the 
then  Chairman 
resigning 
from 
the  Petitioner  company. 
It"
"appears  from  the  evidence  led  at  the  inquiry  that  the  1st  Respondent  was  not"
"aware  of this  change  of  circumstances  and  that  he  continued  to  work  for  the"
"former Chairman  at his  residence.  The  Petitioner did  not remit the salary of the"
"1st  Respondent 
for  the  month  of  July  2007 
to  the  bank  account  of  the  1st"
"Respondent,  as  was the  practice,  in  view of the change of circumstances  referred"
"to above.  As  his  salary  had  not been  remitted,  the  1st  Respondent claims  that he"
"called  over at the  office  of the  Petitioner company  in  late July  and  early  August"
"2007 only to be told that he would not be  paid  his salary and for him to tender his"
"resignation, which the 1st  Respondent claims he refused to do."
"The  first  written  communication  sent by the  Petitioner was  the  letter dated  15th"
"October 20071
,  by which the Petitioner informed the 1st  Respondent as follows:"
"""You  have  not reported for work on your own accord since  1st July 2007. You"
"are therefore deemed to have vacated your post. II"
"Although  the  1st  Respondent  had  complained  to  the  Department  of  Labour  in"
"October  2007,  neither  party  has  submitted  any  material 
to  demonstrate 
the"
"nature  of the  complaint.  However,  it appears  from  the  reference  to arbitration,"
"annexed 
to 
the  petition  marked 
that  a  dispute  had  been 
referred 
for 
'Pl'"
"arbitration on  29th  August 2008 but had subsequently been cancelled."
"1 This letter has  been  produced at the Inquiry, marked 'R2'."
