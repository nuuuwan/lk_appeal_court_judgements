"5"
"Implement the decision in the document produced  marked  P 5 and to"
"remove the unlawful construction  referred to therein."
"The Petitioner has initially complained to the Colombo  Municipal  Council"
"that the 6th  Respondent has unlawfully constructed a bathroom and a toilet"
"close to the Petitioner's kitchen.  She  had  expected the  1st to 4th"
"respondents to take action  to demolish the said construction. The failure on"
"the part of the said  respondents to take action to demolish the said"
"unauthorized  structure constructed  by the  6th  Respondent has prompted"
"the Petitioner to file the instant application  praying from  this Court, a writ"
"of Mandamus to compel the said  respondents to take such  steps."
"The 2nd
,  3rd  and  4th  Respondents  have brought to the  notice of this Court"
"that it is not only the 6th  Respondent's structure that is unauthorized but"
"that the Petitioner's dwelling  place also  has been  built without any permit"
"from  any relevant authority. It is on  that footing that the learned counsel"
"for the 2nd
,  3rd  and  4th  Respondents  has argued that the Petitioner should"
"be  precluded  from  maintaining this application on  the 'clean  hands"
"doctrine'."
