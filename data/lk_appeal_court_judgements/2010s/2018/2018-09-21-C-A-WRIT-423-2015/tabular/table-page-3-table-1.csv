"T
he Quit Notice has been issued on the basis that the said land"
"belongs 
to 
the  State  Plantation  Corporation,  whereas 
the"
"petitioner states that it belongs to the Land Reform Commission-"
"the  5th  respondent  to  this  application.    It  is  on  that  premise,"
"learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits  that  the  issuance  of"
"Quit Notice is fundamentally flawed."
"The  sole  document  relied  on  by  the  petitioner  to  say  that  the"
"land belongs to the Land Reform Commission is the letter issued"
"by the Land Reform Commission marked P7."
"However,  that  letter  refers  to  a  land  known  as  Bagawantalawa"
"Estate, and not Kotiyagala Estate, which is the land relevant to"
"the  Quit  Notice. 
  Therefore, 
that 
letter  cannot  be  of  any"
"assistance 
to 
the  petitioner. 
  Hence 
the  application  of 
the"
"petitioner is liable to be dismissed."
"Even 
though 
it 
is  not  necessary, 
let  me  now  consider 
the"
"position 
taken 
up 
by 
the 
Land  Reform  Commission 
in"
"supporting the application of the petitioner."
"The  Land  Reform  Commission 
in 
its  purported  statement  of"
"objections  states 
that  an  extent  of  1518  and  Â½  acres  of"
"Kotiyagala  Estate  was  vested  in  the  Land  Reform  Commission"
"under 
the  Land  Reform  Law,  No.1  of  1972;  and  by 
the"
"Extraordinary Gazette No.150/12 dated 24.07.1981, out of that"
"land,  an  extent  of  1081  acres  2  roods  and  1  perch  has  been,"
"arbitrarily  and  illegally,  vested  (by  the  subject  minister)  in  the"
"State  Plantation  Corporation;  and  the  balance  portion  of  147"
"acres 
is  still  owned  by 
the  Land  Reform  Commission;  and"
"therefore  the  State  Plantation  Corporation  has  no  right  to  evict"
"the petitioner from the balance portion."
