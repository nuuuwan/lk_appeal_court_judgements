"A
  close  perusal  of  the  said  Gazette  marked  1R1  reveals  that,"
"what has been vested in the State Plantation Corporation is not"
"an  extent  of  1081  acres  2  roods  and  1  perch,  but  an  extent  of"
"1754 acres 2 roods and 12 perches (that is, 1081 acres 2 roods"
"and  1  perch  from  Kotiyagala  Estate,  and  673  acres  and  11"
"perches 
from  Chapelton  Estate,  which 
is  part  of  Kotiyagala"
"Estate).    In  addition,  an  extent  of  543  acres  1  rood  and  39"
"perches from Bogawantalawa Estate (the land referred to in P7)"
"has also been vested in the State Plantation Corporation. Then it"
"is clear that nothing is left with the Land Reform Commission in"
"Kotiyagala 
Estate, 
after 
vesting 
in 
the 
State 
Plantation"
"Corporation."
"The alleged illegality of the said vesting order  (1R1) in favour of"
"the State Plantation Corporation is not being challenged in these"
"proceedings."
"There is no merit in this application."
"In view of the above finding of fact, there is no necessity for this"
"Court to consider in detail, the grounds upon which Quit Notice"
"can  be  challenged  in  law,  the  point  stressed  by  learned  Senior"
"Deputy Solicitor General at the argument."
"Application is dismissed without costs."
"The  parties 
in 
the  connected  writ  applications:  424/2015,"
"425/2015 and 426/2015 will abide by this Judgment."
