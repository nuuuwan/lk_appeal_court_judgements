"When  he  raised  cries  witness  Sumanasena  rushed  in  and  the  two"
"Appellants ran away from the scene. The deceased was thereafter taken to"
"hospital  and  on  his  way  had  made  a  declaration 
implicating  the 
two"
"Appellants  as 
the  persons  who 
stabbed  him.  The  medical  evidence"
"revealed  that  the  deceased  had  suffered  three  stab  wounds  on  his  chest"
"and  one  stab  on  his  abdomen.  The  corresponding  internal  injury  to  the"
"penetrating stab injury on the abdomen was on the aorta and it had been"
"cut about 2/3. This injury had resulted in the death of the deceased which"
"in turn caused loss of blood. He could have talked for a while."
