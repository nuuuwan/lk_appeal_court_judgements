"P.  Padman Surasena, lCP/CA)"
"On  the  last occasion  on  08.03.2018,  this court heard  the submissions of"
"the  learned  counsel 
for  the  petitioner.  The  court  was  not  inclined  to"
"issue  notice  on 
the 
respondents  on 
that  occasion. 
However,  court"
"learned  counsel 
for  the  petitioner  to  give  notice  of  this 
directed 
the"
"application  to the  respondents  and  then  support it further and  the case"
"was 
fixed 
for  further  support  for  today. 
The 
learned  State  Counsel"
"today informs court that the  prayer ""C"" of the  petition  has already been"
"granted 
to 
the  petitioner. 
(i.e. 
the  petitioner  has  been  granted 
the"
"exclusive  privilege  of  selling 
toddy  by 
retail 
in 
the 
relevant 
toddy"
"tavern). 
This  court  observes 
that 
it 
is 
the  main  prayer  of 
this"
"application  and  the  main  purpose  as  to why the  petitioner  has  filed  this"
"application  before  this  court.  Since  the  main  prayer  has  been  granted,"
"there  is  no  further  relief that  is  available  for  this  court to  award  to  the"
"petitioner.  Therefore,  there  is  no  basis  to  permit this  application  to  be"
"further pending  in  this court."
"Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
petitioner 
concedes 
that  petitioner 
has"
"deposited  the  money  as  directed  by  the  respondent  for  the  purpose  of"
"obtaining  this  privilege.  However,  he  states  that  he  was  not permitted"
"to sign the contract in  terms of section  11."
