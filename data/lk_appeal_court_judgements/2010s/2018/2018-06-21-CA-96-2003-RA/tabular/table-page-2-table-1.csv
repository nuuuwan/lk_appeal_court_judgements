"When  this  matter  came  up  for  argument  for  the  first  time  before"
"me on 06.06.2018, counsel for the parties invited me to deliver the"
"Judgment on the written submissions already filed of record."

"Juwanis  Fernando  devolved  according  to  the  pedigree  of  the  3rd,"
"6th, 24th and 28th defendants."

"has  directed  the  plaintiff  to  tender  the  List  of  Shares  prepared  in"
"terms of the Judgment, and has further noted that the said List of"
"Shares shall be treated as a part of the Judgment."

"have 
tendered  different  Lists  of  Shares  purportedly  made 
in"
"accordance  with 
the  Judgment,  and  as 
there  had  been  no"
"consensus as to allocation of shares, the succeeding District Judge"
"has made the order dated 18.06.2002.  It is against this order the"
"24th  and  28th  defendants  have 
filed 
this 
revision  application"
"whatever they have prayed for in the prayer to the petition."
