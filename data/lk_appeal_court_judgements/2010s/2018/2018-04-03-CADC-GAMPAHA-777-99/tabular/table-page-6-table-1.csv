"The  learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that there was  no need to make the owners of"
"the  servient tenements  in  this  case  a  party to  the  action  as  those  owners  did  not obstruct the"
"right of way of the Plaintiff.  I am  unable to accede to this argument. The survey plans presented"
"in evidence indicate that the right of way claimed  by the  Plaintiff traverses  at  least two portions"
"of land  owned by other parties who are  not parties to this action. The  appeal  brief contains two"
"applications  made  by  way  of  petition  and  affidavit,  one  jointly  by  Mary  Jayakody  and  V.A."
"Nishantha  Perera  and the other by Margaret Perera, to have them added as  parties to the action"
"(Appeal  brief  pages  310-322).  The  basis  of these  applications  appears  to  be  that  they  are  the"
"owners of the land situated to the western  boundary of the right of way claimed by the Plaintiff"
"and that a major portion of the said right of way goes over the land belonging to them. The record"
"shows  that the  Plaintiff objected to them  being  added  as  parties  and  therefore the  application"
