"land  more fully  described  in  the  3rd  schedule  to  the  plaint which  is  owned  by  the  Defendants."
"However, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants had  obstructed this right of way."
"Accordingly,  the  Plaintiff prayed,  inter alia,  for a declaration that he  is  entitled to a widening of"
"the said  right of way to a 12 foot wide  right of way due to prescription or necessity,  prohibiting"
"the  Defendants from  obstructing this  right of way  and  damages  of Rs.  100/= per day  until  he  is"
"allowed to use the said  right of way."
"The  Defendants  denied  the  claim  of the  Plaintiff  and  submitted  that  there  was  another  road"
"access to the Plaintiff's land which is  more fully described in the 3rd  schedule to the answer. They"
"further  stated  that the  Plaintiff had  failed  to  make  all  the  owners  of the  lands  over  which  the"
"Plaintiff claimed a right of way parties to the action. The  Defendants prayed for a dismissal of the"
"Plaintiff's action, a permanent injunction restraining the Plaintiff from using any other access way"
"over the  lands of the Defendants other than the access  road  depicted  in  the 3rd  schedule to the"
"answer.  The  learned  Additional  District Judge  of Gampaha  dismissed  the  action  of the  Plaintiff"
"and  granted the  permanent injunction  prayed for by  the  Defendants.  Hence  this  appeal  by  the"
"Plaintiff."
"By the time this matter was argued the Plaintiff was dead and the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellants"
"(Appellants) were substituted."
"One  matter that arose for consideration  is  whether the  Plaintiff had  made all  the owners  of the"
"servient tenements  parties to the action.  In  answering issue  no.  27  in  the negative and  issue  no."
"28  in  the  affirmative, the  learned  Additional  District Judge  concluded  that the  Plaintiff's action"
"must  be  dismissed  due  to the  failure  on  the  part  of the  Plaintiff to  make  all  the  owners of the"
"servient tenements parties to the action. The  learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that"
"this  is  an  erroneous conclusion  as  there is  no  need to include as  parties'  owners of the servient"
"tenements who did  not obstruct or dispute the right of way of the Plaintiff."
