"medical issues."
"The learned counsel for the respondent states that the learned High Court judge had"
"carefully considered each of these exceptional grounds before arriving at the"
"decision."
"The exceptional circumstances raised by the petitioner in this Court of Appeal"
"that was not raised in the High Court of Kandy. Hence the learned High"
"Court Judge could not have considered matters not urged before the court."
"The petitioners cited regulations under prisons ordinance with regard to the"
"duration of thc.sent\!nce and also stated the delay to hear an appeal as grounds in"
"the oral arguments. When considering the enlargement of a person' bail pending"
"appeal the respondent wishes to submit to court that a court should take the"
"maximum precautions to ensure that the convict concerned would be within the"
"grasp of the law to serve the sentence ifhis appeal is dismissed."
"Thus a court considering the issue of bail pending appeal must always look to"
"granting bail on exceptional circumstances established to the satisfaction of that"
"court."
