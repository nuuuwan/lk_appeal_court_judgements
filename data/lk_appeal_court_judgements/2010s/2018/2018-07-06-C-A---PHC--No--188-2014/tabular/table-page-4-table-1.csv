"The primary complaint of the Appellant is that she has been transferred in violation of section 11"
"of the  Minutes  of the  Sri  Lanka  Librarian  Service  (P2).  She  contends  that  in  terms  of P2,  her"
"transfer was  restricted to a school  to which  a Grade  I Librarian  appointment could  be  made as"
"she  was  serving as  Grade  I Librarian  at St.  Anne's  College  Kurunegala  prior to her transfer. The"
"2nd  and 3rd  Respondents contend that P2  is not applicable to the Appellant which I am  persuaded"
"to  accept  as  the  correct  position.  The  Gazette  marked  P2 
is  applicable  to Sri  Lanka  Librarian"
"Service and covers the officers in the Central Government whereas the Appellant is not an officer"
"of the Central Government. She  was  absorbed  into the provincial service  by P3  in  1991 and the"
"said letter of appointment states, at paragraph 4, that she can  be transferred to any place within"
"the North-Western Province."
"Even 
if  it  is  assumed  that  the  Appellant's  contention  is  correct,  the  Appellant  has  failed  to"
"produce any document to show a classification of libraries. Instead she has produced P9 which is"
"a classification of schools and not libraries. Hence assuming that P2  is applicable to the Appellant,"
"the provision  relied  on  by the Appellant cannot be  applied  in  the absence  of a classification  of"
"libraries  which  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  produce  to  substantiate  her  claim.  This  was  the"
"conclusion that the learned High Court Judge arrived at on this issue and I am  in agreement with"
"these findings."
"The Appellant further contends that the transfer is  arbitrary and  irrational. The  reasons for the"
"transfer according to the  2nd  and  3rd  Respondents-Respondents  (3 rd  Respondent)  is  exigency of"
"service  and  to  establish  that  they  have  produced  a  letter  dated  28.12.2011  (2V4)  from  the"
"Principal of Pothuhera Junior School,  Kurunegala addressed to the 3rd  Respondent requesting for"
"a librarian for the library in the school  built as  a world bank project. The  Appellant submits that"
"this  is  well  after the  date  on  which  the Appellant  was  relieved  of her  duties  as  librarian  at St."
"Anne's  College  and  that there  is  also  no  documentation to show the  date  on  which  the world"
"bank project was competed and the library opened."
