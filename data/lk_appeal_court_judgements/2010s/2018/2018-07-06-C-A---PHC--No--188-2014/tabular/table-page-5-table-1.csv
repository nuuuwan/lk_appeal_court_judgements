"expressly  pleaded  and  properly enumerated  in  detail.  [Gunasinghe  v Hon  Gamini Dissanayake"
"(1994)  2 SrLL.R.  132]. The  2nd  Respondent  has  considered the request made  by the Principal of"
"Pothuhera Junior School,  Kurunegala in deciding to transfer the Appellant.  I am  of the view that"
"it is  not arbitrary or irrational."
"I wish to refer to another matter on which the learned High Court Judge held against the 2nd  and"
"3rd  Respondents. They raised a preliminary objection that the Appellant had failed to exhaust the"
"right of appeal  given to the Appellant and  as  such  this application  must be  dismissed  in  limine."
