"the  Appellant  made  a  confession  and  on  its  contents.  On  the  contrary,"
"there 
is  clear  evidence 
that  no  sooner  she  heard 
the  confession,  she"
"conveyed  it  to  Police  through  her  mobile  phone,  a  fact  confirmed  by  SI"
"Gamage,  which  supports  the  position  that  she  made  a  spontaneous  and"
"consistent  claim  of  admission  of  guilt  by  the  Appellant.  Vinitha  did  not"
"visit  the  crime  scene.  But  she  gave  description  of  how  the  death  of  the"
"deceased  was  committed  by  throttling  the  neck,  which  in  line  with  the"
"opinion of the  medical  officer,  that the  death of the  deceased  was  due to"
"manual strangulation. She  described  the place where the  dead  body was,"
"and the Police witnesses have confirmed that it was lying in the room next"
"to the toilet.  The only way she could describe these, confirms that she was"
"made  aware  of 
them  by 
the  Appellant  himself  when  he  made 
the"
"confession. Of course, he took the precaution of getting her to swear on her"
"child wanting her  not to reveal it to anyone. She explained her reasons for"
"going back  on this  promise.  She  decided  to  pass  that information,  to  the"
"Police understandably with reluctance by weighing over loyalties. She was"
"so  distraught that the  Appellant had  killed  the  deceased,  she  banged  his"
"head 
twice  on 
the  handle  of  his  moped.  Naturally 
it  was  a  difficult"
"decision for  her  and  she  felt  as  if  she  had  surrendered  her  own child  to"
"authorities."
