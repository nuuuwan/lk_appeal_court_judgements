"close  emotional 
relationship  with  him  and 
treated  him 
like  her  own"
"younger  brother.  There  was  no  denial 
that  she  knew 
the  Appellant's"
"relations with Rasika  had soured in the last two days.  Vinitha  claimed that"
"she mediated on behalf of the Appellant."
"Considering their relationship,  it is  very  probable that the  Accused"
"turned to the only woman he could rely on to find  solace by confessing to"
"what  he  did  and  to  seek  her  support  to  get  away  from  the  inevitable"
"consequences. Hence, the claim by the Appellant that it is an improbability"
"is devoid of any merit."
"Another  factor  that  supports  the  making  of  confession  is,  that  the"
"Appellant  returned 
to 
the  compound  where  the  dead  body  was,  from"
"Vinitha's  place, with the belief that he would not be betrayed by her, only"
"to find the Police who had already arrived there upon her information."
"The other inconsistency highlighted by the Appellant is the evidence"
"In  relation 
to 
the  colour  of  clothing  worn  by  the  Appellant.  Witness"
"Kantilatha  spoke  of  a  black  colour  skirt  worn  by  the  deceased  when  she"
"was last seen by her, just before she entered her house. The dead body was"
"clad  in  a  yellow  skirt  and  a  night  dress,  according  to  the  medical  and"
"Police  witnesses.  This  contradiction  is  easy  to  explain  as  Vinitha  says  the"
"Appellant admitted  that he  had  removed  clothing worn by  the  deceased"
