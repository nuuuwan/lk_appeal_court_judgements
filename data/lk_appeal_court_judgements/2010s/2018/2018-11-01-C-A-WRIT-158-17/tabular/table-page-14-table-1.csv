"Unfortunately for the  Petitioner, this clause  is  clear in  its  application  and  does"
"not leave room for the Interview Board to exercise any discretion."
"it then  be  argued  that  the  Interview  Board  acted  irrationally? 
That  said,  can"
"This  Court  does  not think  so.  There  is  nothing  outrageous  in  the  decision  to"
"only allocate  7.S  marks under Section  6.1{II)(a)  nor does the said  decision defy"
"logic.  Is  the  decision  to  allot  only  7.S  marks  unreasonable?  Again,  this  Court"
"does  not  think  so.  As  noted  by  Wade  and  Forsyth/6 
'Decisions  which  are"
"extravagant or capricious cannot be legitimate.  But if the decision  is  within  the"
"confines  of reasonableness,  it is  no  part of the  courts function  to look further"
"into its merits'."
"In  these  circumstances,  this  Court  cannot  agree  with  the  submission  of the"
"learned  Counsel  for the  Petitioner that the  Interview  Board  had  discretion  or"
"that the decision of the interview board is irrational or unreasonable."
"The  Petitioner  has  also  argued  that  the  admission  of the  14A  Respondent  is"
"suspicious  as 
the  details  pertaining  to  the  14A  Respondent 
in 
the 
Interim"
"Marks  List  and 
the  Final  Marks  List  does  not  tally.  The  Respondents  have"
"produced  with 
their  Statement  of  Objections, 
the  Certificate  of  residence"
"relating  to  the  14B  Respondent  issued  by  the  Grama  Niladhari  marked  'R2'"
"'160/A,  Sri  Piyarathana 
which  gives 
the  address  of  the  14B  Respondent  as"
"Mawatha,  Bope,  Galle'.  While  this  Court  notes  that  there  are  discrepancies"
"between  the  two  lists  in  respect  of the  14A  Respondent,  this  Court  is  of the"
"view  that  no  material  has  been  presented  to  this  Court  to  establish  t~at the"
