"was marked as X in the trial. The said surveyor further testified that what are shown as"
"Lot  1 and 2 in his  Plan bearing No.  430  constitute Lot B in Plan No.8 lA,  which the"
"Plaintiff  has  claimed  in  this  case.  Though  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  Plaintiff  has"
"established the boundaries of his land,  the question is whether he has  established his"
"title."
"The  Counsel  for 
the  Defendant~Appellants  submitted 
that  the  Plaintiff's  case 
is"
"premised on an annual permit which was renewable each year and it had been issued in"
"November 1989 in terms of Section 2 of the State Lands  Ordinance No.6 of 1947.  The"
"permit, which was issued in 1989 and marked at the trial as PI, laid down the condition"
"that it was valid only up to the end of 1989 unless and until it was renewed.  In fact,  it"
"was the evidence of the Plaintiff that the permit had been extended till 31.12.1993  and"
"since then the extension of the permit was not effected.  The testimony of the Plaintiff"
"quite  clearly  establishes  that the permit was  not extended beyond  31.12.1993~see the"
"evidence of the Plaintiff under cross~examination on 24.04.1995."
"As would appear this is a rei vindicatio  action based on a permit issued by the State and"
"there is no doubt that the dictum of Gratiaen,J. in D.P.  Palisena v.  KKD. Pererd that"
"a  permit~holder under  the  Land  Development  Ordinance  enjoys  a  sufficient  title  to"
"enable him to maintain a vindicatory action against a trespasser holds good in this case"
"as well. This dictum was adopted with approval by Somawansa, J.  (with Dissanayake,"
". It was the submission of the Counsel 
J. agreeing) in Bandaranayake v.  Karunawathie2"
"for the Defendant~Appellants that as the Plaintiff had not extended the permit beyond"
"31.12.1993,  he couldn't have had and maintained this action.  In other words, when the"
"plaint was filed on 31.07.1991,  the argument was that the Plaintiff might have had title"
"by virtue of the permit but during the pendency of the action the permit had expired. In"
"fact, 
the  trial  itself  concluded  on  01.06.1999  and  the  judgment  was  pronounced  on"
