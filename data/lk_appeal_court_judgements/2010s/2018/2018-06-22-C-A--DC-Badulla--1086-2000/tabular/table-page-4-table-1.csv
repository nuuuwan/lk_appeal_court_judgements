"by virtue of which the Plaintiff had dominium  over the subject-matter of the action had"
"outlived its validity."
"So  this case raises the fundamental question.  Provided that the Plaintiff had sufficient"
"title to vindicate by virtue of his permit on 31.07.1991  (the date of the plaint), it would"
"appear that he lost his  title after 31.12.1993,  long before  the trial in the District Court"
"ended. Could such a Plaintiff continue with his rei vindicatio action?"
"Rights of the parties must be determined as at the time of institution of action"
"The Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent has drawn the attention of this Court to the"
"well-known principle that rights of the parties should be determined as  at the date of"
"the institution of action.  In fact  there is a long line of cases  that have established this"
"principle and I had occasion to allude to the catena of precedents in an appeal from the"
"District  Court  of  Kandy  namely  Upali  Palitha  Mahanama 
v.  Wijayhenagedara"
"(CA  minutes  of  25.05.2018),  which 
Sumanawathie  bearing  No.  CALA  203/2002"
"incidentally offered  an  opportunity to Court to  create  an  exception  to  the long held"
"principle. To my mind the general principle appears to have been enunciated in Silva  v."
