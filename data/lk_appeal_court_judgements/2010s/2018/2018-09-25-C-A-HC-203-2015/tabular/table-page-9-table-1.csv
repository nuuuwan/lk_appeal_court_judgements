"""The  prosecution  case 
rested  on 
two  main  pillars 
-
the 
evidence"
"relating to  the  identity of the  accused and the police evidence relating to"
"the  recovery  of G/66  notes  from 
the  accused. 
--------in  this  case 
the"
"accused were facing  serious  charges  and  in  the  circumstances  if they"
"had  any 
innocuous 
explanation  about 
the  manner 
in  which 
they"
"acquired  their  knowledge  or  came 
to  possess  those  notes  one  would"
"expect them  to  give those explanations to  exculpate themselves ""."
"In  the  said  case, 
the  Court  considered  three  ways  in  which  the  accused"
"persons  could  have  acquire  their  knowledge  about  the  places  where  the  objects"
"were found.  One of the ways was the  accused himself concealing the place where"
"the object was found."
"The 
trial  judge  was  mindful 
that  the  evidence  against  the  accused  was"
"circumstantial  and  was  cautious  when  evaluating  such  evidence  to  determine  the"
"guilt of the accused. Thus, the trial judge's approach in dealing with circumstantial"
"evidence is  not erroneous."
"In 
the  case  of  MM.C  Bandara  Deegahawathura  Vs.  Hon.  Attorney"
"General CA. 61/2001, the Court held that,"
"""if the  prosecution  seeks 
to  prove  a  case  purely  on  circumstantial"
"evidence, 
the  prosecution  must  exclude  the  possibility  that  the  proved"
"facts  are  consistent with the  innocence of the  accused.  If an  explanation"
"which  is  consistent with  the  innocence  of the  accused can  be  seen from"
