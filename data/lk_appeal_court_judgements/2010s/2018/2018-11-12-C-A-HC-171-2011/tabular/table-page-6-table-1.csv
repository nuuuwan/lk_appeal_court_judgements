"When 
this  matter  came  up 
for  argument  before 
this  Court, 
the 
learned"
"Counsel  for the Accused  took up  several defects in  the High  Court Trial."
"Accordingly, 
the  1 st  defect  was  that  there  was  no  proper  identification  of"
"the  Accused.  We  wish  to  place  on  record  that  the  Prosecutrix  had  clearly"
"identified 
the  Accused  when 
he  came 
in 
to 
the  house; 
she  had  also"
"mentioned the name of the accused  to Kanthilatha.  Further,  Prosecutrix had"
"told  the  DMO  who  examined  her  which  is  recorded  in  the  MLR.  Prosecutrix"
"had  mentioned 
the  name  of  the  Accused 
in  her  Police  Statement.  What"
"more  can  a  Court  of  law  could  expect  from  a  Prosecutrix  who  had  been"
"taken  out  by 
force 
in 
the  night  and 
raped.  We  see  no  defect 
in 
the"
"identification of the Accused."
