"These  provisions clearly impose a statutory duty on  the Primary Court Judge to determine and"
"declare the persons entitled to possession  of the  land. They apply to applications made  under"
"section  66(1){a)  as  well  as  under section  66(1){b)  of the Act.  There  is  of course  no  prayer for"
"relief in  an  application  made under section  66(1){a) of the Act but yet the Primary Court Judge"
"has a statutory duty to determine and declare the persons entitled to possession of the land. In"
"this situation one cannot argue that the general principle is that a court is  not entitled to grant"
"relief that has  not been  prayed for by a party."
"Similarly, I am of the view that even in applications made under section 66(1)(b) of the Act there"
"is a statutory duty on the Primary Court Judge to determine and declare the persons entitled to"
"possession  of the land.  This  has  been  done  by the learned  Primary Court Judge  in  the  instant"
