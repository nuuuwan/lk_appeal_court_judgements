"In  Kandy Omnibus  Co  Ltd v T. W Roberts (supra)  Sansoni J,  quoted with approval the following"
"passage from Spencer Bower on Estoppel by Representation (1923) at page 187:"
"""Where it is merely a question of irregularity of procedure, or of a defect in  ' contingent'"
"jurisdiction,  or non-compliance with statutory conditions precedent to the validity of"
"a step in the litigation, of such a character that, if one of the parties be allowed to waive,"
"or by conduct or inaction  to estop himself from  setting up,  such irregularity or want of'"
"contingent' jurisdiction  or  non-compliance,  no  new jurisdiction  is  thereby  impliedly"
"created, and no existing jurisdiction is thereby impliedly extended beyond its existing"
"boundaries, the estoppel will be maintained, and the affirmative answer of illegality"
"will fail, for,  the Royal prerogative not being invaded, and the State therefore not being"
"injured, nor any of His Majesty's subjects for whom that Royal prerogative is held in trust,"
"there is no ground of public policy,  or other just cause,  why the litigant,  to  whom alone"
"in  that  case  the  statutory benefit  belongs,  should  not be  left free  to  surrender it  at"
"pleasure, or why having be surrendered it,  whether by contract, or by conduct or inaction"
"implying consent, he should be afterwards permitted to claim it. Accordingly, in all cases"
"of the first class,  that is, of defectus jurisdictionis the representor has been held incapable"
"of estopping himself from  resisting  the usurped authority;  whereas in  all  those of the"
"other class  that is  of mere defectus triationis the affirmative answer has been rejected,"
"and the representor has been held estopped from objecting to the irregularity"""
