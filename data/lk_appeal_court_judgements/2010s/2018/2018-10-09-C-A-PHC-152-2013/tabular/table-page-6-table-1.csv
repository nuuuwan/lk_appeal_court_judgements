"In Beatrice Perera v The Commissioner of National Housing (supra) the court made the following"
"observation:"
"""Lack of competency may arise in  one of two ways.  A Court may lack jurisdiction over"
"the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure"
"to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power"
"by the Court.  Both  are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly"
"known in the law as a ' patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis"
"and the second a ' latent' or ' contingent' want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis."""
