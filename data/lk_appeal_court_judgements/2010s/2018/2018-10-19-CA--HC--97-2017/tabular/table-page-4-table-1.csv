"The  learned  counsel  for the  appellant argued  that the  victim  had"
"sexual intercourse with other men prior to this incident and due to a land"
"dispute  with  him  his  name  had  been  implicated  by  the  victim's  father."
"Having prior sexual relations with another man is not a ground for appeal."
"The victim was not in a proper mental condition to give consent according"
"to  both  doctors therefore  the  question  of giving  consent does not arise."
