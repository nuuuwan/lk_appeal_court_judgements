"Constitution  is a jurisdiction, which  this Court could  decide  in  its discretion"
"to exercise in  a fit case.  This Court is convinced  that the instant case  is  not"
"one such  case  in  which  it should  exercise  its discretionary writ jurisdiction."
"In these circumstances,  and  for the foregoing  reasons,  this Court decides"
"to  refuse to issue  notices on  the  Respondents."
"This Application  should  therefore stand  dismissed without costs."
