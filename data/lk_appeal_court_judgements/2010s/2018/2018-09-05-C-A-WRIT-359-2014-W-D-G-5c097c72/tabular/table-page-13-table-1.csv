"In these circumstances and  for the foregoing  reasons this Court has  no"
"basis to allow the application  made by the  learned  President's Counsel  for"
"the Petitioner to add a totally new party to this application at this stage."
"Thus,  this Court decides to refuse the said application."
"This Court cannot continue to entertain this application  in  the absence for"
"the  Hon.  Minister who  had  issued the vesting  order,  which  the Petitioner"

"that this application cannot be  maintained."
