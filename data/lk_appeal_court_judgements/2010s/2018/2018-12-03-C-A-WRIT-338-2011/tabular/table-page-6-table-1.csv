"evidence,  with  some  of them  giving  versions  different to  what  was  in  the  '8'"
"report,  especially  with  regard  to  the  manner  in  which  Amerasinghe  received"
"his injuries."
"In  this factual  background,  when  the case  was  called  in  the Magistrate's Court"
"of  Pugoda  on  18th  August  2010,  the  learned  Magistrate  had  made  an  order"
"remanding  the  Petitioners.  The  application  for  bail  had  been  refused  by  the"
"learned  Magistrate  as 
the 
investigations  were  continuing.  The  subsequent"
"revision  application  filed  by 
the  Petitioners 
in 
the  High  Court  of  Gampaha"
"seeking bail had  been rejected by the learned High Court Judge."
"The  Post  Mortem  Report  had  been  submitted  to  the  Magistrate's  Court  of"

to  the"
"petition  marked  IPS'.  This  Court  has  examined  IpS'  and  notes that there were"
"several  external  injuries on  the body of Amerasinghe, which  have  been  caused"
"by  blunt trauma.  Although the  cause  of death  has  been  given  as  head  injuries"
"due  to  blunt  trauma,  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  had  specifically  stated  that"

"homicide and  decided to conduct a Non-Summary Inquiry {NSI},  pending which"
"both Petitioners were kept in  remand custody. The charge sheet had  been filed"
"on 
the  Petitioners 
for  causing 
the  death  of 
ih  February  2011  against"
