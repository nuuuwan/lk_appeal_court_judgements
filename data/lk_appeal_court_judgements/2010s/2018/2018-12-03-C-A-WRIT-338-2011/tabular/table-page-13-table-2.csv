"and  is available to the Petitioner, Gratien J held as follows:"
"tilt is  no doubt a well recognised  principle of law that a Supreme Court will"
"not as  a rule  make  an  order of mandamus or certiorari where there is  an"
"alternative  and  equally  convenient  remedy  available 
to  the  aggrieved"
"party.  But the rule is  not a rigid one.  In  R.  v.  Wandsworth Justices-ex parte"
"Read 6  an  application  was  made 
for  an  order  of  certiorari  quashing  a"
"conviction  made  by  the  justices  in  excess  of their jurisdiction.  Objection"
"was  taken, inter alia,  that as  the accused  had  a right of appeal  to quarter"
"sessions,  certiorari did  not lie.  Caldecote  L.J.,  in  over-ruling the objection,"
"lias  to  the  right  of  appeal  to  quarter  sessions, 
it  may  be  that  the 
said"
"applicant could  have  had  his  remedy  if he  had  pursued  that course,  but I"
"am  not aware  of any  reason  why,  in  such  circumstances  as  these,  if the"
"applicant  prefers to ask  for an  order of certiorari to quash  the conviction"
"obtained  in  the  manner  I  have  described,  the  Court  should  be  debarred"
"from  making  an  order.  In  this  case  it  has  been  admitted  by  the  justices"
"that  a  mistake  was  made.  This  Court 
is 
in  a  position 
to  remedy  that"
"mistake by making an  order of certiorari to quash the conviction, anp that"
"is  the  proper order which  I think this  Court should  make  II.  Humphreys J."
