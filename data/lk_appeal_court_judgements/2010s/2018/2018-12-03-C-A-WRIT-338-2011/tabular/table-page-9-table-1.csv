Whether a Magistrate  is  bound  to  comply with  a direction  issued  by  the"
"Hon. Attorney General prior to the conclusion of a non-summary inquiry."
"All 
parties 
had 
accordingly 
tendered  written 
submissions.  The

"President's  Counsel 
appearing 
for

"It has  been  held  in  several judgments delivered  by this Court as  well as  by the"
"Supreme Court that a Writ will not lie if an  alternative remedy which  is  equally"

"for the  Petitioners to tender  his  response  with  regard  to the  said  submission."

tendered  several 
Accordingly,
