"which contained the relevant deposition cannot be produced in Court.  The Court"
"was  possessed  of the  fact  that  the  said  information  book  was  destroyed  due  to"
"lapse  of time.  Apart  from  the  said  contention  the  defence  has  failed  to  take  up"
"any  infirmity arising out of the  said dying deposition.  The fact that the deceased"
"exclaimed the  name  of the  Appellant on the  brink of death has  been established"
"by the evidence ofPW2 and PWI5. It is  also noted that PWl5 is  an  independent"
"witness."
