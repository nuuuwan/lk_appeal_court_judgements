"Court to use  his judicial  discretion and  decide whether an  application for a trial  de  novo should"
"be allowed or not."
"Accordingly,  if the Practice  Direction 40B  supplementing Part 40 of the UK Civil  Procedure  Rules"
"referred to above  does not apply to the issue  before court the Judge of the Admiralty Court can"
"in  view  of  section  12  of  Admiralty  Jurisdiction  Act  use  his  judicial  discretion  and  decide  the"
"applicable exchange  rate  in  satisfying a judgement entered in foreign  currency in  Sri  lanka. The"
"learned High Court Judge appears to have done so in the instant case although the order is devoid"
"of any reasoning as to why he ordered that it is the rate of conversion as  at the date of payment."
"In this situation, it is  useful to consider how the English  Courts approach this question. In  United"
"Railways of the Havanna and Regia Warehouses Ltd.  (supra) lord Viscount Simonds restated the"
"old  English  rule which  said that a claim  in  foreign  currency for (a)  liquidated debts,  (b)  damages"
"for breach of contract or (c)  damages for tort must be converted to sterling at the rate prevailing"
"at the date of breach.  He  in fact classified the issue as  primarily procedural."
"However, the  House  of lords in  Miliangos v.  George Frank (Textiles)  Ltd.  (supra)  departed from"
"the  rule  stated  in  United Railways  of the Havanna  and Regia  Warehouses  Ltd.(supra)  and  held"
"that if there  was  a necessity to convert a judgement given  in  foreign  currency,  the conversion"
"must be at the applicable rate at the date when leave was given to enforce the judgement, which"
"lord Wilberforce in  delivering the leading judgment understood to mean (at page 813) the date"
"when the court authorizes enforcement of the judgement in terms of sterling pounds."
"Thus,  different formulas apply depending on whether the Practice  Direction 40B supplementing"
"Part  40  of the  UK  Civil  Procedure  Rules  referred  to above  applies  or whether the Judge  of the"
"Admiralty Court can  use his judicial discretion and  decide the applicable exchange rate in view of"
"section 12 of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act."
