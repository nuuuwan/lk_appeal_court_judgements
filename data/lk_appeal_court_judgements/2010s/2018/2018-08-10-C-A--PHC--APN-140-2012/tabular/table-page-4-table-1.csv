"Janak De Silva J."
"This 
is  a  revision  application  against  the  order  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Colombo"
"(Admiralty Court) dated 08.08.2012."
"The  question of law that arises for determination in this case  is what is the applicable exchange"
"rate  in  satisfying  a judgement entered  in  foreign  currency in  Sri  Lanka.  The  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  decided  that it is  the  rate  of conversion  as  at the  date  of payment which  is  the  position"
"urged  by  the  Plaintiffs-Respondents  (Respondents). 
The  Defendant-Petitioner (Petitioner)  on"
"the other hand  relying on  Mercantile Agency v.  Ismail (26  N.L.R.  326)  contends that the rate  of"
"conversion should  be the applicable exchange rate as  at the date of breach or date of judgment"
"and hence this  revision application."
"Let  me  at  the  outset  consider  the  possible  dates  at  which  the  conversion  may  be  done  and"
"consider the advantages and disadvantages of each  date."
"The general principle is that the rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of action"
"[Silva  v.  Fernando  et al (15  N.L.R.  499)].  However,  certain  exceptions  are  said  to exist to this"
"general principle [Thangavadivel v.  Inthiravathy (53 N.L.R. 369)]. However, in Miliangos v.  George"
"Frank (Textiles) Ltd.  [1976 A.C.  443], Lord Wilberforce rejects using the date on  which the action"
"is  brought  as  the  date  for  conversion  since  these  dates  still  leave  the  judgment creditor  at  a"
"significant currency risk. According to Lord Wilberforce adopting the date on which the action is"
"brought as the appropriate date for conversion  leaves the judgment creditor at the mercy of the"
"debtor's obstructive tactics and the law's delays (at page 469)."
"The  next  option  is  the  date  of breach.  Support for this  date  appears  to  be  based  more  on  an"
"English  law perspective. In  Re  United Railways of the Havana and RegIa  Warehouses Ltd [(1960)"
"2 All.  E.  R.  332]  one of the strongest reasons  cited for continuing with the breach  date rule was"
"that it sustained uniformity in the English legal system.  Lord Viscount Simonds in this case stated"
"that it would  be  unrefined  to  have  different  rules  as  to the  date  of conversion  depending  on"
"whether the claim is for a breach of contract, in tort or for a debt."
