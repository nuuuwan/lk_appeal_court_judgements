"In  Miliangos,  Lord  Wilberforce  referred to currency stability and  stated that floating currencies",""
"","have  become the norm and fixed  currencies the exception  (at page  463).  In  such  a context, the"
"","breach  date  rule  was  held  to  be  unsatisfactory  because  that  rule  was  posited  on  a  currency"
"","system  that was  fixed.  For  instance,  during the  period the  breach  date  rule  was  in  existence  it"
"was  highly  unnatural for the  relative  value  of currency to change  rapidly  between the  'breach",""
"date', date of judgment or 'date of payment'.",""
"Therefore,  even  a creditor who  recovered  the  sterling  equivalent  converted  as  at  the  date  of",""
"","breach did not suffer a huge loss.  However, in a context where world currencies are 'floating' this"
"will not be the case and rapid changes in the relative value of currency is the norm. For instance,",""
"if the foreign currency in  which judgment is sought appreciates between the date of breach and",""
"the date of payment, the judgment creditor will  be  able to obtain  a greater amount of sterling",""
"based on prevailing exchange rates.",""
"","However, since the breach date rule requires him to rely on the past exchange rate he will recover"
"","less than he is entitled to. This can  be problematic especially in situations where the legal system"
"","is  slow  moving  and  the  judgment  debtor  has  the  necessary  tools  to  drag  on  and  delay  the"
"litigation process.",""
"","Further, Lord Simon of Glaisdale in his dissent in Miliangos v.  George Frank (Textiles) Ltd.  (supra)"
"","pOinted out that several statutory enactments and  rules had  been formulated in England on the"
"","basis of the breach date rule and that disturbing the said rule is likely to create dislocations in the"
"English  legal system (at page 487).",""
"","However,  the  breach  date  rule  is  inequitable  even  from  a judgment  debtor's  perspective.  For"
"","instance,  if the  foreign  currency  in  which  the  claim  is  made  depreciates  between  the  date  of"
"","breach and date of payment, requiring the debtor to pay for example the rupee equivalent as at"
"the  date  of  breach  is  an","imposition  of  an  obligation  on  him  to  pay  more  than  he  should  at"
"prevailing market prices.",""
