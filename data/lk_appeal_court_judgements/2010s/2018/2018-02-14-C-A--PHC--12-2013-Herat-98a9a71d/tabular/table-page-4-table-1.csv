"had  filed  a revision  application  in  the Provincial  High  Court of North Central"
"Province  holden  in  Anuradhapura  seeking  a revision  of the order of the"

"pronounced  its judgment dated  2013-02-22,  holding that there is  no  basis"
"to deviate from  the conclusions arrived  at by  the learned  Magistrate. The"
"Provincial  High  Court on  that basis had  proceeded  to dismiss the said"
"revision  application."
"It is that judgment that the Appellant is  canvassing  in  this appeal  before"
"this Court."

"to see  any  basis to assail  the orders of the lower Courts as the scope of the"

"proceedings of this  nature."

""" ...  At such  inquiry the person  on  whom  summons  under section  6 has"
"been  served  shall  not be  entitled to contest any  of the  matters stated  in"
