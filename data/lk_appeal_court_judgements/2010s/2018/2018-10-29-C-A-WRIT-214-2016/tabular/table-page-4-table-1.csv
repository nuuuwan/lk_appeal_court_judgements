"W
rit  is  a  discretionary  remedy,  and  therefore,  a  party  applying"
"for  writ  must  inter  alia  act  with  promptitude  and  utmost  good"
"faith (uberrima fide).  The petitioner has done neither."
"According 
to 
the  petitioner  he  has 
come 
to  know  about"
"cancellation 
in  1996  and  then  he  has  complained 
it  to  the"
"Human Rights Commission in 2013 and got the reply also in the"
"same  yearâ€•vide  P18  and  P19. 
  Then  at 
least  by  2013  the"
"petitioner knew by P19 the position of the 3rd respondent on this"
"matter.  According to P19, the land is being cultivated not by the"
"petitioner but by the other sisters of the petitioner including the"
"6th respondent.  However, he has come to Court in 2016."
"The  fact  that  he  came  to  know  about  the  cancellation  of  the"
"Permit and dividing the land among three of them  only in 2013"
"is  also  wrong.    This  is  borne  out  by  3R1(a)  tendered  by  the  3rd"
"respondent  with  his  statement  of  objections.    That  is  a  letter"
"admittedly  written  by  the  petitioner  to  the  3rd  respondent  in"
"2010  stating  that  the  cancellation  of  the  Permit  is  wrong  and"
"also  asking  the  3rd  respondent  to  divide  the  land  among  the"
"petitioner 
and  his 
two 
sisters  who 
are 
the  6th 
and  7th"
"respondents to this case. This is exactly what the 3rd respondent"
"is going to do now.  The petitioner now wants the entire land to"
"him!"
"The application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs."
