"M
ahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The  5th  defendant-petitioner  has  filed  this  revision  application"
"seeking  to  set  aside  (a)  the  Judgment  of  the  learned  District"
"Judge dated 31.01.2001 and (b) the order of the learned District"
"Judge dated 21.05.2002."
"The  5th  defendant  has  not  preferred  an  appeal  against 
the"
"Judgment.    After  the  Judgment,  the  Interlocutory  Decree  has"
"been entered, and Final Partition Plan has been prepared."
"At  the  Scheme  Inquiry,  the  learned  District  Judge  has  refused"
"the  5th  defendant 
to  participate  on 
the  basis 
that 
the  said"
"defendant has not been allocated any shares in the Judgment."
"Further  the  learned  District  Judge,  ex  mero  motu,  has  set  aside"
"some  parts  of  the  Judgment  delivered  by  his  predecessor  which"
"are in favour of the 5th defendant on the basis of per incuriam."
"This  in  my  view  is  unwarranted.    Everybody  was  satisfied  with"
"the  Judgment  until  that  time.    Had  the  learned  District  Judge"
"allowed  the  5th  defendant  to  participate  at  the  Scheme  Inquiry,"
"the  5th  defendant  would  not  have  come  before 
this  Court"
"challenging  the  Judgment.    On  that  basis,  I  refuse  to  grant  the"
"first  relief  of  the  5th  defendant-petitioner,  i.e.  to  set  aside  the"
"Judgment of the District Court."
"The learned District Judge in the Judgment has given undivided"
"72/3456  shares  to  the  5th  defendant  subject  to  establishing  the"
"entitlement  to  that  share  later.    Even  though  that  finding  is"
"injustice  would  occur 
to  all 
the 
contradictory  per  se,  grave"
"parties, if this Court is to set aside the Judgment and order trial"
"de novo on that lapse on the part of the learned Judge."
