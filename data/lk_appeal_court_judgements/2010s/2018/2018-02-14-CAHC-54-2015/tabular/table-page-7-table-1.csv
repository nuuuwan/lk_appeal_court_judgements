"The  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submits  that  the  offence  on  which  the  appellant was"
"convicted  is  a cognate  offence  hence  the  appellant was  not told  of the  amendment"
"and he was  not given an  opportunity to defend  himself."
"The  Learned  DSG  invites  this  Court  to  consider  the  evidence  and  find  the  appellant"
"guilty for attempted rape."
"On  the  face  of the  Judgment and  the sentence  the  appellant was  convicted  under a"
"non-existing section  (Law).  But the sentencing  is  on a section which  is  available in  the"
"Penal  Code.  Presuming  there is  a typographical  error,  can  the judge convict a person"
"on  a different cognate offence."
"Our criminal law is well established in recognizing the right of the accused and ensured"
"of  a  fair  trial  under  the  Supreme  Law  namely  the  Constitution.  When  a  person  is"
"charged,  it is  mandatory to provide him with clear charge sheet under a valid  law."
