"Samayawardhena, J."
"When this case came up before me for the first time the Court was"
"invited to deliver the Judgment on the written submissions already"
"filed of record."
"The petitioner sold 38  units of  fishing nets to the 2nd respondent"
"and the latter complained to the 1st respondent-Consumer Affairs"
"Authority that they were inferior in quality.  The petitioner denied"
"the  allegation  and  the  Consumer  Affairs  Authority 
initiated  an"
"inquiry 
into 
the  said  complaint  under 
the  Consumer  Affairs"
"Authority  Act,  No.  9  of  2003.    Halfway  through  the  inquiry,  the"
"petitioner  agreed 
to  supply  25  new 
fishing  nets 
to 
the  2nd"
"respondent  as  a  settlement.    This  the  petitioner  says  he  did  in"
"deference  to  the  Consumer  Affairs  Authority. 
  Admittedly,  the"
"petitioner  handed  over 
the  said  new 
fishing  nets 
to 
the  2nd"
"respondent  on  21.08.2015.1    However  the  petitioner  says  that  the"
"2nd respondent deliberately avoided signing the settlement for the"
"Consumer  Affairs  Authority  to  terminate  the  proceedings.2    Ten"
"days after accepting the said fishing nets, the 2nd respondent has"
"again  complained  to  the  Consumer  Affairs  Authority  stating  that"
"those  new  nets  are  also 
inferior 
in  quality.3 
  Thereafter 
the"
"Consumer Affairs Authority has decided to re-fix the inquiry.4  The"
"petitioner has raised a preliminary objection to re-fixing the matter"
"for the inquiry, and the Consumer Affairs Authority has overruled"
"that objection by X18 and the reasons have been given by X19.  It"
"is 
against 
that  determination, 
the  petitioner  has 
filed 
this"
"application seeking to quash the same by way of a writ of certiorari"
"1 Vide X5."
"2 Vide paragraph 17 of the petition."
"3 Vide X10."
"4 Vide X12."
