"This position once again confirms without any ambiguity whatsoever that"
"the northern boundary in both Plan X and Yare identical to one another."
"The 
above 
three 
boundaries 
confirmed 
identical 
to 
the"
"schedule  to  the  plaint  by  the  preliminary  survey  EL  132  has  thus  been"
"confirmed identical by the survey done by the defendants' surveyor."
"In this backdrop it is most respectfully submitted to this Court"
"that the  defendants' contention in  their statement of claim that the  land"
"sought to  be partitioned differs  in  Plan  EL132  is absolutely baseless and"
"is without any merit.  The analysis by the  learned  trial Judge in arriving"
"at the finding that the plaintiff should succeed in the District Court action"
"is not only based on the identity and comparison of the two plans referred"
"alone. 
In fact as clearly borne out by the findings in the lengthy judgment"
"wherein  the  learned  trial  Judge  had  gone  into  detail  in  analyzing  the"
"pedigree claimed by the respective parties and the relationship they claim"
"to have. 
In doing so he has come to the finding that on those grounds too,"
"the defendants' statement of claim is without merit."
"This Court is of the view that  it becomes manifestly clear that"
"the learned trial Judge has arrived at the correct finding.  Therefore, we do"
"not wish  to  interfere  with  the  findings  of the  learned  District Judge  and"
"dismiss this appeal."
