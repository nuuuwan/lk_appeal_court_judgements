"111. 
Breach  of rules  of natural justice in relation to  rights  of third"
"parties."
"In relation to  his  first  ground  of appeal,  the  Appellant relied  upon"
"the  Government  Gazette  No.  38/16  of  01.06.1979  by  which  the  Urban"
"Development  Areas  were  demarcated  and 
identified.  The  Appellant"
"submits that the village of ""Kappagoda""  where the building is located, is not"
"included  in  the said  Gazette or the  Gazette  No.  1070  of 05.03.1999  which"
"was published subsequently."
"His  second  ground  of appeal  is  based  on the  principle  of  estoppel."
"According  to  the  Appellant,  the  Respondent  is  the  person  who  sold  the"
"property  to  him  with  the  assertion  that  no  building  plan  is  needed  for"
"construction.  However, 
in 
instituting  action  he  has 
taken  a 
totally  a"
"contrary  position  by  claiming 
that 
the  Appellant  has  constructed 
a"
"building  without  an  approved  building  plan.  Therefore, 
the  Appellant"
"claims that the Respondent is now estopped from claiming that a building"
"plan is needed."
"The  third  ground  of  appeal  is  based  on  the  rights  of  a  third  party"
"who  has  bought  over  the  property  from  the  Appellant,  even  before  he"
"appeared  in  the  Magistrate's  Court  and  the  order  of  demolition  made"
"without the participation of the new owner clearly violates rules of natural"
"justice."
"In the revision application of the Appellant, he sought to  revise the"
"said order of demolition on the following grounds pleaded as exceptional;"
