"Garney's Reports,  page 479. Elenborough dictum states:"
""" No  person accused of crime is bound to  offer any expLanation of his conduct or"
"of circumstances  of suspicion  which  attach 
to  him;  but,  nevertheLess, 
if  he"
"refuses  to  do  so  where a strong prima  facie  case has been made out,  and when"
"it  is 
in  his  own  power  to  offer  evidence,  if such  exist, 
in  expLanation  of such"
"suspicious circumstances  which  wouLd show them to  be fallacious  and expLicabLe"
"consistently with his  innocence,  it is  a reasonabLe  and justifiabLe conclusion  that"
"from  doing 
so  onLy 
from 
the  conviction 
that 
the  evidence  so 
he  refrains"
"suppressed or not adduced wouLd operate adverseLy to his interest""."
