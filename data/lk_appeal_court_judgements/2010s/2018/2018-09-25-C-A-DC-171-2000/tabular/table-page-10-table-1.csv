"(However, whilst giving evidence the Plaintiff stated that his old passport was in Australia and he"
"did not bring it to Sri Lanka since it has become in valid. Even so, he testified he could produce the"
"passport if the need arose. But he has not produced it. However, the Plaintiff has quite clearly given"
"evidence  that  since  his  migration  to  Australia  in  1966  he  had  obtained  a permanent job  and"
"brought a house for himself in which he has been residing with his family members  and he never"
"visited Sri Lanka until he came back for  the first time in 1991. The defense has not been successful"
"in assailing this evidence. Accordingly I decide that the Plaintiff was not in the country at the time"
"of the execution of the impugned Deed.)"
