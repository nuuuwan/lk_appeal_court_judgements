"I  am  of 
the  view 
that 
the  Court  of  Appeal 
(Appellate"
"Procedure)  Rules,  1990  have  been  formulated  to  facilitate"
"the  judicial  process  and  with  a  view  of  achieving  justice"
"rather  than  injustice.  It  appears  from  Rule  3(14)  that  it  is"
"contemplated that where there is some non-compliance with"
"the Rules, the Registrar should put up the application for an"
"order  of  Court.  The 
intention  of  this  Rule 
is  to  give  an"
"opportunity 
for 
the  Court 
to  exercise 
its  discretion  with"
"respect to the matter as is implicit from the use of the word"
"""may"" in the last sentence of Rule 3(1)(a). Furthermore I am"
"of the view  that  in  applications for prerogative relief  where"
"this  Court  enjoys  a  supervisory  jurisdiction,  Court  should"
"not  non-suit  a  party  where  the  non-compliance  with  Rules"
"takes place due to no fault of that party."
