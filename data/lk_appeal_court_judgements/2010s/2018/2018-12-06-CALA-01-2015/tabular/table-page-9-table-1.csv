"Quazis just ignored it without taking a serious note of it.  I direct"
"the Chairman of the Board of Quazis to make an initial inquiry"
"into that matter and then refer the matter with his observations"
"and  with  the  relevant  documents  including  the  contradictory"
"proceedings to the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission"
"for suitable action."
"There  is  no  magic  in  the  phrase  “exceptional  circumstances”."
"Nor 
is  there 
fixed  meaning  to 
it. 
 
It  depends  on 
facts  and"
"circumstances  of  each 
individual  case. 
  The  petitioner  after"
"narrating his case in the petition filed before the Board of Quazis"
"in 
paragraph 
21 
has 
stated 
that 
there 
are 
exceptional"
"circumstances 
for 
the 
Board 
to 
exercise 
its 
revisionary"
"jurisdiction."
"The  Board  has  taken  the  view  that  the  petitioner  has  come"
"before  the  Board  on  06.06.2010  challenging  the  order  of  the"
"Quazi  dated  09.09.2006  and  there  is  an  unexplainable  delay."
"Firstly,  the  petitioner  went  before  the  Board  of  Quazis  not  on"
"06.06.2010  but  on  06.08.2010.    Secondly,  nowhere  does  the"
"petitioner state in the petition that he challenges the order dated"
"09.09.2006.    His  complaint  as  I  understand  is  that  during  the"
"course  of  his  Talak  Divorce  Application,  without  a 
formal"
"application, an order was made to pay maintenance in a sum of"
"Rs.10,000/= both to the respondent wife and the child, but after"
"he obtained Talak divorce, he is not bound to pay maintenance"
"to his former wife."
"It  appears  that  the  Quazi  did  not  write 
in  the  proceedings"
"whether that sum is only for the child or only for the wife or for"
"both, but later added the words “for child” after the sum."
