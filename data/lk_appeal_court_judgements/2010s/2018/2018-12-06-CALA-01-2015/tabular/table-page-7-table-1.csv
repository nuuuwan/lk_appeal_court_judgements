"no  specific  averment  in  the  petition  to  say  that  the  petitioner"
"hereinbefore  did  not 
invoke  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Board  of"
"Quazis on the same matter."
"In  my  view,  the  Supreme  Court  and  Court  of  Appeal  Rules  are"
"inapplicable in proceedings before the Board of Quazis."
"Let  me  now  consider 
the  second  ground  upon  which 
the"
"application  of  the  petitioner  was  dismissed  without  going  into"
"the  merits.    That  is  on  the  basis  that  “the  petitioner  has  not"
"averred  any  exceptional  circumstances  for  delay 
in  filing 
this"
"revision  application.”    I  cannot  understand  what  is  meant  by"
"averring  exceptional  circumstances  for  the  delay.    In  my  view,"
"showing exceptional circumstances to come by way of revision is"
"one  thing,  and  the  delay  in  coming  to  Court  is  another  thing."
"There  is  nothing  called  showing  exceptional  circumstances  for"
"the delay.  What you are expected to do is to explain the delay,"
"and  not  showing  exceptional  circumstances  for  the  delay.    It"
"appears  that  the  Board  has 
tried  to  apply  those  principals"
"without exactly knowing the true meaning of them."
"Express  provisions  have  been  made 
in  section  63  and 
the"
"proviso  to  Rule  1  in  the  Fifth  Schedule  of  the  Muslim  Marriage"

"time."
"According to the Quasi Court Records, the respondent has made"
"an  application  on  8th  October  2009  stating  that  the  petitioner"
"did  not  pay  maintenance  to  the  child  from  March  2007,  which"
"was said to be in total a sum of Rs.260,000/=.  Then according"
"to the typed notes under the date 10.10.2009, straightaway the"
"Quazi has issued the Enforcement Certificate to the Magistrate’s"
