"We do  hereby appoint  the  survivor of us  to  be  the executor/executrix of this  Last Will  and"
"Testament. """
"As  could be seen, the above will which is quite infelicitously entitled 'Joint last will"""
"bears the hallmarks and features  of commonality with a typical mutual will wherein"
"two individuals, for instance a husband and wife as in this case, come together to an"
"agreement in the will that the first to die (wife) will leave her property to the survivor"
"(husband),  with  a  further  bequest  that  whatever  is  left  at  husband's  death  will"
"devolve on one or more ultimate beneficiaries."
