"14"
"Though  the  learned  District  Judge  has  said 
in  his  Judgement  that  the  corpus  is"
"mentioned in  the account sheets of the  Partnership,  it is  not correct with 
regard"
"to  the  balance  sheet  as  at  31.03.1974  (1514)  which 
is  the  only  balance  sheet"
"It does  not describe the  land  and 
relevant to a year after the  dissolution  by  P14."
"buildings belonging to the partnership, but only state 'as per the last balance sheet'"
"but the Defendants have not tendered the balance sheets for the year 1973, 1972,"
"1971 and  1970 which are the years following the dissolution of the partnership by"
"P14.  Under such  circumstances the term 'as  per the last balance sheet' cannot be"
"construed  to indicate as  same  as  the assets  of the  partnership that was  dissolved"
"by P 14."
"For  the  foregoing  reason 
this  court  cannot  agree  with  the  decision  of  learned"
"District Judge that the corpus of the partition action forms part of the assets of an"
"existing  partnership and  that it cannot  be  partitioned.  The  learned  District judge"
"erred in  evaluating evidence before him and  applying law relating to partnerships."
"Therefore, this court has to vacate the judgment dated  23.08.2000 of the  learned"
"District Judge of Nawara  Eliya  in case  No  P 25/89."
"Though  this  court  vacate  the  judgment  of the  learned  District  Judge,  this  court"
"cannot  proceed  to  make  an  order to  partition  the  whole  corpus  depicted  in  the"
"preliminary  Plan  No.  2632  dated  09.10.1997  for the  reasons  given  below  in  this"
"judgment."
"It is  true  parties  have  admitted the  corpus  depicted  in  the aforesaid  plan  and  the"
"deeds tendered  by the Plaintiff to support his pedigree were not challenged  at the"
"closure  of the  Plaintiff's  case  or when  they  were  marked. 
There  is  nothing  to"
