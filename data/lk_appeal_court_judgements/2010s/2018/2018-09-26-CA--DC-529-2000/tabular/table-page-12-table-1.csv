"The  Defendant Respondents argue  that the  partnership continued  even  after the"
"execution  of P14  stating the  dissolution  was  done  only as  far  as  the  two  retiring"
"partners were concerned."
"However,  the  careful  reading  of the  above  quoted  paragraphs  will  show that  pt"
"Defendant Bandula and Peddrik Appuhamy (original Plaintiff) continued to carry on"
"the same business after 01.11.1969 but not the same partnership and aforequoted"
"paragraphs further show that the  partners  intended  to wind  up  the  affairs of the"
"partnership  business  that they  carried  on.  Trade  name  has  a good  will.  It  has  a"
"proprietary value. 
It is something that can  be transferred.  Therefore, mere use of"
"the same trade name by some of the partners after the dissolution of a partnership"
"will  not  make 
the  new  business 
relationship  a  continuation  of  the  previous"
"partnership.  Partnership generally means an  arrangement of two or more persons"
"by which they agree to share  in  all assets,  profits, and  financial and  legal  liabilities."
"So,  it is  a relationship  between  the  partners. 
If two  retires from  the  partnership"
"business  and 
the  other  two  continue  with  the  same  business,  the  relationship"
"between the two who continue  with the  business forms a new partnership as  far"
"as the retired  persons do not share  profits,  losses  and  pool assets to continue the"
"business.  There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that the  two  partners  when  retired  on"
"31.08.1969  continued  to contribute to the assets,  capital,  or shared  the  profits of"
"the  business  after the  dissolution  by  P14. 
In  such  a situation  dissolution  of the"
"the  remaining  3 
partnership  that  existed  between  1st  Defendant,  Bandula  and"
"partners of the original partnership has to be  considered as the termination of the"
"partnership business relationship between them.  Even two of them carried on the"
"same  businesses  under the same  name and  style,  it is  a new partnership between"
"and  limited  to those 
two.
