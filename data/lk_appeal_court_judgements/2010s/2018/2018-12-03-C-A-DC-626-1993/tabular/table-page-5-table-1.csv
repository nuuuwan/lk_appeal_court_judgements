is 
After  hearing  both  parties'  submission  and  perusal  of  the  documents,"
"","clear  that  the  Appellants  refer  their  issue  of  prescription  for  the  property  in"
"","question."
"","In the judgment the  learned  District Judge also specifically referred to the only"
"","issue  between  the  two  parties  -
the  issue  of prescription  and  examined  the"
"","evidence to see whether,  in  fact the defendant has prescribed to the  land."
"","In  the  trial,  the  Respondent  giving  evidence  stated  in  his  evidence  inter  alia"
"","that  Oilin  (mother  of  the  Appellants)  transferred  her  rights  (referred  to  the"
"","pedigree 
of 
the 
respondent) 
in 
the 
corpus 
by  Deed  No. 
2143  dated"
"","05.10.1963  (marked  as  P7)  to  Ekmon  Ranaweera.  The  Respondent  further"
"","stated  that  he  became  a  co-owner  of the  corpus  by  Deed  No  2886  dated"
"","01.04.1981  (marked  as P17)  from  the  said  Ekmon  Ranaweera  and  Lavaneris"

is  seen 
from 
the  District  Court  proceedings 
that, 
the  4th  Defendant, 
the"
"","predecessor-in-tile  of the  Appellants  in  his  evidence  has  accepted  that  said"
"","Oilin  has  sold  her  rights  under  P7 
in  1963.  He  stated 
that, 
though  Oilin"
"","transferred  by  P7 
in  1963 
that 
they  were 
in  occupation  of  the 
land  and"
"","premises and  that no one disturbed his possession  (vide page 2 of the District"
"","Court-proceedings  dated  03.11. 1992).  Also  the  learned  District  Judge  in  his"
"","judgment observed  that the  4th  Defendant had  signed  P7  as  a witness;  but in"
"","the  cross  examination  the 4th  Defendant has stated  that  he  became  aware  of"
"","the  sale  by  P7  only  after the  institution  of the  instant  action- when  Oilin  told"
"","him  about  10  months  previously  (vide  proceedings  dated  03.11.1992  - page"
