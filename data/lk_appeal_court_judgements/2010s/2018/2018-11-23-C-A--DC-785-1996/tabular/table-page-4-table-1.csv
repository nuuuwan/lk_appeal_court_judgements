"Rajendran Chettiar case is not only binding on this Bench as it is"
"presently constituted, but also reflects the practice of Court both in"
"England as well as in Sri Lanka.”"
"In Ranasinghe v. Madilin Nona (SC Appeal No.03/09, SC (HC) LA"
"No.147/08)  decided  on  16.03.2012  and  reported  in  [2012]  BLR"
"109  Justice  Ratnayake  with  Justice  Suresh  Chandra  and"
"Justice  Dep 
(later  Chief  Justice)  agreeing 
followed 
the  said"
"Rajendran Chettiar case."
"Justice  Tilakawardane  with  the  agreement  of  Justice  Marsoof"
"and  Justice 
Imam 
in  Prof. 
I.K.  Perera  v.  Prof.  Dayananda"
"Somasundara (SC Appeal No. 152/2010) decided on 17.03.2011"
"also had no hesitation to refer with approval the said Full Bench"
"decision of the Supreme Court."
"Notwithstanding this was a Full Bench decision of the Supreme"
"Court,  still,  there  were  some 
lingering  doubts  regarding  the"
"correctness  of 
this  decision. 
  Therefore, 
in  Senanayake  v."
"Jayantha  (SC  Appeal  No.  41/2015)  decided  on  04.08.2017,  a"
"Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court (consisting of seven Judges)"
"revisited the Chettiar’s Judgment."
"One of the main concerns for such a necessity, in my view, was"
"the  prejudice  caused  to  some  of  the  appellants  whose  lawyers"
"filed final appeals against the orders of the District Court on the"
"basis of the Judgment of Justice Sharvananda in Siriwardena v."
"Air Ceylon Ltd (supra).  Therefore, there was a growing tendency"
"to  argue 
that 
the  Chettiar’s  Judgment  has  no  retrospective"
"effect."
