"Samayawardhena, J."
"The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant seeking"
"to recover some money.  The defendant sought dismissal of the"
"action. 
  At  the  trial,  upon 
issues  being  raised,  the 
learned"
"District  Judge  has  decided  to  try  issue  Nos.  5-7  raised  by  the"
"defendant  as  preliminary  legal  issues.    Those  issues  have  been"
"answered  in  favour  of  the  defendant,  and  the  plaintiffâ€™s  action"
"has  been  dismissed.    It  is  against  this  order  the  plaintiff  has"
"preferred this direct appeal."
"At  the  argument  before  this  Court,  the  learned  counsel  for  the"
"defendant-respondent  moved  to  dismiss  the  appeal  in  limine  on"
"the  basis  that  the  direct  appeal  filed  against  that  order  under"
"section  754(1)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  is  misconceived  in"
"law,  and  the  proper  remedy  was  to  come  by  way  of  leave  to"
"appeal under section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code."
"The  question  whether  an  appeal  or  leave  to  appeal  lies  against"
"an  ""order""  of  the  District  Court  had  been  a  subject  of  much"
"controversy for a long period of time."
"One  school  of  thought  represented  by  the  leading  local  case  of"
"Siriwardena  v.  Air  Ceylon  Ltd 
[1984]  1  Sri  LR  286  Justice"
"Sharvananda 
(later  Chief 
Justice) 
opted 
to 
adopt 
""order"
"approach"" 
(suggested  by  Lord  Alverstone  C.J., 
in  Bozson  v."
"Altrincham  Urban District Council [1903] 1 KB 547) to determine"
"that  question. 
  The  ""order  approach""  contemplates  only  the"
"nature of the order in isolation.  When taken in isolation, if the"
"order  finally  disposes  of  the  matter  in  dispute  without  leaving"
"the suit alive, the order is final, and a direct appeal is the proper"
"remedy against such order."
