"but  must  be  found  in  the  express  language  of some  statutory  provision.  The  ordinary"
"canons  of construction  apply  in  ascertaining the  meaning of a taxing  statute:  ""the only"
"safe rule is to look at the words of the enactments and see what is the intention expressed"
"by these words."" If in so construing the statute the language is found to be so ambiguous"
"that it is in doubt whether tax is attracted or not, the doubt must be resolved in favour"
"of the taxpayer, because it is  not possible to fall back on any principle of common law"
"or equity to fill a gap in a taxing statute. "" The subject is not to be taxed unless the words"
"of the taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax upon  him "".  However, this does  not"
"prevent the court from construing a taxing statute against the subject, where that appears"
"to be the correct interpretation of a provision the meaning of which  it may be  difficult to"
"understand. Difficulty does not absolve the court from the duty of construing a statute;"
"it is  only when  ambiguity remains after the statute has  been  properly construed  that"
"the court is entitled to decide in favour of the taxpayer"". (Emphasis added)"
