"The  learned  Counsel  for the Appellant submitted that ""the Assessment  has  been  issued  a little"
"over  two  months  subsequent  to  the  date  on  which  the  time  bar  commences""  and  that  ""the"
"Assessment was received  by the Appellant on 24th July 2012, which is almost three months over"
"the date on which the time bar commences""."
"In  addressing this submission,  it is  important to note the distinction  between  an  ""Assessment"""
"and ""Notice of Assessment""."
"Section 28(1)  of the VAT Act as  amended deals with the making of an  Assessment and  Notice of"
"Assessment.  Accordingly,  Assessment  is  a  departmental  computation  of  the  amount  of  VAT"
"payable by a person for the relevant taxable period. Notice of Assessment is the formal intimation"
"to the person of the fact that such an Assessment  has  been made."
