"The  learned counsel  for the Appellant concedes this point in  submitting that the Sale  of Goods"
"Ordinance  applies  to  the  relevant  contracts  in  relation  to  when  the  property  or  title  to  the"
"underlying goods passes.  However, he contends that the goods forming the subject matter of the"
"contracts are specific or ascertained  goods and that in terms of section  18 of the Sale  of Goods"
"Ordinance, the property is transferred to the buyer at such time the parties to the contract intend"
"it to be transferred."
"We  are  of the  view  that the  goods  forming  the  subject  matter of the  contracts  between  the"
"Appellant and his contractors are not specific or ascertained goods but unascertained goods. The"
"contracts do not identify the particular trees to be cut.  It refers only to the number of trees. The"
"contracts  require  the  contractor to take  over the trees that are  identified  by  the  field  officer."
"Hence  the  goods  remain  unascertained  as  at  the  date  of payment  and  passing  of  ""exclusive"
"ownership of goods"" did  not for the purposes of the Sale  of Goods  Ordinance take  place  at the"
"date of payment as  submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellant."
"Section  19 of the Sale  of Goods Ordinance sets out different rules for ascertaining the intention"
"of the  parties  as  to  the  time  at  which  the  property  in  the  goods  pass  to the  buyer  unless  a"
"the 
different  intention  appears  from  the  terms  of the  contract,  conduct  of the  parties  and"
"circumstances of the case.  Rule 5 thereunder specifies that where there is a contract for the sale"
"of  unascertained  or  future  goods  by  description,  and  goods  of  that  description  and 
in  a"
"deliverable state are  unconditionally appropriated to the contract,  either by the seller with the"
"assent  of the  buyer  or  by  the  buyer  with  the  assent  of the  seller,  the  property  in  the  goods"
"thereupon  passes  to the  buyer.  In  Kursell v.  Timber Operators &  Contractors Ltd.  [(1927)  1 K.B."
"298]  the  plaintiff sold  to  the  defendants  all  the  trees  in  a Latvian  forest  which  conformed  to"
"certain  measurements  on  a  particular  date,  the  buyer  to  have  15  years  in  which  to  cut  and"
"remove the timber. The English Court of Appeal held that the property in the trees had not passed"
"to the  defendants  as  the goods  were  not sufficiently identified, since  not all  the  trees  were to"
"pass but only those conforming to the stipulated measurements."
