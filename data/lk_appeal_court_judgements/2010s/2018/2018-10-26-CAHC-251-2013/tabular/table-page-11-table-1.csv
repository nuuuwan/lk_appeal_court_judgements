"""In  assessing  the punishment that should be passed on  an  offender,  a Judge"
"should  consider  the  matter of sentence  both  from 
the  point of view  of the"
"public  and the  offender~ Judges  are  too  often  prone  to  look  at the  question"
"in  determining  the 
only  from 
the  angle  of the  offender.  A  Judge  should,"
"proper sentence,  first  consider  the gravity of the  offence  as  it appears  from"
"the  nature  of  the  act 
itself  and  should  have  regard 
the  punishment 
to"
"provided  in 
the  Penal  Code  or  other  statute  under  which 
the  offender  is"
"charged.  He  should also  regard  the  effect of the  punishment as  a  deterrent"
"and  consider  to  what  extent  it  will  be  effective.  If the  offender  held  a"

"should  know the sentence and the reasoning  for the sentence."
"Judicature  Act  provides  an  Accused  can  appeal  only  against  his  sentence  when  he"
"pleaded  guilty at the  Original  Court.  Similar to a judge giving  reasons  for conviction"
"or acquittal, he  must give reasons  for the sentence."
"It 
is  observed 
the  Accused-Respondent  had  pleaded  guilty 
to  all 
four  counts."
"Therefore Section  14(b) (1)  of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 is to be considered."
