"Thus, 
it  is  clear 
that  the  Provincial  High  Court  has  decided 
to"
"exercise its revisionary jurisdiction over the order of eviction on these two"
"grounds."
"There  is  no  dispute  that  the  land  described  in  the  schedule  to  the"
"application filed  by  the  Petitioner before  the Magistrate's Court is  a  State"
"land.  It is also not disputed that Sarachchandra  was issued with a permit in"
"relation 
to 
the  said  State 
land  with  certain  conditions  attached.  The"
"Respondent has  received  the quit notice  issued  by  the  Petitioner and has"
"replied  to  it through  his  Attorney  (X7).  In the  said  reply  the  Respondent"
"informed that Sarachchandra is the licensee for the said land and if any legal"
"action is contemplated, it should be instituted against the said licensee."
"In view of these factors,  it is evident that at the time of the service of"
"quit notice,  it was the Respondent who was in possession of the said State"
"land. It is  also  evident that the Respondent had no ""valid permit or other"
"written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law"""
"to  be  in  possession  of  the  said  State  land.  His  claim  is  that  he  came  into"
"possession  with  the 
leave  and  licence  of  Sarachchandra  who  had  been"
"issued  with a  permit for  the said State  land and resided  elsewhere when"
"the quit notice was served."
"Therefore, 
the 
Respondent 
is 
clearly 
a 
person  who 
is 
in"
"unauthorized possession or occupation of State land."
"Section 3(1)  of the  Act imposes a  duty  on the  Petitioner  to  provide"
"for  a  period not less  than 30  days from  the  date on which the quit notice"
"was issued to comply with it.  The quit notice is  dated 23.08.2011  and  the"
"Respondent  was  directed 
to  handover  vacant  possession  on  or  before"
"6"
