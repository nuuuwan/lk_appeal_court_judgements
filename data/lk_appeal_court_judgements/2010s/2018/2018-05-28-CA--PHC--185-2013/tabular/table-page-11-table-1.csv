"The  judgment  of 
the  Supreme  Court  of  S.c.  Appeal  No.  138/96"
"S.C.M.  26.02.1999, 
relied  upon by the Provincial High Court to  revise  the"
"order of eviction, was made in an application for a prerogative writ.  In that"
"matter,  an application was made before  the  apex Court to  quash the  quit"
"notice  issued  on  the  applicant,  in  spite  of  making  several  payments.  The"
"Supreme Court has quashed the impugned quit notice on the basis that the"
"competent authority has accepted payment for several years as rent for the"
"disputed  portion  of  the  State  land  by  considering  that  the  payment  and"
"acceptance  of 
rentals, 
it  cannot  be 
said 
that 
the 
appellants 
are 
in"
"""unauthorized  possession  or  occupation""  and  therefore  the  quit  notices  are"
"""ultra vires,  invalid and void in law""."
"It is  unfortunate  that the  Provincial  High  Court  did  not  appreciate"
"that the  matter pending before  it was a  revision of  proceedings  instituted"
"under the Section 5(1)  whereas  the judgment of  the Supreme Court dealt"
"with the validity of the quit notice in an application for a prerogative writ."
"It  is  our  considered  view  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court to the revision application"
"before him."
