"30.09.2011.  The  Petitioner  has 
thereafter 
filed 
his 
application 
in 
the"
"Magistrate's Court of Teldeniya on 18.11.2011."
"The Respondent did  not at any  point of  time challenge  the validity"
"of the said quit notice served on him and sought remedies available under"
"this  Court, 
public  law.  In  Dayananda  v  Thalwatte(2001)  2  Sri  L.R.  73,"
"having  observed  that  ""  an  aggrieved  person  who 
is  seeking 
to  set  aside  an"
"unfavourable  decision  made  against  him  by  a public  authority  could  apply for  a"
"prerogative  writ  of certiorari  and  if the  application  is 
to  compel  an  authority  to"
"perform a duty he  would ask for  a writ of mandamus and similarly if an  authority"
"is 
to  be  prevented from  exceeding  its  jurisdiction  the  remedy  of prohibition  was"
"available""  proceeded thereafter to  hold that ""institution  of proceedings  in  the"
"Magistrates  Court 
in 
terms  of the  quit  notice  is  not  a determination  affecting"
"legal  rights.""  It further held that ""it was  open for  the  Petitioner  to  seek  to  quash"
"the  quit  notice  by  way  of certiorari  when 
the  determination  was  made 
...  or  to"
"move in revision at the  conclusions of the Magistrate's findings""."
"Thus,  it  is  seen  that  the  selection  of  the  best  remedy  from  these"
"options had to  be made by the Respondent at the appropriate juncture and"
"the  Courts  would  employ  different  considerations  in  evaluating  claims"
"under these separate legal remedies. The considerations that might assume"
"importance in an application for  the issuance of a  prerogative writ, might"
"not be  useful  in an application  made  for  a  discretionary  remedy  such  as"
"revision.  The  Provincial  High  Court has  fallen  into  error  in  its  failure  to"
"appreciate 
this 
inherent 
distinction 
between 
the 
two 
distinct 
legal"
"remedies."
