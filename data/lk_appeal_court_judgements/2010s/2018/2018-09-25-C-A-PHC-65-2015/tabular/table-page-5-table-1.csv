"Plain reading of this section,  it becomes  clear to  the  reader  that the"
"Court  could 
form 
an 
"" opinion"",  having 
regard 
to 
the  manner 
the"
"unauthorised  occupier  entered  the  premises  and  it would  be ""unjust""  to"
"order his  ejectment therefrom,  it may require such person and  NHDA  to"
"enter into an agreement."
"Upon  perusal  of  the  order  made  by  the  Magistrate's  Court,  it  is"

this  Court  is  whether 
the"
"Magistrate's Court had exercised its discretion reasonably."
"There  was  no  challenge  to  the  fact  that  the  premises  belonged  to"
"NHDA  and  the  Appellant had no  legally  valid  written authority  to  be  in"
"the possession of the said premises."
"He has relied  on his  23  years  of  occupation, and  pleaded  that he is"
"entitle to relief under Section 69E(8) of NHD A Act."
"In  refusing 
to  exercise 
the  discretion  vested 
in 
the  Magistrate's"
"Court,  it  had  considered  the  facts 
that  there  had  been  a  matter  under"
"""Section 66""  of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, for breach of peace and"
"the Appellant was placed in possession by the Primary Court."
"According 
to 
the  Respondent,  both  Thushari  Perera  and  Sanjeewa"
"Perera claimed that the Appellant had entered the disputed premises, in the"
"pretext of assisting the permit holder and his unmarried sister in their last"
"stages  of

to  occupy 
the  premises  without  any 
lawful"
"they  were  minors  and
