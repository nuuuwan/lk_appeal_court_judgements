"extraordinary 
relief  by  way  of  Revision  or  Restitutio 
in"
"Integrum."
"This is good law and stands to reason."
"In  Kusumawathie  v.  Wijesinghe2  and  Paulis  v.  Joseph3—the  two"
"cases strongly relied upon by counsel for the petitioner—the above"
"mentioned  approach  could  not  be  adopted  as  the  husbands  by"
"whom ex parte judgments had been obtained were dead when the"
"revision  and/or  restitutio  in  integrum  applications  seeking  to  set"
"aside ex parte decrees were filed before this Court.  This clear from"
"the following observation of Justice Jayasinghe at page 245 of the"
"former case: ""I do not see any purpose of sending back the case for"
"inquiry/re-trial  as 
the  Plaintiff 
is  dead.  Hence  on 
the  material"
"tendered to this Court I am satisfied that the decree for divorce had"
"been  obtained  without  the  knowledge  or  notice  to  the  Defendant-"
"Petitioner.""; and the following observation of Justice Imam at page"
"167 in the latter case: ""Although the position of the 1st Respondent"
"is that the Petitioner should have gone to the District Court as it has"
"original 
jurisdiction  and  where  a  due 
inquiry  would  be  held."
"However 
there 
is  no  merit 
in 
this  submission,  as 
the  Plaintiff"
"(Petitioner's  husband)  is  now  dead  and  she  obviously  cannot  go  to"
"the District Court.""  In contrast, in the instant case both parties are"
"alive.  Hence those two cases are clearly distinguishable."
