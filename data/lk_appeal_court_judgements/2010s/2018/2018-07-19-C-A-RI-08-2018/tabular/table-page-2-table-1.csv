"The  defendant-petitioner 
filed 
this  application 
for 
restitutio 
in"
"integrum  and  revision  seeking  to  set  aside  the  judgment,  decree"
"nisi and decree absolute entered against her by the District Court"
"of  Kurunagala  in  case  No.  5906/D  in  the  year  2002  on  the  basis"
"that the plaintiff-respondent-her husband has obtained the divorce"
"judgment ex parte by fraud without serving summons on her."

integrum  on"
"summons  on  being  pointed  out  without  verification  by  affidavit  of"
"the  person  pointing  out,  (b)  false  pleadings  and  evidence  and  (c)"
"getting  an  imposter  to  be  present  in  Court  in  response  to  alleged"
"service of notice of decree nisi. Upholding the preliminary objection"
"and  dismissing 
the  application 
in 
limine  Justice  Siva  Selliah"
"reviving the earlier authorities held:"
