"In  Corea  vs.  Appuhamy  (1911)  15  NLR  65  the  Privy  Council"
"held 
that 
the 
possession 
of 
a 
co-owner  was 
in 
law, 
the"
"posseSSIOn  of  the  other  co-owners  and 
thus,  not  adverse 
to"
"them.  In  other  words  even  if  one  co-owner's  possession  of  the"
"common property or part thereof was of a  character incompatible"
"with  the  title  or  the  other  co-owners,  yet  that  co-owner  possess"
"the  common  property  on  behalf  of  all  co-owners. 
It  was  not"
"possible  for  him  to  put  an  end  to  the  possession  by  any  secret"
"intention 
in  his  mind,  nothing  short  of  ouster,  or  something"
"equivalent to ouster could bring about this result."
