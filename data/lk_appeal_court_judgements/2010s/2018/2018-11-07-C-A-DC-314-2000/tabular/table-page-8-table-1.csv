"T
he ratio in Jayasekera v. Lakmini (supra) has consistently been"
"followed by later Supreme Court Judgements."
"In  Wilson  v.  Kusumawathi 
[2015]  BLR  49,  Justice  Sisira  de"
"Abrew 
(with  Justice  Marsoof  and  Justice  Sarath  de  Abrew"
"agreeing), citing  with approval  Jayasekera v. Lakmini, held that"
"failure  to  name  all  the  parties  in  the  Petition  of  Appeal  is  a"
"curable  defect  in  terms  of  section  759  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code,  so  long  as  no  material  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the"
"respondents."
"In Premaratna v. Sunil Pathirana (SC Appeal 49/2012 decided on"
"27.03.2015),  Justice  Wanasundera  (with  Justice  Aluwihare  and"
"Justice  Abeyratne  concurring),  citing  inter  alia  Jayasekera  v."
"Lakmini, held that:"
"“The Petition of Appeal had not contained in the caption, the name"
"of  the  substituted  parties.  I  feel  that,  the  mere  fact  that  only  the"
"name of the dead person was mentioned in the caption, cannot be"
"held  against  the  party  seeking  relief  from  Court.  It  is  a  lapse  on"
"the  part  of  the  petitioner’s  Attorney-at-Law.  The  litigant  who  has"
"come before Court for relief should not be deprived of his right to"
"seek relief due to a lapse on the part of the lawyers preparing and"
"filing  the papers.  In  the case  in hand,  the dead person has been"
"substituted  promptly  in  the  District  Court  and  named  as  1A  and"
"1B defendants. It is only a lapse of not writing down the caption"
"properly. I am of the view that this is a matter which should have"
"been  corrected  by 
the  High  Court  Judges  as  provided 
for 
in"
"section 759(1) and (2). It is not an incorrigible defect, good enough"
"for rejecting the Petition of Appeal.”"
