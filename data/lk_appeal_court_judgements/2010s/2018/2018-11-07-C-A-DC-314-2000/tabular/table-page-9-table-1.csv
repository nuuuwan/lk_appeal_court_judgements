"the Supreme Court in Jeyaraj Fernandopulle v. Premachandra de"
"Silva [1996] 1 Sri LR 70  where it has been held that: “The court"
"will

its  own  motion 
if"
"necessary, a judgment entered against a person who was in fact"
"dead  or  a  non-existent  company  or,  in  certain  circumstances,  a"
"judgment in default or a consent judgment. Where there has been"
"some procedural  irregularity  in  the proceedings leading up  to  the"
"judgment or order  which is so serious that the judgment or order"
"ought to be treated as a nullity, the Court will set it aside.”  I am"
