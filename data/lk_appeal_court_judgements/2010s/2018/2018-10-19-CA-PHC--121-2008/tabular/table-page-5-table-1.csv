"","if such  petition  of appeal  is  not presented  within  sixty  days  from  the  order appealed  against,"
"","the court shall refuse to receive it."
"","There  is  some  merit  in  this  submission.  The  time  limit  given  by  Rule  2(1)  is  fourteen  days"
"","whereas in  Rule  12(2) it is sixty days.  Rule  3(2) appears to consider the short time frame under"
"","Rule 2(1) and  seeks to give an  extended time where the time for preferring a petition of appeal"
"","expires  on  a day on  which  the  office  of the court  is  closed.  Such  a consideration  is  not there"
"","under Rule  12(2) as  the period  within which  the  petition of appeal  must be  presented  is  sixty"
"","days from the order appealed against."
"","However, the learned State Counsel for the Appellant responded by submitting that in counting"
"","the days between 28.05.2008 and 28.07.2008, the date of the judgment has to be excluded so"
"","that the 60th day falls on 27.07.2008 which is a Sunday and appeal papers cannot be filed in the"
"","Court registry.  He  further submitted that if the  day  of the judgment is  counted  then the 60th"
"","day falls on  26.07.2008 which is a Saturday on  which day Courts do not function. Therefore, he"
"","submitted that the Appellant can utilise 28.07.2008 a Monday as the 60th day. The learned State"
"","Counsel  submitted that any other interpretation would  result in  the Appellant  been  deprived"
"","of two working  days  which  he  is  entitled  pursuant to Rule  12(2)  of the  1988 Rules  read  with"
"","Section 8(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance which reads:"

"","a court or office, and the last day of the limited time is a day on which the court or office"
"","is closed, then the act or proceeding shall  be  considered as  done or taken in due time if"
"","it is  done or taken on the next day thereafter on which the court or office is open."""

"","on Monday, the 61st day, as the 60th  day fell on Sunday, a public holiday. It was contended that,"
"","the appeal is out of time. It was held that the provisions of s.  8 (1)  Interpretation Ordinance do"
