"within  the  meaning  of section  107(1).  Subordinate  legislation,  even  where  authorised by the"
"Constitution,  cannot prevail over (and thereby amend) the Constitution,  unless the Constitution"
"clearly authorises such a result.  Similarly,  Rules  made  under Article  136(1) of the Constitution"
"cannot  override  the  provisions  of the  Interpretation  Ordinance.  Hence  section  8(1)  of the"
"Interpretation Ordinance will  apply in  the instant case  where the last day of filing the petition"
"of appeal was  a day on  which the court or office is  closed  and therefore the petition of appeal"
"was validly filed on the next day thereafter on  which the court or office was open."
"Accordingly,  I  reject  the  second  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  learned  counsel  for the"
"Respondent."
"For the foregoing reasons I uphold the first preliminary objection raised by the learned counsel"
"for the Respondent and dismiss the appeal with costs."
