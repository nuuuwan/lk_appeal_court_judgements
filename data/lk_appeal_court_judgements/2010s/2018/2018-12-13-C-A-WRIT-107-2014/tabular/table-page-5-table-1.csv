"It  is  clear  that  a  workman  had  to  work  for  a  minimum  period  of  12"
"months according to Section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of Employment of"
"the  Workmen  (Special  Provisions  Act)  No.  45  of  1971  and  after

"amended  by  Section  3  of  the  amendment  No-  51  of  1988  the  minimum"
