"In 
Justice 
Jana 
Shakthi 
Insurance 
v. 
Dasanayake14"
"Wimalachandra stated: “It is settled law that a party affected by"
"an  order  of  which  he  had  no  notice  must  apply 
in 
the 
first"
"instance  to  the  Court  which  made  the  order.  The  petitioner  must"
"first file the necessary papers in the original Court and initiate an"
"inquiry into the allegations made by him. After such inquiry, if the"
"petitioner is dissatisfied with the order made by the District Court,"
"he can thereafter raise the matter before the Court of Appeal. The"
"Court of Appeal then  would be in a position to  make an  order on"
"the  issues  after  taking  into  consideration  the  order  made  by  the"
"In 
also 
Justice 
District 
Court.” 
Penchi 
v. 
Sirisena15"
"Wimalachandra took the same view."
"This  dispute  seems  to  be  between  1A  defendant  on  the  one"
"hand, and the 14th and 15th defendants on the other.  That is a"
"different  dispute,  which  has  no  relevance  to  the  application  of"
"the 17th defendant-petitioner."
"Subject to making any application before the District Court, if so"
"advised, 
the  application  of 
the  1A  defendant 
is  dismissed"
"without costs."
