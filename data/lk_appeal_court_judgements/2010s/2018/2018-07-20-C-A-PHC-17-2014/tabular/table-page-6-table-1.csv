"Rule  12(2) of the Rules  requires the appellant to present a petition of appeal to the High  Court."
"Rule  12(3) of the Rules  requires the High  Court to forward the petition of appeal  together with"
"all the papers and proceedings as speedily as  possible to the Court of Appeal. The High Court has"
"not been empowered to perform any other act.  In these circumstances, I am  of the opinion that"
"the High Court becomes functus after performing the only task it has been directed to do, namely"
"forwarding the  petition  of appeal  together with  all  the  papers  and  proceedings  as  speedily as"
"possible to the Court of Appeal."
"The question then is whether the Court of Appeal has been granted the jurisdiction to permit the"
"withdrawal of a petition of appeal and filing of a new petition of appeal. I will discuss this aspect"
"with question (b) referred to above."
"New Petition of Appeal"
"Rule  13  of the  Rules  requires  the  Registrar  of the  Court  of Appeal  to forthwith  number  the"
"petition received from the High Court."
"Rule 15(1) of the Rules states that if the petition of appeal is not drawn up in the manner in the"
"last preceding rule prescribed it may be rejected or be returned to the appellant for the purpose"
"of being amended within a time to be fixed by the court or be amended then and there. When"
"the  court  rejects  under  this  rule  any  Petition  of Appeal,  it  shall  record  the  reasons  for  such"
"rejection. And  when any Petition of Appeal is amended under this rule the Judge, or such officer"
"as  he shall appoint in that behalf, shall attest the amendment by his signature."
"In some  of the other rules formulated to regulate the procedure in the Supreme Court and the"
"Court of Appeal, there is specific provision regulating withdrawal of applications such as Rules 15"
"and  32  of the  Supreme  Court  Rules  1990  while  Rule  3(8)  of the  Court  of Appeal  (Appellate"
"Procedure)  Rules  1990  only  refers  to  amendment  of pleadings  or filing  additional  pleadings."
"However, Rule  15 of the Rules  is the only Rule in the Rules that refer to rejection or amendment"
"of the petition of appeal."
