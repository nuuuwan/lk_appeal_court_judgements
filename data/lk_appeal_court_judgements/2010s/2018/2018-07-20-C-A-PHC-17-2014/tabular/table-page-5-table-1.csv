"(5)  When  the  petition  of appeal  dated  05.03.2014  was  filed  the  learned  High  Court Judge"
"made order to file the petition of appeal dated 05.03.2014 and to record the filing of the"
"petition in the Appeals Register and to maintain a sub file and transmit the original record"
"to this Court."
"(6)  Thereafter,  when the motion dated 10.03.2014 was  filed, the learned  High  Court Judge"
"made order directing to file the said  motion and petition of appeal dated 10.03.2014."
"The  preliminary  objections  raised  on  behalf  of the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  was  somewhat"
"premature  as  the  Appellant  did  not seek  to  support  the  motion  dated  10.03.2014  when  the"
"matter was  taken  up  for argument  on  01.02.2018.  However,  the  Appellant  has  in  his  written"
"submissions  sought  permission  of Court  to  permit  the  application  of the  Appellant  set  out  in"
"motion  dated  10.03.2014.  In 
these  circumstances,  we  are  called  upon  to  make  a  ruling  on"
"application made in the motion dated 10.03.2014."
"The questions that arise for determination are:"
"(a)  Whether the applicable rules provide for the withdrawal of a petition of appeal and filing"
"of a new petition of appeal"
"(b) 
If so, which is the Court that has jurisdiction to allow such an  application"
"I propose to answer question (b) first and then address question (a)."
"High Court is Functus"
"There is no dispute that the applicable rules are the Court of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from"
"High Courts) Rules  of 1988 (Rules)."
"Rule 11(2) of the Rules provides for an  appeal to be made to the Court of Appeal by giving notice"
"of appeal to the High  Court within such  time and  in form and  manner as  provided thereinafter."
"Rule  11(3) of the  Rules  requires the  notice of appeal  to be  presented by the  party appellant or"
"his registered attorney within a period of fourteen days from the order appealed against."
