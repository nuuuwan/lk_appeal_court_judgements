"Plaintiff's  action  as  presently  constituted  should  therefore  be  dismissed

"I am ofthe view that the same reasoning applies to the instant case. The Appellant came to court"
"seeking  a declaration that  he  is  the tenant  and  sought  eviction  and  grant of possession  on  the"

"Thereafter  it  is  not open  for him  to  plead  that  his  action  was  a possessory  action  and  that  he"
"should  be granted relief on  that basis."
"Rules  of natural justice that have  been  woven  into our civil  procedural  rules  gives  a defendant"
