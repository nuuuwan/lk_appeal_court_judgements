"premises in  the  Trustees in  the  manner aforesaid as shall are may be"
"reasonably required"" (See:  para 3 in page 4 of Deed No. 288)"
"Therefore,  as  pointed  out  above,  both  the  Wakfs  Board  and  Wakf Tribunal  had"
"followed  their correct  procedure  in  making  appointment  of 13  new  Trustees  and"
"dismissing  the  Appellants'  appeal.  Thus,  there  is  no  merit  in  this  appeal  and  the"
"appellants are not entitled in  law to seek any reliefs as prayed for their petition."
"Therefore,  I affirm  the  Wakf Tribunal's  judgment dated  15.07.2017  and  dismiss"
"this appeal without Costs."
"Appeal dismissed."
