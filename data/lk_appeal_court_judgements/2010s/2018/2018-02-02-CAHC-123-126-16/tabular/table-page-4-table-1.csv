"We find  that the learned High Court Judge was  not mindful of the"
"said  provision  and  the  procedure  to  follow  in  recording  evidence  in  a"
"criminal trial. Although the learned counsel for the appellants did not bring"
"this irregularity to our notice we wish  to place on  record that this type of"
"conduct  by  a  High  Court  Judge  can  not  be  condoned.  The  second"
"appellant was not given a fair trial."
