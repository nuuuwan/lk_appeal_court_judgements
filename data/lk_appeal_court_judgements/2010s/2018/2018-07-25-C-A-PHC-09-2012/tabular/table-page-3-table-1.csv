"When the quit notice was issued on the Appellant, he sought a  Writ"
"of Certiorari from  the Provincial  High Court holden in Anuradhapura to"
"quash 
the  said  notice.  The  Provincial  High  Court,  by  its  order  dated"
"invoke 
29.02.2012,  refused  the  Appellant's  application  and  he  seeks  to"
"appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set it aside."
"The Appellant, in seeking to  quash the quit notice, sought a  Writ of"
"Certiorari  on  the  basis  that he  is  not  an  employee  of the  1st  Respondent"
"therefore 
since  01.11.1984  and 
the  2nd  Respondent  could  only  claim"
"possession through a civil action instituted under the Rent Act."
"In 
refusing 
relief 
to 
the  Appellant, 
the  Provincial  High  Court"
"considered  primarily that he is  not entj tIed  for  a  Writ of Certiorari  as he"
"claims  relief  under a  contract.  The Provincial High Court opted  to  follow"
"the reasoning of the judgments of Perera  v NHDA (2001) 3 Sri L.R. 50, Podi"
"Nona  v  Municipal  Council,  Horana  (1980)  2 Sri  L.R.  141  and Jayaratne  v"
"Wijesekere(1985) 2 Sri L.R. 413."
"The Appellant, in support of his appeal submitted to this Court that"
"the quit notice was issued unlawfully as the parties are bound by the terms"
"of  the  agreement  and  therefore  the  Provincial  High  Court  should  have"
"issued the Writ."
"In  view  of  this  submission, 
it  is  necessary 
to  consider 
the  said"
"agreement of tenancy and the applicable provisions of the Local Authority"
"Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law."
"the  clause  6  of 
the  agreement  of  rent  dated 
As  already  noted"
"10.10.1986,  has  reserved  the  Respondents'  right  to  recover  possession  of"
"3"
