"It  has  been  held  in  the  unreported  Judgment  of  this  Court  in"
"Bandara v. Hemalatha Kularatne12 that a party to a partition action"
"who had no soil rights to the land to be partitioned (in that case a"
"tenant) “has no legal right to intervene in and canvass the scheme of"
"partition.”"
"In  Hamidu  v.  Gunasekera13  it  was  held  that  ""A  person  entitled"
"merely to an interest in a building on a land  which  has become the"
"subject  of  a  partition  action  can  only  obtain  compensation  for  the"
"interest in the building, and cannot get any share of the land in the"
"partition."""
"In  the  instant  action,  the  9th  defendant  who  does  not  have  soil"
"rights is not interested in compensation at all. His only plea before"
"this Court is to allot the portion of land where the house No. 19 is"
"situated to the 7th defendant.  His application is legally untenable."
"In any event, the 9th defendant is not entitled to compensation for"
"improvements made after the Interlocutory Decree.  As was held in"
"Podi  Appuhamy  v.  Danial  Appuhamy14  ""Where  interlocutory  decree"
"has  been  entered  in  a  partition  action,  a  party  to  the  decree  is  not"
"entitled  to  claim  as  against  the  other  parties  the  ownership  of,  or"
"compensation 
for, 
improvements  made  on 
the  common  property"
"subsequent to the date of the interlocutory decree."" I must add that"
"when  the 
Interlocutory  Decree 
is  entered 
is 
irrelevant  as  “the"
"entering 
of 
the  decree 
is 
a 
purely  ministerial 
act

"Interlocutory  Decree  when  entered 
relates  back
