"After the Judgment in the partition action was pronounced and the"
"Interlocutory  Decree  was  entered,  upon  the  9th  defendant  making"
"constructions  on  the  land,  the  plaintiff  has  filed  a  separate  case"
"No.  L/3912  against  the  9th  defendant. 
 
In  that  case,  the  9th"
"defendant has expressly agreed not to claim any compensation for"
"any constructions made after the partition Judgment.16 In view of"
"the  aforesaid  settlement  entered  in  the  said  case  No.  L/3912  and"
"also the proceedings of the District Court in the partition action,17"
"it  is  clear  that  the  9th  defendant  has  made  some  constructions  or"
"substantial 
improvements 
to  house  No.  19  after 
the  partition"
"Judgment.  The 9th defendant is not entitled to have compensation"
"for those improvements."
"It is true that house No. 19 was there when the preliminary survey"
"was  done  as 
is  seen 
from  the  Preliminary  Plan. 
  However  no"
"evidence has been led by the 9th defendant at the scheme inquiry"
"to  establish  that  what  was  in  existence  at  the  stage  of  scheme"
"inquiry  was  the  same  house  as  depicted  in  the  Preliminary  Plan"
"without any substantial alterations or improvements.  There is no"
"way  to  distinguish 
improvements  made  prior  to  and  after  the"
"Interlocutory Decree.   Hence the direction of the  District Judge  to"
"the surveyor in the order dated 18.05.1999 not to assess building"
"No.  19  for  the  purpose  of  payment  of  compensation  to  the  9th"
"defendant, 
in 
the 
facts  and 
circumstances 
of 
this 
case, 
is"
"justifiable."
"Taking  all  the  circumstances  into  account  I  see  no  merit  in  this"
"appeal.  Appeal is dismissed but without costs."
