"This an application in revision made against the order ofthe learned High Court Judge of Puttalam"
"dated 12.07.2016."
"This  matter arises  out of an  information filed  by the Officer-in-Charge of the Saliyawewa  Police"
"under  section  66(1)(a}  of  the  Primary  Courts  Procedure  Act  (Act). 
Information  was 
filed  on"
"25.11.2014. The  parties were permitted to file affidavits, counter affidavits and  documents. The"
"that  he  was 
in  possession  of  the  land 
in 
pt  Party-Petitioner-Petitioner  (Petitioner)  claimed"
"dispute from  17.03.2010 whereas the 2nd  Party-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent)  claimed"
"that he was  in  possession of the land in  dispute for about 20 years."
"The  parties admitted that the land  in  dispute is  depicted as  ""Gil  in the sketch filed by the Police."
"(Journal  Entry dated 25.11.2014)."
"The  learned  Magistrate held that the Respondent  had  established  that he  was  in  possession  of"
"the  land  in  dispute  on  the  date that information was  filed  and  that the  Petitioner had  failed  to"
"establish  the  exact  day  on  which  he  was  evicted  from  the  land  in  dispute  by  the  Respondent."
"Accordingly,  he held that the Respondent was entitled to possession of the land in  dispute."
"The Petitioner moved in revision to the High Court against the said order. The  learned High Court"
"Judge  by  his  order  dated  12.07.2016  dismissed 
the  said  application  on 
the  basis 
that  the"
"Petitioner had failed to establish exceptional circumstances as  well as  him having an  alternative"
"remedy.  Hence this application in  revision."
"One of the main arguments of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that the land in dispute is"
"not properly identified. He submitted that whereas the land claimed by the Petitioner is identified"
"as  Dangaha  Kumbura  the  Respondents  claimed  a  portion  of  land  called  Thambigewela.  The"
"learned  counsel  for the  Petitioner  relied  on  Punchi  Nona  v.  Padumasena  and others  [(1994}2"
"SrLL.R.  117]. However, as  pointed out earlier, parties in the Magistrates Court admitted that the"
"""Gil 
land 
in  dispute 
is  depicted  as 
in 
the  sketch 
filed  by 
the  Police. 
(Journal  Entry  dated"
"25.11.2014)."
