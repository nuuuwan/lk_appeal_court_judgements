"questions of law but admissions on questions offact cannot be withdrawn [Uvais v.  Punyawathie"
"(1993)  2  SrLL.R.  46].  However,  in  Sivaratnam  and others  v.  Dissanayake  and others  [(2004)  1"
"SrLL.R.  144 at 148] Amaratunga J.  sought to explain the principle as follows:"
"""The  decision  in  Uvais  v Punyawathie  (supra)  is  authority for the  proposition that a fact"
"specifically admitted at the trial  and  relied  on  by the opposite  party in  deciding how he"
"should present his case cannot be withdrawn or departed from at the stage of the appeal."
"See also Mariammai v.  Pethurupillal. Fernando, J.'s judgment in Uvais's case makes it very"
"clear that what is not permitted is the withdrawal of an admission in circumstances where"
"such  withdrawal  has  the  effect  of  subverting  the  fundamental  principles  of the  Civil"
