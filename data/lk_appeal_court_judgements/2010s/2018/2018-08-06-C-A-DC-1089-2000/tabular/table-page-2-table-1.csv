"Samayawardhena, J."
"The  defendant-appellant  filed  this  appeal  against  the  order  of  the"
"learned  District  Judge  of  Polonnaruwa  dated  07.11.2000  whereby"
"the  application  of  the  defendant  to  vacate  the  ex  parte  Judgment"
"entered in favour of the plaintiff-respondent was refused."
"The plaintiff filed the action against the defendant seeking recovery"
"of a sum of Rs. 120,000/= and the case has been taken up for ex"
"parte trial as both the defendant and his lawyer were absent on the"
"trial date."
"At  the  inquiry  before  the  District  Court  into  purging  default,  the"
"defendant has first given evidence to say that he was ill on the said"
"trial date, and to substantiate it has produced a medical certificate"
"V1,  which  was  marked  subject  to  proof.    His  illness  on  the  trial"
"date was said to be vomiting, fever and diarrhoea."
"If  he  were  ill  on  the  trial  date,  as  any  prudent  man  would  do,  he"
"would have taken steps to inform it to his lawyer over the phone or"
"by any other means for the lawyer to represent him in Court.  This"
"has not been done.  His physical presence on the trial dates is not"
"required if he was represented by his lawyer."
"On  the  other  hand,  if  he  were  ill  on  the  trial  date  and  obtained"
"treatment  from  a  doctor,  he  would  have  told  it  to  the  doctor  and"
"obtained  the  medical  certificate  on  that  day  itself.    This  has  not"
"been done."
"If  he  had  at  least  met  the  lawyer  soon  after  the  trial  date,  which"
"any prudent man would have done, the lawyer would have advised"
"him  to  immediately  obtain  a  medical  certificate  from  the  doctor"
