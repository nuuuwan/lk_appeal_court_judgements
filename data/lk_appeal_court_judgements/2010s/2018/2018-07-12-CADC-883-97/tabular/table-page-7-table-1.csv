"The Plaintiff while giving evidence has admitted that she went on a Deega  marriage"
"to Mathawa, the village of her husband  but she  has stated that she  returned to her"
"paternal house after 3 days and  stayed there for 3 to 4 years with her husband on"
"the  request  of  her  parents  as 
they  wanted  one 
to  attend  on 
them-(vide  her"
"evidence at page 55 and 56 of the brief). Thereafter her father executed  a deed in"
"favour of her giving certain lands belonging to him. She has further stated that she"
"still lives there in  a land given  by her father and  her husband too lived there till he"
"died.  The  deed  marked  as  P2  also  confirms  that  her  father  bequeathed  several"
"lands to her.  The  Plaintiff has  also said  that the paddy land  in  the 3rd  schedule to"
"the plaint, though no deed was written in her favour was given to her by her father"
"in  1948 and  she  has  been  in  possession  of the same  from that date-(vide page  57"
"of the brief.)  The  Plaintiff's stance  is that though  she  went on  Deega,  her parents"
"did not allow her to leave the paternal house- (vide page 57 of the brief).  Even  the"
"Defendant  during  cross  examination  has  answered 
that  the  Plaintiff  lived 
in"
"Kollongalla,  he  father's  village  since  the  time  he  could  remember. 
He  has  not"
"denied the fact that their parents asked the Plaintiff to stay in the Mulgedara after"
"a few days  of her Deega  marriage  and  that her farther bequeathed  certain  lands"
"belonging to him to the Plaintiff.  These facts on a preponderance of evidence show"
"that  the  Plaintiff,  though  she  went  on  a  Deega  marriage  as  per  her  marriage"
"certificate,  returned  to  Mulgedara  and  thereafter she  continued  to  live  with  her"
"husband  in  the land given to her by her father.  Even  her father during his  life time"
"had  bequeathed  his  properties to  her.  These  facts  indicate  the  cessation  of the"
"severance from father's  family as  well as  the waiver of her forfeiture to paternal"
"property by  her father himself.  Therefore,  on  a preponderance  of evidence  one"
"can  come  to the conclusion that the  Plaintiff has  re-acquired  her Binna  rights. 
In"
"such  a backdrop  I am  not inclined to hold that the final  conclusion  of the  learned"
"District Judge is  perverse or not supported by the facts that emerged in this case."
"On the other hand, has the Plaintiff not re-acquired her Binna  rights, the defendant"
