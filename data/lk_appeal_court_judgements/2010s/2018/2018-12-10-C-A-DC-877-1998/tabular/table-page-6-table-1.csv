"it appears  that the  learned  District Judge  in  his  Judgment  has  considered  the"
"said  birth Certificate.  He  has  stated that in  the 2nd  cage  of the form, the name"
"is  mentioned  as  Missi  Nona  and  the  name  'Dayani  Matilda Jayawickrama'  has"
"been  inserted on  a later occasion. The  learned  District Judge  has further stated"
"that if there  is  a name change,  it has to be  mentioned  in  cage  12,  but the cage"
"12 of P7  is  left blank. 
It is  brought to the notice of this court that the over leaf"
"of P7  contains the necessary details with regard  to the name change  even  with"
"reference  to the  number  of the  District  Court  case  which  ordered  the  name"
"It is  obvious that such  details cannot be  inserted  in the 
change  of Missi  Nona."
"small  space  provided 
in  cage  12. 
The  relevant  clerk  who  attended  to  the"
"insertion  of the  amendment to  P7  has  not made  a cross  reference  in  cage  12,"
"but it is  not a fault of the  Plaintiff for him to be  penalized. 
It is  my considered"
"view  that  P7 
is  substantially  in  the  form  and  purports  to  be  executed  in  the"
"manner directed  by  law  in  that behalf.The  learned  District Judge  should  have"
"presumed  the truth of P7  in  favour of the  Plaintiff.  Furthermore, the  Plaintiff"
"himself  had  stated  while  giving  evidence  that  he  knew  aforesaid  Missi  nona"
"alias  Dayani  Jayawickrama  as  the  daughter  of said  Sudirikku  Hannadige  Podi"
"Singho  (vide  page  136 and  137 of the  brief).  The  1st  Defendant has  not given"
"It  is  clear  from  the 
any  evidence  to  refute  this  contention  of the  Plaintiff."
"evidence of the representative of the 2nd  Defendant that he  knew nothing with"
"regard  to the pedigree other than accepting the deeds that gave  title to the  pt"
"Defendant."
"For  the  foregoing  reasons,  it  is  my  considered  view  that the  learned  District"
"Judge  should  not  have  kept 
the  1/16  share  unallotted  but  should  have"
"allocated 
it to  the  Plaintiff. 
In  fact,  during  the  argument  the  1st  Defendant"
