"In  The  King  v.  James  Chandrasekera ll the  majority of the  Court took the view  that  ((burden  of"
"proving"" in  section  105 of the Evidence Ordinance places  on  the accused the burden of proof as"
"to the  applicability of an  exception  and  he  cannot  merely adduce  evidence  or  merely create  a"
"reasonable  doubt in  the  minds  of the jury.  The  term  ((burden  of proof"", therefore  in  our  law,"
"unlike  English  law,  means the legal  burden  and  not the evidential  burden  and  the term  is  used"
"only in one sense.  But both concepts are relevant to our law and  a party may have to accept the"
"burden in both senses in order to succeed, unless the evidence led by the other side might prove"
