"In  Tillekeratne  et al.  v Bastian  et al. 15  a bench  of three Judges  decided  that  it was  open  to the"
"Court,  from  lapse  of time in  conjunction  with the  other circumstances  of the case,  to presume"
"that a possession  originally that of a co-owner  had  since  become  adverse.  The  same  principle"
"applies to licensees.  The  learned  District Judge further held that the 8th  to 10th  Defendants had"
"acquired  prescriptive title to the corpus  by  long and  undisturbed  possession  by the application"

In  doing  so,  he

I  am  unable

the  other  circumstances  of  the  case.  For  example,  where
