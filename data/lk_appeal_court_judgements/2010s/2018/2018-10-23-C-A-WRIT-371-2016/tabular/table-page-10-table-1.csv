"on  this  matter  which  confirms  that  the  Post  Graduate  Diploma"
"in  Education  cannot  be  considered  as  a  qualification  in  the"
"relevant field.  Firstly, if 1R1 was the clarification to “in the field”"
"in P8, there was no necessity to have another clarification for the"
"second time.  Secondly, 1R2, like P11, speaks of “in the relevant"
"in 
field”,  but  does  not  say  that  the  Post  Graduate  Diploma"
"Education  shall  not  be  considered  as  a  qualification 
in  the"
"relevant  field.    Thirdly,  in  any  event,  1R2  has  been  obtained"
"about 9 years after P8 and about 9 months after the institution"
"of the action.  It is trite law that the rights of the parties shall be"
"decided  at  the  institution  of  the  action.    (Talagune  v.  De  Livera"

"At this juncture it is pertinent to mention that this old scheme of"

"been  replaced  with  a  new  scheme  of  promotion  effective  as  far"
"back  as 
from  01.01.2008. 
  The  new  scheme  of  promotion"
"marked P27 has  a  new set of  qualifications.  Hence the  position"
"of  the  1st  Respondent  that  if  the  application  of  the  Petitioner  is"
"allowed  “it  will  result  in  a  floodgate  situation  where  others  in  a"
"similar  situation  to  the  Petitioner  could  also  seek  to  obtain  their"

promotions  based 
on 
the  mistaken 
interpretation  of  P8”"
"unfounded.    The  orders  of  the  Court  depend  on  the  facts  and"
"circumstances 
of
