"The accused-appellant stated in his statement from dock that he took"
"the deceased  from the Katherine's  house that night. When they reached his"
"motor  cycle  which  was  parked  at  some  distance  from 
the  house, 
the"
"deceased  opted  to  come  in  his  push  cycle.  Then  the  accused-appellant"
"went away. Later he learnt from the Police that he is wanted in connection"
"of a murder."
"In  totally  rejecting  the dock  statement of the  accused-appellant,  the"
"trial Court held that he has uttered falsehood in it."
"This conclusion could not be faulted as Sunil  in his evidence clearly"
"stated  that it was he  who  was  with  Katherine  when the accused-appellant"
"entered  the  house  that  night.  The  accused-appellant  did  not  suggest  to"
"Sunil  during  his  cross  examination  that  it was  the  deceased  and  not  the"
"Sunil  who  was  there  with  Katherine.  The  witness  said  that  the  accused-"
"appellant took the deceased on his motor cycle.  This item of evidence was"
"not 
challenged.  The accused-appellant  however,  said 
in his  statement"
"from  the  dock,  that the deceased  opted the push bicycle.  These assertions"
"could clearly be termed as an afterthought by the accused- appellant. 
It is"
"further  confirmed,  when  he 
implicated  his  sister  was 
in  an 
immoral"
"relationship  with  the  deceased.  The 
trial  Court  also  observed 
that  the"
"accused-appellant  has  failed  to  offer  any  acceptable  explanation  through"
"his statement from  the dock.  The  trial  Court has  totally  rejected  his  dock"
"statement."
