"also  admitted  that he was  assaulted  by the accused-appellant for  visiting"
"his sister's house.  Thus, it is reasonable for  the trial Court to  infer that the"
"accused-appellant  was  against  any  association  with  his  sister  either  by"
"Sunil or the deceased."
"Learned  Counsel for  the accused-appellant contended  that the  trial"
"Court  has 
attributed 
a  motive 
to 
the 
accused-appellant  merely  on"
"speculation. She relied  on the judgment of Queen  v  Sathasivam 55  N.L.R."
"255 in support of his contention that speculative motive is not admissible."
"Considering  the  available  evidence  in  its  proper  context,  we  are"
"unable  to  agree  with the  submission of  the  learned  Counsel  that the  trial"
"Court attributed motive to the accused-appellant merely on speculation."
"The  accused-appellant  also 
sought 
to  challenge 
the  conclusions"
"reached  by 
the 
trial  Court  under  the  segment  termed  as  evidence 
in"
"relation  to  subsequent conduct.  The  prosecution  led  evidence  before  the"
"trial  Court  that  the  accused-appellant  was  arrested  70  days  later  whilst"
"employed as a labourer in a sand mine which was located along the banks"
"of Kelani  river in  Dompe  Police area.  There was also evidence, led through"
"the Police witnesses,  to  the effect that despite several visits to  the place of"
"residence of the accused-appellant, he was not to be found."
