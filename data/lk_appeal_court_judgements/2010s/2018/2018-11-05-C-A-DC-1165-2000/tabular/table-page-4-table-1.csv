"T
he fact that the 2nd defendant came into possession of this land"
"with  the  leave  and  licence  of  the  plaintiff’s  mother  was  never"

"In his evidence, the plaintiff says that the 2nd defendant came as"
"such in or around 1975.1  The action has been filed in 1994."
"The  plaintiff  during  the  cross-examination  has  accepted  that"
"Baby had a brother named Alwis2 who was in occupation of this"
"land even when he was born in 1950.3"
"It  is  the  position  put  forward  by  the  2nd  defendant  during  the"
"cross-examination  that  the  2nd  defendant  came  to  the  house"
"Alwis was in occupation and bought Baby’s rights by the afore-"
"mentioned Deed marked 2V14, which was denied by the plaintiff."
"As  the  learned  District  Judge  has  correctly  pointed  out  in  the"
"Judgment,  the  plaintiff  in  cross-examination  has  accepted  the"

"first Deed marked P1, it is inconsistent to accept the pedigree of"
"the  2nd  defendant.

I  understand, 
the 
learned  District  Judge  has"
"referred to the Deed P1 in the Judgment, to defeat the argument"
"of the plaintiff that Bastian is the sole original owner of the land"
"and not for any other purpose."
