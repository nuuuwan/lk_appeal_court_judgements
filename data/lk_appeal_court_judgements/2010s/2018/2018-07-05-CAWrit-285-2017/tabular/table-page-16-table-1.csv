"I am  inclined  to agree  with  the  learned  Counsel  for the  Petitioner that it is  clear  on  a plain"
"reading of Article 154F (5) that the final act of appointment as  well  as  removal  (if one  accepts"
"the argument of the learned President's Counsel  for the 1st  Respondent based on section 14 of"
"the Interpretation Ordinance) of a Minister of a Provincial  Council  must be  under the  hand  of"
"the Governor. The  position is the same even  if it is  held that the Governor has  no discretion in"
"that act and  must act on the advice of the Chief Minister.  Therefore, the question proposed by"
"the learned President's Counsel for the pt Respondent does not arise for determination on the"
"pleadings presently constituted in this application."
