"Primary Court in  the  case  No  PC  28/2009  is  that it was  the Appellants who"
"are entitled to the  possession  of the disputed  land. This order had  been"
"delivered  on  2009-12-02. This  means that it should  be the Appellants who"
"should  be entitled to the  possession  of the said  land  even  as at the date on"
"which  the information  in  the instant case  was  filed  with  an  affidavit dated"
"2010-02-23.  This  is  because the  previous order of Court is  binding on  the"
"parties.  It is  not open  for such  parties to  re  agitate the same  matter in  the"
"same  forum  after the  lapse of such  short period.  It is unfortunate that"
"learned  Prif\lary Court Judge had  knowingly entertained  this case  in  such  a"
"situation."
"For the foregoing  reasons  this  Court decides to set aside  both  the order"
