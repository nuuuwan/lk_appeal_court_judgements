"TRANSLATION OF VOETs COMMENTARY ON THE PANDECTS  and the following"
"extracts are from Berwick's Translation at pp 542 et seq.:~"
"""Section  l~Since on  the  confirmation  of  the  right  of  an  alienator  (which  was"
"defective at the time of the alienation) the originally defective right of the alienee"
"becomes confirmed from the very moment that the vendor acquired the dominium;"
"and therefore the dominium, from that time annexed to the original purchaser, could"
"not be  taken  away  from  him  without his  own act  or consent;  hence  he  has  the"
"right  of  suing his vendor or a third party~possessor on account of the loss  of his"
"possession, and of defeating his opponent's plea by the replication of ownership."""
"""Section 2~But if the purchaser still possesses the thing, and the same persons that"
"are liable to be sued (by him) in respect of its eviction bring an action to evict the"
"property  from  him,  it  is  in  his  discretion,  whether  he  will  suffer  eviction  and"
"afterwards,  when  it  has  been  taken  from  him.  sue  the  successful  party  by  the"
"action ex stipulatio in duplum,  or by the action exempto for the id qodintrest (damages),"
"or whether he will prefer to keep the property and repel his vendor and other like"
"persons  seeking to evict him  either by the exceptiO  rei  venditae et  traditae  or by the"
"exceptiO doli."""
"""Section  3~ This plea  may be  opposed,  not only to the original vendor,  but to all"
"those who claiming under him endeavour to evict a thing from the first purchaser;"
"such as those to whom the vendor has again alienated the same thing, whether by"
"an  onerous  or  lucrative  tide  after  he  became  owner  (i.e.,  after  he  acquired  the"
"dominium which he did not have when he first sold it)'''"
