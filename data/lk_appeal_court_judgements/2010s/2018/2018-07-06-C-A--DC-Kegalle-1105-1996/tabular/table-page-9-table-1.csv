"current CPC are reflected in the 1960 legislation. It is worth noting that Section 759(2) of"
"the current CPC did not have  a corresponding counterpart in the old CPC and I would"
"opine that Section 4 of the Supreme Court Appeal (Special Provisions) Act No.4 of 1960"
"could be regarded as the precursor to Section 759(2) of the current Cpe."
"Whilst Section 4 postulates no dismissal of the petition of appeal unless there has been"
"material prejudice caused to the Respondent, the section prescribes latitude to Court to"
"remit 
the  petition  of  appeal  for  rectification  of  errors  within  prescribed  time  and"
"specified directions.  Only when there was a failure  to comply with such directions, the"
"non-compliance eventuated in a dismissal or rejection of the petition of appeal."
"It was possibly in the aftermath of the liberality of this legislation that the case of Kiri"
"Mudiyanse v.  Bandara Menika,  (1972)  76  N.LR.  371  was decided but this case did not"
"allude to  Supreme Court Appeal (Special Provisions) Act No.4 of 1960 but rather relied"
"heavily  on Section 770  of the old Civil  Procedure  Code.  The case  also  considered both"
"Dias v.  Arnolls (supra)  and Ibrahim  v.  Beebee (supra).  Pathirana, J.  (with Rajaratnam, J.)"
"held that the Supreme Court had the discretionary power under Section 770  of the old"
"Civil Procedure Code to direct the 1st  to 3rd and the 6th to the 8th Defendants to be added"
"as  Respondents.  The  exercise  of the discretion  contemplated in  Section 770  of the  old"
"CPC was a matter for  the decision of the Judge who heard the appeal in the particular"
"case.  Furthermore, it should be exercised when some good reason or cause was given for"
"the  non-joinder.  The  discretion  which  was  an  unfettered  one  must,  of  course,  be"
"exercised judicially and not arbitrarily and capriciously."
"In  fact  Pathirana, J. 
(with  Rajaratnam,  J.  agreeing)  stated  that  intrinsically  there  is"
"nothing  in  Section  770  either  expressly  or  by  necessary  implication  to  inhibit  the"
"discretion to the principles that have been set out in the case of Ibrahim  v.  Beebee as to"
"do so will be tantamount to saying that the exercise of the discretion is cribbed, cabined"
"and confined exclusively to these principles, limiting the exercise of the discretion in a"
"particular way,  and thereby putting an end to the discretion itself.  Pathirana, J.  quoted"
