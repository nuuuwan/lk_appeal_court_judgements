"However,  as  correctly held  by the learned  District Judge there are  other grounds as  to why the"
"action of the Plaintiff must fail."
"The  Plaintiff  claimed  that  John  Mendis  had  only  four  children,  namely  Trixie  Mendis,  Helsin"
"Mendis,  Malini  Mendis  Ratnapala  and  Douglas  Mendis and  that  upon  his  death  his  rights  were"
"inherited by the four children. But the evidence establishes that he in fact had seven (7) children."
"Furthermore, Anulawathie Mendis admitted during her cross examination that John Mendis had"
"left a last will  but that it was  not proved  in  a court of law.  In  these  circumstances,  the  learned"
"District Judge  held that no action can  be  maintained  in  relation to the property of John  Mendis"
