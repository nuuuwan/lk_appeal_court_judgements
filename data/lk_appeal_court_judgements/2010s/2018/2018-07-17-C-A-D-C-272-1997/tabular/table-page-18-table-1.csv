"by  Representation~(2003)  4th  Edition  at  p.l72~it  is  declared  that  no  contract  or"
"consent of a party to litigation can confer jurisdiction on any person not already vested"
"with it by the law of land, or add to the jurisdiction lawfully exercised by any judicial"
"tribunal;  it is  equally  plain  that  the  same  results  cannot  be  achieved  by conduct  or"
"acquiescence by the parties.  In the words of Lord Reid:  ' .. .it is a fundamental principle"
"that no  consent can confer on a Court or tribunal with limited statutory jurisdiction"
"any  power  to  act  beyond  that jurisdiction,  or  can  estop  the  consenting  party from"
"subsequently maintaining that such Court or tribunal has  acted without jurisdiction'~"
"see Essex CC v.  Essex Incorporated Congregational Church Union [1963]  AC  808 at"
