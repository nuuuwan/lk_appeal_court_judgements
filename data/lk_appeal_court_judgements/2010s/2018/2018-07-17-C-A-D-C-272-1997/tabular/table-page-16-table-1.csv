"jUrisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as a 'patent' or"
"'total' want ofjurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the second a 'latent' or 'contingent'"
"want  of jurisdiction  or  a defectus  triationis.  Both  classes  of jurisdictional  defects  result  in"
"judgments or orders which are void.  But an  important difference must also  be noted ............  In"
"that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or acquiescence"
"can  cure the want of jurisdiction.  In  the other class  of case,  where  the want of jurisdiction is"
"contingent only, the judgment or order of the court will be void only against the party on whom"
"it operates but acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may stop him from"
"making or attempting to  establish by  evidence,  any  averment to  the effect  that the court was"
"lacking in contingent jurisdiction."""
