"""The whole of our law of res judicata  is  to  be found  in  sections 34, 207 and 406  of the Civil"
"Procedure Code. The decrees  spoken of in section 207 are decrees drawn up by the court under"
"section 188 after judgment has been pronounced in the manner contemplated in section 184, 185,"
"186 and 187 of the Cpc. Section 207 will therefore apply only to decrees pronounced after there"
"has been adjudication on the merits of a suit and not to a decree entered under section 87 of the"
"CPC in consequence of the non-appearance of the plaintiff"""
