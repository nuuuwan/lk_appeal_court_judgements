"Thus,  the  precedent,  which  would  prevail  before this  Court,  is  that a"
"revisionary Court ought not to  set aside  an  order of the  Primary Court on"
"the  mere  basis  that Primary Court had  failed  to attempt to settle the"
"dispute between  the  parties."
"This Court sees  no  acceptable argument placed  before  it by the"
"Respondent as  to why this Court should  not adopt that principle  in  this"
"case."
"The  learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge  had  relied  on  the judgment in  the"
"case  of Ali  V Abdeen. 5  He  had  also taken  the  view that the  learned  Primary"
"Court Judge  had  failed  to attempt to  settle the dispute  between  the"
"parties.  However, the  effect of such  a conclusion  according  to the above"
"judgment6  would  be  the lack of jurisdiction  for the  Primary Court Judge to"
"proceed  to  inquire into the  matter.  This  means that Court could  have  made"
"no  positive order with  regard  to  the  entitlement of possession.  It is"
"because of the  simple  reason  that Court under such  circumstances lacks"
"jurisdiction to  inquire  into such  dispute."
