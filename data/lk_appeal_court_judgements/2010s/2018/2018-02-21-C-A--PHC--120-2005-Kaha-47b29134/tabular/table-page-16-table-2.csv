"Court.  It does not set out any acceptable ground as to why this Court"
"should conclude that the order of the Primary Court is  illegal or at least"
"improper."
"Perusal  of the order made by the  learned  Primary Court Judge  in this case"
"also  does not reveal  any such basis as to the  necessity of intervention by a"
"revisionary Court."
"Once the  Primary Court has made an  order,  it is for any interested party to"
"have any of his remaining  rights vindicated  by a competent Court."
