"A Court needs to have jurisdiction to inquire into something.  It is only after"
"such  an  inquiry that Court could  come to a conclusion.  This follows that no"
"conclusion  could  be  reached  when the Court lacks jurisdiction."
"The  learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge  had  assumed jurisdiction to arrive"
"at a conclusion  that the  Respondents are entitled to the  possession of the"
"impugned  property while holding that the Primary Court has  had  no"
"jurisdiction  in  respect of the same  matter. This Court is of the  view that it"
"is a serious error,  which  is sufficient by itself to vitiate the whole judgment"
"of the  learned  Provincial  High Court Judge. Thus,  we  have  no  hesitation to"
"set aside the said judgment of the learned  Provincial  High Court Judge."
"Perusal  of the  proceedings before the Provincial  High  Court shows to the"
"satisfaction  of this Court that it was the  learned counsel  who  had  appeared"
"for the Respondenf  who  had  urged the  learned  Provincial  High  Court"
"Judge to set aside the finding  of the  Primary  Court on  the  basis that he  had"
"failed  to attempt to settle the dispute.' The  Respondent at the  same time"
"had  also  urged  the  learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge  to grant the"
"possession  of the disputed  property to  him.  This  is  a clear"
"7  Petitioner in  the Provincial  High  Court."
