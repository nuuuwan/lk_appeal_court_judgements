"immediately  thereon.  Accordingly,  the  period  of validity  envisaged  in  terms  of"
"Section 2(4).  of the  Act would relate to  the  date  of making the order and  as  such"
"has  no  relevance to the  date of operation of the order.  Therefore it is  clear that the"
"date  of making  the  said  order contemplated  by  Section  2(4)  of the  Act would  be"
"the commencement of the period of validity and not the operative date of the order"
"as  contemplated  by  Section  7(1)  of the  Act,  which  empowers  the  Minister  to"
"specify a later date as the operative date of the order."
