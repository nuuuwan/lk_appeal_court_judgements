"evidence  was  that they  emptied  the  money  into  a black  plastic bag.  He"
"further  stated 
that 
the 
two  persons 
identified  by 
the  witnesses  had"
"bleeding  injuries  where  as  there  was  no  evidence  to  say  the  appellant"
"was  sustained  bleeding  injuries.  The investigating officer has said 
there"
"was  a  motorcycle  near a  parapet  wall  and  a  person  standing  next to  it"
"took  to  his  heels  when  he  saw  the  witness  and  he  was  arrested  after"
"giving  chase.  The  counsel  argued  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"failed 
to  consider  this  evidence  which  shows  that  the  appellant  was"
"framed without any evidence to implicate him. He also said that the whole"
"operation  had taken only five minutes and the learned High Court Judge"
"has failed  to  consider whether in  the circumstances the witnesses could"
"have made a proper identification  under the conditions and  whether it is"
