"In  any event, the  Petitioners have  not even  attempted to  have the hearing of"
"the appeal accelerated."
"The other grounds urged as exceptional circumstances relate to the failure  of"
"the High  Court to  consider the material placed before it and the learned High"
"Court Judge  misdirecting himself on  the facts  and the  law.  The  petition  does"
"not specify  in  detail  the  matters  on  which  the  learned  High  Court Judge  has"
"misdirected himself and if so,  its  impact on  the final  outcome. This court has"
"examined  the  judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  and  find  that  the"
"matters addressed by the  Petitioner and the  2nd  Respondent have been taken"
"into consideration by the learned High Court Judge. The attention of this Court"
"has not been drawn to any finding of the learned High  Court Judge which is so"
