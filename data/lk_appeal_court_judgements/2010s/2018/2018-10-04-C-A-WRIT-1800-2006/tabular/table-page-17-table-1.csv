"The  second  complaint  of  the  Petitioners 
is 
that  sufficient  vacancies  were"
"available  to  grant  more  appointments  to  Sinhalese  candidates.  According  to"
"the Respondents, the total number of vacancies available was  350. Thus,  going"
"in 
by  the  Petitioners  own  argument  that  by  applying  the  ethnic  ratio  given"
"(P13'  that 75%  of the appointments should  be  given  to Sinhalese,  the number"
"of Sinhalese candidates entitled to appointments will only be  262. According to"
"(PS',  241  Sinhalese  candidates  have  been  appointed.  The  Respondents  have"
"explained  that  (21  vacancies  were  not  filled  as 
the  next  34  candidates  had"
"obtained  equal  marks  at the said  examination'.  Paragraph  16 of (P3'  provides"
"that where  candidates  have  equal  marks,  a decision  needs to be  taken  by  the"
"Education Services  Board of the Public Service Commission. This  Court is of the"
"view that the decision taken  by the  Respondents to not offer appointments to"
"21  out of the 34 candidates who had  obtained 171 marks5  is  reasonable, as the"
"number  of  appointees  cannot  exceed 
the  vacancies 
in 
the  cadre.  To  have"
"selected  21  persons  out  of 34  equally  qualified  candidates  would  have  been"
"arbitrary. This  is  a decision that a sensible  person who had  applied  his  mind to"
"the  issue  at  hand  could  have  arrived  at. 
In 
these  circumstances,  this  Court"
"cannot term the said  decision as  being irrational."
"The  Petitioners  have  sought  to  dispute  the  position  of the  Respondents,  that"
"the number of vacancies  was only 350,  and  have  submitted several  documents"
"with their counter affidavit purporting to support their position. The  first such"
"5  Only the 2nd  and  5th  Petitioners have obtained 171 marks. The  other Petitioners have only obtained"
"170 marks."
