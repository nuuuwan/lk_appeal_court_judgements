"","It must be  borne in  mind that the Appellant had  been  appointed to the"
"","board of directors of Rubberite Limited  by the DFCC  Bank as  per its right to"
"","appoint a nominee director to the board  of Rubberite  Limited  as  per a"
"","clause  in  the loan  agreement.  (DFCC  Bank  had  given a loan  to Rubberite"
"","Limited). It is amply clear from the document marked  3 V 6 that the DFCC"
"","Bank had  withdrawn  its nominee Director (Appellant was the nominee"
"","Director at that time) from the Board  of Directors of Rubberite  Limited  with"
"","effect from  1989-05-12. It is with that letter sent by the DFCC  Bank,  the"
"","letter of resignation of the Appellant marked  3 V 7 had  been  forwarded to"
"","the Rubberite Limited."
"","The above evidence clearly establish that the Appellant had  not functioned"
"","as  a director of Rubberite  Limited  between the time period  from  1990-09-"
"","10 to 1990-10-01. Thus, the Appellant cannot be  held  liable for the above"
"","offence.  Learned  Magistrate has failed to appreciate the above facts in  his"
"","judgment. That appears to have  led to the conviction of the Appellant."
"","The learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge also  has missed  the said  points"
"","and  hence  has erred  when  it decided to uphold the conviction of the"
"","Appellant."
