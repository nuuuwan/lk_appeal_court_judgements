"9"
"In  any  event,  that  Permit,  as  it  is  expressly  stated  in  clause  1"
"thereof, is valid only for one year and therefore has long expired"
"by 24.07.2015 and this action was filed on 15.09.2016."
"Furthermore, according to clause 9 of the Permit, that approval"
"is  subject  to  obtaining  the  other  approvals  from  other  relevant"
"Agencies."
"Whatever may be the reason which they try to adduce, the 15th"
"and  16th  Respondents  in  paragraph  12(iv)  of  their  objections"
"have  admitted  that  the  Certificate  of  Conformity  in  respect  of"
"that  warehouse  has  not  yet  been  issued  notwithstanding  the"
"warehouse 
is  admittedly 
in  operation. 
  The 
fact 
that 
the"
"Certificate  of  Conformity  is  yet  to  be  issued  has  been  admitted"
"by the 18th Respondent-Developer himself by tendering A10."
"In 
terms  of  clause  7  of 
the  Permit  A5, 
the  Certificate  of"
"Conformity needs to be issued before the commencement of the"
"operations."
"The  fact  that  the  Certificate  of  Conformity  is  yet  to  be  issued"
"goes  to  show  that  the  contention  that  the  building  is  complete"
"and  therefore  this  application  is  futile  is  untenable.    The  issue"
"is,  arguably,  still  live,  even  if  the  first  part  of  the  mandamus  is"
"concerned,  which 
is 
the  prevention  of  construction  of 
the"
"building. In any event, the second part of the mandamus, which"
"is the prevention of operation of the business in the building, is,"
"undoubtedly, a live issue."
"At  this  juncture,  I  must  also  make  reference  to  the  Wrongdoer"
"Principle,  which  seems  to  be  the  further  development  of  the"
"Roman-Dutch 
Law 
principle 
spoliatus 
ante 
debet 
omnia"
