"said  objections  or  in  the  written  submissions  explain  why  they"
"say that the warehouse in question is a duly approved building"
"in terms of the Urban Development Act Regulations."
"The  argument  of  the  Municipal  Council  seems  to  be  that  in"
"terms of clause 2.2 of the Regulations, which states that, “Where"
