"However, Courts were reluctant to lay any rigid  rule in identifying decisions  made per incuriam."
"As Sir Raymond  Evershed  MR stated in More/le v Wakeling  [(1955) 2 U.B. 379 at p 406]:"
"""As a general rule the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per"
"incuriam are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfullness of some inconsistent"
"statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned: so that in  such"
"cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found,"
"on that account, to be demonstrably wrong. This definition is not necessarily exhaustive"
"but  cases  not  strictly  within  it  which  can  properly  be  held  to  have  been  decided  per"
"incuriam  must, 
in  our  judgment,  consistently  with  the stare  decisis rule  which 
is  an"
"essential feature of our law, be, in the language of Lord Greene, of the rarest occurrence."
"In the present case  it is  not shown that any statutory provision or binding authority was"
"overlooked,  and  while not excluding  the possibility that in  rare  and exceptional cases  a"
"decision  may properly be  held to  have been  per incuriam on  other grounds,  we  cannot"
"regard  this  as  such  a case.  As  we  have already said,  it is,  in  our judgment, impossible to"
"fasten  upon  any  part  of  the  decision  under  consideration  or  upon  any  step 
in 
the"
"reasoning upon which the Judgments were based  and to say of it: ""Here  was  a manifest"
"slip or error""."" (Emphasis added)"
