"","In Rickards v.  Rickards [(1989) 3 W.L.R.  748] the Court of Appeal sought to provide some general"
"considerations on  the exceptional categories as follows:",""
"","""First, the preferred course  must always  be  to follow the previous  decision,  but to give"
"leave  to  appeal","in  order  that  the  House  of  Lords  may  remedy  the  error.  This  was"
"","attempted in Bokhari v.  Mahmood, but failed  because of the understandable reluctance"
"","of the defendant to prosecute the appeal. Second, certainty in relation to substantive law"
"","is  usually to  be  preferred to correctness,  since  this  at least  enables  the  public to order"
"","their affairs with confidence.  Erroneous  decisions  as  to procedural  rules  affect only the"
"","parties engaged in relevant litigation. This is a much-less extensive group and accordingly"
"a  departure  from  established  practice","is 
to  that  extent 
less  undesirable.  Third,  an"
"erroneous 
decision  which","involves 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
court 
is 
particularly"
"","objectionable, either because it will involve an abuse of power if the true view is that the"
"","court has  no jurisdiction or a breach  of the court's statutory duty if the true view is  that"
"","the court is wrongly declining jurisdiction. Such a decision, of which this case  provides an"
"","example,  is  thus  in  a special  category.  Nevertheless,  this  court  must  have  very  strong"
"","reasons if any departure from its own previous decisions is to be justifiable."""
