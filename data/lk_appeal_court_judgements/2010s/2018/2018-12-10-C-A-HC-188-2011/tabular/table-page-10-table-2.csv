"Perusal of the judgment revealed that the trial Court was mindful of"
"the  legal  position  in  relation  to 
the  Accused-Appellant.  This  is  evident"

"the  Accused-Appellant  had  failed 
to 
raise  a

the  complaint  of 
the  Accused"
"Appellant is  the  wording  that  had  been 
used  in  the  analysis  of  defence"
