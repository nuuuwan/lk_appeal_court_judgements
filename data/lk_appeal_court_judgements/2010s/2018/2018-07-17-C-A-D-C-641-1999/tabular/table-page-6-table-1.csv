"that the witnesses were giving direct evidence of what they saw, heard and perceived. It"
"does  not appear to this Court that the medical certificates of these two doctors were"
"given to suit the story of the 1st Plaintiff."
"Pinchi Amma~the 1st  Plaintiff testified that as she had been ill on the nth December 1997"
"she had to visit an Ayurvedic Doctor to be treated with medicines on the nth. At page 85"
"of the brief she describes as to how herillness had progressed rather than regressed. She"
"first fell ill on the 5th  and she was too weak to get up or walk. So she first got treatment"
"from an Ayurvedic Doctor called Welgama and as she did not get better, she went to a"
"Government hospital.  She was warded therein for 4 days.  It goes without saying that if"
"the Plaintiff had not been so  sick as she described, she would not have been kept as  a"
"patient for 4 days."
"Her testimony reveals the fact that she had asked for a medical certificate on the nth but"
"it was given only on the 12th  and collected by her son.  There is  corroboration of this"
"testimony to a great degree by the two medical men.  But there is a misappreciation of"
"evidence  as  the  learned  District Judge  wonders  as  to  how  the  Plaintiff could  get  a"
"medical certificate from the Ayurvedic doctor if she had been in the hospital on the 12th."
"The  observation of the learned  District Judge  on this  score  is  thus erroneous having"
"regard to the fact that the medical certificate was collected by her son."
"What strikes  this  Court as  a factor  to be  taken cognizance of is the evidence  of two"
"doctors who had treated the 1st  Plaintiff successively and no suggestion was ever made"
