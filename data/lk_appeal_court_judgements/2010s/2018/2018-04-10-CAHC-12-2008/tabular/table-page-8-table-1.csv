"2.(2) For the purposes of this Ordinance, anything in the order, disposition,  power,"
"or control of a person is deemed to  be in  his possession."
"In the factual scenario of this instant case,  we find that the Prosecution had not proved"
"the possession,  hence the finding  of the Judge is  incorrect."
"If the  respondent Attorney General  filed  written  submission  it would  have  helped  us"
"immensely.  Unfortunately, they have  not filed the said  submissions."
"After carefully considering the major issue,  it will  be  more academic to consider other"
"grounds of appeal, therefore we  are  not discussing  other grounds."
"For the  reasons  stated  above we  find  that the conviction  cannot be sustained. Hence,"
"we  find  the Accused  Appellant not guilty, accordingly we  allow the appeal  and  acquit"
"him from this proceeding."
