"Considering  that  the  Appellants  have  failed  to  tender  a  copy  of the  entire  case"
"record to the  High Court which in  fact  is  a violation of Court of Appeal rules,  we"
"are of the view that this appeal should have been dismissed in limine."
"Anyway  we  considered  the  merits  of the  case  and  find  that  the  Appellants  had"
"failed  to  establish exceptional  circumstances to  the  satisfaction of the  High Court"
"and  therefore  the  Learned High Court Judge  of Gampaha had correctly dismissed"
"the revision application."
"Appeal is hereby dismissed with costs."
