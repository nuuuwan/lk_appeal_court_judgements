"01.11.2012  (annexure  to  P18),  it  is  stated  that  “Representative  of"
"SLLRDC 
(the  1st  respondent)  stated  the 
land  referred  to  by  the"
"investor was not advertised to be allocated for any project.”"
"Even  if  it  is  to  be  considered  as  the  land  depicted  in  Plan  359,"
"according  to  P10,  the  land  does  not  belong  to  the  1st  respondent."
"It  partly  belongs  to  REDECO,  a  subsidiary  of  the  1st  respondent"
"(and not to the 1st respondent), and the ownership of the other part"
"is presently in dispute and the matter is pending in this Court.  In"
"that  backdrop  how  can  the  Court  issue  a  mandamus  compelling"
"the 1st respondent to convey the land to the petitioner?"
"“Mandamus  will not  be issued  where the respondent has no power"
"to  perform 
the  act  sought 
to  be  mandated.” 
(Kumarasinghe  v."
"Dayananda  Dissanayake8)    Nor  will  it  be  issued  “when  it  appears"
"that it is impossible of performance by reason of the circumstances”."
"(Wannigama v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education9)"
"In  any  event,  the  decision  to  allocate  the  land,  according  to  P11,"
"has  been 
taken  subject 
to  a  number  of  conditions 
including"
"approval  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers.    These  conditions  have  not"
"been 
fully 
satisfied  and  approvals  have  not  been 
obtained."
"Mandamus cannot be issued subject to fulfilling of conditions."
"""Mandamus  will  not  be  granted  to  compel  the  performance  of  some"
"duty which may arise in the future. There must be an existing duty,"
"and  an  existing 
right 
in 
the  petitioner 
to  have 
it  performed."""
"(Mohamedu v. De Silva10)"
