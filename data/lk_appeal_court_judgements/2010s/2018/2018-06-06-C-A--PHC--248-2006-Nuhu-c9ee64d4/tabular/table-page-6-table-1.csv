"This Court observes that the written submission  of the Appellant does not"
"set out any ground, which  is at least suggestive of any illegality or any"

"not irregular. Therefore,  it is  clear that there had  been  no ground upon"
"which  the  Provincial  High  Court could  have  intervened to exercise  its"
"revisionary jurisdiction,  in  this case."
