"","Section  13 provides for repudiation of a settlement if one does not wish to honour"
"","it.  Aforesaid Sections show that the certificate is  needed only when;"
"","a.  Proceedings  are  in  respect  of any dispute  referred  to in  paragraphs  (a),  (b)"
"","and  (c)  of section 6 of the said  act and"
"","b. 
It has  not been  possible to settle the dispute or"
"","c.  The settlement has been repudiated by a party who does not want to honour"

"","This  matter does  not fall  within  the  aforementioned  category  (b). 
On  the  other"
"","hand, the  Plaintiff has  been trying to enforce the terms relating to non- payments"
"","of  rent. 
If  there  was  anyone  who  wanted 
to  dishonour  the  settlement  and"
"","repudiate  it, it was the Defendant not the Plaintiff and  as  per the provisions in the"
"","Conciliation  Board  Act,  he  had to do it within 30 days from the date of settlement."
"","On  the  other hand,  It was  the  duty of the  chairman  of the  Conciliation  Board  to"
"","transmit the settlement to the relevant court which shall consider it as a decree of"
"","that court( Vide section 13 of the said Act).ln such a situation the only defence that"
"","could  have  been  taken  in  the answer was  that either he  complied  with the terms"
"","of settlement or there was  no such  settlement before the Conciliation  Board  that"
"","had  been transmitted to the relevant court. Therefore, I do not see any merit in the"
"","On  the other hand, as 
argument based  on  the new ground  raised  in  this Appeal."
"","per  the  decision  in  Rodrigo  V  Raymond  (2002)  2  SLR  78,  which  was  decided  in"
"","respect of the absence  of a certificate of non-settlement from a Mediation Board,"
"","such  a lapse  only give  rise  to a latent lack  of jurisdiction. 
In  such  a situation the"
"","Defendant should  have  first  raised  an  objection  to the jurisdiction  of the  District"
