"","The  Defendant relied  on  the  following grounds  in  the affidavit filed  in  the district"
"court to vacate the ex  parte Judgment.",""
"1.","The  Plaintiff failed  to comply with the  provisions of Section 55(1)  read  with"
"","Section  49(1)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code,  which  provisions  require  the"
"","Plaintiff to  serve  a copy  of the  Plaint  or a  concise  statement of the  Plaint"
"","translated into the Language  of the Defendant."
"","2.  The  Plaintiff had  not served  a Notice of Termination  of the Tenancy on  the"
"","Defendant. 
Hence,  no  order  for  ejectment  could  be  made  against  the"
"","Defendant."
"3.","The  Plaintiff failed to reveal  a cause  of action in  his  plaint."
"","Other than  aforesaid  3 grounds the  Defendant-Appellant  in  his  appeal  rely"
"","on the following new ground too."
"","4.  Though  the  Plaintiff filed  action  before the  District Court on  the  basis  of an"
"","alleged settlement between the  Plaintiff and  the  Defendant that took place"
"","at 
the  Conciliation  Board,  no  certificate  of  settlement 
issued  by 
the"
"","Conciliation  Board  had  been  produced  with  the  Plaint. 
Therefore,  the"
"","learned  District  Judge  did  not  have  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  Plaint  or"
"","enter Judgment against the Defendant."
"This Court observes that the Defendant had  purged  his default only by submitting",""
"","an affidavit, but as  per Section 86 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code, an  application to"
"","purge  default shall  be  made  by  a Petition  supported  by  an  affidavit.  Hence  the"
"application to purge default in the District Court itself is  defective.",""
