"contention  of the  appellant was that the  felling  of a  jack tree  cannot be"
"considered  as  an  overt  act  of  dispossession  of  the  plaintiff. 
In  this"
"context, 
if  the 
said  act 
is  considered  alone  without  considering 
the"
"cumulative  effect  of the  other  evidence  tendered  by  the  defendants  and"
"the  counter  evidence  of  the  plaintiff,  the  cutting  of the  jack  tree  alone"
"would  not  constitute  an  overt  act. 
It is  to  be  noted  that  the  learned"
"District Judge  had  observed  the  witnesses  and  their  demeanor  and  had"
"evaluated evidence."
