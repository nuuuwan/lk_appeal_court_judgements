"allege bias against a Judicial Officer and that this court would not lightly entertain"
"such  an  allegation."
"Considering  all  we  find  that  the  complaint  of  bias  cannot  be  substantiated  by  any"
"means.  We are  satisfied that there is  no bias,  hence we  find  no  merit in  this ground of"
"appeal."
"The  next  ground  of appeal  is  that the  proceedings  were  not  properly  adopted.  We"
"carefully perused  the  proceedings and  found  that there are  several  Judges  heard  this"
"case  and  every time when a new Judge took over proceedings were adopted."
"The  Counsel  submits  that when  the  proceedings  are  adopted  the Trial  Judge  should"
"make a detailed judicial order."
"Now we  refer section 48  of the Judicature which govern the adoption of proceedings."
