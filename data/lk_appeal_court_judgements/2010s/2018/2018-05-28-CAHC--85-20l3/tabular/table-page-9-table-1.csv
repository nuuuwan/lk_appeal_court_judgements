"In  Bharwada  Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State of Gujarat  (ibid) THAKKAR, J observed:"
"(7)  By and Large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory"
"and to  recall  the  details  of an  incident.  It  is  not as  if a video  tape  is  repLayed on"
"the mentaL screen."
"(2)  ordinarily  it  so  happens  that  a  witness  is  overtaken  by events.  The  witness"
"couLd  not  have  anticipated  the  occurrence  which  so  often  has  an  eLement  of"
"surprise.  The  mentaL 
facuLties 
therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  be  attuned  to"
"absorb  the details."
"(3)  The powers of observation differ from  person to person.  What one may notice,"
"another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person's"
"mind whereas it might go  unnoticed on  the part of another."
"(4)  By  and Large  peopLe  cannot accurateLy  recall  a conversation  and reproduce"
"the  very  words  used by them  or heard  by them.  They  can  onLy  recall  the  main"
"purport  of the  conversation.  It  is  unreaListic  to  expect  a witness  to  be  a human"
"tape recorder."
"(5)  In  regard to  exact time of an  incident,  or the time duration  of an  occurrence,"
"usually,  peopLe  make  their estimates  by guess  work  on  the  spur of the  moment"
"7.  7 
at the 
time of interrogation.  And one cannot expect peopLe  to  make very"
"precise or reliabLe estimates in such matters. Again,  it depends on  the time- sense"
"of individuaLs  which  varies  from  person  to  person."
"(6)  Ordinarily a witness  cannot be  expected to  recall  accurateLy the  sequence of"
"events  which  take pLace  in  rapid succession  or in  a short time span.  A witness  is"
"LiabLe  to get confused or mixed up  when  interrogated Later on."
