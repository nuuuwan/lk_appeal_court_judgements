"a  proper  application.  On  30.05.2006, 
the  Court  issued  an  interim  order"
"restraining  the  Appellant from  filling  the  land  described  in  the  corrected"
"affidavit.  In  issuing  the  interim  order,  the  Court  ruled  that  it  ""appears"""
"that the paddy land is being filled.  The case was to be called on 13.06.2006."
"It is evident from the proceedings before the Provincial High Court,"
"that  the  Appellant  has  supported  his  revision  application  on  13.06.2006,"

"the Appellant was issued with ""summons"" along with the interim order as"
"per  Section  33(5)  of  the  said  Act. 
However,  it  is  clear  that  he  has  had"
"sufficient notice of the nature of proceedings before the Magistrate's Court"
"and in fact has obtained a  certified copy of its  proceedings well before the"
