"date on which the case was to  be called  in open Court, and of his right to"
"show cause."
"According  to  the  Appellant,  in  these  circumstances,  the  procedure"
"prescribed  by  the  Act  was  erroneously  not  followed  by  the  Magistrate's"
"Court  and  as  a  result,  he  was  denied  an  opportunity  to  place  his  case"
"before the relevant Court for its consideration."
"Learned  Senior  State  Counsel  who  appeared  for 
the  Respondent,"
"sought to counter the submissions of the Appellant by inviting attention of"
"this Court to  the fact  that the Appellant was duly served with the interim"
"order 
and  with  that  he  was  well  aware  of  the  proceedings  before  the"
"Magistrate's Court. The Appellant also knew of the next date on which the"
"case was to be called as 13.06.2006 since he has obtained a certified copy of"
"its  proceedings  on  09.06.2006.  Learned  Senior  State  Counsel 
further"
"contended  that  the  Appellant,  having  had  the  opportunity  to  move  to"
"vacate the interim order by placing his case before the Magistrate's Court,"
"opted 
to  go  before 
the  Provincial  High  Court 
instead, 
invoking 
its"
"revisionary jurisdiction."
"Therefore, 
the 
learned  Counsel 
submitted 
that 
the 
conclusion"
"reached  by  the  Provincial  High  Court is  correct  as  the  application  of  the"
"Appellant before it was  premature and  was made without resorting to  a"
"more  effective  remedy  of  placing  his  case  before  the  very  Court,  which"
"issued the interim order."
