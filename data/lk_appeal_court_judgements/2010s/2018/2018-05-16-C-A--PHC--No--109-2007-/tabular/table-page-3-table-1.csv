"Respondent  (hereinafter  referred 
to  as 
the  ""Respondent"")  for  allegedly"
"filling a paddy land."
"The Appellant, in his revision application filed  before the Provincial"
"High  Court,  claimed  that  he  was  only  served  with  an  interim  order  of"
"30.05.2006,  by  the  Magistrate's  Court  of  Bandaragama,  restraining  him"
"from 
filling  a  paddy 
land  and  he  was  not  served  with  summons  as"
"required  by Section 33(5) of the said Act."
"Learned  High Court Judge,  by  her impugned  order,  has  dismissed"
"his revision application on the basis that his  application is  premature and"
"that he should have first endeavoured to  vacate  the said  interim order by"
"making an application to the relevant Magistrate's Court."
"At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  learned  Counsel  for 
the  Appellant"
"submitted 
that  when  the  Respondent  made  his 
initial  application, 
the"
"Magistrate's  Court  should  have  dismissed  it  as  the  annexed  affidavit  is"
"defective.  He  further  contended  that  when  such  an  application  is  made,"
"the  Magistrate's  Court must first  satisfy  itself  that  the  material  disclosed"
"revealed that there is a  violation of  the provisions contained in Section 33."
"It could only  thereafter issue an interim order and, in addition, summons"
"on  the  person  against  whom  the  application  is  made.  In  this  particular"
"the  Magistrate's  Court  has  only 
issued 
interim  order.  No 
instance,"
"summons was issued on the Appellant and he was not notified of the next"
