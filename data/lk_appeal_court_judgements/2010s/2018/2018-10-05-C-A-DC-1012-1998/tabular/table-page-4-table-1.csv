erely because this Court takes the view that deed marked 6V3"
"can  be  received 
in  evidence, 
that  does  not  mean 
that 
the"
"contents of that deed shall unequivocally be accepted by Court."
"As  stated  in  Cooray  v.  Wijesuriya  (1958)  62  NLR  158:  ""Before  a"
"Court can  accept  as  correct  a  share  which  is stated  in  a  deed  to"
"belong to the vendor there must be clear and unequivocal proof of"
"how the vendor became entitled to that share."""
"Even  though  by  6V3  Razeena  Umma  has  transferred  undivided"
"1/8th share from the whole land to the 6th defendant, the learned"
"District  Judge  has  decided  that  Razeena  Umma  is  entitled  to"
"48/1920 share from the whole land.  Learned counsel for the 6th"
"defendant-appellant does not canvess that finding."
"Therefore 
the  6th  defendant 
shall  be  declared 
entitled 
to"
"undivided 48/1920 share from the corpus."
"The next deed relied upon by the 6th defendant is deed No.14015"
"marked  6V5.    By  this  deed  Abdul  Majeed  has  transferred  some"
"undivided  rights  to  the  6th  defendant. 
  This  deed  has  been"
"rejected  by 
the 
learned  District  Judge  on 
two  grounds: 
(a)"
"execution  after  the  institution  of  the  action  and  (b)  on  prior"
"registration."
"The  (a)  above  cannot  be  a  ground  for  the  rejection  of  this  deed"
"(6V5) executed on the same day as 6V3."
"However, rejection of that deed on (b) above is justifiable."
"Abdul Majeed has earlier transferred his rights by deed  marked"
"9V1 to the 9th defendant."
