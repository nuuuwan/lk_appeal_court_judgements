"S
amayawardhena, J."
"This is a partition action."
"The  plaintiff  and  the  6th  defendant  have  appealed  against  the"
"Judgment of the District Court."
"The plaintiff’s appeal (CA/1013/1998) has been abated."
"The 6th defendant-appellant’s appeal is taken up for argument."
"Learned  counsel 
for  the  6th  defendant-appellant  and 
learned"
"counsel for the 1st defendant-respondent were heard."
"Insofar  as 
the  6th  defendant’s  appeal 
is  concerned, 
the  1st"
"defendant-respondent  is  not  an  affected  party. 
  The  affected"
"party is the 9th defendant-respondent who is not before Court."
"The  6th  defendant  has  not  been  allocated  any  shares  in  the"
"Judgment."
"The 6th defendant relies on two deeds to claim undivided rights"
"in the corpus."
"The first deed is deed No.14014 marked at the trial 6V3.  By this"
"deed Razeena Umma has transferred her undivided rights to the"
"6th defendant.  The learned District Judge has accepted Razeena"
"Umma’s  undivided  rights  in  the  corpus,  but  refused  to  accept"
"that  deed  on  the  basis  that 
it  has  been  executed  after  the"
"institution of the action.  Therefore, Razeena Umma’s share has"
"been left unallotted."
"Refusal to accept that deed, in my view, is not correct."
