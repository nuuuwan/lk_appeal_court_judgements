"respondent  was  holding 
the  post  of  Deputy  Superintendent"
"(Covering) of the Sri Lanka Railway Security Service.  But by P9,"
"the  2nd 
respondent  was  appointed 
as 
the  Superintendent"
"(Covering)  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Railway  Security  Service,  and  the"
"petitioner  was 
appointed 
as 
the  Deputy

"At the first interview, out of 10 marks, only 5 marks were given"
"to 
the 
2nd 
respondent 
for 
“attendance, 
performance 
and"
"conduct”, and full 10 marks were given to the petitioner.  At this"
"interview  the  2nd  respondent  was  not  recommended 
for  the"
"promotion,  as 
the  petitioner  himself  admits 
in 
the  written"
"submissions, 
due 
to 
“certain 
disciplinary 
inquiry  pending"
"against the 2nd respondent at that time.”"
"By the time the final interview was held, the 2nd respondent had"
"been  exonerated 
from 
the  disciplinary 
inquiry,  according 
to"
"paragraph  21  of 
the  petition, 
“at 
the 
instance  of 
the 
then"
"Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport”  (who  seems  to  me  to  be"
"the disciplinary authority according to the Establishment Code)."
"Upon  such  clearance,  all  his  salary  increments  have  also  been"
"given.    Therefore,  the  final  interview  panel  has  given  full  10"
"marks  for  the  2nd  respondent  for  “attendance,  performance and"
"conduct”  and  recommended  the  2nd  respondent  for  promotion."
"When  10  marks  were  given  to  the  2nd  respondent  as  such  for"
"“attendance,  performance  and  conduct”,  the  cumulative  marks"
"of the 2nd respondent exceeded those of the petitioner."
"It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that"
"“It was not open to the 4 member structured interview panel (final"
"interview  panel)  to  alter  or  amend  the  marks  allocated  by  the  3"
"member panel (first  interview  panel)  without  the consent of the  3"
