"seizure  was  done  while  the  Agreement  was  subsisting  without  his  consent  and  in  violation  of"
"clause  13  of the  Agreement  and  section  20  of the  Consumer  Credit  Act  No.  29  of 1982  (Act)"
"although  he  had  by then  paid  more than  75%  of the  hire  purchase  price.  The  Plaintiff claimed"
"that  after the  unlawful  seizure,  the  Defendant  had  sold  the  Vehicle  to  a third  party  and  that"
"consequently the Plaintiff had  suffered damages  of Rs.  7,00,000/= and  prayed for judgement in"
"the said  sum."
"The  Defendant claimed that the Plaintiff had  breached the Agreement  by  selling the Vehicle to"
"one  R.  Dayasena  without the consent  of the  Defendant and  that therefore the  Defendant had"
"the  right  in  terms  of  the  Agreement  and 
the  Act  to  repossess  the  Vehicle.  The  Defendant"
"counter claimed in a sum  of Rs.  137,484/38 as  arrears of the hire purchase price."
"The 
learned  District  Judge  of  Bandarawela  held  that  the  Defendant  had  seized 
the  Vehicle"
"without recourse to an  action and  without lawfully terminating the Agreement even  though  by"
"the time of the seizure  the  Plaintiff had  paid  more than  75%  of the  hire  purchase  price.  A sum"
"of Rs.  5,50,000/= was awarded as  damages to the Plaintiff.  Hence this appeal by the Defendant."
"The  learned  President's  Counsel  for the  Defendant  submitted  that the  Plaintiff  had  breached"
"the Agreement by selling the Vehicle to one  R.  Dayasena  without the consent of the Defendant"
"and  therefore the  Defendant had the right in  terms of the Agreement and  the Act to repossess"
"the Vehicle.  He submitted that even  where more than  75%  of the hire purchase  price  has  been"
"paid, section 20 of the Act is  not engaged  as the Vehicle was  repossessed  from a third party and"
"not  from  the  possession  of  the  hirer{Defendant). 
It  is  an 
interesting  argument  to  consider."
"However,  that issue  does  not arise for consideration  in  view of my conclusions on  whether the"
"Agreement was  duly terminated prior to seizure of the Vehicle."
