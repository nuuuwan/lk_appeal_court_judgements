"I wish  to  mention  a  lay  example  to  indicate  this  situation.  Few  decades  ago,  when"
"Medical Practitioners would prescribe medicine, they would usually instruct the patient"
"to take  medicine  by simply  mentioning the colours  of those  pills.  Presently,  a doctor"
"must  not only  hand  over  the  medication,  but also  formally  record  the  prescription,"
"intake and  side  effect of the said  medication in  a document presented to the  patient."
