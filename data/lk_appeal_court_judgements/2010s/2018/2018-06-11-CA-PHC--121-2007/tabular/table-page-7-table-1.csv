"The  meaning of the word ""deemed"" was considered and explained by Ranasinghe, J.  (as  he then"
"was)  in Jinawathie v.  Emalin 3 in the following words:"
"""In  statutes,  the  expression  deemed  is  commonly  used  for the  purpose  of creating  a"
"statutory function so that a meaning of a term  is  extended to a subject-matter which  it"
"properly does not designate ... Thus,  where a person  is  deemed to be  something it only"
"means  that whereas  he  is  not in  reality that something,  the  Act  of Parliament  requires"
"him to be treated as  if he were""."
