"We  are  of the  view  that the  goods  forming  the  subject  matter  of the  contracts  between  the"
"Appellant and his contractors are not specific or ascertained goods but unascertained goods. The"
"contracts do not identify the particular trees to be cut. It refers only to the number of trees. The"
"contracts  require  the  contractor to take  over the  trees  that are  identified  by the  field  officer."
"Hence  the  goods  remain  unascertained  as  at  the  date  of payment  and  passing  of ""exclusive"
"ownership of goods""  did  not for the purposes  of the Sale  of Goods  Ordinance take  place  at the"
"date of payment as  submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellant."
