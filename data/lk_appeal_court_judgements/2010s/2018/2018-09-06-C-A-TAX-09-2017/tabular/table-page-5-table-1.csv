"Termination  of Employment of Workmen (Special  Provisions) Act No.  45  of 1971 Sharvananda J."
"(as  he was then) held:"
"""The delay should not render null and void the proceedings and affect the parties, as  the"
"parties  have  no control  over the proceedings.  It could  not have  been  intended that the"
"delay should  cause  a  loss  of jurisdiction,  that the  Commission  had  to give  an  effective"
"order of approval  or refusal.  In  my view,  a failure to comply literally with the aforesaid"
"provisions  does  not  affect  the  efficacy  or  finality  of  the  Commissioner's  order  made"
