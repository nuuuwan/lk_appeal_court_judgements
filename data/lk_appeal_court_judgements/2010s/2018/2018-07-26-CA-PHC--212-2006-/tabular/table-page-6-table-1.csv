"Before  proceeding  to  consider  the  other grounds  urged  by  the  Appellant  I wish  to  state  that"
"although I have held that the competent authority need not produce the relevant approval with"
"the application  made to the Magistrates Court even  where section  14(2) of the Act applies, the"
"procedure will be expedited by the competent authority submitting such approval along with his"
"application  for ejectment.  Such  a course  of action  will  certainly obviate  separate  proceedings"
"challenging  the vires  of the  quit  notice  on  that ground.  The  point  I have  made  is  that  merely"
"because the competent authority fails to submit such approval to the Magistrates Court when he"
"initiates proceedings or during an  inquiry, that is  not a ground to dismiss the said application."
"Another ground urged  by the Appellant was that he  had  entered the land  in  dispute based on  a"
"contract and as such  no proceedings can  be taken under the Act to evict him."
"I have no hesitation in rejecting this submission which is the same position taken by the learned"
"Magistrate.  A competent authority can  have  recourse to the Act to evict  any  person  who is  in"
"unauthorized  possession  or  occupation  of  state  land  including  possession  or  occupation  by"
"encroachment  upon  state land.  Any  possession  or occupation  without ""a  valid  permit or other"
"written  authority  of the  State  granted  in  accordance  with  any  written  law""  is  unauthorized"
"possession. The procedure in the Act can  be resorted to even where a party came into possession"
"of the state land upon an agreement and the agreement has been terminated. The mere fact that"
"the  rights and  liabilities under such  agreement can  be  the subject  matter of a civil  action  does"
