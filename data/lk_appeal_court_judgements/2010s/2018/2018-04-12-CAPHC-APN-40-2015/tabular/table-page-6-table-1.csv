"Therefore this court is of the view that the Petitioner was unable to establish that he"
"had no knowledge of the offence being committed and also he had taken all the"
"precautions to prevent the offence being committed."
"In the case of Orient Finance Services Corporation Ltd case ( SC Appeal  no"
"120 I 2011) held that the  owner should on a balance o/probability prove that the"
"offence was committed without the knowledge or that  all precautions to prevent"
"the offence was taken."
"Therefore the registered owner has not established on a balance of probability that"
"he took all precautions to prevent the offence taking place."
"Considering the above circumstances this court is of the view that there is no basis"
"to interfere with the findings of the learned High Court judge."
"The Revision application is hereby dismissed without costs."
