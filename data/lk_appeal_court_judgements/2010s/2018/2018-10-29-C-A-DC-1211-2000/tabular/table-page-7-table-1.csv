"I
t  is  abundantly  clear  that  no  proper  investigation  of  title  has"
"been  made  by 
the 
learned  Additional  District  Judge  before"
"pronouncing  the  Judgment(s).    Evidence  has  not  been  led  in  a"
"manner that should have been led in a partition action."
"The  paramount  duty  of  the  District  Judge  trying  a  partition"
"action is to investigate the title of each party quite independently"
"of  what  the  parities  may  or  may  not  tell  the  Court.16    It  is"
"important  to  understand  that  this  is  different  from  the  role  a"
"Judge plays in an adversarial system where he has no power to"
"go beyond what has been placed before him by the two adverse"
"parties  and  decide  the  matter  on  what  he  thinks  is  right  or"
"righteous.  But a partition action is an action in rem (as opposed"
"to an action in personam), the Judgment of which is bound not"
"only  by  the  parties  to  the  case,  but  also  by  others  who  are  not"
"parties to the case."
"The  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  in  my  view,  should  not"
"have  allowed  the  evidence  of  the  2nd  defendant  to  be  led  in  the"
"absence of his Attorney on the purported basis that there was a"
"settlement  among  the  plaintiff  and  the  2nd  and  3rd  defendants."
"On the other hand, even if the Attorney of the 2nd defendant was"
"there, unless all the other parties were present or represented by"
