efendant had been present.  Thereafter, the Court has recorded"
"that: “It is informed that there is a settlement among the plaintiff,"
"and  the 2nd  and 3rd  defendants.   Hence  necessity does not  arise"
"to raise issues.  The 2nd defendant is called to give evidence.”2"
"The evidence of the 2nd defendant has then been led and closed"

"that day4 that the evidence of the 2nd defendant had been led by"
"the registered Attorney of the plaintiff (as the registered Attorney"
"for  the  3rd  defendant  has  purportedly  cross  examined  the  2nd"

"This in my view is unwarranted. It is significant to note that the"
"2nd  defendant  appeared 
in  person  on 
that  day  without  his"
"registered  Attorney.    The  registered  Attorney  for  the  plaintiff"
"ought  not 
to  have  done

the  permission  of 
the"

"until the proxy is revoked with the leave of Court, a party cannot"
"appear  in  person  and  make  applications  to  Court.    All  the  acts"
"relating 
to 
the  case  shall  necessarily  be  done 
through 
the"

the"

"the 2nd defendant (led by the registered Attorney of the plaintiff),"
"the 2nd defendant has stated that  “the shares shall be  allocated"
