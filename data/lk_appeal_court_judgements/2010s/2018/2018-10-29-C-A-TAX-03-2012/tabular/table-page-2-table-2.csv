"manufacture  and  sale  of Black  Tea,  Rubber,  Coconut,  Oil  Palm  and  other crops  and  therefore"
"generates income from both cultivation and  manufacturing. Accordingly, the profits declared by"
"the Appellant from the provision of management services for Namunukula Plantations Ltd.  was"
"proportionately charged  for income tax at the rate  of 15% and  35%  respectively for cultivation"
"and  manufacturing on the turn over basis  of Namunukula  Plantations Ltd."
"The Appellant appealed to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) who determined"
"that the Appellant is  not entitled to claim  the concessionary rate  under section  46  of the 2006"
"Act as it has not provided management services to Namunukula Plantations Ltd. The CGIR further"
"held that the Appellant  had  deducted interest expenses  amounting to Rs.  16,899,225 from the"
"taxable  income  when  it  could  not  do  so.  The  Tax  Appeals  Commission  (TAC)  confirmed  the"
"determination of the CGIR  and  hence the Case  Stated  was  referred to this Court by the TAC  on"
"the application of the Appellant."
