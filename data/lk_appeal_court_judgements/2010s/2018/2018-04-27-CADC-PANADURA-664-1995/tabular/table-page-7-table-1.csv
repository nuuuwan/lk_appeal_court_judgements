"by the  predecessors  of  the parties  to  this  case  as  separate lots.  The  evidence  of  the"
"parties  on this  material point has  not been evaluated by the trial Judge.  This  is  very"
"necessary to decide the exclusion of the Northern Portion from the corpus sought to be"
"partitioned, as claimed by the 4A Defendant."
"A clear finding  of the  Court is  not available  in the judgment of the  trial Judge  as  to"
"which portion of the land called Ambagahawatte, i.e., whether Lot A alone or Lot A and"
"B together is to be partitioned. The evidence of 4th Defendant is that there was a barbed"
"wire fence  separating the Northern portion from  the Southern Portion,  and his father"
"John removed it and shifted it to the North as  he wanted to plant on a portion of the"
"corpus  along  with a  portion  of  the  land  to  the  North.  This  evidence  is  not  clearly"
"analyzed  by  the  Court in  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  the  issue  raised  by  the  4A"
"Defendant as to the exclusion claimed by him was not proved."
"This creates a doubt in the mind of any reasonable person. If the 4A Defendant's father"
"had shifted the barbed wire fence  towards  North would the owners of the  Northern"
"land for the time being have permitted this?"
"A  party  may  say  anything  as  a  witness  to  his  advantage  but  in  evaluation  of  that"
