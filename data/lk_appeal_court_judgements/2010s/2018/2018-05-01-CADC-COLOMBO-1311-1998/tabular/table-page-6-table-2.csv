"view that any  objection to a defective proxy or absence  of a proxy  is  a jurisdictional  issue  and"
"must be raised  at the first opportunity. He  was  relying on  the judgement of lA.N. De Silva  c.J.  in"
"S.P.  Gunatilake v.  S.P.  Sunil Ekanayake. 18 However, in that case J.A.N.  De Silva c.J.  was of the view"
"that the total failure to file a proxy does  not in  any way effect the validity of the proceedings.  I"
"am  of the view that the same  reasoning is  applicable when  there is  a valid  proxy on  record and"
"another proxy is filed without duly revoking the original  proxy. Therefore, any objection on  that"
"ground  need  not  have  been  raised  before  the  District  Court  as  that  defect  did  not affect the"
"jurisdiction of the District Court."
