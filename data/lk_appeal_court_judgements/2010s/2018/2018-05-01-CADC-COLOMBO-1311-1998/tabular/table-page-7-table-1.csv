"One may contend that even though there are two proxies on record, court should accept and act"
"on  the  second  proxy as  the  intention  of the  litigant to  retain  the services  of a new  registered"
"attorney is clear. The same point can  be raised in a situation where the litigant acts on his behalf"
"while there is a registered attorney appointed by him to look after his interests. However, courts"
"have  consistently held that as  long as  a proxy is  valid  a litigant  must act through  his  registered"
"attorney and that he cannot perform any act in court relating to the proceedings. 19"
"Section  755  of the  CPC  sets  out the  manner in  which  a notice of appeal  and  petition of appeal"
"must be filed. Where there is a registered attorney on  record every notice of appeal and petition"
"of appeal must be signed  by that registered attorney. The failure to do so  is fatal. 20"
"For the reasons set out above, the registered attorney for the Plaintiff on the days that the notice"
"of appeal and petition of appeal were filed was Mr. W.H.  Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law. The"
"notice of appeal  and  petition of appeal  is  not signed  by  him. Instead  it is  signed  by Mr. Sajeewa"
"Gunaratne  whose  proxy  was  filed  as  the  registered  attorney-at-law  for the  Plaintiff while  the"
"proxy of Mr. W.H.  Bernard De  Soyza  Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff was  still in  force.  It is  trite"
"law  that court  cannot  recognize  two registered  attorneys  appearing for the  same  party in  the"
"same cause. 21Therefore, I am of the view that the notice of appeal and petition of appeal filed in"
