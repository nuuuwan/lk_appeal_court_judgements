"Several  aspects  of the litigation are  sought to be  protected by the procedure set out in  section"
"27(2)  of the cpc.  Once  a client appoints a registered  attorney to act on  his  behalf,  he  must be"
"able to take comfort in the fact that the registered attorney will continue to act for him and look"
"after his interests until he is  informed otherwise. 
In Daniel v.  Chandradeva12  the Supreme Court"
"emphasized the importance of the instructing attorney revoking the proxy only after warning the"
"client and  giving him a reasonable time to appoint another registered attorney. In fact,  prior to"
"Civil  Procedure Code  (Amendment) Act,  No.8 of 2017,  the registered attorney could not initiate"
"an  application for revocation of the proxy.  It had to be  done by the client.  The  court must have"
"clear notice of the registered attorney appointed to look after the interests of a party. The court"
"is also  duty bound to ensure that leave to revoke  a proxy is  not granted unless the client is fully"
"aware  of the  proposed  revocation.  Whether  an  application  for  revocation  of proxy should  be"
"allowed  or not is  a matter for the discretion of court. 13  In  view of the purposes of section  27(2)"
"of the CPC,  I am  of the view that the procedure set out therein is  mandatory in  nature."
"The question then is  whether the proxy of Mr. W.H.  Bernard  De Soyza Attorney-at-Law was duly"
"revoked.  In  this case  there is  no application in  writing signed  by the Plaintiff and  filed  in court as"
"required  by  section  27(2)  of the  cpc.  Court  did  not and  could  not have  granted  leave  for the"
"revocation  of the proxy on  27.10.1994 as  firstly, there was  no  written application signed  by the"
"Plaintiff as  required  by section  27(2)  of the CPC  and  secondly,  as  court rejected the application"
"of the  Defendant  to  dismiss  the  action  as  the  registered  attorney for the  Plaintiff  marked  his"
"appearance.  Clearly  court  considered  Mr.  W.H.  Bernard  De  Soyza  Attorney-at-Law  to  be  the"
"registered attorney of the Plaintiff when  proceedings ended on  27.10.1994."
"Trial  began  on  the  next  date  namely 16.2.1995 with  the  raising  of issues.  Journal  entry of that"
"date  shows  that  a new  proxy was  filed  on  behalf of the  Plaintiff. The  proceedings  of that date"
"the  registered  attorney-at-law  for  the  Plaintiff.  The 
indicate  that  Mr.  Sajeewa  Gunaratne  is"
"question 
is  whether 
this  amounts 
to  an 
implied 
leave 
for  the 
revocation  of  proxy  as 
in"
"Wanigaratna  v.  Dissanayake14  Weerasuriya  J.  held 
that  there  can  be 
implied  leave  for  the"
"12  (1994) 2 SrLL.R.  1"
