"The  Importance of procedural  law was  alluded to by A.R.B.  Amerasinghe J.  in  Fernando  v.  Sybil"
"Fernando and others 26in  the following pronouncement:"
"tiThe  concept of the laws of civil  procedure being a mere vehicle  in  which  parties should"
"be safely conveyed on the road to justice is misleading, for it leads to the incorrect notion"
"that the laws of civil procedure are of relatively minor importance, and may, therefore be"
"disobeyed or disregarded with impunity. The expression of a concern that the laws of civil"
"procedure must not be a juggernaut car that throws its passengers out to be  run over by"
"it,  I suppose,  was  figuratively meant to say that with greater force.  However,  with great"
"respect,  all that the dictum does is to obscure the role of the laws of civil  procedure: The"
"English  word  ""juggernaut""  is  derived  from  the  Hindi  word  ""Jagganath""  and  the Sanskrit"
"word ""Jaganatha"" meaning the lord or protector of the world. It was a title of Krishna, the"
"eighth  avatar of Vishnu.  There  had  been  for a long time,  especially at Puri  in  Orissa,  an"
"annual pageant in which an image of this deity was dragged in procession on an enormous"
"car under which devotees threw themselves to be  crushed."
