"According to the evidence  of the Plaintiff it is  clear that though she had gone  to her"
"parents'  home  with the  children,  she  would  often  come  to  see  the  Defendant  at  his"
"place  of  abode  during  weekends.  In  front  of society  they  comported  themselves  as"
"husband and wife without manifesting their differences. Did they put in an appearance"
"of a  Darby  and Joan?  Yet  the  learned  District Judge  of Colombo  did not believe  the"
"plaintiff's  story of constructive  malicious  desertion  on  the grounds  she  had urged in"
"paragraph  4  of the  plaint.  After  having  considered  the  evidence  of  the  Plaintiff,  the"
"learned District Judge has refused the reliefs prayed for by the Plaintiff. This appeal is"
"against that judgment dated 23.09.2000."
"In my view the grounds averred by the Plaintiff in paragraph 4  of the plaint have not"
"been established by sufficient evidence.  The subsequent conduct of both parties after"
"the  alleged  constructive  desertion  on  30.11.1994,  clearly  indicates  that  there  was  no"
"factum of constructive malicious desertion that could be deduced from any act on the"
"part of the Defendant. I would observe that there is not any tittle of evidence suggestive"
"of the fact that the Defendant ever neglected the welfare of his children."
"In the event that the husband was at fault  in driving the wife out of the matrimonial"
"home, the bona fide attempts made by the husband for reconciliation cannot be ignored"
"lightly. A Divisional Bench of the Supreme Court declared in Muthukumaraswamy v."
