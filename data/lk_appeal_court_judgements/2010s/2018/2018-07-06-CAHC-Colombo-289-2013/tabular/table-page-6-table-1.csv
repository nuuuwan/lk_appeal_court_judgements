"The above contradictions are relating to the time, further there are other contradictions"
"were also  noticed in the evidence of PW1 
IP  Rangajeeva."
"He  submitted all  the officers who went on the said  raid  were  clad  in  ciwies (Page  33)"
"but subsequently  he  said  that PC  Sarath  was  in  uniform.  He  admitted  it as  a mistake"
"(page 63  and  64)"
"The van,  they travelled was  bearing registration number HD2739. Whilst he was  giving"
"evidence  he  said  HD2729  (page  90),  HD2709  (page  91).  It is  in  record  that the  Police"
"Officer had  given incorrect numbers."
"According  to PW1's  entry when  this  started the vehicle was  showing a running  meter"
"of 315928,  and  when they returned  it was  315833.  (He  confirmed this on  page 91,  92,"
"93,  and  94.)  He  also  admitted  that  those  numbers  were  subsequently  inserted  in  a"
"different  coloured  ink  (page  95).  The  defence  counsel  questioned  the  witness,  after"
"examining  and  showing  the  police  information  book,  he  admitted  that  there  is  an"
"alteration/  interpolation  of numbers  with  different  ink.  He  admitted  that  this  was  a"
"mistake (page 94 &  96).  He also submitted that there is  no log book. After questioning"
"he  revealed  that there is a log book with the driver of the van."
"PW1,  said  to court that he weighed the brown coloured  powder with the grocery bag"
"and 
it  weighed  106.500  grams.  When 
it  was  weighed  by  the  government  analyst"
"without the  bag  it weighed  106.73  grams.  When  a person  weighs  a powder without"
"the  bag  it should  be  less  and  not more.  SI.  M.B  Samarakoon  gave  evidence and  told"
"the court that he took a parcel  from  PW1  Rangajeeva  and  it weighed  106.600 grams."
"The difference between these weights are minimal but there is a difference to be noted."
"Even though the differences are minute, the numbers which are different to each other"
"is  noted."
"When  PW1  gave  evidence,  he  said  this  incident had  occurred  on  26/09/2008,  but he"
"told  the  court  that  he  handed  over  the  suspect  to  the  reserve  on  the  28th
,  and  on"
"another  occasion  the  27th
.  There  are  entries  made  by  him  in  the  information  book"
"shown  to  him  and  questioned.  Initially,  he  denied  but  subsequently  admitted  those"
"entries.  He  explained to court that those were  mistakes."
"PW2  8595  Weerasuriya  who  accompanied  I.P  Rangajeeva  in  the  raid  gave  evidence"
"and  corroborated  a major portion of the  evidence.  There  are  contradictions  between"
"these two witnesses  regarding their placement of officials at the scene  of the raid."
"He  told  court that  he  went to Zainstan  at  16:30  hours  (page  160).  Subsequently,  he"
"informed  court that they went to the  said  place  at  13:30.  He  categorically told  court"
"that his entries are correct and there are no mistakes. Under cross examination, he said"
"that  the  accused  was  arrested  at  15:00  hours  (page  190  &  202).  Considering  his"
"evidence there are certain contradictions being observed."
