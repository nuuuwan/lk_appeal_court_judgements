"The Respondents have drawn attention  of court to  the  unexplained  delay  in"
"filling this application.  The Petitioner has  filed  this action on or about  30115/2014,"
"subsequent  to  the  registration,  which  took  place  on  12110/2012.  It is  well  settled"

"is  fatal  to the application.  In  the  instant case the  court observes delay in  filling this"
"action, which has not been explained by the  Petitioner."
