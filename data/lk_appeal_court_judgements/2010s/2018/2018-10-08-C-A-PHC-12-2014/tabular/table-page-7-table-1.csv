"Rule  49(xii)(a)  was  made  under  the  Co-operative  Societies  Law  NO.5  of 1972  by  the  relevant"
"Minister of the central  government.  He  was  exercising a power given  under a law in  the whole"
"country and not only within the Central Province. Hence it could not have been the subject matter"
"of a direct  attack  as  to its  vires  in  the  Provincial  High  Court  of the  Central  Province  by  way  of"
"judicial  review.  There  is  a general  rule  in  the  construction  of Statutes  that what  a  Court  or"
"person  is  prohibited from  doing  directly,  it may  not do indirectly or in  a  circuitous  manner"
"[Bandaranaike v.  Weeraratne and Others (1981)  1 SrLL.R.  10 at page  16]. Therefore,  I am  of the"
"view that the vires  of Rule  49(xii)(a)  is  not open  for collateral  attack in  proceedings  before the"
"Provincial  High  Court.  This  finding  is  sufficient  to  reject  the  argument  made  by  the  learned"
