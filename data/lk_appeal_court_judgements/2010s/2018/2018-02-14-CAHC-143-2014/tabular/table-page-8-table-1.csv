"When evaluating circumstantial evidence  it  is  a well-established principle that if"
"an  inference  of guilt  is  to  be  drawn  from  circumstantial  evidence  it  must be  the"
"one  and only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that the accused committed"
"the offence.  This \vas discussed in  the following cases;"
"In the  case  of AG Vs.  Potta Naufer &  others  2007(2)  SLR  144 Thilakawardena"
"J held that;"
"'When 
relying  on  circumstantial  evidence 
to  establish 
the  charge  of"
"conspiracy to commit murder and the  charge of murder, the proved items"
"of circumstantial  evidence  when  taken 
together  must 
irresistibly  point"
"towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.'"
"In  the  case  of Kusumadasa  Vs.  State  2011(1)  SLR 240  Sisira  de  Abrew  J has"
"held that;"
"'The prosecution must prove  that  no  one  else  other than the  accused  had"
"the  opportunity  of committing  the  offence.  The  accused  can  be  found"
"lS 
if the  proved 
items  of circumstantial  evidence 
guilty  only  and  only"
"consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.'"
"Also  in  the  case  of Sarath  Fernando  V s.  Attorney  General  2014  (1)  SLR  16  it"
"was held that;"
"'In  order 
to 
justify 
the 
inference  of  guilt 
from  purely  circumstantial"
"evidence  the  inculpatory  facts  must  be  incompatible  with  the  innocence"
"of the  accused  and  incapable  of explanation  upon  any  other  reasonable"
"hypothesis  than  that of his gui It.'"
