"We  are  unable to understand the views/ observation  made  in  the  last column  of the"
"PMR by the JMO. He is also from the same health authority and  he should have access"
"to all  medical records of the deceased  including the Bed  Head Ticket (BHT)  at the time"
"of the  Post  Mortem  or before  he  prepared  the  report.  We  are  also  confused,  as  the"
"appellant, of the observation of the JMO.  Especially the conclusion he came,  regarding"
"the  availability of evidence  of assault.  The  only assault was,  slapping  before  53  days,"
"the  maximum  would  be  a contusion  and  it could  not stand  for that long. All  injuries"
"other than the injury on the back of the head were caused  during the treatment at the"
"hospital. JMO was  the best person to identify,  understand and  provide explanation to"
"those injuries. Which is  not available in the PMR."
