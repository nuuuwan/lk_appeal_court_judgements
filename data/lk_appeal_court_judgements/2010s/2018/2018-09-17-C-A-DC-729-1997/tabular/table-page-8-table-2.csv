"investigate the title of the parties to the case to its satisfaction."
"In Peris vs Perera (1896) 1 N.L.R 362 Bonser, C. J.  held as follows:"
"""It is  obvious  that  the  court ought not  to  make a decree,  except it is perfectly"
"satisfied that  the  persons  in  whose favour  it  makes  the  decree  are  entitled  to"
"the  property.  The  court  should  not,  as  it seems  to  me,  regard  these  actions  as"
"merely to  be decided on issues raised by and between the parties."
"The first  thing the Court has  to  do  is  to satisfy itself that the plaintiff has  made"
"out his  title, for,  unless he makes out his  title, his action  cannot be maintained;"
"and he  must prove his  title strictly, as  has  been frequently  pointed out by  this"
