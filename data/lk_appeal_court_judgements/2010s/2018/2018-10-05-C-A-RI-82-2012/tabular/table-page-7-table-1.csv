"the  presence  of  a  Notary  and  two  or  more  witnesses  present  at"
"the  same  time  who  attested  the  execution?    The  answer  shall"
"obviously be in the negative."
"During  the  trial  a  witness  from  the  Land  Registry  has  been"
"called  to  prove  that  Notary  Ganeshan  has  not  carried  out  his"
"Notary practice at the time of the alleged execution  of the Deed"
"No. 2446 marked 3V6.  That witness has further stated that the"
"said Notary has only executed Deeds up to  Deed No.1383.  The"
"learned  District  Judge  has  not  drawn  his  attention  to  this  vital"

"Notary, on the same day, after the impugned Deed No.2446, has"
"executed  another  Deed,  No.2447,  in  favour  of  the  plaintiffs  as"
"seen from the Land Registry extracts.  In reference to this Deed"
"No.2447,  the  3rd  defendant,  in  his  evidence  has  stated  that  he"
"sold  one  of  his  properties  to  the  plaintiffs  by  that  Deed.6  It  is"
"curious to note that the 3rd defendant has never produced such"
