"There  are  four  executants  to  this  Deed.    They  are  the  1st-4th"
"plaintiffs.  The 1st plaintiff is the mother and the other three are"
"her  children.    On  the  third  page  of  the  Deed  the  signatures  of"
"1st-4th plaintiffs can be seen."
"Even  though  the  1st  plaintiff  in  her  evidence  has  admitted  the"
"signatures,  she  has  categorically  stated  that  she  never  knew"
"what she was signing for and it was never signed before a Notary"
"by 
the  name  of  Ganeshan. 
  The  Deed 
is  handwritten 
in"
"English―a language in which they are illiterate."
"The  1st  plaintiff  has  further  stated  that  the  4th  plaintiff  was  at"
"that  time  a  minor  and  he  never  signed  the  Deed,  but  someone"
"else wrote the 4th  defendant’s name on  the Deed as his (the 4th"
"Defendant’s) signature.  That part of evidence of the 1st plaintiff"
"has  not  been  contradicted  and  the  learned  District  Judge  has"
"accepted that evidence, but decided that, except the 4th plaintiff,"
"the rights of the 1st-3rd plaintiffs have been transferred to the 3rd"
"defendant on that Deed."
"It appears that the learned District Judge has taken the forging"
"of  the  4th  plaintiff’s  signature 
for  granted.  According  to  the"
"attestation  of  the  Deed,  all  four  executants  including  the  4th"
"plaintiff has signed the Deed before the Notary Ganeshan.  This"
"itself, in my view, casts serious doubt about the due execution of"
"the Deed."
"It  is  significant  to  note  that  the  3rd  defendant  did  not  call  any"
"other witness to prove the Deed."
"Section  68  of 
the  Evidence  Ordinance,  No.14  of  1895,  as"
