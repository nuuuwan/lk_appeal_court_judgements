"approval the following dicta of Lord Denning in Lazarus Estates"
"Ltd v. Bearely.16"
"No  Judgment  of  a  Court  or  order  of  a  Minister  can  be"
"allowed  to  stand  if  it  has  been  obtained  by  fraud.  Fraud"
"unravels  everything.  The  Court  is  careful  not  to  find  fraud"
"unless  it  is  specially  pleaded  and  proved.  But  once  it  is"
"proved it vitiates judgments, contracts, and all transactions"
"whatsoever."
