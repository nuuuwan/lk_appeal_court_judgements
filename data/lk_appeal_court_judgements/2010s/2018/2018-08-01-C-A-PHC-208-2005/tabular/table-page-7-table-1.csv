"In Kanagalingam v Jegatheswaran and another [(2009) 1 Sri.  L.  R.  159] this Court had to consider"
"whether section  32(2)  of the Judicature Act read with the Fourth Schedule prevented a Primary"
"Court from entertaining an  application when the parties stood in the relationship of tenant and"
"landlord. It was  pointed out by counsel for the appellant in that case that item 35  of the Fourth"
"Schedule referred to any 'Any action for rent and ej.ectment and proceeding under the Rent Law'."
"The  Court  in  this  case  very correctly pointed  out that it is  the  nature  of the  application  made"
"before the Primary Court that must be considered in deciding whether the court has jurisdiction"
