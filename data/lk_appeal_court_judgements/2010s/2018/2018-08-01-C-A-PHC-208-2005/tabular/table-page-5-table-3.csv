"the preservation of peace when such an order deals with a subject matter that is being dealt with"
"by a competent civil court."
"There  is  also  no  danger of a Primary Court's  order overriding  an  order/decree of a competent"
"civil  court. Section  74 of the Act  has  made specific provision to ensure that a decision  of a civil"
"court regarding a particular right or interest over a land trumps a temporary order made  under"
"Part VI  of the Act.  This  is  the case  even  when it comes to an  order relating to possession  made"
"under section  68.  Section  68(2)  states that  an  order  declaring  a person  entitled to possession"
"shall  subsist ""until such  person  or persons  are  evicted therefrom under an  order or decree of a"
"competent court""."
