"At  this  stage,  it  is  also  appropriate  to  consider  a  decision  which  has  dealt  with  the  scope  of"
"jurisdiction  of a  Primary  Court.  In  Mansoor and another v ole Avissawella  Police  and another"
"[(1991)  2 Sri.  l. R.  75]  a tenant cultivator was  evicted from a paddy land and sought restoration"
"of possession in terms of Part VI  of the Act. Justice Sarath Silva  {as  he was then} refused relief to"
"the tenant cultivator on the basis that he had an alternative statutory remedy under the Agrarian"
"Services  Act to secure  restoration  of possession  and  use  and  occupy the  paddy land.  The  ratio"
"decidendi of this judgment has  no applicability to the present case  since the Appellant does not"
"have an  alternative statutory remedy available to him to seek restoration of possession."
