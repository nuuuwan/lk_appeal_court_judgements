"Following adverse effects could be anticipated owing to"
"above stated activities,"
"(a)   as some heavy machinery have worked in the"
"area, certain instability could be originated in the"
"old bund due to vibration."
"(b)   the clayee material of the bund has been"
"disturbed and hence an increase rate of"
"seepage can cause failure of the bund."
"(c)   once the roots decay, cavities may develop"
"along these traces thus facilitating seepage"
"increase to cause failure of the bund."
"(d)   there could be a weak bond between the old"
"bund material and the new filling and this can lead"
"to slipping away a portion causing bund failure."
"(e)   some paddy fields cannot get irrigation water"
"from the tank as the field canal that supplied water"
"to these paddy fields has been completely"
"destroyed by now."
"(f)   now these seepage water can easily escape"
"through the newly introduced rock fragment layer"
"aggravating the seepage process."
