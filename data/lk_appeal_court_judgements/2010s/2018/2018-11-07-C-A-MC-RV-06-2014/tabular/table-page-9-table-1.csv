sking  that  the order for issue of  writ  should not stand  and  that"
"the  writ should be recalled.  It appears to me however that in the"
"first  instance,  upon  an  application  that  is  regular  and  in  proper"
"form, the Magistrate has no option but to make order for the issue"
"of the  writ.  I set  aside the order  made by the learned Magistrate"
"and  send  the case  back  with  the direction  that  writ be  issued  in"
"terms of section 7.”"
"By Act No. 45 of 1985, sub section 3 was introduced to section 7"
"of  the  Principal  Act.    It  reads:  “Nothing  in  this  Act  shall  be  read"
"and construed as precluding any person who claims to have been"
"unlawfully  ejected  from  Government  quarters  under  this  section"
"from  instituting  an  action  for  damages  or  other  relief.”    By  this"
"section,  the  legislature  has,  to  some  extent,  justified  making"
"eviction orders ex parte."
"I reject the second and third arguments."
"The application is dismissed with costs."
"The parties in CA/MC/REV/7/2014, CA/MC/REV/8/2014,"
"CA/MC/REV/11/2014, CA/MC/REV/12/2014,"
"CA/MC/REV/13/2014, CA/MC/REV/14/2014 shall abide by"
"this Judgment."
