"i
n Form B, there is a requirement to give little more reasons, in"
"that,  Form  B  says:  “State  whether 
the  period 
for  which 
the"
"Government  quarters  were  given  to  the  occupier  has  expired,  or"
"whether the occupier has been transferred from the station which"
"qualified  him  to  occupy  the  Government  quarters,  or  whether  the"
"occupier  to  whom  the  Government  quarters  were  originally  given"
"has died, or any other reason which is considered.”"
"In Balasunderam  v.  The Chairman, Janatha Estate Development"
"Board [1997] 1 Sri LR 83 at 88 it was held that: “The reasons set"
"out 
in  Form  B  are  not  exhaustive  and  are  merely  by  way  of"
"illustration;  and  the  reasons  contemplated  at  (iv)  above  [which"
"means,  “any  other  reason  which 
is  considered”]  need  not  be"
"""ejusdem  generis"".  The  relevant  question  is  whether  such  reason"
"is  adequate,  which  is  a  matter  that  would  depend  on  the  facts"
"and  circumstances  of  each  case.  In  interpreting  the  Act,  I  have"
"adopted 
the 
principle 
that  words  are 
to 
be 
construed 
in"
"accordance  with the intention as expressed, having regard to the"
"object  or  policy  of  the  legislation,  which  in  the  instant  case  is  to"
"facilitate the speedy recovery of Government quarters.”"
"Clause (d) of the Tenancy Agreement, which spells out one of the"
"several  obligations  to  be  discharged  by  the  Lessee,  reads  as"
"follows:"
"“To  vacate  the  demised  premises  immediately  the  Lessee  ceases"
"to be employed at the Prima Floor Milling Complex at Trincomalee."
"A  certificate  from  the  District  Manager  of  Prima  Ceylon  Limited"
"that  the  Lessee  has  ceased  to  be  an  employee  of  Prima  Ceylon"
"Limited shall be treated as final and conclusive for purpose of this"
