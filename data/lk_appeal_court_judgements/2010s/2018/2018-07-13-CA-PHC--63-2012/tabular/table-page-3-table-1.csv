"However,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had,  without  calling  the  matter  in  open  court  on"
"02.07.2012 as requested by the Appellant, made order in chambers on 25.06.2012 dismissing the"
"revision  application. The  reasons given was that the Appellant had failed to disclose reasons for"
"the delay in filing the petition, the petition has failed to disclose that reliefs sought in the revision"
"application cannot be obtained in a civil action, there was an alternative remedy for the Appellant"
"and  that  no  exceptional  circumstances  are  set  out  in  the  petition.  Hence  this  appeal  by  the"
"Appellant."
"The  fundamental  question  that  arises  for  determination  is  whether  it was  competent for the"
"learned  High  Court Judge  to have  made  the impugned  order in  chambers  without hearing the"
"Appellant in support of the revision application."
"The  learned  Counsel  for the  Respondent  raised  a preliminary  objection  that this  Court  cannot"
"entertain the appeal  because the dispute has  been  gone into in the District Court in  a partition"
"action and an  appeal lodged against the judgement which is  pending."
"Two issues engage  my mind on the fundamental question."
"Firstly,  Article  106(1)  of the Constitution  mandates  that the sittings  of every  court  established"
"under the Constitution or ordained and established by Parliament shall  subject to the provision"
"of the Constitution be held in public, and all persons shall be entitled freely to attend such sittings."
"The  rule  requiring  public  sittings  is  a fundamental  constitutional  provision  in  the  exercise  of"
"judicial power as  in terms of Article 4(c) of the Constitution it is the judicial power of the people"
"that  is  exercised  by  Courts.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  people  whose  judicial  power  is"
"exercised by Courts should have unimpeded access to court sittings.  The exception to this rule is"
"found in Article 106(2) of the Constitution which has no application to the instant matter."
