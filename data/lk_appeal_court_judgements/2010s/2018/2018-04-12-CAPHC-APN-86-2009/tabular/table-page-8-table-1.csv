"been that these powers will be exercised if there is  an alternative remedy available"
"only if the existence of special circumstances are urged necessitating the"
"indulgence of this court to exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of"
"special circumstances does not exist,  then this  court will not exercise its powers in"
"revision.  The  appellant has not indicated to the court that any special"
"circumstances exist which would invite this court to exercise its powers of revision,"
