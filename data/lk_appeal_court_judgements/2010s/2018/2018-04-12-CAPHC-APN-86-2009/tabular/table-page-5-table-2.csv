"Thus submitted by the petitioner that if,  even when a person deceives another into"
"contracting a bigamous marriage he is not liable to pay maintenance, then the"
"petitioner in the instant case, who did not deceive the respondent and had informed"
"her of his previous marriage thus being acquitted for lack of mens rea, has no"
"reason to pay maintenance since no court can validate a marriage which is a nullity"
"abinitio. Therefore, the respondent lacks locus standi to maintain the application."
"But in the abovementioned case, HonJustice shiranee Thilakawardane specifically"
"mentioned as  follows:-""The law as  it strrrzds.  only penalizes the bigamous conduct"
"and fails  to  take into account of the plight of the victim spouse,  namely the"
"innocent spouse in such situations.  Not only does  it fail to provide substantive"
"protection for the victim spouse,  it also supplies the guilty party with advantageous"
"gain by such person's wrongful act.  This  anomaly militates against the principles"
"of justice and equity as well as thefundamental principle of legal jurisprudence"
