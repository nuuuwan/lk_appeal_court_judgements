this  court  cannot  segregate

"and  to the  same  incident or to a different subject  matters or different incidents."
"For  example,  they  may  belong  to  same  kind  of offenses  committed  within  the"
"course  of one  year.  Therefore, the different offenses described  in  a given  marked"
"warrant  of commitment  may  not  be  from  alternative  charges  in  a charge  sheet."
"Therefore, 
the  petitioner  has  not 
tendered 
to 
this  court 
the  most 
relevant"
"documents with regard  to the cases  he  has  referred  to in  his  petition, namely the"
"charge  sheets  and 
the  sentencing  orders  except  the  sentencing  orders  he  has"
"submitted in  cases  No.  58964 (P4A)  and  No. 57799(P4C).  He  has  not submitted for"
"perusal  of this  court any of the  charge  sheets  related  to any of the  cases  he  has"
"referred

application.  Though 
the 
petitioner  has  marked 
certain"
"proceedings  belonging to case  No.  56252  (P4B)  it does  not contain the sentencing"

there  are 
two  counts  described

"court sufficient material to decide  whether they belong to the same subject matter"
"and/or  same 
incident  or  they  belong  to  separate  incidents  or  separate  subject"
"matters. 
On 
the  other  hand,  each  of  P3A  and  P3C  warrants  of  commitment"
"describes two counts  under ""particulars of offences""  but the  proceedings  related"
"to them and the proceedings related to P3G, namely P4A, P4B and P4C clearly show"
