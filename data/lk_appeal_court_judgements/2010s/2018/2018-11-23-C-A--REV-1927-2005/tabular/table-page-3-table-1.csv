"T
his  has  not  been  established  by  any  documentary  evidence"
"either before the District Court or before this Court.  Even if it is"
"true,  it  is  clear  from  the  proceedings  that  the  8/8A  defendant"
"has  been  represented  by  her  Attorney-at-Law  throughout  the"
"trial."
"In  this  application,  the  8A  defendant  inter  alia  states  that  the"
"original  8th  defendant  died  on  17.09.1999  and  the  substitution"
"in  place  of  the  deceased  original  8th  defendant  had  not  taken"
"place  until 
the  Journal  Entry  131  dated  19.09.2005  and"
"therefore  Attorney-at-Law  Mrs.  Muguntenna  could  not  have"
"appeared 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
original 
8th 
defendant 
after"
"17.09.1999."
"This  kind  of  a  standpoint  was  never 
taken  up  by 
the  8A"
"defendant  in  his  application  made  to  the  District  Court  dated"
"30.11.2004 
(referred  to  earlier). 
  The  8A  defendant  has  not"
"tendered  a  copy  of  the  full  case  record  of  the  District  Court  for"
"this Court to ascertain the correctness of that assertion.  The 8A"
"defendant has tendered the Journal Entry 131 dated 19.09.2005"
"separately to say that substitution was done on that day.  That"
"is  a  misleading  statement.    According  to  that  Journal  Entry"
"dated  19.09.2005,  the  application  of  the  Attorney-at-Law  of  the"
"8A  defendant  was 
to  add 
the  8A  defendantâ€™s  name 
to 
the"
"amended  caption  and  not  to  substitute  the  8A  defendant  in"
"place of the 8th defendant.  There is no mention in that Journal"
"Entry  that  the  substitution  was  done  on  that  day.  When  the"
"proxy  was  tendered  and  on  what  basis  it  was  tendered  and  by"
"whom  it  was  tendered  and  when  the  substitution  was  in  fact"
"effected etc. have not been explained."
