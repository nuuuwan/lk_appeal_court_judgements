"But for the purposes of this application, the crucial question that needs to be posed"
"is  whether,  on  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  particular  case,  where 
the"
"Petitioner  has  sought  both  a  writ  of  certiorari  and  a  writ  of  mandamus, 
the"
"participation  and  assistance  of 
the 
intervenor  Chandrasena 
is  necessary  and"
"essential in order to adjudicate upon the issues immanent in the two reliefs that the"
"Petitioner Podihamine has sought."
"I am disinclined to think that the  presence  of the intervenor is  necessary for  this"
"purpose. The scope of inquiry in prerogative writs is whether the Respondents have"
"acted ultra vires or they owe a duty imposed by law. On the facts and circumstances"
"of  this  case, 
I  am  of  the  view  that  the  availability  of  the  writs  sought  could"
"efficaciously  be  adjudicated  upon  without  the  participation  of  the  Intervenient'"
"Petitioner. In the circumstances, the application for intervention is rejected."
