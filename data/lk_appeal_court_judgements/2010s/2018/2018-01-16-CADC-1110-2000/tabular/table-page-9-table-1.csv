"As  the  learned  district judge  correctly  observed,  evidence  led  at the  trial  does  not reveal  any"
"personal  knowledge of the 8th  defendant respondent with regard to the pedigree but the deeds"
"he  marked  as  8v1, 8v2 and  8v3 were not objected on  any ground at the time they were marked"
"or at the closure of the 8th  defendant respondent's case.  Therefore, these deeds can  be treated"
"as  evidence for all the purposes of this case.  On  25.03.1995 at page  3,  8th  defendant respondent"
"has  named  the  land  sought to  be  partitioned  as  Medawatta  alias  Medawatta  Pahala  Irawalala"
"which  is  described  as  the  second  land  in  8v2.  The  second 
land  in  8v2  is  Madawatta  Dakuna"
"Irawalala, boundaries of which this court earlier in this judgement found as  compatible with the"
"land  in 
land  sought to be  partitioned.( Though  the 8th  defendant respondent referred to the 2nd"
"8v2  as  the  land  sought to partitioned,  this  court observes  the cross  examination  thereafter by"
"the 6th  defendant respondent was  based on the other land named Medawatta Uthuru Irawalala)"
"As 8v1, 8v2 and 8v3 were not challenged, they prove that 8th  defendant respondent got 1/18th  of"
"the corpus which was once owned by Menerapitiya Hatharabage Lekamlage Punchi Manika who"
"is  referred  to  in  the  plaintif's  pedigree.  Though  there  was  no  sufficient  material  to  prove  Ran"
"Ethana  was the original owner for 1/3rd  as  described  by the  plaintiff in  his pedigree or 1/18th  of"
"the  land  devolved  on  aforesaid  Punchi  Manika  in  the  manner  described  in  the  plaint,  these  3"
"deeds prove that aforesaid  Punchi  Manika was the owner of 1/18th  before executing 8v3, which"
"fact  was  not  challenged  by  any  party.  Therefore,  afore  said  Punchi  Manika  referred  to  in  the"
"plaintiff's pedigree (not as an original owner) could have  been considered as  an  original owner in"
"the past by the learned district judge. Substituted parties may not be able to prove the pedigree"
"their  predecessors  presented  to  court,  but  it  is  the  duty of the  court  to  investigate  title.  The"

"owner of 1/18th  of the land and  it devolved upon the 8th  defendant respondent."
"Even  the  evidence  of the  4th  defendant  respondent  shows  that  he  does  not  have  sufficient"
"personal  knowledge to prove the complete  pedigree  presented  by the plaintiff in  his  plaint, on"
