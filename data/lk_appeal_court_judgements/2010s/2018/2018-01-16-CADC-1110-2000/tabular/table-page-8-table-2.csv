"boundaries 
to  Medawatta 
in  P2.  On 
the  other  hand,  boundaries 
to  Medawatta"
"Dakunu  Irawalala  in  8v1,  8v2  and  8v3  are  more  compatible  with  the  land  sought to"
"be  partitioned 
in 
the  plaint  and 
the  plans  made.  Most  probably 
the 
foot  path"
"described  as  the  northern  boundary  can  now  be  found  in  the  preliminary  plan  and"
"plan  number  1213A  as  a  road.  Eastern  boundary  of  Medawatta  Dakunu 
Irawalala"
"which 
is  described  as  Kaluhamige  watta 
in  8v1  8v2  and  8v3  can  be 
found 
in 
the"
"schedule  to  the  plaint,  plans  made  and  even  in  Medawatta  referred  to  in  Pl.  Even"
"the  southern  and  western  boundaries  to  the  Medawatta  Dakunu  Irawalala  in  8v1,"
"8v2  and  8v3  are  compatible  with  the  lands  sought  to  be  partitioned  in  the  plaint,"
"land  depicted in  the  plans  made for this case  and  land  described  as  Medawtte in  Pl."
"Therefore,  8v1,  8v2  and  8v3  show that Medawatte which  has  the Abayhamige  Watta"
"as  the  northern  boundary is  different from  the  lands sought to be  partitioned which"
"has  Kaluhamige  Watta  as  the  eastern  boundary like in  Medawatta Dakunu  Irawallala"
"in  8v1  8v2  8v3.  For the  reasons  mentioned above  it is  my considered view that there"
"was  no sufficient evidence  led  before the  learned  district judge to prove  Medawatta"
"in  P2  and  P3  refers  to  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  and  there  was  evidence  to"
"show that it is  a different land."
