"sufficient grounds  to  presume  land  shown  to the  north  of  preliminary  plan  number"
"1213  and  plan  number  1213A,  namely  Uthurumedawatta 
is 
the 
land  named  Kiri"
"Ethanage  Watta  which  is  described  as  the  northern  boundary in  the schedule  to the"
"plaint and  Pl. Therefore,  it is  my considered  view that there was  sufficient evidence"
"before the  learned  district judge to  prove that 1/12 th  share  of the  land  sought to be"
"partitioned devolved  upon the original  plaintiff from the original  owner Bala  Ethana."
"Deed  number  3862  marked  as  P2  and  deed  number  23145  marked  as  P3  also  refers"
"to a transfer of a land  called  Medawatta  but  it should  be  noted that the Medawatta"
"referred 
to 
in 
these  2  deeds  are  of  an  extent  of  three  bushels  of  paddy  and"
"boundaries  defer  from  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  in  the  plaint  and 
in  the"
"plans  made.  Particularly northern and  eastern  boundaries in  P2  and  P3  are described"
"as  Abayhamige  watte  agala  and  Mohotti  Hamige  watte  galwetiya  or  galwaetiya"
"respectively  but  these  boundaries  are  not  compatible  with  boundaries  described  to"
"the north and east in the schedule to the plaint as  well  as  in the plans.  No  acceptable"
"evidence  has  been 
led 
to  prove 
that  those  descriptions 
too 
refer 
to 
the  same"
"boundaries.  In  such  a  back  drop  there  is  no  acceptable  evidence  led  to  prove  that"
"Bandara  Asswedduma  and  Dawaka  Kumbura  described  as 
the  eastern  boundary  in"
"P2  and  P3 
is  the  same  Assweddume  Kumbura  described  as  the  eastern  boundary  in"
"the schedule  to the  plaint and  the plans  made.  Furthermore, it can  be  observed that"
"in  deeds  marked  as  8V1,8V2  and  8V3  there  are  two  lands  called  as  Medawatta.  One"
"is  named  as  Medawatta  Uthuru  Irawalala  while  the  other  is  named  as  Medawatte"
"Dakuna 
Irawalala.  The 
land  called  Medawatta  Uthuru 
Irawalala  has  Abayhamige"
"watta  as 
its  northern  boundary  and  Galweta  as 
the  eastern  boundary.  These"
"descriptions  are  compatible  with 
the  northern  and  eastern 
lands  described  as"
"boundaries 
to  Medawatta 
in  P2.  On 
the  other  hand,  boundaries 
to  Medawatta"
"Dakunu  Irawalala  in  8v1,  8v2  and  8v3  are  more  compatible  with  the  land  sought to"
"be  partitioned 
in 
the  plaint  and 
the  plans  made.  Most  probably 
the 
foot  path"
"described  as  the  northern  boundary  can  now  be  found  in  the  preliminary  plan  and"
