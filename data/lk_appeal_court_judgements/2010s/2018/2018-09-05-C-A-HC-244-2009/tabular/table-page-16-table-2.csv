"The  Queen  73  N.L.R.  273  and Kumarasinghe v  The  State 77  N.L.R.  217.  In"
"the  appellate  Court  interfered  with  the 
Wickramanayake  v  The  Queen,"
"conviction purely on ~e basis that there was absolutely no direction t~ the"
"jury as to the alternative verdict of culpable homicide. The instant appeal is"
"in relation to  a 
trial before a Judge.  In Wickramanayake v  The  Queen,  the"
"Court of Criminal Appeal altered the verdict on the basis that there was no"
"distinction  made 
in 
the  summing  up  of 
the 
trial  Judge  between 
the"
"concepts of ""knowledge"" and ""murderous intention"" which had the effect"
"of a  possibility of convicting to a  lesser offence ""virtually withdrawn from"
"the jury"".  This is not the position  in the instant appeal."
