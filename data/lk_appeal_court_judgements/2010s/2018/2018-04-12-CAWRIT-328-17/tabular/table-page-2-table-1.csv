"The  Petitioner has  filed  this application in  this court praying for two prerogative writs namely,  a Writ of"
"Certiorari and a Writ of Mandamus. Through these remedies the petitioner expects to get the decision of"
"the pt Respondent dated 23.08.2017 (marked as X10)  quashed and to compel the pt and 2nd  Respondents"
"to hold a fresh  inquiry with regard to the land in question.  By X10  pt Respondent has come to the finding"
"that the 4th  Respondent, as the heir to the grantee, is entitled to the land in dispute."
"As per the grant at page 122 ofthe appeal brief marked as Xl, Kalubandage Ranbanda (in some documents"
"referred  to  as  Rajapaksha  Aberatne  Herath  Mudiyanselage  Ranbanda  or  R.A.H.M.  Ranbanda)  was  the"
"grantee  to  the  disputed  land.  As  per  the  petition,  on  the  request  of said  Kalubandage  Ranbanda  the"
"Divisional Secretary of Navagaththegama allowed the transfer ofthe disputed land to the petitioner, sister"
"of said  Kalubandage  Ranbanda.  Letter authorizing the transfer subject to certain conditions can  be found"
"at  page  166 of the appeal  brief and the letter granting permission  to transfer the said  land  according to"
"the draft deed  submitted to the authorities can  be  found  at  page  172 of the appeal  brief marked  as  Xl."
"the  death  certificate  of  said 
The  deed  of  transfer  stating  the  date  of  execution  as  03.06.2006  and"
"Kalubandage  Ranbanda  are  at  pages  132 and  126 of the  appeal  brief marked  as  Xl.  It should  be  noted"
"that as per the afore said death certificate said  Kalubandage Ranbada  died on 21.05.2006. Three affidavits"
"given  by the  relevant  Notary Public  and  the two witnesses to the  said  deed  of transfer stating that the"
"said  deed  of transfer was  in  fact written on  13.05.2006 are  found  at  pages  174,175 and  176 of the  said"
"appeal  brief marked  Xl.  The  Notary Public  in  his  affidavit tries to explain  the  change  of the date  in  the"
"deed was due to the fact that his clerk had collected a wrong letter instead of the letter of approval dated"
"10.05.2006 given  by the  Divisional Secretary that ought to have  been  attached to the deed. The  position"
"of the  Notary  Public  is  that  the  mistake  was  revealed  only  when  deeds  were  prepared  to  send 
for"
"registration. Therefore, he had to change the date ofthe deed as he had to get down the correct letter of"
"approval  after writing a letter to the petitioner. Section  31(26)  of the  Notaries Ordinance  provides time"
