"recalled  after  the  Petitioners  took  steps  to  extend  the  guarantee  until  15th"
"August  2012.  This  Court  observes 
that  neither  party  has  submitted  any"
"material to this Court with regard to the present status of the said guarantee."
"The  complaint  of the  Petitioners to this  Court  is  that the  officers  of Sri  Lanka"
"Customs 
did 
not  have 
the 
authority 
to  give 
directions 
and/or  make"
"endorsements  on  'PS'  with  regard  ·::0  the value  declared  by  the  Petitioners.  In"
"the  written  submissions  tendered  on  behalf  of the  Petitioners, 
it  has  been"
"urged that the customs duty must be  assessed  as  per the value declared  in the"
"Customs  Declaration and  that officers of Sri  Lanka  Customs  had  no jurisdiction"
"and/or  power  and/or  authority  to  adjust  the  value  declared  in  the  Customs"

"This  Court  must observe  at the  outset that the  Petitioners  are  not seeking  to"
"quash  any  decision  of  the  Respondents.  They  are  only  seeking

"'directions,  advise  or  endorsements'  on 
(PS'.  This  Court  has  examined 
the"
"several  endorsements  made  on  the ·reverse  of (PS'  and  observes  that none  of"
"the  endorsements  contain  any  decision.  They  are  merely 
internal  entries,"
"discussing the steps that need to be taken to determine the value of the goods."
"The  Respondents  have  taken  up  the  position  in  their Statement of Objections"
"that the value indicated  by the Petitioners was  not realistic and that additional"
"documentation was  called  from the  Petitioners to substantiate the value.  The"
"Respondents  have  stated  further that the  decision  of the  Additional  Director"
"General  of Customs  in  respect  of the  value  of the  goods  is  pending.  This  is"
"borne  out by  the final  two endorsements  made  on  the  reverse  of (P6'  on  15th"
"and  16th  November 2011 respectively, which reads as follows:"
