"tender procedure. In appeal, the Court of Appeal held that as the petitioner - respondents admit"
"that  they  made- an  application  and  participated  at  the  interview  but  were  not  selected,  the"
"petitioner-
respondents  having accepted the selection  criteria  are  not entitled to claim that the"
"method  of selection  is 
invalid.  It  was  further  held  that they  cannot  challenge  the  method  of"
"selection by way  of writ of mandamus directing a new method of selection."
"The question of granting a writ of mandamus as  prayed for by the Appellant does not arise since,"
"for the  reasons  set  out above,  he  is  not entitled to a writ of certiorari  quashing the decision  of"
"the 1st and or the second  respondent to award the tender in  respect of the stall  nos.  9 and  10 at"
"the Balangoda  public market to the 6th  Respondent for the year 2000."
