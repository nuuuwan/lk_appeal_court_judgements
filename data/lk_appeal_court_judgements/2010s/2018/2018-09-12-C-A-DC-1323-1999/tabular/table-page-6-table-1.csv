"After  the  conclusion  of  the  trial,  the  learned  District Judge  of  Matale  delivered  his"
"judgment dated 16.07.1999  answering the issues  in favour  of the Plaintiff and granted"
"the reliefs prayed for in the Plaint. It is against the said judgment of the learned District"
"Judge of Matale that the 1st and 2nd Defendants have preferred this Appeal to this Court."
"It has  to be  noted that the Substituted Plaintiffs  had been absent and unrepresented"
"before the Court notwithstanding notices on them."
"The main contention of the 1st and 2nd Defendants is that Surveyor Rajasekaram by his"
"commission plans has failed to depict the land described in the schedule to the Plaint,"
"but instead depicted the 1st and 2nd Defendants' land. Therefore if judgment and decree"
"are  entered  on  the  basis  of  the  said  plans  of  Surveyor  Rajasekaram,  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Defendants will be dispossessed from their own land. This has been the argument that"
"was run before this Court."
"This Court bears in mind the settled principle of law that 'in a rei vindicatio  action the"
"burden  is  on  the  Plaintiff  to  establish  the  title  pleaded  and  relied  on  by  him.  The"
"Defendant need not prove anything"" ~see Dharmadasa  v. Jayasena [1997]  3 Sri LR. 327."
