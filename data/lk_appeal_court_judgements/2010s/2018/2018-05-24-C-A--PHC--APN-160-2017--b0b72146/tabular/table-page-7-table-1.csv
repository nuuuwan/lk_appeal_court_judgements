"in  the Provincial  High  Courts.  Thus,  chapter XXIX of the Code  of Criminal"
"procedure Act  No.  15 of 1979 is applicable to the exercise of revisionary"
"jurisdiction  by the  Provincial  High  Courts as  well."
"According  to section  364 therein,  the Court can  examine the  record  of any"
"case  for the purpose of satisfying  itself as to the  legality or propriety of any"
"order passed  therein or as to the  regularity of the proceedings of such"
"Court. Thus,  three aspects,  which  a Court could  consider in  revisionary"
"proceedings,  have been  specified  by that section.  They are  legality,"
"propriety and  regularity."
"In the instant case there is no complain  about the last aspect i.e.  regularity"
"of the  proceedings."
"Moreover,  when  there is a right of appeal  provided  for by  law,  an  applicant"
"in  a revision  application  must show the  existence of exceptional"
"circumstances  for any intervention  by a revisionary Court.  Perusal  of the"
"Petition  shows that the grounds urged  therein  are  not acceptable as"
"exceptional  circumstances."
