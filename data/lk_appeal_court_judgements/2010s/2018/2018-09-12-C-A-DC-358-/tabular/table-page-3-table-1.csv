"It is  on  the  basis  of  the  above  items  of evidence  that  the  Counsel for  the  Substituted"
"Defendant~ Appellant has argued that compensation for improvements must be enhanced"
"to a sum of Rs.  200,000/~ vis~a~vis the sum of Rs.  50,000/~ that has been awarded by the"
"District Court."
"The  above  items of evidence  are  conjectural and do not bear out a rational basis  to the"
"enhancement that the Appellant has claimed.  If the market value of the house was worth"
"about 5 lakhs, it has not been established by acceptable evidence. In the circumstances, it"
"is my view that the order of a sum of Rs.  50,000/~ as compensation cannot be assailed."
"Thus I proceed to affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge of A vissawella dated"
"20.06.2000 and dismiss the appeal."
"JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"
