"countenance. It shows that she too wanted the marriage to continue."
"It is to be noted that even after the separation in November, 1994, the Plaintiff and the"
"Defendant, on many occasions, had been seen together. The Plaintiff has admitted these"
"events  in her evidence under  cross~examination. Firstly,  she  admitted that even  after"
"the separation she had gone with her children and lived with the Defendant.  She had"
"attended birthday parties with the Defendant.  She had also gone to see  a doctor with"
"the Defendant. This conduct on the part of the parties would show that neither of them"
"wanted to end their nuptial tie."
