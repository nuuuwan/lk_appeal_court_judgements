"Further, the Court could  not have granted a 10-acre land  to the  1st"
"Respondent in  that case  when  he  had only claimed  a 4-acre  land."
"Thus,  this Court is convinced  that both  the learned  Primary Court Judge"
"and the learned  Provincial  High Court Judge had failed  to consider the"
"aforesaid  pOints and  hence had  erred  in  their respective orders.  Therefore,"
"this Court cannot permit them  to stand  any longer."
"In these circumstances, this Court proceeds to set aside the order dated"
"2002-11 .. 26  of the learned Primary Court Judge of Tangalle,  as well  as the"
"order dated  2003-11-18 of the learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge."
