the  learned  trial  Judge  in  the course"
"of his  summing  up to the jury had  explained  the  law  relating  to dying  depositions in"
"the following  manner:"
"""This  is  a  very vital matter for  the reason  that under our law a statement made"
"by a man who  is  very seriously injured is  considered with great sanctity,  because"
"the  law assumes  that a  person  in  that position  will  not unnecessarily implicate"
"an  innocent man."""

they  do  not  relate

"32  of the  Evidence  Ordinance.  One  of the  salient  features  discernible
