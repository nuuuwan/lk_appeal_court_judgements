"s. Thurairaja,  PC.  J"
"This  is  an  appeal  by the Accused  - Appellant,  Welegoda  Don  Premasiri 
(hereinafter"
"sometimes  referred  to  as  the Appellant),  against  the  convictions  on  double  murder."
"The  Appellant  was 
indicted  at  the  High  Court  of  KUliyapitiya  by  the  honourable"
"Attorney  General 
for  committing 
the  murders  of  Sandara  Sadaralage  Rupika"
"Chandani 
and  Upasaka 
Lekamlage  Wijewardene.  After 
the 
trial 
the  Accused"
"Appellant was found  guilty on both counts and  sentenced to death."
"Being  aggrieved  with  the  said  conviction  and  sentence  the  Appellant  had  preferred"
"this appeal to the Court of Appeal  and  submitted following  grounds of appeal.  In  the"
"original  appeal  he  had  submitted the following  grounds of appeal  (the following  are"
"re-produced from the petition of appeal of the Accused-Appellant)."
"1)  Trial  conducted without a jury is  unfavourable."
"2)  The  evidence  given  by 
the  PW1 
in 
the  non-summary 
inquiry  cast  a"
"reasonable doubt in  the prosecution case."
"3) 
Learned  High  Court  Judge  misdirected  himself  by  not  considering 
the"
"material inter se  contradictions of the prosecution version."
