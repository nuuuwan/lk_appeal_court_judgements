"thereafter stated for the first time that the documents tendered by"
"the  3rd  respondent  to  support  his  claim  and  which  were  relied"
"upon by the 1st respondent to arrive at the figure are unreliable."
"Thereafter an inquiry has again been held and as seen from P9(b)"
"dated  23.12.2013  the  1st  respondent  has 
inter  alia  asked  the"
"petitioner  to  submit  the  documents  to  counter  or  contradict  the"
"documents  tendered  by  the  3rd  respondent  in  support  of  his  (the"
"3rd  respondent's)  claim.    No  such  documents  have  been  tendered"
"by  the  petitioner  at  the  inquiry  and  the  1st  respondent  by  letter"
"P11(a)  dated  11.08.2015  has 
informed 
the  petitioner 
that 
the"
"petitioner has no choice but to comply with P8(a)."
"Thereafter  the  petitioner  has  kept  silent  until  the  petitioner  got"
"summons 
from 
the  Magistrate's  Court 
to  appear  before 
it  on"
"22.01.2016 to recover the EPF dues."
"It  is  in  that  backdrop,  the  petitioner  has  filed  this  application  on"
"18.01.2016 
(just  4  days  before  the  Magistrate's  Court  case)  to"
"quash  P8(a)  and  obtained  a  stay  order  staying  the  proceedings"
"before the Magistrate's Court which is in operation until today."
"It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  petitioner  does  not  produce  any"
"document  to  counter  the  documents  of  the  3rd  respondent  even"
"before this Court."
"The position of the  petitioner before this Court is that the  burden"
"is fairly and squarely  on the  3rd respondent to prove his claim  at"
"the 
inquiry  before 
the  1st 
respondent,  which  has  not  been"
"discharged."
