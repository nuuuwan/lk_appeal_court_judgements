"“The policy of the law has been to allot to a co-owner the portion"
"which  contains  his  improvements  whenever  it  is  possible  to  do"
"so”1 unless “in doing so a fair and equitable division is rendered"
"impossible”2."
"If there was a difficulty to demarcate the boundary line without"
"demolishing a part of the house, the water tank, lavatory etc. of"
"the  1st  defendant,  the  surveyor  would  have  reported  it  to  the"
"Court 
and 
obtained

  Otherwise,

"surveyor  could  have  shown

"1st respondent to a letter consenting to such division, which the"
"1st defendant now says was obtained by misleading her.  Such a"

"the impression that the surveyor was bias in preparing the Final"
"Scheme of Partition."
"According to section 31(1) of the Partition Law, No.21 of 1977, as"
