f  the  land  to  be  partitioned.    The  1st  defendant  accepted  that"
"position and did not contest the case."
"There  is  no  dispute  that  out  of  the  land  described  in  the  2nd"
"schedule  to  the  plaint,  which  is  in  extent  1  Acre  1Rood  and"
"12.60  Perches,  72.50  Perches  have  been  acquired  by  the  State."
"This has been accepted by the plaintiff in his evidence and also"
"produced the relevant Gazette as P4."
"The  Preliminary  Plan 
is  the  Plan  No.189  prepared  by  Meril"
"Perera,  L.S.  marked  X.    However,  the  plaintiff  has  got  another"
"commission  issued  to  show  the  acquired  portion  by  the  State"
"with  precision.    That  commission  has  been  issued  to  Piyasiri"

though 
the  correct  course  of  action"

issue  that  commission  also  to  the

"the State) is still included in Lot 1 in Plan No. 1330 and that has"
"to be excluded.    The  argument of the learned counsel is simple"
"and  straightforward. 
  That 
is,  as  I  said  earlier,  there 
is  no"
"dispute  that,  out  of  this  land,  72.50  Perches  were  acquired  by"
"the  State;  and  the  surveyor  by  Lot  2 
in  Plan  No.1330  has"
"excluded  only  57.50  Perches 
thereby 
including  balance  15"
"Perches in Lot 1."
