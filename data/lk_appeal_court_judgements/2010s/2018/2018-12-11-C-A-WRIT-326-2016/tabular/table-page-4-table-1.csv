"Thereafter,  the  same  Chairman  by 
letter  marked  P13  dated"
"30.06.2016,  has  cancelled  the  above  appeal  decision  contained"
"in  P10  on  the  basis  that  the  Government  Auditor  (in  R1)  has"
"pointed  out  such  lessoning  of  punishment  is  not  permitted.  (ඒ"
"අයුරින්  දඞුවම්  ලිහිල්  කිරිමට  න ොහැකි  ව   බව  රජනේ  විගණකොධිපති  විසින්"
"නපන්වො දි ඇති බැවින්,  සමොාංක හො 2015.05.07 දි ැති ලිපිය මින් අවලාංගු කරමි.)"
"This in my view is completely unwarranted.  According to clause"
"25.7  of  the  Disciplinary  Code  of  the  1st  respondent  Corporation"
"marked P6, the decision of the appellate body is final.  According"
"to  clause  26.4,  the  appellate  body  is,  inter  alia,  permitted  to"
"consider the appeal on compassionate grounds. The Government"
"Auditor  cannot  compel 
the  appellate  body 
to  withdraw 
the"
"appeal decision."
"In any event, in my view, what is stated in the Auditor’s Report"
"R1 is  not factually correct.  On the first page of R1, it is stated"
"that an appeal against a disciplinary order made by the General"
"Manager  should  have  been  presented  to  the  Board  of  Directors"
"and  therefore  the  petitioner’s  appeal  directed  to  the  General"
"Manager  should  have  been  rejected.    This  is  not  correct.    The"
"petitioner is not an executive officer.  He is only a Field Officer."
"According to clause  3.3 of the  Disciplinary Code P6, the appeal"
"officer/appellate body in respect of employees who are not in the"
"executive  grade 
is 
the  Chairman. 
  The  Board  of  Directors"
"becomes the appellate body in respect of executive grade officers."
"R1 also says that the appeal had been amended by the General"
"Manager without submitting it to the Chairman.  It is not clear"
"what is meant by it.  Appeal decision P10 has been signed by the"
"Chairman. 
  R1 
further 
says 
that 
by 
P10, 
the 
original"
"punishment  contained 
in  P8  has 
indirectly  been  minimized."
