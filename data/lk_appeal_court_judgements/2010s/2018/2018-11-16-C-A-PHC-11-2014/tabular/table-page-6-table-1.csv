"In  conclusion I wish to advert to the following statement of Lord Donaldson of Lymington M.R.  in",""
"R.  v.  Panel on Take-overs and Mergers Ex.  P.  Guinness PIc [(1990) 1 Q.B.  146 at 177]:",""
"","""I  approach  this  appeal  by  reminding  myself that the judicial  review jurisdiction  of the"
"Court, 
and 
of 
this 
court 
in 
appeal, 
is 
a 
supervisory 
High","or 
""long 
stop"""
"","jurisdiction ... consistently with this ""Iong stop"" character, it is not the practice of the court"
"","to entertain an  application for judicial review unless and  until all  avenues of appeal  have"
"","been  exhausted,  at  least  in  so  far  as  the  alleged  cause  of complaint  could  thereby  be"
"","remedied.  The  rationale  for  this  self-imposed  fetter  upon  the  exercise  of  the  court's"
"","jurisdiction is  twofold.  First, the  point usually arises  in  the context of statutory schemes"
"","and if Parliament directly or indirectly has provided for an  appeals procedure, it is  not for"
"the  court  to  usurp  the  functions  of  the  appellate  body.  Second,","the  public  interest"
"","normally  dictates  that if the judicial  review  jurisdiction  is  to  be  exercised,  it should  be"
"","exercised  very speedily and,  given the constraints imposed  by limited judicial resources,"
"","this  necessarily involves  limiting the  number of cases  in  which  leave to apply should  be"
