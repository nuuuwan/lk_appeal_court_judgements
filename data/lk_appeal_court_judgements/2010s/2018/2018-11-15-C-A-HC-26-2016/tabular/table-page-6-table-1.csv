"We  carefully perused the  submissions and  the evidence  before the  Court.  We  do not"
"want to disturb the findings of the  Learned  Trial  Judge.  On  a careful  scrutinization  of"
"the evidence  before the trial judge, we  are  convinced  that there  is  sufficient material"
"for the trial judge to come to a conclusion."
"G.P.S.  de Silva, c.J.  in Alwis vs.  Piyasena  Fernando [1993  (1) SLR  119] held that,"
