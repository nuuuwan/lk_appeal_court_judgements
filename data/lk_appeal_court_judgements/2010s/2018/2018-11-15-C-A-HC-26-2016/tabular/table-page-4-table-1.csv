"In  Sumanasena v. Attorney General  [1999 SLLR  (3)  137] held that,"
"""Evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single solitary"
"witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court of law."
"In Welimunige John v. State (76 NLR 488) , G.P.A.  De  Silva J.  observed that,"
"""No  particular number of witnesses  shall  be required  for  the  proof of any fact."
"The  adequacy  of one  witness  to  prove  a  fact  in 
terms  of Section  734  of the"
"Evidence  Ordinance  will  hold good in  a case where only one witness is  available"
"to  the  party desiring  to  establish  a  fact,  and  where  only one  witness  is  called"
"even though others are also available."""
"I agree  with  the above judgments and  re-iterate that the evidence  must be  weighed"
"and  not counted.  Considering  the above facts,  I found  that the 2nd  ground of appeal"
"also fails  on its own  merits."
"The  3rd  ground appeal  is  that dying deposition was  not accurate.  Prosecution witness"
"No.2 is  the one who heard the dying declaration of the deceased.  The  wordings were"
"not  contradicted  at  any  point.  The  counsel  submits 
to  Court 
that 
it  cannot  be"
"accepted  because the others did not hear that."
"It is  evidenced  before the Trial  Court that prosecution witness  No.2 went first and  her"
"son  prosecution  witness  No.4  (Thangarasa  Nilan)  came 
later.  So,  what  she  heard"
"would  not  have  been  heard  by 
the  others.  Further 
this  witness  was  consistent"
"throughout and  never contradicted at any time."
"The 4th  ground of appeal  is that the prosecution witness  No.2 and 4 are contradicting"
"each  other.  Prosecution  witness  No.2  and  4  are  mother  and  son 
respectively."
