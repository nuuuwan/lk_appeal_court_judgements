"weapon  used  on the deceased  was  a blunt weapon.  When  shown  a rolling  pin which"
"was  recovered  on  a Section  27  (1)  statement,  the JMO  opined  it is  possible to cause"
"those  injuries  with  such 
instrument.  The  1st  deceased  had  fracture  on  her  ribs;  the"
"JMO confirms that,  it is  possible with kick on the ribs."
"There  are  many  other  materials  which  corroborate  the  evidence  of the  1st  witness."
"Therefore,  the finding  of the  Learned  Trial  Judge that the witness  is  worthy of credits"
"can  be accepted."
