"Considering this ground of appeal, we find that the police had  recovered  a rolling  pin"
"(a  cylindrical  wooden  object  used 
in  kitchen 
to  make 
rotti  or  chapatti). 
It  is 
the"
"contention  of the counsel  that,  recovering  the object after several  months cannot be"
"accepted.  The  council  submits  that  in 
the  light  of two  deaths  in 
that  family,  alms"
"giving and  using  of kitchen could have disturbed the place where it was  kept."
"The  using  of  kitchen 
items,  when 
the 
lady  of  house 
is  not 
there  will  be  very"
"subjective.  The  husband  of the  deceased  submits  that  he  did  not  use  the  kitchen"
"left  with 
the  visitors  who  used 
the  kitchen.  The  main  witness 
much.  Then 
it's"
"it  was  similar  to  that.  The  JMO  opined  most  of the 
described  the  object  and  says"
"injuries  could  have  been  caused  with  an  instrument like  the  rolling  pin.  The  Learned"
"Trial  Judge  had  comprehensively analysed  the acceptability of the statement and  the"
"production. And  he  had  come to his  own conclusion. As  we  discussed  earlier the Trial"
"Judge is  the  best person to see  the  production,  observe demeanour and  deportment"
"of witnesses.  When  the  Judge  concludes  that  he  accepts  the  evidence  we  have  no"
"to  disbelieve 
the  same.  When  we  consider 
the  submission, 
reasons  before  us"
"judgements  and  facts  of the  case,  we  find  that  there  is  no  merit  in  this  ground  of"
"appeal."
"The 
last  ground  of  appeal 
is 
that 
the  certain  prejudicial  evidence  against 
the"
"accused-appellant are  allowed.  The  counsel  is  not very  specific  in  his  submissions  of"
"this ground of appeal.  Regarding the main witness, the Learned  Trial Judge had  given"
"ample reasons to reject the evidence of the accused and  his witnesses."
"We  carefully considered  the judgement of the  Learned  Trial  Judge  and  we  observed"
"that  the  entire  trial  was  taken  up  before  the  same  judge  and  the  judgement  also"
