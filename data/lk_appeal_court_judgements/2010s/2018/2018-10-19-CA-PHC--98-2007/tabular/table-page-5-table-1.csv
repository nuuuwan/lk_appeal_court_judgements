"Correctness versus Lawfulness of the arbitral award"
"Before dealing with these individual contentions, it is necessary for this court to take cognizance"
"of the contention  of the  1st  Respondent  (Vide  sub-section  10 of the  pt Respondent's  written"
"submissions) that the Appellant is  attempting to challenge the 'correctness' as  opposed to the"
"'lawfulness' of the arbitral award by way of the High Court's writ jurisdiction. It is trite law that"
"a court exercising judicial  review  does  not concern  itself with the correctness  of the  decision"
"but only with  its  lawfulness.  [Nicholas  v.  Macan  Markar  Limited (1985)  1 SrLL.R.  130 at  139]."
"The scheme of the Cooperative Society Law also indicates that the 'correctness' or merits of an"
"arbitral award is  left to be  determined on appeal  by the Registrar of Cooperative Development"
