"in  the  first  schedule,  the  Public  Service  Commission  has  retained"
"its authority."

"Ministry  is  empowered  to  interdict  a  public  officer  on  certain  acts"
"of misconduct subject to the covering approval of the Disciplinary"

the"
"petitioner  that 
interdiction  was  made  by  the  Secretary 
to  the"
"Ministry  without  any  authority  and  therefore  is  a  nullity  is  not"
