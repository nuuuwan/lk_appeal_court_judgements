"Therefore,  I hold that order given by the Learned District Judge  is  not a  final"
"order and the Appellant should have filed  a leave to Appeal Application under"
"section  754(2)  instead  of filling  an  appeal  under  section  754(1)  of the  Civil"
"Procedure Code."
"For the forgoing reasons,  I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the"
"Learned District Judge;  therefore, the appeal is  dismissed without costs."
