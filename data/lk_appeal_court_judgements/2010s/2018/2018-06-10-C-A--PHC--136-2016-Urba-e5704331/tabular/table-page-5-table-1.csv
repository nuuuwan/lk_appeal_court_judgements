"","The Provincial  High  Court of Western  Province  holden at Colombo,  upon"
"","an  application  for revision  filed  by the  Respondent,  has by its order dated"
"","2016-09-13, directed that a course of action  had  arisen  for the Respondent"
"","to recover compensation  and to file  separate action  in a Court of law for"
"","recovery of damages and  compensation."
"","This Court observes that the fundamental  basis upon which  the  learned"
"",""
"â€¢","Provincial  High Court Judge had  proceeded to arrive at the  impugned"
"","conclusion,  is the alleged  failure to serve summons on  the Respondent."
"","However, this Court is of the view that the  learned  Provincial  High  Court"
"","Judge had  clearly misdirected  himself when  he had concluded that the"
"","Petitioners had  defaulted serving  summons at least by way of  substituted"
"","service. The record  bears testimony to the fact that the Petitioner indeed"
"","has served  the summons on  the  Respondent by way of substituted service."
"","The journal entries dated  2013-02-15,  2013-03-08  make this position"
"","amply clear.  Unfortunately, the  learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge had"
"","failed  to focus  his attention on  them.  In these circumstances, this Court is"
"","of the view that the order dated  2016-09-13  pronounced  by the  learned"
"","Provincial  High  Court Judge is clearly erroneous and therefore should  not"
"","be permitted to stand."
