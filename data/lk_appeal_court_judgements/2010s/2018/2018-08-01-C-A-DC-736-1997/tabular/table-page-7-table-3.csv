"However,  the  learned  Additional  District Judge  has  concluded  that although  lots  4 and  5 in"
"plan  no.  422  is  identjfied as  part of ""Innawatta"" lots 1, 2 and  3 of plan  no. 422  shows ""Maha"
"Arambe Watta"". The record is devoid of any evidence supporting this conclusion. The learned"
"Additional District Judge does not refer to any evidence from which he draws this conclusion."
"P.B.  Dissanayake  Licensed  Surveyor who prepared  plan  no.  422  was  not called  as  a witness."
"The  conclusion  drawn  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  contradicts  the  evidence"
"contained  in  the  said  plan.  In  fact,  nowhere  in  the  amended  plaint  does  the  Respondent"
"identify the  land  in  dispute as  IIMaha Arambe  Watta"".  The  schedule  to the amended  plaint"
"identifies the land in  dispute as  ""Maha Arambe Hena""."
"For the foregoing reasons,  I am  of the view that the Respondents action must fail for want of"
"identjfication of the corpus."
