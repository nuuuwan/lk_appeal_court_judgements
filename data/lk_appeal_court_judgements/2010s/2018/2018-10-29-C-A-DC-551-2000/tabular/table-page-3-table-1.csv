"In  pursuance  of  the 
first  argument, 
learned  counsel 
for  the"
"appellants  has  quoted  the  section  187  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code and two Judgments.  That is all he has done.  There is no"
"dispute  to  accept  it  on  principle,  but  I  cannot  understand  on"
"what basis the learned counsel for the appellants states that the"
"learned  trial  Judge  has  not  complied  with  section  187  of  the"
"Civil  Procedure  Code  when  the  learned  trial  Judge  has  given"
"adequate  reasons  to  her  decision.    Conversely,  it  is  the  learned"
"counsel  who  has  not  given  any  reason  why  he  says  that  the"
"learned  trial  Judge  has  not  complied  with  section  187  of  the"
"Civil Procedure Code."
"The first argument of the appellants is wholly devoid of merit."
"The  second  argument  of  the  appellants  is  no  better.    It  is  true"
"that the plaintiffs have described the portion of land they claim"
"by  extent  and  boundaries  sans  the  name  of  the  land  in  the"
"schedule to the plaint.  In the plaint the land they claim has not"
"been  identified  by  way  of  a  Plan.    However,  before  the  answer"
"was  filed,  the  plaintiffs  got  a  commission  issued  to  properly"
"identify  the  portion  of 
land  they  claim. 
  It 
is  thereafter  the"
"defendants filed the answer, and in the answer, they referred to"
"the  said  Plan.    Then  at  the  trial,  the  plaintiffs  raised  an  issue"
"whether  the  land  described  in  the  schedule  to  the  plaint 
is"
"depicted  as  Lot  1  in  the  said  Plan―vide  issue  No.2.    This  issue"
"has  been  accepted  without  any  objection  and  answered  by"
"learned  trial  Judge  in  the  affirmative  in  the  Judgment.    There"
"was  no  issue  raised  contesting  the  identification  of  the  land  at"
"the trial."
"It  is  trite  law  that  “the  case  is  not  tried  on  the  pleadings,  once"
"issues are raised and accepted by the court the pleadings recede"
