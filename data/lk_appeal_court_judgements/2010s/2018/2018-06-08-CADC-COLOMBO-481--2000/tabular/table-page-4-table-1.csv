"execution  of the  Plaintiffs  Deed.  Since  the  said J .A.  Anthony  Mersalin  de  Saram"
"had lawfully transferred his title  to the Defendant in  1980, he could not have had"
"any  title  whatsoever  to  convey  to  the  Plaintiff in  1986.  It was  the  submission  of"
"Mr.  La!  Matarage  that the  purported  transfer to  the  Plaintiff by  Deed  No.  828  on"
"5 th  September 1986 could not have vested the Plaintiff with any title."
"Then the question arises as to whether the Plaintiff established his title to the land"
"in  question. 
It  was  a 
declaration  of 
title 
that 
the  Plaintiff  sought  and 
the"
"Defendant challenged the  Plaintiffs Deed  No.  828 dated  5th  September  1986 as a"
"fraudulent  deed. 
In 
the  circumstances 
it 
is 
incumbent  upon 
the  Plaintiff  to"
"establish his deed as a  genuine deed and prove his title.  Due execution of the deed"
"has to be established and I had occasion to extensively deal with the requirements"
"of  due  execution  of  a  deed

"Vidanalage  Nandasena (CA  Case  No  303/2000  (F)  decided  on  26.09.2016)  and"
"the  pith  and  substance  of  the  decision 
is 
that 
the  due  execution  could  be"
"established by adducing the evidence  of at least one  attesting witness in terms of"
"section  68  of the  Evidence  Ordinance.  In  W(Jegoonetilleke  v.  W(Jegoonetilleke"
"60  N.L.R  560  Basnayake  C.J  observed  that  a  notary  who  attests  a  deed  is  an"
"attesting witness within  the  meaning of that expression  in  Sections 68 and 69  of"
"the  Evidence  Ordinance.  Neither  the  Notary  nor  the  Transferor  was  led  by  the"
"Plaintiff to  discharge  his  burden.  This failure  on the  part of the  Plaintiff becomes"
"more  pronounced in light of the fact that the Plaintiffs Deed bearing No.  828 and"
"dated  5th  September  1986  was  marked  subject  to  proof.  This  would  only  go  to"
"show that no title ever passed to the Plaintiff."
"Having thus culpably failed to establish due execution and title,  the Plaintiff failed"
"to  produce  any  document  to  establish  that  he  had  registered  the  deed.
