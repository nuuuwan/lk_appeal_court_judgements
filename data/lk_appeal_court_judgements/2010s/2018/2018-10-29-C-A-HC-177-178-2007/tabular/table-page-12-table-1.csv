"It is  clear  from  the  perusal  of  the  summing  up  that the  trial  Court"
"invited the attention of the Jury to the submissions made by the Appellants"
"in  relation 
to 
the  concepts  of  similar  and  common  intention  before 
it"
"ventured  to  offer  directions  on  the  point.  Having  reminded  them  on  the"
"submissions  of  the  Appellants, 
the 
trial  Court  directed 
the  Jury  to  an"
"illustration  and  had  dealt  extensively  on  this  aspect  particularly  at  page"
"979,  where  it  clearly  directed  them  that  common  intention  and  similar"
"intentions  are  two  distinct concepts.  The  trial  Court also  directed  them of"
"the  instances  where  there  is  common intention and where there  is  similar"
"intention.  It  further  directed 
them  when  a  similar  intention  transforms"
"itself  and thereby  becomes common intention."
