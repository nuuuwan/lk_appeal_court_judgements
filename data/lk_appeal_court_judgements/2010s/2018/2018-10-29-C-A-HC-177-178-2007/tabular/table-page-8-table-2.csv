"It is  evident from the above quotation that the emphasis should be"
"on ""keeping the jury beyond any kind of influence""  during their tenure of office"
"as  Jurors.  The  Legislature  in  its  wisdom  thought  it  fit 
to  achieve  this"
"objective  by  administering  an  oath  of separation at  adjournments.  But  it"
"did not think fit to  impose such a condition as  a  mandatory obligation on"
"the  trial  Court  as  it  used  the  word  ""may""  and  did  not  lay  down  any"
"consequence, in the event of failure to administer such an oath. Section 9 of"
"the  Oaths  and  Affirmations  Ordinance  provided  that  ""no  omission  to 
take"
"any  oath  or  make  any  affirmation 
...  shall  invalidate  any  proceedings  or  render"
"inadmissible  any  evidence  whatever  in  or 
in 
respect  of riJhich  such  omission,"
"substitution or  irregularity took  place,  or shall affect  the  obligation  of a witness  to"
"state  the  truth."""
