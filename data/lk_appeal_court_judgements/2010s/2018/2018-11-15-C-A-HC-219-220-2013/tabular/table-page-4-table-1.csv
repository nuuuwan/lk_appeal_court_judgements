"door and  house and  be  vigilant.  IP  Darshana was  in  the  look out of the arrival  of the"
"2nd  Appellant.  The  PS  Somasiri  clearly  described  what happened  there  and  says  that"
"he  did  not see  the bike  but heard the motor-cycle approaching  the house.  When  the"
"Appellant got down from the motor-cycle and went to the house he had  a clear view"
"of the Appellant and the others."
"Similarly in  many other issues  both were speaking  of the same  incident through their"
"own  vision. 
If we  carefully  perused  the  evidence,  we  could  see  all  these  witnesses"
"speaking  of  the  main 
incident  and  corroborating  each  other.  We  do  not  see  any"
"contradictions  or conflict of interest.  Therefore  we  find  that there  is  no  merit in  this"
"ground of appeal."
"The  next ground  of appeal  of the  1st  and  the  2nd  appellant  is  that,  the  Learned  Trial"
