"70  N.LR  79 
/  a  Divisional  Bench  of  the  Supreme  Court  placed  emphasis  on  the"
"unqualified  invalidity  of  the  informal  agreement  and  the  attitude  reflected  in  this"
"decision was unreservedly adopted in Samarakoon v.  Starrex(1965) 71 C.LW 25."
"In  such  a  situation,  the  lessor  would  be  able  to  eject  the  lessee  under  such  an"
"agreement,  without  giving  a  month's  notice.  This  principle  was  extended 
in"
"Hinniappuhamy v.  Kumarasinghe (1957) 59 N.LR 566 wherein it was held that even"
"where  the  tenant under  the  informal  agreement  has  not  attorned to  the transferee"
"from  the  lessor,  the  transferee  from  the  lessor  is  competent  to  eject  forthwith  the"
"tenant under the informal agreement from the land, there being no right in the tenant"
"to  require  that he  should  be  given  a month's  notice  by  the  original  lessor  prior  to"
"ejectment by the transferee."
"I have  already  held  that  the  Plaintiff has  established  that he  was  the lessor  of the"
"Defendant. The oral testimony of the Plaintiff was not assailed by the Defendant nor"
"did the Defendant give evidence giving his version and controverting the stance of the"
"Plaintiff."
