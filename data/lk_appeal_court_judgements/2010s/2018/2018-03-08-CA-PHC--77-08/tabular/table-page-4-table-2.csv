"The Learned Counsel for the Appellant further submits that the Learned Magistrate"
"had placed great reliance on the demeanor of the Appellant rather than considering"
"the submissions when arriving at her order and the Learned High Court Judge had"
"proceeded to affirm the order of the Learned Magistrate on the ground that the"
"Learned Magistrate had given due consideration to the facts and circumstances of"
"the case, thereby misdirecting himself and erring in the law."
"The Learned DSG submits that it is highly unlikely that the timber dealer would"
"'accidently' upload a more expensive timber than what had been ordered without"
"due instructions from the buyer and it has been noted that the invoice clearly shows"
"that the Jak timber had been invoiced for and not mahogany timber. The Appellant"
"had also produced a receipt which has the timber which was taken into custody."
"Also~ the seller had not been summoned to give evidence thus the stance of the"
"Appellant remains heresay."
