"Determination  made  upon  misapprehension  of  the  law,  I  am  not"
"inclined to hold with the petitioners to quash the later Gazette 1R3"
"allowing  to  perpetuate  the  illegality  with  the  blessings  of  Court"
"until the Land Reform Commission comes to the same conclusion"
"for the second time  upon a formal inquiry.  Court need not in my"
"view make orders for the sake of making orders."
"The  final  point  raised  by  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  was"
"based on legitimate  expectation.  As I have already stated,  almost"
"all the documents which the petitioners rely on relate to the period"
"anterior to the publication of the Statutory Determination; and the"
"alternative 
lands  referred  to  therein  are  unrelated  to  the 
land"
"referred  to  in  the  Declaration  or  Determination;  and  those  letters"
"are addressed to the 10th respondent who in her objection seeks to"
"dismiss 
the  application  of 
the  petitioners. 
  Hence, 
legitimate"
"expectation  is  hard  to  establish.    The  Statutory  Determination,"
"which  is  void  ab  initio,  cannot  form  the  foundation  for  legitimate"
"expectation. 
  Legitimate  expectation  cannot  be 
founded  upon"
"illegality or nullity."
"Application of the petitioners is dismissed but without costs."
