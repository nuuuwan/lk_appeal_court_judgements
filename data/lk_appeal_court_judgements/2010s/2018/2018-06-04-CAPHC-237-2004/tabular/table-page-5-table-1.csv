"In  Thambiah Seevaratnam v The Assistant Commissioner of Cooperative Development Jaffna3  it"
"is  stated that the  Co-operative Societies  Ordinance was  repealed  by the Co-operative Societies"
"Law,  No.5 of 1972 and that the latter entered into force from 11.10.1972."
"The  Supreme  Court 
in  Mohideen  v.  Assistant  Commissioner  oj Co-operative  Development,"
"Kalmunai4  was  called  upon to interpret Section 53A (5)  of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance"
"and  Pathirana J.  held that the only grounds that can  be  urged before the Magistrate are that -"
"the  Magistrate  has  no  jurisdiction  because 
the 
last  known  place  of  business  or 
(i)"
"residence does not fall  within the local jurisdiction of the Magistrate."
"(ii) 
that he  had  paid the amount."
"(iii) 
that he is not the defaulter in that he is not the person from whom the amount is due."
"I am  of the view that this is the correct interpretation to be adopted in interpreting section 59(4)"
"of the Law to ascertain the scope of the procedure before the Magistrates Court."
"Accordingly,  I am  of the  view  that the  Appellant  cannot  argue  before  the  Magistrate that the"
"RespOndâ‚¬!""'t 
rI::  not ilave the  power to file  the  certificate.  An  atta~~, ull such  exercise  of power"
"may be accommodated in appropriate proceedings where the vires of the exercise of power can"
"be  examined."
"In any event, the submission  made by the learned counsel for the Appellant that the Respondent"
"did  not have the power to file the certificate is  untenable in  law. This  argument  is  made on  the"
"basis 
that  the  order  made  by 
the  Minister  of  Food,  Co-operative,  Housing  Social  Services,"
"Probation  and  Child  Care  Services,  Women's  Affairs  and  Transport,  Southern  Province  and"
"published  in  Gazette  bearing No.  1,286 dated  2003.04.25  (Order)  did  not confer power on  the"
"Respondent to file a certificate under section 59  of the Law as  it does not refer to Column  III  but"
"only to Column  II  at two places."
