"the findings  of the  Learned  Trial  Judge.  We  find  that,  this  ground  of appeal  also  fails"
"on  its own  merits."
"The  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submits  that,  she  was  not  given  an  opportunity  on"
"to  any 
submission  regarding 
the  sentence.  Our  law  provides  only  two  sentences,"
"it  is  death  sentence  or  life 
person  who  is  possessing  Heroin  of  2  grams  or  more,"
"imprisonment.  In  fairness  to the  Appellant we  invited  the  Counsel  under Article  145"
"of the Constitution, to submit any ground in  mitigation of the sentence.  Counsel  fails"
"to  submit  any  reasonable  ground  for  us  to  reconsider  the  sentence. 
It  could  have"
"been  better  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  had  give  an  opportunity  to  the  Appellant  to"
"make  submissions  before  imposing  the  sentence.  But  considering  the  facts  of this"
"case  and  opportunity given  by this  Court,  we  find  the  Learned  Trial  Judge absolutely"
"justified  in  imposing  the  sentence  as  he  imposed.  We  have  no  reason  whatsoever to"
"interfere with the said  sentence."
"After  carefully  considering  the  submissions,  judgment  and  all  facts  of the  case,  we"
"dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence."
"Appeal  Dismissed."
