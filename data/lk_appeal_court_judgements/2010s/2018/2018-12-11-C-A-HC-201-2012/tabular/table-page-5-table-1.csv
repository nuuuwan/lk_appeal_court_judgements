"produced. 
It  appears 
that 
there 
is  a  mistake 
in 
the  vehicle  number.  The  PW2"
"categorically  said 
that,  they  travelled 
in  61-7448  and  the  2nd  vehicle  61-7456  was"
"used  to  send  productions  to the  Government  Analyst.  The  witness  who  transported"
"the Accused  persons to the Magistrate Court used  the vehicle which was  bearing  No."
"61-7446.  It appears that these  are  two vehicles  at the  PNB  and  both  have  been  used"
"at different times in this raid."
"The  question  arises  whether  this  contradiction  goes 
to  the  root  of  the  case  and"
"creates  a  reasonable  doubt. We  carefully  perused  the judgment of the  Learned  Trial"
"Judge  which  contained  26  pages.  The 
Learned  Trial 
Judge  has 
independently"
"analysed  all  factors  before him  including this contradiction and concluded  that,  this is"
"not  a  material  contradiction  which  creates  a  reasonable  doubt  in 
the  case  of  the"
"prosecution hence he  rejected  the same and come to his own conclusion."
"Considering all  factors,  we find that, there is  no merit in this ground of appeal."
"The  4th  ground of appeal  is  that the defence case  was  wrongfully rejected.  It appears"
"that the Appellant had  taken two distinct defences among other minor issues.  During"
"the prosecution case,  it was  suggested that the production was  found in the house of"
"the  Appellant.  When  the  Appellant  made  a  dock  statement,  she  said  that when  the"
"Police  were  about  to  leave  the  house  after  searching,  a  neighbour  lady  had  came"
"there  and  told  a  parcel  was  in  front  of the  house  compound.  It  is  evidence  by  the"
"Court  that  the  Appellant  was 
living  in  a  tiny  house  of which,  her  house,  front  wall"
"starts  from  the  road  and  the  adjacent  house  was  separated  by  a  same  wall  of the"
"house  (similar to shanty,  line  houses).  If it was  found  out of the  house as  she  claims"
"in  her  dock statement  it was  on  the  road.  Will  any  person  leave  such  a big  quantity"
"financial  value  on 
the 
road?  The 
Learned  Trial  Judge  had 
carefully 
with  high"
"considered  all  factors  and  rejected  the  defence  version.  We  are  in  agreement  with"
