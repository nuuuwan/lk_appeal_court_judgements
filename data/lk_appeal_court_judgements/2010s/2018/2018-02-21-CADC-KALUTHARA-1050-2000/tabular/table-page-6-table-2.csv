"""Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding the shares in the corpus"
"for  them, otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and expect the Court to do  their work"
"and their Attomey~at~Law's work for them to get title to those shares in the corpus."""
"On behalf of the Appellants, it was only the 1st Defendant who testified at the trial but"
"admitted  in  his  evidence  that  he  did  not  know  the  details  as  to  the  share  he  was"
"claiming. The 19th  and 20th Defendants (two of the three appellants) had not given any"
"evidence.  The  evidence  of  the  1st  Defendant  is  unsatisfactory  and  the  deed  1V3  is"
"illegible and in these circumstances, the rejection of IV3 by the Court is not without"
"any foundation."
