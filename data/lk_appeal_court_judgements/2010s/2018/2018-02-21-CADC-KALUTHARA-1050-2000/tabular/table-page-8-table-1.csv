"The application of the above indicia does not arise in this case.  In a partition action it"
"is the duty of every party to prove their title to the satisfaction of Court. As against the"
"pedigree of the Plaintiffs, which has been accepted by all the parties except the three"
"Appellants, the pedigree, the documents and the evidence led by the Appellants would"
"not require a trial de novo,  which would be  a needless  waste of time,  considering the"
"long lapse of time that ensued since the judgment was entered on 19.09.2000."
