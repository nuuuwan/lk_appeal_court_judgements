"b
orrowed” is devoid of merit.  If that argument is to be accepted,"
"the Banks will not be able to recover only the principal amount"
"(without 
interest)  under 
the  provisions  of 
the  Act. 
 
It 
is  a"
"misleading  statement  to  say  that  section  4  of  the  Act  refers  to"
"“the recovery of the whole of the unpaid portion of a loan and the"
"interest due thereon.”  There is no specific reference to “interest”"
"in  section  4.    It  says  “the  unpaid  portion  of  such  loan  together"
"with the money and costs recoverable under section 13.”"
"In any event, once the Petitioner gives an undertaking in writing"
"signed  by  him  and  his  Attorney  on  record,  that  he  would  not"
"challenge  the  Resolution  and  prevent  the  auction  and  deliver"
"vacant  possession  in  the  event  the  auction  is  held  due  to  his"
"failure  to  pay  the  amount  during  the  extended  time  given,  he"
"cannot,  after  the  lapse  of  the  grace  period,  file  cases,  one  after"
"the other, challenging the Resolution."
"This is a revision and restitutio in integrum application, which is"
"a discretionary remedy where the conduct of the party applying"
"for the relief is intensely relevant."
"If he thought that Resolution is bad in law due to the application"
"of  Sharia  Law,  he  should  have  taken  up  that  position  when  he"
"first 
filed 
the  Commercial  High  Court  case 
(No.  2/2016/M)"
"challenging the Resolution."
"I do not accept that Sharia Law principals are applicable in this"
"transaction  and 
therefore 
the  provisions  of 
the  Recovery  of"
"Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act is inapplicable into this"
"Loan  Agreement. 
  Assuming 
it 
is  correct,  as  Chief  Justice"
