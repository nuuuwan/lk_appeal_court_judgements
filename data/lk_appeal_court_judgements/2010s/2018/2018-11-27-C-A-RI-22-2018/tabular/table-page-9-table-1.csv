"","n Banda vs. Karohamy2, Justice Nagalingam (with Chief Justice"
"Howard agreeing) stated:",""
"I  am 
inclined 
to 
think 
that","the  doctrine  of  res 
judicata"
"","applies to all matters which existed at the time of the giving"
"","of the judgment and which the party had an opportunity of"
"","bringing  before  the  Court.  In  this  case  it  is  quite  obvious"
"that 
the  present  plaintiff  had 
the","fullest  opportunity  of"
"","bringing before the Court his claim of title to the land based"
"","upon  the  conveyance  (P1),  for  at  the  date  he  filed  answer"
"","the  title  conveyed  by  P1  had  vested  in  him  and  there  was"
"","nothing to prevent him from pleading that title as well. The"
"present  plaintiff  not  having  done","so  and  not  having"
"","obtained  an  adjudication  upon  that  title  in  the  former  suit,"
"","the decree in that suit must therefore be deemed to operate"
"","as  res  judicata  in  regard  to  the  present  assertion  of  his"
"","claim. For these reasons I hold the judgment of the learned"
"","District  Judge  is  right.  The  appeal  therefore  fails  and  is"
"dismissed with costs.",""
