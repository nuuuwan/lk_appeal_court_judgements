"""The surveyor shall  so partition  the land  that each party entitled  to"
"compensation 
in  respect  of 
improvements  effected 
thereto  or  of"
"buildings  erected  thereon  will,  if  that  party  is  entitled  to  a  share  of"

"Given the facts of this case I do not think that the said section is"
"helpful 
to 
the  plaintiff  as 
the  said  Lot  has  not  either  been"
"“improved or built upon” by the plaintiff.  It is noteworthy that this"
"section  speaks  of  ""portion  of  the  land  which  has  been  so  improved"
"or  built  upon""  and  not  ""portion  of  the 
land  which  has  been  so"
"improved or built upon or claimed before the surveyor""."
"I am quite aware that the policy of the law has been to allot to a co-"
"owner the portion which contains his improvements and which he"
"has  been 
in  possession  whenever 
it 
is  possible 
to  do 
so."

"However this is not an invariable, rigid, absolute rule."
"In  Premathiratne  v.  Elo  Fernando4  it  was  held  that  ""Although,  in  a"
"partition decree, a co-owner should, whenever possible, be given the"
"lot  which  carries  his 
improvements,  this  principle  should  not  be"
"adhered to if, in the process of giving effect to it, substantial injustice"
"is  likely  to  be  caused  to  the  other  co-owners.    Where,  however,"
"improvements made by one co-owner fall within the portion allotted"
"to  another  co-owner 
the 
latter  should  pay  compensation 
to 
the"
"former in respect of the improvements."""
