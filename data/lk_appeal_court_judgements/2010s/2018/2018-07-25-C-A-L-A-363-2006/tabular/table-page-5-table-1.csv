"As I said earlier, in Lot 1, there are no improvements and therefore"
"the question of payment of compensation does not arise."
"In  Liyanage  v.  Thegiris5 
it  was  held  that  ""In  an  action  for  the"
"partition of a land owned in common the rule that a co-owner should"
"be  allotted  the  portion  which  contains  his  improvements  is  not  an"
"invariable  rule; 
it  will  not  be  followed 
if 
it 
involves  substantial"
"injustice to the other co-owners."""
"The  conclusion  was  the  same  in  Sediris  Perera  v.  Mary  Nona6:"
"""Although,  according  to  section  33  of  the  Partition  Act,  a  co-owner"
"should ordinarily be given by  the commissioner  an  allotment  which"
"includes  the 
improvements  he  has  made,  this  rule  need  not  be"
"adhered  to  if,  in  doing  so,  a fair  and  equitable  division  is  rendered"
"impossible.  Accordingly,  an  alternative  scheme  may  be  adopted  at"
"the  stage  of  the  final  decree  so  that  a  building  put  up  in  spite  of"
"protest may fall into a lot given to a co-owner other than the person"
"who put up the building."""
"It  is  not  fair  to  deprive  the  3rd  defendant  who  gets  the  largest"
"share  from  the  corpus  of  any  road  frontage  whatsoever  and  give"
"the entire length of road frontage to the plaintiff on the basis  that"
"the plaintiff claimed the Lot which covers the  entire road frontage"
"before the Commissioner at the Preliminary Survey especially when"
"there  are  no  improvements  made  on  that  Lot  by  the  plaintiff.    I"
"have already stated that the finding of the District Judge that the"
"said Lot is a Deniya and Paddy Field and therefore unbuildable is"
"factually incorrect and against the Interlocutory Decree."
