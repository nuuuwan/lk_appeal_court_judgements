"has been denied according to the impugned order on two grounds:"
"(a)  according  to  the  Report  of  the  Preliminary  Plan  No.433,  Lot  1"
"which  covers  the  entire  road  frontage  had  been  claimed  by  the"
"plaintiff before the Surveyor and (b) as Lot 1 is a Deniya and Paddy"
"Field 
(දෙනිය  සහ  කුඹුර)  and 
therefore  unbuildable  no  special"
"advantage would accrue to the plaintiff in giving that entire Lot to"
"him.  It is clear from the order that the District Judge's particular"
"emphasis is on (b) above."
"There  is  no  dispute  that  according  to  section  31  of  the  Partition"

"useless Lot, it does not affect the plaintiff if the Court gives a small"
"road  frontage  through  that  Lot  to  the  3rd  defendant  who  gets  the"
"largest share of the whole land."
"This  also  goes  to  show  that  notwithstanding  the  plaintiff  has"
"claimed Lot 1 before the Commissioner at the Preliminary Survey,"
"he  has  not  made  any  improvements  in  that  Lot  except  having  a"

"The  District  Judge  in  the  impugned  order  has  referred  to  section"
