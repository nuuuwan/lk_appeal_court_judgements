"applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without dealing"
"with  the  merits  of the  case  discharged  the  rule  on  the  ground  that the  applicant  had"
"suppressed  or misrepresented the facts  material to her application. The  Court of Appeal"
"affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of material"
"facts  by the applicant  in  her affidavit and  therefore it was  justified  in  refusing  a writ of"
"prohibition without going into the  merits of the case.  In  other words,  so  rigorous  is  the"
"necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go"
"into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further examination""."
