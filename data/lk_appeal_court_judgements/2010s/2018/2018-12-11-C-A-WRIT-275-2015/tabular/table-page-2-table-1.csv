"The  petitioner 
filed  this  application  against  the  1st  and  2nd"
"respondents―the  Secretary  and  the  Officer 
in  Charge  of  the"
"Beruwala  Pradeshiya  Sabha―seeking  to  quash  P10  by  way  of  a"
"writ of certiorari and to compel the respondents to approve Plan"
"No.246 by way of a writ of mandamus."
"Plan  No.246  is  a  Final  Partition  Plan  prepared  after  an  appeal"
"Judgment of this Court."
"By P10 the  2nd  respondent has refused to approve that Plan on"
"two  grounds:  (a)  there  is  no  turning  circle  on  the  road;  and  (b)"
"the  Plan  is  not  in  conformity  with  the  regulations  made  under"
"the Urban Development Authority Act."
"It is not clear which end of the road, the respondents  expect  to"
"have a turning circle.  When one looks at Plan No.246, definitely"
"it cannot be at the beginning of the Jailani Road.  Then from the"
"other end, there is  no necessity to have a turning circle as  this"
"road  is  to  be  used  as  a  common  road  only  to  the  two  Lots"
"marked A and B."
"The  Plan  is  not  in  conformity  with  the  regulations  made  under"
"the  Urban  Development  Authority  Act  is  a  general  statement."
"The 
respondents 
shall 
be 
specific 
on 
that 
point.

"into  18  pages.    Even  at  this  stage  both  the  petitioner  and  the"
