"It  is  not  only  the  Petitioners 
land  but 
lands  belonging  to  several  other"
"residents  have been earmarked to be  acquired.  The Petitioner has not been denied"
"of the opportunity of having his objections in the matter considered. It appears that"
"the  authorities  have  considered  all  necessary 
factors  before  deciding  on 
the"
"proposed  route  and  selecting  the 
lands 
for  acquisition.  The  need  for  a  public"
"purpose  and  the  urgency  in  acquisition  of the  proposed  land  is  evident  on  the"
"material  placed before  Court.  Accordingly,  the  Court  is  of the  view that there  is"
"no  basis  to  conclude  that  the  relevant  authorities  acted  ultra  vires  in  deciding  to"
"take  possession  of the  land  of the  Petitioner in  terms  of proviso  (a)  of Section  38"
"of the Land Acquisition Act, as  challenged."
"In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs."
