"called  for  observations  from 
the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Health,  where 
it  was"
"confirmed  by  letter  dated  6/3/2016,  marked 
lR8,  that  the 
transfer  of the  10th"
"Respondent  was  made  on  service  exigency.  Therefore 
it 
is  clear  that  the  10th"
"Respondent was transferred due to the requirement of the relevant Base Hospital."
"According  to  document  marked  lRl, the  10th  Respondent  was  transferred"
"as  an  anesthetist  to  the  Balapitiya  Base  Hospital  with  effect  from  112/2011,  and"
"thereafter  was  transferred  to  Elpitiya  Base  Hospital  with  effect  from  11112015."
"However as  reflected in document marked  1 R2,  the  10th  Respondent was working"
"at the Balapitiya Base Hospital as  at  19/6/2015."
"It  is  submitted  by  the  Respondents  that  the  procedure  in  relation  to  the"
"is 
at 
the  date  of  discharge 
from 
the  previous 
transfer  of  Medical  Officers"
"attachment  as  Medical  Officer.  The  transfer  from  Balapitiya  Base  Hospital  to"
"Elpitiya  Base  Hospital  was  effective  from  11112015 
(P13).  However, 
the  10th"
"Respondent was attached to Balapitiya Base Hospital as  at  19/6/2015, as  indicated"
"by document marked  lR2. The last  date to  submit applications  for  Grade  1 of the"
"said college was  1017/2015.  Therefore it is  observed that as  contained in document"
"marked P12, the ""effective date of transfer will be considered as the date on which"
"the officer has reported for duty in the new station""."
"Therefore 
the  Petitioners 
contention 
that 
the 
10th  Respondent 
falsely"
"misrepresented facts  relating to  his  transfer to the  Interview Board by  stating  that"
"he  assumed  duties  at  the  Balapitiya Base Hospital  on or about the  30th  December"
