"them  in  relation  to  the facts  in  issue.  The  trial  Court had  considered  the"
"most relevant  part of the  dock  statement of  the  1st  Appellant as  it noted"
"that the miners were already produced before Court and therefore he has"
"no reason to take a bribe not to act legally. Credibility of this assertion vis a"
"vis  the prosecution version of events was considered by the trial Court and"
"it  had  rightly  concluded  that  it  did  not create  a  reasonable  doubt in  the"
"prosecution case.  In relation to  the statement of the 2nd  Appellant also  the"
"trial Court arrived at the same conclusion. It is noted that the 2nd Appellant"
"claimed that he knew the complainant from his childhood when he resided"
"at Pilimatalaw.  This  claim is  to justify his visit to  the complainant's house"
"that 
afternoon.  Strangely 
the 
2nd  Appellant  did  not  put  his 
prior"
"acquaintance  with 
the  complainant 
in  cross 
examination.  Thus, 
the"
"rejection of his dock statement by trial Court is justified."
