"where Ranasinghe J,  as he was then, having considered a  series of judicial"
"precedents, held as follows;"
"""On an examination of the  principles laid down  by the authorities"
"referred 
to  above, 
it  seems 
to  me; 
that,  where 
the 
trial  Judge's"
"findings  on  questions  of fact  are  based  upon  the  credibility of the"
"witnesses,  on  the  footing  of the  trial  Judge's  perception  of such"
"evidence, 
then  such  findings  are  entitled  great  weight  and 
the"
"utmost consideration,  and will be  reversed only if it appears  to  the"
"appellate  Court  that  the  trial  Judge  has failed  to  make full  use  of"
"the  ""priceless  advantage"" given  to  him  of seeing and  listening to"
"the witnesses giving viva voce evidence, and the appellate Court is"
"convinced  by  the  plainest  consideration  that  it would  be  justified"
"in  doing  so;  that,  where  the  findings  of fact  are  based  upon  the"
"trial  Judge's  evaluation  of facts, 
the  appellate  Court  is  then  in  as"
"good  a  position  as  a  trial  Judge 
to  evaluate  such  facts,  and  no"
"sanctity attaches  to  such findings  of fact  of the  trial Judge;  that,  if"
"on  either of these  grounds,  it appears  to  the  appellate  Court  that"
"such findings  of fact  should  be  reversed  then  the  appellate  Court"
