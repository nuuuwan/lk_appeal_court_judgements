"","the trial Court  however points otherwise."
"","The  evidence  is  that the  decoy  was  standing at the doorway  to  the"
"","OIC's office when the two of them talked. The decoy saw them and could"
"","hear  their  dialog.  He says  the  2nd  Appellant was  also  there  in  the  office."
"","The  complainant does  not confirm  this  fact.  It is  not  the  evidence  of  the"
"","complainant  that  they  spoke  in  subdued 
tone 
to  prevent  others  from"
"","hearing what they talked. The 1st  Appellant was making his demand in the"

reminded  of  him  what  could  be

"","repercussions if his request is  not considered favourably.  Therefore, there"
"","was no need for  the 1st  Appellant to  talk to the complainant in a  subdued"

relied  upon  by

"","During the cross  examination of the complainant as well as PW2, it"
"","was put to  them that having had the instructions and opportunity to  give"

"","at his residence.  At the hearing of their appeal, this factor was highlighted"
"","by the Appellants, claiming that it is an improbable version of events."
"","PW2, when he was cross examined on this point offered a reason for"
"","such  a  deviation.  He  explained  that  he  needed  to  hear  from  each  of  the"
"","Appellants 
that 
in 
fact  a  prior  solicitation  was  made,  and 
that 
the"
"","impending acceptance is a  result of that prior solicitation.  This  position is"
