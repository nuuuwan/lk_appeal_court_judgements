"The decision in the case of  Mary Matilda v OIC Habarana  CA (PHC  )"
"86/97 is  amply clear that simply telling the driver is insufficient. It was held"
"that ""the order of confiscation cannot be made if the owner proves to the"
"satisfaction of court:"
"(l) that he has all precautions to prevent the  use of the vehicle for the"
"commission of the offence and"
"(2)that the vehicle has been usedfor the commission of the offence without his"
"knowledge ""."
"It was decided in the above case that the owner should take positive steps to"
"prevent the commission of the offence. In the instant case the appellant failed to"
"prove on a balance of probability that he took all precautions to prevent"
"commission of the offence taking place."
