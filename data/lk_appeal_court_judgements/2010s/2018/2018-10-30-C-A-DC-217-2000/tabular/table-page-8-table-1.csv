"The  Counsel  for the  Appellant  in  his  written  submission  argues  that,  even  if it  is"
"presumed that the Will  No.  2316  made by the Original  Petitioner relevant to case"
"No.  32699/T is genuine, it revokes the previous Will, the subject matter in  case  No."
"28578/T. 
However,  as  far as  the  estate  of late  Dr.  Wijerama  is  concerned,  this"
"argument has no relevance as  the Will in  case  No.  28578/T is a joint will."
"The  Counsel  argues  stating that the  learned  District Judge  had  applied  different"
"standards to similar situations which form the backgrounds to the Marawila District"
"Court case 150/T and Colombo District Court case No.32699/T.  As per the evidence"
"led before the learned District Judge, there was sufficient material to show that the"
"letters  of  administration  were  obtained 
from  Marawila  District  Courts  by"
"representations of facts  which  are false,  while  knowing the falsehood  of the facts"
"represented  through  the  Petition. The  evidence  was  that the application to recall"
"the probate in 32699/T is yet pending.  Whether the last will tendered in that case"
"is  a genuine one  has to be  decided in that case.  The delay in filing that action with"
"regard to the purported last will has to be evaluated by the Judge hearing that case."
"Though  there  are  suspicious  circumstances,  it is  not yet established  that there  is"
"fraud  in  filing  32699/T. 
Therefore,  the  learned  District Judge  has  correctly  held"
"that 
if 
the  Petitioner-
Respondent  had 
obtained 
the  probate 
in 
32699/T"
"fraudulently,  necessary steps should  be  taken  in  that action to recall the probate."
"The  case  No.  32699/T is  not an  action filed while another action  is  pending for the"
"same  estate  and  representing falsehood  with  regard  to the  other action.  Though"
"there are  suspicious circumstances and  allegations,  no  fraud  is  established  on  the"
"face  of the  documents  but with  regard  to  Marawila  District Court case  there was"
