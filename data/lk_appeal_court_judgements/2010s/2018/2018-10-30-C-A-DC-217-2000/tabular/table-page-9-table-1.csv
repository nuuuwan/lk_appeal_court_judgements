"","Finally, the Appellant tries to argue that the Petitioner failed in proving the last will,"
"","the subject matter of the D.C.  Colombo case  No.28578/T.  Proof of the last will is a"
"","matter depending on the facts tendered before the original Court.  Thus, this court"
"","shall  not  interfere  unless  the  decision  of the  learned  Additional  District Judge  is"
"","perverse  and  not  supported  by 
the 
facts  placed  before  him.  The  Appellant's"
"","In her 
position in the amended objections was that it was not a duly executed will."
"","original  objections,  she  has  not taken  up this  position.  As  per her objections she"
"","had  admitted the averments No.1, 2 and  3 of the  Petition which  reveals the facts"
"","If the execution of the will is admitted, 
relating to the making of the joint last will."
"","the appellant must explain  why she  states  that it is  not properly executed. 
This"
"","Court  observes 
that  her  evidence 
lacks 
integrity  and  uniformity.  On  certain"
"","occasions as  mentioned before she  herself admits the relevant last will as a legally"
"","valid  last  will. 
In  such  a backdrop,  this  Court  cannot find  fault with the  learned"
"","Additional 
District 
Judge's 
findings 
in 
the 
Judgment 
dated 
20/03/2000."
"","Furthermore, the learned Additional District Judge has given ample and acceptable"
"","reasons  to  support  his  findings  in  his  judgments. 
Therefore,  I do  not  intend  to"
"","interfere with the findings of the learned Additional District Judge."
"","Therefore, this appeal  is dismissed with costs."
