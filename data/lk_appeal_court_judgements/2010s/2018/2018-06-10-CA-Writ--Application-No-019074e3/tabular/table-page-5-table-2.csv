failure, 
to  absorb 
the  Petitioner 
into 
the  Technical  Service,  by"
"amending  the  said  circular.  The  post  of Driver  Overseer  does  not  exist  as  an"
"approved post or salary group in the Uva Provincial Public Service. Therefore, the"
"Court cannot  impose  a  legal  duty  upon  the  Respondents  to  create  a post which  is"

"Judgment  marked  P27, 
does 
not 
create 
any  precedence  over

"Accordingly,  the  Petitioner has  failed  to  convince  Court of an  existing legal  right"
"where  the  Petitioner has  been deprived of by the  omission or an  act which can be"
"attributed to the Respondents."
