"As the Board of Quazis in the impugned order has observed, if the"
"order was made ex parte, the petitioner could have availed himself"
"of the proviso to section 66 of the Muslim Marriage & Divorce Act"
"to 
reopen 
the  proceedings  before 
the  Quazi  Court. 
  Learned"
"counsel  for  the  petitioner  admits  that  no  such  application  was"
"made before the Magistrate’s Court up to now."
"As 
seen 
from 
the 
journal 
entry 
dated 
21.09.2017 
of 
the"
"Magistrate’s  Court  proceedings,  the  petitioner  had  on  that  day"
"appeared  before 
the  Magistrate’s  Court 
for 
the 
first 
time  on"
"summons.  He had been represented by a lawyer as well.  However"
"as the respondent was not physically present although represented"
"by  a  lawyer,  the  Court  has  warned  the  petitioner  to  appear  on"
"12.10.2017  to  work  out  a  modality  of  payment  of  maintenance"
"when the respondent is present."
"Thereafter,  according  to  the  petitioner  himself,  on  12.10.2017  he"
"has  paid  Rs.  50,000/=  as  maintenance  and  the  case  has  been"
"postponed  to  15.11.2017  to  make  the  balance  payment.    Learned"
"counsel 
for 
the  petitioner  says 
that 
the  said  payment  of  Rs."
"50,000/=  was  made  out  of  fear  of  getting  a  default  (custodial)"
"sentence.  I cannot accept that submission at all (a) having regard"
"to the manner the learned Magistrate has dealt with the petitioner"
"when he first appeared on 12.10.2017 and (b) in the absence of a"
"copy of the proceedings dated 15.11.2017.  The proceedings dated"
"15.11.2017 has not been tendered to the Board of Quazis and the"
"Board of Quazis has made a particular reference to that matter in"
"the  order. 
  The  petitioner  does  not  tender  a  copy  of  the  said"
"proceedings  to  this  Court  either.    The  inference  which  could  be"
"drawn is that the petitioner does so because those proceedings are"
"unfavorable to him."
