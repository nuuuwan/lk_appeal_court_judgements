"produced  the 
father's  Deed  marked  P1. 
  This  Deed  has  been"
"executed  on  14.12.1936,  that  is,  after  the  Settlement  Notice  was"
"published.    By  this  Deed,  the  petitioner's  father  has  purchased"
"undivided  rights  of  four  lands  including  the  land  in  respect  of"
"which Settlement Order was made, which is Pattiyakumbura."
"If the petitioner's father participated in the Settlement Inquiry with"
"an Attorney-at-Law and his claim was rejected and settled the land"
"in  favour  of  the  Crown,  the  petitioner's  father  was  not  without  a"
"remedy.  He, in terms of section 24 of the Ordinance, ought to have"
"filed  an  action  in  the  District  Court  within  one  year  from  the"
"publication  of  the  Settlement  Order  to  vindicate  his  rights.    This"
"has not been done."
"It may be recalled that Settlement Order was published as far back"
"as  in  1944,  and  the  petitioner  as  the  son  of  the  claimant,  after"
"more  than  60  years  in  2015  cannot  challenge  the  said  Order  by"
"way  of  a  writ  application.    The  petitioner's  first  relief  for  writ  of"
"certiorari shall in my view necessarily fail."
"On what basis does the petitioner challenge the Settlement Order?"
"He 
says 
that  his 
father  by  Deed  marked  P2 
executed 
on"
"16.09.1984  sold  his  undivided  rights  to  him. 
  This 
is  on  the"
"purported premise that what was transferred  by Deed P2  was the"
"father's  undivided 
rights 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
land  known 
as"
"Pattiyakumbura, the land in respect of which Settlement Order was"
"made."
"Firstly,  the  land  which  has  been  transferred  by  Deed  P2  is  not"
"Pattiyakumbura  but  a  different  land  known  as  Gaalpattiyewatta"
"and therefore the petitioner gets no rights  by Deed P2  to the  land"
"in respect of which Settlement Order was made."
