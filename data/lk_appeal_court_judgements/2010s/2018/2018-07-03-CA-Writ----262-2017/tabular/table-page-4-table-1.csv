"In 
support  of  this  application 
the 
respective  parties  have  cited  several"
"Judgments, where the Court has  looked into the  issue of undue delay in making an"
"application for judicial review."
"In  the  case  of Biso  Menika  Vs.  Cyril  de  Alwis  (1982)  lSLR 368 at page"
"378, the court held,"
"""the  proposition  that  the  application for  writ  must  be  sought  as  soon  as"
"is  caused  is  merely  an  application  of the  equitable  doctrine  and 
injury"
"delay defeats equity and the  longer the  injured person sleeps over his rights"
"without  any  reasonable  excuse 
the 
chances  of his  success 
in  a  writ"
"application  dwindle  and  the  court  may  reject  a  writ  application  on 
the"
"ground of unexplained delay. """
"Accordingly, 
the 
length  of  the  delay, 
the  extent  and 
the  effect  of  the"
"decision under challenge are relevant factors."
"It is  trite  law  that,  the  Courts  will  not  assist  a  claimant who  sleeps  on  his"
"rights.  Therefore,  a  claimant  must  bring  his  claim  promptly.  On  the  question  of"
"promptness,  a  Court  can  refuse  a  remedy  where  there  has  been  undue  delay.  As"
"noted  earlier,  the  delay  in  filing  this  application  for  judicial  review  is  more  than"
"two  to  three  years  from  the date  of the  impugned Gazette Notifications.  The delay"
"in  filling  action  is  unexplained and on this  ground alone this  application should be"
"refused."
