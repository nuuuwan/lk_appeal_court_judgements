"the congregation who worshipped there. Bonser D.J.  distinguished the previous case of"
"Tissera  v.  Costa3  on  the facts:  ""The  muppu  who appears  to be kind of beadle,  has  no"
"control  over  the  fabric  of  the  church,  and  was  only  a  caretaker  entrusted  with  the"
"custody of certain movables, a vey subordinate servant, whose duty is was to keep the"
"church clean, but who had no sort or kind of possession either on behalf of himself or"
"anybodyelse"".4"

(with  Swan,  J.  agreeing)  in"
"Sameem v.  Dep~"
"The facta  probanda  of possessory actions have  received definition by the South African"
"courts.  In Scholtz v.  Faife? Innes C.J.  said:  ""A person who applies for such relief must satiSfy"
"the  Court  upon  two  points:  that  he  was  in  possession  of the  (property)  at  the  date  of the  alleged"
"""  In  Burnham  v.  Neumeye/ 
deprivation;  and  that he was  illicitly ousted form  such possession.7"
"Bristowe J.  stated the  essential requisites  as  follows:  ""that  the  things  alleged  to  have been"
"spoliated were in the plaintiff's possession, and that they were removed from  his possession forcibly or"
"wrongfully or against his consent"". 9"
"Scholtz  v.  Faifelo is  an  illuminative  case  in  this  regard.  The  appellant,  who  had"
"contracted to  erect  certain buildings for  the  respondent  on condition that the latter"
"supplied the materials and paid for the work as it progressed every two weeks, applied"
"for  an order reinstating him in possession of the building  then partially erected.  The"
"Appellant  alleged that the Respondent had unlawfully taken possession of the partly"
"constructed building and placed another contractor in charge of the work."
"One  of the questions which arose was whether the Appellant had sufficient physical"
"control or detentio of the building, to be declared entitled to possessory relief."
