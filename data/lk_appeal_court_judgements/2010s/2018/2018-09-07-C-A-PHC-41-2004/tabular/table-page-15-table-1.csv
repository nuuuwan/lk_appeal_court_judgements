"Sohoni in his treatise on the  Indian Criminal Procedure at page 1331  describes  that"
"the proviso to Section 14 5( 4) of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which could boast"
"of parentage over its Sri Lankan counterpart in Section 66 of the Primary Procedure Act"
"No.44  of 1979 is founded  on the principle that forcible  and wrongful dispossession is"
"not to be recognized under the Criminal Law. The word ""dispossessed"" means to be out"
"of possession,  removed from  the premises,  ousted,  ejected or excluded.  Even  where  a"
"person has a right to possession, he cannot do so by taking the law into his hand. That"
"will make it a forcible  entry otherwise than in due course of law.  It would be a case of"
"both forcible and wrongful dispossession."
"In the case of P.K Anita v.  Shridhar Sadashi,P it has been held that: 'The words  forcibly"
"and wrongfully' qualifying the word 'dispossession' in the proviso to section 145(4), cannot be given a"
"restricted  meaning of dispossession  accompanied by  the use of criminal force.  To  constitute forcible"
"dispossession,  even  the use of misrepresentation and improper threats  would make the dispossession"
