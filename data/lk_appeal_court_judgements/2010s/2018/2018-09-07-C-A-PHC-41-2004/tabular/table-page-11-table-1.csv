"possession  required  in  Section  68  (3)  of  the  Act?  There  is  sparse  discussion  by  the"
"learned High Court judge on this requirement."
"Does the possession of the Poosari or Kurukkal satisfy the requisites for possession"
"in Section 68?"
"A  slew  of  case  law  throws  light  on  the  kind  of  possession  that  would  suffice  for"
"purposes of Section 68.  Before  I look at them, let me  reiterate that there is  nothing in"
"the two affidavits  of the Respondents  to suggest that they had some kind of right to"
"summarily put out a priest. What was it that gave them power? Did they appoint him"
"as  a priest? If so can they proceed to throw him out in the way he was ousted? This is"
"not  made  clear  more  unambiguously 
in

fact  whether 
the  Respondents  were 
in  fact  members  of 
the"
"administrative body or not."
"The  forcible  dispossession  as  I have  commented  above  is  abundantly  clear  from  the"
"affidavit  evidence of the  Respondents.  They admit in the affidavit that having broken"
"open  the  closed  door  of  the  temple  on  the  5th  of  September  2002,  they  secured  the"
"temple with new locks and took away the possession from the Appellant."
"There  are  several  determinations  that  a  Primary  Court Judge  has  to  make  at  the"
"conclusion  of an inquiry into  a dispute relating to  the right of the possession of any"
"land  or  any  part  of  a land.  Firstly  he  must  make  a determination  as  to  who  was  in"
