"2.  Concept of joint possession  not considered."
"3.  Prosecution filed to establish  conscious  possession."
"At the trial against the appellant, the Prosecution called,  IP  Neomal,  PC  6114 Jaliya,"
"PC 
8450  Wakista  Chief 
Inspector 
(CI)  Rajakaruna  and 
the  Senior  Assistant"
"Government analyst  Ms.  Ratnapala.  When  the  defence called  the Appellant opted"
"to  make  a  statement 
from 
the  dock  and 
called 
three  witnesses  Dilantha"
"Nanayakkara, 
Nadeera 
Jayasinghe 
and 
Premasiri 
Ratnayake 
from 
two"
"telecommunication companies."
"Since the second  and the third grounds of appeals Joint possession  and  Conscious"
"possession are deals with possession hence we decided to discuss those two at the"
"beginning."
"Briefly, recalling the events as  revealed  by the witnesses for the prosecution, At the"
"the  3rd  Accused  persons,  when 
they 
hotel,  PNB  officials  spotted 
the  pt  and"
"approached the 2nd  Accused  appellant who came there in  a Motor Cycle,  received"
"the  parcel  from  the  1st  Accused.  He  was  then  arrested;  the  appellant  takes  up  a"
"defence  of  alibi.  He  said 
that  he  was  not  arrested  at  Bambalapitiya  but  at"
"Boralasgamuwa. The  defence witness says that there were two calls taken from the"
"mobile of the appellant, one at 1.27 noon and the other was at 3 pm. The appellant"
"denies  the  involvement  and  submits  that  if  he  was  arrested  as  claimed  by  the"
"prosecution  at  about  1 pm  and  his  phone was  taken  into the  custody of the  PNB,"
"how could  he take calls."
"Presuming the prosecution facts are correct, we discuss about the joint possession."
"Concept of Joint possession is  discussed  in  many cases  and  it is  well established  in"
"our  legal  system. 
In 
the  present  case, 
the  prosecution  clearly  demarcates  the"
"possession. The 1st Accused had the possession and he gave to the Appellant. There"
"is  nothing to say that both were holding or possessing the parcel  together."
"The  Appellant took up a defence that he  was  elsewhere  at that time,  so  the  issue"
"of joint  and  conscious  possession  will  not  become  a  part  of  the  defence.  The"
"prosecution  should  prove  the  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  that  burden  never"
"shifts until they complete the case  for the prosecution."
"It is the duty of the prosecution to prove the appellant had the heroin with him and"
"he  had  conscious  possession.  In  this  case  the  prosecution  witness  says  that  the"
"appellant came  in  a motorcycle to the  hotel,  received  the  parcel  bag  from  the  1st"
