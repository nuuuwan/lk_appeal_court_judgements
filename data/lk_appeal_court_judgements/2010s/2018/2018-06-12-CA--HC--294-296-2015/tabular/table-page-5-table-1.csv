"was  apprehended."
"Evidence  of the prosecution  witnesses  says  that the appellant took the  parcel  and"
"kept it with him. It was in his custody. This is  not an  accidental pick up nor unknown"
"possession.  For  all  purpose  there  is  no  material  to  show  that  this  is  a  theft  or"
"robbery.  It was  a clear transaction  between  the  1st  accused  and  the appellant.  The"
"appellant from  the beginning  of the trial  took up the stance that he doesn't know"
"about this and  he was arrested elsewhere and the case was falsely framed. He never"
"took up a defence of innocent or unconscious possession."
"As we discussed above the prosecution evidence regarding possession is consistent"
"and  corroborated  by witnesses. We do not find any material to create a reasonable"
"doubt in  the case for the prosecution, therefore we  conclude that there is  no merit"
"in these two grounds of appeal."
