"As  correctly  pointed  out  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General,"
"that the contents of the dying deposition are corroborated by independent"
"sources. The medical evidence confirms that there was in fact an assault on"
"the deceased.  The removal of her clothing is confirmed by witness Kumara"
"who says  that the  deceased  was  only covered  by  a  sarong when she was"
"taken  to  hospital.  The  presence  of  the  guava  tree  and  the  water  tank  are"
"relevant in this context."
