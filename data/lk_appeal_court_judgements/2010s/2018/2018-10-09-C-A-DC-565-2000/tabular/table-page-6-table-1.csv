"6th and 7th Defendants in their amended statement of claim have named the subject"
"matter as  ((Barasiyathottam"""
"After the 2nd  commission, the Commissioner G.  Ambepitiya, Licensed Surveyor had"
"submitted the Plan No. 966A which was marked as 751 at the trial, naming the land"
"surveyed  as  ((portion  of Barasiyawatta"". 
It is  common ground that physical  metes"
"and  bounds and  the extent depicted in  the aforesaid  Plain  No.  966A and  the same"
"of the  preliminary Plan  marked  'X'  are  identical,  except for the  name  of the  land"
"and  the  manner  by which  the  boundaries  are  described.  However,  the  Western"
"and  Eastern boundaries in  Plan  No. 966A (751) are described as ((Kottawasalawatta"
"alias  Land  belonging  to  Mohammed  Kandu  Master""  and 
((Kelawantottam  alias"
"Nakiyawatte"" 
respectively,  which  description 
is  similar 
to 
the  description  of"
"Western  and  Eastern  boundaries  of the  Preliminary  Plan  No.966. 
As  per  the"
"preliminary  Plan 
the  Southern 
boundary 
is 
described 
as 
'Henewatta 
alias"
"Henatottam', which as  per 751 (Plan  No.  966A)  is  described  as  'Senetottam Watta"
"alias  'land  wherein the heirs of Uduman  Labbe  Marikkar reside'. 
However, there"
"is  a similarity or closeness  in  both the descriptions as  one is  'Henetottam' and  the"
"'Senetottam  Watta'.  However,  the  Northern  boundary  in  751  (Plan  No. 
other  is"
"966A)  is  described  as  a  portion  of the  same  land.  In  other words,  it can  be  also"
"described as a portion of 'Barasiyawatta' as the land surveyed  is  named as  'portion"
"of Barasiyawatte'. Even  in the Preliminary Plan the Northern boundary is described"
"as  'Barasiyawatta'.  The aim of making the 751 (Plan  No. 966A) is to show that the"
"land  surveyed  in the preliminary Plan  is a part of Barasiyawatta containing 2 roods"
"14.50  perches,  but not Senetottam  of 2 roods  and  9  perches  as  described  in  the"
