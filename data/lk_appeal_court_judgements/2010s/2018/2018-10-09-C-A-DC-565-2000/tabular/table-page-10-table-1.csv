"partitioned and  its location within the bigger area  of land. 
It is worthy to note that"
"as  per some deeds, even  Barisiyawatta  is about 1 acre in extent."
"The  counsel  for the Plaintiff brought this court's attention to the 2nd  paragraph  of"
"the  report  of the  preliminary  plan  marked  Xl  and  stated  that the  Commissioner"
"had  identified  the  land  surveyed  as 
land  sought  to  be  partitioned  but this  court"
"observes 
that  he  had  not  done  any  superimposition  or  given  any 
reason 
to"
"substantiate such opinion.  The facts revealed at the trial show that the boundaries"
"of the  land  surveyed  tally with the  boundaries given  to the  land  described  in  the"
"schedule  to the  statement of claim  of the  8th  Defendant.  Furthermore,  in  his  2nd"
"plan the same commissioner had  named the land as a portion of Barisiyawatta and"
"shown the northern boundary as a portion of the same land. 
It must be  noted that"
"as  per the deeds  marked  by the  7th  Defendant,  Barisiyawatta  is  a land  of 1 acre  in"
"extent.  As per the report made to plan 966A marked as 752, it appears that the 2nd"
"commission  was 
issued 
to  show 
the  correct  name  of  the 
land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned. Accordingly,  he has named the land surveyed  in the 2nd  plan  No.  966A"
"as a portion of Barisiyawatta and abutting lands with additional descriptions when"
"compared  with  the  preliminary  plan.  In  the  report  to the  aforesaid  2nd  plan  the"
"commissioner  has  not  stated 
that  he  named  and  described 
the 
land  and 
the"
"boundaries  in  the  manner described  by the  Defendants and  the true descriptions"
"are as  mentioned in  the preliminary plan  and  report.  Therefore, the report of the"
"plan  marked  966A qualify the statement made  by  him  previously in  the  report of"
"the preliminary plan marked Xl stating that the land surveyed is the land sought to"
"be  partitioned by the Plaint."
