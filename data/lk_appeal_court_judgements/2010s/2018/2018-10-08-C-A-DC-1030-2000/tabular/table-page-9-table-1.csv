"I  did  not  consider  the  merits  of  the  application  of  the  2nd"
"defendant-respondent.  However, 
one 
thing 
is 
clear. 
If 
the"
"application  of 
the  2nd  defendant-respondent 
is  allowed, 
the"
"appellants are the losers or the affected parties.  Then even if the"
"liberal  approach  suggested  in  Ratwatte’s  case  is  adopted,  the"
"application  of  the  2nd  defendant-respondent  cannot  be  allowed"
"as  “a  respondent  cannot  attack 
the  decree 
in 
the  appellant's"
"favour  without  filing  a  cross-appeal  or  giving  notice  of  objections"
"under section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code.”"
"The application of the 2nd defendant-respondent is dismissed."
