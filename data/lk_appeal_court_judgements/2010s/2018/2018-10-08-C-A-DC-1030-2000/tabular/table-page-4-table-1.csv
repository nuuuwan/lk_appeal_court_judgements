"According  to  section  69  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  if  no  such"
"attesting  witness  can  be 
found, 
it  must  be  proved 
(a) 
the"
"signature  of  one  of  the  witnesses  and  (b)  the  signature  of  the"
"executant. 
  The 
learned  Additional  District  Judge  has  not"
"adverted to these two mandatory requirements when he came to"
"the finding that the said Deed is a valid Deed."
"I carefully went through the evidence of the sole witness for the"
"plaintiffs,  who 
is 
the  1st  plaintiff, 
to 
learn 
that,  he, 
in  his"
"testimony, has not identified the signatures of the executant and"
"the  attesting  witnesses.    His  evidence  on  the  execution  of  the"
"Deed is evasive."
"It  is  the  position  of  the  plaintiffs  that  the  executant  placed  her"
"left  thumb  impression  instead  of  placing  her  signature  on  the"
"Deed (as she was used to) because she was ill."
"However, it is interesting to note that in the original Deed, which"
"was  marked  as  P1  through  the  evidence  of  the  1st  plaintiff,  the"
"thumb 
impression 
of 
the 
executant 
or 
anything  written"
"underneath the thumb impression by the Notary cannot be seen"
"to  the  naked  eye.2  That  is  not  due  to  lapse  of  time  because"
"writings  of  the  other  parts  of  the  Deed  are  clear  and  readable."
"The  position  had  been  the  same  when  the  original  Deed  was"
"marked in evidence at the trial Court."
"The  1st  plaintiff  does  not  complain  of  a 
foul  play  on  non-"
"appearance  of  the  alleged  thumb  impression  of  the  executant"
"and 
the 
endorsement 
supposedly  made 
by 
the 
Notary"
"underneath  the  thumb 
impression.  The  1st  plaintiff  has  not"
"given  any  acceptable  explanation  on  that  vital  matter.  Nor  has"
