"The  1st  plaintiff  has 
also 
admitted 
in 
evidence 
that 
the"
"executantâ€•his 
grandmother, 
was 
confined 
to 
bed 
and"
"immobilized due to paralysis at the time of the execution of the"
"Deed.4    Then  it  is  not  clear  how  and  why  she  was  brought  to"
"house No.121 for the purpose of execution of the Deed.  On the"
"other hand, according to the Deed, house No.121 was where she"
"was residing even though the 1st plaintiff in his evidence stated"
"that he came with the grandmother to house No. 121.  It is also"
"noteworthy that the Notary in the attestation has stated that he"
"does not know the executant."
"I  have  no  reservation  to  conclude  that  the  due  execution  of  the"
"Deed marked P1  as contemplated in section 69 of the Evidence"
"Ordinance  read  with  section  2  of 
the  Prevention  of  Frauds"
"Ordinance  has  not  been  proved,  and  therefore  the  impugned"
"Deed marked P1 has no force or avail in law."
"Let the incumbent District Judge adjust the  share allocation as"
"if 
there  was  no  such  Deed  and  enter 
Interlocutory  Decree"
"accordingly.  To that extent, the Judgement of the District Court"
"is set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs."
"This leads me to consider the application of learned counsel for"
"the  2nd  defendant-respondent  made  by  way 
of 
a  written"
"submission  tendered  to  this  Court  after  the  argument  date,"
"without  sending  copies  to  the  Attorneys-at-Law  of  the  other"
"parties.  By that written submission, learned counsel for the 2nd"
"defendant-respondent  moves 
to 
adjust 
share 
allocation 
in"
"respect  of  the  Deed  marked  4V1  and  the  subsequent  Deed"
"marked  4V2,  which  the  learned  counsel  says  has  wrongly  been"
"decided by the learned Additional District Judge."
