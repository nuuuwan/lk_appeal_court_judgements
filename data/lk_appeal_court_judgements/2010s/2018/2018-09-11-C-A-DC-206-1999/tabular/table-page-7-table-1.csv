"case,  it acknowledges a right of ownership in  some other person  or persons and that until such"
"time as they shed that right of limited possession, adverse possession will not commence."
"The  Appellant relied  on  several  acreage  levy receipts to establish  prescriptive title.e:l.4,  e:l.6,  e:l.7"
"e:l.8 and e:l.9 are all acreage levy receipts issued after the partition action was filed and the learned"
"Additional  District judge  correctly  did  not  attach  any  evidentiary  value  to  them.  e:l.S 
is  dated"
"21.08.1974  but  is 
in  relation  to  a  paddy  land  named  ""Aswedduma""  whereas  the  corpus 
is"
"identified as  ""Asweddume Mulatha""."
"It was admitted that the corpus is depicted in plan  no. 339 dated 17.02.1986 prepared by U.N.P."
"Wijeweera, Licensed Surveyor. According to this plan the extent of the corpus is A.01  R.  03  P.20."
"e:l.10  is  an  extract from the paddy lands  register 1980 which states that the the Appellant is the"
"owner  of the  land  called  ""Aswedduma""  which  is  2  acres  in  extent.  This  again  is  a  document"
"emanating  after the  filing  of the  partition  action  and  further refers  to to  a paddy  land  named"
"""Aswedduma"" whereas the corpus is identified as ""Asweddume Mulatha"". e:l.ll is an extract from"
"the paddy lands register 1970 which states that the the Appellant is the owner of the land called"
"""Aswedduma Mulatha"" which is  1 acre in extent whereas the corpus is A.01  R.  03  P.20 in extent."
"In  the above circumstances,  I am  of the view that the Appellant has failed to show by clear and"
"unequivocal  evidence  that  his  possession  of the  corpus  was  hostile  to  the  real  owners  and"
"amounted to a denial of their title to the property claimed as required to be shown in view of the"
"decision in De Silva v.  Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (80  N.L.R.  292)."
"For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  case  of the  Appellant  that  he  acquired  prescriptive  title to the"
"whole land  must fail."
"The  case  of the  Respondent  is  that  the  Appellant  is  only  a  co-owner  who  is  entitled  to  an"
"undivided  4/10 share  of the  corpus.  In  this  context,  the  plea  of prescriptive  title  raised  by  the"
"Appellant must be considered upon the applicable legal principles governing claim of prescriptive"
"title amongst co-owners. A co-owner's possession is in  law the possession of his  co-owners.  It is"
"not possible for him to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in  his mind.  Nothing"
"v. 
short  of ouster  or  something  equivalent  to  ouster  could  bring  about  that  result  [Corea"
