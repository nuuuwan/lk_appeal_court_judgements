"Another important matter was  whether deed  no.  45801  dated  26.07.1961  (5.1)  is  valid  as  the"
"entire claim  of the Appellant is  based  on this deed. The  Respondent attacked the validity of this"
"deed  on  the  basis  that the  2nd  Loku  Kumarihamy,  one  of the vendors  of deed  no.  45801 dated"
"26.07.1961 (5.1), died on 27.08.1943. The  Respondent submitted the death certificate of the 2nd"
"Loku  Kumarihamy (01.6).  The  Appellant was  unable to controvert this position. Accordingly, the"
"learned Additional  District Judge correctly concluded that the deed no.  45801 dated 26.07.1961"
"(5.1) did not transfer ownership of the corpus to the Appellant as  claimed by him."
"The learned counsel for the Appellant however submits that the learned Additional District Judge"
"erred  in  not  considering  that  the  Appellant  had,  in  addition  to  the  paper  title,  also  pleaded"
"prescriptive title which has received negligible if not no consideration at all. There is  some  merit"
"in  this  submission.  However,  the  proviso  to  Article  138(1)  of the  Constitution  states  that  no"
"judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect"
"or  irregularity,  which  has  not  prejudiced  the  substantial  rights  of the  parties  or  occasioned  a"
"failure of justice. Therefore,  even  where there is  a failure to satisfactorily consider the claim  of"
"prescriptive title pleaded  by the Appellant,  if it is  evident on  a close  examination  of the totality"
"of the evidence that the learned Additional  District Judge was  correct in  pronouncing judgment"
"in  favour  of the  Respondent,  there  is  no  prejudice  to the  substantial  rights  of the  parties  or"
"occasioned  a failure of justice and the judgment of the learned Additional  District Judge should"
"not be disturbed [Victor and Another v.  Cyril De Silva (1998)  1 Sri.L.R.  41]."
"The  position  of the Appellant is that they were in  possession  of the corpus from the time deed"
"no. 45801 dated 26.07.1961 (5.1) was executed in 1961. The evidence is that when this deed was"
"executed  in 1961, one  Heen  Menika was  working on  the paddy field forming the corpus  of the"
"partition action. She  happened to be  an  aunt of the Appellant.  In  fact, the wife of the Appellant"
"admitted that Heen  Menika was working the paddy field from 1952 to 1961."
