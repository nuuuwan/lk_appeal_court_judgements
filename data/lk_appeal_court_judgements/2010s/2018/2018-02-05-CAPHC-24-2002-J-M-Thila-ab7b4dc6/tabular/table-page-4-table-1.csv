"Perusal  of the judgment dated  2001-11-07 pronounced  by the"
"learned  Provincial  High  Court Judge shows that he  has  refused"
"the  application  of the Appellant on  the ground that there is  no"
"legal  duty on  the  part of the Respondent to pay back wages to"
"the Appellant."
"The  written  submission  filed  in  this Court on  behalf of the"
"Appellant also asserts the position  that the  Respondent had  not"
"so  far acceded  to his  request for re-instatement in  service."
"Thus, this Court too takes the view that the Appellant has failed"
"to satisfy that the  Respondent is  under a legal  duty to pay  him"
"back wages  in  these circumstances."
"Therefore the question  of paying  back wages  simply would  not"
"arise.  Resultant position  would  be  for this Court to conclude that"
"this appeal  is  an  appeal  which  has  been  filed  without any"
"justifiable reason."
