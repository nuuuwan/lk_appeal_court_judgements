"and Lot 3 was not considered as a part thereof."

"litigation  and  the  main  witnesses  who  have  given  evidence  at  the"
"trial  and  who  could  speak  to  the  pedigree  and  extent  of  the  land"
"are no more among the living, I direct that the land depicted in the"
"Preliminary Plan (X) shall be regarded as the land to be partitioned,"

"This  leads  me  to  consider  the  pedigree  dispute.    It  is  common"
"ground that the original owner of this land was Simon Rodrigo.  It"
"is  the  case  of  the  plaintiff  that  Simon  Rodrigo  had  four  children."
"All the other defendants including the 1st defendant have taken up"

"the death of Simon Rodrigo, Johanis had no claim on the balance"
"half share.  The certified copy of Deed P1 produced by the plaintiff"
"is not clear at all, but as far as I could read, it appears to me that"
"P1 is not a gift but an outright transfer."
