"Commissionerâ€™s  Plan  as  the  Preliminary  Plan,  and  the  petitioner"
"came before this Court by way of revision against it.  Upholding the"
"order  of  the  District  Judge,  Justice  Ranaraja  stated  that:  ""Section"
"18  of  the  Partition  Act  provides  for  parties  dissatisfied  with  the"
"Preliminary  Plan  prepared  on  commission  issued  by  Court  to  make"
"an  application  for  a  commission  to  issue  on  the  Surveyor-General."
"The  petitioner  has  not  availed  himself  of 
this  provision  of 
law."
"Similarly  there  is  a  provision  in  that  section  for  a  party  to  have  a"
"surveyor  who  conducted  the  survey  to  be  summoned  to  Court  and"
"examined 
in  any  matter  arising 
from 
the  Preliminary  Plan  and"
"Report  filed  in  Court.    The  petitioner  has  not  had  recourse  to  that"
"provision.    Instead  he  had  sought  a  fresh  commission  on  another"
"surveyor 
to  conduct  a  second  preliminary  survey  which 
is  not"
"permitted by law."""
"The  District  Judge  made  a  fundamental  error  by  accepting  the"
"alternative Plan as the Preliminary Plan."
"At this stage I must also mention that although the Judgment runs"
"into  34  pages,  it  merely  contains  repetition  of  evidence  led  at  the"
"trial.    There  is  no  proper  analysis  of  evidence,  which  is  what  is"
"expected from a Judge."
"Apart from the legal barrier, I cannot understand why the learned"
"District  Judge  accepted  the  alternative  Plan  on  facts.    It  appears"
"that  the  surveyor  who  prepared  the  alternative  Plan  has  tried  to"
"prepare a Plan showing two acres in extent as the plaint refers to a"
"land  of  that  extent.    Lot  3  of  the  alternative  Plan  (3V1)  cannot  in"
"my view form part of the corpus.  If it forms part of the corpus, the"
"southern  boundary  of  the  corpus  shall  be  Delgahawatta  and  the"
"road;  and  a  part  of  the  eastern  boundary  shall  also  be  the  road."
"But 
there 
is  no  road 
in 
the  southern  or  eastern  boundaries"
