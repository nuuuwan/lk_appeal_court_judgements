"It  is  significant  to  note  that,  in  the  Partition  Law,  there  is  no"
"provision  to  raise  issues.    Section  25(1)  of  the  Partition  Law,"
"which  deals  with  the  stage  of  the  commencement  of  the  trial,"
"does not speak of raising issues prior to the trial as in a regular"
"action (as stated in section 146 of the Civil Procedure Code), but"
"speaks of straightaway recording evidence to examine title to the"
"land  to  which  the  action  relates. 
  Nevertheless, 
in  partition"
"actions,  not  issues,  but  points  of  contest  are  recorded,  as  a"
"matter 
of 
practise, 
for 
convenience 
and 
to 
control 
the"
"proceedings."
"There  is  no  mandatory  rule  that  such  points  of  contest  shall"
"necessarily  be  raised  only  at  the  commencement  of  the  trial."
"Such  points  of  contest,  can,  depending  on 
the 
facts  and"
"circumstances  of  the  case,  be  raised  at  any  time  during  the"
"course of the trial, and, if I may add, even after the conclusion of"
"the trial, if the circumstances warrant such a course of action to"
"be followed."
"Section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code, which is applicable to a"
"regular  action,  reads  as  follows:  “The  court  may,  at  any  time"
"before  passing  a  decree,  amend  the  issues  or  frame  additional"
"issues on such terms as it thinks fit.”  Section 79 of the Partition"
"Law allows the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code"
"to be adopted in case of casus omissus."
"In Hameed v. Cassim [1996] 2 Sri LR at 33 Justice Ranaraja held"
"that: “The provisions of section 149……certainly do not preclude a"
"District  Judge  from  framing  a  new  issue  after  the  parties  have"
"closed their respective cases and before the judgment is read out"
"in open Court. It is not necessary that the new issue should arise"
"on  the  pleadings.  A  new  issue  could  be  framed  on  the  evidence"
