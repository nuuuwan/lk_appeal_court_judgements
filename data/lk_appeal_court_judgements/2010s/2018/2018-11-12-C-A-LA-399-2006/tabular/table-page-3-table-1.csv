"“Every  party  to  a  partition  action  shall,  not  less  than  thirty  days"
"before the date of the trial of the action, file or cause to be filed in"
"court  a  list  of  documents  on  which  he  relies  to  prove  his  right,"
"share or interest to, of or in the land together  with an abstract of"
"the  contents  of  such  documents.  No  party  shall,  except  with  the"
"leave  of  the  court  which  may  be  granted  on  such  terms  as  the"
"court  may  determine,  be  at 
liberty 
to  put  any  document 
in"
"evidence  on  his  behalf 
in 
the  action 
if 
that  document 
is  not"
"specified  in  a  list  filed  as  aforesaid.  Nothing  in  this  subsection"
"shall  apply 
to  documents  produced

"handed to a witness merely to refresh his memory.”"
"The  thirty-day  period  from  the  date  of  the  trial,  mentioned  in"
"this  section  was  interpreted  liberally  as  opposed  to  restrictively"
"by the Supreme Court in Pushpa v. Leelawathie [2004] 3 Sri LR"
"162 to include not only the first date of trial but also any date to"
"which  the  trial  is  postponed.    Chief  Justice  S.N.  Silva  at  page"
"163  stated:  “When  this  provision  is  considered  in  the  light  of"
"section 25(1) it is clear that the date of trial is not necessarily the"
"first  date  on  which  the  case 
is  fixed  for  trial  but  would  also"
"include any date to which the trial is postponed.”"
"Section 25(1) of the Partition Law reads as follows:"
"“On the date fixed for the trial of a partition action or on any other"
"date to  which the trial  may be postponed or adjourned, the court"
"shall  examine  the  title  of  each  party  and  shall  hear  and  receive"
"evidence 
in  support 
thereof  and  shall 
try  and  determine  all"
"questions  of  law  and  fact  arising  in  that  action  in  regard  to  the"
"right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or in the land to which"
"the  action  relates,  and  shall  consider  and  decide  which  of  the"
"orders mentioned in section 26 should be made.”"
