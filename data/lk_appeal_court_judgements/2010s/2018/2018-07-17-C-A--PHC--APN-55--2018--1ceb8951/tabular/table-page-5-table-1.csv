"The charges framed  under section  19(b) of the Bribery Act (i.e.  the  1st  and"
"3rd  counts in the Indictment) also do not allege the Accused  Petitioner to"
"be an  employee of SLICL."
"Therefore,  the question whether or not the Accused - Petitioner is an"
"employee of the SLICL,  simply does not arise for determination in the"
"instant case."
"It would  be  prudent at this stage to turn to the  relevant provisions under"
"which the charges have  been  framed  against the Accused  - Petitioner.  It is"
"under section  19 that the charges have been  framed.  It is as follows;"
"A person  -"
"(a).  who offers any gratification to a public servant as an  inducement or a"
"reward  for that public servant's performing or abstaining  from  performing"
"any official act, or expediting,  hindering or preventing  the performance of"
"any official act whether by that public servant or by any other public"
"servant, or assisting, favouring,  hindering or delaying any person  in the"
"transaction of any business with the Government, or"
"(b).  who,  being a public servant,  solicits or accepts any gratification as an"
"inducement or a reward  for his performing or abstaining  from  performing"
