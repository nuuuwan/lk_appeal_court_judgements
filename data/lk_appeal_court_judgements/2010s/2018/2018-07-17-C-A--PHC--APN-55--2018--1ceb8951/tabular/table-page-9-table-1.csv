"","The burden to prove the charges beyond  reasonable doubt would  be fairly"
"","and  squarely upon the Prosecution.  Until that is done, the accused  must be"
"","presumed to be  not guilty of the charges.  This pre-supposes that the"
"","prosecution  must prove all  ingredients of the offence with which the"
"","Accused  - Petitioner has been  charged."
"","In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the trial Judge should"
"","have refused  to entertain the Preliminary objection raised  on  behalf of the"
"","Accused  - Petitioner as that is not the occasion to decide that issue."
"","This Court observes that the prayer of the Accused  - Petitioner is to set"
"","aside the order of the  learned  High Court Judge dated  2017-12-15 and  for"
"","this Court to hold that the Accused  Petitioner is not a public servant within"
"","the meaning of the Bribery Act and discharge the Accused  Petitioner from"
"","further proceedings from  this case."
"","For the foregoing  reasons,  this Court has no legal  basis to grant the relief"
"","prayed for by the  Petitioner."
