nallotted portion.  Soon after the Preliminary Survey, the other"
"claimant-Mary  Nona 
(to  whom  the  surveyor  says  Notice  was"
"served)  has  filed  the  proxy.5    That  also  belies  the  petitioner’s"
"assertion that Notice was not served on her mother.  What more,"
"according  to  the  Report  of  the  Preliminary  Plan,  Lot  3  and  the"
"building and  plantation standing thereon have been claimed by"
"Ranso  Nona  and 
it  has  so  been  recorded  by  the  surveyor."
"Therefore,  there is no room whatsoever to say that she was not"
"given Notice.  According to section 18(2) of the Partition Law, No."
"21  of  1977,  as  amended,  such  Report  of  the  Surveyor  can  be"
"used  as  evidence  without  further  proof  subject  to  making  an"
"application  by  any  party 
to  call 
the  surveyor 
to  give  oral"
"evidence."
"The  petitioner  relies  only  on  the  Deed  No.  3864  marked  P5  to"
"claim rights from the corpus.  There had been another Partition"
"Case  No.  6656/P  to  the  adjoining  land.    The  petitioner  who  is"
"admittedly the 8th defendant in that case, has claimed title to the"
"land  to  be  partitioned  in  that  case  also  on  the  same  Deed  and"
"the  learned  District  Judge  in  that  case  has  accepted  that  Deed"
"and  given  rights―vide  the  statement  of  claim  marked  X1,  the"
"Judgment marked X3 and the Final Plan marked X2 tendered by"
"the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  plaintiffs. 
  The  petitioner  has"
"suppressed  that  fact  also  from  this  Court.    That  means,  the"
"rights  stemming  from  that  Deed  have  been  finally  decided,  and"
"the petitioner cannot now produce the same Deed to claim title"
"to the adjoining land which is the subject matter of the present"
"case.    The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  draws"
"5 Vide JE No.15 of the DC Case Record and the proxy is found at page 403 of"
"the Case Record."
