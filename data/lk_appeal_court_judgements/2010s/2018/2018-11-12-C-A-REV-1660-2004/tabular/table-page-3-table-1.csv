"T
he  petitioner  knows 
it  and  therefore  explains  the  delay 
in"
"paragraphs  20-22  of  the  petition.    What  the  petitioner  in  those"
"paragraphs  says  is  that,  as  he  was  not  a  party  to  the  case,  he"
"could  not  seek  relief  from  the  Court,  but  he  awaited  until  the"
"outcome  of  the  application  of  the  11A  defendant  who  made  an"
"application to  the District Court to  set aside the Judgment and"
"the  Interlocutory  Decree,  and  the  District  Court  allowed  that"
"application by order dated 16.10.2001, which was later set aside"
"by this Court on 28.06.2004."
"In  a revision  application,  there  is  no  necessity  for  this  Court  to"
"call for the original case record from the District Court.  The law"
"requires  the  petitioner  to  tender  all  the  material  documents."
"However, in this case, this Court has called for the original case"
"record for another purpose."
"When  I  go  through  the  original  case  record,  it  is  clear  that  the"
"above 
explanation 
of 
the 
petitioner 
contains 
serious"
"suppressions and misrepresentations of core matters."
"The  learned  District  Judge,  in  the  Judgment,  has  left  ½  of  the"
"corpus  unallotted. 
  The  petitioner  together  with  nine  others"
"including  his  mother-Ranso  Nona  (who  were  not  parties  to  the"
"case) has made an application to the District Court by way of a"
"petition  dated  02.05.2000  and  an  affidavit  dated  24.05.2000"
"seeking  permission  to  lead  evidence  to  claim  their  undivided"
"rights from the ½ portion left unallotted and thereafter to amend"
"the 
Interlocutory  Decree 
and  prepare 
a 
fresh 
scheme 
of"
"partition.1 
  The  petitioner’s  proxy  dated  24.05.2000  and  the"
