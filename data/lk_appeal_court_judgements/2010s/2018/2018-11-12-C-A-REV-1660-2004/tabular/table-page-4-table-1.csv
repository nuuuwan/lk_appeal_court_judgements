"p
etitioner’s  mother’s  proxy  dated  19.03.2000  are  also  found  in"
"the  original  case  record.2    The  petitioner  has  suppressed  this"
"vital fact from this Court and the said application (made by way"
"of petition and affidavit) has not been tendered to this Court."
"Thereafter  the  matter  has  been 
fixed 
for  the 
inquiry  by  the"
"District 
Court 
and 
according 
to 
the 
proceedings 
dated"
"20.11.2000,  at  the 
inquiry,  the  present  petitioner  has  given"
"evidence  without  any  objection 
from  anybody 
including 
the"
"Attorney-at-Law of the plaintiffs.3  Without any reference to such"
"application  or  inquiry,  I  find  those  proceedings  among  other"
"documents tendered by the petitioner."
"The  petitioner’s  claim 
is 
for  Lot  3 
in 
the  Preliminary  Plan"
"together with the house standing thereon.  This he has claimed"
"in his evidence at the inquiry."
"After  leading  all  the  evidence,  for  reasons  best  known  to  the"
"petitioner and his lawyer, the application has been withdrawn.4"
"It must be mentioned that, at that time, although the scheme of"
"partition  had  been  prepared  by 
the 
surveyor  as  per 
the"
"Interlocutory Decree, no Scheme Inquiry had been held."
"I  guess 
that 
the  petitioner  and  nine  others  withdrew 
that"
"application  placing  reliance  on  the  prospect  of  success  of  the"
"application  of 
the  11A  defendant,  which  ultimately  did  not"
"materialize."
