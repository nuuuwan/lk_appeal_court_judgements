"In  Dabare v. Appuhamy10  the defendant’s objection to  dismiss the"
"plaintiff’s  action  on  res  judicata  was  overruled.    On  appeal  by  the"
"defendant, the plaintiff submitted that the dismissal  of his former"
"action  was  invalid  as  the  judge  in  the  former  case  followed  the"
"wrong  procedure  in  that  instead  of  summary  procedure,  regular"
"procedure  was  followed.    At  that  time,  the  plaintiff  had  not  taken"
"objection 
to 
the  wrong  procedure  being 
followed. 
  This  Court"
"rejecting 
that  argument  and  allowing 
the  appeal  stated 
that"
"notwithstanding 
the 
former 
judge 
had 
followed 
the  wrong"
"procedure, the order of dismissal made by him was valid since he"
"had jurisdiction to hear and determine the action and the plaintiff"
"did  not  take  objection  to  the  wrong  procedure  being  followed  at"
"that time."
"Hence the submission of the 1st and 2nd petitioners that the former"
"order  dated  28.01.2000  is  a  nullity  as  the  proper  procedure  was"
"not followed is not entitled to succeed."
"In any event, the reason why the 1st and 2nd petitioners say that"
"the summary procedure was not followed is that the 3rd petitioner"
"and  the  intervenient  petitioner  “did  not  obtain  an  order  nisi  in  the"
"first 
instance  and  have 
the  same  served  on 
the  1st  and  2nd"
"petitioners”."
"There 
is  no  compulsion 
to  obtain  order  nisi  under  summary"
"procedure  as  section  377  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  provides  for"
"either  obtaining 
(b)  an 
interlocutory  order 
(a)  an  order  nisi  or"
"appointing  a  day  for  the  determination  of  the  matter.    Here  the"
"Court has acted under (b) above even though it does not expressly"
"state so."
