"application filed before this Court.  (Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake"
"v.  Times  of  Ceylon  Limited1,  Arumugam  v.  Kumaraswamy2  )    Here"
"the  portion  ""unless  the  defaulter  first  purges  default""  was  added"
"within  brackets 
for 
the  purpose  of  better  understanding 
the"
"principle,  but 
in 
fact, 
that  part 
is  redundant  because 
if 
the"
"defaulter  is  successful  in  purging  default,  the  judgment  or  order"
"will automatically be set aside regardless of its merits."
"There  cannot  be  any  dispute  that  the  1st  and  2nd  petitioners  in"
"their  application  dated  23.07.2001  did  not  plead  in  the  prayer  to"
"purge their default, but pleaded to set aside the ex parte order on"
"merits."
"It  is  the  submission  of  the  1st  and  2nd  petitioners  that  the  earlier"
"order  of 
the  District  Court  dated  28.01.2000 
is  per 
incuriam"
"because  the  summary  procedure  as  stipulated  in  section  538  of"
"Civil  Procedure  Code  has  not  been  followed  when  recalling  the"
"Probate  and  therefore  the  question  of  purging  default  does  not"
"arise as a per incuriam order is a nullity ab initio."
"It  is  noteworthy  that  the  1st  and  2nd  petitioners  did  not  take  up"
"such  a  position  in  their  objections  filed  before  the  District  Court"
"prior 
to 
the 
said  order  dated  28.01.2000  was  made.  Their"
"objections  were  based  on  the  merits  of the  matter  and  not on  the"
"procedure.  They took up such a position for the first time in their"
"application  dated  23.7.2001  made  more  than  1  Â½  years  after"
"making the first order."
