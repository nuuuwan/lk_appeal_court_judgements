"According  to  tX4',  the  prosecution  officer  at  the  Inquiry  had  submitted  that"
"when the officers of the  Post Audit Compliance  and  Facilitating  Directorate of"
"the  Sri  Lanka  Customs  examined 
the  previous 
import  documents  of  the"
"Petitioner, it was discovered that the values declared by the Petitioner are very"
"low  compared  to  similar  goods  in  the  market.  Therefore,  Sri  Lanka  Customs"
"had  decided  to  investigate  the  previous  imports  of  the  Petitioner  and  had"
"called  over  at  the  address  declared  by  the  Petitioner  to  Sri  Lanka  Customs."
"However,  the  customs  found  that  there  was  no  such  business  at  the  given"
"address."
"The  Officers  of  Sri  Lanka  Customs  had 
later  found 
that  the  Petitioner  was"
"operating  from  a  different  address,  and  had  then  visited  the  said  premises."
"After  questioning 
the  Petitioner, 
the  Officers  of  Sri  Lanka  Customs  had"
"removed the computers of the Petitioner for further examination. The  Officers"
"of Sri  Lanka  Customs had  retrieved deleted email correspondence between the"
"revealed 
evidence 
Petitioner  and 
his 
business 
counterparts  which 
had"
"suggestive of the Petitioner having undervalued the goods imported by him."
"In  considering the relief sought by the Petitioner, the first step for this Court is"
"to examine the basis  of the application  in  the context of the  provisions of the"
"Customs Ordinance."
"The  Customs  Ordinance  stands  on  three  important  pillars.  The  first  is  that all"
"goods  imported  (or  exported)  to  the  country  must  be  declared  to  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs!.  The  second  is  that  a  proper  and  truthful  description  of the  goods"
"must be  made  at the time of importation. The  third  and  final  pillar is  that the"
"price  actually  paid  or  payable  for the  goods  must  be  declared  at  the  time  of"
"1  Section 47 ofthe Customs Ordinance."
