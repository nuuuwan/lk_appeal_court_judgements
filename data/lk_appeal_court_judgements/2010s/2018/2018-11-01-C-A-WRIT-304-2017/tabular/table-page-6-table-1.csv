â€¢  One  without  the  other  will  not  enable  Sri  Lanka  Customs  to"
"charge  the  correct  import  duties  and  taxes  on  the  goods  imported  into  the"
"country. This  is  reflected  in  Section  10 of the Customs  Ordinance,  which  reads"
"as follows:"
"liThe  several  duties  of  customs,  as  the  same  are  respectively  inserted,"
"described, and  set forth in figures in the table of duties (Schedule A)3  shall"
"be  levied and  paid  upon all  goods, wares,  and  merchandise imported into"
"or exported from Sri  Lanka""."
"Several  provisions  of the  Customs  Ordinance  require  an 
importer  to  declare"
"the value of the goods and  sets out the consequences of not doing so.  In terms"
"of Section 47  of the Customs Ordinance, every consignee  is  required  to tender"
"a Bill  of Entry,  commonly  referred  to as  the  Customs  Declaration  or 'Cus  Dec'"
"setting  out the  details  that are  required  in  the  said  declaration  including  the"
"value of the goods that are the subject matter of the said  Bill of Entry."
"'In  all  cases  when  the 
Section  51  of  the  Customs  Ordinance  specifies  that,"
"duties  imposed  upon  the  importation of articles  are  charged  according to the"
"value  thereof,  the  respective  value  of each  such  article  shall  be  stated  in  the"
"entry 
together  with 
the  description  and  quantity  of  the  same,  and  duly"
"affirmed  by  a declaration  made  by  the  importer or his  agent  on  a form 4 
...  as"
"may  be  specified  by 
the  Director  General 
......  and  such 
value  shall  be"
"determined  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Schedule  E,  and  duties  shall"
"be paid on a value so determined.'"

In  terms  of Schedule  E of the  Customs  Ordinance,  the  customs  value  of any  imported  goods  shall  be  the"
"transaction value, that is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to Sri  Lanka, as"
"may be adjusted and determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule E."
"4 This form is  known as the 'Value Declaration Form.'"
