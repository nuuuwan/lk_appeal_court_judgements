"","overruled  by 
the 
Inquiry  Officer, 
the  Petitioner  had  not  taken  part  at  the"
"","inquiry thereafter, bringing the said  inquiry to a halt."
"","The  facts  which  are  relevant  to  the  consideration  of the  relief  sought  are  as"
"","follows."
"","The  Petitioner is  carrying  on  a sole  proprietorship  under the  name,  style  and"
"","firm of 'Greenways'. The  said  entity is  engaged  in  the importation of electrical"
"","goods and gas (LPG) cookers, gas (LPG)  regulators and other LPG  appliances."
"","The  Petitioner claims that without having an  'iota of evidence' against him, the"
"","officers of Sri  Lanka  Customs  had  'raided' his shop situated at Colombo 11 and"
"","requested  the  Petitioner to  grant them  access  to  his  email  accounts  without"
"","having  a  Court  order  to 
that  effect.  The  Petitioner  states 
that  Sri  Lanka"
"","Customs  had 
thereafter  commenced  an 
inquiry  against  the  Petitioner,  with"
"","regard  to certain  imports  made  by the  Petitioner. The  Petitioner has  annexed"
"","to 
the  petition,  marked 
'X4',  a  copy  of  the 
inquiry  proceedings  and 
the"
"","documents marked at the said  Inquiry."
"I","This Court has examined 'X4' and observes that the Inquiry had  commenced on"
"",""
"","26th  April  2016  and  proceedings  have  been  held  over  several  days  during the"
"","course  of which  the evidence  of the  Customs  Officers  who  had  been  involved"
"","in  the  investigations  had  been  recorded.  This  is 
inspite  of the  Inquiry  having"
"","been  postponed  on  several  occasions,  due  to  the  absence  of the  Petitioner."
"","This  Court  also  observes 
that  the  Petitioner  had  been 
represented  by  an"
"","Attorney-at-Law  at  the  Customs 
Inquiry  and  that  the  prosecution  witnesses"
"","had been cross examined by the Petitioner's Counsel."
