"procedural  impropriety but is  claiming that the collection  of evidence  and  the"
"decision to hold the inquiry is illegal, which Diplock J,  has described as follows:"
"""By 
'illegality'  as  a  ground  for  judicial  review 
I  mean 
that  the  decision"
"maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making"
"power and  must give effect to it. Whether he  has  or not is  par excellence a"
"justiciable question to be  decided in the event of dispute, by those persons,"
"the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable."""
"The  Petitioner  claims  that  Customs  duty  on  the  goods  imported  by  him  has"
"been 
imposed  not  on 
the  value  of  the  good  but  on 
'per  piece'  basis.  The"
"Petitioner's first argument therefore  is  that where  customs  duty on  a good  is"
"not charged  based  on  its value, Sri  Lanka  Customs cannot invoke the provisions"
"of  Section  51  of  the  Customs  Ordinance.  This  Court  has  examined 
the"
"documents  marked  at  the  Inquiry  in  the  presence  of the  Petitioner  and  his"
"Attorney-at-Law,  and  notes  that  the  Petitioner  has 
in 
fact  submitted  Value"
"Declaration  Forms 
in 
terms  of  Section  51,  at 
the 
time  he  submitted 
the"
"Customs  Declarations,  which 
indicates  that  customs  duty  is  payable  on 
the"
"value.  Furthermore, 
this  Court  observes, 
as 
per  some  of 
the  Customs"
"Declarations  produced  at the  inquiry that  customs  duties  have  been  charged"
"on the value of the goods imported as opposed to the number of pieces. 13"
"Thus,  the  first  argument  of the  Petitioner  is 
incorrect  and 
is  devoid  of  any"
"merit.  This  Court  is  of the  view  that  issues  such  as 
the  basis  of calculating"
"duties and the rate at which customs duties have in fact been  paid, are  matters"
"that  need  to  be  decided  at the  Customs  Inquiry,  where  the  Petitioner will  be"
"afforded an  opportunity of challenging the evidence led."
"13  This is borne out by the Customs Declarations marked as  'D10b', 'DUb', 'D12b', 'D13b', 'D14b', 'D1Sc' and"
"'D20b' at the Inquiry."
