learned  counsel 
for  the  petitioner  accepts  that  a  party"
"cannot  by  way  of  a  final  appeal  come  before  this  Court  against"
"the  Judgment  or  Order  of  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal.    But"
"the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  is  that,  nevertheless,  a"
"party can come before this Court against the Judgment or Order"
"of  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  by  way  of  revision  and/or"
"restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution."
"If  that  argument  is  accepted,  section  5C  becomes  meaningless,"
"and the intention of the legislature will blatantly be defeated, as"
"any  party  dissatisfied  with  any  Judgment  or  Order  of  the  High"
"Court  of  Civil  Appeal  can  come  before  this  Court  by  way  of"
"revision 
and/or 
 
Then 
the 
party 
restitutio 
in 
integrum."
"dissatisfied with the Judgment or Order of the District Court will"
"have  three  appeals―first  to  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal,"
"second to the Court of Appeal, and third to the Supreme Court."
"That was obviously never the intention of the legislature.  One of"
"the  main  objectives  of  setting  up  High  Courts  of  Civil  Appeal  is"
"to curb laws delays in civil litigation and not to expand it."
"Article  138(1) of the Constitution  (without the proviso) reads as"
"follows:"
"“The  Court  of  Appeal  shall  have  and  exercise  subject 
to 
the"
"provisions  of 
the  Constitution  or  of  any 
law,  an  appellate"
"jurisdiction  for  the  correction  of  all  errors  in  fact  or  in  law  which"
"shall  be  committed  by 
the  High  Court, 
in 
the  exercise  of 
its"
"appellate or original jurisdiction or by any court of First Instance,"
"tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by"
"way  of  appeal,  revision  and  restitutio  in  integrum,  of  all  causes,"
"suits,  actions,  prosecutions,  matters  and  things  of  which  such"
