"H
igh  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  does  not  have 
jurisdiction 
for"
"According 
to  paragraph  20  of 
the  petition, 
the 
restitution."
"petitioners  then  filed  this  application  before  this  Court,  as  the"
"power  for  restitutio  in  integrum  is  vested  in  this  Court.1    That"
"means,  the  petitioners  have  considered  this  application  purely"
"as  an  application  for  restitutio  in  integrum,  for  otherwise,  they"
"could 
have, 
without 
any 
difficulty, 
proceeded 
with 
the"
"application for revision filed in the High Court of Civil Appeal of"
"Ratnapura."
"I  must  state  that  there  is  no  magic  in  the  word  restitution,  as"
"that 
relief, 
in  my  view,  can  also  be  sought 
in  a 
revision"
"application.  Although, in law, revision and restitutio in integrum"
"are two different applications, in practice, they go hand in hand,"
"and, almost all the time, are sought in combination."
"I  must  also  state  that,  in  view  of  section  5D(2)  of  Act  No.19  of"
"1990 (as introduced by Act No. 54 of 2006),  the legislature has"
"not deliberately and completely shut out the High Court of Civil"
"Appeal  from  exercising  jurisdiction  on  applications  for  restitutio"
"in intergrum as that section permits the President of the Court of"
"Appeal  to  send  pending  appeals,  applications  in  revision  and"
"restitutio  in  integrum  to  the  relevant  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal"
"for hearing and determination."
"Be that as it may, there is no dispute that the petitioners are not"
"parties to the case.  They tried to intervene as parties, after the"
"pronouncement  of  the  Partition  Judgment―to  be  exact  at  the"
"Scheme Inquiry.  According to section 69(1) of the Partition Law,"
"1  Paragraph  20  reads 
thus: 
“The  petitioners  state 
that  accordingly 
the"
"petitioners prefer this application to Your Lordships Court whereas the power"
"of restitutio in integrum is vested with your Lordships Court.”"
