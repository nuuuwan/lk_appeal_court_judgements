"plaintiff's version.  The  findings  of the  learned  District Judge  with  regard  to facts"
"cannot be  lightly interfered with by an  appellate court unless they are irrational or"
"perverse. 
{Vide Alwis Vs  Piyasena  Ferando (1993) (1) SLR.  119, Frad  Vs  Brown and"
"Company  28  NLR  282,  De  Silva  Vs  Senevirathna  1981(2)  SLR  8}. 
I  do  not  have"
"sufficient material before me  to say that the findings of the learned  District Judge"
"are irrational or perverse. In one occasion the defendant had said that Sugunawathi"
"Gunawardena,  one  of the  predecessors  in  title  of the  Plaintiff as  per the  plaint,"
"possessed  a  portion  of land  beyond  the  railway  line  but  later on  the  Defendant"
"denied that she  had seen said Suganawathi Gunawardena and any knowledge with"
"regard  to her but the  learned  District Judge  who  had  the  opportunity to observe"
"the Defendant giving evidence has not moved due to this answer which appears to"
"be  contradictory  but relied  on  the  Defendant's  evidence.  I do  not think that this"
"court without having the opportunity of observing the witnesses should  interfere"
"with  the  findings  of the  learned  District  Judge  owing  to  this  single  occasion  of"
"seemingly  contradictory  answer. 
Perhaps  the  Defendant  would  have  revealed"
"what she  has  heard  about the  portion  of land  belongs  to  Sugunawathi,  without"
"knowing or ever seeing said Suganawathi."
