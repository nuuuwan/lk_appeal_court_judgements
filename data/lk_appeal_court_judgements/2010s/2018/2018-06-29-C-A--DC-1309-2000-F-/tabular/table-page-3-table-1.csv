"following elements;"
"1.  The  Plaintiff is the owner of the subject matter."
"2.  The  Plaintiff placed the Defendant as a licensee."
"3.  The  Defendant  refused  to  leave  the  subject  matter when  asked  and  even"
"after the termination of license."
"4.  Therefore, the defendant became a trespasser in the subject matter."
"If the  Plaintiff was  successful  in  proving that the  Defendant was  his  licensee,  he"
