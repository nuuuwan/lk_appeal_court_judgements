"The document marked P3A is vital in that it is a certified copy of the proceedings"
"in the  Primary  Court.  This  document  was  produced  when  the  Defendant  was"
"cross~examined by the Counsel for  the Plaintiff.  In this  document the Defendant"
"has  admitted that the  Plaintiff Nathan had taken a portion of the land,  put up a"
"shed and had been in possession of the said land for  2 1;2  years  and that the land"
"belongs  to Kandasamy Kovil.  He  also admitted that he uprooted the posts of the"
"plaintiff's shed and removed the shed. Although this document was objected to at"
"the  time  of production,  it was  not objected  to  at the  time  of the  closure  of the"
"plaintiff's case. The learned Trial Judge has drawn attention in his judgment to this"
"failure on the part of the Defendant."
