"the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board. 
  When 
the"
"respondents in their objections took up the position that according"
"to the case of the petitioners National Water Supply and Drainage"
"Board is a necessary party, the petitioners in paragraph 4.7 of the"
"written 
submissions  have 
taken  up 
the  position 
that 
""The"
"petitioners  are exclusively concerned  with  the supply of  water from"
"Tissawewa  for  performance  of  religious  activities  and  they  are  not"
"so concerned with the supply of water for drinking purpose."""
"The  respondents  in  their  objections  have  taken  up  the  position"
"that water of Tissawewa is not nowadays used to perform religious"
"rites,  and  this  has  not  been  disputed  by  the  petitioners,  and  in"
"reply  say  that 
it 
is  due  to  the  water  pollution  of  Tissawewa."
"However  there  is  no  evidence  before  Court  from  any  responsible"
"party including the Chief Prelate in charge of Sri Maha Bodhi that"
"the  water  of  Tissawewa  is  not  now  used  for  religious  rites  due  to"
"pollution."
"Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs."
"Before I part with this Judgment it must be emphasised that there"
"cannot  be  any  doubt  that  water  pollution  of  Tissawewa  shall  be"
"stopped.    However  blanket  prohibition  of  bathing  without  a viable"
"alternative  will  gravely  affect  the  ordinary  devotees  who  flock  to"
"Anuradhapura for religious observances and also the daily lives of"
"residents in the surrounding areas. A right balance between these"
"two competing interests shall be the order of the day and steps in"
"that direction shall in my view be taken not by District Agricultural"
"Committees but by national level with the direct involvement of the"
"central government for the greater benefit of the public."
