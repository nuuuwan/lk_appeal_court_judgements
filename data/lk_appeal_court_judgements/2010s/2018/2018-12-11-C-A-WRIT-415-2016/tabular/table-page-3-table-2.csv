"Wimalawansa  Thero  [2011]  2  Sri  LR  258  at  267  the  Supreme"
"Court held that:"
"The 
first 
rule 
regarding 
the  necessary  parties 
to  an"
"application  for  a  writ  of  certiorari 
is  that  the  person  or"
"authority  whose  decision  or  exercise  of  power  is  sought  to"
"be 
quashed 
should 
be  made 
a 
respondent 
to 
the"
"application.  If  it  is  a  body of  persons  whose  decision  or"
"exercise  of  power 
is  sought  to  be  quashed  each  of  the"
"persons constituting such body who took part in taking the"
"impugned decision or the exercise of power should be made"
"respondent. The failure to make him or them respondents to"
"the  application  is  fatal  and  provides  in  itself  a  ground  for"
"the dismissal of the application in limine."
"If  the  act  sought  to  be  impugned  had  been  done  by  one"
"party on a direction given by another party who has power"
"granted  by  law  to  give  such  direction,  the  party  who  had"
"given the direction is also a necessary party and the failure"
"to  make  such  party  a  respondent  is  fatal  to  the  validity  of"
"the application."
