"NLR 292],  Sharvananda, J.  clearly and  deeply observed that,"
"""The  principle of law is  well established that a  person who"
"bases  his  title  in  adverse  possession  must show by clear"
"and unequivocal evidence  that his possession  was  hostile"
"to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the"
"to 
property 
claimed. 
In 
order 
constitute 
adverse"
"possession,  the possession must be in denial of the  title of"
"the 
true  owner.  The  acts  of  the  person 
in  possession"
"should be  irreconcilable  with  the  rights  of the  true  owner;"
"the person in possession must claim to be so as of right as"
"against the  true owner.  Where  there  is  no hostility to  or denial"
"of 
the 
title  of 
the 
true 
owner 
there 
can 
be  no 
adverse"
"possession.  In  deciding  whether the  alleged acts  of the  person"
"constitute  adverse  possession, 
regard  must  be  had 
to 
the"
"those  acts,  and 
this  must  be 
animus  of  the  person  doing"
"ascertained from  the  facts  and circumstances of each  case  and"
"the 
relationship  of 
the  parties.  Possession  which  may  be"
"presumed  to  be  adverse 
in 
the  case  of a  stranger  may  not"
"attract such  a  presumption,  in  the  case  of persons  standing  in"
"certain social or legal relationships.  The  presumption represents"
"the  most likely inference that may be drawn  in  the context of the"
"relationship  of  the  parties. 
The  Court  will  always  attribute"
