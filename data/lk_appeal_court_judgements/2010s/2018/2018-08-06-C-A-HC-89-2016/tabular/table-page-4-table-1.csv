"The counsel for the appellant argued that there was no concrete or"
"cogent evidence to justify the learned High  Court Judge's order made on"
"24/06/2016 refusing the appellant's application.  He argued that an officer"
"of the Matara prison has given evidence to say that the appellant was not"
"found  after the tsunami.  On  perusal of the evidence of this witnesses we"
"find  that he  has stated  many  prisoners escaped  during  the  disaster and"
"later  surrendered  to  the  prison  but  the  appellant  has  not  surrendered,"
"after  he  escaped.  This  evidence  shows  that  he  has  been  deliberately"
"avoiding the trial."
