"It is  the above  pedigree that the learned  trial judge decided  to accept after his  investigation of"
"title. The Appellant contends that this was incorrect as the pedigree was unsubstantiated and the"
"evidence of the plaintiff and  the 13th  Respondent inconsistent. However, one is able to discern a"
"valid deed supporting each  link in  the chain  of this pedigree. The Appellant has  not at any point"
"sought to impeach the genuineness of any of the deeds. In those circumstances, the presumption"
"in section 68 of the Partition Law1 would come into play and the trial judge was entitled to accept"
"the  deeds  without any formal  proof of their due  execution.  [Wimalawathie  v Hemawathie and"
"others (2009)  1 S.L.R.  95] Therefore  I am  of the opinion that the learned trial judge was  correct"
"in  relying on the 13th  Respondent's pedigree to determine who had title over the corpus."
