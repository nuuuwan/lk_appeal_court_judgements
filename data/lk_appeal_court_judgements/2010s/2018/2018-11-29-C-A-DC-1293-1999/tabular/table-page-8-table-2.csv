"The  question therefore is  whether the trial judge adhered to these  legal  standards in  accepting"
"the pedigree of the 13th  Respondent over and above the other pedigrees available."
"The  learned  trial  judge  seems  to  have  not accepted  the  pedigree  of the  original  Plaintiff as  it"
"contained  a key flaw.  According to the original  Plaintiff's  pedigree,  one  Deva  Leuneris Silva  had"
"obtained title over the 1/3 undivided share of the corpus by way of Fiscal  Conveyance No 10367"
"dated 1905.03.21. However, a perusal of the said Fiscal Conveyance and the corresponding Order"
"Confirming Sale dated 1905.01.05 (Vide pages 298 - 300 of the Appeal Brief) only reveals that an"
"undivided  2/3  part  of the  land  described  was  sold  to  one  Daballage  Carolishamy.  The  Fiscal"
"Conveyance does not at any point show that the remaining 1/3 undivided share was sold to Deva"
"Leunaris Silva  or as  to who had title to that share.  Therefore,  since  the pedigree  of the original"
"Plaintiff had a defect at its earliest point of time, the learned trial judge has very correctly refused"
"to accept that pedigree."
