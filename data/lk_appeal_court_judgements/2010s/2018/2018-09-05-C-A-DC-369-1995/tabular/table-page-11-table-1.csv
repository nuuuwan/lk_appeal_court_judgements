"Appellant's  another  submission  before 
this  Court  was 
that  the  plaintiff  has"
"failed to  identify the corpus because the Plaintiff has sought to partition the land"
"in extent of 2 Acres 2 Roods and 38 Perches as  described in the schedule to  the"
"plaint.  However,  in  the  Preliminary  Plan  bearing  No.  3265  prepared by  K.S."
"Samarasinghe  Licensed  Surveyor,  extent  of the  land  which  was  surveyed  is  a"
"land  of 2  Acres  2  Roods  and  19  Perches.  Therefore, 
the  Appellant  further"
"submitted  that  the  plaintiff  has  failed 
to 
identify  of the  corpus  and  learned"
"District Judge  has  not considered these  discrepancy  of the  extent of the  corpus"
"and variety of the boundaries."
"After the evaluation of the deeds submitted by both parties, it is  seem to  me that"
"the  Preliminary Plan bearing No.  3265  only indicate the extent of the land as  2"
"Acres  2  Roods  19  Perches  but 
there 
is  no  a  single  discrepancy  on 
the"
"boundaries."
"Deeds  marked by the  Plaintiff,  Appellant to  the  land called  'Gonnagahamula'"
"are  indicating  a  same  extent  as  2  Acres  2  Roods  and  38  Perches.  The  same"
"descriptions  has  probably  been  copied 
from  an  earlier  original  deed  and"
"conveyed by all parties. The subsequent misdescription cannot alter the effect of"
"that conveyance.  Further the  trail  of this  action proceeded after certain matters"
"in  dispute between  the  parties were  recorded,  but no  specific  issue  was  framed"
"regarding the actual corpus to be partitioned."
"I  am 
in  a  view 
that  this 
is  a  case  of  ""fa/sa  demonstratio  non  nocet""  (Dzd?"
