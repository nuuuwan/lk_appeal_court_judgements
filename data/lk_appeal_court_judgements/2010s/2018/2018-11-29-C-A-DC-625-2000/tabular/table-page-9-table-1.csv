"W
hen  the  relationship  between  the  parties  is  close  such  as  in"
"the instant action, the overt act manifesting the commencement"
"of  adverse  possession  and 
strong  affirmative 
evidence 
for"
"continuation  of  such  adverse  possession  are  all 
the  more"
"important. (De Silva v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 80"
"NLR 292, Podihamy v. Elaris [1988] 2 Sri LR 129)"
"The  5A  defendant  in  this  case  far  from  establishing  adverse"
"possession, at least, never took up the position that he and his"
"predecessors  maintained  adverse  possession  against  the  other"
"parties of the case."
"What the 5A defendant stated in evidence was that he does not"
"know  how  and  when  his  grandmotherâ€•Magi  Nona  came  into"
"possession.   As Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva held in Sirajudeen"
"v.  Abbas 
[1994]  2  Sri  LR  365: 
""Where  a  party 
invokes 
the"
"provisions  of  section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance  in  order  to"
"defeat 
the  ownership  of  an  adverse 
claimant 
to 
immovable"
"property,  the  burden  of  proof  rests  squarely  and fairly  on  him  to"
"establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive"
"rights.    A  facile  story  of  walking  into  abandoned  premises  after"
"the Japanese air raid constitutes material far too slender to found"
"a claim based on prescriptive title."""
"The prescriptive claim of the 5A defendant fails."
"Appeal is dismissed but without costs."
