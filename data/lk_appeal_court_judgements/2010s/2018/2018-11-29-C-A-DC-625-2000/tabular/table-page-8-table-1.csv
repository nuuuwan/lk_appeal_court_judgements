"M
agi  Nona  had  earlier  been  a  co-owner,  but  later  alienated  her"
"rights  by  the  Deed  P6.    Nevertheless,  she  continued  to  live  on"
"the 
land 
followed  by  her  successors-in-title,  the  5th  and  5A"
"defendants,  for  a  very  long  time―may  be  more  than  45  years."
"The 1A plaintiff who was 50 years of age in his evidence admits"
"that  Magi  Nona  and  her  son-Akmon  had  been  in  possession"
"from the time he can remember.3"
"However, 
long 
possession 
alone 
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as"
"prescriptive possession. In terms of section 3 of the Prescription"
"Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871, as amended,  such  possession to be"
"treated 
as 
prescriptive 
shall 
be 
adverse 
to 
or 
inter 
alia"
"independent  of  that  of  the  real  owner.  Permissive  possession  to"
"become  adverse  possession, 
the  claimant  must  establish  a"
"starting  point  for  his  acquisition  of  prescriptive  rights.    This"
"cannot be done by forming a secret intention unaccompanied by"
"an act of ouster."
"“It  is  well  settled  law  that  a  person  who  entered  property  in  a"
"subordinate  character  cannot  claim  prescriptive 
rights 
till  he"
"changes his character by an overt act. He is not entitled to do so"
"by forming a secret intention unaccompanied by an act of ouster."
"The  proof  of  adverse  possession  is  a  condition  precedent  to  the"
"claim  for  prescriptive  rights.”    (Seeman  v.  David  [2000]  3  Sri  LR"
