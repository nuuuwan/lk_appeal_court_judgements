ona was one of the three children of Wanasinghe Mudalige Don"
"Piloris Appuhamy―one of the original owners of the land referred"
"to above."
"This is also fortified by P9―a certified copy of the proceedings in"
"a Village Tribunal case had between Baba Guraa (the transferee"
"of 
the  Deed  P5)  as 
the  plaintiff,  and 
the  5A  defendant’s"
"grandmother―Wanasinghe

Magi 
Nona 
as 
the"
"defendant,  regarding  a  dispute 
in  respect  of  ownership  and"
"possession of Wanasinghe Mudalige Don Piloris Appu’s share."
"In P9, it is, inter alia, recorded as follows: “This defendant denies"
"that she caused any damage to plaintiff by reason of not allowing"
"plaintiff  to  possess  the  said  land  or  pay  any  house  rent  as  this"
"defendant’s  father  Wanasinghe  Mudalige  Don  Piloris  Appu  was"

"before  this  Court  that  the  Court  should  not  have  allowed  that"
"document  to  be  marked  through  the  5A  defendant  because  he"
"has  stated 
in  evidence  that  he  was  not  aware  of  that  case."
"However,  it  is  noteworthy  that,  although  the  5A  defendant  was"
"represented  by  a  senior  counsel  at  that  time,  the  said  senior"
"counsel  has  not  objected 
to 
it. 
 
If

the  5A"
"defendant  wanted  to  object  to  that  document,  it  should  have"
