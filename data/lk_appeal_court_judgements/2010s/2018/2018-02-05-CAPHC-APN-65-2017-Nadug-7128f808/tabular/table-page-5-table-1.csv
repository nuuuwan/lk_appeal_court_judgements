"this Court that the Petitioner (who  has  so  insisted  as  mentioned  above)  is"
"under a duty by himself to  make  sure that he  complies  with the said  rules"
"before  pointing  his finger at the opposite  party for such  noncompliance."
"Unfortunately,  it is  a fact that the  Petitioner  has  failed  to ensure such"
"compliance."
"Rule  3 (1) (a)  and  (b)3  is as  follows:"
""" ...  Every application  made to the Court of Appeal  for the exercise of the"
"powers vested  in  the  Court of Appeal  by  Articles  140  or  141  of the"
"Constitution  shall  be  by  way of petition,  together with  an  affidavit in"
"support of the averments therein,  and  shall  be  accompanied  by the"
"originals of documents material  to such  application  (or duly certified  copies"
"thereof)  in  the form  of exhibits.  Where a petitioner is  unable to tender any"
"such  document,  he  shall  state the  reason  for  such  inability and  seek the"
"leave  of the Court to furnish  such  documents  later.  Where  a petitioner fails"
"to comply  with  the  provisions of this  rule  the  Court  may,  ex mere mortu or"
"at the  instance of any  party,  dismiss such  application."
