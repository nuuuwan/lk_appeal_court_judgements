"Samayawardhena, J."
"The  plaintiff  instituted  this  action  against  the  defendant  in  the"
"District  Court  of  Colombo  on  12.03.2004  seeking  a  declaration"
"that  Deed  No.  185  dated  06.02.1994  by  which  the  defendant  is"
"alleged to have got title to the land in suit is a fraudulent Deed."
"The  defendant  filed  the  answer  seeking  dismissal  of  the  plaintiff's"
"action  (instituted  more  than  ten  years  after  the  execution  of  the"
"said Deed) inter alia on the basis that the alleged cause of action of"
"the  plaintiff  on  the  face  of  the  plaint  is  prescribed  in  law  and  the"
"plaintiff  has  not  complied  with  section  44  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code."
"A few days before the case was to be taken up for trial, the plaintiff"
"moved to amend the plaint (a) to say that she came to know about"
"the  execution  of  the  alleged  fraudulent  Deed  around  December"
"2001 and then (b) to claim exemption from the law of prescription"
"in terms of section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"The plaintiff in the original plaint did state the date of execution of"
"the  Deed  but  did  not  state  when  she  came  to  know  about  the"
"execution  of 
the  same. 
  Nor  did  she  claim  exemption 
from"
"prescription  as  contemplated  in  section  44  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code."
"The application for amendment makes it abundantly clear that the"
"cause  of  action  as  it  stood  in  the  original  plaint  was  ex  facie"
"prescribed,  for  otherwise  there  was  no  reason  for  the  plaintiff  to"
"expressly  plead  exemption 
from  the 
law  of  prescription 
in  the"
"amended plaint."
