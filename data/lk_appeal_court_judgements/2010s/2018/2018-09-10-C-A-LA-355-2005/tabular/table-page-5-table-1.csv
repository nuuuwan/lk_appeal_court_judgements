"terms of section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Code return the plaint"
"for  amendment  even  without  any  application  from  the  plaintiff."
"This submission is clearly untenable in law as paragraph (i) of the"
"second  proviso  to  section  46(2)  expressly  states  that  ""When  the"
"action appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any"
"positive  rule  of  law"",  ""the  plaint  shall  be  rejected  [not  returned  for"

"the  plaintiff  from  presenting  a  fresh  plaint  in  respect  of  the  same"
"cause of action."""
"The  impugned  order  of  the  District  Judge  is  set  aside  and  the"
"appeal is allowed with costs both here and Court below."
