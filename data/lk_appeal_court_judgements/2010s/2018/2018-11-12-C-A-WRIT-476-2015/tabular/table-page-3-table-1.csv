"3"
"documents  the  Petitioner  heavily  relies  on  to  seek  the  said"
"reliefs."
"In 
the 
first  place,  when  major 
facts  are 
in  dispute,  writ,"
"especially mandamus, does not lie."
"Be that as it may, the Petitioner tendered X1  dated 04.01.2012"
"to say that he was given permission by the then Chairman of the"
"National  Transport  Commission 
to 
carry  on 
the  business."
"However,  X1 
cannot  be 
construed 
as 
a 
formal 
grant 
or"
"permission binding upon the Respondent to allow the Petitioner"
"to carry on that business in the Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal."
"It is a letter written by the Petitioner to the then Chairman of the"
"National  Transport  Commission  stating  or  suggesting  some"
"conditions to carry on the business in the Bus Terminal wherein"
"there  is  an  illegible  two  or  three  word  endorsement  (if  I  read"
"correctly, 
“Manager  Bastian  Mw”)  with 
the 
signature 
of"
"somebody."
"X3  is  denied  by  the  Respondent  inter  alia  stating  that  there  is"
"not even a reference number in the letter, suggesting that it is a"
"forged or unofficial letter."
"In any event, according to that letter  X3,  the  then Chairman of"
"the  National  Transport  Commission  has  informed  the  Subject"
"Minister that the Petitioner was given the permission to continue"
"with 
the  business  upon 
the 
instructions  given  by 
the  said"
"Minister  and  also 
the  Petitioner  was 
informed 
to  buy 
the"
"container from the container company."
"It is not clear on what basis the Minister has given instructions"
"to  the  then  Chairman  of  the  National  Transport  Commission  to"
"allow 
the  Petitioner 
to  continue 
the  business 
in 
the  Bus"
