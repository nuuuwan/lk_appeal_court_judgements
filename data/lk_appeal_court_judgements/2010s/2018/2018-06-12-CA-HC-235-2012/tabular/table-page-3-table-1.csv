"Translation  of the above stands as follows;"
"In  order to  ascertain  whether the said contradiction  affects  the  root of the  Case,"
"Court tends to  examine the Investigation  Notes of PW 4,  under Section  770(4) of"
"the Criminal Procedure Code."
"For the reason that,  from  the said Investigation Notes of PW 4,  it appears that the"
"individual is a person who took Heroin  to his residence for the purpose of making"
"packets  of  the  substance, 
I  do  not  consider 
that 
the  contradiction 
in 
the"
"testimonies  of PW  7 and PW4,  affect the root of the  Case.  (However,  I wish to"
"record that the Investigation Notes cannot be taken as evidence)."
"(Emphasis  added)"
"Considering the entire judgment, we  find that the  learned  trial judge has  perused the"
"investigation notes to clarify a point which suggested by the counsel for the appellant"
"in the original court. We do not find that the learned trial judge had used the materials"
"in  the  investigation  notes  as  evidence.  Accordingly,  we  conclude  that the  act  of the"
"trial judge is  permissible  under Section  110(4)  of CCPA  therefore we  find  no  merit in"
"this appeal."
