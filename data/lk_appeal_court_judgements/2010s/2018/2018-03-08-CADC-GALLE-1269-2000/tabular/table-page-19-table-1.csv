"As  I cited Dixon and Evatt JJ  in RusseD v.  Scott (supra),  the right at law to  the balance"
"standing at the credit of the account on the death  of one joint account holder was vested in the"
"surviving account holder Sunny de Alwis.  As  a legal right exists in him to the sum of"
"money,  what equity is  there  defeating  the  intention  that he  should  enjoy  the  legal"
"right beneficially?  Both upon principle and law I answer,  none.  Both the legal right"
"and the beneficial interest in the money  standing at the  credit of  the joint  account"
"have  vested  in Sunny  de  Alwis-the  1st  Defendant  and  thus  I  proceed  to  affirm  the"
"judgment of the learned District Judge of Galle dated 23.06.2000."
"Accordingly I would dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellants."
