"Section 544 was  amended by Acts,  No.34  of 2000,  No.20  of 2002  and No.4  of 2005."
"The pith and substance of the amendments is to facilitate the nomination of a person"
"by  a  deceased  nominator,  to  become  entitled  to  the  monies,  shares,  movables  and"
"insurance policies of the nominator upon the death of the nominator. An interesting"
"provision  is  Section  544(2)  of  the  CPC  which  declares  that  a  nomination  under"
"Section  544(1)  of  the  CPC  supersedes  the  terms  of  a  last  will  executed  by  the"
"nominator.  However,  as  for  this  joint  account  at  the  National  Savings  Bank,  the"

"holder  the  survivor/survivors  will  be  entitled  to  all  rights  of the  deceased  in  the  joint  depOSit."
"Because  of  this  condition,  money  would  belong  to  the  1st  Defendant.  Having  thus"
