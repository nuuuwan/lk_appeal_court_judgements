"persons  or  member  his 
family  for  whom  a  piece  of  land  to  the"
"extent  of 20A  had  already  been  alienated  under  MCC  in  the  year"
"it 
is 
not  possible 
to  ensure 
location,  extent  and 
1969.  Also"
"boundaries  of the  land  claimed  by  the  party  from  the  documents"
"furnished."
"3. 
LDO  permit had  been  issued  to  Mr.  Anton  Anandakumar  in"
"the  year 2003  for an  additional  piece  of land  along  A35  main  road"
"which  was  encroached  and  kept  in  possession  by  his 
late  father"
"V.Kurusamy."
"4. 
Therefore  it is  confirmed  that the  lOA  land  is  allocated  for"
"public  purpose  and  the  right  of possession  was  not  given  to  Mr."
"Kurusamy,"
"Further  it  is  confirmed  that  it  is  a  state  land  by  the  letter of the"
"Divisional Secretary dated 2005.05.18 who certify the fact."
"5. 
It was  instructed  by  the  Provincial  Land  Commissioner that"
"as  per  his 
inquiries  a  grantee  of  land  under  MCC  cannot  have"
"another  piece  of state  land  and  hence  to  grant  the  claimant  with"
"the appropriate land"""
"Thus,  when  this  Court  considers  the  contents  of  'R8a', 
it  is  clear  that"
"even  though the  Petitioners father had  been granted a permit in  respect"
"of Lot  No.  735,  no  permit has  been  granted  in  respect  of the  land  which"
"is 
the  subject  matter  of  the  Quit  Notice. 
In 
these  circumstances, 
this"
"Court  concludes 
that 
'P14' 
is  certainly  not  a  valid  permit  or  written"
"13"
