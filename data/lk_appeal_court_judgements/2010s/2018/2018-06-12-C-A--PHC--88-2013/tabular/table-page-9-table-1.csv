"produced  marked DID 6."
"Charges  contained  in  the charge sheet relevant to this case  appear to be"
"serious in  nature. As  has been  concluded  by the learned  Provincial  High"
"Court Judge,  the Appellant seems to have abused the court process to halt"
"the disciplinary proceedings against him  since the day the said  charge"
"sheet was issued  on  him.  (i.e.  2010-05-11  up until  now). The argument he"
"has put forward  is found to be a frivolous one."
