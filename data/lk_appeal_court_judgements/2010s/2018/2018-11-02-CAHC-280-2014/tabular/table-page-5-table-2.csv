"did not consider the prejudiced caused  to the Accused  (sic)."
"This  issue  was  never  taken  at the  trial  proceeding  before  the  original  court.  Further"
"the  Government  Analyst  was  never  questioned  on  this  issue.  It  was  the  first  time,  it"
"was taken  up before the Court of Appeal."
"When  the  substance  was  sent  to the Government Analyst,  it was  received  by  Mrs.  S."
"Thennakoon,  Senior  Assistant  Government Analyst  (as  then).  She  had  examined  the"
"substance and  submitted a report to the Court."
"Initially,  this  report  was  available;  subsequently  it  was  not  available  on  record.  The"
"Government  Analyst  who  examined 
the 
substance  gave  evidence  at 
the 
trial"
"proceedings  before  the  High  Court  and  testified  that  she  received 
the  parcel  with"
"seals  were  intact,  weighed  of 8.4  grams  of  brown  coloured  powder.  She  subjected"
"the said  powder for chemical analysation and found 3.32  grams of heroin. At the trial,"
"she  submitted a copy of the Report.  Missing  of the 1 st  copy in  our view, will  not cause"
"any  hindrance  to the  substantive  case.  The  analyst  herself was  before  the  Court and"
"testified  of her finding.  She  can  produce any number of originals under her signature."
"Therefore  missing  of the  pt  copy  of the  Government Analyst  Report  will  not create"
"any doubt in this case.  Accordingly, we  find that this ground of appeal also  fails  on  its"
"own  merits."
"The  last  ground  of appeal  is  that,  The  Learned  High  Court Judge  has  not considered"
"the  Judgment  of the 
the  dock  statement  when  giving  the  judgment.  We  perused"
"Learned  Trial  Judge,  at  page  287  to  290  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  had  considered  the"
"that  he 
is  denying 
the 
dock  statement  of  the  Appellant.  The  Appellant  had  said"
"charge  and  he  was 
framed  because  of  a  previous 
incident  on  which  his 
family"
"members  had  complained."
