"example,  section  174  allows  the  prosecutor  to  join  3  charges  of  the  same  kind"
"committed  within  one  year.  When  the  charge  sheets  and  lor sentencing orders are"
"not available  this  court  cannot  identify whether the  different counts  described  in  a"
"warrant  of  commitment  belong  to  the  same  subject  matter  and/or  to  the  same"
"incident or to different subject matters and/or different incidents.  For example, they"
"may belong to same kind of offences committed within one year.  Therefore, different"
"offences described  in  a given  marked warrant of commitment may not be  alternative"
"charges. 
It  seems  the  petitioner  has  not  tendered  to  this  court  the  most  relevant"
"documents  with  regard  to  the  cases  he  has  referred  to  in  his  petition,  namely  the"
"charge sheets and the sentencing orders.  The petitioner in paragraph 14 of his petition"
"states that he  is  unable to obtain the case  records.  Perhaps they may not be available"
"now due to the delay in  making this application.  He  has got the service  of a lawyer to"
"present this application. The  Petitioner  does not reveal why the lawyer could  not get"
"If he has any difficulty in getting 
copies of them from the relevant magistrates' courts."
"copies (if they are available) he  could  have prayed that the original case  records to be"
"called for perusal  by this court but there is  no such  prayer in  the petition."
"However,  a  crime  is  an  offence  against  the  state.  The  state  counsel  while  filing  his"
"written  submissions  for  the  respondents  and  at  the  conclusion  of  his  submissions"
"admits  that there  are  illegalities  caused  by  the  learned  Magistrate  in  his  sentencing"
"orders  with 
regard 
to 
the  aforesaid  convictions  and  sentences,  as 
the 
learned"
"magistrates in aforesaid cases have convicted and sentenced the petitioner for counts"
"of disposal of stolen property and/or retention of stolen property along with the count"
"of theft at one trial or in one and the same case.  This shows, even though this court is"
"not given the copies of the relevant charge sheets and the sentencing orders, the state"
"is  aware  of the fact that relevant learned  Magistrates have  convicted  and  sentenced"
"the  petitioner for alternative  offences.  The  learned  counsel  for the  Respondent  too"
"has  referred  to the cases  of Wimalasena  Vs  Inspector of Police,  Hambantota, 74  NLR"
"176, The  Queen Vs  Wijepala (1962) 68  NLR  344."
