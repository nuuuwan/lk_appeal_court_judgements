"The Respondent has  then issued  a  2nd  quit notice  on  the  Appellant"
"on  27.12.2005  after 
the  proceedings  before 
the  Magistrate's  Court  of"
"Gangodawila  was  discontinued.  He  then  filed  an  application  before  the"
"Magistrate's Court of Colombo, seeking an order of eviction on 31.01.2006."
"Thus,  it is  clear  that when  the  Respondent instituted  proceedings  before"
"the  Magistrate's 
Court 
of  Colombo, 
the 
proceedings 
before 
the"
"Magistrate's Court of Gangodawila has already been discontinued  on the"
"basis  of jurisdiction.  As  rightly  conceded  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"territorial 
Appellant, 
the  Magistrate's  Court  of  Gangodawila  had  no"
"jurisdiction to determine the application of the Respondent."
