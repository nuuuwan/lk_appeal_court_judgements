"Respondent  is  not  in  a  position  to  clearly  demarcate  the  State  land  in"
"respect of which, an eviction order is sought."
"In 
the  objections 
filed 
before 
the  Provincial  High  Court, 
the"
"Respondent provides a  reason for  the  description of the State land  in the"
"schedule to his application in that way.  According to  the Respondent, the"
"portion  of  State  land  which  is  in  illegal  possession  of  the  Appellant  lies"
"within the larger land  described  in the schedule.  In  providing the  reason"
"for  not including a  survey plan to  demarcate  the exact boundaries  of the"
"portion  of 
land  which 
is 
in 
illegal  occupation 
in 
the 
schedule, 
the"
"Respondent  claim  that  there  is  no  such  duty  imposed  on  him  by  the"
"applicable  statutory  provisions.  He  further  claims  that  such  a  course  of"
"action poses a  practical difficulty in execution even if an order of eviction"
"is  issued by the Court.  The practical difficulty poses by such a  situation is"
"described  by  the Respondent.  According  to  the  Respondent,  all  what the"
"Appellant  needs 
to  do 
in  such  a 
situation, 
is 
to  move  outside 
the"
"demarcated  portion  of  State 
land 
in 
the  application  and  continue 
to"
"possess  another  part  of  the  larger  State  land,  making  the  Respondent  to"
"engage  in never  ending cycle  of filing  applications  before  Courts  seeking"
"eviction of the Appellant in respect of each of these shifting occupations."
"In  view  of 
the  prOVIsIOns  of 
the  Act, 
these 
factors  are  clearly"
"irrelevant considerations as far as the scope of the inquiry under Section 9"
"of the said  Act,  as the statutory provisions contained in Section 9(2)  of the"
"11"
