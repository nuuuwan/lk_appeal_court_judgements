"The  Petitioner  has  produced  with 
the  petition  six  photographs  of  a"
"partially  constructed  building,  marked  as 
'P11a'  to  'P11t'.  During  the"
"course  of  the  hearing,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner,  having"
"Petitioner, 
confirmed 
that 
these 
obtained 
instructions 
from 
the"
"fact 
that  the 
photographs  had  been 
taken 
in  November  2017.  The"
"building 
containing 
the 
six 
rooms 
is 
still 
under 
construction"
"demonstrates that the  Petitioner had  not acted  upon  'P13a',  in  respect"
"of the said six rooms. The  Petitioner has also not adduced any proof that"
"he  had  attended to any of the other matters set out in  'P13a',  although"
"the  Petitioner  has  undertaken  to  do  so  by  an  undated  letter  produced"
"with the petition marked 'P13b'."
"It  has  to  be  noted  that  by  letter dated  06th  November  2015  produced"
"with  the  petition  marked  'P7b',  the  1st  Respondent  had  requested  the"
"Petitioner to repair the  roof,  which  appears  not to  have  been  complied"
"with. The  letter marked  'P13a'  served  as  a reminder with  regard  to the"
"roof  of the  four  rooms. 
It  is  further  noted  that  by  a  letter  dated  2ih"
"August 
2015 
produced  with 
the 
petition  marked 
'P7a', 
the 
1st"
"Respondent had  sought confirmation from the Petitioner on the value of"
"the 
renovations 
carried 
out, 
in 
terms  of 
the  Agreement 
'p3'.  A"
"reasonable  prudent  man  would 
think 
that  the  Petitioner  under  the"
"above  circumstances  would  have  entertained  the  thought  that  the  1st"
"Respondent  at the  expiration  of the  time  period  of the  agreement  'P3'"
"would  take  steps  to  terminate  the  agreement  and  would  not  consider"
"any extension being given to the Petitioner."
"The  Petitioner also relied on a letter dated 26th  April 2017 produced with"
"the petition marked  'P1S'  by which  he  claims that the officials of the 8th"
"7"
