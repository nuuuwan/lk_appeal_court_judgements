"However it is interesting to note that the 6th Respondent does not"
"explain 
the  most 
important  question  of  how  N.V.  Appuhamy"
"became the original owner of the land Dodamgahapelessa."
"At  the  inquiry  the  6th  Respondent  seems  to  have  produced  the"
"pedigree  accepted  by  the  District  Court  in  a  former  partition  case"
"No.  9390/P  filed  to  partition  a  totally  different  land  named  as"
"the 
Mahagederawatta  where  N.V.  Appuhamy  was  accepted  as"
"original  owner.    However  that  does  not  prove  even  remotely  that"
"the  same  N.V.  Appuhamy  who  owned  Mahagederawatta  owned"
"Dodamgahapelessa  (which  is  the  land  in  respect  of  which  Gem"
"Mining Licence was sought) as well."
"When that central question was raised at the argument before this"
"Court,  the  answer  of  learned  counsel  for  the  6th  Respondent  was"
"that 
the  said  N.V.  Appuhamy 
figures 
in 
the  pedigree  of 
the"
"Petitioners  as  well.    In  order  to  substantiate  that  position,  the"
"attention  of  the  Court  was  drawn  to  paragraph  2  of  the  plaint  of"
"the partition action  (X2) filed by the Petitioners subsequent to the"
"inquiry before the 1st Respondent Authority."
"The position of the  Petitioners at the inquiry as well as in X2 had"
"been  that  the  said  N.V.  Appuhamy  is  one  of  the  three  original"
"owners of the land and not the sole ownerâ€”vide paragraph 8 of the"
"written  submissions  of  the  Petitioners  tendered  at  the 
inquiry"
"marked X10(i) and paragraph 2 of X2.  If that position is accepted"
"by the 6th Respondent, he cannot claim rights for two-thirds of the"
"land from the heirs of N.V. Appuhamy."
"In short, both parties have tendered two different pedigrees at the"
"inquiry,  and 
I  would  hasten  to  add  that  the  Petitioners  have"
"tendered different pedigrees at different times."
