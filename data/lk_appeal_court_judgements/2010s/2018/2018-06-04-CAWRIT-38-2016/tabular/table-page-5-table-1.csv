"In  the  decision  X11  (also  marked  as  1R8)  taken  after  the  inquiry,"
"the  Chairman  of  the  1st  Respondent  Authority  candidly  admits"
"that  contradictory  positions  have  been  taken  up  by  both  parties"
"regarding 
original 
owners 
of 
the 
land 
Dodamgahapelessa."
"Nevertheless, he says that despite those contradictory positions as"
"to  original  owners, 
(a)  as 
the  Applicant  6th  Respondent  has"
"established  his  pedigree  through  the  partition  action  No.  9390/P"
"and (b) the Petitioners claim rights only for undivided one-thirds of"
"the land, the 1st Respondent Authority decides to issue the licence"
"to  the  6th  Respondent  (subject  to  the  6th  Respondent  depositing"
"one-thirds share of the ground share of the value of all gems found"
"on the land)."
"I have no hesitation to conclude that the 1st Respondent Authority"
"manifestly  erred  on  facts  when  it  came  to  the  crucial  conclusion"
"that the 6th Respondent's chain of title was proved by the pedigree"
"established in the former partition case.  The accepted pedigree of"
"the former partition case may probably prove the devolution of title"
"of  the  intestate  estate  of  N.V.  Appuhamy.    But  by  no  stretch  of"
"imagination does it prove N.V. Appuhamy was the original owner of"
"the 
land 
known 
as 
which 
is 
totally 
Dodamgahapelessa"
"unconnected to the land partitioned in the partition case, which is"
"Therefore 
the 
finding 
(a)  above 
in  X11 
is 
Mahagederawatta."
"palpably erroneous."

"Respondents  in  paragraph  12  of  the  statement  of  objections  and"
"the  corresponding  affidavit  state  that  ""in  any  event  during 
the"
"inquiry 
the  Petitioners 
failed 
to 
establish 
that 
they  had  an"
"entitlement  to  a  two  third  share  (2/3  share)  of  the  subject  land-"
