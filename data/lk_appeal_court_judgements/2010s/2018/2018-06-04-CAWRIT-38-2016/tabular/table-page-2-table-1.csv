"Samayawardhena, J."
"The Petitioners filed this application seeking to quash the decision"
"of  the  1st  Respondent  National  Gem  and  Jewellery  Authority  to"
"issue the Gem Mining Licence to the 6th Respondent in respect of"
"the  land  known  as  Dodamgahapelessa.    Pending  determination  of"
"the Petitioners' application, the validity periods of the 1st and 2nd"
"licences lapsed and the 3rd licence (X21) has now been issued."
"Before the 1st licence was issued, admittedly, a formal inquiry has"
"been  held  by  the  1st  Respondent  with  the  participation  of  the"
"Applicant  6th  Respondent  and  the  opposing  Petitioners.    It  is  not"
"the complaint of the Petitioners that the inquiry was conducted in"
"an  unreasonable  or  unlawful  manner  per  se.    Their  complaint  is"
"that  the  decision  taken  after  the  inquiry  to  issue  the  Gem Mining"
"Licence to the 6th Respondent is perverse."
"There is no dispute that National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act,"
"No.  50  of  1993  repealed  the  previous  Act,  namely,  State  Gem"
"Corporation  Act,  No.  13  of  1971,  but  section  54  of  the  new  Act"
"provided  inter  alia  that  every  rule  and  by-law  made  under  the"
"repealed  Act  and  was  in  force  on  the  day  immediately  preceding"
"the  appointed  date  and  which  are  not 
inconsistent  with 
the"
"provisions  of  new  Act  shall  be  deemed  to  be  rules  and  by-laws"
"made under the new Act."
"The  by-laws  under  the  name  of  ""State  Gem  Corporation  by-laws,"
"No. 1 of 1971"" made in terms of section 21 of the repealed Act and"
"published 
in 
the  Government  Gazette  No.  14,  989/8  dated"
"23.12.1971  (X5),  and  also  the  circular  dated  29.06.2007  issued"
"under  the  hand  of  the  Chairman  of  the  1st  Respondent  Authority"
