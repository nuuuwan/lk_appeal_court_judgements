"What  was  then  the  acceptance  of  this  offer?  By  P3  dated  3rd  February  1988 
the"
"Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff that they were accepting the offer to buy, which was"
"fixed at 20 metric tons of Aluminium. When the Defendant thus wrote to the Plaintiff"
"by P3, a contract came into being for the sale of 20 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. The"
"attention of the Plaintiff was drawn in P3 to clause 6 of the list of conditions."
"A contract, being a legally enforceable agreement thus bound the Plaintiff to a contract"
"of sale for 20 metric tons of scrap Aluminium at the rate of Rs.31,33I1 - per metric ton."
"But on 16th  February 1988  the Plaintiff made  a payment of only a sum of Rs.3,75,972/-,"
"which was the price for  a stock of 12  metric tons of scrap Aluminium.  The contract of"
"sale was entered into for 20 metric tons but the Plaintiff paid for only 12 metric tons of"
"scrap Aluminium. What was the import of this underpayment?"
"there  was  a  breach  of  contract  of  sale  for  20  metric  tons  of  scrap 
In  my  view,"
"Aluminium 
that  had  already  come 
into  existence  between 
the  Plaintiff  and 
the"
"Defendant.  A  contract  is  said  to  be  breached  when  one  party  performs  defectively,"
"differently from  the  agreement,  or  not at  all  (actual breach),  or  indicates in  advance"
"that they will not be performing as agreed (anticipatory breach)."
"Here was  a contract which mandated the Plaintiff to pay for  20  metric tons  of scrap"
"Aluminium, but he paid only for 12 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. This constitutes an"
"actual breach of the contract."
"Effect of Breach"
"When there is a breach of contract, whether it be actual or anticipatory, the contract is"
"not automatically discharged. The innocent party can usually choose whether or not to"
"terminate.  As  Viscount  Simon  stated  in  Heyman  v.  Darwins  Ltd,  (1942)  AC  356;"
