"In  other  words, 
a  breach  entitling  a  party 
to 
terminate  a  contract  does  not"
"automatically cause  the  contract  to be  terminated.  Instead,  the innocent party has  a"
"choice  (""the  right  to  elect""):  he  can  choose  to  terminate  the  contract  (""accept  the"
"renunciation or repudiation"")  and sue for  damages,  or he can affirm  the contract and"
"sue for  damages  or,  where appropriate,  debt (on the latter when a contract has been"
"kept  alive).  The  House  of  Lords 
in 
the 
'The  Simona'  (1989)  AC  788  confirmed"
"fundamental  proposition  that where  a  party's  breach justifies  the  innocent  party in"
"terminating the contract, the latter has a choice: he can accept the repudiation and thus"
"terminate the contract and sue for  damages,  or he can affirm the contract and sue for"
"damages.  Neil Andrews points  out in Article  163  of his  Contract  Rules:  Decoding English"
"Law  that there is  an exception to this  ""elective""  or non-automatic  termination in the"
"context of insurance contracts-see page 302."
"A majority of the House of Lords in  White &  Carter v.  McGregor (1962) AC 413 held"
"that the innocent party might sometimes have the capacity to keep open the contract"
"(the right to 'affirm the contract'), and complete his side of the bargain. He can then sue"
"for the agreed price. But there are later cases that have qualified this and prevented the"
"innocent  party  from  burdening 
the  other  party  with  unwanted  performance-see"
