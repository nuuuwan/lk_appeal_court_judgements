"minutes, when Susilawathie went over to her neighbour's house, she found"
"there  were  already  several  people  who  have  gathered  and  she  saw  the"
"deceased  through a  partly  open window.  The  accused- appellant elicited"
"from  this  witness and  the investigating officer  that it was he who spread"
"the  news 
to  other  villagers.  However, 
the  accused-appellant  did  not"
"accompany  Susilawathie  and  the  purpose  of  visiting  her  was  to  ask  for"
"some water."
"If one could see the deceased by the window, then there is  no need"
"for  one to  creep  through the roof to  verify  the condition of  the  deceased."
"The  accused-appellant did  not say  that he  saw  the  deceased  through the"
"window. If there were inquisitive villagers who have already  gathered at"
"the deceased's house, then the accused-appellant should have got to know"
"of  the  death  of 
the  deceased  prior 
to 
the  villagers.  This  fact 
justifies"
"drawing an inference  that it was the accused-appellant who first came to"
"know about the fate of the deceased."
"It is  also  reasonable  to  infer  that he  came  to  know  about it  before"
"7.00  a.m.  and  before  the  villagers  have  gathered  around  the  house.  The"
"timing  is  important  in  this  context.  Susilawathi  came  to  know  about  the"
"deceased through the accused-appellant and that was about 7.00 a.m.  This"
"fact is consistent with her claim that she was making string hoppers for the"
"eatery  in  her  village.  The  Consultant  JMO, 
in  his  evidence  placed  the"
"probable time of death between 6.00  p.m.  of 21st  April to  7.00  a.m.  on 
the"
"6"
