"that sections 174, 176 and  180 of the Criminal  Procedure Code  allow joinder of"
"charges  under  certain  circumstances. 
For  example,  section  174  allows  the"
"prosecutor to join 3 charges ofthe same kind committed within one year.  When"
"the charge sheets and lor sentencing orders are not available this court cannot"
"identify whether the  different  counts  described  in  a warrant  of commitment"
"belong to the same  subject matter and/or to the same  incident or to different"
"subject  matters  and/or different  incidents.  For  example,  they  may  belong  to"
"same kind of offences committed within one year.  Therefore, different offences"
"described  in  a  given  marked  warrant  of commitment  may  not  be  alternative"
"charges. 
It  seems  the  petitioner  has  not  tendered  to  this  court  the  most"
"relevant documents with regard  to the cases  he  has  referred  to in  his  petition,"
"namely 
the  charge  sheets  and 
the  sentencing  orders. 
The  petitioner 
in"
"paragraph  16 of his  petition states that he  is  unable to obtain the case  records."
"Perhaps 
they  may  not  be  available  now  due 
to  the  delay 
in  making 
this"
"application.  He  has  got the service  of a lawyer to present this application. The"
"Petitioner 
does  not reveal  why the  lawyer could  not get copies  of them from"
"the relevant magistrates' courts. 
If he  has any difficulty in getting copies (if they"
"are  available)  he  could  have  prayed  that the original  case  records  to be  called"
"for perusal by this court but there is  no such  prayer in the petition."
"However, a crime is  an  offence against the state.  The  state counsel while filing"
"his  written  submissions 
for  the 
respondents  and  at 
the  conclusion  of  his"
"submissions admits that there are illegalities caused  by the learned Magistrates"
"in 
their  sentencing  orders  with 
regard 
to 
the  aforesaid  convictions  and"
"sentences  as  the learned  magistrates in  all  aforesaid cases  have  convicted  and"
"sentenced the petitioner for theft, disposal of stolen property and/or retention"
"of stolen  property at one trial or on  one  and  the same  case.  This  shows,  even"
"though this court is  not given the copies  of the relevant charge  sheets and  the"
"sentencing  orders, 
the  state 
is  aware  of  the 
fact 
that 
relevant 
learned"
"Magistrates  have  convicted  and 
sentenced 
the  petitioner 
for  alternative"
"offences. The  learned counsel for the Respondent too has  referred to the cases"
"of Wimalasena  Vs  Inspector of Police,  Hambantota, 74  NLR  176, The  Queen Vs"
"Wijepala (1962) 68  NLR  344."
"Though this court does not have the opportunity to peruse the relevant charge"
"sheets  and  sentencing  orders,  since  the  counsel  for  respondent  representing"
"honourable  Attorney  General  has  admitted 
that 
there  are 
illegalities  as"
