"Bee Vs.  Mohamed and others14 where Sansoni  CJ  held as follows:"
"tiThe  power of revision  is  an  extraordinary power which  is  quite  independent"

"administration  of justice  and  the  correction  of errors}  sometimes  committed"
"by  this  court  itself}  in  order to  avoid  miscarriage  of justice.  It is  exercised  in"
"some  cases  by a judge of his  own motion} when  an  aggrieved  person who may"
"not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that} unless the power"
"is exercised} injustice will result. 1I"
