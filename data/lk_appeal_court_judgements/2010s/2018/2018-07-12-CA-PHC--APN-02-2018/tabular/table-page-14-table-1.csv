"The Supreme Court further held as follows:"
"""In my opinion section 4199  was not intended to afford a means of settling civil"
"disputes  in  this  manner.  I would  hold  that section  419  cannot  be  utilised  by a"
"""complainant""  in  order to obtain  an  order of possession  from  a Magistrate of"
"any article seized from the possession  of another as  being stolen property if the"
"other person  denies the theft and  claims the property as  his  own.  In  such  case"
"Section  41310  is  the only provision which  can  be  invoked, and  it can  be  invoked"
"only  if,  as  this  court  has  previously  held,  proceedings  have  been  instituted  in"
"respect of the alleged offence of theft."""
