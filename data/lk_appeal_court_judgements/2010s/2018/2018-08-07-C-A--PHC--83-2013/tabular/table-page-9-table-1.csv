"The qlJestion whether parallel proceedings could be conducted when both proceedings deal with"
"the same  charges/offences  is  also answered  in  the affirmative  by the  E-Code.  Section  27:11  of"
"the  E-Code 
requires  the  relevant  disciplinary  authority  to  hold  an 
independent  disciplinary"
"inquiry even where court proceedings for an offence which falls within the Code are in progress."
"Therefore,  it can  be  reasonably  concluded  that the  disciplinary authority can  normally inquire"
"into  the  offence 
that  is  already  before  court 
in  addition  to  other  relevant  offences.  This"
"conclusion 
is  strengthened  when  one  considers  section  27:15  of  the  E-Code.  The  section"
"envisages departmental inquiries and court proceedings being held 'with regard to a charge or a"
"series of charges' and states that the fact that the officer is acquitted in the Court proceedings"
"should 
in  no  way  affect  the  implementing  of  the  disciplinary  order  made  on  the  matters"
"revealed in the departmental disciplinary inquiry."
