"independent of the  court  proceedings  in  pro~ress and  should  only  suspend  or  postpone  the"
"inquiry for compelling reasons and unavoidable obstacles."
"The fact that both proceedings can  be done in parallel is further supported by section 27:6 of the"
"E-Code.  This  section requires the Head of Department or a staff officer to retain certified copies"
"of any  documents  that are  handed  over to relevant  authorities  for  legal  proceedings,  if those"
"documents  may become  necessary for a disciplinary inquiry against the accused  public officer."
"The retention of certified copies for the disciplinary inquiry is thus mandated because the original"
"documents will be  in the custody of courts in a parallel court proceeding."
"Further,  section 27:12  of the  E-Code  states that court proceedings  in  progress will  not inhibit a"
"disciplinary order being made at the end of the disciplinary inquiry. Section 27:13  of the E-Code"
"states that a court order being made against the public officer should not inhibit the disciplinary"
"inquiry if it  is  still  in  progress  and  that it should  be  concluded  and  an  appropriate  disciplinary"
"order made unless there are unavoidable obstacles to the continuation of the disciplinary inquiry."
