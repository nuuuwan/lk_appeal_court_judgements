"The Appellant appears to take the position that since he was acquitted of the criminal charges by"
"the Court  of Appeal, the findings of the disciplinary inquiry cannot be  sustained.  I am  unable to"
"agree with this position for several reasons."
"The  burden of proof in the two proceedings are different as the charges under the Penal Code in"
"the High Court has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt whereas the charges in the disciplinary"
"proceedings must be proved on  a balance of probability."
