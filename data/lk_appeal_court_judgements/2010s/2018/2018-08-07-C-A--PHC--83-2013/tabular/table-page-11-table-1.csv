"In Selvamani v.  Dr.  Kumaravelupillai and others [(2005) 2 SrLL.R.  99] Sisira  De Abrew J.  held:"
"""A person who is  seeking relief in an  application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is  not"
"entitled to relief as  a matter of course, as  a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even"
"if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to"
"his  conduct,  delay,  laches,  waiver submission  to jurisdiction  are  all  valid  impediments,"
"which stand against the grant of relief."""
"For the foregoing reasons,  I see  no  reason  to interfere with the judgement of the learned  High"
"Court Judge of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura dated 28.05.2013."
"The appeal is dismissed with costs."
"The  parties agreed  to be  bound  by the judgement given  in  this case  in  the  revision  application"
"bearing Case  No. CA(PHC)APN  91/2013."
"Judge of the Court of Appeal"
"K.K. Wickremasinghe J."
"I agree."
"Judge of the Court of Appeal"
