"in Warakapola.  These positions were taken rather belatedly only in the evidence in chief"
"of the Defendant  and  thus  the  testimonial  creditworthiness  of the  Defendant  suffers"
"from an inconsistency per se in that the Plaintiff was not cross~examined on the matters"
"spoken to by the Defendant nor were these matters suggested to the Plaintiff. Thus the"
"learned District Judge  was  quite  right  in believing the  Plaintiff that he made  several"
"attempts to return the money and obtain a retransfer of his property and the testimony"
"of the  Defendant  that the  Plaintiff did not do  so  does  not inspire  confidence in this"
"Court."
"So  we come  to a position where we have  a Plaintiff who made strenuous attempts to"
"return the money and have his land reconveyed within the redeemable period but the"
"Defendant has warded off these attempts."
"In  the  circumstances,  this  case  had been instituted three  months  after  13.l2.l989~the"
"date  on  which  the  5year  period  expired.  Such  a  Plaintiff  who  was  making  all  his"
"attempts  to  obtain  a  reconveyance  within  the period  of the  conditional transfer but"
"thwarted in his  attempts  is  definitely  entitled  to  have  his  land redeemed  even  if he"
"comes to court long after the period for redemption stipulated in the deed has ended."
