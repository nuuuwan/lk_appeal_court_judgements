"14. Thereafter the  iF Substituted  Defendant  has  preferred  this  appeal  to this"
"Court."
"The  Plaintiff- Respondent's  position 
is 
that  the  appellant  cannot  maintain  this"
"appeal  as  he  has  preferred  this  as  a direct appeal  against  an 
interlocutory order"
"without filing a leave to appeal application as  required  by law."
"As  per 
the  Petition  dated  06.10.1999 
filed  by 
the 
iF  Substituted  Defendant"
"Appellant in  the  District Court,  one of the prayers was  for a declaration that he  is"
"not  bound  by 
the  Judgment  and  decree  entered 
in 
the  district  court  case."
"Therefore, the application of the iF Defendant appellant in  the District Court case"
"appears  to  be  incidental  to the  purported  Judgment of that case.  Other prayers"
"were to get the proceedings in  D.C.  Case from 22.09.1994 onwards vacated and to"
"recall  the  writ of possession. 
If the  learned  District 
Judge  granted  those  reliefs,"
"the District Court would have to go on with the action, from the point of time when"
"the  death  of the  Attorney-at-law  occu rred,  to  decide  the  rights  of the  pa rties."
"Therefore, 
the  order  made  by 
the 
learned  District  Judge  on 
the  aforesaid"
"application of the  iF Defendant-Appellant is  an  interlocutory order and  it is  not a"
"Judgment as  contemplated by Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code."
"As  per  the  Section  754(5)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code, 
'Judgment'  means  any"
"Cl."
"judgment or order having the effect of final judgment made  by any civil Court and"
""""
"as  per the Section  754(2)  of the Civil  Procedure Code,  one who is  dissatisfied with"
"any other order which does not fall within the category of Judgment, can  prefer an"
"appeal only with leave of this Court first had  and  obtained."
