"In Fernando v.  Somasiri [(2012)  B.L.R.  121] the Supreme Court was confronted with an  action by"
"a permit holder under the Ordinance where  inter alia  a declaration of ownership to state  land"
"was sought and obtained in the District Court which judgment was affirmed by the Civil Appellate"
"High Court.  The Supreme Court had granted leave to appeal on three questions touching on the"
"identity of the corpus  and  set  aside  the judgements of both  the  Courts  on  the  basis  that the"
"identity of the corpus has not been proved. The Supreme Court held inter alia that both Palisena"
"v.  Perera  (supra)  and  Bandaranaike  v.  Karunawathie  (supra)  states that the title of the  permit"
"holder is  sufficient to maintain a vindicatory action  against a trespasser.  However as  explained"
"earlier neither of the cases support a declaration of ownership to state land in favour of a permit"
"holder under the Ordinance."
"In Piyasena v.  Wijesinghe and others [(2002) 2 SrLL.R.  242] J.A.N. De Silva J.  (as he was then) held"
"that by the amending Act  No.  27  of 1987 of the  Ordinance,  the interpretation of ""owner"" was"
"extended to also  cover  ""a  permit holder who has  paid  all  sums  which  he  is  required to pay ..."
"and  has  complied  with  all  the  other  conditions  specified  in  the  permit""  and  that  a  broader"
"definition  attributed  to  the  term  ""owner""  and  the  legal  entitlement  of a permit  holder to  be"
"regarded as such are salutary features of the amending Act No. 27 of 1987. However, his Lordship"
"was not giving an extended meaning to the word ""owner"" under Roman-Dutch Law but was only"
"referring to the changes  made to the definition of ""owner"" for the purposes of the Ordinance. In"
"the  instant case,  the  Plaintiffs  are  not seeking  a declaration that they are  the  ""owners""  of the"
"corpus within the meaning of the Ordinance."
