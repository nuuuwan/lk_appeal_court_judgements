"In  Premadasa  v.  Raththaranhamy [C.A.  597/97(F};  C.A.M.  18.09.2017]  we  were called  upon  to"
"consider a similar question in  relation to a permit issued  under the State  Lands  Ordinance.  We"
"took the view that a permit holder under the State  Lands  Ordinance cannot maintain an  action"
"for declaration of ownership to the state land given to him under the permit. There was no appeal"
"against the said judgement."
"Concept of Ownership"
"The Plaintiffs sought and  obtained a declaration that they are the owners of the land in dispute."
