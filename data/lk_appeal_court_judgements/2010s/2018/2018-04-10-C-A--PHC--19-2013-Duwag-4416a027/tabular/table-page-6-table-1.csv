"Western  Province  holden  in  Kalutara  urging  the  Provincial  High  Court to"
"revise the order of the  learned  Primary Court Judge."
"The  Provincial  High  Court after hearing  parties,  by  its judgment dated"
"2013-03-28  had  refused  the said  application  for  revision  and  proceeded  to"
"dismiss it.  The  Provincial  High  Court has taken  the view that there is  no"
"basis to  interfere with  the  learned  Magistrate's order."
"It is  against that judgment that the  Appellant has filed  this  appeal  in  this"
"Court."
"Perusal  of the written  submission  filed  by the Appellant shows that it is  no"
"more than  a reproduction  of the arguments advanced  on  his  behalf in  the"
"Primary  Court. They are arguments  based  on  factual  positions.  It does not"
"set out any ground,  which  is at least suggestive of any illegality or any"
"impropriety of the  impugned  order.  Therefore,  this  Court is  not inclined  to"
"re  consider them  again  one  by one."
"In the  instant case,  the Appellant does  not complain  about any irregularity"
"of proceedings."
