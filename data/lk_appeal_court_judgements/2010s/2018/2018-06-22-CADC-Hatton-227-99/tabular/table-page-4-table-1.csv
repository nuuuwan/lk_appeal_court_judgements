"produced by the pt defendant. 
If his  father  had possessed  the entire land"
"and become the owner of this land by prescription, it is all the more reason"
"why this plaintiff should have  produced this deed to establish that he  has"
"secured a co-ownership  to  this property.  This Court observes  that all  the"
"deeds 
that  were  produced  by 
the  plaintiffs  clearly  show 
that 
the  pt"
"defendant is a co-owner.  Even though his oral testimony is silent on the fact"
"of  co-ownership  he  has  not  contradicted 
the  deeds 
that  confer  co-"
"ownership on the pt defendant. 
It also appears that the 2nd  defendant who"
"is 
the  wife  of  the  pt  defendant  has  also  obtained  co-ownership  rights"
"through a deed bearing No.  2461 and dated 30.01.1984-Vide the deed marked"
"This  also  proves  co-ownership  rights  on  the  part  of 
the  2nd 
as  P  9."
"defendant.  The 2nd  defendant herself in the course of her testimony admits"
"that she and her husband co-owned this land.  When her right is only to a"
"portion of this  corpus  as  indicated by P9, 
her answer has  to be  taken  to"
"mean  that her  co-ownership  along  with her  husband is  in  respect  of  the"
"corpus along with the plaintiffs."
