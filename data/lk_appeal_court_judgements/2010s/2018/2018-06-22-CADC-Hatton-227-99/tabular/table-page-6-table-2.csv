"3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance  in  order  to  defeat  the  ownership  of  an"
"adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely"
"and fairly on him to establish a starting point for  him  or her acquisition of"
"prescriptive  rights. 
If  the  father  of  the plaintiff had passed away  in  1989"
"there is no evidence before Court that adversity on the part of the pt &: the"
"2nd defendants had continued for 10 years prior to the bringing of this action"
"that took place in 1990.  In the circumstances, this Court takes the view that"
"the pt &: 2nd defendants had not succeeded in establishing prescription at all"
"in the case.  This Court has gone  through the judgment dated 20.12.1998  of"
"the learned District Judge of Hatton and I see  no reason to interfere with"
"the evaluation of evidence and findings he has reached on the facts  that are"
"engulfed in this case. 
In  the circumstances,  this  Court proceeds  to  affirm"
"the judgment dated 20.12.1998 and dismiss the appeal."
"The  Registrar is  directed to  despatch  a copy  of this Order along with the"
"record to  the District Court of Hatton for  further steps  to  be taken in  the"
"District Court."
