"A Court may enter a judgment which may be correct or wrong but if it is wrong, until"
"the wrong judgment is challenged and corrected in the higher forum, the judgment is"
"valid however much it is  wrong.  The Plaintiff had instituted the Case No.  10l7/lon"
"27.11.1974  and the Court entered judgment on 13.06.1985.  If the Defendants state that"
"""the 1st and 2nd defendants, along with one Mohamed Aliyar Malikeen are in possession of an extent of"
"6 acres of the land called Vannichchi Vaikal from 1982"" in paragraphs 13 of their answer, this"
"clearly shows that the Defendants, whilst the case was pending in Court had taken"
"advantage of the non~cultivation of the land and entered into forcible possession. This"
"act of the Defendants is unlawful."
