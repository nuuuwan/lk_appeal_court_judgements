"issued in Case No.  10l7/L.  This is clearly stated by the Fiscal Officer Fernando in his"
"evidence."
"The two lands described in the two schedules in the earlier Case No. 10l7/L have been"
"amalgamated into one land in the present case but the extent of the land is the same."
"However,  the Plaintiff has  deliberately omitted the word ""undivided"" in describing"
"the land in the schedule to the plaint in the present case. This is to give an impression"
"that  the  plaintiff's  land is  a  divided  lot.  That is  the  position he  maintained in his"
"evidence.  But  actually  the  Plaintiff  and  the  Defendants  had been  possessing  their"
"respective lands as divided lots on the ground without proper partitioning by a decree"
"of Court or by a partition deed."
