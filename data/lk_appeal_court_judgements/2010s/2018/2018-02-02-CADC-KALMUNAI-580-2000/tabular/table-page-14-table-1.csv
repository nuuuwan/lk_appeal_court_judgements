"","right to a portion of the land in dispute, but also not objected to his two title deeds~"

"","undivided land in terms of the deeds mentioned in issue No.l?"",  and the learned District Judge"
"","has  answered the issue in the affirmative.  It is  therefore undoubtedly admitted that"
"","the Plaintiff has a right to certain portion of the land called Vannichchi Vaikal."
"","In an action for declaration of title to property, where the legal title is in the Plaintiff"

"","One  salient  statement  in  the  answer  of 
the  Defendant  must  also  be  noted. 
In"

"","their nephew Mohamed Aliyar Malikeen are in possession of an extent of 6 acres of paddy field called"
"","Vannichchi  Vaikal from  1982,  and  have been in possession of the same as  their own"".  How they"
"","came to possess these 6 acres or who was their predecessor who had possessed these"
"","6 acres has not been explained. In the light of the above, it is very important that the"
"","Defendants  must discharge  the burden of proof of their possession.  They state that"
"","they have been in possession of the land in extent 6 acres since 1982.  But the Plaintiff"
"","has filed  this action on 06.11.l985.  It clearly establishes  the fact  that the Defendants"
"","have no right to this land and their possession is unlawful."
