"Lots  2,  5,  6,  7,  8,  12,  13  and 14  in Surveyor  Ratnarajah's Plan No.  S/57.  When these 8"
"lots are  added together,  the total comes  to lOA.  OR.  6P.  This extent differs from  the"
"extent claimed by the Plaintiff."
"In his plan, Surveyor Ratnarajah says, ""14 Allotments of land called Vannichchi Vaikal bearing"
"Lot 4972 (T.P.l62250), 3973, 4974 & 4975 in P.P.1678,  Lots 87492 (T.P.201225), 87493 & 87494 in"
"P.P.2841  situated at Sorikalmunai  in Sammanthurai  Pattu"".  But the Plaintiff has  given  only"
"one Lot No. 4972 in Plan No. 1662250, and other Lots referred to by the surveyor are"
"not mentioned in the schedule to the plaint. According to the surveyor, the land called"
"Vannichichi  Vaikal  appears 
to  be  a  larger  land  of  which  the  Plaintiff  and  the"
"Defendants in the said Case No.  1017/L had claimed rights to some divided portions."
"Although 
they  cultivate  divided  portions,  but  these  are  all  undivided  lots.  The"
"Defendants in the present case and some third parties also cultivate certain portions"
"of the land Vannichchi Vaikal, but how do these persons cultivate divided portions is"
"not explained in the evidence led in the case.  Maybe on amicable understanding they"
"must have divided the lots."
