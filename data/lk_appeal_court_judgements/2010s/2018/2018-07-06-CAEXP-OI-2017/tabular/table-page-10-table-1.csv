"and Others  v.  MCM Kaleel and OtherS  expressed his  view  on the  extent of  the"
"Supreme Court's jurisdiction under Article 99(13)(a) thus:~"
"""Our jurisdiction under Article 99(13)  (a)  is not a form ofjudicial review or even of appeal, but"
"rather an original jurisdiction analogous to an action for a declaration, though it is clearly not"
"a rehearing.  Are we  concerned only with  the decision  making process or must we  look  at  the"
"decision  itself?  Article 99  (13)  (a)  requires  us  to  decide  whether  the  expulsion  was  valid  or"
"invalid. Some consideration of the merits is obViously reqUired ... The burden, if any,  must be on"
"the  respondents,  for  it  is  the  denial  of natural justice  by  them  which  has  resulted  in  these"
"proceedings. I have therefore to consider whether on the merits the respondents have shown that"
"the decision was a good one, thereby disentitling the petitioners to relief"""
