"in  a  Section  839  application,  the  nature  of relief  is  such  that  it  is  capable  of  being"
"sought in an  amended  answer.  Having pleaded for  ejectment of the  Defendant in his"
"plaint,  the  Plaintiff  secured  the  relief  extra  legally.  In  this  situation  the  Defendant"
"cannot  be  asked  to  institute  a  new  action  to  obtain  damages.  If  he  can  seek  the"
"equitable relief of inherent powers to obtain restitution,  I do  not see  any reason why"
"that  equity  cannot  follow 
law  in  the  form  of  an  amended  answer  and  give 
the"
"Defendant his relief.  Restoration of possession could be sought in a Section 839 action"
"which  is  equitable  in  nature  and  such  equitable  considerations  should  temper  and"
"pervade the agitation of the same relief by way of an  amended answer.  In the process"
"damages which ensued owing to the forcible ejectment could be sought in an amended"
"answer.  For equity follows  the law~ Aequitas sequitur legem.  This maxim is  resorted"
"to  where  the  Common  Law  such  as  a  strict  rule 
that  rights  of  parties  must  be"
"determined as  at the time of the action would appear to ignore some important factor"
"or  circumstance  which  bears  upon 
the  fairness  of  the  matter  before  Court.  The"
"important factor  that shocks the conscience of Court in this  case is  that the Plaintiff"
"used extra legal  methods  to evict  the  Defendant  whilst his  very  action for  ejectment"
"was  pending  in  Court.  The  law  in  such  a  situation  grants  an  equitable  remedy  of"
"restoration  by  way  of  Section  839  of  the  CPC~Seneviratne v.  Francis  Aheykoon"
"(supra);  Esabella  Perera  Hamine  v.  Emalia  Perera  Hamine  (supra).  This  equitable"
"consideration  must  facilitate  the  same  matter  being  raised  in  an  amended  answer."
"Therefore the fact that rights of parties must be decided as  at the time of action is not"
"an inflexible rule. It admits of exceptions such as the filing of an amended answer in the"
"circumstances I have enunciated above."
