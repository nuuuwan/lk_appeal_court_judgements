"possibly shut out this amended answer on the ground of delay.  Secondly any forcible"
"ejectment from some premises is bound to cause damages and there is  a quantification"
"of damages  in the  amended  answer.  Grave  and irremediable injustice  can  be gleaned"
"from  the  averments  of  the  amended  answer  and  I  take  the  view  that  the  learned"
"Additional  District Judge  was  in  error  when  he  rejected  the  application  to  file  the"
"amended answer without having considered relevant case law and equities in this case."
"In  the  circumstances  I  would  set  aside  the  order  of  the  learned  Additional  District"
"Judge dated 17.05.2002 that rejected the application to file  the amended answer dated"
"09.11.2001.  The same order dated 17.05.2002  as  to withdrawal of the plaint is  also  set"
"aside."
"So  in  a  nutshell,  now that  the  order  of withdrawal  of the  case  has  been  set  aside,  I"
"direct  the  learned  District  Judge  of  Kandy  to  accept  the  amended  answer  dated"
"09.11.2001  and expeditiously conclude the trial on the pleadings that are ordered to be"
"accepted."
"The case is remanded to the District Court of Kandy to proceed to trial. The appeal of"
"the Substituted~Defendant~Petitioner~Appellant is thus allowed with costs payable by"
"the Plaintiff~ Respondent~ Respondent."
