"The  h'ial  Court correctly rejected  his  statement from  the dock.  It is"
"clear  that the  claim  of falling  on  the  knife  to  commit suicide  is  almost a"
"near impossibility and is clearly an afterthought since it was not suggested"
"either  to  the  medical  officer  or  to  his  daughter.  The  daughter's  evidence"
"was that she woke him up. But the Appellant claims that his wife fell  onto"
"a knife, implying that he had witnessed the alleged act of suicide/ accident."
