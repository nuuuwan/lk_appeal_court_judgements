"the very same paddy filed which is in the possession of the"
"defendants and depicted as Lot 1 in Plan marked P4.1"
"Accordingly,  the  appellants  have  admitted  the  ownership  of  the"
"land 
in  suit  residing  with 
the  respondent  by  virtue  of 
the"
"documents  marked  P2,  P3,  P5  and  P7;  but  state  that  the  said"
"land has not been properly identified or not depicted in the Plan"
"prepared for this case marked P4."
"I must state that there was no issue raised at the trial regarding"
"identification  of  the  corpus,  and  therefore  the  said  submission"
"(made before the District Court) on that matter is irrelevant and"
"beside the point."
"Having accepted that the respondent is the owner of the land in"
"suit by virtue of the documents marked P2, P3, P5 and P7, the"
"appellants  now  before  this  Court  state  that  the  learned  District"
"Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  appellants’  Deeds  marked  1V1"
"and 1V2."
"In  the  first  place,  the  appellants  cannot  take  up  contradictory"
"positions  at various stages of the case.   They cannot approbate"
"and  reprobate,  affirm  and  disaffirm,  and  blow  hot  and  cold"
"simultaneously. (Ranasinghe v. Premadharma [1985] 1 Sri LR 63)"
"In any event,  Deed  1V1 has been executed in 1904 and  1V2 in"
"1958.  But the respondent’s said title documents are anterior to"
"the  year  1904  and 1958.    P2  is  dated 15.05.1857.    P3  is dated"
"11.12.1861. 
  P5 
is  dated  18.07.1860. 
  P7  Deed  has  been"
"executed in 1928."
"Therefore, the first argument of the appellants fails."
