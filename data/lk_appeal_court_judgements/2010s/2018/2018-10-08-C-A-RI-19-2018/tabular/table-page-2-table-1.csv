"Samayawardhena, J."
"This is a divorce action filed by the plaintiff-respondent against the"
"defendant-petitioner in the District Court of Kaduwela."
"The  petitioner  filed  this  application  before  this  Court  for  restitutio"
"in  integrum  seeking  to  set  aside:  (a)  the  ex  parte  order  made  on"

"to  hold  such  an  inquiry  is  not  this  Court,  but  the  District  Court."
"That is the settled law."

In  Andradie  v.  Jayasekera  Perera1,"
"decree entered in a divorce suit was sought to be set aside by way"
"of  an  application  for  revision  and/or  restitutio  in  integrum  on  the"
"ground 
that 
summons  was  never 
served 
on 
the  petitioner."
