"In  Dharmatilake  vs.  Brampy Singho 40  N.  L.  R.  497,  it was  held  that section  114 (d)"
"of the  Evidence  Ordinance  means  that  if an  official  act  is  proved  to  have  been  done,  it"
"will  be presumed to have been  regularly done.  It does not raise any presumption that an"
"act  was  done  of  which  there  is  no  evidence  and  the  proof  of  which 
is  essential  to  a"
"case.  It will  therefore  be  apparent that there  is  no  presumption  that an  act  likes the  act"
"of the obtaining of consent of the child in an  adoption case was done."
"Our courts  have  applied  this  presumption  in  several  contexts.  As  such  no  doubt exists"
"in  mind,  as  there  is  no  other evidence  to  controvert  that  position  of dispatch  of 
letter,"
"other than  a bear denial,  by the Petitioner of receiving  same."
