"Court  of  Appeal  first  had  and  obtained,  appeal  to  that  Court  from"
"such order"".  Hence I overrule the preliminary objection."
"The  main  ground  upon  which  the  revision  application  has  been"
"dismissed  by  the  Board  of  Quazis  in  limine  is  the  long  delay  in"
"filing the application—a delay of two years and three months from"
"the orders of the Quazi Court.  The Board of Quazis states that ""no"
"explanation 
to 
this  delay  has  been  given  by 
the  petitioner."""
"Admittedly, 
if  the  delay  can  be  explained,  that  shall  not  be  a"
"ground  for  dismissal  of  the  application  in  limine.    (Bisomenike  vs."

"According  to  P16—a  Report  from  the  Quazi  of  Colombo  South  in"
"relation to proceedings of Fasah Divorce filed by the respondent—"
"the respondent wife  is admittedly living in adultery, and the three"
"children have been left  by the respondent in Malaysia against the"
"wishes  of  the  petitioner.    The  appellant  does  not  at  least  have"
"access to the children.  It is to those four, wife and three children,"
"the Quazi has ordered the appellant to pay maintenance."
"The petitioner had been unhappy with the way the inquiry into the"
"maintenance  was  conducted  by 
the  Quazi. 
  The  maintenance"
"orders have been made on 31.01.2015."
"Soon  after  the  maintenance  orders  were  made  on  31.01.2015,"
"according  to  the 
impugned  order  of  the  Board  of  Quazis,  the"
"petitioner has complained against the Quazi alleging inter alia bias"
