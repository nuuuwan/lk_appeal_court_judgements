"date  stamp  placed  on 
the 
letter  sent  by 
the  Judicial  Service"
"Commission in April 2015 to establish that it was received by the"
"former Quazi on 09.05.2015."
"According  to  the  Magistrate's  Court  proceedings 
(P14),  the  1st"
"Journal  Entry 
is  dated  21.12.2015  and  there 
is  no 
indication"
"whatsoever that the Magistrate's Court received the Certificates of"
"Enforcement on or around 06.05.2015."
"The sheet of Journal Entries prepared separately by the Quazi does"
"not seem to me to be a contemporaneous record maintained by the"
"Quazi Court as it is done in any other Court."
"In any event, when the Judicial Service Commission has taken the"
"matter  out  of  the  former  Quazi  and  appointed  another  Quazi  in"
"April  2015  to  hear  and  determine  the  matter,  the  former  Quazi"
"cannot  deal  with  that  matter  anymore. 
  Therefore,  the 
former"
"Quazi  has  no  authority  to  send  the  Certificates  of  Enforcement  to"
"the  Magistrate's  Court  in  May  2015.    The  new  appointment  is"
"effective not from the date of the receipt of the letter but from the"
"date  of  the  letter.    The  Board  of  Quazis  has  not  considered  this"
"fundamental matter in its order."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  I  set  aside  the  order  of  the  Board  of"
"Quazis dated 13.05.2017 and the order of the former Quazi dated"
"31.01.2015  and  direct  the  new  Quazi  appointed  by  the  Judicial"
"Service  Commission  by  the  letter  in  April  2015  to  hold  a  fresh"
"inquiry  into  the  maintenance  applications  filed  by  the  respondent"
"and  make  a  suitable  order  according  to  law.    The  Certificates  of"
"Enforcement sent to the Magistrate's Court shall be recalled."
"Appeal allowed.  No costs."
