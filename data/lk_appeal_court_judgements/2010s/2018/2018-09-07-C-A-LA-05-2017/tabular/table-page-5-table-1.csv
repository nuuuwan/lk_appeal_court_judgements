"Commission on 10.02.2015.  The Secretary to the Board of Quazis"
"by  letter  dated  16.02.2015  has  informed  the  petitioner  to  make  a"
"formal complaint following the proper procedure, and the Secretary"
"to  the  Judicial  Service  Commission  by  an  undated  letter  in  April"
"2015  (P6)  has  appointed  Quazi  in  Colombo  North  to  hear  and"
"determine  these  maintenance  applications. 
  When  the  Judicial"
"Service  Commission  appoints  a  new  Quazi  in  April  2015  to  hear"
"and  determine  the  maintenance  applications,  the  appellant  had"
"been  satisfied  that  his  grievances  would  be  addressed  by  the  new"
"Quazi."
"However 
the  appellant  has  been  arrested  by 
the  police  and"
"produced before the Magistrate's Court on 27.03.2017 upon failure"
"to  pay  maintenance 
in  terms  of  the  order  of  the  Quazi  dated"
"31.01.2015.    It  is  thereafter,  the  petitioner  has  filed  the  revision"
"application  before  the  Board  of  Quazis.    It  is  my  considered  view"
"that the delay is explainable and therefore it should not have been"
"a  ground  for  refusal  of  the  application.    The  Board  of  Quazis  has"
"gone wrong on that point."
"The Magistrate's Court proceedings have commenced upon receipt"
"of  the  Certificates  of  Enforcement  sent  by  the  Quazi  Court.    It  is"
"the  position  of  counsel  for  the  respondent  that  the  letter  of  the"
"Judicial  Service  Commission 
in  April  2015  appointing  another"
"Quazi  was  received  by  the  Quazi  who  made  the  maintenance"
"orders  on  09.05.2015  and  the  Certificates  of  Enforcement  were"
"sent to the Magistrate's Court on 06.05.2015."
"When an official letter is received by any Court or any institution,"
"it  is  the  practice  to  place  the  date  stamp  on  the  said  letter  to"
"signify  the  date  of  receipt  of  that  letter.    However  I  find  no  such"
