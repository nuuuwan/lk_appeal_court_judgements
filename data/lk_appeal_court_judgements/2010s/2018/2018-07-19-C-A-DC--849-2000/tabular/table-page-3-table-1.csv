"the instance of the wife outside Chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). In fact,"
"the Counsel for  the Defendant mounted an argument that it is  Section 615  of the CPC"
"which provides for settlement of property, upon divorce, or judicial separation and apart"
"from this remedy, there cannot be an independent cause of action available to the wife."
"If at all  she  has  to obtain her  remedies  in  the  matrimonial action.  This  was  the first"
"argument of Mr. Lasith Chaminda, Counsel for the Defendant~husband. But the learned"
"Additional District Judge of Colombo in her judgment dated 27.09.2000  answered Issue"
"No.  41  in favour  of the  Plaintiff~wife and declared the right of the  Plaintiff to sue her"
"husband on the basis of causes of action of trust and declaration of title. The reasoning"

"of the learned Additiona1  District Judge of Colombo  is found at page 6 of the judgment"
"dated 27.09.2000 wherein she states that the standing of a married woman to sue must"
"be protected since she is -t feme sole. The judgment further states that the Defendant was"
"not able to show any legal basis to the contrary."
"In this appeal against t~e aforesaid decision of the District Court, the learned Counsel"
"for the Defendant~ Appell(lnt also put forward an alternative argument. For the first time"
"in appeal, the Counsel raj,:;ed the argument that if at all a substantive right exists for the"
"wife  to  sue  the  husband  during  the  pendency  of  an  existing  marriage,  that right is"
"qualified by Section 23(1)  of the Married Women's Property Ordinance No.  18  of 1923"
"which prescribes a summary procedure to be adopted in the case of a suit. Here the wife"
"did not adopt that procedure. She sought her remedies of trust and declaration of title by"
"way of regular procedure  Of course this was not an argument taken before the learned"
"Additional District Judge but before this Court and if iLall this argument were to succeed"
"here, it must be based on the usual gravamen that the District Court suffered from what"
"Spencer Bower in the 1st edition of his book titled the Law Relating to Estoppel (1923)"
"called a defectus  jurisdictioms, which was described by Tennekoon, C.J in Beatrice Perera"
