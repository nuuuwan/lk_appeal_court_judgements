"","T his  appeal raises  the question whether a married woman enjoys  the substantive"
"","In other words, the question before this Court is whether, whilst the marriage between"
"","the  parties  subsists,  the' wife  will  have  the  substantive  right  to  sue  the  husband for"
"restitution of property w\ich she alleges to be in his possession.",""
"","This  was  a  case  where  the  wife  (the  Plaintiff/Respondent  who  will  be  hereinafter"
"","sometimes  called  ""the  Plaintiff"")  instituted  this  actiol)  for  restitution  of  moneys  and"
"property  held 
in 
trust  by","the  husband 
(the  Defendant/Appellant  or  hereinafter"
"","sometimes called ""the Defendant"") and for recovery of the jewellery of the Plaintiff that"
"","was in the matrimonial home and wrongfully held by the Defendant. The learned District"
"Judge of Colombo has held with the Plaintiff affirmatively stating that the wife, during the",""
"","existence of the marriage'~ does possess the right to sue the husband for recovery of her"
"movable and immovable property.",""
"","Whether she can institute such an action against the husband for restitution of property,"
"","whilst conjugal rights are:  still in existence, was raised as Issue No.  41, which has been"
"","answered in the affirmative by the learned District Judge of Colombo.  When this appeal"
"","came on for argument, the learned Counsel for the Defendant/husband stated before this"
"","Court that he would confine the appeal to only one Ql1estion and that question alone/"
"","namely, the existence of a proprietary right in the wife to sue her spouse for restitution"
"of property during the subsistence of marriage.",""
"","At the very outset, I must state that the Plaintiff sought a declaration of trust in respect"
"","of four items of property and as regards the fifth item, it was a vindication of a right to"
"","movable property. No divorce, or judicial separation had been sought as a remedy in the"
"plaint.  In  other  words,","this  was  no  matrimonial  action  but  the  plaint  contained"
"","independent causes of action rooted in trust and declat~tion of title pleaded in regard to"
"","moveable  property.  So  the  obvious  defence  was  taken  in  the  answer.  A forfeiture  of"
"","property cannot be granted except upon in a matrimonial action which should pray for"
"","a divorce or a judicial separation. No suit for recovery of property will otherwise lie at"
