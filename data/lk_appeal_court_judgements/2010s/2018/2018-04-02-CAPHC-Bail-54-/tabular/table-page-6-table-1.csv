"above act will be admitted to  bail only in terms of section83(J) of the said act and"
"it is only on exceptional circumstances ""."
"Therefore considering the rationale observed by our superior courts, in granting"
"bail to an accused sentenced for 8 years for the wrongdoing, it is clear, that the"
"learned High court Judge was correct in refusing to enlarge the accused on bail."
"Considering above this court is  of the view that the circumstances mentioned by"
"the learned counsel for the petitioner do not constitute exceptional circumstances to"
"urge this court to allow the revision application."
"Hence, this court sees no reason to  interfere with the findings of the Learned High"
"Court Judge and thereby the revision application is  dismissed without costs."
