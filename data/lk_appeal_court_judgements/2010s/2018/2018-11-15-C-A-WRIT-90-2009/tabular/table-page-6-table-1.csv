"a)","The  assessments 
'p4'  and 
'PS' 
are 
totally  without 
jurisdiction  and"
"","unsupported by evidence;"
"b)","No reasons have been furnished for the issuing of the assessment;"
"c)","In  any  event,  the  quantum of rates  is  manifestly excessive  in  view of the"
"","locality of the land and  in view of the fact that no services are rendered by"
"","the 1st  Respondent;"
"d)","The assessment offends the principles of proportionality."
