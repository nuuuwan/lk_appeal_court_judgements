"for the prosecution in the said appeal is a ""formidable"" one in considering"
"the totality of evidence and decided to act on the proviso."
"Since 
the  applicability  of 
the  proviso 
to  Section  334(1) 
requires"
"consideration of the evidence in its totality, it is proposed to deal with the"

"Learned Deputy Solicitor General sought to counter this submission"
"on  the  basis  that witness  Navaratne knew  the accused-appellant prior  to"

"it has caused no prejudice."
