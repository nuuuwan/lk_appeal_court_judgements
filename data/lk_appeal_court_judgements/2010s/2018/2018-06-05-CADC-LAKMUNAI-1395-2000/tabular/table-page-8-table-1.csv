"hear and determine becomes  crystallized in the issues  and the pleadings  recede to the"
"background""~PerG.P.S. De Silva C.J. in Hanaffi v.  Nallamma (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 73."
"This is  a rei vindicatio  action,  in which the trite principle followed by court is when the"
"Plaintiff has paper title and the Defendant is in possession, the burden is on the Plaintiff"
"to prove his title. Only when this burden is satisfactorily discharged, the onus of proving"
"prescriptive  possession  devolves  on  the  Defendant~see the  PC  decision  of  Siyaneris  v."
