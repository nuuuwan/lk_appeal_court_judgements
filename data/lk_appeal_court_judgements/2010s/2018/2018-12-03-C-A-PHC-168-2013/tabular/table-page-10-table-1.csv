"Thus, the core of the learned judge's reasoning in Veloo (supra) was that the revisionary powers"
"of the Court of Appeal 'flowed' or originated from a Constitutional article i.e. Article 138. Since"
"Article  138  was  'subject  to the  provisions  of the  Constitution  or  of  any  law'  the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction  could  be  restricted  by  another  part  of  the  Constitution  or  ordinary  legislation."
"(Weragama v Eksath Lanka Wathu Kamkaru Samithiya [(1994) 1 Sri.  L.  R.  293]."
"In  the  absence  of such  restrictions,  the  Court  of Appeal  could  exercise  the  full  scope3  of its"
"revisionary jurisdiction under Article 138. The  aforementioned judgment militates against the"
"view that there exists a general  power of revision  in  a court that is  not referable to either the"
"Constitution  or  law.  Accordingly,  in  as  much  as  the  Court  of Appeal's  revisionary jurisdiction"
