"This  is  a reflection  of the well-known  principle that inherent powers of courts  are  adjuncts to"
"existing jurisdiction that are there to remedy injustice but cannot be  made the source of new"
"jurisdictions  [Ganeshananthan  v.  Goonewardena (1984)  1 Sri.  L.  R.  321]."
"Accordingly,  I am  of the opinion that neither the Constitution, law nor the inherent powers of"
"the Provincial  High  Court afford a basis  for either the Appellant's order under section  90(1) of"
"the  Agrarian  Development  Act  or  his  purported  failure  to  refer  the  matter  to  an  Agrarian"
"Tribunal  in  terms of section  7(3)  therein to be  challenged  by way of revision.  Accordingly,  the"
"learned  High  Court judge  was  not entitled  to entertain  the  revision  application  and  ought to"
"have dismissed it in limine."
"For the foregoing  reasons,  I allow the appeal  and  set  aside  the judgment of the  learned  High"
"Court Judge  of the Western  Province  holden  in  Kaluthara  dated 09.10.2013.  I also  dismiss the"
"revision  application  dated 19.11.2010 filed  by the Defendant in the High  Court of the Western"
"Province."
"Appeal allowed with costs payable by the Defendant to the Appellant and  Plaintiff."
