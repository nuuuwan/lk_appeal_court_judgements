"The  Appellant filed  his  statement  of objections  and  took  up  a preliminary objection  that the"
"application should be  dismissed in limine as the High Court did not have revisionary jurisdiction"
"to nullify the order made under section 90(1) of the Agrarian  Development Act."
"The  learned  High  Court Judge  by  order dated 09.10.2013  overruled the  preliminary objection"
"taken  by the Appellant and  nullified the Appellant's order dated  27.10.2010 by exercising the"
"court's inherent powers."
"Being  aggrieved  by the  said  order,  the  Appellant  has  filed  the  present  appeal  seeking  to set"
"aside  the  order of the  learned  High  Court judge.  The  Appellant contends  that the  High  Court"
"laboured  under  a  patent  lack  of jurisdiction  and  did  not  have  the  capacity  to  entertain  the"
"revision  application."
"Is  the Provincial  High  Court vested with revisionary jurisdiction to review the instant matter"
"in terms of the Constitution or law?"
"The  scope of a Provincial  High  Court's revisionary jurisdiction is set out in  the Constitution, the"
"High  Court  of the  Provinces  (Special  Provisions)  Act  No  19  of 1990 and  the  High  Court  of the"
"Provinces  (Special  Provisions)  (Amendment)  Act,  No.  54  of 2006.  The  relevant  provisions  are"
"reproduced below."
