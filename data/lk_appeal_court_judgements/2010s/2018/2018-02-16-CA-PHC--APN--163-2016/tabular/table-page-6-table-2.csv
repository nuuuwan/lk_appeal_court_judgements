"In Ameen Vs Rasheed (6 CLW 8), Abrahams CJ observed;"
"""It has been represented to  us  on the part of the petitioner that even if we find the"
"~~ urder to  be appealable,  we still have discretion to act in revision.  It has been said"
"in this court often enough that revision of an appealable order is an exceptional"
"proceeding,  and in the petition no  reason is given why this method of rectification"
"has been sought rather than the ordinary method of appeal.  I can see no reason"
"why the petitioner should expect us  to exercise our revisional powers in his favor"
"when he might have appealed,  and I would allow the preliminary objection and"
"dismiss the application without costs""."
