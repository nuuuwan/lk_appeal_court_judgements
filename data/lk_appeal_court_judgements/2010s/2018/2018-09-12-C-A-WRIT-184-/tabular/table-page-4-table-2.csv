"Buddakoralage  Devika  Priyangani  had become  the  owner  of the  said  premises"
"and  the  records  of  the  valuation  department  of  the  Council  declare  the  said"
"Buddakoralage Devika Priyangani as the owner."
"In support of these claims the Respondent Mayor has marked and produced copies of"
"the said Deed of Transfer and the assessment record as RI and R2."
"As  regards  the claim of the  Petitioner that the  assessment  register becomes  a public"
"document in view of the Municipal Councils Ordinance the Respondent contends that"
"in terms of Section 235 (1) of Municipal Councils Ordinance the Municipal Council has"
"to maintain an assessment book and according to Section 235  (2) the statutory scheme"
"provides  a right of inspection only to two categories  of person namely an owner or an"
"occupier.  It is further argued that even if the Petitioner is the owner of the premises she"
"can  only  inspect  the  assessment  book  but there  is  no  right  to  obtain  a  copy  of the"
"assessment book."
