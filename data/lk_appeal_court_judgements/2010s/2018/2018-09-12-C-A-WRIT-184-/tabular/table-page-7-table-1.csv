"of the Petitioner is nowhere to be found in their records as  the owner of the premises."
"As I said before, this position of the Mayor remains uncontroverted by the Petitioner. It"
"is my view that if the Municipal Council does not possess this fact of ownership of the"
"Petitioner, it is  the bounden duty of the Petitioner to bring it to  the attention of the"
"Municipal Council and have the records regularized by furnishing her name as the new"
"owner.  It is a salient fact that the Respondent Mayor has produced before this Court a"
"copy  of  the  Deed  of Transfer  bearing  No.6993  in  favor  of Devika  Priyangani  and  he"
"couldn't  have  done  so  unless  this  copy  of  the  deed  had  been  handed  over  to  the"

"books of the Council as  the current owner,  appears to be explicable on the basis that"
"the change  of ownership has  not been notified  to  the Council post execution of the"
"Deed  of  Transfer  bearing  No.644  in  2013.  That  explains  as  to  why  the  Respondent"
