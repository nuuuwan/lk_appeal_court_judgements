"So it behoves the Petitioner to make out to the Municipal Council that he is the owner or"
"occupier  in  the  first  instance.  If there  is  a  particular  manner  and form  in  which  this"
"information has to be furnished to the Council such as a prescribed form, the Petitioner"
"must proceed to do so and have her name entered as the owner before he claims a right"
"under the provisions of the Municipal Council Ordinance to inspect relevant registers"
"maintained  at  the  Council.  Without  having  indisputably  established  her  ownership"
"before the Council,  the Petitioner cannot put forward title deeds before this Court to"
"make a finding of ownership which task is beyond the pale of competence of this Court"
