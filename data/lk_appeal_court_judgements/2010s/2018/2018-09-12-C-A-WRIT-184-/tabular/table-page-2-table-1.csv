"A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J."
"The Petitioner in this case seeks a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus on"
"Municipal Council of Kaduwela  in respect  of premises bearing assessment  No.388/4,"
"Kaduwela  Road,  Malabe for  the period ranging from  the date of the 1st  assessment to"
"the year 2014."
"The Petitioner asserts that both by a Deed of Transfer bearing No.  644 dated 19.01.2013"
"and 28.01.2013 as well as by prescriptive possession she has become the lawful owner of"
"the  premises  referred  to  above,  which  is  a  residential  premises  situated  within  the"
"administrative limits of the Municipal Council of Kaduwela."
"By way of a letter dated 21.03.2014  the Petitioner had made an application through her"
"Attorney~at~Law to the Municipal Commissioner of Municipal Council of Kaduwela to"
"obtain certified extracts from  the assessment register pertaining to the premises but"
"this request appears to have proved futile as an officer who is designated in the petition"
"as  one  Mrs.  U.G.  Anula  of  the  Municipal  Council  of  Kaduwela  is  alleged  to  have"
"informed the Petitioner that the certified extracts from  the assessment register would"
"not be made available."
"The Petitioner further avers  that she attempted again to obtain copies of the relevant"
"extracts  by  way  of  another  written request  on  24.04.20l4  but this  request  too  was"
"turned  down  allegedly  by  an  employee  of  the  Municipal  Council  who  had  been"
"manning a counter at the said Council. The Petitioner followed this up by dispatching"
"via registered post a copy of this demand addressed to the Municipal Commissioner of"
"the Municipal Council of Kaduwela and copies of the demand and postal article have"
"been appended to the petition as X3 and X4 respectively."
"The thrust of this application for  a writ of mandamus as  asserted by the Petitioner is"
"traceable to Section 235  (1)  and (2) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance No.2 of 1947"
"as amended."
