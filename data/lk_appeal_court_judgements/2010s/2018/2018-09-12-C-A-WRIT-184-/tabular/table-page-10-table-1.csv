"So  it is my view that the Petitioner has not made out a right which inheres in him to"
"demand a duty of the Municipal Council."
"So 
this  Court  has  to  dismiss  this  application  which  is  quite  misconceived  in  the"
"absence of a right inherent to the Petitioner."
"This Court is now left with the alternative argument of the Petitioner based on Section"
"74 of the Evidence Ordinance that sets out an exhaustive list of what would be public"
"documents in the country."
"I have  held that the assessment book in which the annual value of a house,  building,"
"land or  tenement shall be entered is  not a public document in view of the deliberate"
"intention of the legislature to keep it out of public domain and though public notice of"
"where it could be inspected has to be given by the Council, the inspection itself is not"
"open to all and sundry but only to the owner or occupier of the said habitat."
"On  the  basis  of  my  above  holding  it  is  my  view  that  Section  74  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance cannot invest the assessment book with the character of a public document."
"In the circumstances this application for judicial review is refused."
