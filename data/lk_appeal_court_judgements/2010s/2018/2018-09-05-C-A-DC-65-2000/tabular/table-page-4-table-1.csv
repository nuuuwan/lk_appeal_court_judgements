"â€¢","As  I said before,  it is  the  2nd  transaction~the deed  of  revocation that was  impugned"
"","before this Court. Laconically put, the argument was that Pina was not established by"
"","evidence to be a person subject to Kandyan law and therefore he could not have validly"
"","revoked the deed of gift in favour of the Defendant. Upon a careful consideration of the"
"","totality of evidence in the case  I find  that the Defendant had confirmed in his  cross~"
"","examination  that  PI  (the  deed  of  revocation)  contained  his  father'S  signature.  The"
"","attesting witnesses to the deed also gave evidence and attested to the fact that it was"
"","Pina (the father) who signed the deed of revocation and the deed of transfer in the same"
"","breath. Thus the Defendant himself disproved his allegation in his issues that the deeds"
"","of revocation  and transfer were fraudulent,  leave  alone  the evidence of the witnesses"
"","who established the due execution of the deeds."
"","Thus the only mode of attack by the Defendant~Appellant in this appeal was based on"
"","the personal law of Pina.  The argument was mounted before this Court that Pina was"
"","not a person subject to Kandyan law and therefore he would not enjoy the power of a"
"","unilateral  revocation  of  the  deed  of  donation  which  he  had  made  in  favour  of  the"
"","Defendant."
"","The liberality of revocation of deeds  of donation that prevails in Kandyan law has an"
"","interesting  genesis  and  I  think it appropriate  to  set  it  down  here  though  the  issue"
"","before  me 
is  whether  the  Plaintiffs  proved  on  evidence  that  Pina  was  subject  to"
"","Kandyan law.  Before  I come  to that dispositive issue in the case,  let me  allude to the"
"","right of a donor to revoke his deed of gift in Kandyan law."
