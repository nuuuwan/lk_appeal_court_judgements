"In the case  of K Mary Matilda Silva  V P H De Silva,  Inspector of Police,"
"Police Station,  Habarana 1
,  which  is a case  under the Animals Act,  this Court"
"took the view that in  this type of a situation, giving mere instructions is  not"
"sufficient to discharge the burden cast on  the owner of a vehicle.  This"
"Court went on  to hold  in  the said  case that the owner of the vehicle must"
"not only prove that genuine instructions were  in  fact given, but also took"
"every endeavor to implement the instructions so  given.  This Court in  that"
"case  had  held that the failure to prove the above requirements would"
"indicate that indeed  no  genuine  instructions had  been  given."
