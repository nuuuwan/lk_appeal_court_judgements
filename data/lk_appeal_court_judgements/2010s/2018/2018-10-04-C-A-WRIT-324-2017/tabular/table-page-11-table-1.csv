"Being  dissatisfied with the appointment of the 23 rd  Respondent as  the Head  of"
"the  Department,  the  Petitioner  invoked  the  jurisdiction  of this  Court  seeking"
"the aforementioned relief."
"The  grounds urged on  behalf of the Petitioner before this Court are three fold."
"The  Petitioner's first  ground  is  that the  Board  of Management  ought to  have"
"afforded the Petitioner a hearing prior to rejecting his re-appointment as  Head,"
"that  no 
reasons  have  been  given 
for  the  said 
Department  of  Unani  and"
"rejection."
"Provision with regard to the appointment (and  re-appointment) of the Head  of"
"Department  is  found  at  paragraph  14(1)  of the  Ordinance  'P10'  and  reads  as"
"follows:"
"""Each  Department of study shall  have a Head  of Department, who shall  be"
"a  full-time  officer  of the  Institute  and  the  administrative  and  academic"
"from 
head  of  that  Department.  He  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Board"
"among  the  teachers  of that  Department  upon  the  recommendation  of"
"the Director."" [emphasis added]"
"It is  clear from the above provision that the appointment must be  made by the"
"Board  of  Management  on  a 
recommendation  by 
the  Director.  However,"
"according  to  'pg',  the  Petitioner  has  been 
re-appointed  as  Head  by 
the  1st"
"Respondent  Director,  subject  to  the  approval  of the  Board  of  Management."
"Thus, 
it  is  clear  that  the  1st  Respondent  has  exceeded  her  powers  when  she"
"issued  the  letter of appointment marked  'pg'. Therefore the said  appointment"
"made  by  'pg'  is  void  ab  initio.  In  these  circumstances,  this  Court  is  of the view"
"11"
