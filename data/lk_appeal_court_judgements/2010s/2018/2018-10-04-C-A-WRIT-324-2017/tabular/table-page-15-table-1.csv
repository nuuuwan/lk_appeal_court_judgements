"the  second  and  third  grounds  urged  by  the  Petitioner  are  without  merit  and"
"that the  Petitioner is  not entitled to a Writ of Certiorari  to quash  the election"
"and  the subsequent appointment of the 23 rd  Respondent."
"is  one  other  matter  that 
this  Court  would 
like 
to  advert 
to.  The 
There"
"Petitioner  has  annexed  with  the  petition  material  relating  to the  selection  of"
"h July 
the Head  of Department in the past. According to a Board  paper dated 1 i"
"'P21', 
it  was 
the  Unani  Academic  Staff  Committee 
that  had 
2009  marked"
"unanimously  decided 
to  propose 
to  the  Director  the  appointment  of  Mrs."
"M.S.S.  Fawmiya  as 
the  Head,  Department  of  Unani.  After  Mrs.  Fawmiya"
"refused 
to  accept 
the  appointment, 
the  Unani  Academic  Staff  had  been"
"summoned for a meeting on  13th  August  2009  by the then  Director 'to get the"
"decision  (of the  staff)  for appointing  a  new  person  as  the  Head  of the  Unani"
"section.'  The  minutes  of the  said  meeting  has  been  annexed  to  the  petition"
"marked  'P19'.  This  Court  has  examined  'P19'  and  finds  that the  proposal  that"
"the academic staff nominate a suitable candidate from among themselves  had"
"come from the Petitioner himself. Thus, the 1st  Respondent consulting the staff"
"members  of  the  Unani  Department 
in  2018 
is  not  a  new  phenomena  but"
"something 
that  has  happened  even 
in  2009  with 
the 
full  knowledge  and"
"participation of the Petitioner."
"In  view  of the  decision  of this  Court  that the  Petitioner  is  not entitled  to  the"
"Writs of Certiorari prayed  for, the necessity to consider the Writ of Mandamus"
"to  say 
that  the  Petitioner  has  no 
legal 
right  to  be 
does  not  arise,  suffice"
"appointed  as  the  Head  of Department and  therefore,  would  not be  entitled to"
"a Writ of Mandamus in  any event."
