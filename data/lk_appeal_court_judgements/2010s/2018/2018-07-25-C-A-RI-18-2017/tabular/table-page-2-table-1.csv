"Samayawardhena, J."
"This 
is  a  peculiar  application 
filed  by  the  defendant-petitioner"
"against  the  plaintiff-respondent  for  restitutio  in  integrum  for  the"
"limited 
purpose 
of 
restoring 
her  marital 
status 
pending"
"determination  of 
the  District  Court  ongoing 
inquiry 
into  her"
"application  for  setting  aside  the  ex  parte  divorce  judgment  which"
"she  alleges  to  have  been  obtained  by  the  respondent  by  fraud"
"without serving summons on her."
"In the first place, if the petitioner thinks that she is entitled to seek"
"such 
interim  relief  pending 
inquiry,  she  must 
first  make 
the"
"application before the Court where the inquiry is pending and not"
"before  this  Court. 
  Even  though  the  petitioner 
in  her  written"
"submissions drawing attention to proceedings of the District Court"
"dated 28.10.2015 states that the District Court refused to suspend"
"the  decree  absolute  pending  inquiry,  I  find  no  such  order  being"
"made in those proceedings."
"On that ground alone, this application shall be dismissed."
"However, for curiosity, let me consider, in brief, why the petitioner"
"makes  this  unusual  application.    At  paragraph  4.1  of  the  written"
"submissions she gives three reasons.  The first one is her inability"
"to  claim  maintenance  from  the  respondent.   I  do  not  see  any  dire"
"need for her to claim maintenance in a  desperate  great hurry, as,"
"according  to  her  own  evidence,  she  is  employed  (and  a  graduate)."
"The  second  one  is  in  the  event  of  the  respondent's  death  pending"
"inquiry her inability to claim rights of inheritance as the wife of the"
"respondent. This is highly hypothetical, and in case the respondent"
"dies  pending 
inquiry  her  application  to  set  aside  the  ex  parte"
"judgement  will  not  die.    The  third  one  is  the  likelihood  of  the"
