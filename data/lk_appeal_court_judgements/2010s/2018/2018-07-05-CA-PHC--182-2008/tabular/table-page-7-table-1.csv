"quashed  each  of the  persons  constituting  such  body  who  took  part  in  taking  the  impugned"
"decision or the exercise of power should be  made respondent. The failure to make  him or them"
"respondents  to the  application  is  fatal  and  provides  in  itself a ground  for the  dismissal  of the"

interdiction.  The  2nd  Respondent  is  only  the"
"Secretary  to  the  Sabaragamuwa  Provincial  Public  Service  Commission  by  nominee  officii.  The"
