"T
he  Defendant-Respondent  in  his  answer  dated  25.09.1990  (page  62  of"
"the appeal brief), stated that the said premises was initially given to him by"
"S.  L.  M.  Hassen  and  he  paid  rent  to  the  said  S.  L.  M.  Hassen  up  to"
"31.12.1985."
"At  commencement  of 
the 
trial, 
the  original  Plaintiff-Appellant  raised  7"
"issues and Attorney for the Defendant-Respondent objected to issue Nos."
"2,3  and  4  but 
the 
learned  Trial  Judge  by  his  order, 
refused 
those"
"objections raised by the Counsel for the Defendant-Respondent (vide page"
"73-78  of 
the  appeal  brief).  Thereafter  on  18.07.1991 
the  Substituted"
"Defendant-Respondent  raised  4  issues  in  support  of  his  contention  (vide"
"page 83 and 84 of the appeal brief)."
"After  trial,  the  learned  District  Judge  dismissed  the  Plaintiffâ€™s  action  with"
"costs.  Being  aggrieved  by 
the  said 
judgment, 
the  Plaintiff-Appellant"
"preferred this appeal to set aside the judgment and grant  relief according"
"to his Plaint."
"In the District Court, the learned District Judge has held that after demise"
"of  the  original  owner  of  the  premises  which  described  in  the  schedule  to"
"the  Plaint,  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  had  become  the  owner  of  it.  Therefore,"
"the Plaintiff-Appellant informed the Defendant-Respondent to attorn to him"
"from  01.07.1986.  Thus,  the  learned  District  Judge  correctly  held  that  the"
"contract  of  tenancy  (and  the  attornment)  between  the  Appellant  and  the"
"Respondent  commenced 
from 
that  date 
(01.07.1986).  Therefore, 
the"
"cause of action based on arrears of rent from April, 1984, could not stand."
"Further,  the  authorized  rent  for  the  premises  was  Rs.67.08  per  month,"
"which  was 
subsequently 
increased 
to  Rs.192.89. 
The  Defendant-"
"Respondent  had  deposited  a  sum  of  Rs.2158.21 
from  July  1986 
till"
"institution of the action with the authorized officer of the Municipal Council,"
"since  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  refused  to  accept  that  sum  by  way  of  rent."
