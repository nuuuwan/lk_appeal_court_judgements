"""Where  a  party  invokes  the  provisions  of Section  3  of the  Prescription"
"Ordinance 
in  order  to  defeat  the  ownership  of an  adverse  claimant  to"
"immovable  property, 
the  burden  of proof rests  fairly  and squarely on  him"
"to  establish  a  starting point for his or her acquisition  of prescriptive rights."
"If that  onus  has  prima  facie  been  discharged, 
the  burden  shifts  to 
the"
"opposite party to  establish that,  by reason of some disability recognized by"
"from 
the  date  on  which  the 
Section  13,  prescription  did  not  in  fact  run"
"adverse  possession  first  commenced.  Once  that  has  been  established,"
"the  onus shifts once again to  the  other side  to  show that the  disability had"
"ceased on  some subsequent date  and that the  adverse possession relied"
"on had uninterruptedly continued thereafter for a period of ten years. """
