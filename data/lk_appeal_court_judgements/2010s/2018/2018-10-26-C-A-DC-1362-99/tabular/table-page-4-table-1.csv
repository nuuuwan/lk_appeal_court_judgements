"Being  aggrieved  with  the  said  judgment  dated  6th  December  1999,  this  appeal"
"preferred by the Appellant seeking to set aside the  District Court judgment."
"In  the  District  Court  trial, 
it  was  the  evidence  of  the  Appellant  that  prior  to  ih"
"March  1982  Lots  1 and  2 in  Plan  No.  618  were  the  paddy  lands  of the  Appellant"
"and  on  ih March  1982 the  Respondent filled  the Western  boundary of the  paddy"
"land  with  sand  and  stones  up  to  20  feet  length  and  that  he  complained  to  the"
"Grama  Niladhari and  the Commissioner General of the Agrarian  Services."
"Appellant also gave evidence and  stated  that  prior to  1982 there  had  been  some"
"minor  incidents.  Also  it  was  the  contention  of the  Appellant  that  although  there"
"had  been  minor  incidents,  on  or  about  ih  March  1982  the  Respondent  built the"
"stony wall  in  his paddy land encroaching a portion."
"However, 
I  observed  that, 
in  the  cross  examination  the  Appellant  has  admitted"
"that  the  land  of the  Appellant  is  low  land  and  Respondent's  land  is  about  5 feet"
"above  the  paddy field.  It is  also  admitted  that  he  himself showed  the  boundaries"
"to  the  Surveyor  Samarasinghe  and  they  were  shown  in  black  (vide  pages  107,"
"111  and 113 in  the appeal brief- District Court Proceedings dated 16th  July 1992)."
"Further,  the  Appellant  has  admitted  that  the  land  possessed  by  him  was  not  in"
"conformity with the superimposed Plan  (vide page  114 in  the appeal brief)."
"Furthermore,  Counsel  for the  Respondent  has  brought  an  important  point  to  the"
"attention  of  this  court  that  when 
the  Appellant  was  questioned 
regarding 
the"
"land,  Appellant  was 
unaware  of 
the 
land  marks 
and 
possession 
of 
the"
"vide  pages 
construction  standing  on  the  questioned  area  (Western  boundary)  -"
"96,  116 in  the appeal brief"
"In  contrast,  the  Respondent  gave  evidence  to  prove  his  title  to  Lots  14  and  15."
"For  this,  he  produced  deeds  marked  V2,  V3  and  V4.  And  he  stated 
that  he"
"possessed  Lot  B  along  with  Lot  A  during  his  father  was  alive  and  he  further"
"stated  that  the  well  standing  on  in  Lot  2 in  plan  No.  618  was  used  by  his  family"
"from  old  days.  He  also  answered  when  cross  examined  that the  stony  bund  had"
"been  there  when  his  father was  alive  and  when  he  was  questioned  that  in  1975"
