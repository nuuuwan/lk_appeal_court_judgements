"A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J."
"T his  is  a  partition  action  where  the  learned  District Judge  of  Badulla  delivered"
"judgment  has  preferred  this  appeal  against  the  judgment  to  this  Court  by  filing  a"
"Notice of Appeal dated 31.10.1998 which is within 14 days' time limit. The Counsel who"
"appears  for  the  Substituted~Plaintiff~Respondent and  the  2nd  Defendant~Respondent"
"takes up a preliminary objection as follows:~"
"1  The Notice of Appeal has not been signed by the Attorney~at~law on record; and"
"2  Even though revocation of proxy had been filed along with the Notice of Appeal,"
"no leave  was obtained from  the District Court in terms  of Section  27(2)  of the"
"Civil Procedure Code."
"Therefore,  he submits that since there is no valid Notice of Appeal,  there is  no appeal"
"properly constituted before this Court to hear this matter."
"The  question  that has  now arisen before this  Court is  whether the  Notice  of Appeal"
"signed by the Appellant is in order or not."
"In terms of Section 27(1)  of the Civil Procedure Code,  a proxy of a client to appoint a"
"registered Attomey~at~ Law to make any appearance or application, or do any act shall"
"be in writing signed by the client and filed in court."
"Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code states:~"
"""when so filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the leave of the court and after notice to the"
"registered attorney by a writing Signed by the client and filed in court  or until the client dies, or"
"until the registered attorney dies,  is removed, or suspended,  or otherwise becomes incapable to"
"act, or until all proceedings in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the"
"client. """
"A revocation of a proxy can be effected either by the client or by a registered attorney. If"
"a registered  attorney,  for  whatever reasons,  wishes  to  discontinue his  services  to  the"
"client,  he  may  sign  a  revocation  at  his  office  before  seeking  permission  of  court."
