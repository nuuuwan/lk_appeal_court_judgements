"and 
the  order  of  the 
learned  District  Judge  that  whether  the  Appellant  has  a"
"reasonable cause or not."
"The  Appellant  in  her  evidence  (examination  in-chief)  stated  that,  she  knew  that"
"she  had  to  come to court that day and  the domestic inquiry started  at 8.30am  on"
"16.07.1998  and 
that  she 
intended  to  come  to  court  after  testifying  before  the"
"domestic inquiry.  She further stated  that that it was  due to  any sort of negligence"
"on  her  part.  Nevertheless, 
in  her  cross  examination 
it  was  revealed 
that  she"
"actually forgot that she was  to  be  present in  court that day and  she  remembered"
"it only around 9.00am."
