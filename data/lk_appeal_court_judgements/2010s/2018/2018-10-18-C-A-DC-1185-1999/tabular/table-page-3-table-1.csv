in 
the  District  Court  of  Ratnapura  on  several  occasions."

"not present before the Court,  the Counsel of the Appellant informed the court that"

"action  on  the  ground  of non-appearance  of the  Appellant.  (Vide  page  09  in  the"
"appeal brief)"

the  Appellant  filed  a  Petition  dated  30th  July  1998  along  with  an"
"affidavit  (vide  page at 33-34  in  the  brief)  and  made  an  application  to  the  District"
"Court in  terms of section  87(3)  of the  Civil  Procedure Code to set aside the order"
"dated  16.07.1998 and  restore the Appellant's action."

"Court that there were reasonable grounds for the non-appearance of the  plaintiff."
