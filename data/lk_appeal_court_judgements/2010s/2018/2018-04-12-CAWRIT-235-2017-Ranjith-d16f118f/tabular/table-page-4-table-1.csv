"The  complaint  of the  petitioner  is  that  he  was  not"
"gIven  a 
fair  hearing 
in 
the 
inquiry  which 
led 
to 
the  said"
"decision. 
Perusal  of  the  document  P  53 
shows 
that  the"
"petitioner has failed  to  establish his  entitlement to  this  liquor"
"license at the said inquiry."
"Learned Counsel for the petitioner relies on the"
"affidavit  marked P  54 to  establish 
that he  had  furnished 
all"
"material  pertaining 
to  his  entitlement  at 
the  said 
inquiry."
"However, 
this  Court  observes  that  this  is  an  affidavit  which"
"had been prepared on 12.08.2014. When queried by this Court"
"from 
the 
learned  Counsel 
for 
the 
petitioner 
as 
to 
the"
"background  which  led  to  the  preparation  of this  affidavit,  the"
"learned  Counsel  was  unable 
to  explain  any  back  ground"
"reason as to why such affidavit was prepared in the year 2014."
"(This  application  has  been  filed 
in  the  year  201 7.)  Therefore"
"there 
is  no 
justification  before 
this  Court  as 
to  why 
the"
"particular  Attorney-at-Law  who  is  said  to  have  appeared  for"
"the  petitioner  was  prompted  to  prepare  this  affidavit  almost"
"four years ago.  This casts a  serious  doubt to the credibility of"
"this affidavit."
