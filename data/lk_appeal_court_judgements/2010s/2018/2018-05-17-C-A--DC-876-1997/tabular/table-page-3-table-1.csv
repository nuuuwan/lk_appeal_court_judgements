(the  1st  Defendant)  children  of  Horathala?  Were 
they 
in  fact"
"consanguine  sisters?  These  are  the  issues  that  arise  in  this  case.  If they  are  in  fact"
"consanguine  sisters,  they  would  become  co~owners of  the  property  left  to  them by"

Did 
the  Plaintiff  establish  on  a  balance  of  probabilities"
"Nandawathie was indeed a child of Horathala? The learned District Judge of Kandy in"
"his judgment dated 04.04.1997 has dismissed the plaintiff's action holding inter alia that"
"the  Plaintiff  has  not  established  that  Horathala  was  the  father  of  her  predecessor~"
"Nandawathie.  No  birth  certificate  of  Nandawathie  was  produced  by  the  Plaintiff."
"Neither was the marriage certificate of Nandawathie's mother and Horathala produced"
"at the trial. So the paternity was in doubt and the fact that Horathala fathered N andawathie was not"
"established~this was the reasoning of the learned District Judge."
"The  Plaintiff~Appellant has  appealed  against  the judgment and revolving  around this"
"factual matrix, one has to turn to evidence that has been led on the part of the Plaintiff"
"to ascertain whether the paternity of Horathala in relation to  Nandawathie has  been"
"established."
"The issue, as encapsulated above, is whether Nandawathie (the plaintiff's predecessor)"
"is  the daughter of Horathala.  There were items  of relevant  evidence  that were  relied"
"upon  by 
the  Plaintiff~Respondent  to  establish 
that  Nandawathie 
(the  plaintiff's"
"predecessor) was in fact the daughter of Horathala. These items of evidence can now be"
"gone into."
