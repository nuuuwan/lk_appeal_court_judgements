"","Section 59(6) of the Law reads:"

"","The  Supreme  Court 
in  Mohideen  v.  Assistant  Commissioner  of Co-operative  Development,"
"","Kalmunai  (80  N.L.R.  206)  was  called  upon  to  interpret  Section  53A  (5)  of  the  Co-operative"

"","Magistrate are that-"
"","(i) 
the  Magistrate  has  no  jurisdiction  because 
the 
last  known  place  of  business  or"
"","residence does not fall within the local jurisdiction of the Magistrate."
"","(ii) 
that he  had paid the amount."
"","(iii) 
that he is not the defaulter in that he is not the person from whom the amount is due."
"","I am of the view that this is the correct interpretation to be adopted in interpreting section 59(4)"

"","Accordingly, I hold that the Appellant cannot take up the position before the Magistrate that the"
