"Learned  President's  Counsel 
further 
submitted 
that  when 
the"
"indictment  was  served  upon  the  Petitioner,  he  was  not  ""remanded""  as"
"there was  no  reason  to  act under Section 14 of the  Bail  Act,  although the"
"High  Court  made  a  variation  of  bail  conditions  upon  its 
initial  order"
"granting bail, whilst acting in revision."
"In  making 
submissions  on 
factual  matters, 
learned  President's"
"Counsel  stated  that  the  succeeding Judge,  at the  commencement of  trial,"
"had  read  over 
the 
indictment 
to 
the  Petitioner  for 
the  2nd 
time  and"
"recorded  his  plea  again,  an  incorrect  procedure  which  has  no  statutory"
"support.  Thereafter,  the High Court remanded the  three accused  when it"
"patently lacked jurisdiction to do so.  The High Court did not comply with"
"the mandatory provisions of Section 15 of the Bail Act, as it failed  to record"
"its reasons as to why it cancels a subsisting bail order and the Court had no"
"discretion over the question of bail."
"Learned President's Counsel submitted that the Petitioner, since his"
"enlargement on bail by the High Court twice before the commencement of"
"trial,  had  not  violated  any  of 
the  bail  conditions  which  warranted"
"cancellation of his bail."
"It is  contended  by  the  Petitioner  that when a  person comes  before"
"Court,  it  could  act  under  Section  7  of  the  Bail  Act  in  granting  bail  and"
"could  also  act  under  Section  14  if it  refuses  bail.  But  in  remanding  the"
"Petitioner  and  refusing 
to  enlarge  him  on  bail  by  cancellation  of  the"
"existing bail order, the High Court did not act under provisions of Section"
"14  of  the  Bail  Act,  in violation  of the  principles  of  law  enunciated  in the"
"6"
