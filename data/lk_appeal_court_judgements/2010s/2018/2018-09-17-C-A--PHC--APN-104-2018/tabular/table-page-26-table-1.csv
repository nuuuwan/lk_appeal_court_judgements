"In view of the above reasoning, we conclude that the Petitioner has"

to  make  a  case  with  exceptional  circumstances  where  a  positive"
"miscarriage  of 
justice  had  occasioned.  Accordingly,  we  make  order"
"refusing the application of  the Petitioner seeking to  revise the impugned"
"orders of the High Court dated 3rd September 2018."
"We make further order dismissing the petition of the Petitioner."
