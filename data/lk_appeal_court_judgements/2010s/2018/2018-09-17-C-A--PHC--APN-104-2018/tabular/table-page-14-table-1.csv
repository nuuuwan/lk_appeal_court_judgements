"""otherwise"" 
to 
the  express  options  envisaged 
in  the  said  sub  section."
"Therefore, it is clear that the order of remand made by the High Court was"
"in  fact  based  on  a 
statutory  provision,  contrary 
to 
the  claim  by 
the"
"Petitioner."
"The  failure  of  the  High  Court,  in  making  the  impugned  order,  to"
"refer  to  a  statutory  provision,  by  itself  would  not  invalidate  or could  be"
"procedural 
irregularity  which  warrants 
exercise 
of 
considered 
as"
"revisionary  powers of this Court in view of the judgment of the Supreme"
"Court in Kumaranatunga v Samarasinghe (1983)  2 Sri L.R.  63, where it laid"
"down the principle that;"
"""It 
is  well-settled 
that  an  exercise  of a  power  will  be  referable 
to  a"
"jurisdiction  which  confers  validity  upon 
it  and  not 
to  a jurisdiction"
"under which  it will  be  nugatory.  This  principle has  been  applied even  to"
"cases  where  a  Statute  which  confers  no  power  has  been  quoted  as"
"authority  for  a particular  act,  and  there  was  in  force  another  Statute"
"which conferred that power""."
"The said sub section (2)  of Section 263, confers power to a trial Court,"
"at the  adjournment stage  of  a  trial  to  ""enlarge""  an  accused  ""on his  own"
"recognizance  or  his  simple  undertaking  to  appear.""  This  subsection  also"
"reserves  the  power  to 
the  trial  Court  to  order  ""otherwise""  but  it  must"
"record its reasons for doing so."
"Section  263  is  not  a  totally  a  new  provision  of  procedure  that had"
"been introduced by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act for the first  time."
