"E-Code  states  that a  court  order  being  made  against  the  public  officer  should  not inhibit the"
"disciplinary inquiry if it is  still  in  progress  and  that it should  be  concluded  and  an  appropriate"
"disciplinary  order  made  unless  there  are  unavoidable  obstacles  to  the  continuation  of  the"
"disciplinary  inquiry.  These  sections  reinforce  the  proposition  that  both  proceedings  can  be"
"conducted in parallel."
"The question whether parallel proceedings could be conducted when both proceedings deal with"
"the same charges/offences is  also  answered  in  the affirmative by the  E-Code.  Section  27:11  of"
"the  E-Code 
requires  the  relevant  disciplinary  authority  to  hold  an 
independent  disciplinary"
"inquiry even where court proceedings for an offence which falls within the Code are in progress."
"Therefore,  it can  be  reasonably  concluded  that the  disciplinary authority can  normally inquire"
"into  the  offence  that  is  already  before  court 
in  addition  to  other  relevant  offences.  This"
"conclusion 
is  strengthened  when  one  considers  section  27:15  of  the  E-Code.  The  section"
"envisages departmental inquiries and court proceedings being held Iwith regard to a charge or a"
"series of charges' and states that the fact that the officer is acquitted in the Court proceedings"
"should  in  no  way  affect  the  implementing  of the  disciplinary  order  made  on  the  matters"
"revealed in the departmental disciplinary inquiry. Similarly, section 27:14 of the  E-Code states"
"that a public officer who has  been acquitted of a charge  or series  of charges  at a departmental"
"inquiry but found guilty of the same charges at a Court of law, could still be dealt with in terms"
"of the Code. Therefore, the provisions of the Establishments Code make it very clear that parallel"
