"appointment  of the  administrator  is  immaterial;  the  action  may  also  bring  for  the"
"recovery of an immovable property from a trespasser too."
"In a very large majority of actions in our courts for  declaration of title to immovable"
"property,  the  claimant is  required  to  sue  in  his  own  name  in  order  to  establish  his"
"rights.  But there are some forms  of actions  where the assertion of a claimant's rights"
"must be made on his behalf by some other person suing in a representative capacity."
"In the present case, the administrator is  the wife of the deceased; she has obtained the"
"letter of administration of Case No.  29617 IT in the District Court of Colombo duly"
"produced  and  marked  as  P5  in  the  trial  without  any  objections  of the  Appellants,"
"thereby her position cannot be questioned."
