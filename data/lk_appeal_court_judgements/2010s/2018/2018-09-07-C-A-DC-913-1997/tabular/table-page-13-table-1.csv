"Further they stated  that the  trial judge in  any event erred in law by not considering"
"the  fact  that  the  Appellants  have  effected  extensive  bona fide  improvements  to  the"
"property concerned in arriving at his said judgment."
"However, 
the  Respondent  submitted 
that  as  per 
the  maxim  caveat  emptor 
the"
"Appellants  have  not taken any precaution concerning the property in question prior"
"the  sale;  have  failed  to  check  the  existence  or  non-existence  of previous  deeds  by"
"which  N andawathie  alleged 
to  have  obtained 
title 
to 
the  property  in  question."
"Respondent  stated  further, 
the  Appellants  cannot  claim  remedies  of  a  bona  fide"
"purchaser  since 
they  have  failed 
to  exercise  prudence  and  care  in  checking  the"
"creditworthiness  of the  vendor  and  whether  the  vendor  had  title  to  the  property  in"
"question before purchasing."
"After careful  evaluation  of all  the  documents  marked by the  Respondent,  I  observe"
"that P4 is  a notice of quit which had been sent to  the Appellants by the Respondent."
"In the trial the Appellants  admit that they received the notice;  and no evidence from"
"them to show that they disputed the contents therein."
"In the District Court, the Appellants in their answer had only sought the dismissal of"
"the  plaint;  they  have  not  claimed  a  declaration  that  they  are  bona fide  purchasers."
"Further they were not raising any issues regarding the matter."
"The Appellants for the first time in the appeal, state that they are bona fide purchasers."
"This claim has  to be  decided by leading evidence and also  after raising issues in  that"
"aspect  before  the  District  Court,  the  said  question  is  not  a  question  of law.  The"
"question under the reference is  a question of fact."
"Therefore,  I am in a view that the Appellants cannot be permitted to raise a question"
"with regard to the question of fact for the first time in the appeal."
