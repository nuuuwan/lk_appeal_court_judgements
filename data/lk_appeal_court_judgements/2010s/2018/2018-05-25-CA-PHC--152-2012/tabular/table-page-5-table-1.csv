"Furthermore, the word  ""court"" in  section  189(1) of the Code  is  defined in  section  5 of the Code"
"to  mean, 
""unless  there 
is  something  in 
the  subject  or  context  repugnant  thereto,  a  Judge"
"empowered by law to act judicially alone, or a body of Judges empowered by law to act judicially"
"as  a body,  when  such  Judge  or body  of Judges  is  acting judicially"".  I am  of the  view that in  the"
"instant case,  there is  nothing in  the subject or context repugnant to ascribing a judge exercising"
"revisionary or appellate jurisdiction to the word ""court"" where the impugned judgement or order"
"contains a clerical  error.  If not, a party may seek to obtain undue advantage from a clerical error"
"committed by court by impugning a judgement or order the very next day after it is delivered and"
"arguing  that the  original  court cannot thereafter correct the  clerical  error in  the judgement or"
"order. Accordingly,  I am  of the view that the learned High Court judge should have corrected the"
"obvious clerical  error and  erred in failing to do so."
"There 
is  a  further  reason  as 
to  why  the  High  Court  should  not  have  exercised 
revisionary"
