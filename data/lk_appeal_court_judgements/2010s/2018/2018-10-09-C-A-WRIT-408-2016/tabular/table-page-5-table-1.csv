"literal, mechanical interpretation cannot be given to that clause."
"In any event, after overruling the objection, the Inquiring Officer,"
"further  accommodating  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,"
"has postponed the inquiry until 16.12.2014. As seen from P15(a)"
"dated  02.12.2014, 
learned 
counsel 
for 
the  petitioner  has"
"thereafter,  referring  to  the  said  clause,  written  to  the  Director"
"General of Customs to appoint another inquiring officer, but the"
"Director  General  of  Customs  has  not  thought  it  fit  to  accede  to"

inquiry  and  even  the  name  of  the 
Inquiring"
"Officer.    If  there  was  a  collusion  between  the  Inquiring  Officer"
