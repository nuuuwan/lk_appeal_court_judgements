"said  inquiry  is  the  active  role  played  by  Mr.  Saman  de  Silva-"
"Deputy Director of Customs, who seized the consignment, at the"
"aforesaid inquiry.  The Inquiring Officer was the 2nd respondent-"

for 
the  petitioners  who"
"appeared  at 
the 
inquiry  has  unhesitatingly 
recognized  Mr."
"Saman de Silva as the Prosecuting Officer."
"According  to  P11-the  letter  sent  by  learned  Additional  Solicitor"
"General  on  behalf  of  the  3rd  respondent-Attorney  General,  the"
"custom  inquiry  was  directed/instructed  to  be  held  “forthwith”."
"Even  though  the  letter  is  formally  addressed  to  “the  Director"
"it  has  particularly  been  sent 
to 
the 
General  of  Customs”,"
"letter 
further 
“ATTENTION:-Mr.  Saman  de  Silva 
(DDC)”.  That"
