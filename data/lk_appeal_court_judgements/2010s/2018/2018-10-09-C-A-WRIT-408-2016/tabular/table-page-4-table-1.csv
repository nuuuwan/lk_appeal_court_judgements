"I
  must  also  add  that  P11  has  been  sent  with  a  copy  to  the"
"learned counsel for the petitioners upon the request made by the"
"said counsel by P10 seeking a direction to the 1st respondent to"
"hold the inquiry within two weeks from that letter."
"In  that  backdrop,  in  my  view,  Mr.  Saman  de  Silva  had  every"
"right  to  actively  involve  in  the  whole  process  to  make  sure that"
"the inquiry is commenced and concluded expeditiously. I see no"
"collusion  between 
the  2nd 
respondent-Inquiring  Officer  and"
"Prosecuting Officer-Mr. Saman de Silva."
"As seen from P13, at the commencement of the inquiry, learned"
"counsel for the petitioners has objected the inquiry being held by"
"Mr. Premaratne on three grounds: (a) notice was delivered on the"
"24th November 2014 regarding the inquiry to be held on the 26th"
"November  2014  and  there  was  insufficient  time  to  prepare  for"
"the inquiry; (b) on the 10th November 2014 Mr. Saman de Silva"
"informed 
the 
counsel 
that  Mr.  Premaratne  would  be 
the"
"Inquiring Officer and the inquiry would be fixed in four days and"
"concluded;  (c)  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  inquiry  Mr."
"Premaratne informed Mr. Saman de Silva to brief the case.  This"
"objection  has  been  overruled  by 
the 
Inquiring  Officer-Mr."
"Premaratne, which in my view is not unjustifiable."
"It 
is 
the  contention  of 
learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel 
for 
the"
"petitioners 
that 
in 
terms  of  clause  7.3.1  of 
the  Manual  of"
"Procedure  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Customs  marked  P14,  if  a  party"
"objects  as  such,  the  Inquiring  Officer  has  no  alternative  but  to"
"refer the matter to the Director General of Customs irrespective"
