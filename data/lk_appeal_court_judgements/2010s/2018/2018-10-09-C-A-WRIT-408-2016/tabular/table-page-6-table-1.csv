"i
nquiry to be commenced within two weeks from that date, and"
"by  P11  dated  04.11.2014  the  Customs  was  directed/instructed"
"to hold the inquiry forthwith.  I must also emphasize that there"
"is  absolutely  no  irregularity  or  bias, 
in  the  Inquiring  Officer"
"asking  the  Prosecuting  Officer,  to  brief  the  prosecution  case  at"
"the commencement of the inquiry."
"At 
the 
inquiry  no  documents 
regarding 
terms  of  payment,"
"shipping  and  CUSDEC  have  been  tendered  by  the  petitioners."
"That  is  the  crux  of  the  matter.    No  proper  person  has  been"
"identified  as  responsible  for  entering  50  containers  of  sugar  to"
"the  harbour.    Notwithstanding  the  position  of  the  petitioners"
"that the importer was Kala Traders, the contracts relied upon by"
"the  petitioners  marked  P4(a)-(c)  are  still  unsigned  by  Kala"
"Traders;  and  moreover,  a  director  of  Kala  Traders,  by  affidavit"
"tendered  in  the  earlier  case-the  precursor-CA  (Writ)  686/2007"
"has disowned any connection whatsoever of Kala Traders to this"
"50 containers of sugar."
"The  allegation  of  the  respondents  is  that  the  petitioners  have"
"acted 
in  violation  of  sections  12  and  43  of 
the  Customs"
"Ordinance,  No.  17  of  1869,  as  amended,  which  statutory"
"provisions  are 
fleshed  out 
in  schedule  B 
to 
the  Customs"
"Ordinance 
read  with  Extra  Ordinary  Gazette  1022/06 
of"
"08.04.1998 issued under Import and Export  (Control) Act, No.1"
"of 1969, as amended."
"In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  see  no  illegality,"
"irrationality or procedural impropriety of the impugned order."
"Application is dismissed with costs."
