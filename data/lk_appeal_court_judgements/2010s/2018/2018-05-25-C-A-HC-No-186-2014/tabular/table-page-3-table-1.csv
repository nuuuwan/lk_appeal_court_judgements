"Learned  Counsel  for 
the  accused-appellant 
invited 
this  Court 
to"
"consider the contradictions marked VI  to  V4 and submitted that in view of"
"these contradictions,  the sole eye witness's evidence ought to  be treated  as"
"unreliable and should not have been acted upon by the trial Court."
"In  view  of  the  submissions  of  the  accused-appellant,  it  is  necessary"
"to  consider  the  sequence  of  events  as  narrated  by  the  sole  eye-witness  to"
"the  incident,  who  himself  is  an  injured,  in  order  to  fully  appreciate  the"
"significance of the contrad ichons marked VI to V 4."
"Witness  Bn/ldnm,  in his  evidence  before  the  High  Court stated  that,"
"at  the  time  of  the  incident  he  was  employed  as  a  driver  of a  private  bus"
"which serviced the bus route of Maharagama - Jayawardenepura Hospital."
"The deceased was the conductor of this bus. The wih1ess  knew the accused"
"well  and  addressed  him  as  Podi  Mnl1l7tulZ.  On the  day  of  the  incident,  the"
"accused-appellant  got  in  to  their  bus  when  they  were  returning  home  in"
"the night.  He wanted  the bus to  be stopped by the side of a  paddy field  for"
"him to  pick a ""spiral"". Time was about 9.15 in the night."
"Upon  a 
request  by 
the  accused-appellant, 
the  deceClsed 
too  had"
"accompanied  him  to  bring  this  item  to 
the  bus.  After  a  few  minutes,  the"
"accused-appellant 
returned 
to 
the  parked  bus  alone  and  wanted 
the"
"witness  also  to  come  with  him.  When  enquired  about  the  deceased,  the"
"accused -appellant strangely replied that ""he died and was drunk""."
