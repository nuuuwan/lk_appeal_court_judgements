"","Contradiction  marked  as  V2  is  in  relation  to  a  meeting  the  witness"

stated 
that  he  met

"","Another  contradiction  was  marked  as  V3  by  the  accused-appellant"
"","on the witness's statement made to  the Police where it is  stated  that when"
"","the  accused-appellant  returned  to  the  bus  without  the  deceased,  he  was"
"","clad 
in  a  shirt  and  a  pair  of  shorts  whereas  his  evidence  at  the  non"

In fairness to  the witness, we note that he has repeatedly"
"","stated 
in  evidence  that  he  could  not  recall  every  detail  of 
the  incident"
"","accurately.  This  is  to  be  expected  as  the  wih1ess  has  given  evidence  12"
