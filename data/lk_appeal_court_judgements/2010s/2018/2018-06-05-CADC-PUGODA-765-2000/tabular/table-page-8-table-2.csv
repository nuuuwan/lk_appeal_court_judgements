"minutes of 12.09.2017.  In that order I alluded to the rebuttable character and nature of"
"the presumption in Section 114 ( d) of the Evidence Ordinance as exemplified below."
"""Although there is a presumption that official acts have been regularly performed, and that they"
"have been performed in accordance with rules and regulations bearing on the subject, yet this is a"
"rebuttable presumption.  In fact,  it is  left  to  the Court  to  raise that presumption or not,  having"
"regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case"".s"
"""A presumption that an act was regularly done arises only on proof that the act was in fact done,"
"as the presumption is limited to the regularity of the act done and does not extend to the doing of"
"the Act itsdf"".9"
"""In other words, the presumption that may be raised is that the act if proved to have been done"
"was done in a regular manner. There is no presumption that an act was done, of which there is no"
"evidence and the proof of which is essential to the case raised""l0"
