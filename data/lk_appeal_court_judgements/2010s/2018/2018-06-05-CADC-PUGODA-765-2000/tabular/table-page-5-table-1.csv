"the notice of appeal to Court was 16th June, a Friday~a day on which the Court was not"
"closed.  Had the last date been a Saturday, the 1th June, then the notice of appeal could"
"validly have been filed  on Monday the 19th
,  when the Court was open""  and held that,"
"""Notice  of  appeal  was  not filed  within  the  time  limit  of fourteen  days  permitted by"
"section 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code, because allowing for  the fact that the date"
"of judgment and date of filing of notice are not counted and the two Sundays had to be"
"excluded, there was  time to file the notice of appeal only until 16th June (Friday)."
"When the 14th  day falls  on a  Saturday or on a  public holiday on which day the"
"courts are closed, whether an appellant can file  the notice of appeal on the next"
"following Monday?"
"This matter was favourably answered in the case of Selenchina  v.  Mohamed Marikar"
"and Others,S  where  the notice  of  appeal  was  presented  on  20.10.1986.  If that day  is"
"excluded,  the  period  of  14  days  excluding  the  date  of  judgment  pronounced  (i.e."
"30.09.1986)  and  intervening  Sundays  and  public  holidays  would  end  on  17.10.1986"
"which  was  a  public  holiday.  The  next  day  on  which  the  notice  should  have  been"
"presented was the 18th
,  being a Saturday,  on which the office of the court was closed."
"The  next  day,  the  19th  was  a  Sunday  which too  had  to  be  excluded  in  terms  of  the"
"section."
"Thus it was held that the notice filed on 20.10.1986 was within the period of 14 days as"
"provided for in the Section 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code."
