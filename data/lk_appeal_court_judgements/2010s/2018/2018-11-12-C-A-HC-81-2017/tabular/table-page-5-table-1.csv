"Appellant submitted  that the  prosecutrix  had failed  to  mention the name"
"of the  Appellant in her statement to  Police and also  to  the medical  officer"
"in  the  short  history.  He  also  referred  to 
the  evidence  that  she  did  not"
"identify  the  intruder at the  time  of  the commission of  the  sexual  act and"
"also  in  Court.  In  relation  to  the 
name  of  the  intruder,  PW2  ""U.B.""  who"
"rushed 
to 
the  Proecutrix's  house  identified  him  as  ""Nandana""  whereas"
"according  to 
learned  President's  Counsel, 
the  Appellant  is  ""Chandana""."
"Therefore,  he  contended  that  the  evidence  led  by  the  prosecution  had"
"failed  to  establish the identity of the Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt"
". and-therefore the trial  Court was in error when it decided  to  convict him"
