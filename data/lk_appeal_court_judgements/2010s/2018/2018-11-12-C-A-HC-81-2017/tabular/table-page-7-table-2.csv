"This  obviously 
is 
the 
first  opportunity 
for 
the  prosecutrix 
to"
"implicate the name of the Appellant after the initial identification that was"
"done  soon  after  the  incident.  As  already  noted,  it  is  evident  from  the"
"manner in which the prosecutrix had answered the questions put to her by"
"Counsel  that one  would  experience  difficulty  in following  a  sequence  in"
"her narration of events. This is to be expected of a woman whose language"
"skills  and 
the  ability  of  expressing  her  experience 
through  words  are"
"obviously  not 
the  best,  considering  her  underprivileged 
social  back"
"ground."
