"In Ameen Vs  Rasheed [6 CLW 8], Abraham CJ observed;"
"""It has been represented to  us on the part of the petitioner that even if we find the"
"order to  be appealable,  we still have discretion to act in revision.  It has been said"
"in this court often enough that revision of an appealable order is an exceptional"

"has been sought rather than the ordinary method of appeal.  I can see no reason"

"when he might have appealed,  and I would allow the preliminary objectinn and"
"dismiss the application without costs""."
"The above judgment of Abraham CJ was cited with approval by his Lordship"
