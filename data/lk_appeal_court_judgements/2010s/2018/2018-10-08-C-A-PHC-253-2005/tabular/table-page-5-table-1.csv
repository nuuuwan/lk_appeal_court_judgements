"This submission had two components in it."
"Firstly,  the  learned  Counsel_submitted  before  their  Lordships  that"
"there  was  no  valid  application  which complies  with  the  requirements  of"
"Form B in the schedule to the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act."
"Secondly, it was submitted that there is no valid affidavit in support"
"of the application, in compliance of Form C of the schedule to the said Act,"
"as  the  said  affidavit  is  defective  since  it  had  not  indicated  the  place  of"
"deposition and ""  ... according to  the  body of the affidavit and the jurat,  one does"
"not know  whether  the  deponent  took  an  oath  or  made  an  affirmation  and for  that"
"reason as well this affidavit was defective."""
"It is  thus clear that the second  component had  two parts in it.  The"
"first  part dealt with  the  deficiency  of  the  affidavit as  to  the  place  it was"
"affirmed/ sworn  to  while  the  second  part  deals  with  the  ambiguity  of"
"""whether the deponent took an oath or made an affirmation""."
"It is on this second part of the second component that the Appellant"
"before us, seeks to challenge the validity of the order of ejectment, claiming"
"that  there  was  no  valid  affidavit  in  support  of  the  statements  of  facts"
