"Learned  Judge  of the  High  Court was  not satisfied  of the  identity of the  2nd  and  3rd"
"accused  persons at the trial  hence he  had acquitted them for want of evidence."
"Counsel also submits that the evidence in favour of the Appellant was  not considered."
"Prosecution  witness  Upul  Sanjeewa  (who  was  the  4th  Accused  in  this  case)  revealed"
"many facts  in  connection  with this  case.  One  of them  was  that the Appellant around"
"11  - 12 in the night came in  a Container type full  bodied big lorry and instructed them"
"to unload the goods. That factor was  not contradicted  in  fact,  it was  corroborated  by"
"the prosecution witnesses.  Further goods recovered also tallies with the goods loaded"
"and the list of the lorry in  question."
"Similarly,  many other facts  submitted  by the  Counsel  were  considered  by this  court,"
"we  also  observed that the learned trial Judge had  considered  almost all  the factors  in"
"his judgment. Considering  the submissions,  evidence and  the judgment, we  find  that"
"there  is  no necessity for us  to interfere with the findings of the  Learned  Judge of the"
"High Court.  Hence, these two grounds of appeal also fail  in  its own merits."
