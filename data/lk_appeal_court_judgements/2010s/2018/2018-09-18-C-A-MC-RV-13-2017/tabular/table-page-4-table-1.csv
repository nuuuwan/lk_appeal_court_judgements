"","As  per the written submissions tendered, pending this application and the District"
"","Court case, the Respondent was put back in 
possession  of the said  land and"
"","premises as a result of the order marked P9  made by the learned  Magistrate."
"","Since 
the  order  which  ejected 
the  Respondent  and  placed 
the  Petitioner 
in"
"","possession  of the said  land  and  premises was  set  aside  by  this  court  by  its  order"
"","dated  28.06.2016  marked as  P6F  and  the Special  leave  to Appeal  application  was"
"","withdrawn  by the Petitioner, the order of this court setting aside the order of the"
"","learned Magistrate marked PS  is the valid order with regard to the application filed"
"","by the Petitioner under the State Land  (Recovery of Possession) ordinance."
"","Hence  the order ejecting the  Respondent from the said  land  and  premises  by the"
"","Magistrate is  not valid.  Further, the placing of the Petitioner in  possession  of the"
"","said  land  and  premises is  not based  on  a valid  order. 
In  other words, the  learned"
"","Magistrate placed the petitioner in  possession on the strength of an  invalid order."
"","Magistrates' courts or any court has  inherent power to repair the injuries done by"

"","Saddassi Thero 63  NLR  31)  A court whose Act  has  caused  injury to a suiter has  an"
"","inherent power to make restitution.  This power is exercisable by a court of original"

as 
well 
as 
by 
the  Supreme  Court 
(see

"","It is  not relevant whether the respondent prayed  for restoration  in  his application"
"","to revise the order of the learned  Magistrate dated 09.08.2012  marked  as  PS. 
As"
"","per the  said  application  marked  P6A,  the  Respondent had  prayed for a stay order"
"","restraining the  Petitioner from taking steps to eject him from the  premises.  This"
"","indicates that at the time the said application was filed in this court, the ejection of"
"","the Respondent had not taken place. 
It should be noted that the Petitioner has not"
"","revealed  the date of ejection of the Respondent from the premises after the order"
"","marked  PS  which was vacated  by this court."
