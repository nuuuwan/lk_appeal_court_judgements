the  plaintiff, 
the  court 
shall  make  order  setting  aside 
the"
"dismissal."
"In 
the  course  of  rejecting  the  application  to  set  aside 
the  order"
"made  upon  default, 
I  must  observe  that  the 
learned  District  Judge"
"misdirected  himself  on 
the 
law  and 
facts. 
In 
the 
case  of  Rev."
"Sumanathissa  Vs.  Harry  2009  1  Sri.LR 
31, 
this  Court  has  laid  down"
"that  the  Court  must  apply  a 
liberal  approach  in  determining  whether"
"the  plaintiff  has  satisfied  court 
in  adducing 
reasonable  grounds"
"for 
non 
appearance. 
In  other  words 
the 
court 
alluded 
to 
the"
"yardstick 
of 
a 
subjective 
test 
rather 
than 
a 
less 
flexible"
"objective 
test 
in  determining  what 
is 
reasonable. 
The  District"
"Court  has  misdirected 
itself 
in  not  having'  considered 
the 
fact"
"that 
the  plaintiff  had  given  evidence  on  an  earlier  occasion  when"
"this  case  was 
taken  up  at  an  ex-parte  trial  owing 
to 
the  absence"
"of  the  defendant. 
This  salient  feature  demonstates 
the  diligence"
"manifested  by 
the  plaintiff 
to  prosecute  his  action  against 
the"
"defendant  and 
judgement  and  decree  entered 
there  was  an  ex  parte"
"in 
favour  of 
the  plaintiff  in 
the  case  until 
the  decree  was 
set"
"aside  upon  an  application  made  by  the  defendant."
"Before  a  District  Judge  proceeds  to  dismiss  an  action  filed  by  the"
"Plaintiff, 
he 
has 
to 
have 
regard 
to 
the 
past 
conduct 
of 
the"
"Plaintiff  such  as  his  presence  in  court  on  earlier  occasions. 
The"
"Court 
should  not  visit 
the  plaintiff  with 
a 
stringent 
sanction"
