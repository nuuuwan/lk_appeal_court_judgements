"said  land  for  more  than  ten  years  and  therefore,  she  has  the"
"prescriptive title on the said building and Lot 3  of the land."
"In Corea v.  Iseris Appuhamy 15 NLR  65 the Privy Council held"
"that the possession of a  co-owner was in law,  the possession of"
"the  other  co-owners  and  thus,  not  adverse  to  them. 
In  other"
"words  even 
if  one 
co-owner's  possession 
or 
the 
common"
"property or part thereof was of a  character incompatible with the"
"title  of  the  other  co··owners,  yet  that  co-owner  possesses  the"
"common property on behalf of all co-owners. 
It was not possible"
"for him to  put an end to  the possession by any secret intention"
