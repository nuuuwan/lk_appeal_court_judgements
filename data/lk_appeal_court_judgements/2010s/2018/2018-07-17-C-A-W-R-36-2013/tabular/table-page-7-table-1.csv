"The Petitioners submit that the appointment of staff to the Bank by Circular"
"marked P6,  is  not governed by ordinary contractual relationship but by  a statutory"

"at page 558 has observed,"
"""Contracts  of employment  between public  bodies  and their  staff may  not"
"raise  any  public  law 
issue,  and  the  enforcement  of specific  contractual"
"rights  and  the  question  of the  remedies  available  will  be  dealt  with 
in"
"accordance with the usual principles applicable to such disputes. """
