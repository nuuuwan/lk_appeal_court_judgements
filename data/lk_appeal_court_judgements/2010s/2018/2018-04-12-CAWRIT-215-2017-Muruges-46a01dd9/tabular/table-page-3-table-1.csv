"","learned  President's  Counsel 
for  the  4th 
It  is  the  submission  of the"
"","Respondent  that the  amended  petition  has  entirely  changed  the  scope  of"
"","the original application."
"","This  Court observes  that the  interest of the  petitioner  in  the original"
"","application  was to have the ongoing  customs inquiry suspended  and  halted"
"","on the basis that the inquirer is  bias."
"","In the amended  petition  what the petitioner prays for is to quash  the"
"","inquiring  officer  at  the  end  of the  said 
determination  made  by  the  said"
"","inquiry."
"","This  Court  observes 
that  the  decision  dated  14.07.2017  which 
is"
"","impugned  in  the  amended  petition  was  non  existent  at the  time  of filing"
"","this  application.  Therefore  it  is  the  view  of this  Court  that  the  petitioner"
"","through 
the  amended  petition  has  entirely  changed 
the  scope  of  the"
"","previous  application.  This  Court  is  of the  view  that  amendments  of this"
"","nature  which  entirely  change  the  nature,  character  and  the  scope  of an"
"","application  should  not be  permitted.  Therefore this Court decides to refuse"
"","to accept the amended  petition."
