"In support of this  contention,  learned President's Counsel relied  on"
"the fact that the Respondents merely obtained a print from the photograph"
"from  the  Facebook  account  of  the  Petitioner  subsequent  to  his  arrest  to"
"secure  his  connection 
to 
the  person  known  as  ""Ahmad  Fakih"".  The"
"affidavit of Andrew P Yanchus that was tendered to High Court contained"
"learned  President's  Counsel 
relied  on 
these  photographs.  In  addition,"
"another  fact  which  was  tendered  by  way  of  counter  affidavit  to  impress"
"upon  this  Court that  one  ""Rami  Fawaz""  was  indicted  before  the  District"
