"When these two Articles are read together, it becomes clear that the"
"scope of the applicability of the provisions of the treaty applies to ""persons"
".."
"sought  by  the  authorities  in  the  Requesting  State for  trial  or  punishment for  an"
"extraditable  offence""  whether they  are nationals  of either  of  the contracting"
"States  or not.  If the treaty is  intended to  be applied  only to  the citizens  of"
"the two contracting States, then the provisions of Article 3 becomes a mere"
"reiteration of the very purpose for which the treaty was entered into by the"
"two contracting States."
