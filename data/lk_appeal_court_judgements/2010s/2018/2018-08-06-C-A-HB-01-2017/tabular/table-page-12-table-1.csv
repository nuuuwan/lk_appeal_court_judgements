"The resultant position then would be, if an accompanying document"
"to  the  extradition request satisfies  the requirements of Article  9(a),  then it"
"shall  be received  and admitted as  evidence.  Similar provisions are found"
"in  Section  14(1)(a)  of  the  Extradition; Law.  Therefore,  the  accompanying"
"affidavits of Robert Walsh and Richard M Tucker are admissible evidence,"
"along with the documents annexed to them and marked as  Exhibits A to E"
"and Attachments 1 to 3.  They were the items of evidence presented before"
"the High Court in support of the extradition application."
