"sudden fight but only a  sudden attack on the deceased.  The deceased has"
"arrived  at  the  scene  on  his  own  and 
then 
the  1st  Accused-Appellant"

"had  some  prior  enmity  against 
the  deceased  over  an 
incident  after"
"consuming alcohol.  The deceased was heavily intoxicated at this time and"
"the use of the bicycle air pump and repeated blows on the head and face of"
"the deceased clearly negates the possibility of a lesser culpability on a plea"
"of sudden fight."
