"The  High Court confined  the sentence to  10 Counts,  when in fact  it"
"found  the 6th  Appellant guilty  of  more  than 50  Counts,  a  clear  indication"
"that it did not impose the said sentence on mere arithmetical calculation as"
"commented  by  Barton  (supra).  It also  suggests  that  the  High .Court was"
"alive to the proportionality of the sentencing when it confined the sentence"
"to 10 such Counts."
