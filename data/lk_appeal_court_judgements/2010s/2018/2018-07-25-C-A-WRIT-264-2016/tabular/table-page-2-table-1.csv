"Samayawardhena, J."
"The  two  petitioners 
filed  this  application  seeking 
(a)  a  writ  of"
"certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st respondent-Land Reform"
"Commission to execute the deeds in respect of the land depicted in"
"Plan  No.  2023  marked  X11 
in  the  names  of  the  5th  and  6th"
"respondents;  and 
(b)  a  writ  of  mandamus  compelling 
the  1st"
"respondent  to  hold  a  proper 
inquiry  and  execute  the  deed 
in"
"respect  of  the  said  land  in  the  name  of  the  1st  petitioner.    The"
"respondents have filed objections to this application."
"In the first place, in relation to the first relief, no such decision has"
"been tendered by the petitioners for this Court to quash by way of"
"certiorari.  There  has  necessarily 
to  be  a 
formal  decision  or"
"determination before a writ of certiorari could issue quashing that"
"decision or determination.  As that situation has not yet arisen, the"
"application is premature. (Amirthalingam v. Priyasekera1)"
"The  1st  and  2nd  respondents  with  their  objections  have  tendered"
"two documents marked 1R1 and 1R2 to say that full investigation"
"including  field  visit  was  carried  out  with  regard  to  claims  and"
"complaints  of  various  parties  including  those  of  the  1st  petitioner"
"in respect of this land, and the 1st petitioner was even represented"
"by an Attorney-at-Law at the said inquiry.  Notwithstanding the 1st"
"petitioner now says that her lawyer was not given a proper hearing,"
"there is no affidavit from the said lawyer to that effect.  During this"
"inquiry  it  has  inter  alia  been  revealed  that  the  1st  petitioner  is"
"living in another plot of land and also rented out a three-storeyed"
"house apparently put up in a different plot of land-vide paragraph"
"14  of  1R1.  The  petitioners  may  not  agree  with  these  findings  but"
"the correctness of these findings cannot be tested before this Court"
