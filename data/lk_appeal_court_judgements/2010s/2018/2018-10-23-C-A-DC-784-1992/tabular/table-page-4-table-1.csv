"In  any  event,  when  there  is  a  Registered  Attorney  on  record,  a"
"party 
cannot 
appear 
in  person 
and 
tender 
a 
settlement"
"(unknown to the Attorney on record).  Until the proxy is revoked,"
"with the leave of Court, every single act shall necessarily be done"
"through the Registered Attorney."
"Therefore,  even  if  the  purported  written  settlement  is  found  in"
"the case record, there is no validity in it."
"This is a partition action, which cannot summarily be disposed"
"of in that manner."
"The purported order of this court dated 20.09.2010 is manifestly"
"per incuriam."
"In my view, even if there is no formal application, the Court of its"
"the  record  straight  by 
own  accord—ex  mero  motu—can  put"
"invoking  the  inherent  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  the  moment  it"
"realizes that it has  made a mistake.   It  is the duty of each and"
"every  Court  to  see  that  the  parties  shall  not  suffer  by  its  own"
"And  also  the  party 
lapses—Actus  curiae  neminem  gravabit."
"affected  can  in  such  circumstances  apply  to  make  restitution"
"from what is due of right—ex debito justitiae."
"I set aside the order of this Court dated 20.09.2010."
"The appeal of the appellants has not been finally decided."
"The Registrar is directed to call for the original case record from"
"the District Court of Matara forthwith."
