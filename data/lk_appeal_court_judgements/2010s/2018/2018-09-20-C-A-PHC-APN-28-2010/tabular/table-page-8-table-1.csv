"(PHC) 63/2012 - C.A.M. of 13.07.2018, where De Silva J held the view that;"
"""The learned Counsel for  the Appellant submitted that this  Court"
"is  entitled  to  go  into  the  merits  of the  revision  application  filed"
"thereon. 
before 
the  High  Court  of Panadura  and  make  order"
"Having given  my anxious  consideration  to  this  submission  I  am"
"of the  view that legally  it is  not permissible  to  do  so.  The  learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  not  considered  the  merits  of the  revision"
"application  made  by  the  Appellant.  In 
these  circumstances, 
this"
"Court  will  be  usurping  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of the  High"
"Court  by examining the  merits  of the  application  when  the  High"
"Court has  not done  so.  Such a course of action  on  the  part of this"
