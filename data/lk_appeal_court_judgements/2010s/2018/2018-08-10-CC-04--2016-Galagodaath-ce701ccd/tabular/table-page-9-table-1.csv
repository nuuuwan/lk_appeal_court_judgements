"This  Court  is  mindful that it ought to consider the evidence  led  before  it in"
"its totality,  taken  as  a whole.  However,  for convenience  and  for easy"
"future  reference to the  readers of this judgment, this Court would  set out"
"the evidence of several  witnesses  in  the following  manner. This Court for"
"the  purposes  of clarity thinks it fit to state  here,  that by adopting the"
"following  style  of dealing  with  each  witness's evidence,  it did  not intend  by"
"any  means to compartmentalize the evidence  led  before it."
