"","Considering  all  the evidence  in  its totality, this Court has  held  that the"
"","Accused  had  made the utterances (referred  to in  the charges)  in  Court"
"","deliberately,  on  his own volition,  without any permission  either expressed"
"","or implied from  the  Magistrate. There  is  overwhelming  evidence before"
"","this  Court,  which  has  proved  beyond  reasonable doubt that the conduct of"
"","the Accused  before the Magistrate had  been  with the deliberate intention"
"","to  intimidate the  Magistrate in  order to obtain an  order he  had  desired."
"","The  presence  of the Accused  is  not an  accidental  or random  but a"
"","deliberate and  a planned  presence  calculated  to somehow obtain the order"
"","desired  by him,  namely bail  for the suspects.  Accused  had  stood  up  and"
"","addressed  the  Magistrate after the  Magistrate had  refused  to enlarge the"
"","suspects on  bail  and  after the Magistrate had  called  the next case."
"","Both  Senior State Counsel  Mr.  Dileepa  Pieris  and  Mr.  Upul  Kumarapperuma"
"","Attorney at law  had  rushed  back to open  Court to assist the  Magistrate"
"","who  had  been  in  a difficult situation.  It was  then  that the Accused  had"
"","referred  to Mr.  Dileepa  Peiris  as  an  impotent State Counsel  in  abusive"
"","language and  directed  him  to sit thereby depriving the  Magistrate of their"
"","assistance at that difficult moment."
