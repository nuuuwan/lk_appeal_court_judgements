"make preparations for the election of permanent trustees, as the period of"
"the incumbent trustees was elapsed in December, 2014."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order  of  the  Wakfs  Board,  the  Defendant-"
"Appellant-Appellants  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “Appellants”)  filed  an"
"appeal  before 
the  Wakfs  Tribunal. 
In 
their  petition  of  appeal, 
the"
"Appellants  stated  that  after  the  expiry  of  their  period  in  December  2014,"
"they  had  took  all  steps  to  hold  the  meeting  of  the  jamath  in  contribution"
"with  the  Director  of  Muslim  Religious  and  Cultural  Affairs  and  they  had"
"prepared the list of the members of jamath and announced the day for the"
"election  of  trustees  in  the  mosque  to  be  held  on  25.04.2015.  They  further"
"stated that due to the Wakfs Board order dated 23.04.2015, the Respondent"
"above named became a member of the special committee who has to pay a"
"sum  of  Rs.  69,000/-  as  arrears  of  rent  to  the  mosque.  Therefore,  the"
"Appellants 
submitted 
that 
if 
the  Respondent  or  his  nominees  were"
"appointed  as  trustees  to  the  said  mosque,  it  will  have  serious  negative"
"impact  in  the  administration  and  management  of  the  mosque.  And  they"
"were  in  a  position  that  in  any  event,  there  were  no  valid  reasons  for  the"
"appointment  of  special 
trustees  when 
the  Appellants  have 
taken  all"
"necessary steps to hold the election for the selection of trustees. On these"
"main grounds, the Appellants were urged the Wakfs Tribunal to set aside"
"the order of the Wakfs Board."
"It 
is  clear  from  the  entire  proceedings  both 
in  the  Wakfs  Board  and"
"Tribunal, 
the  Appellants  were  not  objected 
to 
the 
formation  of 
the"
"committee  of  selectors  for  the  election  of  trustees;  but  they  were  strongly"
"objected to the nomination of the Respondent."
"In the Wakfs Tribunal, after continuous deadlocks between the parties, on"
"19.03.2016, 
both 
parties 
had 
agreed 
to 
nominate 
five 
persons"
"independently, excluding the Appellants and Respondent and both parties"
