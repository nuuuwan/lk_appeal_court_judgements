"If I may summarize Mr.  Anuruddha Dhramaratne's argument in yet another way,  the"
"learned  Counsel  argued  that  there  must  be  prayers  that  must  plead  the  following"
"namely ""appeal be allowed""  and ""the judgment of the District Court be set aside"".  If"
"these prayers are not inserted in a petition of appeal, such a petition of appeal must be"
"dismissed in limine. The learned President's Counsel countered this by contending that"
"this objection was being raised rather late in the day and such a belated objection was"
"being  put  forward  to  deprive  the  appellants  of  the  merits  of  their  appeal  being"
"investigated by this  Court and in fact  the learned  President's  Counsel invoked  the"
"celebrated words of Sydney Abraham, CJ  in Dulfa Umma et al v.  u.D.e.  Matale 40"
"N.LR. 474 at p.  478:~"
