"chapeau of Section 758(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Has such a demand been made"
"for  a  form  of  relief  in  the  petition  of  appeal?  If so,  is  it  sufficient  for  purposes  of"
"Section 758(1)(f) of the CPC?"
"The form of rellef that has been couched in the petition of appeal goes as follows: /"
"""It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed"""
"Mr.  Gamini Marapana, PC submitted in his forceful reply to the prehminary objection"
"that the precatory words / ""It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed"" is"
"certainly a demand as a demand could well be. A demand could be a precatory plea as"
"above and the draftsman of the provincial bar who formulated the petition of appeal"
"did not commit  a cardinal sin when he  put pen to paper what he  thought he  must"
"demand  of  the  Court  of  Appeal.  But  Mr.  Anuruddha  Dharmaratne  submitted  that"
"there has to be an order in which the rellef must sequentially be demanded from the"
"Court of Appeal namely,"
"1. 
the judgment of the District Court be set aside"
"2.  dismiss the plaintiff's action"
"3. 
any other rellef"
"In the petition of appeal under impugnation, Mr.  Anurudda Dharmaratne submitted"
"that the above order is missing or the absence of prayer (1)  above from the petition of"
"appeal  renders  the  petition  incurably  deficient  and  so  it  must  be  dismissed.  He"
"further  argued  that  the  sentence  ""It  is  respectfully  submitted  that  the  plaintiff's  action  be"
"dismissed""  is  not a demand and additional forms  of rellefs  must have been demanded"
"such as ""the judgment of the District Court be set aside."""
"As  opposed to this contention,  Mr.  Gamini Marapana,  PC  submitted that a demand"
"could be  respectful  and the words ""It  is  respectfully  submitted that  the plaintiff's  action be"
"to  nothing  but  an  unambiguous  form  of  demand  which  duly 
dismissed""  amount"
"complles with Section 758(1)(f) of the Civil Procedure Code."
