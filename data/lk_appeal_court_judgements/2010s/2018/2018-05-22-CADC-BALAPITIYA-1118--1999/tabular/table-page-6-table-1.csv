"Decided on 
05.12.2017"
"A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J."
"A  preliminary  objection  has  been  taken  to  the  maintainability  of  this  appeal.  In  a"
"nutshell the contention of the Plaintiff/Respondent is that the petition of appeal dated"
"09.12.1999 does not contain a prayer for  setting aside the judgment of the court a quo"
"and  therefore  it  is  fatally  flawed.  Mr.  Anuruddha  Dharmaratne  for 
the  Plaintiff/"
"Respondent quite eloquently submitted that it is imperative that the petition of appeal"
"must  contain  a  demand for  relief namely  a  prayer  that the judgment  of the  District"
"Court be set aside.  He submitted that it is only then that the petition of appeal would"
"comply  with  Section  755(3)  and  Section  758(1)(f)  of 
the  Civil  Procedure  Code"
