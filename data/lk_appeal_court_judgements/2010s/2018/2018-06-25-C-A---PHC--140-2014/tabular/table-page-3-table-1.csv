"No  payments were made thereafter by the Appellant. Thereafter names of two Directors of the"
"Appellant,  namely Rajaratnam  Vinothan  and  Anthony  Ruwan  Sanjeewa  had  been  submitted to"
"Court.  Later,  on  an  application  made  on  his  behalf  Anthony  Ruwan  Sanjeewa  had  been"
"discharged."
"Rajaratnam  Vinothan  had  appeared  in  Court for the first time on  24.06.2014 and  was  enlarged"
"on  bail.  The  next date his foreign travel  was  prohibited and,  on  his  application,  he  was  granted"
"time to pay the sum in  default within a period of one year."
"The  Appellant  submits  that  on  17.11.2014 the  lawyers  appearing  for the  Appellant  sought  to"
"make an application that in terms of the Act, the Commissioner of Labour cannot file a certificate"
"in  the  Magistrates  Court  under  section  38(2)  of the  Act  in  the  first  instance  without  having"
"proceeded  under sections  17 and  38(1)  of the Act and  therefore the Magistrates Court did  not"
"have  jurisdiction.  The  Appellant  submits  that  the  learned  Magistrate  indicated  that  the  said"
"objection could  be  entertained but the order will have to be  reserved for another date and  until"
"such time the Director will be remanded."
"The Appellant submits that as  such the lawyers for the Appellant had to refrain from making the"
"said  application  and  were  compelled  to move for a date to  pay  the  instalment although  such"
"payment was not warranted by law. Thereafter, they filed a revision application in the High Court"
"of the  Uva  Province  holden in  Badulla  seeking to dismiss the action filed  by the  Respondent  in"
"the Magistrates Court."
"The  learned  High  Court judge after hearing the Appellant refused  notice and  hence this  appeal"
"by the Appellant."
"The  Appellant  urged  two grounds  before the  High  Court.  Firstly,  it was  submitted  that  before"
"acting in  terms  of section  38(2)  of the Act,  the  Respondent  must act  under sections  17(1)  and"
"38(1)  of the Act and  it is  only thereafter, that steps can  be taken under section  38(2) of the Act."
"Secondly,  it was  submitted  that the  learned  Magistrate did  not have jurisdiction  under section"
"38(2)  of the  Act  to substitute  the  directors  in  place  of the  defaulting  company  named  in  the"
"certificate filed  under section 38(2) of the Act."
