friend  called"
"Wasanthi, 
the  Accused-Appellant

When

to  buy  cigarettes  to  nearby  shop."
"The  girl  was

the 
time  of 
the

"was 
forced  by 
the  Accused-Appellant  which 
resulted 
in  making 
the"
"child  unconscious. 
She  made 
a  prompt  complaint  and 
revealed 
the"
"entire 
incident 
to 
the  Police.  The  mother  also  corroborates 
the"

in  her  evidence."
"The

judge  has  considered  all 
the  evidence  available  before  her"
"and 
given 
reasons 
for 
her 
findings 
in 
length 
and 
found 
the"
"Accused-Appellant  guilty."
"We 
analyzed 
the  evidence 
and 
the 
reason  given  by 
the 
judge 
and"
"we  have  no 
reasons 
to  interfere  with  her  decision."
"Therefore, 
we 
affirm 
the 
decision.  Accordingly  we 
affirm 
the"
"conviction  and 
the  sentence."
"Regarding 
the 
sentence,  we  make 
special  note 
that 
the  Accused"
"Appellant  was 
given 
a 
reasonable 
and  we 
have 
no 
intention 
to"
"interfere  with  the  same."
