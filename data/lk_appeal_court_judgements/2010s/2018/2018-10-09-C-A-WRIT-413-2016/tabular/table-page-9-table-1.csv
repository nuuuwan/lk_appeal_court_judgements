"However,  for the  purpose  of completeness  and  as  the  Petitioner has  referred"
"this  Court to the judgment of the Supreme  Court in  University of Ruhuna  and"
"others vs  Dr.  Dharshana Wickremasinghe4
,  this Court  has  decided to examine"
"the  two  grounds  relied  upon  by  the 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  Petitioner  in"
"support of his argument that the issuing of the charge sheet was illegal."
"In  the  said  case,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that the  charge  sheet  must  be"
"approved  by the Council of the University. The Supreme Court has  held further"
"that the  participation  of the  husband  of the  person  who made the allegations"
"against the  petitioner in  that case,  at meetings of the council  where decisions"
"were  taken  to  initiate disciplinary action  against  the  petitioner,  was  sufficient"
"to raise a suspicion that there was  real  likelihood of bias."
"The  first  ground  urged  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  is  that  the"
"charge  sheet has  not been  approved  by  the  Council  and  therefore, the charge"
"sheet  is  liable to be  quashed.  It would  be  appropriate at this stage to examine"
"the  position  taken  up  by the  Petitioner in  the  petition.  In  paragraph  24  of the"
"st"
"petition,  it is  stated  that,  Ion  2sth  June  2016,  the  Governing  Council  of the  1"
"Respondent had decided to ...  conduct a disciplinary inquiry against her on six"
"th"
"specific  charges'  and  that,  'on  18
July  2016,  the  2nd  Respondent  issued  the"
"charge sheet with six charges'."
"In  paragraph 2S(ii) of the petition, the Petitioner has stated as follows:"
"'it was  revealed at the said  inquiry that:"
"4 SC  Appeal  No.  111/2010 SC  Minutes of 9th  December 2016."
