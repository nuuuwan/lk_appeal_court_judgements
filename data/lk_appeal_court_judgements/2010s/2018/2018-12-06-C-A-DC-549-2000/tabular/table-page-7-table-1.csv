"absence of an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe"
"may not amount to ouster."
"I  cited  those  authorities  to  say  that  even  in  cases  where  there"
"was  strong  evidence  of  long  possession  with  clear  boundaries,"
"the  Courts  have  been  loath  to  transform  such  possession  to"
"prescriptive possession when it is among the co-owners.  But the"
"facts are different in the instant case.  The 3rd defendant in this"
"case did not give evidence on prescription.  He stressed only on"
"the  dismissal  of 
the  plaintiff’s  action 
in 
the  previous  case."
"However,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  3rd  defendant  who"
