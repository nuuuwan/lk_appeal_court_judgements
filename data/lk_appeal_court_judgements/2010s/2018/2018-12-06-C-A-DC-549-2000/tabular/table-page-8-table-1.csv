asis  that,  the  3rd  defendant,  according  to  his  pedigree,  has"
"undivided  rights  to the  land,  and  therefore  the  plaintiff’s  action"
"cannot be maintained.6  In other words, the plaintiff’s action has"
"been dismissed as the plaintiff has failed to prove that he is the"
"sole  owner  of 
the 
land.  The  prescriptive  claim  of 
the  3rd"
"defendant to Lot 1 in Plan No. 709 has been left unanswered on"
"the basis that answering that issue does not arise as the action"
"of the plaintiff is dismissed.7  No party has appealed against that"
"Judgment.  In my view, it is wrong to say that the plaintiff was"
"the  looser  and  the  3rd  defendant  of  the  present  case  was  the"
"winner  in  that  case.    In  my  view,  both  were  losers,  and  the"
"plaintiff, 
in  consequence  of  that  Judgment  rightly 
filed 
this"
"partition action.  Even though the 3rd defendant was not made a"
"party  to  this  case  by  the  plaintiff,  the  3rd  defendant  was  later"
"added  as  a  party  and  filed  a  statement  of  claim  and  actively"
"participated in the trial."
"There  is  no  res  judicata  at  all  as  the  rights  of  the  parties  were"
"not  adjudicated  in  the  earlier  case.  If  I  may  repeat,  what  the"
"learned District Judge stated in the Judgment of the other case"
"was that both the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant have undivided"
"rights to the land.  But unfortunately, the 3rd defendant did not"
"produce  his  Deeds  and  claim  his  undivided 
rights 
in 
the"
"partition  action.    Instead,  he  sought  dismissal  of  the  partition"
"action  on  the  strength  of  the  said  Judgment,  and  also,  in  the"
"alternative, 
claimed 
prescriptive 
rights 
to 
Lot
