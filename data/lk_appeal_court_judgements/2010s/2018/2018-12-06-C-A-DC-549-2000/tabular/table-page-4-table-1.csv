"prepared for the previous case No. 531/L.2"
"The  only  point  stressed  by  the  3rd  defendant  in  his  evidence  in"
"chief  was  that  the  earlier  case  No.  531/L  filed  by  the  plaintiff"
"against  him  was  dismissed  after  the  trial 
(and  therefore  the"
"matter is res judicata)."
"During the cross examination the 3rd defendant admitted that he"
"is 
living  about  Â½  a  kilometer  away 
from 
the 
land 
to  be"
"partitioned.3  He also stated that he has title Deeds to this land.4"
"But such Deeds were never produced.  His standpoint was that"
"he produced the pedigree in the previous case No. 531/L.5  That"
"means,  he  admits  that  he  is  a  co-owner  of  the  land,  but  now"
"claims  title  to  Lot  1  of  the  Preliminary  Plan  on  prescription."
"Nevertheless, he did not give any affirmative evidence on how he"
"prescribed to Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan and when he started"
"prescriptive possession etc."
"Needless to say that proof of prescription is difficult, and proof of"
"prescription  by  one  co-owner  against  the  other  co-owners 
is"
"more difficult."
"When  a  co-owner  claims  prescriptive  possession  against  other"
"co-owners,  proof  of  undisturbed,  uninterrupted,  adverse  or"
"independent  possession 
for  more 
than  10 
years 
explicitly"
"adverted to in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of"
