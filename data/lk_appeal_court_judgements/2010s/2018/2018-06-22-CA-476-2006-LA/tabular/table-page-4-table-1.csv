"However  the  facts  of  the  instant  case  are  totally  different  from"
"those  of  the  above  two  cases.      Unlike  in  those  two  cases,  in  the"
"instant  case,  as  seen 
from 
the  Journal  Entry  No.  66  dated"
"01.06.2004 
and 
the  proceedings 
relevant 
to 
that  date, 
the"
"defendant's 
registered  Attorney  on 
record  has  unambiguously"
"stated  to  the  District  Judge  that  she  does  not  appear 
for  the"
"defendant  as  she  has  no  instructions.    Counsel  for  the  plaintiffs"
"concedes that position."
"Notwithstanding the District Judge has cited the law correctly, she"
"has misapplied the law into the facts of this case.  Therefore I take"
"the  view  that  the  defendant  is  a  defaulting  party  to  whom  section"
"48(4)(a)(iv) is applicable."
"This 
is 
the  only  ground  upon  which 
the  application  of 
the"
"defendant  was  dismissed  after  a  full  inquiry  where  a  number  of"
"witnesses  have  given  evidence  and  a  number  of  documents  have"
"been  marked.    I  must  mention  at  this  stage  that,  if  the  District"
"Judge  wanted  to  dispose  of  the  matter  on  that  ground,  which  is"
"purely  technical  and  needs  no  evidence  to  be  led,  it  could  have"
"been tried as a preliminary question of law before embarking upon"
"a lengthy inquiry."
"Be  that  as  it  may,  at  the  argument  before  this  Court  Counsel  for"
"the defendant candidly admitted that the defaulting party at such"
"inquiry shall, in terms of section 48(c) of the Partition Law, satisfy"
"the Court (a) that he failed to appear at the trial owing to accident,"
"misfortune or other unavoidable cause, and (b) that he had a prima"
"facie right, title or interest to or in the land, and (c) that such right,"
"title  or  interest  has  been  extinguished  or  he  has  been  otherwise"
"prejudicially affected by the Interlocutory Decree."
