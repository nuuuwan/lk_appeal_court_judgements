eed  No.  21703  in  order  to  defeat  the  claim  of  the  5th  and  6th"
"defendants."
"The  2nd  defendant  cannot  approbate  and  reprobate  to  have  the"
"best of both worlds."
"Restitutio  in  integrum  is  a  discretionary  remedy.    A  party  who"
"seeks  a  discretionary  remedy  shall  come  to  Court  with  clean"
"hands.    He  must  also  act  with  promptitude.    The  facts  and"
"circumstances  of  this  case  clearly  militate  against  using  that"
"discretion in favour of the 2nd defendant."
"As Chief Justice Sansoni stated in Cassim v. Government Agent,"
"Batticaloa1  “There  must  be  finality  in  litigation,  even  if  incorrect"
"orders have to go unreversed.”"
"Application of the 2nd defendant is dismissed.  No costs."
