"For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  the"
"respondent  insurer was  not given  notice  in  terms  of Section  105  of"
"the  Motor  Traffic  Act  in  this  instance  though  the  learned  District"
"judge  has  held  otherwise.  Accordingly,  I  allow  all  3  appeals  of the"
"insurance company and set aside the order dated  14.09.1998 of the"
"learned District Judge.  Respondent insurance company is entitled to"
"the costs of this appeal as well."
