"anything  as  to  a  filing  of action.  Furthermore,  the  said  letter  dated"
"30.04.1993 had not been produced in evidence at all.  Therefore,  the"
"Court  could  not  have  considered 
the  contents  of  the  said 
letter"
"without it being marked in evidence at the relevant inquiry."
"Learned  Counsel  for  the  2nd  Defendant-Respondent  referring"
"to 
the  statement  of  objection  dated  09.02.1996  of  the  insurance"
"company  (vide  page  44  of the  brief)  submitted  that the  insurer was"
"aware  of  receiving  a  notice  under  Section  105 
in 
this 
instance."
"Therefore,  he  contended  that  the  insurer  is  estopped  from  stating"
"that it did not receive such a  notice."
"In  paragraph  3(qo) 
in  the  said  objections  referred 
to  by  the"
"learned Counsel and was filed  by the insurance company,  nothing is"
"found as to a  notice under Section  105 but in that it is stated that a"
"letter  demand  dated  15.02.1993  had  been  sent.  However,  the  said"
"letter 
of  demand 
dated 
15.02.1993 
is 
not 
addressed 
to 
the"
"respondent  Insurance  Corporation.  Moreover,  unless  those  matters"
"found 
in  a 
statement  of  objections  were 
led  in  evidence,  no  trial"
"judge  is  in  a  position  to  consider  such  matters  on  his  own  at  an"
"inquiry such as this."
"For the  reasons set out above,  I am not inclined to  accept the"
"submissions that there is evidence available to decide that there had"
"been  notice 
to 
the  insurance  company  under  Section  105  of  the"
"Motor  Traffic  Act 
in 
this 
instance.  Accordingly, 
I  am 
inclined 
to"
"accept 
the  contention  of  the 
learned  President's  Counsel  for 
the"
"appellant."
