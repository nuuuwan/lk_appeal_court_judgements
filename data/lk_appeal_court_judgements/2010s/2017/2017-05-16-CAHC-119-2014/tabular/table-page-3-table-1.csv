"During the course of the argument counsel  for the Accused  Appellant raised  following grounds"
"of Appeal:-"
"(l)The  Learned  High  Court Judge  failed  to consider that the offence  in  the  indictment has  not"
"been  proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  Most of the  evidence  of the  prosecution  reveals  that"
"the sexual  intercourse happened with the consent of the victim who was above 16 years old."
"(2) The  Learned  High  Court Judge failed to take into account the delay on  the part of the victim"
"to make a complaint and failure to give justifiable reason for the said  delay."
"The  prosecutrix  Sriyani  Mangalika  was  living  with  her  mother father  and  younger  sister  in  a"
"village  close  to  Mahiyanganaya  in  the  Badulla  District.  She  had  two  brothers  living separately."
"Her  mother was  not able  to walk  due  to  some  illness/charm.  The  Accused  Appellant  was  got"
"down to cut the said charm.  He  stayed in their house for two days performing rituals. There was"
"a mat in  the room  with the terms for his  work. They had  a living room  and  two other rooms  in"
"their house."
