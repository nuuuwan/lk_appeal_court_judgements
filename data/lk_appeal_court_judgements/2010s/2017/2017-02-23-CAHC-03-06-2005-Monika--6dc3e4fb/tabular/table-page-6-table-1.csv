"exception  for  certain  trials  to  be  taken  up  by  the  High  Court  Judge  before  a  Jury  if the  accused  so"
"desires.  It is this right which was to  be explained to  the  accused by court which was highlighted in the"
"said case."
"Even  though  the  importance  of the  said  requirement  was  highlighted  in  the  said  case,  there  was  no"
"reference made in the said judgment that the said option has to come from  the mouth of the accused."
"The  position in the  present  case  is  quite  different  to  the  above  situation.  The  accused  had  given  their"
"option  to  a  trial  by  a  Judge  without  a jury  when  the  indictments  were  served  on  them  and  the  trial"
"proceeded."
"When  the  re-trial  was  to  be  taken  up,  the  accused  have  charged  their  option  for  a  trial  by  a  Judge"
"before  a jury and  from  the  proceeding placed  before  this  court  it  is  clear  that  the  accused  were  well"
