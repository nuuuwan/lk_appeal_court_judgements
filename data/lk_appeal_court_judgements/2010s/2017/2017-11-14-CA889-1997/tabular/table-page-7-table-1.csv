"The application of the lA plaintiff-appellant-petitioner claims that X2 and X3 are ""vital documents"
"pertaining to the identity of the corpus"". Presumably it is so pleaded as the learned District Judge,"
"in  answering  the  issues,  appears  to  have  concluded  that  the  land  depicted  in  plan  no.  85/7"
"prepared  by C.K.  Baddewela  and  filed  in the case  depicts the land  known  as  kirithanawatte and"
"not pansalewatta  as  claimed in  the plaint. The tenement list marked X3  identifies lot 113 of plan"
"4169 as  pansalewatta. To this extent X2  and X3  may have an  important influence in the case."
"The plaint was filed on the basis that pansalewatta was the property of parilleyya wana aramaya."
"The  plaintiffs prayed  in the alternative for a declaration that the land  more fully described in the"
"pt schedule  to  the  plaint  was  owned  by  Parileyya  Wana  Aramaya  and  that  the  2nd  plaintiff"
"appellant-respondent was  entitled to possess  it.  Clearly their case  is that pansalewatta was the"
"property of parilleyya wana aramaya. The Supreme Court has held that a temple is an  institution,"
