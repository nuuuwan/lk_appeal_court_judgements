"This does not necessarily happen where a  person has failed  to or refused"
"to obey an ordinary,  non-coercive order of Court.  Bertram CJ in the case"
"of  Ismail  vs.  Ismail  said  that  ""non-compliance  with  the  judgment  of  a"
"Court is not, in ordinary circumstances, a  contempt of Court."" Where the"
"order of court is  declaratory i.e.  where  it is  a  decision  merely expressing"
"publicly,  informal  and  explicit  terms,  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the"
"parties  concerned  a  failure  to  abide  by  such  an  order would  not,  in  my"

"contemptuous  tone,  he  certainly  deserved  punishment and  he  rendered"
"himself liable  to  punishment.  But  if  the  Magistrate  called  upon  him  to"
"show  cause  why  the  court  of  law  with  regard  to  cases  where  the  law"
