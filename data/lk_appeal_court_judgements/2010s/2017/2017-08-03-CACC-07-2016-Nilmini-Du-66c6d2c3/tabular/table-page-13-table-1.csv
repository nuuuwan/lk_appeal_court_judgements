"Counsel for the petitioner Mr.  Eraj  de Silva submits as foUows:-"
"With 
respect  My  Lord  we  were  unaware  of  these  sort  of  objections"
"because  my  learned  very  senior  President's  Counsel  said  that  he  will"
"consider  whether  this  evidence  can  be  adopted.  We  didn't  expect  this"
"type  of objection.  But having  being in  the  state of unawareness  on  my"
"learned friend's  own judgments we  can show Your  Lordships' Court that"
"with  greatest 
respect 
there 
is  no 
substance 
to  what 
the 
learned"
"President's Counsel said.  Because my learned President's Counsel in his"
"eloquence 
is  very  very 
selective 
in  what  he  chose 
to 
read 
to  Your"
"Lordships'  Court. 
On  the  submission  first  of the  question  of whether"
"noncompliance  of order of Court will  be  contempt of court  and  whether"
"one  is  to  be  willful  or not  on  my  learned  friend's  own judgments I  say"
