"have at one and the same time two registered attorneys~at~law in a civil suit and I had"
"occasion in Kodagoda Sirisena Serasundara  vs.  Payagala  Gunapala Gunawardena"
"(CA  Case  No 1423/1999F  decided  on  24.06.2016)  to  indulge  in an  analysis  of some"
"precedents  inclusive  of  the  SC  decision  of  Meerasaibo  Mohamed  HanjfEa  and"
"Others  vs.  Athambawa Mohamed Idroos (2015)  Bar  Association  Law  Reports  24"
"which  highlighted  the  distilled  ratio  that  a  court  cannot  recognize  two  registered"
"attorneys for a party in the same cause. Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code clearly"
"enunciates the principle that 'whilst a proxy given to an attorney-at~law is in force or"
"not revoked, it is wrong to file  another proxy in the same case'. There cannot be two"
"registered  attorneys  to  function  at  the  same  time  for  a  party  in  an  action.  This"
"principle  was  also  laid  down  in  the  case  of  Silva  vs.  Cumaratunga  40  N.LR  139"
"where  it was  held  that  a petition  of appeal  must be  signed by the  proctor,  whose"
"proxy is on the record at the date on which the petition is filed."
"The  exception  to  this  rule  would  be  a proxy in favour  of  several  attorneys~at~law"

"however not the situation in this case."
"So  the statement of claim which was filed by the 5th Defendant~Respondent through"
"the different attomey~at~law came into the record in express violation of the aforesaid"
"prohibition against two registered attorneys for  one party and quite contrary to the"
"provisions of Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.  Illegality would thus attach"
"to the statement of claim as a result of its illegal reception and it would stand liable to"
"be rejected in the circumstances. The learned District Judge of Matara could not have"
"acted on this statement of claim which was brought into the record through what I"
"perceive to be a stratagem of the 5th  Respondent who for obvious reasons might have"
"concealed  the  existence  of  an  original  proxy  holder  to  the  second  attorney~at~law"
"whom she engaged to file  the statement of claim.  I would also venture to state that"
"the second attomey~at~law ought to have known that there was already in existence a"
