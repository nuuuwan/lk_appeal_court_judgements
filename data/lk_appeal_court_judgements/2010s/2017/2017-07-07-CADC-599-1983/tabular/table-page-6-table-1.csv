"It is the motion of the Plaintiff~Respondents that seems to have awoken the Petitioners"
"for  re~listing.  In  their  objections  to  the  motion  filed  by  the  Petitioners,  I  find  no"
"explanation as  to why the Petitioners did not revive  their application for  re~listing so"
"soon after no order was made.  Such conduct of want of due diligence is so glaring that"
"one  wonders  whether 
the  Petitioners  would  deserve  any  kind  of  relief  in 
these"
"circumstances. On the facts and circumstances of this case, the decision of the Supreme"
"Court inJabir v.  Karunawathie (200S)  3 Sri.LR  412  becomes  quite pertinent.  In that"

the  Defendant~Appellant  had  died  on  30.01.2000  pending  his  appeal.  As  no"
"application for substitution was made for two years by any interested party in order to"
"proceed with the appeal, the Court of Appeal issued notice on the registered attorney~"
"at~law of the deceased Defendant~Appellant. On being satisfied that the notice had been"
"served,  and as  no  application for  substitution was  made  even  thereafter, the Court of"
"Appeal  made  the  order of abatement.  Accordingly  the Court of Appeal  sent back the"

"deceased  Defendant~ Appellant  to  get  the  order  of  abatement  set  aside  and  to  have"
"herself substituted in the room of the deceased Defendant~Appellant was allowed by the"
"Court  of  Appeal.  The  Plaintiff~ Respondent  appeal  against  the  order  of  the  Court  of"
"Appeal to the Supreme Court. In appeal the Supreme Court set aside the said order and"
