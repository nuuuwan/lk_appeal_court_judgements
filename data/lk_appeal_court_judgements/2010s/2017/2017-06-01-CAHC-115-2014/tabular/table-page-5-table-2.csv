"committed  the  appellant  to  high  court  on 
the  same  charges. 
It  is  evident  that  merely  not"
"marking  the  statutory  statement  of  the  appellant  before  closing 
the  prosecution  had  not"
"caused  any prejudice to the appellant or caused  miscarriage of justice."
"In  the  case  of Elal  Jayantha  Vs  Officer-in-charge,  Police  station  Panadura  1986,  1 SLR  334,  it"
"was  held 
that  ""Although 
the  correct  procedure  had  not  been  followed  yet  no  substantial"
"prejudice had not been caused nor a failure of justice occasioned.  Further four years had elapsed"
"and sending the case back would cause hardship""."
"In  Naval  Kishore  Singh  Vs.  State  of  Bihar  AIR  2004  SC  4421,The  Supreme  Court  of India  held"
"that, ""In  the instant case I 
the appellant had not raised any contention in  the high  court that he"
"was  seriously  prejudiced by the  way in  which  section  313  question  was  done.  Supreme  Court"
"refused  to  consider  plea  especially  when  the  appellant  was  not able  to  show  that he  was  in"
"anyway prejudiced by such irregular procedure""."
"Considering 
the  authorities  mentioned  above, 
it  is  very  clear 
that  the  appellant  had  not"
"suffered  any  prejudice  due  to  non-marking  of  statutory  provisions  during  high  court  trial."
"Further at any event the appellant failed to satisfy court that he was prejudiced by this omission"
"and  thereby caused  a failure of justice  and  the counsel  did  not raise  this  preliminary objection"
"at the outset."
"The  above  mentioned  cases  amply  demonstrated 
the 
fact 
that  neither  the 
rights  of  the"
"appellant nor the omission has occasioned a failure of justice failure of justice."
"Considering all  above I am of the view that there is no  merit in this preliminary objection."
