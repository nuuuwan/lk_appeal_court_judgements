"occupation, the Supreme Court went on  to state in the above judgment as"
"follows;"
""" ...  if the language of the enactment is clear and  unambiguous,  it would"
"not be  legitimate for the Courts to add  words by implication into the"
"language.  It is  a settled  law of interpretation that the words are to be"
"interpreted as they appear in the provision,  simple and  grammatical"
"meaning is to be given to them,  and  nothing can  be added or subtracted."
"The Courts must construe the words as they find  it and  cannot go outside"
"the ambit of the section and speculate as to what the  legislature intended."
"An  interpretation of section  9 which defeats the intent and  purpose for"
"which  it was enacted  should  be  avoided.  "","""
"In the instant case,  it is clear upon consideration of the material adduced"
"before this Court, that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is  in"
"possession or occupation of the said  land  upon any written authority of the"
"state granted in  accordance with any written  law and  that such  authority is"
"in  force and  not revoked  or otherwise  rendered  invalid  as  required  by"
"section  9 of the Act."
"Thus,  this appeal  must necessarily fail."
