"It would  be  helpful to reproduce the following  passage from that judgment"
"which  is  as  follows;"
"""  ....  In my view, the Court of Appeal  fell  into further error when  it held"
"that ""the right or title of the State of the disputed land  is doubtful"""
"The Court of Appeal  had  relied  on the judgement of this court in the case"
"of Senanayake vs.  Damunupola  1982 2 SLR  621.  In the said  case a ""notice"
"to quit"" issued  in  terms of section  3 of the Act had  been  challenged  by way"
"of a writ and  there had  not been  an  order of the Magistrate under section  5"
"of the Act.  In the said  case  it had  been  pOinted out that part of the land"
"covered  by the ""notice to quit"" included  part of the residential  premises of"
"the appellant and the matter however,  had  not reached  the Magistrate's"
"Court.  What was  in  issue was the legality of the administrative action taken"
"by the Government Agent."
"A writ had  been  issued  in the said  case,  quashing the quit notice on  the"
"facts and  circumstances peculiar to the said  case."
"In the present case,  it had  reached  the Magistrates Court and  order for"
"eviction  had  been  issued  and  what is challenged  is the legality of the order"
