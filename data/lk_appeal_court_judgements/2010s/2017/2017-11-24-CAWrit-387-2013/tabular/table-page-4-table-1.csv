"At  this  stage  it is  apposite  to  allude  to  the  factual  matrix  surrounding the  case  in"
"order to understand the legal arguments in its proper perspective. The 5th Respondent"
"workman-P.D.  Janaka  Samantha  had  been  in  the  employ  of  the  Petitioner  freight"
"forwarding company for nearly 12 years until his services were terminated with effect"
"from  14.11.2011  by  a  letter  dated  08.02.2012  marked  as  P2n.  He  had  risen  to  the"
"position  of  Manager  (Operations)  but  a deadlock  seems  to have  developed in 2011"
"when the  5th  Respondent  sought  to  tender his  resignation from  the  company with"
"effect from 01.12.2011, by his letter dated 31.10.2011 (P2a)."
"The Director/CEO of the petitioner-company responded to this letter of resignation"
"by a letter dated 14.11.2011 (P2b) by refusing to accept the resignation of the workman"
"and chronicled a number of serious lapses  on the part of the 5th  Respondent which,"
"the  CEO  alleged,  amounted 
to  a  clear  violation  of 
the 
terms  and  conditions"
"governingthe workman's contract of services.  Some  of the acts of misdemeanor that"
"the letter dated 14.11.2011 complains of are abuse of other employees, loss of revenue,"
"sabotage  of the business  interests  of  the  employer,  engaging in business  with rival"
"companies,  revelation  of  sensitive  information  to  rival  companies  etc.  The  letter"
"further alleged that the 5th  Respondent workman was inducing fellow  employees to"
"cause  a  breach  of  their  employment  contracts  by  exhorting 
them  to 
leave 
the"
"company along with him."
"By a document marked P2( d) of 18.11.2011,  the workman was asked to show cause as"
"to why disciplinary action should not been taken in respect of the allegations which"
"were morefully described mirroring the same as in the letter that refused to accept his"
"letter of resignation. The 5th Respondent responded to the show cause by denying the"
"charges which he called baseless and false.  Moreover, he requested in his response to"
"the show cause that the charges be withdrawn and permission be granted to resign"
"with no impediment to future prospects-vide P2(f)."
"The 
course 
of 
correspondence  between 
the 
employer 
and  workman 
shows"
"unmistakably that even  as  late  as  25.11.2011  when the workman denied the charges"
