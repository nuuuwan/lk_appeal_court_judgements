"Medical  evidence  reveals  that  the  death  of the  deceased  was  due  to  cranio  cerebral"
"injuries due to blunt weapon trauma."
"At  the very  outset  of the  argument  learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor General  conceded"
"the fact that it is not safe to support the conviction of this case."
"Considering  available  circumstantial  evidence  we  are  also  of the  view  that  conviction"
"cannot stand. Therefore we set aside the conviction and the death sentence imposed on"
"the accused  appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle."
