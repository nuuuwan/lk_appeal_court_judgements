"and  interests to himself and  to others,  and  to  reconvey the  property to A.  B died"
"and  his  widow claimed  to hold the  property free  of the trust. A  brought an  action"
"for  a  declaration  of  trust  and 
for  consequential 
relief.  The  Privy  Council  held,"
"affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court, that oral evidence was  admissible to"
"establish the trust; that the formalities for trust were laid  down  by Section  5 of the"
"Trust Ordinance  and  not by Section  2 of the  Prevention  of Frauds  Ordinance,  and"
"the  act  of the widow in  seeking  to ignore the trust and  to retain  the  property for"
"the  estate  was 
to  effectuate  a  fraud;  and 
that  under  Section  5(3)  of the  Trust"
"Ordinance, even  a writing was  unnecessary and  Sections 91 and  92 of the Evidence"
"Ordinance, 
therefore,  had  no  application. 
It  has 
to  be  noted 
that 
this  case"
"establishes  an  important fact.  Sections  91  and  92  of the  Evidence  Ordinance  have"
"no  application  in  a case  governed  by  Section  5(3)  of the  Trust  Ordinance,  which,"
"after laying down the formalities for a trust, declares that the rules would not apply"
"where they would operate so as to effectuate a fraud."
"Other  than  Section  5(3)  of the  Trust  Ordinance  which  has  no  application  to  this"
"case,  there  is  another gateway through  which  vendors  have  in  the  past  sought to"
"establish  trusts through  parol evidence.  This  is  of course  with  recourse  to Chapter"
"IX of the Trust Ordinance."
"In  other  words  even  though  the  Plaintiff  is 
incapable  of using  the  refusal  of the"
"parol promise  in  01 to establish fraud  on  the  part of the 1st  Defendant, the parol is"
"certainly  admissible 
to  establish  a  trust  through  another  gateway  in 
the  Trust"
"Ordinance namely Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance."
"In fact the celebrated jurist l.J. Mark Cooray who authored the seminal work on the"
"Reception  in  Ceylon  0/ the  English  Trust  (1971)15  declared  thus  in  relation  to the"
"chapter on constructive trust/6"
