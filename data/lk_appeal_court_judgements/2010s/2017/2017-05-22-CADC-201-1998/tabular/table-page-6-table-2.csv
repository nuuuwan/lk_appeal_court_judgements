"the parties to an  onerous contract when  he  had  been  overreached  by the other to"
"the extent of more than one half of the value of the subject-matter, as for example,"
"when  a vendor had  not received  half the value  of property sold,  or the purchaser"
"had paid more than double value."
"Pacta sunt servanda (contracts are to be kept)"
"On  the  basis  of my finding  that the  Plaintiff  has  not established  that  he  received"
"less  than  half the  value  of the  property,  the  maxim  IIpacta  sunt servanda ll  which"
"means  IIcontracts  are  to  be  kept""  would  hold  sway  in  this  instance.  It  has  to  be"
"observed  in  passing that when  the  plea  of laesio  enormis fails,  the  maxim  IIpacta"
"sunt servanda ll  would  apply  and  the  Plaintiff would  be  bound  by  the  contract  of"
"sale,  subject  of course  to  any  other  vitiating  factors  or  restitutionary  relief  that"
"might be  pleaded  by the Plaintiff to impugn the transaction.  In  fact laesio enormis"
"also finds its place in English  law under the umbrella rubric of uncoscionability."
"Laesio enormis in the English Law of unconscionability"
"The  English  Law position has been best summed up by John  R.  Peden in  liThe Law of"
"Unjust Contracts"" published by Butterworths in 1982 at pages 28-29;"
