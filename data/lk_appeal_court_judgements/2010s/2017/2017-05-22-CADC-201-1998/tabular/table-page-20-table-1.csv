"an  attendant  circumstance. 
It  would  show  that  the  transferor  did  not  intend  to"
"dispose  of the  beneficial  interest,  although  he  signed  the  deed  of transfer.  If the"
"transferor  has 
improved  the  land  at  his  own  expense  after  having  executed  the"
"deed  of transfer, that will  make  it more  probable that the transferor has  retained"
"the  beneficial  or equitable  title.  But  I must  state that continual  possession  by the"
"transferor may not be  an  attendant circumstance if the transferor becomes a lessee"
"of the transferee  after the deed  of transfer and  proceeds to possess  the  land.  We"
"are  not  unaware  of contemporaneous  leases  that  are  executed  by  transferees  in"
"favour of transferors immediately after the deed  of transfer and  in  such  a situation"
"taken 
into  account  as  an 
the  continual  possession  of the  transferor  cannot  be"
"attendant circumstance,  unless  the transferor-lessee  can  show that such  a lease  is"
"spurious 
as 
no  consideration 
passed 
between 
the  parties.  For  a  combined"
"operation  of a non-notarial  instrument and  continued  possession  of the transferor"
"to establish  a constructive trust-see Thisa Nona and Three Others vs.  Premadascl9"
"and observations thereon by Dissanayake J.  in Carthelis vs.  Ranasinghe. 30"
"As 
I  have  observed  before,  there  is  no  continued  possession  of this  land  by  the"
"plaintiff. The  evidence is that immediately upon transfer, the 1st  Defendant entered"
"into possession  and  he  subsequently parted  with  his  legal  title of some  portions of"
"the  land to the  2nd
,  3rd  and  4th  Defendants.  These  items of evidence go to negative"
"any kind  of beneficial title being retained  by the Plaintiff."
"So  my  decision 
flows 
from 
the 
foregoing. 
It  is  axiomatic  that  such  attendant"
"circumstances or further facts as  are  required  by Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance"
"do  not exist  in this  case  or co-exist  with the  non-notarial  agreement.  I have  found"
"that 
there  was  adequate  price  paid  by 
the  1st  Defendant 
for 
the  purchase."
"Immediately  upon 
transfer, 
the 
transferee 
(the  1st  defendant)  entered 
into"
"possession  and  continued  until  she  parted  her  own  title,  as  was  alleged,  to  the"
"other defendants."
"In the circumstances the original deed of transfer remains an  out and  out sale.  Now"
"that  the  parol  agreement  stands  alone  without  any  attendant  circumstances,  a"
"curious upshot emerges. The parol agreement would be  prohibited by Section 92 of"
"the  Evidence  Ordinance  because  a  constructive  trust  does  not  arise  on  the  facts"
"without further facts  or attendant circumstances  and  if the  original  deed  remains"
"an  outright sale  without a constructive  trust arising on  the facts,  Section  92  of the"
