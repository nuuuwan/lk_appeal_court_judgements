"document  promising  to  retransfer the  land  if the  Plaintiff  returned  the  purchase"
"price  of Rs.5,OOO/- with 72%  interest per annum. This  document does not speak of"
"a loan.  Rather  it is  quite consistent  with the  deed  of transfer which  unequivocally"
"evidences  an  outright sale.  What is the effect of this parol agreement? Can  this  be"
"used 
to  contend 
that  what  took  place  between 
the  parties  was  a  conditional"
"transfer? Or as  the Plaintiff claimed  in  the trial, should this non-notarial document"
"signed  by  the  vendee  (1st  Defendant)  lead  to  creation  of a  constructive  contract"
"within Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance?"
"Evidence  has  been  led  on  both sides to show whether the repayment of Rs.5,OOO/"
"took place or not within two years.  As  I conclude presently, there is  no satisfactory"
"evidence  that  the  Plaintiff  paid  back  the  sum  of  Rs.5,OOO/- with  interest.  Even"
"assuming that the Plaintiff paid  back but the 1st Defendant refused to re-convey the"
"land, 
that  breach  of  01 
(breach  of  parol  agreement)  would  not  have  been"
"actionable  as  01  was  not  a valid  pactum  de  retrovendendo7  or a  contract  with  a"
"condition to re-convey."
"Pactum de Retrovendendo (agreement to resell or reconvey)"
"I  must straightaway dispose  of the  argument for a conditional  transfer.  No  doubt"
"the  condition  is  that  if the  Plaintiff paid  back  Rs.5,OOO/- with  72%  interest within"
"two years  from  1987,  the  1st  Defendant would  retransfer the  land.  Unfortunately"
"for the  Plaintiff,  this  promise  on  the  part  of the  vendee  was  embodied  in  a  non"
"notarial  document 
binding  on 
the  parties. 
If 
the 
(01)  which  would  not  be"
"agreement to  re-convey the  land  were  to  be  binding,  that agreement would  have"
"to be  executed  by way of a notarial conveyance.  It is  laid  down  in  Section  2  of the"
"Prevention of Frauds Ordinance that such  a non-notarial document in  respect of an"
"immovable  property  is  of  no  force  or  avail 
in 
law.  Lascelles  c.J  elucidated  the"

principle in the following passage of Amarasekera vs.  Rajapakse8"
