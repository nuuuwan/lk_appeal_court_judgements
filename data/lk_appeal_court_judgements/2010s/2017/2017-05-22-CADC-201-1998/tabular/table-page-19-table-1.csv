"Prevention of Frauds Ordinance but if such  a promise is available as in this case,  it is"
"an  attendant circumstance  but it will  not give  rise  to a trust without more-see the"
"PC  decision of Saverimuttu vs.  Thangavelautham26 and  the rationale behind  it. On"
"the  utility of a non-notarial  instrument to operate  as  an  attendant circumstance -"

"Where an adequate purchase price has not been paid"
"If the transferor of property did  not receive  adequate  purchase  price  it is  certainly"
"an 
important  attendant  circumstance.  The 
transferor  can  bring 
in 
the  parol"
"agreement  and  show  by  the 
further  fact  of  inadequate  consideration 
that  he"
"reserved  the  right to buy back the  property within  a specific  period  and  therefore"
"did  not  intend  to  part  with  the  beneficial  interest.  In  such  a  situation  the  parol"
"agreement  would  become  quite  relevant  to  raise  the  probability  of the  absolute"
"transfer becoming a constructive trust."
"I have concluded  that the plea  of laesio enormis raised  by the Plaintiff must fail  for"
"the  reasons  stated  in  the  anterior  part  of this  judgment.  The  Plaintiff  could  not"
"establish by evidence that the 1st  Defendant paid  him less than the true value ofthe"
"land. In the circumstance this attendant circumstance was not established."
"Was interest paid by the transferor to the transferee?"
"If interest is  payable to the transferee by the transferor and  it is  paid  as  promised,"
