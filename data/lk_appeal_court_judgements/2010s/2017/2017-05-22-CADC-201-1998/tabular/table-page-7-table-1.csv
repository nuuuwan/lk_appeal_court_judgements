"The  above  passage  shows  how pacta sunt servanda  (agreements  must  be  kept)"
"must be given effect to in law subject to the power of courts to vitiate a contract or"
"transaction  on  the  grounds  of exemptions  such  as  laesio  enormis,  fraud,  duress,"
"undue  influence,  illegality  and  existence  of fiduciary  obligations  such  as  a trust."
"Unconscionability  would  lie  at  the  root  of  a  suit  to  vitiate  a transaction  and  an"

the  ground  of 
laesio  enormis."
"Another  ground  smacking  of unconscionability  which  was  alleged  in  the  plaint to"

"alleged  by 
the  Plaintiff. 
In

I  would  also  discuss 
the  question  of"
"conditional transfers that was  raised  by Counsel  before the learned District Judge."
