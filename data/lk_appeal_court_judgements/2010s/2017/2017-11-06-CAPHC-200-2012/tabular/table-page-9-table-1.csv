"Despite the  undertaking by the learned counsel  for the Respondent to file"
"written submission  in  this Court by 2017-09-22, the said  undertaking was"
"observed  in  the breach.  Thus,  this Court has  no  alternative but to conclude"
"that the Respondent has  no ground to be  placed  before this Court on  his"
"behalf,  for its consideration.  Therefore,  this Court has  to proceed on  the"
"basis that there indeed  exists not a single ground in  favour of the"
"Respondent.  Resultant position  would  be  for this Court to conclude that it"
"should allow this appeal."
"If this  court does  not set  aside,  the judgment of the  Provincial  High  Court"
"issuing  a writ of Certiorari  referred  to above  (which  issuance  is  illegal),  all"
"what this court does would be facilitating the continuance of an illegal activity"
