the  Attorney  At  Law  who  appeared  for  him  or  any  other"
"similar evidence to  substantiate the ligation.  The file of record maintained in"

"Ordinance  provides  that  the  judicial  and  official  acts  have  been  regularly"
"performed.  Therefore, without adequate proof, the  file  of record maintained"
"in Court cannot be disproved.  Under these circumstances, the allegation that"
"the  mitigation  was

incorrectly 
is  not  acceptable.  There 
is  no"

the  case  of  Urban"
