"d.","Section  78  (1),  which  reads, 
""No  person  shall  receive  more 
than  one  pension"
"","payable under this  law."" And Section  78 (2)  which reads  ""Where a person becomes"
"","entitled  to  more  than  one  pension  under  this  law  such  person  shall  elect  which"

"","Para  18"
"","Thus  it  can  be  observed  that  the  limitation  on  a  person  to  draw  more  than  one"
"","pension  under  the  Parliamentary  Pensions  Law  was 
in traduced  along  with 
the"
"","provisions 
that  extended  the  pensions 
to  widows,  evincing 
the  clear  legislative"
"","intent to ensure that a person  could not draw his or her pension as  well the pension"
"","of his or her deceased spouse."
"","Para  19"
"","It  is  very important to  note that at the time  the above amendment was  brought in"
"","1982,  Parliamentarians  were  not  entitled  to  pensions  for  holding  offices  under"
"","different  capacities.  In  other  words  a  person  could become  entitled  to  more  than"
"","one  pension  only  if  that  person  was  directly  entitled  and  was  entitled  as 
the"
"","surviving spouse of the deceased member."
"","Para 20"
"","(1) 
It 
is 
therefore  unequivocally  clear 
that

"","entitlement to  more  than  one  pension  referred  to  the direct  pension  and widow's"
