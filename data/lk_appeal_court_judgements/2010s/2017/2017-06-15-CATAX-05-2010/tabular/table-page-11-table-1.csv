"embrace matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions"
"are construed most strongly against the State and in favour of the citizen."
"(Emphasis added)"
"Thus that the provisions of the Value Added Tax Act cannot be construed to impose"
"the  tax  claimed  in  this  case  is  patently  clear.  Particularly  since  the  Constitution"
"clearly  lays  down  in  Article  148  that  a  tax  can  only  be  imposed  by  or  under  the"
"authority of a law passed by Parliament.  The  Value  Added Tax Act  No.  14  of 2002"
"only authorizes the collection of a tax described as Value Added Tax. It certainly does"
"not authorize or permit the collection of any tax described as  the 'Economic Service"
"Charge'.  Hence this Court endorses the view  that the provisions of the Value Added"
"Tax Act are irrelevant to this case."
"Value  Added Tax is  collected based  on  'taxable supply'  (as  opposed to  'turnover'),"
"whereas  Economic  Service  Charge under  the  Finance Act  No.  11  of 2004  is  charged"
"based  on  'turnover'-more  specifically  'liable  turnover'  as  defined  in  Section  2(3)  of"
"thee said Finance Act  No.  11  of 2004.  The word 'turnover' is not found anywhere in"
