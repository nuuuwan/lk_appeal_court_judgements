"Therefore, upon a careful reading of the provisions of Article 148  read together with"
"Section 2(1)  of  the  Finance  Act  No.  11  of  2004,  it  is  abundantly clear  that  the  tax"
"described as the 'Economic Service Charge' can be charged or collected or claimed (for"
"the years of assessment relevant to this case) only in terms of the Finance Act No.n of"
"2004. This argument of the Appellant has to be accepted because an argument which"
"appeals to reason and logic cannot be gainsaid."
"In  the  circumstances  any  attempt  by  the  Respondent  to  claim,  charge  or  collect"
"Economic Service Charge relying on the provisions of any other Act, particularly the"
"Value Added Tax Act, is misconceived in fact and in law. We incline ourselves to this"
"argument."
"It is a well~established rule that the subject is not to be taxed without clear words for"
"that purpose.  (Vide:  the  case  In  Re MickJethwair cited in INCOME TAX  IN SRI"
"lANKA by E.  GOONERA TNE, 2nd  ed., 2009~p.553)"
"It has been stated that the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the statute"
"unambiguously impose the tax on him ~Lord Simond, in Russel v.  Scott? Similarly, it"
"has been stated that a subject is only to be taxed on clear words, not on intendment"
"or on the equity of the Act~ Lord Wilberforce in  W  T.  Ramsay Ltd, v.  CIR.4"
