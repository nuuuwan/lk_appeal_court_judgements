"writ jurisdiction of our courts with a view of quashing a Section  2"
"notice."
"In  the  present  case  also  only  the  section  2  notice  has  been  issued  and"
"therefore this application is premature.  The learned Counsel's submission"
"that  he  can  proceed  with  the  application  for  writ  of prohibition  is  not"
"acceptable.  The  section  2 notice  is  issued  to  ascertain  the  suitability  of"
"the  land  for  the  intended purpose  and  the  party will  have  an  opportunity"
"to  present his  case  before  the  authorities  prior to  making  the  acquisition"
"order."
