"According  to  the  evidence  it  does  not  show  that  this  case  comes  under  any  of the  exceptions."
"Therefor the  learned  trial judge  has  rejected  the  Defence  case  and  held  that the  appellants  are"
"guilty of the offence of murder."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  neither  in  his  submissions  before  court  and  nor  in  his"
"written  submissions  has  raised  any  specific  grounds  of  appeal,  other  than  quoting  various"
"portions  from  the judgment in  his  written  submissions.  His  main  contention  is  that  the  learned"
"trial judge  has  erred  both  in  facts  and  law  with  regard  to  the  applicability  of the  exception  of"
"grave and sudden provocation."
