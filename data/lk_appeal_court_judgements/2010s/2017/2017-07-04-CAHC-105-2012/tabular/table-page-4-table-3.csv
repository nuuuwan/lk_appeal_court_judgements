"The  counsel  for  the  appellant  cited  following  cases  and  submitted  that  corroboration  must"

"Reference  is  made  in  this case  to Keuneman  J's  dictum in  41  NlR 367 which  states:  ""In"
"the language of Lord Hewart CJ  IN  Rex Vs  Lowell,  such complaints are  'not evidence of"
"the facts  complained of' but are  merely 'matters which may be taken into account.. ..  in"
"considering the consistency and therefore the credibility of the story' ... but in  the case of"
"an  accomplice the rule of practice requires something more than the mere testing of his"
"story ............ it is  therefore necessary that the Magistrate should have clearly before his"
"mind that he is  dealing  with  the evidence of an  accomplice and he must give  clear and"
"satisfactory reasons for convincing in  the absence of corroboration""."
