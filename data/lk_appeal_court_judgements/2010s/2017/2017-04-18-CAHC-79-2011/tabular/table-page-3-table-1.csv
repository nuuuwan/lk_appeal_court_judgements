"The  prosecution  relied  on  the evidence of a neighbour Kapila  Jayawardena  (PW1).  He testified"
"the  02.03.2005  evening,  as  the  deceased  was  not  seen  around,  he  has  visited  her 
that,  on"
"house  with few villagers  including Thushari  and  Niroshana.  He  had  noticed that both the front"
"and  the rear doors were locked  (one door was  padlocked from outside). Also  observed that the"
"house was  not been  broken  into and  the windows were closed. Then  he  had  peeped  inside the"
"house,  through  the gap  between  the wall  and  the  roof,  he  had  seen  partly washed  rice,  some"
"plantains  and  canes 
in  one  room.  After  removing  the  polytheen  ceiling,  he  had  seen 
the"
"deceased hanging from the roof."
"After arrival  of the police  he  had  entered  the house and  found the deceased  hanging from the"
"rafter  with  a  rope  that  was  made  of synthetic  material  (tangus).  The  bed  and  the  chair  were"
"seen  about four feet away from her. The  cloths line which  was  normally fixed  in  the compound"
"was  found  cut.  Thereafter  has  made  a statement  to  the  police.  He  has  identified  the  clothes"
"worn  by  the  deceased  and 
the  tangus  rope  at  trial.  The  defence  was  unable  to  mark  any"
"contradiction in  his cross examination and  he was consistent."
"According  to  Gamini  Attanayake(PW2}  the  deceased  was 
living 
about  200m  away  from  his"
"house  and  the  Appellant  lived  at 
the  adjoining  land.  On  the 02.03.2005  around  4.30-5  in  the"
"morning,  this  witness  had  heard  a  noise  coming  from  the  house  of the  deceased  (known  as"
"Mirisarawe Gedera}.lt was  sound  like squeezing of a trapped  wild  boar which  was  followed  by"
"cries  ""Nilame  mawa  Maranawo"".He  had  identified  it to  be  a female  voice  and  the  cries  have"
"lasted for about 15 minutes. He  has  heard the person screaming utterances about 4 to 5 times."
"He  had  also  testified  that the  Accused  appellant  was  called  by  that  name.  After  hearing  that"
"voice,  he had  never seen the deceased"
"Around  7.30  am  as  the fellow villagers  refused  to accompany  him,  he  has  gone  on  his  own  to"
"the compound  of the deceased  and  has found the clothes  line been  cut with the two ends still"
"tied  to the  poles.  This  witness  has  revealed  about the previous  enmity between  the Deceased"
"and the Appellant, also many instances that the  Appellant tried to harm her.  He  had  identified"
"that the remaining parts of clothes line were similar to the rope that has been  used for hanging."
"This  witness  confirmed that the two doors were locked  and  one door padlocked  from outside."
"On  that day it self this witness had  informed  about the cries of the deceased  to the inmates of"
"Thushari's house who had  been  closely associating the Deceased.  It is  observed that though he"
"was  delayed  in  making  a statement to the police,  he  had  given  evidence  at the  inquest which"
"was  held  on  the following day of the incident. In  explaining the delay in  making the statement,"
"the  witness  has  said  that  he  went to the  police  on  several  occasions  but asked  to come  later"
"and  further  mentioned  that  he  was  involved  in  agricultural  work  and  that too  contributed  to"
"the  delay.  He  further said  that  he  had  a fear  in  coming forward  to give  evidence  in  a murder"
"case."
"Kusuma  (PW3),  a neighbour of the  deceased  who  associated  the  deceased  closely,  has  stated"
