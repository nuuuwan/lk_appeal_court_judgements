"Further it has  been also  observed by the  learned District Judge  that there  has"
"not  been a  separate  claim  by  the  5th  defendant  for  the  exclusion  of lot E  as  such  it"
"was  held that the Defendant-Appellants has  failed  to  prove that they are  co-owners"
"of the land sought to be  partitioned  and  more  so 
that they  had possession 
to 
the"
"same."
"For the reasons  stated above 
the learned  District Judge was of the view  that"
"it was  only the plaintiff has proved possession  and 
therefore 
the  plaintiff  should"
"be entitled  to 
the  plantation  as claimed  by him  before  the  surveyor."
"It  is  also 
contended  by 
the 
Defendant-Appellants, 
that  although 
it 
is"
"incumbent  and  the  duty  is  cast  upon  the  Trial  Judge  to  investigate  the  title  of the"
"parties,  the  learned  Trial  Judge  had  failed  to  do  so  ,  and  thereby  had  arrived  at  a"
"erroneous decision."
"It  is 
intensely 
relevant 
to  note 
that 
the  Defendant-Appellants  are  claiming  an"
"exclusion of lot D from  the  corpus as  it  forms  a part of a different land. 
It is  being"
"observed by this Court that 
the  learned District Judge has analyzed the facts  placed"
"by the  Defendant-Appellants  and arrived at  the  irresistible conclusion that the 
said"
"Lot D  is  a part  of  the  corpus  and had rejected 
the  Defendant-Appellants position"
