"The  defendants rely on  the decisions in  Brampy Appuhamy v.  Mendis Appuhamy2 and  W.  Uberis"
"v.  M. W.  Jayawardene3  to argue that where the surveyor dOing the preliminary survey is  unable"
"to locate the full  extent of the  land  described  in  the  plaint,  he  should  report that fact to court"
"and seek its further directions. In  Brampy Appuhamy the surveyor surveyed a land of which two"
"boundaries did not tally with the description of the land given in the schedule to the commission."
"It is  in  this context that court held that the surveyor has  not duly executed  his  commission  and"
"went on to state that where the surveyor is  unable to locate the land  he must report that fact to"
"court and ask for its further directions. In Uberis also it is clear that the surveyor had not surveyed"
"the corpus correctly as  there was  a discrepancy in  one  of the  boundaries set out in  commission"
"and  what was  identified in  the survey report.  Furthermore, and  more importantly the surveyor"
"had  in  his  report stated  that the  11th  defendant had  informed  him that he  had  surveyed  only a"
"portion of the land but he did so as the plaintiff stated and requested him to survey only a portion"
