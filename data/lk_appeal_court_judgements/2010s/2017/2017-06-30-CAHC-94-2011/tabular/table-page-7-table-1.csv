"The appellant never mentioned that he was going to hand over the vehicle to any other person"
"and further he did not mention about his return trip."
"Therefore it is evidentially proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, the actus reus of"
"the alleged offence. The prosecution had also proven the knowledge of the appellant of the"
"existence of ammunition in the vehicle. Therefore the prosecution has amply demonstrated that"
"the accused was transporting and possessing ammunition with knowledge. (As decided in the"
"case of Talasingham Vs Muttiah 39 NLR 140)"
