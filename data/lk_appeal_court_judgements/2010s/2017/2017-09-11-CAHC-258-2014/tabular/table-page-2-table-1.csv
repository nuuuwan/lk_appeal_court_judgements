"","Judgment"
"","S.Thurairaja  PC J"
"","The  accused  appellant  preferred  an  appeal  against  a  conviction  against  him  under"
"5","Section  364(1)  of  the  Penal  Code  by 
the  High  Court  judge  of  Hambantota.  The"
"","appeal was preferred on  the  16th  of December 2014 at the  High  Court of Hambantota"
"","and  the  matter  is  referred  to  the  Court  of Appeal  and 
listed  for  argument  in  2015."
"","Time  to  time  the  matter  was  taken  up  for  argument  and  postponed  for  the  3rd  of"
"","August 2017.  On  the  1st  November 2016,  the accused  appellant was  represented  by"
"10","a counsel  and  took the  3rd  August 2017  as  a convenient date.  On  the  said  date,  the"
"","accused  appellant  was  absent  and  unrepresented.  Since 
this 
is  one  of  the  old"
"","matters  the  court  called  this  case  and  called  the  names  of accused  name  and  his"
"","counsel.  Since they were  absent the  court proceeded  to  act  under Section  349(3)  of"
"","the Code of Criminal  Procedure Act No.  15 of 1979 as amended."
"15","The  Honourable  Attorney  General  had  preferred  an  indictment  against the  accused"
"","appellant  under Section  364(1)  of the  Penal  Code for committing  an  offence  of rape"
"","of one  Babyhamy  Ratnayake.  The  incident alleged  to  have  happened  on  the  18th  of"
"","July 2013."
"","For the  purposes  of completeness,  it  will  be  appropriate  to  mention  the  facts  of the"
"20","case  briefly.  The  prosecutrix who was  a 61year old  widow lodged  a complaint at the"
"","police  station  of Angunakolapelassa  on  19th  July  2003  stating  that  it  was  the  late"
"","evening  of the  previous  day the  one  Padanangala  Gedara  Bandara  attacked  her by"
"","hitting  her head  on  the floor for 4 times  removed  her cloths and  forcefully had  sexual"
"","intercourse  with  her.  Since  the  police  station  was  far  away  she  reached  the  police"
"25","station on the following  day morning and was  hospitalised for 8 days."
"","The  trial  was  taken  up  on  the  24th  April  2011  and  concluded  on  the  10th  December"
"","2014."
"","Since  the  accused  appellant  or  his  counsel  was  not  present  before  this  court  we"
"","carefully  considered 
the  evidence 
led  at  the 
trial, 
the  submissions  made  by 
the"
"30","counsels at the High  Court, judgment of the  High  Court and the  petition  of appeal."
"","There  were  three  contradictions  marked  at  the  High  Court  and 
the  appellant  had"
"","taken  up 
the  defence  of  alibi  while  giving  evidence  were 
the  major  grounds  of"
"","appeal.  We went through  the  evidence  led  before  the  court  and  the judgment of the"
"","High  Court judge.  The  learned  trial judge  had  reasonably and  sufficiently considered"
"35","the contradictions marked and  gave his decision on  the contradictions"
"","When  we  considered 
the  evidence 
led  before 
the  High  Court  we 
find 
that 
the"
"","defence  had  taken  up  different  types  of defence  time  to  time. 
Initially  the  accused"
"","suggested  to the  prosecutrix that her injury was  due to  knock down  by a motor cycle"
"","and  falling  down.  Considering  the  evidence  of the  prosecutrix,  her  daughter,  police"
"40","officer  and 
the  Judicial  Medical  Officer 
(JMO) 
that 
the 
injuries 
found 
on 
the"
"","prosecutrix were compatible with  the history given  by the prosecutrix and  it is  not just"
"","a  knock  down  and  falling.  The  next  defence  was  taken  as  wrong 
identity, 
it  is  on"
