"and circumstances of each  case"".  Counsel  for the appellant attempt to convince  court that the"
"appellant was  falsely  implicated  but in  this  instant case,  prosecution  has  amply demonstrated"
"that it was not a false allegation."
"Further,  an  Indian  Supreme  Court case  Banti  Vs  State of Madhya  Pradesh  (2004)  1 see 414,  it"
"was  held that ""It is  true  the evidence of the  defence  witness is not to be ignored by the courts."
"Like  any other witness,  his evidence has  to be  tested on  the  touchstone of reliability,  credibility"
"and trustworthiness,  particularly when he attempts to resile from  and speak against records and"
"in  derogation  of his  earlier  conduct  and  behaviour.  If after doing  so, 
the  Court  finds  it  to  be"
"untruthful;  there  is  no  legal  bar in  deserting  it"",  but  when  perusing judgement  of the  instant"
"case, 
it  is  evident  that  the  learned  high  court  judge  has  adequately  considered  the  defence"
"evidence and  he had not ignored the same as submitted by the counsel for the appellant."
