is 
that 
there

"","refers  to  the  habitual  drinking  of the  Appellant and  therefore,  this  court"
"","is  not  inclined  to  consider  the  degree  of voluntary  intoxication  of the"

"","and the neighbor of the deceased."
"","We  observe  that  the  dying  declaration  of  the  deceased  had  not  been"

in 
the  High  Court.  The  main 
investigating  officer  who"
"","arrested  the Appellant  had  observed burn injuries  on  the  right-hand  and"
"","on  the  forehead  of the  Appellant.  The  Appellant  had  failed  to  explain"
