"The  section  68  (2)  of the  Primary  Court  Procedure  Act  provides"
"that  when  an  order  pronounced  by  the  Primary  Court  on  a  land  dispute"
"under section 68  (1) of the Act, he is entitled to the possession of the land"
"or  the  part  in  the  manner  specified  in  such  order  until  such  person  or"
"persons  are  evicted  there  from  under  an  order  or  decree  of a  competent"
"Court.  In  the  same  way  if the  dispute  relates to  a right and the  order was"
"delivered under section 69  (1),  section 69(2) provides that such person is"
"entitled to  such right until such person  is  deprived of such right by virtue"
"of an order or decree of a competent Court."
