"like  to  state  here 
that  Court, 
in  cases  of rape,  as  a  rule  of prudence"
"normally  looks  for  corroboration  of her testimony  in  order to  satisfy  its"
"conscience that she is telling the truth. '"
"E.  R.  S.  R.  Coomaraswamy,  in  his  treatise,  The  Law  of Evidence,  Volume  II,"
"Book  2,  p  625  argues  that  corroboration  is  needed  'where  a  witness  is  neither"
"wholly 
reliable  nor  wholly  unreliable' 
and 
is 
required 
in 
three 
sets  of"
"circumstances:  (i)  Where 
it 
is  expressly  required  by  statue,  (ii)  By  rule  of"
"practice 
(developed  by 
the  Courts),  and 
(iii)  Sometimes  on 
the 
facts  and"
"circumstances of the particular case."
