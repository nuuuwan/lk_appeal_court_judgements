"32"
"person  suspected  or accused of being concerned  in  committing or having"
"committed an  offence punishable with death or life imprisonment. This is"
"because the offence of murder is an  offence  punishable with death  under"
"section  296 of the Penal  Code."
"Thus,  it would  be  incumbent upon the  learned  Magistrate to decide after"
"considering the  report of the inquirer and  other material  before him,"
"whether the suspect can  be categorized  as a person  suspected of being"
"concerned  in  committing or having committed an offence of murder.  It"
"would  be this decision that would  determine whether he should enlarge"
"the Suspect Respondent on  bail."
"Therefore the role of the Magistrate at this pOint,  would  be to ascertain"
"whether the Suspect Respondent could  be  reasonably suspected  or"
"accused  of being  concerned  in  committing  or having  committed,  an"
"offence punishable with death or with  life imprisonment.  If the Suspect"
"Respondent falls  under this category he shall  not be  released  on  bail"
"except by a judge of the High Court."
"It would  be  useful  at this stage also for  learned  Magistrate to bear in  mind"
"that his role  is only to ascertain  whether there is a reasonable suspicion"
