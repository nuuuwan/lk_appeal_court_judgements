"verdict of the inquirer changed  into a verdict the petitioners in  those cases"
"would  have preferred to. Thus,  in  the light of those facts, the judgment in"
"that case is quite justifiable,  understandable and  perfectly in  accordance"
"with law.  Further this Court in similar circumstances would also  have done"
"the same."
"Therefore, this court is  in  full  agreement with the judgment of that case"
"and  hence by no means is attempting to deviate from the principle that a"
"verdict returned  at the inquest of proceedings cannot be challenged  in  a"
"revision  application.  Further it must be borne in  mind  that the inquirer"
"conducting an  inquest performs more an  administrative function thus his"
"decision  in  an  inquest proceedings is a decision  made in  the course of"
"such  function and  not a judicial decision  made by a Magistrate."
