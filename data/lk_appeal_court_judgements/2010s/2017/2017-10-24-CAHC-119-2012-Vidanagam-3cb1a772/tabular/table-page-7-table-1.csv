"prosecution  has  failed  to  call  the  inquiring  officer  to  give  evidence.  His"
"contention 
is 
that  the  officer  who  was  called 
is  not  the  chief  inquiring"
"officer.  The retired police officer Fernando was called as witness and he did"
"the  preliminary 
investigations, 
the  officers  who  recorded 
the  statements"
"were  also  called  as  witness.  The  Appellant  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of"
"another  case  by  another  police  station  and  was  produced  for 
this  case"
"through the prison. Under these circumstances the chief investigation officer"
"is 
the 
retired  officer  Fernando.  Therefore 
the  argument 
that 
the  chief"
"inquiring officer was not called, fails."
