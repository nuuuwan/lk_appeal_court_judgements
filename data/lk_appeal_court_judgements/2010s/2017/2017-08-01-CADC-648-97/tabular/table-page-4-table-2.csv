"The  main  point of contention  ~n this  case  is,  as  reflected  by  issue  No.4, whether"
"the  transferor of Deed bearing No.  733  dated  18.10.1979  one A.M.  de  Alwis,  had"
"the  proper  mental  capacity  to  execute  the  said  deed.  The  Appellants  contend  that"
"the  transferor  did  not  have  the  required  mental  capacity  to  execute  the  said  deed"
"and as such that the said deed is void."
"Upon  conclusion  of the  trial  the  leaned  District  Court  Judge  answered  the  above"
"issue  affirmatively,  and  found  that the  said transferor was  mentally  fit  at  the  time"
"of executing the said deed."
