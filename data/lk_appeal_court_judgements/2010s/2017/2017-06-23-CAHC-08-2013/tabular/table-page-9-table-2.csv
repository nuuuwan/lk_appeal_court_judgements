"juncture we do not wish  to amend the charge to attempted rape  punishable under section  364"
"read  with  section  490  of  the  Penal  Code.  Since

"intent  to 
interfere  with 
the  order  of  the

"amendment. After considering above  mentioned judgements, It is  being observed  by this court"
"that 
the  gravity  of  the  offence  was  not  considered  by 
the

"Considering  all  above,  we  are  of  the  view  that  the  sentence 
is

illegal."
"Therefore  we  set  aside  the  sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  and  thereby"
"enhance the sentence by imposing following sentences to run concurrently."
