"One  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  was 
that  the  dock  statement  was  not  considered."
"When  analysing  the dock statement carefully he  had  said  that he  didn't travel  in  that"
"van  on 
the  day  of  the 
incident.  This 
is  proven 
to  be 
incorrect  by 
the  virtual"
"complainant,  driver  of  the  van  Ruwan  and  Sugath.  He  had  never  suggested 
this"
"stance to any of the prosecution witness.  It appears  it is  the  pt time he had  taken the"
"defence of alibi after almost 8 years  of the incident namely 25/01/2012."
"The  appellant,

"Police  Station  Nuwara-Eliya.  He  was  not  involved  in  any  of the  investigation  in  this"
"case.  He  only spoke  to the  fact  that the  victim  child  made  a statement to  police  on"
"25/12/2006, almost 2 V2  years after the incident. The  Counsel  also  moved to mark the"
"statement made by the witness as  V2."
"Considering  the  ground  of appeal  that  the  complaint  was  belated,  the  prosecution"
"evidence  before  the  court  reveals  that  the  mother  of the  victim  had  lodged  the  1 st"
