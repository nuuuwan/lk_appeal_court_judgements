"to  section  33  (1)  (c).  It must  be  observed  that the  legislature  again  in  its"
"wisdom  has  not  opted 
to  use  a  bear 
term 
'profits' 27 
in 
the  proviso 
to"
"section  33  (1) (c).  The  term  it has  used  is 'the profits on  which  the taxable"
"income of such corporation  is computed'. Thus,  the legislature has qualified"
"the term 'profits' in the proviso of section  33  (1) (c)."
"This  too shows that what the  legislature  has  meant by  the term 'profits' in"
"the  main  body  of  section  33 
(1)  (c) 
is  not  what  it  meant  by  the  term"
"'taxable income' referred to in  section  33  (1) (a)."
"Further 
it 
is 
important 
to  note 
that 
the 
term 
'profits'  has  also  been"
"specifically  defined 
in 
the  Act.  To  start  with,  section  3  of  the  Act  has"
"specified 
the  meanings 
that  should  be  given 
to  the 
terms  ""profits  and"
"income"" or ""profits"" or ""income"" for  the  purposes  of the  Act.  Section  163"
"then  goes  on  to  state  that ""profits"" or  ""income"" means  the  net  profits  or"
"income  from  any  source  for  any  period  calculated  in  accordance  with  the"
"provisions  of this  Act.  Further,  chapter  IV of the  Act  has  extenSively  dealt"
"with  the  question  as  how  one  should  ascertain  profits  or  income.  In  that"
"chapter  sections  23  and  24  have  elaborately  dealt  respectively  with  the"
"questions  as  to  what  deductions  are  allowed  and  what deductions  are  not"
"27 As in the main body of section 33 (1) (c)."
