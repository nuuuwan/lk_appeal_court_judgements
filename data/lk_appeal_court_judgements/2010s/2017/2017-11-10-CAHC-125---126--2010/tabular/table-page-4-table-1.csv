"accused  persons.  The  house  was  described  as  a tiny  house with  only one  door and  one"
"room divided into to two. The  front door had  only a thin curtain."
"The 
3rd 
accused 
gave  evidence  under  oaths  and  described 
the  house  and 
the"
"that 
this 
is  a  shanty  dwelling  and  he  had  come 
there  on  a 
environment.  He  says"
"relocation 
programme.  He 
is  working 
as 
a  garbage 
collector  at 
the  Colombo"
"Municipality (CMC)  and  as  a  part time  plumber.  He  says  this  area  has  more  than  2400"
"houses  and  thickly  populated  with  a lot of nefarious  activities  around.  This  description"
"seems  more  plausible 
than 
the 
Investigating  Officer's  evidence. 
It 
is  questionable"
"whether 
the  police  can  enter 
this  area 
in  uniform 
is  something 
the  court  should"
"consider.  The  only  witness  could  not  give  adequate 
information  about  the  scene  of"
"crime.  This  definitely affects the rights of the accused."
"The  3rd  and  4th  accused  persons  had  been  standing  outside  the  house.  Other than  the"
"fact  the  3rd  accused  is  the  owner of the  house  how  can  they connect  both  the  accused"
"to the  incident that  had  happened  inside  the  house  is  a question  the  prosecution  must"
"explain and the trial judge should have considered."
"When they entered the house the witness initially says  the 2nd  accused  who stood  on  his"
"right  didn't have  anything  on  his  lap.  Subsequently  he  contradicts  his  own  version  and"
"says that when  he got up things fell  from his lap. This  may not be  a serious contradiction"
"but  not calling  any  other witnesses  to  explain  the  contradictions  may  cause  a doubt to"
"any  person.  This  does  not  mean  that  many witness  need  to  prove  a fact,  but  given  the"
"in 
this  case 
it  causes  a  doubt 
in  our  mind.  There 
is  not  much  of 
circumstances"
"description given about the scene  of crime or the mode of the raid  conducted."
