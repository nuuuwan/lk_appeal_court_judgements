"the fact that the Act  requires the establishment of the continuity of the"
"valid  permit or other written authority referred to above.  This is  manifest"
"by the phrase "" ...  and  that such  permit or authority is  in  force  and  not"
"revoked  or otherwise  rendered  invalids  ...  "".  Such  a position  may change"
"with  time and  would  not be  static. Therefore,  it stands to reason  that the"
"question whether one  is authorized  to occupy a state land  must be"
"assessed  as at a given time."
