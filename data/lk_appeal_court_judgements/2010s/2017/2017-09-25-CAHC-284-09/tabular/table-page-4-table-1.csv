"Those question posed to the complainant were not relevant to the"
"issue in  hand. And the learned High Court Judge shouldn't have allowed"
"those  question  and 
those  question  offend  Section  5  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance which provides that evidence can  be lead of facts in  issue and"
"relevant fact only."
"Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that the money in"
"question  was  given 
to 
the  assistant  of  the  appellant  and  not  to 
the"
"appellant  himself,  but 
I  find 
that  this  money  has  been  given  on 
the"
"direction  of 
the  appellant 
in 
the  presence  of 
the  decoy  and 
the"
"complainant."
"The  counsel  for the  appellant further submitted  that the evidence"
"of  the  decoy  amounts 
to  confessionary  nature  and  submitted  such"
"evidence is  not admissible.  At the time  of the transaction  appellant was"
"not in  the custody of the decoy or the  investigating officer and therefore"
"the words uttered  by the appellant implicating  him  does not come under"
"section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"Although 
the  appellant's  counsel  argued 
that  the 
learned  High"
"Court  Judge  failed  to  analyze  the  defence  evidence,  on  a  perusal  of"
"pages  189  and  190  I  find 
it  otherwise.  The  complainant  himself  has"
"testified 
that  he  has  no  personal 
interest  or  animosity 
towards 
the"
"appellant.  He  has  stated  that  he  never  wanted  to 
testify  against  the"
"appellant."
