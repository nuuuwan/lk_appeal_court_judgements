the  prosecution  and 
the  defence's  version  was"
"considered.  The judgment  is  dated  and  signed  by  the  trial judge,  there  after  it was"
"pronounced  in  open court. The  counsel  for the  1st  and 2nd  accused  made submissions"
"in  mitigation. After considering  the submission  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  imposed  the"
"sentence and fine.  It is  noted that the learned  High Court Judge had  not imposed the"
"maximum  sentence  provided  by  the  law.  He  had  given  a  lenient  sentence  on  the"
"accused  appellants.  I do not see any illegality or impropriety in  the sentence."
"Considering  the  contents  of the judgment,  I find  that the trial judge had  considered"
"the  ingredients  of the  charge  and  analysed  the  evidence  submitted  by  prosecution."
"time,  he  had  considered 
the  defence  put 
forward  by  the  accused 
At  the  same"
"through  the  prosecution~ The  1st  accused  remained  silent;  the  2nd  accused  made  a"
"dock  statement  and  denied  the  allegation  against  him.  The  learned  Trial  Judge  had"
"not  drawn  any  adverse 
inference  against 
these 
two  accused  persons.  He  had"
"considered  all  the evidence  in  a holistic approach  and  come  to a conclusion  that the"
"charges are  proved against the respective accused  beyond reasonable doubt."
