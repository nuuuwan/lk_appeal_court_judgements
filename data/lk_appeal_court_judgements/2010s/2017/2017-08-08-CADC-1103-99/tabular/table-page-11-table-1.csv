"In VelupiZZai  vs.  Subasinghe (1956)  58 NLR  385 Basnayake"
"C.J.  said:"
"""It would appear from  this passage that a  person who is entitled to"
"claim  a  way  of necessity  is  the  person  who  is  the  owner  alone."""
"The  competence  to  assert  this  claim  is  inextricably  tied  up  with"
"ownership of a  land or praedium."
"The  principle  admits  of  no  doubt 
that  a 
servitude"
"cannot  be  granted  by  any  other  than 
the  owner  of  a 
servient"
"tenement, nor acquired by any other than by the person who owns"
"the dominant tenement."
