"and  produced  as","lR..  before  this  Court,  the  Petitioner  has  strenuously  raised  his"
"","objections to the  nomination  made  by  his  father and  called  in  question  the  legality"
"","and  validity of such  nomination. In that letter which  is  marked  as  lR.., the Petitioner"
"has  stated 
that  as","the  4th  Respondent  was  a  stranger  and  a 
third  party,  his"
"","nomination would  be  illegal.  In  fact, the underlying basis  of the objection  is that the"
"","4th  Respondent  is  not  a  biological  son  at  all  of the  petitioner's  father  Horathala."
"","Acting  on  his  undated  letter,  it appears  that the  1st  Respondent  called  for a report"
"","from  the  relevant  Grama  Niladhari  and  the  report  of the  Grama  Niladhari  (lR3)  of"
"07.07.2009  bears  out  the  fact  that  Horathala~the father  of the  petitioner  in  fact",""
"","nominated the  4th  Respondent.  Quite  peeved  by this turn  of events,  it appears  that"
"the  Petitioner  had  also  addressed  a","letter  dated  11.12.2009 
(P9) 
to 
the  1st"
"","Respondent  Divisional  Secretary  objecting  to  the  said  nomination.  In  P9  too,  the"
"","Petitioner asserts  that the 4th  Respondent's  nomination  is  illegal.  So  the documents"
"","marked lR.. and  P9 constitute the petitioner's objections to the 4th Respondent being"
"nominated and given a grant.",""
