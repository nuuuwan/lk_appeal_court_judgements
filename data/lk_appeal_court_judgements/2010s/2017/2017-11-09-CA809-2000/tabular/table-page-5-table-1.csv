"The Learned District Judge  in Judgement dated  18th  August 2000,  has  come"
"to  a  clear  finding  in  respect  of the  investigation  carried  out  on  22.04.1992  at  the"
"Respondent's Rice Mill, where it is  stated that,"
"a)  There 
is  no  evidence 
led  to  conclude  that  the  Appellant's  electricity"
"meter was  functioning well and the  seals were intact at the time the CEB"
"took over the supply of electricity in the Ambalantota area in April  1991."
"b)  Since a new meter was  not installed there  is  no evidence before Court to"
"electricity 
supply 
and 
conclude 
that 
after 
the 
taking 
over  of  the"
"distribution by the CEB, the Appellant's meter was  checked and  marked"
"as  accurately calibrated and seals were intact."
"Therefore in the absence of any evidence or justification that the Respondent"
"tampered  with 
the  meter  or  broke 
its 
seal 
the 
said 
findings  of  the  CEB"
"investigation clearly shows that the  Respondent was  deprived of a just and  lawful"
"in 
inquiry 
to 
the  allege  electricity  meter 
tampering  before  orders  containing"
"documents  marked  P9  and  PI 0 were  issued.  Therefore  the  purported  inquiry  and"
"the subsequent disconnection of the power supply carried out on 22.04.1992 at the"
"premises  of the  Appellant  does  not  in  any  measure  satisfy  the  requirement  to  be"
"(1)  of  the  Ceylon 
just  and  carried  out 
in  good  faith 
in 
terms  of  Section  59"
"Electricity  Board  Act.  It  is  also  observed that  the  Appellant has  no  legal  right  to"
"claim  for  any  relief for  losses  accrued  if any,  from  an  unlawful  consumption  of"
"electricity by the Respondent."
