"When  one considers the posts held  by the Petitioners which  have been  set"
"out earlier in this judgment, it is clear that they cannot be  brought under"
"the Secondary Grade as their posts cannot be categorized  under that"
"Grade in  keeping  with the definitions assigned  to it."
"Therefore, there appears to be  no basis or justification to place the"
"Petitioners at the next higher level  namely under the category of"
"Management Assistants as  has  been  suggested  by them."
"Further, the letter produced  marked  P 21 is just a proposal,  the employer"
"of the Petitioners had  made to the Salaries and Cadre Commission.  It is"
"understandable that the Salaries and  Cadre Commission  has a duty to look"
"at it as a whole and  in  comparison to the other public officers.  It is not"
"justifiable for this Court to compel the Salaries and Cadre Commission to"
"implement the said  proposal  merely because it was  made by the"
"employers of the Petitioners."
