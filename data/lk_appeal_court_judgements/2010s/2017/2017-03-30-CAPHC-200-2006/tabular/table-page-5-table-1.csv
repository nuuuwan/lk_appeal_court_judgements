"","evidence.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge,  without  considering  any  of the"
"","evidence presented  by  the  parties,  only  on the  premise that taking  a three"
"","wheeler will not prejudice the land owner; has allowed the three wheeler to"
"","be taken through the land."
"","The  right  of a  foot  path  and  a  right  to  use  a  motorway  are  two"
"","different rights.  Just because that there  was  a 5 feet  foot  path,  he  does  not"
"","become entitle to  use  the path to take vehicles less than 5 feet wide unless"
"","he  proves that he  is  entitle to  use  the  road  as  a motorway.  In this  case the"
"","Respondent has failed to establish the use of a motorway."
"","in 
the  case  of Jayasekera  Hamine  vs.  Agida 
De  Kretser  J.  held"
"","Hamine 46 NLR 38 that the servitude of footway (iter) includes the right to"
"","use  a bicycle  or wheelbarrow.  But a three  wheeler  is  a motorized vehicle"
"","which  moves  faster  making  a  noise  not  like  a  bicycle  or  a  wheelbarrow."
"","Therefore I believe that a three wheeler cannot be put in to the category of"
"","a ""bicycle or a wheelbarrow"". It is a vehicle of its own."
"","My  view 
is 
that  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  misdirected"
"","himself  in  allowing  three  wheelers  to  be 
taken  through  the 
foot  path."
"","Accordingly  I  set  aside  the  order  of the  learned  High  Court  Judge  and"
