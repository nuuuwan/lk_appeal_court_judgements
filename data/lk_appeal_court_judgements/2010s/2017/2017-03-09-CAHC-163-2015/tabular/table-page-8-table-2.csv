"testified that he  usually  leaves the  field  around 6.00pm but on the  day  in  question"
"4.30  pm  since  it  was  raining.  (vide  page  98  of the  Appeal 
he  left  around  4.00  -"
"brief)  Upon  being  cross  examined  PW2  confirms  that  he  the  incident  occurred"
"around 4.00pm (vide page 98  of the Appeal brief). It is  therefore evident that PWI"
"and PW2  are  at a variance when stating the time on which the  incident occurred, a"
"discrepancy which again goes to the root of the instant case. The light conditions at"
"4.00 - 4.30 pm and 6.00 -
6.30 pm are different. And one can assume that with the"
"prevalent rain conditions ones vision may be impaired at close to  6.30 pm where as"
"in  such  impediment  would  not  necessarily  arise  closer  to  4.00pm.  The  question"
"then is what time could the alleged incident have occurred?"
"This  Court  finds  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  establish  a  key  element  in the"
"narrative  that  led  to  the  death  of the  deceased  by  not  adequately  establishing  the"
"time  at  which  the  incident  occurred.  A  prudent  observer  may  nevertheless,  point"
"out,  that  if the  vision  of eye  witnesses  PWI  and  PW2  were  so  impaired  to  the"
"extent of not been able to have consistently corroborated on each others presence at"
"the 
time  of  the 
incident,  could  either  of  them  have  effectively 
identified  the"
"Appellant?"
