"","My brother,  Justice Vijith  Malalgoda,  P.C.  President  of 
the  Court"
"of 
Appeal","had 
decided 
in 
Kaluarachchi 
Elen 
Nona 
Vs 
Sunil"
"Weerasinghe  and","four  others 
(C.A.  Writ  23/2013  decided  on 
10.06.2013)"
"almost 
the","identical  matter 
that 
the  provincial  High  Court 
and 
the  Court"
"of  Appeal  also  has  concurrent","jurisdiction.  I conquer his view."
"","The 
legislators  brought 
the 
13th 
amendment 
to 
provide  easy"
"excess  of  all  central  authorities  and","judiciary 
to 
the  public, 
till 
then  citizens"
"of  our 
country","had  come  to  Colombo 
for  most  of 
the 
things.  Now 
it 
is"
"available, 
close","to 
their  home, 
namely  within 
the 
province.  Once 
again,"
"valid 
without","reason  taking  matters  which  had  been  given 
to 
the  provincial"
"High  Court","to  Court 
of  Appeal, 
will 
not 
serve 
the 
purposes 
of 
the"
"amendment","I  am  of  view 
that 
these  matters 
to 
the  Constitution.  Therefore"
"should 
be","dealt 
by 
the 
provincial  High  Court,  which 
is 
closed 
to 
their"
"","home.  Most  of the  time,  the  relevant  judges  are  sensitive  on  the  issues  of the"
"said  province.  Considering","all, 
this  Court 
decides 
this  matter 
should 
be"
"heard 
and","determine  by 
the 
Provincial 
High 
Court 
holden 
at 
Kegalle."
"Therefore  we  decided","to 
transfer 
this  case 
to 
the  Provincial  High  Court  of"
"Kegalle.",""
"Registrar","is 
hereby 
directed 
to 
transfer 
the 
case 
record 
and 
all"
"connected  papers","to 
the  Registrar  of  Provincial  High  Court."
