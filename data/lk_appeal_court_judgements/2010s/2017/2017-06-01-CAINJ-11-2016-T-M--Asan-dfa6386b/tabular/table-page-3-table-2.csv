"was 
in  operation.  The  Petitioners  are  now  totally  depend  on documents"
"PI  and  P2  to  explain  their  delay. 
However  at  the  time 
the  explanation"
"was  gIven 
the contract had already been expired and therefore  there was"
"no  reason 
for 
the  2nd  Respondent 
to  adhere 
to 
the 
terms  of  the"
"contract.  In  the  said  circumstances,  it  is  our view  that  this  contract  had"
"been  expired  and  since  the 
Petitioners  could  not 
complete 
the  work"
"within  the  specified  period 
the  2 nd  Respondent had reasons  to  terminate"
"the  said  contract.  In  the  said  circumstances,  a  necessity  of adjudication"
"will  not  arise  and 
therefore 
we  see  no  reason 
to 
issue  an  injunction"
"preventing 
the 
2nd  Respondent 
from 
taking 
further 
action 
prior 
to"
"adjudication. This application is therefore dismissed.  No  cost is ordered."
