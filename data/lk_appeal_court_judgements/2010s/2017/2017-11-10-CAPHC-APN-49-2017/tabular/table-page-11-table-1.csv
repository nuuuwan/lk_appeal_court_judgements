"For the foregoing  reasons,  this Court is  of the view that it does not have"
"jurisdiction to entertain the instant revision  application."
"Therefore, this Court decides not to extend the stay order it had  earlier"
"granted as  an  interim relief.  As  this issue  has  been  raised  as  a preliminary"
"objection with  regard  to jurisdiction and  since this Court has  held that it"
"has  no jurisdiction to entertain this application, this Court decides to"
"dismiss this application.  No costs ordered."
"This  revision  application  must therefore stand dismissed without costs."
