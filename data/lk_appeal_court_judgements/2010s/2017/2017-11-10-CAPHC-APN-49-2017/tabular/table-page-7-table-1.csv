"said  Article  140 is  couched  in  such  a way that it would only be  (unlike"
"Article  126)  ""subject to the provisions of the Constitution"".  This is  because"
"the Constitution  has  not subjected Article  140 to other ordinary laws."
"However wordings appear in  Article  138 is  not the same and  is couched  in"
"a way that the constitution  itself has subjected the provisions in  Article  138"
"to 'any law'.  Artcicle  170 of the Constitution  interprets ""law"" as  any Act of"
"Parliament,  and  any law enacted  by any legislation at any time prior to the"
"commencement of the Constitution and  includes an  Order in  Council."
"The  Supreme Court in  the case  of Weragama  V Eksath  Lanka  Wathu"
"Kamkaru  Samithiya2  stated as  follows; ""However, the jurisdiction of the"
"Court of Appeal  under Article  138 is  not an  entrenched jurisdiction,"
"because Article  138 provides that it is  subject to the  provisions ""of any"
"law"";  hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to"
"be  reduced  or transferred  by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled to"
"exercise judicial  power) ...... """
"Therefore, to ascertain  whether this Court can  exercise  its revisionary"
"jurisdiction in  the instant case,  one  needs to turn  to the relevant law"
