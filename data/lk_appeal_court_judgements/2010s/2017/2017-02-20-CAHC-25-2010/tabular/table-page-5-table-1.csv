"Such  view  was  observed  in  the  English  case  of  AG for  Northern  Ireland  v"
"Gallagher.  Where  Lord  ''If a  man,  whilst  sane and  sober,  forms  an intention  to  kill"
"and  makes  preparation  for  it,  knowing  it  is  a  wrong  thing  to  do,  and  then  gets"
"himself  drunk  so  as  to  give  himself  Dutch  courage  to  do  the  killing,  and  whilst"
"drunk carries out his intention,  he cannot rely on this self-induced drunkenness as"
"a  defence to a  charge of murder, nor even as reducing it to manslaughter."
