"established by such a document."
"The Respondent's stand taken in the objection is  that the Petitioner"
"was an employee of the Irrigation department and the building was given"
"to  him  as  his  quarters  but failed  to  hand it  back after the retirement.  The"
"Petitioner denies that he was  in the  Government service at any  time.  The"
"Respondents  could have established very  easily that the Petitioner was  in"
"their  employment  by  tendering  his  service  record.  They  have  failed  or"
"neglected  to  tender those  documents.  Therefore the  only  conclusion that"
"the Court can come  in to is  that the Petitioner was not in the Government"
"service  and  this  building  was  not  allocated  to  him  as  quarters  for  his"
"employment."
