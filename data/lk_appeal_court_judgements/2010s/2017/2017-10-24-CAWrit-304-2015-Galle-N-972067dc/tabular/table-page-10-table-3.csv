"tradition of British justice that judges should not shrink from"

"This  was  in  a  case  where  a  Nigerian  chief had been  deported to"
"another  area  but  the  power  to  do  so  depended  on  a  number  of"
"conditions.  The  Privy Council held that it was for the  executive to"
"show that these  conditions existed and they remitted the case to the"
"court in Nigeria."
"Where,  on  the  other hand,  the  administrative  act is  some  decision"
"or order which  in  itself inflicts  no  legal wrong,  the  complainant's"
"task will be to raise prima facie case of irregularity,  and the burden"
"of proof lies upon him.  This is equally so where there is an invasion"
