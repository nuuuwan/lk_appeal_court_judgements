"to share 
the 
injury complained  of  with  others 
is  utterly 
illogical  as"
"explained  by  Lord  Wilberforce 
in 
the Gouriet  case13. 
""A 
right 
is  none"
"the 
less  a  right or  a  wrong  any 
the 
less  a  wrong  because  millions"
"of  people  have a  similar 
right  or  may  suffer  a  similar  wrong. 
It  is"
"illogical 
to 
treat the  adequacy  of  interest  of  an  applicant 
for 
judicial"
"review 
to  be  as  having  being  vitiated  or  wiped  out  by 
its  being"
"shared  with  a 
large or 
indefinite  group  of  persons;  on 
the  contrary,"
"each  member  of  the definite  group  ought to  be 
treated  as  a  person"
"""interested""  or  having a  stake 
in 
the  matter  and  accorded  standing""."
