"One  cannot  seek  corroboration  from  a witness  who  does  not  establish  directly  or"

"Admissibility of Evidence under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance"
"Section 33 of the Ordinance provides one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, when"
"it  states  that  evidence  given  by  a  witness  in  a  judicial  proceeding  or  before  any"
"person  authorized  by  law to take  it,  is  relevant in  a subsequent judiCial  proceeding,"
