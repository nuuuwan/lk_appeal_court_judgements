"circumstances. The above-mentioned reasons set out by the trial judge cannot be considered as"
"exceptional grounds to enlarge the accused respondent on bail."
"When considering the cases mentioned above it is abundantly clear that the intention of the"
"legislature is that, unless the exceptional circumstances demonstrated, bail will not be granted. It"
"is pertinent to  note that in the said order, the exceptional circumstances are not even mentioned."
"Therefor considering the rationale observed by our superior courts, in  granting bail to an"
"accused charged under the said act, it is very clear, that Learned  High  Court Judge should have"
"considered whether there were exceptional circumstances before granting bail."
"Thus, this court set aside the order dated 29.09.2016 of the Learned High Court Judge."
