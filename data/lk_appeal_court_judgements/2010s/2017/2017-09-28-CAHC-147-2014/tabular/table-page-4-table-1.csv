she 
says 
this  had  happened 
several  days 
ago  and"
"subsequently she says  it  had  happened on the previous day.  She is  not certain  of her"
"evidence regarding the so called previous attack."
"While  her husband and  her were returning on the way the accused  had travelled  in  a"
"bicycle very close to them.  He  had  not knocked  or caused any physical  harm to them."
"On the day of the incident i.e.  on the 2nd  August 2004 she confirms that the brothers"
"of  the  deceased  had  come  home 
late 
in 
the  evening  and 
left 
to

"not  return,  she  walked  up  to  the  bund  at  around  11.30pm 
in 
the  night  and  she"
"couldn't find  her husband. She said  she had clear visibility,  due to moon light.  On the"
"following  day,  in  the morning  she got to know that her husband  is  lying  dead on the"

the  house  of  the  deceased.  It 
is  also"
"observed, that she says there was a  fight  between the deceased and his  brother Sunil"

there 
is  no  direct

"evidence to connect the accused to the death of the deceased.  On  one occasion she"
"says  in  the  night in  question  she  heard  a  noise  of someone slamming  a  mammotty"
"on  the  ground.  When  questioned  she  couldn't  identify  who  slammed  it  and  further"
"she  did  not  hear any  cries  of her  husband  or anyone.  Hypothetically  if  we  concede"
"that the accused assaulted the deceased with  a  mammotty it  contradicts the position"
"taken by the prosecution that a club was recovered on a 27(1)  statement."
"Considering the totality of the evidence of the wife of the deceased,  it contradicts the"
"other available evidence specifically;  there was  a fight  between the deceased and  his"
"brother earlier.  His  participation was not questioned or excluded."
"The  JMO  gave  evidence  and.  submitted  that  if  treatment  was  given  the  deceased"
"could  have  been saved.  Further the fatal  injuries could have  been inflicted with  sharp"
