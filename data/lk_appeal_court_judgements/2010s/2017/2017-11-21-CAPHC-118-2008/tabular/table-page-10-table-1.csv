"the  instant case  is quite different. Therefore, there is  no  merit in  the"
"submission  made on  behalf of the Respondent  regarding  the application of"
"the  principle of res judicata to these  proceedings."

"occupation  of the relevant land  upon  any written  authority of the state"
"granted  in  accordance with any written  law and  that such  authority is  in"
"force and  not revoked  or otherwise rendered  invalid as  required  by section"
"9 of the Act."
"This Court therefore decides to allow this appeal.  The order of learned"
