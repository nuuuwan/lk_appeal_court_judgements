"grounds and  then this Court had  re-fixed the argument for 2017-06-28."
"This Court having observed the absence of parties in  Court when  it was"
"first called  in  the morning  kept down the case to enable the parties or any"
"of their representatives to make some arrangement even  to appear before"
