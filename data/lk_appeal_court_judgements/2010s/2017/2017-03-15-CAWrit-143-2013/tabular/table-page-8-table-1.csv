"Lot No.  17"
"In respect of Lot No.  17 in  Plan  No.  MU.  P.  Mara  2322 the Petitioner and  2"
"others have submitted claims.  Thereafter an  inquiry in terms of section 9 of"
"the Act has  been  held.  All  the claimants including the  Petitioner had"
"participated at this inquiry. These  inquiry proceedings have been  produced"
"marked  2 R 23, 2 R 24, 2 R 25 and  2 R 26. As there was a dispute"
"with  regard to the claims to this lot, the Divisional  Secretary had  decided to"
"refer the said dispute to the District Court for a decision,  in terms of"
"section  10(1)(a) of the  Land  Acquisition  Act.  This is clearly reflected in the"
"notice of his decision  produced  marked  2 R 27. Thus,  it is the  position of"
"the  Divisional  Secretary that the amount of compensation  payable in"
"respect of lot No.  17 would  be deposited  in the  District Court to be  paid to"
"the person who would  be entitled to it, once the District Court decides that"
"issue."
"The  Petitioner has been  informed of the  prevailing  position  with  regard  to"
"tis lot."
"Thus the Petitioner cannot complain  against that decision."
