"The  appellant 
relies  on  M.H.  Priyani  alias  Chooty  and  another  Vs  Attorney"
"General  CA  10-11/2010  decided  on  07/02/2014,  referred  the  investigation  officers"
"as  Police  officers  attached  to  Police  Narcotics  Bureau, 
in 
fact  those  officers  were"
"attached to the Excise  Department and  I find that the reference  made by the Counsel"
"was  incorrect.  Carefully considering  the facts  of the case,  I conclude that the  present"
"case  is  much different from the above case."
"The  modus  operandi  of an  operation  is  decided  by  the  main 
investigation  officer"
"after  considering  the  environment,  person  involved,  quantity,  facilities  available  and"
"many other things.  In  this  case  PS  Seneratna  says  that he  had  a specific  information"
"regarding  that,  the accused  was  carrying  narcotic  substance.  There  is  no information"
"about her house. Considering the scene of crime as  explained  by the witnesses,  it was"
"noon 
time,  a  bus  stand  at  Thotalanga  and  a  woman  carrying  substantially  high"
"quantity of heroin,  will  a prudent officer with  experience  in  the  narcotics  raid  take  a"
"risk  of  going 
to  another  place,  specially 
the 
residence  of  the  accused  which 
is"
"situated in a crowded area  (slum)."
"The  accused  appellant  submits 
that  her  dock  statement  was 
rejected  and  an"
"unnecessary  burden  was  casted  on  her.  The 
learned 
trial 
judge  had 
found 
the"
"accused  guilty after giving  considered  reasons.  There  he  had  analysed  the  evidence"
