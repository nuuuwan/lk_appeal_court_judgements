VIJITH K. MALALGODA PCJ IP I CAl

This is a matter which was supported before this Court m

December 2015. This Court had issued notices on the respondents but the 1st

respondent was right throughout absent and unrepresented. However, when

this matter came up on 01.06.2016 the petitioner agreed to discharge 2nd to

4th respondents and the Court issued notices on the 1 st respondent. Thereafter

the petitioner did not come before this Court on certain days and the Court

made "no order" due to that reason. Thereafter on 08th of February 2017 the

matter came up on a motion filed by the petitioner and Court decided to re-list

this application and re-issue notices on the 1st respondent. We observe that the

petitioner has not taken any interest to issue notices on the 1 st respondent

since then. But the Counsel appearing for the petitioner informs that they

couriered the notices day before yesterday and a motion was filed to that effect

in the Registry yesterday. But we cannot find any document before us in

support of this position. We observe that the petitioner had not taken due

diligence in prosecuting this case which was supported before this Court in

December 2015. Therefore we see no reason to allow the petitioner to proceed

with this application. Therefore we dismiss this application

Application is dismissed.
