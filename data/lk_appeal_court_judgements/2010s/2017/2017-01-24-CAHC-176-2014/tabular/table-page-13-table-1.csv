"In  relation 
to 
the 
impugned  blood  sample  as  claimed  by 
the  defence 
it 
is"
"apparent 
that 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  had  given  a  proper  account"
"regarding  the  chain  of evidence  of the  intact  productions  by  referring  to  the"
"evidence and the documents which were marked as  P5  -P7(b) before evaluating"
"the evidence by PW12."
"Therefore,this  Court  sees  no  reason  to  reject  the  findings  of the  learned  High"
"the  DNA  evidence  as 
Court  Judge 
relating 
to 
the  evidence  of  PW12  or"
"contended by the Appellant."
"In  addition  to  the  aforesaid  grounds  of Appeal  the  Counsel  for  the  Appellant"
"further  alleged 
that 
the  elucidated 
items  of  circumstantial  evidence  were"
"insufficient 
to 
prove 
the  prosecution's 
case 
against 
the 
accused 
beyond"
