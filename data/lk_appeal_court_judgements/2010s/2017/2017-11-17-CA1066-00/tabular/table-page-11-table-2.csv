"In  a village  even adjoining  separate  lands may have the  same  names."
"For example, a large land that existed many decades ago may become"
"separate  lands  with  separate  identity  by  long  prescriptive  possession"
"by  its  co-owners  or outsiders.  They  may  use  the  same  name  for  the"
"separate portion they acquired by prescription."
"Therefore, the corpus surveyed for  the district court case and depicted"
"in  the  preliminary plan  cannot  be  said  forming  part  of alleged  larger"
"land  called  Nagahalanda  merely  because  one  boundary  (namely  the"
"western boundary) found  in preliminary plan is called N agahalanda."
"On  the  other  hand  if the  land  in  preliminary  plan  is  part  of alleged"
"larger  land  Nagahalanda,  Ambagahawatta  found  in  preliminary  plan"
"to  the  South  of its  corpus  should  be  a  boundary  to  the  larger  land"
