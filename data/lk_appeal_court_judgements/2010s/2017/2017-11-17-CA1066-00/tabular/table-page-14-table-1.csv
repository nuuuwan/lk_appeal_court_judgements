"Though the learned district judge, at page 5 of his judgment, has come"
"to  the  inference  that  the  name  N agahawatta  has  been  mentioned  for"
"the land called Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda in  deeds marked as  PI"
"to P5,  quite contrary to that,  at page 6 of his judgment he has come to"
"the  conclusion that there  is  no  definite  oral  or documentary  evidence"
"with  regard  to  a  land  called Nagahawatta alias  Nahahalanda and  that"
"only  fact  clearly  represented  by  those  evidence  is  that  there  are  two"
"separate lands called N agahawatta and N agahalanda."
