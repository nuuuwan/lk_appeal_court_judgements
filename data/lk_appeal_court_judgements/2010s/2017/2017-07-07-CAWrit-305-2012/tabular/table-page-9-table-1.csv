"Petitioner has presented this application  on the basis that the"
"Respondents had  acted arbitrarily to insist on  a requirement to maintain"
"a secured  zone the diameter of which  should  not less than  100 Meters."
"It has  now become clear before this Court that the Petitioner no  longer"

"action on the part of the Respondents therefore cannot be categorized"
"as an  action that is arbitrary for all  what the Respondents  had done"
"was to insist on  legal  requirements to be complied  with. This  means"
"that the application of the Petitioner has to necessarily fail."
"In addition to the above ground, the  Petitioner has also  not adduced"
"sufficient material to prove that his water source is well  within the"
"protected zone.  Further, the misrepresentation  by the Petitioner above"
"referred to,  affect the credibility of all  the positions the Petitioner had"
"taken  up."
