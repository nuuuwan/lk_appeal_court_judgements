"declaration  only  to  an  entitlement  like  in  the  section  69  of the  Primary"
"Court Procedure  Act.  69(1)  says  ""the  Judge  of the  Primary  Court  shall"
"determine as to who is  entitled to  the right"" and 69(2) says  ""may declare"
"that any person specified therein shall be entitled to any such right""."
"Under both this  sections the  Court has to  make  a positive  determination,"
"not a negative determination. The Court can make an order not to disturb"
"the  possession  of a  certain  party  or  it  can  make  order  prohibiting  all"
"disturbance  or  interference  with  the  exercise  of such  right,  but  cannot"
"make  a declaration that a party  is  not entitle to  a certain right.  Therefore"
