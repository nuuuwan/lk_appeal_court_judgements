"cannot neglect the basis for such delay which transpired in the evidence. """
"In the instant Appeal no such evidence has transpired for this  Court to  consider"
"and as such this Court finds  that the evidence of PWI  implicating the Appellant"
"is  of low evidentiary value."
"The second ground of Appeal urged by  the  learned Counsel for the Appellant is"
"that the identification of the Appellant made by PW3  is  not credible since it was"
"an identification of the Appellant who was in the dock."
"What  transpired  in  the  evidence  of PW3,  who  was  the  brother-in-law  of the"
"deceased  and  also  the  virtual  complainant,  was  that  he  had  seen  the  Appellant"
