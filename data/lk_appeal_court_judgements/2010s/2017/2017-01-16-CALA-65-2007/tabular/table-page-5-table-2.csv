"arrested  by  the  1st  Respondent.  It  was  further  submitted  that  when  the"
"complainant met the  1st  Respondent  at  the  Police  Station,  she  has given"
"the 
telephone  number  which  was 
the  general  number  of  the  Police"
"Station.  The  said  telephone  number was given by  the  1st  Respondent  to"
"the  Complainant  in  order  to  inquire  about  the  bracelet  alleged  to  have"
"been  recovered  from 
the  complainant's  husband.  The  version  of  the"
"prosecution is  that  the  telephone  number was given  to  the  Complainant"
"to facilitate the gratification."
"In 
the  event  the  telephone  number  was  indeed  given  to  facilitate 
the"
"gratification, this court finds it questionable as to why the 1st  Respondent"
"gave the official telephone number of the Police Station."
