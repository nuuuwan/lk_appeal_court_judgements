"summary manner any offence of contempt committed against or in"
"disrespect of its authority."
"The interim orders issued  by the High Court above  referred to, had  been"
"granted as  recently as  2016-05-13,  by the High  Court of Western  Province"
"holden  in  Colombo (exercising  civil jurisdiction). It is to be  noted that the"
"main case  is still  pending  before that High  Court and  the orders that are"
"alleged to have  been  violated  by the Respondents are interim orders that"
"the learned  High Court Judge had  made at the very first instance of the"
"case."
"The case  record  containing  all  the relevant material as  well  as all  the"
"relevant parties are already before the said  High Court.  If the  Respondents"
"have violated the interim orders granted by the High  Court thus"
"committing an  offence of contempt, the question arises as to why the said"
"High  Court cannot deal  with this case  particularly when it has been"
"specifically vested  with such  power by the legislature.  Similarly the"
"question as to why in those circumstances this court should entertain this"
"case  when  it is clearly a matter which  should  come under the purview of"
"the High  Court."
