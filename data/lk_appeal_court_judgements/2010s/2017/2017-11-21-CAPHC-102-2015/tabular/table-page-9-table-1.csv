"Further,  this Court in  an  earlier occasion  also,  in  the case  of Punchi  Nona V"
"Padumasena  and  others2  had  held as follows;"
"Section  68  (1) of the Act is concerned  with the determination as  to

"who  was  in  possession  of the land on  the date of the filing  of the"
"information to Court.  Section  68  (3)  becomes applicable only if the Judge"
"can  come to a definite finding  that some other party had  been  forcibly"
"dispossessed  within a period  of 2 months next preceding  the date on  which"
"the  information  was  filed.

"Therefore the submission  made  by the learned  Counsel  for the Appellant"
"that the learned  Primary Court Judge has erred  when  he determined as to"
"who  was  in  possession  on  the date of filing  information  in  Court is"
"unacceptable.  Learned  Primary Court Judge  had  merely exercised the"
"powers that he  is obliged to exercise  in  terms of section  68  (1).  He  has"
"rightly  held  that there  is  no  dispossession  which  would  warrant an  order"
"under section  68(3) of the Act."
"In these circumstances,  this Court is  of the opinion  that the  learned"
"Primary Court Judge  had  correctly identified and  applied  the  law to the set"
