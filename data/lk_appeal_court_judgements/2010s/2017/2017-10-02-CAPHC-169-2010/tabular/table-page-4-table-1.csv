"Being  aggrieved  by the said  order made by the learned  Magistrate, the"
"Appellant had  filed  a revision  application  in  the  Provincial  High  Court of"
"Sabaragamuwa  Province  holden at Rathnapura  seeking a revision  of the"
"order of the learned  Magistrate."
"The  Provincial  High Court after the conclusion  of the argument,  had"
"pronounced its judgment dated  2011  -10-27,  holding that there  is  no basis"
"to deviate from the conclusions arrived at by the learned  Magistrate. The"
"Provincial  High  Court had therefore proceeded  to dismiss the said  revision"
"application."
"It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed  this appeal  in this"
"Court."
"Although the Appellant had  been  present before this Court on the initial"
"dates this case  had come  up in this Court,  he  had thereafter failed  to"
"appear on  the subsequent dates.  He  has also failed to respond  to the"
"notices this Court had  sent to him.  Nevertheless, this Court has proceeded"
"to consider the merits of his appeal."
