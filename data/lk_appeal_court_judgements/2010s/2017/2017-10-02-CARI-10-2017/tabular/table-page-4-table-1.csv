"of Restitutio in integrum in the following manner;"
"""Ristitutio 
is  however  available  not  merely for  the  purpose  of restoring"
"person under disability to  the position they would have enjoyed had they not"
"entered in  to  the  contract which  is  impugned  It  is  also  a  general  remedy"
"available for  restoration  of the  status  quo  ante  in  all  that  wide  range  of"
"situations in which the law for one reason or another deems it proper to free"
"a  party from 
the  consequences  of his  contract.  Remedy  lies  in  cases  of"
"mistake, fraud,  undue  influence  and illegality have  been  discussed in  some"
"detail in the respective chapters of this work dealing with these topics."
