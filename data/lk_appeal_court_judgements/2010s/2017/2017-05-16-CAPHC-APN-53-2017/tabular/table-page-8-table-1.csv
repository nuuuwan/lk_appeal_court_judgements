"The  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  presented  another  argument  that  the"
"Petitioners had to  act on the  direction  of the  superior officers  and therefore"
"they  cannot be  held  liable  for  contempt of Court.  It is  also  a matter for  the"
"trial judge to decide on evidence. The evidence will reveal the culpability of"
"the  Petitioners.  It is  too  early  for  this  Court to  come  to  a  finding  on  a  fact"
"where the evidence has not yet been led."
