"that the offence stated  in  the indictment had  occurred  during this time period."
"It  is  prudent  to  see 
the  relevant 
legal  provision  which 
in  this  situation  would  be"
"Section  165 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure Act which states as  follows:"
"(1)  The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place"
"of the  alleged offence and as  to  the person (If any)  against  whom"
"and as to the thing (If any)  in  respect of which  it was  committed as"
"are  reasonably sufficient  to  give  the  accused notice  of the  matter"
"with  which  he 
is charged  and  to  show 
that 
the offence is  not"
"prescribed"
"(2)  When 
the  accused  is charged  with  criminal  breach  of trust  or"
"dishonest misappropriation of movable property, it shall be sufficient"
"to specify the gross sum or,  as the case may be,  the gross quantity in"
"respect of which  the offence is alleged to have been committed, and"
"the  dates  between  which 
the offence is  alleged 
to  have  been"
"committed without  specifying  particular  items  or exact  dates,  and"
"the charge so 
framed 
shall 
be 
deemed 
to 
be 
a charge of"
"one offence within the meaning of section  174:"
"Provided that the  time  included between  the  first  and last of such"
"dates shall not exceed one year."
"(3)  When manner of committing offence must be stated"
"When  the nature of the  case  is such  that the particulars mentioned"
"in  section  164 and the preceding subsections of this section do not"
"give 
the  accused  sufficient  notice  of the  matter  with  which  he"
"is charged, 
the charge shall  also  contain 
such  particulars  of  the"
"manner  in  which 
the  alleged offence was  committed  as  will  be"
"sufficient for that purpose."
