"Co.,  vs.  Hurd {1874} L.R., 5 P.C 221 at 239."
"An application for a Writ of certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time from the date"
"of the Order  which  the applicant seeks to  have quashed.  What is  reasonable  time and what"
"will constitute undue delay  will depend upon  the facts  of each  particular case.  However  the"
"time  lag  that  can  be  explained  does  not spell  laches  or  delay.  If  delay  can  be  reasonably"
"explained,  the Court  will not decline  to  interfere.  The  delay which  a  Court  can  excuse is  one"
"which  is  caused by the applicant pursuing  a legal remedy and not a remedy  which  is  extra"
"legal.  One satisfactory way to explain the delay is for the petitioner to show that he has been"
"seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by the Law."
"Considering all  available  materials, the Court finds that this  is  not a proper case  for the Court to"
"issue notice hence issuance of Notice is  refused."
"Notice refused."
