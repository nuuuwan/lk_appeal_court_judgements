"The Plaintiff and the 5th  Defendant Respondent has admitted that Muhandiram"
"is the original owner of the property to be partition. However the Plaintiff in his"
"written submissions had stated that the property was owned by Plaintiff s father"
"one Ran Naide.  The Plaintiff has not disclosed these fact  in his plaint. He also"
"has  not  disclosed the  names  of the  illegitimate  children  in  his  plaint  and  had"
"failed  to  give  notice  under section  20(1)  of the  Partition Law.  Accordingly,  I"
"hold that the plaint of the Plaint is defective in that the Plaintiff has to indicate"
"the  correct  pedigree  and  whether  the  land  is  paraveni  property  or  acquired"
"property in the plaint."
"I am of the view that the Plaintiff has failed to narrate the nature of the property"
"and to mention whether Ran Ethana was married in deega or binna and whether"
"Muhandiram had other children who had claims to the land to be partitioned."
