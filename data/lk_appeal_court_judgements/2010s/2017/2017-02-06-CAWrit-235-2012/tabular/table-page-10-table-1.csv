"third party namely,  Manel Thilak Gunasinghe, for a period of one year to be"
"reckoned  from  2010-05-01. The details given  in  the  indenture of lease"
"bearing  No.  4703  produced  marked  P 17 by which  the  1st  Petitioner claims"
"to have come to reside at the Gomes  Path,  Colombo 05  address,  contains"
"her then  address described as follows:"
""" .... holder of National Identity Card  No.  72  519  1685 V of No.  352/4,"
"Millagahawatte, Ganemulla ... """
"This shows that the Petitioners had  not resided  at the relevant address"
"(No.  9/3, Gomes  Path,  Colombo 05)  before  2010-05-01  also.  This in turn"
"establishes that the averment by the 1st  Petitioner in  her Counter Affidavit"
"that the  Petitioners were  residing  in the ground floor when  said  Manel"
"Thilak Gunasinghe was occupying  the upper floor lacks credibility."
"It must also  be  borne in  mind that the Petitioners complaint is that the"
"rejection  of her application  by the school  authorities is wrong  because she"
"had  submitted the relevant indenture of lease  bearing  No.  4703  marked  P"
"17. It is not part of their case  before the school  authorities that they had"
"shared this house with  another family.  Further it is for the first time that"
"the  1st  Petitioner has taken  up such  a position  in  her counter affidavit after"
