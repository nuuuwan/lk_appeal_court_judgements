"It 
is 
contended 
by 
the 
counsel 
for 
the  Accused - Appellants"
"that 
the 
said  witness 
did 
identify 
the  Accused - Appellants"
"1n 
the 
identification 
parade 
as 
they  were 
shown 
to 
the"
"witness 
by 
the 
police  when 
the  Accused - Appellants 
were"
"arrested 
and 
was 
1n 
remand.  But 
said 
position 
was"
"vehemently 
denied 
by 
the  witness. 
Further 
it 
1S 
salient 
to"
"note 
that 
this 
position 
was 
taken 
up 
by 
the  Accused"
"Appellants 
only 
in the 
statement  made 
1n 
the 
dock.  The"
"above 
position  was 
never 
suggested 
to 
the  witness 
in 
the"
"course 
of 
the 
cross examination.  Besides 
it 
is 
pertinent 
to"
"note 
that 
the 
statement  made 
in 
an 
identification 
parade"
"is 
not 
substantive 
evidence 
and 
the 
determination 
of 
the"
"culpability  of 
the  Accused  will 
only  depend  on 
the 
evidence"
"transpired 
1n 
court. It  was  so  held 
in 
the 
case 
of  KIRTHEE"
"(2000)  2  SRI  L.R. 
247.  Hence 
this 
court 
BANDARA 
.VS.  AG"
"has 
taken 
serious  note 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
above  witness"
"identified 
the  Accused- Appellants 
from 
the 
features 
and 
the"
"said 
identification  was  not 
effected 
in 
difficult 
circumstances"
"and 
conditions."
"It  emanates 
from 
the 
deposition 
of 
the 
above  witness 
that"
"she  witnessed 
the 
alleged 
incident 
from 
the 
light 
that  was"
"burning 
and 
observing 
the  Accused - Appellants 
nearly 
for"
"the 
above 
circumstance 
there 
cannot 
3  minutes.  Therefore  1n"
"be 
a  mistake  as 
to 
the 
identity  of 
the  Accused - Appellants."
