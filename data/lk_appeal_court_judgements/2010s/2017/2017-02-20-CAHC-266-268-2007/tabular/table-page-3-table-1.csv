"The  story of the prosecution is  that on the  day  in question,  the  deceased"
"along  with  witness  Chaminda  Perera  had  proceeded 
to 
the  CWE 
to"
"purchase some provisions around  9.30 am.  Thereafter,  the  deceased had"
"walked about fifteen feet  ahead  of the witness and had crossed the  road."
"The  witness  was  prevented  from  crossing  the  road  by  a  van  which"
"passed  him.  The  witness  had  seen  the  Appellants  among  the  assailants."
"The witness had seen the Appellants attacking the deceased with knives."
"The  case  for  the  prosecution  rests  or  falls  on  the  evidence  of the  sole"
"eye-witness Chaminda Perera."
"Witness Chaminda Perera stated that the  Appellants were known to  him"
"for  15-16  years  and  has  categorically  stated 
that  he 
identified 
the"
"Appellants on the day in question."
"The medical evidence suggests that the deceased was attacked with more"
"than one weapon."
"Therefore,  the  Medical  evidence  corroborates  with  the  evidence  of the"
"sole eye-witness."
"The incident has  taken place during broad day-light and  the  eye-witness"
"had  known  the  Appellants  for  nearly  20  years.  This  in-fact  establishes"
"the identification of the Appellants by the witness."
"There has been an incident in which a bomb has been thrown which fact"
"proves the motive of the killing."
