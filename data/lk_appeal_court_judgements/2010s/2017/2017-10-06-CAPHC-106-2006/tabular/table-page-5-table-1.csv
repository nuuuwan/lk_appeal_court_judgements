"5"
"Perusal  of the application  filed  in the  Provincial  High  Court shows clearly"
"that the Appellant had  filed  the said  application  on  2001-02-23  requesting"
"the Court to quash  a decision taken  on  1999-09-11. Thus,  the Appellant is"
"clearly guilty of laches."
"In these circumstances,  the refusal  to grant a writ of certiorari  by the"
"Provincial  High  Court is justifiable. This Court sees  no  basis to interfere"
"with the said  finding. Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal"
"with  costs."
