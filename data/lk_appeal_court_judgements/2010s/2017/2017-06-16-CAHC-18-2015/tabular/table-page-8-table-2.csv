"faculties  therefore cannot be expected to  be attuned to  absorb the  details;"
"(3)  The  powers  of observation  differ  from  person  to  person.  What  one"
"may  notice,  another  may  not.  An  object  or movement  might  emboss  its"
"image  on  one person's  mind  whereas  it  might go  unnoticed on 
the part"
"of  another;

"of the  conversation. 
It is 
them.  They  can  only  recall  the  main  purport"
"unrealistic to  expect a witness to  be a human tape recorder;"""
