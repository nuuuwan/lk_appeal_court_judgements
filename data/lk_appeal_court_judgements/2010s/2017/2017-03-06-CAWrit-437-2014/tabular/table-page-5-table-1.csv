"of interviewers  thought  it  fit  to  promote  her  to  A6 
instead  of AS.  Further  the  same  was"
"placed  before  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation  and  decided  to"
"promote her to A6.  It is submitted that the Petitioner had not accepted the promotion given"
"to her to date.  Further she  had  informed the management by letter dated  10/07/2013 that"
"she cannot accept the promotion."
"Considering the facts  before the court  I am  of the  view that the  advertisement clearly says"
"that the promotion is  from A7  to AS.  According to the notes of the interview panel  which  is"
"attached to RS  reveals that the Petitioner is fit to promote to A6  and  recommendation  reads"
"as  follows:  lithe  interview  panel  recommends  to  promote  Mrs.  A.CD.  Silva  (9284)  to  the"
"post of Assistant  Operational  Manager grade  A6  w.e.f.  27/03/2013  and  after completion  of"
"one year at grade A6  with the recommendation of HOF to promote to the grade AS""  (sic)"
"Considering the materials before us,  I find the decision  and the recommendation  appears to"
"be  reasonable  and  humane,  the  interview  panel  could  have  refused  the  promotion  but  it"
"was  not  so.  Further  the  promotion  to  A6 
is 
time  lined  and  promotion  to  AS  was  clearly"
"recommended and  informed to the Petitioner."
"The  promotion was given on the 2ih March 2013, the Petitioner came  before the court was"
"on  the  19th  December  2014.  It  is  more  than  1  }'2  years.  She  had  not  purged  her default  or"
"explained 
the  circumstances 
for  her 
laches.  Further 
the  Petitioner  had  not  properly"
"prosecuted her petition before the court. I find the Petitioner guilty of laches."
"Considering  all  material  facts  before  the  court, 
I  find  that  the  relationship  between  the"
"Petitioner  and 
the  Respondent 
is  of  the  nature  of  Employer  -
Employee  contractual"
"the  Respondent  was  not  performing  a  public  duty  at 
this  given 
relationship.  Further"
"circumstances.  I also find that the undue delay of the Petitioner to come before this court is"
"not  explained  appropriately;  hence  the  Petitioner  is  guilty  of laches.  After  considering  all"
"circumstances,  I find that the Petitioner is  not entitled for any relief by way of a Writ. Court"
"refuses to grant any relief."
