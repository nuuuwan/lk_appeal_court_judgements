"The  High  Court of Colombo  upon an  application  for revision  filed  by the"
"Appellant has  inquired into this case.  The  High  Court after hearing  parties,"
"had  by its judgment dated 2011-03-21 affirmed the learned  Magistrate's"
"order and  had  proceeded to dismiss the  revision  application."
"It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed  this appeal  in  this"
"Court."
"Learned counsel  for the Appellant in the course of his argument conceded"
"that the Appellant does not have any permit for the occupation of the said"
"premises.  He  sought to argue that some  kind  of prior authority had  been"
"given to the Appellant by the Railways  Department."
"However as  has  been  mentioned earlier,  General  Manager of Railways  by"
"letter dated  2007-04-04,  has terminated  all  the agreements he  has  had"
"with the Appellant and  informed the Appellant to hand over the possession"
"of the premises. Thus it is  proved that the Appellant has failed to establish"
"that he  is  in  possession  or occupation  of the said  premises upon  any"
"written authority of the State granted in  accordance with any written law"
"and  that such  authority is  in  force and  not revoked  or otherwise rendered"
