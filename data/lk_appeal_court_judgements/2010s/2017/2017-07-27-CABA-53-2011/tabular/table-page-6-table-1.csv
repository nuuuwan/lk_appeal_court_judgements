"invalid as  required  by section  9 of the Act.  What the document dated  2007-"
"04-04 (marked X), establishes is that all  agreements with the Appellant"
"had  been  revoked."
"Both the learned  Magistrate as  well  as the  High  Court Judge have"
"considered  in their judgments the submission  made on  behalf of the"
"Appellant that there exists an  order to evict the Appellant in  a case"
"previously filed.  However the circumstances  intervened thereafter had"
"somehow paved  the way for the Appellant to continue in  the premises.  Be"
"that as  it may,  as it stands  now, the General  Manager of Railways by letter"
"dated  2007-04-04,  has terminated  all  the agreements  he  has  had  with the"
"Appellant.  Thus,  the existence of a previous order of eviction  is  not a bar"
"for the maintenance of this case as  has  been  held  rightly both  by the"
"Magistrate's Court and  the High  Court.  In any case  both the orders are to"
"the same effect,  namely orders for eviction. Therefore there is no  merit in"
"the submission on  behalf of the Appellant regarding  the application of the"
"principle of res judicata to these  proceedings."
