"Appellants  soon  after  the  incident,  with  the  relics,  in  the  middle  of the"
"night, at a bus stop. The identification of the Appellants by the head priest"
"of  the 
temple 
is 
unsatisfactory 
because 
he 
has 
admitted 
that 
the"
"Appellants  were  in the police station  and he  identified them  there  before"
"the  identification  parade. 
The  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  satisfied"
"with  the  circumstantial  evidence  that  the  Appellants  were  detected  soon"
"after  the 
incident  with  the  relics  and  held  that  the  charge  was  proved"
"beyond reasonable doubt.  The Accused Appellants  are not contesting the"
"conviction."
"All 
three  Accused  Appellants  were  young  persons 
at 
the 
time  of"
"committing the  offence.  They  were  married  persons  with  small  children."
