"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff-respondent  has  cited  a"
"case bearing No.  CA  Appeal 509/97(F)  decided on  17.06.2016.  A careful"
"consideration of that appeal will  show that the person in question in that"
"case was  declared  a  lunatic  by a  competent court.  Therefore,  the  above"
"case does not come within the four corners of this case and therefore has"
"to be distinguished in reference to the case in point."
