"her  clothes  and  penetrated.  When  a van  came  to  that  place,  he  withdrew  from  the  act."
"She also said  that the second appellant was standing little away with her sister. According"
"to her evidence the second  appellant was  riding  the bike and  he was  not involved  in  any"
"of  the  offensive  act.  Evidence  of  the  Prosecutrix  were  corroborated  by  her  sister  and"
"medical evidence."
"When  the first  accused  appellant took the virtual  complainant,  the second  appellant was"
"talking to the sister of the Prosecurix.  She  had  given evidence and  stated that the second"
"accused  had asked  her,  ""who are you  all,"" then the sister had told him that they are sisters"
"then  he  had  called  the first appellant and told  him ""Iet her go."""
"The  above  evidence on  record  shows  that the second  appellants was  not involved  in  the"
"act  of rape.  The  evidence  reveals  that  he  was  with  the first  appellant and  nothing  more."
"To convict a person under section 364 (2)  (g), there should be some evidence of abetment"
"must  be  proved.  But  in  this  case,  there  is  no  evidence  against  the  2nd  accused  appellant"
"and  he  had  told the first accused  to ""Iet her go"".  Therefore, we  conclude that there is  no"
"incriminatory  evidence  against  the  second  accused  appellant,  Viran  Hasantha  Balage."
"Accordingly, we  quash the conviction  and  acquit from the charge."
"Considering the grounds of appeal of the first accused appellant, we find that the available"
"evidence  before  the  court  is  sufficient  to  find  the  first  accused  guilty for the  charge  of"
"rape.  Findings of the learned trial judge on  count number one is  well founded, hence this"
"court affirms the said  conviction."
