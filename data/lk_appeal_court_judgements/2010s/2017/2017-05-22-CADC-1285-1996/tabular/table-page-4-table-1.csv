"signed the petition of appeal, though the signatory has quite inadvertently not"
"identified himself by name."
"(d) In the objections filed  on 06.01.1997 by the 95A Defendant-Respondent to the"
"appeal,  there  is  no  reference  to  the  maintainability  of this  appeal  and 
the"
"preliminary objection has been taken rather belatedly only on  11.03.2016."
"The  above  facts  and  circumstances  quite  unmistakably  lead  one  to  the  irresistible"
"inference that the 95A and  95A2 Defendant-Respondents entertain  no doubt at all as"
"to 
the 
identity  of 
the 
registered  attorney-at-law  who  has  acted 
for 
the  74A"
"Defendant-Appellant.  Though 
the  name  of  Mr.  Dickson  Gunawardena  does  not"
"appear  either  in  the  notice  of appeal  or  petition  of appeal,  that  omission  has  not"
"caused  any prejudice to the 95A and 95A2  Defendant-Respondents as the documents"
"filed  by  these  Respondents  show  quite  clearly  that  they  understand  Mr.  Dickson"
"Gunawardena to be the registered attorney-at-law of 74A Defendant-Appellant."
"Thus this Court finds no illegality in a petition of appeal that does not carry the name"
"of the  registered  attorney-at-law  when  there  is  material  to  show that the  one  and"
"the  same  registered  attorney-at-law  has  acted  for  the  Appellant  every  step  of the"
"way  in 
the  course  of  this 
litigation.  Section  755(1)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code"
"requires  a  signature  of the  appellant  or  his  registered  attorney-at-law  but  not  his"
"name, as  his identity can  be confirmed through the proxy and  other documents filed"
"in  the case  such  as  has  been  itemized  as  in this case.  In the same  way Section 755(3)"
"of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  requires  the  petition  of  appeal  to  be  signed  by  the"
"Appellant  or  his 
registered  attorney  and 
the  veracity  as 
to  whether 
it 
is 
the"
"registered  attorney who has signed the petition of appeal can  be  easily gleaned from"
"other documents inclusive of the proxy."
"It is not the contention of the Counsel for 95A and 95A2  Defendant-Respondents that"
"somebody else other than  Mr. Dickson  Gunawardena has signed the notice of appeal"
