"Mere general statements of witnesses that a party possessed the land in dispute for a number of"
"years  exceeding  the  prescriptive  period  are  not  evidence  of the  uninterrupted  and  adverse"
"possession  necessary to support a title by prescription.  It is  necessary that the witnesses should"
"speak  to specific facts  and  the  question  of possession  has  to be  decided  thereupon  by Court. 16"
"The 2nd  defendant stated that she came to vanrooyen estate, which adjoined the corpus, in  1947"
"with  her husband,  children  and  her father and  in  1948 they cleared  the  corpus  and  came  into"
"possession. 
I am  of the view that her evidence does  not establish that the 2nd  defendant began"
"adverse  possession  of the corpus in  1948 as  claimed.  On  the contrary her evidence  is  more akin"
"to a facile story of walking into abandoned premises after the Japanese air raid  which  material is"
"far too slender to found a claim  based  on  prescriptive titleY Her claim  to possession  in  1948 is"
"more  compatible  with  the  position  of  the  plaintiff  that  she  and  her  family  were  placed 
in"
"possession  by  Thomas  Dias  who  was 
the 
licensee  of  Cyril  Gunwardena.  At  the  most  the"
"commencement of the possession  of the 2nd  defendant in  1948 is  as  a licensee of Thomas  Dias."
