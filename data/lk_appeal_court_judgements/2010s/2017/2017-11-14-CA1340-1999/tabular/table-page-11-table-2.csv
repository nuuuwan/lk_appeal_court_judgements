"possess  it in  the  same  capacity.  Bertram  c.J.  in  Tillekeratne  v.  Bastian 18  explained  the effect of"
"this principle as  follows:"
"liThe  effect  of this  principle  is  that,  where  any  person's  possession  was  originally  not"
"adverse,  and  he  claims  that it has  become  adverse,  the  onus  is  on  him to prove  it.  And"
"what  must  he  prove?  He  must  prove  not  only  an 
intention  on  his  part  to  possess"
"adversely,  but a manifestation of that intention to the true owner against whom  he  sets"
"up his  possession. 
The  burden he  must assume  is,  in fact,  both definite and  heavy, and"
"the  authorities  have  been  accustomed 
to  emphasize 
its  severe  nature.  Thus, 
it 
is"
"sometimes said that he must prove an  II  overt unequivocal act II  (per Wendt J.  in Perera v."
"Menchi Nona).""19"
