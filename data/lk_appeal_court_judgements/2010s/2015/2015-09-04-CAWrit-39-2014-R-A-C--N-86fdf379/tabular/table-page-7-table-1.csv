"submitted that she was the only member of the staff to whom this separate book was allocated to."
"However the  Petitioner continued to  sign on both book including the  Administrative  Register as"
"she  feared  that  the  loss  or  interference  with  such  separate  book  would  put  any  record  of her"
"the  Registrar  has  ordered  her  not 
to 
sign 
in 
the 
regular  attendance 
in  doubt.  By  P-12"
"Administrative  Register  since  she  is  holding  a  post  which  entitles  to  a  'B'  grade  salary  and  to"
"sign in the register provided to her."
"The  court  observed  this  document  as  an  unusual  letter,  since  he  has  taken  trouble  to  send  this"
"handwritten letter to  the Petitioner, without following the  proper procedure to communicate such"
"directive."
"The Petitioner had submitted before this court a series of events which followed,  according to  the"
"Petitioner, a result of Petitioner's refusal to concede to certain advances by the said Register, but"
"we  are  not  going 
to  address  our  mind 
to 
such 
instances  since  our  role 
is 
limited 
in 
this"
"that 
the  Petitioner  made  several  attempts

transfer  from

"As  I  have  discussed  earlier  the  Petitioner  was  seconded  with  effect  from  2.10.2006 
to 
the"
"Medical Faculty of Kelaniya and was attached to the Department of Community Medicine."
"On  16th  March  2007  the  Dean  of the  Medical  Faculty  on  directions  he  received  from  the  Vice"
"Chancellor and  the  Registrar of Kelaniya  University  had  written  to  the  Head of the  Department"
"of Community Medicine,  directing him  to  hand  over the  attendance  register of the  Petitioner  to"
"the  assistant  registrar's  office  with  a  direction  to 
the  Petitioner  to  sign  at 
the  register  at  the"
"assistant registrar's office.  This court observes that this  is the starting point of the dispute which"
"arose between the Petitioner and the University Administration over signing of attendance by the"
"Petitioner.  As  observed  by  this  court  it  is 
the  Registrar  of  the  University  of  Kelaniya  who"
"directed  by an  unusual  letter the  Petitioner to  sign  a  separate  register when she  was  signing her"
"'B' 
attendance  in  the  Administrative  Register  since  she  is  holding  a  post  which  entitled  to  a"
"grade salary. The same registrar thereafter called for  the  separate attendance register used by the"
"Petitioner to  sign her attendance by withdrawing it though  the  Dean of the  Medical Faculty, and"
"thereafter got her to sign in the register used by the support staff."
