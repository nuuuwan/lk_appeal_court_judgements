"This court further  observes that  the  Petitioner by letter dated 06.02.1996 requested  the  U.G.C to"
"consider her confirmation on the  basis of the  said circulate  and  thereafter the  Commission by its"
"letter  dated  18.11.1996  confirmed 
the  Petitioner  with  effect 
from  30.01.1992 
in  Assistant"
"Statistician grade II."
"However the  Learned Counsel for  the  Respondent had  challenged the said letter before this court"
"and argued that, nowhere in the circular are the words ""academic staff' used.  This was  a circular"
"of the  U.G.c. dealing the  recruitment,  confirmation and  promotion of Lectures,  Senior  Lectures"
"and corresponding Library staff."
"The  circular  marked  no  reference  to  statisticians  Learned  President's  Counsel's reliance  to  this"
"circular 
is  disingenuous.  The  section  he 
relies  on 
is  section  2A  (b)  which  states 
that 
the"
"postgraduate  qualification  required  can  be  a  diploma.  A  diploma 
is  all 
that 
the  Petitioner"
"possesses. But the  title of this section speaks about the  confirmation a probationary Lecturer and"
"it says nothing about confirmation to  the  Academic Support Staff who  are  keen  to  be confirmed"
"in the academic staff."
"However this court observes the final paragraph of P- 6b to the effect ""You are  Kindly requested"
"to  satisfy  above  requirement  for  the  purpose  of considering  you  for  confirmation  in  the  post  of"
"Assistant Statistician Grade II  and of the view that the U.G.C had informed in no  uncertain terms"
"that she would be  confirmed in  her post only if she satisfies the  required  qualification. Therefore"
"when 
the  Petitioner  requested 
to  consider  her  confirmation  based  on  P-7  and 
the  U.G.C"
"confirmed her in the  post of Assistant Statistician by  P-9  cannot be  disputed now,  and  this court"
