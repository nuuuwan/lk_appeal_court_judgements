SIX  months  ngorous"
"imprisonment  and  also  compensation  of  Rs.  20,000/  in  default 
of one  year"
"rigorous  imprisonment.  The  learned  High  Court Judge  has further  ordered  for"
"the above sentences to run consecutively."
"The  said  accused  was  later  apprehended  and  produced  before  the  High"
"Court of Vauniya in December 2009.  When the matter was taken up before the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  on  16.12.2009  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"held  a 
241  (3)  inquiry and concluded that he is not satisfied with the material"
"placed  before  the  Court  and  therefore  pronounced  the  judgment  which  has"
"already  been made by the learned High Court Judge on the accused."
"Counsel appearing for  the Accused-Appellant submits that she will"
"not be  canvassing the  conviction  before  this  court but only  be  canvassing  the"
"sentence.  She  submits  that  suspect was  only  17  years  of the  age  at  the  time"
"when 
the  offence  committed  and  also 
submits 
that 
the  victim  who 
is  a"
"neighbour of the suspect,  used to visit the suspect's  house very often. The day"
"in  question 
the  victim  visited  the  house  of the  accused  and  at that  time  the"
"suspect had requested  the  victim  to  make  an  egg  for  him and thereafter while"
"she was making the egg he had raped 
this girl.  Counsel submits that both the"
"offences referred to  in the indictment are interwoven  and therefore if the court"
"can  make  the  said  two  orders  to  run  concurrently that will  meet 
the  ends  of"
"justice."
