"The fact that the petitioner appealed to  the  15t  respondent against the  decision clearly  shows that"
"she was aware ofthe determination made to issue a license.  The 5th  respondent also has submitted"
"that he has invested on water pumps, timber, implements such as mammoties necessary for mining"
"and building of huts for the workers and also have employed 30 people for the Gemming operation."
"That if court issued an interim order it will cause much prejudice and hardship to the 5th respondent,"
"but we observe that the 5th  respondent had carried out operation on the license issued even during"
"the period it was under suspension and therefore we cannot agree with the above submission."
"We are ofthe view that as there is a partition case pending that if the 5th  respondent is allowed to"
"clear the land and involved in gemming operation that grave and irremediable damage and injustice"
"would occur to the petitioner and the Co-Owners of the land in dispute."
