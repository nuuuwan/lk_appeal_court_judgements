"Based on the  defence version in  this case,  counsel for  the  Accused- Appellant had  moved us  to  consider"
"the  decisions  in  Agampodi  Samantha  de  Zoysa  V.  The Attorny  General  CA  83/97  decided  by  the"
"Court of Appeal on 27.10.1998 (unreported) and reduce the sentence imposed on the Accused -Appellant."
"We  see  no  reason  to  follow  the  decision  in  the  above  case  since  the  circumstances  under  which  the"
"sentence was reduced in the above case has no  relevance to  the present case."
"For the  reasons adduced above we see no reason to interfere with the decision of the Learned Trial Judge."
"Therefore I affirm the conviction and sentence imposed by the  Learned High Court Judge."
"Appeal is dismissed."
