"•","By failing to  apply the legal criteria and principles to be borne in mind when evaluating a"
"","case based on circumstantial evidence where the evidence where the eventual inference a"
"","court could  draw  should be  ""an irresistible  inference  from  which there  is  no  escape and"
"","further that such an inference should only be consistent and compatible not only with his"
"","guilt but incompatible with any other inferences 1 hypothesis suggesting innocence."
"•","By failing to correctly apply the legal principals set out in respect of the probative value of"

"","explain to  the ""satisfaction of the court"" important items of evidence placed before court"
"","by the prosecution in instances where the  court expects a clear explanation to  the  serious"
"","allegations made; thereby the accused failing to rebut the case for the prosecution resulting"
"","in the bolstering and confirming the allegations made against him."
