"Petitioner before support of this application, by motion dated 91h  March 2015 submitted this court the"
"Original Document of P-3, P-4, P-5, P-6, P-7, P-8, P-9 and a Certified Copy of P-2."
"Rule 3 (1) (a) of the  Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rule  1990 reads as follows;"
"""Every application made  to  the  Court of appeal  for  the  exercise  of the  powers vested  in  the"
"Court  of Appeal  by  Articles  140  and  141  of the  constitution  shall  be  by  way  of petition,  together"
"with  an  affidavit in  support of the  averments  there  in,  and  shall  be  accompanied  by the  originals of"
"documents  material  to  such  application  (or  duly  certified  copies  thereof)  in  the  form  of exhibits."
"Where a petitioner is unable  to  tender any such document, he shall state  the  reason for such inability"
"and  seek  the  leave  of the  court  to  furnish  such  document  later.  Where  a  petitioner fails  to  comply"
"with  the  provisions  of this  rule  the  court may,  ex  mero motu or at  the  instance  of any party dismiss"
"such application."
"Since  the  Petitioner has  complied  with  the  above  rule  prior to  support  his  application,  I proceed  to"
"overrule 
the  objections  raised  by 
the  Respondent  under  Rule  3  (1 )  (a)  of  the  Court  of Appeal"
"(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990."
"The  main  preliminary  objections  raised  by  the  Respondents  were  based  on  the  ground,  where  the"
"relief prayed  for  by  the  Petitioner cannot be  granted  for  either  non  maintainability of the  prayer or"
"misconceived nature of the prayer."
"In  support of this position respondents  have  filed  detailed written submissions, before  this  Court.  In"
"the  written  submission  the  respondents  have  gone  in  detail  to  each  of the  prayer,  and  discussed  at"
"length whether this court could grant the relief as prayed in each of the prayer."
"However this  court is  of the  view that  it is  too  early for  this  court to  look into each of the  prayer at"
"this  stage and  decide whether, a writ will  lie  in each situation, since that  should  be  the  duty of court"
"at  the  final  hearing. However this court is of the  view that we  should look in  to  the  objections raised"
"on prayer (g) and (h) only, since they refer to  interim relief against the 71 s1  Respondent."
"Whilst  objecting 
to 
the 
relief  being  granted  as  prayed 
in 
the  above  paragraphs, 
respondents"
"to  demonstrate  the 
imminent  presence  of an  Ultra  Vires 
submitted  that  the  petitioner  has  failed"
"Decision. As evident by P-8  the  lSI  Respondent requested  the petitioner to  prove whether he  has the"
"support of the  majority of the  members of the  council. When referred  to  Proviso to  Article  154F (4)"
"we  observe  that  there  is  no  necessacity  for  the  lSI  Respondent  to  make  such  request,  and  therefore"
"this  court is  of the  view that  by producing P-8  the  petitioner has  demonstrated  before  this  court that"
