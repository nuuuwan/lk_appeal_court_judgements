"Further the learned Counsel for the appellant had  marked the following contradictions and"
"omissions in the victim's evidence to show that she  is  not a credible witness."
"In  the  High  Court the victim  had  stated  that she  was  washing  clothes.  She  felt pain  in"
"her chest then she came and slept. Then after the appellant came and tied her legs and"
"hands,  put a piece of cloth in  her mouth and  committed the sexual  act."
"To  the doctor she  had  not stated  that the  sexual  act  was  performed  after her hands"
"and  legs were tied."
"She had  not stated to the police that her hands and  legs were tied at that time (she had"
"admitted this fact in the High  Court)."
