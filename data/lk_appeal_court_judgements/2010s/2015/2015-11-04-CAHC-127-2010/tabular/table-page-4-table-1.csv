"the deceased was seen with the appellant and the time of death, thereby excluding the possibility"

"according to the  information he had received the  body had been recovered around  11.30 am  and"
"that he  agrees  with  such conclusion.  It was  submitted that this  is  wholly hearsay  and the  police"
"evidence is that they received information about the body being found in an abandoned house only"
"at  3.15  pm.  Accordingly  it  was  submitted  that the  prosecution has  totally  failed  to  fix  the  exact"
"time in the instant case.  It was also submitted that the afore said evidence of the Medical Officer"
"is  not  calculated  according  to  any  acceptable  forensic  methods  and  that  the  doctor  had  merely"
"stated  that  he  agrees  with  the  information  provided  relating  to  time  of death  which  is  wholly"
"unacceptable as the time of death has to be assessed by any of the following methods .."
