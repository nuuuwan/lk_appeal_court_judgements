and 
Independent  Television  Network 
.  This 
court"
"observes 
that the  Petitioner has now been  issued  with  a 
valid  route"
"permit  by  the  Western  Province  Passenger  Transport  Authority,  but"
"this fact 
is suppressed from  this court.  We  find  that this suppression"
"is 
on  a  material  fact. 
We  are  mindful  of the  decision  in  Alphonso"
"Appuhamy  V.  Hettiarachchi  77  NLR  131  at  135  where  it  was  held"
"that a  full  and fair disclosure of all  the material facts  has to be placed"
"before  court  when  an  application  for  writ  or  injunction  is  made  and"
"the  process  of court  is  invoked.  Therefore,  we 
are  not  inclined 
to"
"grant relief as  prayed  by  the  Petitioner.  We 
decide 
to  dismiss  this"
