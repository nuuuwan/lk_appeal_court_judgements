"Sec.  181 of the Civil  Procedure Code  reads as  follow;"
"Section  181; Affidavit shall  be  confined  to the statement of such  facts  as  the  declarant"
"is able of his own knowledge and  observation to testify to, ......"
"It is  therefore,  understood that the  affidavit should  only contain  facts  which  are  within"
"the declarants  own knowledge and  observations."
"When  both  those 
provisions  are  taken  together it is  clear that a person 
should  not"
"affirm  to  an 
affidavit  without  his  own  personal  knowledge  and 
therefore, 
it  is  not"
"necessary 
to  specifically  state 
in 
the  affidavit 
that 
the  declarant  has  a  personal"
"knowledge with regard to the facts referred to in the affidavit."
"On  the other hand Sec.  3(1)(a)  as  discussed  earlier only requires,  an  affidavit in  support"
"of the  averment  therein  and  rule  does  not  specifically  speaks  of declarants  personal"
"knowledge  but it is  understood that the  requirement  under Sec.  181  has  to be  fulfilled"
"when  an  affidavit is  submitted."
"In 
the  case  of  Kobbekaduwa  V.  Jayawardena  1983 
I  Sri  LR  416  the  Supreme  Court"
"observed  that  liThe  function  of an  affidavit  is  to verify the  fact  alleged  in  the  Petition."
"The  affidavit Furni- shes  prima facie  evidence of the facts  deposed to in  the affidavit.  In"
"an  affidavit  a person  can  depose  only to facts  to which  he  is  able  to testify of his  own"
"knowledge and  observation"""
"Even  on  this decision there  is  no finding to the effect that the petitioner has to state in"
"the  affidavit 
that  the 
facts  affirm  are 
from  his  personal  knowledge  and 
from 
the"
"documents perused."
"With  regard  to the admissibility of the affidavit,  Respondent  referred  to the decision  in"
"Kumarasiri  and  another Vs.  Rahjapakshe  2006  I Sri  LR  359  but I see  no  relevance  in  this"
"decision  to  the  objection  raised,  since  this  decision  only  refers  to  a Jurat  under  Oaths"
"and  Affirmation Ordinance."
"For the reason  adduced above I overrule this objection."
