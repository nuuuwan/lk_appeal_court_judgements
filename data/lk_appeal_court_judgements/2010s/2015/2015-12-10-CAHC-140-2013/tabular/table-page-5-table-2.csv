"indictment as  the period in  which the offence took place."
"Furthermore, according to the brief history given  by  the victim to the doctor it is  evident"
"that her childhood  was  not a pleasant one  as  she  had  been  assaulted  by the people with"
"whom her mother left her and also she  had  been  prevented from going to school. Further,"
"as  per her evidence, she was threatened by the appellant not to tell this to anyone and  he"
"had  done it by showing a knife and telling that he will kill  her if she does so. Therefore, it is"
"evident that the victim was living with a lot of fear and  pressure. Furthermore, with all that,"
"she  was  also facing  a very harsh  series  of incidents. So  we  cannot expect a clear  memory"
"with  regard  to the exact dates on  which  she  faced  these incidents from  a victim  like  this."
"Furthermore, in  the courts also she  had  said  that she  cannot exactly remember the dates"
"on  which  she faced those incidents (vide page 48 of the brief)."
