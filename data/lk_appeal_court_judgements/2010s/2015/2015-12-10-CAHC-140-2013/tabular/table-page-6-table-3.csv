"the period during which PW 2 was abroad and that PW 2 came to know about this incident"
"when she  came back to Sri  Lanka  in  2004."
"However,  the argument for the  learned  Counsel  for the appellant in  this  regard  was  that"
"the  PW  2  in  her evidence  has  not mentioned anything about the incident that had  taken"
"place. According to her, the victim  had  only told her that the appellant had  come close to"
"the victim wearing an  underwear (vide page 65 of the brief). Apart from that there was  no"
"evidence given  by the PW  2 with regard to the incident. According to this evidence it does"
"not reveal the fact that the appellant has  committed any offence to the victim."
