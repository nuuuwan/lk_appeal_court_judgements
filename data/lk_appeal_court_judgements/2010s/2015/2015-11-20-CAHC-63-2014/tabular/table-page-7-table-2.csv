"his testimony on that score alone, court must inquire into the reason for"
"the delay and  if the reason  for the delay is  plausible  and justifiable the"
"court could act on the evidence of a belated witness."""
"In this case the victim has given a plausible reason for the delay in making"
"a complaint to the police.  In  fact the evidence of the victim shows that"
"he  never  intended  to make  a complaint about this  incident to anyone."
"But  after  some  time  due  to  circumstances  beyond  his  control  he  was"
"compelled to divulge the said incident to the police. One cannot say that"
"the  victim  wanted  to falsely  implicate  the  accused-appellant  due  to  a"
"third party's intervention."
"The  entire case  revolves  around and  rests  on  the testimony of victim of"
"this case  witness  Madushanka.  It is  well established  that conviction  can"
"be  based  on  the testimony of a single  witness  provided the court finds"
"from scrutiny of his evidence that he is wholly a reliable witness. The trial"
"Judge  has  come  to  such  a  favourable  finding  in  favour  of the  witness"
