"It is clear that the victim had not wanted to divulge the said incident that"

"embarrassment. The victim has clearly stated that he felt shy to disclose"
"this even  to his  friend Ajith. The victim  has  clearly said  that he  decided"
"not to divulge this to anyone but one day when he was studying together"
"with Kamal  he questioned him about it and he thought that Kamal  knew"
"something about the incident and thereafter he  told everything to him."
"It is  very  clear  from  the testimony given  by  the victim  that  he  did  not"
