"the  inquiry conducted  by  the  5th  Respondent was  ultra vires  because  the  5th  Respondent  has"
"no jurisdiction  to  determine  whether  a  person  claiming  to  be  a  tenant  cultivator  is  in  fact  a"
"tenant  cultivator  or not.  His  argument  is  that  it  is  only  a  competent  Court  of Law  that  can"
"determine the said issue.  His argument is  that the 4th  Respondent can decide disputes between"
"the  landlord  and  the  tenant  cultivator  under  the  Agrarian  Development  Act No  46  of 2000,"
"only  if the  parties admit such relationship between them.  He cites the case of Herath  vs.  Peter"
"[1989]  2 Sri  L R 325, which  followed  the  unreported judgment of Dolawatte vs.  Gamage and"
"another  (SC  appeal  No  45/83  SC  minute  of 27.09.85.  which  was  attached as  an  annexure  to"
"the judgment)."
