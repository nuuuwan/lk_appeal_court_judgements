"","Initially the Attorney General had indicted the accused-appellant in the High Court of"
"","Vavuniya on each count for the offence of criminal misappropriation coupled with an"
"","offence against public property - offences punishable under Section 386 of the Penal"
"","Code to be  read with Section 5(1) of Offences against the Public Property Act No. 12"
"","of 1982 as amended by the Act No. 76 of 1988."
"","The  accused-appellant  was  served  with the indictment on  8th  September 2004 and"
"","thereafter this case  had  been  called  on  several  dates  until  12th  July  2012 when  the"
"","accused-appellant  indicated  to  Court  that  she  had  deposited  the  relevant  amount"
"","specified in the respective indictments. In  other words there had  been  restitution of"
"","the  moneys  that  had  been  misappropriated.  Subsequent  to  these  restitutionary"
"","payments the  cases  had  come  up  on  11th  September 2012  when  the State  Counsel"
"","moved  to  amend  the  indictment  under  Section  167  (1)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"","Procedure Act to have the offences against the Public  Property Act withdrawn. The"
"","effect ofthese amendments was that the Accused-appellant had to face only offences"
"","under Section  386 of the  Penal  Code.  Consequently the accused-appellant  pleaded"
"","guilty to the amended indictments on 4th October 2012, whereupon the learned High"
"","Court Judge had proceeded to convict the Accused-appellant on the plea so recorded."
"","Thereafter the counsel for the accused-appellant had made submissions in mitigation"
"","of the sentence  and  the State  Counsel  in  reply  left the question of sentence to the"
"","discretion  of the High  Court Judge  without having  made  barely any submissions  on"
