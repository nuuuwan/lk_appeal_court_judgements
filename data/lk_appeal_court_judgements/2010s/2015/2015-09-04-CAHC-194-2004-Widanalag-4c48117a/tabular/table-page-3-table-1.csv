"Criminal  Procedure  Code, 
the  position  taken  up  by  the  Accused  was"
"that he was unaware of warrant issued against him.  The Accused  had"
"not  taken  any  step  to  explain  his  absence  beyond  that.  However  the"
"learned Counsel representing 
the Accused-Appellant  before this court"
"submits  that  when  the  241 (i) 
inquiry  was  proceeding  in 
the  High"
"Court,  the  prosecution  had  called  for  the  evidence  of a  Gramasevaka"
"who was not 
in charge of the  area the Accused was living  prior to  his"
"disappearance.  Counsel submits that when the  Accused 
left the  area"
"he  informed  the  relevant  Gramasevaka, 
the  area  he  is  going  to  stay"
"but due to the above  mistake i.e.  failure  by the prosecution to call 
the"
"correct Gramasevaka,  the correct facts were not placed before the High"
"Court. 
The  said  decision  to  proceed 
in 
absentia  was  made  without"
"proper material  being  placed  before  the  Court.  However we  observed"
"that the  wife  of the Accused-Appellant too  was  summoned at the  said"
"241  inquiry  before 
the  Learned Trial  Judge.  We  further  observe 
that"
"when the Accused-Appellant  was  apprehended  in  2011  and produced"
"before  High  Court  he  has  not  taken  up  this  position  i.e.  the  position"
"taken up by the counsel before this court."
