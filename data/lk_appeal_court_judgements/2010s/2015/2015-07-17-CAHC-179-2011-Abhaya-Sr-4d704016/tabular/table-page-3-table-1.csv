"Whilst challenging the above conviction and sentence, Accused- Appellant raised six Grounds of Appeal"
"during the Argument before us."
"1.  The  Learned  Trial 
Judge  misdirected 
the 
Jury  by 
stating 
that 
the  Medical  Evidence"
"corroborated witness Isuru"
"2. 
The  Learned  Trial Judge  has  failed  to  warn  the  jury  after clearly  inadmissible  evidence  had"
"been led"
"3.  The Learned Trial Judge had  told the jury that witnesses had seen Guruge  dressed  in a white"
"trouser leaving the scene in a bicycle when there was n 0  such evidence, and without drawing"
"the jury to  the infirmities in the evidence of the witnesses who say so"
"4. 
The  Learned  Trial 
Judge 
failed 
to 
direct 
the 
jury  on 
the 
legal 
position 
regarding"
"circumstantial  evidence,  when  there  is  a  strong possibility  that  Isuru' s  evidence  could  have"
"been rejected and the attention of the jury would have been focused on the items belonging to"
"the accused found at the  scene"
"5.  The Learned Trial Judge failed  to place before the jury the factual positions that are  in favour"
"of the defence"
"6. 
The  Learned Trial  Judge  failed  to  give  proper direction  to  the jury on  the  alibi  taken  by  the"
"defence"
"In  addition  to  the  above  grounds  of appeal,  another  ground  to  the  effect,  that  the  Accused- Appellant"
"was  deprived of knowing the  verdict of the jury when they  were first  ready  to  deliver their verdict,  was"
"raised by the Accused- Appellant in  the written submissions."
"the  Learned  President's  Counsel  for 
the  Accused- Appellant 
In  support  of  this  additional  ground,"
"submitted 
that the  failure  to  ask  the jury as  to  how they  were  divided,  and  instead directing the  jury to"
"reconsider  their verdict had  deprived  the  accused  of knowing 
the  verdict  of the  jury  when  they  were"
"first ready to deliver their verdict."
