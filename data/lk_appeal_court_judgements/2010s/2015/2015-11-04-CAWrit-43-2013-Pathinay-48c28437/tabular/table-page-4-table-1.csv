"","The argument of the  State Counsel before this court was that this court cannot grant the  relief as prayed"
"","by Petitioner since it will be inconsistent with ruling of this court in the Restitutio in intergrum action."
"","We agree with the  position taken up by the  Learned State Counsel on this point.  In the said Restitutio in"
"","intergrum  action  this  court  refused  to  set  aside  a  settlement  reach  before  this  court.  While  the  said"
"","judicially sanctioned settlement is  in force,  it is  not correct for  this court to  issue a Writ directing the  15t"
"","and  the  2nd  Respondents  to  issue  a  permit  to  the  Petitioner for  the  entire  land  referred  to  in  document"
"","marked P-l."
"","The second argument raised by  the  Learned State Counsel was that,  the  Petitioner is guilty of laches.  In"
"","the  case of Biso Menika  V.  Cyril de Alwis and Others (1982)  1 Sri LR 368 Sharvananda CJ observed."
"","""the  proposition  that the  application  for  Writ  must  be  sought  as  soon  as  injury  is  caused  is  merely  an"
"","application  of the  equitable  doctrine  that  delay  defeats  equity  and  the  longer  the  injured  person  sleeps"
"","over his  rights  without  any  reasonable  excuse  the  chances  of his  success  in  a Writ  application dwindle"
"","and the court may reject a Writ application on the ground of unexplained delay."""
"","As pointed out by me  earlier,  this court had made order dismissing the  Restitutio in  intergrum action on"
"","24th  May 2010.  Present application was filed  before this court on 22nd  February 2013. The Petitioner has"
"","waited for 3 years to file  the present application. He has failed to explain his delay before this court."
"","I  have  no  reason  to  reject  the  above  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  Learned  State  Counsel.  The"
"","Petitioner  could  not  meet  the  said  argument  but  instead  had  submitted  that  the  said  settlement  was"
"","reached without the consent of the Petitioner."
"","However  in  the  absence  of any  judicial  announcement  to  that  effect  this  court  cannot  agree  with  the"
"","contention of the Petitioner."
"","For the  reason adducted above I decide  to  up  hold  the preliminary objection raised by the  Learned State"
"","Counsel and to  dismiss the present application."
