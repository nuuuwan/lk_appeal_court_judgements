"(2}That the land  is  in the possession of the defendant."
"The  moment the title of the  plaintiff is  admitted or proved the  right to"
"possess it, is  presumed."
"In D.A Wanigarate V. Juwanis Appuhamy 65 N.L.R 168, it was held that in"
"an  action  rei-vindicatio the plaintiff should  set out his title on  the  basis"
"on  which  he  claims  a declaration  of title to the  land  and  must  in  court"
"prove that title against the defendant in the action. The defendant in  rei"
"vindication  action  need  not prove  anything,  still  less,  his  own  title. The"
"plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in  his favour merely on  the"
"strength that the defendant's title is poor or not established. The plaintiff"
"must prove and establish his title."
