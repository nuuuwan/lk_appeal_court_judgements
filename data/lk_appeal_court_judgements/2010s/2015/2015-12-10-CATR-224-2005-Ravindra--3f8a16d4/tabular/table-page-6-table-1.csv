"As  admitted  by  both parties  before this court the  Accused- Applicant was facing  an  Indictment  before  High"
"Court No.6 of High Court of Colombo. The said case bearing No.  5480/11 was in its concluding stages. The"
"said  trial  had  proceeded  before  the  High  Court  No.6,  in 
the  absence  of  the  Accused.  However  he  was"
"represented  by  counsel  throughout  the  trial.  Section  241  of the  Code  of Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.  15  of"
"to  proceed 
in 
the  absence  of  an  Accused,  provided 
the  Accused  person  can 
1979  provides  for  a  trial"
"consented to  be  represented by a counsel."
"Whether  the  Accused  was  genuinely  wanted  to  come  before  court  and  fight  out  the  case  could  only  be"
"revealed  if he  had  come  before  the  court  on  25.05.2015  without  getting arrested prior to  that.  Even  though"
"the  High  Court  Judge  in  Court  No.6  in  her  order  refusing  bail  had  referred  to  the  fact  that  the  counsel"
"undertook to produce the suspect before court on arrival to  Sri Lanka, it is not borne out from the case record"
"and therefore, it is  not fair to consider the said ground against him."
"Respondents  have  challenged  the  manner  in  which  the  bail  obtained  from  the  High  Court,  specially,  the"
"failure  by  the  Accused-Appellant to  file  papers to  revise the order dated 02.04.2015  in  the  appropriate court,"
"to  take 
and  to  go  before the  High  Court on a different ground, but without waiting for  the  Permanent Judge"
"up  the  matter,  supported  the  matter  before  an  Acting  High  Court  Judge  when  there  is  specific  order  by"
"another  acting  High  Court  Judge  to  have  this  matter  mentioned  on  22.04.2015  the  first  working  day  of the"
"term before the  Permanent High Court Judge."
"This court on  careful perusal of the sequence of events took place since 02.04.2015, of the view that the most"
"appropriate conduct would be either the Accused-Applicant to  file  revision papers or considering the  urgency"
"of the matter waited for another two days to go  before the same High Court Judge."
"However,  the  question  before  this  court at  this stage is  not  the  conduct of the Accused in obtaining bail,  but"
"the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  when  implementing  the  said  order  acted  impartially  without  bias  since  the"
"main trial against the Accused-Applicant is going to be decided by the same High Court Judge."
"The main contention of the  Learned Counsel for the Accused-Applicant before this court was  that in  view of"
