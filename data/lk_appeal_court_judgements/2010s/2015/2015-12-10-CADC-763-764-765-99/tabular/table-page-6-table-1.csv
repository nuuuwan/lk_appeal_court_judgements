"event,  lot  4  alone  forms  the  corpus.  Whether  the  land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned  is 
lot  4  or  lot  1-4,  the  Eastern  boundary  in  either  case 
is"
"Madugahamulahena according to the said plan X.  Likewise the Southern"
"boundary would remain  as  Hitinawatta."
"It  was  contended  on  behalf  of  the  6A  defendant-appellant  that  the"
"schedule to the plaint and the deeds of the plaintiff-respondent describe"
"the Northern boundary of the corpus as  Undiyaralage watta. However, a"
"that  the  Northern 
perusal  of  the  preliminary  plan  marked  X  reveals"
"boundary  of the  corpus  as  depicted  therein  is  described  as  not  only"
"found 
in 
the  schedule 
to  the  plaint  and 
the 
Undiyaralage  watta  as"
"plaintiff-responded  deeds,  but  also  as  Gederawatta  belonging  to  the"
"plaintiff-respondent himself. It was the contention of the counsel for the"
"6a  defendant-appellant  that  as 
the  Northern  boundary  of  lots  1-3  in"
"preliminary plan  marked X is  Gederawatta and  not Undiyaralage watta,"
"in  the  absence  of any  compelling  reason,  prima  facie  the  said  lots  1-3"
"would fall outside the corpus."
