"The 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  accused-appellants  submitted 
that  the"
"charge  against  the  pt accused-appellant  cannot  be  maintained  as  the"
"evidence is  insufficient."
"In  Queen  V.  Vincent  Fernando  65  N.L.R  265  Basnayake,  J.  stated  as"
"follows:-"
"""A person  who merely shares the criminal  intention, or takes a fiendish"
"delight in  what is  happening  but does  no criminal  act in  furtherance of"
"the common intention of all  is not liable for the acts of the others. To  be"
"liable under section 32 a mental sharing of the common intention is  not"
"sufficient,  the  sharing  must  be  evidenced  by  a  criminal  act.  The  Code"
"does  not  make  punishable  a  mental  state  however  wicked  it  may  be"
"unless  it is  accompanied  by a criminal  act which  manifests the state of"
"mind."""
"In  the  case  of Ariyaratne  V.Attorney General  S.C  31/92  SCM  15.11.93,"
"G.P.S.de Silva  ,J.  has  reiterated that the inference of common  intention"
"must  be  not merely a possible  inference,  but an  inference from  which"
"there is  no escape. The facts  revealed that, the principal witness speaks"
"only of the pt accused-appellant handing over a knife immediately prior"
"to the  incident  to the  2nd  accused  scolding  and  watching  the  incident"
"from the veranda  of his  house  which  was  about 40 feet from the  place"
"of  the 
incident.  There 
is  no  evidence  whatsoever  as 
to  under  what"
"circumstances  the  said  knife was  given  to the  2nd  accused-appellant  by"
"the pt accused-appellant."
