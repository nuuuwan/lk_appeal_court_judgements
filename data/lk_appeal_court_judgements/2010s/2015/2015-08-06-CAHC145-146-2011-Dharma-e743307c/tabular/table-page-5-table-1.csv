"the  two  deceased  were  brutally killed  by whoever is  responsible  for  the"
"killing  of  those 
two. 
However,  what 
is 
important 
to 
this  Court 
to"
"consider  at  this  point  is,  whether  there  was  a  commotion  or  a 
fight"
"between  the  two  deceased  and  for  the  reason  that the  1 st  accused  was"
"actively 
taking  part 
in 
the  house  of  Ariyadasa  without  an 
iota  of"
"evidence 
to  show  that  there  was  previous  enmity  between 
the 
two"
"parties. 
The  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  too  agreed  that  the"
"learned trial Judge has failed  to  appreciate  this aspect in  his judgment"
"but requested the Court be mindful of the brutal act which resulted the"
"death of the two deceased in this case."
