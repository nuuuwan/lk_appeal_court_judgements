"would be theft."
"In  my  opinion,  therefore  in  order  to  constitute  misappropriation  under  our  law  it  is  not  necessary  that"
"there  should  be  an  innocent  initial  taking.  If the  initial  taking  of the  property  not  in  the  possession  of"
"anyone  is  dishonest  then  too  the  offence  is  made  out.  In  regard  to  this,  I agree  with the  view expressed"
