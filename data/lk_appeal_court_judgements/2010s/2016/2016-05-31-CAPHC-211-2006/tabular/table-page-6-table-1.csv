"This  litigation was started in the year 2004 and it has already taken"
"12 years.  Section 67(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act provides that"
"an inquiry under that chapter shall bring to an end within three months. A"
"determination  under  chapter  vii  of the  Act  is  a  temporary  measure  to"
"prevent the  breach  of peace  until the  rights  of parties  are  finally  decided"
"in a competent civil Court.  As such it is  not fair by the parties to send this"
"case for re inquiry."
