"In  the  instant  case  the  finding  of the  learned  Magistrate  that  the"
"portion  of land  blocked  out  from  the  land  granted  to  the  15t  Respondent"
"was in the possession Respondent need not be interfered."
"The  portion  identified  as  the  disputed portion by  the  parties  is  the"
"portion blocked out from  the  commercial  land.  The Appellant admit that"
"the  possession  of the 
land  was  with  the  15t  Respondent  at  the  time  of"
"filing the  information in  Court.  He  admits that the  15t  Respondent cleared"
"the 
land  and

tendered 
several 
affidavits

"possesslOn.  The 
learned  Magistrate  has  examined  these  affidavits  and"
"expressed the view that they are not reliable.  I do not intend to reconsider"
"that  finding.  I wish  to  mention  at  this  stage that two  persons  who  sworn"
"affidavits  marked  1 wa  9  and  1 wa  lOin favour  of the  Appellant,  have"
"withdrawn their affidavits by the  letter marked 2 Waga 8."
