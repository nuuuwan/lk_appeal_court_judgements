"In  the  said  circumstances what is  important to  consider is whether the prosecution has placed evidence"
"to  support  and  corroborate  the  dying  deposition  made  by  the  deceased  and  the  said  material  is  taken"
"together  with  the  dying  deposition  is  sufficient  to  convict  the  accused-appellant  for  murder  of  the"
"deceased."
"In  this  regard  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  accused-appellant had  alleged  that  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge  had  considered  irrelevant  facts  as  evidence  in  support  of the  prosecution  and  was  erred  in  law"
"and in fact on the concept of ""corroboration"""
"In Director of Public Persecutions V.  Hester, 1973 AC 296 Lord Morris said;"
