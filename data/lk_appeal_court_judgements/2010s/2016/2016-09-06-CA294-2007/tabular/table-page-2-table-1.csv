"(2) 
Counsel  for the  Petitioner and  1
to 3rd  Respondents  agreed  that the judgment of this"
"application would apply to case  no. C.A(writ) application 295/2007."
"(3) 
The  Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner's father, one Punchirala cultivated paddy in"
"an  extent of land  consisting  about two acres  since  1954 as  evidenced  by  document produced"
"marked  p2.  Subsequently four permits  were  issued  to the  siblings  of the  said  Punchirala.  The"
"Petitioner's  permit  consisting  of two  roods  was  produced  marked  Pi dated  1/12/1992.  On  a"
"perusal of p2  it appears that the same was issued  under and in terms of Crown Lands Ordinance"
"No.08 of 1847 to occupy the land  described in the said  permit for a period of one year valid till"
"31.12.1982."

The  Petitioner  has  not  submitted  any  permit  issued  to  said  Punchirala  under  and 
in"
"terms  of the  Land  Development Ordinance  and  therefore this  court has  to draw the inference"
"that  Punchirala  was  never issued  with  a permit  under and  in  terms  of the  Land  Development"

"p3(a),  p4,  p5,  p6,  p7,  p8(b), p8(1), p9  & pl0. This court is  of the view that attempts made by the"

"(5) 
This  Court  has  to examine  as  to whether the  Petitioner has  fulfilled  the  conditions  set"
"out in the permit marked pi independent from the conduct of the 4th  Respondent or his agents"
