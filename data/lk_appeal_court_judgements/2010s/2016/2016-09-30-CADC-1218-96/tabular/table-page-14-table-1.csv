"Thus,  having admitted  in  his  answer that the said  land is  a  portion of the Plaintiff's"
"land, as  stated above, the Defendant is  estopped from taking a new stand  in appeal"
"that the portion in dispute is  a different land."
"When 
the  Defendant's  application 
for  a  commission  was 
rejected  by  Court,  he"
"should  have 
taken  up  an 
interlocutory  appeal,  at 
that  stage,  or  agitated 
that"
"question in a cross-appeal. The Defendant has failed to take either course of action."
"In  the absence of satisfactory proof of prescriptive possession  by the Defendant, the"
"Plaintiffs'  statement  that  the  Defendant's  possession  was  upon 
their  leave  and"
"licence  holds good.  It is  admitted  by the  Defendant that just like him there are  five"
"or  six  other 
families  which  have  been  occupying  some  other  portions  of  the"
"Plaintiffs' 
land.  This 
is  permissive  possession  with 
the 
leave  and 
licence  of  the"
"Plaintiffs. This  gives  a presumption that the  Defendant also  must have  got into the"
"land with the leave and  licence of the Plaintiffs."
"Inherent error in the judgment"
"Having  found  that the  Plaintiffs  have  established  their title to the  land  in  question"
"and  concluded  that  the  Defendant  has  not  established  his  lawful  possession,  the"
"finding  of the  learned  District Judge  that  the  Plaintiffs  have  no  cause  of action  to"
"institute and  maintain  this  aCtion  is  erroneous.  It is  a non  sequitur.  As  a result  the"
"answers  given  by the  learned  District Judge  of Galle  to  issues  no.  8  and  9  are  also"
"erroneous. In the circumstances, the, learned District Judge's judgment should be set"
"I  proceed 
to  set  aside  the  judgment  dated  29th  October  1996  and  enter 
aside."
