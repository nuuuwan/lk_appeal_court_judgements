parties including the learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent inform Court

that they have no objections that this case being transferred from the District

Court of Mt. Lavinia to any other Court outside Mt. Lavinia. As observed by

this Court, the Plaintiff-Respondent is a senior practitioner from the District

Court of Mt Lavinia. Since the Plaintiff-Respondent too has no objection for

the case being transferred, we decide to make order under Section 46 of the

I

Judicature Act to transfer this case from the District Court of Mt. Lavinia to the

District Court of Colombo to hear and for final determination. We therefore,

make order transferring this case from the District Court of Mt. Lavinia to the

District Court of Mt. Lavinia and the Registrar of the District Court of Colombo
