"(2) The  Petitioner  has  failed  to  plead  exceptional  circumstances  that"
"are  necessary  for  the  invocation of the  Revisionary Jurisdiction of"
"this Court, which is a discretionary remedy."
"On the  question  of the  aforesaid  preliminary  objections,  both  parties"
"have 
filed  written  submissions  with  case 
law  authorities  and  have  also"
"I 
tendered  oral  submissions  when the  matter was  taken  up  on  15.05.2015."
"have  perused the  entirety  of the  Petition and  Affidavit of the  Petitioner and"
"the written submissions and case law authorities filed by both parties."
"The  first  question  which  arises 
for  decision 
is  as 
to  whether  the"
"Petitioner can invoke the powers in revision of this Court, if he had appealed"
"against the judgment made by the learned High Court Judge."
"The  Senior State  Counsel  for the  Respondent  submitted,  in  the  event"
"this Court allows the Petitioner to pursue the instant Revision Application, it"
"would  result  in  two  applications  being  filed  by  a  petitioner  in  the  same"
"forum,  seeking  similar reliefs,  where  in  one  he  exercises  his  statutory right"
"the 
and 
in  the  other  he  seeks 
the 
indulgence  of this  Court  to  exercise"
"discretionary powers of revision."
"In 
the  written 
submissions 
filed 
in 
this  Court  by 
the 
learned"
"President's  Counsel  for 
the  Petitioner, 
it  was  contended  that,  a  revision"
"should be allowed only in exceptional circumstances when the Petitioner had"
"a  right  of appeal  and  particularly  when  it  exercised. 
I  do  agree  with  the"
"learned  President's  Counsel  and  it  is  not  an  arguable  issue.  The  trend  of"
"authority clearly indicates that the revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal"
"will be exercised if the exceptional circumstances exist only."
