"existence  of an  appeal  would  not  be  an 
impediment  to  the  filing  of a"
"revision application provided there are exceptional circumstances and there"
"is no delay on the part of the Petitioner."
"In  Potman  vs  I,P.  Dodanwela  74  N.L.R.  115  and  Abdul  Cader  vs."
"Sitty Nisa 52 N.L.R.  546, it was held, that the revisionary jurisdiction should"
"be  exercised  only  in  exceptional  circumstances  in  circumstances  where  a"
"right of appeal is available to a party."
"On a consideration of the above authorities,  it is  abundantly clear that"
"revisionary  power would  be  exercised  by  this  Court whether  an  appeal  has"
"been filed  against the  order of the  original  court or not.  But the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances.  Hence I"
"reject the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel, that having lodged"
"a  final  appeal,  the  Petitioner  is  not  in  a  position  to  have  and  maintain  the"
"instant revision application but powers  of revision  should only be  exercised"
"in exceptional circumstances."
"Hence,  this  Court  has  the  power  to  act  in  revision  even  though  the"
"procedure  of appeal  is  available  in  appropriate  cases. 
The  question  which"
"has to  be decided is whether the  instant case is  an appropriate case in which"
"this court should exercise discretionary powers of revision."
"The  learned President's  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner also  conceded that"
"revision  is  a  discretionary  remedy  and  it  would  not  be  made  available  if"
"there  are  no  exceptional  circumstances  shown 
in 
the  petition. 
The  2nd"
"preliminary  objection 
raised  by 
the  Senior  State  Counsel 
is, 
that 
the"
"Petitioner  has  failed  to  plead  exceptional  circumstances  that  are  necessary"
"for the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction."
