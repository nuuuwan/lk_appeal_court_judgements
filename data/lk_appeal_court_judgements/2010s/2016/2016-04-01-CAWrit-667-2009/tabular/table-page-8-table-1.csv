"only 400 to  500  students  in  the  said  school  which  only  had  class  up  to"
"G.C.E.  Ordinary Level  examination.  This  I find  is a very weak argument"
"whether  a  school  had  class  up 
to  Ordinary  Level  examination  or"
"it  has 
to  have  a  playground 
for 
the 
Advanced  Level  examination"
"children. A playground for a school is undoubtedly a public purpose. The"
"land  acquired  had  not been  cultivated  for years according to the reports"
"called  before  the  acquisition.  Therefore factually  it  had  been  a  suitable"
"land to do the said construction."
"The  petitioners  stated 
there  was  no  urgency 
for 
the  public"
"purpose.  A  playground  to  a  school  which  has  to  be  developed  for  the"
"children  of the  area  is  a  matter  of great  urgency  and  importance  and"
"also it is  a  public purpose.  Children  are the future of a country and  they"
"have to be  properly educated."
"in 
the  Gazette  can  only  be 
An  acquisition  order  published"
"challenged  if the  public  purpose  is  not  disclosed  or  strong  grounds  of"
"procedural  impropriety coupled with  Mala  Fides existed  or if the  land  so"
"acquired  had  not  been  utilized  for  the  purpose 
it  was  acquired.  The"
"petitioners have not established any of these grounds."
