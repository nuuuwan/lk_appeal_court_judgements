"hearing the appeal the Court considered there are exceptional circumstances."
"In the present case except the delay in hearing the appeal, there are no"
"other exceptional reasons.  The Petitioner states that the wife of the Accused"
"is  a cancer patient. But the  learned High Court Judge has  found that she has"
"not  taken  any  treatment  for  years.  The  Accused  is  also  said to  be  suffering"
"from  illnesses  like  diabetics,  high  blood  pressure  and  eye  related  deceases."
"There  is  no  proof to  say  that those  illnesses  cannot be  treated  at  the  prison"
"hospital."
