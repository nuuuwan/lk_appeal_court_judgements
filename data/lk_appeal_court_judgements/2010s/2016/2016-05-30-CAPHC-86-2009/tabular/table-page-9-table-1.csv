in

138."
"Nevertheless 
it 
is 
position 
of 
the 
Petitioner 
that 
In"
"the 
first 
instance 
as 
he 
appealed 
to 
the 
supreme"

by 
special 
leave 
to 
appeal,

later  on 
he"
"moved 
to 
withdraw 
the 
said 
application 
and 
by"
"that 
time 
the 
appealable 
period 
has 
lapsed,  and 
as"
"such 
the 
Petitioner 
had 
no 
other 
option 
other 
than"
"to  make 
this 
revision 
application 
to 
this  Court."
"Therefore 
it 
is 
contended 
by 
the 
Petitioner 
that 
as"

impugned 
judgment 
IS 
ex 
facie 
incorrect

as"
"there 
was 
a 
necessity

are"
"sufficient 
grounds 
to 
invoke 
the 
revlslOnary"

of 
this 
court."
"It 
IS 
apparent 
that 
our 
Superior 
Courts 
had"
"allowed

had 
entertained 
reVlSlOn 
applications"
"even 
when 
a 
right
