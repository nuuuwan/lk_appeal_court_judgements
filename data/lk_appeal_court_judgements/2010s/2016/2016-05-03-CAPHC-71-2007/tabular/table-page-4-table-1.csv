"Under  Section  349 
(3)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code, 
if  the"
"Appellant does not appear to support the Appeal, the Court shall consider the"
"Appeal and make an order therein as it may deem fit."
"Accordingly, I will now consider the merits of the Appeal."
"The Appellant by this Appeal has  challenged the Order of the  learned"
"High Court Judge of Embilipitiya made on 27.06.2007."
"On  a  perusal  of the  Order  made  by the  learned  High  Court Judge,  it"
"appears  that  the  reason  given  by  her  to  dismiss  the  Petition  is,  that  the"
"Appellant  had 
failed 
to  plead  any 
exceptional 
circumstances 
that  are"
"necessary  for  the  invocation  of the  Revisionary  Jurisdiction  of the  Court,"
"which is a discretionary remedy."
"The  Revisionary  power of the  Court  is  a  discretionary  power and  its"
"exercise  cannot  be  demanded  as  a  right  unlike 
the  statutory  remedy  of"
"appeal.  Existence of exceptional  circumstances is  the process by which the"
"Court should select the  cases in respect of which the  extraordinary power of"
"revision should be adopted."
"(2003) 
In Dharmarathna and Another vs.  Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd."
"3 S.L.R. 24, Gamini Amaratunga J.  stated that the practice of Court to  insist"
"on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary"
"powers  has  taken  deep  root  in  our  law  and  has  got  hardened  into  a  rule"
"which  should  not  be 
lightly  disturbed. 
The 
trend  of authorities  clearly"
"indicates  that  the  revisionary  powers  of the  Court  will  be  exercised  if the"
"exceptional circumstances exist only."
