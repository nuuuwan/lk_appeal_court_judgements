"given  under oath, whereas,  the statement of the Appellant,  denying the offence was"
"given without an  oath.  In the case  of The  Queen Vs.  Kularatne and Two Others 1967"
"(71)  NLR 529, it was  held that ""when an unsworn statement is  made by the Appellant"
"from  the dock,  the jurors must be informed that such statement must be looked upon"
"that  the  Accused  had  deliberately 
as  evidence,  subject  however  to  the  infirmity"
"refrained from  giving  sworn  testimony.""  Although  the  Appellant's  counsel  tries  to"
"discredit  the  testimony  of  the  prosecution  witness,  the  evidence  in 
this  case  has"
"been  carefully  scrutinised  by  the  Trial  Judge  himself who  had  the  full  advantage  of"
"observing all the witnesses in this case  before him."
