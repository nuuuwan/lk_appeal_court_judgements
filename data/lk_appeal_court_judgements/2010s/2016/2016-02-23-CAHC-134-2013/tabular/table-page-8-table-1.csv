"According  to  the  Government  Analyst's  report  the  weapon  marked  in  Court  was  a"
"revolver.  A bullet was  found  in  the  left hand  middle section  and  was  marked  P2  by"
"the  Government  Analyst 
(Vide  pg.  138).  The  Learned  Counsel 
for 
the  Accused"
"Appellant argued that since the Government Analyst was  unable to say whether this"
"bullet  was 
fired  by  the  particular  revolver  as 
it  was  damaged.  Thus, 
it  creates  a"
"reasonable  doubt.  Furthermore  the  revolver  produced  in  Court  was  not  recovered"
"from  the  possession  of the  Appellant. 
It  was  a  section  27  recovery. 
Therefore  it"
"should  not be  treated  as  an  admission  that the  accused  used  this  particular gun  to"
"commit 
this  offence.  Furthermore  he  stated 
that  according  to  the  Government"
"Analyst's  Report, the weapon found  is  not compatible with the bullet. Therefore the"
"Learned Counsel for the Accused  Appellant argued that it creates a reasonable doubt"
"as  to whether this  revolver was  linked  to the incident.  According to the  Inspector of"
"Police M. S.  K.  Wickramarachchi, upon receiving information, that a person wanted in"
"connection  with  a  murder 
is 
said 
to  have  been  near 
the  General  Hospital,"
"Kurunegala,  he  had  gone  to the  hospital  and  had  arrested  the suspect  on  23rd  May"
"2008  upon  information given  by a private  informant. Accordingly after recording  his"
"statement a revolver presumed  to have  been  used  to commit the offence  had  been"
"recovered  on  being shown the place  by the Accused.  The  said  portion which  assisted"
"the  Police  to  recover  the  gun  had  been  marked.  Furthermore  a part  in  which  lithe"
"house of Amarasiri alias Sudu  Aiya  where the revolver had  been  kept can  be  shown"""
"had  been  marked  under  section  27. 
As  a  result  of the  Appellant's  statement  the"
"revolver  was  discovered  on  23rd  May  2008 
from  Amarasiri's  House.  Even 
if  the"
"for  the  Accused  Appellant  argued 
that  the  revolver  marked 
in 
Learned  Counsel"
"Courts  was  a section 27  recovery therefore it should  not be  treated  as  an  admission"
"that the Appellant  used  this  particular gun  to commit this  offence,  Pwl, (Vide  page"
"28)  who is the main eye witness in  this case  had  seen  the incident as  the shooting by"
"the  Appellant  had  taken  place  2ft away.  He  identified  the  gun  which  the  Appellant"
"had  used to shot the deceased. Therefore there is  no room to bring up false evidence"
"to  maliciously  implicate  him  to  an  incident  in  which  he  was  not involved.  After the"
"incident  he  left Anuradhapura  and  he  was  hiding  for  3  years  until  the  day  he  was"
"being  arrested  by  M.  S.  K.  Wickramarachchi,  Inspector  of Police  in  Kurunegala.  The"
"Knowledge  of the Appellant with regarding the place where the revolver was  hidden"
"needs to be taken in  to consideration  here.  However the Appellant has  not explained"
"as  to whether the revolver belongs to someone or how he got a revolver. Therefore,"
"the  revolver which  was  seen  by the Pwl Chaminda  at the time of the  incident is  the"
"same  revolver  which  was  recovered  after 3 years  as  a result  of a statement  by  the"
"Appellant.  This  can  be  accepted  without  any  doubt.  Learned  High  Court Judge  had"
"considered 
the 
fact  that  there 
is  no  valid 
reason  as 
to  why 
the  Appellant 
left"
"Anuradhapura  after the said  incident, therefore the Courts  can  come to a conclusion"
