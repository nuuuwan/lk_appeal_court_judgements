"Even  though  the  Petitioners were  silent  on  their permanent appointment,  the  Respondents  have"
"taken up the following position before this court;"
"According  to  the  Respondents,  on  26th  October  2009  the  Minister  in  Charge  of the  subject  of"
"Health 
in 
the  Central  Government  had  forwarded  a  Cabinet  paper, 
to  consider 
the  casual"
"employment  period  of  the  Public  Health  Field  Assistants  from  01.05.1977  to  02.08.1989  as"
"confirmed without payment of any back wages and conferring such officers their entitlement for"
"any promotion as per P-4."
"However  as  submitted  by  the  Respondents  the  said  Cabinet  Paper  was  not  approved  by  the"
"Cabinet but later submitted before the  Ministry of Finance and  Planning in the  year 2011  but the"
"said  memorandum  was

"The  Petitioners  have  further  relied  on  a  letter  issued  by  the  Secretary  to  the  Provincial  Health"
"Ministry  of  the  Sabaragamuwa  Province  which  was  produced  before  us  marked  P-ll.  As"
"observed by this court the said letter was issued subsequent to  a meeting the Petitioners had with"
