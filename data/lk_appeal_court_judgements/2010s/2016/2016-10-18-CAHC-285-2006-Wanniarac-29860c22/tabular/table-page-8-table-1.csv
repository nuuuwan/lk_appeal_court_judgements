"As observed by this court, the  Learned Trial Judge had correctly analyzed the evidence placed before"
"the  High  Court,  had  convicted  the  1st  accused  who  was  tried  in  absentia  along with  the  2nd  accused"
"and  acquitted  the  3rd  accused.  When acquitting the  3rd  accused  the  Learned Trial  Judge was mindful"
"of the  fact  that the  3rd  accused was not identified by the  1st  witness at the parade and given reason for"
"his decision."
"As  observed  by  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  there  were  no  major  contradictions  or  omissions  in  the"
"evidence of the above witnesses except for one contradiction marked in the evidence of the  1st  witness"
"which was marked as 25 1."
"In  the  said  circumstances we  see  no  reason  to  look in  to  the  ground  that  was  raised  before  us  to  the"
"effect  that  ""the  Learned  Trial  Judge  erred  in  law  when  he  conclude  that  the  evidence  of the  first"
"witness is corroborated by his own police statement"" when his evidence is  amply corroborated by the"
"evidence of the other witness."
"As observed above  this court is not inclined to  uphold  the  3rd  and  4th  grounds of appeal  raised by the"
"the  court  was  not 
infavour  of 
petitioner.  However  when  considering  the  1st  ground  of  appeal,"
"accepting the argument raised by the  Learned Deputy Solicitor General. In the  said circumstances the"
"next matter to be considered by this court is whether we are going to order a retrial in this case."
"In this regard the Learned Counsel for  the  accused-appellant had relied on the decision of this court in"
"Udanattage  Lionel  Hector  Jayasooriya  and  two  others  V.  The  Attorney  General  CA  Appeal"
"152/2002 CA minute dated  19.06.2009, where Sarath de.  Abrew J had observed that, ""the Indictment"
"reveals 
that 
the  alleged  offences  have  been  committed  on  10th  May  1996,  13  years  hence.  The"
"Learned Trial Judge had  delivered the Judgment on 31.07.2002, around 07 years ago. There would be"
"no  purpose  served  in  sending this  case  back for  retrial  after such  a  long period,  especially  so  as  the"
"appellant had apparently been in remand for  over 10 years before and  after being convicted.  Due to  a"
"vital  lapse  on the  part of the  Learned  Trial Judge  it would  be  unjustifiable  to  direct  the  appellant  to"
