"Therefore 
it  is 
contended 
by 
the 
Petitioner- Appellant"
"that 
the  Learned  High 
Court 
Judge 
has 
erred 
in 
law"
"In 
acting 
under 
Section 
38(2) 
without 
being 
satisfied"
"with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Commissioner 
of 
Labour 
has"
"himself 
considered 
whether 
it 
was 
impractical 
and"
"17 
38(1) 
inexpedient 
to 
take 
steps 
under 
Section 
and"
"of 
the 
EPF  Act, 
before 
proceeding 
to 
file 
a 
certificate"
"In 
terms 
of 
Section 
38(2) 
of 
the 
said 
Act.  Hence 
it"
"IS 
stated 
that 
In 
the 
above 
case 
the 
determination 
of"
"the 
said 
case 
IS 
only 
an 
'obiter 
dicta' 
and 
not 
the"
"'ratio 
decidendi'."
"In 
the 
said 
backdrop 
it 
IS 
clear 
that 
the 
intention"
"of 
the 
Legislature 
was 
to 
gIVe 
power 
to 
the"
"Commissioner 
to 
decide 
whether 
it 
IS 
practical 
and"
"expeditious 
to 
first 
resort 
to 
the 
recovery 
procedure"
"if 
In 
the 
District 
Court, 
and 
not 
resort"
"proceedings 
In 
the 
Magistrate 
Court 
for 
speedy"
"recovery, 
of 
the  money 
due 
to 
the 
employees 
in 
the"
"Company."
