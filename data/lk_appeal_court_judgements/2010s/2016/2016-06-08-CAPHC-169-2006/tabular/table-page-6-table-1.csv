It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to  call for any"
"evidence  from  the  competent  authority  in  support  of the  application"
"under Section 5."
"A simple reading of the  Section shows, that the validity of the matters"
"stated 
in 
the  application  cannot  be  questioned,  challenged  or  contested"
"except the matters mentioned in Section 9 (1)."
"In  upholding 
the 
In 
the  premises  aforesaid 
I  have  no  difficulty"
"contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General."
"However,  without prejudice  to  the  above  view,  the  next matter to  be"
"considered  is  whether the  Respondent  could  be  identified  as  a  ""Competent"
"Authority""  for  the  purpose  of the  State  Land (Recovery  of Possession)  Act"
"No.7 of 1979."
"It  is  the  stance  of the 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  that, 
the"
"Commissioner  of Local  Government  referred  to  in  Section  18  of the  State"
"Land (Recovery of Possession) Act. No.  07  of 1979, is the Commissioner of"
"Local Government of the Central Government."
"In  the  written  submission  filed  in  this  Court  by  the  learned  Counsel"
"for 
the  Appellant, 
it  was 
contended 
that 
a  Commissioner  of  Local"
"Government of a Province does not fall  within the  meaning of  ""Competent"
"Authority"" as defined in Section 18 of the said Act. 
It was further contended"
"that,  as  the  proceedings  have  not  been  instituted  by  the  Commissioner  of"
"Local Government of the Central Government, the Respondent did not have"
"the  locus  standi to  institute  the  said  action  in  the  Magistrate's  Court  under"
"the Provisions of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act."
