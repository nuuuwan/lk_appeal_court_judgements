"The  learned  High  Court  judge  has  correctly  observed  that  although  it  is"
"established that the Appellants  were present at temple  at the time  of the  incident it"
"cannot  be  said  that  they  entered  the  scene  with  the  common  intention  of causing"
"the  death of the  deceased.  There  is  no  evidence that either of the Appellants knew"
"the  identity of the  deceased prior to  the  incident.  Therefore there  is  no  evidence of"
"a prearranged plan or premeditation to  cause death on the part of the Appellants. It"
"is  the  subsequent  conduct  of the  Appellants  which  the  learned  High  Court judge"
"has  evaluated to  have indicated that they shared the common intention to  cause the"
"death of the deceased at the time of assaulting him."
