"judgment 
security 
has 
been 
obtained 
ex  parte, may 
be"
"unusual.  But 
I  do 
not 
think 
it 
to  be 
fundamentally"
"contrary 
either 
to 
principle 
or 
to 
practice.  Here 
we"
"considering 
are 
an 
arrest  which 
IS 
alleged 
to 
be 
not"
"merely  wrong 
but 
also  malice"" (emphasis 
added)."
"Hence 
considering 
the 
above 
determination 
the 
pith"
"and 
substance 
IS 
that 
the 
court 
before 
decides"
"whether 
it 
should 
order 
security 
on 
the 
counter 
claim"
"should 
be 
satisfied 
that 
the 
alleged 
arrest  should 
not"
"only  wrongful 
and 
illegal 
bout 
also  malicious."
"Therefore 
the 
Learned 
High 
Court 
Judge  was 
of 
the"
"VIew 
that 
the

of 
the

case 
differs 
from"
"the 
case 
In 
hand

cannot 
be 
followed 
the 
same"
"In 
deciding 
present 
Issue."
"In 
the 
above 
factual 
and 
legal 
matrix 
it 
IS"
"abundantly 
clear 
that 
the 
affidavit 
to 
lead 
a 
warrant"
"of 
arrest 
is 
not  made  out 
of  mala 
fide 
and  malice."
