"he  has not seen them  before.  He has denied the possession of the bag"
"in which the heroin was found.  He refers to a green coloured bag  but the"
"bag  marked  by witness  Ebert Silva  is  a blue  coloured  bag.  The defence"
"counsel  failed  to  suggest to  the  main  witness  that the  bag  found  in  the"
"possession  of the  accused  appellant was  green  in  colour and  not blue."
"Therefore we find that the story of the defence is not consistent. Accused"
"appellant by giving evidence has failed to cast a doubt on the prosecution"
"evidence."
