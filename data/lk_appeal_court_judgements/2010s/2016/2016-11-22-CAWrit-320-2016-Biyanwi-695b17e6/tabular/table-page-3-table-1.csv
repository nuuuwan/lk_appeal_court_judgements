"","contract  between  the  employer and  employee. The  petitioner's position  before this Court  is"
"","that the respondent being a State agency there is a statutory flavor in to the decision taken by"
"","the  1st  respondent  authority. However, this matter had  been  looked into in  several  decisions"
"","by this Court and the learned Deputy Solicitor General submits before us a recent unreported"
"","decision  of 183/2010 where H/L Justice Chitrasiri  has  clearly discussed  this issue  and  decided"
"that","the contractual obligation between State agency and an  employee does not come under"
"the writ jurisdiction. In this regard we are also mindful of the famous case of  Gawarammana",""
"vs.  Tea  Board  where H/L Justice Sripavan  had  held that the powers derived from the contract",""
"","are matters of private law. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is a public authority"
"","is  not relevant since  the decision  sought to be  quashed  by way of certiorari  is  itself was  not"
"made in the excise of any statutory power.",""
"","Having  considered  the  above  decision  and  the  material  I  have  already  discussed  we  see  no"
"merit in this application before us  and therefore we are not inclined to issue notice.",""
"Notice refused.",""
