"As  we held  in the case  of Sirajudeen  and two others vs  Abbas  1994"
"SLR  vol.  2  page  365,  where a  party invokes the provisions of section  3  of"
"the  Prescription  Ordinance, 
in  order 
to  defect 
the  ownership  of  an"
"adverse  claimant 
to 
immovable  property, 
the  burden  of  proof  rests"
"squarely  and 
fairly  on  him  to  establish 
starting  point  for  his  or  her"
"acquisition  of  prescriptive 
rights.  As 
regards 
the  mode  of  proof  of"
"prescriptive  possession,  mere  general  statements  of  witnesses  as 
to"
"possession  are not evidence of the uninterrupted and  adverse possession"
"a  title  by  prescription. 
It  is  necessary  that  the 
necessary  to  support"
"witnesses  should  speak  to  specific  facts  and  the  question  of possession"
"has to be decided thereupon by court."
