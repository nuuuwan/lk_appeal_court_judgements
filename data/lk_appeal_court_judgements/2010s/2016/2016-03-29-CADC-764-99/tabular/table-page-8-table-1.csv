"","In  Eileen  Eunice  de  silva  vs  G. 
liyanage  Jayanona  C.A  43/2000{F}"
"","decided on 02.07.2013 {page 375} Upaly Abeyratne J.,. held that:"
"","One  of the  essential  elements  of the  plea  of  prescriptive  title  as"
"","provided 
for 
in  section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance 
is  proof  of"
"","possession  by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or"
"","Plaintiff. The  occupation  of the  premises  must  be  of such  character as  is"
"","incompatible with the title of the owner."
"","The  Appellant  has  not  led  evidence  of  any  witnesses  or  has  not"
"","produced  any  supporting  documents  to  prove  that  she  or  her  husband"
"","commenced a title adverse to or independent of that of the Respondent."
"","I  am  of  the  view  that  for  a  claim  of  prescriptive  possession 
to"
"","succeed  such  claim  need 
to  be  established  by  assertive  evidence  of"
"","uninterrupted  and  undisturbed  possession  for  a  period  of over  10  years"
"","and  as  the clam  totally lacks  such  assertive  evidence except probably the"
"","mere fact of occupation only. In all the circumstances of this case  I would"
"","therefore  hold 
that 
the  defendant's  claim 
to  prescriptive 
title  must"
"","necessarily fail."
"","Although 
the 
defendant 
is 
claiming 
prescriptive 
rights 
on"
"","theproperty  in  question  she  has  not demonstrated  as  to the  date when"
"","how 
such 
adverse 
possession 
she 
began 
adverse 
possession 
and"
"","evidence 
as 
to 
the 
date 
of 
commenced.  Without  adducing  any"
"","commencement  of  adverse  possession,  the  Defendant  will  not  be 
in  a"
"","position  to  make  a  claim  on  prescription  to  the  property  in  question."
"","the  defendant  has  not  established 
the 
requirement  of 
Accordingly,"
