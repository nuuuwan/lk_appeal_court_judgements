Lands  and  others,  Fernando  J  had"
"decisions has published as follows;"
"""The Petitioners stated that the  2nd  Petitioner is  a Ceylon Tamil from  Balangoda married"
"to  a  Sinhala lady.  The  2nd  Petitioner purchased  that  land  (which contains  a  substantial  house  as"
"well  as  a  small  rubber  plantation)  in  September  1995  for  Rs.  500,000.  He  raised  the  purchase"
"price  by  using  his  lifelong  savings,  by  pawning jewellery,  and  by  obtaining  loans.  In  October"
"1995 
the  2nd  Petitioner  and 
the  members  of  his  family  went 
into  occupation.  A  few  weeks"
"thereafter  the  2nd  Respondent,  the  Grama  Sevaka  of Henagama,  with  a  team  of police  officers"
"from  the  Horana  Police  Station  came  to  the  house  and  checked  all  their  identity  cards;  the  2nd"
"Respondent  informed  the  2nd  Petitioner  that  he  suspected  that  the  2nd  Petitioner was  a  terrorist;"
"and one  of the Police  Officers said that  in  the  event of a soldier or police  officer being killed  in"
"action and his body being brought to  the village, the first house that would be burnt would be  the"
"2nd  Petitioner's. Thereafter the  2nd  Respondent came with police officers on many occasions and"
"harassed  the  2nd  Petitioner  and  the  members  of his  family,  making  allegations  that  they  were"
"terrorists.  On one occasion, when there  was  a visitor in the  house,  the  2nd  Respondent had  come"
"with  police  officers  and  stated,  in  the  presence  of the  visitor,  that  any  person,  other  than  the"
"members  of the  household, could  enter the  premises only with prior permission from  the  police"
"or  himself.  Humiliated,  the  visitor  went  away,  all  this  compelled  the  2nd  Petitioner  to  take  up"
"to 
the  house  regularly  to 
look  after  his 
residence  elsewhere,  although  he  continued  to  come"
"rubber plantation and other cultivations. But as he was prevented, as  aforesaid, from enjoying his"
"property, he could not repay the  loans he  had taken,  and he was therefore compelled to  advertise"
"the land for sale on 14.07.96 in the Sunday newspapers."""
