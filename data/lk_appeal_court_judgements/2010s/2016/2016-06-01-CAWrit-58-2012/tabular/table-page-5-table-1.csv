"In  a  nutshell the  question  is  whether the  Ports  Authority can  make use  of a"
"revision

"increased revision  that came into  effect on  1st  February  2012 retrospective?"
"Should space occupied before 1st  February 2012 be charged at the increased"
"rate that came into effect on 1st February 2012 (the new charges or tariff)?"""
