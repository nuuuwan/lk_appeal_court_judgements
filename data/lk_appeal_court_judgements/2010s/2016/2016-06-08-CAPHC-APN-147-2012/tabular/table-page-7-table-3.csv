"The  accused pleaded  guilty  to  a  lesser  offence  of culpable  homicide  not"
"amounting to  murder on the basis of sudden fight.  The  instant case is  not"
"a  case  of that  nature.  The  accused  has  carefully  planned  to  have  sexual"
"pleasure with this young girl.  He waited at the tuition class until it is over"
"to  pick  up  the  victim. 
He  took  her  to  a  work  site  called  ""block  gal"
"wedapala"" where he  has pre-arranged the persons there to  leave the place"
"in  his  motor  cycle.  Thereafter  he  committed 
the  offense.  He  did 
it"
"repeatedly  at  least  for  three  occasions.  This 
is  a  pre  meditated  crime,"
"deserves a heavy punishment, which deserves a heavy custodial term."
