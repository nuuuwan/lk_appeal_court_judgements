"It  is 
the  contention  of the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner,  whether  the"
"impugned order was challenged or not,  a party cannot acquiesce to  an order"
"which 
is  on 
the 
face  of  it  a  nullity. 
Then  a  question  arises,  having"
"knowledge of the said impugned order at that time why the Petitioner did not"
"challenge it. 
Instead of that the Petitioner has raised a preliminary objection"
"It is  relevant  to  note 
with  regard  to  the jurisdiction of the  Primary  Court."
"that the Petitioner has not given a plausible answer for the question."
