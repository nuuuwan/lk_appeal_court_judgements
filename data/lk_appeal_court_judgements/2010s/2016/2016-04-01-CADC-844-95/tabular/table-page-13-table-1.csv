"have filed in the District Court and that is the one which remains unproved."
"In  these  circumstances  there  is  no  evidence  before the  Appellate  Court to establish"
"the  pedigree  filled  by  the  10
th  and  11th  Defendants  although  sufficient  opportunity"
"was  available  to  establish  it at the  trial  before  the  lower  Court?  Proof of pedigree"
"should  have  been  done  by adducing  sufficient evidence,  by  the  parties who rely on"
"that pedigree. The  contesting pedigree was  filed  by the 10
th  and  11th  Defendants, on"
"th

Defendants-Appellants have  relied.  In the absence  of such"
"proof, the learned District Judge has correctly accepted the unchallenged pedigree of"
"the  Plaintiff, which  is  proved to the satisfaction of the Court, and  entered judgment"
"on that pedigree."
"Considering the  stand taken  by the parties and  the evidence  led  in the case,  I am  of"
