"statement dated 2013.09.16 the Appellant admitted that he was residing in"
"this premises since his childhood. A child who  is residing with his mother"
"does  not  get  any  independent right to  possession of a part of that house."
"The  child  is  licensee  and  the  possession  is  with  the  mother.  Therefore,"
"even  though  the  Appellant  (the  son)  resided  in  the  premises,  he  cannot"
"claim possession  against  the  Respondent  (his  mother).  Therefore,  I  hold"
"that  at  the  time  of filing  the  information,  the  possession  was  with  the"
"Respondent."
