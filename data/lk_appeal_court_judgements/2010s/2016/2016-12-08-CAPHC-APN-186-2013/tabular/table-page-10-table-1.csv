"barred.  The 
1 st  Respondent 
shouldn't  have 
entertained 
the 
appeal."
"Therefore the  order XI5  is  void ab  initio.  The  learned High Court Judge"
"has  not  granted  the  relief only  on  the  ground  that  the  delay  in  filing  the"
"application  was  explained.  As  it  was  mentioned  above  the  Court has  the"
"discretion  to  grant  relief in  cases  where  the justice requires  doing  so.  In"
"the  present  case 
the  2nd  Respondent  was  convicted 
for  offences  of"
"financial  misconduct.  The  petitioner  Society 
is  an 
institute  handling"
"public funds  in large scale. A person who has been convicted for financial"
"misconduct  is  not a  suitable  person to  be  employed in  an  institution  like"
"the Petitioner.  Therefore the Petitioner has a good and reasonable ground"
"to  challenge the order X 15  even after some time when the  I st  Respondent"
"took steps to implement the order."
