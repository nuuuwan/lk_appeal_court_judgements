"On  the  other  hand, 
if the  dispute  is  in  regard to  any  right to  any"
"land other  than  right of possession  of such  land, 
the  question for"
"decision,  according to  section  69(1),  is  who  is  entitled to  the  right"
"which  is  subject  of dispute.  The  word  ""entitle""  here  connotes  the"
"ownership  of the  right.  The  Court  has  to  determine  which  of the"
"parties  has  acquired that right,  or is  entitled for  the  time  being to"
"exercise  that  right.  In  contradistinction  to  section  68,  section  69"
"requires the Court to determine the question which party is  entitled"
"to  the disputed right preliminary to  making an order under section"
"69(2)."
