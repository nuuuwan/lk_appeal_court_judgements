"powers  and duties  which,  when  exercised  may  lead  to  detriment  of"
"subjects who may have to submit to their jurisdiction. """
"Dr.  Sunil  Coorey  in  his  book  on  Principles  of Administrative  Law  in  Sri"
"Lanka 3rd  Edition volume 2 page 855  says that ""Even if the duty sought to  be"
"enforced  by  mandamus  is  a  duty  of public  nature, 
it has  sometimes  been"
"contended  that  the  mandamus  will  not  issue 
to  compel  its  performance"
"unless  such  duty  is  owed by,  and therefore  the party  to  be  compelled  by"
