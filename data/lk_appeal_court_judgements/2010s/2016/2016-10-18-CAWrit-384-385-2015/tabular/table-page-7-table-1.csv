"it must be  borne  in  mind, as  revealed  before this Court that it is the same"

"to the  map P 6  is 864.5  Metres which  he argues is  legally admissible,"

"However,  it is the position  of the Respondents that the distance from  the"
"Petitioner's residence to the  particular school  is  1100 Metres according to  R"
"1. It is the position of the Petitioners that the  measured  distance  referred"
"to in  the map P 6 is a distance measured from  the Petitioners'  residence to"
"the main gate of the school.  However, it is the Respondent's  pOSition that"
"the distance they measured  is from  the Petitioner's residence to the"
"Principal's office of the school.  It was the submission  of the learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor General  that the school  authorities considered  the  Principal's office"
"as  the  point from  which  the distance to the  residences of all  the applicants"
"were  measured."
"Learned  DSG  drew the attention of this court to paragraph  19 of the"
"counter objections filed  by the  Petitioners. The  Petitioners have admitted  in"
"that paragraph  that they measured  the distance from  the  main  gate of the"
"school  and  not the Principal's office."
"It is to  be  noted  that new  maps  such  as  maps  marked  and  produced  as  P"
"6 and  P 9 by the  Petitioners cannot be taken  into consideration  in  the"
"appeal  proceedings as  per  rules that are  applicable  in  respect of admission"
"of children to the government schools."
