"Having 
said 
that 
the  Learned  Trial 
Judge  has  proceeded 
to 
evaluate"
"Dayawathie's  evidence  against  other  witnesses  before  determining  the  credibility"
"of that witness.  As  such, I am not agreeable with the  submissions  of the Learned"
"President's  Counsel.  Hence 
I  am  of  the  view 
that 
there 
is  no  merit 
in 
the"
