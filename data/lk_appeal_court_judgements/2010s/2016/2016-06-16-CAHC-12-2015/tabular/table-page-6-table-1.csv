"In  considering  the  credibility  of a  witness 
it  was  further  observed  in"
"above case by Her Ladyship that ""a key test of credibility is whether the witness"
"is  an  interested  or a  disinterested  witness.  Rajarathnam  J  in  Tudor  Perera  Vs."
"AG observed that when  considering the  evidence  of an  interested witness  who"
"may  desire  to  conceal  the  truth,  such  evidence  must be  scrutinized  with  some"
"care.  The 
independent  witness  will  normally  be  preffered  to  an 
interested"
"witness  in  case  of conflict.  Matters  of motive,  prejudice,  partiality,  accuracy,"
"incentive  and  reliablility  have  all 
to  be  weighed  (Vide,  Halsbury  Laws  of"
"England  4th  Edition  para  29)  Therefore, 
the  relative  weight  attached  to 
the"
"evidence of an interested witness who is  a near relative of the accused or whose"
"interests are closely identified with one party may not prevail over the testimony"
"of an  independent witness  (vide Hasker Vs.  Summers - Australia;  Leefunteum"
"Vs.  Beaudoin- Canada). """
