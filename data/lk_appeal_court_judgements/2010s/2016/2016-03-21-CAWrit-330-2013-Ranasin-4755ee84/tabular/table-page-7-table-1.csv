"Health and Others CA  Writ Application 978/2008 (Court of Appeal minutes 21.05.2011)."
"Under 
these  circumstances, 
it 
is 
the  duty  of  the 
Intervenient-Petitioners 
to  satisfy  court  of  their"
"position  before  this  court  and  the  court  cannot  go  behind  the  intervenient  parties  and  grant  relief to"
"them. It is their duty to be present on all  days when the matter is fixed for inquiry."
"After 
the  said  dismissal, 
the 
intervenient-Petitioners  have  now  come  before 
this  court  and  filed"
"papers', moving the matter to be relisted for inquiry into intervention."
"In  the  absence of any specific provision in  the  Court of Appeal  (Appellate Procedure Rules)  1990 for"
"intervention,  once  again  this  court  wish  to  re-iterate  that  this  court  is  reluctant  to  make  order  for"

"therefore  the  counsel  could  not  appear  in  the  Court  of Appeal  24/7.  In  support  of this  position  the"
"Intervenient-Petitioners has filed along with their Petition Copies of the diaries of the  two counsel."
"However  when  going through  the  documents  filed  before  this  court,  I  observe  that  the  Intervenient-"
"Petitioners has taken nearly 1 Yz  months to  come before this court. If the date is incorrectly recorded as"
"27/7,  by  27/7  the  parties  should  take  steps 
to  ascertain  what  has  happened 
to 
the  case  and 
take"
"appropriate  steps without waiting for  nearly  1  Yz  months.  This conduct of the  Intervenient-Petitioners"
"are worst than the  mistake already committed. The Intervenient-Petitioners have failed  to  explain their"
"delay before this court."
