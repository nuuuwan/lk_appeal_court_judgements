"amicably 
demarcated 
by 
the 
co  owners, 
containing 
In"
"extent 
one 
and 
half 
acres 
from 
and 
out 
of 
the"
"larger 
land 
as 
stated 
above.  But 
it 
is 
salient 
to 
note"
"that 
the 
land 
that  was 
surveyed 
as 
the 
corpus 
IS 
a"
"land 
containing 
In 
extent 
only 
2 
roods 
and 
16"
"perches.  Therefore 
it 
is 
abundantly 
clear 
that 
there 
IS"
"no 
proper 
identification 
of 
the 
corpus, 
and 
on 
that"
"account 
alone 
the 
Plaintiff's 
action 
should 
fail."
"It  was 
the 
contention 
of 
the 
Plaintiff - Appellant 
that"
"the 
land 
sough 
to 
be 
partitioned 
IS 
registered 
In"
"Folio  34/94 
at 
the  Kegalle 
Land  Registry.  But 
it 
is 
to"
"be 
noted 
that 
the 
land 
registered 
In 
the 
said 
folio"
"contains 
a 
land 
In 
extent 
one 
and 
half 
acres 
of"
"land 
and 
not 
the 
extent 
of 
land 
of 
two 
roods 
and"
"16 
perches 
as 
depicted 
In 
the 
preliminary 
plan"
"bearing 
No. 
3755 
marked 
as 
X.  Therefore 
it 
IS"
"pertinent 
to 
note 
that 
there 
IS 
no 
separate 
land"
"possessed 
by 
the 
co  owners 
to 
the 
extent 
stated 
In"
"the 
afore 
said 
preliminary 
plan 
No.3755, 
being 
1/42"
"share 
of 
the 
afore 
said 
larger 
land 
of 
one 
Amuna"
"and 
eight 
lahas."
"The 
Learned  District 
Judge 
has 
dealt  with 
this 
Issue"
"In 
a 
light  manner 
and 
had 
discussed 
the 
devolution"
"of 
title 
at 
length."
"According 
to 
the 
pedigree 
of 
the 
Plaintiff - Appellant"
"the 
said 
particular 
portion 
of 
land 
has 
been 
owned"
