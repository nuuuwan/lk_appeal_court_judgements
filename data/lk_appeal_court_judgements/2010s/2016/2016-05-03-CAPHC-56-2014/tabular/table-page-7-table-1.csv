"It  is 
the  stance  of the 
learned  Counsel  for 
the  Appellant  that  the"
"learned  High  Court Judge  had  completely  misdirected herself in  relation  to"
"the  interpretation of the  above  Rule  21  (i)  (e)  of the  Co-operative  Rules  of"
"1973.  Therefore,  it  is  the  contention  of the  Counsel  that Rule  21  (i) (e)  of"
"the Co-operative Rules has to be given a logical interpretation by this Court."
"However,  it  is  the  stance  of the  learned Counsel  for  the Respondents"
"that,  Section 21  (i) (e)  is not ambiguous and therefore it should not be  open"
"for  interpretation.  The learned State Counsel has contended that, the period"
"of three months is  clearly a reference to  a delay of instalments or the period"
"within which such money should be paid as  stipulated and not a reference to"
"a period of three months preceding election."
"Drawing  the  attention  of the  Court  to  the  Local  Authorities  Election"
"Ordinance  and  the  Provision  21  (i)  (d)  of the  Co-operative  Rules  of 1973,"
"State  Counsel 
has 
contended 
that 
the  words 
further 
the 
learned"
"""preceding""  has  been  clearly 
included  in  these  Provisions,  but  it  is  not"
"included in the Provision 21  (i) (e) of the Co-operative Rule."
"In tenus of the  Local  Authorities  Election  Ordinance a person ""who"
"is  serving  or  has  during  the  period  of five  years  immediately  preceding"
"completed the serving of the whole or part of sentence of imprisonment ..... """
"is qualified to be elected to a local body."
"In  tenus  of Rule  21 
(i)  (d)  of the  Co-operative  Rules  of 1973,  the"
"conviction  for  a  criminal  offence  disqualifying  a  member  to  be  elected"
"should be within three years immediately preceding the date of the election."
"Hence,  this  Court had  taken pains to  consider whether there  was  any"
"obscurity and/or ambiguity in the wording of Rule 21  (i) (e)."
