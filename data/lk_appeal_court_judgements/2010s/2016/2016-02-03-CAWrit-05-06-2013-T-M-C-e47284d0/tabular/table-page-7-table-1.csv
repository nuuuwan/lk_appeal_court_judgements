"As admitted by both parties before this court the  investigators belonging to  the  Department of Local"
"Government was placed at T-3-7-5 scale with effect from 01.01.1997. when extending the validity of"
"the  said  circular  to 
the  retired  officers  who  retired  prior  to  01.01.1997,  it  was  necessary  to  first"
"calculate  the 
revised  salary  based  on 
the 
last  drawn  salary  and 
then  determine 
the  pension  by"
"reference  to  the  revised  lost  drown 
salary  and  the  said  determined  pension  was  to  be  paid  w.eJ."
"01.01.1997.  The  argument  of the  Petitioners  before  this  was  that,  even  though  the  revised  pension"
"was paid w.e.f.  01.01.1997 the  Petitioners are entitled to  the revisions proposed to  the pension under"
"pension circular 16/1994, 01/1997 and 05/1999."
"This court  cannot  agree  with the  above  contention of the  Petitioners,  since  the  Petitioners  are  to  be"
"paid revised pension only with effect from 01.01.1997."
"Therefore  any  revisions  proposed by pension circulars prior to  01.01.1997 will  have  no  bearing on"
"the calculation made to  the Petitioners pensions."
