"When  considering 
the 
submissions  made  by 
the  Counsel,  we"
"observe  that  there 
is  no  purpose  in 
issuing  notices 
in  this 
case  for"
"several 
reasons,  one  being  the  action  has  already  been  filed  before  this"
"Court  which 
is  pending  and 
secondly 
the  petitioner's 
failure 
to"
"establish  before 
this  Court 
that 
the 
respondents  have  given  up 
the"
"original  plan  to  construct a 
sports  complex in  this  premises which  has"
"been acquired  ."
