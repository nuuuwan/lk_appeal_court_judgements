"At the  inquiry,  the Learned PC  for the Petitioner submitted that the age and the"
"medical  condition  of the  Petitioner 
itself  can  be  considered  as  exceptional"
"circumstances.  He  further  argued  that  the  order  of the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  section  14  of the  Bail  Act.  The  Learned"
"ASG  argued that the  alternative  remedy  of appeal  is  available  as  of a right  and"
"in  such  situations  the  discretionary  remedy  of revision 
is  not  available.  His"
"contention 
is 
that 
there 
are  no 
exceptional 
circumstances 
to 
invoke 
the"
"revisionary jurisdiction."
"The  Petitioner  is  a  lady  of 74  years  of age.  The  Respondent  submits  that  the"
"issued  by 
the  doctors 
in  UK  cannot  be 
authenticity  of the  medical  reports"
"verified and therefore it cannot be relied upon.  But the medical report issued by"
"the JMO Colombo is an authentic document.  That report was submitted to Court"
"on  the  order  of the  Learned  Magistrate.  The  JMO  was  of the  onion  that  she"
"should  be  kept  under  ICU  care  for  48  hours  and  then  to  transfer  to  another"
"hospital  only  if there  is  no  objection medically by the doctors treating her.  This"
"report  suggests  that the  Petitioner was  in  need  of intensive  care  when  she  was"
"remanded  and  when  she 
is  out  of  danger,  her  health  condition  has 
to  be"
"managed properly.  Even if the medical  reports  issued by the  doctors  in  UK  are"
"not  accepted  as  suggested by  the  Learned ASG,  still  there  is  evidence to  show"
"that the Petitioner is sick elderly woman who needs medical attention."
"There  is  a long line  of authorities that a revision  is  discretionary remedy  and to"
"invoke  such jurisdiction  it  is  necessary  to  establish  exceptional  circumstances."
"if there 
is  an  alternative  remedy, 
the  revisionary  jurisdiction  is  not 
Further,"
"available.  The Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner does not challenge"
"this  position.  His  argument  is  that  even  if there 
is  an  alternative  remedy 
is"
"available,  ifthere are exceptional circumstances, the revision is also available."
