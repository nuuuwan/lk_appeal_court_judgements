"Whether it is safe to  convict the 3rd  accused-appellant on the basis of common intention"
"As  observed  by  this  court  the  two  main  prosecution  witnesses,  namely  Douglas  and  Indrani  whose"
"evidence  I  have  already  summarized  were  subject  to  extensive  cross  examination.  Witness  Douglas"
"was in the witness box for nearly 3  years and Indrani for nearly 5 months."
"Even though the  counsel had made comments on the  evidence of these  two witnesses, the  defence  had"
"not been able to mark any significant contradiction or omissions during their evidence. However it was"
"brought to  the  notice of court by the  counsel that witness Douglas in his statement to  police had stated"
"that no other relatives of him were present when attack took place but under cross examination he  said"
"that when saying so he only ment the male relations."
"As observed by this court, the two eye witnesses have observed the attack from their respective houses"
"which were situated in the same compound and therefore one cannot expect both witnesses to see each"
"other or observe every  detail of an  incident which took  place with  no  prior notice.  However it  is  also"
