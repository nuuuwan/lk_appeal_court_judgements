"happened with  regard  to  causing injury  to  the  father  of the  accused  have  taken  place 5  days  after  the"
"death  of the  deceased and,  therefore  the  evidence of Douglas cannot be rejected for  the  mere fact  that"
"he  denied his knowledge of the said incident."
"The counsel for  the  accused-appellant address  us  on a  discrepancy with regard  to  a  name  appeared  in"
"the complaint made by M.  Jayasena Silva a brother of the  deceased who made the first complaint. The"
"counsel  drew  our  attention  to  the  said  complaint  which  was  available  for  perusal  at  page  643  of the"
"appeal  brief.  However  the  Learned  Senior Additional  Solicitor General  whilst  objecting  to  the  above"
"attempt  submitted  that  the  said  statement  which  was  not  marked  at  the  proper  stage  of the  trial  had"
"been  smuggled  in  to  the  case  record  through  the  written  submissions  of the  accused-appellant.  As"
"observed by this court the said statement had not been marked at the trial and therefore the submission"
"made with regard to the said statement cannot be looked into by this court."
"It was further argued by the  Learned Counsel for  the accused- appellant that the prosecution has failed"
"to lead the evidence of witness Jayasena who is a material witness for the prosecution."
"In  the  case  of Walimunige John  V.  The  State  76 NLR 488  it  was  held that,  ""the prosecution  is  not"
"bound to  call all  the  witnesses whose name appear on the back of the  indictment or to  tender them for"
"cross examination."""
