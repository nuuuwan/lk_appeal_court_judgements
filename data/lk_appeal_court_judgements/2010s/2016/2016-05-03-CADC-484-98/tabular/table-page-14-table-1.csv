"The  next  question 
is  under  what  authority 
the  Court  could  have"
"ordered the re-listing of an  application. 
I am  of the  view the  Court has  the"
"power  to  restore  the  application  to  the  list  in  the  exercise  of its  inherent"
"jurisdiction."
"The  application before  this  Court  is  made  in terms  of Section  771  of"
"the Civil Procedure Code."
"The Section 771  reads as follows:"
"""When an appeal is  heard ex-parte in  the absence of the respondents"
"and judgment is  given  against him,  he may apply to  the  Court of Appeal to"
"rehear  the  appeal;  and if he  satisfies  the  Court  that  he  was  prevented by"
"sufficient cause from  attending when  the  appeal was  called on for  hearing,"
"the Court may re-hear the appeal on such terms as to  Court or otherwise as"
"the Court thinks fit to impose upon him ""."
"I am  of the view that the Petitioners have  established sufficient cause"
"for  absence,  when  the  appeal  was  called  for  hearing.  Obviously,  the  party"
"had no  due notice  from  the  Court  when  the  matter was  to  be  heard,  and  as"
"such, the matter ought to be reinstated."
"The  right to  be  heard has  little  or no  value  unless  the  party  has  been"
"given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. 
It was held in State Graphite"
"Corporation vs.  Fernando  (1982)  2  S.L.R.  590,  where  a  party  wishes  to  be"
"heard  or the  issues  involved  are  such,  that the  Court  ought not to  make  an"
"order without hearing a party affected."
