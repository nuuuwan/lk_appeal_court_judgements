"Accordingly,  the  first  question  arising for  decision in this  application"
"is  whether  the  Order dated  11.01.2012  was  made  without  duly  serving  the"
"Notice of Appeal on the Petitioners."
"It was  held 
in  linadasa and  Another  V s.  Sam

"of matter under consideration,  is  making  information  available  in  the  usual"

"and  usages  of the  Court.  Where 
information  of the  appointed  date  for"
"hearing  is  usually  set  out  in  a  list  prepared  and  published  by  the  Court's"
"registry,  and  information  of the  hearing has  been  given  in  that  way,  that  is"
"due notice to the parties and their Counsel""."
"It is  to be noted that the case  in  hand had not been listed in the usual"
"way.  The  way  in  which  cases  were  fixed  for  hearing  in  this  Court  is  that"
"notice should have been personally served on the parties."
"The  stance  of the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  is  that  the  Petitioners"
"were  not  noticed  of the  Appeal;  only  the  Appellants  and  the  1 st  and  2nd"
"Defendants - Respondents were noticed."
"On  perusal  of  the  journal  entries  of this  case  dated  26.10.2009,"
"30.10.2009,  09.12.2011  and  28.09.2011 
it  is  quite  evident  that  only  the"
"If,  upon  the 
Appellants  and  the  1 st  and  2nd  Respondents  were  noticed."
"unrebutted oath of the  absent party, the  lack of due  notice had been alleged,"
"the view of the Court is ordering reinstatement of the hearing is justified."
