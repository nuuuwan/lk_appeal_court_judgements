"respondents 
raised  number  of  preliminary  objections. 
Out  of  their"
"objections  raised,  we  observe  that  according 
to 
the  provisions  of  the"
"Provincial  Councils Act  the  appointments  to  the  Provincial  Councils  are"
"vested  with  the  Governor  of that province.  This  position  is  clear under"
"Section 32(1)  of the  said Act  and under Section 32(2)  of the  said Act the"
"Governor  may  delegate  such  powers 
to 
the  Provincial  Public  Service"
"Commission.  Under  Section  32  (2)(a) 
the  said  powers  delegated  to  the"
"Provincial Public Service Commission may delegate to the Chief Secretary"
"or  any  officer  of  the 
Provincial  Public  Service  of  that  province. 
As"
"observed  by  this  Court even  though  the  service  minute  may require  the"
"method  of  selection  should  be  by  the  Provincial  Education  Authorities"
"what 
the  Provincial  Council  has 
to 
follow

the  provisions 
in 
the"
"Provincial Councils Act and under the provisions of Section 32  if there is"
"a  provincial appointment, the appointment has to be governed by Section"
"32  of the  Provincial  Councils Act  and  therefore  the  appointing authority"
"of the  said  province  is  the  Provincial  Governor 
and  if he  has  delegated"
"such  powers 
to 
the  Provincial  Public  Service  Commission 
then 
the"

In the"
"present  case  it  is  clear  that  the  Governor  had  appointed  the  Provincial"
"Public 
Service 
Commission

in 
the 
said 
circumstances, 
the"
"appointing authority should be the Provincial Public Service Commission"
