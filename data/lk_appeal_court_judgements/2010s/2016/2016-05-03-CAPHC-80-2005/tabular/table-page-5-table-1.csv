"why  the  sum  specified  on  the  certificate  is  not  payable. 
The  Appellant"
"took up the position that he  is  not liable 
showed cause by way of affidavit;"
"to  pay 
the 
said 
sum  of  Rupees  Three  hundred  and 
twenty 
thousand"
"(Rs.320,0001-) 
to the 2nd Respondent as he was not its employee."
"The learned Magistrate in his Order held that, he has no jurisdiction to"
"inquire whether the 2nd  Respondent was an employee or not of the Appellant"
"and ordered the Appellant to pay the said sum of Rupees Three hundred and"
"twenty thousand (Rs.320,0001-) to the 2nd Respondent in two instalments."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order,  the  Appellant  filed  a  revision"
"application  in  the  High  Court  of Colombo  against  the  said  Order  of the"
"learned Magistrate.  The learned High Court Judge,  delivering his Judgment"
"on  24.02.2005,  affirmed the  Order  of the  learned  Magistrate  and  dismissed"
"the revision application filed by the Appellant."
"Thereafter the Appellant has  invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this"
"Court to  intervene by setting  aside  the  Judgment of the  learned High  Court"
"Judge  dated  24.02.2005,  and  the  Order  of the 
learned  Magistrate  dated"
"26.03.2004."
"At the hearing of this  Appeal  the  learned President's  Counsel  for  the"
"Appellant  contended  that,  the  main  grievance  of the  Appellant  is,  that,  the"
"2nd  Respondent was never an employee of the Appellant;  but an independent"
"contractor and the  learned Magistrate has  not considered this  position when"
"he  made 
the 
impugned  order. 
The 
learned  President's  Counsel  further"
"contended  as  such,  the  Judgment  of the  learned  High  Court  Judge  which"
"affirms the Order of  the  learned Magistrate,  is  completely erroneous  in  fact"
"and in law."
