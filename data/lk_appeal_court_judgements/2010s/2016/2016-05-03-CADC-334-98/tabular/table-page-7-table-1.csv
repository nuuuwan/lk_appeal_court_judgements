"Accordingly,  the  first  question  that  arises  for  consideration  in  this"
"application  is  whether  when  an  order  has  been  made  for  abatement  by  the"
"Court of Appeal,  the Appellant should appeal to the  Supreme Court against"
"that order or whether the  Court of Appeal  itself has jurisdiction to  set aside"
"its own order. 
In the case at hand,  firstly,  it is relevant to note, that the order"
"of the Court of Appeal was  not a judgment pronounced at the termination of"
"the  hearing  of an  Appeal,  but  rather  an  order on  an  incidental  question,"
"viz., an application for re-listing. 
It was held in Jinadasa and Another vs."
"Sam  Silva  and  Others  (1994)  1  SLR  232  since,  there 
is  no 
legislation"
"governing the  matter,  the  Court  has  the  power to  restore  the  application to"
"(Issarsing  vs.  Udhavdas 
the  list  in the  exercise  of its  inherent jurisdiction."
"and Others AIR 1921  Sind 55,57)."
