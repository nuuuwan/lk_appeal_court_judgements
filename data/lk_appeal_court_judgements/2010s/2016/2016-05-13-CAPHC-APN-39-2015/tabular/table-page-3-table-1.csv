"Section 314( 1) of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No.  15  of 1979"
"liable  to  be  tried  twice  for  the  same 
provides  that  no  person  shall  be"
"offence. The section reads thus;"
"(1) A person who  has once  been tried by a court of competent

"be  liable  to  be  tried again for  the  same  offence  nor  on  the  same"
"facts for  any  other  offence for  which  a  different  charge from  the"
"one  made against him  might have been made  under section  176 or"
"for which he might have been convicted under section 177."
"Section  176  relates  to  situation  where  it  is  doubtful  what  offence"
"has  been  committed  and  section  177  relates 
to  situations  where

"accused  is  charged  with  one  offence  and  it  appears  in  evidence  that  he"
"committed  a  different  offence.  Both  these  sections  do  not  apply  to  the"

"requirements  have  to  be  fulfilled.  Firstly  the  accused  person  must  have"
"been

"jurisdiction.  Secondly  that  acquittal  or  conviction  must  remain  in  force."
"Finally  it  should  be  the  same  offence  or  the  same  facts  for  any  other"
"offence for which a different charge from the one made against him might"
"have been made."
"In the instant case, the Petitioner was brought before the Magistrate"
"IS  a

this"
"procedure to recover the moneys  due  to  it without delay.  Once the award"
"is  granted,  it  can be  implemented through the Magistrate  Court.  There  is"
"no  charge  against the person and the  Magistrate does  not try  any  offence"
