"remains as a portion in common use, for example a roadway."
"In Yoosoof vs  Mustapha  13 Ceylon  Law Recorder p.  171, a land had  been"
"partitioned,  but certain  portion  consisting of a  road  and  two latrines had  been"
"left unallotted, the  decree  containing no reference  to them.  A  party who was"
"the successor in title to one of the persons in whose favour the partition decree"
"had been entered, claimed the right to user of the unallotted portion as  being a"
"right appurtenant to the  allotted  portions.  It was  held that lithe claim  was  not"
"admissible  and  that  the  unallotted  portion  continued  to  remain  the  common"
