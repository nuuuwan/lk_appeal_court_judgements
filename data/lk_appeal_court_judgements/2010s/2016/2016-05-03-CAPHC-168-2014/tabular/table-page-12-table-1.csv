"It  seems, 
that 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  having 
taken 
into"
"consideration 
the  above  principles  has  made 
the 
impugned  order  and"
"therefore, I see no basis to interfere with it."
"In  D.  Jayasuriya  Vs.  H.  Warnakulasooriya  61  N.L.R.  189  - H.N.J"
"Fernando  said,  the  Section  419  (the  same  as  Section  431  of the  Criminal"
"Procedure Code) cannot be utilised by a ""complainant"" in order to  obtain an"
"order  of possession  from 
the  Magistrate  of  any  article  seized  from 
the"
"possession of another as  being stolen property, if the other person denies the"
"theft and claims the property as his own""."
"In  the  case  at  hand,  it  is  an  undisputed  fact  that  the  vehicle  bearing"
"No.  50 Sri 7295  was taken over by the Police from the  Respondent and he is"
"the  registered  owner of the  vehicle  and  the  absolute  owner  is  Senkadagala"
"Finance Ltd.  at the time the Police seized it.  The Respondent has bought the"
"vehicle  in good  faith  and  therefore  he  is  a  bonafide  purchaser.  At  the  time"
"he  bought the vehicle he did not have any knowledge that a criminal offence"
"had  been  committed  in  respect  of the  said  vehicle.  As  such  he  claims  the"
"vehicle as his own."
"A  Magistrate's  Court  should  not  be 
turned 
into  a 
forum 
for 
the"
"settlement of civil disputes, yet, a Magistrate making an order under Section"
"431  must exercise his judicial discretion in ascertaining the person entitled to"
"possession. 
The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  taken  the  view  that  the"
"learned  Magistrate  had  not  exercised  his  discretion judicially and  set  aside"
"the order made by the learned Magistrate."
