"","warranty period for this harvester.  Hence,  it is the submission  of the"
"","learned  Deputy Solicitor General  that Section  13(2) must be given a"
"","purposive interpretation.  He  relied  on  a judgment of this court in  David"
"","Peiris Vs.  Consumer Affairs Authority C A Application  No.  635/ 2007"
"","(Writ) decided on  2009-08-03."
"","According  to Section  13 (2) a complaint under subsection  (1) which"
"","relates to the sale of any goods or to the provision of any service shall"
"","be  made to the authority in  writing within 3 months of the sale of such"
"","goods or the provision of such  service,  as the case  maybe."
"","If Section  13  (2) is to be interpreted strictly giving a literal meaning to"
"","its words,  then that Section  will  prevent a consumer who has purchased"
"","a good  or service with  a warranty or guarantee with  a longer period"
"","than  3 months, from  lodging a complaint relating to such  purchase after"
"","3 months of its purchase.  In other words such  consumer can  lodge a"
"","complaint in  relation to such  goods or services only if something goes"
"","wrong during the first 3 months period of the warranty or guarantee he"
"","has  received. This is despite of the fact that he still  holds a valid"
"","warranty or guarantee for a longer period than  3 months. The resultant"
"","posltton of such  a strict Interpretation would  be Inevitably that no"
