"trader to breach  with absolute impunity, a warranty or guarantee that"
"he provides on  his own volition, to the consumers.  It cannot be said  with"
"any yardstick that it has been  the intention which the legislature"
"entertained when  it passed  this Act."

"can  only complain within 3 months of the purchase of the goods in"
"relation  to the breach of a warranty or guarantee; it will  lead to"
"absurdity and the protection given by Section  (1) (b) would  be  rendered"
