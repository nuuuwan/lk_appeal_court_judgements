"approval  from  the co-operative Employees Commission is  necessary for  the  recruitment of permanent"
"staff to  the co-operative societies."
"When looking at  the  above provisions, it is clear that,  any  appointment to  a permanent cadre in the  co-"
"operative  society  requires  prior  approval  from  the  Co-operative  Employees  Commission  but,  in  the"
"present case the  letter of appointment issued by the  1st  Respondent was issued without obtaining prior"
"approval from  the 2nd  Respondent but subject to  the approval of the 2nd  Respondent."
"As submitted by the  Petitioner, after the first interview, he  was appointed to  the  post of administrative"
"officer  by  the  1st  Respondent  on  acting  basis  subject  to 
the  approval  of  the  2nd  Respondent  for"
"confirmation by  letter dated  1ih October 2011.  Thereafter he  was issued with a letter of confirmation"
"by  the  1st  Respondent  dated  24th  April  2012  again  subject  to 
the  approval  of  the  2nd  Respondent."
"Therefore it was  argued that the Petitioner has a legitimate expectation to hold the said position."
"However,  if the  petitioner did  not  possess  the  required  minimum  qualification  to  be  appointed  to  the"
"post of Administrative  Officer (Executive  Grade  Class III)  the  legitimate expectation cannot exist any"
"longer."
