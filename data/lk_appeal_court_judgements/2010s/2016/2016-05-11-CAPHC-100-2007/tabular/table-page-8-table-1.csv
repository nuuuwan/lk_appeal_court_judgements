"Dr.  Amarasinghe  J. 
pointed  out  in  the  case  of Fernando  vs.  Sybil"
"Fernando 
""there  is  the  substantive  law  and  the  procedural  law.  Procedural"
"law is not secondary. The two branches are complementary.  Halsbury points"
"out it is by procedure that the  law which puts life into substantive law, gives"
"it remedy and effectiveness and brings it into being""."
"Hence,  in  the  interests  of the  administration  of justice, there  must he"
"order, and therefore there must be compliance with the Rules of the Court of"
"Appeal. 
As  I  have  observed  the  defect  was  not  of a  purely  formal  or"
"technical nature. 
Invoking the jurisdiction of the court is a crucial step in the"
"proceedings."
"The Petition of Appeal  filed by the appellant in this case has not been"
"directed to the proper forum under the proper provision of law in as much as"
"no proper legally tenable appeal  is pending.  Therefore my considered view"
"is that the Appellant has not invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in a proper"
"manner complying with  Rule  14( 1) of the Court of Appeal Rules."
"F or the  reasons  stated above  the  purported Petition of Appeal  should"
"be dismissed in  limine."
"Without  prejudice 
to 
the  aforesaid  decision,  now 
I  will 
tum 
to"
"consider the merits of the case."
"The  Respondent  instituted  proceedings  in  terms  of Section  5  of the"
"State  Lands  (Recovery  of Possession)  Act,  against  the  Appellant, 
in  the"
"Magistrate's Court of Matugama, seeking for an order to eject the Appellant"
"from the land more fully described in the schedule to the application."
