"The  scope  of the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of Possession)  Act  was  to"
"provide a speedy or summary mode of getting back possession or occupation"
"of ""State Land""  as  defined in the Act,  where there was not subsisting on the"
"relevant  date,  in  the  opinion  of the  Competent  Authority  a  valid  permit  or"
"authority."
"The Appellant has failed to  show that he was in possession of the  said"
"land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State. Therefore the"
"learned  Magistrate  has  made  an  order  ejecting  the  Appellant  from  the  said"
"land."
"Being  aggrieved  by 
the  said  order  of  the 
learned  Magistrate 
the"
"Appellant preferred an application, seeking to revise the Order of the learned"
"Magistrate. 
The  learned  High  Court  Judge  made  an  Order  affirming  the"
"Order  of the  learned  Magistrate  and  dismissed  the  Appellant's  application."
"The Appellant has filed this purported Petition of Appeal seeking to set aside"
"the judgment of the learned High Court Judge."
"On perusal  of the  entirety  of the judgment of the  learned High Court"
"is  apparent  that  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has 
taken 
into 
Judge, 
it"
"consideration  the  submissions  made  by  both  parties  and  has  come  to  the"
"conclusion  that 
the  Appellant  has 
failed 
to  show  cause  as  required  by"
"Section 9 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act."
"Hence, I do  not see any error in the manner in which the  learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  considered the  facts  and  the  way  in  which  he  has  applied"
"the law in this instance."
