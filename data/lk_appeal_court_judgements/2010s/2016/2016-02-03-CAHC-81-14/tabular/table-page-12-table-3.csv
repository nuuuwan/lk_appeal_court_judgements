"Court  of Appeal,  because  Courts  of Appeal  recognize  the  priceless  advantage  which  a"
"Judge  of first  instance  has  in  matters  of that kind,  as  contrasted  with  any Judge  of a"
"Court  of Appeal,  who  can  only  learn  from  paper or from  narrative  of those  who  were"
"present.  It  is  very rare  that,  in  questions of veracity so  direct  and so  specific as  these,  a"
"Court of Appeal will over-rule a Judge  of first instance"".  In  the present case,  the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  well  analysed  all  the  evidence  before  him  in  his  Judgment  and"
"accordingly  he  has  not  noticed  any  untrustworthiness  of 
the  victim's 
testimony."
"Furthermore,  even 
though  we  can  only  come 
to  a  decision  by  going  through 
the"
"proceedings,  we  also  do  not  see  any  untrustworthiness  of  the  victim's  evidence."
"Moreover,  merely  because 
the  police  did  not  receive  any 
letter  from  victim  or  the"
"investigations  did  not start as  a result  of the  letter written  by the  victim  to  the  police,"
"we cannot say  that the victim did  not send  such  a letter or the appellant did  not commit"
"such  an  act.  However, 
the  victim  had  stated 
that  she  did  not  mention  any  of  the"
"incidents  she  faced  in  that  letter  but  merely  mentioned  that  she 
is  unsafe  at  home."
