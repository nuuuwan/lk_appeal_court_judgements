"victim had prayed for the protection of her aunt when she experienced annoyance from"
"the  uncle  but unfortunately she  had  not received  the  required  protection  from  her.  In"
"such  kind of a situation we cannot expect an  enormous bravery from this kind  of a child"
"to divulge  or reveal  all  the annoyance  she  went through  to a third  person  and  to seek"
"protec~ion from that person. This is  because these kinds of children  live in fear and they"
"know that if her attempt goes wrong, she  will have to come back to the same guardians"
"and then she will have to face much more grievances than in the present."
"Nevertheless, it is  evident that the victim in this case,  even though she was a small  child"
"at the time of the incident, had  tried  her best to inform some  proper authorities about"
"the grievances she faced.  Furthermore, as  the learned ASG  pointed  out, we should take"
"cognizance of the fact that, when  an  ordinary thirteen (13)  year old school  girl  is  raped,"
"she  would  not know that, what had  occurred to her is  an  'offence', and that she  should"
"immediately  rush  to  lodge  her  complaint  regarding  the  matter  at  the  nearest  police"
