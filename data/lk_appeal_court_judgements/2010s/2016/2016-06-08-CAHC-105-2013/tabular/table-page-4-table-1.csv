"As  such,  the  learned Trial  Judge  held  an  inquiry  when  the  Appellant"
"made  an  application  to  have  the  said  vehicle  released  to  him  relying  upon"
"Section  79(1)  of the  said  Act.  After  the  inquiry,  the  learned  Trial  Judge,"

"Appellant had not proved his case on balance of probability the learned Trial"
"Judge has correctly made the Order of confiscation of the vehicle."
"I will now consider the evidence, which the Appellant had given at the"
