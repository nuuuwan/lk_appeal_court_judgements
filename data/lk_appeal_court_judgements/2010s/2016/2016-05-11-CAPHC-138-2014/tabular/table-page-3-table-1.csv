"Malinie Gunaratne, J."
"The  6th  and  7th  suspects 
in  Magistrate's  Court  of Negombo  Case No."
"B  1074113  were  arrested  and produced before the  Magistrate on  15/07/2014"
"and 15/02/2014 respectively by officers of the Narcotics Bureau."
"As  the  suspects have been remanded 
two Bail Applications were  filed  in"
"the  High  Court  of Negombo  bearing  Nos.  HCBA  108/2014  and  HCBA"
"109/2014 respectively."
"On the  17th of September 2014 the  learned High Court Judge granted bail"
"to the two suspects.  The said Orders granting bail have been marked as Y  1"
"and Z 1 and tendered along with the Petition."
"On  the  19th  of September  2014,  two  days  after  the  said  bail  orders  were"
"made, the learned High Court Judge ofNegombo, cancelled the  said Orders"
"granting bail.  The said Orders were marked Y 2 and Z 2 and tendered along"
"with the Petition.  The present bail application has been filed  in view of the"
"aforesaid two Orders under Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."
"After filing  objections  by  the  Respondent the  case  was  fixed  for  inquiry."
"When  the  case  was  taken  up  for  inquiry  on  16/06/2015,  the  learned  State"
"Counsel,  on  behalf of the  Respondent  raised  a  preliminary  objection  with"
"regard to the  maintainability of this application.  The  learned State  Counsel"
"contended, 
according 
to 
the 
oral 
submissions  made 
by 
the 
learned"
"President's Counsel, that this application is not a Revision application nor an"
"Appeal.  This is not an application seeking original jurisdiction of this Court"
"too.  Hence the learned State Counsel's contention was that, according to the"
"law there cannot be any other application available in a bail matter."
