"person  who  has  possessed peacefully  but  cannot  establish  clear"
"title  or  ownership  to  be  restored  to  possession  and be  quieted in"
"possession.  This  development of the law appears to have arisen due"
"to  the  need to  protect de facto  possession.  It  is  different from  the"
"right of an  owner recovering his possession through  a vindicatory"
"action.  Our  courts  have  always  emphasized that  the plaintiff who"
"institutes  a vindicatory action  must prove title.  (Vide  Wanigaratne"
"v.  Juwanis Appuhamy. (7))"
