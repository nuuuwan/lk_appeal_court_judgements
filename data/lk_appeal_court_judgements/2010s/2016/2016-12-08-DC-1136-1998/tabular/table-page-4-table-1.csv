"U.  De Z.  Gunawardana, J.  held in the case of Ruberu and another"
"V.  Wijesooriya  [1998]  1 Sri L R 58 at page 60 that;"
"But  whether  it  is  a  licensee  or  a  lessee, 
the  question  of title  is"
"foreign 
to  a  suit  in  ejectment  against  either.  The 
licensee  (the"
"defendant-respondent)  obtaining possession  is  deemed to  obtain  it"
"upon  the  terms  that  he  will  not  dispute  the  title  of him, 
i. e. 
the"
"plaintiff-appellant  without  whose  permission,  he  (the  defendant"
"respondent)  would not have  got  it.  The  effect  of the  operation  of"
"section  116 of the Evidence  Ordinance  is  that if a  licensee desires"
"to challenge the title under which he is  in occupation he must, first,"
"quit  the 
land.  The  fact  that  the 
licensee  or  the 
lessee  obtained"
"possession from  the plaintiff-appellant is perforce an  admission  of"
"the fact that the title resides in the plaintiff. No question of title can"
"in 
this  case, 
because,  as 
the 
possibly  arise  on 
the  pleadings"
"defendant-respondent  has  stated in  his  answer  that  he  is  a  lessee"
"under  the plaintiff-appellant,  he  is  estopped from  denying the  title"
"of the  plaintiff-appellant.  It  is  an 
inflexible  rule  of law  that  no"
"lessee or licensee will ever be permitted either to  question  the  title"
"of the  person  who  gave  him 
the 
lease  or 
the 
licence  or 
the"
"permission  to  occupy or possess the  land or to  set up want of title"
"in  that person,  i. e.  of the person who gave the licence or the lease."
"That being so, it is superfluous, in  this action, framed as it is on the"
"is  a 
licensee, 
to 
seek  a 
basis 
that 
the  defendant-respondent"
"declaration of title."
"In 
the  present  case  Rubasinghe  under  whom 
the  Appellant 
is"
"claiming has  admitted the  Respondent's title and therefore  she is  estoped"
"from  denying the title of the Respondent."
