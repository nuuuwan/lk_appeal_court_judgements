"without any encumbrances. All  these transactions had  taken  place,  whilst the three"
"Defendants  had  been 
living  in 
the  house  on  the  land  since  their  childhood.  The"
"version  of the  Defendants  is  narrated  by  their answers  but it is  the  1st  Defendant"
"Appellant who testified in support of the claim.  It has to be  stated that whilst the 1st"
"and  2nd  Defendants filed a joint answer, the 3rd  Defendant filed a solitary answer."
"The version of the Defendant is that since their mother had  abandoned them during"
"their infancy,  it was  the great-grandmother-Emaly  Engeltina  who  brought them  up"
"and  fended  for  them.  These  matters  are  not  in  contention,  except  the  issues  on"
"which 
the  dispute  went  to

"father divested  himself of his  life -
interest which  he  had  reserved for himself in the"
"deed  of gift dated  22 nd  September 1985. Two things  need  to be  stated  at his  stage."
"Certain  positions  that had  been  taken  in  the  respective  pleadings  were abandoned"
"by  the  parties  when  it came  to the  question  of raising  issues.  Whilst  the  Plaintiff"
"stated  in  herplaint that she  gave  leave  and  license to the  Defendants to stay  in  the"
"promises,  her  issues  at  the  trial  were  premised  as 
to  whether  the  Defendants"
"became the  licensees  of her predecessor  in  title  namely  her father.  In  other words"
"Plaintiff's issues raised  the question of her predecessor granting leave and  license to"
"the Defendants.  In  the same way, though the 1st Defendant pleaded  prescription, he"
"abandoned it at the trial."
"The  1st  and  2nd  Defendants  who  filed  a joint answer  on  26th  August  1993,  pleaded"
"contractive  trust  in 
that  thy  both  averred

"Engeltina  who tendered for them thought that the  land  - the subject matter of the"
