"constructive  trust  in  favour  of the  Defendants,  and  therefore  the  Plaintiff  cannot"
"maintain this action. These two objections were raised  in the form of issues No.6-10."
"Answering the  issues  raised  by the  Defendants  in  the  negative,  the learned  District"
"Judge  delivered the judgment on  01st  October 2000 in favour of the Plaintiff. The  1st"
"Defendant has only preferred this appeal against this judgment."
"The contention that the Plaintiff could not maintain this action on the ground that at"
"the  time  of filing the  plaint,  the  3rd  Defendant,  was  a minor could  not hold  water"
"because the 3rd  Defendant was  born on  osth  May 1973 (vide his  birth certificate V1)"
"and  he  reached  18 years on osth  May 1991. (vide Age  of Majority Act No.17 of 1989"
"which  makes  a person  of 18 years  is  a major).  This  action  was  filed  by the  Plaintiff"
"on  24th  August  1990. Though  the action was  filed  at a time when  the 3rd  Defendant"
"was  a minor, but on the day summons was served  on  him, i.e., on 01st  July 1991, he"
"had  attained  majority,  i.e.,  he  became  18  years  of age. 
In  view  of the  decision  in"
"Siebert vs.  New Asia Trading  Co.  Ltd.  66 N.L.R.  460,  the  3rd  Defendant,  since  soon"
"th"
"July 1991, 
after filing of the plaint, had attained majority and filed  his answer on 29"
"the action was  not void ab initio and  it could be  maintained against him."
"Since  the 3rd  Defendant, soon  after the fling of the action,  became a major and  filed"
"his answer, the action could validly continue without the appointment of a guardian"
"ad litem. Thus the main issue  of the Defendants that the 3rd  Defendant was a minor"
"at the time  of the  institution  of the  action  and  therefore the  action  could  not  be"
"maintained cannot succeed and therefore should be rejected."
"Issue  No.9  has  been  raised  on  the  basis  that the  said  Engeltina  did  not donate the"
"property  directly to the  Defendants  because  they  were  minors.  This  issue  has  no"
"legal  bearing  because  there  is  no 
law  in  this  country  which  precludes  donations"
