"","claim damages. As to what constitutes a promise in writing has been considered by several judicial"

"I","""that  documentary  evidence  which  does  not  in  express  or  other  unequivocal  terms  contain"
"I I","promise to marry is insufficient to prove a promise in writing even though it may afford evidence"

"","of an oral promise to marry. The writing required to satisfy the ordinance must contain an express"
"I",""
"I","promise to marry or confirm a previous oral promise to marry, i.e., admit the making ofthe promise"
"!","and evince continuing willingness to be bound by it"""
"","In the present case there had not been any such promise in writing that has been produced at the"
"","trial.  The  only  evidence  produced  was  the  oral  evidence  as  to  a  promise  of marriage.  It was"
"","contended that this evidence is not sufficient for the respondent to obtain a judgment for damages"
"","against the appellant on breach of a promise of marriage."
