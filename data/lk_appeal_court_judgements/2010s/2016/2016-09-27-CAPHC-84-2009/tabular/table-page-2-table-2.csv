"Secretary  of  Imbulpe, 
filed 
an 
application  under 
the  State  Lands"
"(Recovery  of Possession)  Act to  recover the  possession of the  land.  The"
"learned Magistrate dismissed the  application on the technical ground that"
"the  Respondent 
(the  applicant 
in 
that  case)  has 
failed 
to 
tender  an"
"application 
in 
the  prescribed  form  with 
the  affidavit.  Thereafter, 
the"
"Respondent 
filed 
the  present  application 
in 
the  Magistrate  Court  of"
"Balangoda  under  section  42(2)  of the  Land  Acquisition  Act  no.  09  of"
"1950  (as  amended)  seeking  for  an  order  to  evict  the  Appellant.  The"
"Applicant  filed  objection 
to 
this  application  mainly  on 
two  grounds,"
"firstly  that  the  acquisition  was  done  under  proviso  of section  38  of the"
"Act  for  an  urgent  requirement  but  the  action  was  instituted  after  eleven"
"years  and  therefore  the  urgent  requirement  cannot  exist  and  secondly"
"pleaded  res judicata.  The  learned  Magistrate  rejected the  objections  and"
"allowed  the  application  to  evict  the  Applicant.  Being  aggrieved  by  the"
"said  order the  Appellant  moved  the  matter in  revision  in the  High  Court"
"of Rathnapura.  The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  dismissed  the  revision"
"application. This appeal is  from that order."
