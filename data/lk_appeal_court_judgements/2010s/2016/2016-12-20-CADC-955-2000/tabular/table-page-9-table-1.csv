to  meet  the  circumstances 
that  can  be"
"foreseen  and  once  provision  has  been  made  in 
the  Statute  the  occasion  to"
"invoke  inherent  power  in  that  circumstance  practically  vanishes.  Thus,  when"
"the  Statute  provides  a  method so  as  to  meet a  contingency  in  a  particular"
"manner any other method thought of by the Court cannot then be said to be a"
"method which  would advance the interest of justice.  It is  in  this sense,  that no"
"occasion  for 
the  exercise  of any  inherent  power  arises  when 
the  statute"
"expressly provides for what is to be done in that situation. The remedy provided"
"by the Statute may not be an  efficacious one.  It  may even lack the necessities"
