"Invocation of Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code"
"Having  failed 
in  his  revision  application  before  this  Court  on  27th  June  2000,  the"
"Defendant 
thereafter  proceeded 
to  seek 
relief  under  Section  839  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code in the District Court of Matale seeking inter alia:-"
"(a) to suspend the writ of execution against him;"
"(b) to order that the order made on  12.02.1999 was a nullity;"
"It has to be  remembered that the abortive revision  application before this court had"
"challenged  the  order  of the  learned  District Judge  dated  12the  February  1999  and"
"despite  the  failure  of that  challenge  before  this  Court,  the  Defendant  was  again"
"seeking  to  impugn  the  order  dated  12the  February  1999  -
a  course  of action  he"
"advisedly 
thought  was  available 
to  him  due 
to 
the 
flexibility  of  the 
inherent"
"jurisdiction bestowed in Section 839 of the Civil  Procedure Code."

"The  learned  District Judge,  however,  by his  order dated  31
August 2000,  dismissed"
"the  Defendant's application  to invoke  his  inherent powers  under Section  839  of the"
"Civil  Procedure  Code.  Having failed  in  his  invocation  of Section  839 jurisdiction, the"
"Defendant has thereafter filed the present appeal to this Court seeking the following"
"relief namely:-"
"(a) to set aside the order dated 31.08.2000 of the District Court of Matale;"
"(b) to  send  the  case  back  for  a fresh 
inquiry  in  terms  of the  application  made"
"under Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code;"
"(c) to  make  Order 
that 
the  defendant-appellant 
is 
the 
lawful  holder  of  the"
"premises in question under the State."
"I venture  to  state  that  this  appeal  is  totally  a  misconception  of the  law  and  more"
"particularly the  provisions  of Section  839  of the Civil  Procedure  Code  which  refer to"
"inherent powers of Court.  It is  needless to repeat the facts  of this case  as  this Court"
