"abduction  was 
to  eliminate  him.  However  this  court  observes 
that, 
the  Indictment  served  by  the"
"Attorney General did  not carry charges under section 355 of the Penal Code but, the charges were only"
"under section 356."
"As against the  above position, on behalf of the  lSI  and  2nd  Accused-Respondents it was submitted that"
"the  Learned  Trial  Judge  had  properly  evaluated  the  material,  specially  the  mitigatory  factors  of this"
"lSI  Accused  -
case  when  imposing  the  said  sentences.  According  to  the  Accused-Respondents,  the"
"Respondent  is  the  wife  of the  Aggrieved  Party  Petitioner  and  since  she  believed  that  her  husband"
"needs  psychiatric  treatment,  she  suggested  to  the  Aggrieved  Party  Petitioner  on  several  occasion  to"
"lSI 
consult  a  Psychiatrist.  Since  the  Aggrieved  Party  Petitioner  has  rejected  the  above  request,  the"
"Accused-Respondent  has  planned  with  her  brother 
to 
take 
the  Aggrieved  Party  Petitioner 
to  a"
"the 
psychiatrist 
in  a  semi  conscious  state  and  her  brother 
the  2nd  Accused-Respondent  obtained"
"assistance of two of his medical student friends for this purpose."
"It is  observed  by  this  court  that  the  conduct  of the 
lSI  and  the  2nd  Accrued-Respondents  and  their"
"planning  to  commit  this  offence  does  not  show  that  they  have  come  to  carry  out an  operation which"
"will  ended  up 
in  another  grave  crime.  If the 
first  Accused-Respondent  who 
is 
the  wife  of  the"
"Aggrieved Party Petitioner wanted to eliminate the Aggrieved Party Petitioner as stated in his evidence"
"before High Court,  it is very unlikely that the  lSI Accused -Respondent will come personally to  abduct"
"her  husband  with  her  own brother.  Out  of the  other  three  members of the  unlawful  assembly  two  are"
"medical students who  came to  inject a sedative  drug in order to  facilitate  the  abduction but there  were"
"no other members in  the  unlawful assembly who are criminal elements."
"Therefore  the  above  conduct  of  the 
lSI  and  the  2nd  Accused-Appellants  appears  to  be  more  of  an"
"innocent act rather than an organized criminal act."
