"","It is  an admitted fact  by  all  parties that the disputed roadway belongs"
"","to the Railway Department.  However, the Appellant has claimed that he has"
"","been 
in  possession  of  the 
land 
for  more 
than 
10  years, 
and 
the  3 rd"
"","Respondent has claimed that he has been in possession for about 15  years."
"","Having  considered  the  contents  of the  affidavits  and  the  documents"
"","filed  by  the  parties,  the  learned  Magistrate  has,  rejected  the  claim  made  by"
"","the  Appellant  and  the  3rd  Respondent  for  the  land  as  they  were  not  able  to"
"","produce  a  valid  permit  or  written  authority  to  possess  the  land.  However,"
"","the  learned Magistrate  has  held  that the  1 st  Respondent has  the  right to  use"
"","the  disputed 
roadway  and  ordered 
the  2nd  Respondent 
to 
remove 
all"
"","obstructions placed across the road.  Undoubtedly, this order has  been made"
"","by  the  learned  Primary  Court  Judge  in  terms  of the  provisions  of Section"
"","69(1) and (2) of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"","On perusal  of the  entirety  of the judgment of the  learned High Court"
"","is  apparent  that  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has 
taken 
into 
Judge, 
it"
"","consideration  the  submissions  made  by  all  parties  and  has  come 
to 
the"
"","conclusion  that  there  is  no  basis  to  interfere  with  the  Order  made  by  the"
"","learned Primary Court Judge."
"","Hence,  I do  not see  any  error in which the  learned High  Court Judge"
"","has considered the facts  and the way  in which he has applied the  law in this"
"","instance."
"","There  is  no  reason to  interfere with the judgment of the  learned High"
"","Court Judge of Ratnapura.  Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs."
