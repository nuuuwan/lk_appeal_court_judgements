"by  a higher  Court,  it  regulated  by  well  established principles.  It has  been  held  in"
"the case ofWijewardane v.  Lenora 60 NLR 457 at 463  that;"
"The  mode  of approach  of an  appellate  Court  to  an  appeal  against  an"
"exercise  of discretion  is  regulated by  well  established principles.  It  is  not"
"enough that the Judges composing the  appellate  Court consider that,  if they"
"had been in the position of the trial Judge,  they would have taken a different"
"course. 
It  must  appear  that  some  error  has  been  made  in  exercising  the"
"discretion.  It must appear that the  Judge  has acted illegally,  arbitrarily or"
"irrelevant 
upon  a  wrong  principle  of law  or  allowed  extraneous  or"
"considerations  to  guide  or affect him,  or that he  has  mistaken the facts,  or"
"not  taken 
into  account  some  material  consideration.  Then  only  can  his"
"determination be reviewed by the appellate Court."
"I will  set down the  chronological  events of the  case with the relevant dates."
