"High  Court Judge  cannot stand before  law.  Therefore I set aside the Order"
"of the learned High Court Judge made on 22.01.2007."
"For the aforesaid reasons I allow the Appeal."
"However,  it is  significant to  note that the Appellant has not sought to"
"set  aside  the  Order  dated  31.05.2005  made  by  the  learned  Primary  Court"
"Judge  of Balangoda.  Hence,  the  Order  of the  Primary  Court  Judge  would"
"prevail in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant."
"JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"
"P.R. Walgama, J."
"I agree"
"JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"
"Appeal is allowed."
