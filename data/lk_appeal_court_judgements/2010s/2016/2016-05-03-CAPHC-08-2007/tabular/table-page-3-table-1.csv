"Aggrieved  by  the  said  Order,  the  Appellant  sought to  revise  the  said"
"Order by Revision Application No.  HCRIRAI63/2005  filed  before the  High"
"Court Rathnapura."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  of Rathnapura  having  considered  the"
"submissions  made  by  both  parties  dismissed  the  Revision  Application  by"
"Order dated 22.01.2007."
"The Appellant being aggrieved by the said Order preferred an Appeal"
"to this  Court seeking to  set aside the Order made by the  learned High Court"
"Judge dated 22.01.2007."
"When  this  appeal  was  taken  up  for  argument,  the  Respondent  was"
"absent  and  unrepresented. 
Hence,  the  Court  heard  only  the  submissions"
"made by the Counsel for the Appellant."
"It is the first and principal stance of the Counsel for the Appellant, that"
"the 
finding  of the 
learned  Primary  Court  Judge 
is  contrary 
to  his  own"
"findings  made  in  the  same  Order  regarding  the  possession  of the  land  in"
"dispute."
"In an inquiry where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or"
"part  thereof  it  shall  be 
the  duty  of the  Judge  of the  Primary  Court  to"
"determine as  to  who was  in possession of the land or the part thereof on the"
"date  of filing  of the  information under Section 66  and make order as to  who"
"is  entitled  to  possession of such  land  or part thereof.  But where  a  forcible"
"dispossession  has  taken  place  within  a  period  of two  months  immediately"
"before the date on which the information was  filed under Section 66, he may"
"make an order directing that the party dispossessed be restored to possession"
