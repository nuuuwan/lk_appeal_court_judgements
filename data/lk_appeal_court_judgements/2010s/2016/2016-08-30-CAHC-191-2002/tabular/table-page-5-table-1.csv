"'Narayan  Renddy,  Keet  Simpson,  Chandrasiri  Nirialle  etc.)"
"It 
cannot 
be 
argued 
that 
touching 
or 
placing 
a 
finger 
for"
"sexual  gratificate  are 
ingredients 
comprised 
in 
a 
charge 
of"
"rape. 
Because  without 
any 
fingering  or 
touching 
the  offence"
"of 
rape 
could  be 
committed. 
Therefore 
I 
am 
inclined 
to 
the"
"view 
that 
none 
of 
these 
sections 
in 
the  Criminal 
Procedure"
"Code  with 
regard 
to 
framing 
of 
charges 
could  be 
applied 
to"
"justify  the  cause  adopted  by 
the  trial  judge 
in  this  case. 
We"
"also 
find 
that 
the  accused  was  gravely  prejudiced  by 
the 
fact"
"that 
the 
trial 
judge 
failed 
to 
inform  him  of 
the 
charge  of"
"grave 
sexual 
abuse 
giving 
him 
the 
opportunity 
to 
defend"
"himself 
on 
that 
charge. 
Instead 
the 
judge 
has 
at 
the"
"conclusion  of  his 
judgment 
arrived  at 
a 
decision 
to 
convict"
"him  for  grave  sexual  abuse 
instead  of  rape."
"This 
is 
a 
grave 
irregularity  and 
a 
glaring  error  of 
law, 
it"
"cannot 
be 
condoned 
no 
excused. 
Therefore  we 
are 
unable 
to"
"apply 
the  proviso 
to  article  138, 
or 
the  proviso 
to 
section"
"334  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code.'"
