"While the Petitioner in  his written submissions  has  admitted  making this"
"allegation against this Intervenient Party,  the course of action  he  has"
"suggested  is for this Intervenient Party to hand over an  affidavit answering"
"this allegation  through the 1st  Respondent of which  he  is the Registrar."
"However,  question arises as  to what would  happen  if such  opportunity was"
"not afforded to this Intervenient Party  by the  1st  Respondent as  1st"
"Respondent would  only be concerned  about his  interest in  this case  and"
"may  not necessarily be the private interests of this Intervenient Party in  his"
"private capacity."
"It stands to reason  that a party against whom  an  allegation  is  made  must"
"be  afforded an  opportunity of defending  himself."
