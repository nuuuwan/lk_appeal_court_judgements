"such 
land  or  part 
thereof,  the 
Judge  of 
the  Primary  Court  shall"
"determine 
as 
to  who 
is 
entitled 
to 
the 
right  which 
is 
the"
"subject 
of 
the

"It  was 
also 
the 
contention 
of 
the  Respondent 
that  there 
is 
a"
"the  alleged 
road  way 
is 
a  part  of 
the 
Partition  case 
in  which"
"land 
sought 
to 
be 
partitioned.  But 
it 
said 
that 
the 
petitioner"
"has 
never 
intervened 
to 
vindicate 
his 
rights 
in 
the 
said"
"in 
perusing 
the  documents  marked 
2P2, 
partition 
case.  Further"
"2P3,2P4 
the  Learned  Magistrate  was  of 
the  view 
that 
the 
said"
"road  way. 
documents  do  not  depict  an  existence  of  the  alleged"
"The 
Learned  Magistrate 
has 
also 
held 
that 
any 
order  made"
"under  Section 
66 
of 
the  Primary  Court  Act,  will  not  be 
a  bar"
"for 
any  determination 
to  be 
taken 
in 
a  Civil  Court.  Any 
action"
"under 
Section 
66 
of 
the 
Primary  Court 
Procedure  Act 
is 
to"
"to  preserve 
the  peace 
between 
the  parties 
to 
the 
make  order"
"dispute 
till 
a 
competent 
court 
decides 
the 
rights 
of 
the"
"parties.  Therefore 
any  order  made  by  a  Magistrate 
in 
terms  of"
"the  Primary  Court  Act  will 
be 
only 
a 
temporary  order  which"
"is  not  capable  of  deciding 
the 
rights  of 
the  parties 
thereto."
"Further 
it  was 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Learned  Magistrate 
that"
"mere 
fact 
that 
the 
said 
plans  do 
not  depict  a 
road  way  does"
"not 
exclude 
the 
fact 
that 
disputed 
road 
way  was 
not 
in"
"therefore 
the  Learned  Magistrate  was 
persuaded 
existence,  and"
"to 
reject 
the 
said  argument  of  the  Respondent."
