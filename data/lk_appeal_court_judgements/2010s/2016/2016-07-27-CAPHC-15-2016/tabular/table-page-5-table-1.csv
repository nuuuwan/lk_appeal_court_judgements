"I think the  true  definition  is  this.  I conceive  that an  order is  ""final""  only"
"where  it  is  made  upon  an  application  or  other  proceeding  which  must,"
"whether  such  application  of other proceeding  fail  or  succeed,  determine"
"the  action.  Conversely  I  think  that  an  order  is  ""interlocutory""  where  it"
"cannot be affirmed that in either event the action will be determined."
