"It is  now  pertinent to  peruse  the  petition  and  written  submissions  of"
"the  Petitioner  in  order  to  determine  whether  the  Petitioner  has  pleaded  or"
"established  such  exceptional  circumstances. 
It is  abundantly  clear that  the"
"Petitioner  has  not 
specifically  or 
expressly  pleaded 
such 
exceptional"
"circumstances."

"09.01.2002  and 
followed  by  Urban  Development  Authority  vs.  Ceylon"
"Entertainers Ltd. And another (Supra) the rigid rule was formulated 
in order"
"to justify the  exercise  of revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal,  on"
"examination of either the  Petition or Affidavit which must reveal  a specific"
"plea as to the existence of special circumstances."
"The contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that though"
"the  phrase  ""exceptional  circumstances  exist""  has  not  been  used 
in 
the"
"Petition,  the  questions  of law  raised  in  Paragraph  (21)  of the  Petition  do"
"constitute exceptional circumstances on the face  of it."
"I  disagree  with 
the 
submissions  of  the 
learned  Counsel 
for 
the"
"Petitioner that the averments in Paragraph 21  of the Petition purporting to set"
"out exceptional circumstances is factually and legally unsupportable."
"Due  to 
the  aforesaid  reasons, 
this  Court  has  no  alternative  but  to"
"conclude  that  the  Petitioner  failed  to  substantiate  presence  of exceptional"
"circumstances  by  way  of  illegality  or  error  on 
the 
face  of  the 
record."
"Accordingly his plea for invoking of discretionary revisionary powers of this"
"Court must necessarily fail."
