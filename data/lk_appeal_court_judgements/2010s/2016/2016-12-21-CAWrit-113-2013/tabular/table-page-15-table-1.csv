"","markings into the briefs,  the observation of this Court is  that these"
"","acts could  be deliberate acts.  If such  acts are deliberate,  it would  be"
"","reasonable to infer that those acts  have  been  committed  by an"
"","interested party. This document is a document that has  not been"

"","against him, it would  be the petitioner who would  benefit, if this"
"","court by any chance  missed  it.  Learned  Senior State Counsel  had"
"","later tendered a copy of this document to Court along with  his"
"","written submissions."
"","There is  no doubt that Courts  must frown  upon these kinds of acts,  if"
"","they had  been  done deliberately.  Hence we  decide to direct the"
"","Registrar to make a formal  complaint to Police  so  that this matter"
"","could  be  investigated  into,  in  order to find  out as to whether there  is"
"","any  misconduct and  if so,  as  to who  is  responsible  for such  acts of"
"","misconduct.  Registrar is  directed to keep the docket and  the briefs in"
"","his safe custody until  the  law enforcement authorities could  have"
"","access  to them."
