If the calculation is wrong the"

"","gratuity."
"","The  sole  question  arising  for  decision  in  this  application  is  whether"
"","the certificate filed by the Respondent under Section 8(2) of the Payment of"
"","Gratuity Act is  final and conclusive."
"","Section 8(2) reads as follows:"
"","(2) The Commissioner's certificate shall be prima facie evidence that"
"","the  amount due  under this  Act  from  the  defaulter has  been duly  calculated,"
"","and that the amount is in default."
"","The  contention  of the  learned  Counsel  was  that  the  legislature  by"
"","usmg 
the  words  ""the  Commissioner's  certificate  shall  be  prima 
facie"
"","evidence"",  a  provision  has  been  made  for  the  defaulter  to  show  cause  and"
"","displace the effect of the prima facie evidence  by offering further evidence"
"","of an inconsistent or contradictory nature."
"","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner,  in  support  of his  contention"
"","has  cited  the  case  X  Employer  vs.  Deputy  Commissioner  of Labour  and"
"","Others (1991)  1 SLR  page 222. 
In this connection the reasoning adopted in"
"","that case would be helpful in resolving the question in issue."
"","As  Gunasekera  J.  pointed  out  in  that  case,  thus  the  legislature"
"","by  using  the  words  that  the  certificate  is  only  ""prima  facie  evidence"" 
by"
"","unequivocal 
and 
unambiguous 
language 
has  made 
provision 
for 
the"
"","defaulters to  show cause and displace the effect of the  prima facie  evidence"
"","by offering further evidence of an inconsistent or contradictory nature."
