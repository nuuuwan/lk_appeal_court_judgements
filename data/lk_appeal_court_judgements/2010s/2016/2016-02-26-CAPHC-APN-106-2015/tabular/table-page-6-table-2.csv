"On a consideration of the proceedings in this case,  I hold that there"
"has  been  a  miscarriage  of justice.  The  object  of the  power  of"
"revision  as  stated  by  Sansoni  CJ. 
in  Mariam  Beebee  v.  Seyed"

the  due  administration  of justice .

In 
the"
"words ofSoza, J. 
in Somawathie v.  Madawala and others (5).  ""The"
"court will not  hesitate  to  use  its  revisionary powers  to  give  relief"
"where a miscarriage of justice has occurred . .. Indeed the facts of"
"this case cry aloud for the intervention of this court to prevent what"
"be 
a  miscarriage 
of  justice."" 
The  words

"underlined above  are  equally applicable  to  the present case.  I  am"
"accordingly  of the  view  that  the  Court  of Appeal  was  in  serious"
"error  when  it  declined  to  exercise  its  revisionary  powers  having"
"regard  to  the  very  special  and exceptional  circumstances  of this"
