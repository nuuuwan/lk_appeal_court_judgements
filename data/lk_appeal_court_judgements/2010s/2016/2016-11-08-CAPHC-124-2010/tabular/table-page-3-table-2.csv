"possession.  On 3rd  May 2008  he gifted the said portion to  his  daughter by"

"contradiction in  identifying the  land.  In deed no.  47 undivided portion of"

"the  deed  of  gift  no.  47

"uninterrupted  possession.  Therefore  the  difference

"section  66  of the Primary Court Procedure Act the  Court is  not expected"
"to  decide

title  deeds  are  only  supporting"
"documents to establish the possession."
