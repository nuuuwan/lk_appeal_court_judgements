"Walawwawatte from the road on  its western boundary. It is clear that the Defendant"
"has  encroached  on  to the Plaintiff's  land  and  made a road  way to take  his  car to his"
"house. The  Defendant in  his  evidence admitted that he  bought a car in  1990 and  he"
"had  no car  prior to 1990.  It is  settled  law that even  if there existed a right of using a"
"foot-path  (iter),  it  does  not  include  the  right  to  take  a vehicle  over  that  path.  It is"
"nothing more than the right of being able to come and  go on  foot - Corenelis Singho"

"v.  Perera."
"It is  also  clear  that when  the  Defendant  bought  his  land  by  Deed  No.1295  (V2),  no"
"access  road  was  provided  for in  the said  deed.  The  Defendant was  using the access"
"road through the Royal  garage as  referred to above. This access  contained a flight of"
"steps and since 1975, this access  has  been  in existence. This was the access shown as"
"a road  by the vendor. This is admitted by the wife of the Defendant in her evidence."
"It appears that the learned District Judge has analyzed this evidence carefully and  has"
"come  to a conclusion  that there  was  no  road  in  existence  through  lot 2B  shown  in"
"Plan  P2  and  that lot 4,  which  belongs  to the  Defendant has  a road  way or access  to"
"the main road  by or through the back portion of (Royal garage'."
"According  to the totality of the  evidence  led  in  this  case,  I am  of the  view that the"
"Defendant  has  unlawfully encroached  upon  a portion of the  land  which  is  shown  as"
"lot  2B  in  Plan  NO.2049  dated  20th  January  1991  made  by  K.S.  Panditharathne,  and"
"that  the  Defendant  has  no  right  of way  through  the  land  of the  Plaintiff as  stated"
"above."
