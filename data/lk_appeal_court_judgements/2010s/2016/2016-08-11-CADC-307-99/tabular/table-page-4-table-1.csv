"house  on the eastern  side.  But in  1973 this  road  was  not there.  Only in April  1990 it"
"was  created for the first time. The  road  shown by him was a private road  which goes"
"only to the  land  of Panabokke.  It was  Panabokke  who  made  this  road.  This  witness"
"clearly states that when  he  made this Plan  NO.2049  in  1973, this road  was  not there."
"Even  a foot path was not there."
"He  further  stated  that this  foot  path  was  later  made  into  a  big  road  by  the  Town"
"Council  but this  road  was  not used  to  provide  access  to the  Defendant's  land.  The"
"Defendant  had  put rolled  gate  posts  but there was  no gate. This  witness  denies  the"
"road  shown  by  surveyor  T~nnakoon in  broken  lines  in  the  Plan  marked  as  V1. 
If a"
"surveyor is  not certain about a road,  he  may show it in  broken lines. That is  how the"
"surveyor  Tennakoon  has  shown  it.  When  the  witness  Panditharathne  went  to  the"
"place on  2nd  April 1991, there was a road."
"According  to this  witness,  when  he  surveyed  the  land  in  1973  (Please  see  the  Plan"
"marked  as  P1),  there was  no  road  as  claimed  by the Defendant. This  road  came  into"
"existence  only  subsequently  in  1991.  It  has  to  be  stated  that the  evidence  by  this"
"witness was  not contradicted by the Defendant."
"After  this  witness, 
the  Plaintiff's  father  Molagoda  has 
testified  on  behalf  of  the"
"Plaintiff.  He  has  traced the title. of the  Plaintiff, and  said  that in  April  1989, when  he"
"went to this  land  he  saw  only a foot path  which  is  shown  as  2B  in  Plan  P2.  Again  in"
"1990 when  he  went to this  land  he  saw the foot path.  But the  land  was fenced  with"
"barbed wire. This foot path  was  later made into a road  as  shown  as  2B.  He  said  that"
"they  never allowed  the  Defendant  to  use  it as  a  road.  There  is  another  road  to go"
"from  the  Defendant's  land  to  the  main  road. 
In  other  words  the  Defendant  had"
"another access to the main road."
