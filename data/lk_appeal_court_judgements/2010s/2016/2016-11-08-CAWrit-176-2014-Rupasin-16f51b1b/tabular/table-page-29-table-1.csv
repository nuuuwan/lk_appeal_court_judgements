"","The  Petitioner has also asked  for writs of Mandamus  in  prayers (g) ans  (h)."
"","Prayer (g)  is to seek a writ of Mandamus on  one or more or all  of the  1st  to"
"","16th  Respondents  directing them  to p~omote the  Petitioner to one of the"
"","three of the following  posts in  the  1st  Respondent institution, namely"
"","Director (Laboratory Services  Division);  Director (Product Certification);"
"","Director (Metrology);  Director (SCientific Standardization  Division)."
"","It is  the submission  on  behalf of the Petitioner that the entire interview"
"","process  is  unreasonable,  arbitrary, contrary to the existing  minute and  the"
"","selections  made as a result of such  process  are  not valid  in  law."
"","If the entire interview process has  been  an  arbitrary one selection of any"
"","applicant including the Petitioner cannot be  done from  such  a process."
"","This  court cannot perform the functions of the interviewers and  selectors"
"","and  hence cannot decide at this stage whether or not the Petitioner should"
"","be  picked  up  for the post he  had  applied  for.  Therefore this court is  not in"
"","a position to issue a writ of Mandamus to compel  the  1st  Respondent to"
"","promote the  Petitioner as  has  been  prayed  for in  prayer (f) of the Petition."
