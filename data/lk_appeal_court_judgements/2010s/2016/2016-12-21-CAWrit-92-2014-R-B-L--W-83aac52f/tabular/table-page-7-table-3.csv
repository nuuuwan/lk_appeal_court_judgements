"""It is settled law that, when a property belongs to  someone he attributes all rights inter alia to sell"
"gift,  lease,  mortgage  and  whatever 
he  wishes,  however,  when  that  property  is  subject  to  any"
"relevant law,  the  right of the  owner of the property has 
to  be  often uncounted with entire gamut"
"of rights recognized by the law."
"Hence,  it  is  very  clear  that  the  above  mentioned  proviso  to  section  17  (c)  refers  to  grievances"
"with regard to  monetory  hardships encounted by the purchaser. It does not refer states of health"""
"and  concluded  that  the  extreme  hardships  referred  to  section  17  (c)  only  refers  to  monitory"
"hardships but not otherwise and therefore the board affirmed the decision of the  lSI  Respondent."
