"was that if this appeal is not allowed, the court should invoke its revisionary powers under"
"section 363/365 of the CPC and reverse the ultimate findings of the trial court. As  decided in"
"case No. 155/2000, we are also of the view that allowing such an  application will tantamount"
"the court lending its hand to a person guilty of contumacious conduct and there by assisting"
"him. Therefor we hold that the Petition of Appeal is  not properly constituted and is out of time."
