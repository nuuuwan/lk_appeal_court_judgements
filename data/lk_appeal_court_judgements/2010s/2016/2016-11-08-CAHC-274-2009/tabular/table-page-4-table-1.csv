"After considering section 279 of the Criminal Procedure Code  it was affirmatively decided, that"
"when an  accused against whom a sentence of death has already been passed, is arrested and"
"brought before the High Court, it is not necessary to pronounce the sentence of death and also"
"to record an  allocutus."
"The counsel for the appellant also contented the fact that the,evidence led under section 241"
"inquiry was based on  hearsay evidence and therefor it is  illegal. When considering the"
"proceedings itself, it is very clear that the appellant was deliberately keeping away from court."
"When perusing the brief we find that the accused  appellant was present in open courts and the"
"indictment was served  on  him and the charge was also read out and thereafter he had pleaded"
"not guilty for the charge against him on the 19th  October 2004.Therefor, it is an  obvious fact"
