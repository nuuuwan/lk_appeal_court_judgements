"Samarakoon  c.J  is  quite illustrative.  Once  prima facie evidence  is  produced  by one"
"party,  the  onus  is  on 
the  other  to  rebut  it  by  contrary  evidence.  The  opposing"
"evidence  can  erase  the effect of the prima facie  evidence  evenly or it is  so  cogent"
"that  the  case  could 
tilt  in 
favour  of  the  party  who  tenders  the  opposing  and"
"contrary  evidence.  This  evidence  need  not  necessarily 
take 
the 
form  of  oral"
"testimony.  It could  be  documentary  evidence  alone.  In  my view  both  prima facie"
"evidence  and  contrary  evidence  in  rebuttal  can  be  oral  or documentary  or  both."
"What matters in the end  is  how cogent the evidence is  in order to establish the fact"
