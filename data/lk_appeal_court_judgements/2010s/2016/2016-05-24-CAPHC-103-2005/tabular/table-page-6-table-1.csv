"The 
learned  State  Counsel 
further  contended, 
therefore 
that 
the"
"Appellant's  application  for  two  orders  in  the  nature  of Writ  of Mandamus"
"and Writ of Certiorari is misconceived in law and cannot be maintained."
"It is  relevant to  note that it  was the  1 st  Respondent that had taken the"
"decision (P  16)  and not the Inquiring Officer to reject the appellant's appeal"
"on the report of the inquiring officer appointed by the  1 st  Respondent."
"It is  the  grievance  of the  Appellant,  without  holding  a  fresh  inquiry"
"that  the  1st  Respondent  has  accepted  the  2nd  report  of the  inquiring  officer"

"authorities  from  doing anything which the  law forbids,  or taking any  action"
"for which they have no statutory authority."
"It is the stance of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that, although"
"it  is  imperative  that the  1 st  Respondent  has  to  conduct an  inquiry  either by"
"itself  or  through  an  inquiring  officer,  without  holding  an 
inquiry  the  1 st"
"Respondent had come to some conclusions."
"The  learned Counsel further  contended, that what 
the  1 st  Respondent"
"had  done  is,  on  its  own,  compared  the  report with the  original  disciplinary"
"inquiry report which had been rejected by the  1 st  Respondent, without giving"
