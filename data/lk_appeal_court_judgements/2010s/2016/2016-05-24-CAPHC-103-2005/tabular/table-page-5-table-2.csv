"cannot  sit  as  an  appeal  board  over  the  report  of its  own  appeal  inquiring"
"officer."
"It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that in the"
"absence  of any  provision  in  the  Regulations,  as  to  how  the  commission"
"should act,  when they reject the report of their own appeal  inquiring officer,"
"it  is  necessary  to  hold  an  inquiry  by  themselves  or  through  a  new  appeal"
"inquiring  officer.  The  Counsel  further  contended  that  the  commission  had"
"exceeded its authority when it sat as an appeal board and reviewed the report"
"of the appeal inquiry officer, it had appointed earlier."
