"So  Lot A went to the 3rd  Defendant as  his  plea  had  been  one for exclusion of Lot A,"
"whilst  it was  Lot  B that was  partitioned  among the  Plaintiff,  1st  Defendant and  2nd"
"Defendant."
"Amongst  the  parties  only the  1st  Defendant  has  preferred  this  appeal  but  I  must"
"observe that grounds of appeal  are tenuous.  It has  to be  noted that issues  Nos.  16"
"to 21 raised  by the 1st  Defendant have been  answered by the learned  District Judge"
"in  his favour and  in the way he  claimed  he  must be  allotted ~ share of the land, he"
"did  secure  half a share  but that half share  came  from  Lot  B.  Lot  A,  as  I stated,  was"
"excluded in  favour of the 3rd  Defendant.  It would appear that the 1st  Defendant has"
"no grounds whatsoever to urge  in  this appeal  against the judgment of the learned"
