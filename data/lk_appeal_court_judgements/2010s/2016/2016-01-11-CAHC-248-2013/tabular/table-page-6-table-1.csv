"is not a sound reason for not imposing a term of imprisonment where his"
"offence  merits  it.  It  is  of vital  importance  that  the  confidence  of the"
"public in the services managed by the State should be preserved. It would"
"be extremely detrimental to the public interest that the betrayal of that"
"trust  should  not  be  met  with  such  punishment  as  will  safeguard  the"
"interests  of the  public  and  the  honour  of the  profession  to  which  the"
"offender belongs."
