"After a lengthy trial in  the  course of which a scholar said to  be an"
"expert in  the exposition of the Agamas or the gospel was called for"
"the prosecution,  the  learned Magistrate  acquitted all the  accused."
"An  appeal  from 
this  acquittal  was  not  competent  except  with"
"sanction  obtained from  the  Attorney-General.  Such  sanction  was"
"sought  unsuccessfully  by  the  petitioner  who  thereupon  presented"
"this  application  in  revision  to  this  Court claiming a  retrial before"
"another  Magistrate. 
It  is  now  settled  that  before  this  Court  can"
"grant  a  prayer  like  that  of the  petitioner  on  this  application  in"
"revision,  the petitioner must make out a case showing something in"
"the  nature  of a positive  miscarriage  of justice  in  the  Magistrate's"
