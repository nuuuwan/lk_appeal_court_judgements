"However when considering the  material  already  discussed  in  this  Judgment  it  is  our considered view"
"that  the  only  irresistible  inference  that  can  be  arrived  by  this  court  is  that  the  murder of Sui  Lincoln"
"was committed by the  1st  accused-appellant and not by any other person."
"However  as  discussed  above  there  is  ample  evidence  against  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  accused  to  establish"
"that  they  knowingly  helped  the  1st  accused  to  disposed  the  body  of Sui  Lincon.  The  2nd  accused"
"appellant had accompanied the  1st  accused-appellant until the  two bags were disposed by them."
"According  to 
the  evidence  of the  van  driver  Lal  Chandrasiri  both  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  accused  had"
"helped  the  1 st  accused-appellant to  load the  two  large  bags in  to  the  van.  The  two  bags were  loaded  to"
"the  van  from  the  restaurant  belonging  to  the  3rd  accused-appellant.  The  above  material  will  clearly"
"establish  the  fact  that  the  2nd  and 
the  3rd  accused-appellants  had  knowing  helped  the  1st  accused"
"appellant to  dispose the body of the deceased. However as  against the  4th  and  the 5thaccused-appellants"
"this  court  is  not  inclined  to  accept  the  argument  raised  by  the  Learned  Additional  Solicitor General."
"Except for  their mere  presence,  the  prosecution  has failed  to  establish  the  connection between the  4th"
