"Heard counsel in support of this application."
"The  petitioner has  come  before  this  Court  seeking  a  writ of certiorari  to"
"quash the conditions laid down by the  1 st respondent when he declared a"
"particular land as a  non-paddy land. 
In this regard this Court is mindful"
"of the fact that the Agrarian Services Act has provided the Commissioner"
"General of Agrarian  Services  not only to  protect the  paddy land  but also"
"to protect the agricultural land.  This is clear from Section 28 &  29 of the"
"Agrarian  Services  Act  and  the  said  conditions  imposed  by  the  Agrarian"
"Commissioner, 
the 
1 st 
respondent  have  been  made 
to 
protect 
the"
"agricultural  land. 
The  position  taken  up  by  the  counsel  was  that  once"
"the land is declared as a  non-paddy land by the  1st  respondent he has no"
"authority  over 
the 
said 
land  and 
therefore  he  cannot 
impose  any"
"conditions but this  Court cannot agree  with  the  said  submissions of the"
"counsel  since  the  1 st  respondent  has  authority  not  only  on  the  paddy"
