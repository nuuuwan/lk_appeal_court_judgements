"","the Defendant has not adduced any evidence to prove that he  has  been in"
"","continuous possession  over 10 years.  Though the Plaintiff had  not looked"
"","after  the land, he had given it on lease to one Babanis and after his death"
"","to  Andiris.  As  such, 
it 
is  not  material 
that  the  Plaintiff  did  not  give"
"","satisfactory evidence as to the number of the trees standing on the land."
"","Considering  the  documents  V3  and  V4  and 
the  evidence  of  the"
"","officer from the Pradeshiya sabawa, the learned add!. District Judge states"
"","that  it cannot  be  certain 
that these  documents  relate  to which  land  and"
"","whether 
the  defendant  was 
in  possession  of  this 
land 
in  1972,  and"
"","therefore  these  documents  do  not  support  possession  of the  defendant"
"","(page 237 of the brief)."
"","V1 
is  a  complaint  made  by  Arnolis  against  the  Defendant 
to  the"
"","Police stating that the defendant had  by force  entered  into the land. This"
"","Arnolis is  a  person to whom the Plaintiff has  leased this land. Arnolis  has"
"","stated  in  his  evidence  that  on  the  complaint  to  the  Police  ,  a  case  was"
"","filed by the Police in the Magistrate's court."
"","Considering 
these evidence,  it it not clear,  whether the defendant"
"","has  possessed  this  land  continuously  without 
any  interruption  over  10"
"","years.  Therefore,  on  this  non-clear  evidence  as  to  possession,  the  court"
"","cannot  decide  that  the  defendant  has  acquired  prescriptive  right  to  the"
"","lots mentioned in the Plaint."
"","the  other  hand,  claims  not  only 
title  but  also 
The  Plaintiff  on"
"","prescriptive 
rights.  When  title  to  the 
land 
is  proved,  right  to  possess"
"","automatically canbe presumed."
