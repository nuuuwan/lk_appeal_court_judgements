"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  of Colombo,  after  having  considered"
"the  submissions  made  by  both  parties,  pronounced  the 
judgment  dated"
"23.06.2010, dismissing the Revision Application of the Appellant."
"The  Appellant  has  preferred 
this  appeal  seeking 
to  set  aside 
the"
"judgment of the learned High Court Judge."
"The  Appellant  was  charged  by  the  Respondent  in  the  Magistrate's"
"Court  of  Maligakanda  under  Section  2( 1)  of  the  Nuisance  Ordinance,"
"complaining  that  the  Appellant  had  permitted  to  lay  a  dilapidated  car  and"
"some refuse of building materials in front of the house."
"At  the  trial  a  witness,  for  the  prosecution  stated,  that  the  dilapidated"
"car and some used building materials had been lying at the place in question"
"for  over  five  years. 
At

that 
the  offence 
is  prescribed  under"
"Section 19 of the Nuisance Ordinance."
"When this case  was taken  up  for  argument,  the  Appellant was  absent"
"and  unrepresented.  Hence,  the  Court  heard  only  the  submissions  made  by"
"the  Counsel  for  the  Respondent.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondent"
"submitted,  that  the  act  of nuisance  complained  by  the  Respondent  was  a"
"continuing offence and therefore  Section  19  of the  Nuisance  Ordinance has"
"no  application. 
It is  the  contention of the  learned  Counsel  that the  offence"
"19  of  the  Nuisance  Ordinance  was 
essentially  a 
created  by  Section"
"continuing one and as  long as  the  said dilapidated car and the  used building"
"materials  are  on  the  said  road,  the  statutory  bar  will  not  run  against  the"
"offence."
"The said Section 19 of the Nuisance Ordinance reads as follows:"
