The  case  was  scheduled 
for  argument  on  18.12.2015."

"The  Appellant  had  made 
the

the 
case  of  Biso  Menika  vs.  C.R.  De  Alwis

"Sharvananda J.  (as he was then) stated, "" a Writ of Certiorari is  issued at the"
"discretion of the Court. 
It cannot be held to  be  a Writ of right or one issued"
"as a matter of course"" ."
"The  exercise  of this  discretion  by  Court  is  governed  by  certain  well"
"accepted principles.  The fundamental  principal is that the rights of a person"
"would have  been affected by any  decision or determination  for the Court to"
"consider.  A Petitioner seeking a prerogative writ is not entitled to relief as a"
"matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine."
