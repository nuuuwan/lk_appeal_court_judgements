"Alwis  vs  Piyasena  Fernando 
{1993}  1 SLR  at 119 - where  His  Lordship  G.P.S.de"
"Silva, C.J  held thus:"
"lilt is  well established that findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who"
"hear and sees the witness are not to be lightly disturbed in appeal"""
"Accordingly,  in  this  case  the  Plaintiff had  established  a  starting  point for"
"his acquisition  of prescriptive right over the disputed land  by which the onus of"
"proof  on  the  Plaintiff  has  prima  facie  been  discharged  and  he  shifted  to  the"
"Defendant 
to establish  her title by prescription.  In that process  the  Defendant"
"gave evidence on her behalf, which would not commensurate with her claim for"
"prescriptive title."
"In the circumstances the Judgment of the  learned  District Judge  is,  in  my"
"view  eminently  just  and 
I  affirm  his  findings  on 
issues  raised  by  the  parties"
"before him. I therefore, in conclusion  affirm the order of the learned trial Judge"
"in its entirety and I dismiss the appeals of the Plaintiff and of the Defendant."
"The parties will bear their own costs."
"JUDGE OF THE  COURT OF APPEAL"
"Wijesundera, J.,"
"I agree."
