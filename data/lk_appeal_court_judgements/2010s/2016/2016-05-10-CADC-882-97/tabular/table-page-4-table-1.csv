"In  Karunadasa  vs  Abdul  Hameed 
60  NlR  352,  it was  held  that  in  a  re"
"vindicatio  action  it is  highly  dangerous to adjudicate  on  a  issue  of prescription"
"without first going in to and  examining the documentary title of the  parties.  In"
"the instant appeal  it is  to be  noted that the Defendant has  no title deed for her"
"claim but her claim based exclusively on prescriptive possession."
"At  the  trial  before  the  learned  district  Judge  the  Plaintiff  and  his  two"
"witnesses testified, whereas the Defendant had  not called  any witnesses on her"
"behalf  except  her.  The  evidence  given  on  behalf  of the  Plaintiff  has  plausibly"
"proved  that the title deed  marked  as  P3  along with  PI and  P2  to the  disputed"
"land and  also the execution of the said  P3  was not challenged  by the Defendant"
"when it was tendered in evidence at the trial."
"In  Wadduwage  Dharmadasa  vs  Manthree Vithanage  Jinasena  2012  (BlR)"
"at page  336  it was  held that in a rei-vindicatio action  if no objection  is  taken  at"
"the close  of a case  where documents are 
read  in evidence they are all evidence"
"for all  purposes  of the  law and  therefore the  Defendant  in  appeal  for the first"
"time  not entitled  to challenge  execution  of the  title  deed  marked  as  P3  at the"
"trial before the learned District Judge."
"The  Plaintiff had  proved 
in  addition to his  paper title,  prescriptive  title to the"
"land in dispute. In an  action for the prescriptive title the burden of proof lies on"
"the  Plaintiff.  In  Sirajudeen  and  two others vs  Abbas  -
1994 2  SlR  at page  365."
"The  Defendant at the appeal  submitted that the evidence given  by William and"
"the  surveyor  is  contradicting  each  other.  This  contention  is  not tenable  in  law,"
"since  the  trial  Judge  is  the Judge  of facts.  This  position  in  law clearly  stated  in"
