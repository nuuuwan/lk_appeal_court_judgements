"","At this stage it is important to consider the authorities cited before this"
"","Court  by  Counsel  of both  sides  with  regard  to  the  main  issue. 
It is  to  be"
"","noted,  a  clear  principle  emerges  from  those  authorities,  that  is,  in  all  the"
"","cases a fresh action had been filed by the prosecution to re-open the case."
"","However, my  considered view is  if the  prosecution wishes to re-open"
"","the previous (same) case by filing a fresh action there is no bar to follow the"
"","said procedure."
"","Accordingly, the prosecution has two options:"
"","(i) 
Re-open the previous case;"
"","(ii) 
File a fresh case."
"","In the matter in hand the prosecution opted to file  a fresh action under"
"","a  different  number,  of course  within  one  year. 
It is  viewed  from  the  case"
"","record, 
the 
subsequent 
action  was 
filed 
before 
another  Magistrate."
"","Therefore,  it  is  not  practically  possible,  for  the  Magistrate  to  know  of an"
"","earlier  action  filed  against  the  same  accused,  was  discharged.  Hence  the"
"","question  of setting aside  the  earlier order of discharge  will  not  arise  where"
"","the present action is concerned."
"","In the  above  setting I am of the  view that the Appellants'  argument is"
"","devoid of merits and should stand dismissed."

"","I agree"
