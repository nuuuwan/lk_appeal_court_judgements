"","dismissed  the  Appellants'  petition  and  affirmed  the 
learned  Magistrate's"
"","Order on 16.02.2005."
"","Thereafter,  the  Appellants  have  invoked  the  appellate jurisdiction  of"
"","this Court to  intervene by  setting aside the  Order of the  learned High Court"
"","Judge dated 16.02.2005."
"","When  considering 
the  merits  of  the  case 
the  central 
issue 
to  be"
"","decided  is  whether  the  learned  Magistrate  is 
lawfully  entitled  to  proceed"
"","with the trial on the 2nd  Plaint filed  by the Respondent without setting aside"
"","the earlier order of discharge."
"","However,  the  Appellants  have  urged  to  interpret  the  word  ""re-open"""
"","in the Section  188(3 ) (a) and (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No."
"","15  of 1989  (as  amended)  since  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  decided"
"","that  the  meaning  of ""re-open""  is  not  the  previous  case  to  be  opened,  but"
"","institute  a  fresh  action  under  a  different  case  number  on  the  same  charges."
"","Section 188 (3) (a) and (b) reads as  follows:"
"","(3) The order of discharge referred to in subsection (2) shall operate as"
"","an acquittal where either:-"
"","(a) 
it 
is  not  set  aside  and 
the  case  against 
the  accused 
is  not"
"","reopened  within  a  period  of one  year  from  the  date  of such"
"","order;"
"","(b) 
the case has been duly re-opened and ....."
"","It is  relevant to  note,  that  there  is  no  provision  of law  set  out  in  the"
"","Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  which  prevents 
the  prosecution  from"
"","opting to file a fresh action."
