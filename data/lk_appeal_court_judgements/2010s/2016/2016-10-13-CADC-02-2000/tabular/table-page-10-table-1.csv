"Accordingly,  in this case the owner of the soil  is the Plaintiff. The  Defendant cannot"
"claim  ownership to the house which  is  standing on  Plaintiff's land.  If at all  her right"
"is only for compensation. The  Defendant has  built the house on a land to which she"
"has not title."
"If that be  so,  the Defendant cannot claim  ownership to the house  by excluding the"
"land on which it stands."
