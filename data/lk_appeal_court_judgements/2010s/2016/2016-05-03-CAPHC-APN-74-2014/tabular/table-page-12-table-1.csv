"It is  clearly shown that the learned  Trial  Judge has  looked at one  side  of"
"the  picture;  the  side  of the  1st  Respondent.  He  has  failed  to  consider  the"
"gravity  of the  offence  and  the  manner and the  circumstances  in  which  it  was"

"I  am  of the  view  that  the  I st  Respondent  had  been  the  perpetrator  of a"
"very  serious  crime  which  had  been  committed  with  much  deliberation  and"

Had  the  learned  Trial  Judge  considered  the  relevant  factors  or"

"Having regard to  the  serious nature and the  manner in which the  offence"
"has  been committed by the  1 st  Respondent,  I am  of the view that the  sentence"

I  cannot  escape

"conclusion 
that  the  1 st  Respondent  has  been 
too 
leniently 
treated  by 
the"

Such  lenient  treatment  of an  offender  for  such  serious"
"crime 
is  bound 
to  defeat 
the  main  object  of  punishment,  which 
is 
the"
"prevention of crimes."
