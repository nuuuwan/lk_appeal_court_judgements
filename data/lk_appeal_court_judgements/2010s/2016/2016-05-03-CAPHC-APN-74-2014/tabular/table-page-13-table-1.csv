"In this case the  learned Trial Judge has  sentenced the  1st  Respondent to a"
"rigorous  imprisonment and suspended the  same 
term of two years (02  years)"
"for  fifteen  years  (15) years)  and has  imposed a fine  of Rupees  One thousand"
"five  hundred (Rs.15001-) with a default sentence of six months imprisonment."
"It is  to  be  noted,  even  though  the  Court  has  a  discretion  to  impose  a"
"suspended  sentence, 
it  should  be  taken  giving  due  regard 
to 
the  specific"
"provision  listed  under  Section  303  of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act.  Specific"

"On  the  material  before  this  Court,  I  am  satisfied  that  there  has  been  a"
"wrongful  exercise of discretion in that,  no weight, or no  sufficient weight has"
"been given to the relevant considerations enumerated above.  Accordingly, the"
"Order made by the learned Trial Judge in respect of the  1 st  Respondent, should"
"be set aside."
"It  is  seen,  several  aggravating  circumstances  are  present  in  this  case. 
I"
"cannot  escape 
from 
the  conclusion 
that  the  1 st  Respondent  has  been 
too"
"leniently treated by the learned Trial Judge without any justifiable reason.  The"
"offence is  far  too  grave to be dealt with a suspended  imprisonment.  There  is"
