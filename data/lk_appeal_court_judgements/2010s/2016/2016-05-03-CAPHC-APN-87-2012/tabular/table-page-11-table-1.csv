"On  the  whole  I  am  of the  view  that  public  interest  demand  that  a"
"custodial sentence be imposed in  this  case and this is  a fit  case to  impose it,"

"period  of seven  years  (07  years)  and  sentence  the  Respondent to  a term  of"
"fifteen  years (15  years) Rigorous  Imprisonment.  The compensation and the"
