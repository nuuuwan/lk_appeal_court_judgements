"impose the following sentence:"
"A sentence of two years (02 years) imprisonment and a fine  of Rupees"
"Two  thousand  five  hundred (Rs.2S001-)  with  a  default  sentence of one  year"
"(01  year) imprisonment and suspended the said term of two years (02  years)"

"In the  instant case, the  learned Trial 
Judge  has  imposed  a  suspended"

"(i) and also the reasons  should have  been stated 
under Section 303  (1)  (a) -"
"in writing. 
In this case the learned Trial Judge has not addressed his mind to"
"these  issues. 
Also  he  has  not  stated  the  reasons  to  impose  a  suspended"
"sentence.

"lenient view of the matter, he should have stated the reasons on which such a"
"view was taken."

"fact that the Respondent is  the  father of the victim clearly illustrates that the"
"imposition of a suspended term of imprisonment is not justified."

"Courts should not give the impression that when they commit these offences"
"they  can  get  away  with  it  by  getting  a  suspended  sentence  and  going  scot"
