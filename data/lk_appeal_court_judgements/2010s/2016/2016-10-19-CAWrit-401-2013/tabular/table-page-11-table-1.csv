"and  Investment Policy circular No.  01/ 2013  dated  2013-08-02."
"The  fact  that  the  2nd  and  3rd  Respondents  had  recommended 
to  the  1st"
"Respondent  that  the  Petitioners  be  issued  with  motor  vehicle  permits  and"
"the  subsequent  issuance  of those  permits  in  the  name  of the  Petitioners"

"authority."
"Although  the  Petitioners  have  complained  to  this  court  that they  were  not"
