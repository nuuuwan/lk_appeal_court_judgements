"In 
this  regard,  I  wish 
to 
first  consider  the  position  taken  up  by  the  Petitioner  before 
this  court."
"According 
to 
the  Petitioner, 
the  3rd  Respondent  held  one  of 
the 
senior  most  managerial  and"
"supervisory  position  in  Petitioner  Company  and  there  was  no  other  person  within  the  country  that"
"oversaw 
the  3rd  Respondent's  discharge  of  his  duties  which 
included 
the 
remitting  of  the  EPF"
"contribution of the employees of the company including the EPF contributions of the 3rd  Respondent."
"It is  the  position of the  Petitioner that the  3rd  Respondent being the  person who oversaw the  remitting"
"of EPF  contributions  of the  employees  had  abused  his  managerial  authority  and  taking  advantage  of"
"the fact  that  there was  no  one in  Sri Lanka to  oversee his function,  directed  that no deduction shall be"
"made from his salary as the employee contribution of EPF and has in fact  collected that amount as part"
"of his monthly salary."
"In  support  of  the 
above  contention  Petitioner  has  produced  marked  P-15  pay  slips  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent 
for 
the  months  of  November  and  December  2004,  February, 
June 
,July  August,"
"September,  October,  November  and  December  2005  which  indicates  that  the  3rd  Respondent  had"
"collected his salary without the 8% employee contribution of the EPF payment."
"It is further observed by this court that the  3rd  Respondent has not been registered with the  Employees"
"Provident Fund, to  obtain an EPF number to make the contribution."
