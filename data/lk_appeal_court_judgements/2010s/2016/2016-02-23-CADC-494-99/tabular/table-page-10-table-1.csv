"In Ruberu and another V.  Wijesooriya (1998) 1 SrLL.R 58 it was held that:"
"flWhether it is a licensee or lessee, the question of title is foreign to a suit"
"in ejectment against either. The licensee obtaining possession is deemed"
"to obtain  it upon terms that he  will  not dispute the title of the  plaintiff"
"without whose permission he would not have got it. The effect of Section"
"116 of the Evidence  Ordinance  is  that if a licensee  desires to challenge"
"the title under which  he  is  in  occupation he  must first quit the land. The"
"fact that the licensee obtained  possession  from the plaintiff is  perforce"
