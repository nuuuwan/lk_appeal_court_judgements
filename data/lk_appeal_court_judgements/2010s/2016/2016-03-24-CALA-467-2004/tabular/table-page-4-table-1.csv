"The  counsel  for the  Plaintiffs,  in  his  written  submission  filed  before  this"
"court  has  misconceived  the  land  relating  to  issue  of injunction.  It is  a  primary"
"injunction  can  be 
issued  to  oust  a  person  who  is 
in 
principle  of  law  that  an"
"possession  of the  land.  Even  a  person  who is  in  unlawful  possession  cannot  be"
"ousted  by  injunction.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  injunction  should  not  be"
"used  as  a  means  to  place  in  possession  of the  Plaintiff by  ousting  a  person  in"
"possession  of  a 
land  or  property.  Even 
if  the  Defendant 
is  prevented  from"
"entering  a  land  in  dispute  by  an 
interim  injunction,  the  Plaintiff  cannot  take"
"possession  of that land  and  do any act therein, until the final  determination of"
"the action."
