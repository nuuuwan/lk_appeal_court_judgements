"30.11.2004 the learned District Judge made order dissolving the enjoining order"
"and rejecting the application for the issue of interim injunction. In this order it is"
"stated  by the  learned  Judge  that  lithe  Defendants  have  been  in  possession  of"
"the 
land, 
the  subject  matter  of  the  action 
for  a 
long  period  of  time,  and"
"therefore  an 
interim  injunction  cannot  be  issued 
restraining  the  Defendants"
"from entering the said  land. 
Further, the Defendants have been cultivating the"
"said 
land  and 
issuing  an 
interim 
injunction  would  cause 
the  Defendants"
"substantial loss."""
"The  Plaintiff have  sought  leave to appeal  to this  court from  the order of"
"the 
learned  District  Judge  made  on  30.11.2004. 
As 
this  application  purely"
"relates to the  issue  of an  interim  injunction,  it is  not necessary 
to go  into the"
"title of the parties but only to see  who was  in  possession  of the  land, whether"
"the  Plaintiff  or  the  Defendant. 
In 
the  order  dated  30.11.2004, 
the 
learned"
"District  Judge  has  come  to  the  decision 
that  the  Defendants  have  been 
in"
"possession  of the  land  for a  long  period  of time  and  the  Plaintiff has  failed  to"
"establish that he is in possession of the said  land."
"The  Plaintiffs'  position  is  that when  he  tried to prepare  the  land  for the"
"purpose  of  sugar  cane  cultivation  on  1.10.2004  the  Defendants  came  and"
"disturbed  his  work.  But  he  has  not established  his  possession  of the  land. The"
"Grama Sevaka  has given a letter marked ""V12"" which state that the Defendants"
"were  cultivating  the  land.  As  such,  the  learned  District  Judge  has  come  to  a"
"correct decision that the Defendants were in possession of the 
land and not the"
"Plaintiff,  and  therefore 
issuing  an  interim  injunction  against  the  Defendants"
"who are in possession of the land will cause substantial loss to them."
