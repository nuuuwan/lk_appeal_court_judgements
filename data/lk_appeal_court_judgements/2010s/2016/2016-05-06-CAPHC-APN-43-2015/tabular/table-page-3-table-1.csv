"determine  his  guilt  or  innocence  which  is  in  issue  only  in  trials  under"
"chapter XIX"
"The  Magistrate  can  commit  the  accused  for  trial  if he  is  satisfied  that"
"there  is  a prima facie  case against him,  even without calling all the witnesses to"
"testify  before  Court.  As  I  pointed  out  earlier,  the  Magistrate  is  not  going  to"
"decide  the  guilt or  innocence  of the  accused,  it  is  the  High  Court that  is  doing"
"so.  Therefore,  even  if the  witness  was  not produced  before the  Magistrate,  the"
"trial  judge  (the  High  Court  Judge)  must  have  the  benefit  of hearing  all  the"
"evidence."
