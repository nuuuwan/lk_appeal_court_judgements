"in  Kandy  Omnibus  Co.  Ltd.  vs.  T. W.  Roberts,S  a 
jurisdiction.  As  Sansoni  J  stated"
"latent or contingent want of jurisdiction arises only when a state of facts has to exist"
"before assumption  of jurisdiction  but yet the statutory body or court assumed  that"
"jurisdiction despite the non existence of such  a state of facts. The jurisdiction of the"
"statutory  body 
is  contingent  upon 
the  existence  of  such 
facts.  No  doubt  the"
"jurisdiction  to  make  the  appointments  in  terms  of  Section  14(1)(b)  of the  Act  is"
"contingent  upon 
the  existence  of  the  names  of  the 
intended 
trustees  upon  a"
"register.  As  the Counsel  for the Appellant argued  before this Court,  if the names  of"
"those 
five 
trustees  appointed  were  absent  from 
this  register  before  the  Board"
"assumed  the jurisdiction to appoint them, certainly it is  a jurisdictional defect but in"
"my  view 
it  is  not  a  patent  want  of  jurisdiction.  Nothing  is  patent  to  this  court"
"because  it is  not clear that it was this register that the Board  used. The  presence or"
"absence  of a member of a mosque on  its register is  a question of fact that has to be"
"investigated. 
If  as 
the  Appellant  alleges  non  members  of  the  mosque  had  been"
"appointed  as  trustees  no  appointment  would  have  been  valid.  But  it  should  have"
"been  brought to the  notice  of the  primary fact finder or the Wakfs Tribunal  at the"
"appellate stage."
"In  fact  the  statute -
the  Muslim  Mosques  and  Charitable  Trusts  or Wakfs  Act  has"
"enacted  a salutary provision  namely Section  14(1)(lA) to cure  this  kind  of latent or"
"contingent want of jurisdiction. In terms of this provision if the board  has committed"
"an  error on  the question  whether a particular member is  really  a person  belonging"
"to the congregation  of a particular mosque, this question  has  to be  agitated  before"
"the Wakfs  Board  in  the first instance. The  legislature has  granted  an  opportunity to"
"an  aggrieved  person to go  before the Wakfs Board which made the allegedly invalid"
