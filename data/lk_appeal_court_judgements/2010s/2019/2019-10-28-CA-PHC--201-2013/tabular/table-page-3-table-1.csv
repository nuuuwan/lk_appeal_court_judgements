"the Primary Court Procedure Act)"
"In the instant case, the appellant admits that this is a bare land,"
"and  none  of  the  parties  are 
living  on  the  land  or  in  actual"
"physical occupation of the land.1"
"If  that  is  the  position,  the  order  of  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court  in"
"favour of the respondent on the basis that the respondent was in"
"possession of the land on the date of filing the case, and forcible"
"eviction within two months prior to the filing of the case was not"
"established by the appellant, is correct."
"The main item of evidence relied upon by the appellant contains"
"in  the  police  observation  notes 
(P2)  whereby  removal  of  old"
"concrete  posts  and  replacement  of  them  with  new  ones  by  the"
"respondent  had  been  observed.    However  there  is  no  evidence"
"that  the  old  concrete  posts  were  fixed  by  the  appellant.    The"
"respondent had lived on the land with his family.  The wife and"
"the  daughter  have  died  due  to  a  landslide,  and  thereafter  the"
"respondent has gone abroad.   According to the  statement given"
"by  the  respondent  (P3),  upon  his  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  he  has"
"gone to the land and cleared it.  It has been so cleared as it was"
"not  in  the  physical  possession  of  anybody.    Then  the  appellant"
"has  told  him  that  he  bought  the  land  from  the  father  of  his"
"deceased wife.  It is in that background, this dispute has arisen."
"In  the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  conclusion"
"arrived at by the learned Magistrate and affirmed by the learned"
"High Court Judge is, in my view, correct."
"1  Vide  paragraph  C(i)  at  page  7  of  the  written  submission  of  the  appellant"
