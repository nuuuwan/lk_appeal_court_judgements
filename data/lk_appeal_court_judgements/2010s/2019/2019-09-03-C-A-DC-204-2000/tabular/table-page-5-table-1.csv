"T
he 
learned  District  Judge  has 
relied  on  Seenithamby 
v."
"Ahamadulebbe6  to  say  that  the  cancellation  of  the  Plaintiffâ€™s"
"Permit shall be clearly proved to defeat the claim of the Plaintiff."
"Unlike in that case, this has been proved in the instant case by"
"evidence to the satisfaction of the Court."
"That decision of the Divisional Secretary in my view is correct as"
"the Plaintiff had virtually sold the land to a third party in 1974"
"and  quit  possession  of  the  land  thereafter  voluntarily.    It  is  a"
"blatant  violation  of  one  of  the  many  conditions  of  the  Permit,"
"which enables the State to cancel the Permit after an inquiry."
"This  decision  has  been 
taken  by 
the  Divisional  Secretary,"
"according 
to 
the  evidence  of 
the  Plaintiff  herself,  after  an"
"inquiry.7    This  has  been  reiterated  by  the  Defendant  in  her"
"evidence as well.8"
"The  learned  District  Judge  has  placed  great  reliance  on  the"
"Receipt  marked  P3  to  say  that  the  fine  imposed  on  the  Plaintiff"
"for  violation  of  a  condition  of  the  Permit,  namely,  failure  to"
"occupy and possess the land, has been paid."
"On  the  one  hand,  there  is  no  evidence  that  this  Receipt  was"
"produced  by  the  Plaintiff  at  the  inquiry.    On  the  other  hand,"
"payment  of  the  fine  does  not  give  authority  to  the  Plaintiff  to"
"continue to violate the conditions of the Permit.  It is stated so in"
"P2  letter  itself.9    Admittedly,  the  Plaintiff  has  never  gone  into"
"possession of the land after 1974."
