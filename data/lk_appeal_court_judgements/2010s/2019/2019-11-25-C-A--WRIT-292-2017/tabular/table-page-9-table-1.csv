"been  developed and -takes  up  the  position  that  the  quit  notice  was  issued  as"
"the Petitioner had failed to cultivate and/or develop the said  land."
"This  Court  observes 
that  even 
though 
the  Petitioner  claims 
that  he 
is 
in"
"exclusive  possession  of  the  sa id 
land, 
the  Petitioner  has  not  divulged 
the"
"circumstances  under which  he  came  into  possession  of the  said  land  nor  has"
"the  Petitioner  produced  any  title  deeds  to  prove  his  ownership  to  the  land,"
"except  to  claim  that  he  has  acquired  prescriptive  title  to the  said  land  by  his"
"long  occupation  thereof. This  Court  must state  that the  determination  of the"
"aforementioned issue  before this Court does not require this Court to consider"
"the title of the Petitioner and that, in  any event, in  an  application of this nature"
"it is  not the function of this Court to examine the title of the Petitioner."
"It was  the submission of the learned  President's Counsel for the Petitioner that"
"the  land  occupied  by  the  Petitioner  is  private  land  and  that  even  though  the"
"land  was  identified  for  acquisition  by  the  State  in  1962,  steps  have  not 
said"
"been  taken  to  acquire  the  said  land  in  terms  of the  Land  Acquisition  Act  and"
"therefore the said  land  remains  private land. In  support of his  position that the"
"land 
is 
private 
land, 
the 
learned 
President's  Counsel 
relied 
on 
the"
"aforementioned  Tenement  list  relating  to  Supplement  Plan  No.2  of  FVP  No."
"445  marked  'Bl', which contains  an  endorsement under the ' Remarks'  column"
"that 
the  said 
land 
is 
""Claimed  by  Dr.  W.L.G .Dasanayake"" 
and 
is 
""to  be"
"acquired.""  On 
this  basis, 
the  learned  President's  Counsel 
for  the  Petitioner"
"submitted  that the  land  that  he  is  occupying  is  not State  land  and  therefore,"
"the  issuance  of the  quit  notice  'G'  is  ultra  vires  the  powers  conferred  on  the"
"Respondent,  is  illegal as well as  unreasonable and  irrational. This is the basis on"
