"2nd  respondent  being  the  Chief  Administrative  Officer  of  the  1st"
"respondent  Pradeshiya  Sabha  has  sent  with  great  enthusiasm"
"all the required documents to the 4th respondent to see that the"
"petitioner is paid the pension.  It is very unfair on the part of the"
"petitioner to make allegations even obliquely against the 1st and"
"2nd respondents as they have been all out to help the petitioner"
"to  secure  the  pension,  and  even  explanations  have  been  called"
"from 
the  2nd  respondent  by 
the  3rd  respondent

"one or more or all of the respondents to take necessary steps to"

"with 
seriousness. 
  He  must  understand 
that  writ

"discretionary 
remedy,  and 
the  conduct  of 
the  petitioner 
is"
"intensely relevant in deciding the matter."
"The petitioner’s services for book binding have been taken by the"
