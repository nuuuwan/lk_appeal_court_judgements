"The Petitioners are seeking an enhancement of their retiral benefits by way of writ of mandamus"
"which is  not possible."
"PS,  P6 and P7 Not Applicable to the Petitioners"
"In  any event PS,  P6  and  P7  are not applicable to the Petitioners."
"By the time P5 was issued the Petitioners had already been promoted to Class I of the SLTS taking"
"into consideration  their  period  of service  after  having  being  placed  on  the  highest salary  step"
"after absorption into Class 2 Grade I of the SLTS."
"The  fact that P5  is  inapplicable to the Petitioners is  clearly demonstrated  by the fact they were"
"placed  in  the second  salary step  of Class  I with effect from  06.10.1994 and  became  eligible for"
"salary increments due to Class  I teachers from 1994 and  were in fact paid increments since 1999"
"whereas in terms of P5 those promoted were not eligible for back wages and were entitled to be"
"paid their salary together with the increments earned for service in  Class  I only with effect from"
"01.01.2005."
"The  Petitioners in their counter affidavit have sought to rely on  a new document CA-8 to obtain"
"relief.  This  is  not the basis  of the case  pleaded for a writ of mandamus which  the Respondents"
"were called  upon to answer and the Petitioners are not entitled to rely on it now [Culasubhadra"
"v.  The  University of Colombo and Others (1985)  1 SrLloR.  244]."
"For all  the foregoing reasons the application is  dismissed  but without costs  in the circumstances"
"of the case."
