"in the judgment of The King v  Chandrasekere 44  N.L.R.  97 as his Lordship"
"""This 
case 
lays 
down 
that 
if 
the 
existence 
of"
"circumstances  which  would  bring 
""the  case  within"
"one  of  the  exceptions"" 
is 
involved 
in  doubt, 
the"
"existence of those  circumstances cannot be  said  to  have"
"been  proved. 
It does  not  lay  down  that if two  possible"
"views  may  be  taken  of a set  of proved  circumstances,"
"the Jury  is precluded from  adopting either or those  two"
"views. 
In  fact,  as  it appears  to  me, 
just as  inevitably"
"as  one  cannot have one  side of a sheet of paper without"
"the  other,  there  cannot be  one  view of a matter and  not"
"the  contrary view  as  well. 
If, for  instance,  an  accused"
"rests his defence upon  exception  1 of section 294 of the"
"Penal  Code, 
the 
Jury  may  decide  that  he  has  proved,"
"within 
the  meaning  of  proof  in 
section  3  of  the"
"Evidence  Ordinance,  the  circumstances alleged by him"
"and  yet  may  hold  or  not  hold  that,  he  lost  his  self"
"control 
in  consequence of the  provocation  to  which  he"
"was  subjected. 
Similarly,  when  circumstances  are  in"
"evidence which  the Jury  regard as  having been  proved,"
"they  mayor  may  not  hold  that 
those 
circumstances"
"established 
that 
there  was  a  sudden 
fight,  upon  a"
"sudden  quarrel,  and 
that 
the  accused  ""did  not 
take"
"undue advantage,  &  c."" 
It is  only if they  are  in doubt"
"as 
to  whether 
they  should  or  should  not  hold 
that"
