"existence  of such  circumstances  cannot be  said  to  have"

"This  pronouncement of  the Court of Criminal  Appeal concerns  two"
"situations.  Firstly, 
it  deals  with 
the 
situation  where 
the 
""evidence"""
"presented by an accused  to  bring his case within one of the exceptions ""is"
"involved  in  doubt"",  then"" the  existence  of those  circumstances  cannot  be  said  to"
"have been  proved""."
"Secondly, it deals with a situation where the evidence of the accused"
"to  bring his case within one of the exceptions is ""proved"" as per Section 3"
"of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  but  fails 
to  satisfy  that  those  circumstances"
"could  bring  his  case  within  any  of  the  exceptions  of  Section  294  of  the"
"Penal Code."
"Essentially, their Lordships have approached the issue on two levels."
"In  order  to  successfully  bring  his  case  within  one  of  the  exceptions  an"
"accused must establish the circumstances that he relied on have existed in"
"the 
first 
place. 
Thereafter, 
he  must 
also 
establish  whether 
those"
"circumstances  that he  relied  on are sufficient to  bring his  case  within  the"
"exception that had been relied upon."
