"the  1st 
Secondly,  witness  Sri mali  Priyanka  was  also  suggested  by"
"appellant that she, being a neighbour, should have heard the commotion at"
"his  house over  the attack  by  the  deceased  and  her husband  susantha. She"
"denied  the  suggestion on  the  footing  that it was  normal  in  that  house  to"
"have such commotions  on a daily basis."
"Thus,  in  view  of  the  denials  consistently  maintained  by  these  two"
"witnesses,  the position advanced by the 1st appellant that the deceased and"
"two  others have attacked  him that night remains only  as  suggestions  and"
"not as ""evidence""  in  the  case.  In  this  context,  the  evidence of  his  witness"
"becomes  more important for  she is  the  only person who gave evidence of"
"such  an  attack. 
Since  the  appellants  maintained  a  total  denial  in  their"
"evidence.  During cross-examination of CI  Abeysekera,  the 1st  appellant had"
"elicited  that the  complaint lodged by  his  mother was  investigated by  him"
"when  he  visited  his  house  that  night.  The  officer  had  observed  that  the"
"glass sheet of the"" cabinet"" was broken. It is strange, as  pointed out by the"
"learned  DSG,  that  the 1st  appellant further  elicited  that  the  investigations"
"conducted by the witness revealed that it was the 1st  appellant himself who"
"damaged  the  ""cabinet"".  This  position was  repeated  by  the  witness  when"
"the  1st  appellant clarified  the  issue  at a  later  point and  thereby  negating"
"any mistake of fact on the part of the police officer in giving that evidence."
"This item of evidence, that had been presented before the trial Court"
"by  an independent person,  was  not contradicted  by the 1st  appellant and"
"was left unchallenged. It is clear that the 1st  appellant had heavily relied on"
"this  alleged  act  of  mischief  by 
the  deceased  in  support  of  his  claim  of"
"sudden fight.  However,  the 1st appellant had left this  issue in conflict with"
"his mother's evidence. The prosecution highlighted an important omission"
