"J
ustice G.P.S. de Silva in Balapitiya Gunananda Thero v. Talalle"
"Methananda  Thero  [1997]  2  Sri  LR  101.    If  P1  is  to  be  accepted"
"without  qualification,  the  nomination  stated  in  P1  has  to  be"
"admitted  without 
any 
further 
proof. 
 
Accordingly,  main"
"submission of the defendant-appellant fails."
"The  next  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  defendant-"
"appellant  is  that  the  2nd  plaintiff  does  not  become  entitled  to"
"succession  in  terms  of  rule  1  of  the  third  schedule  read  with"
"section  72  of 
the  Ordinance. 
  Succession  under 
the 
third"
"schedule  becomes  relevant  if  no  successor  has  been  nominated"
"or 
if 
the  nominated  successor 
fails 
to  succeed. 
  Here 
the"
"consideration  of  the  third  schedule  does  not  arise  as  successor"
"has  been  nominated  from  the  group  of  relatives  enumerated  in"
"the third schedule as stated in section 51 of the Ordinance."
"Connected  to  this  argument,  the  learned  counsel  also  takes  up"
"the  position  that  the  2nd  plaintiff  as  the  nominated  successor"
"failed  to  succeed.    This  argument  in  my  view  can  be  advanced"
"provided  the  defendant-appellant  accepts  the  2nd  plaintiff  was"
"the nominated successor.  She cannot approbate and reprobate."
"But the defendant-appellant did not accept it and did not allow"
"the  two  plaintiffs,  father  and  son  respectively,  to  continue  with"
"possession  or 
take  possession  of 
the 
land. 
 
In 
the 
said"
"circumstances,  it  does  not  lie  in  the  mouth  of  the  defendant-"
"appellant  now  to  say  that  the  2nd  defendant-appellant  failed  to"
"succeed.  I reject the second argument."
"The third argument of the learned counsel is that the main relief"
"prayed for in the prayer to the plaint, which is paragraph (a) of"
"the prayer to the plaint, whereby the 2nd plaintiff seeks a “හිමිකම්‍්‍"
"ප්‍රකාශයක්” (title declaration) to the land in suit is misconceived in"
