"The  pivotal  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  defendant-"
"appellant before this Court is that there is no proper nomination"
"in  terms  of  section 56  of  the  Land Development  Ordinance and"
"therefore  the  said  nomination  is  invalid.    According  to  section"
"56,  the  nomination  of  a  successor  shall  be  in  the  prescribed"
"form  executed 
in  triplicate  before  a  Government  Agent  or  a"
"Registrar  of  Lands  or  a  Divisional  Assistant  Government  Agent"

"in issue in the trial Court, in my view, it is too late in the day to"
"raise that matter for the first time in appeal."
"In any event, at the closure of the case for the plaintiffs, reading"
