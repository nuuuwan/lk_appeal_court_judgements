"Unlike  Article  126(2)  of 
the  Constitution  where 
the  word"
"“person” has been given a unique place,  in Article 140, there is"
"no  personalization  of  the  application,  or  rather  the  applicant."
"The  word  “person”  has  no  place 
in  Article  140. 
  The  word"
"“person” used there at the end is referable not to the applicant,"
"but to the person against whom writ is sought."
"In  Sri  Lanka,  fundamental  right  jurisdiction  exists  apart  from"
"and independent of writ jurisdiction where the latter is exercised"
"independently  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  subject  to  appeal  to  the"
"Supreme  Court,  and  the 
former  exclusively  by  the  Supreme"
"Court.  Fundamental  right  jurisdiction  is  invoked  in  relation  to"
"violation 
of 
fundamental 
rights 
expressly 
stated 
in 
the"
"Constitution  whereas  the  writ  jurisdiction  is,  broadly  speaking,"
"invoked  to  control  the  power  of  the  bodies,  which  discharge"
"duties  of  public  nature.  The  acts  complained  of 
in  a  writ"
"application  do  not  necessarily  give  rise  to  complain  of  violation"
"of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution."
