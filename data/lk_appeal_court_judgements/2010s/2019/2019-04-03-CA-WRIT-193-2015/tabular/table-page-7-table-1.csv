"and  directed  the  Vice  Chairman  to  submit further  proposal"
"with regard to other professional services as well."
"The  “Committee  Report”  above  referred  to  is  the  Report  of  the"
"“Committee  on  Salary  Revision  of  CEB  Employees-2015”  marked"
"1R10, and “Addendum” is 1R11."
"It  is  noteworthy  that  in  the  said  Committee  Report  1R10,  the"
"proposed  “E  Salary  Scale”  by  the  Engineers’  Union  has  neither"
"been recommended nor approved but only accepted as a policy."
"In  Annexure  6  thereof,  it  is  particularly  mentioned  that,  the"
"proposed  “E  Salary  Scale”  for  the  Engineers  is  a  matter  to  be"
"considered  separately,  and  it  is  beyond  their  mandate  to  make"
"recommendations on the “E Salary Scale”."
"In the first place, I must say that, soon after the Board decided"
"to  accept  the  proposed  Collective  Agreement 
for  01.01.2015-"
"31.12.2017 (P6), which included the 30% salary increase across"
"the  board  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Secretary/Ministry  of"
"Power and Energy, Secretary/Ministry of Finance and Planning,"
"and  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  the  Board  cannot,  immediately"
"thereafter,  and  out  of  the  blue,  hurriedly 
formulate  another"
"salary revision for the Engineers.  That is plainly ultra vires."
"According 
the 
said  Minutes  under 
the  heading 
“UNIFIED"
"SERVICES IN THE CEB”, the following very unusual things have"
"happened 
in 
the  Board  Room  while 
the  Board  Meeting 
in"
"progress."
