"It is noteworthy that the decision in R v. Panel on Takeovers"
"and Mergers ex parte Datain [1987] 1 QB 815 extended the"
"application of prerogative remedies to the London Takeover"
"Panel, which is a non-statutory body regulating the conduct"
"of takeovers and mergers in the London Stock Exchange on"
"a voluntary basis through a process of self regulation. In R"
"v. International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and"
"the  Republic  of  Ireland  Limited  [1993]  1  All  ER  422,  the"
"English Courts have held that  the London Stock Exchange,"
"which  has  been  constituted  as  a  limited  liability  company,"
"is  subject 
to 
judicial 
review. 
In  decisions  such  as 
the"
"Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland, Petitioners"
"[1989]  BCLC  700,  R  v.  FIMBRA,  ex  parte  Cochrane  [1991]"
"BCLC  106,  SIB  Anor  v.  FIMBRA  &  Anor  [1992]  Chancery"
"268  and  R  v.  LAUTRO,  ex  parte  Ross  [1992]  1  All  ER  422"
"the  Courts  have  held  that  although  judicial  review  is  not"
"available  in  the  context  of  purely  contractual  powers,  the"
"authority 
of  a 
contractual  nature  which 
various 
self-"
"regulating  organizations  have  over 
their  members  help"
"these  organizations  to  perform  their  public  functions,  and"
"accordingly the failure of such an organization to perform a"
"contractual  obligation  may  be  subjected  to  judicial  review."
"The 
rationale 
for  making 
such 
non-statutory 
bodies"
"amenable  to  prerogative  remedies  appears  to  be  that  they"
"are discharging functions of a public nature."
