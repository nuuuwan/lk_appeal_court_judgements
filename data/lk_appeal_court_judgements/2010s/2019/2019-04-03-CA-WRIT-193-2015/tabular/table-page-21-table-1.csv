"administrative 
law”  which  he  regarded  as 
the  greatest"
"achievement of the English Courts during his life time."
"The  rationale  for  the  expanding  canvas  of  locus  standi  in"
"the  context  of  certiorari  and  prohibition  was  explained  by"
"H.W.R. Wade-Administrative Law (8th Edition) pages 362 to"
"363 in the following words-"
"“The  prerogative  remedies,  being  of  a  ‘public’  character  as"
"emphasized  earlier,  have  always  had  more  liberal  rules"
"about 
standing 
than 
the 
remedies 
of 
private 
law."
"Prerogative  remedies  are  granted  at  the  suit  of  the  Crown,"
"as the titles of the cases show; and the Crown always has"
"standing to take action against public authorities, including"
"its own ministers, who act or threaten to act unlawfully. As"
"Devlin  J  said:  Orders  of  certiorari  and  prohibition  are"
"concerned principally with public order, it being the duty of"
"the High Court to see that inferior courts confine themselves"
"to their own limited sphere”. In the same sense Brett J. had"
"said 
in  an  earlier  case 
that 
the  question 
in  granting"
"prohibition “is not  whether the individual suitor has or has"
"not  suffered  damage,  but  is,  whether  the  royal  prerogative"
"has  been  encroached  upon  by  reason  of  the  prescribed"
"order  of  administration  of  justice  having  been  disobeyed”."
"Consequently the court is prepared to act at the instance of"
"a mere stranger, though it retains discretion to refuse to do"
"so if it considers that no good would be done to the public.”"
"Wade  further  goes  on  to  observe  at  page  683  that-“…the"
"House  of  Lords 
is  clearly  now  determined 
to  prevent"
