"The question that arises in this case is whether the plaintiff-"
"Union has, as a quasi-Corporation, a cause of action which"
"would entitle it to the declaratory judgment prayed for."
"Thereafter the following answer was given:"
"The  plaintiff 
is  an  Association  having  as 
its  members,"
"among  others,  77  percent  of  the  non-executive  staff  of  the"
"defendant-Corporation,  each  one  of  whom  entered 
into"
"individual  contracts  with  the  defendant-Corporation  on  the"
"basis  of  the  specimen  agreement  referred  to  as  X  and  Y."
"But  the  plaintiff-Union  has  as  such  not  entered  into  any"
"such contract. The dispute complained of in the plaint is the"
"dispute of each member with the Corporation. The plaintiff-"
"Union  has  no  direct 
interest 
in  the  said  dispute.  In  the"
"circumstances, 
it  has  no 
locus  standi  at  all  and 
is  not"
"entitled 
to  come 
to  Court 
for  any 
relief  based  on 
the"
"contracts of its members."
"Then at page 315 it was held that:"
"Thus,  though  the  legislature  is  aware  of  the  status  and"
"function  of  a  Trade  Union,  it  has  to  date  failed  to  make"
"statutory provision for a registered Trade Union to represent"
"its members in civil proceedings in a Court of Law."
"It is then abundantly clear that the Supreme Court decided that"
"the  plaintiff  Trade  Union  had  no  locus  standi  to  institute  that"
"action in the District Court because the plaintiff did not have a"
"cause of action against the defendant.  The instant action, which"
"is a writ application, is clearly distinguishable."
