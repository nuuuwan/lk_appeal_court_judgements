"D
irectors of the CEB are appointed, in terms of section 3 of the"
"Ceylon  Electricity  Board  Act,  by  the  Ministers  of  Power  and"
"Energy, and Finance.  It is a waste of time to quote the sections"
"of 
the  Act  extensively 
to  convince 
that 
the  CEB 
is  not  an"
"independent 
and 
autonomous 
entity  where 
the  Board 
of"
"Directors  has  been  given  a 
free  hand  to  take  any  decision"
"including  salary  enhancement  according 
to 
the  whims  and"
"fancies  of  the  directors.    Let  me  touch  upon  a  few  sections  in"
"passing.  Section 9 of the Act says that all officers and servants"
"of  the  Board  shall  be  deemed  to  be  public  servants  within  the"
"meaning the Penal Code.  Section 40 says that after the coming"
"into  operation  of  the  Act,  there  may  be  granted  to  the  Board,"
"with the prior approval of the House of Representatives, from the"
"Consolidated  Fund  such  sum  of  money  and  on  such  terms  as"
"may  be  determined  by  the  Minister  in  charge  of  the  subject  of"
"Finance  in  consultation  with  the  Minister.    Sections  41,  42,"
"43,44 etc. provide for borrowings by the Board with consent and"
"concurrence  of  the  Finance  Minister  and  the  Subject  Minister,"
"which  are  guaranteed  by  the  Government  and  charged  on  and"
"paid out of the Consolidated Fund.  Section 49(2) says that the"
"accounts of the Board for each financial year shall be audited by"
"the  Auditor-General. 
  Section  57  provides 
for  acquisition  of"
"immovable  property  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act 
for  the"
"Board,  and  section  61  provides  for  special  Grant  or  Lease  of"
"immovable property to the Board under State Lands Ordinance."
"It is absolutely clear that the CEB is not the private property of"
"its  Board  of  Directors.    The  money  which  the  CEB  needs  is"
"raised not by issuing shares, but by borrowing.  Borrowing from"
"whom? Predominantly from the Treasury.  When borrowed from"
