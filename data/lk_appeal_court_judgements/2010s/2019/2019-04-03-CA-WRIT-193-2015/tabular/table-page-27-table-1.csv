"professional,  sporting  and  other  activities  are  regulated  by"
"powerful  bodies  which  are  devoid  of  statutory  status,  and"
"Courts  in  Sri  Lanka  and  elsewhere  have  demonstrated  a"
"willingness  to  ‘recognize  the  realities  of  executive  power’"
"and to review the decisions of a number of such bodies. In"
"their desire to prevent the abuse of ‘executive power’ in the"
"hands  of  these  powerful  non-statutory  bodies,  the  courts"

"inferior  Court.  Later  its  ambit  was  extended  to  statutory"
"tribunals  determining  a 
lis 
inter  partes.  Later,  again 
it"
"extended  to  cases  where  there  was  not  lis 
in  the  strict"
"sense  of  the  word,  but  where 
immediate  or  subsequent"
"rights of citizens were affected.”"
