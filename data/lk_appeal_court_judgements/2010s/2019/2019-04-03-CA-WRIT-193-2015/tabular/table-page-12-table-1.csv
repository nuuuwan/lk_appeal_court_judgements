"Union shall be liable on any contract entered into by it or by"
"any  agent  acting  on  its  behalf  (section  28).  It  can  be  sued"
"by  its  own  member  for  wrongful  expulsion,  i.e.   breach  of"
"contract. (Bonsor v. Musicians’ Union (1956) AC 104; (1955)"
"AER  518)  A  registered  Trade  Union  might  sue  in  its  own"
"name 
for  defamation  where 
the  defamatory  statement"
"touches 
its  collective  reputation.

"Workers  v.  Gillian  (1945)  2  All  ER  593)  A  registered  Trade"
"Union may thus be described as having been given a quasi"
"corporate  status  by 
the 
legislature  which  has  however"
"carefully  avoided  conferring  corporate  personality  on  a"
"Trade Union. A registered Trade Union has thus been given"
"recognition by law as a body distinct from individuals  who"
"from 
time 
to 
time 
compose 
it, 
although 
it 
is 
an"
"unincorporated  body.  By 
registration, 
the  Trade  Union"
"acquires some ‘existence’ in law apart from the members. It"
"is thus a statutory legal entity capable of rights and duties."
"“A  Trade  Union 
(which 
is  a  body  unincorporate) 
is  a"
"separate entity.” per Lord Denning in Willis v. Association of"
"Universities (1964) 2 All ER 39 at 42."
