"A
 copy of the District Court case record has been tendered marked"
"X4. 
  According 
to 
the  Journal  Entry  No.1,  summons  on 
the"
"defendant-petitioner  had  been  issued  both  by  registered  post  and"
"through 
fiscal  returnable  on  30.07.2009. 
  Summons  sent  by"
"registered  post  has  not  been  returned  undelivered,  but  the  fiscal"
"has  reported  to  Court  that  summons  could  not  be  served  on  the"
"defendant-petitioner  personally  as  the  house  was  closed,  and  not"
"as  the  address  was 
insufficient  or 
incorrect. 
  However  on  the"
"summons  returnable  date,  the  proxy  of  the  defendant-petitioner"
"had  been  filed  by  Mr.  Shirley  Gurugalgoda,  an  Attorney-at-Law,"
"who is a practicing lawyer in hulftsdrop even to date."
"There  is  no  suspicion  whatsoever  about  that  proxy  (which  is  at"
"page 19 of X4).  The defendant-petitioner’s correct name, address,"
"National  Identity  Card  number  and  her  signature—everything  is"
"there, and the Attorney-at-Law has inter alia particularly recorded"
"in it that the defendant-petitioner placed her signature before him."
"This  is  a  requirement  made  necessary  under  section  59(5)  of  the"
"Civil 
Procedure  Code 
(introduced 
by  Civil 
Procedure  Code"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No. 
14 
of 
1997) 
to 
avert 
this 
kind 
of"
"applications."
"It is significant to note that the defendant-petitioner in the petition"
"and the corresponding affidavit does not particularly state that the"
"details  stated  in  the  proxy  of  her  are  incorrect  and  the  signature"
"appearing  in  the  proxy  is  forged  or  that  it  is  not  her  signature."
"What she  inter alia  says is that “The proxy filed on my behalf  was"
"done so fraudulently and surreptitiously without my knowledge and"
"that 
I  had  no  notice  whatsoever  of  the  above  said  proceedings"
"commenced against me”."
