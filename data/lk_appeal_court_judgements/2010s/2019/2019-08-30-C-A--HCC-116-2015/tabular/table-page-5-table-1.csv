"","seldom you  get eye  witnesses  to  the  crime  other than  the  victim.  In  case of"

"","'1t  is  very dangerous  to  act on the  uncorroborated testimony of"

"","such evidence can be acted on even  in the absence of corroboration. '"

"","of sexual assault  in  the  absence  of corroboration as  a rule,  is  adding"

"","uncorroborated  testimony  of the  victim,  provided  her  evidence  is  cogent"
"","acceptable, and  if the Court is  convinced that she is  telling the truth."
