"[1985J CRI. LJ. 493 at 498/499 held;"
"""While  appreciating  the  evidence  of a  witness, 
the  approach"
"must be whether the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to"
"have  ring of truth.  Once  that  impression  is formed, 
it  is  undoubtedly"
"necessary for  the  court  to  scrutinize  the  evidence  more particularly"
"keeping  in  view  the  deficiencies,  drawbacks  and  infirmities  pointed"
"out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it"
"is  against the  general tenor  of the  evidence given  by the  witness and"
"whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to  tender it"
"on 
trivial  matters  not 
unworthy  of  belief  Minor  discrepancies"
"touching  the  core  of the  case,  hyper-technical  approach  by  taking"
"sentences torn  out of context here and there from  evidence,  attaching"
"importance  to  some  technical  error  committed  by  the 
investigating"
"officer not going to  the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit"
"rejection  of the  evidence  as  a  whole.  If the  court  before  whom  the"
"witness gives  evidence had the  opportunity to form  the  opinion about"
"the general tenor of evidence given by the witness,  the appellate court"
"to  attach  due  weight  to 
the 
which  had  not  this  benefit  will  have"
"the 
trial  court  and  unless 
there  are 
appreciation  of evidence  by"
"reasons weightily and formidable  it would not be proper to  reject the"
"evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter"
"of trivial  details.  Even  honest  and  truthful  witnesses  may  differ 
in"
