"","victim to  look  at the watch to  see  the  exact time when he  is  being  stabbed."
"","This argument of the counsel for Appellant is without substance."
"19.","Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that according to the doctor who"
"","examined  the  PW1,  he  had  stated  that  one  Karunasena  stabbed  him.  It is"
"","submitted that Karunasena must be some other person."
"20.","On  perusing the  evidence  of the  doctor who  examined the  PW1,  it  is  clear"
"","that  according  to  the  doctor  PWI  had  given  the  name  of the  person  who"
"","stabbed him as  Kumarasena, not Karunasena. (page 223  of the appeal brief)."
"","Name of the Appellant is Kumarasiri. PWI had mentioned to police and also"
"","to  court  about  Kumarasiri,  the  Appellant.  It is  obvious  that  the  doctor  had"
"","made  a  mistake  by 
taking 
the  name  down  as  Kumarasena, 
instead  of"
"","Kumarasiri.  This ground of appeal also should necessarily fail."
"","IS 
Hence 
the  conviction  and  sentence  of the 
learned  High  Court  Judge"
"","affirmed."
