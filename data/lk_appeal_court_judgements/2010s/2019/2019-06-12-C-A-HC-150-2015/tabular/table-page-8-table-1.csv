"14.","It is  pertinent to note that it was  suggested to the PWI  by the defence at the"
"","trial, that it was Sumanasiri who stabbed the victims. Further, while denying"
"","any involvement to the incident, in his dock statement the Appellant had said"
"","that  PWI  had  a  dispute  with  Sumanasiri  and  that  victims  implicated  them"
"","because of the previous enmity."
"15.","There 
is  no 
evidence  of  pre-planning 
for  days 
to  commit  murder  as"
"","submitted  by  the  Counsel  for  Appellant.  However  the  evidence  is  that  the"
"","Appellant  and  his 
father  blocked 
the 
road  and  Appellant  stabbed 
the"
"","deceased and PWI. There is no evidence of a sudden fight."
"16.","Although the  deceased had only  one stab  injury  other than the  abrasions  on"
"","the face,  shoulder,  knee,  and  ankle,  the  stab  injury had been on the chest.  It"
"","has  pierced  the  heart.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the  intention  was  to  cause"
"","death  of the  deceased when he was  stabbed on  the  chest piercing the heart."
"","The stab injury to PWI was also on his chest."
"","The intention to kill can be formed at any  moment, not necessarily after pre"
"","planning. In the above premise, ground of appeal No.  02  should fail."
