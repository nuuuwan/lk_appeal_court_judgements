"In  Surangi  v.  Rodrigo (2003)  3 SrLLR  35,  it was held that:  ""no  court  is  entitled  to  or has"
"jurisdiction to grant reliefs to a party which are not prayed for in the prayer to the plaint; where the plaintiff"
"has  intended  to  recover  Rs.700,Ooor  from 
the  defendant  as  'damages  and  she  has  deliberately  and"
".mequivocally prayed for  damGges  in  prayer  ""B"".  Her  intention  is  to  use  the  damages  so  recovered  as"
"permanent alimony.  Therefore  her claim is  not a claim for alimony at all;  in  the absence of a prayer for"
"alimony the Court was correct in refusing to allow the petition to frame in issue relating to alimony""."
"In National Development Bank v.  Rupasinghe and others (2005) 3 SrLLR 92 it was held"
"that:  ""Jurisdiction of court 'is  limited and restricted  to what is prayed for and  no  other relief could be"
"granted by court if not prayed fer"".  At page 95 Andrew Somawansa,j. (PICA) stated that: ""Thus"
"it is to be seen that the interim i;1junction that has been ultimately issued and the other made by the learned"
"District Judge is much wider than the relief sought by the plaintiff-respondents themselves. It is settled law"
","
"that the jurisdiction of Court is  limited and restricted to what is prayed for and no other relief could be"
"granted by court not prayed for""."
",should be  dismissed  for  want  of 
Accordingly  I  take  the  \ iew  the  rei  vindicatio  action"
"evidence and I set aside the judgment dated 05.12.2000 and proceed to allow the appeal."
