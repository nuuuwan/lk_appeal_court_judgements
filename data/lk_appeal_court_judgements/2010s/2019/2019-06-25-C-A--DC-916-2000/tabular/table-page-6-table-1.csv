"It  transpired from,  the Plaintiff's evidence that the defendants had removed the fence and"
"re~done the fence from one end to the other end of the fence and that the Defendants had"
"not encroached onto the P!~intiff's land from the middle portion of the boundary between"
"lot 2 and lot 5 of Plan No.2i66."
"The Defendants did not give evidence and did not mark any documents and closed their"
"case."
"Afterwards  both parties  filed  their  respective  written  submissions  and judgment  was"
"delivered  on  05.12.2000.  In  the  judgment  the  learned  District  judge  states  that  the"
"defendants had not encroached onto any portion of the land of the Plaintiff, but however"
"the learned District judge goes on to state that  the Plaintiff can demarcate the boundaries"
"lot 2 and lot 5 through the licensed Surveyor."
"It has to be noted that the Plaintiff came into court OIl the basis of  a rei vindicatio action"
"and no action for demarcation of boundaries action had been filed.  Looking at the prayer"
"to the plaint it is clear that the Plaintiff has prayed that the Defendants be ejected from the"
"portion of land described ~n the schedule to the plaint and that the Plaintiff be declared"
"the owner of the land in dispute. The Plaintiff has even prayed that damages be paid to the"
"Plaintiff due to the encroo.chment by the Defendants. 
."
"Upon a perusal of the evidence it is clear that the Defendants have not encroached onto"
"any portion of Lot 5 or the Plaintiff's land (as has  been answered by the learned District"
"judge to Issue No.9 above). In such a situation the District Court should have proceeded"
"to dismiss this action."
"!"
"There  was  no issue 
to demarcate  the boundary between Lot 1 and  Lot  5  as  per  Plan"
"No.2166.  In  the circums'cances  a relief that had not been prayed for  cannot be granted."
"Furthermore if the relief prayed for in the prayer to the plaint is incapable of being granted"
"due to lack of evidence,  the plaint is liable to be dismissed."
"Jt has to be accepted that there is not even a scintilla of doubt whether or not this action"
"is a rei vindicatio action or 3.  demarcation of boundaries c'.etion."
