"In  Piyaratana  Thera  v.  Jathiya  and Another [[1985)  2 SrLL.R.  418]  the Supreme Court  held  that"
"where title by prescription to Buddhist temple land  had  not been  acquired prior to 1931, Section"
"34  of the  Buddhist Temporalities  Ordinance  bars  the  acquisition  of prescriptive title to temple"
"land."
"In  any  event it is  observed that the Defendant has  not in the Answer given  the starting point for"

"However, the learned  counsel  for the Substituted Defendant-Appellant (Appellant)  had  another"
