"In  S.P.  Gunatilake v.  Sunil Ekanayake  (supra) lA.N. De  Silva  c.J.  was  of the view that the total"
"failure to file a proxy does  not in  any way effect the validity of the proceedings.  However, that"
"was not a case dealing with the application of section 48(4) of the Act. The objection to the proxy"
"not been filed was  in that case taken up in appeal whereas in this case it was taken up before the"
"District Court. Furthermore, in that case the Supreme Court considered the fact of filing a proxy"
"belatedly which  led to the court concluding that it has  succeeded  in  ratifying the  appearances"
"and applications of the registered Attorney and thereby supplying all such acts with legal validity."
"In this case,  it was the proxy of Ms.  Dayanthi Udalagama that was filed later and not of Mr. C.H."
