"T
he  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  strenuously  contended"
"before  this  Court  that  without  a  superimposition,  the  Court"
"Commissioner  could  not  have  come  to  that  conclusion.    In  the"
"unique  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  am  unable  to"
"agree with that contention."
"This  is  not  a  case  where  the  Court  Commissioner  for  the  first"
"time  took  up  such  a  position  in  the  witness  box.    He,  before"
"parties  tendered  their  statements  of  claim,  expressly  stated  in"
"his  Report  to  the  Preliminary  Plan  that  “This  Lot  [Lot  2  of  the"
"Preliminary  Plan] 
represents  Lot  E  of  Plan  No.  2459  dated"
"27.8.1934  prepared  by  W.R.S.  Fernando,  Licensed  Surveyor.”"
"According to section 18(2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977,"
"as  amended,  that  constitutes  evidence  without 
further  proof"
"subject to calling him, in terms of the proviso to section 18(2), as"
"a  witness.    I  concede  that  it  would  have  been  better  had  there"
"been a superimposition on the application of the 23rd defendant."
"But,  if  the  appellants  disputed  the  said  position  of  the  Court"
"Commissioner, they also could, as this is a partition action, have"
"got a commission issued for a superimposition."
"It must be emphasized that the plaintiff did not dispute the said"
"fact, i.e. exclusion of Lot 2, by preferring an appeal.  The reason"
"being,  as  I  understand,  the  plaintiff  or  his  predecessor  was  a"
"party to the other case No. 12447."
"It is also  significant to note that  the substituted 23rd  defendant"
"who  gave  evidence  at  the  trial  on  exclusion  of  Lot  2  was  never"
"cross-examined  by  the  appellants  on  that  point  or  any  other"
"point."
