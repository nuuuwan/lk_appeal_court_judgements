"object to  the  charge sheet.  The  Learned Magistrate  in  the  order,  with regard  to  the"
"said preliminary objection, had  reproduced the charge and mentioned section 73  of"
"the  Primary  Courts  Procedure  Act.  Even  the  police  plaint  contained  the  relevant"
"penal  section.  It appears  that  the  absence  of the  penal  section  in  the  charge  was  a"
"typographical error.  Considering all these facts , I am of the view that the appellant"
"did  not raise any objection  to  the charge  even  though  he  had  ample  opportunity to"
"do  so.  Therefore,  he  should  not  be  allowed  to  throw  technical  objections  at  the"
"procedure in  order to delay the court proceedings."
