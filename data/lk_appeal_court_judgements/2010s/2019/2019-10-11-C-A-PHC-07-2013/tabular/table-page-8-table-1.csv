in  a  report  made  to  Court  under  Section  148(1)(b)  of the"
"","Criminal Procedure Code,  the Penal Provision was mentioned but,  in"
"","the  charge  sheet from  which 
the  accused  was . charged, 
the  penal"

"","His  Lordship held as follows;"
"","""The  omission  to  mention  in a charge sheet the penal section is not a"
"","fatal  irregularity if the  accused has not been  misled by such omission."
"","is 
In 
such  a  case  Section  171  of the  Criminal  Procedure  Code"
"","applicable. """
"","Some  of these  cases  were  decided  under  the  previous  Criminal  Procedure  Code"

"","Criminal  Procedure  Act  15  of 1979  is  equivalent  to  section  171  of the  previous"
"","code  whereas  section 436  of the  Code  of Criminal  Procedure  Act  is  equivalent to"
"section 425  of the Previous Code.",""
"In","light  of above, 
it  is  manifestly  clear  that  mere  absence  of the  penal  section"
"","would  not  be  regarded  as  a  fatal  error  unless  the  appellant  was  misled  or  grave"
"","prejudice was  caused due to  such omission. I observe that in the  instant appeal,  the"
"","charge contains the patiiculars such as the date of offence, the place of offence and"
"","a  lengthy  description  of the  offence  committed.  I  think  the  charge  is  descriptive"
"enough","to  give 
the  appellant  of  notice  as 
to,

is  being  charged."
"Therefore,  I  am  of the  view that no  prejudice  had  been caused to  the  appellant  by",""
