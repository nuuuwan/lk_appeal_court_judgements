"Court and  in that context the following statement of Seneviratne J.  in Nicholas v.  Macon Markar"
"Ltd.  [(1985)  1 Sri.  L.  R. 130 at 139] is  instructive:"
"""In this application the function of this Court is to make judicial  review of the order made"
"by the Rent  Board  of Review. There  is  a fine  distinction  between,  ""appeal""  and  ""judicial"
"review"". When  hearing an  appeal, the court is  concerned with the merits of the decision"
"in appeal. The  question before court is whether the decision subject matter of the appeal"
"is  right or wrong. In  the case of judicial review, the question before court is whether the"
"decision or order is lawful, that is according to law.  As  such  in  this application for a writ,"
"it is  not the function of this court to decide whether the order of the Rent  Board  is  right"
"or wrong, or whether the order of the Rent Board of Review is right or wrong. Thefunction"
"of this court in this instance is to decide whether on the principles applicable to judicial"
"review,  the order of the Rent Board of Review should be allowed to stand or should be"
"set aside"".  (emphasis added)"
