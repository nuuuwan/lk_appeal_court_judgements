"appeal as well."
"A petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is not entitled"
"to relief as  a matter of course, as  a matter of right or as  a matter of routine.  Even  if he is  entitled"
"to  relief,  still  the  Court  has  a discretion  to deny  him  relief  having  regard  to his  conduct,  delay,"
"laches,  waiver,  submission  to jurisdiction  - are  all  valid  impediments  which  stand  against  the"
"grant of relief. The  impugned decision was  made in 1996 while the application of the Petitioners"
"was filed in 2004. However, the Petitioners contend that the decision was not known and became"
"public only when  it was  sought to be  implemented in  2004.  In  any event,  in  Biso  Menika v.  Cyril"
"De Alwis and others [(1982)  1 SrLLR.  368 at 379] Sharvananda J.  (as  he was then)  held:"
