"""The workmen by making their application to the Labour Tribunal were attempting to circumvent"
"the terms  and  conditions of the  circular after having  received  the  benefits  due  upon  it. A legal"
"procedure in the nature of an application to the Labour Tribunal in terms of Section 3lB (1) cannot"
"be resorted  to for such a purpose. The doctrine of approbate and reprobate (quad approbo and"
"non reprobo) is based on the principle that no person can accept and reject the same instrument."""
"This  equitable  principle  has  been  reiterated  in  a  number  of  English  cases  including"
"Barclays Bank Trust Co. Ltd v.  Bluff  1981 3 All ER 232 and in Bardam v.  Evans 19361KB"
"202 at p.2ll. In his dissenting judgment  Greer LJ in Bardam states as follows:-"
"""It was put by one of my brethren on the ground that a man is not entitled to reprobate that which"
"he has already approbated. In my view, that principle has no application to this case, because it is"
"based on this, that a man may not at one moment take an advantage of someagreementor some fact"
"and at a later moment when it suits him reprobate that which he has approved."""
"On this reasoning if the Plaintiff rejects  P4 as their contractual basis, there is no cause of"
"action and their action should be dismissed. On the other hand if the Plaintiff accepts P4"
"as  they have done in the pleadings and evidence, then  they  cannot reject any part of the"
"contract and are bound to accept the whole contract."
"A perusal of the contractual document brings out an important aspect."
"Exemption of liability of the 1't  Defendant by P4"
"The contract P4 specifically exempts liability of the 1't Defendant under the contract in"
"the event of breach of same by  the buyer.  Under the margin  note 'Delivery'  the contract"
"specifically states, 'The seller holds the rights  to  re-sell  the nuts if not removed within the stipulated"
"period and any differe11ces in the price wi II  have to be bome by the buyer."""
"Thus the contract P4 specifically exempts the 1't Defendant from liability in the event of a"
"breach by the buyer and it is the buyer alone who undertakes to bear the loss arising from"
"differences in price if the seller is required to re-sell the goods in the event of a default on"
"the part of the buyer."
