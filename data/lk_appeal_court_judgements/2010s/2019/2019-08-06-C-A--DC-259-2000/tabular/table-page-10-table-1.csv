"Anson's law of Contract 29th  Ed.  P 33 defines ~Offer"" as foUows ~An Offer is an intimation"
"by words or conduct of a willingness to enter into a legally binding contract, and which in"
"its terms expressly or impliedly indicates that it  is to become  binding on the offeror  as"
"soon as it  has been accepted by an act, forbearance,  or return promise on the part of the"
"person to whom it is addressed to."""
"Therefore  P2 would  not constitute an offer as is understood in the law of Contract. The"
"law distinguishes between an offer that is capable of being accepted and a mere statement"
"by way of quoting a price.  In the case of Harvey v.  Facey (1893)  AC 552 court held that"
"even where the Plaintiff had written ""will you  sell us Bumper Hall Pen Telegraph lowest"
"price,""  and  the  Defendant  replied  lowest  price fo r  Bumper  Hall  Pen  900  pounds,  this"
"statement by the Defendant was held to be only an indication of price and not an offer that"
"can be accepted."
"Similarly,  in  Clifton  v.  Palumbo 1944  2  AER  497  the  court held  that  the  Defendant's"
"statement ""I am  prepared to offer you  my lythem Estate for 600,000 Pounds was held not"
"to constitute an offer""."
