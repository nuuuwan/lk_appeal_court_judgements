"T
he  doctrine  of  res  judicata,  as  the  Supreme  Court  in  Stassen"
"Exports  Ltd  v.  Lipton  Ltd2  expressed,  has  found  justification  in"
"two fundamental principles: “The first principle, which is public in"
"nature,  is  based  on  the  maxim  interest  rei  publicae  ut  sit  finis"
"litium (in the interest of the state that there be an end to litigation)"
"and secondly on the footing of a maxim, private in nature, namely,"
"nemo  debet  bis  vexari  pro  un  at  eadem  causa  (that  no  person"
"should be proceeded against twice for the same cause).”"
"This  Judgment  of  mine  shall  not  be  understood  that  when  a"
"case is dismissed on whatever the ground, res judicata applies.  I"
"do not propose to discuss the whole gamut of res judicata here."
"But  in  the  facts  and  circumstance  of  this  case,  I  hold  that:  (a)"
"the  respondents  cannot  now  cling  on  R2  to  justify  the  Quit"
"Notice  issued  under  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)"
"Act, which is being challenged in this case; and (b) insofar as the"
"recovery  of  possession  of  this  land  under  the  provisions  of  the"
"State  Lands 
(Recovery  of  Possession)  Act 
is  concerned, 
the"
"matter is res judicata."
"I quash the Quit Notice marked P21 by way of writ of certiorari"
"as prayed for in paragraph (c) of the prayer to the petition; and"
"also prohibit the respondents by way of writ of prohibition from"
"taking 
further  actions  to  evict  the  petitioners 
from  the 
land"
"under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act."
