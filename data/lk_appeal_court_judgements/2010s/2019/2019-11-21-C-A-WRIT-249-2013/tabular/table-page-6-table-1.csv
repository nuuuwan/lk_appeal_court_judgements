"A
ccording to R1(a), the extracts from the Land Registry,  R1 has"
"been executed on 05.06.1865, that is, after 01.01.1864.  On the"
"other  hand,  there  is  no  subsequent  registered  instrument  in"
"respect  of 
the 
land,  under 
the 
registration  of  Documents"
"Ordinance."
"As 
the 
learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
petitioners 
submits, 
the"
"registration  under  the  Registration  of  Documents  Ordinance"
"does  not  determine  title  to  a  particular  land.    Registration  will"
"only  give  priority  against  an  unregistered  or  subsequently"
"registered instrument."
"Secondly, 
the 
learned  SSC  by 
tendering 
the  Gazette  dated"
"16.11.1934  marked  R2  states  that  this 
land  was  settled 
in"
"favour of the Crown under the Land Settlement Ordinance."
"The respondents in paragraph 8(c) of the statement of objections"
"state that “The existence of the above mentioned land settlement"
"gazette in relation to the subject state land was not known to the"
"predecessors  of  the  office  of  Divisional  Secretary  of  Walipitiya-"
"Divithura Divisional Secretariat until much later”."
"If that argument is to be accepted, there is no end to litigation,"
"and  there  is  no  meaning  to  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata.    “The"
"doctrine of res judicata applies to all matters which existed at the"
"time  of  giving 
the 
judgment  and  which 
the  party  had  an"
"opportunity of bringing before Court.”1"
