"'RiA'  describes  the  State  as  being  the  claimant to the  said  land  and  specifies"
"further that the said  land  is  part  of Lots  F27  -
K27  of Plan  No.  165,  which  has"
"been  produced  marked  'R3'. The  Respondents  have also submitted  Preliminary"

"This  Court  must observe at this  stage  that in  terms of Section  21  of the Survey"
"Act  No.  17  of  2002,  ""Any  cadastral  map,  plan,  or  any  other  plan  or  map"

"This  Court  is  of the  view  that the  1st  Respondent  had  cogent  material, in  the"
"form  of a Surveyor  General's  plan  that the  said  land  was  State  land.  In  these"
"circumstances, 
this  Court 
is  of  the  view 
that 
the  opinion 
formed  by 
the"
"Divisional  Secretary  that  the  said 
land 
is  State 
land 
is 
reasonable  and 
is  a"
"decision  that a  reasonable  man  would  have  arrived  at,  on  the  strength  of the"
"Surveyor  General's  plan.  Hence, 
this  Court  does  not  see  any  merit 
in 
the"
"argument of the Petitioners."
"Thi s Court  is  further of the view that the Competent Authority is  only required"
"to 
form  an  opinion 
that 
the 
impugned 
land 
is  State 
land  and 
that 
the"
"possession  is  unauthorised. The  Competent Authority is  not  required  in  terms"
