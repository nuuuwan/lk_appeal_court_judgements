"Both (a) and (b) are important. The maxim will seldom have no application unless, not"
"merely  the  thing,  but  also  ""all  the  surrounding  circumstances""  are  wholly  within the"
"defendant's contro1.3"
"In Barkway v.  South Wales Transport Co.  Ltc! an omnibus belonging to the defendant"
"Company ran off the road and fell  over an embankment as the result of a tyre~burst. The"
"plaintiff's husband who happened to be travelling in that omnibus met with his death in"
"consequence of the accident. The plaintiff claimed damages from the defendant Company"
"on the ground of negligence. It was established by the defendants that the tyre~burst was"
"due to what is called an 'impact fracture'  due  to heavy blows or impacts on the tyre as"
"the  result  of  the  tyre  coming  into  violent  contact  with  some  hard object.  It was  also"
"proved by the defendants that the tyres  of their vehicle were examined regularly,  twice"
"weekly,  and  this  particular  tyre  was  examined  two  days  before  the  accident  by  the"
"person appointed to examine  the tyres  and no  defect was  discovered.  However,  it was"
"found that the defendants had not instructed their drivers to report heavy blows to tyres"
"likely  to  cause  'impact  fractures'.  Their  Lordships  held  that  it  was  the  duty  of  the"
"defendant Company to have instructed their drivers to report such heavy blows, and the"
"failure  to  do  so  rendered  them  liable  to  pay  damages  to  the  plaintiff  on  account  of"
"negligence."
"In the above case, Asquith LJ. in the Court of AppealS sets out in very clear language, the"
"law regarding the onus of proof when the principle of ""res ipsa loquitur"" arises."
