"Where  the  accident  could  not  in  the  normal  course  of  events  have  occurred  without"
"negligence on the part of the Defendant, the rule res ipsa loquitur applies and the Plaintiff"
"discharges  the  burden  merely  proving  the  accident.  In  such  cases  it  is  said  that  the"
"accident itself affords presumptive evidence of negligence."
"Examples are given of cases in which the facts  speak for themselves (res ipsa loquitur),  as"
"when  a  barrel  of flour  fell  from  an  upper  floor  of  a  warehouse  and  injured  a person"
"passing in the street~see Byrne v.  Boadie. l  In  Scott v.  London &  St.  Katherine Docks"
"Compan y,2  the  defendant  was  in  possession  of  a  warehouse  and  crane  for  lowering"
"goods from the warehouse to the ground. Plaintiff who was passing the warehouse was"
"injured by the fall  of six bags  of sugar that were being lowered by the crane, which fell"
"from the defendant's warehouse. There was no explanation from the defendant as to how"
"it happened, but the presumption was that it may not happen in the ordinary course of"
"things, if the things are under the management of the defendant or his servants.  It was"
"held that it was sufficient for  the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was in control of"
"the situation and that the accident itself was prima facie evidence of negligence."
"In this case Erle CJ. made the following observations."
