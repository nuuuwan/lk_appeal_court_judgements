"A
  Judge  in  the  Judgment  cannot  come  to  conclusions  without"
"giving reasons.  If the conclusions are without reasons they cannot"
"be treated as conclusions.  If reasons are not given, there is no way"
"the Appellate Court can test the correctness of that conclusion."
"Although altogether 17 issues have been raised, the District Judge"
"has answered only 7 issues."
"I  set  aside  the  Judgment  of  the  District  Court  dated  12.07.2000"
"and  direct  the  incumbent  District  Judge  to  deliver  the  Judgment"
"afresh  on  the  evidence  already  led.    In  order  to  assist  the  Court,"
"counsel for both parties can be given an opportunity to file written"
"submissions prior to the delivery of the Judgment."
"Appeal allowed."
