"In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed14 Sansoni C.J. stated:"
"The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite"
"independent  of  and  distinct  from  the  appellate  jurisdiction  of"
"this  Court.  Its  object  is  the  due  administration  of  justice  and"
"the  correction  of  errors,  sometimes  committed  by  this  Court"
"itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of justice."
