"It is well settled that the order of an inferior tribunal having a"
"duty to act reasonably in determining the rights of the parties"
"is liable to be quashed by Writ of Certiorari for an error of law"
"appearing  on  the face  of  the  record.  A finding  of fact  may  be"
"impugned  on  the  ground  of  error  of  law  on  the  face  of  the"
"record  (a)  erroneously  refusing  to  admit  admissible  material"
"evidence 
(b)  erroneously  admitting 
inadmissible  evidence"
"which influence the finding (c) finding of based on no evidence"
"(d)  where 
the 
tribunal  had  acted  with  manifest  or  clear"
"unreasonableness  or  unfairness.  The  misconstruction  of  the"
"document becomes an error on the face of the record."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Arbitrator  had  misconstrued  the"
"document  R16b  when  he 
failed 
to  consider 
that 
the 
loss"
"depicted in the Report and speculated on the fact that it  was"
"temporary  without  any  evidence.  There  was  no  evidence  for"
"such  a 
finding.  This  was  unreasonable  and  unfair.  The"
"evidence  revealed  that  the  employees  were  getting  a  higher"
"wage  than  prescribed  by  the  Wages  Board  Ordinance.  They"
"were  paid  more  than  the  other  competitors  in  the  Trade.  The"
"Arbitrator failed to consider the heavy financial loss and had"
"acted  unreasonably  and  unfairly 
in  granting  30  percent"
"increase in wages with a 10% increase in productivity was an"
"error  of law  on  the face  of  the  record.  In  the  circumstances,  I"
"quash the award of the 2nd Respondent by granting a writ of"
"Certiorari."
