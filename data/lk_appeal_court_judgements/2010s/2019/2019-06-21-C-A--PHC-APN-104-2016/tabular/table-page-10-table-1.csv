"petitioner  has  accepted  the  decision.    He  does  not  say  where  and"
"when the petitioner has accepted the decision.  If the petitioner has"
"accepted  the  decision  taken  after  the  inquiry,  there  is  no  case  for"
"the petitioner, and if it so, in my view, it is obligatory on the part of"
"the learned High Court Judge to have exactly pointed it out in the"
"order the place where he has accepted the decision, for the benefit"
"of the petitioner and the Appellate Court.  It is regrettable that the"

"If the respondent says that the petitioner admitted the liability for"
"shortage  of  goods  during  the  course  of  inquiry,  there  would  not"
"have been any reason to proceed with the inquiry any further.  The"

"Most importantly, if the petitioner admitted the liability during the"
