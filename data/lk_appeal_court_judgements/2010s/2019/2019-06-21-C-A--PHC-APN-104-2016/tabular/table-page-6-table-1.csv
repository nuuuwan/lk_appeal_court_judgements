"Lack  of 
jurisdiction  may  arise 
in  different  ways.  While"
"engaged on a proper inquiry the tribunal may depart from the"
"rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong questions"
"or may take into account matters which it was not directed to"
"take 
into 
account. 
Thereby 
it  would 
step 
outside 
its"
"jurisdiction. 
  A 
tribunal  which  has  made 
findings  of 
fact"
"wholly  unsupported  by  evidence  or  which 
it  has  drawn"
"inferences wholly unsupported by any of the facts found by it"
"will be held to have erred in point of law. The concept of error"
"of  law  includes  the  giving  of  reasons  that  are  bad  in  law  or"
"inconsistent,  unintelligible  or 
it  would  seem  substantially"
"inadequate.  It  includes  also  the  application  of  a  wrong  legal"
"test  to  the  facts  found  taking  irrelevant  considerations  into"
"account  and  arriving  at  a  conclusion  without  any  supporting"
"evidence.  If  reasons  are  given  and  these  disclose  that  an"
"erroneous 
legal  approach  has  been 
followed 
the  superior"
"Court  can  set  the  decision  aside  by  certiorari for  error  of  law"
"on  the  face  of  the  record.  If  the  grounds  or  reasons  stated"
"disclose  a  clearly  erroneous  legal  approach  the  decision  will"
"be quashed. An error of law may also be held to be apparent"
"on 
the 
face  of 
the  record 
if 
the 
inferences  and  decisions"
"reached  by  the  tribunal  in  any  given  case  are  such  as  no"
"reasonable  body  of  persons  properly  instructed  in  the  law"
"applicable to the case could have made."
