"R
egulation  55  of  the  Emergency 
(Miscellaneous  Provisions  and"
"Powers)  Regulations,  No.  6  of  1971,  published 
in  Government"
"Gazette of August 15, 1971 provided that “Section 45 of the Courts"
"Ordinance  (which  conferred  jurisdiction  on  the  Supreme  Court  to"
"issue writs of habeas corpus) shall not apply in regard to any person"
"detained or held in custody under any emergency regulation.”"
"In  Hidaramani  v.  Ratnavale  (1971)  75  NLR  67  the  majority  of  the"
"Supreme  Court  held  that  regulation  55  is  intended  to  remove  the"
"court’s jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus only in respect"
"of  a  lawful  detention  under  any  emergency  regulation  and  not"
"otherwise. In other words, regulation 55 will not apply to the case"
"of  a  person  unlawfully  detained  under  an  invalid  detention  order"
"made in abuse of the powers conferred by regulation 18(1)."
"In  Abeywickrema  v.  Pathirana 
[1986]  1  Sri  LR  120  at  156,"
"Sharvananda  C.J.  opined  that  “Ouster  clauses  do  not  prevent  the"
"court from intervening in the case of excess of jurisdiction”."
"The  parameters  of  the  phrase  “excess  of  jurisdiction”  is  so  wide."
"That  should  not  be  confined  to  the  narrow  question  whether  the"
"administrative body or tribunal had jurisdiction to inquire into the"
"matter.    There  may  be  a  number  of  instances  where  despite  the"
"administrative  body  having 
jurisdiction 
to 
embark  upon 
the"
"inquiry, 
in  the  course  of  the 
inquiry, 
it  does  or  omits  to  do"
"something of such a nature as to make the decision a nullity.  That"
"may  include  the  administrative  body  making  a  decision  which  it"
"has no power to make.  It may have given the decision in bad faith."
"It  may  have  in  good  faith  misdirected  itself  in  construing  vital"
"documents. 
 
It  may 
have 
taken 
irrelevant  matters 
into"
