"It is  trite  law that mere  giving instruction is npt sufficient to discharge the burden"
"cast  on  a  vehicle  owner  under  the  Forest  Ordinance.  I  observe  that  the  Learned"
"Magistrate had evaluated the evidence before him and concluded that the appellant"
"had  failed  to  discharge  the  said  burden  cast  on  her.  The  confiscation  order  was"
"made  well  within  law. Therefore  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  was  correct  in"
"dismissing the revision application due to lack of exceptional circumstances."
"Considering  above,  I  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  findings  of the  Learned"
"Magistrate  dated  11.11.2015  and the Learned High Court Judge  dated 22.06.2017"
"and therefore I affirm the same."
"The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs."
