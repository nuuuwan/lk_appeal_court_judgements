"d
istinction  between  those  who  have  been  issued  with  Annual"
"Practising  Licences  and  those  who  have  not  been  issued  with"
"Annual Practising Licences.  The subject of continuing education"
"for  Government  Surveyors  in  land  surveying  shall  come  under"
"their Head of the Department who is the Surveyor General.  That"
"has nothing to do with issuance of Annual Practising Licences to"
"Government Surveyors."
"Let me make this point clear.  There cannot be an argument that"
"there  is  a  difference  between  Surveyors  in  Government  Service"
"and  those  who  are  not.    That  is  not  the  issue  although  Private"
"Surveyors  have 
taken 
enormous 
effort 
to  portray 
such  a"
"distinction  within  the  Act.    The  issue  is  whether,  within  the"
"scheme  of  the  Act,  the 
former  can  be  allowed  to  engage 
in"
"private land surveying for a fee (subject to conditions)."
"On  behalf  of  the  Private  Surveyors  it  is  vehemently  submitted"
"that, 
if 
the 
legislature 
intended 
to 
issue  Annual  Practising"
"Licences 
for  the  Government  Surveyors  to  engage 
in  private"
"practice,  it  could  have  been  expressly  stated  so  in  the  Survey"
"Act.12  I  beg  to  disagree.  If  the  legislature  intended  not  to  issue"
"Annual  Practising  Licences 
for  the  Government  Surveyors  to"
"engage  in  private  practice,  then  it  should  have  been  expressly"
"stated in the Act, and not vice versa. Nowhere in the Act does it"
"say that a Government Surveyor is prohibited from obtaining an"
"Annual  Practising  Licence.  It  is  a  well-accepted  principle  that"
"prohibitions cannot be presumed."
