  Government  Surveyor  who  wishes  to  do  private"
"practice  shall  obtain  a  Licence  from  the  Land  Survey  Council,"
"which  can  be  extended  annually,  based  on  various 
factors"
"including the performances of the previous year.  Permission to"
"private  practice 
is  subject  to  several  conditions  designed  to"
"maintain  the  integrity  and  efficiency  of  the  Survey  Department."
"More importantly, the conditions in the Circular are not fixed.  If"
"those  conditions  are  not  adequate,  more  conditions  can  be"
"introduced  both  by 
the  subject  Minister  and 
the  Surveyor"
"General to address the particular issues."
"The 
impugned  Circular  No.  5/2011  of  the  Surveyor  General"
"whereby  the  Government  Surveyors  are  permitted  to  do  private"
"practice  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  therein  is,  in  my  view,"
"not ultra vires."
"The application of the Petitioners is dismissed.  In the facts and"
"circumstances of this case, I make no order as to costs."
