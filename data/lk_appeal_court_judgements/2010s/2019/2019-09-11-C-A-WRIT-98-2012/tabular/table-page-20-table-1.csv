"Y
et  another  argument  is  potential  conflicts  of  interest  with  the"
"State  if  the  Government  Surveyors  are  allowed  to  do  private"
"practice  outside  duty  hours. 
 
It 
is  a  mistake  to  think  that"
"conflicts  of  interest  will  emerge  only  if  Government  Surveyors"
"are allowed to do private practice.  That can happen even during"
"the  course  of  their  official  commitments.    Conflicts  of  interest"
"can  also  arise  in  cases  of  surveyors  who  engage  exclusively  in"
"private  practice.  Under 
the  new  Act  as 
the  Council 
is 
the"
"controller  of  all 
the  Registered  Surveyors,  Government  and"
"Private  alike, 
it  appears  that,  when  necessity  demands,  the"
"Council 
can  assign  Government 
land 
surveying 
to  Private"
"Surveyors.  Then the same argument will be applicable to Private"
"Surveyors  as  well.  I  might  add  that  the  prospect  of  conflict  of"
"interest  is  relevant  to  any  profession  including  legal  profession"
"irrespective of whether one is a Judge, or a lawyer, in the official"
"or unofficial Bar. If there is a likelihood of a conflict of interest,"
"the 
officer 
concerned 
is 
expected 
to 
desist 
from 
such"
"engagements.    Such  degree  of  professionalism  is  expected  not"
"only 
from 
the  Government  Surveyors  but  also 
from  Private"
"Surveyors."
"Connected  to  the  above,  the  Private  Surveyors  argue  that 
if"
"private  practice  is  allowed  for  Government  Surveyors,  that  will"
"impinge  upon  independence  of  the  Surveyor  General  and  his"
"officers."
"Government  Surveyors  who  engage  in  private  practice  will  be"
"under  strict  scrutiny  of  the  Surveyor  General  and  necessary"
"checks and balances are put in place by the said Circular itself"
"to 
regulate 
such  private  practice.  Private  practice 
is  not"
