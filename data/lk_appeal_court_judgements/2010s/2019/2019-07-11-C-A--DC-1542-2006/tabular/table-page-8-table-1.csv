"him  by  Haajiani 
linda  Miskin  whose  name  appears  as 
the  11th  Respondent  in  this"
"application."
"I mus': state that this claim of a prescriptive title appears to be an afterthought. Let me go"
"back  to  the  litigation  where  Haajiani  linda  Miskin  sued  him  in  the  District  Court  of"
"Mount  Lavinia  Case  No.l410/01/Land  for  ejectment  on  the  basis  that  she  had  leased  the"
"land namely a portion of the land T algahawattc where the garage run by the Petitioner had"
"stood  According  to  her  plaint  dated  06.02.2001  in  the  District  Court  of  Mount  Lavinia"
"Case No.1410/01/Land, she averred that she had let the Petitioner a portion of Talgagawatte"
"on  lease  which  terminated  on  01.07.1999. 
ln  other  words,  Mrs.  Miskin  who  claimed"
"owne:ship on a deed over t'1is portion of T algahawatte,  sought to eject the Petitioner from"
"the land for  unlawful possession and non~payment of rent.  In other words the status of"
"Priyankarage  Douglas  Jayaweera  (the  Petitioner)  was  admittedly  a  lessee  under  Mrs."

"Perera 
(the  father  of  the  nih  Defendant~Respondent in  this  application)  and  stated"
"further that the said Andy Perera  had given his brother, one Jayaweera, leave  and license"
"to operate a garage somevvhere in 1956  and the Petitioner began  to help his  brother as  a"
"factotum or a harodyman in the running of the garage."
"After the brother had left the place for  a job in 1966,  the Petitioner averred in his answer"
"that he had been on a lease ;.n  the premises and he sought the relief of a monthly tenant in"
"his cross claim."
"So here was a person who was seeking the status of a tenant. He also alleged that he was"
"a bonafide occupier who was entitled to compensation for improvements."
