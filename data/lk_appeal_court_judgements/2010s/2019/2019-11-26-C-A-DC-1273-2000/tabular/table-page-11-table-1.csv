"In  view of the above,  I hold that the Plaintiff has  failed  to properly establish  her entitlement to"
"the  land  to  be  partitioned  and  that the  chain  of title  laid  down  in  the  plaint  of the  Plaintiff is"
"broken. Thus,  I hold that the learned  District Judge  has  erred  in  entering a judgment in  favour of"
"the Plaintiff without calculating the correct share of entitlement of each  party."
"On  an  appeal  in  a partition  action, if it appears to the  Court of Appeal that the  investigation  of"
"title has been defective, it should set aside the decree and  make an  order for proper investigation"
