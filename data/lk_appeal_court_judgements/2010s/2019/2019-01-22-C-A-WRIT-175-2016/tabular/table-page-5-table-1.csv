According 
to"
"P8―Classification  Ruling  obtained  by  the  petitioner  after  filing"
"this  application  from  the  Deputy  Director  of  Customs  for  the"
"Director General of Customs―the correct HS Code for Thalsukiri"
"is 17029029 and not 17029090.  As seen from P9, the petitioner"
"has  thereafter  imported  a  consignment of  Thalsukiri  under  that"
"HS Code (i.e. 17029029) under Cusdec No.13800.8"
"However,  the  respondents  are  not  prepared  to  accept  that  the"
"correct HS Code for Thalsukiri is 170290299 although they admit"
"that  Nomenclature  Committee  is  the  correct  place  to  refer  to"
"when there is a question of Commodity Classification10, and P8"
"the 
Classification  Ruling  on  Thalsukiri  has  been  given  by"
"Nomenclature  Committee.11    That  means,  at  the  moment  there"
"are  three  HS  Codes  for  Thalsukiri:  (a)  HS  17029090―according"

"the  Deputy  Director  of  Customs 
for  the  Director  General  of"
"Customs.15    It  is  therefore  clear  that  the  correct  HS  Code  for"
"Thalsukiri is yet to be decided.  Hence the impugned order made"
"8 P9 has been tendered with the written submissions of the petitioner dated"
"10.10.2018 with a copy to the Hon. Attorney General as seen from the"
