"The next question is whether the probate obtained by Wilmot Appuhamy in case No.2729"
"in the District Court of Kalutara  was after due publication and whether the said Wilmot"
"Appuhamy acted on the basis of such probate."
"This testamentary case had been filed in 1936 without any publication of the action though"
"the value of the estate was over Rs.500r. This case had been kept in the dark by Wilmot"
"Appuhamy.  No relatives or heirs of Lauren Appuhamy, who purported to have left a last"
"will, were made parties to this case. Wilmot Appuhamy was appointed the executor in the"
"case.  The  probate  obtained  in  such  a  surreptitious  manner  negatived  the  effect  of  the"
"probate.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Wilmot  Appuhamy  ever  acted  on  the  basis  of  this"
"probate."
"If the said Wilmot Appuhamy secured the probate in his name and was the executor of the"
"estate of the deceased Lauren Appuhamy, why he obtained a loan of Rs.800/~ from the said"
"Dona Meraya Siripala Liyanarachchi by P5 is a mystery."
"If the said Deed No.  20006 is held to be valid, the devolution of title to the 4th  Defendant"
"cannot be accepted as  proper. The learned Judge had failed  to consider the enjoyment of"
"the property by Meraya Siripala Liyanarachchi, the mother of the 3rd  Defendant and after"
"her by the 3rd  Defendant.  In my  view  the claim of the  2nd  and  4th Defendants should be"
"dismissed."
"The trial in this case had been over  on 12.10.1998  and written submissions of the parties"
"were filed on 11.12.1998. The judgment has been delivered on 05.05.2000 after about an year"
