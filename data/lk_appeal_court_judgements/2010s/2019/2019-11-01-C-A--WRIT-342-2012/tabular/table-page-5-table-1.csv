"Section SA as amended by Act No 19 of 2011,  which comes up for interpretation"
"on the question whether it is  retrospective in its effect,  goes as follows:"
"SA (1)"
"""No action  shall  be  initiated in terms of section 3 of the principal enactment for  the"
"recovery of any loan  in respect of which default is made,  nor shall any steps be taken in"
"terms  of  section  4 or  section  5 of the  aforesaid Act,  where 
the  principal amount"
"borrowed of such loan is less than rupees five million ......... """
"So  as  of  28.01.2011  when 
the  Recovery  of  Loans  by  Banks  (Special  Provisions)"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No.  1 of  2011  was  certified,  3  types  of  action  or  steps  are"
"prohibited on the part of  banks in respect of a loan when the principal amount"
"borrowed  is less than Rs.5 million."
"1. 
Section 3 action"
"2. 
Section 4 step"
"3. 
Section 5 step"
"All these three  actions or steps that are authorized by the principal enactment"
"namely Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No.4 of 1990 are embargoed"
"by the Amending Act No. 1 of 2011 as amended."
"So  what was  prohibited by the Amendment Acts  in  2011,  when the  principal"
"amount borrowed is less than Rs. 5 million, have to be reemphasized."
"1. 
Section 3 of the principal enactment  Act No.4 of 1990 enables the board"
"of a bank to treat  a borrower as if in default of the entirety of the unpaid"
"portion of the loan in the event he has  defaulted in the  payment of any"
"sum, whether on account of the principal or interest."
"2. 
This deeming  provision  to treat  the borrower as  a defaulter enables the"
"bank to initiate, in its discretion,  action either  in  terms  of section  4  or"
"section 5."
