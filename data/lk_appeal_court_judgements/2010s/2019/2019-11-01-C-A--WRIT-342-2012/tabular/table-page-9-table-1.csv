"fruition and one finds a certificate of sale (X58  dated 20.12.2012) by which the"
"Bank  purchased t he  property at  the auction  and became  its owner. No  doubt"
"the Bank enjoys a vested right of resale of the properties  provided it has acted"
"properly in accordance with the law."
"It is in this factual background that the  Petitioner has raised the quintessential"
"question before  this Court namely whether the Amendment  Act No  01  of  2011"
"applies 
to 
the  facts  and  circumstances  of 
this  case.  Does 
section  5A  of"
"Amendment Act No 01 of 2011 disable a resolution adopted prior to its passage?"
"Is  the  Amendment  Act  retrospective? Could  the  bank  have  acted  upon  the"
"resolution of 17'h June 2003?"
"The learned President's Counsel Mr Kushan de Alwis for the Respondent Bank"
"chose 
to  demonstrate 
that 
the  Amendment  Act  No  01  of  2011  was  not"
"in the Act 
retrospective at all.  He strenuou sly contended that there is nothing"
"that  manifests  an  intention  to  prohibit  and  nullify  the  effect  of  a  previous"
"resolution.  Section 5A  on  the face  of it does  not eventuate in a retrospective"
"effect. The learned President's Counsel cited a judgment of Anil Goonerame J in"
"S.KRahuman  Maulana  v  People's  Bank  (2004)  Volume  1 Hulftsdorp  Law"
"Journal 510  wherein  the  learned Judge  took the view in the Court of Appeal"
"that the Amendment Act No 01 of 2011 does not have a retrospective effect."
"As  I set  out  the  ambit  of  section  5A  before,  the  prohibition  is  only  against"
"passing  a  resolution  after  28th  January  2011,  when 
the  principal  amount"
"borrowed is less than Rs 5 million. Ex facie, there is no prohibition against prior"
"resolutions that have been adopted."
"The crux of  the Amendment Act  No  1 of 2011  as  amended  by Amendment Act"
"No 19  of  2011 
is  that no bank can pass  a resolution  with a view to holding an"
"auction when the prinCipal  amount is less  than Rs 5 million. The Amendment"
"Act  only  nullifies  a post-Amendment resolution  that comes  after  28th January"
"2011  and  it leaves  intact  a  resolution  that  was  adopted  prior  to  28th  January"
