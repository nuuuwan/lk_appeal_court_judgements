"No.23 they say they have prescribed to the land.  What the said"
"Defendants expected from the District Court was not clear."

the 
trial,  on  behalf  of 
these  Defendants,  only 
the  14th"
"Defendant  has  given  evidence.  It  is  significant  to  note  that,  in"
"the  cross  examination,  he  has  admitted  the  Plaintiffâ€™s  pedigree"
"and his title deeds.1"
"Out  of 
the  2nd-6th,  13th  and  14th  Defendants, 
the  2nd-6th"
"Defendants  fell  within  the  pedigree  of  the  Plaintiff,  and  except"
"the  13th  and  14th  Defendants,  the  2nd-6th  Defendants  all  got"
"shares  in  the  Judgment.    The  2nd-6th  Defendants  appear  to  be"
"satisfied with the Judgment as no appeal has been filed against"
"the Judgment.  Only 13th and 14th Defendants filed the appeal."
"Learned Counsel for the 13th and 14th Defendants in his written"
"submission  has  pointed  out  some  minor  defects  in  the 
long"

the  Plaintiff. 
  The  pedigree 
in 
this  case 
is  not"
"straightforward.  Whilst 
accepting 
the 
original 
owners, 
the"
"contesting  Defendants  also  came  out  with  a  different  pedigree."
"When  there  is  a  complex  pedigree  in  a  partition  case,  it  is  not"
"possible to set out  in the plaint  comprehensively, and establish"
"at the trial with a high degree of proof, a perfect pedigree with no"
"defect  whatsoever.    After  a  full  trial,  it  is  easy  to  the  District"
"Judge and the Appellate Court to summarily dismiss the action"
"stating  that  the  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  prove  the  pedigree  by"
"clinging on one or two defects.  That is not justice.  The pedigree"
"in a complicated partition case  shall be understood as a whole,"
"and  minor  defects,  shall,  as 
far  as  possible,  be  reconciled,"
