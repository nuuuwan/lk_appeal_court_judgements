"""It is true that under the common law of eminent domain as recognized in the jurisprudence of all"
"civilized countries, the State cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required"
"for a public purpose and without compensating the owner for its loss."""
"However, it must be noted that the laws which enable expropriation of private property"
"must  be  stated  in  clear  and  unambiguous  terms  and  moreover  must  afford  adequate"
"compensation."
"In view of these well established principles this Court deems it apt that it should exercise"
"its discretionary powers under Article 140 of the Constitution to grant the relief namely a"
"writ of mandamus on the rt Respondent ordering him to perform his duty that is required"
"of him under Section 10 (l) (b ) of the Land Acquisition Act, No.9 of 1950 as amended."
"The Divisional Secretary is directed to give effect to the claims that have been forwarded"
"by the Hon. AG and immediately institute this action in the District Court of Nuwara Eliya"
"to  proceed  with  the  payment  of  compensation  to  the  Petitioners  and  the  3rd  and  4th"
"Respondents."
"In the circumstances, this Court issues a writ of mandamus ordering the 1st Respondent to"
"refer without delay  the  claims  of the  Petitioner and the 3rd  and 4th Respondents  to the"
"District Court of Nuwara Eliya for determination of their rights to compensation."
