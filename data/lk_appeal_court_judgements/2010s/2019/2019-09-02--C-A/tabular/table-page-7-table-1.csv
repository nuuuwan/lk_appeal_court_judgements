"17.","The defence taken  up  by  the Appellant was that,  he had  consensual  sex with"
"","the  complainant.  In  his  statement  from  the  dock  Appellant  said  that,  while"
"","they  were  having  sex,  some  people  had  come  after  a  political  rally.  The"
"","complainant  had  feared  thinking  that  they  were  coming  towards  them  and"
"","that  she  had  run  nude.  This  position,  the  reason  for  the  complainant  to  run"
"","nude  was  never  put  to  the  complainant  when  she  testified  in  Court  by  the"
"","defence.  As  submitted  by  the counsel  for  the  Respondent, if it  happened  the"
"","way Appellant had said, complainant need not have run  without clothes.  She"
"","could  have 
run 
after  getting  clothed. 
If  this  position  was  put 
to 
the"
"","complainant, she could have denied that fact.  The Accused may not have put"
"","this  fact  that  she  had  to  run  nude  because  of the  people  after  the  political"
"","rally  came  to  the  complainant,  because  he  feared  the  truth  might  come  out."
"","The  learned  Trial  Judge  in  the  circumstances  has  rightly  rejected  the  above"
"","version of the defence."
"18.","Counsel  for  the  Appellant  further  submitted  that,  the  productions  were  not"
"","promptly handed over to  the Magistrate 's Court by  the police. There were no"
"","records  of the  dates  of handing over.  As  soon as  the complaint was  made  to"
"","the  police  on  the  same  night,  police  officers  had  gone  to  the  crime  scene"
"","with  the  complainant.  Same  night,  the  complainant  had  shown  the  police"
"","officers from  where she got the  clothes  from  a line  to  cover herself.  Witness"
