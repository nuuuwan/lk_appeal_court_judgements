"07.","As  I observed,  the  Appellant after  changing his jury  option,  there  had  been"
"","postponements  on  7  occasions.  Thereafter, 
trial  also  had  proceeded  on"
"","several  occasions  before  the  Judge.  Appellant on  his  own  had  made  a dock"
"","statement.  Then  counsel  had  made 
final  submissions.  On  none  of those"
"","occasions the Appellant had  informed Court that, he  opted to  be tried by jury"
"","or  that the  non-
jury  option  conveyed  by  the  counsel  was  not  his  decision."
"","Therefore,  it is  clear that when  the  counsel for the Appellant informed Court"
"","about the  change of the  option on  15.02.2010, it was  the  Appellant's  option"
"","that  the  counsel  conveyed  to  Court.  Hence,  the  preliminary  issue  raised  by"
"","the Counsel  for  the Appellant should be dismissed forthwith."
"08.","According 
to 
the  evidence  of the  complainant,  she  had  been  a  married"
"","woman  with  one  child,  separated  from  her  husband. She  had  been  working"
