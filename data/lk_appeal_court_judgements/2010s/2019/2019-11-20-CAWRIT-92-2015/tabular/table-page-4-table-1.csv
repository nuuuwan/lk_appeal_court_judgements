"According 
to 
the 
counter  affidavit  of 
the  petitioner  dated"
"25.01.2018,  Cabinet  approval  for  the  Gazette  marked  X4  has"
"been  obtained  more  than  three  years  after  the  Gazette,  and  no"
"Cabinet  approvals  have  been  obtained  for  Gazettes  marked  X4,"
"X5 and X6."
"However, the petitioner only contests Gazette marked X6 on the"
"ground of  publication without  Cabinet approval.   The petitioner"
"seeks  only 
to  quash  X6  on 
that  basis,  but  not 
the  other"
"(favourable) Gazettes for which no Cabinet approvals have been"
"obtained."
"It appears to me that, with the change  of Government after the"
"Presidential  Election 
on  08.01.2015, 
the  new  Minister 
of"
"Finance, in a hurry, issued X5 Order on 29.01.2015.  After him"
"being  made  to  realize  the  negative  impact  of  that  Order  to  the"
"national economy, he has, in a hurry, within 12 days of issuing"
"that Order, rescinded it, and issued the new Order marked X6."
"If the argument of the petitioner is to be accepted, all the Orders"
"X3-X6 are invalid, as no Cabinet approvals had been obtained to"
"any  of  them  at  the  time  of  publishing  them  in  Gazettes.    Only"
"quashing the Order X6 in isolation is not justifiable.  It will not"
"solve the larger issue."
"It appears that the Cabinet approval has later been obtained for"
"X5 and X6 Orders."
