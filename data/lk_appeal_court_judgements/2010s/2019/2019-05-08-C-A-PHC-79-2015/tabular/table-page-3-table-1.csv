"T
he  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  raises  only  one  point  in"
"appeal.    That  is,  the  learned  Magistrate  has  pronounced  the"
"order  without  calling  for  the  observation  notes  relating  to  this"
"dispute  from  the  police.    According  to  the  journal  entry  dated"
"04.04.2014  of  the  Magistrate’s  Court  case  record,  the  learned"
"Magistrate,  whilst  accepting  counter  affidavits,  on  his  own,  not"
"for any apparent special reason, but, as a matter of course, has"
"called 
for 
“observation  notes” 
from 
the  police. 
  That  order"
"routinely made, has not been pursued, nor such notes have ever"
"been tendered.  Nobody knows whether the police have ever had"
"a  scene  visit  after  the  complaints  were  made  for  them  to  have"
"made  “observation  notes”.    In  my  view,  that  order  calling  for"
"“police  observation  notes” 
is  an  unspecific  and 
irresponsible"
"order.  Thereafter, upon both parties filing written submissions,"
"the learned Magistrate has pronounced the aforesaid order."
"I  observe 
that 
in 
the  written  submissions 
tendered 
to 
the"
"Magistrate’s  Court, 
the  appellants  have  not 
taken  up 
the"
"position  that  without  “police  observation  notes”  being  tendered"
"to Court, the Court cannot make an order or something to that"
"effect.2 Not a word has been mentioned about “police observation"
"notes” in the said written submissions. What the counsel for the"
"appellants 
in 
that  written  submissions  has  stated 
is, 
that,"
"although 
it  was 
incumbent  on 
the  part  of 
the  petitioner-"
"respondents (respondents) to tender an “observation report” (not"
"police  observation  notes)  through  the  respondents’ 
lawyer 
in"
"order  to  prove  breach  of  the  peace,  such  notes  have  not  been"
"produced.3  I emphasize that the counsel for the appellants has"
"2 Vide pages 186-189 of the brief."
"3  Vide last  paragraph  of  page  2  of  the  written  submissions of  the  appellants"
"tendered to the MC which continues to the next page (at pages 187-188 of the"
"brief)."
