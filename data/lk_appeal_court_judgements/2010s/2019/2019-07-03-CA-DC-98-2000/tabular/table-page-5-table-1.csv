"unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real owner"
"and amounted to  a denial of his title  to  the property claimed.  In  order"
"to  constitute  adverse possession,  the possession  must  be  in  denial  of"
"the  title  of the  true  owner.  Where  there  is  no  hostility to  or denial of"
"the  title  of the 
true  owner  there  can  be  no  adverse  possession.  In"
"deciding  whether  the  alleged  acts  of the  person  constitute  adverse"
"possession,  regard  must  be  had  to 
the  animus  of the  person  doing"
"those 
acts, 
and 
this  must  be 
ascertained 
from 
the 
facts 
and"
"circumstances  of each  case  and 
the 
relationship  of the  parties."
"to  be  adverse 
in  case  of a 
Possession  which  may  be  presumed"
"stranger  may  not attract such  a presumption,  in  the  case  of persons"
"standing  in  certain  social  or  legal  relationships.  The  presumption"
"represents  the  most likely  inference  that may be  drawn  in  the  context"
"of the  relationship  of the  parties.  The  Court  will  always  attribute"
