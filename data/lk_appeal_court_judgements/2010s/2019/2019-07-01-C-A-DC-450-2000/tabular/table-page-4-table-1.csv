"has found for the Plaintiff upholding his case that the Defendant had paid him only Rs"
"100,000 and the balance sum of Rs  400,000 was yet outstanding from  the Defendant."
"Thus the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo allowed the claim of the Plaintiff"
"that  Defendant  should pay him  Rs  400,000  together  with interest.  It is  against  this"
