"The Court reproduced the statement of law by Gratiaen J.  in said case"
"where his Lordship pronounced that:"
"""Section  6 
(3)  of  the 
Interpretation  Ordinance  was 
there"
"described  by  as  giving  statutory  recognition 
to 
the  rule  of"
"judicial  interpretation  adopted  in  all  civilised  countries  that"
"the  courts  should  not lightly assume  an  intent on  the  part of"
"Parliament 
to 
introduce 
legislation  prejudicially  affecting"
"vested rights which have already been acquired."""
"The 
real  dispute  among 
the  Petitioner  and  her  siblings 
is 
the"
"succession  rights  over  the  parcel  of  State  land  possessed  by  their  father"
"upon a permit issued under Land Development Ordinance. Chapter VII  of"
"the said Ordinance with  the  title  ""SUCCESSSSION""  governs  the statutory"
"... 
regime  relating  "" 
to  any  land  alienated  on  a permit  or  a holding.""  It  also"
"deals with the entitlement of "" ... a person who is entitled under this  Chapter  to"
"succeed 
to 
the 
land  or  holding  upon 
the  death  of  the  permit  holder  or  owner"
"thereof'."
"Clearly 
these  words,  as 
they  appear 
in  Section  48  of 
the  Land"
"Development  Ordinance,  seem 
to 
reflect 
that  it  had  conferred  certain"
"""vested  rights""  over parties  in  respect of  their succession rights,  upon  the"
"death  of  a  permit holder.  As  such,  even  if  the  position  advanced  by  the"
"Petitioner  that  Rasu  judgment  had  laid  down  the  applicable  procedural"
"law  to  her  application  as  well  and  is  therefore  applicable  to  the  instant"
"application  with 
retrospective 
effect, 
is 
accepted 
as 
a 
legally  valid"
"proposition,  she  is  not  entitled  to  any  relief  since  the  ""vested  rights""  of"
