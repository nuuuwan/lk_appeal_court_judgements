"However,  even if the Petitioner's contention that  the  determination"
"had  in  fact 
laid  down  the  applicable 
by 
the  Supreme  Court  in  Rasu"
"is  not  entitled 
to  any  relief.  The  reasons  for 
this 
procedural 
law,  she"
"conclusion are as set out below."
"The  principle  of  presumption  against  retrospective  legislation  has"
"been  described  by 
the  Supreme  Court  in  the  judgment  of  De  Silva  v"
"Weersinghe  (1979)  1 Sri L.R.  334,  by reproduction of  the relevant portions"
"from  several  authoritative  texts.  The  Supreme Court also  reproduced  the"
"following  segment  of  the  text  from  Craies'  Statute  Law,  7th  Edn.,  p.  387,"
"where it is stated:"
"II A statute  is  to  be  deemed  to  be  retrospective,  which"
"takes away or impairs any vested right acquired under"
"existing laws,  or  creates  a new  obligation,  or  imposes"
"a new  duty,  or  attaches  a new  disability  in  respect  to"
"transactions  or  considerations  already  past.  But  a"
"statute  'is  not  properly  called  a retrospective  statute"
"because a part of the  requisi tes for  its action  is  drawn"
"from  a time antecedent to its passing' . II"
"Their  Lordships  have  quoted  Maxwell  on 
Interpretation  of  Statutes"
"(12 thEdn  at  p.222  )  in order  to  highlight the position that the  presumption"
"has no application to  procedural laws and Rules  of Court as the following"
"portion reproduced from the text reflects:"
