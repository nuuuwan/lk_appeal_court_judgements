"a
nd Regulation 15 of the National Environmental (Procedure for"
"Approval  of  Projects)  Regulations  No.1  of  1993  says  that  it  is"
"mandatory 
that  any  approval 
for  a  prescribed  project  be"
"published  in  the  Gazette  and  three  national  newspapers.    The"
"petitioner 
does  not 
say 
that 
the  National  Environmental"
"Authority did not publish the approved project in three national"
"newspapers.  But  only  complains  of  non-publication 
in 
the"
"Gazette.  This is a technical unintentional breach of a provision"
"of  a  statute  which  has  not  caused  any  prejudice 
to 
the"
"petitioner.    Hence  Court  need  not  quash  the  decision  on  that"
"ground. 
  That  shall  not  be 
taken

that 
the  Court"
"condones such acts on the part of the authorities."
"In  Seneviratne  v.  Urban  Council,  Kegalle6  the  petitioner,  relying"
"heavily  on  Manel  Fernando  v.  Jayaratne7,  sought  to  quash  by"
"certiorari the order of acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act"
"inter  alia  on  the  basis  that  Section  2  Notice  is  bad  in  law  as  it"
"does  not  contain  the  public  purpose. 
  The  counsel 
for  the"
"respondents  convinced  Court  that  the  petitioner  was  aware  of"
"the  public  purpose  for  which  the  land  was  to  be  acquired  long"
"prior  to  the  publication  of  Section  2  Notice  and  therefore  no"
"prejudice was caused to the petitioner on the failure to mention"
"the  pubic  purpose  in  the  Notice.    J.A.N.  de  Silva  J.  (later  C.J.)"
"accepted  the  submission  of  the  counsel  for  the  respondent  and"
"quoted  at  page  108  the  following  passage  on  Judicial  Review  of"
