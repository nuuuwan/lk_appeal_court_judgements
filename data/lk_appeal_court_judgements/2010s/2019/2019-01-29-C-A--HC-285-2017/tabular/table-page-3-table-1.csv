"was ordered to pay Rs.  100,000.00 as compensation to the Prosecutrix with"
"a 
default 
term 
of 
one 
year 
of 
imprisonment. 
The 
sentences 
of"
"imprisonments were ordered to run consecutively by the trial Court."
"Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence,  the  Appellant"
"sought to  challenge its validity on the basis that the trial Court had failed"
"to evaluate the evidence placed before it properly and thereby reaching an"
"erroneous  conclusion as  to  his  guilt.  This  ground  of appeal  was founded"
"on the evidence in relation to 
the injuries that were noted on the genitalia"
"of the Prosecutrix. The Appellant contends that medical evidence does not"
"support an hour-long  sexual  act,  as  she  claims  to  have  taken  place.  It is"
"also  contended  by 
the  Appellant  that 
the  medical  evidence  does  not"
"support  her  claim  of  penetration  and 
the  civil  action  initiated  by  the"
"Prosecutrix  claiming  damages  was  decided  in  his  favour  by  the  Civil"
"Appellate High Court."
"The  evidence  presented  by 
the  prosecution 
through  Priyanganie"
"revealed that she used to leave home at about 5.45 a.m.  to work and had to"
"traverse  through a  lonely  pathway passing  Ketawala  Handiya  to  reach  the"
"main  road  to  catch  the  6.15  bus.  On  7th  November  2007,  she  was  on her"
"way  to  work  and  the  Appellant,  who  is  a  fellow  villager  and  therefore  a"
"well-known  person,  has  dragged  her  near  the  stream  and  had  sexually"
"penetrated  her.  Although  she  raised  cries, 
there  were  no  houses  in  the"
"vicinity.  After  the  act of sexual  aggression,  the  Appellant had  threatened"
"her to  go to work."
