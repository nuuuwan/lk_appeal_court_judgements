"The  Petitioners-Appellants (Appellants) filed the above styled application in the High Court of the"
"Uva  Province  holden 
in  Badulla  and  sought  a  writ  of  mandamus  directing  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Respondents-Respondents  (1st  and  2nd  Respondents)  to  issue  a  license  for  a  club  in  favour  of"
"Badulla  Sports  Club  for the years  2007  and  2008.  The  club  was  situated  at  No.9  Race  Course"
"Road,  Badulla."
"During the  pendency  of this  application  steps  were  taken  under the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of"
"Possession)  Act  No.7 of  1979  as  amended  to  take  over  possession  of the  land  on  which  the"
"clubhouse was situated.  The learned High Court Judge held that since possession of the land was"
"taken  over it was futile to issue  a writ of mandamus as  prayed for in  the petition and  dismissed"
"the application without costs.  Hence this appeal."
"The  learned  President's Counsel  for the Appellant submitted that the learned  High  Court Judge"
"erred  in  dismissing the application on the grounds of futility as  the rights of the parties must be"
"determined as  at the date of institution of proceedings."
"Rights of the Parties"
"The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant was correct in submitting that there is a general"
"principle  that  the  rights  of  the  parties  must  be  determined  as  at  the  date  of  institution  of"
"proceedings  or action.  [Ponnammah  v.  Arumugam  (8  N.L.R.  223  at  226),  Silva  v.  Nona  Hamine"
