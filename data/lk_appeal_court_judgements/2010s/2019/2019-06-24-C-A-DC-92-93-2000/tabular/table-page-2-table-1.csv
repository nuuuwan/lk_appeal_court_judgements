"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The plaintiff instituted this action to partition the land described in"
"the schedule to the plaint.  Several parties have intervened pending"
"action. 
  After 
trial 
the 
learned  District  Judge  delivered 
the"
"Judgment partitioning the land among the plaintiff, the 1st and 2nd"
"defendants  and  some  others  who  are  not  parties  to  the  action."
"Being  dissatisfied  with  the  Judgment,  the  2A  defendant  and  3rd"
"defendant  have  preferred  appeals. 
  The  3rd  defendant  did  not"
"pursue the appeal, and there remains to consider the appeal of the"
"2A defendant."
"The  2nd  defendant  did  not  give  evidence  at  the  trial.    The  pivotal"
"argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  2A  defendant  is  that  the"
"land  to  be  partitioned  was  already  amicably  partitioned  by  Plan"
"marked  1D5  prepared  in  1963  and Deed  of  Partition  marked  1D6"
"executed 
in  1964,  and  accordingly,  the  2nd  defendant  became"
"entitled to Lot 1, the plaintiff to Lot 2, and the 1st defendant to Lot"
"3 in the said Plan, and those Lots were thereafter registered at the"
"Land Registry as separate Lots, and therefore, the partition action"
"should  have  been  dismissed  or  Lot  1  should  have  been  excluded"
"from the corpus."
"This argument is unacceptable on two grounds.  One is, all the co-"
"owners  had  not  been  parties  to  the  amicable  partition,  and  the"
"other is, after the amicable partition, admittedly, the 2nd defendant"
"has  executed  Deeds  alienating  undivided  rights  from  the  land  to"
"several  others  including  the  plaintiff  and  the  4th  defendant.    The"
"2nd  defendant,  by  raising  issue  Nos.  30  and  31,  whilst  accepting"
"execution  of 
two  Deeds 
in 
favour  of  the  plaintiff  and  the  4th"
"defendant, has taken up the position that, at the time of execution,"
"he  did  not  have 
title 
to 
the  said 
land! 
  Execution  of  Deeds"
