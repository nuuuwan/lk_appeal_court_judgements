"nullity.  In fact Lord Denning in the Privy Council in McFoy v United Africa Company"
"(1961)  3 AER 1169 stated at p 1172"
"If an act in law is void, then it is in law a nullity. .... Ther 
is no need for an order of the court to"
"set  it  aside. It  is  automatically  null  and  void  without  much  ado, 
though  it  is  sometimes"
"convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding which is founded on it is"
"also bad and incurably' bad. You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It"
"will collapse."
