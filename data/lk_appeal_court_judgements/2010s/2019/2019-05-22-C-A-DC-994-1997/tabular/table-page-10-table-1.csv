"So when Mr Sarath Bandara appeared in Court on IS.  ' 7.1996  and stated that he had no"
"instructions, that amounted to  Plaintiff's  appearance and there was no  default on the"
"part of the Plaintiff. This is the view that prevails now but there was quite an uncertainty"
"about it at one time.  Whether the proceedings 
should be inter partes  or ex parte  in the"
"context of a defendant when his Attorney stated to Court ""he had no instructions"" came"
"IS  N.L.R 36 and he took the view that 
up before Middleton J in Senanayake v Cooray"
"in such circumstances th  proceedings would be ex parte."
"On the day fixed for  the trial, the defendant in the case was absent and his proctor on"
","
"record, who was  presen~ in court, stated he had no  instructions.  It was held that the"
"physical presence of the proctor in the Court, coupled with what he said on the trial day,"
"I"
"did not constitute an appearance for the defendant,  which would give the proceedings"
"the character of an inter partes  trial enabling the judge to enter a final decree."
"But  a four  bench division  of the  Supreme Court in Andiappa Chettiar v Sanmugam"
"33  N.L.R  217  reached  judicial  consensus 
Chettiar 
that  when  an  Attorney~at~law"
"intimated to Court that he had no instructions, that would be tantamount to appearance"
"of the party and therefore there cannot be recourse to 0 hapter 12 of the Code."
"In Andiappa Chettiar vs~  Sanmugam Chettiar (supra)  Macdonell C.J heading a bench"
"of four judges of the Supreme Court (with Garvin S.P.].,  Lyall Grant J.,  and Maartensz"
"A.J  ) held that the presel1ce in Court, when a case is ca  ed, of the Proctor on th~ record"
"constitutes an appearance for the party from whom the proctor holds the proxy, unless"
"ot, on that occasion, appear for 
the proctor expressly informs the Court that he does"
"the party."
"Macdonell. C.J was quite 'emphatic"
