"A
rticle 140 does not make a distinction between mandamus and"
"other prerogative writs, and nowhere in that Article does it state"
"that  mandamus  can  only  be  issued  against  a  natural  person."
"According to Article 140, mandamus, like any other prerogative"
"writ,  can  be 
issued  “against  the 
judge  of  any  Court  of  First"
"Instance  or  tribunal  or  other 
institution  or  any  other  person”."
"Similarly,  Rule 
5 
does 
not  make 
a 
distinction 
between"
"mandamus and other writs, and does not state that mandamus"
"can only be issued against a natural person."
"In summary, what Rule 5(2) says is that in the caption of such a"
"writ  application 
the  public  officer  can  be  cited  by  official"
"designation only and not by name; and if necessary, for clarity,"
"his name can be disclosed in the body of the petition. 5(3) says"
"that  no  application  shall  be  dismissed  due  to  misdescription  of"
"such public officer―it is a curable defect. 5(4) says that if such a"
"public officer has ceased to hold office (a) at the time of filing the"
"application, (b) during the pendency of such application and (c)"
"after  the  delivery  of  the  order  but  before  complying  with  it,  the"
"same  can  be  filed  and  proceeded  with  against  his  successor  by"
"official designation."
"Dayaratne  v.  Rajitha  Senaratne23  may  be  the  first  case  Rule  5"

"names  and  official  designations.    Pending  determination  of  the"
