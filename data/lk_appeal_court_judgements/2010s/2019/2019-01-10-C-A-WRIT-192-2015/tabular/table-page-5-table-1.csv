"v
arious,  in  my  view,  false  reasons.    For  instance,  by  P7  dated"
"25.04.2008,  the  9th  respondent  has  turned  down  the  request"
"merely stating that the 3rd respondent does not recommend that"
"request  whereas  such  a  recommendation  is  not  required  in  law"
"for 
that  purpose. 
  Then  by  P12  dated  16.09.2008, 
the  9th"
"respondent  has  refused  the  request  stating  that,  according  to"
"the 3rd respondent,  the buildings of the school were being used"
"to 
run 
primary 
section 
of 
some 
other 
school, 
namely,"
"G/Aththiligoda Sudarshi School and the land was being used to"
"conduct  practical  tests  of  the  agriculture  subject  of  the  said"
"school.    This  is  undoubtedly  a  falsehood  as  seen  from  a  large"
"number  of  documents  tendered  by  the  petitioner  including  P16"
"dated  05.03.2013  whereby 
the  1st  respondent  has  candidly"
"admitted  that  the  school  was  closed  and  abandoned  for  several"
"years.    Then  by  P15  dated  05.02.2013,  the  3rd  respondent  has"
"informed the 9th respondent that the said premises were needed"
"to  commence  a  Teacher  Training  Center. 
  The  9th  and  10th"
"respondents,  in  paragraph  7  of  their  statement  of  objections,"
"admit  that  “the  proposal  to  construct  a  Teacher  Training  Centre"
"did not get off the ground”.  The petitioner in paragraphs 30 and"
"31 of the petition states that thereafter the authorities attempted"
"to hand over the premises to the Medical Faculty of the Ruhuna"
"University  and  then  the  petitioner  wrote  P18  dated  26.05.2014"
"to  the  2nd  respondent  protesting  that  move  and  insisting  on"
"divesting.    This  has  not  been  disputed  by  the  respondents  as"
"falsehood. 
 
It 
is 
in 
this  backdrop, 
the  petitioner 
filed 
this"
"application on 29.04.2015."
