"The  petitioner―the  Methodist  Trust  Association  of  Ceylon―filed"
"this  application  seeking  to  issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  directing"
"the 
respondents 
to  make  a  divesting  order  of 
the  Maitipe"
"Methodist  Mixed  School,  Galle,  which  was  vested  in  the  Crown"
"by the Gazette marked P3 in 1963."
"Only the 2nd, 4th, 9th and 10th respondents filed objections to this"
"application.    These  respondents  do  not  dispute  that  the  said"
"school has ceased to function as a school since 2003.  According"
"to  2R1  dated  30.10.2015,  the  2nd  respondent  admits  that  the"
"said  school  is  now  closed.    Therefore,  there  is  no  necessity  to"
"scrutinize 
the 
large  number  of  documents 
tendered  by 
the"
"petitioner together with the petition to prove the said fact."
"The letter P16 issued by the 1st respondent and the photographs"
"P10(a)-(e)  alone  are  more 
than  sufficient 
to  understand 
the"
"present  status  of  the  buildings  of  the  school.    They  are  in  a"
"shocking state of dilapidation as a result of nearly one and a half"
"decades of disuse!"
"Once the petitioner  has come to know that the  school is closed"
"and  abandoned, 
the  petitioner  has  made 
repeated 
fervent"
"written  requests  to  divest  the  school  to  the  original  owner―the"
"Methodist  Church  of  Sri  Lanka.1    These  requests  have  either"
"been put into the waste paper basket or  turned down by  giving"
"1 Vide P4 dated 12.03.2008, P8(a) dated 15.05.2008, P10 dated 06.08.2008,"
"P13(a) dated 30.09.2008, P14(a) dated 21.02.2012, P14(b) dated 14.05.2012,"
"P17(a) dated 08.07.2013, P17(b) dated 08.07.2013, P17(c) dated 22.08.2013,"
