"application. 
  When 
this  matter  was 
raised  as  a 
inter  alia"
"preliminary  objection,  the  petitioner  relied  on  Rule  5(4)(b)  read"
"with  5(5)  to  argue  that  the  application  can  be  proceeded  with"
"against  their  successors  for  the  time  being  in  office  without"
"addition or substitution.  This argument was rightly rejected by"
"Marsoof  J.  as  the  President  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  (with  Sri"
"Skandarajah J. agreeing) on the basis that Rule 5(4)(b) read with"
"5(5)  was  inapplicable  in  this  instance  as  this  was  a  case  filed"
"against the public officers both by name and designation, and as"
"such,  for  the  said  Rules  to  be  applicable,  the  case  should  have"
"been 
filed  before  the  specified  date  nominated  by  the  Chief"
"Justice, which, in this instance, was 31.12.199124, but this case"
"had been filed long after the said specified date. That finding is"
"in  complete  consonance  with  Rule  5. 
  Rule  5  applies 
in"
"applications  where  a  public  officer  is  made  a  respondent  in  his"
"official designations  only and not by name.   The only exception"
"is  Rule  5(5)  which  is  applicable  only  in  respect  of  applications"
"filed  before  31.12.1991. 
  The  reference  to  Haniffaâ€™s  case  by"
"Marsoof J.25 is clearly obiter dicta.  This Judgment of Marsoof J."
"is not an authority to say that writ of mandamus is an exception"
"to Rule 5."
"It is a myth that mandamus can only be issued against natural"
"persons.    Mandamus,  like  any  other  prerogative  writ,  can  be"
"issued against natural, juristic or non-juristic persons including"
"tribunals,  corporations,  public  bodies,  public  officials  identified"
