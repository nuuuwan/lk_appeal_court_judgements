"“Where  officials  having  a  public  duty  to  perform,  refuse  to"
"perform it, mandamus will lie on the application of a person"
"interested  to  compel  them  to  do  so.  The  rule  would  also"
"apply  where  a  public  body  fails  to  perform  a  public  duty"
"with which it is charged.”……"
"Apart  from  this,  the  petitioners  presented  their  petition  on"
"the  basis  that  the  respondents  are  the  persons  who  are"
"entrusted with the duty of carrying out the obligation which"
"was 
reposed 
in 
the  University, 
to  hold 
the  2nd  MBBS"
"examination  for  them  only.  At  the  time  they  were  made"
"respondents, 
the  1st  respondent  held 
the  office  of  Vice"
"Chancellor  by  virtue  of  an  appointment  made  by 
the"
"Chancellor,  and  the  2nd  respondent  held  the  office  of  Dean"
"of  the  Faculty  of  Medicine,  by  virtue  of  her  election  by  the"
"Faculty  (Sections  34  (1)  and  49  (1)  of  the  University  Act)."
"Under  the  Emergency  Regulation,  they  cease  to  hold  their"
"respective office. The 1st respondent now holds the office of"
"Vice  Chancellor  on  an  appointment  made  by  the  Minister"
"(Reg. 3(2); the 2nd respondent now holds office as Dean on"
"an  appointment  made  by  the  Vice  Chancellor.  It  is  now"
"sought  to  compel  the  1st  respondent  to  perform  a  duty  on"
"the  basis 
that  he  has,  by  reason  of  Regulation  4 
(a),"
"absorbed 
in  himself  all 
the  powers  and  duties  of 
the"
"University.  Would  not  all  these  result  in  a  change  in  the"
"character of the petition and in the conversion of the original"
"petition 
into  a  petition  of  another  kind?  What 
if 
the"
"regulations are withdrawn tomorrow? Then the argument of"
"learned 
Counsel 
for 
the 
petitioners, 
based 
on 
the"
"Emergency Regulations, loses its validity."
