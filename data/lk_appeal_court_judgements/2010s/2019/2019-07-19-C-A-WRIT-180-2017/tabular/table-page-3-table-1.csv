"P11  with this application, to take steps under sections 32  and  33  of the Act,  against the"
"Petitioner by way of writ of certiorari."
"The 
learned  State  Counsel 
raised 
two  preliminary  matters 
to 
the  maintainability  of  the"
"application."
"Firstly, 
it  was  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  was  guilty  of  lashes 
in 
that  P8  was 
issued  on"
"31.10.2016 whereas he accepted P8 and came to court after 10 months of its issue. The question"
"of delay depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. As more fully explained below, the"
"imposition  of the four conditions  in  P8  is  ultra  vires  the  powers  of the  1st  Respondent.  Hence"
"there  is  a  patent  lack  of jurisdiction  on  the  part  of the  1st  Respondent  to  impose  the  four"
"conditions 
in  P8  and  as  such  acquiescence  on 
the  part  of  the  Petitioner  does  not  confer"
"jurisdiction  on  the  1st  Respondent  [Beatrice  Perera  v.  Commissioner  of National  Housing  (77"
"N.L.R.361)]."
"Secondly,  it  was  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  is  guilty  of  suppression/misrepresentation  of"
"material 
facts.  The  material 
fact  alleged 
to  have  been  suppressed/misrepresented 
is 
the"
"purported statement by the counsel for the Petitioner on 25.01.2019 that the Petitioner has filled"
"the entire portion of land belonging to the Petitioner. This in  my view is not a material fact."
"Quashing 0/ Conditions in PB"
"The  Respondents  contend  that  P8 
is  a forged  document  [paragraph  10  of the  statement  of"
"objections] and  rely on  documents R6  and  R6A to establish  it. However, R6  is a letter written by"
"the 1st  Respondent to the  Director of the Criminal  Investigation  Department requesting  him  to"
"initiate  an 
investigation  into  certain  irregularities  that  have  occurred  in  the  issue  of  letters"
"authorising paddy land  to be  utilised for other purposes and  determinations that certain  lands"
"are  not paddy lands.  It is  general  in  nature and  has  no specific application to P8.  R6A  is  a letter"
"written  by  the  1st  Respondent  to the  2nd  Respondent  indicating  that  P8  has  not  been  issued"
