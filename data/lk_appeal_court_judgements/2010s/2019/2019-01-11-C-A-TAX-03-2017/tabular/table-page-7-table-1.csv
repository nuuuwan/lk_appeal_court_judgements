"Accordingly,  I hold  that it is  open for this Court to consider questions of law other than  what is"
"set out in the case stated. However, I wish to state that such a course of action is permissible only"
"if the answers to the new questions of law may result in the confirmation, reduction, increasing"
"or annulling the assessment determined by the Commission, or requires the remitting of the case"
"to the TAC with the opinion of the Court. Questions of law which are purely of academic interest"
"cannot be  raised  [Navaratnam v. Commissioner of Income Tax (Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases,  Vol."
"I,  page 378 at 381)]. The same test applies to the to questions of law to be formulated by the TAC"
"for reference to this Court."
