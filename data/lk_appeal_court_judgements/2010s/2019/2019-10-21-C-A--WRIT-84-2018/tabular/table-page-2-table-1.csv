"","When  this  matter was  taken  up  for argument  on  1 ih May  2019,  the  learned"
"","Counsel  for the  parties  moved  that this  Court  pronounce  its judgment on  the"
"","written submissions that have already been tendered by the parties."
"","The  Petitioner  has  filed  th is application  seeking  a  Writ  of Certiorari  to  quash"
"","the  decision  of the  Sri  Lanka  Customs  by  which  Sri  Lanka  Customs,  after  an"
"","inquiry,  rejected  the  value  declared  by  the  Petitioner for the goods  imported"
"","by  it  and,  imposed  a forfeiture  in  a  sum  of  Rs  25  million.  The  question  that"

the  duty  was  assessed ."
"","Factual  deviations from this price were only fully taken into account where the"
"","declared  value  was  higher  than  the  listed  value.  Downward  variations  were"
"","only  taken 
into  account  up  to  10 per  cent.  This  method  caused  widespread"
