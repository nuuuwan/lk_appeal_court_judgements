"However, the reasoning must be  understood in the context of the specific provision in section 49"
"of the Inland Revenue Act No.4 of 1963 which reads  as follows:"
"""An executor of a deceased  person shall  be  liable, to do all  such  acts,  matters and things"
"as  such  deceased  person  would  be  liable to do  under this Act if he  were  alive,  and  shall"
"be  chargeable with income tax,  wealth tax or gifts tax with which  such  deceased  person"
"would be chargeable if he were alive in respect of all  periods prior to the date of the death"
"of stack person"" ."
