"In  appeal  this court held that the imposition of vicarious liability under a statute is  not lightly to"
"be  presumed and  such  liability must necessarily be  imposed in  clear and  unambiguous language"
"and that there is no provision in the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 which makes the principal"
"officer  liable  for tax  due  from  the  company  and  that  he  is  not liable  to  pay  from  his  personal"
"assets.  Hence  this  decision  is  also  based  on  facts  similar  to  the  facts  in  M.E.  De  Silva  v.  The"
"Commissioner of Income Tax (supra)."
