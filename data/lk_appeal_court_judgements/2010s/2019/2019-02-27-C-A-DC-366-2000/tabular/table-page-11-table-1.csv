"opinion  that  departures  have 
indeed  been  permitted  having  regard  to  the  facts  and"
"circumstances of a particular case."
"Are  there facts  and circumstances in this case that warrant such a departure in the case?"
"The Plaintiff himself conceded under cross-examination that his tutor was Rev. Kapugama"
"Seelawansa  Thera.  The  tutor had  three  pupils.  One  was  Kebaliyapola  Somaratna Thero"
"who  was 
residing 
at  Kadawedduwa  Thun  Bodhi  Vihara.  The 
other  pupil  was"
"Kadawedduwa  Premaratna Thero  and the  third pupil was  the Plaintiff.  In the course  of"
"further  cross-examination  the  Plaintiff also  admitted that Kapugama  Seelawansa  Thera"

"But it is noteworthy that none of the other pupils have claimed the Viharadhipathiship by"

"cannot  go  searching  for  senior  pupils  when  their  exact  whereabouts  and  even 
their"
"identities have not been established with certainty. No doubt the rule that a senior pupil"
"to  prevent 
must  succeed  his  tutor  enjoys  its  eternal  value  but  it  is  not  inflexible  as"
