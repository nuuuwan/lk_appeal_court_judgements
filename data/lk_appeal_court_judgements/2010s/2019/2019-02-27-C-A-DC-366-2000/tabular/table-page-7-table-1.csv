"So  a Viharadhipathi enjoys  locus  standi to institute an  action for  a declaration but did the"
"Plaintiff in  this  case  have  that  right  invested  in  him?  This  issue  has  to  be  necessarily"
"resolved having regard to the admission recorded at the trial namely the chief incumbency"
"of the subject~matter is  decided on the rule of pupillary succession based on Sisyanu Sisya"
"Paramparawa. What are the rules of SisyanuSisyaParamparawa that govern incumbency?"
"The learned President's Counsel Mr. S.c.B. Walgampaya for the Defendant contended that"
"as the Plaintiff was not the senior pupil of Rev. Kapugama Seelawansa, no right inhered in"
"him to seek a declaration as the Viharadhipathi of the Bomure Vihara.  On the other hand"
"Mr.  Champ aka  Ladduwahetty countered this contention by putting forward  the stance"
"that it is  sufficient for  the Plaintiff to have  been a pupil of the previous incumbent.  His"
"argument was that the Plaintiff himself did not claim that he was the senior most pupil of"
"Rev.  Kapugama Seelawansa.  A reference was made to paragraph 4 of the amended Plaint"
"wherein the Plaintiff had not asserted such seniority.  Mr.  Ladduwahetty argued that the"
"original  Plaintiff  was  a  pupil  of  Rev.  Kapugama  Seelawansa  Thero  and  he  thereafter"
"succeeded to  the Viharadhipathiship  after  the demise  of  the then incumbent Kapugama"
"Seelawansa."
"If one goes back to paragraph 4 of the plaint again, there is an averment which states that"
"the Plaintiff continued to date to hold the office  of Viharadhipathiship,  which gave  him"
"sufficient locus standi to institute the action. This was the answer that was proffered to this"
"Court when the President's Counsel raised the incapacity of the Plaintiff to institute this"
"action  on  the basis  that the  Plaintiff was not the oldest pupil of Kapugama  Seelawansa"
"Thero. Though Mr. Ladduwahetty argued that the incapacity or lack of locus  standi  of the"
"Plaintiff was not raised in the issues, Issue No.2 which was raised by the Plaintiff himself"
"engages the same question namely: ""Has the Viharadhiapthiship devolved on the Plaintiff as pleaded"
"in the plaint and the pedigree annexed thereto?""  This question has been answered by the learned"
"District Judge in the affirmative."
"The answer to that question, as I pointed out before, depends on whether the Plaintiff has"
"established that he succeeded to the Viharadhipathiship  of Bomure Viharya  according to"
