"succession continues in  that manner  as  long  as  each  succeeding Viharadhpathi leaves  a"
"pupil or pupils. In  the  Supreme  Court decision in  Dhammajoti Unnanse  v.  Paranatale"
"(1881) 4 SCC 121, Justice Harry Dias said:-"
"""Sisyanu Sisya Paramparawa means ""pupillary succession"" or ""succession from pupil to pupil"". The"
"second word ""anu"" means ""each by each"" or ""orderly"" and the effect of that word seems to limit the"
"succession to  the descending line to the exclusion of both the ascending and the collateral lines. We"
"see that, according to the strict grammatical meaning of the words Sisyanu Sisya Paramparawa, the"
"line of succession is limited to pupils of the descending line""."
