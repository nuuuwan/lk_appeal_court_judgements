"pupillary succession.  But I think the case is different where the tutor abandons his"
"rights to an incumbency. Disrobing, with the intention of giving up the priesthood,"
"is  the  equivalent,  ecclesiastically,  of  personal  demise,  and  it  does  not  entail,  any"
"more than death entails, an abandonment of rights, but merely a personal incapacity"
"to exercise there. These rights can accordingly descend to a pupillary successor. The"
"abandonment of an incumbency by a priest, on the other hand,  constitutes the forfeiture of that to"
"which his pupil's rights of succession are attached, namely the incumbency itself The priest remains"
"a priest, but abandons  his rights  to the incumbency, upon which the pupillary rights  to  succession"
"are dependent. There accordingly remain no rights for the pupil to inherit."""
