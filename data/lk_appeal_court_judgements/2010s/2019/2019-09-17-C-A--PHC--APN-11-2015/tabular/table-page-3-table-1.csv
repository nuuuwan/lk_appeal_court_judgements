"t
he Intervenient Party was in possession of the premises in suit."
"By that Notice to Quit the Petitioner has asked the Intervenient"
"Party  to  handover  the  peaceful  possession  of  that  premises"
"immediately."
"That itself shows that the case of the  Petitioner as presented in"
"the  petition  that,  on  10.02.2013  the  Intervenient  Party  vacated"
"the  leased  premises  in  suit,  and  thereafter  on  02.03.2013,  i.e."
"two  days  after 
the  expiration  of 
the  Lease  Agreement 
the"
"Intervenient 
Party 
attempted 
to 
re-enter 
the 
premises 
is"
"incorrect.    Simply  stated,  if  the  Intervenient  Party  had  vacated"
"the  premises  on  10.02.2013,  there  was  no  necessity  for  the"
"Petitioner  to  send  a  Notice  to  Quit  on  02.03.2013  asking  the"
"Intervenient  Party  to  handover  the  possession  of  the  premises"
"forthwith."
"The 
fact  that,  by  02.03.2013,  the 
Intervenient  Party  was 
in"
"possession is made clear by the complaint of the Petitioner made"
"to  the  Police  on  02.03.2013  (found  at  page  278  of  X).    In  that"
"Police  complaint  the  Petitioner  has  inter  alia  admitted  that  (a)"
"the  keys  of  the  premises  in  suit  are  with  the  Intervenient Party"
"and (b) the Intervenient Party has employed a watcher to protect"
"that premises and (c) the Petitioner never tried to enter into the"
"said  premises; 
(d)  nevertheless, 
for  his  protection,  he 
(the"
"Petitioner) padlocked the common gate, which gives access both"
"to the premises in suit and his house (which abuts the premises"
"in suit)."
"It is common ground that the Petitioner was in possession of the"
"premises  in  suit  on  the  date  the  information  was  filed  by  the"
"Police in Court."
