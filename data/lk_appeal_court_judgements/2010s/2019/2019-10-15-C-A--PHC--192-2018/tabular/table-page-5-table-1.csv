"The  prima facie test requires  the  Court to consider whether the Petitioner does  have  a right  of"
"appeal against the impugned order refusing notice."
"Article 154P (6)  of the Constitution  read s:"
"""Subject to the provisions of the Constitution ond any law, any persan aggrieved by a final"
"order, judgement or sentence of any such Court,  in  the exercise of its jurisdiction under"
"paragraphs  (3)(b)  or  (3)(c)  or  (4)  may appeal  there  from 
to  the  Court  of Appeal  in"
"accordance with Article 138"""
"Thus,  the  right  of appeal  conferred  by  this  constitutional  provision 
is  only  in  respect  of final"
"orders, judgments or sentences imposed by a Provincial High  Court exercising either its appellate"
"or revisionary jurisdiction. The question therefore is  whether the order of the learned High Court"
"Judge of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle dated 26.09.2018 is a final order, entitling"
"the Petitioner to invoke the appellate jurisdiction  of this Court  relying on  Article  154P  (6)  of the"
"Constitution."
"In  Sri  Lanka,  the  method  of  determining  whether  an  order  of a civil  court  is  a final  order  or"
"interlocutory order had  given  rise to two conflicting strands of judicial opinion. In Siriwardena  v."
"[(1984)  1 Sri  L.R.  286]  the  Supreme  Court  adopted  a test  known  as  the  'order 
Air  Ceylon  Ltd."
"approach' to answer this question . In essence, the test was whether the order of the Court finally"
"disposed of the rights of the parties. If an  order did so,  it could  be  regarded  as  a final order. The"
"rival strand of authority adopted a test known  as the 'application approach'."
"This approach  is  succinctly  explained  in  the  following judicial  statements  made  in  Salaman  v."
"Warner [(1891) Q.B.  734]:"
"""/ think that the true definition is  this.  I conceive that an order is 'tinal"" only where it is"
"made upon an application or ather proceeding which must, whether such application or"
"other praceeding fail or succeed, determine the action,  Conversely I think that an order"
"is  ""interlocutory""  where it cannot be affirmed that in  either event the  action  will be"
"determined. """
"The  application  approach  which  was  initially  adopted  by  a three-judge  bench  of the  Supreme"
"Court 
[(1998)  3  Sri  L.R.  232],  has  su bsequently  been 
followed 
in 
in  Ranjit  v  Kusumawathie"
"S.R.  Chettiar vs.  S.N.  Chettiar [(2011)  2 SLR  70]  (5  judge bench)  and  Sc.  Appeal  No.  41/2015 and"
