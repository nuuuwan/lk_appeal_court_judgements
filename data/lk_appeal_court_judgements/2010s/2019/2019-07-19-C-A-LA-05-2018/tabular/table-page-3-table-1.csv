"Appeal in terms of Section 62(1) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No.l3 of 1951 as"
"amended read with Rule 4  of the 5th  Schedule of the said Act.  Upon this matter being"
"supported in this Court on 03.09.2018, this Court issued notice of this application on the"
"Respondent and an interim order staying the operation of the order made by Board of"
"~uazjs was also issued."
"Subsequendy, this matter was argued before this Court for Leave to be granted and I find"
"that the grounds that have been urged in the application for  Leave  to Appeal have not"
"been fully argued before the Board of ~uazis. The Board of ~uazjs has only issued notice on"
"the Respondent and they are yet to hear the merit of the Appeal that has been preferred"
"to them against the order of the learned ~uazj of Colombo North.  In other words, such"
"grounds as the absence of the signature of the Respondent in the application she made to"
"the ~uazi and the legality or otherwise of the ex~parte order made by the ~uazj are yet to"
"be tested in the Board of ~uazjs."
"When the first tier Appellate forum has not yet exercised its jurisdiction, it is an abuse of"
"process to vex this Court with the same grounds of Appeal on which hearing is yet to"
"take place in the Board of ~uazis."
