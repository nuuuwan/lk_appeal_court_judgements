"t
o  the  facts  of  this  case  where  two  deeds  3170  and  3171  were"
"executed  by  the  same  Notary,  at  the  same  time,  one  after  the"
"other."
"In the facts of this case, the intention of Mabel was clear.  That"
"was to donate the eastern portion of Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta"
"by deed No.3170 to Sriyalatha subject to a right of way of 8 feet"
"wide along the northern boundary of the eastern part thereof to"
"have access to  Modarayawatta  to the  benefit of both Sriyalatha"
"and  Thilakadasa. 
  This  has  been  accepted  by  Sriyalatha  by"
"subsequent conduct."
"In  my  view,  although  the 
intention  of  Mabel  was  clear,  the"
"mistake  has  been  done  by  the  Notary.    He  should  have  first"
"executed  deed  No.3171  and  then  3170.    Had  that  been  done,"
"there  would  not  have  been  any  room 
for  argument, 
for  the"
"reason 
that,  as 
the  owner  of 
the  eastern  part  of  Lot  1  of"
"Eramudugahawatta,  Mebel,  without  any  difficulty,  could  have"
"granted  a  right  of  way  to  Sriyalatha  and  Thilakadasa  along  the"
"northern 
boundary 
of 
the 
eastern 
part 
of 
Lot 
1 
of"
"Eramudugahawatta to have access to Modarayawatta."
"At 
that 
time, 
that  would  not  have  been  an 
issue 
to 
the"
"defendants,  as  they  were  also  using  the  same  right  of  way  by"
"virtue of the right given to them by deed No.997 to have access"
"to the western portion of Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta."
