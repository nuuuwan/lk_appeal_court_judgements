"S
amayawardhena, J."
"The petitioner filed this writ application on 08.12.2017 basically"
"challenging 
the 
decision 
of 
the  Securities 
and  Exchange"
"Commission of Sri Lanka to initiate legal proceedings against the"
"petitioner under the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri"
"Lanka  Act,  No.  36  of  1987,  as  amended. 
  However 
the"
"application  was  supported  only  yesterday  for  interim  relief  and"
"notice as adjusting the matter outside the Court  was failed and"
"“the  petitioner  has 
received  summons 
in  MC  Fort  Case  No."
"12639/19 to appear before the said Court on the 28th March 2019"
"in respect of this matter.”1"
"As 
legal  proceedings  have  now  been 
initiated, 
the 
learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  supported  for  the  interim"
"relief 
preventing 
the 
Securities 
and 
Exchange"
"Commission/learned Magistrate from proceeding with that  case"
"until final determination of this application.  The learned Senior"
"State  Counsel 
for 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission"
"vehemently  objects  for  granting  interim  relief  and  also  notice"
"being issued on the substantive application."
"The  principal  argument  of  the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  is"
"that no writ lies against the substantive reliefs sought for by the"
"petitioner in the prayer to the petition."
"Conversely, the argument of the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the petitioner is mainly two-fold."
