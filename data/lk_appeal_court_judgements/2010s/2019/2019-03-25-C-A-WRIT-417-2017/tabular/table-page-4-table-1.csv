"C
an 
this  Court  compel 
the  Commission 
to  compound 
the"
"matter?    I  think  not.    When  that  question  was  posed  in  the"
"course of the submission, the learned President’s Counsel stated"
"that 
the 
petitioner 
seeks 
only 
to 
quash 
P7 
whereby"
"compounding  was  ruled  out.    In  my  view,  even  if  that  relief  is"
"granted, that will not solve the matter.  If we stop at that, we are"
"in limbo. I regret, I am not impressed by that argument."
"The other argument of the learned President’s Counsel is that P8"
"and  P9  speak  of 
the  alleged  violations  of  Colombo  Stock"
"Exchange  Listing  Rules,  and  those  violations  cannot,  even  if"
"true,  be  considered  as  offences  committed  under  the  Securities"
"and  Exchange  Commission  Act,  and 
therefore,  P8  and  P9"
"“decisions  and/or  findings”3  are  void  ab  initio.    Learned  Senior"
"State  Counsel  does  not  accept  that  argument.    I  think,  for  the"
"present purposes, I do not need to rule on that matter."
"In  any  event,  P8  and  P9  are  Show  Cause  letters,  and  therefore"
"constitute  part  of  the  investigation  process.    They  are  not  final"
"decisions.    P8  and  P9  have  been  sent  to  Show  Cause  before"
"taking a final decision."
"On the other hand, violation of Colombo Stock Exchange Listing"
"Rules  is  not  the  only  offence  which  is  alleged  to  have  been"
"committed by the petitioner.  The petitioner is, as seen from P4-"
"P7, also suspected of Insider Trading.  This is a different offence,"
"and as seen from P7, was the one, the Securities and Exchange"
"Commission  was  unwilling  to  compound.    Insider  Trading  is,"
