"T
he  pivotal  argument  is  that  the  decision  of  the  Securities  and"
"Exchange  Commission  not  to  compound  the  matter  in  terms  of"
"section 51(a) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Act is"
"unreasonable  and  arbitrary  and  therefore  shall  be  quashed  by"
"way  of  certiorari.    I  am  unable  to  accept  that  the  said  decision"
"P7  was  taken  arbitrarily  as  it  has  been  reached  after  giving  a"
"hearing to the petitioner as stated in P7 itself."
"Even after the filing of this application, it appears, another more"
"serious  attempt  has  been  made  by  the  petitioner  to  compound"
"the  matter  without  success.    Learned  Senior  State  Counsel  in"
"the course of her submission drew the attention of the Court to"
"a  letter  dated  24.01.2018  sent  to  the  petitioner  in  pursuant  to"
"that  attempt  and  a 
letter  dated  05.05.2018  received  by  the"
"Commission from the petitioner in reply."
"The  petitioner  concedes  that  compounding  under  the  Act  is  “in"
"the discretion of the Commission.”2  According to section 51(a) of"
"the Securities and Exchange Commission Act,  “The Commission"
"may  having  regard  to  the  circumstances 
in  which  the  offence"
"under this Act was committed, compound such offence” subject to"
"conditions.    This  Court  is  unaware  of  the  full  circumstances"
"under  which  the  offences  are  alleged  to  have  been  committed"
"except  what  has  been  stated  by  the  alleged  offender  himself  in"
"the petition."
"On  the  other  hand,  whether  this  Court  can,  in  the  exercise  of"
"writ  jurisdiction,  delve  into  those  factual  and  always  disputed"
"matters, is another question."
"2 Vide paragraph 66 of the Petition."
