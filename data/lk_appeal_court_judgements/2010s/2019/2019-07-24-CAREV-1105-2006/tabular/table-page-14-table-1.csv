"","Failure to  comply with Section 12  is  more  than an  omission or defect of procedure.  It is"
"","more  fundamental  than  a  mere  omission  or  defect  of  procedure.  That  is  probably  the"
"","reason  why Justice Soza  stated in  Somawathie  v.  Madawela  (supra)  that  the failure  to"
"","follow Section 12 of the Partition Law transcends the bounds of procedural error."
"","A failure  to  follow  Section  12  leads  to  the  ouster  of  a  true  claimant  with  a  legitimate"
"","interest from  participating at the partition suit and such a deprivation  of  a due process"
"","cannot be a mere omission or a defect of procedure."
"","It is indeed a fundamental vice to precipitate the non~participation of a legitimate claimant"
"","at the trial and such a fundamental vice  cannot save the partition decrees from attack. In"
"","my  view  the  legislature  deliberately  omitted  to  keep  out  of  the  list  given  in  the  2nd"
"","paragraph to Section 48(1)  ""the failure to comply with Section 12""  and such a deliberate"
"","exclusion fortifies my reasoning that Section 12 non~compliance renders the decrees under"
"","Partition  Law  susceptible  to  attack  and  impugnation.  The  failure 
to  make  a  correct"
"","declaration under Section 12  would amount to  a fundamental vice  which is  more than a"
"","mere omission or defect of procedure and such an irregularity results in proceedings that"
"","are null and void. In other words the failure  to follow Section 12  is jurisdictional and not"
"","merely procedural."
"","A  non~conformity with  Section  12  gives  rise  to  a  jurisdictional  defect  which  can  be"
"","impugned both directly and collaterally. If I may sum up the effect of the 2nd paragraph of"
"","Section 48(1) 
in another way, a failure  to effect due service of summons on any party may"
"","not  vitiate  partition  decrees  but  a  failure  to file  a  Section  12  declaration  correctly  and"
"","accurately is more fundamental than a mere omission or defect of procedure."
"","Therefore,  in  order  to  ensure  that the rights  of  all  those  who  have  been prejudiced  are"
"","adjudicated upon, the judgment and interlocutory decree and all orders entered in the case"
"","are hereby invalidated."
"","Since  the  surveyor  has  not identified the corpus  properly,  the learned District Judge  is"
"","directed  to  reject  the  preliminary  plan  and  report  that  have  already  been  filed  and  a"
"","commission  must  be  reissued  to  effect  a preliminary survey  of the land depicted in the"
