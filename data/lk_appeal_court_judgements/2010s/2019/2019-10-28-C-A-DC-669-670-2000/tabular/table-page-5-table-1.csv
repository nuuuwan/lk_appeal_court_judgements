"T
he  plaintiff  does  not  claim  houses  bearing  Assessment  Nos."
"141/1,  141/2  along  Hirimbure  Road.    The  learned  President’s"
"Counsel for the defendant states that house bearing Assessment"
"No.  141/2  is  in  the  land  in  dispute.    I  am  unable  to  accept  it."
"This is made clear by looking at Plan P1, which shows the land"
"claimed  by 
the  plaintiff. 
  At 
the 
argument, 
the 
learned"
"President’s  Counsel for the defendant did not, with reference to"
"Plan P1 or any other Plan, specifically point out to the buildings"
"bearing  numbers  141,  141/1  and  141/2,  except  to  make  a"
"general  statement  that  they  fall  into  the  land  in  dispute.    It"
"seems to me that 141/1 and 141/2 buildings lie immediately to"
"the  east  of  Lot  1  and  2  marked  in  red  in  Plan  P1,  and  the"
"dispute  relates  not  to  the  main  buildings  but  to  the  extensions"
"or  new  additions  made  to  those  buildings  by  the  defendant"
"thereby encroaching upon the plaintiff’s land."
"At this point, I must make it clear that, it is not the case of the"
"defendant that some parts of his land (including 141, 141/1 and"
"141/2)  are  shown  in  Plan  P1—the  land  claimed  by  the  plaintiff"
"as  the  rightful  owner  by  way  of  paper  title.    The  defendant’s"
"position 
is 
that,  she  has  prescribed 
to  some  parts  of 
the"
"plaintiff’s land."
"I cannot accept the argument of the learned President’s Counsel"
"for 
the  defendant 
that 
the 
learned  District  Judge  has  not"
"properly analyzed the evidence led at the trial in the Judgment."
"In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  it  is  my  view  that"
"the learned District Judge has come to the correct conclusion."
"Appeals of both parties are dismissed without costs."
