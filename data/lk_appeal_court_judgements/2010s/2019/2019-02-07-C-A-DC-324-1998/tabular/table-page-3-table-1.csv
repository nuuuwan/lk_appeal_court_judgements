"One  school  of  thought  represented  by  the  leading  local  case  of"
"Siriwardena  v.  Air  Ceylon  Ltd 
[1984]  1  Sri  LR  286  Justice"
"Sharvananda 
(later  Chief 
Justice) 
opted 
to 
adopt 
“order"
"approach” 
(suggested  by  Lord  Alverstone  C.J., 
in  Bozson  v."
"Altrincham  Urban District Council [1903] 1 KB 547) to determine"
"that  question. 
  The  “order  approach”  contemplates  only  the"
"nature of the order in isolation.  When taken in isolation, if the"
"order  finally  disposes  of  the  matter  in  dispute  without  leaving"
"the suit alive, the order is final, and a direct appeal is the proper"
"remedy against such order."
"The  other  school  of  thought  represented  by  the  leading  local"
"case  of  Ranjit  v.  Kusumawathie 
[1998]  3  Sri  LR  232  Justice"
"Dheeraratne  opted  to  adopt  “application  approach”  (suggested"
"by  Lord  Esher  M.R.,  in  Standard  Discount  Co.  v.  La  Grange"
"(1877)  3  CPD  67  and  Salaman  v.  Warner  [1891]  1  QB  734,  and"
"adopted  by  Lord  Denning  M.R.,  in  Salter  Rex  &  Co.  v.  Ghosh"
"[1971]  2  QB  597)  to  determine  that  question.  The  “application"
"approach” contemplates only the nature of the application made"
"to  Court  in  isolation,  and  not  the  order  delivered  per  se.    In"
"accordance  with  this  approach,  if  the  order,  given  in  one  way,"
"will  finally  dispose  of  the  matter  in  dispute,  but,  if  given  in  the"
"other  way,  will  allow  the  action  to  go  on,  the  order  is  not  final,"
"but  interlocutory,  in  which  event,  leave  to  appeal  is  the  proper"
"remedy."
"The  Full  Bench  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Chettiar  v.  Chettiar"
"[2011] 2 Sri LR 70 and [2011] BLR 25 was called upon to decide"
"on  this  vexed  question,  and  the  Full  Bench  of  the  Supreme"
"Court 
(consisting  of 
five  Judges)  having  discussed  both  the"
"approaches 
stemming 
from  English  decisions  unanimously"
