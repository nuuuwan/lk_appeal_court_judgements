"Samayawardhena, J."
"The  plaintiff-appellant  filed  this  action  against  the  defendant-"
"respondent  predominantly  seeking  a  declaration  that  the  latter"
"cannot unilaterally increase the rental of the premises.  Pending"
"determination  of 
the  action, 
the  plaintiff  sought  an 
interim"
"injunction  preventing  the  defendant 
from  dispossessing  him."
"The  defendant  filed  objections  and  answer  together,  and  the"
"inquiry into the interim injunction was taken up before the trial."
"After  that  inquiry  concluded  by  way  of  written  submissions  the"
"learned District Judge by order dated 03.02.1998 dismissed the"
"plaintiff’s  action  upholding  a  preliminary  legal  objection  taken"
"up  by  the  defendant  on  the  basis  that  the  plaintiff’s  alleged"
"cause of action is prescribed.  It is against this order the plaintiff"
"has preferred this appeal."
"The  plaintiff-appellant  has  not  participated  at  the  argument"
"before this Court.  When this appeal came up before me for the"
"first  time,  learned  counsel  for  the  defendant-respondent  invited"
"this Court to pronounce the Judgment on written submissions."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  defendant-respondent  takes  up  a"
"preliminary  objection 
to 
the  maintainability  of 
this  appeal"
"seeking  dismissal  of  it  in  limine  on  the  premise  that  the  direct"
"appeal filed against the impugned order under section 754(1) of"
"the Civil Procedure Code is misconceived in law, and the proper"
"remedy  for  the  plaintiff  was  to  come  by  way  of  leave  to  appeal"
"under section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code."
"The  question  whether  an  appeal  or  leave  to  appeal  lies  against"
"an  “order”  of  the  District  Court  had  been  a  subject  of  much"
"controversy for a long period of time."
