"matter in dispute, I think that for that purpose of these Rules it is"
"final.  On the other hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will"
"finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other,"
"will  allow  the  action  to  go  on,  then  I  think  it  is  not  final,  but"
"interlocutory.”"
"The Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court did not think it fit"
"to  consider  whether  the  Five  Judge  Bench  Judgment  of  the"
"Supreme Court in Chettiar’s case has retrospective effect or not,"
"and instead dismissed the appeal on the basis that the plaintiff"
"should  have  filed  a  leave  to  appeal  application  and  not  a  final"
"appeal  against 
the  dismissal  of 
the  plaintiff’s  action  on  a"
"preliminary issue (even though that order of dismissal was made"
"by  the  District  Court  prior  to  the  Judgment  in  Chettier’s  case)."
"That means, whether the order appealed from was given prior to"
"the  Judgment  in  Chettier’s  case  or  not,  the  correct  test  is  the"
"Application  Test  and  not  the  Order  Test.  Accordingly, 
if  the"
"order,  given  in  one  way,  will  finally  dispose  of  the  matter  in"
"dispute, but, if given in the other way, will allow the action to go"
"on, the order is not final, but interlocutory, in which event, leave"
"to appeal is the proper remedy."
"When  I  adopt  that  test  to  the  present  appeal,  it  is  abundantly"
"clear that, an appeal does not lie against the order of dismissal"
"made  by 
the  District  Judge.  Notwithstanding 
the 
impugned"
"order  takes  the  shape  of  a  final  Judgment  as  it  is,  if  the  said"
"preliminary  objection  was  decided  against  the  defendant,  the"
"case  would  not  have  ended  there,  but  the  trial  would  have"
"proceeded  with,  and  ultimately 
the  case  would  have  been"
"decided on merits."
