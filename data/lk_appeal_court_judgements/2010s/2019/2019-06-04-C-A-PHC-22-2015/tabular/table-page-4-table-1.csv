"h
er ex parte.  The appellate Court has no wherewithal to initiate"
"an inquiry into that allegation."
"The second ground is, no order has been made on the settlement"
"in  terms  of  section  66(6).    If  the  appellant  is  not  a  party  to  the"
"settlement,  whether  or  not  an  order  has  been  made  on  the"
"settlement  is  irrelevant  to  her.    If  she  thinks  that  no  order  has"
"been  made,  and  therefore  the  agreement  is  unenforceable,  she"
"can  remain  silent.    If  no  order  has  been  made,  it  is  difficult  to"
"understand  why  she  went  before  the  High  Court  seeking  to  set"
"aside “the orders dated 27.09.2012”."
"The third ground relates to the merits of the application.  When"
"the matter is settled, there is no necessity to consider the merits"
"and demerits of the substantive matter."
"Without prejudice to the above, I must state that,  the nature of"
"section 66 proceedings is quasi civil.  As the learned High Court"
"Judge has correctly stated, there is no necessity for a party to be"
"physically  present  before  Court  in  an  application  under  section"
"66. 
  As 
the 
section  66(8)(a)  provides,  a  party 
can 
enter"
"appearance  by  an  Attorney-at-Law.    That  is  what  the  appellant"
"has done in this case from the inspection.  It is not her position"
"that  she  was  not  represented,  as  per  the  proceedings  at  the"
"inspection, by her Attorney-at-Law.  Her complaint seems to be"
"that,  notwithstanding  she  was  represented  by  an  Attorney-at-"
"Law,  as  she  did  not  sign  the  case  record,  she  is  not  bound  by"
"the  settlement.    Although  section  66(6)  requires  the  settlement"
"to  be  signed  by 
the  parties, 
in  my  view,  when  parties  are"
"represented  by  Attorneys-at-Law, 
the 
settlement  does  not"
