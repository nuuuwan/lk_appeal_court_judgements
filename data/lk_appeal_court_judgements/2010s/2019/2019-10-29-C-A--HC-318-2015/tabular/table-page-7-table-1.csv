"has  only  considered 
the  element  of  possession,  not 
the  knowledge  as"
"required  (pages  204  and  205).  Hence,  the  learned  Trial  Judge  erred  when"
"he  found

"doubt.  As  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the  element  of 'knowledge'"
"beyond reasonable doubt, the conviction cannot be sustained. Both grounds"
