"""It should also be mentioned that, Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance only spells out the"
"mode of proof or what I might call  the  minimum  required  to make  the  Deed admissible  in"

"evidence,  which  is  that,  as  stated in  Section  68,  ""at least""  one  attesting  witness must give

"evidence to enable  the  Deed to be  ""used as  evidence"".  In  other words,  the testimony of ""at 
o"
"least"" one attesting witness is the threshold stipulated by Section 68 which must be passed for 
C
the Court to take the Deed into consideration."
"However, Section 68 does not state that, leading the evidence of only one attesting witness"
"shall fully discharge the burden of proving due execution of the Deed. In  other words,  Section"
"68 does not refer to the quantum of proof required to prove the Deed in  a manner which  will"
"satisfy the Court that the Deed was  the act and deed of the executant and was  executed in

"As Tambiah, J. explained in JAYASINGHE v.  SAMARAWICKREMA {{1982} 1 SLR 349 at Page"
"359}  citing  Sarkar's  Law  of Evidence,  ""Sec.  68  of the  Evidence  Ordinance  lays  down 
that"

"documents  required by law  to be attested shall not be used as  evidence  unless  at least one"
"attesting witness is called to prove its execution, if he is  alive and subject to the process of the"
"Court. 
'This  is  not the same thing as saying that a document required to be attested by more"
"than one witness shall be proved by the evidence of only one witness.  Sec.  68 only lays  down"
"the mode of proof and not the quantum of evidence required. More than one attesting witness"
"may be necessary to prove a  document according  to  the circumstances  of a  case' (Sarkar's"
"Law of Evidence,  10th  Edition. Page 591)""."
"Therefore,  if there  are  doubts  regarding  the  circumstances  in  which  the  Deed  was"
"executed or the role played by the Notary Public,  the party producing that Deed may be well"
"advised to lead the evidence of more than one attesting witness since the evidence of the"
"Notary Public alone or the evidence of only one witness may not suffice to duly prove a Deed"
"which is challenged."" [Emphasis added]"
