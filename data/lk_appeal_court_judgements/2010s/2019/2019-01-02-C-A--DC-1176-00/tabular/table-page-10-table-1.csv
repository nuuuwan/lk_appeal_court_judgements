the  parties  and  when

"continue with the trial. Nevertheless, six further issues were raised on  behalf"
"of the  Defendants on that date  making the number of issues totaling up  to"
"18. The  learned District Judge in  his judgment has stated that on 29.02.1996,"
"six issues have been framed on  behalf of the Plaintiff and six issues on  behalf"
"of the  Defendants. However, the learned  District Judge  in  his judgment has"
"listed  issues  nos.l  to  6  framed  by  the  Plaintiff on  29.02.1996  and  the  six"
"further  issues  raised  by  the  Defendants  on  28.01.1997  and  answered  only"

the  judgment.  However,  the  proviso  to  the  article"
"138(1)  of the  constitution  states  that no judgment,  decree  or order of any"
"court  shall  be 
reversed  or  varied  on  account  of  any  error,  defect  or"
"irregularity which  has  not prejudiced the substantial  rights of the parties or"
"occasioned a failure of justice."
