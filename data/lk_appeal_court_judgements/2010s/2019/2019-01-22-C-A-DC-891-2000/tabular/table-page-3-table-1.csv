"T
he 
learned  District  Judge  has  accepted 
the  position  of 
the"
"plaintiffs  that  by  virtue  of  the  Final  Order  made  under  the  Waste"
"Lands  Ordinance  and  published 
in 
the  Gazette  marked  P4,"
"Rathnapata Berakara Gedara Siriya became entitled to 1/3rd share"
"of the corpus and Athpatiyawe Gedara Devaya became entitled to"
