"issues that had been raised on behalf of the 6th Defendant Punchi Menika had put in issue"
"the question of exclusion of Lot 1."
"Whilst giving evidence at the trial,  the substituted Plaintiff (the husband of the original"
"Plaintiff)  admitted in  examination in chief that the house  standing on Lot  1 was in the"
"occupation of the 6th Defendant who also enjoyed the cultivation therein. The substituted"
"Plaintiff expressly  admitted  that  the house  and cultivation  in  Lot  1 belonged  to  the  6th"
"Defendant. The 2A and lOA Defendant (one and the same person Dingiri Amma) also gave"
"evidence to the effect that the house and cultivation in Lot 1 belonged to the 6th Defendant."
"These  two  admissions  emanating  from  the  substituted  Plaintiff  and  the  2A  and  lOA"
"Defendant-Appellant would amount to statements against  their proprietary interest and"
"the distinctive aspect of these statements against proprietary interest was that it was an"
"intra curial statement made in Court. Thus the Court could act on these statements on the"
"basis that they are true."
"The 6A Defendant too testified in order to bolster his claim that Lot 1 has to be excluded."
"There  was  also  another  witness  Irene  Somawathie who  supported the  testimony  of  6A"
"Defendant.  Both testified that Lot 1 and the house in Lot 1 had been in the occupation of"
"the 6th Defendant and later the 6A Defendant for more than 30 years."
