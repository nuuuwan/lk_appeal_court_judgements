"must 
say 
that 
the 
in  mind 
these 
learned  District  Judge  of  Ratnapura  had  borne"
"requirements  but  the  fact  remains  that  the  Plaintiff's  documents  were  not  read  into"
"evidence  at  the  end  of  her  case. 
It  must  be  remembered  that  only  the  Plaintiff  gave"
"evidence  for  herself,  whilst  the  wife  of  the  original  Defendant  alone  gave  evidence  on"
"behalf of the defence.  It so happened on 03rd  April 1997 that after the Plaintiff had been re,"
"examined,  the Court put off further  trial for  16th  October 1997.  No formal  closure of  the"
"Plaintiff's case took place on 03rd April 1997.  Neither were the documents produced by the"
"Plaintiff (X,the survey plan and PI,the deed bearing No.13086)  read into evidence as does"
"usually happen at the end of a party's case."
"When the adjourned trial came up on 16th October 1997, the original Defendant's wife (the"
"that  the 
substituted  Defendant)  was  summoned  to  give  evidence.  This  only  shows"
"Plaintiff's case was closed on 03rd April 1997, though it had not been done expressly. If the"
"Plaintiff's case had not come  to a close  on 03rd  April 1997,  the Defendant's wife could not"
"have been summoned rd April 1997.  But I do not consider it fatal to the Plaintiff's case.  By"
"the time the virtual end of the Plaintiff's case took place on 03rd April 1997, the documents"
"produced by  the  Plaintiff namely  X  and  PI  had  already  been led  in  evidence  and  their"
"contents  elicited.  The  Plaintiff was  cross,examined  on  these  documents.  Therefore  they"
"constituted evidence  in the  case  and it is  odiously technical to  contend that this Court"
"cannot consider them because they were not read in evidence at the end of the Plaintiff's"
"case.  I hasten to observe that the fact that documents must be read in evidence at the end"
