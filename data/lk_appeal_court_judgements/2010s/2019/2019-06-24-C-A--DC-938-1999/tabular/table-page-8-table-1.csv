"In order to assess the correctness of the rival arguments vis-a.-vis the judgment in favour of"
"the Defendant-Respondent, I would state that as  does often happen in the majority of the"
"cases, the resolution of this appeal turns on paper title and prescriptive possession alleged"
"by  the  Plaintiff vis-a.-vis  possession  referable  to  a  lawful  title  secured from  a  statutory"
"determination made by the LRC in 1976 in favour of the Defendant-Respondent."
"This was indeed a rei vindicatio  action filed by the Plaintiff who relled on a paper title and"
"prescription."
"Marsoof,  J.  had  occasion  to  set  out  the  basic  ingredients  of  an  action  rei  vindicatio  in"
