"effected the deed of sale on 1th December 1987 was the last of the predecessors. In fact the"
"Plaintiff testified that he was still alive though old."
"There being no presumption that all the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff who are alive"
"are not able to give evidence owing to old age, it is for the Plaintiff to explain why they are"
"not called to give evidence."
"The Plaintiff has failed to do so and no supporting evidence of possession has been given."
"Even  the  complaint  about  the  incident  of the  Defendant  trespassing on to  the land and"
"cutting trees, if at all it was made to Police or Garama Sevaka has not been forthcoming.  It"
"is legitimate in these circumstances  to presume that this  evidence if produced would be"
"unfavorable to the Plaintiff."
"There is  also an inconsistency per se in the case  of the  Plaintiff.  Before  the surveyor, she"
"disputed only lot A which was part of lot 89.  But in the amended plaint she brought in not"
"only lot A but also lots 91A4 and 97.  The omission to assert ownership to lots 9lA4 and 97"
"at the earliest opportunity before  the  surveyor casts doubts on the prescriptive claim of"
"the  Plaintiff,Appellant  in  respect  of  these  lots.  In  the  circumstances,  I  hold  that  the"
"learned District Judge  of Ratnapura  came  to  the correct finding  that the Plaintiff has  not"
"preSCribed to lots A, 9lA 4 and 97."
"Accordingly I proceed to affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge of Ratnapura and"
"dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff,Appellant with costs."
