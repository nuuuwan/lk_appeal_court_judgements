"a.  Ownership based on paper title."
"b.  Ownership based on possession (Adverse possession)."
"In the case before me,  the Plaintiff's claim for  ownership is based both on paper title and"
"adverse possession and at one stage of the argument, Mr.  B.O.P Jayawardhana submitted"
"that he would rest his case on prescriptive possession alone as the adduction of paper title"
"in the court a quo was likely to run into problems in this Court.  Since it is the possessory"
"element of ownership or prescriptive possession that formed the fulcrum of the Plaintiff's"
"case, it would be unnecessary for me to dwell at length on the contentions made in respect"
"of the deed bearing No.13086  (PI) produced to support the paper tide. I would though deal"
"with the arguments in respect of this deed which provoked some interesting questions."
"Paper title alleged by the Plaintiff~Deed of Sale bearing No.l3086/C in 1987"
"Let me first come to the paper title alleged by the Plaintiff.  At first blush, this was a deed"
"of sale  effected by the father  of  the  Plaintiff Pethanjiyalage J amis  Singho  in favor  of the"
"Plaintiff  on  nth  December  1987.  The  Plaintiff filed  this  action  barely  7 months  later  on"
"29.07.1988."
"The father of the Plaintiff had executed this deed as a deed of sale in favour of the Plaintiff"
"for  an alleged  consideration  of  Rs.4,OOO/~, which  the  Notary  in his  attestation declares"
"never passed in his presence. Nor does the Notary attest that it was acknowledged to have"
"been received prior  to  the execution.  Before  I  make  my  conclusions  on the deed,  let me"
"advert to an argument raised by Mr. Athula Perera, the learned Counsel for the Defendant~"
"Respondent."
"Mr. Athula Perera argued that this deed cannot be considered because this was not given a"
"marking by the learned District Judge and when the Plaintiff closed his case, he had not"
"read that document into evidence.  But when I examine the original record, I find that the"
"learned  District  Judge  had  given  a  marking  (PI)  and  initialed  it  on  03rd  April  1997."
"Identifying a document by a letter and initialing it are  requirements imposed by Section"
"154  of the Civil Procedure Code and these  are  duties  cast upon the District Judge  and I"
