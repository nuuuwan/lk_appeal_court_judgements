the 
principal

"confirmed  and  probationary 
employment? 
In 
the"
"former,  the  burden 
lies  on  the  employer  to 
justify"
"termination; and 
this  he  must  do  by 
reference

"objective  standards. 
In  the 
latter,  upon  proof  that"
"termination took place during probation the burden is"
"on 
the 
employee 
to 
establish 
unjustifiable"
"termination, and the employee must establish at least"
"a prima facie case of mala fides, before the employer"
"is  called  upon  to  adduce  evidence  as  to  his  reasons"
"for  dismissal;  and  the  employer  does  not  have  to"
"show that the dismissal was, objectively, justified."
