"h
alf  amount  of  the  loss  caused  to  the  University  by  purchasing"
"items at higher prices than the market value prevailed at the time"
"of purchase is unjustifiable as there was no specific charge for that"
"amount to be surcharged.  This assessment of loss, admittedly, has"
"been  done  after  the  conclusion  of  the  formal  inquiry  and  without"
"any notice to or participation by the  Petitioner.  The Petitioner did"
"not  get  any  opportunity  to  challenge  the  accuracy  of  the  figure."
"The explanation that the  loss could not have been included in the"
"charge  sheet,  but  could  only  have  been  assessed  after  the  formal"
"inquiry is unacceptable.  That could have been ascertained, if they"
"were keen, before the charges were framed.  I am of the view that,"
"on that aspect of the matter, the Petitioner has not been afforded a"
"fair  hearing,  and  therefore  that  part  of  the  punishment  cannot  be"
"allowed  to  stand.    Hence  I  quash  that  part  of  the  punishment  to"
"recover a portion of the loss from the Petitioner.  That shall have no"
"bearing  to  the  decision  to  dismiss  the  Petitioner  probationer  from"
"service."
"Subject  to  that,  the  application  of  the  Petitioner  is  dismissed  but"
"without costs."
