"Respondents do not accept that position on the premise that her"
"appointment  as  the  Senior  Assistant  Bursar  is  to  the  Swami"
"Vipulananda  Institute  of  Aesthetic  Studies,  which  is  a  Higher"
"Educational Institute established under the Universities Act.  In"
"the  facts  and  circumstance  of  this  case,  however,  there  is  no"
"necessity for me to rule on that question as it is in my view not"

"Then the Petitioner says that the termination of her services by"
"the  University  Council 
(which  was  done  mainly  upon

"Disciplinary Inquiry Final Report marked 2R2) is bad in law as,"
"according 
to 
the 
Letter 
of  Appointment  marked

section 
14(f) 
of 
the 
Interpretation"
"Ordinance3,  person  who  has  the  power  to  appoint  any  officer"
"shall have the power to remove him."
"However, 
this  argument

"the 
legislature  has  not  provided

"dismissal,  which 
is  not  the  case  here. 
  In  terms  of  section"
"45(2)(xii)  of  the  Universities  Act,  the  Council  has  that  power."
"This  has  also  been  acknowledged  by 
the  University  Grants"
"Commission by 2R7B."
