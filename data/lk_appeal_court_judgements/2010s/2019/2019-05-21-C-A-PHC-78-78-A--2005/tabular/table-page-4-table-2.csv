"and documents or counter-affidavits and documents, as the"
"case may be."
"In terms of section 66(6), after the counter-affidavits are filed, the"
"Court shall, before fixing the case for inquiry, make every effort to"
"induce the parties to arrive at a settlement of the dispute and if"
"the parties agree to a settlement, the settlement shall be recorded"
"and order made accordingly.  If there is no settlement, in terms of"
"section 66(7), the Court shall fix the case for inquiry."
"In Ali v. Abdeen (supra), Gunawardena J., sitting alone has held"
"that non-compliance with section 66(6) makes the final order of"
"the learned Magistrate invalid as “It is the making of an effort to"
"induce parties and the fact that the effort  was not attended with"
"success that clothe the Primary Court with jurisdiction to initiate an"
"inquiry with regard to the question as to who was in possession.”"
"According  to  Gunawardena  J.  the  Magistrate’s  Court  has  no"
"jurisdiction  to  hold  the  inquiry  and  then  make  an  order  unless"
"the  Court  makes  an  effort  to  induce  the  parties  to  arrive  at  a"
"settlement of the dispute."
