"In the case of Pisani v. Attorney-General for Gibraltar (1987)"
"L.R. 5 P.C. 516, the Privy Council affirmed this same doctrine"
"that unless there is an attempt to give the Court a jurisdiction"
"which it does not possess, the Court can, in the absence of"
"objection,  hear  a  case  where  it  has  jurisdiction  over  the"
"subject.  These  principles  were  followed  also  in  the  case  of"
"Thevagnanasekeram  v.  Kuppammal 
(1934)  36  NLR  337"
"where Macdonell, C.J. held that a party was not entitled to"
"challenge  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  to  give  the  decision"
"invited by such party, so long as the Court had jurisdiction"
"over the subject."
"The distinction between elements which are essential for the"
"foundation  of 
jurisdiction  and 
the  mode 
in  which  such"
"jurisdiction  has 
to 
be 
assumed  and 
exercised 
is 
of"
"fundamental 
importance. 
Non-compliance 
with 
the"
"prescribed mode in which a particular jurisdiction should be"
"assumed  and  exercised  can  be  waived,  provided  there  is"
"jurisdiction over the subject matter."
"Therefore in the instant case as there was no objection to the"
"invocation  of 
the 
jurisdiction  of 
the  Magistrate,  he  was"
"entitled  to proceed on  with  the  matter  as  it  was  within his"
"plenary jurisdiction. (emphasis added)"
