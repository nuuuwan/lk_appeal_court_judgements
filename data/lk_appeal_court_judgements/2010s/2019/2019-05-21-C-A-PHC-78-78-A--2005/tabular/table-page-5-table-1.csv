"unawardena J. has further elaborated this at pages 415-416 in"
"the following terms:"
"Thus, it is to be observed that the Primary Court Judge was"
"under a peremptory duty to encourage or make every effort,"
"so  to  say,  to  facilitate  dispute  settlement,  before  assuming"
"jurisdiction to hold an inquiry into the matter of possession"
"and impose on the parties a settlement by means of the court"
"order. It was obligatory on the Primary Court as a condition-"
"precedent  to holding  an  inquiry,  to have  made  a  conscious"
"endeavor  to  have  composed  or  ironed  out  the  differences"
"between the parties-a duty which, in this instance, had been"
"neglected. The making of an effort by the court was such a"
"duty as should have been done or performed before the court"
"could have validly embarked upon an inquiry in pursuance"
"of or rather in compliance with sec. 66(7) set out above. That"
"is a preliminary requirement which has to be fulfilled before"
"the jurisdiction of the Primary Court exists to hold an inquiry"
"under  section  66(7).  When  Parliament  has  enacted 
that"
"provided a certain situation exists, then a tribunal may have"
"certain powers, it is clear that the tribunal will not have those"
"powers  unless 
that  situation  exists.  The  making  of  an"
"endeavor  by  the  court  to  settle  amicably 
is  a  condition"
"precedent which had to be satisfied before the function of the"
"Primary  Court  under  sec.  66(7)  began,  that  is,  to  consider"
"who  had  been  in  possession.  Since  the  Primary  Court  had"
"acted  without  jurisdiction  in  proceeding  to  determine  the"
"question of possession, its decision is, in fact, of no force or"
"avail in law. Accordingly the decision dated 21. 11. 1990 is"
"hereby  set  aside.  It  is  the  making  of  an  effort  to  induce"
"parties  and  the  fact  that  the  effort  was  not  attended  with"
