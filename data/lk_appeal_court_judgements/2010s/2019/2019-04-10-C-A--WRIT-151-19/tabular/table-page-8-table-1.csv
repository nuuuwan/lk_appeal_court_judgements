"This  is  the  reason  given  by  the  10
Respondent  for the  trials  to  be  scheduled"
"from  18
th February  2019  onwards,  as  well  as  why the  trials  cannot  be  held  in"
"the first week of March, as  proposed  by  the 1st  Petitioner. The  most important"
"point  made  in  'P6',  especially  as  the team  was  to take  part in  an  international"
"team  event, 
is 
that  the  above  scheduling  of  dates  was  done  as  ""the  Team"
"captain  and  coach  must  have  sufficient  time  to  prepare 
the 
team 
for  the"
"respective competition""."
"The  1
st  Petitioner, who  had  replied  'P6'  by  his  email  dated  14th February 2019,"
"annexed  to  the  petition  marked  'P7'  had  raised  issue  with  players  who  have"
"not  played  a  tournament  in  Sri  Lanka  being  permitted  to  participate  in  the"
"trials  as  opposed  to  the  2nd  Petitioner  who  had  not  only  taken  part  in  many"
"tournaments  held  in  Sri  Lanka  but  won  several  of them.  However,  the  issue"
"that the  1st  Petitioner was  required  to  address  at that stage  was  not whether"
"others  could  take  part  in  the trials  but importantly, whether the  2nd  Petitioner"
"was  agreeable to take  part in  the trials.  In  this  regard,  this Court observes that"
"the  1st  Petitioner  had  reiterated  in 
'P7'  that  the  2nd  Petitioner  is  due  to  take"
"part  in  National  netball  trials  during  the  period  that  the  tennis  trials  were"
"proposed to be  held ."
"This  Court  will  now  consider  whether  the  decision  of the  10
th  Respondent  in"
"'P6' 
to  schedule  the  trials  for  a  date  after  February  18  and, 
the  refusal  to"
"postpone  the  trials,  is  unreasonable. This  Court  must  observe  that  all  parties"
"are  in agreement that trials  had  to  be  conducted  in  order to select the team .4"
"Thus,  non  part icipation  at 
the 
trials,

reason

"particular  player  being  disqualified
