"It was held by Sharvananda C.J. in Theivandran v. Ramanathan"
"Chettiar12 that:"
"In a vindicatory action the claimant need merely prove two"
"facts; namely, that he is the owner of the thing and that the"
"thing  to  which  he  is  entitled  to  possession  by  virtue  of  his"
"ownership is in the possession of the defendant. Basing his"
"claim  on  his  ownership,  which  entities  him  to  possession,"
"he may sue for the ejectment of any person in possession of"
"it  without  his  consent.  Hence,  when  the  legal  title  to  the"
"premises  is  admitted  or  proved  to  be  in  the  plaintiff,  the"
"burden  of  proof  is  on  the  defendant  to  show  that  he  is"
"lawful possession."
