the  twin  sister  of the  deceased  in  her  evidence  said  that,  the"
"","Appellant  and  deceased  used 
to  quarrel  at  home.  There  had  been 
issues"
"","raised  by  the  Appellant on  the  character of the  deceased  as  well  (pages  217"
"","and  218  of the appeal  brief).  Although  the  learned  Trial judge has  taken that"
"","also  into consideration, he  has  said  that motive is  not an  essential element to"
"","prove the  charge.  As I have elaborated  before, there is  sufficient evidence to"
"","prove 
the  charge  against 
the  Appellant 
irrespective  of  the  evidence  on"
"","motive.  Hence, it has  not caused any  prejudice to  the Appellant."
