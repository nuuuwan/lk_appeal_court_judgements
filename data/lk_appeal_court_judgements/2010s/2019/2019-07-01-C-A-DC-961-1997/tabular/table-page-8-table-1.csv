"17.","As  discussed by the learned District Judge in his judgment, although there is"
"","evidence to the effect that the Defendants have claimed possessing the land,"
"","there  is  no  evidence  of any  act  of ouster  against  the  Plaintiff.  Further,  as"
"","mentioned before, when the share  of the corpus owned by  Tharalis de  Silva"
"","and  Walton  de  Silva  are  vested  with 
the  Land  Reform  Commission,"
"","Defendants  could  not  have  claimed  prescriptive title  for  that  share  without"
"","making the Land Reform Commission a party."
"18.","Therefore,  Defendants  are not entitled to prescriptive title to the whole land"
"","sought to  be  partitioned.  Defendants  are  entitled to the  half share  devolved"
"","from  Kalugalage Andoris  Pieris  and  finally  from  Rathgamage  Senawasa de"
"","Silva as mentioned in the Plaintiffs pedigree."
"19.","For the aforementioned reasons following orders are made;"
