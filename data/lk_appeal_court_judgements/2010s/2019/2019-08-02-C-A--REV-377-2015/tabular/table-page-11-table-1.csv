"Shirani  Tilakawardena, J.  held: ""Action  taken  with  regard  to  acts  of contempt  is  based  on  the"
"premises  that a well regulated law of a civilized community cannot be sustained without sanctions being"
"imposed for such conduct.  It is important to maintain the respect and dignity of the court and its officers,"
"it  is 
whose  task 
to  uphold  and  enforce 
the 
law  because  without  such  respect,  public  faith 
in 
the"
"administration ofjustice would be undermined and the law itself would fall into disrepute."""
