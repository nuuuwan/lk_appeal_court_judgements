"Petitioners  are  afforded  all  opportunities  to  explain  their  conduct  and  expiate  their"
"infractions if there were such acts that would be tantamount to contempt of court."
"So  I would affirm the order of the District Court of Kegalle  dated 27.07.2015  and remand"
"the case to the District Court for  an early disposal as expeditiously as  expeditious could"
"be."
