"compliance with the order that the Commissioner repaired to the land in question where"
"he encountered unruly behavior, which, as the report made to Court indicates, prima facie"
"affords  evidence  of  defiance  or  disobedience  or  obstruction  to  a  court  order.  The  1st"
"Petitioner has cross-examined the Commissioner and must have provided an explanation"
"which remains  on record for  the trier to assay  and evaluate. The 2nd  Petitioner owes an"
"explanation if he was contemptuous of the order of court and the death of the principal"
"witness- the Court Commissioner cannot bring to  an end the prospective unfolding of"
"the 2nd  Petitioner's explanation in Court."
"The rationale of both civil and criminal contempt is  essentially the same:  upholding the"
"effective administration of justice. If a court lacked the means to  enforce its orders, and"
"its orders could be disobeyed with impunity, not only would individual litigants suffer,"
"the whole administration of justice would be brought into dispute."
"As was pointed out in the Australian decision of Re Nash, ex parte Tuckerman (1970) 3"
