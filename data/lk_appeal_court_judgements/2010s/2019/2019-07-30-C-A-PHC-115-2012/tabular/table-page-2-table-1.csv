ahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The petitioner-respondent (respondent) filed an application against"
"the  respondent-appellant  (appellant)  under  section  66(1)(b)  of  the"
"Primary Courts’ Procedure Act in the Magistrate’s Court seeking to"
"restore  him  in  possession  in  terms  of  section  68(3)  on  the  basis"
"that  he  was  dispossessed 
from 
the 
land 
in  question  by 
the"
"appellant  immediately  within  two  months  before  the  filing  of  the"
"application."
"As  seen  from  the  Journal  Entry  dated  25.02.2010,  the  learned"
"Magistrate  first  having  satisfied  that  there  would  be  an  imminent"
"threat  to  the  breach  of  the  peace  as  a  result  of  this  land  dispute,"
"issued notice on the respondent."
"However, 
after 
the 
inquiry 
concluded 
by 
way 
of  written"
"submissions,  the  learned  Magistrate  by  order  dated  08.07.2010"
"dismissed 
the  application  of 
the  petitioner,  without  making  a"
"determination  on  possession,  stating 
that 
the  Court  has  no"
"jurisdiction  to  make  an  order  on  possession  as  there  was  no"
"breach of the peace."
"On  appeal,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  set  aside  that  order  on"
"the  ground  that  once  the  Magistrate  was  satisfied  that  there  was"
"an  imminent  threat  to  the  breach  of  the  peace,  he  cannot  at  the"
"end dismiss the application on want of jurisdiction on the premise"
"that  there  was  no  threat  to  the  breach  of  the  peace.    The  learned"
"High  Court  Judge  directed  the  learned  Magistrate  to  deliver  the"
"order afresh on merits."
"It  is  against  this  Judgement  of  the  High  Court  the  appellant  has"
"filed this appeal."
