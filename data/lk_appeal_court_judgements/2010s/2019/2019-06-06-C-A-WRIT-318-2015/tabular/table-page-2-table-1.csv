"The 
petitioner 
(Hilton 
International 
Colombo) 
filed 
this"
"application seeking to quash by way of certiorari the order of the"
"1st 
respondent 
(Commissioner  General 
of 
Labour) 
dated"
"10.03.2015  marked  P9  whereby  the  petitioner  was  ordered  to"
"pay  a  sum  of  Rs.978,900/=  to  the  3rd  respondent 
(Medical"
"Doctor) as gratuity on the basis that the 3rd respondent was an"
"employee 
(as  opposed 
to  an 
independent  contractor)  of 
the"
"petitioner from 01.06.1987-01.03.2012 (nearly 25 years)."
"It  is  the  position  of  the  petitioner  that  the  3rd  respondent  was"
"not  an  employee  but  an  independent  contractor  and  therefore"
"the  petitioner  is  not  obliged  in  law  to  pay  gratuity  to  the  3rd"
"respondent."
"So  much  has  been  written  and  so  many  theories/tests  have"
"been  evolved  on  how 
to  distinguish  an  employee 
from  an"
"independent  contractor. 
  However,  whether  a  person 
is  an"
"employee  or  an  independent  contractor  is  purely  a  question  of"
"fact  to  be  decided  on  unique  facts  and  circumstances  of  each"
"individual case.  In this process, labels, designations, particular"
"terms used by the employer in Agreements entered into between"
"the two parties etc. are, more often than not, misleading and not"
"binding."
"The  petitioner  has  advertised  for  the  post  of  Medical  Officer  of"
"Hilton  International  Colombo.    In  response,  the  3rd  respondent"
"has  applied  for  the  said  post  by  application  dated  22.11.1986.1"
"By  the 
letter  dated  27.05.1987, 
the  General  Manger  of  the"
"petitioner  has  inter  alia  informed  the  3rd  respondent  that  â€œwe"
"decided to obtain your services as the Medical Officer of the Hotel"
