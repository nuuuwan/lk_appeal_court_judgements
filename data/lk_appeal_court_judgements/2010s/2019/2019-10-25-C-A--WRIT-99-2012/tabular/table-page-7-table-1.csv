"through  letters  of  appeal  dated  28
December  2011  marked 
'P2S'  and  29th"

"'lRl4',  the  Petitioner  had  been 
informed  that  the  decision  to  terminate  his"
"training  could  not  be  changed  since  the  Petitioner  had 
'failed  to  achieve  the"
"expected standards of the  Company'.  The  Respondents  have  also taken  up the"
