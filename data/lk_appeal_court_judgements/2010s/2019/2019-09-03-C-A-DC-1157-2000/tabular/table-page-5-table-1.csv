"T
he  two  attesting  witnesses  and  the  executor  of  the  Last  Will"
"have not given evidence."
"The  executor  of  the  Last  Will  who  is  the  Respondent  is  not  a"
"beneficiary of the Last Will."
"I  cannot  agree  with  the  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for"
"the 7th and 8th Respondents that it is a “mandatory requirement"
"in Testamentary Law” to lead evidence of the propounder of the"
"Will.    There  is  no  such  legal  requirement.    In  order  to  prove  a"
"Last Will, who shall be called to give evidence  depends on facts"
"and circumstances of each individual case."
"In  the  instant  case,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  the  grievance  of"
"the  Appellant  and  also  the  7th  and  8th  Respondents  is  that  the"
"testator has included in the Last Will some properties which did"
"not belong to him.  The Appellant in his evidence (at pages 132-"
"133 of the Brief) has clearly admitted that he is unable to state"
"with  certainty  whether  or  not  the  deceased  executed  the  Last"
"Will, and the only worry he has is the deceased bequeathing the"
"property  described  in  item  No.  4  of  the  Last  Will  to  Edward"
"Dirckze who is living in Spain."
"As I have already stated, it is significant to note that, none of the"
"documents  marked  by  the  Notary  in  his  evidence  as  P1-P6  has"
"been  moved  to  be  marked  subject  to  proof.    This  includes  the"
"affidavits of the two attesting witnesses to the Last Will marked"
"P4  and  P5.    Hence  there  was  no  necessity  to  call  the  attesting"
"witnesses to give oral evidence."
