"s
tatutorily  entitled 
to  claim. 
  The  question 
relates 
to 
the"
"entitlement of the enhanced part of gratuity in accordance with"
"P7  whereby, 
if 
I  may 
repeat, 
the  staff  officers 
“who  have"
"completed  unblemished  service 
in 
to 
the  Bank”  are  eligible"
"receive.    I  must  also  emphasize  that  this  claim  is  made  by  the"
"employee  not  after 
retirement  or 
resignation 
from 
faithful"
"service,  but  after  dismissal,  which  was  not  contested  by  the"
"employee 
as 
he  was 
entitled 
to 
do. 
In 
the 
facts 
and"
"circumstances  of  this  case,  the  4th  Respondent  does  not  have"
"“unblemished service”."
"An  employee  cannot,  in  my  view,  claim,  as  of  right,  that  he  is"
"entitled to enhanced gratuity, or gratuity in excess of the normal"
"gratuity payable under the Payment of Gratuity Act.   That  does"
"not  mean  that  the  employee  is  at  the  mercy  of  the  employer"
"when 
it  comes 
to  enhanced  gratuity,  or 
the  employer  can"
"wantonly and arbitrarily deny the fruits of the enhanced gratuity"
"scheme  put  in  place,  of  which  the  other  employees,  similarly"
"circumstanced,  are  beneficiaries.    The  employer’s  decision  or"
"rather discretion, as one might call it,  can be challenged before"
"the  correct 
forum. 
 
In  modern 
law  the  concept  of  absolute"
"discretion  is  unacceptable.    However,  in  the  instant  case,  the"
"Petitioner employer has not acted arbitrarily or unfairly when it"
"denied enhanced gratuity to the employee."
