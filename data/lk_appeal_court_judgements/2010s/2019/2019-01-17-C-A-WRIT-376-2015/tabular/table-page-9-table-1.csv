"B
ikku  University,  and  that  may  be  the  reason  why  the  Act"
"provides that the Uththarithara Sabhawa shall examine not only"
"the educational qualifications but also the other qualifications of"
"the Bhikku applicants in selecting one for the said position."
"In  between  the  petitioner  and  the  32nd  respondent,  there  is  no"
"dispute

"experienced than the petitioner."
"I  see  nothing  wrong  in  the  decision  taken  by  the  Uththarithara"

"Is it reasonable for the petitioner to expect this Court to read the"
"theses  of  the  32nd  respondent  and  decide  whether  the  latter’s"

"other  hand,  what 
is 
the  proof  before 
this  Court 
that 
the"
"petitioner’s post-graduate degrees are in Buddhist Studies or in"
"any  other  subject  connected  thereto  except  his
