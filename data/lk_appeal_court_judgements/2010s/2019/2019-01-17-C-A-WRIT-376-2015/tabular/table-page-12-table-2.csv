"This application of the petitioner is clearly devoid of merit.  Even"
"though the decision was taken by the Uththarithara Sabhawa to"

"made  because  of  the  ex  parte  interim  order  obtained  by  the"
"petitioner from the previous Bench of this Court on 06.10.2015,"

"I  dismiss  the  application  of  the  petitioner.    The  petitioner  shall"
"pay  a  sum  of  Rs.200,000/=  as  costs  of  the  action  to  the  32nd"
