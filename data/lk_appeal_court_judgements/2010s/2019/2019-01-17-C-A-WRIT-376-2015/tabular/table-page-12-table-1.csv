"There  is  a  distinction  between  appeal  and  review.  If  one"
"appeals against a decision, one is claiming that the decision"
"is  wrong  and 
that  appellate  authority  or  court  should"
"change the decision. The Court of Appeal, if it is persuaded"
"by  the  merits  of  the  case  (appeal),  may  allow  the  appeal"
"and  thereby  substitute 
its  view  for  that  of  the  Court  or"
"tribunal  of  first  instance.  Under  judicial  review  procedure,"
"the Court of Appeal is not concerned  with the  merits of the"
"case, that is,  whether the decision  was right or  wrong, but"
"whether  the decision  is lawful or not.  In  the  words of Lord"
"Brightman: 
""Judicial 
review 
is  concerned,  not  with 
the"
"decision  but  with 
the  decision  making  process"" 
(Chief"
"Constable  of  North  Wales  Police  v.  Evans  [1982]  1  WLR"
"1155  at  1173) 
It 
is  worth  observing 
that 
the 
review"
"procedure  is  not  well  suited  to  determination  of  disputed"
"facts-factual issues arising in this case being imprecise and"
"disputed."
