"the  petitioner 
that 
the  32nd 
respondent  does  not  have  a"
"postgraduate  degree  in  Buddhist  Studies  and  therefore  he  is"

"in law and fact."
"The next point of the petitioner is that the 32nd respondent does"
"not have a good knowledge of oriental languages as, according to"
"the  curriculum  vitae  marked  P5,  the  32nd  respondent  has  only"
"Grade B for Pali in G.C.E. (A/L) examination, and  has obtained"
"only  the  Pracheena  Praramba  qualifications  at  the  G.C.E.  (O/L)"
"and (A/L) examinations for Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit."
"It is noteworthy that, according to section 7(1)(b),  the applicant"
"shall only possess “a good knowledge of oriental languages”.  The"
"applicant  need  not  have  paper  qualifications  for  that  purpose."
"Hence, the contention of the petitioner that the 32nd respondent"

is  relevant

"Uththarithara Sabhawa shall examine the educational and other"
"qualifications 
of 
the 
Bhikku 
applicants

"recommend  the  name  of  one  Bhikku  applicant  to  the  President"
"to be appointed as Mahopadyaya."
"What are “the other qualifications” the 32nd  respondent possess,"
"which  the  petitioner  in  paragraph  15  of  the  counter  affidavit"
"says “irrelevant”."
