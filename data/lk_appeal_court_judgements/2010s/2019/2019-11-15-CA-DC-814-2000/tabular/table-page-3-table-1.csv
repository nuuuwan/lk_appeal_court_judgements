"a
bout three years to find that the defendant is in possession of"
"the land.  The defendant admitted in evidence that the plaintiff’s"
"houses  were  burnt  during  that  turbulent  period1  (not  by  him),"
"and  he  (the  defendant)  served  a  jail  sentence  of  nearly  5  years"
"for burning houses which belonged to Tamil people during those"
"riots.2"
"I cannot understand why the learned District Judge, first having"
"come to the conclusion that the plaintiff is the owner of Lot 1204"

"failure

the 
plaintiff’s  action  on"
"defendant himself in evidence has clearly admitted that he lives"
"on  the  land  which  is  the  subject  matter  of  this  case3,  and  also"
"the  counsel  for  the  defendant  has  cross  examined  the  plaintiff"
"on the basis that the defendant lives on the land in suit.4"
"It  is  my  considered  view  that  the  learned  District  Judge  has"
"misdirected himself on that point."
"In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  plaintiff  has"
"proved  that  the  defendant  is  in  possession  of  the  land  in  suit."
"This is further made clear when one considers the defence of the"
"defendant.    His  defence  was  that  he  has  acquired  prescriptive"
"title  to  the  land,  which  the  learned  District  Judge  held  not  to"
"have been proved."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons, 
I  set  aside  the  Judgment  of  the"
"District Court and enter Judgment as prayed for in the prayer to"
"the plaint except damages."
