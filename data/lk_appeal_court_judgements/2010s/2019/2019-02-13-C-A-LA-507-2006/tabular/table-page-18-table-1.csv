"miscarriage of justice."
"Ranesinge v. Henry (1896) 1 NLR 303 Bonser C.J. stated:"
"This  appeal  should  be  dismissed,  on 
the  ground 
that  no"
"appeal 
lies 
from  a  claim  order.  But  Mr.  De  Saram,  who"
"appeared  for  the  creditor  appellant,  has  asked  us  to  take  up"
"the case in revision, following the precedent of a case recently"
"decided by this Court (DC, Jaffna, No. 24,021, Civil Min. S.C.,"
"Oct.  10,  1895).  The  ground  on  which  he  asks  us  to  exercise"
"our revisionary power is, that the District Judge has made an"
"order  condemning  him  in  costs,  which  order,  he  urges,  is,  on"
"the face of the proceedings, wrong."
