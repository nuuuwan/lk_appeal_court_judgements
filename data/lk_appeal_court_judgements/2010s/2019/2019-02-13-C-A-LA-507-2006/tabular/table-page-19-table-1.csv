"The  Supreme  Court  possesses 
the  power 
to  set  aside, 
in"
"revision,  an  erroneous  decision  of  the  District  Court 
in  an"
"appropriate case even though an appeal against such decision"
"has been correctly held to have abated on the ground of non-"

"of the notice of security."
"In Saheeda Umma v. Haniffa [1999] 1 Sri LR 150 the application for"
"restitutio  in  integrum  filed  by  the  plaintiff-petitioner  could  not  be"
"successful  as  it  was  prescribed.    Nevertheless,  as  there  was  a"
"serious  injustice  caused  to  the  petitioner,  Asoka  de  Silva  J.  (later"
"C.J.) with Weerasuriya J. agreeing ex mero motu granted the relief"
"invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court:"

"case of this nature.  Even  though  the plaintiff-petitioners have"
"not invoked the revisionary jurisdiction we propose to exercise"
"the  Revisionary  powers 
in 
favour 
of 
the  2nd  plaintiff-"
"petitioner."
