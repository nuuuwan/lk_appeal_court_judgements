"","n Daniel v. Chandradeva [1994] 2 Sri LR 1 at 8-9 on behalf of the"
"Supreme Court Justice Amarasinghe observed:",""
"","The  relationship  of  attorney  and  client  is  much  more  than  an"
"ordinary 
contractual","relationship. 
It 
does 
not 
terminate"
"automatically  upon","the  non-payment  of 
fees.  Nor  can 
it  be"
"abruptly 
terminated.  An  attorney","is 
ordinarily 
justified 
in"
"","withdrawing  if  the  client  fails  or  refuses  to  pay  or  secure  the"
"","proper  fees  or  expenses  of  the  attorney  after  being  reasonably"
"requested","to  do  so,  provided  his  right  of  withdrawal 
is  not"
"","exercised at a moment at which the client may be unable to find"
"","other legal assistance in time to prevent damage being done. An"
"Attorney 
is  obliged","to  protect  his  client's 
interests  as  far  as"
"","possible  and  should  not  desert  the  client  at  a  critical  stage  of  a"
"","matter when the withdrawal would put the client in a position of"
"disadvantage 
or","peril.  An 
attorney 
should  not 
summarily"
"","withdraw from a case or matter he has undertaken. He must not"
"","suddenly  decide  to  cease  to  act  for  the  client  and  jettison  him."
"","The attorney must give his client reasonable warning that he will"
"","withdraw unless the client fulfils his obligations. The respondent"
"","gave  no  warning  of  her  inability  to  continue  as  the  Registered"
"","Attorney  on  account  of  the  client's failure  to  pay  her fees.  If  she"
"","was unwilling  to continue  the  professional  account  of the failure"
"","of the complainant to pay her fees, she should have taken steps"
"","to have her proxy revoked after warning the client and giving him"
"a reasonable time to appoint another Registered Attorney.",""
