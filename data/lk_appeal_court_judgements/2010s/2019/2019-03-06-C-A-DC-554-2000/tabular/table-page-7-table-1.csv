"As  I  stated  earlier,  the  main  concern  of  the  learned  District"
"Judge was the failure of the plaintiff in the instant action not to"
"disclose the name of Maria as a child of Annochchi Silva and the"
"devolution of title to that share.  The devolution of title of Maria’s"
"share  has  been  described  in  paragraphs  23-29  of  the  plaint"
"P17.11  According to those paragraphs, Maria’s rights ultimately"
"has  gone 
to  W.  Appusingho,  who  appears 
to  be 
the  15th"
"defendant  in  that  case.12    Upon  his  death,  it  appears  that  16th"
"defendant  has  been  substituted.13    However,  it  is  interesting  to"
"note that, both in paragraph 39 of the plaint P17 and the Final"
"Decree  P18,  15th  or  16th  defendant  has  not  been  given  any"
"rights―whether  Maria’s  or  otherwise. 
  That  means  Maria’s"
"alleged share has not been considered by some reason.  If that is"
"correct, the plaintiff in the instant action cannot be found fault"
"with for non-disclosure of Maria’s alleged share."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons, 
I  set  aside  the  Judgment  of  the"
"learned District Judge dated 29.08.2000."
"The  plaintiff  has  instituted  this  action  in  the  District  Court  28"
"years ago in 1991.  It is not practically possible to order a retrial"
"as the plaintiff if still alive will not be able to give evidence due to"
"his  old  age.    Same  shall  be  true  about  the  47A  defendant  who"
"gave  evidence 
for 
the  contesting  defendants. 
  The  present"
"generation has no knowledge of these old pedigrees."
"In a partition case, in terms of section 25(1) of the Partition Law,"
"it is the paramount duty of the District Judge to investigate title"
