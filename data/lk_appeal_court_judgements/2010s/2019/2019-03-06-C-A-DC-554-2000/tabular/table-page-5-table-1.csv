"With  the  greatest  of  respect  to  the  learned  District  Judge,  I  am"
"unable  to  accept  that  reasoning  for  the  dismissal  of  a  partition"
"action.  As the learned counsel for the 22nd and 27th respondents"
"has  correctly  pointed  out  in  his  written  submissions,  whether"
"Annochchi  Silva  had 
five  children  or  six  children 
is  not  a"
"contradiction which justifies dismissal of the partition action.  If"
"the 
learned  District 
Judge 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that"
"Annochchi  Silva  had  six  children  (including  Maria)  and  not  five"
"children as stated by the plaintiff, the learned Judge could have"
"left  those  shares  which  should  have  gone  to  Maria  unallotted."
"This  is  applicable  not  only  to  Maria’s  rights,  but  to  any  others’"
"rights, 
the  devolution  of  which,  has  not  been  satisfactorily"
"explained.  In a partition action of this nature it is not possible"
"for 
the  plaintiff 
to  present  one  hundred  percent  complete"
"pedigree."
"The learned District Judge has found the pedigree of the plaintiff"
"to  be  incorrect  or  incomplete  in  the  light  of  the  contents  of  the"
"plaint in a former partition case marked P17.  It is significant to"
"note that P17 was produced not by the contesting defendants to"
"contradict the plaintiff’s pedigree, but by the plaintiff himself.  If"
"the plaintiff had any mala fide intention or conceal something to"
"deprive  somebody’s  due  rights,  he  could  have  withheld  it.    In"
"fact,  P17  has  been  produced  by  the  plaintiff  in  re-examination,"
"and 
the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  contesting  defendants  has"
"objected  it  being  produced  in  evidence  but  the  learned  District"
"Judge  has  allowed  it.8    That  means,  the  contesting  defendants"
"do not admit the pedigree described in P17.  Nor do they accept"
"the  pedigree  stated  by  the  plaintiff  in  the  plaint  in  the  instant"
