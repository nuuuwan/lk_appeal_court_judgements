"The  first  and  second  grounds  of appeal  are  that the  Council  did  not take  into"
"consideration  the  explanations  offered  by  the  Appellant.  As  observed  earlier,"
"the complaint of Nizamdeen  was  that the Appellant  had  issued  copies  of Plan"
"No.  3019  marked 
'02'  and 
'03' 
in 
respect  of  Lot  No.  3/\  and  Lot  No.  3B,"
"respectively,  depicting  boundaries  that  were  different  from  the  boundaries"
"shown 
in 
the  original  Plan  No.  3019  marked 
'01'.  The  Appellant's 
initial"
"letter  dated  16t h  October  2015  amounted  to  an 
explanation,  offered  by  his"
"admission  of the  complaint  against  him. 
It  was  only  after  clarifications  were"
"sought that the Appelant denied the  issuing of the certified copies  marked  '02'"
"and  '03',  and  took  up  the  position  that the  land  is  not  owned  by  Nizardeen."
"However,  the  complainant  had  produced  the  certified  copies  of  such  Plans"
"thus  rebutting  the  position taken  up  by 
before the  Council  on  2ih May 2016/"
"the  Appellant 
that  he  did  not  issue  certified  copies  of  'D2'  and 
'03' .  The"
"explanation  offered  by  the  Appellant,  which 
is  one  of  denial,  has  therefore"
"been  rejected  by  the  Council,  and  hence,  this  Court  is  of the  view  that  the"
"argument of the Appellant that the Council  did  not take  into consideration the"
"explanations offered by the Appellant has no merit."
