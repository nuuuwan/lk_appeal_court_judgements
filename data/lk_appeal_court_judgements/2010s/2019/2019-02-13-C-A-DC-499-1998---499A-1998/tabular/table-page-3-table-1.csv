"3"
"dispute as well as a pedigree dispute.  The pedigree dispute was"
"contested  intensely  whereby  several  groups  of  defendants  came"
"out  with  different  pedigrees. 
  After  trial  the 
learned  District"
"Judge in his Judgment accepted the plaintiff’s version in relation"
"to  both  the  disputes.    The  14th,  15th  and  17th  defendants;  and"
"24th defendant have appealed against the Judgment."
"Only the 15A defendant-appellant, 24th defendant-appellant and"
"substituted  plaintiff-respondent  participated  in  the  argument."
"When  this  matter  came  before  me  for  the  first  time,  learned"
"counsel  for  the  said  parties  invited  the  Court  to  dispose  of  the"
"argument by way of written submissions."
"It 
is 
the  submission  of 
the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  15A"
"defendant-appellant,  Dr.  Cooray,  that  “the  case  must  be  sent"
"back to the District Court to enter a legally correct judgment on the"
"oral and documentary evidence led at the trial in this case” as the"
"Judgment  entered  by  the 
learned  District  Judge 
is  ex  facie"
"erroneous. 
 
I 
totally  agree. 
  This  Court  cannot  rewrite 
the"
"District  Court  Judgment.  I  express  my  gratitude  to  Dr.  Cooray"
"for not insisting on a retrial.  The case had been filed in 1976 in"
"the District Court and the Judgment has been entered 21 years"
"later in 1997.  Now we are in 2019.  Between then and now 43"
"years have passed by, and it will be a crime to send the case for"
"retrial as there will not be anyone in the present generation who"
"can speak about the pedigree."
"At the trial the substituted plaintiff, Chalo Singho, who was the"
"son of the original plaintiff, has given evidence.  According to the"
"pedigree  of  the  plaintiff  as  set  out  in  the  plaint,  Sinnappu  was"
"the original owner of the land.  His rights have devolved on only"
"son  Abeynis,  who  had 
five 
children,  Haramanis,  Davith,"
