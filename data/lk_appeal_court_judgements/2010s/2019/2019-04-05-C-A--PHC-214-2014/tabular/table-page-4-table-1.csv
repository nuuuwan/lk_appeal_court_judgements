"any possession before that date."

"have bought from Hapangama was an abandoned house, which"
"has  not  been  used  for  a  long  time  by  anybody.7    That  means,"
"Hapangama had not been in possession of the disputed portion"
"of the land before."

"been forcibly dispossessed from the disputed portion of the land"
"by the appellant within two months immediately before the filing"
"of  the  first  information  in  Court,  and  therefore  the  respondent"
"was  entitled  to  be  restored  in  possession  in  terms  of  section"
"68(3) of the Act."
"Appeal is dismissed with costs."
