"In  Tunnaya  alias Gunapala  v.  O!ficer-in-Charge,  Police Station, Galewela [(1993) 1 Sri  L.R.  61 at 66J",""
"Bandaranayake J.  stated:",""
"","""A  consideration ofthe meaning and scope of s.  116 and  of s.  136 (1)  (d)  ofthe Code thus"
"","becomes  necessary. Section  116 is  a section  contained  in  that  part of the  Code  dealing"
"with  the  investigation  of  offences  and  the  powers  of  Police  Officers  and","inquirers  to"
"","investigate. It is  a step in the process of investigation . It is the counterpart of s.  114 which"
"","permits the release  of an  accused  if evidence  is  deficient. Section  116 (1)  requires that a"
"","suspect be  sent in  custody to a Magistrate's Court with jurisdiction when the information"
"","is well founded in the case of a non-bailable offence. That is to say that the suspect should"
"","be  so  forwarded  when the Police  Officer or inquirer comes to a conclusion  that there  is"
"","sufficient evidence in the sense that a sub stantial case  is  made out at an  ea rly stage of an"
"","investigation  which  can  properly be  sent  before a Magistrate.  Thereafter it is  necessary"
"","for the Magistrate to make an  order for the detention of the suspect.  On the other hand,"
"","if the  offence  is  bailable the section  even  permits the  Police  Officer  or inquirer to take"
"","security from the suspect for his  appearance  before  Court.  The  section  also  provides for"
"","productions to be sent to the Court immediately without being kept at the Police Station"
"","for further investigations if necessary,  and  for witnesses to be  bound over to appear and"
"","testify at a trial. The fact that the Police can take bail and release the suspect if the offence"
"","is  bailable under sub-section (1)  and  the fact that investigations can  continue under sub"
"","section  (3)  and  the use  of the word  ""suspect ""  and  not ""accused""  in  the  language  of sub"
"","section (1)  used to refer to this person clearly point to the fact that no proceeding has yet"
"been 
instituted  against","that  person  as  an  accused.  Producing  a  suspect  before  a"
"","Magistrate's Court in  custody in terms of s.  116 (1)  has nothing to do with the institution"
"","of proceedings under s.  136 (l)(d) of Chapter XIV or any other clause  of that section. The"
"","purpose of producing a suspect before a Court for a non-bailable offence under s.  116(1)"
"","is  both for the  purpose of detaining such a person  as  well  as  enabling the  Court to take"
"","cognisance of the matter enabling it to make further orders under the section  as  a Court"
"","order is necessary for expert witnesses to examine productions and express opinions. The"
"","provisions  of s.  116  (1)  usua lly  denote  the  completion  of  a  Policeman's  investigative"
"","endeavours. The  Magistrate once se ized  of the  matter may then  require further probing"
"","by  forensic  experts  of  evidence  already  gathered;  the  findings  and  opinions  of  such"
"specially skil led persons may tend to confirm the State's case  against the prisoner.",""
