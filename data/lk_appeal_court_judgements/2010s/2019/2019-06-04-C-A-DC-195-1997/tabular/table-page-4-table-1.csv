pportioning  that  30  perches  to  the  12th  defendant―vide  page"
"346  of  the  Brief.    I  must  emphasize  that  this  she  stated  in  her"
"evidence 
in 
chief 
and 
not 
during 
the 
course 
of 
cross"
"examination."
"Although  both 
the 
learned  Judge  and 
the  2(a)  defendant"
"accepted 
that 
the  12th  defendant 
is  entitled 
to  30  perches,"
"ultimately,  the  learned  District  Judge  in  the  Judgment  has  not"
"given effect to it.  In the Judgment the 12th defendant has been"
"given about 8 perches."
"According  to  the  Judgment,  excluding  1  ½  acres, 
from  the"
"balance  portion  of 
the  corpus, 
the  2nd  defendant  shall  get"
"150/1008  share  and 
the  12th  defendant  as 
I  stated  earlier"
"12/1008 share.  (In addition, according to the Judgment, the 2nd"
"defendant  gets  93/672  share  from  1  acre.)    If  Emalin  did  not"
"execute  5D6, 
the  2nd  defendant  would  also  have  got 
the"
"aforesaid 12/1008 share given to the 12th defendant making the"
"2nd  defendant’s 
share 
to 
increase  up 
to  162/1008 
share"
"(150/1008+12/1008=162/1008)."
"As  some  portions  of  the  land  depicted  in  the  Preliminary  Plan"
"have  been  excluded 
in  accordance  with 
the  1st  admission"
"recorded,  it  is  not  possible  at  this  stage  to  state  exactly  the"
"fractional share for 30 perches."
"Taking 
all 
the 
circumstances 
into 
account, 
including 
the"
"voluntary admissions made by the 2(a) defendant in evidence, I"
"decide  that  out  of  such  162/1008  share,  which  should  have"
"gone  to  the  2nd  defendant,  30  perches  shall  go  to  the  12th"
"defendant."
