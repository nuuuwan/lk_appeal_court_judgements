"T
he deceased Petitioner (K.G. Jothipala) who is neither a creditor"
"nor a contributory was said to be the highest bidder for rupees"
"thirty million at the time of closing the tender."
"After  such  closure,  the  said  Bank  has  made  a  bid  to  buy  the"
"said property for rupees thirty one million."
"Thereafter the liquidator without notice to any party has referred"
"the  matter  to  the  District  Court  seeking  instructions,  and  the"
"Court  by  bench  order  dated  15.10.2004  has  directed  to  award"
"the tender to the Petitioner."
"The liquidator has thereafter by letter dated 29.10.2004 awarded"
"the tender to the Petitioner."
"Before  the  Petitioner  accepting  the  said  award  and  settling  the"
"Bid  Price,  the  Bank  has  made  an  application  to  the  District"
"Court by Petition dated 01.11.2004 to suspend the said order to"
"sell  the  property 
for  rupees  thirty  million,  and  to  order  the"
"property to be sold by public auction.  One of the reasons given"
"by  the  Bank  to  make  that  application  is  that  the  liquidator"
"himself  valued  the  said  property  in  the  year  2000  for  rupees"
"hundred  million.  This  application  has  been 
supported  on"
"03.11.2004 and the Court has suspended the sale."
"The  Petitioner  has  objected  to  the  application  of  the  Bank  to"
"again sell the property by public auction.  His position had been"
"that 
in  accordance  with  the  earlier  order  of  the  Court,  the"
"property shall be sold to him as the highest lawful bidder."
"Thereafter the liquidator has agreed to hold a public auction to"
"sell  the  property  as  a  result  of  a  settlement  reached  with  the"
"Bank to which the Petitioner was not a party."
