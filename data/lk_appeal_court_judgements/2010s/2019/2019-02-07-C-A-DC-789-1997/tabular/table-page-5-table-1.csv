"hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner there can be no"
"adverse  possession  In  deciding  whether  the  alleged  acts  of  the"
"person constitute adverse possession, regard must be had to the"
"animus  of 
the  person  doing 
those  acts,  and 
this  must  be"
"ascertained  from  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case  and"
"the 
relationship  of 
the  parties.  Possession  which  may  be"
"presumed to be adverse in the case of a stranger may not attract"
"such  a  presumption,  in  the  case  of  persons  standing  in  certain"
"social  or 
legal  relationships.  The  presumption  represents  the"
"most  likely  inference  that  may  be  drawn  in  the  context  of  the"
"relationship  of 
the  parties.  The  Court  will  always  attribute"
"possession  to  a  lawful  title  where  that  is  possible.  Where  the"
"possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be assumed,"
"in  the  absence  of  evidence,  that  the  possession  is  lawful.  Thus,"
"where property belonging to the  mother is held by the son,  the"
"presumption will be that the enjoyment of the son was on behalf"
"of  and  with  the  permission  of  the  mother.  Such  permissive"
"possession 
is  not 
in  denial  of  the  title  of  the  mother  and 
is"
"consequently not adverse to her. It will not enable the possession"
"to acquire title by adverse possession."
"Where  possession 
commenced  with  permission, 
it  will  be"
"presumed  to  so  continue  until  and  unless  something  adverse"
"occurred about it. The onus is on the licencee to show when and"
"how the possession became adverse. Continued appropriation of"
"the income and payment of taxes will not be sufficient to convert"
"permissive  possession 
into  adverse  possession,  unless 
such"
"conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the perimeterâ€™s title. In"
"order to discharge such onus, there must be clear and affirmative"
