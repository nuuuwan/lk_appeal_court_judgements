"right, title or interest, has two hurdles to surmount. First"
"he has to satisfy court, in terms of subsection (c) that (i)"
"having    filed  his  statement  of  claim  and    registered  his"
"address,  he 
failed 
to  appear  at 
the 
trial  owing 
to"
"accident, misfortune or other unavoidable  cause, and (ii)"
"that  he  had  a  prima  facie  right,  title   or  interest    in  the"
"corpus, and (iii) that such right , title or interest  has been"
"extinguished 
or 
such 
party 
has 
been 
otherwise"
"prejudicially affected  by the interlocutory  decree. Then"
"only  the  court  will  grant  special 
leave.  After  granting"
"special  leave,  in  terms  of  subsection  (d),  the  court  will"
"settle in the form of issues the questions of fact and law"
"arising from the pleadings relevant to the claim and then"
"appoint  a  day  for  trial  and  determination  of  the  issues."
"The  second  hurdle  the  party  has  to  surmount 
is  the"
"determination  of  those 
issues  by  court  after  trial, 
in"
"terms of sub-section (e)."
"The  order  appealed  from  is  an  order  made  against  the"
"appellant at the first hurdle.  Can one say that the order"
"made on the application of the 4th defendant is one such"
"that  whichever  way  the  order  was  given,  it  would  have"
"finally  determined  the  litigation?  Far  from  that,  even  if"
"the order was given in favour of the appellant, he has to"
"face  he  second  hurdle,  namely  the  trial  to  vindicate  his"
"claim‚Äù"
