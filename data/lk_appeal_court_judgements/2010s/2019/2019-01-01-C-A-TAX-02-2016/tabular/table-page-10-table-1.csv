"","The  purpose  of accounting  is  usually  to  provide  information  to  interested  parties  relevant  to"
"","stewardship,  control  and  decision-making.  The 
requirements  of  a  tax  system  can  be  quite"
"","different. In  Thor Power Tools  Company v.  Commissioner of Internal Revenue  [58l Ed.  2d.785 at"
"","802  (1979)] the US Supreme Court stated:"
"","""The primary goal offinancial accounting is to provide useful information to management,"
"","shareholders,  creditors,  and  others  properly  interested;  the  major  responsibility  of the"
"","accountant is to protect these parties from being misled. The  primary goal of the income"
"","tax system, in  contrast, is the equitable collection of revenue; the major responsibility of"
"","the Internal  Revenue  Service  is  to protect the public fisc.  Consistently with  its goals  and"
"","responsibilities, financial  accounting has  as  its foundation the principle of conservatism,"
"","with  its  corollary  that  'possible  errors  in  measurement  [should]  be  in  the  direction  of"
"","understatement rather than overstatement of net income and  net assets'.  In  view of the"
"","Treasury's markedly different goals and responsibilities,  understatement of income is  not"
"","destined to  be  its guiding light.  Given  this  diversity,  even  contrariety of objectives,  any"
"","presumptive equivalency between tax and financial accounting would be  unacceptable""."
"","Accordingly, I reject the submission of the Appellant that any inconsistency between the financial"
"","accounting practices and taxing provisions must be avoided."
"","For the reasons  aforesaid, Court answers the following questions of law as follows:"
"","(1)  Was  the  assessment  no.  ITA  12301100040V1  dated  30th  November  2012(which  is  the"
"","subject  matter of this  appeal)  invalid  in  law  by  reason  of the  previous  assessment  no."
"","6476576  VO  dated  6th  May  2011  having  been

"","assessment 2009/2010? No."
"","(2)  Was  the  assessment  for the  year  2009/2010  dated  30th  November 2012  issued  against"
"","the Appellant in any case time barred in terms of Section 163(5)(a) of the Inland Revenue"
"","Act  No.  10 of 2006 (as  amended)  (the  ""IRA"")  as  applicable to such  year of assessment?"
