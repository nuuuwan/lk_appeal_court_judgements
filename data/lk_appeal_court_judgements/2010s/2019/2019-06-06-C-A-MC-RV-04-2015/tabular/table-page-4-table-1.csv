"A
gainst this strong evidence, nay admissions, it is distressing to"
"note  that  the  Magistrate  has  acquitted  the  respondent  from  all"
"the charges."
"In  my  view,  with  that  evidence,  the  Magistrate  could  at  least"
"have  easily  convicted  the  respondent  under  section  25(1)(a)  of"
"the  Debt  Recovery 
(Special  Provisions)  Act,  which  reads  as"
"follows:"
"“Any 
person  who 
knowingly 
draws 
a 
cheque  which 
is"
"dishonoured  by  a  bank  for  want  of  funds  shall  be  guilty  of  an"
"offence  under  this  Act  and  shall  on  conviction  by  a  Magistrate"
"after summary trial be liable to punishment with imprisonment of"
"either description for a term which may extend to one year or with"
"fine of ten thousand rupees or ten per centum of the full value of"
"the cheque, order,  authority or  inland bill  in respect  of  which  the"
"offence  is  committed,  whichever  is  higher,  or  with  both  such  fine"
"and imprisonment.”"
"In 
connection  with 
instituting 
criminal  proceedings  under"
"section  25  of  the  Debt  Recovery  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  the"
"Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  OIC,  CID  v.  Soris  [2006]  3  Sri  LR"
"375  at 381 stated that: “We, accordingly,  are  mindful of the fact"
"that the Debt Recovery Act as amended, was necessitated by the"
"expansion  of  commercial 
transactions  and 
that  a  prosecution"
"under the normal law was highly time consuming and protracted.”"
"The  Judgment  of  the  Magistrate’s  Court 
is  set  aside  and  a"
"conviction  under  section  25(1)(a)  of  the  Debt  Recovery  (Special"
"Provisions) Act is entered in respect of count Nos. 1, 4 and 7 of"
"the Charge Sheet."
