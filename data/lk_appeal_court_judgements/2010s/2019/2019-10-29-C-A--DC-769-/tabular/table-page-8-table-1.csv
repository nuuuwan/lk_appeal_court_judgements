"Therefore, I hold that non-execution of the writ of possession  does not prevent the successors of"
"G.  D.  Clarice  from  claiming  the  ownership  of the sa id  land s by  virtue  of the  judgment  in  D.  C."
"Panadura Case  No.  12417."
"The  10th  defendant further submitted that he has been  in  possession of the said  land s since 1973"
"and  has  acquired  prescriptive titl e to the sa id  lands."
"A judgment-debtor against whom  a decree for ejectment from  a land  has  been  passed  acquires"
"a right to a decree  under Section  3 of the  Prescription  Ordinance  if,  despite  attempts  made  at"
"execution of writ, he continues to remain on the land for a period of over 10 years after the date"
"of the decree without doin g any act by which he directly or indirectly acknowledges a right in the"
"judgment-creditor or any other person  [Samuel v.  Dharmasiri (62  N.L.R.  50S)]."
"It is  clear,  by the  evidence  both  documentary and  oral  of the  plaintiff,  that  rates  to the  urban"
"council  regarding the said  lands were paid  by him since  1973. Initially, the 10th  defendant stated"
"in  his evidence that he  paid  the  rates for both  lands.  However,  no evidence was  led to establish"
"the  position  taken  up  by  him.  Also,  the evidence  shows that the  10th  defendant has  agreed  to"
"accept  alternative  accommodation  provided  by the plaintiff.  He  has  not only made a statement"
"to the Mediation Board in 1976 but also made a statement to the police that he is willing to move"
"into the  house  constructed  by th e plaintiff.  During the trial, the 10th  defendant has  stated  that"
"the  said  police  statement  was  reco rded  under  duress.  However,  no  evidence  was  led  to show"
"that the 10th  defendant attempted or made a complaint to the relevant authorities regarding the"
"alleged  duress exerted on  him."
"Therefore,  I hold that the learned  District Judge  is  correct in  holding that the 10th  defendant has"
"failed to estab lish  his prescriptive title to the sa id  lands."
"For  the foregoing reasons,  I hold that the  10th  defendant  had  no  title whatsoever to convey to"
"the 12th defendant by Deed  No.  235 dated 02.02.1989."
"The  11th defendant claims  undivided five  (OS)  perches  under and  by virtue of Deed  No.  72  dated"
