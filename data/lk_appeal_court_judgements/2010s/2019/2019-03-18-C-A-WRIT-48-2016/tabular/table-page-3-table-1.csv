"application 
as 
respondents 
seeking

of  mandamus"
"directing the Divisional Secretary to transfer the land in issue to"
"the 4th respondent.  That application has been dismissed by this"
"Court  by  Judgment  dated  30.04.2014  on  the  basis  that  when"
"the facts are in dispute this Court cannot compel the Divisional"
"Secretary to decide in favour of the 4th respondent."
"It is relevant to note that the aforesaid writ application was filed"
"after  the  inquiry  before  the  Divisional  Secretary  and  after  his"
"decision  that  he 
is  unable  to  decide  on  the  matter. 
  These"
"decisions  are  part  of  the  aforesaid  writ  application.  (The  entire"
"case has been marked as X)"
"It is noteworthy that this Court did not dismiss that application"
"on  the  basis  that  the  4th  respondent  to  the  present  application"
"did  not  prove  that  her 
late  husband  was  the  eldest  son  of"
"Appuhamy and Ran Manike or the 2nd petitioner proved that her"
"late husband was the eldest son of Appuhamy and Ran Manike,"
"but  because  the  question  of  who  the  eldest  son  was  still  in"
"dispute  and  undecided.    The  situation  has  not  changed  up  to"
"now.    In  that  Judgment  this  Court  has  observed  that  the  said"
"question  could  be  solved  by  obtaining  a  declaration  from  the"
"District Court."
"This Court cannot make a different order."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  states  that  in  terms  of"
"the  provisions  of 
the  Land  Development  Ordinance,  District"
"Court  is  not  vested  with  jurisdiction  to  decide  succession.    The"
"District  Court  need  not  decide  on  succession,  but  certainly  it"
