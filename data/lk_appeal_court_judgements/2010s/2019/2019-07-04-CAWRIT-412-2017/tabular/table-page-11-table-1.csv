"although  such  damage  occurred  during the time vehicle  was  in  the  custody of"
"the Petitioner."
"To  accept 
the  position  of  the  Petitioner 
that 
the  subject  matter  of  the"
"complaint  'P2'  is  outside the scope  of the contract would  lead  to an  absurdity"
"and  would  be  completely  contrary to  the  objective  of the  Act,  which  is  inter"
"to  protect 
innocent  consumers. 
If  the  argument  of  the  Petitioner 
is 
alia"
"accepted, 
it  would 
leave  room 
for  providers  of  a  service  to  be  completely"
"negligent in  relation to anything other than the ""scope of the service"" they are"
"required  to provide,  which  is  most certainly not what the  legislature  intended"
"through Section 32(1} of the Act. This Court therefore rejects the submission of"
"the  learned  Counsel  for the  Petitioner that the  1st  Respondent  does  not  have"
"the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the 4th  Respondent."
"The  second  limb  of the jurisdictional  objection  raised  by  the  learned  Counsel"
"for the  Petitioner  is  that 'P2'  has  been  lodged  outside the time  limit provided"
"by Section  32(3)  of the Act for the  making of complaints and  therefore, the 1st"
"Respondent is  estopped from considering the said complaint."
"Section  32(3) of the Act reads as follows:"
"""A  consumer aggrieved  by the  breach  of an  implied warranty as  provided"
"for  in  subsection  (1)  or  (2)  may  make  a  complaint  to  the  Authority  in"
"writing against  such  breach  within one  month of the supply of such  goods"
"or  the  provision  of  such  services  as 
the  case  may  be,  or  the  supply  of"
"materials supplied in  connection with the provision of those services."""
