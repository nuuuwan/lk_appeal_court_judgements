"implied  warranty that it would  exercise  ""due care  and  skiW'  in  the provision of"
"services,  namely the repairing of his vehicle."
"The  Petitioner  has  sought  to  argue  that  the  accident  which  was  the  subject"
"'P2',  was  outside 
the  scope  of  the  contract, 
matter  of  the  said  complaint"
"implied  or otherwise,  between fne-Pe1:TtToner  and -the 4th  Respondent.  It is  the"
"Petitioner's contention that Seâ‚¬ti~n 32{1}  is onry appHcabJe to the ""contract for"
"the supply of goods or for the provision of services""  and  that any duty to carry"
"out the  services  with  due  skill  and  care  only  extends  to the  scope  of the  said"
"contract.  The  Petitioner  states  that  the  contract  for the  provision  of services"
"was  to repair the engine of the vehicle  belonging to the 4th  Respondent,  which"
"was  carried  out  with  ""due  skill  and  care"", 
thus  satisfying  the  provisions  of"
"Section  32(1)(a}.  The  Petitioner  states  that  the  4th  Respondent  has  admitted"
"that the said  repair had  been conducted with due skill and  care because he  had"
"no  complaints  with  regard  to the  repair,  which  proves that the Petitioner duly"
"carried  out 
its  obligations  under 
the  contract  and 
thereby  satisfied 
the"
"provisions  of Section  32{1}  of the  Act.  It  is  thus  the  position  of the  Petitioner"
"that  the  accident  occurred  after  the  engine  repair  had  been  effected  and 
is"
"therefore outside the scope of the services that the  Petitioner was  required to"
"provide  under  the  contract.  On 
this  basis, 
the  Petitioner  states  that  the  4th"
"Respondent  had  no  right  to  make  a  complaint  to  the  1st  Respondent  under"
"Section  32(3)  for  breach  of contract  and  accordingly  the  1st  Respondent  does"
"not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint."
