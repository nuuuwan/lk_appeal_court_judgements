"","Coming back to the facts of this case,  it is  clear to this Court that the Petitioner"
"","has  been  made aware of the nature of the complaint made against it by the 4th"
"","Respondent,  for the  reason  that a copy  of the  complaint  'P2'  was  sent  to the"
"","Petitioner together  with  'P3'.  It  is  also  clear  that  the  1st  Respondent  held  an"
"","inquiry  into  the  complaint  of the  4th  Respondent.  However,  no  material  has"
"","been  placed  before  this  Court  that  adequate  notice  of the  inquiry  that  was"
"","held  on  2ih  April  2017  was  given  to  the  Petitioner  thus  depriving  it  of the"
"","opportunity to participate at the inquiry. Even though the background facts are"

in  agreement  with 
the  submission  of  the

admitted, 
this  Court"
"","Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  that  it  was  not  informed  of the  hearing  that  was"
"","held  on  2ih April  2017 and  thus,  was  not afforded  a hearing at which  it could"
"","have  placed 
its  side  of  the  story. 
If  the  Petitioner  was  absent  on  2ih  April"
"","2017,  the  1st  Respondent  could  very well  have  re-fixed  the inquiry for an  early"
"","date  and 
informed  the  Petitioner  to  be  present  on  the  next  date,  especially"
"","since the Petitioner had  honoured the notices 'P3' and  'P4'  and  participated at"
"","the  discussions.  The 
fact  that  the  1st  Respondent  need  not  have  rushed 
is"
"","evident  when  one  considers  the  fact  that  'PSb'  was  dispatched  almost  five"
"","months after 2ih April 2017."
