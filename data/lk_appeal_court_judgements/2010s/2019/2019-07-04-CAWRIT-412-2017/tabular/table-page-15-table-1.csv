"specified  under the Act.  For these reasons,  this Court does not see  any merit in"
"the said  argument of the Petitioner."
"The  next  argument of the  learned  Counsel  for the  Petitioner is  that the  Order"
"'PS(b),  was  issued without following the rules of natural justice and  is thus,  bad"
"in  law  and 
liable  to  be  quashed  by  way  of a  Writ  of Certiorari.  The  learned"
"Counsel  for the Petitioner has  specifically raised  the following three matters in"
"this regard:"
"a. 
No  proper 
inquiry  was  conducted  by 
the  1st  Respondent 
in 
terms  of"
"Section 32{4} of the Act;"
"b. 
The  Petitioner was  not given the  right to be  heard  by the 1st  Respondent,"
"in 
that 
the  Petitioner  did  not  receive  notice  of  the 
inquiry  allegedly"
"conduCted  on  2ih April  2017  and  thus  was  not afforded the  opportunity"
"of being heard as  per Section 32{4} of the Act;"
"c. 
No reasons were provided for the decision of the 1st  Respondent."
"The  provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act  pre-suppose  that once  a"
"complaint is  made to the 1st  Respondent, an  inquiry should  be  held where both"
"parties are given the opportunity of being heard. This is  set out in Section 32{4}"
"of the Act which states as follows:"
"""At  any 
inquiry  held 
into  a  complaint  made  under  subsection  (3), 
the"
"the 
trader  or  other  person  against  whom 
the 
Authority  shall  give"
