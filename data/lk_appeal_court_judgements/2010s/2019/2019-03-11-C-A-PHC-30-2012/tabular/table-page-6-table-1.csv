"In  Beatrice Perera vs.  The  Commissioner of National Housing  (77  N.L.R.  361) the court made the"
"following observation:"
"""Lack of competency may arise in  one of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction over the"
"cause or matter or over the parties;  it may also lack competence because of failure  to"
"comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by"
"the Court.  Both are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly known"
"in  the law as  a  ' patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the"
"second a ' latent' or ' contingent' want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis."" (emphasis"
"added)"
"Accordingly,  I hold that the jurisdictional  objection  raised  by the  Respondent  impugns  a latent"
"lack  of jurisdiction  on  the  part  of this  court.  The  side  note  to  Rule  4  of  the  Court  of Appeal"
"(Procedure for Appeals from  High  Courts established  by Article  154 P of the Constitution)  Rules"
"reads  as 
'What  Petition  of  Appeal  shall  state'.  Therefore,  the  said 
rule  clearly  deals  with  a"
"procedural  requirement that is  necessary for the exercise  of powers by the Court of Appeal.  An"
"objection  pertaining  to  such 
latent  or  contingent  want  of jurisdiction  must  be  raised  at  the"
"earliest available opportunity by the party relying on  it."
