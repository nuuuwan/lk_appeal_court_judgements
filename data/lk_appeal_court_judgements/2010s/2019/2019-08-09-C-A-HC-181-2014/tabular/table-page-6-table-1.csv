"Thus,  it is  apparent  that the  trial  Court had  clear evidence before  it"
"as  to  what was sealed  by  the  police after  the detection and what had been"

"The finding of P5  along with  the  other polythene bags could not therefore"
"be considered as a  defect in  the inward productions chain and therefore is"
"insufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to  the identity of the parcel sent"
"for analysis."
