"","The  learned counsel for the Appellant urged the following grounds in appeal:"
"","(a)  The learned District Judge failed to analyze the documentary evidence establishing"
"","the title of the Appellant before proceeding to decide on the issue of prescription"
"","(b)  The learned District Judge erred in concluding that the Respondents had prescribed"
"","to the land in dispute"
"","Paper Title vs Prescriptive Title"
"","The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that when paper title and  prescriptive title are"
"","raised in relation to a land dispute the Court must first determine the paper title. The decision in"
"","A.M. Karunadasa v.  Abdul Hameed (60 N.L.R.  352) was relied on where it was  held:"
"","""in a rei vindicatio action, it is  highly dangerous to adjudicate on an  issue of prescription"
"","without first going into and examining the documentary title of parties""."
"","The learned District Judge has not disregarded the paper title of the Appellant. He has proceeded"
"","on  the basis  that the Appellant has  paper title to the land  in  dispute and  that the burden is  on"
"","the  Respondents 
to  prove 
the  prescriptive 
title  claimed  by 
them.  This 
is  clear  upon  a"
"","consideration  of the  answer given  to issue  no.  1 where  he  holds that the Appellant  is  not the"
"","owner of the full extent of land in dispute. If he disregarded the paper title of the Appellant there"
"","was no need to qualify this answer to only a portion of the land in dispute. Therefore, I reject this"
"","contention of the Appellant."
"","Prescriptive Title"
"","The 
learned  counsel 
for  the  Appellant  submitted 
that  the 
learned  District  Judge  erred 
in"
"","concluding that the Respondents had  prescribed to the land claimed  by them.  It was  submitted"
"","that  the  Respondents  failed  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  in  proving  prescriptive  title."
"","Reliance  was  placed  on  the  decision  in  Siyaneris  v.  Jayasinghe  Udenis  De  Silva  (52  N.L.R.  289)"
"","where it was  held that in an  action for declaration of title, where the legal title is  in the plaintiff,"
"","but the property is in the possession of the defendant, the burden of proof is on the defendant."
