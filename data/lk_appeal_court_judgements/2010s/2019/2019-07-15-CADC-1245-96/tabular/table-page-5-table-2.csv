"the Full  Bench Case of Alwis v.  Perera [1 (1919) 21 N.  L.  R.  at 326.]:"
"II  I wish very much that District Judges-I speak not particularly, but generally-when"
"a witness says  'I  possessed' or 'We possessed' or 'We took the produce',  would"
"not confine themselves merely to recording the words,  but would insist on those"
"words being explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon the"
"present practice of simply recording these  words when  stated  by the witnesses,"
"and would see that such  facts as  the witnesses  have  in  their minds are  stated in"
"full and appear in the record. '""'"
