"prescribed to the land in dispute for one or more of the following reasons:"
"(a)  Although the Appellant sought to prove that one David Singho was residing at no. 31A as"
"a  licensee  and  the  father  of the  Respondents  was  residing  at  no.  135,  there  was  no"
"evidence to indicate whether these two houses were one and the same."
"(b)  The Appellant did not mention any of the two residence numbers in the complaints made"
"to the Police and did not even refer to the number in the plaint. In fact, her evidence was"
"that she was not aware of the above numbers until she obtained the electoral registers."
"(c)  Plan  V3  shows  'hik'  trees  which  establishes  that  the  Respondents  had  made  a fence"
"separating  the  land  to which  they were  claiming  prescriptive title from  the  larger  land"
"claimed by the Appellant on the strength of her paper title."
"(d)  The documents tendered on  her behalf confirmed that David Singho was  residing on the"
"land  in  dispute since  1960s and  later the Respondents  also  living there since  1982 with"
"David Singho."
