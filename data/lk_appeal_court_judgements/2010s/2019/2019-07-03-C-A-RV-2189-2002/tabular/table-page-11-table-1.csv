"(a) 
The  two  letters  relied  on  by  the  Petitioner,  namely  'X6'  and  'X7'  do  not"
"relate to turnover tax;"
"(b) 
In  any  event,  the  validity  period  of such  notices  is  3  months,  and  by  the"
"time 
the  Certificate 
'P2'  was 
filed, 
the  said 
letters 
'X8'  had 
'Xl'  and"
"expired; and"
"(c) 
The  provisions  of Section  lS0(2)(c)  of the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  38  of"
"2000, which the Petitioner claimed was applicable, do not apply."
"the  position  of  the  Petitioner  that  the  learned  District  Judge  erred 
in 
It  is"
"respect  of  each  of  the  above 
three  positions.  This  Court  would 
therefore"
"consider each of the above matters."
"'Xl'  had  been  issued  on  1ih January  1999,  under  Section  131  of the  Inland"
"Revenue  Act,  No.  28  of  1979.  Section  131 
is 
identical 
to 
the  provisions"
"contained  in Section 3S  of the Turnover Tax  Act and  can  only be  resorted to, to"
"recover income tax that is  in  default. 'Xl' could  not have  been issued  in  respect"
"of turnover taxes in  default. 'X7' specifically sets out that the amount sought to"
"be 
recovered 
relates 
to 
the 
taxes 
in  default 
for 
the  years  1983/84,  and"
"1992/93.  These  periods  are  prior  to 
the  period 
for  which 
turnover  tax 
in"
"default is  sought to  be  recovered  by  'P2'.  This  Court  is  therefore  in  agreement"
"with 
the 
learned  District  Judge 
that 
the  Commissioner  General  of 
Inland"
"Revenue  had  not sought to secure the payment of turnover tax by way 'Xl'."
"'X6'  has  been  issued  in  1995  in  respect  of ""taxes  in  arrears"".  While  it is  correct"
"that  'X6'  does  not  specify  what  the  taxes  in  arrears  are,  this  Court  observes"
"that  at  the  time  'X6'  was 
issued,  the  turnover  tax  in  default  could  only  have"
"11"
