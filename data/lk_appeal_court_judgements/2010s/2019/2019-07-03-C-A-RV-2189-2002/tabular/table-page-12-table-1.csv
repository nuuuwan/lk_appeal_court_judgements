in  default,  it  did  not  contain  the  entirety  of  the  tax  in  default"
"","specified  in  the  Certificate  'P2'.  What  is  significant  however is  that  notice  had"
"","been  given  under Section  131  of the  Inland  Revenue  Act,  No.  28  of 1979  and"
"","not  under Section  35  of the  Turnover Tax  Act.  The  fact  that  no  reference  has"

"","The  second  ground  on  which  the  learned  District Court Judge  had  rejected  the"

the  Petitioner  was 
that  in  any  event,  a  notice  issued"
