"The  Petitioner argues  that in  terms of Section 35(3)  of the Act 3  if the person to"
"whom  a  notice  has  been  given  under  Section  35(1)  of  the  Act4 
is  unable  to"
"comply therewith owing to the fact that moneys  in  question do  not come  in  to"
"such  persons  hands  or become  due  from  him  within  the  period  referred  to  in"
"Section  35(1)  of  the  Act,  he  shall  within 
fourteen  days  of  the  expiration"
"thereof,  give  notice  in  writing to the  Commissioner General  of Inland  Revenue"
"apprising  him  of the  facts.  The  Petitioner argues  that no  such  notice  has  been"
"given  and 
issued.  While  this 
therefore  Certificate  'P2'  could  not  have  been"
"Court  is  of the  view  that  the  failure  on  the  part  of the  recipient  of a  notice"
"under Section  35(1)  to acknowledge the  said  notice attracts the consequences"
"set  out  in  Section  35(4)  of the  Act,  the said  argument of the  Petitioner cannot"
"be  sustained  in  view of the finding  of this  Court that the validity period  of 'X6'"
"and  'X7'  is  only 3 months."
