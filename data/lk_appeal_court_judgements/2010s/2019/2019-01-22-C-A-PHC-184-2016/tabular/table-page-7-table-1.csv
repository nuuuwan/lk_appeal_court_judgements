"the  remedy  against the  order  of  demolition is  automatically covered  and"
"therefore the objections are liable to be overruled."
"Perusal  of 
the  petition  addressed 
to 
the  Provincial  High  Court"
"reveals  that  the  Appellant  has  sought  multiple  reliefs  from  it  including"
"interim,  declaratory and in the form of final  relief, setting aside 
the order"
"made  by 
the  Magistrate's  Court. 
In 
these  circumstances, 
this  Court"
"reluctantly accepts the Appellant's submissions that she has prayed for the"
"setting aside of the order of the Magistrate's Court."
"Clearly 
the  draftsman  of 
the  petition  of  appeal  had  no  clear"
"I"
"comprehension of the reliefs that should be sought from this Court and as"
"a  result,  in view of the  objection raised by the Respondent,  the  Appellant"
"now had  to  rely  on a  obscure  prayer  to  make  up for  the  deficiency.  It is"
"unfortunate 
to  note 
that 
the  Appellant's  main  contention  before 
the"
"Provincial  High  Court is  also  that  her  claim  was  not  adequately  placed"
"before the Court below and she remits the cause of that lapse on her legal"
"representative."
"However, having considered  the submissions of the  parties for  and"
"against the preliminary objections, we are of the view that they are of very"
"technical  nature  and  are  curable  without  causing  any  prejudice  to 
the"
"Respondent."
"It is  appropriate  at  this  juncture  to  refer  to 
the  following  dicta  of"
