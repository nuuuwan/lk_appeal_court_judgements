"In the circumstances, the permissive possession of R.B.  Dissanayake had continued till"
"1984 when he crossed the great divide and that permissive permission will not give rise"
"to the claim of prescriptive possession made by the Defendants. The action was filed in"
"1986.  Though prescription claimed by the Defendant/Appellants did not originate from"
"their privy  R.B.Senanayake  because his  possession has  always  been permissive at the"
"instance of the  Plaintiffs,  there is  another principle that was intrinsically interwoven"
"with the leave and licence granted to R.B.Dissanayake namely habitatio"
"t"
"Habitatio"
"Thus, the case of prescriptive title put forward by the Defendant/Appellants fails  on a"
"consideration of the facts and the case of the Defendant is unsustainable. Let me observe"
"that the leave and licence given to R.B.Dissanayake would be tantamount to habitatio.  I"
"do have  to allude  to this  Roman  Law concept as it was contended that there was no"
"evidence of due terminatictl of the licence given to the Defendants, and hence this action"
"could  not  be  maintained/see  Ahriff v  Razik  (1985)  1  Sri.LR  162;  Attanayake  v"
"Ramyawathie (2003) 1 SrLLR 401 at 409.  The necessIty to  terminate any licence does"
"not arise at all, in view of the fact that the licence given to R.B.Dissanayake the privy of"
"the Defendants terminated upon his death. His death ipso facto  terminated the licence as"
"it was personal to him and this licence was not transmissible to the defendants upon the"
"death of R.B.Dissanayake."""
