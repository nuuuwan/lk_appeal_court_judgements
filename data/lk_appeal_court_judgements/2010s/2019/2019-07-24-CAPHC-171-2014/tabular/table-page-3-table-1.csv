"This  is  an application  against the  order of the  learned High  Court Judge  of"
"Avissawella dated 07/10/2014."
"The  Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant 
(Appellant) 
instituted  proceedings"
"against the  1 st  and 2nd  Respondent-Petitioner-Respondents  (Respondents)  in  terms"
"of Section  66( 1 )(b)  of the Primary  Courts  Procedure  Act (Act)  in  the  Magistrates"
"Court of Homagama,  by  private plaint,  claiming possession to  the  land in  dispute."
"The learned Magistrate by order dated  19/03/2013, held in favour of the Appellant."
"The  Provincial  High  Court  set  aside  the  said  order  on  the  basis  that  the"
"Appellant  had  not  satisfied  that  there  was  a  breach  of peace  or  a  threat  to  that"
"effect as  alleged, when action was instituted under Section 66( 1 )(b) of the Act."
"The  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  argued  that,  it  was  incumbent  upon  the"
"learned Magistrate to  have  considered the  existence  of a breach of peace,  and the"
"failure  to  satisfy  himself of the  existence  of a  breach  of peace  would  deprive  the"
"to  consider  such  application.  The  counter 
learned  Magistrate ' of  jurisdiction"
"argument  by  the  Counsel  for 
the  Respondent  is 
that  since  the  matter  in 
issue"
"concerns  jurisdiction, 
the  Appellant  should  have  raised  such  issue  at  the 
first"
"available  opportunity and failure  to  do  so  would amount to  a waiver of such right"
"on the part of the Appellant."
"If such objection to jurisdiction has  been taken,  it  would be the  duty  of the"
"learned Magistrate to come to a judicial pronouncement on the said issue."
