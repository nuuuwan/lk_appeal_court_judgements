"Section 202(1) of the Act  repeals the 2006 Act.  However, section  203(1) of the Act provides that"
"the 2006 Act shall  continue to apply for the years  of assessment commencing  prior to the date"
"on  which  this  Act  comes  into  effect.  The  instant  case  deals  with  issues  arising  in  the  year  of"
"assessment  2010/2011.  However,  the  learned  DSG  submits that the effect of section  203(1)  of"
"the Act is to apply the substantive provisions of the 2006 Act such as  whether the Appellant was"
"entitled to an  exemption from  income tax for the year of assessment on  its commission  income"
"to  the  instant  case  and  that  section  203(1)  of the  Act  has  no  bearing  on  the  question  as  to"
"whether the Appellant could  have invoked the appellate procedure set out in  section  144 of the"
"Act."
