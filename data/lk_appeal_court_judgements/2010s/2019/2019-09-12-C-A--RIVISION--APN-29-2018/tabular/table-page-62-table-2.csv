"Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of Bribery and Corruption Act No."
"19  of  1994.  The  prosecution  ""by"" 
the  Commission 
is 
therefore  clearly"
"legislative  residue  from  Section  78(1) 
from  the  statutolY  provisions  that"
"existed  before  the amendments brought in by  Act Nos.  19 and 20  of 1994,"
"with  no  corresponding  power  conferred  on  the  Commission  to  institute"
"proceedings. In the circumstances, the orders of the Magistrate's Court and"
"the Provincial High Court are tainted  with illegality and thereby subjected"
"to  be 
interfered with by this Court in exercising its powers of revision."
