"There  is  no  dispute  that  the  prosecution  against  the  Petitioner  is"
"under the Bribery Act.  The words ""entertain any prosecution""  in the said"
"Section  requires  a  little  more  consideration.  The  word  ""entertain""  was"
"deliberately  used  by  the Parliament for a  reason.  Dias,  in his commentary"
"explains (Vol.  1, p. 284)  the reason:"
"""When  a charge  needing sanction  of a particular  kind"
"of complaint

"...  unless  such  charge  is  supported  by  the  necessary"
"sanction,  or  is  preferred  by  a person  lawfully  entitled"
"to  make the complaint."""
"Therefore,

"cognizance  of the  matter by undertaking a  verification  that the  statutory"
"prerequisites of a written sanction by the Commissioner  is satisfied."
"Then,  the reference made by  the learned Senior State Counsel to the"
