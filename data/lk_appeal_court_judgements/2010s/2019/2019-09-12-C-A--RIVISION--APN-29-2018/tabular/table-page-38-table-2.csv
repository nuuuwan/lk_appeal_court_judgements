"Director-General of the  Commission."""
"In  view of  this  determination, learned President's Counsel submits"
"that the Commission has no authority to  institute a  prosecution since that"
"power is ""exclusively vested with the  Director-General of the  Commission""  and"
"as  such, the sanction of the Commission is  a  mandatory requirement and"
"its absence makes the pending prosecution against the Petitioner null and"
"void  since  he  had  objected  to  the  assumption  of  jurisdiction of Court on"
"the said prosecution at the very outset."
