"""Sanction  to  prosecute  constitutes a condition  confers"
"jurisdiction  on 
the  Court 
to 
try  the  case;  and  where"
"there 
is  no  valid  sanction, 
there 
is  a  defect 
in 
the"
"jurisdiction  of the  Court  which  can  never  be  cured"
"under  section  465.  It is  not  permissible  to  look  at  the"
"ultimate result of the  trial  in order to  examine whether"
"the  Magistrate  has  taken  legal  cognizance  of the  case."
"If a general  power  to 
take  cognizance  of an  offence  is"
"vested  in  a  Court,  any  prohibition 
to 
the  exercise  of"
"that  power,  by any  provision  of law,  must be  confined"
"to 
the 
terms  of  the  prohibition. 
In  enacting  a  law"
