"The  requirement of sanction  was  first  introduced  by Section 147 of"
"the  Criminal Procedure Code  (Ordinance  No.15  of 1898)  which  made  it a"
"condition  precedent 
for  the  initiation  of  prosecutions  for  certain  type  of"
"offences.  The  Administration  of Justice  Law  No.  44  of  1973,  Section  116"
"imposed  a  similar  precondition.  Section  135  of 
the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure  Act  No.  15  of  1979  continued  with  this  statutory  limitation  by"
"making  the  sanction  by  the  Attorney  General  as  a  pre-condition  to 
the"
"institution  of  proceedings 
in  respect  of  the 
instances 
that  are  specified"
"therein as no Court could take cognisance of certain offences without it."
