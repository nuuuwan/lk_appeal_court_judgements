"highlighted  this serious anomaly in  the Sinhala  text of the said  amending"
"Act  which  was  brought  in  to  substitute  certain  words  in  the  principle"
"enactment."
"Section  78  of  the  Bribery  Act  had  undergone  many  a  change since"
"its  enactment  in 1954,  owing  to 
the  fact 
that  different  institutions  were"
"empowered from  time  to  time  by  the Legislature,  to  institute prosecution"
"in order to  effectively eradicate the menace of bribery from our public life."
"For convenience, it is proposed to consider the English text of Section 78(1)"
"as it existed  before the amendment which was  brought in by Act No. 20 of"
"1994."
"Section  24  of 
the  Bribery  (Amendment)  Act  No.  9  of  1980,  had"
"repealed Section 78(1)  of the Bribery Act, 
in its entirety as it stood after the"
"amendment by Act No.2 of 1965."
"The substituted Section 78(1)  reads thus:"
"""No 
Magistrate's 
Court 
shall 
entertain 
any"
"prosecution for  an  offence  under  this  Act except  by  or"
"with  the written sanction  of the  Bribery Commissioner"
"or an officer authorised by him  in  that behalf"""
"Section 12 of the Bribery (Amendment)  Act No. 20 of 1994 amended"
"Section 78 
""by  the  substitution for  the words  'the  Bribery  Commissioner  or  an"
"officer authorised by him in  that behalf of the words ' the Commission'."
