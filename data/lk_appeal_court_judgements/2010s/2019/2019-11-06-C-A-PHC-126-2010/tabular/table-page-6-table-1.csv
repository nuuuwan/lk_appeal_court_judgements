"d
ifferent  position  when 
it  comes  to  Turnover  Tax,  which 
is"
"against the doctrine of approbate and reprobate."
"I need to stress two matters on that point."
"One  is,  as  the  appellant  has  stated  in  the  written  submissions"
"which I quoted above, Economic Service Charge shall be paid on"
"the  turnover  of  every  trade  and  business  whereas  the  Turnover"
"Tax  shall  be  paid  only  on  the  sale  by  wholesale  or  retail  of  any"
"goods.  Hence those two cannot be equalised."
"The  other  is,  the  said  return  in  respect  of  Economic  Service"
"Charge  for  the  quarter  2008/09(1)  had  later  been  found  by  the"
"respondent  to  be  on  the  wrong  turnout.    Hence  the  respondent"
"has  by  letter  dated  06.08.2008  made  an  appeal  for  a  refund.5"
"The impugned Notice of Assessment X18 is dated 10.09.2008, a"
"date subsequent to the said appeal.  Hence the appellant cannot"
"base  his  case  on  the  said 
(erroneous)  return 
in  relation  to"
"Economic Service Charge."
"The  respondent  in  paragraph  14  of  his  counter  affidavit  whilst"
"tendering  supporting  documents  has  stated  that,  in  respect  of"
"Economic 
Service 
Charge 
for 
the 
quarters 
2008/09(2),"
"2008/09(3), 
2008/09(4), 
2009/10(1), 
the 
respondent 
filed"
"returns on the correct basis, which is, the commission received"
"by 
the  respondent 
from 
the  Principal 
for  his  services  as  a"
"Commission  Agent,  and 
they  have  been  accepted  by 
the"
"Department of Inland Revenue.  This has not been denied by the"
"appellant."
"5 Vide page 194 of the brief for that appeal."
