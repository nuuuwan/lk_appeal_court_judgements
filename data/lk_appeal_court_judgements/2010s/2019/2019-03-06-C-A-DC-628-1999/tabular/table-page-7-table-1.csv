"case  of  persons  standing  in  certain  social  or  legal  relationships."
"The  presumption  represents  the  most  likely  inference  that  may"
"be  drawn  in  the  context  of  the  relationship  of  the  parties.  The"
"court will always attribute possession to a lawful title where that"
"is  possible.  Where 
the  possession  may  be  either 
lawful  or"
"unlawful,  it  must  be  assumed,  in  the  absence  of  evidence,  that"
"the possession is lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the"
"mother  is  held  by  the  son,  the  presumption  will  be  that  the"
"enjoyment of the son was on behalf of and with the permission"
"of the mother. Such permissive possession is not in denial of the"
"title  of  the  mother  and  is  consequently  not  adverse  to  her.  It"
"will  not  enable  the  possession  to  acquire  title  by  adverse"
"possession.  Where  possession  commenced  with  permission,  it"
"will  be  presumed  to  so  continue  until  and  unless  something"
"adverse occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to show"
"when  and  how  the  possession  became  adverse.  Continued"
"appropriation  of 
income  and  payment  of  taxes  will  not  be"
"sufficient 
to 
convert 
permissive 
possession 
into 
adverse"
"possession, unless such conduct unequivocally manifests denial"
"of the permitter’s title.  In order to discharge such onus, there"
"must  be  clear  and  affirmative  evidence  of  the  change  in  the"
"character  of  the  possession.  The  evidence  must  point  to  the"
"time  of  commencement  of  adverse  possession.  Where 
the"
"parties were not at arm’s length, strong evidence of a positive"
"character is necessary to establish the change of character.”"
