"U
pon  Interlocutory  Decree  being entered in terms  of the  Judgment,"
"the 
learned  District 
Judge 
issued 
the  commission 
to 
the  Court"
"Commissioner  to  prepare  the  final scheme of partition.  Accordingly,"
"when  the  Court  Commissioner  went  to  the  land  on  29.02.2000  to"
"carry out his statutory duty inter alia under section 31 of the Partition"
"Law,  several  persons  including  the  Petitioner  to  this  application  has"
"objected  to  it.1    Thereafter,  they,  including  the  Petitioner,  have  been"

"application  10  years  after  the  filing  of  the  case,  3  Â½  years  after  the"
"Judgment,  and  1  year  and  4  months after  he  admittedly knew  about"
