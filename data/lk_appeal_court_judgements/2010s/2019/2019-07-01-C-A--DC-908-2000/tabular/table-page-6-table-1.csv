"the  Defendant  was  seeking  to  defeat  it,  by  pleading  a 
vindicatio  action  to  Lot  1,"
"constructive  trust.  On  tht  evidence  the  Defendant  has  not  established  constructive"
"trust and therefore his claim for  a declaration that  Lot 1 belongs to him must fail.  No"
"doubt parol  evidence can be proved to establish a trust and there is no proof of a parol"
"evidence that Lot 01 too would also be transferred."
"The Defendant did not provide consideration for  the purchase of the other half of the"
"property and therefore, th~ constructive trust set up under Section 84 would fail.  In my"
"view if at all this unproverlparol evidence was to be understood, the Defendant must be"
"taken to have pleaded this parol agreement to enforce the alleged promise of the Plaintiff"
"that  he  would  transfer  lot  1 too  provided  he  had  recouped  his  balance  sum  of  Rs"
"2S0,000 by cutting teak and satin wood. Where did these tree stand? were they on lot 1"
"or lot 2? 
If they were on Lot 1,  how can the Defendant claim ownership of trees on a"
"land  which  does  not  belqng  to  him?  In  any  event  WflS  there  any  recoupment  to  the"
"benefit of Plaintiff by  th~lprocess of chopping trees?  was  there  a quantification as  to"
"how much the Plaintiff made by cutting trees? It was not proved at all."
"If at all, this parol agreement cannot lay the foundation for a trust but at the most if it is"
"to be believed, it would  amount to an oral promise to a transfer a land to the Defendant"
"and  an  oral  promise  to  transfer  land  would  be  invalid  in  view  of  Section  2  of  the"
"Prevention  of  Frauds  Or}inance.  The 
learned  District  Judge  has  adverted  to 
the"
"in  favour  of  the  Defendant  and  this 
attestation  clause  of  the :deed  bearing  No.  72"
"attestation  clause  refers to  a  date  of  execution  of  the  previous  deed  by  which  the"
"Plaintiff obtained a conveyance of the entire land. This attestation clause speaks about"
"payment of Rs.  2S0,000/-
to  the  Plaintiff Appellant by  the Defendant, but it does  not"
"say this payment was for the purpose of contributing part of the purchase money of the"
"entire land. Thus, a reference to Rs.  2S0,000/~ in the  ~ttestation clause as  having been"
".."
"given  by  the  DefendantÂ· Respondent  in  favour  of  the  Plaintiff  Appellant  on  lyh  of"
"December  1992  is  quite  equivocal  and could  equally  ~orroborate the  assertion  of  the"
"Plaintiff that the Defendant gave him a loan of Rs.  2S0,000/ ~ on lSth  of December 1992."
