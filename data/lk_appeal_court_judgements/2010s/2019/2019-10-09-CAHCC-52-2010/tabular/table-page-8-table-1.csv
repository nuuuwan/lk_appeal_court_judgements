"","mental  status.  Although  PWI  was  cross  examined  at 
length  repeating"
"","question  put 
to  him 
for 
two  days,  his  evidence  had  been  consistent."
"","Learned  High  Court Judge  rightly  found  his  evidence  to  be  credible and"
"","should be acted  upon."
"21.","According  to  his  own  testimony,  PW4  had  gone  to  the  scene  after  he"
"","heard  about the incident. He has  not even seen PWI  who got injured. It is"
"","doubtful whether he  had  seen the  real  incident. Learned High Court Judge"
"","was  right  when  he  accepted  the  evidence  of PWI  whose  evidence  was"
"","clear and  consistent  to  the  evidence  of PW4 .  An  Accused  can  be  found"
"","guilty  on  the  evidence  of a  single  eye  witness  provided  that  Court  finds"
"","the evidence of the single eye witness to  be  cogent, consistent and  totally"
"","acceptable."
"22.","Learned  High  Court Judge has  not rejected  the dock  statements solely on"
"","the  basis  that  Appellants  surrendered  to  the  police  within 
I  hour  of the"
"","incident.  In  page  33  of his judgment he  has  said  that the  Appellants  had"
"","no  reason to surrender to the police within  1 hour after the  incident."
"23.","Senior  State  Counsel 
for 
the  Respondents 
rightly  conceded 
that 
the"
"","learned High Court Judge wrongly applied the Lucas principle against the"
"","in 
this  case.  Every 
time  when 
the  position 
taken  up  by 
the 
defence"
"","defence is  rejected  by Court,  it cannot be taken as  corroborative evidence"
"","for  the  prosecution  as  referred  to  in  case  of Rex  V.  Lucas  f1981J  AER"
