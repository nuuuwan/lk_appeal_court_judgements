"' ...  ] now again turn  to  the  contention  that succeeding"
"in  a  criminal 
trial  cannot,  under  Section  48  of the 
HCJ"
"Judicature  Act,  continue  with 
the  proceedings 
recorded"

"station  he  ceases  to  exercise his jurisdiction  in  his area and"
"thereby he  suffers from  disability  to function  as  HCJ of the"
"area.  Thus, 
in  my view, transfer of a JHCJ from  a station is"
"covered by  the  words 
'other  disability'  in  Section  48  of the"
"Judicature Act. '"
