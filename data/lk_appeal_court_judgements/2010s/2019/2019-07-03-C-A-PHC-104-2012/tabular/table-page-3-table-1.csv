y  P3,  under 
the  heading  of 
""To  Know  Succession  of  Tenant"
"Cultivator under the Agrarian Development Act, No. 64 of 2000"", the"
"petitioner  requested  the  1st  respondent  to  inform  her,  upon  the"
"death  of  a 
tenant  cultivator,  whether,  a 
family  member  can"
"succeed  to  the  tenancy  rights  despite  her  objections,  and,  if  so,"
"according  to  the  Agrarian  Development  Act,  No.  64  of  2000,  who"
"shall be the next tenant cultivator.  As seen from P3, the petitioner"
"has sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to send the reply."
"There cannot be any dispute that P4 is the reply to P3.  P4 is under"
"the 
same  heading 
and 
refers 
to  P3 
in 
the 
first 
sentence."
"Surprisingly,  the  1st  respondent  does  not  in  P4  answer  the  clear"
"question  which 
the  petitioner 
raised 
in  P3,  but 
informs 
the"
"petitioner  not 
to  disturb 
the 
cultivation 
rights 
of 
the  2nd"

"Both  the  learned  State  Counsel  for  the  1st  respondent  and  the"
"learned  counsel  for  the  2nd  respondent  admit  that  by  P4  the  1st"
"respondent  did  not  address  the  issue  raised  by  the  petitioner,  i.e."
"succession under the Agrarian Development Act."
"The  learned  State  Counsel  at  the  argument  further  stated  that"
"what the 1st respondent has done is to make a provisional order in"
"order to prevent the breach of the peace.  That argument is equal"
"to the answer of the 1st respondent by P4 to P3."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  2nd  petitioner  in  order  to  justify  P4,"
"drew  the  attention  of  the  Court  to  section  90  of  the  Agrarian"
"Development  Act  to  say  that  the  1st  respondent  was  entitled  to"
"make that order."
"I accept that the 1st respondent is empowered under section 90 of"
"the  Act  to  make  decisions  on  cultivation  rights  of  agricultural"
