"Decided on:  
02.07.2019"
"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The  petitioner-appellant  filed  this  application  in  the  High  Court"
"seeking to quash the decision of the 1st respondent Commissioner"
"General  of  Agrarian  Development  marked  P4  by  writ  of  certiorari."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  dismissed  this  application.    This"
"appeal by the petitioner is against the said Judgment."
"It  is  undisputed  that  the  mother  of  the  2nd  respondent  was  the"
"tenant cultivator of the paddy land in suit under the petitioner as"
"the 
landlord. 
  Upon 
the  death  of 
the  mother,  when 
the  2nd"
"respondent  started  to  continue  with  the cultivation,  the  petitioner"
"has  objected  to  it  on  the  basis  that,  the  2nd  respondent  cannot"
"succeed to the tenancy rights of her deceased mother."
"It  appears  from  1R1  that  the  2nd  respondent  has  complaint  it  to"
"the  Agrarian  Development  Officer  of  the  area.    As  seen  from  1R2,"
"the latter has held an inquiry into that matter.  The learned State"
"Counsel  for  the  1st  respondent  has  tendered  the  same  written"
"submission  which  was  tendered  to  the  High  Court  wherein  it  is"
"stated that ""At the end of the said inquiry the Agrarian Development"
"Officer  had 
informed 
the  parties 
to  seek 
the  advice  of 
the  1st"
"respondent  since  the  matter  involved  a  succession  of  the  tenancy"
"rights 
[and] 
thereafter 
the  petitioner  had  dispatched 
the 
letter"
"Then 
it 
is 
marked  as  P3  addressed 
to 
the  1st 
respondent""."
"abundantly clear the background to the letter marked P3."
