"unreliable owing to  those 
infirmities. 
If he is an accomplice to  the  crime"
"then  it  is  equally  probable  that  he  would  """".  cast  his  erstwhile  association"
"and friends 
to  the  wolves in order  to  save his own  skin"" - per  Illangatilaka &"
"This  proposition  is 
others  v  Republic  of Sri  Lanka  (1984)  2  Sri.  L.R.  38."
"further  fortified  by  the  admission  made  by  the  witness  that  he  identified"
"the  2nd  and  4th 
accused  during 
the  non-summery  proceedings  simply"
"because he was instructed  to  do so  by  the Police.  Then the question arises"
"whether that admission is  in line with the contention of the appellants that"
"they  too  were  falsely  implicated  upon  the  insistence  of  the  Police. 
That"
"consideration  should  have  been  considered  by  the  trial  Court with 
due"
