"lacerations  on  the  body  of  the  deceased  is  not supportive of  the  fact  that"
"there  were assaults  by  blunt  weapons 
and  therefore  a  doubt arises  as  to"
"the 
reliability of the version of the events  presented by  prosecution."
"The  appellants  also  contended  that  the  witness  made  a  statement"
"only after  he  was severely assaulted  by  the Police and  the  trial  Court had"
"failed 
to  evaluate  credibility  of  the  evidence  of  this  solitalY  eye  witness"
"from the angle of that very relevant consideration."
"Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General,  in  his  reply  submissions  stated"
"that  the  trial  Court  had  properly  evaluated  the  evidence  and  particularly"
"the  two inconsistencies and found  that it would not affect the credibility of"
"the witness as  it was not important. He also submitted  that the subsequent"
"conduct 
by 
the 
appellants 
clearly 
supports 
the 
allegation 
of 
the"
"prosecution that it was they who committed  the murder."
"It would appear from  the contention of both the appellants that their"
"main  thrust in challenging the conviction  is  based  on  the credibility of the"
"sole eye witness Ajith Kodagoda.  The trial Court, for  the reasons stated in its"
"judgment,  concluded 
that 
the 
said  witness 
is  a 
truthful  and 
reliable"
"witness."
"The  challenge  mounted  by 
the  appellants 
therefore  concerns  a"
"determination  of  a  question  of  fact  by 
the  trial  Court.  Credibility  of  a"
"witness  is  undoubtedly  a  question  of  fact  and 
the  determination  of  that"
"question  of fact  by  the  trial  Court,  which  had  the  opportunity  to  note  the"
"demeanour  and  deportment of  such  a  witness,  is  obviously  is  entitled  to"
"great weight;  vide judgment of the Supreme Court in Attorney General v"
"Man} Theresa  (2011) 2 Sri L.R.  292."
