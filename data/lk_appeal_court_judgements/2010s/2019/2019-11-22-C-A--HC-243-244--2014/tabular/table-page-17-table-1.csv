"The most important factor  that affects  the evidence of the witness in"
"view  of  these  inconsistencies,  is  his  claim  of  identifying  the  persons  who"
"were involved  in the incident. The witness stated in  the trial Court that the"
"1st  appellant  was  in  army  uniform  and  wore  a  cap.  It  is  evident  that  he"
"witnessed 
the 
incident  from  some  unspecified  distance  away  from 
the"
"scene.  The  place  where 
the  motor  cycle  stopped  was  cleared  of  any"
"vegetation  owing  to  the  check  point manned  by  the  army.  It is 
therefore"
"safe to  assume that there was a considerable distance between  the witness"
