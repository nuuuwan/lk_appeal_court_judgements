the 
important 
inconsistencies 
that  were  highlighted  by"
"them  only superficially and  the failure  of  the trial  Court in  this aspect had"
"tainted  the validity of the conclusion  it had eventually reached."
"The 1st  appellant,  in  support of  his  appeal  strongly  contended  that"
"the  inconsistencies  marked  as  lVl  and  lV2  throws  serious  doubts  about"
"the  alleged  complicity  of  him 
in 
the  murder  since 
the  wih1ess  was"
"obviously  inconsistent as  to  who  was  in  army  uniform  at  the  time  of  the"
"attack on the deceased."
"It was  the evidence of  this witness before  the High Court that it was"
"the 1st  appellant who was in army uniform, stopped  the motor cyclists and"
"then stabbed  the third one. However, in  his statement to Police,  which was"
"made  after  six  days  since  the  incident,  he  claimed  that  it  was  one  of  the"

the position advanced"
"by 
the  wib1ess

inquest  proceedings.  This 
inconsistency  was"
"admitted  by  the witness which excluded  any mistake made by the witness"
"on his claim."
"It was  also  highlighted  by  the  appellants  that  there  was  no  motive"
"for  the appellants  to  mount such  an  attack on the  deceased.  In addressing"
"the  issue  of 
lack  of  corroboration,  it was  emphasised  that  although  the"
"witness  alleged  that  the  deceased  was  clubbed  by  the  gang  of  four, 
the"
"post mortem  report  did  not support such  a  claim  as  it was  clear  that  the"
"deceased  had  suffered  only  two  stab  injuries  to  the  back  of 
his  chest.  It"

the  appellant
