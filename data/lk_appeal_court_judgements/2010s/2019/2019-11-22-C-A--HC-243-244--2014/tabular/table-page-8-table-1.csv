"In  this particular instance, the trial Court, in accepting Ajith Kodagoda"
"as  a  credible  witness,  had  placed  reliance  of  the  demeanour  of  the  said"
"wibless  in coming  to  this  conclusion.  In such  a  situation  this  Court  must"
"then  consider, even  if  it entertains a  different view  to  the  one  held  by  the"
"trial  Court  about  the  credibility  of  a  witness,  whether  it should  interfere"
"upon  such a determination."
