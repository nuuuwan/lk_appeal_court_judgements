in 
the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the 
Respondent"
"North Western province, holden at Puttalam. The  complaint of the Respondent"
"to  the  High  Court  was  twofold;  firstly  that  the  learned  Primary  Court  Judge"
"could  not have  made  an  order under Section  66(1)(b)  of the Act  as  there  was"
"no  evidence  of a breach  of the  peace;  and  secondly that the  land  which  is  the"

"to Court.  He  had  proceeded  to hold that although  a land  dispute  between two"
"law abiding citizens  must be  resolved  by  a district court, the Primary Court  has"
"been  conferred  this special  jurisdiction to  resolve  a land  dispute  between  two"
"persons  who  are  not  law  abiding  citizens  which  can 
lead  to  a  breach  of the"
"peace  and  that therefore, a breach  of the  peace  being threatened  or likely is  a"
"pre-condition to the Primary Court exercising jurisdiction in  land disputes."
