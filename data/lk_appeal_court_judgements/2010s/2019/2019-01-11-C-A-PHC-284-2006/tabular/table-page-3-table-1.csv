"The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows."
"In  October  1998,  the  State  had  issued  Marasinghe  Arachchige  Sumanaratne  a"
"grant  under Section  19(4)  of the  Land  Development Ordinance  in  respect  of a"
"land  in  extent of 0.768 hectares situated within the Grama  Niladhari division of"
"Baranankattuwa  in  the  district of Puttalam.  The  said  land  had  been  described"
"in  the  said  G!ant as  being  Lot  NO.6 of Plan  No. 9s/14/{:f/43 1
.  The  boundaries"
"given  in  the  Grant  had  been  amended  by  a  letter  dated  8th  December  1998"
"issued 
by 
the  Divisional  Secretary  of  Mahakumbukkadawela.  This  Court"
"observes that this letter sets out the amended  boundaries of the land  r.eferred"
"to  in  the  Grant  but  does  not  have  a  reference  to  any  Plan. 
This  Court  also"
"observes  that there  is  'a slight  discrepancy  in  the  extent  of the  land  between"
"what is  given  in  the Grant and  the said  letter. However,  by  a subsequent letter"
", 
issued  in  2005 2
the  Divisional  Secretary  had  reverted  to  the  boundaries  and"
"the extent given  in the Grant, thereby removing any ambiguity in this regard."
"Although  Sumanaratne  was  not  resident  on  this  land  after 2003,  he  is  said  to"
"have  cultivated 
this 
land  and  had  been 
in  possession  of  this 
land  until  he"
"passed  away on  13th  August 2004. After the  passing away of Sumanaratne, the"
"Appellant, who is  the widow of Sumanaratne appears to have  claimed the said"
"land.  By 
letter  dated  15th 
June  2005, 
the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Lands,"
"Agriculture, 
Irrigation  and  Animal  Production  Services  of  the  North  Western"
"Provincial  Council  had  confirmed 
that 
the  Appellant 
is  entitled 
to 
the 
life"
"interest  under the  G rant.  The  life  interest  in  favour of the Appellant  has  been"
"registered  on  29th  June  2005,  as  borne  out  by  a  letter  dated  28th  June .2005"
"issued  by  the  Divisional  Secretary,  Mahakumbukkadawela . This  Court observes"
