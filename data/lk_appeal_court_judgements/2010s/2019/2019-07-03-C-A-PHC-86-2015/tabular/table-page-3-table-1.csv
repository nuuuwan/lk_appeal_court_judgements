"S
ecretary  of  the  Province  on  01.01.2007.    The  petitioners  have"
"accepted those appointments made by letters marked P7(1)-(14)."
"The petitioners state that (a) they made several requests to the 1st"
"and 2nd respondents to release them from the Combined Service to"
"the Health Ministry, and (b) then they were informed that it would"
"be rectified when their services would be made permanent. There is"
"no documentary  proof to support either of them. The respondents"
"in  their  objections  deny  both  those  matters.    When  facts  are  in"
"dispute,  needless  to  say  that,  mandamus  cannot  go.    This  Court"
"has  no  wherewithal  to  look  into  the  accuracy  of  those  assertions"
"and then make a suitable order.  This Court will decide whether or"
"not to issue mandamus on the facts which are undisputed."
"Thereafter the petitioners have been made permanent in the same"
"post,  i.e.  Drivers  of  Class  II(b)  in  the  Combined  Service  of  the"
"Drivers  of  the  North  Western  Provincial  Public  Service,  effective"
"from the date of appointment, i.e. 01.01.2007.  This has been done"

"issued in 2010 and 2011."
"The  petitioners  have  filed  this  application  in  the  High  Court  in"
"2012."
"When the respondents deny that they promised the petitioners that"
"the  petitioners  would  be  absorbed  to  the  Health  Ministry  from"
"Combined Service when permanent appointments are made, I need"
"hardly  emphasize  that  the  petitioners  are  clearly  guilty  of  lashes"
"when they decided  to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial"
"High Court to challenge the appointment letters issued in 2007, in"
"the  year  2012.    Writ  is  a  discretionary  remedy  and  will  not  be"
