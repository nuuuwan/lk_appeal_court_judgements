"T
hat  means,  at  least  in  2003,  when  the  surveyor  came  to  the"
"land to prepare the scheme of final partition, the petitioner knew"
"about the partition case."
"However, the petitioner has come before this Court in 2010, i.e."
"7 years after she became aware of the partition action."
"In paragraph 22 of the petition and the corresponding paragraph"
"of the affidavit the petitioner says that she waited to come before"
"this  Court  until  the  contempt  inquiry 
for  obstruction  of  the"
"surveyor was over.  This explanation is completely unacceptable."
"Contempt 
inquiry  has  nothing 
to  do  with 
this  application."
"Contempt  proceedings  have  commenced  in  2007,  and  I  find  in"
"the  Journal  Entry  No.  88  dated  25.04.2005,  the  petitioner  has"
"made  an  application  to  the  District  Court  for  intervention  and"
"thereafter  as 
seen 
from 
the  Journal  Entry  No.  89  dated"
"29.08.2005, that application has been virtually withdrawn.  The"
"petitioner  has 
come  before 
this  Court  5  years  after 
that"
"application for intervention."
"It  must  be  stressed  that  “the  power  to  grant  relief  by  way  of"
"restitutio in integrum is a matter of grace and discretion.” (Usoof v."
"Nadarajah  Chettiar  (1958)  61  NLR  173  at  177)    The  petitioner"
"cannot  seek  restitution  as  of  right. 
  A  person 
invoking  the"
"jurisdiction  of  this  Court  by  way  of  restitutio  in  integrum  must"
"act with “the utmost promptitude.” (Menchinahamy v. Muniweera"
