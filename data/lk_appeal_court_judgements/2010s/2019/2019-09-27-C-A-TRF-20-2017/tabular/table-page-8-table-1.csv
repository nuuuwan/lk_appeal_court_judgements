"The  argument 
in 
support  of  the  Petitioner 
is 
that 
the 
learned  judge"
"having  considered 
the  above 
stated 
fact s  and  circumstances  considered 
it"
"to  be  heard  by  another 
appropriate  to  transfer  case  bearing  No.  HC  8222116"
"in 
the  impugned  case  which  was  similarly 
judge,  however  declined  to  do  so"
"circumstanced.  This argument in  my view,  does  not hold  ground  for  the  simp le"
"reason  that the  order to  transfer case bearing No . HC  8222/ 16  was  given taking"
"to  Court  at 
the 
time  of 
into  consideration 
the  ascertainab le  facts  disclosed"
"making such  order.  However,  when  the  order  in  the  impugned  case  was  made"
"the  learned judge made directions on  the ascertained  facts  leaving the  option to"
"revisit the  issue when  full  facts  were known."
"In  Incal  v. Turkey,  (supra),  the  Court went on to  say that,  ""appearances"
"may  be  of certain  imparlance;  whal 
is  al  slake  is  Ihe  confidence  which  the"
"courts  in  a democratic sociely must  inspire in  Ihe  public and,  above ali,  as far"
"as  criminal  proceedings  are  concerned;  in  Ihe  accused;  in  deciding  whelher"
"there  is  legitim ale  reason to fear thai a parlicular cOllrt  lacks  independence or"
"imparlialily,  Ihe  stand poinl of the accused is  important  wilhoul being decisive;"
"what  is decisive is  whether his doubts are objectively justified. """
"This  brings  me  to  the  2nd  ground  urged  by  the  Petitioner that the  learned"
"Judge  was  motivated 
by 
bias 
against 
the 
Petitioner 
and/or 
extraneous"
"considerations,  when 
he  made 
certain 
comments  which 
are  more '  fully"
"described  in  paragraph  22  of the  Petition  which  relates  to  the  convicting  and"
"sentencing the  accused  in  case No.  HC 8026115.  It  is contended that comments"
"made  by  the  learned judge with  regard  to  a  certain  'political culture'  prevalent"
