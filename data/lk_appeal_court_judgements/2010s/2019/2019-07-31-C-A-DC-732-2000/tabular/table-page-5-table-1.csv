"PI makes it clear that the original owner of the corpus was Kiri Baiya and he had inherited"
"the land from his father Undiya. No doubt PI deals with other lands that are co-owned but"
"as for the corpus the deed is quite emphatic-it speaks of sole ownership to the corpus. It is"
", 
this sole  ownership that Kiri  Baiya passed to the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff, 1st"
"2nd and 3'd Defendants."
"Upon a perusal of the deed PI, it is clear that the parties had divided their properties and"
", 
Kiri  Baiya had transferred  what he had got to the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff, 1st"
"2nd  and 3rd Defendants.  Even the 8th and 9th Defendants admitted that the possession of the"
"Plaintiff, 1st
,  2nd  and 3rd  Defendants was more than 60 years. There was indeed evidence of"
"sharing the money out of the proceeds of sale of cut  timber trees  on the land among  the"
"parties but it was in any event an isolated payment,  and if at all, it took place in 1970. It"
"could not have affected a 60 year old prescriptive possession."
"Upon a conspectus of the evidence led in the case, I take the view that the judgment dated"
"22.08.2000 is flawless and cannot be impugned. So  I affirm the judgment and dismiss  the"
"appeal."
