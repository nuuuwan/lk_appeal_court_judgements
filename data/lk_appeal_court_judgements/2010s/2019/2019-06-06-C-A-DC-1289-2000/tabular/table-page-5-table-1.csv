"The  same  proposition  was  articulated  thus  by  Lascelles  C.J  in  Moldrich  v.  La BroDy"
"(1911) 14 N.L.R 331:"
"""Where improvements have been effected with the assent of the co-owner, that portion of the land"
"on which the improvements stand should, if pOSSible, be allotted, on a partition of the land, under"
"Ordinance  No.lO  of 1863,  to  the  co-owner  who  has made  the  improvements;  he  should  not  be"
"reqUired to pay compensation to  the other co-owner for these improvements. If the land on which"
"the  improvements  are  made  is  superior  in  point of fertility  to  the  rest  of the  land,  a different"
"consideration arises""."
