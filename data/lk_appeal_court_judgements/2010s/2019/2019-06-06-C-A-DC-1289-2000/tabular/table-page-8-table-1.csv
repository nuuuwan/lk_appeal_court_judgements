"100S/1997(F),decided  on  30.07.2018), 
the  expression  ""ante  litem  motam""  would  mean"
"""before an action has been raised"" . i.e.,  at a time when the declarant had no motive to lie."
"This phrase is  generally used in reference  to the  evidentiary  requirement  that the acts"
"upon  which  an  action  is  based  occur  before  the  action  is  brought,see  Black's  Law"
"Dictionary (loth Edition, p 112)."

"improvement in the form  of the house was made by Gunaseeli who later made a gift of"
"that improvement to the 3rd  Defendant' Appellant. It  is  also  to be noted that when this"
"deed was marked,  no  objection was raised by the Plaintiff and  Section 68  of Partition"
"Law  No.44  of 1973 provides  that  it shall not be necessary in any proceedings under the"
