"asserted  at p  285  of the Appeal  Brief  that the house  was  of  14  cubit feet.  This would"
"indicate 
that 
the  old  house  of  21  cubit  feet,  which 
the  Plaintiff  had  alleged  his"
"grandfather had built,  had ceased  to exist  and in its place  the house  which was  in an"
"extent of 14  cubit feet  had come  into  existence.  This  important item  of  evidence  that"
"that  the  house  which  was  alleged  to  have  been

"Gunaseeli who had constructed the house."
"A  strong  item  of  evidence  in  support  of  this  testimony  of  the  3rd  Defendant  is  that"
