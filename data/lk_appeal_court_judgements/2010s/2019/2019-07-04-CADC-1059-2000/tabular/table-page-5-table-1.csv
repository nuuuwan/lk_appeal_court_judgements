"attention:  ""the  court  is  entitled  to  presume  the genuineness  in  terms  of section 114  of the  Evidence"
"Ordinance of the journal entries maintained under the Civil Procedure Code. The genuineness attached to"
"the journal  entries  and  the  rebuttable presumption  arising from  the  same  ate part  and pared  of our"
