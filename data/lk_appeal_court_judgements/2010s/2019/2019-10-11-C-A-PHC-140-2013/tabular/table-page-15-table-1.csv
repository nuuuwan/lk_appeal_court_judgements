"a
ffidavit evidence, which is entirely in consonance with the scheme"
"and purpose of the Act.  Accordingly, I reject that argument."
"The last argument of the learned President’s Counsel is, in terms of"
"section  18,  “competent  authority”  used  in  relation  to  any  land"
"means the Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or"
"an Assistant Government Agent of the District in which the land is"
"situated, and therefore the Divisional Secretary Kundasale  has no"
"locus  standi  to  file  this  application.    In  terms  of  the  Transfer  of"
"Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act, No. 58 of 1992, in any Law the"
"expression  “Government  Agent”  occurs,  it  shall  be  substituted  by"
"“Divisional Secretary”, and the functions of Government Agents are"
"required to be exercised by Divisional Secretaries.30 I see no merit"
"in that argument."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  the  Judgment  of  the  High  Court  is  set"
"aside  and  the  order  of  the  Magistrate’s  Court  is  restored.    In  the"
"circumstances of this case, no order is made as to costs."
