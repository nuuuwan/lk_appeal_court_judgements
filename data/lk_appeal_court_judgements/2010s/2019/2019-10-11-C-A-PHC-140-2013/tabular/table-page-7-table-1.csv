"The Supreme Court explained that point in this manner:"
"The  Crown  Lands  Encroachments  Ordinance  (Chap.  465)  as"
"amended  by  Act  No.  7  of  1954  has  clearly  provided 
for"
"situations of this nature. Section 2 provided  that  where  there"
"is an alleged encroachment of land where persons who having"
"entered upon or taken possession of land which belong to the"
"Crown or which prior to entry or taking possession, was in the"
"possession  of  the  Crown,  information  of  such  encroachment"
"could  be  laid  before  the  District  Court.  The  District  Court  if"
"satisfied  that  the  persons  against  whom  the  information  had"
"been  laid  had  entered  upon  or  taken  possession  of  the  land"
"without  the  permission  of  the  Government,  could  make  an"
"order for delivery of possession. This Ordinance has provided"
"a  very  summary  or  speedy  procedure  to  eject  such  persons."
"However, section 7(c) of this Ordinance permitted the rebuttal"
"of the presumption that the land belongs to the State on proof"
"inter  alia  of  uninterrupted  possession  for  not  less  than  30"
"years.  The  State  had  not  chosen 
to  proceed  under 
this"
"Ordinance, to obtain a summary  order from the District Court"
"for  delivery  of  possession  of  the  land  on  the  basis  that  the"
"land  belonged  to  the  State  and  had  been  encroached  upon."
"The  Respondent  had  decided  to  proceed  under  the  newly"
"enacted  State  Lands 
(Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  No.7  of"
