"evident  on  a close  examination  of the totality of the  evidence  that the  learned  District"
"Judge is correct in pronouncing judgment in favour of the plaintiff-respondent""."
"Both these judgments are an  application of the constitutional  provisions found in the proviso to"
"Article 138(1) of the Constitution which mandates that no judgment, decree or order of any court"
"shall be reversed or varied on account of any error defect or irregularity which has not prejudiced"
"the substantial  rights  of the  parties  or occasioned  a failure  of justice.  Clearly the constitutional"
"provisions  prevail  over section  187 of the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  I hold  that even  if a trial judge"
"has  failed  to  answer  all 
the  issues  raised  and  accepted  by  Court  the  judgment  need  not  be"
"reversed  or varied  if such  error defect or irregularity has not prejudiced the substantial  rights of"
"the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. One such instance is where upon a close examination"
"of the totality of the evidence it is found that the learned District Judge is  correct in pronouncing"
"the judgment."
"I  wish  to  add  that the  interpretation  given  to  section  187  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code  that  it"
"requires  a trial  judge  to answer  all  the  issues  raised  and  accepted  at the  trial  may  need  to  be"
"revisited  as 
there  are  provisions  in  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  which  allows  the  trial  judge  to"
"dispose the action on the answer to some issues.  For example, section 147 of the Civil  Procedure"
"Code allows an action to be disposed of only on issues of law and there can  be  no doubt that such"
"a judgment is a judgment within the meaning of section 187 of the Civil  Procedure Code although"
"the trial judge has  not answered  all  the issues  raised  and  accepted  by Court. The  practice of the"
"Courts  developed  over  a  long  period  of time  is  for all  issues  to  be  raised  and  settled  prior to"
"certain issues of law being tried as  preliminary issues."
"For the foregoing reasons,  I see  no reason  to interfere with the judgment of the learned District"
