"The  nature  of an  action  for  definition  of  boundaries  actio finium  regundorum  is  described  in"
"Gane's translation of Voet' s Pandects  Book 10 Title 1 Section 6 at page 617 as follows:"
"""The action  is  granted against neighbours to neighbours; whether the latter are  owners,"
"usufructuaries,  (in  which  case  you  would  correctly  reckon  the  Clergy  also  in  respect  of"
"lands  belonging to their livings)  creditors  holding a hypothec,  quitrenters, or possessors"
"in  good faith. All  such  persons are endowed with a jus in  re,  and  in  virtue of these  rights"
"have  a personal  interest in  unsettlement of boundaries  being  avoided;  and  as  a general"
"rule good faith bestows on a possessor as  much as true: fact if no law stands in the way""."
