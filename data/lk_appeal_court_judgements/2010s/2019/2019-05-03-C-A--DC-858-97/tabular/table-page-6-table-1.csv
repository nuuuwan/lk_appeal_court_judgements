"District Judge  was  correct in  holding in  favour of the  Respondent. In  Gunasena  v.  Kandage  and"
"Others [(1997) 3 SrLL.R.  393]  Weerasuriya J.  held:"
"""The  learned  District Judge  was  in  error for failing  to  adduce  reasons  for  her findings ."
"Nevertheless, the question that has to be examined is whether or not such failure on  her"
"part had  prejudiced the substantial rights of the defendant appellant or has occasioned a"
"failure  of justice. Having  considered the totality of the evidence,  it seems to me that no"
"prejudice  has  been  caused  to the  substantial  rights  of the  defendant-appellant  or  has"
"occasioned a failure of justice by this error, defect or irregularity of the Judgment."""
