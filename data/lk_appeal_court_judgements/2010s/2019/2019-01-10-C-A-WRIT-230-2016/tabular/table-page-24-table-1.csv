"24"
"Dayaratne  v.  Rajitha  Senaratne21  may  be  the  first  case  Rule  5"
"was referred to in an application for writ of mandamus.  In that"
"case,  it  is  important  to  understand  that,  both  the  respondents"
"against  whom  mandamus  was  sought  had  been  cited  both  by"
"names  and  official  designations.    Pending  determination  of  the"
"case both of them ceased to hold office.  Nonetheless, even at the"
"time  of  argument,  the  petitioner  had  not  taken  steps  to  add  or"
"substitute  the  successors  in  office  in  order  to  proceed  with  the"
"application. 
  When 
this  matter  was 
raised  as  a 
inter  alia"
"preliminary  objection,  the  petitioner  relied  on  Rule  5(4)(b)  read"
"with  5(5)  to  argue  that  the  application  can  be  proceeded  with"
"against  their  successors  for  the  time  being  in  office  without"
"addition or substitution.  This argument was rightly rejected by"
"Marsoof  J.  as  the  President  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  (with  Sri"
"Skandarajah J. agreeing) on the basis that Rule 5(4)(b) read with"
"5(5)  was  inapplicable  in  this  instance  as  this  was  a  case  filed"
"against the public officers both by name and designation, and as"
"such,  for  the  said  Rules  to  be  applicable,  the  case  should  have"
"been 
filed  before  the  specified  date  nominated  by  the  Chief"
"Justice, which, in this instance, was 31.12.199122, but this case"
"had been filed long after the said specified date. That finding is"
"in  complete  consonance  with  Rule  5. 
  Rule  5  applies 
in"
"applications  where  a  public  officer  is  made  a  respondent  in  his"
"official designations  only and not by name.   The only exception"
"is  Rule  5(5)  which  is  applicable  only  in  respect  of  applications"
"filed  before  31.12.1991. 
  The  reference  to  Haniffaâ€™s  case  by"
"Marsoof J.23 is clearly obiter dicta.  This Judgment of Marsoof J."
