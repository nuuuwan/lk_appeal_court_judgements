"","In  this  application  the  petitioner  has  made  the  Chairman,"
"","Urban Council, Nawalapitiya, the respondent. The petitioner"
"","should  have  named  the  person  against  whom  a  Writ  of"
"","Mandamus  can  be  issued.  The  Chairman,  Urban  Council,"
"","Nawalapitiya, is not a juristic person. The Privy Council has"
"pointed 
out 
that","the 
juristic  person  must  be 
created"
"","specially by statute (62 N. L. R. 169, 174, and at 182-183;"
"","65  N.  L.  R.  253).  Even  if  the  Chairman,  Urban  Council,"
"","Nawalapitiya, was a juristic person I fail to see how we can"
"","issue  a  Mandamus  on  a  juristic  person.  A  Mandamus  can"
"","only  issue  against  a  natural  person,  who  holds  a  public"
"","office. If such a person fails to perform a duty after he has"
"","been ordered by Court, he can be punished for contempt of"
"","Court.  Therefore  the  contention  of  Counsel  for  respondent"
"","must  prevail. The  application  is  dismissed  with  costs fixed"
"at Rs. 157.50.",""
