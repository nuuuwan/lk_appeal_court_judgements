"were  done  but  make  a  vague  and 
irresponsible  statement"
"without  any  documentary  proof  that  “selections  were  completed"
"in April 2016.”"
"It is my considered view that P6 is a genuine document and by"
"no means a biased or incorrect document.  There was no reason"
"for  the  4th  respondent-Provincial  Director  of  Education  of  the"
"Sabaragamuwa   Province to send P6 to the 3rd respondent-Chief"
"Commissioner 
(Teachers’  Education)  stating 
incorrect 
figures"
"regarding  teacher  vacancies 
for  the  Divisional  Secretariat  of"
"Kalawana for the year 2018."
"The predominant argument of the 2nd respondent that P6 relates"
"to the vacancies in 2016 and not 2018 is in the teeth of the said"
"document because P6 explicitly and clearly states that it relates"
"to the vacancies for  the year 2018.  That is the first sentence of"
"that letter, and the argument of the respondents that P6 relates"
"to the vacancies in 2016 and not 2018 is simply outrageous."
"In the circumstances, I have no hesitation to conclude that the"
"decision  not  to  select  the  petitioner  as  a  trainee  to  follow  the"
"above-mentioned course for the year 2015 was, to say the least,"
"irrational5  and  also  unreasonable  according  to  the  standard  of"
"unreasonableness set out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses"
"Ltd  v.  Wednesbury  Corporation6,  which  is  commonly  known  as"
"“Wednesbury  unreasonableness”,  and  therefore  the  petitioner  is"
"entitled to the reliefs―certiorari and mandamus―as prayed for in"
"the prayer to the petition."
