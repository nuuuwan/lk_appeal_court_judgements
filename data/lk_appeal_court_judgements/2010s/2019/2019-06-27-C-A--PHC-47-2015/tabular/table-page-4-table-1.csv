"The 
learned  Magistrate  having  taken 
into  consideration  the  use  of the"
"roadway  has  concluded that the Appellant has  failed  to  establish that the  right of"
"way claimed had been used for a long period of time."
"In 
the  Supreme  Court 
In  consideration  of  Section  69( 1)  of  the  Act,"
"Ramaiingam vs.  Thangaraja (1982) 2 SLR 699, held that;"
"""if the  dispute  is  in  regard to  a  right  to  any  land other  than  right  to"
"possession of such land,  the question for decision,  according to  Section"
"69(1),  is who is entitle to  the right which is subject of dispute.  The world"
"""entitle""  here  connotes  the  ownership  of the  right.  The  Court  has  to"
"determine  which of the parties acquired that right,  or is entitled for  the"
"time being to exercise that right. """
"In  Siriyawathi 
Jayasinghe  vs.  K.A.  Karunaratne,  CA.  No.  863190,  the"
"Court held that,"
"""in  this  case  the  r t  Respondent claiming a servitude or a right of way"
"over the  Petitioner's land has  to prove that he  is  entitle  to  such a right"
"and mere user will not determine the dispute. """
"Accordingly, 
the 
learned  Magistrate 
correctly  evaluated 
the  evidence"
"brought before Court,  when deciding that the Respondent has  failed to establish a"
"right to  a roadway  and by doing  so  has  not prejudiced any right  or interest in the"
"land which a party may establish in a civil suit."
