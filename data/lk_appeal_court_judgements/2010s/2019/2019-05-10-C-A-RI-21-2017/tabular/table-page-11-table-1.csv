"by the Plaintiff~Respondent. In the circumstances Section lO( 4) of the NHDA Act has no"
"application to the facts  of this case. One has to read between the lines when one tries to"
"interpret Section lO( 4)."
"Attachment"
"In the phrase writ of attachment,  the word attachment will bear this meaning~the taking into"
"custody  of  a  person's  property  to  secure  a  judgment  or  to  be  sold  in  satisfaction  of  a"
"judgment. Joseph  Goulden,  in  The Million Dollar  Lawyers  52~53 (1978)  seeks  to  render  a"
"meaning to the concept of attachment.  ""The disputed residence was important because a"
"writ  of  attachment~briefly,  an  order  freezing  cash  or  other  assets~cannot be  obtained"
"against  a  person  unless  the  person  has  a foreign  address.""  Possibly  assets  were  in  one"
"jurisdiction and the owner was in another and unless one knew his  address,  the writ of"
"attachment cannot travel afar~this is how Joseph Goulden pithily summarized it."
"Needless to say, Section 10(4) speaks of an order which is akin to sequestration or seizure"
"Defendant~ 
and  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  writ  that  was  issued  against  the  1s t"
"Respondent. What issued against the 1st 
Defendant~Respondent was a writ that executed"
"a decree  within the meaning of Section  217(C)  of  the Civil  Procedure Code. The  decree"
"was one that was directed to the Petitioner to yield up possession of immovable property"
"and that decree was entered properly in favor  of the Plaintiff~Respondent. That writ need"
"not issue solely at the instance of the NHDA."
"So all the principles that have an interplay in the case namely res judicata and availability of"
"alternative remedies  that the  Petitioner himself has  exhausted by taking the case  all the"
"way to the Supreme Court will shut the door to the remedy of restitutio in integrum. There is"
"no reasonable error or Justus error in the judgment of the Court a quo."
"Accordingly I proceed to affirm the decree and writ that have been entered in the case and"
"dismiss this application for restitutio in integrum."
