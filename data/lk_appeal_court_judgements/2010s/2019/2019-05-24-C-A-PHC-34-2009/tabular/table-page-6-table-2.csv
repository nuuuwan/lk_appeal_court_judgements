"""The law recognises two kinds of possession:"
"(i)  When  a person has  direct physical control over a  thing at a given"
"time - actual possession."
"(ii)  When  he though  not in  actual possession has  both  the power and"
"intention at a given time to  exercise dominion  or control over a  thing"
"either directly or through another person - constructive possession. """
