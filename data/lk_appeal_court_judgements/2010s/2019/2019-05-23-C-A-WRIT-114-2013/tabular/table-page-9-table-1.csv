"Court held as follows:"
"lithe  Petitioner  who  is  seeking  relief  in  an  application  for  the  issue  of a"
"writ of certiorari is  not entitled to relief as  a matter of course, as  a matter"
"of right  or as  a matter of routine.  Even  if he  is  entitled  to  relief,  still  the"
"court  has  a  discretion  to  deny  him  relief  having  regard  to  his  conduct;"
"delay,  laches,  waiver,  submission  to jurisdiction  are  all  valid  impediments"
"which stand against the grant of relief."""
