"The petitioner filed this application against the Commissioner of"
"Labour 
(respondent)  seeking 
to  quash  by  way  of  a  writ  of"
"certiorari  the  certificate  filed  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  under"
"section  38(2)  of  the  Employees’  Provident  Fund,  No.15  of  1958,"
"as  amended,  marked  X2,  predominantly  on 
the  basis 
that,"
"the 
certificate 
referred 
to 
1890 
employees, 
the 
“although"
"particulars  of  the  said  employees  were  not  set  out  in  the  said"
"certificate  so  as 
to 
facilitate 
the  petitioner  company 
to  show"
"cause”."
"The  respondent  filed  objections  to  this  application  stating  inter"
"alia  that  particulars  running  into  large  number  of  pages  were"
"filed 
in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  separately,  together  with  the"
"certificate, and produced them marked 3R5C and 3R5D."
"The  petitioner  admits  receipt  of  the  Final  Notice  marked  3R4"
"sent  by 
the 
respondent 
to 
the  petitioner  before 
filing 
the"
"certificate  marked  X1 
in  Court. 
  The  petitioner  has  not"
"responded  to  it.    In  the  circumstances,  the  respondent  had  no"
"option, but to file the certificate X1 in the Magistrate’s Court."
"When  X1  was  filed, the  Magistrate’s  Court  issued  notice  on  the"
"petitioner  to  show  cause.    As  seen  from  the  proceedings  of  the"
"Magistrate’s  Court,  the  petitioner  has  responded  to  it,  and  the"
"parties had been  exploring the possibility of  a settlement of the"
"matter."
"The documents marked 3R6 and 3R6(a) filed by the respondent"
"with the objections contain this “settlement” where the petitioner"
"has  shown  some  payments  made  as  EPF  contributions,  which"
"are not reflected in the certificate X1."
