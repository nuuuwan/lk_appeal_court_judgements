"T
he  sole  argument  of  the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  for  the"
"respondent is that the Turnover  Tax in question on the  income of"
"selling National Lotteries was imposed in terms of section 3 of the"
"Fiscal Charter of the Southern Provincial Council, which allows the"
"Provincial  Council  to  levy  Turnover  Tax  on  the  income  of  selling"
"any  commodity,  which 
includes  a  National  Lottery.2 
  Learned"
"Senior State Counsel says that this is not Lottery Tax but Turnover"
"Tax imposed on income of selling Lotteries."
"A  conspicuous  feature  of  the  submission  of  the  learned  Senior"
"State  Counsel  is  not  to  place  much  emphasis  on  the  Thirteenth"
"Amendment 
to 
the  Constitution, 
in  particular, 
the  Provincial"
"Council List and the Reserved List, but to rely heavily on the Fiscal"
"Charter  of  the  Southern  Provincial  Council,  in  particular,  section"
"3(1) thereof. What the learned Senior State Counsel fails to realize"
"is  that  Provincial  Statutes  are  not  sui  generis.    They  shall  always"
"be 
subject 
to 
the 
limitations 
contained 
in 
the 
Thirteenth"
"Amendment 
to 
the  Constitution,  which  established  Provincial"
"Councils."
"As  I  have  already  stated,  Provincial  Councils  can  make  statutes"
"with  respect  to  any  matter  set  out  in  the  Provincial  Council  List,"
"and they have no power to make statutes on any matter set out in"
"the Reserved List, and if they do the latter, they can be challenged"
"as being ultra vires."
"Section  3(1)  of  the  Fiscal  Charter  is  a  general  provision  to  levy"
"Turnover Taxes on the turnover of businesses."
