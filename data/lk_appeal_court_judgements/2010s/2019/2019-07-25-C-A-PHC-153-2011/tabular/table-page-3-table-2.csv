"379 stated:",""
"","An application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a"
"reasonable 
time 
from","the  date  of 
the  Order  which 
the"
"","applicant  seeks  to  have  quashed.  What  is  reasonable  time"
"","and  what  will  constitute  undue  delay  will  depend  upon  the"
"","facts of each particular case. However the time lag that can be"
"","explained  does  not  spell  laches  or  delay.  If  the  delay  can  be"
"","reasonably  explained,  the  Court  will  not  decline  to  interfere."
"","The delay which a Court can excuse is one which is caused by"
"the  applicant  pursuing  a","legal  remedy  and  not  a  remedy"
"","which is extra-legal. One satisfactory way to explain the delay"
"","is  for  the  petitioner  to  show  that  he  has  been  seeking  relief"
"elsewhere in a manner provided by the Law.",""
