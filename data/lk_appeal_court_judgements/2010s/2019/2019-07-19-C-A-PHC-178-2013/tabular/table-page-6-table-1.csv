"his request and he persuaded the driver and the cleaner to do so."

"one  of two  matters  i.e.  the  owner had taken all  the necessary precautions that he"
"could  take  to  prevent  the  crime  or  he  had  no  knowledge  of an  offence  being"

"has evaluated the evidence again and held that the contradictions in the evidence of"
"the  witnesses  infer knowledge  on the  part of the  appellant  about illegal  activities"

"appellant failed  to disclose the details as to why he needed a trailer to  do  farming"
"and it shows that he was using it for transportation. I wish to express my agreement"
"on this observation of the Learned High Court Judge."
"The registered owner of the trailer stated that he gave the trailer to his cousin over"
