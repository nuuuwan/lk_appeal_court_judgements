o. 
25255/P  which  was 
filed 
to 
partition  Aluthwatta 
and"
"Delgahapurane Kumbura.4  The plaintiff in that partition action is"
"one  Tikiri  Appu  Wijesinghe.    The  1st  defendant  in  the  present"
"action  also  seems  to  be  a  party  to  that  partition  action.    Tikiri"
"Appu  and  the  1st  defendant  do  not  say  that  Lots  3-5 
in  the"
"Preliminary  Plan  of  the  present  case  are  parts  of  Aluthwatta  and"
"Delgahapurane Kumbura.  This is relevant for the reason that the"
"2nd 
defendant 
is 
not 
the 
sole 
owner 
of 
Aluthwatta 
and"
"Delgahapurane  Kumbura.    It  is  a  co-owned  land.  It  appears  from"
"the evidence of the 2nd defendant that the 2nd defendant sought to"
"take out a commission to show Lots 3-5 of the Preliminary Plan of"
"the  present 
case  as  part  of  Aluthwatta  and  Delgahapurane"
"Kumbura  in  the  other  partition  case.5    However,  it  is  not  clear"
"whether the 2nd defendant pursued that application.  By now that"
"partition  action,  which  was 
filed 
to  partition  Aluthwatta  and"
"Delgahapurane  Kumbura,  must  have  been  concluded.    If  the  2nd"
"defendant  thought  that  Lots  3-5  of  the  Preliminary  Plan  of  the"
"present case are parts of Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura"
"which  is  the  subject  matter  in  the  then  pending  partition  action"
"No.25255/P,  he  should  have  made  that  application  in  that  case."
"There  is  no  doubt  that  the  land  depicted  in  Plan  P6,  which  is  the"
"Preliminary Plan in the other case, is the southern boundary of the"
"Preliminary  Plan  in  this  case  marked  Y.    That  has  been  admitted"
"by the 2nd defendant in cross examination.6  There is no necessity"
"to have a superimposition done to understand it."
