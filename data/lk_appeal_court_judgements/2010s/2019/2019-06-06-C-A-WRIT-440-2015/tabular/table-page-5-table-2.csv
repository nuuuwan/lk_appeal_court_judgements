"contravention  of  the  provisions  of  subsection  (1)  shall  be"
"invalid."
"From  the  above, 
it 
is  clear  that  succession  effected  by 
first"
"endorsement 
in 
the  document  marked  C  by 
the  Divisional"
"Secretary 
is 
valid,  but 
the  nomination  and  alienation  by"
"successor  Rosaline  as  seen  from  second  endorsement  in  the"
"document marked C, and in the document marked D are invalid"
"as Rosaline has no authority to do so."
"Hence 
the 
latter 
two 
decisions/endorsements 
(second"
"endorsement  in  C  and  the  endorsement  in  D)  are  quashed  by"
"way of a writ of certiorari."
"In terms of section 72 read with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule of"
"the  Land  Development  Ordinance,  being 
the  eldest  son  of"
"Grantee  Sirisena, 
the  petitioner  shall  succeed 
to 
the 
land."
"However  this  is  subject  to  two  conditions.    One  is,  in  terms  of"
"section 73 of the Act, that shall take effect from the date of the"
"death  of  Rosalin  (the  spouse  of  Sirisena  and  the  mother  of  the"
"petitioner).  The other is, the Divisional Secretary can convey 48"
"perches out of this land to the 4th respondent.5"
"Application is partly allowed.  No costs."
"5 Counsel for the petitioner in paragraph 23 of the written submissions dated"
"25.07.2018  says  â€œThe  petitioner  further  respectfully  states  that  he  is  ready"
"and willing to part with 48 perches of land to be granted to the 4th respondent"
"as  per  settlement  entered  before  the  Divisional  Secretary  dated  2010.03.10"
"(document marked as R3)."
