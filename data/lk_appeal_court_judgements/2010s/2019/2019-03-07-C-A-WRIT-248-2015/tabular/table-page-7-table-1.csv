"T
he  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  for  the  first  time  in  the"
"written submissions (unknown to the respondents) has taken up"
"the position that “the purported amended public purpose which is"
"to establish  a branch of the 8th respondent does not qualify as  a"
"public  purpose  as  the  8th  respondent  bank 
is  engaged 
in  the"
"banking services which are commercial in nature and will benefit"
"only 
selected 
individuals  mainly 
the 
customers 
of 
the  8th"
"therefore  divesting  can  be  compelled.  The 
respondent”  and"
"learned  counsel  further  states  that  the  8th  respondent  has  no"
"actual interest in the land and they did not even file objections"
"to the petitioner’s application."
"The National Savings Bank has filed no separate objections may"
"be  because  it  is  a  state-owned  Savings  Bank  and  they  have  no"
"personal 
interests 
as 
private 
banks.  However, 
the  main"
"contender—the  Minister—who  has  the  authority  to  vest  and"
"divest  has 
filed  objections.  The  argument  that  setting  up  a"
"branch  of  the  National  Savings  Bank  will  benefit  only  selected"
"individuals  mainly  the  customers  of  the  8th  respondent  bank  is"
"unacceptable because in the case of other public purposes also,"
"the result is the same.  For instance, a bus terminus will benefit"
"only a selected individuals—bus commuters; a public library will"
"benefit  only  a  selected  individuals—readers;  a  school—school"
"going children etc."
"If the decision of the 3rd respondent as reflected in P22 and P23"
"is  no  room  to  quash 
it  by  way  of 
is  not  ultra  vires,  there"
"certiorari."
