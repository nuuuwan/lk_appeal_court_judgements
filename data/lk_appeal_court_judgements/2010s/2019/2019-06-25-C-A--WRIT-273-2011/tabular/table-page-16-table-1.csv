"Our Courts have consistently held that prior to a decision affecting the rights of"
"an  individual are taken, such person must be afforded a right to respond. Some"
"laws  contain  specific  provisions  with  regard  to  the  procedure  that  should  be"
"followed  in  affording a hearing.  The  Wages  Board  Ordinance  however is  silent"
"as 
to  the  kind  of  hearing  that  should  be  afforded  to  an  employer,  before"
"determining the correct Wages  Board  that should  be  applicable to a particular"
"important  in  the  view  of this  Court  is  that  the 
employee.  Therefore,  what  is"
"employer concerned  or the  Petitioner in  this case,  must be  made aware of the"
"nature or scope  of the investigation that is  being carried  out,  must be  told the"
"reasons  why  a  particular  classification 
is  being  made  and  must  be  given  an"
"opportunity to respond  and  clarify  matters,  thus enabling the  Respondents to"
"arrive at a decision which is  reasonable by both parties."
