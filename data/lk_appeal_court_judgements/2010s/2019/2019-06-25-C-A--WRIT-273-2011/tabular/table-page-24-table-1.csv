"","This  Court  does  not think  so.  It is  not  in  dispute  (a)  that the  employees  who"

that  the  said  employees  worked 
employed  under  the  agreement  (P2';"

the  Port  of  Colombo;  and 
(c) 
that 
their  work 
involved"
"","transporting  of  containers  from  the  ship  side  to  the  storage  yard  and  vice"

"","that  they  could  only  drive  within 
the  Port.  Thus, 
their  primary 
road  and"
"","function was to transport containers within the Port. It is the view of this Court"

"","unreasonable  and 
irrational  had 
the  Respondents  brought  such  employees"

for  the  Port  Transport  Trade  was  available,  and  where 
the  said"
