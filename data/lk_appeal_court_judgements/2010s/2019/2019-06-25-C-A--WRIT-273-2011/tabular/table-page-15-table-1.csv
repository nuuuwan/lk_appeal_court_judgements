"It is  the view of this Court that 'PIS' is only a reiteration of the decision in  'P16'"
"and 
read 
that  'PIS'  should  be 
together  with  'PI6'.  The  Petitioner  has  not"
"replied  'PIS',  nor has  the  Petitioner informed the  Respondents that 'PIS' had"
"been 
issued  without  taking  into  consideration  the  representations  that  the"
"Petitioner claims it made on 26th January 2011."
"Thereafter,  by notice dated 8th  February 2011  annexed  to the petition marked"
"issued  under  Section  3(2)10  of  the  Wages  Board  Ordinance, 
the  2nd 
'Pig',"
"Respondent  requested  the  Petitioner to provide details  of the  salaries  paid  to"
"all  employees 
in 
its  employment  from  July  2008  to  July  2010,  before  28th"
"February 2011. This  Court observes  that the Petitioner has  not challenged  the"
"authority of the Respondents to request such  information."
"By  its  letter dated  25th  February  2011  annexed  to the  petition  marked  'P20',"
"the Petitioner requested  a period  of 3 months to submit the said  information."
"In  response  to the  said  letter,  the  2nd  Respondent  by  letter dated  10th  March"
"2011  marked 
'P21', 
informed 
the  Petitioner  that  adequate 
time  had  been"
"provided  and  that if the  Petitioner fails  to  provide  the  requested  information"
"by  31 st  March  2011,  all  further action  that will  be  taken  by  the  Petitioner will"
"be  on  the  basis  of records  previously  provided.  Instead  of complying  with the"
"request  for information,  the Petitioner filed  this  application  seeking  to  quash"
"the document 'PIS'."
"lOSection  3(2) 
reads  as 
follows:  Every  person  who  as  an  employer  maintains  or  has  maintained  under"
"subsection 
(1)  a  wage 
record 
in 
respect  of  any  wage  period  shall  preserve  such 
record 
for  four  years"
"commencing on  the last day of such  period, and  shall, when  required to do so  by the Commissioner of Labour"
"or any prescribed officer,  produce such  record  for inspection and furnish  a true copy of such  record  or of any"
"part of such  record or permit such  a copy to be made."
