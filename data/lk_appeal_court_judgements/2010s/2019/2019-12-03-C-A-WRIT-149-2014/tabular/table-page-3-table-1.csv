"rejected  as  it is  not revealed  that the  1st  Respondent  employed  15  or more persons  before  the"
"date of termination."
"The  Petitioner  complains  that  there  was  no  proper  inquiry  into  his  complaint.  However,  P16"
"shows  that  the  parties  were  summoned  on  at 
least  two  occasions  namely  23.08.2011  and"
"29.08.2011.  P16  also  shows  that  the  4th  Respondent  considered 
the  documentary  evidence"
"available  in  several  official  briefs.  The  Petitioner  was  clearly  given  a  hearing  and  the  rules  of"
"natural justice followed.
