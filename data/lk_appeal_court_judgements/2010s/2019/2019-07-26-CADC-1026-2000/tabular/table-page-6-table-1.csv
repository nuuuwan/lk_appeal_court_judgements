"","that  later  after  about  35  years,  the  wife  and  daughter  of the  Appellant had"
"","come and ousted the Respondent from the property."
"10.","It is  pertinent to  note that the  Appellant in his  plaint has  concealed the  fact"
"","that 
the  Respondent  was  ousted  by 
them 
from 
the  property  and 
that"
"","Respondent was  given possession by  the  Court in an  action  filed  by her.  In"
"","paragraph  15  of the plaint the Appellant had averred that the Respondent on"
"","her  own  left  the  house  and  filed  action  against  them  stating  that  she  was"
"","evicted. Evidence proved otherwise."
"11.","The  evidence  of the  wife  and  the  daughter  of the  Appellant  revealed  that"
"","they got to know about the transfer after the year  1992 that is  after about 33"
"","years of the transfer. Appellant admitted in evidence that he left the property"
"","about  2  to  3 years  after he  signed the  deed  of transfer.  He  also  admitted in"
"","cross  examination  that  he  got  to  know  within  the  same  time  he  signed  the"
"","deed, that the Respondent deceived him saying that she wanted to get a loan."
"","However, he had not asked her to transfer the land back to  him.  I am of the"
"","view that these attendant circumstances are hardly sufficient to show that the"
"","to 
the  Respondent. 
Appellant  did  not 
intend  to  dispose  of the  property"
"","Evidence of the witnesses were led before the learned District Judge and she"
"","was the best person to  decide on the credibility of the witnesses and I see no"
"","reason to  interfere with the decision of the learned District Judge.  Hence the"
"","grounds of appeal are without merit."
"12.","At 
the  argument,  counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  submitted 
that 
the 
learned"
"","District Judge has answered only the issues of the Plaintiff, and has  failed to"
"","answer the Defendant's issues. Further it was  submitted that,  it is  a violation"
"","of the Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code."
