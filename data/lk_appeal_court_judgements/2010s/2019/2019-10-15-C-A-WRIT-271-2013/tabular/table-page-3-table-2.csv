"De  Mel  and Another  [(1982)  1 Sri.L.R ..  123  at  128]  this  Court  quoted  with  approval  Haniffa's"
"judgment as  follows:"
"''The  petitioner's  application  is  beset  with  other  difficulties  as  well.  The  petitioner  has"
"made  W.  L.  P.  de  Mel,  Commissioner  of Labour,  the  respondent to  his  application.  It  is"
"common ground that he  has  now ceased  to hold thi s post and  is  presently the Secretary,"
"Ministry of Trade.  The  petitioner has  not sought to substitute the  present holder of the"
"office. A Mandamus can  only issue  against a natural person, who holds a public office. If"
"such  a person  fail s to  perform  a  duty  after  he  has  been  ordered  by  Court,  he  can  be"
"punished for contempt of Court. (See,  Haniffa v.  The Chairman, U. C.  Nawalapitiya, 66 NLR"
"48).  Before this Court issues a Mandamus, it must be satisfied that the respondent will"
"in fact be  able to comply with the order and  that in the event  of non-compliance, the"
"Court is  in a position to enforce obedience to its order. Mandamus will  not, in  general,"
"issue  to compel  a respondent to do  what is  impossible  in  law or in  fact. Thus,  it will  not"
"issue  ........ .. .....  to require one  who is functus  officio to do  what he was  formally obliged"
"to do."" (de Smith, 2nd Edn.  581). So  it seems to me, that even  if the petitioner's application"
"succeeded, the issue of a Mandamus would be futile ."" (emphasis added)"
