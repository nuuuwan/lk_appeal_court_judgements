"The plaintiffs filed this action against the  five defendants in the"
"District  Court  seeking  declaration  of  title  to  the  land  described"
"in 
the  schedule 
to 
the  plaint,  ejectment  of 
the  defendants"
"therefrom  and  damages.    The  defendants  filed  answers  seeking"
"dismissal of the plaintiffsâ€™ action.  After trial the learned District"
"Judge  entered  Judgment  for  the  plaintiffs  as  prayed  for  except"
"damages.    Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Judgment  only  the  1st"
"defendant has preferred this appeal."
"The 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  1st  defendant-appellant  has,

"candidly  admitted  that  the  plaintiff-respondents  proved  paper"
"title to the land in suit at the trial.  The appellant has no paper"
"title to the land."
"However, 
the 
learned  counsel, 
in  paragraph  13  of 
the  said"
"written submissions, argues that as the respondents took up the"
"position  that  the  appellant  came  to  the  property  as  a  licensee"
"under  them,  the  burden  was  on  the  respondents  to  prove  that"
"fact,  and  as  it  has  not  been  proved,  the  respondents  cannot"
"succeed in this action."
"I  am  unable  to  agree  with  that  argument.   It  is  well  settled  law"

"proved  by  the  plaintiff,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  defendant  to"
"prove on what basis he is in possession of the land, because the"
"paper title holder has a legal right to possess the land.1  In other"
