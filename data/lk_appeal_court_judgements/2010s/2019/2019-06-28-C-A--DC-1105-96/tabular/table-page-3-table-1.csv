"b
e a child of Pinhamy, nevertheless, shown his willingness to forgo"
"that  claim  to  put  an  end  to  this  long  litigation  started  nearly  4"
"decades  ago,  that  is,  in  the  year  1980.    Court  wishes  to  place  on"
"record  its  appreciation  of  that  attitude  of  the  learned  counsel  for"
"the appellant in the name of justice."
"Now all parties concede that Pinhamy had 7 children: namely, four"
"sons, 
Punchi 
Appuhamy, 
Kiri 
Banda,  Mudiyanse, 
Dingiri"
"Appuhamy;  and  three  daughters,  Punchihami,  Manikhami  and"
"Dingirihamy."
"Then  I  am  left  with  the  question  whether  the  three  daughters  of"
"Pinhamy,  namely,  Punchihami,  Manikhami  and  Dingirihamy,"
"married  in  diga.    Assuming  that  Manikhamy  was  a  daughter  of"
"Pinhamy, 
there 
is  no  dispute 
that  she  married 
in  diga  and"
"therefore  did  not  inherit  from  the  father.    However,  there  is  no"
"such  consensus  with  regard  to  the  other  two  daughters,  namely,"
"Punchihamy and Dingirihamy."
"Kiri  Banda,  a  son  of  Pinhamy,  sold  his  share 
to  his  sister"
"Punchihamy  by  deed  marked  1D1.    Dingirihamy,  a  daughter  of"
"Pinhamy,  also  sold  her  share  to  her  sister  Punchihamy  by  deed"
"marked 1D2.  Then Punchihamy sold the said two shares and her"
"own share as a child of Pinhamy to the 1st defendant-appellant by"
"deed  marked  1D3. 
  These  deeds  were  marked  without  any"
"objections.  If Punchihamy and Dingirihamy did not marry in diga,"
"the  1st  defendant-appellant 
thereby  becomes  entitled 
to  3/12"
"share of the land."
"Have 
the  plaintiffs  proved 
to 
the 
satisfaction  of  Court 
that"
"Punchihamy and Dingirihamy entered into diga marriages and left"
"the ancestral home to live with their husbands?  Certainly not."
