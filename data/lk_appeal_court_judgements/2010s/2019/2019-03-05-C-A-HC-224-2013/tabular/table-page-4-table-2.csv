"7. 
Counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  contended 
that 
the  sole  eye"
"witness  Martin  is  an  unreliable  witness  and  Court  should  not act"
"upon  his  evidence. 
In 
that,  Counsel  submitted  that  Martin  had"
"given  the  statement after a delay  of 5  days.  Alleged  incident  had"
"taken  place  on  4th  April  2000  but  he  had  made  the  statement to"
"the  Police  only  on  9th  April  2000.  Counsel  further  submitted,  the"
"that  Martin 
saw 
the 
incident  may 
have 
been 
an 
evidence"
"afterthought and  a made-up  story to implicate the Appellant who"
"had  a previous enmity over the deceased  having an  affair with the"
"appellant's sister."
"8. 
It  was 
the  contention  of  the  Counsel  for  the  Respondent"
"that witness Martin who was  the grandfather of the deceased  had"
"explained 
the  delay 
in  giving  a  statement  to  the  Police 
to  the"
"satisfaction of the Court and  therefore is  a reliable witness and  the"
"Learned Trial Judge was correct in acting upon his evidence."
"9. 
Delay in  making the statement to the Police would affect the"
"if  the  witness  explains 
the 
credibility  of  the  witness.  However,"
"delay  to  the  satisfaction  of the  Court,  his  evidence  can  be  relied"
"upon.  The  explanation  has 
to  be  plausible.
