"A
s the learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner submits, in"
"terms  of  Article  11  of  the  Letter  of  Appointment,  the  employee"
"has  two  hurdles  to  surmount  before  taking  the  matter  to  the"
"local Court."
"Firstly,  he  shall,  after  the 
internal  disciplinary  procedure 
is"
"concluded,  follow  “the  internal  appeal  procedure  laid  down  in"
"Chapter  X  of  the  Rules  laying  down  the  Specific  Conditions  of"
"Employment applicable to local staff serving in Sri Lanka”."
"Secondly, he shall refer the dispute for arbitration."
"Then  what  is  the  meaning  of:  “it  shall  be  without  prejudice  to"
"referral of the dispute  to  the court having  jurisdiction under local"
"law  in  accordance  with  the  first  paragraph  of  Article  23  of  the"
"found 
in  Article 
11 
of 
the 
Letter 
of 
Framework  Rules”"
"Appointment?"
"When there is such an Arbitration Clause, in terms of section 5"
"of  the  Arbitration  Act,  No.11  of  1995,  “the  Court  shall  have  no"
"jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  such  matter  if  the  other  party"
"objects 
to 
the  court  exercising 
jurisdiction 
in  respect  of  such"
"That  means, 
irrespective  of  having  an  Arbitration 
matter.”"
"Clause,  the  Court  shall  have  jurisdiction,  provided  the  other"
"party  does  not  object  to  it.  It  is  only  if  the  other  party  objects,"
"the jurisdiction of the Court is ousted."
"Hence “referral  of the dispute to the court” shall be understood"
"subject to arbitration.  That is why there is a detailed description"
"about  the  conduct  of  arbitral  proceedings  in  Article  11  of  the"
"Letter of Appointment."
