"the court having jurisdiction under local law."
"Referral to this court may be preceded by arbitration."
"In that backdrop, it is the submission of the learned President’s"
"Counsel for the petitioner that, in any event, the 2nd respondent"
"could  not  have  gone  before  a  local  Court  without  first  referring"
"the dispute for arbitration."
"There  is  no  doubt  that  Article  11  of  the  Letter  of  Appointment"
"contains an Arbitration Clause."
"However the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent relies on the"
"last  part  of  the  1st  paragraph  of  Article  11  of  the  Letter  of"
"Appointment  which  states  that  “it  shall  be  without  prejudice  to"
"referral of the dispute  to  the court having  jurisdiction under local"
"law  in  accordance  with  the  first  paragraph  of  Article  23  of  the"
"Framework  Rules”  to  argue  that  there  is  no  duty  by  the  2nd"
"respondent  to  initiate  arbitral  proceedings  before  invoking  the"
"jurisdiction of the local Court.  I regret my inability to agree with"
"that argument."
