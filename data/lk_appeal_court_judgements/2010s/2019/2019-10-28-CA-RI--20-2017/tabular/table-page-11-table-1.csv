et  me  now  consider  the  merits  of  the  petitioners’  application."
"As 
I  have  already  stated, 
is 
that, 
the  petitioners’  grievance"
"without their knowledge, parts of their lands have been surveyed"
"and  included  into  the  Preliminary  Plan  of  this  case,  and  they"
"became  aware  of  it  when  the  surveyor  came  to  the 
land  to"
"prepare  the  proposed  final  scheme  of  partition.    Their  short"
"complaint is that there is no proper identification of the corpus."
"There cannot be any dispute that identification of the corpus is"
"of  paramount  importance  in  a  partition  case.    That  is  the  first"
"thing  the  District  Judge  shall  do  in  a  partition  case.  It  is  only"
"after  the  identification  of  the  corpus,  the  District  Judge  shall"
"embark  upon  the  arduous  task  of  investigation  of  title  of  the"
"corpus. 
In  other  words, 
if 
the  corpus  cannot  be  properly"
"identified, investigation into the title does not arise."
"In  this  case  the  plaintiffs  filed  the  action  to  partition  the  land"
"known as Atambagahawatte Pitakattiya in extent of 2 Roods and"
"30 Perches depicted in the Surveyor General’s Plan No. 112821.9"
"The  surveyor  who  prepared  the  Preliminary  Plan  has 
in  his"
"Report  in  answering  the  most  important  question  of  the  Report"
"as  to  whether  the  land  surveyed  is  the  land  to  be  partitioned,"
"states  that  he  is  unable  to  say  so,  as  he  could  not  identify  the"
"land  by  making  a  superimposition  of  the  Surveyor  General’s"
"Plan No. 112821 (which depicts the land to be partitioned), due"
"to  points  of  fixation  being  changed  over  the  years.10    According"
"to the surveyor, the Plan No. 112821 of the Surveyor General, a"
"copy of which is not found in the case record, has been prepared"
