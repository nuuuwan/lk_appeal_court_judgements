"This  was  emphasized  by  Soza  J.  in  Somawathie  v.  Madawala18"
"in the following manner:"
"But in the circumstances of this case the extent to which the"
"Court  should 
intervene 
in  the  exercise  of 
its  revisionary"
"powers  should  be  given  some  thought. To  set  aside  all  the"
"proceedings would be too sweeping and cause unnecessary"
"hardship,  inconvenience  and  delay.  The  substantial  relief"
"which  R.  B.  Madawela  wanted  when  he  first  intervened"
"was  the  exclusion  of  lot  4  in  plan  No.3392  of  17.8.1970"
"made  by  S.  T.  Gunasekera  Licensed  Surveyor  marked  X9"
"although  he  could  very  well  have  staked  a  claim  for  an"
"undivided 3 acres from the  whole land to include Lot 4. As"
"it  is  there  is  a  well  established fence  on  the  north  of  Lot  4"
"and,  as  I said before, even the plaintiff's husband referred"
"to this Lot as R.B. Madawelaâ€™s land at the first preliminary"
"survey.  Hence 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
infer 
that  after  his"
"purchase in 1943, R.B. Madawela fenced off a portion with"
"the  consent  of  Ensina  Pereira  who  was  the  owner  at  that"
"time of the entire remainder, and began possessing it as his"
"own. This is Lot 4 in plan X9. Accordingly it would meet the"
"ends  of 
justice 
if  without  setting  aside  the 
interlocutory"
"decree  it  is  only  amended  by  excluding  from  the  corpus"
