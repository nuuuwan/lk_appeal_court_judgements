"10"
"The  Court  of  Appeal  has  held  that  it  cannot  excuse  the"
"delay caused by the petitioner's appeal to the Committee of"
"Inquiry set up by the present Minister in 1977. The question"
"is, did the delay result from the petitioner pursuing a legal"
"remedy, not a remedy  which is extra legal. If the petitioner"
"has been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by"
"the  Law  he  cannot  be  guilty  of  culpable  delay.  Further  the"
"predisposition  of  parties  to  explore  other  lawful  avenues"
"which  hold  out  reasonable  expectation,  of  obtaining  relief"
"without  incurring  the  expense  of  coming  into  Court  cannot"
"be  overlooked  or  censored  and  any  delay  caused  thereby"
"cannot e characterized unjustifiable."
