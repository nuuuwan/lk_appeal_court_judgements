"drawn 
the  Preliminary  Plan  depicting  2  Roods  and  29.83"
"Perches as shown by the parties present at the survey."
"There is no dispute that there is another partition case (4063/P)"
"pending  in  the  same  District  Court  to  the  adjoining  land.    The"
"main reason given in the petition is that a portion of the corpus"
"in  4063/P  has  been  included  into  the  Preliminary  Plan  in  this"
"case. 
  According  to  the  copy  of  the  plaint 
in  4063/P,11  the"
"plaintiff in that case is the 1st petitioner to this application.  That"
"case  has  been  filed  on  24.02.2003  and  this  case  (4513/P)  on"
"26.06.2006.12    The  learned  counsel  for  the  6th,  11th  and  12th"
"defendants  submitted  that, 
if  that 
is  correct,  the  petitioners"
"could  have  shown  to  the  surveyor  the  correct  land  in  4063/P,"

"appears to me that a part of the land which is the subject matter"
"in  4063/P  has  been  included  into  this  case.  That  cannot  be"
"done.  The  Judgment  in  this  case  has  been  delivered  before  the"
"other case as there was no contest."
"According to Plan No. 1/2016, Lot Nos. 5 and 6 of the Surveyor"
"included 
into 
the 
Generalâ€™s  Plan  No.  A699,  have  also  been"
"corpus of this case.    Those two Lots are  shown in Plan 1/2016"
