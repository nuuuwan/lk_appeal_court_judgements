"The  two  plaintiffs  have  filed  this  action  (No.  4513/P)  by  plaint"
"dated 26.06.2006 in the District Court of Matugama to partition"
"the  land  in  extent  of  2  Roods  and  30  Perches  depicted  in  Plan"
"No. 112821 of the Surveyor General among the plaintiffs and the"
"1st-7th defendants. At the uncontested trial, only the 2nd plaintiff"
"has given evidence and marked the deeds.  After trial the learned"
"District  Judge  has  delivered  the  Judgment  dated  19.03.2014"
"partitioning the land among the two plaintiffs and the 1st-7th and"
"9th-12th  defendants.    The  Interlocutory  Decree  has  thereafter"
"been  entered,  and  commission  has  been  issued  to  prepare  the"
"final  scheme  of  partition.    Thereafter  the  five  petitioners  to  this"
"application  who  were  not  parties  to  the  main  case  have  made"
"applications to the District Court under section 839 of the Civil"
"Procedure  Code  seeking  to  set  aside  the  Judgment  and  the"
"Interlocutory  Decree on the basis that  parts of their lands have"
"also been included into the Preliminary Plan, which they became"
"aware for the first time when the surveyor came to the land  for"
"final  survey.    These  applications  have  rightly  been  rejected  by"
"the 
learned  District  Judge  by  order  dated  10.11.2016,  and"
"thereafter the leave to appeal application filed against that order"
"in  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  of  Kalutara  has"
"correctly 
been  withdrawn 
by 
the 
petitioners 
to 
file 
this"
"application 
for 
revision  and 
 
In 
the 
restitutio 
in 
integrum."
"meantime, 
the  proposed  Final  Plan  has  been  prepared  and"
"several  parties 
including  the  2nd  plaintiff  who  was  the  sole"
"witness at the trial have filed objections to the proposed scheme"
"of partition."
