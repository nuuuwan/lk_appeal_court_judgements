the 
time  of 
the  1st  plaintiff  giving  evidence  without  any"
"hindrance whatsoever.11"
"Notwithstanding 
the  plaintiffs 
in 
the  plaint  state 
that 
the"
"forfeiture and penalty are illegal, the 1st plaintiff knows nothing"
"about  the  factual  matters  relating  to  the  transaction  in  issue.12"
"All  what  the  1st  plaintiff  says  is  that  the  forfeiture  of  textile"
"material  and  imposing  fines  are  illegal,  and  what  the  customs"
"could  have  done  was  to  impose  custom  levies  and  not  fines."
"Had that been done, according to the 1st plaintiff, it was lawful.13"
"Ironically,  the  same  position  was  taken  by  the  3rd  defendant,"
"who is the alleged culprit, in his evidence given as the plaintiffsâ€™"
"witness.14 
 
If 
the  penalty  was 
recovered  as  custom 
levies,"
"according  to  them,  there  is  no  wrongful  loss  to  the  company!"
"How can that happen, I am unable to comprehend!"
"If that contention is taken at its best, the wrongful act has been"
"done  not  by  the  3rd  and  4th  defendants,  but  by  the  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs. 
 
In 
that  backdrop, 
I  cannot  understand  why  the"
"company  cannot  take  action  against  the  alleged  wrongful  acts"
"done by Sri Lanka Customs."
"This  position  of  the  plaintiffs,  and  the  3rd  and  4th  defendants"
"(who are father and son respectively) cannot be believed in view"
"of the fact that they were fully represented by eminent lawyers at"
"the customs inquiry."
