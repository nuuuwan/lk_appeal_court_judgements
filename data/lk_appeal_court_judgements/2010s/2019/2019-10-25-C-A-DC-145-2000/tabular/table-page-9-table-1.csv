he  wrongdoers  because  wrongdoers  are

"company."
"Are the 3rd and 4th defendants wrongdoers?  According to the 1st"
"plaintiff  who  gave  evidence  on  behalf  of 
the  plaintiffs,  and"
"according to the 3rd defendant who was called by the plaintiffs to"
"give evidence in support of the case for the plaintiffs, the 3rd and"
"4th defendants are not wrongdoers who acted to the detriment of"
"the  company  and  its  shareholders.    The  3rd  and  4th  defendants"
"fought their case to the maximum retaining best lawyers at the"
"customs  inquiry  and  paid  the  penalty.    At  best,  the  3rd  and  4th"
"defendants  agreed  to  pay  the  penalty  in  fear  of  death  threats."
"That  does  not  amount  to  committing  a  fraud  or  wrongdoing  by"
"the  3rd  and  4th  defendants  to  the  detriment  of  the  company,"
"which entitles the plaintiffs to sue the 1st defendant on behalf of"
"the company."
"On  the  other  hand,  if  the  3rd  and  4th  defendants  committed  a"
"wrongdoing  against  the  company,  why  no  reliefs  are  sought"
"against them?"
"Are the 3rd and 4th defendants in control of the company?  In the"
"facts and circumstances of this case, it is not possible.  They are"
"in the minority.  The majority shareholders are the plaintiffs."
"The 
fact  that  the  plaintiffs  called  the  3rd  defendant  to  give"
"evidence 
for  the  plaintiffs  present  ample  testimony  that  the"
"plaintiffsâ€™ action is misconceived in law."
"In  view  of  that  conclusion,  consideration  of  merits  of  the  case"
"does not arise."
