"05.","In  case No.5183P,  on behalf of the Appellant,  surveyor Alexandor Fonseka"
"","who prepared plan No.  1075 had been called to testify. According to him,  he"
"","has  assisted  Surveyor V.M.de  Silva to  survey  the  land  in  plan  3102  (1 V7)."
"","He  has  prepared the  plan  No.l075  (lVI0).  However,  in  cross  examination"
"","he admitted that he did not have the original of old plan No.6125 which was"
"","superimposed  on  plan No.l075.  He  admitted  that  he  did  not  have  that  old"
"","plan even at the time of survey (Page 221  of the brief). He then admitted that"
"","he  had  not  mentioned 
in  his  report  on  plan  No.  1075, 
the  fact 
that  he"
"","superimposed  the  said  old  plan.  Then  he  admitted  that  there  were  no  land"
"","marks  found  in  respect  of plan  6125  when  he  surveyed.  He  also  admitted"
"","that he  did not  superimpose the preliminary  plan No.  4887  on  his  plan No."
"","1075.  He  therefore  admitted  that  he  is  unable  to  say  what  lots  in  plan No."

"","tallies with the boundaries mentioned in the preliminary plan 'X'."
"07.","When deciding  on the  corpus to  be partitioned,  not only  the boundaries but"
"","also  the  extent  of the  land  would  be  useful.  When  the  2nd  Plaintiff Vijitha"
"","Hemawathi de  Silva gave evidence on the pedigree, she referred to the  deed"
"","No.  25703  dated 26.06.1936. As she could not obtain a certified copy of that"
"","deed,  she  submitted  a letter from  the Land Registry  Kalutara  as  P6,  stating"
"","that a certified copy  could not be  issued as  the deed  is  destroyed  (Page  128"
"","and  129  of the  court  record).  At 
that  stage 
the  Defendant  (Appellant)"
"","submitted  the  original  deed  as 
'1 VI'  from  their  custody.  On  perusing  the"
"","it  is  clear  that  both 
said  deed  1 VI  which  is  admitted  by  the  Appellant,"
