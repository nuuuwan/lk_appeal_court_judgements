"Basnayake  C.J.  at  page  329  stressed  the  point  with  vigor  and"
"force in the following terms:"
"When  an  Ordinance  or  an  Act  provides  that  a  decision"
"made  by  a  statutory 
functionary 
to  whom 
the 
task  of"
"making  a  decision  under  the  enactment  is  entrusted  shall"
"be  final,  the  Legislature  assumes  that  the  functionary  will"
"arrive at his decision in accordance with law and the rules"
"of  natural  justice  and  after  all  the  prescribed  conditions"
"precedent to the making of his decision have been fulfilled,"
"and 
that  where 
his 
jurisdiction  depends 
on 
a 
true"
"construction  of  an  enactment  he  will  construe  it  correctly."
"The Legislature also assumes that the functionary will keep"
"to  the limits of the  authority committed  to him  and  will not"
"act 
in  bad  faith  or  from  corrupt  motives  or  exercise  his"
"powers 
for  purposes  other 
than 
those  specified 
in 
the"
"statute or be influenced by grounds alien or irrelevant to the"
"powers  taken  by  the  statute  or  act  unreasonably.  To  say"
"that 
the  word  “final”  has 
the  effect  of  giving  statutory"
"sanction to a decision however  wrong, however contrary to"
"the  statute,  however  unreasonable  or  influenced  by  bad"
"faith  or  corrupt  motives, 
is  to  give  the  word  a  meaning"
"which  it  is  incapable  of  bearing  and  which  the  Legislature"
"could never have contemplated. The Legislature entrusts to"
"responsible  officers 
the 
task  of  carrying  out 
important"
"functions  which  affect 
the  subject 
in 
the 
faith 
that 
the"
"officers 
to  whom 
such 
functions 
are 
entrusted  will"
