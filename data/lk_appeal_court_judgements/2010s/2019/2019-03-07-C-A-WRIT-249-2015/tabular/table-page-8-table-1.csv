"scrupulously  observe  all  the  requirements  of  the  statute"
"which  authorize  them  to  act.  It 
is 
inconceivable  that  by"
"using such  a  word  as “final”  the Legislature  in effect said,"
"whatever determination the Land Commissioner may make,"
"be it within the statute or be it not, be it in accordance with"
"it  or  be  it  not,  it  is final,  in  the  sense  that  the  legality  of  it"
"cannot  be  agitated  in  the  Courts.  No  case  in  which  such  a"
"meaning has been given to the word ‘final’ was cited to us."
"The word “final” is not a cure for all the sins of commission"
"and  omission  of  a  statutory 
functionary  and  does  not"
"render 
legal  all  his 
illegal  acts  and  place  them  beyond"
"challenge  in  the  Courts.  The  word  “final”  and  the  words"
"“final  and  conclusive”  are  familiar 
in  enactments  which"
"seek  to  limit  the  right  of  appeal;  but  no  decision  of  either"
"this Court or any other Court has been cited to us in which"
"those  expressions  have  been  construed  as  ousting 
the"
"jurisdiction 
of 
the  Courts 
to 
declare 
in 
appropriate"
"proceedings that the action of a public functionary who has"
"acted contrary to the statute is illegal."
