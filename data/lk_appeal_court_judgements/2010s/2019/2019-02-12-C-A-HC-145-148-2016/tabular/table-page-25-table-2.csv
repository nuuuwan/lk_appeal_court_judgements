L.  R. 
Sub-Inspector  of  Police,  Matara 
["
"Basnayake,  c.]. has  held  that where  proceedings are instituted under"
"section  148  (1) 
(b)  of  the  Code, 
the  evidence  of  the  person  who"
"brought 
the  accused  before 
the  court  need  not  be 
recorded.  The"
"learned  Chief Justice  would  appear  to  have  confined  the  application"
"of section  151  (2),  so far  as  it requires  the evidence of the  person  who"
"brought  the  accuse  d before  the  court  to  be  recorded, 
to  cases  where"
"no  report  is  filed  under  section  148  (1) 
(b). 
If that  be 
the  correct"
