"II 
section  425  provides 
that 
no 
judgment  passed  by  a  court  of"
"reversed  or  altered  on  appeal  or 
competent  jurisdiction  shall  be"
"revision  on  account (a),  of any error,  omission  or irregularity in  the"

or 
other"
"proceedings  before  or  during  trial . ... unless  such  error,  omission,"
"irregularity .

"time  when  it was  thought that  the  positive  requirements  of the  Code"
"were  all  essential,  and 
that  any  breach  of  such  a  requirement"
"constituted  an  illegality.  The  supporters  of this  view  generally  rely"

the  only  possible"
"view,  section  425  will  be  of little  use,  for  it  is  in  just  those  cases"
"where  an  express  provision  of the  Code  has  been  violated  that  the"
"section 425 can  serve any purpose."
