"I
  cannot  understand  on  what  basis  the 
learned  High  Court"
"Judge  has  stated  that  there  are  no  exceptional  grounds  when"
"the  appellant 
in 
the  petition 
itself  has  averred  exceptional"
"grounds."
"In  my  view,  there  is  no  magic  about  “exceptional  grounds”.    If"
"the  order  complained  of 
is  manifestly  erroneous,  that 
is  an"
"exceptional  ground  to  invoke  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Court.    In  cases  where  the  aggrieved  party’s  only  remedy  is  to"
"come by way of revision, such as in a section 66 application, as"
"the  right  of  appeal  is  expressly  denied  by  section  74(2)  of  the"
"Act, 
in  my  view,  averring  exceptional  circumstances 
is  not"
"necessary.  Showing “exceptional circumstances” as a threshold"
"test becomes necessary only in instances where a party who has"
"the  right  of  appeal  comes  before  the  Appellate  Court  by  way  of"
"revision."
"Regarding  the  other  ground  on  which  the  revision  application"
"was dismissed, no submissions were made by either party before"
"this Court that a civil case was pending in respect of the dispute"
"in the District Court.  I find no such proof in the brief either.  On"
"the  other  hand,  pending  a  civil  case  does  not  prevent 
the"
"the  High  Court 
from  entertaining  an 
Magistrate’s  Court  or"
"application  under  section  66  so  long  as  no  interim  order  has"
"been made by the District Court."
"In this regard, this is what Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) stated in"
"Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam:3"
