"that  he  has  committed  an  act  which

"submitted  with  annexures  compendiously  marked  as  R4  fortifies"
"this position."
"Thereafter,  as  seen  from  R5,  the  Monetary  Board  inter  alia  has"
"decided to issue a show cause letter to the Habib Bank as to why"
"the Central Bank shall not determine that the petitioner is not a fit"
"and  proper  person  to  hold  the  office  of  the  Country  Manager  of"
"Habib Bank in Sri Lanka."
