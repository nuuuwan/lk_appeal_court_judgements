onetary  Board  and 
the  Monetary  Board  has  by  R10  dated"
"07.07.2011  (or  15.07.2011)  decided  to  direct  the  Habib  Bank  to"
"remove the petitioner from the post of Country Manager."
"However,  as  seen  from  R6,  by  that  time,  the  petitioner  had  been"
"removed from that post and a new acting appointment had already"
"been  made  by  the  Habib  Bank.    Further,  as  seen  from  R8,  the"
"Habib  Bank  has  already  decided  not  to  renew  the  petitioner’s"
"contract which was to expire on 31st July 2011."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  I  cannot  accept  the  argument  of  the"
"learned  President’s  Counsel  that  the  Monetary  Board  abdicated"
"their  statutory  duty  when  they  took  the  decision  as  reflected  in"
"P12."
"The  last  submission  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"petitioner  is  that  the  impugned  decision  was  taken  in  violation  of"
"the  rules  of  natural  justice  in  that  the  petitioner  was  not  given  a"
"full hearing.  I am not impressed by that submission.  There was a"
"Spot Examination carried out by the Bank Supervision Division as"
"seen  from  P6.    Thereafter,  as  seen  from  R3,  the  petitioner  was"
"given  a  “patient  hearing”  by  a  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Central"
"Bank.    Thereafter  with  a  copy  of  the  Spot  Examination  Report"
"marked  P6,  the  petitioner  has  been  asked  to  show  cause  why  he"
"should not be removed from the post.  The petitioner has presented"
"his 
explanation 
by 
P10. 
 
In 
the  meantime,

"investigations have been carried out by the Habib Bank1 regarding"
"this “massive exchange racket”.2  The adverse findings contained in"
