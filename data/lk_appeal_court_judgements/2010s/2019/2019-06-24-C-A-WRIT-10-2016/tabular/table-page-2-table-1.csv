ahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The  petitioner  filed  this  writ  application  seeking  several  reliefs"
"against  the  Director  General  of  Customs,  Minister  of  Finance,"
"Secretary to the Treasury etc. on calculation of taxes and levies"
"in relation to importation of a “Permit Vehicle”.  As seen from the"
"proceedings  dated  26.10.2018,  upon  counsel  for  the  petitioner"
"vehemently objecting another date being granted to the State to"
"file objections to the application of the petitioner, this Court was"
"compelled 
to 
refix 
the  matter 
for  argument  on  13.11.2018"
"without objections being filed.  Subsequent to oral submissions,"
"this  Court  granted  both  parties  to  file  written  submissions  and"
"fixed the matter for the Judgment for today."
"When  I  read  the  case  record  to  prepare  for  the  Judgment,  I"
"realized that this is not a case which could be decided  ex parte"
"without affording an opportunity for the State to file objections,"
"as the Judgment of this case, if decided ex parte in favour of the"
"petitioner, will confine to the two parties to the case, but might"
"result in grave repercussions, if applications are made by those"
"who  are 
similarly 
circumstanced, 
leading 
to 
serious 
fiscal"
"implications."
"This  was  put  into  writing  by  me  on  03.06.2009  and  handed  it"
"over  to  the  counsel  for  the  petitioner  (and  the  respondents)  to"
"see  whether  the  counsel  for  the  petitioner  is  agreeable  to  allow"
"the  State  to  file  objections  and  refix  the  matter  for  argument."
"Despite  writ  being  a  discretionary  remedy,  counsel 
for 
the"
"petitioner  on  10.06.2019 
informed  Court 
that  he  was  not"
