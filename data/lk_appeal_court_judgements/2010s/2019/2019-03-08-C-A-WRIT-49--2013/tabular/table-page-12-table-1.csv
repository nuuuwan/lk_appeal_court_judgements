"","This  Court  must  observe 
that 
the  Land  Commissioner  General  has 
issued"
"","Circular  No.  2013/01  titled,  'Accelerated  Programme  on  solving  post  conflict"
"","State

issues 
in 
the  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces' 
to  all  Divisional"
"","Secretaries 
in 
the  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces

"","Circular,  annexed  to the  petition  marked  'P3A'  sets  out clearly  the  steps  that"
"","must be tak€f: 
by the Divisional Secretaries to resolve the outstanding issues of"
"","the  people  living  in  the  said  Provinces  with  regard  to State  lands,  irrespective"
"","of  ethnicity.  Thus,  a  mechanism 
to  address 
the  grievances  of  all  citizens"

"","addressed  by the PTF  or that he was discriminated on the basis of his ethnicity."
"","In 
the  above  circumstances, 
this  Court  does  not  see  any  merit  in 
the  final"

'Pl'  and"
"","'P2'  are  mere  recommendations,  which  are  not liable to be  quashed  by way of"
