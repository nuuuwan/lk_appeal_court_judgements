that  ordering 
reinstatement  causes"
"","employer-employee unrest in  the opinion of the Commissioner he  could"

instead  of  ordering  the  employer  to  continue  to"

"","Although  the above cases  were  categorized  as  taking  a liberal view,  this Court"
"","observes  that  in  each  of  the  said  cases, 
there  were  clearly  identifiable  and"
"","compelling 
reasons  as 
to  why 
reinstatement  could  not  be  made  and 
the"
"","making of an  order for compensation was the only option available."
"","Applying the rationale laid down in the judgments referred to above, this Court"
"","is  of the view that the"" use  of the word  'may'  in  Section  6 of the TEW  Act  does"
"","in  fact confer the Commissioner General  of Labour a discretion on  whether to"
"","order  reinstatement  with  back  wages  or to  limit the  relief  to  compensation."
"","This  Court  is  further  of the  view  that  the  termination  of employment  of an"
"","employee  contrary  to  the  provisions  of  Section  2(1)  of  the  TEW  Act  would"
"","under  normal 
circumstances  attract 
reinstatement  with  back  wages, 
as"
"","provided for in Section 6.  However, there can  be  exceptional situations as  have"
"","arisen 
in 
the  judgments  referred  to  above,  which  justify  the  Commissioner"
"","General  of Labour  making  an  order for compensation . This  Court  is  therefore"
"","of the  view  that  while  reinstatement  with  back  wages  should  be  the  norm,"
"","awarding of compensation,  depending on  the facts  and  circumstances  of each"
"","case,  should  be the exception."
"","This  brings  me 
to 
the  next  question 
-
should 
the  1st  Respondent . have"
"","the  payment  of  compensation  as  opposed 
to  reinstatement? 
It 
considered"
