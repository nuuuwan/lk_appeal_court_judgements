"""section 6 must also  apply in  situations where reinstatement has  become"
"impossible  pendente  lite.  A  workman  due  to  retire  in  one  year's  time"
"might complain  of wrongful termination. The  anomalous  consequence  of"
"the  Petitioner's  interpretation  would  be  that if the  Commissioner's  order"
"the  workman  could  be 
was  made  be/ore  the  due  date  of  retirement,"
"awarded  reinstatement  and  back  wages  up  to  that  date;  but  if  it  was"
"made  ~ven  one  day 
thereafter,  he  could  get  nothing.  The  contrary"
"interpretation,  however,  avoids  anomaly,  inconvenience  and  injustice:  if"
"the Commission'er finds himself unable to order reinstatement although"
"he  holds the termination to be  unlawful,  he  can  nevertheless  order the"
"employer  to  pay  the  workman  ""his  wages  and all  other bene/its  which"
"received"". 
It 
is  unnecessary 
to 
the  workman  would  otherwise  have"
"consider  whether 
that  amounts 
to 
""compensation""  or  not,  because"
"section  6  expressly  empowers  the  Commissioner  to  order  payment  of"
"""wages""  and  ""benefits"".  The  Petitioner's  restrictive  interpretation  would"
"create  other  anomalies 
too.  Thus, 
the  Commissioner  may 
find 
that"
"although  termination  was  not justified  the  workman  was  guilty  of some"
"lapse  which  merited  some  punishment,  and 
that  therefore  part  of  the"
"back  wages  should  be  withheld .  However,  the  Petitioner's  interpretation"
"would  deprive 
the  Commissioner  of 
the  equitable  power 
to  order"
"anything  less  than  full  back  wages .  In  my  view,  the  conferment  of the"
"power to grant  the  greater  relief  includes  the  power to  grant the  lesser"
"relief. Accordingly,  I hold  that  ""may""  in  section  6 confers  a discretion  on"
"the  Commissioner; that ""and""  must  be  interpreted disjunctively;  and  that"
"the Commissioner had  the power to order payment of wages and  benefits"
"for  the  balance  period  of the  2nd  Respondent's contract  without  making"
