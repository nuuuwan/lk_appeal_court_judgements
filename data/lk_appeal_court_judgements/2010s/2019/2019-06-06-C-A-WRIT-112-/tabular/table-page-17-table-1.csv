"""the doctrine of laches in  Courts of Equity is  not an  arbitrary or a technical"
"doctrine.  Where  it  would  be  practically  unjust  to  give  a  remedy,  either"
"because  the  party  has,  by  his  conduct,  done  that which  might  fairly  be"
"regarded  as  equivalent  to  a  waiver  of  it,  or  where  by  his  conduct  and"
"neglect  he  has,  though  perhaps  not  waiving  that  remedy,  yet  put  the"
"other party in  a situation in  which it would not be  reasonable to place him"
"if the  remedy  were  afterwards  to  be  asserted,  in  either  of these  cases,"
"lapse  of  time  and  delay  are  most  material.  But 
in  every  case, 
if  an"
"argument  against  relief,  which  otherwise would  be  just,  is  founded  upon"
"mere delay, that delay of course  not amounting to a bar by any statute of"
"limitations,  the  validity  of  that  defence  must  be 
tried  upon  principles"
"important 
in  such 
substantially  equitable.  Two  circumstances,  always"
"cases,  are, the  length  of the delay and  the nature of the acts  done during"
