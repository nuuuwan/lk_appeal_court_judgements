"lower Court took the view that there was no valid acceptance of"
"the gift.  Setting aside the said Judgment, it was held in appeal:"
"Under the Roman-Dutch Law no particular form is required"
"for the acceptance of the gift.  It is in every case a question"
"of fact whether or not there are sufficient indications of the"
"acceptance by the donee."
"A  deed  of  gift  to  a  minor  may  be  accepted  by  the  minor"
"himself  or  through  any  agent  recognised  by  him  for  that"
"purpose.   A future husband of a minor daughter is entitled"
"to act as an agent in that behalf."
