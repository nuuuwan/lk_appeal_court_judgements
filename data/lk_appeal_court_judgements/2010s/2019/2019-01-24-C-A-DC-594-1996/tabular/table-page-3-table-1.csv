"(a) There was no acceptance of the Deed of Gift"
"(b) The Deed of Revocation is valid"
"At  the  time  the  Deed  of  Gift  was  executed  the  two  donees  were"
"minors.  Therefore, the gift has been accepted, on the face of the"
"Deed of Gift, by Chandrasena, on behalf of Seelawathie whom he"
"has  identified  in  the  Deed  as  his  wife,  and  Seelawathie’s  sister,"
"the 1st defendant Pushpawathie.  Notwithstanding Chandrasena"
"in  the  Deed  of  Gift  has  identified  himself  as  the  husband  of"
"Seelawathie and the son-in-law of the donor Jinadasa, according"
"to 
the  Marriage  Certificate  marked  P11,  Chandrasena  and"
"Seelawathie  have  got  married  about  one  month  after 
the"
"execution of the said Deed."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  has  cited  a"
"number  of  authorities  for  the  proposition  that  “for  there  to  be"
"proper  acceptance  of  a  donation,  either  the  person  should  be"
"recognized by law  as  a lawful guardian, such  as  mother, father,"
"grandmother 
or 
grandfather, 
or 
there 
need 
to 
be 
lawful"
"authorization  for  such  by  a  third  party  to  accept  a  donation  on"
"behalf of a minor”.  According to the learned President’s Counsel,"
"there was no proper acceptance of the said gift as stated above,"
"and  therefore  the  gift  is  invalid.    I  regret  my  inability  to  accept"
"that argument."
"The general principle is that a donation is not complete unless it"
"is accepted by the donee."
