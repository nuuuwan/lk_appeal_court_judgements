"M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J."
"This is an appeal from the judgment of the District Court of Tangalle"
"dated  19.07.1995,  in  respect  of  a  partition  action  bearing  case  No."
"2023/P."
"When this matter was taken up for hearing, this Court observed that"
"main  averment  of  the  2nd  Defendant-Appellant  (Appellant)  is  that  a"
"share  of  the  subject  matter  which  he  purchased  by  Deed  No.  18656"
"dated 27.04.1976 marked as “2D1” has not been given to him by the"
"learned Trail Judge, while the other deeds of the Appellant marked as"
"“2D2” and “2D3” have been accepted by the Judge and the Appellant"
"has obtained a share of 88/720 by these two deeds."
"It is to be noted that, according to the judgment of the Trial Judge, the"
"main  reason  for  the  decision  to  deprive  the  alleged  share  22/720  of"
"the  Appellant  is  the  failure,  to  register  the  deed  2D1  in  the  proper"
"folio."
"The Appellant stated that the above share of the land which belonged"
"to a co-owner one Davith had been sold by him to the Appellant  and"
"several years after that again to the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent. The said"
"Davith’s name appears in the 2nd Plaintiff-Appellant’s deed bearing No."
"10 dated 05.11.1979 (P7). He further stated that the said Davith who"
"was entitled to 22/720 share had already sold his share by Deed 2D1"
"before  executing  the  Deed  P7,  more  than  three  years  ago.  Therefore,"
"the  Appellant  is  in  position  that  the  subsequent  deed  P7  has  no"
"validity as far as the share of the said Daavith is concerned."
"It  is  also  revealed  from  the  case  record  that  the  previous  owner  who"
"had a large share of the subject land has registered his deed No. 2814"
"3"
