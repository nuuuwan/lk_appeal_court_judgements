"","09.11.1949  had  transferred  another  portion  of the  land  of one  rood  to  the"
"","said  Jinadasa.  The  Respondent  further  stated  that  by  deed  No.  5747  dated"
"","05.09.1961, said Jinadasa had transferred the above lands to him and that he"
"","had  been  possessing 
the 
said 
lands  as  one 
land  and 
that  he  had  not"
"","encroached into appellants land. He prayed that the plaint be dismissed."
"03.","After  trial 
the 
learned  District  judge  dismissed  the  plaint.  Among  other"
"","reasons,  the  learned  District  Judge  said  in  her  Judgment  that  the  appellant"
"","had asked for  declaration of title for undivided land and that he had changed"
"","his stance at the trial."
"04.","Being  aggrieved  by 
the  said  judgment  of the  District  Judge, 
the 
instant"
"","appeal was lodged by the appellant."
"05.","We have considered the pleadings in the District Court, evidence adduced at"
"","the 
trial 
and 
submissions  made 
by 
counsel 
for  Appellants 
and 
the"
"","Respondents at the argument of the appeal."
"06.","At  the  argument  of the  instant  appeal,  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted"
"","that the land  in  suit has  to  be defined  for  an  action  for  declaration  of title to"
"","succeed.  Counsel  further  conceded that on the evidence adduced at the trial,"
"","the  land  in  question  was  an  undivided  land  and  that  it was  a  portion  of a"
"","larger  land.  Therefore,  he  conceded  that  there  is  no  merit  in  this  appeal."
"","Counsel  for  the  appellant  further  contended  that  a partition  action  has  been"
"","already filed to divide the land among the co-owners."
"07.","As submitted by the counsel for  the respondent, during the trial the appellant"
"","had  admitted 
the  averments  no.  3,  4,  5,  and  6  of  the  answer  of  the"
"","Respondent.  (Vide  proceedings  dated  10.06.1998) Therefore,  the  Appellant"
"","had taken a position different to what he took in his plaint."
