"","Is  the above averment, which  is  supported  by an  affidavit of the Commissioner"
"","General of Labour, an  honest and truthful declaration of what transpired at the"
"","inquiry  that  was  held  on  26th  August  2015  before  the  4th  Respondent?  This"
"","Court does not think so for three reasons."
"","The first is that there is  no su pporting affidavit from the 4 t h  Respondent."
"","The  second is that if such  a discussion  did take  place  and  if the 3rd  Respondent"
"","did  submit  the  relevant  salary  sheets,  why  is 
it  that  the  minutes  of the  said"
"","discussion  maintained by the 4 th  Respondent marked  'AI'  not reflect that fact?"
"","It  must  be  stated  that  other  than  what  has  been  re-produced  earlier  in  this"
"","judgment, the  said  minutes of the  discussion  held  on  26th  August  2015 do not"
"","contain  any  other discussion  on  the  payment  of EPF, 
including on  the  liability"
"","to contribute to the EPF on allowances."
"","The final reason why the averments in  paragraph 6 are  not true arises from the"
"","quantum  of 
the  allowance.  The  Respondents  state 
that 
the  promotional"
"","allowance  paid  for the period September 2008 - November 2012  is Rs.  30,000."
"","The  Petitioner  however  submits  that  for  the  months  of  September  2008  -"
"","March  2009,  the  3 rd  Respondent  was  only  paid  his  basic  salary.  This  is  borne"
"","out  by 
the  salary  slips  for  the  respective  months,  annexed 
to  the  petition"
"","marked  'P13a'  -
'P13g' . If this  be  so,  the  statement  that  Rs.  30,000  was  paid"
"","from  September 2008  is  incorrect.  Furthermore,  only  a sum  of Rs. 25,000  has"
"","been  paid  as  promotional  allowance  for the  months  of April  -
