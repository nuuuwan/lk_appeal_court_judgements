"officer authorised in  that behalf by him ... "", the EPF  Act is  silent as to the kind of"
"hearing  that should  be  afforded  to an  employer,  before  determining whether"
"an  em ployer  has  failed  to  comply  with  the  statutory  obligation  laid  down  in"
"Section  10 of the EPF  Act to remit the contributions of the employer as  well as"
"the employee, to the EPF."
"Applying  the  aforementioned  judicial  dicta, 
it  is 
the  view  of  this  Court  that"
"whenever a complaint is  received  that an  employer  has  not complied  with  its"
"obligations contained in the EPF  Act, the Department of Labour must:"
"(a) 
inform  the  employer  of the  nature  of the  complaint  of non-compliance"
"made  against 
it,  and  where  available,  make  available  copies  of  the"
"complaint to the employer;"
"(b) 
afford 
the  employer  an  opportunity 
to 
respond  and 
clarify  matters"
"relating to such  complaint;"
"(c) 
afford the  employee  an  opportunity of responding  to the  position  of the"
"employer."
"This  Court  is  of the  view  that the  above  process  would  enable the  Officers  of"
"the  Department of Labour to arrive  at  a decision  which  is  reasonable  by  both"
"parties.  This  Court  must  state  that  the  form  of the  hearing  -
i.e.  whether  it"
"should  be  an  oral  hearing;  whether the  parties should  have  the  right to  cross"
"examine 
the  other  party;  whether 
it  should  be  on  documents  and/or  on"
"written  submissions;  or whether it should  be  a combination  of the  above -
