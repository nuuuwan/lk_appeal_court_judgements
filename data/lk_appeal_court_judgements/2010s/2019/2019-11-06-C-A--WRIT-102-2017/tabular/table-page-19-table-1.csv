"best  left to  be  decided  by  the  relevant  Officer of the  Department of Labour,"
"taking  into consideration the particular circumstances of each  complaint."
"Bearing  in  mind  the  above  dicta,  this  Court will  now  consider what transpired"
"in  this  application.  Pursuant  to  the  complaint  of the  3'd  Respondent  marked"
"'P2',  the  4th  Respondent  directed  the  Petitioner  to  be  present  for an  inquiry,"
"which 
is  an  admission  by  the  Department  of  Labour  that  it  cannot  take  a"
"decision  on the said  complaint without affording the  Petitioner a hearing. The"
"Petitioner did  present  itself before the  4 th  Respondent  on  26th  August  2015.  A"
"discussion  on  the  complaint took  place  that day  between  the  4th  Respondent,"
"Petitioner  and  the  3'd  Respondent.  This  Court  is  of  the  view  that  given  the"
"general  nature of the complaint made by the 3'd  Respondent  in  'P2'  [Le.  ®l  CSX)"
"erdOCl~  @~ (EPF)  ~ 05~  1!(5)el®c:>  ~ 00  @eiJ~L what  was 
5\®"
"required  was  to ascertain  if contributions  had  been  made to the EPF  on  behalf"
"of the  3'd  Respondent,  and  to that extent, the said  discussion was  sufficient to"
"satisfy compliance with the rules  of natural justice. In  these circumstances, this"
"Court  would  not  insist  on  a  more  formal 
inquiry,  as  the  issue 
involved  was"
"whether  the  contributions  had  been  made  or  not.  As  observed  earlier,  the"
"position  of  the  Petitioner 
that 
the  EPF 
that  the  3'd  Respondent  accepted"
"contributions  have  been  made  on 
time  is  confirmed  by 
the  minutes  of  the"
"discussion  maintained  by the 4th  Respondent, marked  'AI'. It is therefore clear"
"to  this  Court  that  (a) 
the  discussion  on  26 th  August  2015 
revolved  only  on"
"whether  the  Petitioner  had  complied  with  its  obligation  to  contribute  to  the"
"EPF  on  behalf  of the  3'd  Respondent;  (b)  the  said  discussion  did  not  revolve"
"around  the  non-payment of EPF  on  certain  allowances that the  Petitioner had"
"the  discussion  on 
paid  the  3'd  Respondent,  and  (c) 
the  complaint  of the  3'd"
"Respondent relating to EPF  ended  on  26 t h August 2015."
