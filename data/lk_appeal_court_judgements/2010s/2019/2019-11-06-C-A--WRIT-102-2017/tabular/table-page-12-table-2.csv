"an  administrative  body which  is  to  decide  must  hear both sides  and give"
"both  an  opportunity  of hearing  before  a  decision  is  taken.  No  man  can"

"until  he  has  had  a  fair  opportunity  of answering 
the  complaint  made"
"against  him.  Thus,  objectors  at  public 
inquiries  must  be  given  a  fair"
"evidence, 
even 
though 
the 
statutory 
opportunity 
to  meet  adverse"
"provisions  do  not cover the  case  expressly.  (Vide  Errington  and others  v."
