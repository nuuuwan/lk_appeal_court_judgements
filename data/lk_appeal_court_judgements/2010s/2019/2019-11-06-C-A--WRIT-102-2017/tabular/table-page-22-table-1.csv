"","borne  out by the salary slips for the respective months, annexed to the petition"
"","marked  'P13h'  -
'P13i'.  This  too  means  t hat  t he  averment  in  paragraph  6  is"
"","incorrect,  and  that  the  discussion  that  the  Respond ents  claim  took  place  on"
"","26th  August 2015 did  not actually take place ."
"","The  Petitioner admit s that during the  second  stint of his  employment, the  3rd"
"","Respondent  was  paid  a 
reimbursement  allowance  of  Rs.  55,000  and 
a"
"","promotional  allowance  of  Rs.  60,000.  From 
the  above  averment  of  the"
"","Respondents,  it is  clear that the  Petitioner has been  directed to pay  EPF  on the"
"","promotional  allowance  of  Rs. 
60,000.  However,  when  one  considers 
the"
"","attachment to 'P6'  which  gives the brea kdow n of t he sums  due,  it is  apparent"
"","that the  Respondents  have  calculated  t he  EP F on an allowance  of Rs.  55,000,"
"","which  then  means t hat 'P6'  does  not relate  to the  promotional  allowance  but"
"","to the reimbursement allowance of Rs . 55,000."
"","In fact,  in paragraph  18 of the Statement of  Objections, the  Respondents state"
"","that,  'the  insertion  of reimbursable  allowances  in  every  solary  slip  of the  3 rd"
"","Respondent shows the intention of the Petitioner to recognise such payment as"
"","in 
t he  very  next  paragraph, 
the 
earnings  of  the  3rd  Petitioner.'  However,"
"","Respondents 
state 
that, 
'the 
promotional 
allowance 
paid 
to 
the 
3rd"
"","Respondent amounts to a fixed (recurring)  allowance and should be considered"
"","as earnings in calculation of the EPF.'"
"","Thus,  it appears  to this  Court that there is confusio n even  in  the  minds  of the"
"","Respondents  with  regard  to  the  allowance  that  attracts  the  payment  of EPF."
"","The  end  result  is  that  the  averment that  it 'was  revealed  (at  the  inquiry)  that"
"","EPF on  promotional allowances had not been paid'  is  inco rrect."
