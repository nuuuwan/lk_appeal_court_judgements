"In  Lalith  Oeshapriya vs.  Captain  Weerakoon and Others,  Marsoof, J/President"
"of the Court of Appeal  (as  he then was) held as follows :lO"
"""Even  more serious is the violation of the two cardinal principles of natural"
"justice embodied in  the maxims 'audi alteram  partem ' and 'nemo judex in"
"causa  sua  potest'.  The  first  of these  principles  postulates  a  fair  hearing"
"are 
affected  by  a  quasi 
judicial  or 
before 
the 
rights  of  a  citizen"
"In 
this  context, 
it  is  now  recognised  that  'qui 
administrative  decision."
"aliquid statuerit parte in audita  altera acquum  licet discerit,  haud acquum"
"fecerit' 
- which  means 
that  he  who  determines  any  matter  without"
"hearing  both  sides, 
though  he  may  have  decided  right,  has  not  done"
"justice.  According 
the  jurisprudence  built  around  the 
'audi  alteram 
to"
"partem' principal,  there should not only be a hearing of both sides,  but the"
"hearing  should be  more  than  a  pretence.  The  procedure followed should"
"be fair and conducive to  the achievement of justice.  In  Board of Education"
"v Ricel l  Lord Loreburn,  L. C.  in  his famo us dictum  laid down  that a tribunal"
"was under duty to ""act in  good faith, and fairl y listen to bath sides for that"
"is  a  duty  lying  upon  everyone  who  decides  anything.""  In  De  Verteuil  v"
"Knaqqs12 it was laid down as follows:"
"""In  general, 
the  requirements  of natural  justice  are  first, 
that  the"
"person  accused  should  know  the  nature  of the  accusation  made;"
"secondly,  that he should be given  an  opportunity to state his case;"
"and thirdly, that the tribunal should act in  good faith .,,13"
