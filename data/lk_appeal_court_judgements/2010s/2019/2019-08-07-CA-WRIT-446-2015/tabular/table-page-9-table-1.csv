"on the material presented before it."
"Hence on the available evidence I am compelled to conclude that"
"the complaint of the consumer was prescribed when it was made"
"to  the  Consumer  Affairs Authority.  There is no evidence to the"
"satisfaction  of  the Authority or Court that the consumer lodged"
"the  written complaint within three months from the date of the"
"purchase  of  the  machine  or  during  the  course  of  its  warranty,"
"which extended up to six months from the date of the purchase."
"In this view of the matter, there is no necessity to deal with the"
"other arguments taken up by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for"
"the Petitioner."
"The  decision  of  the  Consumer  Affairs  Authority  contained  in"
"P8(a), P8(b) and P9 is quashed by way of writ of certiorari."
"Application is allowed.  No costs."
