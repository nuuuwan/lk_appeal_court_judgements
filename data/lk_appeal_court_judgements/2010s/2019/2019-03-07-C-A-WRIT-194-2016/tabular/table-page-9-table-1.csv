"independent  contractor,  there  was  no  such  necessity  to"
"look after her health."
"8.  By  P6(a)  the  5th  respondent  has 
inter  alia  stated  that"
"instead  of  physically  signing  the  attendance  register,  she"
"was  asked  to  place  her 
finger  print  on  a 
finger  print"
"machine.    This  has  been  admitted  by  the  petitioner  in"
"paragraph  7(d)  of  P7.    That  means,  her  working  hours"
"have  been  closely  monitored  without  leaving  any  room  to"
"cheat the employer."
"If  the  working  hours  of  the  5th  respondent  was  closely"
"monitored  in  that  manner,  the  denial  of  the  petitioner"
"employer that there was no control over her taking leave of"
"work by the company is plainly unacceptable."
"9.  Further,  the  petitioner  in  paragraph  7(b)  of  the  further"
"written submissions tendered to the Labour Commissioner"
"marked P7 has stated as follows:"
"“The  Complainant  was  expected 
to 
render  consultancy"
"services between 7.30 am to 5.45 pm to the Company at its"
"various plants and factories as directed by the Respondent"
"from  time  to  time  and  did  not  report  to  any  specified  or"
"regular place of work as akin to employment.”"
"This goes to show how she was controlled by the employer"
"by giving directions.  This further goes to show that, even"
"in  instances  where  she  had  to  go  to  various  other  plants"
"and  factories  of  the  petitioner  company,  she  had  to  work"
"during specified working hours, i.e. between 7.30 am-5.45"
"pm.    No  concession  regarding  working  hours  has  been"
"given in any circumstances."
