into  account, 
it 
is  clear  that  the"
"petitioner  company  has  had  a  heavy  control  over 
the  5th"
"respondent in the discharge of her duties as a Consultant in the"
"petitioner  company. 
  There 
is  no 
law 
that  people  who  are"
"recruited  as  Consultants  or  discharging  duties  as  Consultants"
"shall  necessarily 
fall  within 
the

"Commissioner  of  Labour  in  P9A  that  there  was  an  employer-"
"employee 
relationship  between 
the  petitioner 
and 
the  5th"
"respondent is flawless."
