"pt respondent was  influenced  by the 3rd  respondent and  the result was  that the"
"former  decided  to  acquire  the  land  in  question  and  thereafter  necessary  steps"
"were  taken  to  acquire  it.  There  is  no  convincing  evidence  before  this  Court  to"
"come  to the finding that the  pt respondent  exercised  his  powers  in  bad  faith.  If"
"there is sufficient evidence that he exercised his power due to political reasons as"
"alleged by the petitioner or for any other consideration, then it could be  held that"
"the acquiring authority had  acted  in  bad  faith  or mala fide.  But such  evidence  is"
"not forthcoming in this case."""
