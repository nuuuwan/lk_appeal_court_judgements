"""In Hollington v Hewthom &  Co., Ltd., a conviction of one of the defendants for careless driving was"
"held  to  be  inadmissible  as  evidence  of his  negligence  in proceedings for damages  on  that ground"
"against him and his employer. But, ""had the defendant before the Magistrate pleaded guilt"" or made"
"some admission in giving evidence that would  have supported  the plaintiff's case,  this  could have"
"been proved but not the result of the trial."""
