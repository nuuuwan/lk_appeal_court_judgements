"the  reliefs  jointly  and  severally 
f)  Therefore  the  Plaintiff  has  a  right  to  obtain  all"
"against the 1st  and 2nd Defendants."
"The judgment  contains  nothing  more  than  the itemized  narration  as  given  above.  I  am"
"afraid that this is  hardly the kind of judgment that would pass muster in a merit based"
"revisionary or appellate jurisdiction."
"There is no discussion as  to how the voluntary plea  to a charge in the Magistrate's Court"
"establishes negligence on the part of the 1st  Defendant. What was the charge to which the"
"1
st Defendant pleaded in the Magistrate's Court (MC)? Did that charge pertain to items of"
"negligence on the part of the 1st Defendant? There is no evidence given of the Magistrate's"
"Court proceedings and it is the Plaintiff who stated in evidence that the 1st Defendant had"
"pleaded  in  the  Magistrate's  Court.  From  this  ipse  dixit  of  the  Plaintiff  about  what  had"
"happened in the Magistrate's Court, the learned District Judge of Homagama concludes that"
"the negligence  of  the  1st  Defendant  has  been  established.  The  admissibility  of  what the"
"Plaintiff said in evidence about the MC proceedings was in question. Apart from hearsay,"
"the Plaintiff's evidence cannot be acted upon to conclude negligence without more. If it is"
"the conviction upon  a voluntary plea by the 1st  Defendant that the learned District Judge"
"was relying upon as one item of evidence to conclude negligence, the conviction per se must"
"have  been  led  in  evidence.  Absent  that  item  of  evidence,  the  mere  ipssima  verba  of  the"
"Plaintiff that the 1st  Defendant pleaded guilty in the Magistrate's Court would amount to"
"hearsay."
"Since the learned District Judge of Homagama was laboring under a mistake as to the effect"
"of a guilty plea in subsequent civil proceedings, it  behoves me to look at the relevancy of"
"convictions  as  evidence in subsequent civil proceedings.  W hat is  the status of an earlier"
"criminal  conviction  at  the  subsequent  civil  trial  relating  to  the  same  facts?  The  answer"
"outlined at common  law was  that it had no  status  at all,  despite the fact  that the same"
"defendant may be involved in both sets of proceedings.  This was confirmed in the leading"
"English case of Hollington v.  Hewthorn and Co Ltd, (1943) KB 587."
