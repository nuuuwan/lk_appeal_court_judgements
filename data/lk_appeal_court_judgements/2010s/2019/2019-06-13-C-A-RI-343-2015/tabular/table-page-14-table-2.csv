"affirmed in  appeal,  shall be relevant for  the purposes  of proving that such person"
"committed such offence or committed the acts constituting such offence."
"So  the  law  on  relevancy  of  previous  convictions  in  subsequent  civil  proceedings  boils"
"down to this..-Section 41A(2) of the Evidence Ordinance which reflects the spirit of Section"
"11  of  the  Civil  Evidence  Act  of 1968  renders  a  conviction,  regardless  of whether it was"
"entered after a contested trial or upon a guilty plea,  relevant  to prove the fact in issue in"
"subsequent civil proceedings."
"The fact in issue in the subsequent civil trial should be whether the Defendant in the civil"
"case committed such offence or committed the acts constituting such offence. If it is a case"
"of negligence,  the criminal  conviction becomes  relevant  only if the acts  constituting the"
"offence are facts in issue in the civil trial."
"Subsequent cases have  considered Section 4lA(2 )..-see  Wimalachandra, J.  in  Mahipala  v."
