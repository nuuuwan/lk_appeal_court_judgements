"","So in this application for revision, I would not hold the 6 year delay against the Petitioner,"
"","provided  he  establishes  manifest  or  perverse  error  in  the  ex  parte  judgment  that  was"
"","delivered on 23rd January 2009."
"","The Petitioner recites several grounds for attacking the judgment on the merits."
"","1. 
lawful ownership of the 2nd Defendant to the offending car has not been established;"
"","2.  no  evidence  has  been  led  in  the  ex  parte  trial  to  establish  the  liability  of  the  2nd"
"","Defendant."
"","I have  examined the ex parte judgment dated 23.01.2009  vis--a--vis  the solitary evidence  of"
"","the  Plaintiff and  I find  that it is  destitute  of  the basic  ingredients  that go  to  make  out"
"","tortious liability. Vicarious liability has been imposed on the 2nd Defendant--Petitioner but"
"","the judgment is devoid of material as  to how this liability arises.  Even if liability is capable"
"","of  being  imposed  on  a  Defendant  in  an  accident  case, 
the  judgment  must  manifest"
"","admissible  evidence 
that  establishes 
the 
liability.  The  pith  and  substance  of 
the"
"","conclusions of the District Judge of Homagama in her terse and laconic judgment of January"
"","23,2009, which does not even traverse less than t 
0  pages is to the following effect:--"
"","a)  The action has been instituted to recover a sum of Rs. 500,OOO/-- as  damages jointly"
"","and severally from the 1st and 2nd Defendant s."
"","b)  The Plaintiff testified that she had not seen the vehicle rushing towards her but she"
"","later came to know that it was because of the private bus bearing No.4553  she met"
"","with the accident."
"","c)  The  1st  Defendant pleaded guilty  in  a  criminal  case  instituted in the  Magistrate's"
"","Court of Homagama and upon this plea he was imposed a fine of Rs.23,OOO/--."
"","d)  It is  apparent from  the conviction upon the plea  that  the 1st  Defendant has  acted"
"","negligently on a balance of probabilities."
"","that  she  had  suffered 
e)  The  Plaintiff  has  proved  on  a  balance  of  probabilities"
"","permanent injuries after the accident."
