"Liable to Forfeiture vs Shall be Forfeited"
"Section  12  of the  Ordinance  specifies  the  prohibitions  and  restrictions  imposed  on  specified"
"goods from  importation or exportation.  Section  44 therein  declares that "" if any person exports"
"... in  contravention  of  the  prohibitions  and 
or  attempts  to  export  or  take  our  of  Sri  Lanka"
"restrictions ... such goods shall be forfeited,  and shall be destroyed or di sposed of as the Director"
"General  may direct"".  (emphasis added)"
"In  Polasamy Nadar v.  Lanktree (51  NLR  520 at 522) Gratiaen J.  stated :"
"""Section 46  (which  is the  presen t Section  44)  provides that any goods  exported  or taken"
"out  of  the  Island  contrary  to  certain  specified  prohibitions  and 
restrictions  ""shall  be"
"forfeited and shall  be  dest royed  or disposed  of as  the Principal Collector of Customs may"
"direct.""  The  Customs  Ordinance  is  an  antiquated  enactment  ...  Some  of its provision s"
"that 
in 
certain 
circumstances  goods 
""shall 
be 
forfeited""  while 
in 
other 
declare"
"circumstances they are  merely "" liable to be  forfeited ""  ....  I am  prepared to concede that"
"the draftsmen  must be  given  credit for having intended the terms ""forfeited"" and  ""liable"
"to forfeiture"" to convey different meanings. 
If the goods are declared to be ""forfeited"""
"as  opposed to ""liable to forfeiture"" on  the happening of a given  event, their owner is"
"automatically and by operation of law divested of his  property in the goods as  soon as"
"the  event  occurs. 
No  adjudication  declaring  the  forfeiture  to  have  taken  place 
is"
"required to implement the automatic incident of forfeiture ..."
"A forfeiture of goods by operation of law wou ld,  of course, be of purely academic interest"
"until the  owner is in  fact deprived  of his  property by some  official  intervention.  Section"
"123  (present  Section  125)  of the  Ordinance  provides the  machinery for this  purpose  ..."
"When that is done, the goods ""shall be deemed and taken to be condemned"" and  may be"
"dealt with  in  the manner directed  by  law unless the  perso n from whom they have  been"
"se ized  or their owner ""shall,  within  one month from  the date  of seizure  ...  give  notice  in"
"writing to the  Collector  ...  that  he  intend s to  enter  a claim  to the  ...  goods  ...  And  shall"
"further  give  security  to  prosecute  such  claim  before  the  Court  having  jurisdiction  to"
"entertain same."" (Section  146) (this is the present Section 154) (emphasis added)"
