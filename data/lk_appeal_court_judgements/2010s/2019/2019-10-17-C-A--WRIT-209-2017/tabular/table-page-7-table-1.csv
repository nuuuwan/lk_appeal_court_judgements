"v.  Silvo.  Article  126 of the  Constitution  has  since  pravided  an  additional  remedy  in"
"appropriate cases."" (emphasis added)"
"This  is the remedy that a person  claiming title to goods  seized  as  forfeited  under the Ordinance"
"must resort to and  not the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal  since  in  such situations there"
"is no decision that can  be  quashed by a writ of certiorari for the goods are forfeited by operation"
"of law and  not by an  order of the inquiring officer."
"As  held by Gratiaen J.  in Palosamy Nadar v.  Lanktree (51  NLR  520 at 522):"
"""If the goods  are  declared  to  be  ""forfeited""  as  opposed  to  ""liab le  to forfeiture""  on  the"
"happening of a given event, their owner is automatically and by operation of law divested"
"of his property in  the goods  as  soon  as  the event occurs.  No  adjudication  declaring the"
"to  have 
taken  place 
is  required 
to  implement  the  automatic 
incident  of 
forfeiture"
"forfeiture ... """
"This  position  was  upheld  in  Bhombra  v.  The  Director General  of Customs  ond Others  [(2002)  3"
"Sri.L.R. 401] where Wijayaratne J.  (with Tilakawardane J.  agreeing) held (after considering Section"
"107A (1)  of the Customs Ordinance as  in this case):"
"""In  terms of such  provisions  an  order of forfeiture  is  imperative and  it is  not left to the"
"decision  of the inquiring officer.  Thus,  it is  not one  amenable to writ jurisdiction of this"
"court."""
"Ishok  v.  Loxman  Perera  Director  General  of 
The  same  principle  was  restated  by  this  Court  in"
"Customs and another [(2003)  3 Sri.L.R.  18]."
"There 
is  also  another  reason  as  to  why  the  writ  of  certiorari  quashing  the  Order  of the  2nd"
"Respondent dated 27.03.2017 marked  P15 should be  refused."
"The  general  principle 
is  that  an

"185; R.  (G)  Immigration Appeal Tribunal (2005)  1 W.L.R.  1445]. Our Courts have held that where"
"a party fails to invoke alternative remedies judicial  review can  be  refused . [Rodrigo  v.  Municipal"
