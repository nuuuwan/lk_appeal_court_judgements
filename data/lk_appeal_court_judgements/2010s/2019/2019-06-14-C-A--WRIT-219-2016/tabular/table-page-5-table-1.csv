"person  in  respect  of  whom  it  is  made  until  set  aside  by  a"
"court of competent jurisdiction."
"Leaving  alone  the  other  sections  of  the  Act,  when  the  second"
"proviso  to  section  90(1)  read  with  90(3),  it  appears  to  me  that,"
"the  Commissioner  General  is  expected  to  make  a  provisional"
"order  which  will  not  prejudice  the  substantive  rights  of  the"
"person or persons concerned."
"Further,  according  to  section  90(1),  the  test 
is  whether  the"
"interference to  the right will result in damage or loss of crop or"
"livestock."
"Same  section  provides  for  an  occupier  to  make  such  complaint"
"to  the  Commissioner  General,  and  according  to  section  101,"
"occupier means the person for the lime being entitled to the use"
"and occupation of agricultural land."
"That  shows  the  provisional  nature  of  the  order  expected  to  be"
"made by the Commissioner General."
"Hence 
I  am  unable 
to  accept 
the  argument  of 
the 
learned"
"Counsel  for  the  petitioner  that  a  servitude  right  of  access  over"
"temple 
land  was  not  strictly  proved  by 
the 
farmers  at 
the"
"inquiry."
"When  I  read  the  inquiry  notes,  it  is  seen  that  such  a  high-"
"handed position was never taken up by the Attorney-at-Law who"
"appeared 
for 
the  petitioner  priest  at 
the 
inquiry  before 
the"
"Commissioner General."
"Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs."
