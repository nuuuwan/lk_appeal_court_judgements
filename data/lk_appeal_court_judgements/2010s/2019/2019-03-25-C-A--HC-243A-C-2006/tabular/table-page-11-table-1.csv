"In his  short statement,  the  3rd  Appellant  denied  any  knowledge  of"
"the incident although he said ""yes"" to everything the Police asked. He was"
"arrested 
innocence 
since  he  had  no 
at  Warakapola.  He  protests  his"
"involvement with the incident."
"With this brief reference to  the evidence that had been placed before"
"the  trial  Court,  it  is  appropriate  at  this  stage  to  consider  the  common"
"ground  of  appeal  of  the  three  Appellants  that  the  trial  Court  erred  in"
"relation to the imposition of criminal liability under Section 32 of the Penal"
"Code."
"In  relation  to  the  matter  before  us,  being  a  case  based  on items  of"
"circumstantial evidence,  the collective contention of  the  Appellants could"
"be crystallised into following two issues;"
"a.  whether  there  was  sufficient  evidence  before  the  trial  Court  to"
"convict each of  the  Appellants for  the  offence  of  Robbery  under"
"Section 32 liability ?"
"b.  whether  there  was  sufficient  evidence  before  the  trial  Court  to"
"convict the Appellants for the offence of Murder under Section 32"
"liability ?"
"In  addition,  the  learned  President's  Counsel  for 
the  2nd  Appellant"
"further  contended  that there was a  serious flaw  in  the procedure adopted"
"by  the  trial  Court  in  conducting  the  trial  of  the  Appellant.  The  learned"
"President's  Counsel  invited  our  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  indictment"
"presented  by 
the  Hon.  Attorney  General, 
in  its  original  form,  had  no"
"reference 
to  Section  32  of  the  Penal  Code  and 
the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge on his  own motion has amended  the  indictment in the course of his"
"11"
