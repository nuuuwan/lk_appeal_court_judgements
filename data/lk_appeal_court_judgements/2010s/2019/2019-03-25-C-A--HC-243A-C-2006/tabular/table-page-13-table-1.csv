amendment."
"Only upon their reply in the negative that the  trial Court has pronounced"
"its judgment convicting them on the two counts."
"The procedure adopted  by the learned High Court Judge is  not the"
"most  desirable  course  of  action  in such  circumstances. 
It is  unfortunate"
"that  the  trial  Court  was  not  assisted  by  the  prosecutor 
in 
inviting  its"
"attention to the judgment of The Attorney General v Munasinghe and three"
"Others  69  N.L.R.  241  where five Justices  of the then Supreme Court have"
"considered this question and decided to answer it in the following form;"
"""Must 
there  be  a  reference 
to  section  32 
in 
the  charge?"
"Indeed  the  question  referred  to  this court is  in  this very form."
"Formulated  thus  the  question  must,  I think,  be  answered  in"
"the  negative.  Section  32  does  not create  an  offence;  it is  only"
"a section  laying down  a principle of liability. 1/"
"Thus it is  clear that the mere absence  of any reference  to Section 32"
"trial  Court  in  imposing  criminal 
of  the  Penal  Code  does  not  prevent  a"
"accused  who  are  named  in  the  indictment  of 
liability  upon  the  several"
"committing the offence of murder. However,  the important question arises"
"in view of  the rather late attempt of imposition of criminal liability  under"
"Section 32,  whether the said amendment  has resulted in the failure of the"
"trial Court to consider the evidence in the light of the said principle of law."
