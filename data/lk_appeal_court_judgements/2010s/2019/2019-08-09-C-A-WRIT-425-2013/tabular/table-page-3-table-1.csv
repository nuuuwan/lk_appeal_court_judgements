"A dispute appears to have arisen with regard to the title of the land to which the Mining Licence"
"has  been granted although the Petitioner claims that this was due to his refusal to sell the sand"
"mined from the said  land at a very low price to the supporters of a politician in the area  named"
"Dayasritha Tissera."
"The  predecessor of the 1st  Respondent by  letter dated 11.07.2011 (PlO) wrote to the Director,"
"Land  Settlement  Department informing that a dispute as  to the  title of land  named  Munhena"
"situated  in  No.  520 Madagoda village  has  arisen  as  a permit bearing no.  5848  has been  issued"
"to  one  Bandappuhamy  while  a deed  of transfer  bearing  no.  2919  (P3),  which  is  a document"
"relied on by the Petitioner to establish  his  co-ownership, is there in the name of one Kumuduni"
"Mallawaaratchchi. A request was made to settle this land in order to establish  its title. The said"
"letter also  refers to a request  made to the Surveyor Puttlam to confirm  whether the said  land"
"is state land. The  Mining Licence granted to the Petitioner was apparently not extended due to"
"this letter (PlO) been copied to the 5th Respondent with the request to stop further action until"
"the issue of title is  resolved  [paragraph 19 of the petition]."
"The  Director, Land  Settlement Department has  by letter dated 18.08.2011 (P11)  replied to P10"
"stating that there has been  no settlement made  in  relation to Madagoda village  and that their"
"records  do  not  indicate  any  steps  taken  to  settle  the  village  referred  to  as  Thimbirigaswela"
"referred 
to  in  deed  of  transfer  no.  2919  (P3).  Accordingly,  he  has 
requested 
that  further"
"inquiries in that regard be  made from the Land Commissioners Department which issued permit"
"bearing no. 5848."
"On  15.09.2011 
(P15) 
the  clearance  certificate  granted 
to  the  Petitioner  earlier  (P6)  was"
"extended by a further three (3)  months."
"The  Surveyor Puttalam has  in  his report dated 30.11.2011 (P12)  informed that it is not possible"
"to indicate  whether the  land  in  dispute  is  state  land  or  not as  it  is  situated  in  an  unsurveyed"
"area.  The  Land  Commissioner  by  letter dated  07.09.2011  (P13)  informed  the  1st  Respondent"
"that the permit may be  rejected based on the report of the Surveyor Puttalam (P12) presumably"
"on the basis that the said  permit is  not for the land  in  dispute."
