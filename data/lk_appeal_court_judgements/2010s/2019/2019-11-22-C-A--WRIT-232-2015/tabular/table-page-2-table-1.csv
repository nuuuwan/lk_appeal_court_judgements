"The  petitioner  company 
(Sri  Lanka  Telecom  PLC) 
filed 
this"
"application  seeking  to  quash,  by  way  of  writ  of  certiorari,    the"
"documents  marked  P9  and  P11,  whereby  the  Commissioner  of"
"Labour  decided 
that 
the 
respondent  debt  collectors  of 
the"
"petitioner  company  are  employees  of  the  petitioner  (as  opposed"
"to 
independent  contractors) 
for 
the  purpose  of  payment  of"
"Employment Provident Fund contributions."
"Notwithstanding a number of tests, such as, the control test, the"
"integration test, the economic reality test, mutuality of obligation"
"test,  dominant  impression  test,    have  been  formulated  in  order"
"to  decide  whether  a  person  is  an  employee  or  an  independent"
"contractor,  there  is  no  conclusive  test  which  could  answer  that"
"question;  and 
therefore, 
that  question 
shall  ultimately  be"
"answered on  a case by case basis  taking into consideration  the"
"unique facts and circumstances of each individual case.1"
"In  this  process,  the  labels  given  or  terminology  used  are  not"
"binding. 
  They  are,  more  often 
than  not,  misleading. 
  For"
"instance,  a  clause  in  the  appointment  letter  expressly  stating"
"that  the  appointment  shall  never  be  considered  as  creating  an"
"employer-employee  relationship  with  the  establishment  which"
"issued 
the 
letter, 
and 
accepting 
the  appointment  by 
the"
"employee  subject  to  that  condition 
is  not  decisive. 
  To  give"
"another  example,  the  label  given  for  the  payment  for  the  work"
"executed, 
as 
“allowance”, 
“commission”, 
“incentive”,"
"1 This has been admitted by the petitioner in paragraph 15 at page 13 of the"
"written submissions tendered to this Court. Vide also pages 10-13 of the"
"same written submissions for various tests."
