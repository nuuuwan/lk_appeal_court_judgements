"shows  that  the  Government  had  no 
intention  of considering  the  Appellant  as  a"
"Government teacher."
"The  Appellant  was  recruited  as  a  teacher  by  the  1 Sl  Respondent  and  was"
"under the  authority of a manager.  It  is  submitted that the services of the  Appellant"
"was 
not 
transferable 
unlike  government 
teachers.  Therefore, 
except 
for 
the"
"payment  of salary,  and  certain  other  supervisory  powers,  the  government  had  no"
"authority over the  Appellant. The Counsel  for the  Appellant has  drawn attention to"
"Sections  5  and  Section  7(b)  of the  Act  and  to  several  decided  cases  in  support of"
"his  contention.  Further  the  Appellant  has  annexed  documents  marked  Al  to  A4,"
"B 1 to  B2, C and D  in  support,  annexed to  the written  submissions  filed  of record."
"learned  High  Court 
It  is  observed  that  the  said  documents  were  not  before  the"
"Judge at the time the impugned order was made."
"The application  made  before this  Court has sought to  revise the  order given"
"by 
the  learned  High  Court  Judge  and  to  give  effect  to  the  order  of the 
learned"
"Magistrate,  taking  into  consideration  the  documents  tendered  to  this  Court.  The"
"said documents  were  not privy  to  the  learned  High  Court Judge  when  making  the."
"impugned order. Therefore, if this  Court proceeds to  make  an  order on the strength"
"of the  documents  filed  at  this  stage,  there  is  a  strong  likelihood  that  this  Court"
"would  be  infringing  upon  the  procedural  rights  of an  aggrieved  party  to  challenge"
"such order."
