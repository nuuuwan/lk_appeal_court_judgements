"and  Y2,  respectively.  The  Appellant' s  contention 
is 
that  by  not  considering  the"
"documents 
filed 
by 
the 
1 5t  Respondent, 
the

through  the  Consolidated  Fund  of the  Government  and"
"should  be  considered  as  a  Government  teacher  and  would  not  be  entitled  to  such"
"payment."
