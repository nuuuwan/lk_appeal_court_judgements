"This  is  an  appeal  against  the  judgment of the  learned  Additional  District Judge  of Moneragala"
"dated  29.11.2000."
"The  Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) instituted the above styled action and  sought a declaration of"
"title to the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint, a declaration that the Appellant"
"is entitled to possess the said  land and bui lding, order of eviction ofthe Defendants-Respondents"
"(Respondents) and  their agents and  servants from the said  land and damages."
"The  Appellant claimed that he had  been in  undisturbed and  uninterrupted possession of the said"
"land  against  the  State  and  all  others  for  a period  of over  35  years  and  as  such  had  obtained"
"prescriptive title. It was further stated that steps had been taken under the State Lands (Recovery"
"of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended (Act) in M.e. Moneragala Case  No. 54018/95 against"
"the Appellant for the said  land and  an  order of eviction made on  09.01.1996."
"The  Respondents claimed that the land in dispute is state land and denied that the Appellant had"
"obtained prescriptive title to the said  land."
"The  learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action and  hence this appeal."
"Parties have taken up disparate positions on the nature of the action in that the Appellant claims"
"it is  an  action instituted in  terms of section  12  of the Act  [Additional Written Submissions dated"
"30.05.2019  paragraph  5]  whereas  the  Respondents  contend  that  it  is  neither  a rei  vindicatio"
"action nor an  action in terms of section 12 of the Act.  The  learned Additional District Judge held"
"that it is  not an  action filed  in  terms of section 12 of the Act as the Appellant was  not evicted."
"Rei Vindicatio Action"
"Reclame  or Rei  vindicatio  is  the  action  which  arises  under the  head  of property.  It lies  for the"
"owner of anything  movable  or immovable,  corporeal  or incorporeal,  against the  possessor  or,"
"any person who has  mala fide  divested  him of the possession  to deliver it up to the owner with"
"all  its  fruits then  in  existence  and  those  which  the  mala fide  possessor  has  already enjoyed,  or"
