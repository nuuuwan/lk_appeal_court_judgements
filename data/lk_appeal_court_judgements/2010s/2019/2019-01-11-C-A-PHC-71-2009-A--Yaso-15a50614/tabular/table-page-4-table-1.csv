"In  effect,  the  no  evidence  rule  has  opened  up  a very  narrow  path  for  courts  to  review  non-"

ignorance  of  established  and  relevant  evidence  has  been  held  to  be  amenable  to  judicial"

"In  Hasseen  v Gunasekara  and others  [CA  Application  No.  128/86 C.A.M.  02.10.1995]  this  court"
"considered an  order of the Rent Board of Review, affirming an order of the Rent Board which had"
"been  ""arrived  at  without  an  adequate  evaluation  of the  evidence  and  by failing  to take  into"

"the ability to exercise judicial review.  However,  in the instant case,  I am  of the view that the 3rd"
"Respondent  has  considered  all  the  evidence  led  before  him  before  arriving  at  the  impugned"
"conclusions.  In  particular,  he  has  considered  the  substantial  amount of documentary evidence"
"led  which  shows  the  culpability  of the  Appellant  for the  loss  suffered  by  the  2nd  Respondent."
"Accordingly, this ground must fail."

"Sections in this form  may.  no doubt,  exclude judicial review on  what is or has become a matter of pure judgment."
"But I do  not think that they go further than that.  /f a judgment requires,  before it can be made, the existence of"
"some facts, then, a/though the evaluation of those facts is for the Secretary of State alone, the court must enquire"
"whether those facts  exist,  and have been  taken into  account,  whether the judgment has been made upon  a"
"proper self direction as to those facts,  whether the judgment has not been made upon other facts which ought"
"not to have been taken into account. /f these requirements are not met, then the exercise of judgment, however"
"bona fide it may be, becomes capable of challenge"
