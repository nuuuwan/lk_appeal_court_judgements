"""In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea,"
"or after trial,  the  Trial Judge  has  a  difficult function  to perform.  That  is  to"
"decide  what  sentence 
is 
to  be 
imposed  on 
the  accused  who  has  been"
"convicted.  In doing so he has to  consider the point of view of the accused on"
"the  one hand and the  interest of society on the  other.  In  doing so the Judge"
"must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed,  the manner in"
"which 
it  has  been  committed 
the  machinations  and 
the  manipulations"
"the  effect  of committing 
resorted to  by  the  accused to  commit  the  offence,"
"such a crime insofar as  the  institution or organisation in  respect of which it"
"has  been  committed, 
the  persons  who  are  affected  by  such  crime, 
the"
"ingenuity with which  it has been committed and the involvement of others in"
"committing 
the  crime.  The  Trial  Judge  who  has 
the  sole  discretion 
in"
"imposing a  sentence which  is  appropriate  having regard to  the  criteria set"
