"In 
the  above  circumstances, 
this  Court  agrees  with 
the  submission  of  the"
"learned  State  Counsel  that  the  purported  complaints  of  the  Petitioner  are"
"entirely  contractual  and  that the  Petitioner therefore  cannot  invoke  the  Writ"
"jurisdiction  of  th is  Co urt.  Hence,  it  wou ld  not  be  possible  for  this  Court  to"
"entertain  the  application  of the  Petitioner,  irres pective  of the strength  of the"
"factual  arguments.  This  Court  accordingly 
refuses  to 
issue  notice  on 
the"
"Respondents and dismisses this application, without costs."
