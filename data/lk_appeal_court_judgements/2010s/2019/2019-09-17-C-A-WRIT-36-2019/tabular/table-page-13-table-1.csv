"Court held as follows:"
"""As  has  been  contended  by  the  learned  State  Counsel,  on 
the  line  of"
"authorities  cited  by  him, 
the  pertinent  question 
is, 
in  dismissing 
the"
"petitioner,  was 
the  Authority  exercising  statutory  powers  or  authority"
"derived  from 
contract  of  employment?  It  is  quite  apparent 
that 
the"
"procedure under which the Director General can be removed,  has not been"
"specified anywhere  in  the  Act.  Even  the  period of time  during  which  the"
"Director General shall hold office  is  determined not by the statute but by"
"the letter of oppointment.  Unlike  in  the case of the Chairman  and certoin"
"other members of the Board no  protection  has  been  afforded to  the  post"
"under  consideration  against  arbitral  dismissal.  Since  there  is  no  special"
"statutory provision  either direct  or by a  necessary implication  suggesting"
"the  manner in  which  the  Director General should be  removed from  office"
