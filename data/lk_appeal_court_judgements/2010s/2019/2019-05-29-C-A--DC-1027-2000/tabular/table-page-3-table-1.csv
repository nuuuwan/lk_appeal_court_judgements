"Preliminary  Plan  subject  to  proof  notwithstanding  the  Court"
"Commissioner in his Report has stated that what he depicted in"
"the  Preliminary  Plan  is  the  land  to  be  partitioned.2   From  this"

"accepted  that  what  is  depicted  in  the  Preliminary  Plan  is  the"
"land to be partitioned.4  Hence it is too late in the day for the 3rd"
"defendant to raise a corpus dispute for the first time in appeal."
"The  second  and  third  arguments  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the"
"3rd defendant are, in my view, valid."
"When I read the Judgment with the evidence led at the trial, it is"
"clear  to  me  that  the  learned  Judge  has  palpably  misdirected"

"The 
learned  Judge  has  repeated  evidence 
in 
the  Judgment"
"without proper analysis and thereafter reproduced the schedule"
"of shares tendered by the Attorney-at-Law for the plaintiff at the"
"end  of  the  trial5 without  explaining  how  the  share  calculation"
"was done."
