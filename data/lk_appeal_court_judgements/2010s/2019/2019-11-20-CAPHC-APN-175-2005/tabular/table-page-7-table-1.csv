"p
erson 
including  the  owner  of  the  property 
is  not  sufficient"
"compliance with section 28A(1) of the UDA Law."
"During  the  course  of  argument,  the 
learned  counsel  for  the"
"intervenient  respondent  drew  the  attention  of  the  Court  to  the"
"decision  of  this  Court  in  Ivo  Fernando  v.  Somasiri6  where  this"
"Court  has  held  that  failure  to  act  in  terms  of  section  28A(3)  of"
"the  UDA  Law  by  the  Magistrate  is  a  fatal  irregularity.    In  that"
"case,  Notice  under  section  28A(1)  had  been  served  on 
the"
"appellant  who  was 
the  person  who  has 
constructed 
the"
"unauthorized  building,  but 
the 
learned  Magistrate  has  not"
"followed the proper procedure as laid down in section 28A(3).  In"
"my  view, 
the 
facts  of 
the 
instant  case  are  worse, 
in 
that,"
"admittedly,  no  statutory  Notice  contemplated  in  section  28A(1)"
"was  ever  served  on  the  intervenient  petitioner  who  constructed"
"the unauthorized building."
"In  the  middle  of  the  argument,  the 
learned  counsel 
for  the"
"respondent stated that this argument was never taken up either"
"before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  or  the  High  Court,  and  therefore"
"this argument shall be rejected by this Court."
"By  reading  the  Magistrate’s  Court  order,  it  is  clear  that  this"
"point  has  been  raised  before  the  learned  Magistrate,  but  the"
"learned  Magistrate  has  taken  the  view  that  Notice  has  been"
"served on the respondent."
