"secure the payment of money, but to vest the right of possession ofa land for a certain period in the"
"lessee. A lease also usually contains many subsidiary covenants, and Simply because one of these"
"covenants  relates  to the payment of rent,  the instrument is not thereby constituted a bond. If the"
"rent is paid wholly in advance there will be no such covenant in the lease at all, and in such a case"
"there will be no shadow of reasons for calling it a bOlld.  A lease belongs  to the specific class of"
"contracts which the civil law calls locatio conductio, and in no way partakes of the nature of"
"a bOlld."""
