"However,  there  is  no  authentication  on  the  face  of the  document  as  contended  by"
"the Appellant."
"When  an  application  is  filed  under  Section  28A (3)  of the  Act,  the  burden"
"of  showing 
a 
valid 
permit 
to 
commence, 
continue

complete 
a"

"This position was clearly illustrated  by Gamini Amaratunga J. in  the case of"
"Urban  Development Authority  vs.  H. W.  Kulasiri  (CA  2226/2003),  where  it  was"
"held that,"
"""in  a  situation  where  an  application  made  under  Section  28(A)  (3)  of the  UDA"
"Law had been  made the relevant  question  is  whether the  structure in  question has"
"the  only  valid 
been  erected  upon  a  valid  permit.  Th e  existence  of a  permit  is"
"answer to  the application under Section 28(A)  (3).  The  burden of showing that the"

"The  Appellant  has

"bearing No.37/8,  2nd  Lane, Rajamahavihare Road, Pita-Kotte, within the municipa l"
"council  limits  of Sri  Jayawardanapura  Kotte,  in  contravention  of Section  3  of the"
"said  Act  as  depicted  in  plan  marked  P3.  The  proceedin gs  contained  in 
the  brief"
"makes  it  manifestly  clear  that  the  Appellant  had  not  obtained  a  valid  permit.  It is"
"an  essential  requirement that  a  person  obtains  a  valid  permit  under  the  provis ions"
"of  the  UDA  Act  before 
terms  of 
the  commencement  of  any  construction.  In"
"Section 23(5) of the Act, the Respondent is statutoril y empowered to  file  an action"
"against  a  person  responsibl e  for  an 
illegal  construction,  as  defined 
in 
the  Act."
