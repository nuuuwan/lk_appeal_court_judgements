"the  Commissioner  General  of  Labour  in  the  previous  three  Writ  applications"
"where  he 
justified  the  decision  to  terminate  the  services  of the  employees"
"under the TEW Act."
"The  third  and  most crucial  issue  that arises  from the said  explanation  is  that it"
"is  none  other  than  a  Commissioner  of  Labour  himself  that  considered 
the"
"question  of  whether  approval 
for 
the 
termination  of  the  services  of  the"
"Employee  Respondents  should  be  granted  and  that the  issues  relating  to the"
"entitlement 
to  a  pension  was 
infact  considered  extensively  by 
the  said"
"Commissioner.  It  is  perhaps  worth  reiterating  that  the  approval  to terminate"
"the  services  of the  Employee  Respondents  was  granted  on  the  condition  that"
"compensation  at  the  rate  of  4-6  months'  salary  for  each  year  of completed"
"service  must  be  paid  and 
that  in  doing  so,  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  has"
"infact taken  into cons ideration the very matters that have now been  offered as"
"the reasons that led to the issuance of 'X18(a)-(c):"
"This  Court also observes that the 1st  and  2nd  Respondents while admitting 'X14'"
"have  stated  that they  ""were  satisfied  that there  were  reasonable  grounds  to"
"refer  the  subject  dispute  to  an  arbitrator on  the  subsequent  appeal  made  by"
"the  relevant  Respondents."" The  Respondents  have  however not produced  this"
"subsequent  appeal  to  this  Court  and  the  explanation  offered  in  paragraph  11"
"of 
the  Statement  of  Objections  does  not  contain  any 
reference 
to  any"
"limited  to  'X9'.  The  Employee  Respondents  have 
subsequent  appeal  but  is"
"submitted  with  their Statement  of Objections,  three  letters  marked  'SR7(A)' -"
"to  have  been  sent  by  them  to  the  Minister  of  Labour  and  the 
'SR7(C)'  said"
"Secretary,  Ministry  of  Labour,  after  the
