"Clause 17(a) of 'X7' reads as follows:"
"""An  employee  shall,  upon  reaching  the  retirement  age  of the  Bank  and"
"who is  in the permanent employment of the Bank at such  time, and  shall"
"have  completed  not 
less 
than  10  years  of  actual  continuous  service"
"(excluding absence/leave without pay),  be entitled to a monthly pension"
"It is  not in  dispute that the Employee  Respondents were 48,  42,  46, 42, 46,  41,"
"39  and  41  years  of age  respectively,  at the  time the  Commissioner General  of"
"Labour  granted  approval  to  terminate  their  services  under  the  provisions  of"
"the TEW  Act. Thus,  it is  clear that the Employee Respondents did  not serve the"
"Petitioner until they  reached  the age  of 55  years  and  that they  have  failed  to"

"2nd  Respondents have failed to consider is  that an employee must be  in  service"
"at  the  time  he

the"
"Minister  has  failed  to  consider  (a)  that  the  issue  of  the  pension  was  in  fact"
"raised  by  the  Employee  Respondents  before  the  Inquiry  Officer;  (b)  that  the"
"Commissioner  of  Labour  did  in  fact  take  into  consideration  the  pension  that"
