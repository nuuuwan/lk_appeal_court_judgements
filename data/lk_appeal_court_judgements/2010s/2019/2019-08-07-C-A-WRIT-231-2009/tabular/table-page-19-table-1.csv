"The  second  ground  that was  raised  by the  learned  President's Counsel  for the"
"Petitioner, is that the M inister's decision to refer the said  dispute, in the above"
"circumstances, is  irrational and arbitrary."
"In  order to  consider the  said  ground,  it  would  be  important for this  Court  to"
"examine  the  relevant  provisions  of the  law  which  empower  the  Minister  to"
"ma ke a reference to arbit ration under Section 4(1)."
"Sect ion 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act reads as follows:"
"""The  Minister  may, if  he  is  of the opinion  that  an 
industrial  dispute  is  a"

by 
an 
order 
in  writing, 
for  settlement  by"
"arbitration  to  an  arbitrator  appointed  by 
the  Minister  or  to  a 
labour"
"that 
the  parties 
t o  such 
dispute  or 
their 
tribunal,  notwithstanding"
"representatives do not consent to such  reference."""
"It is  the view of this Court that in terms of Section 4(1}, the Minister must form"
"the  opinion 
that 
t here  exists  an 
industrial  dispute,  prior 
to  making  any"
"reference  of such  disput e for resolution  by  arbitration . This  Court  is  further of"

the"
"Petitioner, that the  "" Minister had  applied  a judicial  mind  or even  an  objective"

in  detail  the  manner  in  which  the
