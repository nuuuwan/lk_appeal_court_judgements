"while  he  had been under treatment  at the  Cancer  Hospital,  Maharagama.  The  Petitioner"
"to  know  about  the  dismissal  of  the  action  owing  to 
the 
stated  that  he  only  came"
"nonpayment of brief fees  when he had perused the docket during the first week of April"
"2012."
"The Court of Appeal though  by its judgment dated 02.07.2014  refused the application for"
"relisting."
"The Petitioner being aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal preferred a Special"
"Leave  to Appeal application bearing No.l49/14  to the Supreme Court and the application"
"had  been  listed  for  support  on  10.11.2014. 
It  was  whilst  the  special  leave 
to  appeal"
"application was pending in the Supreme Court that the Petitioner instituted this restitutio"
"in integrum  or revision application. The special leave to appeal application to the Supreme"
"the  Supreme  Court  was  not  satisfied  with  the  reasons  given  by  the 
Court  failed  as"
"Petitioner before this Court as to why he could not collect the brief in the Court of Appeal."
"It  would  then  appear  that  the  matter  before  the  Supreme  Court  was  only  a  matter  of"
"relisting and not a matter where merits of the case were canvassed."
"Thus it is clear that the appeals filed by the 10th  Defendant (the Petitioner's father)  were"
"both dismissed in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court on technical grounds namely he"
"could not furnish reasonable cause as to why he could not pay the brief fees."
"In  this  application  before  this  Court  the  learned  President's  Counsel for  the  Petitioner"
"submitted that the learned District Judge  of Horana  had overlooked the deed marked as"
"IOV2 in deciding the shares to be allotted to each party and thereby failed to recognize the"
"clear paper title of the 10th  Defendant to 3/4th  acre,  which was not even disputed by any"
"party to this action."
"Thus  this  Court finds  that the judgment  of the learned District Judge is  contrary to the"
"evidence led and the documents placed before Court. In the said judgment, having stated"
"that the  court  accepts  the  evidence  of the 1st  Plaintiff and that the  entitlement of  each"
"party should be according to the pedigree submitted by the 3rd
,  4th and 5th Defendants, the"
"learned  District Judge  fails 
to  grant 
the  proper  extent  of  the  corpus  due  to  the  10th"
