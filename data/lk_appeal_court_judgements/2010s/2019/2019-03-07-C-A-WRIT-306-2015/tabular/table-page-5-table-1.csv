"T
he  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents  has  taken  up  several"
"preliminary  objections  to  the  maintainability  of  this  application"
"including 
that 
invocation  of  writ 
jurisdiction  of 
this  Court"
"challenging the said decision is completely misconceived in law."
"There is a great substance in that argument."
"However, 
I 
think, 
I 
can  dispose  of 
this  matter  on  more"
"fundamental principles of law."
"It is common ground that writ jurisdiction of this Court cannot"
"be invoked as of right.  It is a discretionary relief.  In that regard,"
"the  conduct  of  the  party  applying  for  writ  is  intensely  relevant."
"The  petitioner  may  be  completely  innocent,  but  he  cannot keep"
"it  to  himself  and  decide  his  own  case.    There  is  a  complainant"
"(the referee) and a complaint.  He knew it at least after the first"
"date  of  the  inquiry  to  which  the  representatives  of  his  school"
"participated.  But he did not want to intervene and vindicate his"
"name.    He  will  have  to  blame  himself 
for  it.    After  he  was"
"informed of the punishment—a ban for two matches—he says he"
"complied.    At  least  at  that  time  no  attempt  has  been  made"
"seeking an opportunity to place facts before the Association."
"In  any  event,  if  the  petitioner  was  not  satisfied  with  the  said"
"finding and punishment, there is a procedure to appeal against"
"such  decisions.    This  is  stated  in  page  11  of  the  Hand  Book"
"2014  of 
the  Sri  Lanka  Schools  Rugby  Football  Association"
"marked R2.  That has not been followed by the petitioner.  The"
"petitioner 
cannot

straightaway 
before 
this 
Court"
"challenging the decision of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football"
"Association  by  way  of  a  writ,  which  is  a  public  law  remedy"
"involving public duty.  When there is an alternative remedy writ"
"will  not  generally  lie.    The  argument  of  the  learned  President’s"
