"Unlike 
in  a  situation  where

is  patent  or 
total  want  of"
"jurisdiction, when the Court has plenary jurisdiction to deal with a"
"matter  and  the  question  is  invoking  such  jurisdiction  in  the  right"
"manner, a party cannot keep silent and take up such an objection"
"as  to  procedure,  if  the  final  order  is  made  against  him.    That  is"
"against  the  law  and  against  common  sense.    Any  objection  as  to"
"latent or contingent want of jurisdiction shall be taken at the first"
"available  opportunity—vide  section  39  of  the  Judicature  Act,  No."

"defendant, the plaintiff submitted that the dismissal  of his former"
"action  was  invalid  as  the  judge  in  the  former  case  followed  the"
"wrong  procedure  in  that  instead  of  summary  procedure,  regular"
"procedure  was  followed.    At  that  time,  the  plaintiff  had  not  taken"
"objection
