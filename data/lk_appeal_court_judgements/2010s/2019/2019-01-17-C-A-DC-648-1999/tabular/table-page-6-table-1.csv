"2,680  was  the  denial  by  the  defendant  of  the  plaintiff's"
"claim  to  be  the  owner  of  these  premises,  the  question  at"
"issue then being whether the plaintiff or the defendant was"
"the true owner of the entirety of this land. As a result of the"
"respondent's intervention in this action, identically the same"
"question  arises 
for  decision  and 
the  plaintiff  when  he"
"instituted this action must have realized that unless he was"
"completely  successful 
in  his  subterfuge 
that  was 
the"
"question  which  would  arise  for  determination  immediately"
"notice  of 
the  pendency  of 
this  proceeding 
reached 
the"
"intervenient. Inasmuch as he is now a defendant that is the"
"one question which arises for determination. It is quite true"
"that 
in 
theory  an  action 
for  partition 
is  a  proceeding"
"between co-owners, the purpose of which is to resolve their"
"respective  interests  in  common  into  holdings  in  severalty."
"But  in  a  large  percentage,  perhaps  too  large  a  percentage,"
"of  cases  what  the  Court  has  to  determine  is  the  respective"
"rights  of  parties  who  are 
frequently 
if  not  generally 
in"
"conflict  as 
to  such 
rights. 
In  such  cases  a  proceeding"
"instituted  under  the  Partition  Ordinance  is  in  substance,"
"and 
I  think 
in  fact,  an  action  for  a  declaration  of  title."
"Though in form actions for partition they are often in reality"
"actions  for  a  declaration  of  title  to  land.  In  Ponamma  v."
"Arumugam 
[8  NLR  223], 
the  Privy  Council  held 
that  a"
"certain  action  for  partition  brought  under  the  provisions  of"
"the  Partition  Ordinance 
though 
in 
form  an  action 
for"
"partition was in reality an action for the recovery of the land"
"and as such was obnoxious to the provisions of section 547"
"of the Civil Procedure Code which prevented such an action"
