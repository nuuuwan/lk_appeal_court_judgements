"of this Court in CA Writ Application No.l046/2008, and eventually the 1st Respondent'"
"Commissioner General of Labour by P5 dated 04.03.2013 communicated the quantum of"
"compensation, calculated as per the salaries of the Petitioners at the time of termination"
"of their services in 1994."
"This is the decision that is challenged before this Court as  amenable to be quashed by a"
"writ of certiorari."
"The learned Counsel for  the Petitioners Sarita de Fonseka contended strongly that this"
"computation is ultra vires inasmuch as the 1st Respondent has not taken into account the"
"unbroken  contract  of  services  of  these  Petitioners  as  it  is  the  corollary  that  follows"
"consequent to the declaration by both the Arbitrator and the Court of Appeal that the"
"termination of services  of these Petitioners was illegal and invalid.  If their services  are"
"not terminated at all in 1994, they continued in service and therefore the computation of"
"compensation cannot be pegged to what their salaries were  at the time of termination"
"namely  in  1994.  The  process  of  anchoring  the  compensation  to  the  year  1994  was"
"irrelevant  and  was  actuated  by extraneous  considerations  and  therefore  the  decision"
"smacks of illegality' so argued Sarita de Fonseka the learned Counsel for  the Petitioners."
"She pointed out that Section 14 of the Industrial Disputes (Hearing and Determination of"
"Proceedings)  Special  Provisions  Act  No.13  of  2003  mandates  an  arbitrator to make  an"
"award in respect of a reference within 3 months of such reference.  But the award came"
"about almost 14 years later in 2008 and even after the termination was confirmed by this"
"Court in 2011, the Petitioners are yet to receive their solatium as the matter is lis pendente"
