"It  is  these  indicia  that  should  govern 
the  computation  of  compensation  for  the  two"
"groups of employees among the Petitioners."
"In  the  circumstances,  the  failure  to  take  into  account  the  aforesaid  consideration as  a"
"relevant consideration taints the decision of the 1st  Respondent with illegality-see  Tesco"
"Stores Ltd, v.  Secretary of State for the Environment (l995) 1 W.LR 759."
"I therefore  quash the decision  in P5  dated 04 th  August  2013  inasmuch as  P5  has  taken"
"into consideration  an  irrelevant  consideration namely  the 1994  salaries  as  the  base for"
"computation."
"I  also 
issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  directing  the  Commissioner  General  of  Labour  to"
"compute the number of years  in the formula up to the retirement dates or the year 2011"
"depending  on  the peculiar circumstances  of the  Petitioners.  The  base  salaries  for  this"
"purpose would be the salaries at the times of retirement for  the Petitioners who retired"
"before 2011 and in the case of the others it would be the salaries they would have received"
"in 2011."
"These are  two remedies I deem it appropriate to grant and subject to these reliefs being"
"granted, the application for judicial review is allowed to that extent."
