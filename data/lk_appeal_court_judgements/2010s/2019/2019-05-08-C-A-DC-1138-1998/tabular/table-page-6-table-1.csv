its  Attorney  Denham  Oswald  Dawson  v.  Kala"
"Traders  (Pvt)  Ltd  [2016]  BLR  44  (SC)  in  respect  of  section  86(2)"

"There  is  another  aspect  in  section  86(2),  which  relates  to  the"
"procedure.    Section 86(2)  does  not  specifically  dictate  the  mode"
"of  making  the  application.    It  merely  says  “the  defendant  with"
"notice  to  the  plaintiff  makes  application”.    It  does  not  say  that"
"the application shall be made by way of a petition supported by"
"an affidavit with documents if any.  In practice the application is"
"made by way of petition supported by an affidavit.   However, the"
"application  can  be  made  only  by  way  of  an  affidavit  as  the"
"inquiry  can  be  concluded  even  without  oral  testimony.

"Similarly,  no  specific  procedure

"Dharmawardena [1994] 3 Sri LR 49 it was held that “An inquiry"
"on an application to set aside an ex parte decree is not regulated"
"by  any  specific  provision  of 
the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  Such"
"inquiries  must  be  conducted  consistently  with  the  principles  of"
"(vide  also 
natural 
justice  and 
the 
requirement  of 
fairness.”"

"facts of this case in the light of the above-mentioned principles."
