"The  speech  of Lord  Morris  in Mcgreevy  v  DPP  [1973]  1  WLR  276,"
"""It requires no more than  ordinary common sense for a"
"jury to  understand if one  suggested inference from  an"
"accepted piece of evidence leads  to  a conclusion of guilt"
"and  another  suggested  inference 
to  a  conclusion  of"
"innocence  a jury  could  not  on 
that  piece  of evidence"
"alone  be  satisfied  of guilt  beyond  all  reasonable  doubt"
"unless 
they  wholly  rejected  and  excluded 
the 
latter"
"suggestion "","
