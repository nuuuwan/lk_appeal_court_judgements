"2 Sri L.R.  263, the apex Court adopted the below quoted pronouncement of"
"the English judgment of R v Exall ;"
""" It has  been  said  that  circumstantial evidence  is  to  be"
"considered  as  a chain,  and  each  piece  as  a link  in  the"
"chain,  but  that  is  not  so,  for  then  anyone link  breaks,"
"the  chain  would  fall. 
It is  more  like 
the  case  of rope"
"comprised  of several  chords.  One  strand of rope  might"
"be  insufficient to  sustain  the  weight,  but three  strands"
"together  may  be  quite  of sufficient  strength.  Thus, 
it"
"in  circumstantial  evidence 
there  may  be  a 
may  be"
"combination  of circumstances,  no  one  of which  would"
"raise  a  reasonable  conviction  or  more 
than  a  mere"
"suspicion, 
bu t 
three 
taken 
together  may 
create  a"
"conclusion  of guilt  with  as  much  certainty  as  human"
"affairs can  require or admit."""
