"amendment was  to take effect at the beginning of the year of assessment 2011/2012  although"
"certified on 31st  March 2011."
"A similar issue  arose sometime ago when the amendment to the IR Act in 2009 was the subject"
"matter in  Seylan  Bank  PLC.  v.  The  Commissioner General of Inland Revenue  [CA(Tax)  23/2013,"
"C.A.M.  23.05.2015].  In that case this Court held that irrespective of whether the assessee had to"
"submit the tax return on  or before the 30th  September or 30th  November 2009, the assessor can"
"send  the  assessment  to  the  assessee  within  two  years  immediately  succeeding  that  year  of"
"assessment.  The Court further considered the amendments made to section 163 of the IR Act by"
"Act  Nos.  22  of 2011,  18  of 2013  and  8  of 2014.  It  held  that the  two-year  period  given  to the"
"assessor to send  the  assessment  against the assessee  was  to start from the end  of the year of"
"assessment originally,  which  is  the 31st of March, every year.  This  date (the starting day of the"
"period)  has  been  further  pushed  down  to the  thirtieth  day  of  November  of the  immediately"
"succeeding year of assessment by Act No. 22 of 2011. The Court also held that section  163(5) of"
"the IR Act is a procedural law and that even if the amendment has retrospective effect, it applies,"
"if the amendment is only on  procedural law."
