"Section  3(1)  of the NBT Act deals with two separate and  distinct incidents of the taxing  regime."
"The first part is the charging section  by which  NBT is  charged  on  every person to whom the Act"
"applies,  namely the  persons  referred to in  section  2 of the NBT Act.  The  second  part deals with"
"the calculation of the NBT. Accordingly,  NBT is calculated at the appropriate rate specified in the"
"Second  Schedule  thereto  in  the case  of importers of any  article  on  the  liable turnover of such"
"person  arising  from  the  importation  into Sri  Lanka  of such  article  and  in  the  case  of a person"
"referred to in  paragraph  (b)  (c)  or (d)  of subsection  (1)  of section  2,  the NBT is  calculated on  the"
"liable turnover of such  person for such  relevant quarter."
"The  Respondent  has  based 
its  argument  on  the  reference  to  quarter  in  the  Regulation  and"
"submits  that  as  an 
importer  it  does  not  pay  NBT  quarterly  but  only  in  respect  of the  liable"
