"Confusio"
"This argument owes its origin to the taxonomy of confusio and the Counsel for the"
"Plaintifr Appellant have both cited the following passage."
"""Confusio, as a mode of extinguishing  a right, occurs when two incompatible rights are"
"united in one and the same person."
","
"Discharge  of  a contractual  obligation  by  confusion,  or  merger  is  not  based  on"
"performance or on waiver, but on the principle that a person cannot in the same capacity"
"be his own creditor and debtor."
"Thus, under a contract of tenancy,  the obligations of the tenant would be extinguished"
"by operation of law if the title to the leased premises vests in the tenant, after the contract"
"is entered into. Once the acquisition of title by the tenant is shown to have taken place,"
"the capacities of landldrd and tenant become united in one person,  so that there is no"
"longer any scope for recognition of a contract of tenancy""  G.L.  Peiris  ''Landlord"
"and Tenant"" Vo12. page 548 Chapter 28."
