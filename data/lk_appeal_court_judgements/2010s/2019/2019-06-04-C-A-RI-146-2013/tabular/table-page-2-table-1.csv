"The  petitioner 
filed  this  application 
for  restitutio 
in 
integrum"
"seeking  to  set  aside  the  Judgment,  Interlocutory  Decree  and"
"Final  Decree  entered  by 
the  District  Judge  of  Kalutara 
in"
"Partition Case No. 7908/P."
"The plaintiff-respondent filed the partition action to partition the"
"land  described 
in 
the  schedule 
to 
the  plaint  between 
the"
"plaintiff-respondent  and  the  1st  defendant-respondent.    At  the"
"preliminary  survey, 
the  petitioner  made  a  claim  before 
the"
"surveyor.    As  seen  from  Journal  Entry  No.12  of  the  District"
"Court  case  record,  notice  has  been  served  on  the  petitioner  by"
"registered post.  As the petitioner did not come to Court, as seen"
"from  Journal  Entry  No.  17,  notice  has  again  been  served"
"through Fiscal.  As the petitioner still did not respond to notice,"
"the  Court  has  named  the  petitioner  as  the  2nd  defendant  and"
"proceeded  with 
the  action. 
  After 
trial  Judgment  has  been"
"delivered and Interlocutory Decree has been entered."
"Before the partition action was filed by the plaintiff-respondent,"
"his  predecessor,  the  1st  defendant  in  the  partition  action,  had"
"filed  a  Land  Case  No.5515  against  the  petitioner  regarding  the"
"same  land.    That  case  has,  as  seen  from  P14,  been  withdrawn"
"on  account  of  the  entering  of  the  Interlocutory  Decree  in  the"
"partition case."
"Thereafter 
the  petitioner  has  made  an  application 
in 
the"
"partition 
case 
for 
intervention. 
  At 
the 
inquiry 
into 
that"
"application,  as  seen 
from  P20, 
the  petitioner,  whilst  giving"
"evidence  under  oath,  has  withdrawn  that  application,  on  the"
"premise  that  â€œthe  petitioner,  the  plaintiff  and  the  1st  defendant"
