"M","ansoor  v.  OIC  Avissawella  [1991]  2  Sri  LR  75  is  based  on  the"
"well-established general principle that:",""
"","Where  a  statute  creates  a  right  and,  in  plain  language,"
"","gives a specific remedy or appoints a specific tribunal for its"
"","enforcement,  a  party  seeking 
to  enforce 
the  right  must"
"","resort to that tribunal and not to others."
"The Agrarian Development Act is  a special Act passed  inter  alia",""
"to  particularly","resolve 
the  disputes  between 
landlords  and"
"tenant  cultivators  of  paddylands.    Hence  the  jurisdiction  of  the",""
"ordinary  courts  to  entertain  and  determine  such  disputes  are",""
"ousted.  Section 98 of the Agrarian Development Act enacts:",""
"","The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding"
"","anything  to  the  contrary 
in  any  other  written 
law,  and"
"","accordingly,  in  the  event  of  any  conflict  or  inconsistency"
"","between  the provisions of this Act  and such other law,  the"
"","provisions of this Act shall prevail."
"The learned counsel for the appellant does not dispute the said",""
"legal position.  But her contention is that the Magistrate’s Court",""
"lacks jurisdiction in such disputes only if both parties agree that",""
"there  is  a  landlord  and  tenant  cultivator  relationship  between",""
"them.","As 
the  appellant 
in 
this  case  does  not  accept 
the"
"respondent as a tenant cultivator under him, the counsel argues",""
"that the Magistrate’s Court has jurisdiction to decide the matter",""
"on possession, and therefore the Judgment of the High Court is",""
"erroneous.  Counsel cites Hearth v. Peter [1989] 2 Sri LR 325 in",""
"support where it was authoritatively held that:",""
