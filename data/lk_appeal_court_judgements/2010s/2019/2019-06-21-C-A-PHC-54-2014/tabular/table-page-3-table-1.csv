further 
instructions 
from  the  Secretary  of  the  Public"
"Service  Commission  of  the  Central  Provincial  Council  regarding"

"Provincial  Council,  who 
issued  X10,

"the Provincial Ministry of Health not to pay the salary during the"
"period  which  the  petitioner  abstained  from  work  without  prior"
"approval. 
  This  has  been 
informed  to  the  petitioner  by  the"
"Secretary  of  the  Provincial  Ministry  of  Health  by  X12  dated"
"20.07.2011  (at  page  92  of  the  brief).    The  petitioner  does  not"
"challenge  R9,  nor  has  he  made  the  Secretary  of  the  Public"
"Service Commission of the Central Provincial Council a party to"
"the application.  In the circumstances I cannot understand why"
"and how the petitioner files this application seeking the Court to"
"force the respondents to implement the decision in X10.   There"
"is no basis for this application."
"The mandamus sought is clearly misconceived in law.  Appeal is"
"dismissed with costs."
