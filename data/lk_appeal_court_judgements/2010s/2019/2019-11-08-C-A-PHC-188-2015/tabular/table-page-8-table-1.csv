that  such  an  offence  could  be  committed  agall1. 
If  this"
"","argument  is  accepted  anybody  could  get  away  from  discharging  his  burden"
"","by  affirming that he gave  instructions to  the  driver.  Accordingly,  I am  of the"
"","the 
view 
that  giving  mere  verba l 
instructions 
to 
the  Accused  driver  by"
"","Appellant  does  not  sufficiently  establish  that  the  Appellant  took  precautionary"

the  said  vehicle  which  was  used 
to  commit  a  similar  offence"
"","before.  Brother in  law of the  Appellant who  was  under control  of the  rice  mill"
"","and 
the 
lorry,  never  gave  evidence  even 
to  say  that  he  took  precautionary"
"","measures."
"16.","The Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submitted  that  the  learned  Magistrate  in  her"
"","order  dated  20.10.20 I 0,  proceeded  to  adjudicate  the  matter  on  the  premise"
"","that  there  is  a  presumption  that  the  owner  has  not  taken  all  precautions  to"
"","prevent  the  use  of the  vehicle  for 
the  commission  of the  offence  and  had"
"","come  to  a  conclusion  that  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  adduce  evidence  to"
"","rebut the said presumptions.  Even  though  the  learned Magistrate has erred in"
"","stating 
that 
there 
is 
such  a  presumption,  her  order 
for  confiscation  was"
"","correct in  law and  the Appellant has not been  prejudiced."
