"order made under section  38(a) of the Act marked P4 for rea son s of delay."
"Writ of Mandamus Compelling Revocation of The  Vesting Order"
"Section 39(1) of the Act vests the Minister in  charge  of Land  with the power to revoke a vesting"
"order made under section  38  of the Act if possession  of the land  ha s not actually been taken for"
"and  on  behalf of the State."
"Although document R1  indicates that the constructive possess ion of the land in dispute has been"
"handed over to the Urban Development Authority it is  not in  dispute that actual possession is not"
"with the State and  hence it is arguable that a revocation  of the vesting order is at least in theory"
"possible ."
"But there are two questions which in  my view must be  addre ssed  by Court namely whether the"
"Minister has a discretion in  deciding whether to revoke the divesting order and secondly whether"
"revocation  of the whole vesting order is possible where the vesting order relates to several  lots"
"of lands and the possession of some of which have  been taken over by the State."
"I am minded only to consider the second question in the instant case and leave the other question"
"to  be  considered  in  the  future  in  an  appropriate  ca se  with  the  benefit  of a  full  argument  by"
"parties."
