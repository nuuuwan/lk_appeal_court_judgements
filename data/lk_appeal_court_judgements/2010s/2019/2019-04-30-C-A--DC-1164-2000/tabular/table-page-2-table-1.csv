"against  the  three  defendants  for  a  declaration  of  title  to  two  lands  depicted  in  the"
"schedule  to  the  plaint,  eviction  of  the  defendants  therefrom,  and  for  damages.  It  is"
"axiomatic that a permit holder under the Land Development Ordinance enjoys sufficient"
"title 
to  enable  him  to  maintain  a  vindicatory  action  against  a  trespasser~vide  D.P."
"Palisena  v.  KKD.  Perera  56  N.L.R  407;  Bandaranayake  v.  Karunawathie  (2003)  3"
"Sri.LR 295;Jayaalath v.  Karunatilaka 2013 (1) Sri L.R.  337."
"Be that as it may,  the permit had long been issued to the original Plaintiff in 1962 and he"
"instituted this action against a three defendants alleging unlawful possession as far back"
"as  from  1978  and the  plaint had since  been  amended  several  times  until  the  trial was"
"taken  up  on  the  amended  plaint  dated  31.05.1989.  It  has  to  be  remembered  that  the"
"declaration  that was  sought by the  amended plaint in 1989  was  to  the effect  that the"
"permit held by the original Plaintiff Peter de  Mel was yet valid and effectual.  It would"
"appear  that  the  original  Plaintiff  Peter  de  Mel  passed  away  on  14.03.1990  and  the"
"Appellant before this Court Belin Perera who was not a consanguine son of Peter de Mel"
"was substituted in the room of the original Plaintiff."
"The substituted Plaintiff~Appellant Belin Perera was neither the nominee of the original"
"permit holder (the original plaintiff) nor was he one who fell within the Third Schedule"
"of the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 as  amended. When the trial began, it"
"was  the substituted  Plaintiff~Appellant Belin  Perera  who gave  evidence  and  admitted"
"that he was not the son of the original Plaintiff (permit holder) Peter de Mel. Admittedly"
"the  original  Plaintiff  had  been  married  to 
the  mother  of  the  substituted  Plaintiff~"
"Appellant. 
In  other  words, 
the 
substituted 
Plaintiff~Appellant  was  not  a 
lineal"
