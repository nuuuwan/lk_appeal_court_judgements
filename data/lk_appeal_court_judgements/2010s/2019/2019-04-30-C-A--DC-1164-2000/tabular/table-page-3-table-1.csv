"The learned Additional District Judge  of Polonnaruwa by his judgment dated 03.10.2000"
"has  dismissed 
the  plaint  holding 
that  the  substituted  Plaintiff-Appellant  was  not"
"entitled to inherit the rights of the deceased Plaintiff Peter de  Mel. One of the reasons"
"given for  the dismissal of the  plaint was  that the substituted Plaintiff was  neither the"
"nominee of Peter de Mel nor was a consanguine relative coming within Third Schedule of"
"the LDO.  The learned Additional District Judge of Polonnaruwa  makes two findings  that"
"are 
relevant 
to 
the  consideration  of 
this  appeal-namely, 
the  substituted  Plaintiff"
"Appellant, 
though  not  a  consanguine  relative  of  the  original  Plaintiff,  was  properly"
"substituted  according  to  law  and  that  the  original  Plaintiff had  a  valid  and  effectual"
"permit  at the time of institution of the case."
"The learned Additional District Judge further  held that since the substituted Plaintiff"
"Appellant did not satisfy the requirements of the LDO,  there was no way that the Court"
"would grant him the remedies sought in the plaint."
"Mr.  Vijithsingh who appeared for  the Appellant strenuously impugned the findings  and"
"conclusions of the learned Additional District Judge. The thrust of his argument was that"
"that  the  substituted  Plaintiff-Appellant  was  properly  substituted  and 
having  held"
"permitted  to  prosecute  the  action, 
it  was  contradictory  for 
the  learned  Additional"
"District Judge  to  have  improperly  disallowed  the  relief  prayed  for  in  the  plaint. The"
"original Plaintiff had sought a declaration that his permit under the LDO was yet valid."
"Though he sought this  relief by his  original plaint dated 05.05.1978,  it is  a component"
"element of  a vindicatory action,  the  title,  though sufficient to institute such an action,"
"must continue throughout the course of action. Not only must the Plaintiff have title at"
"the time the rei vindicatio is instituted, but he must retain title throughout the action-see"
