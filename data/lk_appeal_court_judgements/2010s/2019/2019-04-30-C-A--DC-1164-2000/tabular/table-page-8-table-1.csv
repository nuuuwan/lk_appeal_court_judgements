"As such, no adiation of inheritance could possibly have taken place in consequence of the"
"death  of  the  original  Plaintiff,  because  no  rights  of  ownership  or interests  could have"
"possibly devolved upon his death on Belin Perera. That being so, he could not have been"
"substituted as the next of kin because Belin Perera had not ""adiated the inheritance""."
"At page 2104 Sarkar refers to a case in which it was held that upon the death of a trustee"
"a new trustee,  who is  elected or  appointed,  cannot be substituted as  the estate of the"
"former  trustee had not devolved on the new trustee in consequence of the death of the"
"former trustee."
"The above case illustrates the principle that the next of kin of a deceased party can be"
"substituted only,  but only, if there is  a ""devolution""  of interests on the next of kin as  a"
"result of the death of the original party."
"Devolution of interests may not take place or occur due to various reasons. Since this was"
"a permit given at the instance of the state, it is through the provisions of the LDO  that"
"the  proprietary interest that resided in  the  original  Plaintiff is  transmissible  upon his"
"death.  Under  the  LDO  one  has  to  be  a  nominee  or  should belong  to  the  category  of"
"relatives  who are specified under the Third Schedule.  To inherit is  to receive  or  derive"
"property from  parents  or  ancestor  upon  or  in  consequence  of  the  death  of  parent  or"
"ancestor.  To inherit or adiate is  to receive property from  an ancestor, be it noted, under"
"the laws of intestate succession or under a statutory devolution as is found in the LDO."
