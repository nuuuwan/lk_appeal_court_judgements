"It is to be observed that the wording in Section 394(2) is next of kin who ""have"" adiated"
"the inheritance. Whether the expression ''next of kin"" includes or means one person or"
"more than one person depends on the circumstances or the facts peculiar to a particular"
"case.  For instance, if the deceased plaintiff had one child, the expression ''next of kin"", in"
"such a context would necessarily mean one person. If there is one solitary heir who has"
"adiated the inheritance, he enjoys the status or the right to continue the action after the"
"death of original Plaintiff."
"At  page  2105  Chitaley  and  Rao  2nd  edition~vol~ 2,  the  same  view  as  that  expressed  by"
"Sarkar has been articulated. To quote:"
