"District  Judge  has  held  that  the  substituted  Plaintiff-Appellant  was  not  capable  of"
"deriving  title  from  the  deceased  Plaintiff because  he  was  neither  the  nominee  of  the"
"permit holder nor was he one of those enumerated in the Third Schedule to the LDO.  I"
"have no reason to differ from this reasoning but what is disconcerting as a contradictory"
"reasoning of the learned Additional District Judge is his finding  that the Appellant was"
"properly  substituted in  the  room  of  the  original  permit  holder.  Was  the  substituted"
"Plaintiff-Appellant entitled to be substituted in the room of the original Plaintiff?  In my"
"view  the  answer  to  this  question  will  suffice  to  dispose  of  the  question-whether  the"
"plaint must be allowed or dismissed?"
"It  has  to  be  remembered  that  the  subject-matter  of  the  action  was  not  the  private"
"property of the original Plaintiff which was capable of transmission through an inter vivos"
"disposition by a deed or by testate succession or otherwise."
"As  to how the permit would devolve  on the successors  of the original permit holder is"
"dealt with in the LDO  and though the learned Additional District Judge holds  that the"
"title of the original Plaintiff remained effectual right throughout,  there is  no legal basis"
"that he adduces for this conclusion. But the finding of the Additional District Judge that"
"the  Appellant  was  not entitled to  succeed  to  the  permit is  referable  to  LDO  and  that"
"finding is certainly unassailable-for succession by a spouse of a permit holder under the"
"LDO-see Sections 48, 48B,  49 and Sl and for inheritance in the absence of nomination-see"
"Section 72 and Third Schedule to the LDO."
"Let me  now turn to the question I have posed above. Was the Appellant entitled to be"
"substituted in the room of the original permit holder? I have said that the answer to this"
"question  is  dispositive  of  this  case.  The  Additional  District Judge  has  stated  in  his"
"judgment that the substitution of the Appellant in the room of the original Plaintiff was"
"properly effected.  But I must observe that there is  also no reasoning as  to why it was a"
"permissible substitution."
