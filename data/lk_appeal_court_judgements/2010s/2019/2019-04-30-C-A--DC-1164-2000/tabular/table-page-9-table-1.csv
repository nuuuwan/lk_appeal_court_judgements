"In  the  circumstances  this  action has  to  be dismissed because  the substituted Plaintiff"
"Belin Perera had no legal right to prosecute or continue the action upon the demise of the"
"original Plaintiff. When the substituted Plaintiff~Appellant has no right to maintain the"
"action the inevitable result ought to follow i.e.  the action will have to be dismissed."
"The effect of an improper substitution was considered in Sarlin  v. James Fernando 63"
"N.LR. 34.  In that case the Court considered the combined effect of the operation of both"
"Section 394(2) and 398(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. On the facts and circumstances of"
"that case, Basnayake c.J. held that, ""the effect of the improper substitution of a legal representative"
"in place of a judgment debtor is to nullify an execution sale""."
"One has to recall section 392 of the CPC as  well~""The death of a plaintiff or defendant shall not"
"cause the action to abate if the right to sue on the cause of action survives."" For the reasons adduced"
"above  the  right  to  sue  on  the  cause  of  action  did  not  survive  to  the  purported legal"
"representative  namely  Belin  Perera  the  improperly  substituted  Plaintiff~Appellant and"
"therefore the death of the plaintiff caused the action to abate and the District Court was"
"quite oblivious to this consequence of nullity that had supervened.  The initial question"
"whether the application made by the Appellant for substitution could  be allowed should"
"have  been  answered  having  regard  to  the  law  surrounding  Chapter  XXV  containing"
"provisions relating to continuation of actions after alteration of a party's status and the"
"proceedings should have abated at an anterior point of time without the substitution of"
"the Appellant being allowed."
