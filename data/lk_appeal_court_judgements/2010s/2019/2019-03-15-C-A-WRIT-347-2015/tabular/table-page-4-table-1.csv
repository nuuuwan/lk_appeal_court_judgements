"h
ouse No. 5/1 was vested with the Commissioner.  No extent of"
"land,  appurtenant  to  the  house,  properly  identified  by  way  of  a"
"Plan, was vested with the Commissioner by it."
"The determination of the extent of land reasonably appurtenant"
"to 
the  house 
is  an 
important  determination,  which  directly"
"affects  the  rights  of  the  co-owners  of  the  land,  particularly  the"
"petitioner who is living in the adjoining land of the same corpus"
"as the prominent owner."
"Under  section  16(1),  when  the  Commissioner  forms  an  opinion"
"with regard to the extent of land reasonably appurtenant to the"
"house,  he  shall,  in  my  view,  give  a  hearing  to  the  parties  who"
"would  be  affected  by  his  determination.    He  cannot  decide  that"
"important  question  affecting  the  proprietary  rights  of  the  true"
"owners of the property arbitrarily or by giving a hearing only to"
"the tenantâ€•the prospective transferee."
"The intention of this piece of legislation was not to give lands to"
"the tenants, but to give houses.  If only the house is given, as it"
"is  of  no  use,  the  legislature  wanted  to  give  an  extent  of  land"
"reasonably appurtenant to the house."
"It 
is 
the  contention  of 
the 
learned  State  Counsel 
for 
the"
"Commissioner of National Housing that the Preliminary Plan P9"
"prepared  for  the  partition  case  was  based  on  the  old  Plan  P1"
"made 
in  1960,  and 
therefore 
the  Commissioner  was  not"
"unreasonable  when  he  formed  the  opinion  in  relation  to  the"
"extent of land reasonably appurtenant to the house based on the"
"said Preliminary Plan P9."
