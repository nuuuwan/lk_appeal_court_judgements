"explained the delay."
"This  leads  me  to  deal  with  another  important  matter,  which"
"vitiates  the  decision  of  the  Commissioner  of  National  Housing."
"After the Commissioner of National Housing took the  impugned"
"decision ex parte, it was incumbent on his part to communicate"
"it 
to 
the  persons  adversely  affected  by 
it, 
especially 
the"
"petitioner.  According to section 39(1) of the Ceiling on Housing"
"Property 
Law, 
“Any 
person  aggrieved 
by  any  decision

"communicated  to  such  person,  appeal  against  such  decision  or"
"determination  to  the  Board  (of  Review),  stating  the  grounds  of"

"appurtenant to the house No. 5/1) to the petitioner or any of the"
"co-owners to the land  depriving them the opportunity to appeal"
"to  the  Board  of  Review  against  that  determination.    This  is  a"

"application  of  the  petitioner.  Vide  Leelawathie  v.  Commissioner"
"of National Housing [2004] 3 Sri LR 175, Muttiah v. Commissioner"
"of National Housing [1995] 2 Sri LR 74."
"For 
the  aforesaid 
reasons, 
I  allow

  Accordingly,
