"t
he question of the extent of land as is reasonably appurtenant"
"to the house."
"Learned President’s Counsel for the 2nd, 3rd and 5th respondents"
"has  raised  two  preliminary  objections  to  the  maintainability  of"
"this application.  As it has been emphasized even in the written"
"submissions, I must deal with them."
"One  relates  to  acquiescence.    In  paragraph  3(a)  of  the  written"
"submissions  learned  President’s  Counsel  states  that  although"
"the  petitioner  to  this  application  was  a  party  to  the  partition"
"action, she never objected to the appurtenant land possessed by"
"Weerasekara  as  depicted 
in  the  Preliminary  Plan. 
  I  cannot"
"understand the point of argument.  In partition actions, parties"
"do  not  ordinarily  object  to  the  Preliminary  Plans  prepared  by"
"Court  Commissioners.    Those  Preliminary  Plans  represent  the"
"current  status  of 
the 
land 
to  be  partitioned 
in  situ. 
  The"
"petitioner does not dispute the Preliminary Plan.  But it does not"
"mean  that  at  the  end  of  the  trial,  the  Judge  will  partition  the"
"land  as  depicted 
in 
the  Preliminary  Plan. 
 
I 
reject 
that"
"preliminary objection."
"The second preliminary objection relates to laches.  The learned"
"President’s  Counsel 
states 
that 
conveyance 
P12 
is  dated"
"02.07.2013,  but  the  petitioner  came  to  Court  on  02.09.2015,"
"and  therefore  application  shall  be  dismissed  in  limine  due  to"
"delay.  It is the position of the petitioner that she was not aware"
"of  the  aforesaid  conveyance  until  she  complained  to  the  police"
"against  Weerasekara 
for 
surveying 
the 
land  without 
any"
"authority.    It  is  at  that  inquiry,  Weerasekra  has  told  the  police"
