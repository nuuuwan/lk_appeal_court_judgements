"The  same  principle  was  restated  by  this  Court  in  Ishak  v.  Laxman  Perera  Director  General  oj"
"Custams and another [(2003)  3 SrLL.R.  18]."
"In  this  case  as  well  there  is  no  decision  by  the  2nd  Respondent  as  he  was  merely  stating  the"
"resultant position of law applied to the facts of this case."
"Alternative Remedy"
"De Smith, Woolf and Jowell; Judicial Review oj Administrative Action (5 th  Ed.,  page 813) reads:"
"""Where 
there 
is  an  alternative  procedure  which  will  provide 
the  applicant  with  a"
"satisfactory remedy the courts will usually insist on  an  applicant exhausting that remedy"
"before seeking judicial review. In doing so the court is coming to a discretionary decision."""
"It is further stated that (at page  814):"
"""where there is a choice of another separate  process outside the courts, a true question"
"for the exercise of discretion exists.  For the court to require the alternative procedure to"
"be  exhausted  prior to resorting to judicial  review  is  in  accord  with judicial  review being"
"properly regarded as being a remedy of last resort.  It is important that the process should"
"not be clogged  with unnecessary cases,  which are perfectly capable of being dealt with in"
"another 
tribunal. 
It  can  also  be 
the  situation 
that  Parliament,  by  establishing  an"
"alternative  procedure,  indicated  either  expressly  or  by  implication  that  it intends  that"
"procedure to be  used. 
In exercising its discretion, the court will attach importance to the"
"indication of Parliament's intention ."""
"The  observations  above  refer  to  the  existence  of  an  alternative  process  outside  court.  The"
"remedy  provided  by  Section  154  of  the  Ordinance 
is 
in  a  court  of  law  and  as  such 
these"
"observations  should  apply  with  greater  force  as  one  cannot  complain  when 
the  alternative"
"remedy is in  a court of law with all the incidents of impartiality inherent in  its process."
