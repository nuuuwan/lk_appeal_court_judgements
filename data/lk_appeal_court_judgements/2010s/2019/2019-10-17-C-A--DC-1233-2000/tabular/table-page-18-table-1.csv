"partition  action,  the  Court  should  insist  upon  due  compliance  with this requirement  by"
"the surveyor."
"Hence  in  that case  as  well  the  land  sought to be  partition ed was  larger than  the  land  described"
"in  the plaint."
"On  the contrary in thi s case  while the  land  described  in the plaint was  about six  acres  in  extent"
"the  land  that was  partitioned  is  A.  3 R. 3 P.  10.2  in  extent. Therefore, the facts of this  case  are"
"distinguishable  from  Richard and Anather v. Seibel  Nana  and Others  (supra)  and  Sopya  Silva  v."
"Magilin Silva (supra)."
"In  Brampy  Appuhamy v.  Menis Appuhamy  (supra)  the  surveyor  surveyed  a land  of which  two"
"boundaries did not tally with the description of the land given in the schedule to the commission."
"It is  in  this  context that court held  that the surveyor has  not duly executed  his  commission  and"
"went on to state that where the surveyor is unable to locate the land,  he  must report that fact to"
"court  and  ask  for  its  further  directions.  Brampy  Appuhamy  v.  Menis  Appuhamy  (supra)  was"
"decided  under the then Partition Act No. 16 of 1951."
"In  the present case  Licensed  Surveyor W. Ranasinghe  executed  two commissions to survey the"
"corpus.  Preliminary  Plan  No.  302  (X)  was  prepared  after a survey done on  25th  and  26th  Augu st"
"1976. That contained three lots of land  identified as  'q',  'qo and 
'q,' containing a total of A.3 R."
"1 P. 23.4  in  extent. The  second  survey took  place  on  14th  March  1977 which  resulted  in  Survey"
"'q1'  containing a 
Plan  No.  338 (Y)  which contained four lots of land identified as  'q',  'qJ', 'q,' and"
"total of A.3  R. 3 P.  10.2 in extent. The  learned Additional District Judge held that the corpus to be"
"partitioned consists of lots of land  identified as  'q', 
'qo'  and 
'q,' in  Preliminary Plan  No.  302  (X)"
"and  lot 'f11'  in  Survey Plan  No. 338 (Y).  It is observed that the Surveyor has in  his report of Plan Y"
"stated  that lots 'q', 
'qo'  and 
'q,'  in  Preliminary Plan  No. 302  (X)  is  the same  as  lots 'q', 
'qo'  and"
"'q,' in  Plan  No.  338 (Y)  [Appeal  Brief page  164)."
