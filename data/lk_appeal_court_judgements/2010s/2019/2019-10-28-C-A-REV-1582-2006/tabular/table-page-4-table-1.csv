"S
ection  189  allows 
the  Court 
to  correct  any  clerical  and"
"arithmetical mistake in any Judgment or order arising from any"
"accidental  slip  or  omission.    In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of"
"this  case,  there  is  no  such  mistake  that  has  occurred  due  to"
"accidental slip or omission.  The case was reportedly settled and"
"evidence  was 
led  and  the  Judgment  was  delivered 
instantly"
"wherein 
soil 
rights 
of 
the 
parties 
and 
entitlement 
to"
"improvements  including  the  plantation  were  decided  in  open"
"Court. 
  This  happened 
in 
front  of 
former 
the  petitioner’s"
"Attorney-at-Law."
"If 
the  petitioner  was  not  agreeable 
to 
the 
fractional  shares"
"decided  upon  by  Court,  it  would  have  been  pointed  out  to  the"
"learned  Judge,  then  and  there,  as  it  was  a  Judgment  delivered"
"upon  a  settlement.    Otherwise,  when  he  obtained  a  copy  of  the"
"proceedings, if  she later  realized that there  was an arithmetical"
"mistake 
in 
the 
calculation 
of 
shares, 
and 
also 
in 
the"
"apportionment  of  the  plantation,  she  should  have,  through  her"
"former  Attorney-at-Law 
informed 
the  Court 
to  correct 
that"
"mistake.  She does not need to retain a new Attorney-at-Law to"
"tell  it  to  Court  after  more  than  5  ½  years  from  the  date  of  the"
"Judgment."
"On 
the  other  hand, 
if 
it  was  a  mistake, 
it 
is  difficult 
to"
"understand why none of the other defendants or their Attorneys-"
"at-Law did not realize it until the petitioner realized it more than"
"5 ½ years from the date of the Judgment.  It is unbelievable that"
"none of the 31 defendants did not get proceedings of that day for"
"more than 5 ½ years from the date of the Judgment."
