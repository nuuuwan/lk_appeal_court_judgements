"the question involved in that action be added""."
"There are two limbs to Section 18  and whilst the r t  limb deals with the power to strike"
"out parties,  the 2nd  limb deals with the power to add parties.  The argument before me"
"concerned the alleged failure  to have  added the Petitioner in the Court a quo  as  a party"
"and it behoves me to look at the 2nd limb. Section 18(1) can be invoked either by a party"
"to the suit or by the Court suo moto.  Mere inaction on the part of a Plaintiff to implead a"
"party does not affect  the court's power under the subsection. If A sues B,  either A or B"
"can seek to add a party or Court on its own motion can seek to add a party. As  I read"
"Section 18(1) between the lines, I observe that a third party C desiring to be added as  a"
"party cannot make an application. It is either A or B or Court who can make additions. If"
"C makes an application to Court to be added,  it is not on the motion of the Court and"
"therefore Court cannot make the addition. So if at all C wants to be added, C has to seek"
"the assistance of either A or B.  This is what I see in Section 18(1) and Section 19 fortifies"
"my view because,  according to Section 19,  no person shall be allowed to intervene in a"
"pending action otherwise than in pursuance of,  and in conformity with the provisions of"
"the last preceding section namely Section 18.  In other words interventions or additions"
"have  to be effected within the four  corners of Section 18.  It is either the Plaintiff or the"
"Defendant who has  to make the application for  addition or it has to be the Court acting"
