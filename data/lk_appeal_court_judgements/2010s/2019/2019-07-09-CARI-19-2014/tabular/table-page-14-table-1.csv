"the  Civil  Procedure  Code  the  wider  construction adopted by  English  Courts  is  to be"
"preferred. Whenever a Court can see in the transaction brought before it that the rights"
"of  one  of the  parties will  or  may  be  so  affected  that other actions  may  be brought  in"
"respect of that transaction, the Court has the power to bring all the parties before it and"
"determine the rights of all in one proceeding."""
"But the right of the other party must be an enforceable right and it cannot be chimerical"
"or unreal."
"I have just borne in mind the words of Section lS-"" ....... whose presence before the Court may be"
"necessary in order to  enable the Court  effectually  and completely  to  adjudicate upon  and settle or the"
"question  involved  in 
that  action  be  added.""  and  taken  the  view  that  the  addition  of  the"
"Petitioner would  have  been  otiose  since  the  question involved  in  the  action  does  not"
"involve the Petitioner for an effectual adjudication. In so doing I might have adopted the"
"narrower construction which though  ensures  that justice is  meted in a case where it is"
"quite apparent that the power of attorney became a simulated transaction in light of the"
"fact that it was not conclusively proved at all."
"In such a situation it would be otiose for  the Court to have added the Petitioner on its"
"own  motion.  If  indeed  the  Petitioner  wanted to  be  a  party,  he  could have  asked  his"
"brother in law -the Defendant-
to move  the Court to add him as  a party-an act which"
"could have been initiated by the Petitioner. Instead he chose to become a witness for the"
"Defendant  but his  testimony was  not  of  any  assistance  to  establish the fact  in  issue"
"whether the Plaintiff had effected a valid power of attorney in favor of the Defendant."
"Thus I find  that the Petitioner is not a necessary party in the suit between the Plaintiff"
"and the Defendant and from the foregoing I take the view that there are no circumstances"
"that warrant the exercise of jurisdiction of this Court by way of revision and/or restitutio"
"in integrum and accordingly I dismiss the Petitioner's application."
