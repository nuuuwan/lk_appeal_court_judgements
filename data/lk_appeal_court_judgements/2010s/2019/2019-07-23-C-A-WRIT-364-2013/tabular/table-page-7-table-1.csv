"Lecturer 
(Probationary)  accordingly  had  been  made  under 
the  hand  of 
the  Vice"
"Chancellor of the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka based on the said decision of the UGC."
"to  approve 
the  appointment  of  the 
After  having  perused  the  decision  of  the  UGC"
"Petitioner to the post of Lecturer (probationary) vis--a--vis  the criteria set out in the UGC"
"Circular  No.721  with  regard  to  the  Scheme  of  Recruitment  pertaining  to  the  post  of"
"Lecturer (Probationary), Senior Lecturer (Grade II), and Senior Lecturer (Grade I)  of the"
"University or an Institute of Higher Education,  I hold the view that the decision of the"
"U GC cannot be faulted.  It was the contention of the Respondents that the Petitioner is"
"not  measure  up  to  the  strict  terms  of  the  scheme  of recruitment  as  he  did not have  a"
"degree with specialization in Computer Science and notwithstanding the absence of such"
"a  degree 
in  the  relevant  field, 
the  UGC  had  considered  the  Diploma  in  Computer"
"Technology which the Petitioner had and took the decision to grant approval to appoint"
"him  to the post of Lecturer  (probationary)  in Computer Science.  In  the letter that the"
"U GC  wrote to the Vice  Chancellor giving the approval to appoint the Petitioner to the"
"post of Lecturer (probationary),  the U GC  specifically stated that the Petitioner had not"
"fulfilled  the requirements  in the  scheme  of recruitment for  appointment  to the post of"
"Senior Lecturer (Grade II).  It is  this decision not to appoint the Petitioner to the post of"
"Senior  Lecturer (Grade II)  that this Petitioner impugns in these proceedings and he also"
"seeks  a  mandamus  compelling  the  UGC  to  approve  the  recommendation  made  by  the"
"University and appoint him to the position of Senior Lecturer."
