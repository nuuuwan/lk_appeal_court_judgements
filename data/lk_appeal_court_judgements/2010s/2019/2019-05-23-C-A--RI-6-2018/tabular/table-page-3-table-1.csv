"T
he second order which the 1st plaintiff seeks to set aside is the"
"order made on the following day, i.e. 23.11.2007 reflected in JE"
"No.101  whereby  upon  petition  and  affidavit  being 
filed, 
the"
"aforesaid  Rohana  Bandula  Keerthisinghe  Perera  was  appointed"
"as the 1A defendant (instead of  the  10th  defendant).  There was"
"no reason for the plaintiff to object to it as only the defendantâ€™s"
"number  has  been  changed  from  10  to  1A.    The  1st  plaintiff"
"cannot now challenge that order after 12 years."
"The  third  order  which  the  1st  plaintiff  challenges  is  the  order"
"dated 29.11.2007 (P12).  According to the proceedings, that was"
"the date of inquiry into the application in respect of the claim for"
"unallotted  shares. 
 
It 
is  noteworthy 
that,  according 
to 
the"
"proceedings, 
the  plaintiff  has  been 
fully  represented  by  his"
"Attorney-at-Law on that day.  At the inquiry, the 1A defendant,"
"namely,  Rohana  Bandula  Keerthisinghe 
Perera 
has 
given"
"evidence  and  he  has  not  been  cross  examined  by  the  Attorney-"
"at-Law of the plaintiff.  Having satisfied with that uncontroverted"
"and  unchallenged  evidence,  the  Court  has  made  order  allotting"
"Lot 8 of the Final Plan to the 1st and 2nd defendants in common,"
"2/3  and  1/3  share  respectively,  and  further  ordered  to  amend"
"the  Final  Decree  accordingly.    The  1st  plaintiff  has  no  right"
"whatsoever to challenge that order after 12 years."
"The 2nd defendant has later died leaving behind his wife and two"
"children,  and  the  1A  defendant  has  purchased  their  rights  on"
"Lot 8 by way of a Deed, and made an application to appoint him"
"as  the  legal  representative  of  the  deceased  2nd  defendant1  and"
"deliver  possession  of  the  entire  Lot  8  to  him.    This  application"
"has  been 
allowed  by 
the  District  Judge  by 
order  dated"
"1 Vide pages 134-144 of the DC Brief."
