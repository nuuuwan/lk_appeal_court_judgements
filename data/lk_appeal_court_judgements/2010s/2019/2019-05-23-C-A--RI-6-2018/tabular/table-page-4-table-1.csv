"only entitled to an order for delivery of possession for 2/3 share"
"of the 1st defendant, and he is not entitled to take possession of"
"the 1/3 share in Lot 8 allotted to the deceased 2nd defendant."
"If the learned counsel accepts that the substituted 1A defendant"
"can  take  possession  of  the  2/3  share  in  Lot  8  allotted  to  the"
"deceased 1st  defendant, the 1A defendant can be substituted in"
