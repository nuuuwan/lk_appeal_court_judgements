"S
amayawardhena, J."
"The  petitioner  filed  this  application  seeking  to  quash  by  writ  of"
"certiorari  P12  whereby 
the  1st 
respondent 
(The  Board 
of"
"Investment of Sri Lanka) informed the petitioner that it would no"
"longer  act  upon 
the  decision  made  by  P5. 
  By  P5 
the  1st"
"respondent informed the petitioner the decision of the former to"
"grant the land relevant to this application on lease to the latter"
"to  construct  and  operate  a  cafeteria  subject  to  conditions  and"
"subject to entering into a formal Agreement.   The petitioner also"
"seeks  to  compel  the  1st  respondent  by  writ  of  mandamus  to"
"enter  into  the  said  Lease  Agreement;  and  to  prevent  the  1st"
"respondent  by  writ  of  prohibition  from  obstructing  the  right  of"
"the petitioner to construct and operate a cafeteria in the land."
"The petitioner rests his case on legitimate expectation."
"To  expect  relief  on  legitimate  expectation,  the  petitioner  shall"
"first prove that he acted legitimately.  The act which he expects"
"the  respondent  to  perform  on  the  said  basis  shall  undoubtedly"
"be a lawful act and not an unlawful act."
"The  respondents  in  their  objections  have  convinced  Court  that"
"P5 
has 
not 
been 
issued 
following 
the 
established 
state"
"procurement procedure, but done in an ad hoc manner in order"
"to 
favour  the  petitioner.  The  respondents  point  out  that  no"
"tenders  were  called  and  the  petitioner  was 
just  handpicked"
"exerting undue influence on the then Board.  Thereafter the new"
"Board  has  assigned  that  task  of  constructing  and  operating  a"
"cafeteria to another party following the proper procedure."
"The petitioner has merely denied them in the counter affidavit."
