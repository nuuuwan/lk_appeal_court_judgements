"period  to  the  District  Court  having  jurisdiction  over  the  area"
"where the land parcel is situate."
"Sections 24-26 inter alia deal with the procedure to be adopted and"
"the orders which could be made by the District Court."
"The petitioner in paragraph 24 of the petition says that she could"
"not appeal against the determination of  the 1st respondent as she"
"was not a claimant before the 1st respondent."
"However this assertion was proved to be false by the 1st respondent"
"by tendering documents marked 1R1 and 1R2 with the statement"
"of objections.  Those two documents prove that the petitioner was"
"a claimant before the 1st respondent and there had been an inquiry"
"on  that  claim  on  23.02.2010.    At  that  inquiry  the  petitioner  has"
"admitted that her claim is now restricted to 16.4 perches."
"The  petitioner  did  not 
file  counter  affidavit  against 
the  said"
"statement of objections of the 1st respondent.  The counsel for the"
"petitioner  returned  the  brief  to  the  petitioner  and  the  petitioner"
"had to retain a new counsel."
"It  is  clear  that  the  petitioner  cannot  maintain  this  action.    Her"
"application  shall 
fail 
inter  alia  on  suppression  or  distortion  of"
"material  facts.    When  the  Registration  of  Title  Act,  which  is  a"
"Special  Act,  provides 
for 
the 
appeal  procedure 
against 
the"
"impugned  determination  of 
the  1st 
respondent, 
the  petitioner"
"cannot  ignore  the  appeal  procedure  and  come  before  this  Court"
