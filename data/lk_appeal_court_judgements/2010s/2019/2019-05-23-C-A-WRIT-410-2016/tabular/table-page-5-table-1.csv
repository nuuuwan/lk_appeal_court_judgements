"L
et  me  add  the  following  in  passing.    It  is  not  the  complaint  of"
"the petitioners that complete outsiders who did not possess  the"
"qualifications  were  promoted  as  Accounting  Assistants. 
  The"
"respondents  whom  the  petitioners  say  were  wrongly  promoted"
"were  in  the  same  position  as  that  of  the  petitioners.    The  only"
"point  raised  was  that  they  did  not  sit  for  2015  examination."
"However, the petitioners  admit (or do not dispute) that they sat"
"for  previous  examinations  and  qualified  to  be  promoted  to  the"
"said post, but due to no fault of them, and due to the lapses on"
"the  part  of  the  CEB  administration,  their  promotions  were  not"
"given at the right timeâ€”vide the direction of the Public Petitions"
"Committee 
of 
Parliament  marked 
P13. 
 
This 
is 
further"
"understood  by  the  additional  petition  filed  by  the  petitioners"
"dated  15.03.2017  whereby  the  petitioners  sought  an 
interim"
"order preventing the CEB from holding the 2017 examination to"
"fill  the  then  existing  vacancies  stating  that  such  a  course  of"
"action  will  cause  injustice  to  them  (when  promotions  are  given"
"on  2017  examination).    That  is  similar  to  the  grievances  of  the"
"employees  whose  promotions  are  being  challenged 
in 
these"
"proceedings.    This  is  a  never-ending  process  unless  the  CEB"
"stops  this unhealthy  practice (which seems to be adopting  with"
"ulterior  motives).    This  causes  inter  alia  disunity  among  the"
"employees 
(which  may  sometimes  be  one  of  such  ulterior"
"motives)."
"If 
the 
certiorari 
cannot 
be 
issued, 
consideration 
of 
the"
"application for mandamus does not arise."
"Application is dismissed without costs."
