"advertisement  and  the  interview  held,  but  there  is  no  necessity"
"to make a detailed analysis of those things as what is important"
"is the vacancies existed at the time of the interview."
"The petitioners do not dispute that 14 employees were promoted"
"as  Accounting  Assistants  in  2015  in  order  of  the  Merit  List"
"marked 3AR4."
"Their  complaint  is  that  the  balance  10  vacancies  which  should"
"have been filled from 2015 Merit List were filled from employees"
"applied for the said post in previous years to the detriment of the"
"petitioners,  which,  according  to  the  petitioners,  is  against  the"
"governing circulars referred to above."
"The  CEB  admits  that  there  were  10  more  vacancies,  but  says"
"that they were created after the aforesaid interview in 2015."
"The  petitioners  vehemently  deny  this  and  tenders  the  Board"
"Paper marked P12 dated 29.04.2016 to counter that position.  In"
"P12 
it 
is  stated 
that,  according 
to 
the  Financial 
inter  alia"
"Managerâ€™s 
letter, 
there  were  10 
vacancies 
for  Accounting"
"Assistants at the time of the interview."
"The  learned  DSG  for  the  CEB  does  not  accept  P12  as  a  valid"
"document.    Firstly  learned  DSG    says  that  it  is  a  confidential"
"document;  and  secondly  it  is  only  a  Board  Paper  and  not  a"
"Board  decision;  and 
thirdly 
it 
reflects 
the  position  as  at"
"29.04.2016  and  not  at 
the 
time  of 
the 
interview  held  on"
