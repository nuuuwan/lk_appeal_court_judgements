"such  a  course  of action  is  not  feasible  in  this  instance  and  would  be  to  the"
"detriment of the Petitioner, for two reasons."
"The  first is  the allegation  of the  Petitioner that there  has  been  an  undue delay"
"on  the  part  of the  1st  Respondent  in  evaluating  the  Petitioner's  application."
"This  Court  observes  that  the  application  submitted  by  the  Petitioner  on  29th"

"is

"this  matter for a re-evaluation  by  the  1st  Respondent  or a re-consideration  by"
"the USAB."
"This  Court does not intend to venture into the arena  of academic judgment by"
"taking  on  the  role  of academic  experts  and  awarding  marks to the  Petitioner."
"What this Court would endeavour to do instead is  to determine the marks that"
"the  Petitioner  was 
entitled 
to, 
if  not 
for 
the  procedural 
improprieties"
"committed  by  the  1st  Respondent,  by  applying  the  provisions  of Circular  No."
"723. The  result,  as  demonstrated  by  the table  below is  that the  Petitioner was"
"eligible to be appointed as a Professor and  not Associate  Professor."
