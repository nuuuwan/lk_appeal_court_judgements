"This  Court is  at a loss  to understand  how a Screening Committee consisting of"
"the  said  Professors,  however  knowledgeable  they  may  be 
in  their  areas  of"
"expertise, could  have advised  the Petitioner on  the manner in which  he  should"
"prepare  his  self-assessment.  The  Petitioner,  by  a  letter dated  16th  June  2009,"
"annexed to the petition marked  'A28b' had  refused to accept the observations"
"made  by  the  Screening  Committee  with  regard  to  his  application  on  the  basis"
"that  they  were  not  eligible  to  study  his  application.  This  Court  also  observes"
"that the  Petitioner had  in  fact  pointed out in  'A28b' that it was the duty of the"
"External  Experts to decide on  the relevance of the contributions made  by  him,"
"a  point  which  was  later  echoed  by  the  University  Grants  Commission  by  its"
"letter marked 'RR28'."
"The  gravity  of  the  complaint  of  the  Petitioner  that  the  appointment  of  a"
"Screening  Committee outside the scheme  of evaluation  set out in  Circular No."
"is 
illegal  can  only  be  understood  when  one  considers  the  fact  that  the 
723"
"observations  of  the  Screening  Committee  had  been  made  available  to  the"
"External  Experts,  completely  undermining  the  independence  expected  from"
"the  said  External  Experts.  The  1st  Respondent  has 
in 
fact  admitted  that  the"
"â€¢ 
observations  of the  Screening  Committee  were  sent to  the  External  Experts7"
"This  Court 
is  of 
the  view 
that  while 
the  appointment  of  the  Screening"
"Committee  was  in 
itself  contrary  to  the  procedure  contemplated  by  Circular"
"No.  723,  this course of action goes a step further by being completely contrary"
"even  to the  stated  intention of appointing a Screening  Committee,  which  was"
"to  advise  the  applicants  on  how  to  upgrade  his  or  her  self  assessment.  The"
"Petitioner  claims  that  the  External  Experts  relied  on  the  observations  of the"
"7  Paragraph  16(viii) of the Statement of Objections."
