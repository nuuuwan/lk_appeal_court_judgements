then  the  1st  Respondent  ought  to  have  complied 
in 
full  with  the"

"this Court that not only has the 1st  Respondent adopted a procedure of its own"
"by  having  direct  resort  to a third  External  expert,  outside  of Circular  No.  723"
"and  even  Circular  No.  869,  but  also  failed  to  explain  as  to  why  it  adopted  a"

The  Petitioner  states"
"Professor  of  Statistics 
(Biometry),  Department  of  Crop  Science,  Faculty  of"
