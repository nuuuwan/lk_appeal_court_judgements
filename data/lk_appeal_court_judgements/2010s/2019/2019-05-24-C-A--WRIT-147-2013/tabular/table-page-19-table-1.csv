"Taking into consideration the totality of the Petitioner's complaints with regard"
"to  the  Screening  Committee, 
this  Court 
is 
in  agreement  with 
the 
learned"
"President's  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner that  the  1st  Respondent  acted  outside"
"the  scheme  of  promotion  set  out  in  Circular  No.  723  when  it  subjected  the"
"for  assessment  by 
the  Screening  Committee.  Such 
Petitioner's  application"
"action 
is  both 
illegal  and  procedurally 
improper  as 
the  appointment  and"
"function  of the  said  Screening  Committee  was  not  contemplated  by  Circular"
"723."
"The  above  matters  have  been  raised  before  the  USAB  by  the  Petitioner.  This"
"Court has examined the Order of the USAB,  annexed to the petition marked 'G'"
"and  observes  that  the  USAB  has  not  dealt  with  these 
issues  raised  by  the"
"Petitioner with regard to the Screening Committee."
"The second  stage of the Petitioner's complaints is with regard to the manner in"
"which the 1st  Respondent dealt with the reports of the External  Experts."
"the  1st  Respondent  had  appointed  Emeritus  Professor  T. 
The  Senate  of"
"Jogaratnam  and  Professor A.  Nanthakumar as  the  External  Experts to evaluate"
"Sections  2  and  3.1  of the  application  of the  Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  states"
"that  Professor  Nanthakumar  was  an  expert 
in  Mathematics  and  was  not"
"familiar  in  Economic Statistics,  which  is  the  discipline  for which  the  Petitioner"
"had  submitted  his  application.  This  Court  observes 
that  even 
though 
the"
"Respondents  have  denied  this  position, this  Court  has  not been  provided  with"
"the  qualifications  of Professor  Nanthakumar.  However,  the  covering  letter to"
"the  mark  sheet  submitted  by  Professor  Nanthakumar confirms  that  he  was  a"
"Professor  of  Mathematics  and  Statistics,  which 
is 
indicative 
that  he  was"
"19"
