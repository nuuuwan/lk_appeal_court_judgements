"that  the  Petitioner,  by  a  letter  dated  15th  September  2009  annexed  to  the"
"petition  marked  (A39'  informed the 2nd  Respondent, the Vice  Chancellor of the"
"st"
"1
Respondent  University that the  text  books  referred  to  in  Section  3.1.1  and"
"the  research  articles  referred  in  Section  2.3  are  written  in  Tamil.  This  fact too"
"has  not  been  denied  by 
the  1st  Respondent, 
thus  giving  rise 
to  the 
issue"
"whether the review by the third External Expert was in fact effective."
"This  Court observes that the third  External  Expert  has  given  the  Petitioner the"
"following marks:"
"Section 
Mark"
"Section 2 
67.75"
"Section 3.1 
11"
"The  above  complaint  of the  Petitioner,  which  relates  to  Section  3.1  as  well,"
"appears  to  have  some  merit  when  one  considers  the  fact  that  the  Petitioner"
"received  only  11  marks  for  the  said  Section,  which 
is  below  the  threshold"
"specified in Circular No. 723 for appointment as  Professor."
"Be  that as  it may,  having gone through a third External  Expert, what should the"
"1st  Respondent have done with these marks? Should  it act only upon the marks"
"of the third  External  Expert?  Or  should  it take  the  average  of the  marks  given"
"by  the  two  External  Experts  and  then  combine  with  the  marks  of the  third"
"External  Expert and thereafter take the average of these two marks as the final"
"mark? Or should  the  1st  Respondent  have taken  the aggregate  of the  marks of"
"all  three  External  Experts  and  then  taken  an  average,  in  order to  decide  the"
"final  mark?  Or  should  the  1st  Respondent  disregard  the  lowest  of the  three"
"24"
