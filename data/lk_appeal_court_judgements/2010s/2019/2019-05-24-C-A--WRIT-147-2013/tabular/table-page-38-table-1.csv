"Thus,  it 
is  within  the  jurisdiction  of this  Court  to  grant  a  Writ  of Mandamus"

"The third  and  final  objection  of the  learned  Additional Solicitor General  is  that"

the 
jurisdiction  of 
the  USAB  when  he"

the

the"

"that the  USAB  failed  to consider the  matters placed  before  it when  arriving at"
"its decision."
"The  final  question  that  must  be  addressed  by  this  Court  is  the  relief that this"
"Court  can  grant  the  Petitioner.  When  there  is  such  a glaring  violation  of the"
"procedure laid down, this Court would have  preferred to have send this matter"
"back to the 1st  Respondent for a fresh  appraisal  and  evaluation  or to the USAB"
"for  a  fresh  consideration  of  the  matters  raised  by  the  Petitioner.  However,"
