"the  manner  in  which  the  Selection  Committee  altered  the  marks  given  to the"
"Petitioner  by  the  Panel  and  the  External  Experts.  This  Court  would  consider"
"irregularities  committed  by 
the  1st  Respondent  during 
whether  the  alleged"
"each  of these  stages were  illegal,  irrational or procedurally improper and  if so,"
"whether  the  decision  of  the  USAB 
to  dismiss  the  appeal  of  the  Petitioner"
"without taking into consideration such  irregularities can stand."
"The  first complaint of the  Petitioner relates to the  role  played  by a committee"
"appointed  by  the  1st  Respondent,  known  as  the  'Screening  Committee'.  The"
"Petitioner  states  that  Circular  No.  723  stipulates  very  clearly  the  manner  in"
"which  the  evaluation  of an  application  is  to  be  carried  out,  which  has  been"
"outlined  earlier in  this judgment.  The  appointment of a Screening Committee"
"however  is  not  contemplated  by  Circular  No.  723  and  such  a  committee  is"
"therefore outside the approved scheme of promotion."
"The  Petitioner claims  that contrary to the  said  scheme  set  out  in  Circular  No."
"723,  the  1st  Respondent  University had  established  the  'Screening  Committee'"
"to  examine  each  application  and 
to  ""advise""  the  candidate  on 
the  correct"
"allocation  of marks.  In  fact,  the  1st  Respondent,  in  its Statement of Objections"
"has  explained the reasons for the setting up of the Screening Committee in the"
"following manner:"
"""According 
to 
the  experts  who  evaluated 
the 
self  assessments  of"
"candidates,  'the applicants self assessments  were  not in  accordance  with"
"the  marking  scheme  and  that they  had  failed  to  identify the  appropriate"
"section  in  terms  of which  their contributions  could  be  assessed  and  that"
"the 
candidates  had 
also 
claimed  marks  over  and  above 
the 
limits"
"15"
