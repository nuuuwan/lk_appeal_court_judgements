"observe  at this  stage that the  detailed  mark sheet  of the Selection  Committee"
"had  not been  filed  by the 1st  Respondent before the  USAB.  A copy thereof had"
"only  been  tendered  to this  Court  with the counter affidavit,  pursuant to same"
"being made available to the Petitioner by the 1st  Respondent,  after the filing of"
"the Statement of Objections. The failure to submit the mark sheet to the USAB"
"has  in  effect deprived the USAB  of making  a considered  decision  in  respect of"
"the irregularities said to have  been committed by the Selection Committee."
