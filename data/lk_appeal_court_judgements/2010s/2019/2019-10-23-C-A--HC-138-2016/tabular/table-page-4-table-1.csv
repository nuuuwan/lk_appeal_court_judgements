"","name  of the  suspect  as  Kumar  from  her  sister  in  law,  she  had  failed  to"
"","give  his  name  to  the  police.  Although  she  had  told  the  police  that  her"
"","husband  was  abducted  in  February,  according  to  the  charge  the  date  of"
"","abduction  is  8th  March 2009. If she knew that the name of the person who"

"","have  been  her  sister  in  law  who  knew the  Appellant  before.  Prosecution"
"","has failed  to call her to give evidence."
