"decision  made  by  the  Minister  in  terms  of section  2(1)  that  land  in  any  area  is"
"needed for a public purpose. This decision gets narrowed to a particular land or a"
"particular  servitude  which 
is  suited  for  the  public  purpose  when  the  Minster"
"makes a direction to the Acquiring Officer in terms of Section 4(1). Thereafter the"
"Act  provides  for  the  various  steps  in  the  acquisition  of  such 
land  or  servitude"
"including  notices  being  served  on  the  owner  and  another  being  exhibited  in  a"
"conspicuous  place  on  or near the land. A person  having an  interest in  the land or"
"servitude to be acquired is provided an  opportunity in terms of Section 4(4) of the"
"Act  to  object  to  such  acquisition.  The  Secretary  of the  appropriate  Ministry for"
"which  the  land  is  acquired  directs  an 
inquiry  into  the  objections  and  makes  a"
"recommendation 
to 
the  Minster  on 
the  objections 
that  have  been  made."
"Thereupon a firm decision is  made by the Minister in respect of the acquisition by"
"a declaration  under Section  5(1)  which  is  published  in the gazette  and  exhibited"
"on or near the land. In terms of section 5(2) this declaration is conclusive evidence"
"that the land is  required for a public purpose ... """
"Accordingly,  our courts have held that it is  not possible to quash a section 2 notice issued  under"
"the  Act  by  way  of a  writ  of certiorari  [Dayaratne  v.  Rajitha  Senaratne,  Minister of Lands  and"
