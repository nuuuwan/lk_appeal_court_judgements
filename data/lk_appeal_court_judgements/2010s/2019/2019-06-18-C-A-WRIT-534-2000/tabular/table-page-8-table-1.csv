"Urgency"
"The  only  question  this  Court  can  inquire  into  is  whether there  is  an  ""urgency""  compelling the"
"immediate possession  being taken  of the land forming the subject  matter of this application . In"
"Fernandopul/e vs.  Minister of Land and Agriculture [79(11)  N.L.R.  115] the Supreme Court held that"
"while an  order by the Minister under the proviso to section 38 of the Land  Acquisition Act can  be"
"made only in cases of urgency, it is however a matter for a Petitioner who seeks the remedy by"
"way of Certiorari,  to satisfy the  Court that there was  in  fact  no  urgency and  his  application"
"cannot succeed should he fail to do so. (emphasis added). Hence the burden of proof was on the"
"Petitioner to adduce evidence that there was  no urgency and  if he fails to do so,  his application"
"must be  dismissed."
"The  Petitioner has  failed to do so  in  this application.  On  the contrary the documentation before"
"Court clearly establishes that there was an  urgent need  as the 2nd  Pinnawela ZOO had  been given"
"land  belonging  to  Wagolla  Farm  and  it was  necessary  to  locate  the  activities  of Wagolla  Farm"
"without delay."
"For all  the foregoing reasons, the application is  dismissed with costs."
