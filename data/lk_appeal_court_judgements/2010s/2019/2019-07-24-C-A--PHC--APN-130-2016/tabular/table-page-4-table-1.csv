nd party has asked Wijedasa to pay rent direct to the 1st party"
"because of the aforesaid loan transaction."
"The learned Magistrate has refused to accept the informal Lease"
"Agreement  tendered  by  the  1st  party  as  a  genuine  one.    Hence"
"the  learned  Magistrate  has  not  accepted  the  version  of  the  1st"
"party  that  he  had  been  in  possession  of  the  premises  through"
"Wijedasa."
"Also the learned Magistrate has not accepted  the version of the"
"intervenient party that he was in possession of the ground floor"
"of the building as a tenant of the 1st party. Nor has he accepted"
"the informal Lease Agreement tendered in that regard either as a"
"genuine one."
"The  learned  Magistrate  has  noted  that  the  1st  party  in  his  first"
"complaint has not mentioned that he has rented out the ground"
"floor  of  the  building  to  the  intervenient  party,  and  also  the  fact"
"that  the  intervenient  party  has  not  made  any  police  complaint"
"regarding any obstruction to his possession."
"In  the  counter  affidavit  tendered  to  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court,  the"
"1st party has accepted that the possession of the building is with"
"the 2nd party.  If it is a mistake, it has not been corrected so far."
"This matter has been raised in the High Court by the 2nd party."
"The  order  of  the  learned  Magistrate  is  a  well-considered  one."
"There is no necessity to repeat each and every point the learned"
"Magistrate has dealt with in his order."
"I see no reason to interfere with it or the Judgment of the High"
"Court which affirmed it.  The 1st party shall vindicate his rights"
