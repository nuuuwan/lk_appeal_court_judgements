"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"These  proceedings  were  instituted  by  the  police  under  section"
"66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act in the Magistrate’s"
"Court  naming  two  parties  over  a  dispute  relating  to  a  building."
"Later  another  party 
intervened. 
  After 
inquiry 
the 
learned"
"Magistrate  held  with  the  2nd  party  in  terms  of  section  68(1)  on"
"the  basis  that  it  is  the  2nd  party  who  was  in  possession  of  the"
"building at the date of filing the first information in Court.  The"
"learned  Magistrate  further  held  that  the  1st  party  did  not  prove"
"that  he  was  forcibly  dispossessed  by  the  2nd  party  within  two"
"months  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  first  information.    The  learned"
"Magistrate 
took 
the  view 
that 
the  1st  party  was  never 
in"
"possession of the building.  This order of the learned Magistrate"
"has been upheld by the High Court in revision.  It is against that"
"Judgment of the High Court the 1st party has filed this revision"
