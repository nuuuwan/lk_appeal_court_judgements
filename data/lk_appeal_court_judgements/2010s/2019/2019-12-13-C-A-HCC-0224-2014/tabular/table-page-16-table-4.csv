treat  the  said  witness  as  an  adverse  witness  under"

"Thereafter, the State Counsel submitted to court that steps would be taken to file"
"charges  against  the  said  witness  for  contempt  of court and  moved  the  court  to"

"enlarged  the  said  witness  on  bail  and  remanded  him  until  bail  conditions  are"
"completed (Page 238 of the brief)."
