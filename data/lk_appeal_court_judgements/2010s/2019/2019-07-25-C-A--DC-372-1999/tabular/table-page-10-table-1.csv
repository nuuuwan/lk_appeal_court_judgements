"which proved the case  of termination  of co--ownership  as  asserted by the Defendants."
"Thus  it  is  clear  that  the  Court  failed  to  take  cognizance  of  evidence,  both  oral  and"
"documentary.  This resulted in a failure  to investigate  title that is  mandatorily enjoined"
"upon a District Judge in a partition suit and there has been a failure to take into account"
