"o
f Homagama was informed by 9R5, that P12 could be used as an"
"Advance Tracing for that purpose."
"I  cannot  accept  the  argument  that  P12  made  before  Section  2"
"Notice renders P12 void  ab  initio.  According to section 2(3) of the"
"Land  Acquisition  Act,  after  Section  2  Notice,  the  acquiring  officer"
"may enter the land to be acquired for the purpose of survey.  That"
"does  not  mean  that  no  Tracing  can  be  prepared  before  Section  2"
"Notice."
"According to Regulation 263 as quoted  by the learned counsel for"
"the  Petitioners,  before  taking  over  possession  there  shall  be  an"
"Advance  Tracing  prepared  by  the  Survey  Department.    However,"
"the term “Advance Tracing” has not been defined in the Regulation."
"The  Surveyor General in his affidavit tendered with the statement"
"of objections states that P12 could be used as an Advance Tracing."
"Let  me  now  consider  why  the  Petitioners  state  that  P12  is  not  an"
"Advance Tracing.   The Petitioners state that, according to P12, Lot"
"198 belongs to the 1st Petitioner, Lot 204 to the 2nd Petitioner, Lot"
"196 to the 3rd Petitioner, Lot 207 to the 4th Petitioner and Lot 203"
"to  the  5th  Petitioner  in  this  case.  Lot  205  of  P12  belongs  to  the"
"Petitioner in CA/WRIT/63/2014."
"The  complaint  of  the  Petitioners  is  that  no  detailed  description"
"about those Lots has been given in P12."
"Out  of  these  Lots,  only  the  4th  Petitioner  and  the  2nd  Petitioner  in"
"this case have specific grievances.  The 4th Petitioner’s grievance is"
"that although Lot 207 is depicted as a single Lot, it contains three"
"separate  properties  belonging  to  three  separate  owners,  and  her"
