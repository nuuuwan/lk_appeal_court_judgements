"","28.11.2006.  The  appellant  was  examined  by  a  Judicial  Medical  Officer"
"","prior to  his  production before Court."
"","The  main  thrust  of 
the  appellant's  challenge  on  the  recovery  of"
"","jewellery  items was  pivoted  on the  three fresh injuries  that were noted by"
"","the JMO  who  estimated  that  they  could  have  been caused  to  him  within"
"","three to four days prior to his medical examination which could be  due to"

"","of the items of jewellery is  therefore a result of information extracted from"

is  that the recovery  was"
"","made  under  duress  and 
it  rendered 
that  evidence 
inadmissible  and"
"","unreliable  as  per  the  judgments  of Poulier v  Abeygunawardene41  N.L.R."
