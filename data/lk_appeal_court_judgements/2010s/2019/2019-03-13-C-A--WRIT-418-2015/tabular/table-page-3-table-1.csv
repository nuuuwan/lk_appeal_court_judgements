"c
onstruction,  the  Pradeshiya  Sabha  has  no  objection  to  the"
"construction  after  obtaining 
the 
recommendation 
from 
the"
"Ministry of Religious Affairs."
"It is important to note that P8, which the petitioners heavily rely"
"on, is also of the same date, i.e. 14.11.2014, and signed by the"
"same Chairman.  Simply stated, P6 and P8 have been issued on"
"the 
same  day  by 
the 
same 
officer―the  Chairman 
of 
the"
"Pradeshiya 
Sabha. 
 
Therefore 
those 
two 
documents 
are"
"inseparable and shall be read and understood together."
"This has been suppressed by the petitioners in the petition. This"
"is  a  material  fact,  nay  the  main  fact,  which  goes  to  the  root  of"
"the  matter. 
  Between  P6  and  P8, 
it  appears 
that, 
some"
"unconnected  and  irrelevant  documents  have  been  introduced―I"
"do  not  know  why?1 
  The  petitioners  have  not  acted  with"
"that 
itself  warrants  dismissal 
of 
the 
uberrima 
fides,  and"
"application in limine."
"It 
is  clear  that  after  P6,  the  petitioners  did  not  obtain  the"
"recommendation 
for 
the  construction 
from 
the  Ministry  of"
"Religious  Affairs,  and  it  appears  to  me  that  it  has  not  been"
"obtained up to now."
"It 
is 
this 
recommendation  which  was 
referred 
to  by 
the"
"Chairman  in  P11  dated  05.05.2015.    This  is  made  amply  clear"
"by looking at P12, written by the Chairman on the following day,"
"i.e.  on  06.05.2015, 
to  the  Divisional  Secretary  whereby 
the"
"Chairman informed the Divisional Secretary that he has sent the"
"relevant application to the Divisional Secretary on 04.03.2015 to"
"1 As seen from page 2 of P6, the application has been tendered on"
"24.10.2014. P7 is a document dated 17.02.2014. Also there is no relevancy of"
"the List of Names of the Jehovah’s Witnesses filed before P7."
