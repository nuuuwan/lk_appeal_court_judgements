"the next lay witness called  by the prosecution followed  thereafter by a long"
"line of lay and official wih1esses."
"It is correct that the  most critical  evidence regarding  the complicity"
"of  each  of  the  appellants  were  presented  through  the  witnesses  Pradeep"
"Kumara  and Amarakoon.  111ey  were the  two witnesses who  travelled  in the"
"car  along  with  the 
two  appellants  and  are  therefore  privy  to  what  the"
"appellants discussed and have done during that journey."
"But  similarly 
the  witnesses  Jayaseelan  and  John  Ajith  Shantha  are"
"equally  important witnesses  since  they  were  the  only  lay  witnesses  who"
"are total strangers to  any of the parties and  therefore could be regarded as"
"a  highly  impartial  witnesses.  Jayaseelan  was  the  conductor  of  the  bus  in"
"which  the deceased was shot at. He identified the 2nd  appellant with a  gun"
"in his hand soon after the shooting.  Ajith Shantha  was the employee of the"
"nearby 
tyre shop who also saw the 2nd appellant with a gun."
"although 
treated 
adverse  at 
the 
latter  stage  of  his 
Jayashantha,"
"evidence,  was 
the 
immediate  neighbour  of 
the  deceased. 
He  had"
"knowledge of the several failed  attempts made by the lSI  appellant to reach"
"a  settlement  over 
the  prosecution  founded  upon 
the  complaint  by 
the"
"deceased.  This  witness  was  given  Rs.  40,000.00  by 
the  l
si  appellant  for"
"acting as the go between the two, in the discussions about the settlement."
"This was a  trial without a jury and it had been noted by this Court in"
"many a judgment that unlike the jurors, the Judges who preside over trials"
"have 
sufficient 
judicial 
experience  and  understanding  of 
the 
legal"
"principles  that are  involved  in  determining  the  culpability  of the accused"
"the 
they 
try.  Certainly 
the  prosecution  did  not  attempt  to  corroborate"
