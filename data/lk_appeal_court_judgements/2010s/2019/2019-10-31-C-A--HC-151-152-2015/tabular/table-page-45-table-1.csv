"Except for  the  omnibus suggestion  that  the  witness  is  lying,  there"
"was no  specific suggestion  that  this  item  of  evidence,  that challenged  the"
"of  the 
1st  appellant, 
is  a  fabrication  either  by  the 
validity  of  the  alibi"
"witness himself or by the CID."
"It is  therefore clear from  the available evidence that the shooting had"
"taken 
place 
sometime 
before 
11.30 
a.m. 
that  morning 
since 
that"
"information  had  reached  the  Police  Station  and  conveyed  to 
the  mobile"
"unit  by  11.45  a.m.  There  is  no  entry  regarding  the  time  the  1st  appellant"
"had entered  the Investment Promotion Zone but there is  one indicating he"
"left at 12.45 p.m."
"When  IP  de  Silva  viewed  the  CCTV  footage,  he  noted  that  the  1st"
"appellant had entered the De  la  Rue facility only at 12.31  p.m. and that fact"
"coupled with the evidence of Pradeep  Kumara  that he was instructed to skip"
"the time of shooting in his statement to CID, indicate the status of his alibi."
"According to  the statement made by  the 1st  appellant from  the dock,"
"he  had  visited  a  garage  at  11.30  a.m. 
to  check  on  his  vehicle  and 
then"
"But  he  did  not  offer  any 
visited  De 
la  Rue  checkpoint  at  11.45  a.m."
"explanation 
as  to  the  time  gap 
between  11.45  a.m. 
and  12.31  p.m.  No"
"witness from  the garage  was called  by  the 1st  appellant in support of his"
"alibi.  This is  relevant because the 1s t  appellant stated  he visited  the garage"
"at 11.30.am."
"Even if the 1st  appellant's timing is  accepted, still  he could well be at"
"the murder scene as the trial Court has held."
"This  is  a clear indication  that the  trial  Court had  considered  the alibi"
"of the 1st  appellant in the light of the  three  positions as enumerated by  the"
"45"
