"testimony  of any particular witness in advance by  adopting this particular"
"order  of  calling  witnesses  (vide  the  judgment  of  King  v  Silva  30  N.L.R."
"193).  The  case  for 
the  prosecution  is  purely  based  on  several  items  of"
"circumstantial  evidence  and  as  such, 
it  is  unreasonable 
to 
impose  any"
"restriction to the way in which the case should have presented or the order"
"in which each of the witnesses are  called ."
"The other complaint of the 1st  appellant that witness fayashantha  was"
"reminded  by  the 
learned  prosecutor  of  him  making  a  statement  under"
"Section  127  before 
the  Magistrate  at 
the  very  commencement  of 
the"
"examination in chief itself needed consideration at this stage."
"President's 
Counsel 
commented 
that 
it  was 
very 
Learned"
"unorthodox  to  commence leading of a  witness's evidence by straightaway"
"reminding him of the statement he made to  the Magistrate and continuing"
"on that line eliciting the relevant evidence. It was his submissions that the"
"approach  of  the  prosecutor  is  indicative  of  issuing  a  veiled  threat  to  the"
"witness,  reminding him of the fate of the witness who was treated adverse"
"in  a  very  subtle  way  and  therefore  to  be  consistent with  what he already"
"said  in 
the  Section  127  statement  implicating  the  appellants.  This  is  one"
"possible interpretation one could attribute to  the way in which  the learned"
"prosecutor had commenced examination in chief of this witness."
"then  had  already  given  evidence  once 
The  witness  fayashantha  by"
"before  the  predecessor  of  the  trial  Judge  who  continued  with  the  partly"
"heard  trial.  The witness therefore was  familiar  with the Court atmosphere"
"and  the manner of giving evidence having faced, cross-examination by  the"
"two  Counsel  who  represented  the  appellants  separately 
before  the  trial"
"30"
