"trial  Court itself  by  the  2nd  appellant.  This  ground  is  based  on the factual"
"2nd 
basis 
that 
the  witnesses  who 
identified 
the 
appellant 
at 
an"
"Identification  Parade  held  before 
the  Magistrate's  Court of  Wattala  have"
"covered 
themselves  up 
in  order 
to  conceal 
their 
identities  when 
they"
"inspected  the  parade.  Therefore,  the  2nd  Appellant contended  that  there"
"was  no  opportunity  for  the  learned  Magistrate  to  satisfy  that  the  person"
"who pointed out the 2nd appellant is the witness who was produced before"
"her  prior  to 
the  line-up.  The  2nd  appellant's  claims  that  this  fact  raises  a"
"reasonable  doubt as  to  the  identity  of  the  witnesses who claimed  to  have"
"identified  him at the said Identification parade."
