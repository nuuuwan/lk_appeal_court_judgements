"It  is  seen  from  the  case  record  that  only  the  Plaintiff-"
"Respondents  have  relied  on  a  pedigree 
for 
the  entire  corpus  and"
"devolution  therefrom  on  the  basis  of  that  pedigree,  the  1A  Plaintiff-"
"Respondent had given evidence in support of his case."
"It  is  to  be  noted  in  this  case  that  the  5th  Defendant-"

in  his  examination-in-chief  that"
