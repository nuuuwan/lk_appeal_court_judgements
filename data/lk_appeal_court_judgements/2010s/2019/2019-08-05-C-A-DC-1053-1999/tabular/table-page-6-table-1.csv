"learned trial Judge has  treated as  irrelevant some  matter, which was most relevant  and"
"important for the correct decision of this partition action."
"Since the land sought to be partitioned is only a divided portion out of a larger land of 3"
"acres,  it is  crystal clear the  Plaintiff must prove by  evidence that t he  land sought to  be"
"partitioned became a separate and distinct land by prescriprive possession. There was no"
"evidence to this effect at the trial.  However there is documentary evidence in the report"
"marked  as  Y that  Lot  A2 
in  the  preliminary  plan  X,  is  in  the  possession  of  the  2nd"
"Defendant, who according to the Plaintiff has no rights to the land to be partitioned."
"No  fence  separates Lot  A2  from  Lot  B,  as  disclosed by  the preliminary plan X and the"
"report Y.  It is quite clear that the 2nd  Defendant had been in possession of Lot  A2  along"
"with  Lot  B as  one  land,  and  Lots  Ai  and  A2  have  never  been  separately  possessed"
"together by anyone at any time, so  that, Lots Ai and A2,  which together comprise Lot A,"
"which is the corpus for partition, was never separately possessed by the Plaintiff and the"
"st  Defendant,  who,  according to the  Plaintiff,  are  the  co-owners of Lot  A,  which is  the 
1"
"corpus for partition."
"When  one  considers 
the  recital  in  the  schedule  aforesaid,  one  could  see  that  Laus"
"Casileenu  did  not  have  any  soil  rights  in  the  corpus  to  be  partitioned.  The  words"
"""exclusive of"" must be given its dictionary meaning and it would mean 'not including of"
"someone  or  something'.  The  Random  House Dictionary defines  ""exclusive of""  to  mean"
"excluding from consideration or account."
"So  when the schedule  recites ""exclusive  of soil rights"",  it goes  without saying that soil"
