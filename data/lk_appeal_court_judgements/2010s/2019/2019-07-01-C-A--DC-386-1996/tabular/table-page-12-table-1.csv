"It was  revealed that there is  a Partition action bearing  No.126/P filed"
"by one D.B.  Dobepola to partition a 100 Acres land which is comprised"
"the  subject  matter  of  the  said 
testamentary  action,  878T. 
The"
"Intervenient-Petitioner- Respondent  and 
the  2nd  Respondent  are"
"parties  to  that  action  as  25th  and  pt  Defendants  respectively.  The"
"Appellant  in  this  Appeal  has  not  been  made  a  party  to  the  same,"
"presume 
that  he  has  no  valid 
title  to  the  subject  matter  of  the"
"testamentary  action.  The  substitute/Intervenient-Petitioner  further"
"states  that  on  28th  July  2018, 
Intervenient-Petitioner- Respondent"
"made an  application to this Court to be  intervened as  a party to this"
"appeal and it was allowed."
"Thereafter  the  Intervenient-Petitioner- Respondent  had  transferred"
"his rights and title of the land and  premises to the Petitioner by Deed"
"of  Transfer  No.2160  dated  3pt  March  2015,  attested  by  Sisira"
"Ranatunga,  Notary Public for a valuable  consideration  while pending"
"this appeal."
"It is my view that the Petitioner's application to be  intervened and  be"
"substituted 
is  not  allowed,  grave  prejudice  will  be  caused 
to  the"
"Petitioner  since  his  rights  are  not  represented  in  this  Court  as  the"
"Intervenient-Petitioner- Respondent  has  withdrawn  and  as  he  is  not"
"pursuing with the matter."
"As 
it 
was 
argued 
by 
the 
substitute/lntervenient-Petitioner"
"Respondent 
that  the  2nd  Respondent  has  been  absconding 
from"
"Courts  and  Intervenient-Petitioner- Respondent  has  also  withdrawn"
"his appearance, there is no one to protect his interest to the land that"
"he  has  bought for a valuable consideration, which  is  a portion of the"
"subject matter of the instant application."
