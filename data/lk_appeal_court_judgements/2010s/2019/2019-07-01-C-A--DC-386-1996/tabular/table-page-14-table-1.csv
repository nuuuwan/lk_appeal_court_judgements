"The 3rd  Intervenient - Respondent - Petitioner namely, Lalith Prabash"
"Hapangama became the Lawful owner of the property in question on"
"Deed  No.31, dated 01-06-2015."
"Therefore, it is obvious that the abovementioned Petitioners who are"
"seeking to intervene  in  this Appeal  could  not become  a party to the"
"original Testamentary Action in the District Court.  This Court is of the"
"opinion that if these Applications to intervene are not allowed, grave"
"prejudice will be caused to the Intervenient Petitioners."
"It was decided in Harold Fernando vs  Fonseka and others 1998 (3) SLR"
"301 
in  a  Testamentary  case,  delay  cannot  defeat  the  claim  of the"
"Intervenient - Respondent - Petitioner to intervene in the action."
"There  would  be  no  delay  as  this Appeal  will  be  decided  on  merit,  in"
"the near future with all the necessary parties."
"In  the event of this Court is  determined to set aside the Judgment of"
"the  District  Court  of Avissawella  dated  14th  June  1996,  intervenient"
"parties  would  be  prevented  from  enjoying  their  lands,  which  were"
"bought for a valuable consideration as  bonafide purchasers."
"In 
the 
light  of  the  aforesaid  circumstances 
it  is  clear  that  all 
the"
"intervene Petitioners being bonafide purchasers of the premises, they"
"have  a  right  to  be  substituted  or  intervened 
in 
this  appeal.  The"
"intervene Petitioners are having clear title to the part of the corpus of"
"this appeal.  If those applications are  not allowed grave prejudice will"
"to  them.  The  Objections  of  the  Petitioner- Appellant 
be  caused"
"Respondent is rejected. Therefore, we allow the applications made by"
"all the intervenient Petitioners to be Intervened."
