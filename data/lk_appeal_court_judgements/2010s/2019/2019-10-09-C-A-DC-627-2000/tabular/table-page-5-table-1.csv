"Thereafter,  on  08.07.1991,  an  application was  made  by way of a petition by  Cornel  &  Company"
"Limited  (a  creditor of the Sun  Cornel  Textiles  Limited)  praying for an  order declaring the sale  of"
"the property in  dispute by the People's Bank to the Respondent  as  ineffective and  null  and  void"
"and to place the said  property in  the custody of th e liquidator."
"In Subramaniam Chetty v.  Soysa (25 N.L.R.  344) the Supreme Court held that an  application made"
"to a court in the course of,  and  incidental to, an  action in summary procedure is,  regarded by the"
"code as  itself being an  action."
"In this context I note that the Companies Act No.  17 of 1982 did not set out the procedure wh ich"
"needs to be followed when making an  incidental application in  winding up  proceedings. The only"
"requirement is that the application  must be  made by way of petition."
"The  question to be  considered  here  is  whether the said  application  constitutes a regular  action"
"upon a consideration of sections 5,  6,  7 and 8 of th e Civil  Procedure Code."
