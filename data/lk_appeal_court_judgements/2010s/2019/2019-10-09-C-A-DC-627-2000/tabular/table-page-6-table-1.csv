"However, the learned  President's Counsel for the Respondent subm itted that regular procedure"
"applies even  where a law does not provide for any other procedure.  He  relied  on  the decision in"

R.K.  Obeyesekere  and  Others 
[S.C. 
(CHC)  Appeal  21-23/2009;  S.C.M."
"21.03.2011]  where JAN. De Silva  c.J.  held (at page 6):"
"""It was  then  submitted that the  procedure found  in  section  520 of the Companies Act  7"
"of 2007 did not fall into either category and therefore the procedure laid down in the Civil"
"Procedure Code sho uld  not apply in  respect of disputes arising out of the Companies Act."
"Section  8  which  was  inserted  into the  Civil  Procedure  Code  as  an  amendment  in  1980"
"states 
that  unless  specifically  provided,  proceedings  should  be  by  way  of  ""regular"""
"procedure."
"The Civil Procedure Code itself, despite the wording in section 7 paves the way for another"
"type of proceedings i.e. found in chapter VIII to be followed in respect of liquid claims. The"

"Yet  unless  the  operation  and  the  application  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code 
is  expressly"
"prevented,  I am  of the opinion that the regular procedure of the civil  procedure must be"
"applied  in  terms of sect ion 8."

"action  shall  commence  and  proceed  by  a  course  of  regular  procedure,  as"
"hereinafter prescribed."
"In  other words, section  8 of the  Civil  Procedure Code  shou ld  be  understood  as  providing"
