"The learned President's Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Respondents (Respondents) countered that this"
"issue was determined by the learned  District Judge when admitting the document marked P3  on"
"23.07.1997  by  interpreting section  25(1)  of the  Wakfs  Act  in  a  permissive  manner and  not  as"
"mandatory.  Accordingly,  he  contended  that the Appellants  cannot  now raise  this  issue  as  they"
"failed to challenge the order dated 23.07.1997."
"The  question then is  whether the Appellants should  have  challenged  the impugned order when"
"it was  made or could have waited, as they appear to have done in this case,  to challenge it in the"
"final appeal."
"An  interlocutory appeal shou ld  be  rejected  as  premature only in  cases,  where the  matter could"
"more expeditiously be  dealt with in  a final  appeal  [Girantha  et al v.  Maria et al (50  N.loR.  519)]."
"However,  if the  incidental  order goes  to the  root of the  matter it is  both  convenient and  in the"
"interests of both  parties that the correctness of the order be tested at the earliest possible stage"
"[Anushka  Wethasinghe  v.  Nimal Weerakkody and Others (1981) 2 Sri.loR. 423]."
"The  alleged failure to comply with section  25(1)  ofthe Wakfs Act in  my view goes to the root of"
"the case  and  as  such  the Appellants should  have challenged  the order dated  23.07.1997  rather"
