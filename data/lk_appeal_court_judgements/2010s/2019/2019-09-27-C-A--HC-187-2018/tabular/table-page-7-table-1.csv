"knew  that she was  out of  the  house.  No  outsider  had  witnessed  that she"
"was with the accused-appellant that night.  Hence,  she was not under any"
"compulsion  to  disclose 
the  identity  of  the  person  with  whom  she  had"
"consensual 
sexual 
relations, 
in 
the  absence  of 
any  witnesses  or  an"
"allegation of wrong doing."
"This  Court  therefore  is  of  the  view  that  the  trial  Court had  rightly"
"concluded  that  the  sexual  act is  not a  consensual  one.  This  determination"
"on  a  question  of  fact  by  a  trial  Court  is  well  supported  by  the  evidence"
"presented by the prosecution."
"It  has  been  consistently  held  by 
this  Court  that, 
in  proof  of  an"
"allegation  of 
rape, 
the 
rule  of  prudence 
that 
there  should  be 
some"
"corroboration,  is  not  an  absolute  one.  The  authority  relied  upon  by  the"
"itself  is 
accused-appellant,  Ajith  v  AttorneJ}  General  (2009)  1  Sri  L.R.  23"
"indicative  of  this  view.  Unlike  in  that  particular  instance,  in  the  instant"
"appeal, Nirosha's  evidence does not contradict the medical observations. In"
"the  contrary,  it supports  her  claim  that she sustained  an  injury when she"
"was held against the unplastered brick column."
"Thirdly  the contention by the accused-appellant that the  trial  Court"
"had  erroneouly  applied  Ellenboro ugh  principle,  should  be  examined.  It"
"must be observed that the trial Court had considered the unacceptability of"
"the position  taken up by  the appellant and  therefore  has  held  that he  did"
"not offer  a  valid  explanation  to  the  allegation  of grave sexual  abuse.  The"
"legality  of  the  applicability  of  Ellenborough  dictum  by  the  trial  Court  is"
"questionable 
in  relation 
to 
the  instant  appeal.  However, 
that  had  not"
"caused any prejudice to  his  right to  a  fair  trial  or had occasioned  a failure"
