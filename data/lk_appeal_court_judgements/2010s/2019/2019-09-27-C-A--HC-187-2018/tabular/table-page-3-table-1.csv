"The  prosecution  case 
is 
entirely  based  on 
the  evidence  of 
the"
"prosecutrix's  version  of  events  and, 
to  a 
limited  extent,  on  the  medical"
"evidence in relation to  the abrasions noted on her elbow. It is her evidence"
"that  she 
is  a  mother  of  a  9-year-old  physically  challenged  girl  child."
"Nirosha's  husband  had  left  her  in  2010  and  since  then  she  lived  with  her"
"grandmother.  The 
land  on  which 
they 
lived  had  no 
fence  and  was"
"surrounded  by  shrubs.  Closest 
to 
her  house  was 
the  house  of  one"
"Premadasa,  but it  was  abandoned  for  some  time.  There  was  no  electricity"
"and usually they went to  sleep by 7.30 p .m."
