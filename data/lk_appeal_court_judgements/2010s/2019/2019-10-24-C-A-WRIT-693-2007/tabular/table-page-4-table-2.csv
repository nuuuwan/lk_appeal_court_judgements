"Provided always that coin, bullion, cattle, and other livestock, and passengers with their"
"baggage, may be landed previous to report, entry or sufferance."
"Admittedly, 
the  Petitioner  was  not  summoned 
for 
the  Customs"
"inquiry, as it is the position of the Respondent that, proved violation"
"of  section  27  of  the  Customs  Ordinance  results  in  forfeiture  of  the"
"goods by operation of law.  Vide Bhambra v. Director General of Customs"
"[2002] 3 Sri LR 401."
"This  position  is  disputed  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner  on  two  main  grounds: (a) section 27  is inapplicable in the"
"facts  of 
this  case,  and 
(b)  forfeiture 
is  not  automatic,  but  shall"
"necessarily be after a hearing."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  admits  that  “whether  section  27  was"
"applicable is a matter that must be determined at the inquiry.  The Respondents"
"cannot  invoke  section  27  before  deciding  whether  section  27  applies.    Before"
"deciding whether section 27 applies the Petitioner must be given a hearing.”2  That"
"means,  the  applicability  or  inapplicability  of  section  27  is  not  a  pure"
"question of law, but a mixed question of fact and law, and therefore,"
"such disputed matters cannot be decided in this writ application."
