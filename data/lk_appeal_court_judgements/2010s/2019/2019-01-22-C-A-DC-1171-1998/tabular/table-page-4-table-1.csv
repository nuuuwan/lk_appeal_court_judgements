efendant  through  the  plaintiff  as  V2.2 
  The  Final  Partition"
"Decree has been marked as V3. This itself shows the mala fides"
"of  the  plaintiff  and  the  untrustworthiness  of  the  plaintiff  as  a"
"witness."
"The  plaintiff’s  position  was,  as 
I  stated  earlier,  that  Arnolis"
"Perera,  his  grandfather,  was  the  original  owner  of  Lot  A,  and"
"upon  his  death,  rights  devolved  on  the  two  children,  and  then"
"they  gifted  it  to  him  by  Deed  P1.    In  Deed  P1  the  donors  state"
"that  they  acquired  title  to  the  land  by  prescription.    As  I  also"
"said  earlier,  the  plaintiff  filed  this  action  less  than  1  ½  years"
"after the execution of that Deed.  Therefore, if he is to succeed in"
"this  action,  he  should  have  proved  prescriptive 
title  of 
the"
"donors.  But the plaintiff did not call either of the donors to give"
"evidence."
"A person who claims prescriptive title against the rightful owner"
"who has the paper title has a very heavy burden to prove all the"
"requirements 
prescribed 
in 
section 
3 
of 
the 
Prescription"
"Ordinance.    Mere  possession  over  ten  years  is  not  prescriptive"
"possession. 
  The  possession  shall  be  by  title  adverse  to  or"
"independent of that of the rightful owner.  The plaintiff knew the"
"rightful owner."
"The  plaintiff  does  not  say  from  when  his  predecessors  started"
"prescriptive  possession  against  the  defendant’s  father  who  was"
"admittedly the owner of the disputed Lot A by a Partition Decree."
"This  is  crucial  if  the  defendant  is  to  succeed  on  prescription."
