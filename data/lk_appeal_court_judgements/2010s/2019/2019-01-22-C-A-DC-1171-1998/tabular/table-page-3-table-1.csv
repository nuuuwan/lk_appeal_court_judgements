"and  upon  his  death,  his 
rights  devolved  on  his 
children"
"including  the  defendant,  and  thereafter  all  of  them  gifted  their"
"rights 
by  Deed 
V12 
dated 
14.11.1989 
to  Godvin  Dias"
"Abeygunawardena,  one  of 
the  aforementioned  children,  and"
"therefore the said Godvin Dias Abeygunawardena is a necessary"
"party to this action."
"Despite  this  revelation,  the  plaintiff  did  not  think  it  fit  to  make"
"Godvin Dias Abeygunawardena a party defendant, which, in my"
"view,  goes  to  the  root  of  the  plaintiff’s  case.    At  least,  by  that"
"time,  the  plaintiff  would  have  realized  that  he  has 
filed  the"
"action  against  a  wrong  party,  or,

"The learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant during the course"
"of argument stated that the defendant could have  made Godvin"
"Dias Abeygunawardena a party to the action.   There is no such"
"burden  or  necessity  on  the  part  of  the  defendant.    The  plaintiff"

"Although  the  plaintiff  during  the  course  of  cross  examination"
"admitted his knowledge about the said  partition action and the"
"fact  that  the  defendant’s  father  was  allotted  Lot  A  by  the  Final"
"Partition  Decree1,  he  never  presented  his  case  either 
in  the"
"plaint  or  in  his  evidence  in  chief  in  that  manner.    Further,"
"although  he  did  not  identify  the  land  in  suit  by  way  of  a  Plan,"
"during  the  course  of  cross  examination  he  admitted  that  the"
"Final  Partition  Plan  was  with  him,  which  was  marked  by  the"
