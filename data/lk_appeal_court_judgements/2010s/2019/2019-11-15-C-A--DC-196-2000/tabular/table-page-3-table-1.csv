"At  the  argument  before  this  Court,  the  learned  counsel  for  the"
"appellant  candidly  admitted  that  the  appellant  failed  to  prove"
"the allegation of forgery, and therefore the impugned order of the"
"learned  District  Judge  can  stand  and 
the  appeal  can  be"
"dismissed."
"However,  the  learned  counsel  further  submitted  that,  once  the"
"appeal is so dismissed, the petitioner, who is the sole beneficiary"
"of 
the  Last  Will,  shall  confine  his  claim 
to 
the  properties"
"described in the schedule to his original petition tendered to the"
"District  Court,  which  the 
learned  counsel  described  as  “the"
"inventory”.1"
"It  is  the  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  that  the  petitioner"
"cannot  deal  with  the  properties  of  his  father  who  predeceased"
"the  mother 
(the 
testator 
in 
this  case)  until 
the  petitioner"
"produces the Probate in respect of the father’s Last Will."
"As the learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner submitted,"
"this is not the proper forum to canvass that matter."
"This  appeal  is  against  the  order  of  the  District  Court  whereby"
"the  Last  Will  was  declared  proved  and  Probate  issued  to  the"
"petitioner.  If the appellant now decides not to challenge the said"
"order, appeal shall be dismissed, and the matter shall end there."
"What is described in the schedule to the  original petition is not"
"“the  inventory”.    The  inventory  is  required  in  law  to  be  filed"
"subsequent 
to 
the 
issuance  of 
the  Probate,  which  has  not"
"happened  in  this  case  yet,  notwithstanding  the  order  has  been"
