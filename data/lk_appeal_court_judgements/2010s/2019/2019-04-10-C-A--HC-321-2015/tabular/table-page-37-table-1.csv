"","It is  our view  that the  rejection  of the  Appellant's evidence as false"
"","by the trial Court is justified. In doing so it has considered them under the"
"","accepted  tests  on credibility."
"","The  fact  in issue  before  the  trial  Court was  whether  the  Appellant"
"","consciously and exclusively possessed  7.05  grams of heroin on 04.12.2008"
"","at Mt.  Lavinia."
"","The  Appellant, in his  evidence claimed that his  arrest did  not take"
"","place  at the  place  where  the  prosecution  alleged,  but  at  a  point several"
"","meters  up  in  the  College  Avenue  near  the  taxi  park.  In  relation  to 
the"
"","detection,  his  position 
is  he  did  not  possess  any  heroin,  and 
it  was"
"","introduced to him at the PNB by Rangajeewa, who retrieved a parcel from a"
"","roof  top  of a  house  in  Badowita.  He further  elaborated  that when he  was"
"","kept in front of that house one of his aunts had given him a bottle of water"
"","to  drink.  He  further  claimed  that  the  2nd  Accused,  having  already  been"
"","arrested  by PNB  Officers,  was 
there  in the van when he  was  put into  it"
"","after his arrest near the taxi park."
"","It is strange that the Appellant did not put any of these positions he"

"","by Rangajeewa and the arrest of the 2nd Accused  when the learned defence"
"","Counsel 
cross  examined 
This 
evidence  is 
Ranjeewa  and  Wijesinghe."
