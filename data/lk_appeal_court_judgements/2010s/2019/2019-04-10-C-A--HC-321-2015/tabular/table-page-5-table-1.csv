"Upon seeing the motorcyclist,  Rangajeewa  instructed his  driver to  turn the"
"vehicle  from  the  intersection  to  its  right,  and  proceeded  along  the  other"
"part of  the College  Avenue,  that leads  up to  the  sea shore.  They stopped"
"the  vehicle  about 50  meters  away from  that intersection.  Rangajeewa  then"
"got  off  from 
the  vehicle  and  walked  towards  the  intersection  with  51"
"Wijesinghe.  They  have  positioned  themselves  in a  way  they  could  have a"
"clear view of the motorcyclist.  A little later, Rangajeewa saw the Appellant,"
"whose  identity  was  known  to  him  due  to  the  latter's  detention  at  PNB"
"some 
time  back,  coming  down  College  Avenue,  whilst  engaged 
in  a"
"telephone call on his hand phone."
"The  motorcyclist then started  the  engine  of his  motorcycle  and  the"
"Appellant had walked up to him. The motorcyclist had taken out a  parcel"
"from his back pack. The parcel which could be kept in the clenched fist of a"
"person was then given to the Appellant. The Appellant was intercepted by"
"then 
Rangajeewa,  when  he  was  about  to  wear  the  helmet.  51  Wijesinghe"
"helped out the motorcyclist who had toppled over with his motor cycle."
"When Rangajeewa  took the parcel from the Appellant's hand, he saw"
"a  light  blue  cellophane  bag  inside  of  it.  Its  top  was  tied  into  a  knot.  To"
"examine its contents, Rangajeewa had to untie its knot. The parcel had some"
"brown coloured powder as its contents, and upon smelling and inspection"
"of the substance, Rangajeewa  suspected it to be heroin with his experience."
"He put the parcel into his left trouser pocket."
"He  had 
then  arrested 
the  Appellant  and 
the  motorcyclist 
for"
"possession of and trafficking in heroin at about 10.50 a.m."
