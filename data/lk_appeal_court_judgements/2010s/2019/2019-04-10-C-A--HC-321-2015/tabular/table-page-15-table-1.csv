"there was no reference to a Court case to which the Appellant was named"
"as a suspect, and it  was due to be called on that day."
"In  making  the  submissions  in  support of  this  point,  the  Appellant"
"relied  on the inference  that Rangajeewa,  being an  officer  attached  to  PNB,"
"should have known that the case against the  Appellant was filed  by PNB"
"was to have called on that day."
"This contention needed to be considered against the backdrop of the"
"relevant evidence to this point that had been placed before the trial Court."
"the  information provided  by 
Rangajeewa,  in planning the  detection upon"
"his  private  informant,  was  anticipating  a  situation  where  the  Appellant"
"along with several others would engage in packeting of heroin at a place in"
"Maharagama  and at the time  of receiving information,  the  Appellant was"
"seen near Attidiya culvert."
"two  of  his  subsequent  calls,  has  shifted 
the 
The 
informant,  by"
"location  of  the  Appellant  to  Mt.  Lavinia  Courts.  This  change  of  location"
"took  place  only  after  the  police  party  left  their  office.  Nowhere  in  the"
"evidence has a reference been made that the Appellant had a Court case to"
"attend.  There is  no  evidence  that the  Appellant was produced before  the"
"Mt.  Lavinia  Court by Rangajeewa  or any of his  team mates at any point of"
"time."
"It  would  certainly  be  categorised 
as  mere  conjecture  if the  trial"
"Court  was  to  consider  any  possibility  that  has  no  evidentiary  support"
"either  in favour  of  the  prosecution  or  the  defence.  Hence,  the contention"
"advanced by the Appellant is not sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in"
"the prosecution case."
