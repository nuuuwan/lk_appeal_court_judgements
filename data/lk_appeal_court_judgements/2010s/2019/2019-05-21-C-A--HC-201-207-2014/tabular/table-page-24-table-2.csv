"minutes  since  the  sound  of  firecrackers  ceased.  If the  defence  witness's"
"estimation of  time  of ten minutes  is  correct,  then Prasad  had not reached"
"the  body of his father for  more than ten minutes.  Prasad  claimed  that he"
"saw the shooting of his father from a distance about 20 meters. It is highly"
"improbable  that he  would  take  more  than  ten  minutes  to  reach  a  place"
"only 20  meters away where his father  was lying after being shot at.  This"
"factor  alone  renders  his  claim  of  witnessing  the  incident  of  shooting,"
"which resulted in the death of his father, highly unreliable."
