"in implicating the Appellants.  The trial Court is clearly entitled to corne to"

"consistent  with  his  evidence  at  the 
trial  Court  in  the  absence  of  any"
"contradiction  or  omission  marked  by  the  Appellants  on  material  points,"
"when  they  in fact  have  highlighted  the  fact  that he  gave  evidence  at the"
"inquest  during 
their  cross  examination  of  the  witness  on  other  trivial"
"matters."
