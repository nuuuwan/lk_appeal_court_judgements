"The contention of the learned President's Counsel that the evidence"
"of the solitary eye witness  Prasad  does not satisfy the  test of  spontaneity"
"therefore fails."
"Whether  there  were  threats  to  his  life  and  whether  it was  due  to"
"those threats he shifted residence becomes insignificant factor in favour of"
"the Appellants in this  setting.  But Prasad's  conduct is  consistent with the"
"inference  that his  implication of the  Appellants  at the  inquest may have"
"justified entertaining such an apprehension by him  and his  mother.  The"

"Learned President's Counsel's submission based on the evidence of"
"the police officer who stated that they were looking for an eye witness to"
"the  incident  but found  none  until  Prasad  made  a  belated  statement too"
"loses its impact in the light of the above finding since it is  clearly a wrong"

the 
investigating  officer  without  having  a"
"complete appraisal of the material available at that point of time."
"Learned  President' s  Counsel invited  our attention  to  the  omission"
"marked  off 
to  mention  in  her 
the  evidence  of  Dilrukshi  in  her  failure"
"statement to Police that her son, Prasad, had run after the Appellants who"
"were  chasing  behind  her  husband.  Here 
too,  no  such  omission  was"
"marked  off  her  evidence  at  the  inquest.  In these  circumstances,  the  said"
"omission  assumes 
lesser  significance 
in  assessing 
the  weight  of
