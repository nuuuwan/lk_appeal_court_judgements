"Appellants,  the  learned  President's  Counsel  submitted  that  there  was  no"
"acceptable  reason  attributed  by  the 
trial  Court  in  totally  rejecting 
the"
"evidence  of  the  only  defence  witness  Bindu  Kumara  de  Silva.  It was  also"
"contended  that the evidence of the said  witness  satisfies  all the  tests  that"
"are employed in evaluating credibility of witnesses  and therefore the trial"
"Court was clearly  in error in rejecting  the same and  thereby  denying  the"
"benefit of any 
reasonable doubt 
that  might have arisen in favour  of the"
"Appellants in respect of the credibility of the purported eye witness of the"
"prosecution."
