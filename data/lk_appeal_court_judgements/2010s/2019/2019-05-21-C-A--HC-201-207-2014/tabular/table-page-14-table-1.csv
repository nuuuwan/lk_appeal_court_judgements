"months  after  the  incident,  in order to  determine  the  reason attributed for"
"such  delay  is  acceptable  to  it  or  not.  The  witness  himself  admits  that  he"
"made  a  detailed  statement  after  about  three  months,  in  addition  to  the"
"short statement he made when he identified the dead body prior to its post"
"mortem examination. The reason attributed by the witness for his delay is"
"that,  having participated  in  the  7th  day  almsgiving  of  his  dead  father,  he"
"took  shelter in one  of  his  relative's  house  at Mahawa  since  he felt  his  life"
"would be threatened if he was to remain in Pinwatta area thereafter."
