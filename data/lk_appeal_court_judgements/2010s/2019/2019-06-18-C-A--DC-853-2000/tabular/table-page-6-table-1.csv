"This then also negates the prescriptive title that the Appellant sought to establish. Where a party"
"invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership"
"of an  adverse claimant to immovable property, the  burden  of proof rests  squarely and  fairly on"
"[Chelliah  v. 
him  to  establish  a  starting  point  for  his  or  her  acquisition  of  prescriptive  rights"
"Wijenathan  {54 N.L.R.  337 at 342}]."
"In  any event once it is  accepted that P3  is  part of the evidence  before court, the Appellant then"
"has to establish the required ingredients for prescriptive title after 1970. As  regards the mode of"
"proof  of  prescriptive  possession,  mere  general  statements  of  witnesses 
that 
the  plaintiff"
"possessed  the  land  in  dispute for a number of years  exceeding the  prescriptive  period  are  not"
"evidence  of 
the  uninterrupted  and  adverse  possession 
necessary 
to  support  a 
title  by"
"prescription.  It is  necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of"
"possession  has  to be  decided thereupon  by Court  [Sirajudeen  and two Others  v.  Abbas {1994}  2"
"SrLL.R.  365]. The  Appellant has  marked in  evidence three receipts as V1 to V3  indicating that he"
"had  paid  assessment  rates.  V1  is  dated  1965  while  V2  and  V3  are  dated  1990  and  1991.  The"
"evidence in this case falls far short of establishing any prescriptive title on the Appellant."
"For  all  the  foregoing  reasons, 
I  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  judgment  of the  learned"
"Additional District Judge of Galle dated 22.09.2000."
"Appeal  is  dismissed with costs."
