"The  learned  High  Court Judge  held that the Appellants  have failed to adduce  any evidence of a"
"resolution been passed and approved by the Minister and  published in the Gazette and therefore"
"did not have the power to call  upon the Respondent to pay entertainment tax for the GLF  2010."
"However, the learned High Court Judge has disregarded the fact that the Respondent had sought"
"and  obtained  an  exemption  from  entertainment tax as  pleaded  in  paragraph  9  of the  petition"
"filed  in  the  High  Court and  reflected  in  document marked  XB . The  letter marked  XB  states  that"
"permission  had  been  granted to release the tickets of the GLF  to be  held from  29 to 31 January"
"from  tax. Such  an  exemption  or release  can  only  be  granted  if in  the first instance such  tickets"
"were liable for the entertainment tax as if it was not there is no question of release or exemption."
