"been  considered  as  a tec hnical  qualification for recruitment to the said  service."
"The  position  of the  Respondents  in 
this  regard 
is 
that  the  posts  held  by  the"
"Petitio ners were  not  absorbed  into  the  Sri  Lanka  Tec hnological  Service  at  the"
"in  1999  by 
'PH'  as 
they  were  not 
tim e  th e  said  Service  was  established"
"qua lifi ed  in 
term s  of  'PH',  even 
though  certa in  other  posts  such  as  Works"
"Inspector,  Assistant  Works  Inspector and  Draughtsman  under the  Department"
"of Prisons  were absorbed  to the sa id  serv ice.  Once  again,  this Court must state"
"that  it  does  not have the expertise to decide  if the  qualifications  possessed  by"
"the  Petitioners are  similar or identical to the qualifications required from those"
"wh o  ente r  the  Sri  La nka  Technological  Service. 
In  these  circumstances,  this"
"Court can not agree  with the submission of the Petitioners."
"The 
fin al  argument  advanced  by 
the 
learned  President's  Counsel 
for 
the"
"Petitioners is  that  in  terms  of 'pg',  drivers  in  the  Department  of  Prisons  who"
"have lesser entry req uirements than  the Petitioners are drawing a salary which"
"is  higher 
than 
the  Petitioners' 
sa lary,  and 
that 
for 
that 
reason 
too, 
the"
"clas sification  of the  Petitioners  under  MN-1-2006  is  unreasonable. This  Court"
"must  observe  that  in  terms  of  'P8',  drivers  are  classified  under  category  PL-"
"1/2/ 3 and that the st arting salary  under each  of the said  categories is  less than"
"the  starting  sa lary  of MN-1-2006.  However,  with  th e  salary  increments  that a"
"driver  is  entitled  to  ea rn,  there  can  be  drivers who  draw  a salary  higher than"
"wh at an  Agricultural  Overseer who  has just joined  th e se rvice  would  earn. Thi s"
"cannot be  term ed  unreasonab le.  The  Respondents  have  infact pointed out that"
"th e  refere nce  made  by  the  Petition ers to  a  driver  placed  on  step  22  of PL-3-"
"2006  drawing  a  salary  higher  than 
the  Peti tion ers 
is  a  reference 
to  a .heavy"
"veh icle  drive r  in  Class  l. The  Respondent s have  stated  further  that  even  prior"
"to 
'P8',  heavy  vehi cle  drivers 
in  Class  1  were  drawing  a  sa lary  hig her  than"
