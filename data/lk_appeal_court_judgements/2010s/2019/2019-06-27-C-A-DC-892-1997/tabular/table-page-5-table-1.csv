"action instituted will be time bared. As  the plaint say; in paragraph 7 that it was to be"
"from 31.12.1982 according to 
paid off within a year, then that time will begin to run from"
"the  judgment  given  by  the,  then  learned  District Judge  of  Mahawa.  The  Plaintiff  had"
"instituted the action in th~ year 1992.  This  clearly shows that the action is  out of time"
"going  by  the  Section  10  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance.  Further  the  possession  was"
"continuing  on  the  part  c;f  the  Plaintiff under  the  lease  agreement  No.3472.  Therefore"
"Defendant  has  a  right  to  rely  upon  the  law of prescription despite  of  the  explanation"
"given in the impugned judgment."
"Section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance makes mortgage debt or bond prescribed in 10"
"years  and Section 6  mak~~, any  action invalid on any::::ontract  bargain or agreement  or"
"other  written  security  other  than  the  instruments  b:i  Section  5  (i.e.,  mortgage  debt  or"
"bond) unless such action is brought within 6 years from  the date of the breach of such"
"partnership  deed  or  such  written  promise  contract  bargain  or  agreement"" or  other"
"written security.  Section 7 also  brings  the  documents  in the  same  ambit  and they get"
"prescribed in 6 years.  Therefore even if it is  accepted by the learned District Judge that"
"the Deed No.3471  is  a mOl'tgage  bond, the cause of action is  prescribed within 10  years."
"Even if it is any other wrilVn agreement the Plaintiff needs to reach courts in 6 years. She"
"~las taken  more  than 10  years  to  institute  action.  This  clearly  proves 
the  time  bar  to"
"institute such legal action."
"Further, the action instituted Case  No.1899/L  by the Defendant of this case, who is  the"
"Plaintiff of that case, had submitted facts  so  as  to state that the PlaintifrRespondent is"
"an over holding lessee. Thereby the case is decided in favour of the Defendant of this case"
"i.e., the Plaintiff of the 1899(L case."
"On the point of prescription raised by the Defendant with respect to the plaintif~'s case is"
"clear that the Plaintiff knew very well of the Deed 34381 executed on 31.12.1981.  The case"
"was filed on 26.06.1992.  Section 10  of the Prescription Ordinance states that in order to"
"declare a Deed null and void such action should be filed within three years from the date"
