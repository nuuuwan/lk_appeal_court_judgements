that  the 
learned  State  Counsel  has  correctly  conveyed 
to  the"
"parties represented by her, the undertaking given by her to this Court."
"The  Petitioner  has  not  sought 
to 
intervene 
in  CA 
(Writ)  Application  No."
"53/2017.  Instead, the Petitioner filed this Contempt of Court application over a"
"year later on  18th  July  2018  against the same  persons  who  were  Respondents"
"in  CA  (Writ) Application  No.  177/2010. As  observed  earlier,  it is  the  complaint"
"of the  Petitioner that the Respondents  have failed  to implement the judgment"
"of this  Court  in  CA 
(Writ)  Application  No.  177/2010  and  that  the  failure  to"

the  position  of  the  Petitioner  that  as  a  result  of  the  aforementioned

undertaking  given 
by 
the"

"has  arisen  as  a  result  of  the  said  undertaking  given  by 
the 
learned  State"

the  basis  of  the  Petitioner's  application  to  add 
the  learned 
Counsel.  This"
"Senior State Counse l as  a Respondent."

that 
this  Court

"Petitioner has  been  able  to  satisfy  this  Court,  on  a  prima  facie  basis,  that the"
"learned  Senior State  Counsel  acted  in  willful  or contumacious  disobedience  of"
"the judgment of this Court, when she gave an  undertaking to this Court, and  by"
"the issuing of the letter marked 'X17'."
