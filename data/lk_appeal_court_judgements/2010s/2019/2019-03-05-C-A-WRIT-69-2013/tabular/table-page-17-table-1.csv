"When  'P16' is  considered in  the light of the above judgment and the provisions"
"of the  Constitution,  it is  clear that the  Provincial  Land  Commissioner does  not"
"have  the  power to approve the  alienation  of State  Land  as  sought to be  done"
"by 'P16'. Furthermore, to hold that the Land  Commissioner General and  HE the"
"by 
the 
approval 
given 
by 
the 
Provincial 
Land 
President 
are 
bound"
"Commissioner would be contrary to law. Thus, this Court is of the view that the"
"Provincial  Land  Commissioner  who  issued 
'P16'  did  not  have  the  power  to"
"issue  the  said 
letter and  therefore,  this  Court,  following  the judgment  of the"
"Supreme  Court  in  Nimalsiri's  case 
concludes  that an 
illegality  cannot  be  the"
"basis for a legitimate expectation."
