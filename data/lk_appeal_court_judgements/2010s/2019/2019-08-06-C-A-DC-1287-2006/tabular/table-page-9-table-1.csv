"new  folio  but  connected  to  10D8  under  the  name  of  the  land"
"Rukattane  Koratuwa  alias  Weliyage  Watta.    That  new  folio  has"
"been  marked  as  10D9.    That  goes  to  show  that  the  Plaintiff  has"
"introduced  the  name  Weliyage  Watta  to  Rukattane  Koratuwa  for"
"the first time in the plaint of this case and it is on that basis a new"
"folio was opened in the Land Registry under the name of Rukattane"
"Koratuwa  alias  Weliyage  Watta 
to

"instant  case  as  to  the  identification  of  the  land  to  be  partitioned,"
"which is Rukattane Koratuwa (alias Weliyage Watta)."

"importance. That is the first and foremost thing the District Judge"
"shall  do  before  embarking  upon  the  arduous  task  of  investigating"
"title  to  the  land.    If  the  identification  of  the  land  is  not  possible,"
"there  is  no  necessity  to  examine  the  title  Deeds  or  the  pedigree."
"The title shall be investigated on a properly identified corpus.4  The"
"duty is, I stress, cast not on the party but on the Court.5 Even at"
"the stage of writing the Judgment if the mind of the District Judge"
"is  not  clear  as  to  the  identification  of  the  corpus,  he  can  call  for"
"further  evidence  on 
that  matter  giving  prior  notice 
to  all
