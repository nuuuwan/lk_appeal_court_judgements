"In  that  backdrop,  I  cannot  agree  with  the  learned  District  Judge"
"when  he  has  stated 
in 
the  Judgment 
that  although 
the  4th"
"Defendant has stated in evidence that she became entitled to Lot 1"
"on  Deeds  4D1-4D4,  she  has  not  in  the  statement  of  claim  made"
"such  a  claim  or  set  out  such  a  pedigree,  but  claimed  Lot  1  on"

"Plaintiff  who  has  shown  the  boundaries  to  the  surveyor.    The  4th"
"Defendant  has  told  the  surveyor  that  Lots  1  and  4  are  different"
"lands."
"In that backdrop, it is unfair by the 4th Defendant to say that two"
"boundaries  of  the  Plaintiffs’  Deeds  tally  with  the  Preliminary  Plan"
"as  the  boundaries  were  shown  to  the  surveyor  by  the  Plaintiff."
"Why  only  two?  What  about  the  other  two  boundaries? 
  That"
"means, the Plaintiff has unable to show all four boundaries of her"
"Deeds on the ground."
