"05.","In  support  of the  ground  of appeal,  counsel  for  the  Appellant submitted"
"","that  the  Government  Analyst  report  does  not  confirm  that  the  pellets  or"
"","the  empty  cartridges  found  had  been  used  through  the  firearm  given  for"
"","analysis.  Hence,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  fire  arm  recovered  was  in"
"","fact  the  one  used  to  commit  the  offence.  As 
the  productions  were  not"
"","produced  at the  trial, the  witnesses  could  not  identify  those  as  the  items"
"","recovered. Counsel  further submitted that there  was  no  proper admissible"
"","evidence  led  to  prove  that  the  productions  had  gone  missing. It was  the"
"","contention  of the  counsel  for  the  Appellant  that  the  purported  statement"
"","made  under  section  27  of the  Evidence  Ordinance  was  not  in  the  legal"
"","form.  Counsel  further  submitted  that  the  eye  witnesses  are  vested  with"
"","interest and should not be  relied upon."
