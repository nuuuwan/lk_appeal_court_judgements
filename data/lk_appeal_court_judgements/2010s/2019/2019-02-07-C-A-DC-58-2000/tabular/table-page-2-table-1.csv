"This is a partition action.  After trial the learned District Judge"
"pronounced the Judgment dated 17.07.1995.  After coming into"
"strong 
findings 
of 
fact  on  devolution  of 
title 
followed  by"
"answering  of  the  issues  raised  at  the  trial,  the  learned  District"
"Judge has in the last part of the Judgment directed the plaintiff"
"to  tender  to  Court  the  schedule  of  shares  prepared  in  terms  of"

"It is my considered view that this appeal is misconceived in law"
"warranting dismissal of it in limine as there is no right of appeal"
"against  the  impugned  order,  which  is  not  the  Judgment  of  the"
