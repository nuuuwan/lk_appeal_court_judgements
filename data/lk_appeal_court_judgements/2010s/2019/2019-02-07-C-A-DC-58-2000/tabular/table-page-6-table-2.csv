"learned  District  Judge 
is  contrary 
to 
the  provisions  of"
"section 25 of the partition Act."
"In  the  instant  case,  the  schedule  of  shares  had  to  be  finalized"
"not  by  the  Judge  who  pronounced  the  Judgment  but  by  his"
"successor.   He considered the schedules of shares tendered by"
"Attorneys  of  the  parties  and  decided  the  schedule  of  shares"
"tendered by that of the 10th defendant is in conformity with the"
"Judgment  already  pronounced.    It  is  the  Judge  who  has  taken"
"the  ultimate  decision.    I  see  no  illegality  in  it.    Therefore  the"
"argument of the learned counsel for the 15th defendant that the"
"District Judge erred by delegating his judicial function to parties"
"to  prepare  and  tender  schedule  of  shares  and  therefore  “the"
"Judgment  of 
the  District  Court”  shall  be  set  aside  does  not"
"comment itself to me."
"The  15th  defendant  cannot  now  canvass  the 
findings  of  the"
"Judgment. 
  If  he  was  not 
in  agreement  with  the  Judgment"
"pronounced 
in  1995,  he  could  have  appealed  against 
the"
"Judgment at that time."
"I dismiss the appeal with costs."
