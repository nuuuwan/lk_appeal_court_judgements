"The  petitioner  and  the  9th  respondents  are  siblings.    After  a"
"partition  action,  their  ancestral  home  has  fallen  into  the  lots"
"allotted  to  both  of  them.    The  electricity  meter  had  been  in  the"
"part  of  the  house  which  went  to  the  petitioner.    As  seen  from"
"5R1, the electricity connection has been given in the name of the"
"9th  respondent.    5R1  dated  24.03.1986  is  a  legally  enforceable"
"Agreement 
entered 
into  between 
the  5th 
respondent-Lanka"
"Electricity  Company 
(Private)  Limited 
(LECO) 
and 
the  9th"
"respondent. 
 
In 
the  meantime,  as 
seen 
from  5R2  dated"
"11.03.2014, upon a written request made by the petitioner from"
"the LECO, the name of the Electricity Account has been changed"
"from the 9th respondent to the petitioner.  In 5R2 the petitioner"
"has  specifically  stated  that,  once  the  name  change  is  made,  if"
"his brother-the 9th respondent objects to it, he is aware that the"
"LECO would again change it in the name of his brother, and he"
"has no objection to it.  By 5R5 and 5R6 the 9th respondent has"
"objected  to  it,  and  therefore,  the  LECO  has  changed  it  in  the"
"name  of  his  brother-the  9th  respondent.    This  has  been  ratified"
"by  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  Public"
"Utilities  Commission  of  Sri  Lanka  has 
informed 
it 
to 
the"
"petitioner  by  5R10  and 
the  LECO  has 
informed 
it 
to 
the"
"petitioner by P23."
"The petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash P23 by"
"way of writ of certiorari and to compel the LECO by way of writ"
"of mandamus to change the Electricity Account in his name."
