"In  other words  whilst  a proxy of  one  Mr.  Chandrasena,  AAL  was  on record,  another"
"Attorney~at~Law called Mr.  Piyaratne Bandara filed both the notice of appeal as well as"
"the petition of appeal."
"Mr.  W. Dayaratne, PC contended on behalf of the substituted Plaintiff~Respondent that"
"since this procedure is contrary to the Civil Procedure Code the petition of appeal is bad"
"in law and the appeal must be rejected. Mr.  Vijith Singh for the 1st  Defendant~Appellant"
"argued that the proxy given  by  the 1st  Defendant to Mr.  Piyarathne  Bandara restricted"
"him to fileonly the petition of appeal and further contended that notwithstanding the 2nd"
"proxy, the power of the 1st proxy holder remained in force."
"Both counsel  acknowledged the legal proposition that has  stood for  years  namely two"
"proxies  could  not  exist  side  by  side  for  a  party.  The  cases  which  affirmed  the  legal"
"principle have laid down that no  Attorney~at~Law other than the Attorney who is  on"
"record could file the notice and petition of appeal~see See1awathie v. Jayasinghe (1985) 2"
"Sri LR. 260; Fernando v.  Fernando (1997) 3 Sri LR. p.l."
