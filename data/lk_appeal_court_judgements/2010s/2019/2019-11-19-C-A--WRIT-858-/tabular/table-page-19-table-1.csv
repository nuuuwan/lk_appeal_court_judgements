"cou rse  of action . In  the said  circumstances, this Court sees  no merit in  the first"
"argument advanced on  behalf of the 4th  Respondent."
"The  basis  for the  second  argument presented  on  behalf of the 4th  Respondent"
"is that Sections 27A(1) and  27A(2)  must be  read  together. Th e said  argument is"
"that  the  use  of the  word s, 
'subject  to  Sections  22,  2321  and  42H'  in  Section"
"27A(1)  means that the  power of the 4th  Respondent,  conferred  by  Sections  22"
"and  42H,  to  alienate  land  is  kept  alive,  inspite  of an  Order  being  made  under"
"Section 27A(1). Th is  argument  runs contrary to the provisio ns of Section  27A(2)"
"w hich  specifies  that the effect  of an  Order under Section  27A(1)  is  to vest the"
"title in  th e State Corporation mentioned therein.  It is to get over the provisions"
"of Section 27A(2) that t he  learned  Counse l for the 4th  Respo ndent is  urging that"
"the  two  Sections  be  read  t ogether.  The 
learned  President 's  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitione r has quite correctly su bmitted that the words, 'subject to Sections 22,"
"23 and 42H'  in  Section 27A(1),  must be  understood in th e co ntext of the rest of"
"the  wording  in  Section  27A(1).  As  noted  above,  the  Order that is  made  by  the"
"Ministe r must be  'at the request of the Commission'.  Thus,  such  request of the"
"4th  Respondent to vest any  agricultural or estate  land  in  any State  Corporation"
"must  be  within  th e  powers of alienation  conferred  on  the  4th  Respondent  by"
"Section s 22  and  42H  of the  LRC Law,  and  should  be  subject  to the  restrictions"
"in  Section  23 .  Thus, 
if  the  req uest  of the  4th  Respondent 
is  not  within  the"
"provisions of Sections  22, 23  and 42H,  the  Minister can  disregard  the  request."
"This Court is  of the view that thi s is the logical meaning that  can  be given to the"
"said  words,  'subject  to Sections 22,  23  and 42H'.  The  interpretation  sought to"
"be given  by the 4th  Re sponde nt  that in  spite of an  Order under Section  27A(1),"
"the  power of alienation  conferred  on  the  4th  Respondent  by  Sections  22  and"
"42H  is ke pt alive  runs  contra ry to the rest of the provisions of Section  27A and"
"21 Section 23 specifies that no land shall be alienated to a person who is not a citizen of Sri Lanka."
