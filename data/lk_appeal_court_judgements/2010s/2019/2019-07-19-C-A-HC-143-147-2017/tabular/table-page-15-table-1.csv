"no injuries on the deceased. The only apparent difficulty the deceased had"
"at that time  was a  stomach-ache and  the  appellants have provided some"
"Panadol  before· they took him out in a vehicle that late evening."
"In these circumstances and in the absence of any medical evidence to"
"support,  the  appellants  challenge  that  the  use  of  the  adjectives  such  as"
"/I cruel,  inhuman,  merciless""  in  describing  the  alleged  assault  is  another"
"factor that is indicative of the possible prejudiced mind of the trial Court."
"This  complaint by the  appellants  should  be  considered  along with"
"the challenge mounted by them on the reliability of the witness Munseer."
"All  Counsel 
for 
the  appellants 
referred 
in 
their  submissions 
to 
the"
"instances where, the said witness had made inconsistent statements before"
"the trial Court, in his narration of the sequence of events which culminated"
"with the death of the deceased."
"It appears  that there  were  two  other persons  when  the  appellants"
"took Munseer and the deceased to the house at Mavugama.  The prosecution"
"did  not  call  any  of 
them  as  witnesses 
in  support  of 
their  case.  The"
"prosecution totally relied on the testimony of Munseer to highlight the way"
"the appellants have treated the deceased after his arrest at the mosque."
"This  aspect  was  relevant  to  the  case  presented  by  the  prosecution"
"since 
the· charges  were  framed  on 
the  basis  of  constructive 
liability."
"Munseer  was  to  disclose  the  culpable  mind-set of each  of the  appellants,"
"upon their actions during the period of interrogation that had followed the"
"arrest."
