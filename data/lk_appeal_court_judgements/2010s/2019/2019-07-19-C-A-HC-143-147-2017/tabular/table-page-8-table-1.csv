"Learned  President's  Counsel  for  the  5th  appellant complained  that"
"his  client  was  not afforded  a  fair  trial  before  the  High  Court,  upon  the"
"following considerations;"
"a. 
the time duration of 27 years since the date of offence to the date"
"of conviction,"
"b. 
the  prosecution failed  to  prove  the  identity  of the  5th  appellant"
"since  there  were  no  witness  for  the  incident  of shooting which"
"resulted in the death of the deceased,"
"c. 
the trial Court failed to appreciate that the prosecution had failed"
"to establish criminal liability of the 5th  appellant in relation to its"
"allegation of him, being a member of an unlawful assembly."
"the  five  appellants,  in  their 
Learned  Counsel  who  appeared  for"
"detailed  submissions in support of the respective grounds of appeal they"
"have  raised,  have  mounted  attacks  broadly  on  two  main  areas  of  the"
"prosecution evidence. One such area is the unreliability of the evidence of"
"Munseer  and the imputation of constructive criminal liability on the basis"
"of the  appellants  being members  of an unlawful assembly that had been"
"formed with the common object of causing injuries to the deceased."
"In 
However,  Learned  President's  Counsel  for 
the  1st  appellant,"
"addition to his submissions on these broad areas of dispute, complained of"
"a  probable  prejudiced  mind  of  the  trial  Court  to 
the  detriment  of  the"
"appellants.  He  sought 
to 
impress  upon 
this  Court 
that 
the 
line  of"
"questioning  undertaken  by  the  trial  Court  of  the  appellants,  is  a  clear"
"indication  of  the  existence  of  such  a  pre-determined  state  of  mind  and"
"therefore  its  approach  to  the  evaluation 
of  their  version  of  events  was"
