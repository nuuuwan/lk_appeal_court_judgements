"After the prosecution and the defence submissions the learned High Court Judge"
"fixed the case for judgement."
"After trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty of the indicted"
"charge levelled against the Accused- Appellant."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  convicted  the  Accused  on  10.03.2011.  After  the"
"conviction  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  recorded  the  Allocutus  as  per"
"following the procedure under the Criminal Procedure Code."
"When  this  matter  came  up  for  argument  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Accused"
"Appellant took up several defects in the High Court Trial."
"Accordingly,  the  1st  defect  was  that,  Learned  High  Court  Judge  erred  in  law  by"
"perusing  and  relying  upon  the  non-summary  evidence  of  pw-01  at  the  time  of"
"writing the judgement."
"The 2nd defect was that, Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in law on"
"the principles relating to section 27 of the evidence ordinance."
"The  3rd  defect  was  that;  Learned  High  Court  Judge  was  totally  oblivious  to  the"
"fact that a mere non- confessionary utterance by the appellant had been converted"
"to a confessionary statement by the State Counsel thereby denying the appellant of"
"a fair trial."
"The 4th defect was that; items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to"
"support the conviction."
"The  5th  defect  was  that,  items  of  evidence  favourable  to  the  appellant  have  not"
"been considered by the Learned High Court Judge, there by denying the appellant"
"of a fair trial."
