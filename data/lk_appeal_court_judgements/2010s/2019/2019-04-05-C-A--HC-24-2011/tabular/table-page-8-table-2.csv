"It was further held in the case that,"
"“Appellate courts are generally slow to interfere with the decisions of inferior courts"
"on  questions  of  fact  or  oral  testimony.  The  Privy  Council  has  stated  that  appellate"
"court should not ordinarily interfere with the trial courts opinion as to the credibility"
"of a witness as the trial judge alone knows the demeanour of the witness; he alone can"
"appreciate  the  manner  in  which  the  questions  are  answered,  whether  with  honest"
"candour  or  with  doubtful  plausibility  and  whether  after  careful  thought  or  with"
"reckless glibness; and he alone can form a reliable opinion as to whether the witness"
"has emerged with credit from cross examination.” (Also see: Valarshak Seth Apcar v."
