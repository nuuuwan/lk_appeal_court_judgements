"It is the position of the petitioner that his contract service in the"
"Army  came  to  an  end  on  13.09.2012  after  22  years  of  service,"
"and therefore he is entitled to back wages and pension."
"In paragraph 25 of the petition, the petitioner admits that his 12"
"year  service  ended  on  13.09.2002,  and  22  years  of  service  is"
"required  for  pension.    He  did  not  have  22  years  of  service,  and"
"not 
even  12 
years. 
  His 
services  were 
suspended  before"
"completion of 12 year service.  In paragraph 26 he says that his"
"request  to  lift  the  suspension  and  to  allow  him  to  serve  in  the"
"Army for another 10 years was turned down."
"His main complaint is, according to the petition, that no inquiry"
"was  held  before  termination  of  his  services.  R5,  the 
inquiry"
"notes, tendered by the respondents with the objections, belies it."
"According 
to  R5, 
there  had  been  an 
inquiry 
to  which 
the"
"petitioner  has  participated.    It  is  also  clear  from  R5,  at  that"
"inquiry, the victim Tamil lady had not participated because that"
"lady had been on remand upon execution of a warrant (may be"
"due  to  being  absent  to  give  evidence  in the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court)."
"However  at  the  end  of  the 
inquiry 
it  has  been  proposed  to"
"reinstate the petitioner if the petitioner  has been exonerated by"
"the Civil Court.  The petitioner now relies on R5 to claim that he"
"is  entitled  to  be  reinstated  as  he  was  acquitted  by  the  High"
"Court.  The petitioner cannot approbate and reprobate.  On the"
"one  hand  he  denies  inquiry  being  held.    On  the  other  he  relies"
"on the inquiry report."
"In any event, the Commander of the Army is not bound to act on"
"that  observation  or  recommendation.    The  Commander  of  the"
"Army by order dated 05.11.2012 has dismissed him from service"
"on disciplinary grounds."
