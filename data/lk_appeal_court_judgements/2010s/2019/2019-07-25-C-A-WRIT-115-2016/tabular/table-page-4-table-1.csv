"According  to  R3,  after  12  year  enlistment  as  a  soldier,  another"
"maximum  period  of  12  years 
is  at 
the 
for  “re-engagement”"
"recommendation of the Commanding Officer subject to appeal to"
"the  Commander  of  the  Army.    The  petitioner,  as  I  said  earlier,"
"before  completion  of  his 
initial  enlistment 
for  12  years,  got"
"remanded  and 
thereafter  charged 
in 
the  High  Court  upon"
"indictment  for  an  offence  which  attracted  both  national  and"
"international attention—vide R10-P12."
"According 
to 
R11 
and 
R12, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
in 
a"
"Fundamental  Rights  violation  application  has  decided  that  the"
"aforementioned  Tamil 
fundamental 
rights  have  been 
lady’s"
"violated  by  the  aforesaid  acts  and  ordered  compensation  to  the"
"victim."
"Pending  determination  of  the  High  Court  case,  his  22  year"
"service has expired.  However he has served less than 12 years"
"at  the  time  of  his  services  were  suspended.    By  R12  it  seems"
"that  the  petitioner  is  also  a  respondent  to  that  Fundamental"
"Rights case."
"It is also relevant to note that the petitioner together with others"
"was  acquitted  not  after 
trial  but  due 
to 
the 
failure  of 
the"
"prosecutrix  to  be  present  in  Court  to  give  evidence,  which  is"
"common in rape cases due to various factors."
"The  decision  of  the  Commander  of  the  Army  to  dismiss  the"
"petitioner from service on disciplinary grounds is justifiable."
"Writ is a discretionary remedy.  The facts and circumstances  of"
"this  case  do  not  warrant  exercising  that  discretion  in  favour  of"
"the  petitioner  merely  because  he  was  acquitted  by  the  High"
"Court."
