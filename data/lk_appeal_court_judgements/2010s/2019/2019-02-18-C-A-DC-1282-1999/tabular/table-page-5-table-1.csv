"stated that the said father of the 1st Plaintiff had been waiting for the CTB to"
"call for his title but the CTB did not do so. When he came to know that the CTB"
"was  giving  back  the  building  he  wrote  to  the  relevant  Minister  by  a  letter"
"which has been marked as P7."
"Although, the Appellant was submitted that no tenancy agreement, whether a"
"formal agreement of any other document as to the existences of tenancy had"
"been  produced  by  the  Plaintiffs,  and  the  Appellant  Company  further  stated"
"that the Plaintiffs have failed and or were unable to state even what the rent"
"that was allegedly charged by them, and they Plaintiffs failed to establish any"
"instances  of  payment  of  rent  by  or  on  behalf  of  William  Brothers 
the"
"Appellant. To answer this argument, the Plaintiffs stated in the District  Court"
"that the documentary proof on payment of rent was destroyed by fire due to"
"civil commotion. And they further state that at the time when the 1st Plaintiff’s"
"evidence was recorded these issues had not been raised."
"After  careful  perusal  of  the  statement  of  claims  and  the  answer  of  the"
"Appellant, it is clear that they had not pleaded any title; they only pointed out"
"few enigmas on the Plaintiff side and directly claimed for prescriptive title. In"
"paragraph  5,  the  Appellant  had  stated  that  the  Appellant  had  given  the  said"
"building on rent for a period of 30 years and had recovered rent. However, the"
"Respondents’  position  is  that  statement  on  the  rent  that  recovered  by  the"
"Appellant is incorrect. They further stated that no payment of rent was made"
"by the CTB from the  year 1958. It was in the year 1991 on the orders of the"
"CTB that the rent from the year 1958 was calculated and paid to the Appellant"
"after  deducting  the  amount  paid  as  rates  and  expenditure  incurred  in  the"
"repairs.  They  also  stated  that  this  had  taken  place  without 
informing  the"
"Plaintiffs who had requested the release of the buildings."
