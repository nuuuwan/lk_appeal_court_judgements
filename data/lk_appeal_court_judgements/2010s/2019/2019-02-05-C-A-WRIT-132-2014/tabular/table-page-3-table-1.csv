"R
elief (c) above is granted."
"P30  is  based  on  P29.    If  P29  is  withdrawn  or  quashed,  P30"
"cannot survive independently."
"In addition, what has been stated in P30 about imposing VAT on"
"the  income  generated  through  private  sample  testing  has  been"
"reiterated  in  the  Resolution  marked  P28,  which  part  has  not"
"been challenged by the petitioners in this application."
"Hence I formally quash P30."
"Relief (d) above is granted."
"The principal argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners"
"in respect of the relief (c) above was that “the financial powers of"
"the  Municipal  Council  are  with 
the  Standing  Committee  on"
"and  not  with 
the  5th 
Finance  and 
the 
(General)  Council”"
"respondent  Commissioner  of  Local  Government  or 
the  12th"
"respondent Governor of the Province."
"There  cannot  be  any  dispute  that  Resolutions  marked  P8,  P14"
"and  P28  referred  to  in  (e)  and  (f)  above  were  adopted  by  “the"
"Standing Committee on Finance and the (General) Council”."
"Hence  the  petitioners  whilst  accepting  the  parts  contained  in"
"P28 which are favourable to them, cannot successfully challenge"
"one  unfavourable  part  of 
it  whereby 
the  petitioners’  extra"
"remuneration  was  reduced 
(not 
totally  denied)  after  serious"
"deliberations.  That decision to revise the extra remuneration in"
"respect  of  testing  of  private  samples  using  State  resources,  in"
"my  view, 
is  not  ex 
facie  unreasonable  to  quash  by  way  of"
"certiorari."
