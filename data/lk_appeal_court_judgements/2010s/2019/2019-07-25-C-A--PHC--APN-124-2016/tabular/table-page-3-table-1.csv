radeshiya  Sabha  and  re-fixed  the  matter 
for  argument 
for"
"11.05.2016.    I  must  state  that  once  the  case  is  fixed  for  the"
"argument 
in  the  presence  of  both  parties,  there 
is  no 
legal"
"requirement to reissue notice, if one party is absent.  Hence the"
"submission  that  the  Pradeshiya  Sabha  was  not  represented  on"
"the  aforesaid  second  date  of  argument  because  no  notice  was"
"served  on 
the  Pradeshiya  Sabha 
is  outrageous. 
  However,"
"according to the Journal Entry dated 11.05.2016, notice had in"
"fact been issued on the Pradeshiya Sabha."
"Be that as it may, the Pradeshiya Sabha, in paragraph 22 of the"
"petition  states  that,  its  Attorney  filed  an  application  before  the"
"High  Court  by  way  of  petition  and  affidavit  on  14.07.2016"
"seeking  to  relist  the  matter  for  argument  but  the  High  Court"
"Judge refused that application by order dated 20.07.2016.  The"
"alleged “true copies” of the said petition and affidavit have been"
"marked as P9A and P9B, and a certified copy of the said order as"
"P10."
"However  no  Journal  Entry  has  been  produced  confirming  that"
"such  a  relisting  application  was  made  to  the  High  Court.    I"
"cannot accept P9A and P9B as “true copies” of the petition and"
"affidavit  tendered  to  the  High  Court.    P9A  petition  is  undated"
"and tampered with by making various personal notes on it.  P9B"
"affidavit  is  also  undated  and  unsigned.    They  can  no  way  be"
"regarded  as  true  copies  of  the  originals.    At  the  argument  on"
"02.07.2019 when the question was posed why certified copies of"
"the alleged petition and affidavit were not tendered to this Court,"
"the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  petitioner  stated 
that  no  such"
"relisting  application  filed  by  way  of  petition  and  affidavit  could"
"be 
found 
in  the  High  Court  case. 
  Then  this  Court  has  to"
