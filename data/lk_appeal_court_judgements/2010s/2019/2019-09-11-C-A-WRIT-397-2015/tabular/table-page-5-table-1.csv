onvinced  that  the  Petitioner  has  filed  this  action  as  a  public-"
"spirited  person  concerned  to  see  that  the  law  is  obeyed  in  the"
"interest of all.4"
"In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte5, Full Bench"
"of  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  writ  will  not  issue  for  private"
"purposes."
"The  Petitioner  has  not  shown  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court"
"that he has a legal right to the performance of the legal duty by"
"the  4th-12th  Respondents  to  evict  the  1st-3rd  unlawful  occupiers"
"from  the  adjoining  State  Land  when  the  law  provides  under"
"certain  conditions  for  regularizing  unlawful  occupation  of  State"
"Lands. 
  There 
is  no 
legal  duty  on  the  part  of  the  4th-12th"
"Respondents  to  compulsorily  eject  all  the  unlawful  occupants"
"from  State  Lands 
including 
the  1st-3rd  Respondents. 
  The"
"situation  might  be  different 
if 
they  unlawfully  reside 
in  an"
"Industrial Zone whilst being a nuisance to legitimate businesses"
"carried  on 
in  the  Zone. 
  Hence  the  Court  expects  that  the"
"authorities will act responsibly."
"When the authorities give State Lands with specific directions to"
"use for industrial purposes, it is the duty of the relevant officials"
"to 
facilitate 
them 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
businesses  without"
"hindrances from unlawful occupiers."
"As public law remedy in my view is not available to the Petitioner"
"in  the  manner  the  case  was  presented  before  Court,  I  dismiss"
"the application of the Petitioner without costs."
