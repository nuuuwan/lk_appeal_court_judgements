nlawful  occupiers  of  State  Land  using  State  machinery  when"
"there are a number of unlawful occupiers in the neighborhood."
"However, there is one matter which concerns me.  It appears by"
"reading  P9  and  by 
looking  at 
the  addresses  of 
the  parties"
"(subject  to  correction)  that  this  area,  where  Lot  924  and  the"
"houses  of  1st-3rd  Respondents  stand  on, 
is  in  the  Industrial"
"Zone.    The  land  has  been  given  to  Rizvi  on  a  long-lease  only  to"
"utilize  for  industrial  purposes  and  not  for  residential  purposes."
"The 
land 
is  now  being  used  by  the  Petitioner 
for 
industrial"
"purpose,  to  be  specific,  to  conduct  the  business  of  operating  a"
"garage (mechanical workshop). If it is in the Industrial Zone, it is"
"not 
clear 
how

"residential purposes.  Such a step not only be ill-conceived, but"
"also  seems  to  me  (subject  to  correction)  to  be  against  the  Law."

"make any specific finding on that matter, and leave that matter"
"open to be decided probably in a future litigation."
"The  next  matter 
to  be 
considered 
is  what  prompted 
the"
"Petitioner to file this action.  That is to seek redress to resolve a"
"private  dispute  between  the  1st-3rd  Respondents  on  one  hand"
"and the Petitioner on the other.  The Petitioner says that the 1st-"
"3rd  Respondents  always  disturb  the  smooth  functioning  of  the"
"motor  vehicle  garage  business  in  his  Lot  No.  924  by  various"
"means including pelting stones to his side on the basis that the"
"operation  of  the  garage  is  a  health  hazard  to  their  families  and"
"also nuisance to them.  On the other hand, it is the position of"
"the  Petitioner  that  the  presence  of  1st-3rd  Respondents 
is  a"
"nuisance  to  the  Petitioner.    In  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  am  not"
