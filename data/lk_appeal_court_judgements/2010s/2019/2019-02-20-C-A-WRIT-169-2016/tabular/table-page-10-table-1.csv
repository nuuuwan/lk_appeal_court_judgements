"A
pplication of clauses 17 and 18 of the Collective Agreement to"
"the 
facts  of 
this  case 
is  completely  a  misdirection  as 
the"
"suspension  of  the  1st  respondent  is  neither  “as  a  measure  of"
"punishment” nor “pending disciplinary inquiries” as contemplated"
"in those two clauses."
"This 
is  not 
the 
first 
time  a  workman’s  services  have  been"
"suspended  pending  the  handing  over  the  quarters.    There  is  a"
"practice in the plantation sector to suspend workmen from work"
"who forcibly occupying the quarters without handing them over"
"when they are transferred within service.  This practice has been"
"acknowledged  by 
the  superior  Courts 
in 
this  country.  The"
"suspension in such circumstances, is neither a punishment nor"
"a 
step 
taken 
pending 
a 
disciplinary 
inquiry, 
but 
is 
an"
"administrative  mechanism  effectively  implemented  to  take  back"
"the  old  quarters  in  order  to  be  given  to  the  successor  and  to"
"induce the workman to shift to the new quarters without delay."
"It  is  true  that  the  initial  suspension  is  by  the  employer,  but"
"whether 
it  shall  be  kept  alive 
indefinitely  or  set  at  naught"
"instantly  is  entirely  in  the  hands  of  the  workman  and  not  the"
"employer.  If he wants, he can shift to the new quarters and lift"
"the  suspension  immediately.    Otherwise,  he  can  refuse  to  shift"
"to the new quarters and keep the suspension in operation until"
"his  retirement. 
  Hence  the  pivotal  argument  of  the 
learned"
"counsel  for  the  1st  respondent  that  the  “indefinite  suspension”"
"without  an  inquiry  and  without  pay  is  contrary  to  clauses  17"
"and 18 of the Collective Agreement is absolutely no merit.  There"
"is no indefinite suspension. There is no follow up inquiry either."
"“Indefinite suspension”, if at all, is something created not by the"
"employer, but by the employee himself."
