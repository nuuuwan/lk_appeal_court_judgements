"workman 
to  be  so 
transferred 
is 
incidental 
to  and  an"
"implied condition of the workman's service. In my view it is"
"absolutely 
essential 
that 
the  management 
should 
be"
"possessed of such a right and should have control over the"
"allocation  of  line  rooms  for  the  purposes  of  efficient  and"
"proper administration of the estate with a view to achieving"
"maximum productivity. In The Ceylon Estates Staffsâ€™ Union"
"v.  The  Superintendent,  Meddecombra  Estate,  Watagoda"
"(1970)  73  NLR  278  this  court  recognised  the  legal  right  of"
"an employer to transfer his staff from one place of  work to"
"another  within  his  service  subject 
to  certain 
limitations"
"which  do  not  arise  for  consideration  in  the  instant  case.  If"
"so it must necessarily follow that an employer has the right"
"to  transfer  his  workman  from  one  place  of  residence  to"
"another  within  his  service.  No  doubt  it  would  be  open  to"
"such a workman to make representations to the appropriate"
"authorities  against  the  transfer but he cannot,  in  my view,"
"be  permitted  to  set  the  employer  at  defiance  by  blatantly"
"refusing to comply with the order as in the instant case. The"
"failure  or  refusal  of  the  workman  to  comply  with  such  an"
"order  amounts  to  a  disobedience  of  the  lawful  order  of  his"
"employer and constitutes by itself misconduct on the part of"
"the  workman.  There  is  no  necessity  in  such  circumstances"
"for the employer to go through the formal process of holding"
"a domestic inquiry for ascertaining whether there has been"
"on  the  part  of  the  workman  a  refusal  to  carry  out  the"
"employer's order of transfer. The conduct of the workman in"
"continuing 
to  remain
