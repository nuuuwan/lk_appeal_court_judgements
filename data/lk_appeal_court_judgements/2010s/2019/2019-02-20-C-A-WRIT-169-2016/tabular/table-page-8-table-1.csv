"q
uarters, 
the  petitioner, 
instead  of  complying  with 
it,  had,"
"admittedly, got some other labourers to occupy the old quarters"
"on his behalf and left the old quarters.12  This arrogant behavior"
"of 
the  1st 
respondent, 
to  say 
the 
least, 
is 
intolerable  and"
"completely unwarranted.  He has no right whatsoever to give the"
"staff quarters to labourers to occupy. But the 3rd respondent in"
"his  award  to  my  dismay  has  considered  this  matter  also  in"
"favour  of  the  1st  respondent  when  he  says  that  “During  the"
"period 
of 
interdiction,  applicant 
(the  1st 
respondent 
to 
this"
"application)  had  given  the  quarters  to  a  trusted  person  to  look"
"after who was working in the estate and once in a way he visited"
"the house.”    The 1st  respondent  does not want the quarters  nor"
"does he want to hand it over to the management. Can an estate"
"with a large number of labour force run in this fashion?"
"The  3rd  respondent  in  the  award  has  quoted  section  2  of  the"
"Estates Quarters (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1971.  It has"
"no application to the present case as that section deals with the"
"subject  of  “Period  during  which 
the  right 
to  occupy  quarters"
"subsists  after  the  termination  of  employee’s  services.”    As  the"
"learned counsel for the 1st respondent admits the services of the"
"1st respondent were “never terminated”.13"
"The  3rd 
respondent  has  quoted  clauses  16  and  17  of 
the"
"Collective 
Agreement14  may 
be 
to 
show 
that 
indefinite"
"suspension without inquiry and without pay is in contravention"
