"gratia payment on or before 10.03.1998.2"
"Admittedly, 
the  petitioner 
fulfilled  his  part  of  obligations 
in"
"respect  of  (a)  and  (c)  above  on  or  before  the  due  dates,  but  the"
"1st respondent did not do his part, i.e. (b) above, believe it or not,"
"up  to  now―nearly  21  years  from  the  date  he  was  supposed  to"
"handover the quarters."
"It  is  significant  to  note  that,  in  the  aforesaid  Labour  Tribunal"
"settlement/order, 
the  handing  over  of 
the  Middle  Division"
"quarters  and  moving 
to 
the  Lower  Division  quarters  before"
"28.02.1998 was not subject to any condition.  If there were such"

"new quarters on 01.04.1998.4  But the 1st respondent did not do"
"it  because,  according 
to 
the  1st 
respondent,  although 
“the"
"quarters  is  completely  repaired,  the  quarters  is  still  lacking  the"
"necessary furniture.”5"
