"I
t  is  clear  by  then  that  the  1st  respondent  was  not  prepared  to"
"move into the Lower Division quarters, and hence the petitioner"
"has sent the letter dated 02.04.1998 suspending the services of"
"the 1st respondent with immediate effect “until you shift into the"
"Lower Division quarters provided to you, along  with the furniture"
"of your present quarters on the Middle Division.”"
"The  1st  respondent  neither  handed  over  the  Middle  Division"
"quarters  nor  shifted  to  the  Lower  Division  quarters,  if  he  says"
"that inadequate furniture is the issue, with the furniture in the"
"quarters which he is presently in occupation.  Surely, he cannot"
"expect more or better furniture in the new quarters than he was"
"using  in  the  old  quarters,  particularly  when  both  the  quarters"
"are of the same type.6"
"Thereafter the Labour Department has made several attempts to"
"settle  the  matter  and  as  they  were  unsuccessful,  the  Labour"

"4th  respondent  has  again  referred  the  matter  unknown  to  the"
"petitioner for arbitration in 2011.8  It is pursuant to that inquiry"
"the  arbitration  award  P10,  which  is  being  challenged  in  these"
"proceedings, was made."
"There  is  no  dispute  that  the  suspension  of  the  1st  respondent"
"came into being as a result of the defiance of the 1st respondent"
"to hand over the Middle Division quarters and shift to the Lower"
