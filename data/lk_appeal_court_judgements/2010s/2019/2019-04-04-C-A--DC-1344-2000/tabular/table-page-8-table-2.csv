"estoppel by standing by or acquiescence."
"Spencer Bower and Turner state the principle of estoppel by acquiescence as follows:~"
"""Where A has a right or title which B is in fact infringing under a mistaken belief that his acts are"
"not acts of infringement at all, and A is aware of his own title or right, and also of B's invasion of"
"that title or right,  and of his  erroneous belief that he is not encroaching thereon,  but is  lawfully"
"exercising rights of his own,  and yet,  with that knowledge,  A so conducts himself or so abstains"
"from objection, protest, warning or action,  as  to foster and maintain the delusion under which he"
"knows that B is labOUring, and induces B to act to his prejudice on the faith of the acknowledgment"
"to be implied from  such conduct or inaction or, A is  not permitted afterwards  to assert his own"
"rights against B, or contest B's rights against himself,,1"
