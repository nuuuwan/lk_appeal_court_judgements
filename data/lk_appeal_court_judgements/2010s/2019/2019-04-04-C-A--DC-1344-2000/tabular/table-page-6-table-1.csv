"which  was  later  transferred  by  the  original  owners  of  the  land  to  the  son  and  two"
"daughters  of Jamis  Appuhamy.  The  son  who  got  1J3rd  of  the  land  was  the  original"
"Defendant in the case, whilst the wife of the original Plaintiff obtained another 1/3rd and"
"the remaining 1J3rd devolved on the second daughter ofJamis Appuhamy. The deed of sale"
"was  effected  by  the  original  owners  the  Deraniyagalas  so  to  speak  only  after  J amis"
"Appuhamy  had  since  crossed  the  great  divide.  The  document  marked  V5  of  4th  of"
"September 1986 further states that as  far back as  2th January 1979  a Surveyor named J."
"Liyanage  had partitioned Lot  43  into three allotments  among the three children of the"
"deceased J amis Appuhamy namely Mirihana Kankanamlage Nimalasena (the Defendant"
"the brother-in-law of the Plaintiff),  Mirihana Kankanamlage  Kusumawathie  (sister-in"
"law  of  the  Plaintiff)  and  Mirihana  Kankanamlage  Chandrawathie  (the  wife  of  the"
"Plaintiff). The deed of sale  bearing  No.946  was  executed on 19th  of  March 1987 in  the"
"name of the aforesaid three children of the deceased J amis Appuhamy. One cannot resist"
"noticing the chronology of the events."
"In 1975, the late father-in-law of the Plaintiff made a payment for the purchase of the land"
"as  indicated by the receipts referred to above.  In 1979,  the three children,  one of whom"
"was  Chandrawathie-the  wife  of  the  Plaintiff,  proceeded  to  block  the  land  into  three"
"equal parcels. It is curious that the Plaintiff who stood by as a mute bystander whilst the"
"partitioning was taking place around him possibly woke up only in June 1987 -barely two"
"months  after  the  execution  of  the  deed  of  sale  in  favor  of  the  three  persons  who"
"partitioned the land. It also begs the question as to why the Plaintiff filed this action only"
"against  Nimalasena his  brother-in-law, whilst there were  two others  as  well who had"
"become the legal owners of the land namely his wife and sister-in-law. The plaint seeks a"
"constructive trust only in respect of a 1/3rd of the property."
"It is  quite clear from  the above  narrative that the wife  of the Plaintiff also  became  the"
"owner of a 1/3rd  share of the land. It is quite strange as to how the Plaintiff could seek the"
"remedy of constructive trust only against his brother-in-law when his own wife became"
"the  owner  of  another 1J3rd  share  of  the land.  If the brother-in-law was  holding  a 1J3rd"
"share as  a trustee for the Plaintiff, it passes strange as to how the wife and sister-in-law"
