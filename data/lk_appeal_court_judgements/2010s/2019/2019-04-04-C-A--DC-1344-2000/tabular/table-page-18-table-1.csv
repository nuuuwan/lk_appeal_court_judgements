"Upon a conspectus of the foregoing it is crystal clear that the Plaintiff never made out a"
"case of constructive trust at the trial and the learned District Judge of Pugoda misdirected"
"herself on the law and facts when she proceeded to hold that the Defendant was holding"
"the 1I3rd of the property on trust for the Plaintiff."
"I would observe that once the paterfamilias of the family Jamis Appuhamy passed away"
"the whole arrangement among  the three children to secure  the transfer in their names"
"had supervened and in my  view  there is  nothing unjust in that equitable arrangement."
"According to the testimony of Chandrawathie  (the wife of the Plaintiff herself),  it was"
"the Plaintiff who had facilitated the partitioning of the land which benefitted her. Thus"
"here was a Plaintiff who had acquiesced in the supervening arrangement and in my view"
"this voluntary acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff also dis entitles him to invoke the"
"equitable jurisdiction of this court."
"In the circumstances I set aside  the judgment of the District Court of Pugoda  dated 8th"
"December  2000  and  allow  the  appeal  of the  Defendant~Appellant.  The  Plaintiff's  case"
"would thus stand dismissed."
