"It is  further  submitted for the Appellant that prosecution has  failed  to"
"lead  police  evidence 
to 
the  effect  that  the 
injured  victim  too  had"
"suffered cut injuries."
"the 
afore-mentioned 
contradictory

"sustained."
"The items of circumstantial evidence referred to earlier in this case, in"
"my  opinion are  insufficient to  sustain the  weight of the  rope.  Further"
"the 
totality  of the  evidence 
led 
in 
this  case  does  not 
lead 
to  an"
"inescapable  and  irresistible  inference  and  conclusion  that  it  was  the"
"first  accused Appellant who  inflicted the fatal  injury on the deceased."
"The prosecution has  failed to prove this case beyond reasonable doubt"
"and rebut the presumption of innocence."
"is 
ill-founded  due 
to  paucity  of 
The  conviction  of  the  Appellant"
"evidence coupled with the erroneous judicial evaluation on the part of"
"the  Learned  Trial  Judge.  For the  reasons  enumerated  by  me,  on  the"
"facts  and the  law,  in the foregoing paragraphs of this Judgement, I set"
"aside the conviction and sentence, of the  learned High Court Judge of"
"Chilaw dated 31/1 0/ 2015 and acquit the first accused Appellant."
