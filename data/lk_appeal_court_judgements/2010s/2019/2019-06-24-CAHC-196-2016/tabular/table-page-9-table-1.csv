"I  have 
to  stress 
that, 
finding  of the  Learned  Trial  Judge  that  the"
"murder  weapon  had  been  recovered  on  a  Sec.27  statement  of the"
"Appellant is wholly erroneous."
"Thus, 
the  Learned  Trial 
Judge  considering 
same  as 
an 
item  of"
"Circumstantial evidence against the  Appellant had been prejudicial to"
"him."
"In  a  case  of circumstantial  evidence,  the  prosecution  must  establish"
"each  instance  of incriminating  circumstance,  by  way  of reliable  and"
"clinching  evidence,  and  the  circumstances  so  proved  must  form  a"
"complete  chain  of events,  on the  basis  of which,  no  conclusion  other"
"than  one  of  guilt  of  the  accused  can  be 
reached.  Undoubtedly,"
"suspicion,  however  grave 
it  may  be,  can  never  be 
treated  as  a"
"substitute 
for  proof.  While  dealing  with  a  case  of  circumstantial"
"evidence, 
the  court  must  take  utmost  precaution  whilst  finding  an"
"accused guilty, solely on the basis of the circumstances proved before"
