"""that the  circumstances  should  be  of a  definite  tendency 
it  was  held"
"unerringly  pointing  towards 
the  guilt  of the  accused  and 
that  the"
"circumstances  taken  cumulatively  should  form  a  chain  so  complete"
"that there is  no escape committed by the accused and none else."""
"A  perusal  of  the 
judgment  of  the  Learned  Trial 
Judge 
amply"
"demonstrates  that the  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  totally  failed  to  apply"
"the 
said 
above 
mentioned 
guidelines 
when 
evaluating 
the"
"Circumstantial Evidence against the Appellant.  Whilst it is  conceded"
"that 
trial 
judge  being  possessed  vast 
judicial  experience 
and 
a"
"judicially trained mind need not put the guidelines in black and white,"
"yet  a  perusal  of the  judgment  should  indicate  that  the  said  law  had"
"been applied to  the  facts.  It is  my opinion that in the present case, the"
"judgment is devoid of any such judicial evaluation."
"The  Learned  Counsel  for 
the  Appellant  argued  that  Learned  Trial"
"Judge  flawed  on  the  principles  relating  to  burden  of proof on  the"
"Prosecution.  In his  final  conclusion the  learned Trial  Judge  has  come"
"to  a 
finding 
that  whilst  he  accepts 
the  Prosecution  version, 
the"
"Defense version is rejected."
