The  prosecution 
story"
"challenged  in  cross  examination.  No  contradictions  or  omissions"
"have  been  marked  from 
the  prosecution  witnesses. 
Under  the"
"above  circumstances these  facts  point the  finger  showing the  guilt"
"only  of the  1 st  Appellant.  These  facts  are  incapable  of any  other"

"Appellant. 
But 
the
