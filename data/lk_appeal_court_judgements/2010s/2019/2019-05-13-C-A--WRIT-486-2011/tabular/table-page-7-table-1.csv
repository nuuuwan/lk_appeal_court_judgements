"In  any event,  section  39A (2)  of the Act sets  out four pre-conditions that the Minister has to be"
"satisfied  prior to  making  a  divesting  Order  and  in  the  instant  matter  prima  facie  at  least  two"
"conditions are not satisfied as there is  evidence that the land has  been  used for a public purpose"
"and  improvements been affected."
"Hence the first prayer for a writ of mandamus must fail."
"The  alternative  relief is  for a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents,  or anyone or more"
"of them, to duly and forthwith compute,  make available and  pay to the Petitioner the requisite"
"compensation in  respect of the acquisition of the land owned  by her, as  more fully described in"
"the schedule to the petition by the State as  aforementioned and/or duly consider same in terms"
"of the law."
"The communication between the Petitioner and the public authorities  clearly establishes that at"
"least by 25.09.1992 the Petitioner was aware that the land claimed by her has been acquired  by"
"the State  [3Rl and  3R2] . She  was  informed that compensation for the acquired  land  had  been"
"deposited  with  the  Government  Agent,  Colombo  to  be  paid  to  the  claimants  and  for  her  to"
"forward her claim to the Government Agent. She  did  nothing after that for twenty years."
"On  28.08.2010  (SR1)  the  Petitioner again  writes to the  Divisional  Secretary  inquiring whether"
"her land has  been  acquired.  This to me appears to ~ have  been done on advice in  a feeble"
"attempt to justify any  legal  proceedings that were to  be  launched subsequently. The  Divisional"
"Secretary informed the Petitioner on 18.10.2010 (X17) that it has been acquired. This application"
"was  filed  on  20.07.2011 which  is  29 years  after the  acquisition  and  19 years  after the  public"
"authorities confirmed that the land in  question was acquired."
"In  Sarath  Hulangamuwa  v.  Siriwardena,  Principal,  Visakha  Vidyalaya,  Colombo  5  and 5  others"
"[(1986) 1 SrLL.R.  275] it was held that certiorari being a discretionary remedy will not be granted"
"where there was delay in  seeking the remedy."
