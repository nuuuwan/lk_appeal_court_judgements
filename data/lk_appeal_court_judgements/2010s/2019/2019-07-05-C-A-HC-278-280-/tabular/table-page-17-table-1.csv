"""The doctrine of Res Judicata,  based on the two Latin maxims  ''Nemo debet"
"vis  vexari  pro  una  et  eadem  causa""  and  ''Interest  republicae  ut  sit jinis"
"litium"",  is  a plea which  bars subsequent action  on the same cause of action"
"between  the  same parties on  the ground that the  matter has  been judicially"
"determined and is  a safeguard against unnecessary litigation over the same"
"matter.  The doctrine operates when the following essentials are present;"
