"law and grounds of appeal at the stage of argument. I will list them below as it was"
"submitted in the argument and in the written submissions."
"For the 1st Appellant"
"1.  Exclusion of video evidence"
"2.  Flows in the 'chain' relating to the dispatch and receipt of productions to and"
"from the Government Analyst"
"3.  Misdirection with regard to the burden of proof"
"4.  Omission to permit production of the bed"

"that cast a doubt as to  the credibility of the witnesses regarding the manner"
"in which the appellants were arrested"
"2.  The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider evidence favourable to the"
"defence  that  the  IBs  pertaining  to  this  case  maintained  by  the  PNB  were"
"tampered."
"3.  The  video  pertaining  to 
the 
incident  was  unreasonably  shut  out  by  the"
"Learned High Court Judge."
"4.  The Learned High Court Judge failed to take  into account that certain inter"
"say contradictions occasioned a failure of justice"
"5.  Evidence  of Latheef, 
the  three-wheeler  driver  who  saw  the 
incident  of"
"abduction of the 2nd  appellant was unreasonably rejected."
"6.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge
