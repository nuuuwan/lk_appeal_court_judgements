to  04,  raised  by  the"
"Learned President's Counsel for the 3rd  appellant should fail."
"Both the Learned President's Counsel  for  the  1 st  and 2nd  appellants  submitted that"
"the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  take  into  account  that  certain  inter-say"
"contradictions  occasioned a failure  of justice.  They contended that there  had been"
"misdirection  with regard to  the  burden of proof.  It was  further  contended that the"
"Learned High  Court Judge  failed  to  consider certain  items  of evidence that  cast a"
"doubt  as  to  the  credibility  of the  witnesses  regarding  the  manner  in  which  the"
"appellants  were  arrested.  The  Learned  President's  Counsel  for  the  2nd  appellant"
"contended that evidence of Latheef,  the  three-wheeler driver who  saw the  incident"
"of  abduction  of the  2nd  appellant  and 
the  evidence  of  defence  witness  Sunil"
"Fonseka  alias  Patta's  were  unreasonably  rejected  by 
the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge."
"The  defence  witness,  abdul 
latheef,  had  known  the  2nd  appellant  for  about  6"
"months.  According  to  him  some  people  had  come  in  a  white  van  on  28.11.2003"
"around  9.30am  and  had  pointed  a  pistol  at  the  2nd  appellant  and  thereafter  had"
"pushed him to the rear seat of the  trishaw [vol.  3- pages  405,  406,  407].  However"
"the  Learned  ASG 
for 
the 
respondents 
submitted 
that 
said  witness  Latheef"
"contradicts defence witness  Sunil who testified that the  2nd  accused was assaulted,"
"hand cuffed and was put into the van [vol.  3 -page 285].  It is noteworthy that said"
"Latheef did not even inform the police  about the  alleged abduction that had taken"
"place  in  broad  day  light.  At  this  point,  the  Learned High  Court Judge  considered"
"how Latheef was  able to note  down the trishaw number of the 2nd  appellant given"
"that  the  white  van  was  going  behind  the  said  trishaw.  Accordingly  the  Learned"
"High Court Judge was of the view that the version of the Latheef was questionable"
"and not creditworthy."
