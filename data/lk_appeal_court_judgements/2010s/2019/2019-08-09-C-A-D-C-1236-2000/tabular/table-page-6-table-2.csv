"Full  Bench  Case  of Alwis v. Perera  [1  (1919) 21  N. lo  R. at 326.] :"
""" I wish very much that District Judges-I speak not particularly, but generally-when"
"a witness says  'I  possessed' or 'We  possessed' or 'We took the produce',  would"
"not confine themselves  merely to recording the words,  but would insi st  on  those"
"words being explained  and  exemplified . I wish  District Judges would abandon the"
"present  practice  of simply  recording these  words  when  stated  by the witnesses,"
"and  would  see  that such  fact s as  the witnesses  have  in  their minds are  stated  in"
"full and  appear in the record.  """""
