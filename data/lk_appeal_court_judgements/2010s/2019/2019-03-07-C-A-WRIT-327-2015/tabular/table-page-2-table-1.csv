"By the second amended petition, the petitioner seeks to issue a"
"writ  of  certiorari  quashing  the  interdiction  letters  whereby  he"
"was 
interdicted  pending  disciplinary 
inquiry,  and  also 
the"
"proceedings  of  the  disciplinary  inquiry  conducted  against  him"
"up  to  that  point;  and  to  issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  compelling"
"the  1st  respondent  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to"
"reinstate the petitioner in the post of Grama Niladhari."
"Pending determination of this action, after the conclusion of the"
"disciplinary  inquiry,  the  petitioner  has  been  reinstated  in  the"
"post  of  Grama  Niladhari  by  the  1st  respondent  by  R10  dated"
"10.01.2016  subject 
to 
the 
transfer 
to  a  different  Divisional"
"Secretariat within Ampara District and  subject to the following:"
"(a) 
salary  arrears  will  not  be  paid  during 
the  period 
of"
"interdiction 
(b) 
three  salary 
increments  will  be  differed 
(c)"
"Rs.30,000/= will be charged."
"By paragraph 9 of the reply submissions dated 08.01.2019, the"
"petitioner  has  stated  that  as  he  has  been  reinstated,  he  is  not"
"challenging the interdiction further."
"The  mandamus  compelling 
reinstatement  has  also  become"
"redundant."
"Then  the  remaining  matter  is  whether  he  can  pursue  the  other"
"relief,  i.e.  the  vague  relief  of  quashing  the  proceedings  of  the"
"disciplinary inquiry conducted until the filing of this application."
"In  paragraph  14  of  the  counter  affidavit,  the  petitioner  has"
"stated  that  he  appealed  against  the  said  order  marked  R10  to"
