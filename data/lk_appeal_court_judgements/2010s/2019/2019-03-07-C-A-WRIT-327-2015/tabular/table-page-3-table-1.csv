"t
he  Public  Service  Commission.    That  goes  to  show  that  the"
"aforesaid remaining relief has no basis."
"The contention of the petitioner seems to be that the disciplinary"
"inquiry  was  not  concluded  within  one  year  as  per  the  circular"
"marked P12.  Nowhere in P12 does it state that the disciplinary"
"proceedings become null and void unless it is concluded exactly"
"within one year.  It cannot be construed in that manner."
"It  is  regrettable  that  the  petitioner  wanted  to  proceed  with  the"
"application even after he was reinstated.  His application at least"
"from that point is baseless."
"I dismiss the application with costs."
