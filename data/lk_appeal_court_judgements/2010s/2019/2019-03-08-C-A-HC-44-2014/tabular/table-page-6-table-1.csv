"Therefore,  it is  not proper  to  trifle  with  this  type  of offences  and  to"
"allow  people  to  commit offences  and  escape  lightly.  I hold  that  the"

On  sentencing  an  Accused,  His  Lordship  Basnayake,  A.C.J. 
in  The"
"Attorney General, and  H.N.  De Silva,  (S.C 457-Application in  Revision) said;"
"itA  judge  should, 
in  determining  the  proper  sentence,  first  consider"
"the  gravity  of the  offence  as  it  appears  from 
the  nature  of the  act"
"itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in  the Penal"
"Code  or other statute under which  the offender is  charged.  He  should"
"also  regard the effect of the punishment as a  deterrent and consider"
"to  what extent it will be effective .
...  The  reformation  of the criminal,"
"though  no  doubt  an  important  consideration,  is  subordinate  to  the"
"others I have mentioned.  Where  the public interest or welfare of the"
"state 
(which 
are 
synonymous) 
outweighs 
the 
previous 
good"
"character,  antecedents  and  the  age  of the  offender,  public  interest"
"must prevail. /I"
"17.  There  should  be  parity  in  sentencing.  Disparity and  inconsistency  will"
"lead  to criticism.  Accused  as  well  as  the  Complainant  is  entitled to 
know"
"the  reason  for  the  sentence  and  how the  Court  arrived  at  the  same.  An"
"Accused,  or for that matter even  the general  public should  know what the"
"range  of a  sentence  would  be 
in  a  case  of child  rape  depending  on  the"
"aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances.  There  should  not  be  a  huge"
"disparity."
