On  Count  No.3, the  Respondent  was  charged  for rape.  Rape  is  the"
"most serious sexual  offence.  It aggravates  when  it is  committed on a child."
"The 
legislature 
taking 
the  seriousness  of  the  offence 
into  account  has"
"prescribed  a  minimum  mandatory  imprisonment  sentence  of  10  years."
"Prescribed  sentence  for  rape  of a child  in  terms  of section  364(2)  of the"
"Penal  code  is  rigorous  imprisonment for a term  not less  than  10 years  and"
