"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The 2nd respondent-petitioner-appellant (appellant) has filed this"
"appeal  against  the  Judgment  of  the  High  Court  which  affirmed"
"the order of the Magistrate’s Court delivered under section 66 of"
"the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"The Magistrate’s Court held with the 1st respondent-respondent-"
"respondent (respondent) who is a sister of the appellant."
"The  dispute  relates  to  a  room  of  a  house  which  was  padlocked"
"by the appellant after the death of their father on the basis that"
"the  father  gifted  the  property  to  the  appellant  by  way  a  Deed."
"This  has  happened  within 
two  months 
before 
filing 
the"
"application in Court by the police."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  the  impugned  Judgment  has"
"correctly  analyzed  the  facts  of  the  case  when  she  affirmed  the"
"order of the Magistrate’s Court.  There is no necessity to repeat"
"them here."
"The  pivotal  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant"
"before  this  Court  is  that  the  order  of  the  Magistrate’s  Court"
"cannot  be  allowed  to  stand  in  view  of  the  agreement  reached"
"between the parties to accept an order after a site inspection by"
"the 
learned  Magistrate. 
 
It 
is  the  contention  of  the 
learned"
"counsel 
that  notwithstanding  site 
inspection  was  done, 
the"
"learned Magistrate has delivered the order without any reference"
"to the site inspection."
