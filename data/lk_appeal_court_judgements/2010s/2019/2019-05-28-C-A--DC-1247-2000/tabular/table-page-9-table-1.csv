"But a mere assertion of fraud in the pleadings or issues will not suffice. In the case before"
"me,  the identity of the  person whose  act  is  alleged  or tainted as  fraudulent  is  scarcely"
"apparent upon  the  pleadings  or  evidence.  How did  any  specific  act  of  fraud which is"
"attributed to anyone in particular vitiate the deed of 1938?  I find no credible evidence of"
"fraud  proved against  anyone and  I see  no  reason  to disturb  the  answer to the  issue  of"
"fraud given  in the case  even  though  the  learned  District Judge  has  not indulged in  an"
"incisive analysis of the question of fraud. If the answer to an issue is supportable having"
"regard to the material on record, a mere want of discussion on the evidence surrounding"
"the issue is not per se a ground to vitiate the judgment in appeal."
"In  any event my  next discussion  on Section  68  of the  Partition Law No.21  of 1977 will"
"show that the impugned deed P3 remains proved by operation of law.  I would however"
"proceed  to state on the  question  of  fraud  that whoever  asserts  the fact  of fraud  must"
"establish the fact  and  Sections 101  and 103  of the  Evidence  Ordinance would place the"
"legal burden of proving fraud on the Defendant, because it is him who has put it in issue."
"The above account is certainly true for  rei vindicatio  actions as  well as for partition suits."
"But on the facts and circumstances of the case before me, the Defendant~Appellants have"
"failed to establish fraud and as it would be abundantly clear upon the evidence given by"
"the  3rd  Defendant~Appellant alone,  it  is  the  due  execution  of  Deed  P3  that  has  been"
"established rather than the allegation of fraud.  In any event it was only after a lapse of 58"
"years after its execution that the deed of 1938  (P3) was first  challenged as fraudulent in"
"the  answer filed  on  25.03.1996  and  the  case  of  Ranasinghe v.  De Silva  78  N.LR 500"
"would bar even a collateral attack on the deed."
