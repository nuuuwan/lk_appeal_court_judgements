"Due execution in Partit ion suits"
"In Sri Lanka there are various special statutes under which rules of evidence are provided"
"for  specific matters, and the special provisions prevail over the general provisions of the"
"Evidence  Ordinance,  in case of any  inconsistency~Generalia specialibus  non  derogant.  Thus"
"for  partition suits, Section  68  of the Evidence Ordinance has not been fully  transported"
"as such into the Partition Law No.21 of 1977 and it is Section 68 of  Partition Law No.21 of"
"1977 that governs the question of due execution in partition cases."
"In order to buttress the argument that within its parameters Section 68 of Partition Law"
"No.21  of 1977 prevails  over  Section  68  of the  Evidence  Ordinance,  Salam, J.  referred  to"
"two maxims in  Wimalawathie v.  Hemawathie and Others (2009) 1 Sri.LR  95  at p.99"
"namely  Lex posterior derogate priori  and  leges  posteriors priores  contrarias  abrogant~later laws"
"repeal earlier laws inconsistent therewith in order"
"The earlier Act  (Sec.68  of the  Evidence Ordinance)  must give  way to a later enactment"
