"question to pose in terms  of Section 68  is-Does the 3rd  Defendant claim adversely to the"
"Plaintiff who produced P3?"
"As  Mr. Champaka Ladduwahetty rightly pointed out,  the 3rd Defendant who holds 3V3"
"is not a party claiming adversely to the Plaintiff who produced P3, because the deed 3V3"
"from  which  the  3rd  Defendant  claimed  his  rights  does  not  deal  with  the  same  rights"
"already dealt with by the deed P3,  20 years earlier. By the deed P3 which was executed"
"in 1938, A viya alias Saima transferred his paternal rights to Obia. By the deed 3V3, which"
"was  executed  in  1958,  Aviya  is  said  to  have  transferred  his  maternal  inheritance  to"
"Santhiya-the father of the 3rd Defendant. Whilst P3 transferred paternal inheritance, 3V3"
"transmitted maternal inheritance.  In other words  P3  and 3V3  are not competing deeds"
"and therefore  3V3  cannot  claim  anything  adverse  to  P3.  In  the circumstances  the  2nd"
"limb of Section 68 of the Partition Law, No.21 of 1977 namely the genuineness of the deed"
"must be impeached by a party claiming adversely to it does not apply in this case and one"
"cannot then argue that deed P3 has not been proved.  On the contrary, in light of Section"
"68 of the Partition Law No.21 of 1977, this deed must be deemed to have been proved."
"In fact Kittha (the mother of A viya) had long disposed of her rights by PI of 09.02.1925 to"
"Gunaya  and  if  at  all, it  is  with  this  deed  of  1925  that  the  deed  3V3  would  actually"
"compete.  P2  and P4  too  transferred what would have been  the maternal inheritance of"
"A viya  and  3V3  could  be  said to compete with those  deeds  too  as  they  dealt with the"
"same  subject-matter-maternal  inheritance.  The  mother  Kiththa  had  disposed  of  her"
"inheritance by PI in 1925 and the son A viya could not have had any maternal inheritance"
"to transmit in 1958.  It is noteworthy that Aviya could not have transferred what he says"
"he had transferred in 3V3 when  his  mother had  already  dealt with her entire rights in"
"1925."
"A perusal of deed 3V3 really shows that what had been purported to be transferred were"
"not the rights transferred by P3 but different rights."
