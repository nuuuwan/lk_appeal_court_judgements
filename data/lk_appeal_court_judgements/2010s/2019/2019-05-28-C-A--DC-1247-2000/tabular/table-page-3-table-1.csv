"As the table No.1 indicates, Kiththa (the widow of Babiya) had transferred her l/6th  share"
"by PI  to Muthugal Pedige Gunaya who later transferred it to Obia by P2, and thereafter"
"Obia  transferred a l/3rd  share to Mangalika-the Plaintiff by P4.  Obia was able to transfer"
"a  l/3rd  share  to the  Plaintiff in 1980  because by the year  1938  she had already got  l/6th"
"share of A viya by P3."
"In other words the 1/6th  share which had devolved on  the son Aviya  was transferred by"
"Aviya by Deed No.11588 dated 27.04.1938  (P3) to Muthugal Pedige Obia, who upon this"
"transfer became entitled  to  l/3rd  share  of  the  corpus,  which the  original  owner Babiya"
"had. Muthugal Pedige Obia thereafter by Deed No.2139 dated 21.09.1988 (P4) transferred"
"the l/3rd of this land to Munasinghe Arachchige Milinona-the Plaintiff in the case."
"From  the  above  narrative  of  devolution  which is  apparent upon  the  table  above,  one"
"could see that at the time of execution of the Deed No.11588  on 27.04.1938  (P3), it was"
"the paternal inheritance of Aviya which was transferred by that deed to Mutugal Pedige"
"Obia."
