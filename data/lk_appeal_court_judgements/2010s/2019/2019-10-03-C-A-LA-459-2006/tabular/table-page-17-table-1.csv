"can also be set aside by the District Court itself  as one  entered"

"Jeyaraj  Fernandopulle  v.  Premachandra15  which  reiterated  the"
"well-established principle that “The Court has inherent powers to"
"correct decisions made per incuriam.”"
"I find it difficult to bring myself to accept that line of argument"
