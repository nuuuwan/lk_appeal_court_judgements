"dated  04.11.1998  and  the  order  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  dated"
"07.03.2002."
"When  summons  has  not  been 
issued,  Udalagama  J.  states,"
"section 48(4) could not bar the District Court from holding that"
"such  non-issue  was  improper  or  the  Court  in  such  instances"
"had no jurisdiction to proceed."
"It  is  noteworthy  that  there  is  a  distinction  between  non-service"
"of summons to a party to the case and failure to make a person"
"a  party  to  the  case.  Service  of  summons  does  not  arise  in  the"
"latter  instance  as  summons  is  issued  only  on  a  party  to  the"
"case. 
The 
Partition 
Law 
has 
provided 
for 
both 
those"
"contingencies."
"Under section 48(4)(a)(i), when summons has not been served on"
"a party, that party can seek “special leave” within the stipulated"
"time to establish the right, title or interest of such party to or in"
"the 
land  to  be  partitioned  notwithstanding  the 
Interlocutory"
"Decree had already been entered.  But, as I have already stated,"
"the  person  who  applied  the  District  Judge  to  set  aside  the"
"Interlocutory Decree in Umma v. Subir was not a party.  Nor did"
"he  challenge  the  Interlocutory  Decree  under  section  48(5)  on"
"lack of jurisdiction."
"Once the Interlocutory Decree is entered, the District Court has"
"no 
jurisdiction  to  set 
it  aside  otherwise  than 
in  the 
limited"
"circumstances stipulated in section 48(4) and (5) of the Partition"
"Law.   The  District Court cannot  set aside Interlocutory Decrees"
"by  way  of  revision  or 
invoking 
restitutio 
in 
integrum  or  by"
"inherent powers of the Court to avert miscarriage of justice or to"
