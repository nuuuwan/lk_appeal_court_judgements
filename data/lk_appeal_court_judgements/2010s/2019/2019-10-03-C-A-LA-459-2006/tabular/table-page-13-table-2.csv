"the Judgment.  Weerasuriya J. on behalf of the Supreme Court"
"(with S.N. Silva C.J. and Ismail J. agreeing) stated11:"
"It 
is  significant 
that  section  48(1)  of 
the  Partition  Law  gives"
"final and conclusive effect to the interlocutory decree subject to the"
"decision on any appeal which may be preferred therefrom and sub"
"section  (4)  as  referred  to  earlier.  Having  regard  to  the  stringent"
"provisions  of  section  48  of  the  Partition  Law  which  had  as  their"
"object  the  finality  of  the 
interlocutory  decree  it 
is  obvious  that"
"learned  District  Judge  had  acted 
in  blatant  disregard  of 
the"
"provisions of section 48."
"On a consideration of the above material it would be manifest that"
"District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application of the"
"petitioner-respondent-respondents  to  seek  the  relief  they  prayed"
"for and the application was misconceived. The Court of Appeal has"
"taken  the  erroneous  view  that  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of"
"section  48,  learned  District  Judge  was  justified  in  restricting  the"
"corpus to 30 acres using the inherent powers of Court in terms"
"of  section  839  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  For  the  foregoing"
"reasons I hold that the Court of Appeal has erred in affirming the"
"order  of  the  District  Judge  which  was  patently  outside  his"
"jurisdiction. Therefore, I set aside the order of the District Judge"
