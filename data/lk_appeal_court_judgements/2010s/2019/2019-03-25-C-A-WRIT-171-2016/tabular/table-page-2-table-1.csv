"Sri Lanka Navy and was functioning as the Second in Command"
"of 
the  English  Learning  Teaching  School  of

"Maritime  Academy,  Trincomalee  when  he  was  informed  (in  my"
"view indirectly) by P12 and P13 that he was sent on compulsory"
"unpaid leave effective from 23.05.2016.  He does not know why"
"he  was  so  sent  on  compulsory  unpaid  leave  for  an  unspecified"
"period.    By  looking  at  P12  and  P13  even  the  Court  cannot  get"
"any clue about it—P12 is a Navy General Signal which cannot be"

"having  acted  arbitrarily”  or 
“will  be 
found 
to  have  acted"
"unlawfully.”"
