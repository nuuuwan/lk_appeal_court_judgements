"","with the knife and the Appellant had  been waiting with the sword to prevent"
"","others coming.  Appellant had prevented the witness going near the deceased"
"","to  prevent  the  fight.  Appellant  had  tried  to  assault  him  and  he  had  run  to"

"04.","PW3  when giving evidence had tried to avoid testifying. He even had denied"
"","making a statement to  the  police.  Finally,  upon admitting giving a statement"

incident,  he 
said 
that  1 sl  Accused  and 
the 
about  06  months  after"
"","Appellant  came  in  his  three-wheeler to  the  restaurant.  He  initially  said  that"
"","the  1 sl  Accused and  the Appellant did  not  possess  weapons. At this  point  in"

"","was doubtful that he would appear in  Court to  give evidence. Although PW3"
