"13.","Counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  contended 
that 
the  Prosecution  has  failed 
to"
"","establish the  causation of death of the deceased  beyond reasonable  doubt.  It"
"","is further argued that the medical evidence does not corroborate the evidence"
"","of eye witnesses."
"14.","PW14  Dr.  Kumudu  Kumari  Jusar  has  testified  on  the  injuries  observed  on"
"","the deceased by Dr.Athukorala when the deceased was initially hospitalized."
"","Upon  death  of the  deceased, the  autopsy was conducted  by  Dr. Indra Lalani"
"","Ratnayake.  According  to  her  evidence,  the  deceased  had  been  admitted  to"
"","National  Hospital 
initially  on  20.10.2010.  After  03  weeks  he  had  been"
"","transferred  to  Negombo  hospital  and  then  again  was  admitted  to  National"
"","hospital  on  11.06.2011.  Patient  had  died  on  08.08 .2011.  She  gave  clear"
"","evidence that the cause of death of the deceased was  'hydrocephalus' , which"
"","is  collection of fluid  in the  brain. She had  said that it was due  to  the  injuries"
"","caused  to  the  head. Further  she  had  said  that  the  brain  particles  were  dead"
"","due  to  the  assault on  the  head.  She  further  said  that the  deceased  had  been"
"","continuously  unconscious  from  the  20.10.2010  till  he  died.  Therefore,  it  is"
"","clear  that  the  deceased  died  due  to  the  injuries  caused  by  the  1st  Accused"
"","with the shared common intention with the Appellant."
"15.","The  learned  High  Court Judge  in  his judgment at  page 214  of the  brief has"
