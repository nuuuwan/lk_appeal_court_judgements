"It was contended before this Court that if the 1st  Defendant had sub~let the premises to"
"the 2nd Defendant without the prior written approval of the Plaintiff, the 1st  Defendant"
"had infringed the provisions of Section 10(2) of the Rent Act.  The cause of action arises"
"from the mere fact of subletting andin such a situation it was contended that no notice of"
"termination of a tenancy was  necessary before  an  action for  ejectment on the basis  of"
"sublettingwas instituted."
"The  learned' Counsel for  the  Plaintiff~Appellant cited  Wimalasooriya  v.  Ponniah  52"
"N.LR 191  wherein it has  been held,  inter alia,  that,  ""where  a  tenant  sub~let the leased"
"premises in contravention of section 9 of the Rent Restriction Act,  No.29  of 1948,  the"
"landlord  is  entided  to  institute  proceedings  in  ejectment  without  terminating  the"
"tenancy by notice"".  Section 9 of the Rent Restriction Act,  No.29  of 1948 is identical to"
"Section 10 of the Rent Act."
"I  take  the  view  that  the  learned  District Judge  was  in  error  on  this  question  of law"
"namely  termination of  tenancy was  mandatory before  action was filed  on  the basis  of"
"su b~ letting."
"The  question  then  arises  whether  sub~letting has  been  established  within  the  four"
"comers of Section 10(2) of the Rent Act.  It is the decision of the learned District Judge"
"that the Plaintiff has not established the conditions stipulated in Section 10(2) of the said"
"Rent Act."
"Turning to evidence one finds  that the Plaintiff's son Mohamed Akbar testified that the"
"1
st Defendant had sub~let the said premises to the 2nd Defendant to carry on a business of"
"a jewelry workshop~see pages 76, 79 83 and 84 of the Appeal Brief."
"This  evidence  was  corroborated  by 
the 
testimony  of  Gurubavila  Lekamlage  Don"
"Karunadasa who stated that he had provided security services to the jewelry workshop"
"and a document detailing the relevant Security Services Agreement was marked as Y ~see"
"pages  122  and 123  of the Appeal  Brief,  and  document  marked  ""Y"" at page  297  of  the"
