"The learned trial Judge has also not considered the fact that the 1st Defendant had passed"
"away and only his widow gave evidence. Even though she merely denied sub letting, she"
"has not explained how her husband ran a loud speaker hiring business, whilst working"
"as a security guard."
"The learned trial Judge has also stated that this action has been filed as an ejectment and"
"damages action but it should have been filed a rent and ejectment action, and therefore"
"the Plaintiff from the beginning has based his case on a wrong footing~vide page 166."
"But upon a perusal of the plaint it is clear  that the said premises is governed by the Rent"
"Act and the 1st  Defendant was  the tenant of the Plaintiff,  and it was established at the"
"trail  that the 1st  Defendant had  sub~let the said premises  to the  2nd  Defendant.  In  the"
"circumstances  one  cannot proceed  to dismiss  the  Plaintiff as  defective  merely  because"
"the  caption of the plaint  states  ejectment  and damages.  It is  the fact  in issue  and the"
"evidence led thereon which brings out the scope and nature of the action."
"After  the  plaint  had been  accepted  and  a  trial  had proceeded  on  the  said plaint,  one"
"cannot now classify the plaint as defective."
"A perusal of the admissions and issues clearly bring out the scope of the action~see page"
"66.  Issue No.2 is in relation to sub~letting of the said premises to the 2nd Defendant. The"
"trial had proceeded on the said issues and it is axiomatic that once the issues are raised"
"pleadings recede to the background~see Dharmasiri v.  Wickrematunga (2002) 2 Sri L.R"
