"2.  Refusal to permit summoning of witnesses"
"This  is  another  complaint  that  was  made  on  behalf the  Defendant'Appellant.  It  was"
"submitted  that  the  learned  District  Judge  of  Matale  refused  the  application  of  the"
"Defendant'Appellant  to  call  another witness  and as  a  result  the  Defendant'Appellant"
