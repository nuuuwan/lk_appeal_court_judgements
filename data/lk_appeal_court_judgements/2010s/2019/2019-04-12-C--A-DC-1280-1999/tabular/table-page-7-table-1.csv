"Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  entire  claim  of  the  2nd"
"Defendant-Respondent is based on the premise that Deed P6 by which"
"he conveyed the land and premises to Odayan Kureishan was subject to"
"an  oral  agreement  to  re-convey  upon  repayment  of  the  consideration"
"which was purported to be a loan.  However, this Court is in a view that"
"the 2nd Defendant-Respondent was not intensely entitled to lead parole"
"evidence 
to  establish 
the  purported  oral  agreements  with  Odayan"
"Kureishan to re-convey the property."
"Therefore, I am of the view that the learned District Judge had failed to"
"concentrate  on  the  fact  that  the  2nd  Defendant  has  failed  miserably  to"
"establish  on  the  parole  evidence  led,  the  existence  of  any  such  oral"
"agreement with Odayan Kureishan."
"In  the  aforesaid  reasons, 
I  proceed  to  set  aside 
the  District  Court"
"judgment  dated  25.06.1999,  and  grant  the  reliefs  to  the  Appellant"
"sought in the Plaint."
"I make no order as to costs."
