"the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration.‚Äù"
"Counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent was submitted that, in order to establish"
"a constructive trust in terms of the above section, the law requires to prove that the"
"consideration  mentioned  in  the  deed  in  question  had  been  paid  or  provided  by  a"
"person  other  than  the  original  transfer  in  a  deed  of  transfer  and  also  that  other"
"person who paid the consideration did not intend to give the beneficial interest to"
"the transferee of the property subjected to in that deed. When such circumstances"
"are established then it is that other person who paid or provided the consideration"
"has the right to claim that the person who provided the money and not to the Hinni"
"Appuhamy or his children."
"Further, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent brought an interesting fact that in any event"
"the Appellant who was only 4 years old at the time of the conditional transfer was"
"made  and  he  was  not  able  or  not  in  a  position  to  lead  evidence,  that  there  were"
"attendant circumstances to the alleged trust."
"It was in those circumstances, the learned District Judge has reached a conclusion"
"that the Appellant has failed to indicate the attendant circumstances in his plaint to"
"prove that there is a trust in favour of Hinni Appuhamy and his heirs."
"Therefore,  the  learned  District  Judge  has  correctly  held  that  the  Samarapala  has"
"obtained good title to the land by land by Deed of Transfer No. 1118 executed for"
