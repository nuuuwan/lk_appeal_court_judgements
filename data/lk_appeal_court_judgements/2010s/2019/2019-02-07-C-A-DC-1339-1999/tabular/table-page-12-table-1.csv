"ection 84 of the Trusts Ordinance reads thus:"
"“Where  property  is  transferred  to  one  person  for  a  consideration"
"paid or provided by another person, and it appears that such other"
"person  did  not  intend  to  pay  or  provide  such  consideration  for  the"
"benefit  of  the  transferee,  the  transferee  must  hold  the  property  for"
"the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration.”"
