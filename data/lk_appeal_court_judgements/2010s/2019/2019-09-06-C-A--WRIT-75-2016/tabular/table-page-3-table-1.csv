"T
he  5th  Respondent  with  his  objections  has  tendered  several"
"documents to this Court to say that Jayaratnam sold the land to"
"his  father,  Annalingam.    This  is  denied  by  the  Petitioner.    This"
"Court  cannot  decide  on 
those  vital  matters,  which  are 
in"
"dispute."
"After the civil war was over, P7 decision has been taken, on the"
"directions  given  by  the  1st  Respondent  by  1R1. 
  The  1st-4th"
"Respondents 
inform  Court 
that 
the  relevant  old  documents"
"relating to this land are non-existent due to long-drawn out civil"
"war, which is understandable."
"I do not think that the decision P7 is arbitrary or unjustifiable."
"It  is  in  consonance  with  written  guidelines  contained  in  1R1"
"circular.  This  Court 
in  exercising  writ 
jurisdiction  has  no"
"mandate 
to 
find 
the  best  solution 
to 
the  problem. 
  Hence"
"certiorari cannot be issued to quash P7."
"The Petitioner has obviously no legal right to the performance of"
"a legal duty by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents to give the entire"
"land on long-term lease only to the Petitioner. Hence mandamus"
"does not lie."
"The Petitionerâ€™s application is dismissed without costs."
