"by the Defendant. Lot 2 therefore cries out for an exclusion but the learned District Judge"
"just brushed aside this question of adverse possession that had surfaced to the fore."
"Instead the learned District Judge goes on the basis that what Sopina (the predecessor in"
"title of the Plaintiff) passed to the Plaintiff by way of PI dealt with the entire land (Lot 1,"
"2 and 3), whereas it is quite clear upon the evidence of Sopina herself that she could not"
"have  passed Lot  2 to the Plaintiff (P2 is  dated 04.04.1977).  By  04.04.1997,  the separate"
"possession of Lot 2 on the part of the Defendant was almost 15 years."
"I have examined the evidence given on behalf of both the Plaintiff and Defendant and I"
"find that the elements of adverse possession necessary to give rise to prescription are rife"
"in this case and a case for an exclusion of Lot 2 was thus made out. This appears to me as"
"a manifest error in the judgment that has to be remedied in this jurisdiction."
