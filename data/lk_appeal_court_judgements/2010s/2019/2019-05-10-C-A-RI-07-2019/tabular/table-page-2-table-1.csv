"Samayawardhena, J."
"Learned counsel for the petitioner was extensively heard."
"The  1st  defendant-petitioner  has 
filed 
this 
application 
for"
"restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside (as seen from the reliefs"
"prayed  for  in  the  prayer  to  the  petition)  the  Judgment  of  the"
"District  Court  pronounced  as 
far  back 
in  1979  and 
the"
"Interlocutory Decree entered thereon and to order trial de novo."
"The  1st  defendant 
in  the  petition  has  mentioned  a  spate  of"
"(vague, as opposed to specific)  grounds  seeking  to set aside the"
"Judgment entered 40 years ago."
"However,  the  main  complaint  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  1st"
"defendant 
is 
that 
the  District  Judge 
in  his  Judgment  has"
"partitioned a land larger to the one described in the schedule to"
"the  plaint,  and  therefore  the  Judgment  cannot  be  allowed  to"
"stand."
"After the pronouncement of the Judgment, the 1st defendant has"
"come  before  this  Court  by  way  of  final  appeal  against  the  said"
"Judgment mainly on the same ground as seen from the Petition"
"of  Appeal  found  in  the  Brief.    Although  a  copy  of  the  Appeal"
"Judgment is not found in the Brief,  the learned counsel for the"
"1st  defendant  admits  that  the  appeal  was  dismissed  by  this"
"Court."
"If  that  is  the  position,  the  1st  defendant  cannot,  so  many  years"
"after the said dismissal, again come before this Court by way of"
"restitutio  in  integrum  seeking  the  same  relief  basically  on  the"
"same ground.  That is plan law."
