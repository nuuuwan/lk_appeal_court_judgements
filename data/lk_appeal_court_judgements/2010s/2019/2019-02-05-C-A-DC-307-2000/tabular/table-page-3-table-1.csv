"o
wners 
against 
whom 
Siriwardena 
maintained 
adverse"
"possession  if  he  were  to  acquire  prescriptive  rights  to  the  land."
"As held in Sirajudeen v. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri LR 365 “A facile story"
"of  walking  into  abandoned  premises  after  the  Japanese  air  raid"
"constitutes  material  far  too  slender  to  found  a  claim  based  on"
"prescriptive  title.”   The 2nd  defendant pretends to be unaware of"
"any such owner or owners.  The 2nd defendant’s evidence on the"
"question  of  prescription,  as 
the 
learned  District  Judge  has"
"correctly pointed out, is plainly unacceptable."
"As seen from the Birth Certificate 2V3, the 2nd defendant is not a"
"child  of  Siriwardena.    The  2nd  defendant  was  born  after  the"
"death  of  Siriwardena  as  a  child  to  the  widow  of  Siriwardena."
"This finding of the learned District Judge2 is not disputed before"
"this  Court.    The  2nd  defendant  does  not  claim  any  rights  by"
"inheritance."
"According  to  the  evidence  led,  the  conclusion  of  the  learned"
"District  Judge  that  the  2nd  defendant  possessed  an  undefined"
"portion of the land with the leave and licence of the co-owners of"
"the land is justifiable.  To put differently, the 2nd defendant  had"
"been  in  possession  of  an  undivided  portion  of  the  land  (vide"
"Preliminary  Plan)  without  any  objection 
from 
the  other  co-"
"owners."
"Long  permissive  possession 
is  not  prescriptive  possession."
"Permissive  possession  to  become  adverse  possession  to  claim"
"prescriptive 
possession, 
there 
shall 
be 
compelling 
cogent"
"evidence. 
 
In 
that  setting, 
firstly, 
the  2nd  defendant  must"
"establish a starting point by an overt act of ouster (as opposed to"
"a  secret  intention  in  mind)  for  his  acquisition  of  prescriptive"
"2 Vide page 135 of the Brief."
