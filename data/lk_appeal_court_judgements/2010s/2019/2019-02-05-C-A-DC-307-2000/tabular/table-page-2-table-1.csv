"The  plaintiff 
filed 
this  action  seeking 
to  partition 
the 
land"
"depicted  in  the  Preliminary  Plan  according  to  the  pedigree  set"
"out  in  the  plaint.    After  trial  the  learned  District  Judge  entered"
"Judgment  dated  22.05.2000.    The  2nd  defendant  who  has  not"
"been given any soil rights in the corpus has filed this appeal."
"The  position  of  the  2nd  defendant  taken  up  at  the  trial  as"
"crystallized in issues was that Siriwardena became the owner of"
"the  entire  land  to  be  partitioned  by  prescription,  and  thereafter"
"that 
right 
devolved 
on 
the 
1st 
and 
2nd 
defendants 
and"
"Siriwardenaâ€™s children.   In other words,  it is the position of the"
"2nd defendant that Siriwardena was the sole owner of the land."
"According to the pedigree of the plaintiff, Siriwardena was one of"
"the  three  children  of  Dingiri  Appu  and  the  other  two  children"
"being Punchi Appuhamy and John Singho.  The 2nd defendant in"
"cross 
examination  has 
admitted 
that  Siriwardena,  Punchi"
"Appuhamy and John Singho were siblings.1  Punchi Appuhamy"
"has  transferred  his  undivided  1/3  share  by  Deed  marked  P1"
"executed  in  1968  to  Somaratne,  and  Somaratne  has  in  turn"
"transferred  that  share  to  the  plaintiff  by  Deed  P2.    The  learned"
"District  Judge  has  accepted 
that  position. 
  That 
finding 
is"
"entirely in consonance with the evidence led at the trial."
"Although  the  2nd  defendant  states  that  Siriwardena  was  the"
"owner of the entire land by prescription, he does not know how"
"Siriwardena  acquired  prescriptive  rights 
to 
the  entire 
land."
"Siriwardena  could  not  have  acquired  prescriptive  rights  to  the"
"entire land in the air.   There should have been a true owner or"
