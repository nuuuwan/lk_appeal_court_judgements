"I
  am  afraid  I  cannot  agree  with  that  argument.  The  test  of"
"Soertsz  J.  is  not  that  simple—“a  taxpayer  to  be  classified  as  a"
"to 
that  argument,  a 
business  or  an 
individual”.  According"
"company  is  not  caught  up  either  in  section  6(1)(a)  or  section"
"6(1)(e),  as  it  is  neither  a  “business”  nor  an  “individual”!  There"
"cannot be any dispute that a “business” can be carried on by a"
"“company” or an “individual” (if a company cannot be considered"
"an individual)."
"The  missing 
of 
the  words 
after 
the  word 
“or 
company”"
"“individual” need not be given undue importance. By reading the"
"Judgment  of  Soertsz  J.  as  a  whole,  I  have  no  scintilla  of  doubt"
"that  Soertsz  J.  never  intended  to  make  a  distinction  between  a"
"company and an individual. The gist of the test of Soertsz J., is:"
"if 
interest  appertains  to  a  business,  the 
interest 
falls  under"
"section  6(1)(a);  if  interest  appertains  to  an  individual  not  in  the"
"course  of  business,  but  as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple"
"investments, then the interest falls under section 6(1)(e)."
"Here “individual” means “person”, which includes “a company or"
"body of persons or any government”.6"
"The 
test  of  Soertsz  J. 
is  substantially  similar 
to 
the  one"
"suggested by Howard C.J. and Keuneman J."
"In my view, the Judgment of Ceylon Financial Investments Ltd. v."
"Commissioner of Income Tax does not favour the appellant."
"It appears that the present trend seems to be to apply the test of"
"to  resolve 
this 
issue,  which 
“integral  part  of 
the  business”"
