"Magistrate‟s Court of Kaduwela seeking an order to implement the aforesaid"
"impugn arbitral award."
"When 
the  above  matter  was 
taken  up  before 
the 
learned  Magistrate  of"
"Kaduwela  on  24.07.2017,  the  learned  Magistrate  had  directed  the  parties  to"
"conclude 
the  matter  since 
there 
is  no  stay  order 
issued  by 
this  Court."
"Therefore,  the  Petitioner  by  way  of  a  separate  petition  dated  12.10.2017,"
"sought this Court to issue an interim order staying further proceedings of the"
"application  bearing  No.  55230/Labour  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Kaduwela"
"until final determination of this application."
"However,  on  04.12.2017,  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  an  order"
"was  given  by 
the 
learned  Magistrate 
in 
the  application  bearing  No."
"55230/Labour  to  the  Petitioner  to  deposit  the  amount  of  Rs.  1,363,693.02  in"
"the  Magistrate‟s  Court  of  Kaduwela.  Therefore,  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner"
"further submitted  that the Petitioner is willing  to deposit  the ordered  amount."
"Thus  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor General for the  State  submitted  that  since"
"the Petitioner agreed to deposit the money in Magistrate‟s Court, the State is"
"agreeable  to  stay  the  proceedings  in  the  Magistrate‟s  Court  until  the  final"
"conclusion  of 
the  matter  and 
if 
the  matter 
is  decided 
in 
favour  of 
the"
"Respondent,  he  is  entitled  to  withdraw  the  money.  Counsel  for  the  4th  had"
"also  no  objection 
to 
this  settlement.  Accordingly, 
this  Court  directed 
the"
"Petitioner  Authority 
to  deposit 
the  ordered  amount  within  one  week 
from"
"04.12.2017  in  the  Magistrate‟s  Court  of  Kaduwela.  Also,  this  Court  informed"
"the  Petitioner  that 
if 
the  Petitioner 
fails 
to  deposit 
that  money  within 
the"
"prescribed  period, 
the  Magistrate‟s  Court  case  can  be  proceeded; 
if 
the"
"money is deposited within the prescribed period of time the proceedings in the"
"Magistrate‟s Court is stayed until the final conclusion of this matter."
"Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  was  adhered  the  above,  and  thereby,  this  matter"
"has been proceeded further and fixed for judgment."
"In this application, the Petitioner stated that in the circumstances of the award"
"of  the  2nd  Respondent  dated  27.03.2013  is  illegal,  arbitrary,  unreasonable,"
"violative  of  the  principles  of  natural  justice  and  contrary  to  the  principle  of"
"reasonableness. The Petitioner Authority further stated that as a result of the"
"purported  award  of  the  Arbitrator  no  punishment  could  be  imposed  on  the"
"respondent  despite  of  the  fact  that  the  respondent  was  found  guilty  for  8"
"charges including financial irregularities."
