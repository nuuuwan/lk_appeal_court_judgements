"page 229:"
"“It  is  true  the  discretion  must  be  exercised  reasonably.  Now"
"what  does  that  mean?  Lawyers  familiar  with  the  phraseology"
"commonly  used  in  relation  to  exercise  of  statutory  discretions"
"often  use  the  word  ""unreasonable""  in  a  rather  comprehensive"
"sense.  It has frequently  been  used and  is frequently used  as a"
"general  description  of  the  things  that  must  not  be  done.  For"
"instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak,"
"direct himself properly in law. He must call  his own attention to"
"the  matters  which  he  is  bound  to  consider.  He  must  exclude"
"from  his  consideration  matters  which  are  irrelevant  to  what  he"
"has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be"
"said, and often is said, to be acting „unreasonably‟……”"
