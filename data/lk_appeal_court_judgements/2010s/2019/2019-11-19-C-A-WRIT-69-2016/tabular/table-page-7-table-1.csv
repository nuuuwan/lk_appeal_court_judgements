"Thu s,  it is  clear that  the surcharge  imposed  by  'X2'  under Section  lOA(l) of the"
"Customs  Ordinance  was  made while a composite  levy  existed for B'Onions,  by"
"virtue of 'X3' made under the SCL Act."
"The  Petitioner  is  an 
impo rter  of  commodities  including  B'  Onions,  and  had"
"imported  and  cleared  two  consignments  of B'  Onions  during  the  period  that"
"the Order 'X2' was  in  force -
i.e. on  22 nd  September 2015 and  8th  October 2015"
"-
as  evidenced  by  the  Customs  Declarations  annexed  to th e  petition  marked"
"'X8A'  and 
'X8B'. 
It 
is  not  in  dispute 
that  the  Petitioner  paid 
the  Special"
"Commodity Levy in terms of 'X3'  and the surcharge in terms of 'X2'."
"The complaint of t he  learned Counsel for the Petitioner to t his Court is that the"
"said  Order  'X2'  is  ultra  vires  and  contrary to the  provisions  of the  SCL  Act,  for"
"the follow ing reasons :"
"a) 
No  other tax can  be  imposed  on  any good  under the  Customs  Ordinance"
"while an  Order made under Section  2(1) of the SCL Act subsists;"
"b) 
The  Order 'X2' was  made whilst the Order 'X3'  under the SCL  Act was  still"
"in  fo rce  and  'X2'  is  therefore contrary to the  provisions  of Section  2(5)  of"
"the SCL Act;"
"c) 
The  approval of the Cabi net  of Ministers has  not been  sought  prior to the"
"'X2',  even 
though  Section  10A(1) 
requires 
the 
making  of  the  Order"
"Minister to  obtain  the  approval  of the  Cabinet  of  M inisters  prior to  the"
"making of such  Order."
