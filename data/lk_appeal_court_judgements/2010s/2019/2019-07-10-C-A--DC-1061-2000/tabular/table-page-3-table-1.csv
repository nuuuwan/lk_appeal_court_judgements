"it is quite clear that parties have  not been in co~ownership of the corpus sought to be"
"partitioned and it is for this reason that the learned District Judge takes the view that if"
"lot 1 and 2 are excluded, then the remaining portion lot 3 in Plan 1082 belongs exclusively"
"to the Plaintiff and there is no necessity for a partition in the case. This divided portion of"
"lot 3 has been in the uninterrupted and undisputed possession of the Plaintiff for more"
"than 10 years and lot 3 should thus belong to the Plaintiff.  The tenor of the judgment of"
"the learned District Judge is that the land comprising lots 1,  2 and 3 as depicted in the 1st"
"plan 1082 had long ceased to be co~owned"
"In other words if lot 1 and 2 are excluded as prayed for by the Defendant, there remains"
"lot 3 which is admittedly a land that reflects the property of the Plaintiff. All this shows"
"that a co~owned property was not brought into the case for partition and Section 2 of the"
"Partition Law No.21 of 1977 as  amended mandates that it is a co~owned land that has to"
"be  brought  into  a  partition  suit  and  not  when  common  ownership  has  long  been"
"terminated."
"Even the Counsel for the Plaintiff~Appellant did not challenge this finding of the learned"
"Counsel for  the Plaintiff~Appellant before this Court and the dismissal of the Plaintiff is"
"in my view substantially correct."
"If one takes a commonsense view which accords with reality, one cannot complain about"
"the decision  of the District Judge  because  if the length of possession is  such that the"
"inference of ouster is possible, I do have to perforce agree with the learned District Judge"
