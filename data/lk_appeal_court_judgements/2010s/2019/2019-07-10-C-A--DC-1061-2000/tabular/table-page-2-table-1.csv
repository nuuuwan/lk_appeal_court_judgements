"T he Plaintiff~Appellant instituted this action in order to partition a land called ""Gal",""
"Kohuweambahahamulahena""  now  known  as","in 
the 
""Watta""  morefully  described"
"","schedule to the plaint. The Plaintiff averred that the Plaintiff was entitled to 1/3rd of the"
"","land,  whereas  the  Defendant  owned  2/3rd  of  the  corpus.  In  fact  as  the  deed  bearing"
"","No.3965 in favour of the Plaintiff indicates, he was given 1I3rd of a larger land which is in"
"an extent of 12 lahas.  The Plaintiff then contends that his extent should constitute 4 lahas",""
"but it has got reduced after the learned District Judge dismissed her plaint at the end of",""
"the trial.",""
"","There  were  two  plans  that  figure  in  the  case.  In  the  1st  plan  that  was  commissioned"
"(marked  as  Y~p 157),","the  boundaries  of  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  and  the"
"boundaries shown in the plan did not tally at all.",""
"","In consequence, the Plaintiff commissioned a 2nd plan namely lO82A (which was marked"
"as  X)  which was drawn by the same Commissioner after a second survey but this time",""
"around, 
this  plan  reflected","the  same  boundaries  as 
in 
the  plaint.  This  plan  was"
"impeached  by  the  Defendants  as  fraudulent  and  having  been  drawn  with  a  view  to",""
"bringing the boundaries in line  with the boundaries  shown in the plaint.  It is  curious",""
"","that the surveyor who showed different boundaries in the rst  plan reflected in the 2nd plan"
"identical boundaries to those found in the schedule to the plaint.",""
"","Since  this  discrepancy was  seriously challenged as  fraudulent,  it was  incumbent upon"
"","the  Plaintiff  to  have  summoned  the  surveyor  to  give  evidence  in  order  to  clarify  the"
"","discrepancy.  In the absence of such evidence, one cannot place much reliance on the 2nd"
"","plan lO82A,  even  though the learned District Judge relies  upon it to conclude that the"
"","identity of the corpus has not been fully established by the Plaintiff. Another important"
"","conclusion that the learned District Judge  arrives  at is  that lots  1 and 2 in  the 1st  Plan"
"","bearing No.1082  have been dividedly possessed by the Defendant for  more than lO  years"
