"a
ppealed against that conviction and sentence to the Director of"
"the  Legal  Branch  of  the  Army  and  kept  silent.    No  action  has"
"been 
taken  by 
the  Director  of 
the  Legal  Branch,  obviously"
"because  he  has  no  authority  to  sit 
in  appeal  against  those"
"convictions. At that time, he was a Major and not a soldier, and"
"therefore he should have known what he should do, if he were to"
"challenge those convictions.  He has again started talking about"
"these convictions, after the withdrawal of his commission by HE"
"the  President,  several  years  later.    As  I  will  explain  later,  the"
"recommendation 
for  withdrawal  of  commission 
is  not  solely"
"dependent upon this conviction."
"The 
charges, 
in  my 
view, 
serious  and,  above  all, 
involve"
"inhuman,  apart  from  indiscipline,  activities  on  the  part  of  the"
"petitioner,  and  if  proved,  warrant  adequate  punishment,  nay"
"deterrent punishment."
"The 
learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel 
in 
the  written  submissions"
"states  that  conviction  and  sentence  was  imposed  by  a  Court  of"
"Inquiry, which had no jurisdiction to do so as a Court of Inquiry"
"is only a fact-finding mission having no authority to convict and"
"sentence  an  officer,  and  such  conviction  and  sentence  could"
"only have been imposed after a Court Marshal."
"Such a position has not been taken up in the petition.  However,"
"learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  for  the  respondents,  in  the"
"reply submissions, drawing attention of this Court to sections 40"
"and  42  of  the  Army  Act,  No.17  of  1949,  as  amended,  says  that"
"the petitioner could have been so convicted and sentenced after"
"a summary trial without a Court Marshal for those offences."
