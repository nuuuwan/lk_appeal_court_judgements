"It would appear that the balance payment could not be recovered from the said High"
"Court as admittedly the money in the Admiralty Account of the said High Court had"
"been misappropriated and were no longer available and not due to the lack of an order"
"from the learned High Court Judge as was contended."
"It is pertinent to observe at this stage that  Issues 11  and 15, which related to the 1st and"
"2nd  causes of action, the District Court held in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent"
"(a) that the High Court which exercised admiralty jurisdiction did not have sole and"
"exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the money depOSited in the High Court (Issue 11)."
"(b) than no order is necessary in terms of Regulation 140 of the Admiralty Regulations"
"for payment of money to a party (Issue 15). These issues were answered against the"
"Plaintiff-Appellant and it was in the course of answering these issues that the learned"
"District Judge of Colombo stated that a cause of action had accrued to the Plaintiff"
"Respondent."
