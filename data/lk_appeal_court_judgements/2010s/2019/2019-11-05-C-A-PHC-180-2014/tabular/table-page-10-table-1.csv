"choice of policy,  in  the  instant case it  is, undoubtedly designed with a view to"
"protect the environment. """
"It is  manifestly clear that  the  Legislature was  trying to  enact strict provisions  with"
"regard  to  the  offences  concerning  the  environment.  As  I  have  already  mentioned,"
"the  sole  requirement  of section  40 
is 
' proving  precautions  taken  by  the  vehicle"
"owner to  prevent  an  offence  being  committed'.  There  is  no  statutory  requirement"
"about  considering  the  value  of timber  or  any  other additional  matter like  whether"
"there  are  previous  convictions  against 
the  same  vehicl.e,  before  confiscating  a"
"vehicle under the Forest Ordinance.  Therefore,  it  is understood  that the  purpose of"
"section  40 
is 
to  confiscate  a  vehicle 
involved 
in  an  offence  under  the  Forest"
"Ordinance  regardless  of the  value  of the  timber  or  any  other  additional  matter."
"Accordingly, there is no merit in  the  final  ground of appeal  as well."
"Considering  above,  I  see  no  reason  to 
interfere  with 
the  order  of the  Learned"
"Magistrate dated  20.09.2012  and the  order of the  Learned High Court Judge  dated"
"05.11.2014 . Therefore, I affirm the same."
