"It is  settled  law  that  an  appellant  is  not  allm'led  to  raise  fresh  grounds,  which are"
"mixed  questions  of fact  and  law,  at  the  appeal  stage against a revision application"
"filed  in  the  High  Court. I observe that the appellant had  not raised  any  objection to"
"the charge at the Magistrate's Court or the High Court."
"In  the  case  of H.P.D.  Nimal Ranasinghe  V.  OIC, Police, Hettipola  [SC  Appeal"
"149/2017], it was held that,"
"""The question  that must be  decided is  whether any prejudice was  caused to"
"the  accused-appellant  as  a  result  of the  said defeCt  in  the  charge  sheet  or"
"whether  he  was  misled by  the  said defect.  It has  to  be  noted here  that  the"
"accused-appellant,  at the  trial,  had not taken  up  an  objection  to  the  charge"
"sheet  on  the  basis  of the said defect.  In  this  connection judicial decision  in"
"the case of Wickramasinghe  Vs  Chandradasa 67 NLR 550 is  important."
"In  the  case  of A.K.K.  Rasika  Amarasinghe  V.  Attorney  General  and  another"
"[SC Appeal 140/2010], it was held that,"
"""The  Accused-Appellant  has  not  raised  an  objection  to  the  charge  at  the"
"trial. 
In  the first place we  note  that at page 97,  the  Accused-Appellant has"
"admitted  that  he  knows  about  the  charge. 
As  I  pointed  out  earlier  the"
"Accused-Appellant  has failed  to  raise  any  objections  to  the  charge  at  the"
"trial.  In  this regard I rely on  the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal"
"in  45  NLR  page  82  in  King  V.  Kitchilan  wherein  the  Court  of Criminal"
"appeal held as follows:"
"""The proper time at which  an  objection of the nature should be  taken"
"is before the accused has pleaded"""
