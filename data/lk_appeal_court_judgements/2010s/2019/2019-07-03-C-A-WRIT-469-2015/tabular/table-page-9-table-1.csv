"I
t  must  be  made 
clear 
that 
the  petitioner  has 
filed 
this"
"application  only 
in  relation 
to  25  Acre  State  Land,  which,"
"admittedly,  in  the  Thabbowa  Sanctuary;  and  not  in  respect  of"
"225  Acre  State  Land  (which  was  reduced  to  168  Acre  State"
"Land),  and  as  seen  from  P57,  now  apparently 
falling  within"
"Weerakkodichole Reserved Forest."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner, as seen from"
"the written submissions, rests the case of the petitioner on  two"
"main grounds."
"The 
first  one 
is  on  Legitimate  Expectation. 
  The 
learned"
"President’s  Counsel  submits  that,  from  1998,  the  respondent"
"public 
officials 
and 
government 
authorities  held 
out 
and"
"promised  to  the  petitioner  in  writing  and  by  conduct  that  25"
"Acre  land  would  be  granted  to  the  petitioner  by  way  of  a  Lease"
"for  the 
fruit  cultivation  project,  and  by  the  time  Thabbowa"
"Sanctuary was later declared, the petitioner had invested about"
"Rs. 30 million to develop the land expecting that the land would"
"be given to the petitioner on a long Lease."
"I  am  unable 
to  accept 
this  argument  based  on  Legitimate"
"Expectation  after  the  area  was  declared  as  a  Sanctuary  under"
"the  Fauna  and  Flora  Protection  Ordinance.    According  to  this"
"argument,  notwithstanding  a  larger  area  including  the  said  25"
"Acres  was  declared  as  a  Sanctuary, 
the  petitioner  private"
"company shall be allowed to continue with the project, which is"
"its  business,  uninterruptedly,  and 
the  Government  shall  be"
"forced to regularize  its possession by executing  an Indenture of"
"Long-Term Lease.  No Court, in my view, in such circumstances,"
