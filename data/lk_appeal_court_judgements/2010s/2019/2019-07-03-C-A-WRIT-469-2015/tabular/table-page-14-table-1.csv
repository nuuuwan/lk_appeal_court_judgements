o 
seek 
to 
compel 
the  Minister  by  mandamus 
to  make"
"Regulations."
"I reject the second argument."
"Hence I hold that this Court cannot compel the respondents by"
"writ  of  mandamus  to  convey  by  way  of  Long  Lease  the  25  Acre"
"State  Land  admittedly  falling  within  the  Thabbowa  Sanctuary"
"shown as Lot 1 in Plan marked P15A to the petitioner."
"This  Court  also  cannot  in  the  circumstances  stop  present  and"
"future 
criminal 
proceedings―initiated 
and 
to 
be"
"initiated―against  the  petitioner  on  violation  of  Fauna  and  Flora"
"Protection Ordinance."
"What  I  have  stated  so  far  is  adequate  to  conclude  the  matter."
"Nevertheless, 
let  me  now  advert 
to  another  point  which 
is"
"relevant  to  the  matter  under  consideration.    That  relates  to  the"
"Supreme  Court  proceedings 
referred 
to  above. 
 
It 
is 
the"
"submission 
of 
the 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel 
for 
the"
"respondents that the petitioner agreed before the Supreme Court"
"to  exclude  the  area  of  the  25  acre  land  that  falls  within  the"
"Thabbowa Sanctuary."
"As I  have already  stated, the petitioner  by way of Special Leave"
"to  Appeal  went  before  the  Supreme  Court  to  get  the  interim"
"order issued by the Court of Appeal vacated.  That interim order"
"basically  prevented  the  petitioner  from  carrying  out  any  project"
"activity within the Thabbowa Sanctuary until final determination"
"of the case."
