"After trial without a jury, the trial Court in its  impugned judgment,"
"acquitted the 1st  Accused  on the basis  that he was not involved neither in"
"the  commission  of  the  offence  of  murder  of  the 
deceased  nor  has  he"
"abetted the said murder. The trial Court, however, found him guilty of the"
"offence  of  criminal  assault  or  force,  punishable  under Section  343  of  the"
"Penal  Code,  when  he  threatened  the  witnesses  after  the  murder  of  the"
"deceased."
"The 1st  Appellant sought to challenge his conviction and sentence of"
"death  upon  the  ground  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  establish  their"
"case beyond reasonable  doubt.  The 2nd  Appellant's ground  of appeal was"
"the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  does  not  reveal 
that  he  entertained  a"
"common murderous intention with the 1st  Appellant."
"Prosecution presented its case  primarily on the evidence of the wife"
"Champika  Perera  and

they  also  lived  in.  The  two  Appellants  are  their  neighbours  who"
"used to buy grocery items from their shop."
"In  the  evening  of  8th  September  2003,  wife  of 
the  2nd  Appellant"
"bought groceries from the shop at about 7.30  p.m.  and only paid Rs.  50.00"
"when  her 
total  bill  was  Rs.  100.00.  The  deceased 
then  expressed  his"
