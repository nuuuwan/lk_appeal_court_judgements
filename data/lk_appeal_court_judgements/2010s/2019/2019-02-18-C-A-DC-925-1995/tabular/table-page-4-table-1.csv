"that  the  2nd  Defendant’s  statement  is  contradicted  and  no  proper  evidence"
"neither witnesses were produced before the Trial Judge."
"It

"Kankanamge Gunapala who gave evidence on behalf of the 2nd Defendant was"
"unaware of the details and the names of the land and the nature of the facts."
"Further, the 2nd Defendant took up a position that he acquired the prescriptive"
"title to the specified land from 1963. However, this Court is in a firm view that"
"a mere statement of prescription cannot be considered as a valid prescriptive"
"title to a property."
"In Juliana Hamine Vs. Don Thomas [59 NLR 546] at page 548."
"“…Apart from the use of the word possess, the witness called by"
"the plaintiff did not described the manner of possession.”"
"In Alwis Vs. Perera [(1919) 21 NLR at page 326] Bertram C. J. stated that,"
"“I  wish  very  much  that  District  Judges  I  speak  not  particularly,"
"but  ‘I  possessed’  or  we  possessed  or  we  took  the  procedure,"
"would not confine themselves merely to recording the words, but"
"would insist on those words being explained and exemplified”."
