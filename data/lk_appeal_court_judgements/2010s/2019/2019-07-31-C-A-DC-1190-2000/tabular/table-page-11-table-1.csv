"In fact the learned Additional District Judge has himself come to the conclusion that the"
"Plaintiff who traces her title to the donee  Kadeeja Umma had obtained her prescriptive"
"rights on the land and it is singularly pertinent to point out that the 6th and 7'h Defendant"
"Appellants  have  failed  to  prove  possession  on  their  part  nor  have  they  adduced  any"
"evidence of possession on the part of their predecessors in title."
"One has only to look at the report of the surveyor who conducted the preliminary survey"
"to gather the extensive possession that the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant (the predecessor in"
"title of the 8th  Defendant) and 4th Defendant. Only those who had long standing interests"
"in the land had claimed before the surveyor and the 6th  and 7'h Defendants were nowhere"
"there  near  the  surveyor  to  assert  any  rights  to  the  land.  Neither  the  13th  nor  the  14th"
"Defendant was present at the survey.  Some  of the improvements on the land are so  old"
"to 
the  right 
that  it  is  no  wonder  that  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  came"
"conclusion  that the Plaintiff had prescribed to the land.  The prescriptive rights  would"
"not have been possible,  had Kadeeja Umma and her husband not gone into possession."
"The  finding  of 
the  learned  Additional  District  Judge 
that  the  Appellants  had  not"
"preSCribed to the land is flawless having regard to the fact that they were conspicuous by"
"their absence from the preliminary survey and there is want of evidence at the trial of any"
"prescriptive title accruing to them."
