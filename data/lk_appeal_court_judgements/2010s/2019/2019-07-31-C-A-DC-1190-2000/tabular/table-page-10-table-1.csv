"Quite germane to this aspect of the matter, Ms. Coorey pOinted out that even in the trial"
"court, the Plaintiff never came forward to give evidence and instead it was her husband"
"who took the witness stand. Her argument was that time and tide had marched on since"
"1894 but notwithstanding the march of times, in the trial that began in 1996, the Plaintiff"

"In my view the Indian case which I have cited above  Kulu Beg Afzal Beg v.  Guizar Beg"
"La] Beg,  AIR  1946  NAG  357  validates  an  implied  acceptance  and  the  bridegroom's"
"signature must be treated as an acceptance of the deed of gift on behalf of the bride, given"
"the times of yore in which the Kadutham came to be executed. I have said that the use of"
"the  word ""assigned""  in  the  Kadutham  may  mean  two  things.  Either  the bridegroom  was"
"aSSigned  the  task  of  accepting  the  gift  on  behalf  of  his  bride  or  the  gifted  land  was"
"aSSigned to the bridegroom."
"Otherwise why should the word ""assigned"" appear beside the name of the bridegroom? In"
"Black's  law  Dictionary  (Tenth  Edition,  2014),  Assignment  has  been  defined  to  be  a"
"transfer of rights or property.  In other words an assignment is a transfer or  making over"
"to another of the whole of any property, real or personal.  So  when this word is used in"
"the Kadutham opposite the signature of the bridegroom,  it is intentional and connotes an"
"assignment  of the dower  to  the bridegroom,  which he  had accepted by  appending his"
"signature to  the  Kadutham  on 22.06.1894.  I must acknowledge that the assignment is as"
"non-notarial  as  the  gift  itself.  But  despite  the  informality  Kadutham  was  recognized in"
