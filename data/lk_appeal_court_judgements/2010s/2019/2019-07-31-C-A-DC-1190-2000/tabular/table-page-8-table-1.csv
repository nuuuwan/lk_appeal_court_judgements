"figured  prominently in  this  case  was  not  addressed by the learned Additional District"
"Judge of Galle in his judgment dated 03.11.2000."
"Ms.  Sudharshani Coorey who appeared for  the Plaintiff-Respondent and 3M, 4th,  and 8A"
"Defendant-Respondents  stated that the only question that was answered by the learned"
"Additional District Judge was in relation to the non-compliance of the Kadutham with the"
"imperative requirements  of  Section  2  of  the  Prevention  of Frauds  Ordinance  and the"
"learned Counsel pointed out that the  question of non-compliance has  been  adequately"
"dealt with by the learned Additional District Judge in his judgment wherein he  stated"
"that when P4 (Kadutham)  and PS  (its English translation) were produced in Court, it was"
"admitted without any objections. Thus, Ms. Sudharshani Coorey, the learned counsel for"
"the Plaintiff-Respondent, 3M, 4th and 8A Respondents argued that the said Kadutham had"
"become admissible evidence against the 6th  and the 7'h Defendant-Appellants. She further"
"argued that the invalidity of the Kadutham was never an issue in the Court a quo."
"But  in  any  event,  there  is  evidence  that  the  bride  Kadija  Umma  had  not  signed  the"
"Kadutham and therefore it becomes a question of law for this Court to consider whether it"
"constituted a valid gift in Muslim law."
"As  is  apparent,  the  Kadutham  is  dated 22.06.1894  and as  such  this  Court is confronted"
"with a 19th  century deed  of  gift.  The  executor of this  Kadutham  Abdul  Azeez  was  long"
"dead when the trial came  about in 1996  and none of the witnesses to the attestation of"
"this document were alive when this document was produced in the trial."
"As  correctly  submitted  by  Ms.  Sudharshani  Coorey, 
this  document  will  attract  the"
"operation  of  Section  90  of 
the  Evidence  Ordinance  and  moreover 
the  6th  and  7'h"
"Defendant-Appellants  had  not  objected 
to,  nor  did  they  allow 
the  marking  of  the"
"document subject to proof."
"The  applicability  of  Section  90  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  in  relation  to  a  deed  in  a"
"partition suit surfaced to the fore  in c.A. 1247/2000  (C.A.  minutes of 28.06.2018)  and I"
"had occasion to comment on the provision thus:-"
