"The Learned  SSC for the  respondent submitted that the petitioner admitted she was"
"on  bail  which confirms she was aware of the pending case and the petitioner has,  in"
"her evidence, stated that one bail  condition was to report t.o  the PNB every Sunday."
"It was  further  submitted  that  the  petitioner  had  stated  untruth  that  she  reported  to"
"the  PNB  once  whereas  she  had  never  reported  to  the  PNB  after  getting  bail.  The"
"Learned SSC argued that even though  the petitioner stated that she could not come"
"to  Court  since  her  village  was  under  siege,  she  was  able  to  retain  a  President's"
"counsel 
to  get  her  personal  belongings  released  from  the  Police  on  21.12.1986."
"Accordingly, 
it  was  contended 
that 
this 
evidence  and 
the  behaviour  of  the"
"petitioner amply demonstrated that the absence of the petitioner was mala fide."
"The  Learned  President's  Counsel 
for 
the  petitioner  answered 
to 
the 
above"
"contention that the  aspect of contumacious behaviour arises only when the accused"
"knows  of the  case  before  him/her  and  willfully  stays  away.  It was  submitted  that"
"the  petitioner  had  no  freedom  of movement  as  she  was  living  in  a  war-tom  area"
"if the  State  could  not  execute  a 
with  no  access  to  communication  facilities  and"
"warrant against the petitioner, then  it  is  extremely unfair to expect the petitioner to"
"travel  from  a  place  where  the  State  had  not  guaranteed  freedom  of movement."
