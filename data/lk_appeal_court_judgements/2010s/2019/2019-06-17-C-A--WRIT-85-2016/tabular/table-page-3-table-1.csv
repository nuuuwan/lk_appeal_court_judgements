"T
he witness for the employer Ceylon Electricity Board has stated in"
"evidence  at  the  inquiry  that  there  was  an  approved  cadre  for  four"
"Fire  Extinguishing  Officers  in  2011  and  2012.    The  argument  of"
"the 
learned  counsel 
for  the  employer 
is  that  according  to  the"
"circulars 
there  should  have  been  approved  vacancies  at 
the"
"material  time,  which  means 
in  2005,  and  not 
in  2011. 
  The"
"arbitrator in the award has adverted to this aspect, but considered"
"the  other 
relevant  documents 
including  P19 
to  come 
to 
the"
"conclusion that there was a vacancy at the material time although"
"such  a  vacancy  was  not  created.    That  is  due  to  indifference  or"
"disinterestedness  on  the  part  of  the  employer  Ceylon  Electricity"
"Board and not due  to any fault on the  part of the employee.   The"
"employee was recruited as a Fire Extinguishing Officer on contract"
"basis 
in  the  year  2000  and  he  discharged  his  duties 
in  that"
"capacity to the satisfaction of the employer."
"I  need  hardly  emphasize  that,  according  to  section  17(1)  of  the"
"Industrial  Disputes  Act,  No.  43  of  1950,  as  amended,  “When  an"
"industrial dispute has been referred under section 3(1)(d) or section"
"4(1)  to  an  arbitrator  for settlement  by  arbitration, he shall  make  all"
"such  inquiries  into  the dispute  as he  may consider necessary, hear"
"such evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and"
"thereafter  make  such  award  as  may  appear 
to  him 
just  and"
"equitable.” In that process, the arbitrator need not follow the rigid"
"rules  of  law.  Vide  Brown  &  Company  PLC  v.  Minister  of  Labour"
