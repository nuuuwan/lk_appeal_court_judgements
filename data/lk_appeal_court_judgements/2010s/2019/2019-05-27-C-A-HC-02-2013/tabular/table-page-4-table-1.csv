"Learned  Counsel  also 
submitted 
that 
the  verSIOn  of  events  as"
"is  an  improbable  one  because  there  were  afternoon 
narrated  by  Suresh"
"classes  that  had  been  regularly  conducted  by  other  teachers  to  catch  up"
"with  the  arrears  of  work  on  syllabus  before  the  scheduled 
exams  and"
"therefore  the  place  where  this  incident  claimed  to  have  taken  place  is  a"
"place regularly frequented by others.  It was also highlighted that the trial"
"Court had failed  to  consider  the  important contradictions  and  omissions"
"that 
are 
highlighted 
against 
evidence, 
during 
his 
cross 
Suresh's"
"examination."
