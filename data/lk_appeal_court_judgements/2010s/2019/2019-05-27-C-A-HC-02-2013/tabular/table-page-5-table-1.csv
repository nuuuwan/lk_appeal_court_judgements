'","This Court, having considered  the evidence of the  prosecution as a"
"","is  of  the  opinion  that  the  evidence  of 
whole  and  in  particular  Suresh's,"
"","is 
unreliable 
owing 
to 
its 
inherent 
inconsistencies 
and 
Suresh"
"","improbabilities."
"","It appears  that  Suresh  gave  evidence after  only  two  years  since  his"
"","complaint to Police. It is  revealed from the cross examination that the past"
"","incidents  of sexual  abuse  came  to  light only when  the  school  authorities"
"","traced  the origin of the pen, which  Suresh had gifted to  one of his friends."
"","Only  then  his  involvement  with  a  foreigner 
(g~Q)  who  had  sexually"
"","abused 
him 
came 
to 
light.  Upon 
further 
questioning, 
also 
Suresh"
"","implicated a monk of a nearby temple, another youth of the same area and"
"","also the appellant for  having had sexual relations with him in addition to"
"","this  happened 
the  foreigner.  According  to  history  given  by  Suresh  all"
"","within a 
space of two  month period  preceding his  medical  examination,"
"","which was  conducted  on 16.06.2003.  He  referred  to  the  incident with the"
"","foreigner and also  mentioned that he was abused by ""three others""  in the"
"","short history. However, no names were mentioned."
"","Suresh  in his  examination in chief  claimed  that the  appellant,  who"
"","saw  him  getting  ready  to  leave  after  the  school,  told  him  to  stay  back"
"","because  his  English  was  poor.  Only  Suresh  was  asked  to  stay  back  after"
"","school.  He  complied.  Then  the  appellant  asked  him  to  go  near  the  Kota"
"","Kimbula  tree  and  then  the  appellant had  abused  him.  Suresh  is  emphatic"
"","that  he  was  sexually  abused 
four 
times  by  different 
individuals  and"
"","5"
