own the Land Registry for the election thereby not being able to"
"obtain  copies  of  Deeds  relevant  to  this  land  in  order  to  prepare"
"the answer."
"As  seen  from  the  proceedings,  the  counsel  for  the  plaintiff  has"
"not  denied  or  objected 
to 
those 
two  reasons  as 
false,  but"
"reiterated  that  the  Court  has  no  discretion  to  grant  a  further"
"date for the answer after the aforementioned Amendment to the"
"Civil Procedure Code."
"This  objection  raised  by  the  counsel  for  the  plaintiff  has  been"
"upheld  by  the  District  Judge  by  order  dated  28.06.1993  and"
"fixed the case for ex parte trial against the defendant."
"In  that  order  the  District  Judge  has  further  stated  that,  there"
"was  however  no  prohibition 
in  granting  a  date  provided  the"
"plaintiff did not object to it.  The reasoning of the District Judge,"
"on the one hand, there is no discretion to grant a date, and on"
"the other hand, a date can be granted if there is no objection by"
"the plaintiff, is contradictory."
"Thereafter, on a subsequent date, scanty evidence of the plaintiff"
"had been led and ex parte judgment had been delivered."
"Thereupon the defendant has made an application under section"
"86(2)  of 
the  Civil  Procedure  Code 
to  vacate 
the  ex  parte"
"judgment,  and  at  the  inquiry  the  registered  Attorney  for  the"
"defendant has given evidence to reiterate what he told  in Court"
"when  he  asked 
for  another  date 
to 
file 
the  answer. 
  This"
"application has also been refused by the District Judge by order"
"dated  07.02.1996  stating  inter  alia  that  the  failure  to  file  the"
"answer 
is  attributable 
to 
the  negligence  of 
the 
registered"
