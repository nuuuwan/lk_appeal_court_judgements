"Then 
it 
is  abundantly  clear  that  the 
interpretation  given  to"
"section 80 by the District Judge is erroneous.  I must emphasize"
"that  the  District  Judge  fixed  the  case  for  ex  parte  trial  only  on"
"that  ground  and  not  on  any  other  ground. 
  If  not 
for  that"
"misinterpretation  of 
the  section, 
I  have  no  doubt 
that 
the"
"District Judge would have given another date to file the answer"
"following the normal practice of the Court."
"The  District  Judge  who  wrote  the  last  order  refusing  to  vacate"
"the  ex  parte  Judgement  has  stated  that,  when  perusing  the"
"proceedings, 
it 
is  seen  that  the  registered  Attorney  has  not"
"stated  any  reason  when  he  moved  for  another  date  to  file  the"
"answer,  which  is  totally  wrong.    I  have  already  adverted  to  the"
"two reasons given by the registered Attorney for the failure to file"
"the  answer  on  the  first  date  given  for  that  purpose.    It  seems"
"that the District Judge has not seen those proceedings."
"I  set  aside  the  impugned  order  of  the  District  Judge  and  allow"
"the appeal with costs."
"After  the  objection  was  taken  for  granting  a  date  to  tender  the"
"answer,  but  before  making  an  order  on  that  objection,  the"
"defendant has filed the answer dated 23.06.1993, which has not"
"been accepted by Court.  Let the District Judge now give a date"
"to  file  a  fresh  answer,  in  which  the  defendant  can  take  up  any"
"defence 
including 
the  defendant 
that  of  res 
judicata,  which"
"wanted to make submissions on, before this Court."
