"The  plaintiff 
father 
instituted 
these  proceedings  against 
the"
"defendant daughter in the District Court of Monaragala seeking"
"to eject her from the premises in suit and for damages.  On the"
"summons returnable day, the defendant came to Court, and the"
"proxy  was  filed.   The  Court  granted  a  date,  26.05.1993,  for  the"
"answer.  On 26.05.1993 also the defendant came to Court, and"
"the registered Attorney for the defendant moved for another date"
"to  file  the  answer.    This  was  vehemently  objected  to  by  the"
"counsel for the plaintiff who appeared on the instructions of the"
"registered  Attorney  of  the  plaintiff  who  was  the  Acting  District"
"Judge on that day."
"As seen from the proceedings on 26.05.1993, the  objection was"
"purely  technical,  which  is,  according  to  section  80  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code after the amendment by Act No. 79 of 1988, the"
"Court had no jurisdiction or discretion to grant a further date to"
"file  the  answer,  and  if  the  answer  is  not  filed  on  the  first  date"
"fixed  for  the  filing  of  the  same,  the  Court  shall  mandatorily  fix"
"the case for ex parte trial against the defendant."
"The  instructing  Attorney  for  the  defendant  had  disagreed  with"
"that 
interpretation  given 
to  section  80  and  stated 
that 
the"
"discretion given to the District Judge to grant  extension of time"
"to 
file 
the  answer  had  not  been 
taken  away  by 
the  said"
"Amendment.  Although that was the first date and not the final"
"date 
for  the  answer,  the 
instructing  Attorney  has  given  two"
"reasons for the failure to file the answer on that date.  One is the"
"fact  that  he  contested  as  a  candidate  at  the  recently  concluded"
"Provincial  Council  elections 
thereby  not  being  able 
to 
take"
"proper  instructions  from  the  client;  and  the  other  is  closing"
