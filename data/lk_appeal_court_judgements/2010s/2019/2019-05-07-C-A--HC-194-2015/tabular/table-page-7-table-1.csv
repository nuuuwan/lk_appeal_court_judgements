"","guilty  and may not speak out until some time has passed. There is no typical"

"16.","When  it  comes  to  a  child  victim,  he  or  she  may  even  find 
it  difficult  to"
"","explain to  court the delay  in  making the complaint.  The Trial  Judge,  before"
"","whom the witnesses  testified,  is  the  best person to  decide  on the credibility"
"","of the  victim  and  the  other  witnesses  as  he  observed  the  demeanour  and"
"","deportment  of  the  witnesses. 
In 
this  case 
the 
learned 
trial  judge 
in  his"
"","judgment has  given careful consideration to the above aspects and also to all"
"","the evidence adduced by the prosecution and defence at the trial."
"17.","Counsel for the Appellant also submitted that there was no medical evidence"
"","to prove the charge. As I  mentioned before in paragraph 08  of this judgment,"
"","the  sexual  act  alleged  could  be  committed  without  having  visible  physical"
"","injuries.  Medical  officer  who  examined  the  victim  opined  that  there  is  a"
"","possibility  to  commit the  alleged  sexual  act  without having visible  injuries."
"","He  also  said  that  it  is  possible  to  have  red  patches,  and  if so,  could  have"
"","noticed if the  victim was examined immediately after the act.  Therefore, the"
"","absence of scars  of physical  injuries  visible will not affect the  credibility  of"
"","the victim.  In the circumstances we find that ground of appeal No.2 has no"
"","merit."
"18.","Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the evidence did not reveal that the"
"","alleged offence was  committed on the  day  mentioned in the  indictment.  We"
"","bear in mind that the victim was  13  years  old when the alleged offence was"
"","committed. The evidence was taken in  court after about 9 years.  Accused  is"
"","entitled  to  know  the  time  of the  alleged  offence  was  committed  as  per the"
"","prosecution,  for  him  to  prepare  for  his  defence.  Otherwise  he  would  be"
"","deprived of a fair trial."
