of

"Additional Solicitor General, this Court must therefore decide at the outset"
"whether 
it  has 
been 
invested  with 
appellate 
jurisdiction  over 
the"
"Permanent  High  Court  at  Bar  under  Article  138  and  whether  it  could"
"entertain an application for revision against an order of the said Court."
"Article 138, in its original form in the 1978 Constitution, defined the"
"nature of the jurisdiction it had conferred upon the Court of Appeal as  /I an"
"appellate jurisdiction for  the  correction of all  errors in fact or in  law  which shall be"
"committed by any Court of First Instance,  tribunal or other institution"". The said"
"Article  also  stated  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  had  the  power  of  ""sole  and"
"exclusive cognizance,  by way of appeal,  revision  ... of all  prosecutions""."
"A  Plain  reading  of 
the  said  Article

"jurisdiction of  this Court which could only be exercised  over all  errors in"
"fact or in law, in respect of  1/ any Court of First Instance,  tribunal  or  other"
"institution"".  But  the  Constitution  did  not  specify  what  those  Courts  of"
"First Instance,  tribunal or other institutions are.  This  is  significant in view"
"of  Article  105  where  the  Constitution  identified  the  institutions  for  the"
"administration of justice which protect, vindicate and enforce  the right of"
"the People as;"
"(a) the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka"
"(b) the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka"
"(c)  the  High  Court  of  the  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  and  such  other"
"Courts 
of  First

or 
such 
institutions 
as"
"Parliament may from time to time ordain and establish."
