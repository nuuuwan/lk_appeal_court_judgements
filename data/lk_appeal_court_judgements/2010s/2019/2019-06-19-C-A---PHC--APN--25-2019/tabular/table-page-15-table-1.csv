"Learned Additional Solicitor General's contention is  that Article 138"
"made no specific reference  to  the Permanent High Court at Bar at all and"
"therefore, this Court clearly has no jurisdiction over it either by way of an"
"appeal addressed to it or by way of revision."
"this  position  by 
Learned  President's  Counsel  sought  to  counter"
"making reference to Section 12A(1)(a)  of the Judicature  (Amendment)  Act"
"No.9 of 2018,  in support of his position that the Permanent High Court at"
"Bar is  only another division of the High Court of the Province, established"
"under  Article  154P,  and 
it  had  already  been  placed  under  appellate"
"jurisdiction of this Court by the judicial precedents of the Supreme Court."
"He submitted that the Permanent High Court at Bar therefore is amenable"
"to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court."
"In  view  of 
these  submissions, 
the  fundamental 
issue  before  this"

/I  •••  High  Court, 
... /1 as  found  in"
"Article  138,  is  meant to  include the Permanent High Court at Bar  as  well"
"among the already recognised group of 
inferior Courts which are subject"
"to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal."
"This  Court  has  no  power  to  provide  an  interpretation  to  the  said"
"reference to ""High Court"" as found in  Article 138, in view of the 1/ sole and"
"exclusive jurisdiction""  conferred  upon the Supreme Court by Article 125,"
"by  which  only  the  apex  Court  could  hear  and  determine  any  question"
"related to the interpretation of the Constitution. Whether the said reference"
"includes  the  High Court of  the  Republic,  the High Court of  the Province"
"established  under  Article  154P, 
the  High  Court  exercising  jurisdiction"
"under  Special  Provisions  Act  Nos.  10  of  1996  and  54  of  2006  or
