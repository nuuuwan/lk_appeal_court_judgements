"doing justice between  the  parties,  may not permit a"
"party  to  raise  a new 
point  if the  other  party  has"
"had  no  proper  notice  of the  new  ground,  or  would"
"suffer grave  prejudice  by  the  belated stage at which"
"it is  raised.  The  appellate jurisdiction of this  Court"
"is  very  wide  in  its  amplitude,  as  it  should  be, 
it"
"being 
the 
final  Court  of  Appeal. 
The 
narrow"
"construction  contended for  by  Counsel  erodes  its"
"width and usefulness""  (emphasis added)"
