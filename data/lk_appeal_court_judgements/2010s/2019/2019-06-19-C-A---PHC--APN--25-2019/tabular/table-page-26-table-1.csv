"These  legislative  provisions  make  it clear  that  the  Legislature  had"

to  only  one  instance.  The  divisional  bench  of 
the  Supreme  Court"

"If  the  Petitioner's  contention

this  Court

"validity  of  a  Judgment,  Sentence  and  Order  of  a  Permanent High  Court"

"the Petitioner's right of appeal  only to  the Supreme Court.  When there is"
"clear  and  unambiguous  expression  of  legislative  intent  in  restricting  the"
"right of appeal  only to  the Supreme Court, and thereby limiting the right"
"of  appeal 
only  to 
a  single  instance,  this  Court  cannot  and  should  not"
"recognise  such  an  attempt for  an  indirect  review  by  this  Court  without"
"clear statutory provisions 
indicating such a  shift in the Legislative intent."
"In the  absence  of  any  statutory  provisions  to  that  effect,  recognizance  of"
"such 
an 
indirect 
review  would 
certainly  undermine

"unambiguous intention of the Parliament."
