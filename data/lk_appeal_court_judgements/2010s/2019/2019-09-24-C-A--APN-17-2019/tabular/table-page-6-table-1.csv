"09.","Counsel  for  the Appellant submitted that the  learned Magistrate has  failed  to"
"","comp ly with section  182  (I) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.  In  that,"
"","counsel  submitted  that  the  learned  Magistrate  has  failed  to  sign  the  charge"

"10.","A  similar  situation  was  discussed  in  case  of Imiyagamage  GUllawatftie  V"
"","Aftomey general CA  (PHC)  1391200909.10.2018."
"","In  that case Court found  that although  the  learned Magistrate has  not put his"
"","signature on the charge sheet, he had signed the journal entry, which showed"
"","that the learned Magistrate has  framed  the charge."
"11 .","The  main  requirement and  the purpose of a charge  is  that the Accused  must"
"","understand  what he  is  charged  for.  In  the  instant case there  is  a charge sheet"
"","filed  of record.  The  Petitioner  has  produced  a  certified  copy  of the  same."
"","Certi fied  copy  of the journal  entry  dated  12.06.2017  filed  by  the  Petitioner"
"","clearly 
indicates 
that 
the 
learned  Magistrate  has 
read  and  explained 
the"
"","charge 
to 
the  Petitioner.  Petitioner  has  pleaded  guilty  and 
the 
learned"
"","Magistrate  has  signed  the journal  entry.  This  position  is  not  challenged  by"
"","the  Petitioner.  Petitioner  admits  that  he  was  charged  and  that  he  pleaded"
"","guilty  to 
the  charge  unconditionally  (paragraphs  2  and  3  of the  petition)."
"","Therefore,  it 
is  admittedly  clear  that  the 
learned  Magistrate  has  acted 
in"
"","terms of section  182  (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.  The learned"
"","Magistrate merely  not putting his signature underneath  the charge sheet does"
"","not  mean  that  he  has  violated  section  182(1).  In  this  case  it  has  not  caused"
"","any prejudice to the Petitioner."
