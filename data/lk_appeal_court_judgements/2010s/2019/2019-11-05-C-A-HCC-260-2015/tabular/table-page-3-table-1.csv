"02.  Counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  submitted 
that 
the  Trial  Judge  who  finally"
"decided on the case heard only the evidence of PW9.  Evidence of all  other"
"prosecution  witnesses  had  been 
led  before  his  predecessors.  Evidence  of"
"those  witnesses  were  not  adopted  before  him.  It is 
the  contention  of the"
"counsel 
that 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge 
therefore  did  not  have 
the"
"opportunity to observe the demeanour of the material witnesses."
