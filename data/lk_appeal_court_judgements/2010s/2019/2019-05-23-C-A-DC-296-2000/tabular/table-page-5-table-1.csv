the  father  and  ordered  the  ejectment  of"
"Chandarasekara (the Def  ndant in that case but the Ph intiff in this case) from the land"
"by his judgment dated 0,9.11.1985.  The  Plaintiff in this  case  Chandrasekara did file  an"
"appeal against the judgment in the previous case but quite significantly in May 1991 he"
"withdrew the appeal before Palakidnar J.  (PICA) and Or.  A.  de Z.  Gunawardana J.  and"
"the appeal was accordingly dismissed."
"So here was a father who :lad nominated the Plaintiff as his nominee but because the son"
"turned ungrateful and forgetful of his largess, 
the father cancelled the nomination on"
"21.05.1980 and sued him tor repossession of the land and ejectment."
"But the plaint of the Plaintiff alleges that despite all tlis bad blood and acrimony, there"
"was a re~nomination of h' m as a nominee on 17.01.1987. Certainly this date appears at p.2"
"of the permit PI in the column where the names of the ..:leleted nominees appear but the"
"name  of the Plaintiff as  t he  nominee  does  not appear at all  at p.2.  The date 17.01.1987"
"stands sans the name of t: c Plaintiff."
"In my view the 2nd  page :)f  Pl ~ the permit does not affclrd any evidence at all for the re~"
"nomination  upon which the  Plaintiff sues  in  this  cas  . The  Plaintiff's  name  does  not"
"appeal at all on this page a.nd he only remains as a nominee revoked."
"How  the  father  who  di ' d  in  May  1987,  changed his  heart  and  re ~nominated him  in"
"January 1987 remains untxplained, given the fact the father had taken the son to court"
"for  acts  of  ingratitude  a Jd  vindicated  his  honour  in  the  previous  case.  Indubitably,"
"paternal instincts do overtake paterfamilias despite th ::  peccadilloes of their issues but"
"the test of such a probabi ity in this case is not satisfied on oral evidence. It would appear"
"that  even 
the  permit

v-hich  manifests  various 
revocations 
in 
the  place  where"
"nominations should appe lr does not display the name 0'- the Plaintiff as the re~nominated"
"nominee in 1987."
"The attempt of the Plaintiff was to show that when hi.  father passed away in May 1987"
"he had already become a nominee in January 1987. But tLe items of documentary evidence"
"do not  advance his case.
