Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner, a religious society, filed this application seeking

to quash by writ of certiorari the Quit Notice marked P21 served

on it by the 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, and to compel the 1st

Respondent by writ of mandamus to convey the land in question

by way of a Deed to the Petitioner Society.

The subject land is admittedly a State Land. There had been a

severe opposition from the villagers and clergy when the

Petitioner Society attempted to construct some buildings in this

State Land, and that has led to making complaints to the police,

and filing a case in the Magistrates Court to prevent breach of

the peace, and maintain religious harmony.

By P19 the 1st Respondent has informed the Petitioner to stop

construction of religious buildings as no approval from the

Ministry of Religious Affairs has been obtained (vide R7).

When the land is admittedly a State Land, as an agent of the

State the 1st Respondent is legally entitled to take steps to evict

the Petitioner from the land. Notice of Quit has been issued as

the first step in that process.

Merely because Permits and Grants have been issued under the

Land Development Ordinance to some of the unlawful occupiers

of the neighbourhood, the Petitioner cannot demand that it shall

also be issued with a Permit or Grant. That decision will be

taken in terms of the established procedure on case by case

basis.

3

The Petitioner has obviously no legal right to the performance of

a legal duty by the 1st Respondent to transfer the subject land

belonging to the State on what is called by the Petitioner by way

of a Deed of Sacred Land. Hence mandamus will not lie.

The Petitioners application is dismissed without costs.
