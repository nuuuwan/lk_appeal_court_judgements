"English law of agency applicable in Sri Lanka"
"It is apt to bear in mind that the law governing agency in Sri Lanka is the law applicable"
"in England.  This  is  made  clear  by  Section  3 of the  Civil  Law  Ordinance  No.5  of  1852"
"which states that: ""in all questions or issues which have to be decided in Sri Lanka with respect to the"
"law  of principal  and  agent,  the  law  to  be  administered  shall  be  the  same  as  would  be administered in"
"England  in  the  like  case"".  Accordingly,  English  cases  on  agency  disputes  will apply in  Sri"
"Lanka."
"Bearing  the  above  in  mind,  I  next  pose  the  question  as  to  what  breaches  the  plaint"
"alleged against the Defendant."
"The learned President's Counsel for the Defendant,Appellant submitted that the Plaintiff"
"was engaged in the felling of trees and selling in the name of Devapriya Enterprises. Even"
"if  it  is  so,  it  does  not  entitle  an  employee  of  the  Plaintiff  to  misappropriate  monies"
"received by the Defendant for  and behalf of the Plaintiff. All the averments in the plaint"
"refer to monies paid to the Defendant for  and behalf of the Plaintiff and not for  and on"
"behalf of Devapriya Enterprises."
"In Stroud's law Dictionary a contractor is defined as ""a person who, in pursuit of an independent"
"business  undertakes  to  do  specific jobs  of work for  other persons,  without  submitting himself to  their"
"control in respect to the details of work""."
"Thus the very fact that the Plaintiff was a contractor establishes that he was not subject"
