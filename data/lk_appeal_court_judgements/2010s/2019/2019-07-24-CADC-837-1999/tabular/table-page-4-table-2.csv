"In order to resolve this issue let me bring forth that all too familiar definition of what a"
"cause of action is all about. Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code defines it as the wrong"
"for the prevention or redress of which an action maybe brought, and includes the denial"
"of  a  right,  the  refusal  to  fulfill  an  obligation,  the  neglect  to  perform  a  duty,  and  the"
"infliction of an affirmative injury."
"So  it is a denial of a right or failure  to perform an obligation. What is  the jural relation"
"between the parties that imposes an obligation on the Defendant or bestows a right on"
"the Plaintiff?  In my view it is  the oral agreement that both the Plaintiff and Defendant"
"reached."
