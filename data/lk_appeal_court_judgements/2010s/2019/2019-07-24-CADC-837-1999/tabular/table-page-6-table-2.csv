"Contract of Agency"
"The contract between the Plaintiff and Defendant that was entered into in Panadura was"
"a contract of agency,  albeit oral.  No  doubt this contract imposes implied duties on the"
"agent."
"In  a  contract  of  agency  there  arise  a  number  of  duties  and  obligations  between  the"
"principal  and  agent.  Such  duties  and  obligations  are  usually  spelt  out  in  an  agency"
"agreement but in a situation such as we encounter in this case, they can be implied into"
"the  agency  agreement.  A disregard or breach of the  agent's  obligations  can lead to  the"
"agent's liability to the principal for the agent's liability for damages for breach of contract"
"and for negligence."
