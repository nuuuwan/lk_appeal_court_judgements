"This  case  also  added  a  rider  namely  ""the  place  of business  of the  Defendant  was  necessary  to"
"determine the residence of the Defendant."" Be that as it may, in this case the Plaintiff did not rely"
"on the Defendant's residence to vest court with jurisdiction."
"So I would conclude that the contract between the Plaintiff and Defendant was entered"
"into and the cause of action arose in Panadura."
"From the foregoing analysis I conclude that the learned District Judge of Panadura arrived"
"at the right decision and I  see no reason to depart from these findings.  As  such I  affirm"
"the judgment dated 1l. 09.1999 and proceed to dismiss the appeal."
