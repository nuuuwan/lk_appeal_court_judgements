reach  of  the  peace  over  this  dispute.    What  seems  to  have"
"happened is, soon after the dismissal of the partition action, the"
"appellant has attempted to forcibly enter the disputed portion of"
"the  land  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  has  lost  the  partition"
"action.    According  to  the  Preliminary  Plan  No.891021  and  its"
"Report marked by the appellant as V2 and V6 in the Magistrate’s"
"Court, the hut which the appellant has put up falls outside the"
"disputed  portion  of  the 
land. 
  That  hut 
is 
in  Lot  6  of  the"
"Preliminary Plan No.891021.  The disputed portion of land in the"
"section  66  application  is  Lots  2  and  8  of  the  said  Preliminary"

"respondent’s  plaint  in  the  partition  action  alone  confirms  the"

land  since  1988.  The 
learned"
"counsel  thereby  alludes  to  the  interim  injunction  application"
"made in the partition case to say that the interim injunction was"
