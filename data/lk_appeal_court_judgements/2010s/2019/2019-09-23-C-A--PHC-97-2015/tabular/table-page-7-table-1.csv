"The Learned Magistrate further observed that the appellant had given his vehicle to"
"a  third  party,  without  taking  any  precaution,  just  after  06  days  he  bought  the"
"vehicle.  [  think  that  the  Learned  Magistrate  was  very  correctly  evaluating  the"
"the  appellant  as  required  by  the 
evidence  to  find  out  the  precautions  taken  by"
"Forest Ordinance.  I am  of the view that not mentioning any precautions taken by a"
"vehicle  owner,  arguing  that  precautions  could  depend.,?n  circumstances,  is  not"
"sufficient to  satisfy  Court on  a  balance  of probability that the  vehicle  owner took"
"precautions  within  his  capability.  It is  clear  that  the  Learned  Magistrate  was  not"
"expecting  any  higher  degree  of precautions,  but  was  evaluating  the  evidence  in"
"order  to  find  out  whether  the  appellant  had  fulfilled  the  requirements  stated  in"
"section 40  of the  Forest  Ordinance.  Therefore,  I  do  not  see  any  merits  in the  first"
