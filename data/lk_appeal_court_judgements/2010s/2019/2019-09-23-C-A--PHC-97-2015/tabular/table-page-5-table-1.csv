"testified that he had no  knowledge about an illegal transport of timber."
"The  Learned  Counsel  for 
the  appellant  contended  that  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge  and  the  Leamed  Magistrate  have  failed  to  appreciate  that  the  degree  and"
"the  prevailing 
limits  of precautions  an  owner  of vehicle  could  take  depend  on"
"circumstances  of each  case.  It was  argued  that  uniformity  of an  equal  level  of"
"precautions  should  not  be  expected  from  every  vehicle  owner. 
It  was  further"
"submitted  that  the  appellant had  a  very  limited  scope  in.. the  precautions  he  could"
"take  and  the  Leamed  Magistrate  should  not  have  expected  a  higher  degree  of"
"precautions from the appellant."
"In  answer to  the  above  contention,  the  Learned  SSC  for  the  respondent submitted"

"includes strict provisions to ensure that no person transports timber without a valid"
"license."
"in 
As  per  section  40  of  the  Forest  Ordinance  (as  amended)  a  vehicle  owner"
"question  is  required  to  prove  to  the  satisfaction  of the  Court that he  had  taken  all"
"precautions to prevent an offence being committed utilizing his vehicle."
