"or the act of the acquiring officer under this section is not a"
"decision affecting the rights of a person but an investigation"
"which  leads  to  a  recommendation  to  the  Minister  that  the"
"said 
land 
is  either  suitable  or  not  suitable  for  the  said"
"purpose. The Minister after considering the suitability of the"
"said land as provided in section 4(1) of the said Act makes"
"a preliminary decision to acquire."
"The decision that is challenged in this application is P4B, a"
"notice  under  section  2  of 
the  Land  Acquisition  Act 
to"
"investigate a land and this investigation will not necessarily"
"result  in  a  subsequent  acquisition  of  that  land.  Therefore,"
"this  is not  a decisive exercise of discretion by  the Minister."
"The 
first  decisive  exercise  of  discretion  by 
the  Minister"
"under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  affecting  the  rights  of  a"
"person is  made at the stage of section 4(1) of the said Act."
"At  this  stage  the  person  who  has  an  interest  in  the  land"
"could  object  to  the  acquisition  of  the  land  as  provided  by"
"that section. Therefore, seeking a writ of certiorari to quash"
"a notice under section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act marked"
"P4B or for a writ of prohibition at this stage from taking any"
"steps 
to  acquire  any  part  of 
the  Petitioner's 
land 
is"
"premature  and  not  ripe 
for  review.  Therefore 
the  court"
"dismisses this application without costs."
