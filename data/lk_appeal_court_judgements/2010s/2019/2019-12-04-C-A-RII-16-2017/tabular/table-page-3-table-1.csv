he  petitioners  in  paragraph  10  of  the  petition  state  that  “The"
"petitioners did not invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as"
"the  petitioners  were  not  entitled  to  appeal  under  the  Act  No.4  of"

"The petitioners are not entitled to appeal against the Judgment"

"Appeal.    No  step  has  been  taken  by  the  petitioners  to  seek"
"special  leave  to  appeal  against  the  said  Judgment  of  the  High"
"Court of Civil Appeal."
"Hence,  the  argument  of  the  petitioners  in  paragraph  11  of  the"

"The  petitioners’  whole  application,  in  my  view,  is  tainted  with"
"mala  fides.    They  have  not  come  before  this  Court  with  clean"
