"Maarsdorp (supra)  provides an  answer to this question  by  reference to the rights of possession,"
"enjoyment and  disposition and  states as follows:"
"""these three factors are all  essential to the idea of ownership but need not all be present"
"in  an  equal  degree at one  and  the same time. Thus,  though there need not be  actual  use"
"and enjoyment present in every case, the right of alienation, coupled with the legal means"
"of effecting such alienation, is at all times necessary in order to constitute valid ownership:"
"and  perhaps a more correct definition of ownership would be that it is the exclusive  right"
"of disposing of a corporeal thing combined  with  the  legal  means  of alienating the same"
"and  coupled with the right to claim the possession  and  enjoyment thereof."""
