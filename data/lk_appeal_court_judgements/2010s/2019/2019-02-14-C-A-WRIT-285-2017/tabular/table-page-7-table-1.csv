"The  position was clearly set out In  the Matter of the Application of JOHN FERGUSON for a Writ of"
"Prohibition against the District Court (1  N.l.R. 181 at 183) by Morgan A.C.J.  as follows:"
"""A Court empowered like our District Courts to fine and  imprison and to keep a record of"
"its proceedings is a Court of Record  (Hawkins'  Pleas of the Crown, cap.  I,  section  14), and"
"Courts of Record  have undoubtedly the power to punish summarily contempt committed"
"in the face of the Court. Such  power is  inherent in such  Courts, and  rests on the necessity"
"of preserving  for  them  that  decent  respect,  without  which  they  cannot  carryon  their"
"proceedings or maintain their just authority."""
