"Rafeek  while  'P8'  issued  in  2006  acknowledges  for the first time the  fact that"
"Rafeek  had  passed  away.  It  appears  from  a  letter  dated  10th  February  2009,"
"annexed  to the petition marked  'Pl0', that the  Petitioners have  not made any"
"payments  after 2006  and  that  the  1st  Respondent  too  had  been  reluctant  to"
"accept  any  monies  due  to  the  fact  that the  permit  holder  had  passed  away ."
