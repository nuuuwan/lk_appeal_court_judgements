"The  petitioners 
further  state 
that 
they  hold  a  pensionable"
"position  and  thus  have  a  legitimate  expectation  of  receiving  a"
"pension.    This  argument  lacks  merit.    The  fact  that  the  post  is"
"them  entitled 
to 
pensionable  does  not  automatically  make"
"receive  the  pension.  He  needs  to  fulfil  other  requirements  such"
"as 10 year service to become so eligible."
"Application of the petitioners is dismissed, but without costs."
"Before  I  part  with  this  Judgment  I  must,  subject  to  correction,"
"make  the  following  observation.    The  petitioners  have  filed  this"
"application  on  the  premise  that,  according  to  the  applicable"
"Pension Minutes, they are mandatorily required to complete ten"
"years  of  permanent  employment 
to  be  eligible 
to  receive  a"
"pension. 
  The  said  Pension  Minutes  appears 
to  have  been"
"amended from time to time by various Public Administration and"
"Pension  Department  Circulars.    For  instance,  it  appears  to  me"
"(subject  to  correction)  that,  according  to  Pension  Department"
"Circular  No.9/2004 
dated 
30.06.2004 
read  with 
Pension"
"Department 
Circular 
No.2/2013 
dated 
18.04.2013, 
non-"
"pensionable  service,  such  as,  daily  paid,  casual,  substitute,"
"temporary,  training  can  also  be  calculated  for  the  purpose  of"
"pension provided the employee has been recruited to the service"
"before  45  years  of  age.    These  petitioners  have  been  recruited"
"before 45 years of age."
"Hence,  the  said  dismissal  of  the  application  shall  not  prejudice"
"the right of the petitioners to make a suitable application to the"
"proper authorities, if so advised."
