"n  Billimoria  v.  Minister  of  Lands  and  Land  Development  &"
"Mahaweli Development10 Chief Justice Samarakoon observed:"
"Article  125  of  the  Constitution  requires  any  dispute  on  the"
"interpretation of the Constitution to be referred to this Court."
"What 
is  contemplated 
in  Article  125 
is 
""any  question"
"relating  to  the  interpretation  of  the  Constitution""  arising  in"
"the  course  of  legal  proceedings.  This  presupposes  that  in"
"the determination of a real issue or controversy between the"
"parties, in any adversary proceedings between them, there"
"must arise the need for an interpretation of the provisions of"
"the  Constitution.  The  mere 
reliance  on  a  constitutional"
"provision  by  a  party  need  not  necessarily 
involve 
the"
"question  of 
the 
interpretation  of 
the  Constitution.  There"
"must  be  a  dispute  on 
interpretation  between  contending"
"parties. It would appear that Article 125 is so circumscribed"
"that it must be construed as dealing only with cases where"
"the 
interpretation  of 
the  Constitution 
is  drawn 
into 
the"
"actual  dispute  and  such  question  is  raised  directly  as  an"
"issue  between  the  parties  or 
impinges  on  an 
issue  and"
"forms  part  of  the  case  of  one  party,  opposed  by  the  other,"
"and  which  the  Court  must  of  necessity  decide  in  resolving"
"that issue."
