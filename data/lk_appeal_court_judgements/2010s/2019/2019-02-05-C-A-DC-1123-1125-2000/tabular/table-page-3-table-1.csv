"Let me first consider the 6th defendantâ€™s appeal."
"The  6th  and  7th  defendants  are  husband  and  wife  respectively."
"They  have  filed  a  joint  statement  of  claim.    But  the  Petition  of"
"Appeal  has  been  filed  only  by  the  6th  defendant.    The  learned"
"District Judge has given 30/1800 shares each to the 6th and 7th"
"defendants."
"At 
the 
trial 
they  have 
sought 
exclusion  of  Lot  6  of 
the"
"Preliminary Plan on prescription."
"The  plaintiff  sought  to  partition  the  land  known  as  Hitinawatta"
"alias Paranawatta.  The court commissioner has confirmed it in"
"the  Preliminary  Plan 
and 
its  Report  marked  X 
and  X1"
"respectively."
"The  6th  defendant  states  that  Hitinawatta  and  Paranawatta  are"
"two  different 
lands  and  Lot  6 
is  Paranawatta  and  therefore"
"cannot  be  subject  to  partition  in  one  action.    This  position  is"
"unacceptable."
"Even  in  the  old  Plans  (vide  for  example  P16/11V3  prepared  in"
"1956) and the old Deeds (vide for example P10 executed in 1921,"
"P17 executed in 1923, P18 executed in 1934, 11V1 executed in"
"1964,  4V2  executed 
in  1972,  11V2  executed 
in  1978,  5V1"
"executed  in  1974)  this  land  has  been  identified  as  Hitinawatta"
"alias Paranawatta, or Hitinawatta and Paranawatta."
"It is the position of the 6th defendant that 6th and 7th defendants"
"have prescribed to Lot 6 of the Preliminary Plan.  This position is"
"also unacceptable."
"The 6th and 7th defendants at the trial produced three Deeds.  By"
"Deed  No.  14266  dated  24.06.1958  marked  6V1,  Kiribiyah,"
