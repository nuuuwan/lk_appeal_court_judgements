"from the corpus.   This shall be in addition to what has already"
"been given to him by the Judgment (i.e. 100/1800)."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  said  defendants  also  states  that  by"
"Deed  No.  14265  marked  as  P4,  Kiribiyah  and  Allis  transferred"
"9/25th 
from  the  corpus  to  Hethuwa  and  Jothiya,  and  those"

"defendant Piyadasa, the 9th defendant Nimal Chandraratne, the"
"15th defendant Podinona and the 4th defendant Suwaris."
"This  contention 
is  unacceptable  as  Hethuwa  and  Jothiya,"

transferred 
to 
the  1st"
"defendant  Sirisena,  only  5/6th 
from  1/5th  and  therefore  the"
"balance  1/6th  from  1/5th  of  Hethuwa  and  Jothiya  shall  upon"
"their  deaths  also  devolve  on 
their  children. 
  This 
is  not"
"acceptable."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  plaintiff-respondents  in  the  written"
"submission by drawing attention to Deed No. 66276 marked 5V2"
"has  stated  that  Hethuwa  and  Jothiya  have  by  the  said  Deed"
"transferred  77/100  shares  to  the  5th  defendant  Gunadasa,  the"
"9th  defendant  Nimal  Chandraratne  and 
the  15th  defendant"
"Podinona. 
  The 
learned  counsel 
for  the  plaintiff-respondents"
"states that this Deed produced during the cross examination of"
"the 1st plaintiff has escaped the attention of the District Judge."
