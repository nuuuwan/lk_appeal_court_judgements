"Dingiriya in Deed P11 traces his title (or declares as the source"
"of his title) to Deed No.20834 attested by Fernando NP and not"
"to Deed No. 31 attested by Wickremaarachchi NP marked P10."
"Conversely, 
in  Deed  marked  11V1  relied  upon  by 
the  11th"
"defendant, Dingiriya traces his title (or declares as the source of"
"his  title) 
to  Deed  No.  31  attested  by  Wickremaarachchi  NP"
"marked P10."
"Then it is clear that the finding of the learned District Judge that"
"Dingiriya disclosed by the 11th defendant does not figure in the"
"pedigree of the plaintiff4 is erroneous."
"The  11th  defendantâ€™s  claim  for  undivided  3/10th  share  out  of"
"2/5th share (i.e. 6/50 share) is entitled to succeed."
"His claim to prescriptive rights to Lot 7 of the Preliminary Plan is"
"not entitled to succeed."
"At the final scheme of partition his rights shall as far as possible"
"be given from Lot 7 of the Preliminary Plan."
"The appeal of the 11th defendant is partly allowed."
"This leads me to consider the appeal of the 1st, 9th and 15th"
"defendant-appellants."
"The  1st,  2nd,  4th,  5th,  8th,  9th  and  10th  defendants  have  filed  a"
"joint  statement  of  claim.    The  15th  defendant  does  not  seem  to"
"have 
filed  a  statement  of  claim. 
  The  said  defendants  have"
"predominantly  sought  to  exclude  Lot  3  of  the  Preliminary  Plan"
"on prescription.  This claim is not entitled to succeed."
