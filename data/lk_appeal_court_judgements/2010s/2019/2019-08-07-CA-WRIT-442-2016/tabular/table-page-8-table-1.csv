as  been  produced  to  convince  that  P6  complaint  was  handed"
"over to the Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority at"
"Hambantota on or around 29.09.2008."
"In  reply,  the  Consumer  Affairs  Authority  in  its  statement  of"
"objections filed in CA/WRIT/446/2015, in paragraph 17, and its"
"Chairman  in  paragraph  19  of  the  corresponding  affidavit  state"
"that,  “There  was  no  necessity  for  the  1st  Respondent  (Consumer"
"Affairs  Authority)  to  initiate  any  inquiry  to  ascertain  the  actual"
"date  of  the  complaint  as  it  is  already  printed  on  the  complaint"
"itself.”    That  I  must  say  is  a  very  irresponsible  statement―a"
"statement  which  cannot  sustain  in  the  eyes  of  law  even  for  a"
"moment.    What  matters  is  not  the  date  which  appears  on  the"
"written complaint, but the date on which the written complaint"
"was lodged with the Consumer Affairs Authority."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  consumer  in  CA/WRIT/236/2016,"
"with  the  permission  of  Court, 
filed  a  copy  of  a 
letter  dated"
"07.06.2011  marked  10R7(a),  written  by 
the 
consumer 
in"
"CA/WRIT/446/2015  to  the  Regional  Office  of  the  Consumer"
"Affairs  Authority  at  Hambantota.    In  that  letter  the  consumer"
"has  stated 
the 
fact  of  handing  over 
the  complaint  dated"
"29.09.2008 
to 
the  Regional  Office  of 
the  Consumer  Affairs"
"Authority at Hambantota.  It may be recalled that P8 complaint"
"is  dated  29.09.2008.  Nevertheless,  in  10R7(a)  it  is  not  stated"
"when  that  complaint  dated  29.09.2008  was  handed  over  to  the"
"Regional  Office.    The  original  registered  Postal  Article  Receipt"
"has  also  been  tendered  marked  10R7(b)  to  prove  the  posting  of"
"that  letter  on  07.06.2011.    Hence,  upon  this  letter,  this  Court"
"cannot  come  to  the  conclusion  that  P8  complaint  was  received"
