"Title of the Parties"
"In  a  partition  action  it is  the bounden  duty of  the  Court  to  investigate  the  title  of  the"
"parties.  According to the Plaintiff's evidence, the Plaintiff's father Wawanna Mohammadu"
"Ismail  became  entitled  to  a  J,4  share  of  the land called  Kolonganawatta  by Deed  No.l426"
"dated 20.07.1939 marked (P3) and thereafter his father had donated the said J,4  share of the"
"land in extent 3 lahas kurakkall  to the Plaintiff by Deed No.14570  dated 25.04.1968, marked"
"(P4). In his evidence in  chief the Plaintiff had traced his pedigree, according to which his"
"possession  of  the  undivided  J,4  share, 
father  and his  predecessors  in  title  had  been  in"
"another J,4  share to the 1"" Defendant and an unclivided Y2  share to the 2nd Defendant. He has"

"says further  that  Podisingho gave  coconuts or money  to his father.  This shows that after"
"the Plaintiff's  father had become the  owner of 1/4th share, Poclisingho treated him as  his"
