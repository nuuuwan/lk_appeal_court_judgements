"When  considering  the  claim  of  the  Defendants,  most  of  the  witnesses  who  had  given"
"evidence on theit behalf, were speaking from knowledge commencing after the action was"
"instituted, or just about a few years before the date of the plaint. It must be noted that the"
"possession of the parties after the action is  instituted cannot  be  taken into consideration"
"as  if  they  have  had  long  possession.  The  uninterrupted  possession  must  over  ten  years"
"prior to the institution  of  the  action.  The  Plaintiff says  that he  became  entitled to  14th"
"share in 1968 and in the same year he had made a complaint to the ""Sarna Mandalaya""."
"This  partition  action  was  filed 
in  September,  1973, 
trial  commenced  in  1990  and  the"
"judgment was pronounced in 1996.  Taking these dates into consideration, the Defendants'"
"possession  after  institution  of  this  action  in 1973  does  not  inure  to  the  benefit  of  the"
"Defendants  as 
it  is  not 
the  uninterrupted  possession  alluded  to  in  Section  3  of  the"
"Prescription Ordinance."
"The witnesses for the Defendant had given evidence with short memories, i.e.,  almost closer"
"to  the  date  of  the  plaint,  and  having  regard  to  the  possession  of  the  Defendants,  that"
"possession of the land cannot be accepted to give rise to  prescriptive possession in favour"
"of the Defendants."
"It must be noted that except the Deed marked as VlO, all the other deeds denote different"
"boundaries  which  refer  to  a different land.  The  Deeds  VI  to  V9  cannot  be  accepted  as"
"deeds relevant to the corpus in this action. Even if the Defendants had been in possession"
