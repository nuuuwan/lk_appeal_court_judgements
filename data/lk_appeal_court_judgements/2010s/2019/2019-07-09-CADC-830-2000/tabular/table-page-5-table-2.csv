"done by the servant outside of or contrary to master's instructions are outside the scope"
"of his employment: but such a conception of the meaning of ""scope of employment"" is too"
"narrow.  Instructions  vary  in  character,  some  may  define  the work  to  be  done  by  the"
"servant,  others may prescribe the manner in which it is  to be  accomplished:  some  may"
"even indicate the end to be attained and others the means by which it is  to be attained."
"Provided the servant is doing his master's work or pursuing his master's ends he is acting"
"within the scope of his employment even if he disobeys his master's instructions as to the"
"manner  of  doing  the  work  or  as  to  the  means  by  which  the  end  is  to  be  attained ....."
"Consequently,  a  servant  can  act  in  disobedience  of  his  master's  instructions  and  yet"
"render his master liable for his acts""."
