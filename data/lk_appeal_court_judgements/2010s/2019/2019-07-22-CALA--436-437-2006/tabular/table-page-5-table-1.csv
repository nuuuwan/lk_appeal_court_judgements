"This provision invests the District Court with a discretion to fix another day or enlarge"
"or abridge the time that has already been granted."
"It is for this reason I opined that a date, albeit final, can yet be extended in normal course"
"provided sufficient  cause is  shown by the  party applying for  extension  of time.  If the"
"requirement of sufficient cause is satisfied, the Court can cast the party applying for  an"
"extension, in costs in order to mitigate the hardships on the other party. In fact in ABN~"
"Amro Bank v.  Conmix (Pvt) Ltd, (1996)  1 Sri LR 08~the Supreme Court stated that"
"Section 91A empowers the Court to grant further time to a defendant who has failed to"
"file answer, and this is so even if the plaintiff objects."
"J ameel, J. alluded to Section 91A in Rajapakshe v.  Senanayake (1987) 1 CALR 146."
"So 
the  quintessential  question  before  this  Court  is  whether  the  Defendant  showed"
"sufficient cause before the learned Additional District Judge in order to obtain a further"
"extension beyond 1th October 2006."
"When I examine the order made by the learned Additional District Judge (Court No.8)"
"dated  1th  October  2006 
for 
refusing 
to  grant  a  date, 
I  find 
that 
the  follOwing"
"considerations have been set out by him."
"1.  Nearly 7 months has been given to the Defendant to file answer."
"2.  The necessity to obtain documents from abroad is brought to the notice of Court"
"just a week before the date fixed finally for answer."
"3.  The motion is without any notice to the Plaintiff."
"4.  What  document  is  sought  to  be  transmitted  from  abroad  for 
the  purpose  of"
"preparing the answer is not intimated to Court."
"5. 
If the Defendant is in the process of obtaining the said documents, steps taken to"
"obtain them have not been established."
"In  the  circumstances  the genuineness  of the  application  for  an  extension  is  called  in"
"question and accordingly the learned Additional District Judge rejected the application."
"Therefore the learned Additional District Judge treated this as a failure to file answer and"
"fixed a date 05th December 2006 to have the matter appointed for an ex parte trial."
