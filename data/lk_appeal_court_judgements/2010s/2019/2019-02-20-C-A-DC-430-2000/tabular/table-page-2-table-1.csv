"This is an appeal filed by the 9th defendant-appellant (appellant)"
"against the Judgment of the District Court dated 17.07.2000."
"This is a partition action.  Whilst the case was in progress,  the"
"appellant  intervened.    She  was  made  the  9th  defendant  and"
"proxy  filed.1    However  she  never  filed  a  statement  of  claim.    In"
"the statement of claim of the 3rd and 6A defendants (with whom"
"the appellant is sailing together) and filed by the same registered"
"Attorney  of  the  appellant2, 
it 
is  stated 
in  paragraph  9  that"
"“Jamis  Singho  referred  to  in  paragraphs  4  and  6  of  the  plaint,"
"transferred  the  rights  which  he  got  from  the  Judgment  in  case"
"No.4702  to  Rajapaksha Arachchilage Dharmawathie Manike  (the"
"appellant)  by  Deed  No.  1650  dated  11.01.1984.”    Based  on  this"
"averment,  the  registered  Attorney  for  the  appellant  raised  issue"
"No. 23 at the trial.3  However, the appellant never produced the"
"said Deed No. 1650 either before the District Court or before this"
"Court  as 
fresh  evidence 
in  appeal. 
  Even 
in 
the  written"
"submissions filed before the District Court, the Attorney for the"
"appellant  never 
relied  on  Deed  No.  1650. 
  He  made  no"
"submissions on that Deed to the District Judge.4  Therefore, the"
"learned  District  Judge  rightly  answered 
issue  No.  23 
in  the"
"negative."
"The  appellant  raised  no  more  issues  in  the  District  Court  and"
"therefore, in my view, the matter shall end there."
