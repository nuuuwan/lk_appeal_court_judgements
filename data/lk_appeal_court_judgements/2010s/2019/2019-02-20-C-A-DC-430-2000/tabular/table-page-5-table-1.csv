"different  case  from  that  set  up  at  the  trial,  he  cannot  take"
"up a case in appeal which differs from that of the trial."
"The submission of learned President’s Counsel for the appellant"
"centers around on two Deeds: the Deed No. 18672 marked P2 by"
"the  plaintiff  in  evidence  whereby  the  plaintiff  got  rights  to  the"
"land  to  be  partitioned  from  James  Singho;  and  the  appellant’s"
"Deed  No.  1650,  which  was  never  produced.    His  submission  is"
"that  the  District  Judge  was  wrong  and  by  “Deed  No.18672"
"James Singho can only give 1/3 share.”5  However, by Deed No."
"1650,  James  Singho  has  transferred  to  the  plaintiff  only  ¼"
"share6 and therefore there is nothing wrong in that transfer."
"This  appeal  is  absolutely  devoid  of  merit.    Appeal  is  dismissed."
"The  appellant  shall  pay  a  sum  of  Rs.50,000/=  as  costs  of  this"
"appeal to the substituted plaintiff."
