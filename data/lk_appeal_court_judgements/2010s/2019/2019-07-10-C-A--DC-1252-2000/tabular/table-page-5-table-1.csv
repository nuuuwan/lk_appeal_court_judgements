"11.","The  party  claims  prescriptive  title  has  to  prove  that  his  possession  was"
"","adverse and independent to the Plaintiff. His occupation of the land has to be"
"","with a manifest intention to hold the land against the claim of all others and"
"","the possession has to be hostile or adverse to the rights of the true owner."
"12.","In the instant case the learned Trial Judge has clearly reasoned out as to why"
"","he  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  Appellants  have  failed  to  prove  their"
"","prescriptive  rights.  Although  there  is  evidence  that  the  Appellants  were  in"
"","possession of the respective  lots,  in evidence they have failed  to  establish a"
"","starting point where they  started possessing the land, hostile to the Plaintiff."
"","Mere possession for a prescriptive period will not suffice."
"13.","In  his  judgment  the 
learned  Trial  Judge  has  separately  considered 
the"
"","evidence on prescriptive possession adduced on behalf of the Appellants 1, 2"
"","and  3.  The 
learned  District  Judge  also  has  considered 
the  age  of  the"
"","plantations in considering the judgment."
"14.","Learned  District  Judge  also  has  given  good  and  sufficient  reasons 
for"
"","rejecting the evidence of the  1 st  Appellant on prescriptive title on lot No.  02"
"","of the plan P3,  and the basis he  decided to  grant an extent of 40 perches of"
"","land  appurtenant to  the  house  of the  1 st  Appellant.  He  had  said  at page  10"
"","(Page  199  of the brief)  of his judgment, that  although he  found  that the  1 st"
"","appellant could not prove prescriptive title to the whole lot No.2, that the  1 st"
"","Appellant  had  occupied the  house  there  in  since year  1981.  Therefore,  the"
"","learned District Judge  had  reasonably  decided to  grant the  1 st  Appellant an"
"","extent  of 40  perches  of land  appurtenant  to  the  house.  I  see  no  reason  to"
"","interfere with the decision of the learned District Judge."
