arked X, been separated into two as 22A and 22B (may be for"
"convenience or clarity).  Admittedly, 22A has been given on rent"
"to  the  co-operative  society,  and  22B  is  being  occupied  by  the"
"defendant."
"It  is  the  position  of  the  plaintiff,  which  was  accepted  by  the"
"learned  District  Judge,  that  the  plaintiffâ€™s  deceased  husband"
"came  into  possession  of  22B  with  the  leave  and  licence  of  the"
"plaintiff,  and  after  the  death  of  the  husband,  the  defendant"
"continued in occupation."
"As  this 
is  a  clear-cut  case,  there 
is  no  necessity 
for  me  to"
"scrutinize  the voluminous of evidence led  by the plaintiff at the"
"trial."
"The  defendant  in  her  evidence  clearly  admits  that  she  together"
"with  her  husband  and  children  came 
into  a  portion  of  the"
"building (22B); but says that she does not know who the owner"
"of  that  building  is,  who  the  keys  of  that  building  were  taken"
"from,  who  pays 
the  assessment 
rates

the  building  etc."
"Assessment rates are being paid by the plaintiff as seen from Y1-"

"the  premises. 
  She  never  says  that  she  maintained  adverse"
"possession  against  the  plaintiff  who  is  the  true  owner  of  the"
"premises. 
  This  building  was  not  an  abandoned  building."
"However, if I may say so, the cat is out of the bag, when she, by"
"issue No.12, takes up the position that she is entitled to recover"
"a sum of Rs. 40,000/= for improvements made to the premises"
"from the plaintiff."
