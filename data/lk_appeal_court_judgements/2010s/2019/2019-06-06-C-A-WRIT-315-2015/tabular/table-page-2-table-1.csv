"M
ahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The  petitioner  has 
filed 
this  application  against 
the  Ceylon"
"Electricity  Board  seeking  to  quash  P9  by  certiorari  and  restore"
"him in the position which he was prior to P9 by mandamus."
"It 
is  my  considered  view  that  the  reliefs  prayed 
for  by  the"
"petitioner are misconceived in law and therefore this application"
"is  bound  to  be  dismissed  in  limine  on  that  threshold  ground"
"alone."
"The  petitioner  cannot  straightaway  come  before 
this  Court"
"against  P9  decision  without  first  preferring  an  appeal  to  the"
"Appeal  Board  as  provided  for  in  the  Disciplinary  Code  marked"
"P18. 
  That 
is  on  the  basic  principle  that  when  there 
is  an"
"effective alternative remedy writ does not lie."
"The  petitioner  did  in  fact  go  before  the  Appeal  Board  and  the"
"Appeal  Board  did  partly  revise  P9  decision  by  Appeal  decision"
"marked P13."
"However  the  petitioner  in  these  proceedings  seeks  to  quash  P9"
"which has receded to the background upon Appeal decision P13"
"being made."
"What  the  petitioner  shall  challenge  is  not  P9  decision  but  P13"
"decision.1"
"The  mandamus  sought 
is  also  redundant  because 
if  P9 
is"
"quashed,  status  quo  ante  would  automatically  prevail  without"
"any further order."
