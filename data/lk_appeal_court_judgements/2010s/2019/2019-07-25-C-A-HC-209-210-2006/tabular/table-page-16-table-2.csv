"However,  the  1st  appellant  raised  the  question  of  the  propriety  of"
"sentence.  The  date  of  offence  is  13.01.2003  and  they  were  convicted  on"
"03.05.2006.  Their  appeal  was  taken  up  only  in  March  2019.  They  were"
"enlarged  on bail  pending appeal.  In view  of  the  totality  of  circumstances"
"and  the  long  gap  between  the  date  of  offence  and  the  determination  of"
"their appeal, this Court is of the view that it is appropriate that they do not"
"serve a custodial term."
