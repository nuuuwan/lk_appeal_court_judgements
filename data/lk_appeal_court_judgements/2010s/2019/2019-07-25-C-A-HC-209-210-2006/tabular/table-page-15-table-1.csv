"an  earlier  date  in  the  absence  of  any  bribery  officer.  The  inconsistency"
"highlighted by the 2nd  appellant that Amila implicated him for  solicitation"
"but  he  was 
indicted  only  for  aiding  and  abetting,  had 
in  fact  been"
"considered  by 
the 
trial  Court  at  length.  This  Court  concurs  with  the"
"conclusion  reached  by  the  trial  Court on this  issue  since  the  evidence  is"
"clear  that  both  appellants  have  conveyed  to  Amila  that  if  they  were  to"
"abstain  from  producing  the  tractor  and  timber  in  Court,  a  bribe  of  Rs."
"5000.00 needed to be paid. Hence, these complaints by the appellants have"
"no significant impact on the validity of the conviction."
