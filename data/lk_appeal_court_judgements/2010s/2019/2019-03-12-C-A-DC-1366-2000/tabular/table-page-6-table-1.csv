"It is essential in a vindicatory action, as much as in a partition"
"action, 
for  the  corpus  to  be 
identified  with  precision. 
  This"
"becomes  extremely  important  for  the  execution  of  the  decree  in"
"the event the plaintiff succeeds.  (David v. Gnanawathie [2000] 2"
"Sri LR 352, Gunasekera v. Punchimenika [2002] 2 Sri LR 43)"
"It  was  held  in  Peeris  v.  Savunhamy  (1951)  54  NLR  207  that  a"
"plaintiff  in  a  rei  vindicatio  action  such  as  this,  not  only  must"
"prove  dominium  to  the  land,  but  also  the  boundaries  of  it  by"
"evidence admissible in law."
"In Hettiarachchi v. Gunapala [2008] 2 Appellate Law Recorder 70"
"at  79  it  was  held  that  if  the  plaintiff  fails  to  identify  the  land"
"which  he  claims  dominium  with  the  land  on  the  ground,  his"
"action must fail."
"Justice Marsoof in Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at 378"
"had this to say on this matter: “The identity of the subject matter"
"is of paramount importance in a rei vindicatio action because the"
"object of such an action is to determine ownership of the property,"
"which  objective  cannot  be  achieved  without  the  property  being"
"clearly 
identified.  Where 
the  property  sought  to  be  vindicated"
"consists  of 
land, 
the 
land  sought 
to  be  vindicated  must  be"
"identified  by 
reference 
to  a 
survey  plan 
or 
other 
equally"
"expeditious  method. 
It 
is  obvious 
that  ownership  cannot  be"
"ascribed  without 
clear 
identification  of 
the  property 
that 
is"
"subjected 
to  such  ownership,  and 
furthermore, 
the  ultimate"
