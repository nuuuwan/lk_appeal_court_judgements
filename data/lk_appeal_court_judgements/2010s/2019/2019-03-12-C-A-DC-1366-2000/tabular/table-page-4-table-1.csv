"T
he  plaintiffs  have  got  a  Plan  prepared  for  the  purpose  of  this"
"case.  That Plan was marked as P2.  The surveyor who prepared"
"that Plan in his report has stated that the land surveyed is 36.4"
"Perches  less  than  the  land  described  in  the  second  schedule  to"
"the  plaint.    The  surveyor  in  his  evidence  has  stated  that  he  is"
"unable to state from which side, the land has got reduced.  The"
"surveyor  further  states  that  he  is  unable  to  state  that  the  land"
"surveyed and depicted in Plan P2 is the same land described in"
"the  second  schedule  to  the  plaint  because  the  Plan  No.  518"
"described 
in 
the  second  schedule 
to 
the  plaint  was  never"
"produced to him.  This is critical.  It is clear that the boundaries"
"described in the second schedule to the plaint do not tally with"
"those in Plan P2."
"Despite these glaring discrepancies and infirmities in respect of"
"the  identification  of  the  land,  the  learned  District  Judge  has"
"entered Judgment for the plaintiff substituting the land depicted"
"in Plan P2 for the land described in the second schedule to the"
"plaint.  This conclusion is plainly unacceptable on the evidence"
"of the surveyor, who made Plan P2."
"When I read the Judgment of the learned District Judge, which"
"runs into 24 pages, it is clear that she has tried her best to give"
"equitable  reliefs  to  the  plaintiffs.    This  is  made  amply  clear  by"
"reading  the  paragraph  of  the  Judgment  which  appears 
just"
"before the answers to the issues.2  At the end of that paragraph"
"the learned Judge says that once the Plan No. 518 is found, the"
"plaintiff  can  re-demarcate  the  boundaries! 
  That  means,  the"
"learned  Judge  has  given  a  temporary  order  until  the  Plan  No."
