"Defendant.  Being  aggrieved  with  this  judgment  dated  21.05.1999,  the  2A,  3rd  and  4th"
"Defendant~Appellants  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred 
to  as  ""the  Appellants"")  have"
"preferred this  appeal to this Court.  The judgment of the District Court of Kegalle dated"
"21.05.1999  was  impugned  by  the  learned  President's  Counsel  on  two  grounds  namely"
"both the identity of the corpus and the extent of the land have not been established by"
"the Plaintiff."
"This Court will then go into the grounds of impugnment."
"Identity of the corpus"
"a)  Eastern Boundary"
"The schedule to the plaint depicts the eastern boundary of the land to be partitioned as"
"""Meegahamulawaua Ivura"" but the Deeds bearing Nos.5115  and 612  that were produced by"
"the Plaintiff in order to prove  the pedigree both  state that the eastern boundary of the"
"land is a land known as ""Meegahawatte Hena"" belonging to one Singappu Aadin."
"It has to be noted that the Plaintiff on a commission had the land surveyed by licensed"
"surveyor  T.M.T.B.  Thennakoon  who  returned 
to  court  a  plan  bearing  No.266  and"
"according to this plan, the land sought to be partitioned by the Plaintiff consists of two"
"lots (lot No.1 and lot No.2) which constitutes an extent of 1 acre, 1 rood and 37 perches."
"The survey had been done on 17.08.1973  and almost 10 years later at the trial, the Plaintiff"
"sought to confine the corpus to be partitioned to lot  No.1  and excluded lot No.2 from"
"the partition~vide proceedings dated 03.10.1984."
"In the course of the trial there is evidence that the Plaintiff admitted that the land that he"
"was seeking to partition was surveyed on his instructions and it was only 10  years later"
"that it dawned upon him what the real boundaries  of the land sought to be partitioned"
"should be~see proceedings dated 17.01.1993 at p.1l2 of the appeal brief."
"Thus it is  clear that the Plaintiff failed  to establish the eastern boundary of the corpus."
"The Plaintiff concedes that what lies  to the east  of lot 1 (the land to which he confined"
"himself at the trial) is ""LiyanagahamulhenaÂ»~lot 2, which is claimed by the 2nd Defendant."
