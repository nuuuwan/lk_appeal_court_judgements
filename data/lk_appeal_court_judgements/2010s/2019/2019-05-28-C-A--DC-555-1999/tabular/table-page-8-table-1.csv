"perches.  But if one looks at the preliminary plan bearing No.266,  the extent of the land"
"comprising  Lot  1  and  Lot  2  is  237  perches.  Assuming  that  the  land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned must be confined to Lot 1,  as  was claimed by the Plaintiff 10  years  after the"
"preparation of the plan, then its extent would be 170 perches."
"Thus there is a discrepancy between the extent given in the plaint and the plan bearing"
"No.266.  It must be stated that the learned Additional  District Judge of Kegalle does  not"
"bring  to  bear  her  mind  on  this  discrepancy.  The  learned  Additional  District Judge"
"proceeded to allow partition as claimed by the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant because the"
"land was smaller than the one claimed by the 2nd Defendant.  At page 173  of the  appeal"
"brief,  the learned Additional  District Judge  states  ""®>CB®  ~~~"" (whatever be  the"
"boundaries )."
"In  light  of  the  fact  that  the  Appellants  in  their  statements  of  claim  did  not  seek  a"
"partition of Lot 1 and Lot 2 but only sought a dismissal of the Plaintiff's action, it would"
"be  contrary to  the  allow  the  Plaintiff's  claim  merely because  the  land claimed  by  the"
"Defendants is smaller than the land surveyed.  The learned Additional District Judge has"
"not adhered to imperative duty of the Plaintiff to prove not only title but also identity of"
"the corpus."
