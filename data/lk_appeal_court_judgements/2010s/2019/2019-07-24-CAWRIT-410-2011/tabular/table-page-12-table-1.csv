"September  2010.  The  result  of 'Pl2'  is  that the  4th  Respondent  as  well  as  the"
"Petitioner does  not have  any  right to the  land  that is  the subject matter of the"
"Grant 'Pl' and  has culminated in this action."
"This  being  the  background  to this  application,  this  Court  would  now  consider"
"the three grounds on  which ttie  learned  C0l.!ns~1 for the Petitioner is  see_king  a"
"Writ  of Certiorari  to  quash  'Pl2'.  Firstly,  the  Petitioner  states  that  an  inquiry"
"was  not  held  prior to  'Pl2'  being  issued.  Secondly,  the  Petitioner  states  that"
"the 1st  Respondent had  no  power to cancel the devolution of ownership to the"
"4th  Respondent.  Thirdly, 
the  Petitioner  states 
that 
in 
terms  of  the  Land"
"Development  Ordinance,  the  land  should  devolve  on  the  4th  Respondent  by"
"the  eldest  son,  upon  Dingiri  Menika 
virtue  of  the  4th  Respondent  being"
"relinquishing her rights as  nominee."
"A  consideration  of  the  above  grounds 
requires 
this  Court 
to 
re-visit 
the"
"position of the 1st  and  2nd  Respondents, which is that the increase in the extent"
"of the land from  1A 3R  to 2A  3R  37.9P as  borne out by  'P3' is  inadvertent and  is"
"a  mistake.  Quite  apart  from  being  inadvertent,  this  Court  reiterates  its  view"
"that  the  1st  Respondent  has  no  legal  authority  to  increase  the  extent  of the"
"land,  over and  above  what  has  been  allocated  by  the  Grant.  Furthermore,  by"
"the  Petitioner's  own  admission  in  paragraph  5 of the  petition,  Kiri  Mudiyanse"
"only had  1A 3R  37.9P, of which X acre  had  been given to the MPCS,  resulting in"
"Kiri  Mudiyanse  only  having  1A  3R,  for  which  extent  of land  he  was  given  the"
"Grant  'Pl'.  By  a written  statement  made  under oath  by  the  4th  Respondent  in"
"in 
2005,  produced  by  the  Respondents  marked  'R2',  the  4th  Respondent  had"
"12"
