"Grant was  issued. This  position is  in fact confirmed by a statement made by the"
"4th  Respondent on  10th  December 2007,  a copy of which  has  been tendered to"
"this Court by the 1st  Respondent by way of a motion dated 30th  May 2019. 4"

"not  enter  into  possession  at  all,  either  as  the  nominated  successor  or as  the"
"spouse  of  Kiri  Mudiyanse.  Therefore,

"Development  Ordinance,  if the  nominated  successor fails  to succeed,  the title"
"to the holding shall devolve as  prescribed  in  Rule  1 of the Third Schedule."
