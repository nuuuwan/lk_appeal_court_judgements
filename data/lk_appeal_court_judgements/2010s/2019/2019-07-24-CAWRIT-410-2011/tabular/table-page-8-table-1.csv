"This  Court  must  observe 
that 
'P3' 
too  does  not  have  a  reference 
to  a  lot"
"number  or  a  Plan. 
'P3'  does  not  state 
the  basis  on  which 
the  Divisional"
"Secretary  had  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  extent  of the  land  should  be"
"increased from the extent specified  in the Grant. The  only explanation appears"
"to be  that when  Supplement  No.1  to Plan  No.  1574 was  prepared  in  1981,  Lot"
"No.7 hadbeen divided into five- Iot~. ~!,e-_ ~n_~rtnaJ-ls ffie su~ject ~~tte~ 0

"is  2A  3R  36P.5  Furthermore, 
'P3',  has 
failed  to  take 
into  consideration  the"
"endorsement made on 'Rl' that X acre has  been given to the M PCS."
"More  importantly, the  Divisional  Secretary,  by  issuing  'P3',  has  acted  contrary"
"to  th~ provisions  of Section  19(2)  of the  Land  Developmel')t prdinqnce, ~hich"
"provides that a permit shall  be  issued  in  the first instance and  a Grant is  issued"
"inter  alia  only  once  the  land  has  been  developed  by  the  permit  holder.  This"
"would  necessarily  mean  tha_t  the  extent  of the  land  given  by  way  of a  permit"
"shall  be 
identical 
to 
the  extent  of  the 
land 
for  which  a  Grant 
is 
issued"
"sUbsequently."
"What is  most important however is  that a Grant for a pre-determined extent of"
"land  can  only  be  issued  by  HE  the  President6 
and  thus,  a  Divisional  Secretary"
"does  not  have  the  power,  with  or without any  basis,  to increase  the extent of"
"land given by the State ."
"In  the se  circumstances, thi s Court is  of the view that the increase of the extent"
"of land  by 'P3'  is  ult ra vires the powers of the Divisional Secretary and  is  illegal."
"The  en t itlement  of  Kiri  Mudiyanse  and  his  successors 
therefore  should  be"
