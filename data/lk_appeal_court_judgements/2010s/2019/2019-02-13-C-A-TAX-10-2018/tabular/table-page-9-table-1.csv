"In my view these provisions support the view that the case stated to this Court in terms of section"
"11A (1)  of the TAC  Act  is  in  a fact  a step  in  the  appeal  made  by the Appellant to the TAe.  That"
"appeal commenced before the commencement date of the Act and as such comes within section"
"202(5)  of the Act.  Accordingly,  it has to be  continued and  disposed  of as  if the Act had  not come"
"into force."
