"â€¢","In the case of Padfield v.  Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968) AC  997"
"","(HL),a  seminal case  on giving reasons  Lord  Upjohn observed,""if he  does  not give  any"
"","reason for  his  decision,  it may be,  if circumstances  warrant it,  that a court may  be  at"
"","liberty to come to the conclusion that he had no good reason of reaching that conclusion .... "".  In"
"","the same breath Lord Pearce too echoed the same notion,""lf he gives no reason whatever"
"","for taking a contrary course, the court may infer that he had no good reason ..... "".  Though"
"","Padfield  is  one  of  the  leading  administrative  law  cases,  it  was  in  fact  an  action  for  a"
"","declaration rather than an application for a prerogative order,see this reasoning in a civil"
"","appeal  CA  203/2002  Upali  Palitha  Mahanama  v.  Wijayhenagedara  Sumanawathie"
"","(CA minutes of 25/05/2018)."
"","The  first  question  in  any  inquiry  under  Section  86(2)  is  whether  the  ex parte  default"
"","judgment was procedurally proper and this depends on whether a condition precedent"
"","has  been satisfied namely  whether a proper order for  ex parte  trial had been made  and"
"","whether the defendant has failed to purge his default."
"","This  examination must be manifest upon the order refusing to set aside  the judgment"
"","entered upon default. If this order is not available for the review of this Court, there is no"
"","proper inquiry that has been conducted in regard to default."
"","In  the  circumstances  I proceed to  set  aside  the expression  of  a  so,called order in the"
"","journal entry  dated  28th July  2000  and  consequently  the  ex parte judgment  dated  23rd"
