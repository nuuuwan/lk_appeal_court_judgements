"was issued.  It would appear that the case had been called on a number of dates but the"
"answer had not been filed  even by 22nd January 1999.  Accordingly the ex parte trial was"
"held on 23rd  February 1999 and the judgment was delivered on 23rd  March 1999.  By way"
"of a petition and affidavit dated 19th October 1999, the Defendant sought to vacate the ex"
"parte judgment by pleading that he had been hospitalised owing to conditions relating to"
"heart  and  lung  for  about  six  months  and  as  a  result  he  was  not  able  to  instruct  his"
"lawyers. In his petition the Defendant moved that the ex parte judgment delivered on 23rd"
"February  be  set  aside  and  that  he  be  permitted to  file  answer.  The  Plaintiff filed  the"
"objections and at the inquiry that took place under Section 8(2) of the Civil Procedure"
"Code, the defendant give evidence stating that he had been unwell for some time and due"
"to the illness he could not give instructions to his Attorney~at~Law."
"The learned District Judge of Horana had made his  order on 28th July 2000 refusing the"
"Defendant's application to have the ex parte judgment and decree set aside."
"Needless  to  say,  under  Section  86(2)  the  Defendant  has  to  satisfy  Court  that he  had"
"reasonable grounds for  his  default.  The Journal Entry for  28th July 2000  states that the"
"Defendant's application to have the ex parte judgment and decree has been refused.  This"
"appeal is against that order."
"I do not find the order in the appeal brief. Section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code lays"
"down that the  order  setting aside  or refusing  to set aside  the judgment entered upon"
"default shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon the facts  and specifying"
"the  grounds  upon which it is  made,  and  shall  be  liable  to  an  appeal  to  the  Court of"
"Appeal."
"Thus it is  crystal clear that an imperative requirement of Section  88(2)  is  that when a"
"District Judge  refused  to  set  aside  the  judgment  entered  upon  default,  he  must  give"
"reasons for his decision and if such reasons are not found,  the order refusing to set aside"
"the judgment entered upon default is liable to be set aside in this Court as if no reasons"
