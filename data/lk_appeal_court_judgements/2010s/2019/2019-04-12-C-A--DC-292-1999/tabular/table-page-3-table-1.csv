"The Respondents filed their answer preferring a claim in reconvention"
"and denying the claim of the Appellant. Accordingly, the Respondents"
"sought  for  a  declaration  that  the  2nd  Defendant-Respondent  is  the"
"owner of the land described in the schedule to the plaint."
"The trial commenced on 2 admissions and 19 issues. Out of the issues,"
"1-14  are  recorded  by the  Appellant  and  15-19  were  recorded  by  the"
"Respondents.  After 
conclusion  of 
the 
trial, 
the 
learned  District"
"delivered  the  judgment  on  29.01.1999  in  favour  of  the  Respondents"
"and dismissed the case of the Appellant."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  judgment,  the  Appellant  preferred  this"
"appeal,  to  set  aside  the 
judgment  and  grant  relief  sought  to  the"
"amended plaint."
"When elucidate the purported basis of his case, the Appellant stated"
"that, his Brother-in-law namely, S. M.  Arsheen was the  owner of  the"
"lot  A2  of  Plan  1685A  and  that  he  sold  the  said 
land  to  the  2nd"
"Defendant by way of Deed No. 3243 (P3) and placed his possession in"
"lot  B2.  Thereafter  the  said  Arsheen  had  sold  the  said  B2  to  the"
"Appellant by Deed bearing Nos. 3363 and 3363 dated 19.09.1987 and"
"12.09.1989 
respectively. 
Therefore, 
it  was 
the  position  of 
the"
"Appellant that while, the Respondents placed in possession only in lot"
"A2, they had entered the said lot B2 illegally."
"Therefore,  it  was  the  position  of  the  Appellant  that  what  the  said"
"Arsheen sold to the 2nd Defendant-Respondent is not B2 but it is lot A2"
"and  the  Notary  has  made  a  mistake  and  the  said  Arsheen  did  not"
"know of the said mistake."
