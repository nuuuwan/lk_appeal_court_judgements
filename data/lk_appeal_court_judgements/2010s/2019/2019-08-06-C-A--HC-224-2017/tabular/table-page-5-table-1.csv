"","misled  as  the  charge  did  not  specifY  the  gun,  is  untenable.  Possessing  any"
"","gun  without  a 
licence 
is  an  offence 
in 
terms  of section  22(1).  When 
it"
"","comes  to  sentencing,  section  22(3)  applies  and  that was  clearly  mentioned"
"","in  the  charge.  I  am  of the  view  that  the  Appellant  was  not  misled  by  the"
"","It  has 
not  caused  any  prejudice 
to 
the 
charge  as  mentioned  before."
"","Appellant."
"08.","Counsel  for  the  Appellant  in  his  written  submissions  filed  on  28.06.2019,"
"","after  the  oral  arguments,  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial  Judge  failed  to"
"","satisfY  himself that  the  Appellant  rightly  comprehended  the  effect  of his"
"","plea, and therefore had  not  followed  the procedure laid  down  in  section  197"
"","of the Criminal Procedure Code."
"09.","The  journal  entry  dated  27.09.2017  clearly  demonstrates  that  the  leamed"
"","Trial Judge had read and  exp lained  the  charges to  the Appellant. Further, as"
"","I  explained  before  in  paragraph  01  of the judgment, when  considering  the"
"","sequence 
of  events 
that 
had 
taken 
place 
between 
27.04.2017 
and"
"","27.09.2017,  it  is  clear  that  the  Appellant  was  well  aware  of what  he  was"
"","charged  for.  It was  on  appl ication  by  his  own  counsel that the  charges were"
"","again read and explained to the Appellant on  27.09.2017, at which point the"
"","Appellant  pleaded  guilty.  Therefore,  the  contention  above  by  the  counsel"
"","for  the Appellant is untenable."
"10.","Counsel  for  the  Appellant  further  contended  that,  however,  the  sentence"
"","imposed  by  the  learned  Trial  Judge  is  excessive.  Inviting  the  attention  of"
"","the Court to  S.C.  Appeal  No. 17/20 13 and S.C.  Reference 03/2008, counsel"
"","submitted 
that 
notwithstanding 
the 
prescribed  minimum  mandatory"
