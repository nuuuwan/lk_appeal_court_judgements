"A
s seen from Journal Entries 50-56, after the conclusion of the trial,"
"the  case  had  been  called  in  open  Court  for  5  times  for  corrections,"
"tendering  documents  etc.,  and  at 
last, 
the 
Judgment  had  been"
"delivered on 08.12.1997."
"By  that  Judgment,  undivided  rights  have  been  given  to  the  Plaintiff,"
"the  1st-3rd,  7th-10th,  18th-23rd,  33rd-35th  Defendants;  and  out  of  35348"
"shares,  6419  shares  have  been  left  unallotted.    That  means,  the  17th,"
"27th,  28th,  29th,  30th  and  31st  Defendants  have  not  been  given  any"
"shares."

"unexplained  and  unjustifiable.    Needless  to  emphasize  that  a  party"

"Out of the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants, the 28th-30th"
"Defendants  cannot, 
in  my  view,  complain  anything  as 
they  were"
"represented by an Attorney-at-Law at the trial."
"The  17th,  27th,  28th,  29th,  30th  and  31st  Defendants,  in  their  counter"
"objections  dated  10.08.2002 
state 
that, 
the  17th,  27th 
and  31st"
"Defendants were neither present nor represented at the trial date.  So"
"what?    The  Plaintiff  correctly  made  them  parties  to  the  case,  but"
"stated that their entitlements to the land are not known to him.  The"
"17th,  27th  and  31st  Defendants

filed  proxies,  but"
