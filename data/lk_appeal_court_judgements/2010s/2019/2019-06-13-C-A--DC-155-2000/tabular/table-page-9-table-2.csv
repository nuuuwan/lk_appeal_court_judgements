"The  plaintiff in  Pa/isena  v.  Perera  {56  N.L.R.  407}  was  a permit holder under the Ordinance.  He"
"sued the defendant, whom he alleged to be a trespasser, for ejectment and consequential relief."
"Gratiaen  J.  characterized  the  action  as 
{(a  vindicatory  action  in  which  a  person  claims  to  be"
"entitled to exclusive enjoyment of the land in dispute, and asks that, on  proof of that title, he  be"
"placed  in  possession against an  alleged trespasser"".  {supra. page 408} There is  no indication that"
"the plaintiff in that case sought a declaration of ownership as the Plaintiff-Appellant sought to do"
"I am therefore of the view that the ratio decidendi in Palisena v.  Perera {supra} does

"not enable the plaintiff in this case to maintain an  action for declaration of ownership to the land"
"given to him under a permit issued in terms of the Ordinance."
