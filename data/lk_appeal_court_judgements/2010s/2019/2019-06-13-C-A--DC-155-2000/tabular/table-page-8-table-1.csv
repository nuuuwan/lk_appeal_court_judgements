"of the word  ""owner"" in section 2 (4)  (c)  of the Rent Act."
"This is clear when he states that:"
"flit seems to me that, the observations made in of Jinawathie v.  Emalin Perera (supra) with"
"regard to the attributes of Ownership required to maintain a rei vindicatio should  not be"
"applied  fllock,  stock and  barrel\\, to determine the meaning of the word  ""owner"" used  in"
"section 2 (4) (c)  of the Rent Act"" (page 13)."
"The  learned counsel  for the Appellant submitted that he  has  not sought a declaration that he  is"
"the owner of the land  in  dispute and  in  the alternative that he  is  the owner within the meaning"
"of the Ordinance in view of the amendment made by Act no.  27 of 1981 to the word flowner""  in"

"a  declaration  that  he

the  owner  within  the  meaning  of  the  Ordinance.  The  meaning  of"
"flownership"" in  section 2(k) of the Ordinance is for the purposes of the Ordinance only."
"Accordingly in  determining whether the Appellant is entitled to the declaration sought it must be"

"In  determining this issue,  I am  of the view that the principle stated in Attorney General v.  Herath"
"(supra)  and Jinawathie et al v.  Emalin  Perera  (supra)  must be  applied  and  the Appellant should"
"possess the rights referred to therein, although they need  not all  be  present in  an  equal  degree"
"at one and  the same  time, to be  entitled to a declaration that they are the owners of the lands"

"The  permit (Pi) issued  to the Appellant is  found  at page  195 of the Appeal  Brief. The  Appellant"
"has  not been  granted any right of alienation to the state  land.  The  rights to possession  and  use"
"and  enjoyment are  also  subject to certain  limitations.  In  the aforesaid circumstances,  I have  no"
"hesitation in concluding that the Appellant is  not in  any event entitled to a declaration that he  is"
