"Minister's sole power under that section is to decide the question of urgency to meet the"
"need for which an  order was  made under section  2 and/or section 4"""
"Clearly the Supreme Court  held  that the Minister can  make  an  Order under this section  only on"
"the grounds of urgency.  It follows that in  assailing such  an  Order the only ground on  which  it can"
"be done is the lack of urgency. It is immaterial that an  order under section 5(1) of the Act has  not"
"been  made."
"Furthermore, in Fernandopulle v.  Senanayake,  Minister of Agriculture (supra) the Supreme Court"
"also held that it is however a matter for a Petitioner who seeks the remedy by way of Certiorari,"
"to satisfy the Court that there was in fact no urgency and his application cannot succeed should"
"he fail to do so.  (emphasis  added).  Hence the burden of proof was  on  the Petitioner to adduce"
"evidence that there was  no urgency and  if he fails to do so,  his application must be dismissed."
