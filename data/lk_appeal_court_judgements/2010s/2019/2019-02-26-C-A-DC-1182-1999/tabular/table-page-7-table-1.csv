"which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to"
"have admitted by their pleadings:"
"Provided  that  the  Court  may,  in  its  discretion,  require  the  facts"
"admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission."""
"Thus,  in  my  view,  according  to  the  above  provision,  the"
"admission of a fact may perhaps take place at three stages-to wit- (1) at the"
"hearing  or  trial,  (2)  before  the  hearing  or  trial,  or  (3)  by  rule  of  pleading."
"Therefore, the said admission of this case which I have alluded above is at"
"the stage of hearing of trial."
"In  the  case  of  K.  G.  Jayanath  Kulasiriwardena  vs.  J.  A."
"Ranjanie  Jayasinghe  and  3  others  [SC/Appeal/146/12,  (Supreme  Court"
"Minutes dated: 17.02.2016)] Aluwihare P. C., J. observed that:"
"“Admissions recorded  by the parties  in any  proceeding, are not the"
"same  as  Admissions  contemplated  in  section  17  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance, but are ""admitted facts"" within  the meaning of  Section"
"58 of the Evidence Ordinance. Section 17 of the Evidence ordinance"
"defines  Admissions  and  Confessions  and  is  a  provision  governing"
"relevancy.  Section  17  (1)  read  with  Section  21  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance merely permits a ""statement” to be admitted as evidence"
"if  that  ""statement""  falls  within  the  definition  of  an  Admission  in"
"terms  of  section  17  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance.  That  is  to  say  the"
"trial  judge  is  required  to  evaluate  the  item  of  evidence  so  adduced"
"under  section  21  and  consider  the  probative  value  that  should  be"
"attached  to  it.  It  is  entirely  at  the  discretion  of  the  judge  to  decide"
