"Statement of Objections filed by the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent had also sought"
"permission  from 
the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Buddha  Sasana  and  Religious  Affairs 
to"
"construct or maintain a place of worship and in consequence the 3rd Respondent received"
"a letter dated 04.01.2017 from  the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Buddha"
"Sasana  stating that the particular land had not been legally  transferred and requested"
"that  the  application  for  registration  be  submitted  after  having  fulfilled  the  relevant"
"requirements. A number of persons from the village of Abeypura, Pulasthigama had made"
"a request of the District Secretariat of Polonnaruwa dated 08.11.2014  seeking permission"
"for  registration  and  construction  of  the  new  temple.  It  is 
the  contention  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent  that since  the villagers  have  been  associated with him,  the  Petitioner has"
"acted with malice and he avers  that this application has been made mala fide  to prevent"
"the construction of the new temple and its religious activities."
"The  laudable  objective  of  the  3rd  Respondent  is  brought  out  by  the  fact  that  he  had"
"commenced  the  construction  of  the  new temple  at  the  request  of  the  villagers  and  it"
"would  appear 
that  he 
is  motivated  with  a  genuine 
intent 
to  uplift 
the  spiritual"
"knowledge of the villagers  and community of the area.  The uncontroverted assertion of"
"the  3rd  Respondent  is 
that  among  other  community  services  of  the  new  temple,  it"
"maintains  a  training  centre for  Samanera  Bhikkus  publishing  Thripitaka  Dharma  and"
"Sunday Daham School."
"The  3rd  Respondent  also  has  stated in  his  affidavit  that the  main  requirements  which"
"should be in a temple i.e.  Bodhi  Prakaraya,  Bodhi  Kutiya  and Ghantara Kuluna  are  all"
"perfectly  completed  and  the  Sangawasaya  has  been  constructed with  the  approval  of"
"Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha. Thus it would appear that the 3rd Respondent has obtained"
"a sanction of all authorities to construct a temple and if at all, the question whether the"
"3rd Respondent and any other persons possess the right to construct a temple within the"
"land on a state grant is  a matter for  the 1st Respondent, Divisional Secretary, Lankapura"
"who represents the interest of the state and this Court observes no  objections towards"
"the construction of this temple from this Respondent."
