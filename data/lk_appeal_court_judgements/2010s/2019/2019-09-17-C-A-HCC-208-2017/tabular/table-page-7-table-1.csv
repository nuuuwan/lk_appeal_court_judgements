"17.","It  was submitted  by  the counsel  for  the Appellant that,  as  the complainant is"
"","the sole witness to the  incident, her evidence has  to  be  corroborated. In  that"
"","he  said  that  the  clothes  contained  semen  were  not  produced  in  evidence."
"","Counsel  further  added  saying that,  there  is  no  presumption  that  the  children"
"","would tell the truth."
"18.","Complainant in  her evidence said that, she felt  semen between her thighs.  In"
"","her  words  she  said  that,  urine  dripped  on  her  thighs  from  the  penis  of the"
"","Appellant.  Neither  her  mother  nor  she  had  preserved  the  clothes.  She  said"
"","that,  the  mother may  have  washed  the  clothes.  PW2  said  that, clothes  were"

"","is  no  rule  of law  or evidence  which  says  to  the  contrary,  provided  the  sole"
