"","where 
they  were  cleaning 
the  well  after 
the  alleged 
incident,  she  had"
"","assaulted 
the  Appellant.  Therefore,  her  mother  had 
told  her 
that 
the"
"","Appellant  might  make  a  complaint  to 
the  police  against  the  said  assault,"
"","stating that they make false allegations."
"15.","Father  of the  complainant  (PW3)  also 
testified  about  the  assault  on 
the"
"","that 
they  went  to 
the  police 
Appellant  by  his  wife.  He  also  confirmed"
"","because they  thought that the Appellant might go and  complain  to  the police"
"","against 
the  assault.  Finally  he 
said 
that  he  did  not  go 
to 
the  police"
"","immediately, thinking that he  would  have had  to  face  problems at  the police"
"","station (page  180)."
"16.","Complainant had  been  11  years  old,  Therefore,  she could  not  have  gone  to"
"","the  police  station  alone.  Although  she  was  reluctant  to  tell  the  father  about"
"","the  sexual  assault,  she  had 
immediately 
told  her  mother  when  she  was"
"","questioned.  Being ordinary  villagers  who are  labourers,  may  be  reluctant to"
"","make complaints  on  this  kind  of sexual  offences on  their daughter, thinking"
"","twice  about 
the  girl's 
future.  PW2  also 
in  her  evidence  said 
that, 
they"
"","considered 
the  embarrassment 
that  would  cause 
to 
the 
child  as  well."
