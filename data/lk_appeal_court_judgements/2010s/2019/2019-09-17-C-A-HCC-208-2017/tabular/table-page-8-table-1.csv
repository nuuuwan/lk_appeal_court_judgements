"21.","As 
I  said  before,  as 
the  complainant  had  been  consistent, 
reliable  and"
"","promptly had told the mother about the  incident without delay and therefore,"
"","it  is  not unsafe  to  act on  her testimony alone. Hence, ground of appeal  No.6"
"","should also fail."
"22 .","Counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  contended 
that, 
the 
learned  Trial  Judge  has"
"","applied  the  'Lucas' Principle wrongly in  this  case.  Further,  it  was  submitted"
"","that the learned Trial judge has not analysed the defence case."
"23 .","In  page 44  of his  judgment (page  384  of the  appeal  brief)  the  learned  Trial"
"","Judge  has  rejected  the  defence version  that this  complaint was  made  to  take"
"","political  revenge.  The position  taken  by  the  Appellant  in  his  evidence  was"
"","that,  he  was  a  politician  and  was  the  chairman  of the  society  of a  political"
"","party.  His  opponents  had  threatened  him  that  they  would  make  him  loose"
"","the job. This  defence  was  never put to  the  witness  No.3  for  the prosecution"
"","by  the  Appellant.  The  suggestion  put  to  the  PW3  was  that,  this  complaint"
"","was  made due  to  the  fear  of Appellant making  a complaint  for  scolding the"
"","Appellant (page  193).  It was suggested  to  witness  No. 2 that, this  complaint"
"","was  made  due  to  the  instigation  of his  political  rivals.  Hence,  defence  has"

"","evidence  taken  as  a  whole  it  is  my  view  that,  the  learned  Trial  Judge  was"
"","correct  when  he  rejected  the  defence  version  and  accepted  the  evidence  of"
"","the  complainant  that  was  consistent,  probable,  and  trustworthy.  Hence,  the"
"","ground of appeal No.7 is  without merit."
