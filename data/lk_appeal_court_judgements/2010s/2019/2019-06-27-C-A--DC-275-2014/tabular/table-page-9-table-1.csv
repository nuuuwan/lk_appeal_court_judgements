"","mentioned  before,  Court will  not relieve  the parties  of the  consequences  of"
"","their own folly or negligence in applications of restitutio in integrum."
"17.","Petitioner  was  represented  by  counsel  on  09.03.2011  when  the  settlement"
"","was entered in open Court.  Therefore, Petitioner cannot say that she  did not"
"","know  about the proceedings  dated  09.03.2011.  This  application  is  made  on"
"","12th August 2014, more than 3 years after the order on settlement was made."
"","No  acceptable  reason  for 
the  delay  of more 
than  3  years 
to 
invoke  the"
"","jurisdiction of this court is  submitted by the petitioner. It was entirely due to"
"","the lack of diligence on the part of the Petitioner that has caused more than"
"","03  years  delay  to  come to  court.  Hence, the  Petitioner is  not entitled to  the"
"","relief sought in this application."
