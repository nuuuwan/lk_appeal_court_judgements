"De  Mel and Another [(1982)  1  Sri.loR ..  123  at  128]  this  Court  quoted  with  approval  Haniffa's"
"judgment as follows:"
"""The  petitioner's  application  is  beset  with  other  difficulties  as  well.  The  petitioner ha s"
"lo  P. de  Mel,  Commissioner of Labour,  the  respondent  to his  application.  It  is 
made  W."
"common ground that he has  now ceased  to hold this post and  is  presently the Secretary,"
"Ministry of Trade.  The  petitioner has  not sought to substitute the  present  holder of the"
"office. A Mandamus can  only issue against a natural  person, who holds a public office.  If"
"such  a  person  fails  to  perform  a  duty  after  he  has  been  ordered  by  Court,  he  can  be"
"punished  for  contempt  of Court. (See,  Haniffa  v.  The  Chairman,  U.  C.  Nawalapitiya,  66"
"NLR 48).  Before this Court issues a Mandamus, it must be satisfied that the respondent"
"will in fact be able to comply with the order and that in the event of non-compliance,"
"the  Court  is 
in  a  position  to  enforce  obedience  to  its  order.  Mandamus  will  not,  in"
"general,  issue  to compel  a respondent to do what is  impossible in  law or in fact. Thus, it"
"will not issue  ............... to require one who is functus officio to do what he  was formally"
