"The  Petitioner states that to the best of his knowledge, actual possession of the said land has not"
"been taken  over [paragraph  17 of the petition]. This  is a very unusual formulation for if the land"

"my view an attempt to suppress and/or misrepresent material facts since 2Rlsubmitted with the"
"objections  of the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents,  with  the  signature  of the  Petitioner,  is  proof that"
"vacant possession of the land in  dispute was taken  over by the State on 29.11.1999."

"if there has  been  suppression  and/or misrepresentation  of material facts.  It is  necessary in  this"
"context  to  refer to the following  passage  from  the  judgment of Pathirana  J  in  W.  S.  Alphonso"
