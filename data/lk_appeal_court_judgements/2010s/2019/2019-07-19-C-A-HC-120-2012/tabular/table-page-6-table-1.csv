"Grounds of appeal No. 01, 03 and 04.",""
"08.","These three grounds will be dealt together. It is the contention of the learned"
"","President's Counsel for the Appellant, that the learned Trial Judge has failed"
"","to  analyze the  evidence of the prosecution.  It was further submitted that the"
"","dock  statement  made  by  the  Appellant  was  not  considered  by  the  learned"
"","in 
the 
Trial  Judge.  There  had  been  another  person  with 
the  Appellant"
"","vehicle,  and as to what happened to him is not disclosed by the Prosecution."
"","Learned President's Counsel submitted that there is a doubt as to the person"
"","with whom the weapon was,  and that the  dock  statement in that regard was"
"","not considered by the learned Trial Judge."
"09.","Evidence  of PW1  was  that  he  saw  PW2  and  the  Appellant  pulling  the"
"","weapon.  PW2 had been outside the van and Appellant had been in the front"
"","passenger seat.  Just before the  vehicle  left,  the  weapon had come to  PW2's"
"","hand."

"","passenger  seat  and  not  the  driver,  as  stated  by  the  Appellant  in  his  dock"
"","statement.  Then,  PW2  had  gone  to  the  person  in  the  front  passenger  seat"
"","where he saw a weapon in between his legs. PW2  further said that the driver"
