"12.","Evidence of the PW1  and PW2 makes it clear that there was another person"
"","in the van.  Version of the Prosecution is that the 3rd  person was the driver at"
"","the time  of the  detection.  Evidence  of the  PW2  suggests  that the  owner of"
"","the vehicle  was the person who  was  driving.  PW2  said that when he  asked"
"","the driver for  the documents, the  driver asked him to  get it from  the person"
"","who  was 
in 
the  front  passenger  seat.  Although 
the  Embilipitiya  police"
"","stopped  the  vehicle  within  few  minutes,  only  the  Appellant  was  arrested"
"","with the van.  Prosecution has failed to  disclose the  3 rd  person, nor has taken"
"","any  interest  to  investigate  about  him.  Appellant  says  he  was  N amal  who"
"","owned  the  vehicle  and  that  he  did  not  know  about  a  weapon  being  in  the"
"","vehicle.  The  learned Trial  Judge has  failed  to  take  into  consideration about"
"","the presence of the  3rd  person in the vehicle,  with the dock statement of the"
"","appellant. A clear doubt is created as to whether the weapon involved was in"
"","the possession of the 3rd  person referred to  as  'Namal'  by the Accused,  and"
"","the  Prosecution  has  failed  to  exclude  that  doubt.  Although  their  evidence"
"","shows that the 3rd  person was driving the vehicle, police have failed even to"
"","investigate  about him.  The evidence  of PW2  as  mentioned in  paragraph  10"
"","of this judgment further  creates  doubts  about  the  detection  of the  weapon,"
