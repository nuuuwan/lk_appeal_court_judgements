"police officers under whose  custody the  weapon was.  However, the learned"
"Trial  Judge  has  addressed this  issue  sufficiently  in  pages  11  and  12  on  his"
"judgment. As rightly said by the learned Trial Judge, the productions in this"
"case are not illicit liquor or illicit drugs like heroin that cannot be  identified"
"by an identification mark or a number. In the instant case it is a weapon (T56"
"gun),  which has  an identification number engraved.  Prosecution has proved"
"that  the  weapon  taken  into  custody  at  the  detection,  and  analyzed  by  the"
"Government  Analyst  is  the  same  weapon  (T56  gun)  by  the  identification"
"number.  Hence,  the  learned Trial Judge was  right when he decided that the"
"chain of custody of the  weapon was  established by the prosecution and that"
"there is no  doubt that the weapon analyzed by the Government Analyst was"
"the same weapon detected by the police officers."
