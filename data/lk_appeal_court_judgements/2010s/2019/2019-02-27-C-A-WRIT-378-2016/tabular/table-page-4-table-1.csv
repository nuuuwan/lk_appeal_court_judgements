he  petitioner  has  tendered  only  a  copy  of  the  application  for"
"liquor 
licence 
sent 
for 
the  year  2015  marked  X9. 
  That"
"application  is  for  liquor  licence  in  the  category  of  F/L  12.    But"
"the  petitioner’s  reliefs  are  in  respect  of  liquor  licences  in  the"
"categories of F/L 7 and F/L 8 for the year 2016.  The petitioner"
"has  not  tendered  copies  of  those  two  applications,  but  only"
"tendered two receipts issued to obtain the applications for F/L 7"
"and  F/L  8.    It  appears  to  me  that,  the  petitioner  purposely  did"

"This  is  supported  by  X16  dated  16.03.2016  whereby  the  Sri"
"Lanka  Tourism  Development  Authority  has  written 
to 
the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Excise  recommending  the  issuance  of"
