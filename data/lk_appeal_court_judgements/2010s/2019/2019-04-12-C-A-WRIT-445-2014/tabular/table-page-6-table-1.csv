"a  bakery  and  has  established  a  business  and  has  renovated  the  premises"
"after a  substantial investment.  Although  Section  10  (1) of  the  Act  states  that"
"the  property  will  be 
requisitioned 
temporarily,  Section  10 
(4)  vests 
the"
"discretion on the Minister to issue a derequisitioning order. They further stated"
"that there is no time frame set out nor conditions to be fulfilled in order issue a"
"derequisitioning  order.  Moreover,  State  Counsel  for  the  Respondents  has"
"invited  an 
important 
fact 
that,  an  offer  was  made 
in  open  court 
for 
the"
"Petitioner to sell the premises at today’s market price since he has not utilised"
"the  premises  so  that  financial  compensation  can  be  made  but  the  Petitioner"
"refused to consider this offer and even to obtain a valuation."
"However,  finally,  Counsel  for  the  Respondent,  took  up  the  position  that,  the"
"derequisitioning is a discretion vested with the Minister and the circumstances"
"of  all  parties  must  be  considered,  therefore,  the  Petitioner  does  not  have  a"
"statutory right for derequisitioning thus is not entitled to a Mandamus."

"Provisions)  Act

"property by publishing an order to that effect in the Gazette. The purpose of"
"such  requisition 
is 
to  allow 
the  property 
to  be 
‘temporarily  used  by  a"
"principal  Society  for  the  purposes  of  any  business  of  such  Society’"
"Furthermore,  Section  10  (4)  of  the  same  Act  also  empowers  the  Minister  to"
"derequisition any such property by following the same procedure."
"Thus, there could be no question with regard to the Minister’s competence to"
"issue  a  derequisitioning  order.  However,  this  Court  needs  to  be  determined"
"(as  submitted  by 
the  Respondents) 
is  whether 
the  Minister’s  power 
is"
"amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court Sections 10 (1) and Section 10"
"(4)  say  that  the  Minister  „may‟  issue  a  requisitioning  and  derequisitioning"
"order. The text of the Act does not contain any express guidelines regulating"
"the exercise of the discretion. The issuance of the order therefore is a matter"
"that has been left to the discretion of the Minister. Where power is conferred"
"by  law  to  exercise  it  in  a  given  factual situation,  it may  either be a  duty  or a"
