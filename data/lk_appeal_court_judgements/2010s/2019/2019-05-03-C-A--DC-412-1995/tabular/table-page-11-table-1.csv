"merely procedural."
"A  non~conÂ£ormity with Section  12  gives  rise  to  a  j~risdictional defect  which  can  be"
"impugned both directly and collaterally.  If I may sum' up the effect of the 2nd  paragraph"
"in another way; a failure to effect due service of summons on 
paragraph of Section 48  (1)"
"any party may not vitiat~ partition decrees  but a failure  to file  a Section 12  declaration"
"correctly and accurately is more fundamental than a me.te omission or defect of p~ocedure."
"Adopting the above reasoning, I proceed to hold that all the steps that the District Court"
"took subsequent to  the s~age of Section 12  are a nullity and even the order made by the"
"to 
learned  District  Judge  ,ordering 
the 
intervention  of 
the  20th  Defendant  sl}bject"
"prepayment  of  costs  also  becomes  inoperative  and null  and void. 
In  other  words  the"
"District Judge of Kuliyapitiya  should have ensured that Section 12 was complied with. No"
"other steps could have been taken without the requirements of Section 12 being complied"
"that 
the

trying  partition  suits  should  ensure"
"requirements  of  Section' 12  are  strictly  followed  in  order  to  prevent  the  supervening"
