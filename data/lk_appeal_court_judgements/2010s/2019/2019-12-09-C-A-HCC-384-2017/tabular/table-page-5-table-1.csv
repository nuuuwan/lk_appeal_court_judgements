"about 3 months prior to  making the complaint at the Police Station (Page  107 of"
"the  brief).  During the  cross-examination, the  prosecutrix  answered  that  the  first"
"incident of sexual  abuse happened  in  the  latter part of year 2007 when  she was"
"in Grade 08 of the school (Page 138 of the brief)."
"In  the  instant  case,  the  perpetrator  was  the  father  of the  prosecutrix  who  was"
"normally expected to  be  in  the same house with the prosecutrix regularly.  Since"
"the  appellant  is  closely  associating  the  prosecutrix  daily,  it  is  quite  impossible"
