"Therefore,  it  is  manifestly clear that the Learned High Court Judge was  satisfied"
"•"
"about  the  trustworthiness  of the  witness.  It  is  trite  law  that  the  appellate  Court"
"should  not  disturb  the  findings  of the  Trial  Judge  who  has  a  better opportunity"
"of observing  the  witnesses  and  the  case  as  a  whole,  unless  such  finding  of the"
"Trial  Judge 
is  manifestly  wrong  [vide  Dharmasiri  V.  Republic  of Sri Lanka"
"(2010)  2 Sri LR 241  &  Chaminda  V.  Republic of Sri Lanka (2009)  1 Sri L.R."
"1441.  Therefore, I do not see any merits in the 2nd  ground of appeal."
"Now  [  wish  to  consider  last  two  grounds  of appeal  together,  in  which  it  was"
"argued  that  the  appellant  had  been  denied  a  fair  trial  as· the  defence  has  been"
"evaluated  improperly  and  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  misdirected  himself in 
law"
"and facts ."
