"For the foregoing reasons,  I hold that the petition of appeal  filed  in this case  is  defective as  it is"
"not in conformity with Rule 4(1) of the 1988 Rules and that the appeal must be dismissed in limine"
"on that ground alone."
"Question of Law"
"The  Respondent submits that the petition of appeal  is  confined to three elementary paragraphs"
"and  no question of law has  been proposed. While it is true that the petition of appeal  is  barest in"
"content and  may  not be  the  best  practice  to be  followed  by  legal  practitioners,  it contains the"
"questions  of law  in  compliance  with  Rule  4(2)  of the  1988  Rules.  Hence  the  third  objection  is"
"overruled."
