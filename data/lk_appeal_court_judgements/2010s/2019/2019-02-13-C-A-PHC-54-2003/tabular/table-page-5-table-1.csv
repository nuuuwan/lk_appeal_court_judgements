"In  these  circumstances,  I hold that the petition  of appeal  is  not in  conformity with  Rule  4(1)  of"
"the 1988 Rules  and  must be  rejected ."
"The 
learned  counsel 
for  the  2nd  and  3rd  Respondents-Respondents-Appellants  rel ied  on 
the"
"judgment in  A/uthhewage Harshani Chandrika  and another v. Ojjicer-in-Charge,  Police  Station,"
"Ka/utaro and others [CA(PHC)  65/2003;  C.A.M . 10.09.2013]  where it was  held  by A.W.A.  Salaam"
"J.  that there  is  no requirement in  an  appeal  from the judgment of the High  Court in  its exercise"
"of the revisionary  powers, for the registered  attorney-at-law to sign the petition of appeal.  The"
"Court took this view since the word ""registered attorney-at-law""  does not appear in  Rule  4(1) of"
"the 1988 Rules or Article 154P (6) of the Constitution. With the greatest respect to Justice A.W.A."
"Salaam, I am  unable to agree with the reasoning."
"Rule  4(1)  of the  1988  Rules  allows  the  petition  of appeal  to  be  signed  by  ""the appellant or his"
"Attorney-at-Law"". The Supreme Court when making the 1988 Rules appears to have made a clear"
"distinction  between an  attorney-at-law and  his attorney-at-law for Rule  4(2)  of the  1988  Rules"
"refers to an attorney-at-law."
"When does an attorney-at-law become, in relation to an  appellant, his Attorney-at-Law? It is only"
"when  an  appellant  authorizes  him  to act  on  behalf of the  appellant.  That  is  done through  the"
"filing of a proxy.  The  inveterate practice is to file a proxy with the petition filed in the High  Court"
"when  a  party  files  an  application  in  revision  against  an  order  made  by  a  Magistrate.  Unless"
"revoked,  that  proxy  is  valid  when  a  notice  of appeal  is  filed  against  the  judgment  of the  High"
"Court acting in  revision."
"In any event, even if it is accepted that there is no need in terms of the 1988 Rules for a registered"
"attorney-at-law to sign  the petition of appeal  in  an  appeal from the judgment of the High  Cou rt"
"in  its exercise  of the revisionary  powers,  in  the instant case  two proxies  were f iled on  behalf of"
"the p t to 3rd  Respondents-Respondents-Appellants which were valid and effective up to the date"
"filed .  The  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  Respondents-Respondents-Appellants 
the  petition  of  appeal  was"
"law. They  cannot 
therefore  cannot  be  heard  to  state  that  the  two  proxies  have  no  effect  in"
"approbate and  reprobate."
