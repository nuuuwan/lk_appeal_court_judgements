"allowed  the  petitioner  to  maintain  a  temporary  parking  area  in"
"the premises of the Wadduwa Railway Station for one year from"
"01.11.2010  on payment of a monthly rental.  In that  document"

the  petitioner  shall"
"unconditionally  hand  over  the  said  parking  area  whenever  it  is"
"needed to the Railway Department."
"The  petitioner  has  used  this  parking  area  to  earn  money  by"
"allowing  the  railway  commuters  to  park  their  vehicles  such  as"

"It  is  quite  obvious  that  X13  cannot  be quashed  by  certiorari  as"
"the said decision is neither illegal nor unjustifiable.  By informal"
"document  marked  X1, 
the  petitioner  has  been
