"(g)  shall  comply  with  the  provisions  of  any  written 
law"
"applicable to such school and matters relating to education."
"Section 6, in my view, does not apply to all Unaided Schools.  It"
"applies  only 
to 
former  Assisted  Schools  but 
later  became"
"Unaided “by virtue of an election made under section 5”."
"Section 5 allowed a proprietor of any Assisted School, by serving"
"a  written  notice  on 
the  Director  of  Education, 
to  elect 
to"
"administer that school as an Unaided School."
"The  school  under  consideration―Ashoka  College,  Horana―was"
"not  an  Assisted  School  which  became  an  Unaided  School  by"
"virtue  of  election  under  section  5  of  the  Act.    It  has  been,  from"
"the beginning, a Government Approved Private Unaided (English"
"Medium) School."
"The  predecessor 
to  Ashoka  College 
is  Marshall  Preparatory"
"School, which, according to the petitioners, has been founded in"
"late  1880s  by  a  European  lady  by  the  name  of  Miss.  Marshall."
"Since  then  this  Private  School  has  been  conducting  classes  in"
"English Medium."
"Hence 
the  decision  contained 
in  P12 
is  based  on  a  wrong"
"premise  and  therefore  bad  in  law.    Section  6  of  the  Assisted"
"Schools  and  Training  Colleges  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.5  of"
"1960 has no application to Ashoka College, Horana."
"I quash P12 by writ of certiorari.  Issuance of writ of prohibition"
"prohibiting  implementation  of  the  decision  contained  in  P12  is"
"superfluous.    However  I  formally  issue  writ  of  prohibition  as"
"well."
