"It  is,  therefore,  vital  to  answer  the  question  on  which  basis  the  Petitioner  has"
"been terminated from the University. The Termination letter clearly says that the"
"University  Council  had  decided 
to 
terminate 
the  Petitioner‟s  services  as  a"
"Probationary  Lecturer 
in  with  effect 
from  1st  June  2014,  on 
the  expiry  of"
