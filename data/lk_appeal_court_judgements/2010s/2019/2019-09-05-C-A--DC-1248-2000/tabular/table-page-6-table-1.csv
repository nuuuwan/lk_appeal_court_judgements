"bushels,  on  a  complaint  made  by 
the  Defendants  against  the  Plaintiff, 
the  Assistant"
"Commissioner  of  Agrarian  Services  ordered  the  Plaintiff  to  give  the  owners  80  bushels"
"before 25.01.1981 and if he failed to do so, action would be taken against him under Section"
"18(2) of the Agrarian Services Act to evict him from the land. This order was notified to the"
"Plaintiff by the Commissioner by his letter dated 01.01.1981 (V2)."
"Since  the  Plaintiff had  failed  to pay  the  rent  (80  bushels  of  paddy),  the  Commissioner"
"decided  to  evict  him  from 
the  land  (Description  of  the  land  is  given  in  (V3)  as 
'Ande"
"cultivator'. This order of the Commissioner had also been communicated to the Plaintiff by"
"V3  dated 06.04.1981.  U the  Plaintiff was  aggrieved by  the order,  he should have appealed"

"make  any  appeal,  the  decision  of  the  Commissioner  shall  be final  and  conclusive-{vide"
