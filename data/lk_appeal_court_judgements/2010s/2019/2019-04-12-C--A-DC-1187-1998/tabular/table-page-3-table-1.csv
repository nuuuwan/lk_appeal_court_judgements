"said  3rd  Defendant-Respondent  with 
regard 
to 
the 
said  plantation  and"
"building."
"It was in those circumstances, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent in her Statement"
"of Claim, stated that lot A in preliminary plan not from part of the corpus and"
"it  is  the  land  called  “Para  Rathmehera  Delgahakoratuwa”  alias  “Rathmehera"
"Delgahakoratuwa” belonging to the 3rd Defendant and also that the said land"
"is the subject matter of an another action bearing No. 10423/L pending in the"
"same District Court. Thereafter, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent had set out her"
"pedigree in respect of her alleged land. She in her statement of claim sought a"
"commission  to  be 
issued  on  to  G.H.P.A.A.  de  Silva  Licensed  Surveyor  to"
"prepare a plan  superimposing Plan 343 (prepared in Case No. 10423) on the"
"preliminary  plan

"commission issued in the case, said Licensed Surveyor prepared the Plan No."
"1028 dated 24.05.1988 and submitted same with the report."
"Thereafter,  the  case  was  fixed  for  trial  on  16  issues  raised  by  parties.  After"
"conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge on 16.10.1998 delivered the"
"judgment excluding Lot A in the preliminary plan from the corpus and made"
"order to partition the land restricting the corpus only to Lot B in preliminary"
"plan."
"Being aggrieved by the said judgment, this appeal preferred by the Appellant"
"to  set  aside  that  part  of  the  judgment  which  had  excluded  Lot  A  from  the"
"corpus  and  allow  the  appeal  to  include  Lot  A  in  preliminary  plan  in  to  the"
"corpus."
