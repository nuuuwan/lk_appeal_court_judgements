"The fact  that  the tenant was absent from the premises for  a short period does not mean"
"that the  Defendant terminated the tenancy.  He did  come  back and that shows that he"
"had the animus revertendi."
"Testifying on his behalf, the Defendant narrated as  to how he stayed in a detention camp"
"when there was communal violence in 1981.  This does not mean that the Defendant gave"
"up  possession  of  the  premises  and  handed  it  over  to  the  Plaintiff.  Leaving  tenanted"
"premises due to an exigency such as  a communal right cannot give rise  to termination of"
"tenancy.  The  learned  District Judge  of  Colombo  was  quite  right  in  deciding  that  the"
"tenancy continued and the Defendant never became a trespasser."
"In the circumstances I affirm the judgment dated 26.03.1999 and dismiss the appeal."
