"surveyed was what had been depicted in the schedule to the plaint. The importance of"
"proof of identity becomes more pronounced if a specific issue has been raised as regards"
"the identity of the corpus. If there is divergence  of descriptions between the deeds  and"
"the  preliminary plan  as  to  identity  of  the  corpus,  the  Plaintiff must  offer  evidence  to"
"explain  the  divergence  and  this  evidence  can  even  take  the  form  of  summoning  the"
"surveyor to give  evidence.  None  of the above has happened in the case-also see  Sopaya"
"Silva v.  Magilin Silva (1989) 2 Sri LR 105 at 108."
"If one peruses the evidence of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff too does not explain nor does he"
"utter anything about the boundaries. There is no independent evidence flowing from the"
"Plaintiff to establish the identity of the corpus."
