"","the  entry wound had  been 7 centimeters above the  right ear (page 462) and"
"","the exit wound had  been  12  centimeters above the  left ear on the top of the"
"","head 
(page  471).  Therefore, 
the  bullet  had  clearly 
travelled  upwards."
"","Therefore, 
the 
learned  Trial 
Judge  was  wrong  when 
she 
excluded"
"","possibility of suicide on the  basis that the  bullet had travelled parallel to  the"
"","floor.  The travel  line of the  bullet has to  be decided on the entry wound and"
"","the  exit wound.  The  entry  and  the  exit wounds  also  can  clearly  be  seen  in"
"","photographs marked and produced as 4VI2(1) and 4V12(2)."
"17.","The  learned  High  Court Judge  in  her Judgment at  page  1189  had  said  that"
"","the  deceased  was  a  housewife  who  had  no  weapon  training  and  therefore"
"","the  position  taken  by 
the  defence  that  she  had  previously  tried  to  shoot"
"","herself cannot  be  accepted.  In  his  statement  from  the  dock  the  Appellant"
"","had  said  that once  the  deceased  had  threatened  to  shoot  one  of his  drivers"
"","named  Galappaththi  aiming  the  pistol  to  his  head.  In  another  incident  the"
"","deceased  had 
threatened 
to 
shoot  herself  holding 
the  pistol 
after  an"
"","argument.  The  above-mentioned  Galappaththi  who  was 
the  army  driver"
"","attached  to  the  Appellant  also  gave  evidence  on  behalf of the  defence.  He"
"","testified  to  the fact that on  an  issue of the Appellant going to  Aruadhapura,"
"","the  deceased had  threatened  to  kill  him  with  the pistol  aiming the  pistol  at"
"","him.  That  had  been  about  5  months  before 
the 
incident 
in 
this  case."
