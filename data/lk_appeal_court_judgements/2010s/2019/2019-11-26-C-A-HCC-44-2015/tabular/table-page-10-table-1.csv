"","taking  the  deceased  to  hospital.  Contrary  to  his  evidence,  the  son  of the"
"","deceased  and  the  Appellant  Chathura  Dhananjaya  Rupasinghe  has  given"
"","evidence.  Although 
the 
above  witness  was 
the  PWI 
li sted 
in 
the"
"","indictment,  he  was  not  called  by  the  prosecution.  He  was  called  by  the"
"","defence.  He  said  that  the  Appellant  drove  the  vehicle  fast  to  the  hospital."
"","Although this  witness  was  cross examined  at  length  by  the  prosecution,  his"
"","evidence  was  not  challenged  on  this  point.  It  is  apparent  that  the  witness"
"","PW2  was  an 
interested  witness  who  was  bias 
towards 
the  prosecution."
"","PWI 
also 
said 
in 
evidence 
that 
there  had  been 
instances  where 
the"
"","deceased 
threatened 
to  commit  suicide  while  holding 
the  pistol.  The"
"","learned  Trial  Judge  has  failed 
to  consider  the  evidence  of the  son  PW1,"
"","when  she  came to  the  conclusion that the  Accused  was  not telling the  truth"
"","about 
the 
deceased 
trying 
to 
commit 
suicide 
before. 
She 
has 
only"
"","mentioned  about  the  dock  statement  on  that  issue,  but  not  considered  the"
"","evidence ofPW I  who was called by defence."
"19.","As submitted by the counsel for  the  Appellant and conceded by  the counsel"
"","for 
the  Respondent, 
investigating  officers  have 
failed 
to  check  for 
the"
"","fingerprints  on  the  pistol.  Prosecution  has  failed  even  to  produce  evidence"
"","on  whether  the  deceased  was  right-handed  or left-handed.  If she  was  left"
"","handed,  that evidence could have  excluded  suicide as  the  entry wound  was"
"","above the right ear ofthe deceased."
