"O
ut of these two sets of affidavits, the learned High Court Judge"
"has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  affidavits  tendered  by  the"
"Respondent  are  clearer 
than 
those  of 
the  Appellant  on 
the"
"question  of  possession 
in 
that 
the  Respondent’s  affidavits"
"explain how the land was possessed by the Respondent.  It is on"
"that  basis,  predominantly,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  held"
"with the Respondent."
"The  affidavits 
tendered  by  both  parties 
stating 
completely"
"contradictory positions vis-à-vis possession, in my view, are self-"
"serving  documents.    Almost  all  the  affidavits  tendered  by  the"
"Respondents (vide P6-P15) which the learned High Court Judge"
"heavily relied on to overturn the order of the Magistrate’s Court"
"have been prepared in the same style making slight changes in"
"the computer for the purpose of this case.   They cannot, in my"
"view, be taken seriously."
"Therefore 
it 
is 
prudent 
to 
place 
reliance 
on 
available"
"independent 
items  of  evidence 
to  come 
to  a  conclusion  on"
"possession."
"The  standpoint  taken  up  by  Ananda  Ganegoda  that  the  Deed"
"relied  on  by  the  Respondent  is  a  fraudulent  Deed  is  important."
"The  fact  that  he  got  possession  of  the  land  from  the  District"
"Court in 1994 is also very relevant.  V22 police complaint made"
"by  Ananda  Ganegoda 
on  13.05.2000 
also 
establishes  his"
"continuation  of  possession.    There  is  no  evidence  to  establish"
"that 
Ananda 
Ganegoda 
surrendered 
his 
possession 
to"
"Premachandra who is the predecessor in title of the Respondent."
"For the aforesaid reasons, it is my considered view that the order"
"of the learned Magistrate is correct."
