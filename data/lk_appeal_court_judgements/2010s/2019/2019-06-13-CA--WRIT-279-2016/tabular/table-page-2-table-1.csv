"The petitioners filed this application seeking to quash by way of"
"writ of certiorari the decisions marked P3(a), P4(a), P5, P6, P7(a),"
"P8(a),  P9,  P10,  P10(b)  and  P10(d)  of 
the  Acquiring  Officer"
"(Divisional Secretary-Maharagama) made after an inquiry under"
"section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act whereby it was decided not"
"to pay compensation to the petitioners for certain portions of the"
"land  acquired,  on  the  basis  that  those  portions  of  land  had"
"previously been acquired."
"Learned  State  Counsel  appearing  for  the  Acquiring  Officer  has"
"no  idea  when  the  alleged  previous  acquisition  has  taken  place,"
"but submits that it can even be before the Land Acquisition Act"
"became  law  and  probably  in  1920s.    I  doubt  about  the  said"
"assertion,  as  the  Tenement  List  marked  X1,  under  “Remarks”,"
"refers to “Taken over under section 38(A) of the Land Acquisition"
"Act”.    That  does  not  refer  to  the  present  acquisition,  but  the"
"previous one."
"Be that as it may, no Gazette has been produced by the State to"
"prove  such  Vesting  Order,  but  has 
the 
inter  alia  produced"
"Tenement  List  marked  X1,  which  is  based  on  the  Preliminary"
"Plan  Register  maintained  at 
the  Surveyor  General’s  Office"
"marked X2, together with an affidavit of the Surveyor General."
"If  the  land  has  already  been  acquired,  there  is  no  reason  to"
"acquire it again."
"In any event, the documents relied on by the State including the"
"ones  referred 
to  above,  at  best,  prove  acquisition,  but  not"
"payment of compensation for the acquired portions of land."
