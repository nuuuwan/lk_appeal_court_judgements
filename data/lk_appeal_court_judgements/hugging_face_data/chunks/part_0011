The learned High Court Judge was misdirected on the alibi\n\ntaken up by the fourth accused appellant.\n\niii. The judgment contains serious misdirections as to the facts and\n\nlaw.\n\nThe learned Counsel for the fifth accused appellant set out the following\n\ngrounds of appeal:\n\ni. Conviction which solely hinges on the evidence of the sole\n\neyewitness, namely Premadasa, is wholly unsafe.\n\nPage 7 of 12\n\nii. Following closely on ground 01, the learned trial Judge\u201fs\n\nassessment with regard to the credibility and the testimonial\n\ntrustworthiness of the said eyewitness is deficient and defective.\n\niii. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on a\n\ncritical issue of fact by asserting that the evidence of the sole\n\neyewitness has not been challenged, which factual finding is\n\ndemonstrably false, consequently being wholly prejudicial to the\n\nappellants.\n\niv. Although the conviction is based on the footing of unlawful\n\nassembly/common object and common intention, the judgment\n\nis depleted of the said legal principles as concepts which\n\nconsequently renders the judgment legally unattainable.\n\n12. While the appellant\u201fs Counsel have advanced distinct grounds of appeal,\n\nI will address them collectively as they arise similar issues.\n\n13. Courts have consistently affirmed that the prosecution alone carries the\n\nlegal burden of proving a criminal charge. Every element of the offence,\n\ni.e. conduct, mental state and attendant circumstances must be\n\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused need say nothing;\n\nthe presumption of innocence persists until it is overcome by cogent,"

Accordingly, if the evidence\n\nleaves the trier of fact with a reasonable doubt, the only permissible\n\nverdict is an acquittal.\n\n14. In the instant case, the prosecution seeks to prove its allegations\n\nprincipally through the evidence of PW01, the purported eye-witness.\n\nPage 8 of 12\n\n15. In this connection, the Court is mindful of the well-settled principle that\n\nno specific number of witnesses is required to prove any fact.\n\nAccordingly, the testimony of a single trustworthy witness can be\n\nsufficient to discharge the burden of proof.\n\n16. The learned Counsel for the appellants contends that PW01 is an\n\nunreliable witness to support such contention. They have invited the\n\nCourt\u201fs attention to several inconsistencies in his testimony and to the\n\nfact that he has given his statement to an investigating officer only after\n\nan inordinate delay. The learned Counsel also contended that the\n\nprosecution has offered no satisfactory explanation for this delay, a\n\ncircumstance that, in their view, fatally undermines PW01\u201fs credibility.\n\n17. PW01 has testified that when he was at home, the deceased came to his\n\nhouse.

However, in his statement to an\n\ninvestigating officer, he has also stated that the deceased was armed with\n\na bill hook knife, when the first accused named in the indictment got\n\nhold of the same and attacked the deceased with it.

According to the evidence of the investigating officer, the height of the\n\nembankment has been about five to six feet high.

Further, PW01 has also testified that the first accused named in the\n\ninvestigating officer, he has stated that it was the fourth accused\n\nappellant (Piyasena) who attacked the deceased first. The discrepancy\n\nhas been highlighted and marked as contradiction V3.\n\nPage 10 of 12\n\n25. The position taken up by PW01 has been that when the deceased was\n\nattacked, he ran away from the place he was hiding and on his return\n\nabout half an hour later, that he came to know from his wife\u201fs elder\n\nsister that the deceased had been killed.

The discrepancies mentioned earlier cannot be solely attributed to\n\nPW01\u201fs failure to accurately narrate the purported incident.

Also, PW01 has not made a statement to the investigators until seven\n\ndays after the incident. More importantly, the statement has not been\n\ngiven voluntarily. It has been obtained only after the investigators have\n\ntaken PW01 to the police station. PW01\u201fs attempts to justify the delay by\n\nciting his involvement in the deceased\u201fs funeral arrangements is\n\nunpersuasive since other witnesses some of whom were next of kin of the\n\ndeceased had furnished their statements on the very next day.\n\n29.

However, it is clear that\n\nthe learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the basic ingredients\n\nthat need to be established in order to prove the charge of unlawful\n\nassembly and committing an offence while being members of an unlawful\n\nassembly.

Lewis in Judicial Remedies & Public Law (4th ed.) says, at para. 9-17, that:\n\n\u2018The claimant should challenge the decision which brings about the legal situation of which complaint is made. There\n\nWRT/0051/24\n\nPage 9 of 13\n\nare occasions when a claimant does not challenge that decision but waits until some consequential or ancillary decision is taken and then challenges that later decision on the ground that the earlier decision is unlawful. If the substance of the dispute relates to the lawfulness of that earlier decision and if it is that earlier decision which is, in reality, determinative of the legal position, and the later decision does not, in fact, produce any change in the legal position, then the courts may rule that the time-limit runs from that earlier decision\u2019\u201d (at page 8) (emphasis added). \u201cI am of the view that where the impugned action takes place in stages, the challenge should be launched against the earliest stage rather than the final and decisive stage. See R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ex p. Greenpeace) [1998] COD 59 and R (Burkett) v Hammersmith & Fulham LWC [2002] 1 WLR 1593 (HL)\u201d (at pages 8-9).\n\n14. In determining issues of this nature, what is relevant and critical is the\n\nmaking of the operative order or determination; if a person aggrieved so\n\ndesires, such party should immediately take action to assail the same.\n\nIf such party allows time to lapse, and during such time certain other"

In this instance,\n\nthe decision in P-31 is not directly connected or referable to the issuing\n\nof a quit notice and filing for eviction in the Magistrate\u2019s Court.

However, the 5th\n\nRespondent produced several documents with his objections dated 9th March 2025 and the\n\nMedia Limited operate within the same corporate group. Document R6 corroborates that the 5th\n\nRespondent was transferred from one entity to another and it is significant R6 was signed by\n\nKeith Wilson on behalf of Reuters Limited while the affidavit marked A8 was sworn and given\n\nby the same person on behalf of Reuters News and Media Limited.\n\nIn view of this material, it is evident that the transfer of the 5th Respondent between two entities\n\nof the same group did not interrupt the continuity of his employment. A mere internal transfer\n\nwithin a corporate group cannot be relied upon to suggest that the employment relationship was\n\ndiscontinued.\n\nNext, I turn to the question of the nature of the relationship between the Petitioner and the 5th\n\nRespondent, namely whether it constituted a contract of employment or merely a contract for\n\nemployment.\n\n7\n\nIn determining whether an individual is a freelancer or an employee, the Court is required to\n\nexamine the substance of the relationship, not the labels used by the employer. It is abundantly\n\nclear that the Petitioner failed to submit any of the annual contracts signed by the parties to the\n\ninstant application whereas the 5th Respondent has produced the written contract marked R1\n\nalong with his objection.\n\nThe material before this Court demonstrate that the 5th Respondent had been working for the\n\nPetitioner under annually renewed agreements from 2005 until 2018. Such long term,\n\nuninterrupted service is inconsistent with freelance work which is ordinarily ad hoc, assignment\n\nbased and non-exclusive. A worker who remains attached to the same organization for more than\n\na decade, on annual renewals indicates the regular nature of the work of the 5th Respondent."

This decision reflects the\n\nbroader concern about the risk of such injustices recurring, and underscores society\u2019s\n\ndependence on the justice system to uphold a deterrent effect, preserving social order and\n\npreventing the escalation of crime.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, we find no justification to interfere with the sentence\n\nhanded down by the Learned High Court Judge on 02.05.2024.\n\nThe Sentence is backdated to the date of conviction, namely 02.05.2024. Furthermore, we\n\nmake no change in the fine and the compensation imposed on the Appellant.\n\nThe Registrar of this court is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of\n\nBalapitiya for compliance.\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

Such other and further reliefs as Your Lordships\u2019 Court shall seem fit\n\nand meet.\n\n2] Brief history of this application is as follows: the case began in the Magistrate's\n\nbreach of peace regarding a family burial ground. The officer in charge of\n\nGalewela Police Station had filed a report under section 66 of the Primary Court\n\nProcedure Act. The 1st Party (Petitioner) claimed the land, called\n\n\"Deganthuduwa,\" was a Paraveni Property given to her father and used as a\n\nfamily burial ground for over 75 years, alleging that the 2nd Party\n\n(Ethabendiwewa Upali Himi) unlawfully entered and filled the graves. The 2nd\n\nParty disputed this, claiming the land was not a family burial ground and the\n\n1st Party lacked title. It is seen in the said action that there were two intervenient\n\nparties, namely Adhikari Gedara Thilakaratne and Adhikarigedara Punchim\n\nMenika. However, by order dated 26/01/2016, said case bearing No. 68943(66)\n\nof Dambulla District/Magistrate\u2019s Court, the learned Primary Court Judge held\n\nthat possession was to be given to the 1st Party, the Petitioner.\n\n3] The controversy escalated when the Divisional Secretary of Galewela\n\n(Appellant/Petitioner) filed an action seeking recovery of possession under the\n\nState Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act of the said land, case bearing No. 80992\n\nof Dambulla District/Magistrate\u2019s Court, the basis of this application.\n\n4] The Respondent (the original 1st Party), now the Petitioner in this application,\n\nobjected, asserting the land was a Paraveni Property and provided documents,\n\n5\n\n\u0dc0\u0dcf1 to \u0dc0\u0dcf 7. After inquiry, the learned Magistrate, by order dated 21/03/2018,\n\nissued an order of ejectment, which was upheld by the Provincial High Court.\n\n5] The Petitioner now seeks a Revision/Restitutio in Integrum, arguing the courts\n\nacted on documents with \"no legal value,\" failed to properly address the land"

It is seen though; the Petitioner had filed revision\n\napplication with regard to the order of 66 Application order, the Petitioner has\n\nnot filed any application before High Court, regarding recovery of the State Land\n\nRecovery of Possession Act. She has clear statutory rights against the\n\nMagistrate\u2019s impugned order which was delivered under the State Land Recovery\n\nof Possession Act. Thus, it is clear that despite the alternative remedy, the\n\nPetitioner had filed this application to this court. In Wijersiri Gunawardane &\n\nOthers v. Chandrasena Muthukumarana & Others, SC Appeal No. 111/2015\n\ndecided on 27.05.2020, his Lordship Aluwihare PC.

In Perera v. Wijewickreme, 15 NLR 411. His Lordship Pereira J. held:\n\n\u201cIt was not granted unless no other remedy was available to the applicant\n\nor unless restitution was the more effectual remedy\u201d\n\n9] In the same case, His Lordship Ennis J. held that;\n\n\u201cThis is an application for restitutio in integrum.

Thereby, it was\n\ncontended that a conviction for murder is not safe based on his testimony.\n\nThe importance of an omission in criminal trials has been discussed in\n\nseveral judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our country. It is\n\npertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned omissions have any\n\nadverse effect on the evidence given by PW01 in this case.\n\nIn the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa\n\n(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,\n\n\u201cWhilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect\n\nthe trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that\n\nthe Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency\n\nor contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.\n\nDiscrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the\n\nbasic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance.\n\nWitnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies\n\nand omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should\n\ndirect his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness\n\nshould be given an opportunity of explaining the matter.\u201d\n\nCA/HCC/0139-142/2020\n\n10 | P a g e\n\nThe incident happened on 06/03/1998 and PW01 had given evidence before\n\nthe High Court on 06/02/2017 after about 19 years of the incident.\n\nConsidering the contradictions, omissions and the passage of time after the\n\nincident, a reasonable court cannot expect hundred percent accurate\n\nevidence from a witness.

Accordingly, the sole question for\n\ndetermination in this appeal is whether the sentence imposed on the appellant by the\n\n9. The counsel submitted that the sentence is excessive given the minimum mandatory\n\nsentence is 10 years. In the case before the High Court, it was submitted that the\n\nAppellant is 36 years old, married, and has one child who studies at grade 6; and the\n\nAppellant is the sole breadwinner upon whom the entire family is financially\n\ndependent. Additionally, Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant\n\nrepents on what he had done and therefore, expects clemency form the court.\n\nCA/HCC/0027/2024\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n10. Accordingly, the principal ground urged by the defense in mitigation is the hardship\n\nlikely to befall the Appellant\u2019s family consequent to his incarceration.\n\n11. There are instances where courts exercise leniency in sentencing an accused despite\n\nthe nature of the offence, particularly where mitigating circumstances are present. To\n\nelaborate further, a lesser sentence may be imposed only if the Court is satisfied that\n\n\u201csubstantial and compelling circumstances\u201d exist which would justify such a\n\ndeparture. However, courts must also remain mindful of the message conveyed to\n\nsociety, especially the principle that offences of a heinous nature will not be tolerated\n\nor treated lightly.\n\n12. In deciding whether the mitigatory grounds advanced by the Appellant warrant a\n\nreduction of sentence, this Court must not lose sight of the aggravating circumstances\n\nsurrounding the case, nor of the legislative intent in prescribing severe custodial\n\nsentences for sexual offences.\n\n13. Sri Lankan Courts, in a long line of judicial authorities have held that cases involving\n\nsexual offences, especially where the victims are children, have to be severely dealt\n\nwith so as to create deterrence on the society."

In the case of, Keith Billam (1986) Vol 82 Criminal Appeal Reports 347, the Lord\n\nChief Justice reiterated the foregoing observations and stated that in a contested case\n\nof rape a figure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting point of the\n\nsentence, subject to any aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as\n\nfollows:\n\n\" The crime should in any event be treated as aggravated by any of the\n\nfollowing factors : (1) violence is used over and above the force necessary, to\n\ncommit the rape ; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the victim ; (3)\n\nthe rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been carefully planned : (5) the\n\ndefendant has a previous convictions for rape or other serious offences of a\n\nviolent or sexual kind ; (6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities\n\nor perversions ; (7) the victim is either very old or very young ; (8) the effect\n\nupon the victim, whether physical or mental, is of special seriousness. Where\n\nany one or more of these aggravating features are present, the sentence\n\nshould be substantially higher than the figure suggested as the starting point\n\n\".\n\n25. It can be observed that several of these aggravating circumstances are present in the\n\ncase in hand. The appellant\u2019s request for a glass of water, by which he deceptively\n\ncreated an opportunity to forcibly remove the prosecutrix to a room; the fact that her\n\ngrandmother was asleep after taking medication; the appellant\u2019s prior confirmation\n\nthat the parents were absent from the house; the tender age of the victim, who was\n\nbelow the legal age of consent; the evident degree of pre-planning by the appellant;"

According to PW1, the team left on routine patrol at 9.00 a.m. The arrest in the\n\nKeselwatta area was made at 13.00 hours, and the appellant was subsequently arrested\n\nat 20.00 hours.

In a raid of this nature, it is of paramount importance to maintain notes pertaining to\n\nthe important events which led to the arrest. In the present case, there is a significant\n\ntime gap between the first arrest and the arrest of the appellant. The prosecution\n\nversion is that they were patrolling the area and had communication with their\n\ninformants. In the absence of the odometer reading of the vehicle in which they\n\ntravelled and accurate notes it is difficult to ascertain the truth of the prosecution\n\nversion.\n\n13.

It is also noteworthy that there exists a significant omission in the chain of custody of\n\nthe productions. According to the prosecution, the productions were handed over to\n\nthe Magistrate\u2019s Court by PC 55637 Balasuriya and were accepted by a production\n\nclerk named T. L. Kosala. However, Kosala did not testify at the trial. Instead, another\n\nproduction clerk, Konagama (PW15), gave evidence by referring to the production\n\nregister maintained during the relevant period.

The observations made by the learned trial Judge\n\nat page 40 of the impugned judgment indicate that he had pre-judged the case even\n\nbefore analysing the defence evidence. It can also be observed that the testimony of\n\nthe defence witnesses, although subjected to cross-examination, does not reveal any\n\nsignificant inter-se contradictions. While it is true that they are family members of the\n\nappellant, that fact alone should not serve as a ground to reject their testimony unless\n\nthere exist inherent improbabilities on the face of their evidence.\n\n23. The appellant\u2019s dock statement was corroborated by the defence witnesses. During\n\ncross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, it was put to them that the appellant\n\nhad been arrested at his residence and not at Kadireshan Street as alleged by the\n\nCA/HCC/0214/2019\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nprosecution. In the circumstances, the infirmities in the prosecution evidence, when\n\nconsidered alongside the defence version, undoubtedly cast a reasonable doubt on the\n\nprosecution case. Accordingly, such doubt must be resolved in favour of the appellant.\n\n24. Considering the totality of the evidence, the defence version gains credibility, and at\n\nthe very least, a complete rejection of the defence evidence would not be justified.\n\nThis is a situation where the defence has successfully created a reasonable doubt in\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s version.

Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the learned High Court Judge himself\n\nreached the conclusion that the dock statement and the evidence of the defence\n\nwitnesses were deliberately designed by the appellant to create doubt with regard to\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s case, and hence, the defence version could not be accepted.\n\n26. During the trial, both PW1 and PW6 stated that, while on patrol, they arrested a\n\nsuspect with narcotics and handed him over to the Keselwatta Police. However, both\n\nwitnesses failed to corroborate that assertion, as no notes or records were made in that\n\nregard. The defence, in cross-examination, emphasized this omission, as it clearly\n\ncalls into question the credibility of the testimonies of PW1 and PW6.\n\n27. Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge disregarded this point and concluded that\n\nit had no relevance to the present case, further suggesting that the burden lay upon the\n\ndefence to prove the contrary if the arrest was disputed. In my respectful view, this\n\napproach is erroneous in law. When the prosecution asserts a fact but fails to establish\n\nit through credible evidence, the defence cannot be burdened with proving a negative.\n\nThe obligation lies upon the prosecution to prove what they allege, and not upon the\n\naccused to disprove what has not been sufficiently established.\n\n28. For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to\n\nestablish the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

Furthermore,\n\nthe defence highlighted as an omission the allegation that the Appellant had shown\n\npornographic material to the victim, which the victim had also failed to disclose to his\n\nmother, PW 2. It is therefore evident that there are material discrepancies between the\n\nevidence of PW 1, PW 2, and PW 7.\n\nOur courts have consistently held that where such discrepancies go to the root of the\n\nmatter and undermine the basic version of the victim, the court must attach due weight\n\nto those discrepancies.\n\nWhat is a discrepancy was described in The Law of Evidence by Sir John Woodroffe and\n\nSyed Amir Ali (18th edition, Volume I, page 411),\n\n\u201c(5) DISCREPANCIES\n\nPage 11 of 13\n\nThe constant theme on the appreciation of evidence in our courts is the\n\ndiscrepancies in the testimony of various witnesses.

There can be discrepancies of truth as\n\nwell as discrepancies of falsehood. It is common experience that discrepancies do\n\noccur, even in the statements of perfectly honest witnesses; they are really due to\n\ndifferences in individual faculties with regard to observation, recollection and\n\nrecital of details; and unless there is any good ground to think that they are due to\n\na deliberate attempt to suppress or depart from the truth, it is unfair to discard\n\nthe direct testimony of witnesses, merely on account of such discrepancies, when\n\nthere is a general agreement as to material circumstances.

    "chunk_text": "On 11.08.2017, PW 9, SIP Mahesh Raveendra Kumara, arrested the 1st Appellant.\n\nFrom his statement, an iron rod was recovered from behind the Appellant\u2019s\n\nresidence. However, during the trial, PW 1 and PW 2 failed to identify the said\n\nproduction.\n\nPage 7 of 16\n\nAppellant gave evidence from the witness box. According to the 2nd Appellant, on\n\nthe previous day, they had met the deceased, who had asked them to come the\n\nfollowing day to discuss the transaction. According to the Appellant, when they\n\narrived at the house, PW 1 opened the gate. (It is noted that this was not advanced\n\nby the defence during the cross-examination of PW 1.) PW 1 then went inside and\n\nwoke up the deceased, who came out and took hold of an iron rod that was near\n\nthe wall and began to strike the appellant. The 1st Appellant seized the iron rod\n\nfrom the deceased and struck him in return. At that time, PW 1 brought chilli-\n\nmixed water and threw it at the appellants. PW 1 thereafter took a long knife from\n\nunder a chair and handed it to the deceased. (During the cross-examination of PW\n\n1, this was not proposed to her.)\n\nThe 2nd Appellant stated that he pulled the knife from the deceased. This version\n\nwas not challenged during the cross-examination of PW 1. He further claimed that\n\nafter the deceased attacked the appellants with chilli powder, the 2nd Appellant\n\nheld the 1st Appellant and moved outside. The deceased then returned, took the\n\niron rod from the 1st Appellant, and subsequently fell down. At that point, the 2nd\n\nAppellant, in order to safeguard his brother, struck the deceased once with the\n\nknife.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge rejected the appellants\u2019 defense of a sudden fight\n\nand ruled that the appellants are guilty of murdering Samantha Kumara.\n\nThe main arguments advanced by the Appellants are as follows:\n\n1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account the\n\ndiscrepancies in the eyewitness testimony.\n\n2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to properly consider the\n\noccurrence of a sudden fight."

The Learned High Court Judge failed to properly consider the\n\noccurrence of a sudden fight.\n\nInconsistency in the witness\u2019s testimony\n\nIn evaluating the evidence of both witnesses, it is observed that PW 1 and PW 2\n\nwere eyewitnesses to the incident, though they were not present simultaneously.\n\nIt is further noted that PW 2 was only 12 years old at the time, whereas PW 1,\n\nbeing the wife of the deceased, was the only elder there. Both witnesses\n\nconsistently testified that the 1st Appellant attacked the deceased with an iron\n\npipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna knife. The 1st and 2nd\n\nAppellants did not deny this fact. Their defence was that the deceased attempted\n\nto attack them and threw chilli water, and that they acted in private-defence.\n\nWhen we examine the testimonies of PW01 and PW02, certain discrepancies\n\nbecome apparent. PW01 did not mention that the deceased was holding a pole,\n\nwhereas PW02 stated that his father was carrying a wooden pole. Another\n\ninconsistency arises regarding the use of chilli powder water: PW01 claimed that\n\nshe alone threw it, while PW02 asserted that the deceased was the one throwing\n\nchilli water.\n\nThe critical issue, therefore, is whether these discrepancies undermine the\n\ncredibility of these witnesses. The following judgments are relevant to answer the\n\nabove question.\n\nSunil v. Attorney-General, 1999 (3) SLR 191 at page 194, Jayasuriya, J held that:\n\n\u201cIn Jagathsena v.

    "chunk_text": "extends under Section 100 to causing death if there is reasonable\n\napprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the\n\nassault. The oft quoted observation of this Court in Salim Zia v. State of\n\n\"It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self-\n\ndefence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that,\n\nwhile the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,\n\nthe accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his\n\nonus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying\n\nbasis for that plea in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses or\n\nby adducing defence evidence....\"\n\nThe accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. It is enough for him to show as in a civil case that\n\nthe preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea.\u201d\n\nThe Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows,\n\n\u2018when a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the\n\nexistence of circumstances bringing the case within any of general\n\nexceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso\n\ncontained in any part of the same Code, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. is upon him, and the\n\ncourt shall presume absence of such circumstances\u201d (Emphasis added)\n\nIs there any evidence before the trial judge that supports the private defence?\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Learned High Court Judge correctly found that both\n\nAppellants, armed with weapons, entered the house and attacked its windows. No\n\nevidence was adduced of any injuries sustained by the Appellants, whereas the\n\ndoctor recorded multiple injuries on the deceased. It was further established that,\n\nPage 14 of 16\n\nimmediately following the incident, the Appellants threatened the witnesses. In\n\nthese circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge rightly considered and\n\nrejected the plea of private defence."

When the police, PW 10, inspected the scene, they\n\nobserved damage caused to the house. It is further noted that the deceased\n\nsustained multiple injuries inflicted by the Appellants, whereas no injuries were\n\nfound on either Appellant.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded that there is no evidence to\n\nestablish that the injuries sustained by the deceased were inflicted in the exercise\n\nof private defence. We are further of the view that there is no material to\n\ndemonstrate any necessity for the Appellants to cause such injuries to the\n\ndeceased.\n\nWe note that the Appellants arrived armed and entered the house. Furthermore,\n\nboth PW 1 and PW 2 consistently testified that the 1st Appellant assaulted the\n\ndeceased with an iron pipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna\n\nknife. It is also established, based on the testimony of PW 1 and PW 2, that the\n\nAppellants threatened the family members of the deceased before they are leaving\n\nthe house. Upon evaluating the evidence, we hold that the Appellants entered the\n\npremises with a common intention.\n\nUpon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution established the case,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the Appellants committed the murder of\n\nSamantha Kumara.\n\nPage 16 of 16\n\nIn those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the disputed judgment\n\ntogether with the sentencing order.\n\nThe Appeal is dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

According to PW2,\n\n\u2018Chandran Thambi\u2019 is the 3rd Appellant in this case. Considering the evidence\n\ngiven by PW7, the investigation officer, the learned High Court had\n\ndisregarded PW2\u2019s evidence at pages 504-505 of his judgment. As the learned\n\nHigh Court Judge mainly relied on the evidence given by PW1, the eye\n\nwitness, I am of the view that not considering the dying declaration of the\n\ndeceased had not caused any prejudice to the Appellants.\n\nAs per the 4th ground of appeal, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the\n\n2nd,3rd and 4th Appellants contended that the learned High Court Judge had\n\nwrongly rejected the alibi of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Appellants.\n\nIt is trite law that no burden is cast upon the accused to prove his alibi, as\n\nthe alibi is not a defence.

The Respondents have drawn the attention of Court to clause 22 of the Sale Agreement No. 536 dated 24.11.1999, which provides as follows;\n\nIt is of the utmost significance that the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari is a decision founded purely on contract. The act or decision complained of arose from an alleged breach of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is the \"Competent Authority\"' appointed by statute cannot alter the intrinsic character of the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari. The decision is one taken wholly within the context of the contractual relationship and not in the exercise of the powers of a public authority as such. It invoked no administrative powers or authority. It is a decision made in the exercise of a power which springs from contract. In my view, it is a decision clearly\n\n27 Vide paragraphs 15-22 of the Written Submissions of the Respondents. 28 [1985] 2 Sri L.R. 413. The other decision cited by the Respondents in their Written Submissions, Samaraweera v.

I am of the view that the Respondents have successfully made out a case within the aforementioned parameters to establish that the grant of a writ of Mandamus would be futile in the instant application.\n\n34 [1985] 1 Sri L.R. 146 at 151. 35 [2007] 2 Sri L.R. 281. 36 39 NLR 186LR 186 at 191.\n\n20\n\n37 Vide paragraphs 6.1-6.3 of the Written Submissions of the Petitioners. 38 CA (Writ) Application No. 243/2017, decided on 07.11.2017. 39 CA (Writ) Application No. 132/2018, decided on 03.06.2021. 40 CA (Writ) Application No. 21/2022, decided on 13.02.2023. 41 C.A.

They are they expected to maintain the highest professional standards in the regulation and management of their respective sectors, to hold the scales even in the resolution of disputes and, perhaps most importantly, to safeguard the rights and interests of the vulnerable segments within their purview. As custodians of powers vested for the public benefit, such authorities may be reasonably expected to act with the highest degree of responsiveness, diligence, efficiency, transparency and accountability in the discharge of their mandate. I hope the Condominium Management Authority will take heed of such matters in their future conduct.\n\nApplication is dismissed.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal Mayadunne Corea, J.\n\nI agree.

Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a\n\nconviction at any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is\n\nmeted out. A Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either\n\nfrom the court or from the Accused. If the investigation has revealed\n\nmatters which are favourable to the Accused and the Accused is unaware\n\nof the existence of such facts, it is the bounden duty of the Prosecutor to\n\nmake those facts available to the court and to the defence.

    "chunk_text": "The Supreme Court in The Queen v Liyanage and Others (1963) 65 NLR\n\n337, stated that:\n\n\u201c\u2026 on a trial upon Indictment, by the very essence of the pre-trial\n\nprocedure, an accused person becomes aware of all the evidence relied\n\nintends to place against him at the trial. He is entitled in law to know such\n\nevidence before he is called upon to plead to the Indictment. It is a right of\n\nhis, inherent in that procedure.\u201d\n\nA fair trial would refer to the legal procedure which has been set in place to\n\nguarantee the fair and just treatment of individuals accused of crimes, which\n\nincludes rights such as public hearings by an independent and impartial\n\ncourt within a reasonable time period. Other key rights include the\n\npresumption of innocence until proven guilty, the right to legal\n\nrepresentation, the ability to present one\u2019s case and the right to question and\n\ncross examine evidence against them. Such a legal guarantee is an\n\ninternationally recognised human right which is absolutely necessary to\n\nensure democracy and a just legal system.\n\nAccordingly, in my view, the failure to provide the copy of the second\n\nstatement to both the defence and the court has resulted in a great prejudice\n\nagainst the Appellant. Further, such a critical point not being noticed by the\n\nLearned High Court Judge has resulted in it being even more unjust to the\n\nAppellant.\n\nSecondly, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant, submitting certified copies\n\nof the case record bearing number HCR/38/2017 of the High Court of\n\nCA/HCC/175/23\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nRatnapura, contended that the Appellant had already been indicted and\n\nconvicted by the Learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura upon his guilty\n\nplea regarding the same incident.\n\nIn HCR/38/2017, the Appellant was charged for committing rape on the\n\nvictim Punniyadevan Parwathie, under section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code\n\nbetween 23.11.2012 and 06.06.2013.\n\nOn the 09.02.2022, upon indicating that the Appellant was willing to plead"

The\n\nprosecution had used the same Medico Legal Report of the victim which had\n\nbeen filed in HCR/39/2017 to re-consider the charge.\n\nThe Appellant pleaded guilty to the amended indictment 29.03.2022 and was\n\nsentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment suspended for five years with\n\na fine of Rs.5000/- subject to default sentence of 03 months simple\n\nimprisonment.

The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the dying\n\ndeclaration in its correct perspective.\n\niii. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the\n\ndefence\u2019s case.\n\n11. The legal principles of dying declarations have originated in English\n\ncommon law based on the maxim \u201cnemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri\u201d\n\n(a man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth) and is applied\n\ntoday as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, though with specific\n\nconditions in different legal systems.\n\n12.

The rational for admitting\n\nthis type of evidence (despite it being hearsay and not subject to cross\n\nexamination) is necessity. Often, the victim is the only eye-witness to the\n\ncrime and excluding his or her declaration might allow a perpetrator to\n\nescape justice.\n\nPage 6 of 13\n\n13.

It has been established that the deceased possessed literacy and suffered\n\nfrom no known speech impediment. The appellant has identified a\n\nKalum, it\u2019s the son of the deceased and they have resided together in the\n\nsame household.\n\nPage 9 of 13\n\nFurther, the postmortem examination\u2019s findings are critical. The nature\n\nof the deceased\u2019s injuries precluded neither an instantaneous loss of\n\nconsciousness nor immediate impairment of her speech capabilities. The\n\nattending medical officer has concluded that the deceased would have\n\nretained the ability to speak at the time she was confronted by PW01.\n\nFurthermore, the deceased\u2019s capacity to identify her assailant is not in\n\ndispute, owing to her intimate familiarity with the appellant. This context\n\nrenders it exceptionally improbable that a mother would, in her final\n\nmoments, deliberately make a false declaration implicating her own son.\n\nUnder those circumstances, the relevant contention of the Counsel for\n\nthe appellant must fail.\n\n22. PW08, Dr. De Silva, has testified that the corresponding internal injury,\n\nspecifically bleeding on the right side of the brain, was, in the ordinary\n\ncourse of nature sufficient to cause the death of the deceased.\n\nFurthermore, in King vs. Thajudeen, 6 NLR 16 at page 19, Bonser, J, has\n\nheld that, \u201cwhen people cause injuries to another man their intent must\n\nbe judged by the result of their action\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut it was urged that they did not intend to break the\n\nman\u2019s rib and therefore they could not be convicted of\n\ngrievous hurt.

In light of medical evidence and legal precedent, it can be inferred that\n\nthe appellant intended to inflict the injury upon the deceased which was,\n\nin the ordinary course of nature, sufficient to cause her death.\n\n24. While the learned High Court Judge has not explicitly stated this\n\nconclusion in so many words, he has thoroughly referred to the injuries\n\ninflicted on the deceased.

The learned Counsel for the appellant has also submitted that the\n\nlearned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the facts,\n\nspecifically in concluding that the appellant attempted to flee upon being\n\naccosted by PW03, after the deceased was hospitalized. It has been\n\ncontended that the testimony merely demonstrates that the appellant\n\nturned away, rather than evidencing an attempt to flee.\n\n26.

Rather the learned\n\nHigh Court Judge has assessed the totality of the evidence on record and\n\nfound the deceased\u2019s declaration to PW01 was consistent with other\n\nindependent circumstances.
