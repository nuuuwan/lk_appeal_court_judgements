public authority acted ultra vires. Professor Wade views that \u201cin public law the most obvious limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is that it cannot be invoked so as to give an authority powers which it does not in law possess. In other words, no estoppel can legitimate action which is ultra vires\u201d [H.W.R. Wade and C.F.F. Forsyth in \u2018Administrative Law - eleventh edition @ page 197 ]. In the case in hand, the Court has come to a conclusion that since the revesting Order published in the Gazette marked A4 is ultra vires and bad in law, the defence taken up by the Respondents in relation to estoppel cannot stand.\n\nNevertheless, delay alone shall not prevent a person from receiving the relief to which they may be entitled. It has to be decided upon the facts of\n\nPage 12 of 15\n\neach particular case. The Petitioner submits that delay would not defeat the application of the Petitioner as the purported re-vesting Order is ultra vires. In Biso Menika v Cyril de Alwis and others [1982] 1 SLR 368, it was held that,\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied that the Order complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction, the Court would be loath to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such event, the explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically\u2026\u201d"

Following are the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant.\n\na. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider probability\n\nand also failed to evaluate the testimony of PW2;\n\nb. Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance was not considered;\n\nc. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate medical evidence; and\n\nd. The procedure adopted by the High Court Judge and prosecutor to remove\n\nevidence of PW9, a lay witness, from the proceedings is wrong in law.\n\nCA/HCC/0059/2023\n\n3 | P a g e\n\nBackground to the appeal:\n\n4. The prosecution story was that PW1 the victim when going home riding his bicycle\n\nwas halted by the appellant and pulled the victim to the side of the road and removed\n\nhis trouser and inserted the appellant\u2019s penis twice into his anus.\n\n5. I will first consider whether the learned trial Judge had failed to evaluate the\n\ntestimony of PW1 in particular the probability of his story. According to PW1, when\n\nhe was riding a bicycle, the appellant blocked him and made him to fall. Thereafter,\n\nthe appellant removed the victim\u2019s trouser and inserted his penis to the victim\u2019s\n\nrectum. At that time a person called Priyankara PW9 came and questioned the\n\nappellant. Thereafter, the victim went home crying and informed the incident to his\n\nmother PW1.\n\n6. According to the victim, the alleged offence was committed at the side of the road and\n\nit was a sandy place. The victim was laying on his stomach when the alleged offence\n\nwas being committed by the appellant. \u200d\n\n7. The offences of this nature are normally committed in discreet places where no eye\n\nwitnesses are found. Therefore, court has to rely on the evidence of the victim and if\n\navailable on medical evidence. Very rarely, an eye witness could be found in this kind\n\nof offences."

According to the Medico Legal Report (MLR) the victim was\n\nexamined by PW6 on 23.01.2010 at 10.50 am. The alleged offence was committed on\n\n22.01.2010.\n\n11.

It is\n\nsignificant to note that PW6 when stated his opinion on the MLR did not even\n\ndescribe it as anal penetration but recent penetration."

It is also important to note that PW2 when testifying clearly stated that he was placed\n\non his stomach when the appellant was allegedly committing the offence of grave\n\nsexual abuse. According to MLR, the victim was examined by PW6 on the following\n\nday. In his evidence, the victim stated that he was fallen when the bicycle was stopped\n\nby the appellant. Furthermore, he stated that his hands were held behind his back by\n\nthe appellant and that he was forced to lie on the road while being sexually abused by\n\nhim.

The Court cannot lightly disregard the non-production of such a\n\ncrucial witness, particularly when his testimony would have provided direct evidence\n\nof the alleged incident. In this regard, the following authorities would be of much\n\nrelevance.\n\n19. In Walimunige John v.

But\n\nwhere one witness's evidence is cumulative of the other and would be a mere\n\nrepetition of the narrative, it would be wrong to direct a jury that the failure to\n\ncall such witness gives rise to a presumption under section 114 (f) of the\n\nEvidence Ordinance.\"\n\n20.

In R vs. Stephen Seneviratne 38 NLR 208, the Privy Council held that the\n\nprosecution must call witnesses whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the\n\nnarrative of the case. It was further held inter alia that: The prosecution is not bound\n\nto call witnesses irrespective of considerations of number and of reliability.

In the present case, there was no justifiable reason for the prosecution to refrain from\n\ncalling PW9, who, according to the testimony of PW2, was an eyewitness to the\n\nincident. Furthermore, a careful examination of the High Court proceedings reveals\n\nthat the learned Judge had permitted the expunging of PW9\u2019s evidence after the same\n\nhad been recorded. In my view, this action has gravely impaired the appellant\u2019s right\n\nto a fair trial.\n\n23. What then was the nature of PW9\u2019s evidence? Why was it expunged? Was it because\n\nsuch evidence was unfavorable to the prosecution\u2019s case? No satisfactory explanation\n\nemerges from the record, nor is any reasonable justification discernible.\n\n24. Moreover, the location where the alleged incident took place further casts doubt on\n\nthe prosecution story. According to PW1, the offence was committed by the appellant\n\non a roadside, which is not a secluded place, and PW3 also purportedly witnessed it.\n\nCA/HCC/0059/2023\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nWhen the medical evidence fails to support the prosecution\u2019s version, the probability\n\nof the prosecution story is further called into question."

Thereafter, PW 1, PW 11 and the informant got down from\n\nthe vehicle and walked up to the gate of the David Pieris Company.\n\n8. Two officers, namely PC Jayasinghe PW 5 and PC Wakishta PW 4, came on a\n\nmotorcycle and were positioned in front of Dambulu furniture, which was situated\n\nright opposite the David Pieris Company. PC Susantha and WPC Chandani who\n\ntraveled in the other motor bike were waiting at the beginning of the road running\n\ntowards Khettarama Cricket stadium.\n\n9. In the meantime, the informant noticed a three-wheeler about 20 m away and\n\nidentified it by the registration number and after informing the officers that it was the\n\nAppellant who had come in the three-wheeler, entered the David Pieris Company\n\npremises.\n\n10. The three-wheeler arrived and stopped directly in front of PW 1 and PW 11. The\n\nperson who came in the three-wheeler got out from the vehicle with a parcel and\n\nwalked about 2-5 m forward when PW 1 and PW 11 arrested him. Subsequently, the\n\nsaid parcel was examined by PW 1 and PW 11 and was found to be heroin.\n\nThereafter, the Accused was handcuffed and was taken to his house at Wellampitiya\n\naround 11.05 a.m. and his house was also searched by the officers of the Police\n\nNarcotic Bureau for around 45 minutes.\n\n11.

On behalf of the prosecution PW 1, PW 11 testified. Thereafter, since it was\n\ninformed by the counsel that the Appellant could not be present in court due to death\n\nthreats, steps were taken under section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act\n\nand thereafter conducted the trial in absentia.

According to PW 1 the raid was conducted on information received by him from one\n\nof his private informants. Needless to say, that even being a police informant is a very\n\nrisky job, in particular when the information is linked to drug trafficking. Moreover it\n\nis a life and death situation given the extensively spread drug network operating\n\nwithin the country. Therefore, Police always takes every endeavor to conceal the\n\nidentity of the informant as far as they can.\n\n15. As can be observed from the testimony of PW 1, he along with PW 2 and the\n\ninformant got down from the vehicle and walked along the road about 15 m and were\n\nstanding near the entrance of the David Pieris Company.

According to the information received by PW 1 he knew the registration\n\nnumber of the three-wheeler in which the Appellant was supposed to bring heroin.\n\nPrior to the raid PW 1 knew the registration number of the three-wheeler as WPQI\n\n6363. If that was the case, what was the necessity to have the informant in their\n\ncompany until the three-wheeler was seen by them? It would definitely give anybody\n\na chance to identify the informant which would put him at a grave risk. Had they\n\nknown the registration number of the three-wheeler as per the information they\n\nreceived, they could have easily stopped the three-wheeler without the informant\n\nbeing present.\n\n16. Hence, the fact that the informant walked along the road with PW 1 and waited at the\n\nentrance of the David Pieris Company until the Appellant reached there is difficult to\n\nbelieve.\n\nCA/HCC/0157/2023\n\n5 | P a g e\n\n17. It is also significant to note that according to the notes entered by PW 1 regarding the\n\ninformation, it was revealed that a person was coming near David Pieris Company to\n\ndistribute heroin.

Thus, a person of PW 1\u2019s caliber should have reasonably anticipated that someone\n\nwho was supposed to take the parcel form the Appellant would have been roaming in\n\nthe vicinity. If that was the case, allowing the informant to be there with PW 1 and\n\nPW 11 until the Appellant came by three-wheeler would certainly enable any\n\ninterested party to know who the informant is. This again questioned the credibility of\n\nthe PW 1\u2019s evidence."

Justice Shirani Tilakawardane, J. in the case of AG v. Mahadurage Dimson and 3\n\nOthers, CA 141/A-B-2000, decided on 24.11.2003, Her Ladyship held that;\n\n(1) \u201cThe Courts must, while evaluating evidence, bear in mind that in a case\n\nof rape especially a girl of tender age would not come before a Court\n\nmerely to make a humiliating statement against her honour. Therefore,\n\ncontradictions which have no material effect on the veracity of the\n\nprosecutrix case should not be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable\n\nprosecutrix case.\u201d\n\n10. As can be seen from the evidence, the defence marked three contradictions, D1 to D3,\n\nwhen cross-examining PW1, the victim. It must be noted that D1 is not a contradiction but\n\nmerely an omission, which does not affect the credibility of the victim. This omission\n\nconcerns whether the victim had stated to the police that PW3 had assaulted the appellant\n\nwith a pipe.\n\n11. Similarly, the contradictions marked as D2 and D3 are not related to any critical issue of\n\nthe case that could cast doubt on the credibility of PW1. The contradictions marked as D4\n\nand D5 through PW3 are also not connected to any matter that goes to the root of the case.\n\nTherefore, in my view, these contradictions, whether appreciated by the learned trial Judge\n\nor not, would have no impact on the judgment.\n\n12. In a case of this nature, given the age of the victim and the considerable time gap between\n\nthe date of the incident and the date of the trial, the court cannot expect the evidence to be\n\nentirely free of contradictions or omissions. A victim\u2019s testimony does not need to be\n\nperfect to be credible. What is essential is the consistency of the core aspects of the\n\nnarrative, even if minor details vary.

The incident occurred in 2014, and the trial commenced in\n\nNovember 202i, seven years later. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect the witnesses to\n\nnarrate what they saw with mathematical precision at the trial.

The Appellant had been talking to her and his daughter when\n\nthe second incident had taken place.

When the\n\nCA/HCC/0139/2024\n\n5 | P a g e\n\nvictim had then tried to leave the room, the Appellant had hugged the victim\n\nfrom behind.\n\nThe third incident had taken place when she was leaving Thimira\u2019s room\n\nafter taking a wash.

At the time the victim had encountered this, she was 13\n\nyears and 8 months old.\n\nThe victim and her mother had continued to visit the Appellant after the\n\nincident.

It has to be much more serious than a touch and to come within\n\nCA/HCC/0139/2024\n\n7 | P a g e\n\nserious and grave in nature that it can only fall short of Rape, but must\n\nsurpass situations expected in section 345,365 and 365A\u201d.\n\nFurther, in the case of Yoga v. Attorney-General [2010] 2 Sri L.R. 162 it was\n\nheld that:\n\n\u201cTo establish a charge under section 365 (B) of the Penal Code the\n\nprosecution must establish that the alleged act was done with the intention\n\nof having sexual gratification. This aspect must be proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the pertinent issue at hand would be whether the 1st and 2nd\n\ncharges in the indictment could clearly constitute offences under Section 365\n\nB (1) of the Penal Code as amended. In respect of the 1st charge, the alleged\n\nact is that the Appellant had touched the chest area of the victim to obtain\n\nsexual gratification. In respect of the 2nd charge, the alleged act is that the\n\nAppellant had touched the genital area of the victim over her dress to obtain\n\nsexual gratification.\n\nAs examined above, there must be serious, grave circumstances involved in\n\nthe situation in order to punish an accused under Section 365B (1). In this\n\ncase, as seen in the charges, the Appellant had only touched the chest area\n\nand the genital area of the victim. Thereby, I conclude that mere touching of\n\nsuch sensitive areas of a person would not fall under the scope of grave\n\nsexual abuse, as Section 365 B only includes graver situations which fall\n\nshort of rape.\n\nAccordingly, it must now be considered whether the Appellant could be found\n\nguilty in respect of a lesser offence, with the evidence available in this\n\nsituation.\n\nAs per the facts of this case, it is quite evident that the Appellant, while being\n\na close relation of the victim, had used his authority and breached the trust"

Therefore, it is\n\nthen necessary to determine the appropriate section of the Penal Code that\n\nis most applicable in this scenario.\n\nSection 345 of Penal Code as amended states:\n\n\u201cWhoever, by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses\n\nanother person, or by the use of words or actions, causes sexual\n\nannoyance or harassment to such other person commits the offence of\n\nsexual harassment and shall on conviction be punished with\n\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five\n\nyears or with fine or with both and may also be ordered to pay\n\ncompensation of an amount determined by court to the person in\n\nrespect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to\n\nsuch person.\u201d\n\nEXPLANATION\n\n1.

The foregoing clearly shows that PW01 has not been forthcoming about\n\nwhat happened before and during the incident in which the deceased\n\nsustained the fatal injuries.\n\n20. The other matter of concern to this Court is whether PW01 did see the\n\nincident of assault on the deceased as claimed by him.\n\n21. According to the evidence of the investigating officer, the height of the\n\nembankment has been about five to six feet high. PW01 has claimed to\n\nhave climbed the embankment and hidden in the nearby tea plantation.\n\n22. The alleged assault has taken place in a narrow strip of land. On one\n\nside had been a construction, and on the other side, an embankment.\n\nThe embankment has been five to six feet high.\n\n23. PW01 has been on top of the embankment, about fifteen feet away from\n\nits edge, facing the narrow strip of land where the assault allegedly\n\noccurred. Given that there was a tea plantation on top of the\n\nembankment; PW01 would have had to hide among the tea bushes. In\n\nsuch circumstances, his vision would have been impaired by the\n\nvegetation and also because the alleged incident has occurred about six\n\nfeet below his eye line abutting the embankment, when he was crouching\n\namong the tea bushes fifteen feet away, to avoid detection. Therefore, it is\n\nhighly doubtful that PW01 saw what he claimed to have seen.\n\n24. Further, PW01 has also testified that the first accused named in the"

Further, PW01 has also testified that the first accused named in the\n\ninvestigating officer, he has stated that it was the fourth accused\n\nappellant (Piyasena) who attacked the deceased first. The discrepancy\n\nhas been highlighted and marked as contradiction V3.\n\nPage 10 of 12\n\n25. The position taken up by PW01 has been that when the deceased was\n\nattacked, he ran away from the place he was hiding and on his return\n\nabout half an hour later, that he came to know from his wife\u201fs elder\n\nsister that the deceased had been killed. However, contradictions marked\n\nV6, V8 and V9 indicate that he has taken a different position as regard to\n\nwhere he was in hiding until about 17.00 hours and came to know about\n\nthe deceased\u201fs death, thereafter.\n\n26. The discrepancies mentioned earlier cannot be solely attributed to\n\nPW01\u201fs failure to accurately narrate the purported incident. This Court\n\nconcurs with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellants,\n\nnoting that such discrepancies were evident in PW01\u201fs testimony\n\nbecause he was describing an incident he had not personally witnessed.\n\n27. In that context, I find that the learned High Court Judge has misdirected\n\nhimself when he determined that the appellants have failed to challenge\n\nthe testimony of PW01 on material points.\n\n28. Also, PW01 has not made a statement to the investigators until seven\n\ndays after the incident. More importantly, the statement has not been\n\ngiven voluntarily. It has been obtained only after the investigators have\n\ntaken PW01 to the police station. PW01\u201fs attempts to justify the delay by\n\nciting his involvement in the deceased\u201fs funeral arrangements is\n\nunpersuasive since other witnesses some of whom were next of kin of the\n\ndeceased had furnished their statements on the very next day.\n\n29.

However, it is clear that\n\nthe learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the basic ingredients\n\nthat need to be established in order to prove the charge of unlawful\n\nassembly and committing an offence while being members of an unlawful\n\nassembly.

As the Petitioner has filed an appeal\n\nwhich is pending in the Court of Appeal, I conclude that the Petitioner\n\ncould take up those grounds for argument at the appeal argument."

The petitioners are now seeking\n\nto quash the said decision communicated by P-31.\n\nWRT/0051/24\n\n5.

The petitioners\n\nare now challenging this decision on the basis that the petitioners, by\n\nthemselves, were in actual possession and occupation and that the 4th\n\nrespondent was not in physical possession as claimed at the said\n\ninquiry. The said Lot No. 140 is 3 acres and 14.4 perches in extent (R-\n\n10). The petitioners are seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the 1st,\n\n2nd, and 3rd respondents to issue a permit in respect of the entirety of\n\nthe said Lot No. 140. The relief so sought should be considered in\n\naccordance with the legal regime and provisions of law prevalent as at\n\ntoday.\n\n6. According to the respondents, the maximum extent of state land that\n\nmay be alienated to an individual, in accordance with the prevalent\n\ncirculars, is one acre, in proof of which circulars R-4 and R-5 have been\n\ntendered. R-4, issued by the Land Commissioner General, prescribes\n\nmatters to be considered when state land is alienated, especially to\n\nunauthorised occupiers, and there are certain matters required to be\n\nconsidered and followed. They are provided for by R-4.

The petitioners may have been in occupation of the land in question,\n\nbut there is material coming forth from the Land Settlement Officer, as\n\nrespondent and/or her mother had also been in occupation, at least of\n\na portion of this land. When considering the submissions and averments\n\nof the petitioners, it is apparent that they have, at various times, for\n\nvarious purposes, held out that they were in occupation of different\n\nextents of land. At one point, it is said to be 1.5 acres, then 2 or 3 acres,\n\nand now they are seeking a permit for the entirety of this land. This\n\nclearly shows that the petitioners have not been in possession of the\n\nentirety of Lot No. 140, as is claimed today; the 4th respondent has\n\ncertainly, either by herself or through her mother, also been in\n\noccupation of at least a portion thereof.\n\n18.

This decision has been made upon hearing all the parties and\n\nconsidering the reports and other information from the relevant\n\nauthorities and persons, and thus has followed the rules of natural\n\njustice and considered the relevant material. Accordingly, I see no lawful\n\nbasis to disturb the findings conveyed by P-31 in the exercise of the writ\n\njurisdiction of this Court.\n\n19. As the regulations stand today, there is an upper cap, or a ceiling, of 1\n\nacre (high land) prescribed for alienation of State Land. The petitioners\n\ntogether are seeking a permit/s, either jointly or separately, for land\n\nexceeding the said limitation. Accordingly, neither are the petitioners\n\nlawfully entitled to receive nor are the respondents under a duty to issue\n\npermits in violation of the said circulars."

Moreover, the petitioner cannot argue that, under the agreement marked P2, he is entitled to pay the amount stipulated therein and resign from the commission. The agreement should be read in line with the provisions of the Air Force Act, and the agreement cannot override the express provisions of the Act. In the case of P.S. Bus Company Limited vs. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61 NLR 491, the court held, inter alia,\u201cThe Court should also take into consideration the disastrous consequences of granting the Writ.\u201d Considering the conduct of the petitioner, the court cannot use its discretion in favour of the petitioner. If the Court allowed the petitioner's application, it could set a bad precedent and as the Air Force Commander expressed his fear, lead Tri Services Medical Officers in the same category to gain MBBS qualifications and leave the service as and when they decide to do so. In the above circumstances, the respondents have acted in accordance with the provisions of the Air Force Act. The recommendations of the 1st respondent to the Ministry of Defence cannot be considered arbitrary or ultra vires. Therefore, the application of the petitioner is dismissed.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal\n\nDr. S. Premachandra J.\n\nI agree.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal."

However, the 5th\n\nRespondent produced several documents with his objections dated 9th March 2025 and the\n\nMedia Limited operate within the same corporate group. Document R6 corroborates that the 5th\n\nRespondent was transferred from one entity to another and it is significant R6 was signed by\n\nKeith Wilson on behalf of Reuters Limited while the affidavit marked A8 was sworn and given\n\nby the same person on behalf of Reuters News and Media Limited.\n\nIn view of this material, it is evident that the transfer of the 5th Respondent between two entities\n\nof the same group did not interrupt the continuity of his employment. A mere internal transfer\n\nwithin a corporate group cannot be relied upon to suggest that the employment relationship was\n\ndiscontinued.\n\nNext, I turn to the question of the nature of the relationship between the Petitioner and the 5th\n\nRespondent, namely whether it constituted a contract of employment or merely a contract for\n\nemployment.\n\n7\n\nIn determining whether an individual is a freelancer or an employee, the Court is required to\n\nexamine the substance of the relationship, not the labels used by the employer. It is abundantly\n\nclear that the Petitioner failed to submit any of the annual contracts signed by the parties to the\n\ninstant application whereas the 5th Respondent has produced the written contract marked R1\n\nalong with his objection.\n\nThe material before this Court demonstrate that the 5th Respondent had been working for the\n\nPetitioner under annually renewed agreements from 2005 until 2018. Such long term,\n\nuninterrupted service is inconsistent with freelance work which is ordinarily ad hoc, assignment\n\nbased and non-exclusive. A worker who remains attached to the same organization for more than\n\na decade, on annual renewals indicates the regular nature of the work of the 5th Respondent."

We note that, in addition to that Appellant was\n\nabsent, and the court has issued a warrant.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\nIt is evident that the Learned High Court Judge has given careful consideration to both\n\nmitigating and aggravating factors relevant to the case. The sentencing decision clearly\n\nreflects a measured and balanced evaluation, with appropriate weight given to the\n\nmitigating circumstances.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge carefully weighed all mitigating and aggravating factors\n\nbefore imposing a sentence of 10 years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment. This decision reflects the\n\nbroader concern about the risk of such injustices recurring, and underscores society\u2019s\n\ndependence on the justice system to uphold a deterrent effect, preserving social order and\n\npreventing the escalation of crime.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, we find no justification to interfere with the sentence\n\nhanded down by the Learned High Court Judge on 02.05.2024.\n\nThe Sentence is backdated to the date of conviction, namely 02.05.2024. Furthermore, we\n\nmake no change in the fine and the compensation imposed on the Appellant.\n\nThe Registrar of this court is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of\n\nBalapitiya for compliance.\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

Such other and further reliefs as Your Lordships\u2019 Court shall seem fit\n\nand meet.\n\n2] Brief history of this application is as follows: the case began in the Magistrate's\n\nbreach of peace regarding a family burial ground. The officer in charge of\n\nGalewela Police Station had filed a report under section 66 of the Primary Court\n\nProcedure Act. The 1st Party (Petitioner) claimed the land, called\n\n\"Deganthuduwa,\" was a Paraveni Property given to her father and used as a\n\nfamily burial ground for over 75 years, alleging that the 2nd Party\n\n(Ethabendiwewa Upali Himi) unlawfully entered and filled the graves. The 2nd\n\nParty disputed this, claiming the land was not a family burial ground and the\n\n1st Party lacked title. It is seen in the said action that there were two intervenient\n\nparties, namely Adhikari Gedara Thilakaratne and Adhikarigedara Punchim\n\nMenika. However, by order dated 26/01/2016, said case bearing No. 68943(66)\n\nof Dambulla District/Magistrate\u2019s Court, the learned Primary Court Judge held\n\nthat possession was to be given to the 1st Party, the Petitioner.\n\n3] The controversy escalated when the Divisional Secretary of Galewela\n\n(Appellant/Petitioner) filed an action seeking recovery of possession under the\n\nState Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act of the said land, case bearing No. 80992\n\nof Dambulla District/Magistrate\u2019s Court, the basis of this application.\n\n4] The Respondent (the original 1st Party), now the Petitioner in this application,\n\nobjected, asserting the land was a Paraveni Property and provided documents,\n\n5\n\n\u0dc0\u0dcf1 to \u0dc0\u0dcf 7. After inquiry, the learned Magistrate, by order dated 21/03/2018,\n\nissued an order of ejectment, which was upheld by the Provincial High Court.\n\n5] The Petitioner now seeks a Revision/Restitutio in Integrum, arguing the courts\n\nacted on documents with \"no legal value,\" failed to properly address the land"

It is seen though; the Petitioner had filed revision\n\napplication with regard to the order of 66 Application order, the Petitioner has\n\nnot filed any application before High Court, regarding recovery of the State Land\n\nRecovery of Possession Act. She has clear statutory rights against the\n\nMagistrate\u2019s impugned order which was delivered under the State Land Recovery\n\nof Possession Act. Thus, it is clear that despite the alternative remedy, the\n\nPetitioner had filed this application to this court. In Wijersiri Gunawardane &\n\nOthers v.

Due to the fatal blow, the deceased\n\nhad collapsed and the witness had seen the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Appellants\n\nstanding in the vicinity. The 2nd and 4th Appellants, who were armed with\n\niron rods, had pelted stones at him to chase him out from the scene of crime.\n\nDue to fear, he took to his heels and when he had turned back, he had seen\n\nthe 2nd and 4th Appellants dealing blows on the deceased\u2019s body with iron\n\nrods. PW1 had then hidden himself in the dark for about one hour and had\n\nonly appeared after the arrival of the police."

The High Court\n\nJudge had considered these circumstances in his judgement.\n\nCA/HCC/0139-142/2020\n\n7 | P a g e\n\nIn the case of Sumanasena v. The Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri.L.R 137\n\nheld that;\n\nsolitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court\n\nof Law.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Madduma Siripala and another v. The Attorney General\n\nCA/125-126/10 decided on 27/10/2017, Justice Thurairaja held that:\n\n\u201cWith reference to the above-mentioned section, there is no requisite\n\nnumber of witnesses needed to be called to prove a fact. In fact, the\n\nevidence of a single witness is sufficient to prove a fact provided the\n\nevidence of the witness is uncontradicted, truthful, independent and\n\nreliable to the court\u201d.\n\nIn the case of Chacko Alias Aniyan Kunju & others v. State of Kerala-\n\n[2004] INSC 87 (21st January 2004) held that:\n\n\u201cThe provision clearly states that no particular number of witnesses is\n\nrequired to establish the case. Conviction can be based on the testimony\n\nof single witness if he is wholly reliable. Corroboration may be necessary\n\nwhen he is partially reliable. If the evidence is unblemished and beyond\n\nall possible criticism and the Court is satisfied that the witness was\n\nspeaking the truth then on his evidence alone conviction can be\n\nmaintained\u201d.\n\nWith reference to the above cited judicial decisions, it is abundantly clear\n\nthat the trial court can act on the evidence of a single witness whose evidence\n\nis truthful and impressive to come to a correct finding.\n\nCA/HCC/0139-142/2020\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nIn this case PW1 had vividly explained how the Appellants had committed\n\nthe murder of the deceased.\n\nThe doctor had noted about 09 injuries on the deceased. The first injury had\n\nbeen inflicted on the head of the deceased. Further, six cut injuries were seen\n\non the head of the deceased. According to the doctor the death was caused\n\nas a result of a haemorrhage due to Cranio-Cerebral injuries from the cut"

Thereby, it was\n\ncontended that a conviction for murder is not safe based on his testimony.\n\nThe importance of an omission in criminal trials has been discussed in\n\nseveral judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our country. It is\n\npertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned omissions have any\n\nadverse effect on the evidence given by PW01 in this case.\n\nIn the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa\n\n(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,\n\n\u201cWhilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect\n\nthe trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that\n\nthe Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency\n\nor contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.\n\nDiscrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the\n\nbasic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance.\n\nWitnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies\n\nand omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should\n\ndirect his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness\n\nshould be given an opportunity of explaining the matter.\u201d\n\nCA/HCC/0139-142/2020\n\n10 | P a g e\n\nThe incident happened on 06/03/1998 and PW01 had given evidence before\n\nthe High Court on 06/02/2017 after about 19 years of the incident.\n\nConsidering the contradictions, omissions and the passage of time after the\n\nincident, a reasonable court cannot expect hundred percent accurate\n\nevidence from a witness.

The charge sheet P-8(b) is in\n\nconfiscated sand in a manner contrary to the applicable Circular issued\n\nby the JSC.

Then, it was argued that the acts on which the disciplinary action is\n\nbased are judicial decisions, and even if they be erroneous, the remedy\n\nis not disciplinary but appellate.

As I see, P-13, the decision to terminate the services made upon the\n\nconsideration of two inquiry reports, may be voidable but is certainly not\n\na nullity. The JSC did have the authority and the power to determine\n\nthe sanction upon considering the said inquiry reports. The fact that the\n\ndisciplinary action was based on what the petitioner referred to as\n\njudicial orders does not make the process or the finding a nullity. In\n\ncertain circumstances, a judicial order, though amenable to review or\n\nappeal, can also be the subject matter of discipline. There is no absolute\n\nlegal or other bar preventing or prohibiting judicial decisions from being\n\nthe subject of discipline.\n\nAre judicial orders amenable to discipline?"

The petitioner has claimed ignorance of\n\nthe circular which contains specific directions as to the manner of\n\ndealing with such confiscated sand.

In\n\nfact, there are two reports in the record. The psychiatric report is dated\n\nmentioned in Court. It is found in the certified copy of the record. A\n\nconscious inquiry would have certainly revealed its existence or the fact\n\nthat it was sent to the Magistrate\u2019s Court by the psychiatrist.

This conduct, even if it is considered a single instance, I would consider\n\nit to be a serious legal error, which, in particular, has led to the denial\n\nof the suspect\u2019s basic fundamental rights of freedom. It is universally\n\naccepted that conduct by a Judicial Officer, negligently or recklessly, or\n\nwith a total disregard and without being conscious of the onerous duty,\n\nwill certainly fall far short of such person acting as a judicial officer.

A Judge, like Caesar\u2019s wife, must be above suspicion. The credibility of the judicial system is dependent upon the Judges who man it.

The counsel submitted that the sentence is excessive given the minimum mandatory\n\nsentence is 10 years. In the case before the High Court, it was submitted that the\n\nAppellant is 36 years old, married, and has one child who studies at grade 6; and the\n\nAppellant is the sole breadwinner upon whom the entire family is financially\n\ndependent.

Accordingly, the principal ground urged by the defense in mitigation is the hardship\n\nlikely to befall the Appellant\u2019s family consequent to his incarceration.\n\n11. There are instances where courts exercise leniency in sentencing an accused despite\n\nthe nature of the offence, particularly where mitigating circumstances are present. To\n\nelaborate further, a lesser sentence may be imposed only if the Court is satisfied that\n\n\u201csubstantial and compelling circumstances\u201d exist which would justify such a\n\ndeparture. However, courts must also remain mindful of the message conveyed to\n\nsociety, especially the principle that offences of a heinous nature will not be tolerated\n\nor treated lightly.\n\n12. In deciding whether the mitigatory grounds advanced by the Appellant warrant a\n\nreduction of sentence, this Court must not lose sight of the aggravating circumstances\n\nsurrounding the case, nor of the legislative intent in prescribing severe custodial\n\nsentences for sexual offences.\n\n13. Sri Lankan Courts, in a long line of judicial authorities have held that cases involving\n\nsexual offences, especially where the victims are children, have to be severely dealt\n\nwith so as to create deterrence on the society."

We must remember that a rapist not only\n\nviolates the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes\n\nserious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not\n\nmerely a physical assault- it is often destructive of the whole personality of the\n\nvictim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades\n\nthe very soul of the helpless female.

In the case of, Keith Billam (1986) Vol 82 Criminal Appeal Reports 347, the Lord\n\nChief Justice reiterated the foregoing observations and stated that in a contested case\n\nof rape a figure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting point of the\n\nsentence, subject to any aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as\n\nfollows:\n\n\" The crime should in any event be treated as aggravated by any of the\n\nfollowing factors : (1) violence is used over and above the force necessary, to\n\ncommit the rape ; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the victim ; (3)\n\nthe rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been carefully planned : (5) the\n\ndefendant has a previous convictions for rape or other serious offences of a\n\nviolent or sexual kind ; (6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities\n\nor perversions ; (7) the victim is either very old or very young ; (8) the effect\n\nupon the victim, whether physical or mental, is of special seriousness. Where\n\nany one or more of these aggravating features are present, the sentence\n\nshould be substantially higher than the figure suggested as the starting point\n\n\".\n\n25. It can be observed that several of these aggravating circumstances are present in the\n\ncase in hand. The appellant\u2019s request for a glass of water, by which he deceptively\n\ncreated an opportunity to forcibly remove the prosecutrix to a room; the fact that her\n\ngrandmother was asleep after taking medication; the appellant\u2019s prior confirmation\n\nthat the parents were absent from the house; the tender age of the victim, who was\n\nbelow the legal age of consent; the evident degree of pre-planning by the appellant;"

According to PW1, the team left on routine patrol at 9.00 a.m. The arrest in the\n\nKeselwatta area was made at 13.00 hours, and the appellant was subsequently arrested\n\nat 20.00 hours. However, no record or note was made regarding the time at which the\n\ninformation concerning the appellant was received.

In a raid of this nature, it is of paramount importance to maintain notes pertaining to\n\nthe important events which led to the arrest. In the present case, there is a significant\n\ntime gap between the first arrest and the arrest of the appellant. The prosecution\n\nversion is that they were patrolling the area and had communication with their\n\ninformants. In the absence of the odometer reading of the vehicle in which they\n\ntravelled and accurate notes it is difficult to ascertain the truth of the prosecution\n\nversion.\n\n13.

It is also noteworthy that there exists a significant omission in the chain of custody of\n\nthe productions. According to the prosecution, the productions were handed over to\n\nthe Magistrate\u2019s Court by PC 55637 Balasuriya and were accepted by a production\n\nclerk named T. L. Kosala.

Furthermore, this Court cannot lightly overlook the basis upon which the learned trial\n\nJudge rejected the defence evidence.

It can also be observed that the testimony of\n\nthe defence witnesses, although subjected to cross-examination, does not reveal any\n\nsignificant inter-se contradictions.

According to the initial B Report filed, the Police have reported\n\nthe attempted fraudulent release of the said consignment of cigarettes.\n\nWRT/0624/24\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\nAs opposed to this, the petitioner claims that he was not in a lorry but\n\nwas arrested whilst being in his vehicle nearby. That being so, the\n\npetitioner\u2019s position is that there is absolutely no evidence to justify\n\nnaming him as a suspect. However, according to the further reports and\n\nthe objections, it is apparent that the Customs as well as the Police\n\nhave recorded a statement of the local agent of the shipping company\n\nthat was involved in the importation of this consignment, in the course\n\nof which they have identified the actual importer, who is alleged to be\n\nliving abroad. The said clearing agent or wharf clerk has informed the\n\nCustoms that the person who negotiated and was instrumental in\n\nprocessing the importation at this end is the petitioner.\n\n4. A Customs inquiry is conducted primarily for the purposes of\n\nascertaining if there is sufficient material to proceed against a person\n\nunder the Customs Ordinance.

Then, it is upon such initial\n\nWRT/0624/24\n\nPage 5 of 7\n\ninvestigation that charges may be determined and framed, if there be\n\nevidence to support such charges. It is at this point one could determine\n\nand ascertain what the probable charges could be.

In the present instance, there is material which indicates that\n\nthe petitioner was present when the consignment of cigarettes was\n\ndetected, be it in the lorry or in the vicinity. That, coupled with the\n\nrevelation by the clearing agent or wharf clerk, to my mind, is sufficient\n\nto name the petitioner as a suspect in the Customs Investigation and\n\nInquiry.

Therefore, it is not\n\nconceivable that such a charge of public nuisance can be maintained by the police.

In light of this discrepancy, our attention\n\nnow turns to the evidence of PW 2.\n\nPW 2, Inoka Priyadarshani, the mother of the victim, admitted the fact that the victim\n\nhad anger issues, and due to his inappropriate behaviour, he was recommended to an\n\nevening class.\n\nPage 84 of the brief,\n\n\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb : \u0d87\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0dba\u0ddc\u0dc0 \u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dad\u0dca \u0db4\u0ddc\u0dc3\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0dda\u0dca\u0dda?\n\n\u0d8b: \u0d91\u0dba\u0ddc \u0daf\u0d9f\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0ddc \u0dc0\u0dc3 \u0db4\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dca\u0dba\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dc5\u0ddc. \u0dca \u0dba\u0ddc \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0daf\u0d9f\u0dba\u0dd2, \u0dc5 \u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dbb \u0d91\u0dca\n\n\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dc1\u0dda\u0dab \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0ddc \u0dca\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dba\u0db1\u0dc0\u0ddc. \u0dc0\u0dc3 \u0db4\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dca\u0dba\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dbd\u0ddc \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dca\u0dba\u0db1\u0dc0\u0ddc.\n\nPage 9 of 13\n\nThe witness testified that, as part of her customary practice after returning from work,\n\nshe would ask the victim about events that had occurred during the week.

Further, the PW 2 denied the\n\ndefence\u2019s suggestion that she reported the matter merely to protect the victim from\n\nallegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the Learned High Court Judge noted that, while certain\n\ninconsistencies were present in the evidence, they were not of such a nature as to raise a"

According to PW 1, during the\n\ntrial, he did not disclose how many times similar incidents had occurred. Furthermore,\n\nthe defence highlighted as an omission the allegation that the Appellant had shown\n\npornographic material to the victim, which the victim had also failed to disclose to his\n\nmother, PW 2. It is therefore evident that there are material discrepancies between the\n\nevidence of PW 1, PW 2, and PW 7.\n\nOur courts have consistently held that where such discrepancies go to the root of the\n\nmatter and undermine the basic version of the victim, the court must attach due weight\n\nto those discrepancies.\n\nWhat is a discrepancy was described in The Law of Evidence by Sir John Woodroffe and\n\nSyed Amir Ali (18th edition, Volume I, page 411),\n\n\u201c(5) DISCREPANCIES\n\nPage 11 of 13\n\nThe constant theme on the appreciation of evidence in our courts is the\n\ndiscrepancies in the testimony of various witnesses. In regard to these\n\ndiscrepancies, two extremes have to be steered clear from, namely:"

    "chunk_text": "The constant theme on the appreciation of evidence in our courts is the\n\ndiscrepancies in the testimony of various witnesses. In regard to these\n\ndiscrepancies, two extremes have to be steered clear from, namely:\n\nthe untutored veracity of the witnesses and that they suggest that the witnesses\n\nhave not learnt the same story by heart;\n\nor\n\n(b) lay too much stress on discrepancies without any attempt to appraise their real\n\nvalue and effect, thereby leading to serious failure of justice.\n\nThe proper course is, it is not enough merely to speak about the discrepancies in\n\nthe evidence, but there should be a fitting comment on the quality of the evidence\n\ncoming from the witnesses. Discrepancies in the statements of witnesses on\n\nmaterial points should not be lightly passed over, as they seriously affect the value\n\nof the testimony. When there is inconsistency in evidence, the same cannot be\n\naccepted.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nTrifling discrepancies should be ignored, because several persons, giving their\n\nversions of the transactions witnessed by them, are naturally liable to disagree on\n\nmaterial points, their powers of observation, exhibition of memory being not the\n\nsame and honest differences being possible. There can be discrepancies of truth as\n\nwell as discrepancies of falsehood. It is common experience that discrepancies do\n\noccur, even in the statements of perfectly honest witnesses; they are really due to\n\ndifferences in individual faculties with regard to observation, recollection and\n\nrecital of details; and unless there is any good ground to think that they are due to\n\na deliberate attempt to suppress or depart from the truth, it is unfair to discard\n\nthe direct testimony of witnesses, merely on account of such discrepancies, when\n\nthere is a general agreement as to material circumstances. It is the broad facts of\n\na case, and not the minor details, that have to be considered in weighing evidence.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nWhile appreciating the evidence, the variances and discrepancies in details,"

The reason is that he has failed to mention that\n\non several occasions earlier to the incident on 19.09.2015, the Appellant and the victim\n\nhad engaged in oral sex. And also, there is a delay in making the complaint to the police\n\nand recording a statement from the victim.\n\nFrom the above matters, a reasonable doubt is created on the question of whether the\n\nincident which was described in the indictment was performed on that day.\n\nConsidering all the above matters, we hold that the prosecution has failed to establish the\n\ncase beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High\n\nCourt Judge are hereby set aside.

According to the 2nd Appellant, on\n\nthe previous day, they had met the deceased, who had asked them to come the\n\nfollowing day to discuss the transaction. According to the Appellant, when they\n\narrived at the house, PW 1 opened the gate. (It is noted that this was not advanced\n\nby the defence during the cross-examination of PW 1.) PW 1 then went inside and\n\nwoke up the deceased, who came out and took hold of an iron rod that was near\n\nthe wall and began to strike the appellant. The 1st Appellant seized the iron rod\n\nfrom the deceased and struck him in return. At that time, PW 1 brought chilli-\n\nmixed water and threw it at the appellants.

The deceased then returned, took the\n\niron rod from the 1st Appellant, and subsequently fell down. At that point, the 2nd\n\nAppellant, in order to safeguard his brother, struck the deceased once with the\n\nknife.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge rejected the appellants\u2019 defense of a sudden fight\n\nand ruled that the appellants are guilty of murdering Samantha Kumara.\n\nThe main arguments advanced by the Appellants are as follows:\n\n1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account the\n\ndiscrepancies in the eyewitness testimony.\n\n2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to properly consider the\n\noccurrence of a sudden fight."

Having indulged in that exercise\n\nPage 9 of 16\n\nhe finally observed that discrepancies which do not go to the root of the\n\nmatter and shake the basic version of the witnesses therefore, cannot be\n\nannexed with undue importance: Bharwada Bhogindhai Hirjibhai v.

Tilakawardane, J. in A.G vs. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa (SC\n\nAppeal 7912008, SC minutes dated 06.05.2010) has observed that.\n\n\"Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic\n\nversion of the witness cannot be given too much importance. \"\n\nAccordingly, we find that the discrepancy highlighted by the Appellants does not\n\nundermine the credibility of the witnesses. We are mindful that both witnesses,\n\nwho are the wife and the son testifying on the memory of a horrendous incident\n\nwhere the deceased was killed.\n\nIt is true that the wife of the deceased, PW 1 did not mention seeing the deceased\n\ncarrying a pole. However, the second son, PW 2 stated that he observed the\n\ndeceased holding a pole. It must be remembered that PW 1\u2019s testimony focused on\n\nhow the Appellants entered the house armed and began attacking the deceased.\n\nIn an attempt to protect her husband, the deceased she threw chilli powder mixed"

It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen.\n\nOrdinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The Witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to attuned to absorb the details.\n\nThe powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person\u2019s mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another.\n\nOrdinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on.\u201d\n\nI hold that the discrepancies highlighted by the Appellants does not go to the root\n\nof the matter.

It is enough for him to show as in a civil case that\n\nthe preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea.\u201d\n\nThe Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows,\n\n\u2018when a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the\n\nexistence of circumstances bringing the case within any of general\n\nexceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso\n\ncontained in any part of the same Code, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. is upon him, and the\n\ncourt shall presume absence of such circumstances\u201d (Emphasis added)\n\nIs there any evidence before the trial judge that supports the private defence?\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Learned High Court Judge correctly found that both\n\nAppellants, armed with weapons, entered the house and attacked its windows. No\n\nevidence was adduced of any injuries sustained by the Appellants, whereas the\n\ndoctor recorded multiple injuries on the deceased. It was further established that,\n\nPage 14 of 16\n\nimmediately following the incident, the Appellants threatened the witnesses.

When the police, PW 10, inspected the scene, they\n\nobserved damage caused to the house. It is further noted that the deceased\n\nsustained multiple injuries inflicted by the Appellants, whereas no injuries were\n\nfound on either Appellant.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded that there is no evidence to\n\nestablish that the injuries sustained by the deceased were inflicted in the exercise\n\nof private defence. We are further of the view that there is no material to\n\ndemonstrate any necessity for the Appellants to cause such injuries to the\n\ndeceased.\n\nWe note that the Appellants arrived armed and entered the house. Furthermore,\n\nboth PW 1 and PW 2 consistently testified that the 1st Appellant assaulted the\n\ndeceased with an iron pipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna\n\nknife. It is also established, based on the testimony of PW 1 and PW 2, that the\n\nAppellants threatened the family members of the deceased before they are leaving\n\nthe house. Upon evaluating the evidence, we hold that the Appellants entered the\n\npremises with a common intention.\n\nUpon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution established the case,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the Appellants committed the murder of\n\nSamantha Kumara.\n\nPage 16 of 16\n\nIn those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the disputed judgment\n\ntogether with the sentencing order.\n\nThe Appeal is dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

Coomaraswamy in his book \u2018The Law of Evidence\u2019 Volume 1 at\n\n\u201cA fundamental requisite in a criminal case is to establish the identity\n\nof the accused as the guilty party. The text-books abound with\n\ninstances of what were supposed to be clear identifications which\n\nproved to be fallacious and defective. These include the case where an\n\nhonest witness was deceived by the broad glare of sunlight, (R. Vs.\n\nWood and Brown [Ann-Reg. 1784]) \u2026 \u2026Much of the value of direct\n\nevidence of identification will depend on the personal appearance of\n\nthe subject of identification. Many persons cannot be easily\n\ndistinguished from others. The liability mistake is greater where the\n\nquestionable identity is a matter of deduction and inference and the\n\nexpression of an opinion than where it is the subject of direct evidence.\n\n(Wills, op. cit., 7th edition., pp 197-200)\u201d\n\nIn this case PW1 had clearly seen all the Appellants at the time of committing\n\nthe offence.

Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,\n\nmeans that both parties are treated in a manner which ensures their\n\nprocedural equality during the course of the trial.\n\nIn this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence"

Pursuant to a complaint received, the CMA had conducted an inquiry and it had been revealed that the aforementioned Developer had failed to register the condominium plan in accordance with section 3 of the Apartment Ownership Law, No. 11 of 1973 (as amended).2 The 2nd Petitioner\n\n4\n\nhad attended such inquiry. The CMA had directed the Developer by letter dated 09.04.20073 to take steps to register the condominium plan within 3 months thereof, and, in view of its failure to comply with such direction, had proceeded to institute Case No. 22836/05/2008 against the Developer and its directors in the Magistrate's Court of Colombo.4\n\nThe objections, inter alia, disclose that, Manisha Homes (Private) Limited had been re-registered on 10.02.2014 (R1) and that a Certificate for Common Amenities and Common Elements had been issued on 21.05.2013 (R1). Approval had also been granted for the Condominium Plan (P1)."

The act or decision complained of arose from an alleged breach of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is the \"Competent Authority\"' appointed by statute cannot alter the intrinsic character of the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari. The decision is one taken wholly within the context of the contractual relationship and not in the exercise of the powers of a public authority as such.

They are they expected to maintain the highest professional standards in the regulation and management of their respective sectors, to hold the scales even in the resolution of disputes and, perhaps most importantly, to safeguard the rights and interests of the vulnerable segments within their purview. As custodians of powers vested for the public benefit, such authorities may be reasonably expected to act with the highest degree of responsiveness, diligence, efficiency, transparency and accountability in the discharge of their mandate.

Consequently, the Petitioner appealed to the 1st\n\nRespondent by letter marked as P5, requesting to differ his transfer, and the said appeal was turned\n\ndown by the 2nd Respondent and who had asked him to immediately return to his office in Sri\n\nLanka, by the letter marked as P6.\n\nBeing aggrieved by the said decision of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner has come to this Court,\n\nseeking to invoke its writ jurisdiction to quash the decision contained in P4, the letter of conclusion\n\nof his Tour of Duty received by him, dated 16th July 2025, and the subsequent letter P6, turning\n\ndown his request to reconsider his transfer.\n\n4\n\nThis was supported for notice on 7th August 2025.

He heavily relies on the judgement of Justice Saleem Marsoof in\n\nthe case of Ratnasiri and Others v. Ellawala and Others (2004)1.\n\nThe second contention of Mr. Jayawardena is that when the Petitioner sought the reasons by P5 as\n\nto why his Tour of Duty was concluded by P4. It was the explanation of the Respondents by way\n\nof Objections, since the Minister had given directions to the 2nd Respondent to recall the Petitioner\n\nfrom his Tour of Duty by R5 (document marked along with the Objections), such decision has\n\nbeen taken by the 1st Respondent.

As such, the said letter P4 along with P6 is not only irrational, but they were also\n\nauthored under the pressure and dictates of the Minister; therefore, politically motivated decision\n\nis contained therein, though it is not articulate.\n\nHowever, on a question posed by the Court, on whether R5 is only a red herring, his contention is\n\nthat reasons must be given in P4 and P6, otherwise the political reasons have to be attributed to\n\nR5 only.\n\nMr. Dharmawardena on the other hand, having referred to the letter R5, argued that according to\n\nthe Article 52(2) of the Constitution, ministers are not just puppets or cogs in a wheel; any\n\nparticular minister of a particular ministry can give directions to carry out policy decisions to his\n\nsecretary. Therefore, R5 is justified."

It is observed that this fact has been informed to the inquiring officer by the letter marked as X7. The learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Petitioner concedes that this letter had been submitted to the inquiring officer after he had delivered the order dated X6. Further, he\n\n6\n\nconcedes that the said documents were not objected to nor its authenticity challenged before the inquiring officer before he delivered the order. Thus, it is clear that at the time the inquiring officer arrived at his decision marked X6 he had not received X7 and there was no challenge by the Petitioner pertaining to the documents the inquiring officer relied on in arriving at his decision. Thus, it can be concluded that X6 had been arrived at with the documents tendered and not challenged.\n\nDid the inquiring officer fail to consider the evidence before him?"

The Petitioner had received a notice seeking him to be present for an inquiry on 22.12.2020. As the inquiring officer was not a Deputy Commissioner but another officer, the Attorney-at-Law who appeared for the Petitioner once again had objected and not participated in the inquiry. Subsequently, the inquiry had been fixed for another date but as the inquiring officer had to attend a funeral, the inquiry had not commenced. As per the written submissions of the Petitioner, the inquiry had been postponed due to various grounds attributed to both parties until 20.05.2024. On the said date the inquiry had commenced. The Petitioner submits that on the said date both parties had presented their respective cases and as there was no settlement the parties had been allowed to file their written submissions.\n\nAs per the written submissions, the Petitioner concedes that the 4th Respondent had worked in the entity as an advisor.

The Petitioner has not pleaded any ground as to why he failed or omitted to make the other partners a party to this Application. It is trite law that failure to make necessary parties are fatal to a Writ Application. In coming to this conclusion, I am guided by Rawaya Publishers v.

The\n\nProsecutor, however, is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the\n\nCA/HCC/175/23\n\n6 | P a g e\n\ncourt to dispense justice. Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a\n\nconviction at any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is\n\nmeted out. A Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either\n\nfrom the court or from the Accused. If the investigation has revealed\n\nmatters which are favourable to the Accused and the Accused is unaware\n\nof the existence of such facts, it is the bounden duty of the Prosecutor to\n\nmake those facts available to the court and to the defence. Rule 52 of the\n\nSupreme Court Rules (Conduct and Etiquette for Attorneys at Law) Rules\n\n1988 requires an Attorney at Law appearing for the prosecution to bring it\n\nto the notice of the court any matter which if withheld may lead to a\n\nmiscarriage of justice\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\nIn Wijepala v The Attorney General [2001] 1 SLR 46 at pages 49 and 51"

That Article not only entitles an\n\naccused to a right to legal representation at a trial before a competent\n\nCourt, but also to a fair trial, and that includes anything and everything\n\nnecessary for a fair trial. That would include copies of statements made to\n\nthe police by material witnesses\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe failure to disclose to an accused the existence and contents of the first\n\ninformation - which might have cast serious doubt on the informant's\n\ncredibility - may well result in a miscarriage of justice.

He is entitled in law to know such\n\nevidence before he is called upon to plead to the Indictment. It is a right of\n\nhis, inherent in that procedure.\u201d\n\nA fair trial would refer to the legal procedure which has been set in place to\n\nguarantee the fair and just treatment of individuals accused of crimes, which\n\nincludes rights such as public hearings by an independent and impartial\n\ncourt within a reasonable time period. Other key rights include the\n\npresumption of innocence until proven guilty, the right to legal\n\nrepresentation, the ability to present one\u2019s case and the right to question and\n\ncross examine evidence against them.

When the appeal was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for\n\nthe appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal;\n\ni. Has the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the\n\nprosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt based on circumstantial evidence?\n\nii. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the dying\n\ndeclaration in its correct perspective.\n\niii. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the\n\ndefence\u2019s case.\n\n11. The legal principles of dying declarations have originated in English\n\ncommon law based on the maxim \u201cnemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri\u201d\n\n(a man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth) and is applied\n\ntoday as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, though with specific\n\nconditions in different legal systems.\n\n12. The concept of trustworthiness is rooted in the belief that a person at the\n\npoint of death with no hope of recovery has a profound spiritual incentive\n\nto tell the truth, similar to being under oath. The rational for admitting\n\nthis type of evidence (despite it being hearsay and not subject to cross\n\nexamination) is necessity. Often, the victim is the only eye-witness to the\n\ncrime and excluding his or her declaration might allow a perpetrator to\n\nescape justice.\n\nPage 6 of 13\n\n13. The admissibility conditions remain. They are as follows;\n\n(a) The person who made the declaration must be unavailable as a\n\nwitness because he is the deceased.\n\n(b) The declaration must have been made when the declarant"

Further, the deceased\u2019s injuries have been confined solely to her face and\n\nhead. Notably, no injuries have been observed on her limbs or hip. It is a\n\nrecognized observation that falls commonly result in injuries to a\n\nperson\u2019s limbs and/or, hip area. Therefore, the absence of such typical\n\nfall related trauma to the limbs and hip, coupled with exclusive facial\n\nand head injuries allows a Court to infer that the deceased\u2019s injuries\n\nwere not sustained as a result of a fall.\n\nPage 12 of 13\n\n29.

The learned High Court Judge has given particular attention to these\n\ndiscrepancies when evaluating the appellant\u2019s dock statement. The\n\nlearned High Court Judge has considered the statement in a holistic\n\nmanner taking into account not only the contents of the appellant\u2019s case,\n\nbut also the context, and its implications. He has integrated the alibi\n\nalongside the prosecution\u2019s testimonies and evidence. However, despite\n\nPage 13 of 13\n\nthe appellant\u2019s assertions, the learned High Court Judge has found the\n\nprovided explanation unsatisfactory and lacking in substantiation.\n\n32. Ultimately because of these concerns, regarding the appellant\u2019s\n\ncredibility and the implausibility of his alibi, the learned High Court\n\nJudge has not been inclined to give weight to his narrative. The learned\n\nHigh Court Judge has therefore chosen not to act upon the appellant\u2019s\n\nstatement, reflecting a judicial assessment of the evidence presented.\n\n33.

The Petitioner submitted an appeal on May 8, 2025,\n\nProcurement Appeals Committee failed to notify the Petitioner of the outcome of\n\nthe appeal or provide reasons for its rejection, which was considered a violation\n\nof the rules of natural justice.

This, the Petitioner argued, evidenced that the 10th Respondent had\n\nnot submitted the necessary documents along with the bid document, meaning\n\nthe bid was not in conformity with the Bidding document as at the closing date\n\nfor submissions of bids. Consequently, the bid submitted by the 10th Respondent\n\nwas not responsive, and the 10th Respondent was not entitled to the award of\n\nthe Tender.

Therefore, this Court is of the view that the\n\nPetitioner has satisfied the initial threshold requirement which warrants this\n\nCourt to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents.\n\nHaving considered the issuance of notice, the question arises whether this Court\n\ncan grant interim reliefs that the Petitioner has sought.\n\n19\n\nThe Petitioner sought interim orders to stay the decision and Letter of Award in\n\nfavour of the 10th Respondent, prevent the 1st to 9th Respondents from acting on\n\nthe award, and direct the Respondents to produce various documents, including"

The legal consequences imposed\n\n14.\u200bIn Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe [1993] 2 SLR 81, S. N. Silva, J, as he\n\nwas then, in assessing the aggravating circumstances as regards to the\n\noffence of rape has stated as follows;\n\n\u201cIt is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the Lord Chief\n\nJustice in the Court of Appeal of England, with regard to the\n\nsentences to be imposed for an offence of rape. In the case of\n\nRoberts [4] at page 244. It was observed as follows;\n\n\u201cRape is always a serious crime. Other than in wholly exceptional\n\ncircumstances, it calls for an immediate custodial sentence. This\n\nwas certainly so in the present case. A custodial sentence is\n\nnecessary for a variety of reasons. First of all to mark the gravity of\n\nthe offence. Secondly to emphasise public disapproval. Thirdly to\n\nserve as a warning to others. Fourthly to punish the offender, and\n\nlast but by no means least, to protect women. The length of the\n\nsentence will depend on all the circumstances. That is a trite\n\n8\n\nobservation, but these, in cases of rape vary widely from case to\n\ncase.\n\nIn the case of, Keith Billiam [5] the Lord Chief Justice repeated the\n\nforegoing observations and stated that in a contested case of rape a\n\nfigure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting\n\npoint of the sentence, subject to any aggravating or mitigating\n\nfeatures. He observed further as follows:-\n\nThe crime should in any event be treated as aggravating by any of\n\nthe following factors: (1) violence is used over and above the force\n\nnecessary to commit the rape; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or\n\nwound the victim; (3) the rape is repeated; (4) the rape has been\n\ncarefully planned; (5) the defendant has previous convictions for\n\nrape or other serious offences of a violent or sexual kind; (6) the"

According to the respondents, these recruitments on contractual basis\n\nwere necessitated in order to safeguard the archaeological sites across\n\nthe island, and in view of the urgency, they were so recruited on\n\ncontractual basis. Recruitments on this basis had been made as there\n\nhad not been cadre approval to accommodate the required number of\n\nemployees at that point. To meet this exigency and due to the urgency,\n\nthe 1st respondent, the CCF, has agreed to recruit the petitioners on\n\nsuch contract basis and assign them to the Department of Archaeology\n\n(vide R-1 and R-2). It is thus admitted and conceded by the respondents\n\nthat the petitioners were employed on such contractual basis. However\n\nthe respondents claim that it was strictly on such basis for a specific\n\ntime period. The respondents also concede that such contracts initially\n\ngranted were in fact extended in respect of two categories of petitioners\n\nreferred to in paragraph 03 above.\n\n5. The position of the respondents is that, at all material times, the\n\npetitioners were employees of the CCF. Thereafter, with the approval of\n\nthe Director General of the Department of Management Services, cadre\n\npositions for 865 Archaeological Assistants and 1,000 watchers were\n\napproved within the Department of Archaeology (vide 4R-4). Then, by\n\npublic notice dated 03.04.2019, applications were called for to fill these"

As submitted by the learned State Counsel, it appears that, long\n\nthereafter, direct recruitments have been made from the Multi-Purpose\n\nDevelopment Task Force and certain of the vacancies have now been\n\nfilled. The issue for determination is whether the petitioners have a\n\nlegitimate expectation to be appointed or recruited to the said vacancies\n\non a permanent basis.

This is a clear\n\nholding out that at some point in time, upon the cadre approval, the\n\npetitioners will be attached to the Department of Archaeology. The\n\nsaid posts by the Department of Management Services. The learned\n\nState Counsel argues that this is a mere information and not a promise\n\nof permanent employment.\n\n19. The plain reading of the said clause simply means what it says, and\n\nthat\u2019s no more and no less than that the attachments will be made to\n\nthe Department of Archaeology upon the realisation or receiving of cadre\n\napproval. These petitioners have been appointed on contract basis to two\n\nspecific posts. The cadre approval was to be obtained in the future. When\n\nthe petitioners are informed that attachment would be made with the\n\napproval, that means that they will be so appointed. This certainly\n\ncreates an expectation, and as it is based on a lawful basis, to my mind,\n\nit is legitimate per se.\n\n20. I will now consider if the sequence of events that is common ground\n\nbetween the parties in fact is sufficient to create such a legitimate\n\nexpectation. The starting point is the initial letters of appointment, P-1\n\nto P-394. The petitioners have been serving between 1 \u2013 3 years in such\n\nposts and positions. The learned State Counsel does inferentially argue\n\nthat the said letters of appointment were not given by the Department\n\nof Archaeology, but the CCF. The argument is that in the absence of any\n\ndirect holding out, promise, or representation by the Department of\n\nArchaeology, the petitioners cannot have a legitimate expectation which\n\nwould bind the Department of Archaeology. To this end, I observe that\n\n4R-1 is relevant.

Paragraphs 1 and 4 read as follows:\n\n21. According to which, the Director General of Archaeology has informed\n\nthat upon a discussion held with the Minister and the Secretary, it has\n\nbeen decided that the persons who may be recruited to the CCF, upon\n\nbeing so recruited, would be attached to the Department of Archaeology.\n\nFurther it has also been stated by the Director General, in no uncertain\n\nterms, that the said recruitments to the CCF be made in accordance\n\nwith the scheme of recruitment of persons with the requisite\n\nqualifications, as such persons are due to be absorbed to the\n\nDepartment of Archaeology. This, as I see, is a clear holding out by the\n\nDirector General of Archaeology that, in fact, the petitioner, in due\n\ncourse, would be absorbed.\n\n22.

Then, the word\n\n\u2018absorption\u2019, used in paragraph 4, clearly establishes that the future\n\nattachment to the Department of Archaeology goes beyond a mere\n\n\u2018appointment\u2019. An appointment will contemplate a form of employment\n\nWRT/0127/20\n\nPage 50 of 56\n\nin the first instance.

This Board Paper confirms that which is stated\n\nin paragraphs 1 and 4 of 4R-1. The said Board Paper specifically\n\nprovides that these recruitments are specifically until the approval of the\n\ncadre of the Department of Archaeology. Similarly, the Director General\n\nof Archaeology has, by 4R-4, once again intimated that the proposed\n\ncadre increase had been approved, and as there may be a delay in\n\nrecruitment, the period of contract of the labourers and watchers, who\n\nwere recruited by the CCF, be extended. In this backdrop, in 2019,\n\ninterviews have been called for to fill in the vacancies for the posts of\n\nArchaeological Assistants and Watchers in the Department of\n\nArchaeology. It appears that the petitioners have submitted themselves\n\nto the said interviews.

These circulars have also\n\nonce again as X-1 and X-2. The position of the respondents is that in\n\nview of the said circulars, the recruitment of the petitioners, including\n\nWRT/0127/20\n\nPage 52 of 56\n\nthose who were successful at the interviews held in 2019, could not be\n\nprocessed and made. Accordingly, the learned State Counsel argues that\n\nthe petitioners are thus not entitled to seek employment as prayed for.\n\n26. I will now consider this argument in the light of the events that\n\ntranspired between 2019 and 2021. At the very outset, the petitioners\n\nhave certainly been recruited on contract basis by the CCF for the\n\nspecific purpose and object of them being employed for the purposes of\n\nthe Department of Archaeology. The use of the words \u2018attachment\u2019 and\n\n\u2018absorption\u2019 clearly puts it beyond doubt that the petitioners, though\n\nrecruited on contract basis by the CCF, were in fact so recruited on\n\nbehalf of the Department of Archaeology, at least to the extent that the\n\npersons so recruited whilst being physically employed at various\n\narchaeological sites were intended to be so absorbed and attached to the\n\nDepartment of Archaeology upon the cadre approval. In these\n\ncircumstances, the petitioners certainly will have the expectation of\n\nbeing attached and absorbed to the Department of Archaeology without\n\nany other interview or examination. However, by 4R-4 and 4R-5, there\n\nappears to have been a change that such persons may be required to\n\nface an interview. It is in view of this change of policy and procedure that\n\nthe petitioners have applied and faced the interviews in 2019.\n\n27. Up until such time, all the petitioners did have a legitimate expectation\n\nof being absorbed to the Department of Archaeology. However, the"

    "chunk_text": "The Petitioner in the instant application was an employee of the Nuwara Eliya branch of the National Housing Development Authority (hereinafter sometimes referred to as NHDA). It is said that while occupying the official quarters, the Petitioner had applied for a land from a housing scheme of the 1st Respondent in Nawagamgoda. Consequently, after all due payments were settled, the 1st Respondent had undertaken to grant the title deed for the property bearing No.56, Nawagamgoda, Hawaeliya, Nuwara Eliya, to the Petitioner as per the letter marked P2 dated 23.08.2005. However, the 2nd Respondent had unlawfully and forcibly entered into such property, and subsequently, the 1st Respondent had given possession of such property to the 2nd Respondent. Although the Petitioner had requested the 1st Respondent to evict the 2nd Respondent and hand over possession of the impugned land, the 1st Respondent had failed to do so.\n\nPage 3 of 8\n\nPetitioner states that the 1st Respondent abused the power vested in it by failing and neglecting to comply with the provisions of the National Housing Authority Act.\n\nAccordingly, the Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this Court by seeking a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to evict the 2nd Respondent from the above-mentioned house bearing No.56, and to deliver vacant possession of such house to the Petitioner and to issue the relevant title deed in favour of the Petitioner."

She resided with the\n\nincident, while returning from work around 6:30\u20137:00 p.m., PW1 heard the\n\ndistressing voice of the deceased.

PW2\n\nunequivocally stated that she saw only two persons and did not testify that they were\n\ndid anything beyond holding the deceased. Moreover, the trial Judge\u2019s conclusion that\n\nthe deceased died as a result of an assault by the 1st to 3rd accused is not supported by\n\nthe evidence. The sole eyewitness, PW2, never stated that she observed the 1st to 3rd\n\naccused attacking the deceased. Such findings, which are inconsistent with the record,\n\nconstitute material misdirection.\n\n8. What is discernible from the judgment is that several conclusions reached by the\n\nlearned trial Judge are wholly inconsistent with, or contrary to, the evidence led at the\n\ntrial. At pages 5 and 6 of the judgment, the learned Judge concludes that PW2\n\nCA/HCC/0205/2024\n\n4 | P a g e\n\nwitnessed the 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused assaulting the deceased, an assertion never made\n\nby PW2 in her testimony.\n\n9.

These findings, being unsupported by the evidence, amount to clear\n\nmisdirection.\n\n10. More importantly, at page 8 of the judgment, the learned Trial Judge stated that he\n\nwould analyze the testimony of PW2 on the premise that she had stated that she saw\n\nthe deceased being attacked by the 3rd accused (the appellant). It is significant to note\n\nthat PW2, in her evidence, never stated that she saw the appellant attacking the\n\ndeceased.\n\n11. It is further evident that the learned Trial Judge proceeded on the premise that PW2\n\nhad witnessed the deceased being attacked with sharp cutting weapons by the 1st to 3rd\n\naccused, despite PW2 never having stated any such fact in her testimony.

Regrettably, the learned Trial Judge appears to have paid little or no attention to the\n\nevidence adduced at the trial, as he has made several glaring errors in the judgment.\n\nHis lack of care is clearly demonstrated by the erroneous statement that the 1st and 2nd\n\naccused had testified at the trial, whereas the 1st accused had died even before the\n\ncommencement of the proceedings.

It is well settled that an alibi once raised, the Court is under a duty to consider it in\n\nlight of the totality of the evidence. The mere absence of formal notice does not, by\n\ntaken by surprise or prejudiced in any manner. The jurisprudence consistently\n\nrecognizes that an alibi must be evaluated alongside all other evidence, and if it raises\n\na reasonable doubt as to the presence of the accused at the scene, the benefit of that\n\ndoubt must be afforded to the accused.\n\n16. In these circumstances, the learned Trial Judge\u2019s refusal to consider the alibi solely on\n\nthe basis of an alleged procedural default constitutes a misdirection in law. Such an\n\napproach undermines the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial and fails to appreciate the\n\nproper legal principles governing the assessment of alibi evidence.\n\n17. It is also notable that the learned Judge, without any evidential foundation, proceeded\n\nto attribute blame to the defence counsel by suggesting that the alibi may have been a\n\ncreation or fabrication on the part of counsel. In my view, this was an entirely\n\nunwarranted and inappropriate remark which ought not to have been made. Such\n\ncomments reflect adversely on the Judge\u2019s attitude towards defence counsel and raise\n\nserious concerns regarding the fairness and impartiality of the trial process.\n\n18. It may also be observed that the learned trial Judge drew an adverse inference against\n\nthe appellant on the basis that he had been evading arrest for six months. Although the\n\nappellant surrendered to court six months after the incident, there was no evidence\n\nwhatsoever to establish that he had been evading arrest during that period.

Many of the conclusions reached by the\n\nlearned Trial Judge are based on speculation rather than on any supporting evidence.\n\nThe contradiction marked as 3D1 reveals that the sole eyewitness, PW2, was unable\n\nto identify the person who was kneeling beside the deceased when she first saw him.\n\nShe further stated that the individual who was mounted on the deceased\u2019s legs was not\n\npresent in court.

At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, the counsel for the appellant\n\ntendered written grounds of appeal. Although several grounds were enumerated\n\ntherein, many are interrelated and may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The judgment of the learned High Court Judge is contrary to section 283 of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure Act;\n\n2. The learned trial Judge has first come to the findings that the PW1 sole eye\n\nwitness is a credible witness before considering the other evidence of the\n\nprosecution and the defense witnesses;\n\n3. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the Government Analyst\n\nReport on ballistic evidence marked as X creates a reasonable doubt on the\n\nprosecution case;\n\n4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of the\n\nsole eye witness contradicts the Government Analyst Report, her evidence is\n\nimprobable and not credible as there exist material contradictions and\n\nomissions. Her evidence contradicts medical evidence and also, she is an\n\ninterested witness; and,\n\n5. The learned trial Judge has failed to call the defense of the accused-appellant\n\nas per Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n5. The sole eyewitness, PW1, is the mother of the deceased. According to her testimony,\n\non the day of the incident she had gone to pick flowers at a land known as\n\nPattanbugodawatta. The deceased had also gone there to play elle. While PW1 was\n\nseated on a log, she observed the deceased approaching the land from a nearby paddy\n\nfield in the company of a friend named Ajith. At that moment, the appellant\n\napproached the deceased from behind, followed by the second and third accused."

A very great South African judge. Curlewis J. A., in the case of R. v. Hepworth, 1928\n\nA.D. 265, 277 once said:\n\n\"A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim the benefit of\n\nany omission or mistake made by the other side. and a judge's position in a\n\ncriminal trial is not merely that of an umpire to see that the rules of the game\n\nare observed by both sides. A judge is an administrator of justice, he is not\n\nmerely a figure head, he has not only to direct and control the proceedings\n\naccording to recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.\"\n\n27. It is also significant to emphasize that this was not an incident that unfolded step by\n\nstep, allowing the witness to observe each stage slowly and carefully. Therefore, it\n\ncannot reasonably be expected of a lay witness of PW1\u2019s calibre to precisely state the\n\nnumber of shots fired at the deceased based solely on the sound of gunfire,\n\nparticularly given that the shots were fired in rapid succession.\n\n28. In these circumstances, the inconsistency in PW1\u2019s evidence regarding the number of\n\nshots fired cannot, in my view, be regarded as a material contradiction that\n\nundermines the credibility of PW1.\n\n29. Another argument advanced by the appellant is that the Government Analyst\u2019s Report,\n\nmarked as \u2018X\u2019 by the defence, contradicts the evidence of PW1 and establishes that\n\nthe empty cartridges recovered from the scene of the murder were not discharged\n\nCA/HCC/0229/2018\n\n9 | P a g e\n\nfrom the pistol marked as P3.

It appears that the\n\nprosecution had made an application to cross-examine PW2 in terms of Section 154\n\nof the Evidence Ordinance, as he was evasive during his testimony.

However, in the present case, PW2 was remanded only after his testimony had been\n\nfully concluded. Moreover, no lay witness was called to testify thereafter. Therefore,\n\neven if the learned Trial Judge\u2019s decision to remand PW2 could be considered an\n\nabuse of power, it has neither instilled fear in any witness nor denied the appellant a\n\nfair trial."

Furthermore, the learned Trial Judge has considered the dock statement but\n\na nearby thicket after the incident and was arrested on the following day. In fact,\n\nduring cross-examination, the appellant specifically disputed the prosecution\u2019s version\n\nof his arrest. In any event, it is impossible to infer that any reasonable judge could\n\nhave reached a different conclusion regarding the appellant\u2019s guilt, even if the\n\nevidence had been analyzed in greater detail.\n\n49. Therefore, it is my considered view that, despite the presence of some minor\n\ncontradictions and omissions, the prosecution\u2019s evidence, when considered in its\n\nentirety, is sufficient to safely secure the conviction of the appellant, notwithstanding\n\nthe appellant\u2019s submission that the prosecution failed to prove the charge beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\nCA/HCC/0229/2018\n\n14 | P a g e\n\n50.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Appellant has preferred the\n\ninstant appeal.\n\n4. The grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant are as follows:\n\n1. The learned trial Judge failed to exercise his judicial mind in determining\n\nwhether the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n2. The learned trial Judge failed to properly analyze and give legal consideration\n\nto the inherently improbable and contradictory evidence of the prosecution\n\nwitness.\n\n3. The learned trial Judge failed to adequately assess the unreliable and\n\nimprobable evidence pertaining to the seizer and sealing of production and\n\nprocedural irregularities followed by the prosecution which undermined the\n\nintegrity of the chain of custody and cast serious doubt on the safety of the\n\nconviction.\n\n4.

They entered the Appellant\u2019s house and found the Appellant seated in the living room.\n\nAs instructed by PW1, PW7 took the Appellant into a room inside the house and\n\nCA/HCC/0119/2025\n\n4 | P a g e\n\nconducted a physical search, during which she recovered a parcel from the right-side\n\npocket of the frock worn by the Appellant. PW7 thereafter handed the parcel over to\n\nPW1, who sealed the production.\n\n7. It is noteworthy that when questioned, PW7 was unable to recollect whether any other\n\npersons were present at the Appellant\u2019s house at the time of the raid. It is also\n\nimportant to note that in her evidence-in-chief, PW7 stated that the police vehicle had\n\nstopped right in front of the Appellant\u2019s house. However, during cross-examination,\n\nwhen questioned about the width of the road where the Appellant\u2019s house is situated,\n\nthe witness admitted that it was a narrow lane. It was further suggested to the witness\n\nthat the width of the road leading to the Appellant\u2019s house was only two feet, but the\n\nwitness failed to answer the question.\n\n8. Thereafter, the witness admitted that the police vehicle had not stopped in front of the\n\nAppellant\u2019s house, as stated in her evidence-in-chief, but rather at the entrance of the\n\nroad leading to the Appellant\u2019s residence. One of the most improbable aspects of\n\nPW7\u2019s evidence, as observed by this Court, is her assertion that the Appellant had\n\nkept a heroin parcel in the front pocket of her frock until the police party arrived at\n\nher residence and searched her. Hence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept that a\n\nperson would have kept a small parcel of heroin in the pocket of her frock while\n\nremaining inside, waiting for the police to arrive and arrest her."

Another\n\nunusual aspect is that this witness certified the lead officer\u2019s notes, which is not the\n\nstandard practice.\n\n10.

Although PW1 stated that he had searched the vehicle and the officers prior to setting off\n\non the routine duty, no notes were made in that regard. PW1 in fact admitted that such a\n\nsearch constituted an important part of the raid.\n\n11. The failure to record this essential procedural step is a serious lapse, as the pre-search of\n\nofficers and the vehicle is a safeguard designed to eliminate the possibility of subsequent\n\nfabrication or planting of illicit substances.\n\n12. Courts have repeatedly underscored the importance of documenting each stage of\n\ndetection, particularly in narcotics cases where strict scrutiny is required due to the severe\n\npenalties involved. The omission to make contemporaneous notes not only reflects non-\n\ncompliance with established procedure but also weakens the reliability of the\n\nprosecution\u2019s version.\n\n13. Next, I shall consider the evidence of T.B. Dayarathne (PW2). According to his testimony,\n\nhe was the officer who accompanied PW1 to Andrewge Watta and effected the arrest of\n\nthe Appellant.

Yet, they had not\n\ntrafficker would keep part of his contraband at his residence.\n\n15. These infirmities in PW2\u2019s evidence certainly cast doubt on the alleged arrest of the\n\nAppellant. More importantly, PW2 himself admitted that most of the events about which\n\nhe failed to maintain notes were of great importance. If that was so, he ought to have\n\nprovided a reasonable explanation for his failure to record those matters.\n\n16. The next ground of appeal, which is most critical to the sustainability of the conviction,\n\nconcerns the manner in which the learned Trial Judge analyzed and evaluated the\n\nevidence presented by both parties, as well as his observations regarding the burden of\n\nproof placed on the defense.\n\n17. It is discernible from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge first evaluated the\n\nevidence of the prosecution witnesses and concluded that such evidence was sufficient to\n\nestablish the charge against the Appellant. Only thereafter did he proceed to evaluate the\n\ndefense evidence. In my view, this approach is erroneous in law, particularly in light of\n\nthe legal principles enunciated in James Silva v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1980] (2)\n\nSri.L.R.167\n\n18. It is trite law that the duty of a trial Judge is to consider all the evidence placed before the\n\nCourt, whether by the prosecution or by the defense, as a whole, and to arrive at his\n\nfindings accordingly, rather than compartmentalizing the evidence as was done in the\n\nimpugned judgment.\n\n19.

The law pertaining to the evidentiary value of a dock statement, the proper manner of its\n\narticulated in several authoritative decisions.\n\nCA/HCC/0138/2019\n\n7 | P a g e\n\n25. In Kathubdeen vs Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] (3) Sri L.R.107, it was observed:\n\nIt is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as evidence. It has\n\nalso been laid down that if the unsworn statement creates a reasonable doubt\n\nin the prosecution case or if it is believed, then the accused should be given\n\nthe benefit of that doubt.\n\n26. In Gunasiri and two others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SRI.L.R 39 it was held\n\nthat:\n\nIn evaluating a dock statement, the trial Judge must consider the following\n\nprinciples: (1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon. (2) If the\n\ndock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the defence\n\nmust succeed.\n\n27. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the dock statement, and in\n\nparticular, the imposition of a burden on the Appellant to prove it, is wholly contrary to\n\naccepted legal principles. The burden of proving a criminal charge always rests on the\n\nprosecution, and the defense is never required to prove a negative. The defense is only\n\nrequired to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In the present case, the\n\nevidence adduced by the prosecution does not discharge the burden of proving the case\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. The dock statement made by the Appellant was rejected by the\n\nlearned Trial Judge on an erroneous premise, in direct contravention of the established\n\nprinciples of law.\n\n28. In Pantis v. The Attorney General - (1998) 2 Sri L.R.148, it was held that \u201cThe burden of\n\nproof is always on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and no such\n\nduty is cast on the accused and it is sufficient for the accused to give an explanation"

These sentences were ordered to run\n\nconsecutively.\n\nCA/HCC/0217/2024\n\n3 | P a g e\n\n3. The learned Counsel for the appellant, at the hearing, confined his submissions solely\n\nto the question of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.\n\nAccordingly, the sole question for determination in this appeal is whether the sentence\n\nimposed on the appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle is excessive in\n\nthe circumstances of the case.\n\nBackground to the appeal:\n\n4. The victim was 16 years old at the time of the offence. On the day of the incident, he\n\nwas waiting at an isolated spot near a canal, having avoided a tuition class scheduled\n\nfor that day. It was at this point that the appellant approached him and assaulted him.\n\n5. Thereafter, the appellant asked the victim to remove his clothes and proceeded to\n\nsexually assault him by inserting his penis into the victim\u2019s anus. The appellant also\n\ncompelled the victim to perform oral sex on him, which the victim did out of fear.\n\n6. Subsequently, the appellant took Rs. 2,500 from the victim\u2019s purse and threatened to\n\nhand him over to the police. The appellant falsely represented himself as a police\n\nofficer. After the incident, the victim walked toward the town. On his way, a person in\n\na vehicle stopped and asked him why he was wet and why his clothes were muddy.\n\nThe victim then began to cry. This person took the victim to a nearby boutique and,\n\nultimately, he was handed over to his parents.\n\n7. It can be observed that, following the conviction, both the prosecution and the defence\n\nmade submissions regarding the appropriate sentence. The learned High Court Judge\n\ncarefully considered the submissions made by both parties before imposing the\n\nsentence."

The learned High Court Judge\n\ncarefully considered the submissions made by both parties before imposing the\n\nsentence.\n\nold at the time of the offence. In determining the appropriateness of the sentence for\n\noffences of this nature, the Court must consider several factors, including the age of\n\nthe victim, the age of the appellant, the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim,\n\nthe degree of violence used, the need for deterrence in society, and the past conduct of\n\nthe appellant.\n\nCA/HCC/0217/2024\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n9. Usually, courts regard the young age of an offender as a mitigating factor in the\n\nsentencing process. However, the young age of the victim cannot, by itself, be treated\n\nas a mitigating consideration when dealing with an offence of this nature. If an\n\noffender, due to youthfulness, is genuinely unable to comprehend the gravity or\n\nconsequences of the act, such immaturity may be considered in mitigation, provided\n\nthat no aggravating circumstances exist.\n\n10. In the present case, after five witnesses had testified for the prosecution, the appellant\n\nwithdrew his earlier plea and pleaded guilty to both charges. Apart from the young\n\nage of the appellant, no other mitigating factor was advanced by learned counsel\n\nduring submissions before the High Court. It must also be noted that the victim was\n\nhimself a young boy, and the offence was committed after the appellant instilled fear\n\nin him by threatening to hand him over to the police. The victim was alone and in an\n\nisolated location at the time the offence was committed.\n\n11. Culpability will be increased where an offender deliberately targets a victim due to an\n\nactual or perceived vulnerability. Likewise, culpability is further aggravated where the\n\nvictim\u2019s vulnerability is created or exacerbated by the offender\u2019s own actions."

Furthermore, it is necessary to accentuate that sexual violence victims often\n\nexperience a deep sense of shame, stigma and violation. Given the fact that sexual\n\nviolence is a degrading, humiliating and brutal invasion of the security of the person,\n\na victim is most often left with psychological injuries that are far more serious and\n\ndifficult to detect than physical injuries.\n\n19. Furthermore, it is worthy to note that crimes of this nature are on the rise, and the\n\nLegislature, in its wisdom, has prescribed stringent sentences in order to ensure\n\ndeterrence, particularly with a view to protecting children. Harsh sentences aim to\n\ndeter potential offenders and also prevent the convicted offender from reoffending.\n\nHence, society\u2019s interest in preventing harm to children justifies adopting a\n\ndeterrence-based sentence approach.\n\n20. In assessing the severity of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge, it\n\nis necessary to consider the gravity of the offences committed. In the present case, the\n\nappellant not only subjected the victim to repeated acts of grave sexual abuse but also\n\ninflicted physical violence upon him. As set out in the Medico-Legal Report, the\n\nvictim sustained a ruptured eardrum, demonstrating the degree of force used during\n\nthe commission of the offences. Moreover, the presence of bleeding and tears in the\n\nanal region further illustrates the brutality and inhumanity of the appellant\u2019s conduct.\n\n21.

Abeysinghe (Supra).\n\nHence, it clearly, appears that the Petitioner\u2019s placing heavy reliance on the\n\ndecision in Alwis Vs. Wedamulla, Additional Director General U.D.A.(Supra)\n\nin support of his contention as so advanced, was due to his total and/or complete\n\nignorance of the fact that the decision which he so heavily, relied on, had\n\nsubsequently, been set aside by the Supreme Court sitting in appeal in the\n\ndecision in Wedamulla Vs. Abeysinghe(Supra).\n\nI would therefore, hold that the contention so advanced by the learned\n\nPresident\u2019s Counsel for the Petitioner as enumerated above, cannot in any\n\nmanner, sustain both in fact and law and as such, it should be rejected in-limine,\n\nand the instant application in revision is therefore, dismissed in-limine.\n\nIn the light of the above, I would find myself unable to agree with the next\n\ncontention so advanced by the learned Counsel for the Appellant for; it cannot\n\nsustain in law and as such it ought to be rejected in-limine.\n\nA further reason for the above conclusion is manifest on a careful examination\n\nof the said provisions of the Act and the judicial precedents referred to above. It\n\nmay now, be examined.\n\nIn view of sections 9 (1) and 9(2) of the Act, the person who has been summoned\n\nis not entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under\n\nsection 5 of the Act and one of such matters to be stated in the application made\n\nunder Section 5 of the Act is that the person making the application is a\n\nCompetent Authority for the purposes of the Act.\n\nBesides, the Respondent had in his affidavit filed along with his application"

In any event, for this Court to exercise\n\nrevisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have occasioned a failure of\n\njustice and be manifestly erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or\n\nirregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it. In other words\n\nthe order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the\n\nconscience of Court.\u201d\n\nIn Thilagaratnam Vs. E.A.P.

Evidence of the defence was rejected by the Learned High Court Judge\n\nBackground of the case\n\nAccording to PW1, SI/Ruwan Kumara, the raid was conducted upon an\n\ninformation received by PC 73163 Dinesh who is attached to the Police\n\nNarcotics Bureau. Although this information was communicated to PW1, he\n\nhad not noted down such information in his note book. Instead, the\n\ninformation was noted down by PC 73163 Dinesh, however, he was not\n\nnamed in the list of witnesses in the indictment. As such, the Learned\n\nCounsel who represented the Appellant at the trial court had objected to\n\nleading the evidence pertaining to receiving the information, on the basis of\n\nhearsay evidence. After considering the submissions of both parties, the\n\nlearned trial judge had disallowed the objection and permitted the\n\nprosecution to lead the evidence.\n\nAccording to the information, a person called Nalinda, was expected to traffic\n\nheroin from \u2018Kotahena Watta\u2019 to Sugathadasa Stadium. The informer had\n\nfurther said that he could meet the police officers at a place called\n\n\u2018Galpalliya\u2019. A police team was organised, excluding the police officer who\n\nhad initially received the information. At 8.30 hours the police team had met\n\nthe informant at the said place. After obtaining further information, PW1 and\n\nPW2 had hired a three-wheeler and gone to inspect the place from where the\n\nAppellant was supposed to come from. The informer had accompanied them\n\nas well. After ascertaining the \u2018Watta\u2019 the police officers had waited close to\n\na temple called \u2018Sumithrarama\u2019 and the informant had gone to the \u2018Watta\u2019 to\n\nprovide further information to the police. While waiting, PW1 had received a\n\nphone call from the informant that the Appellant is ready to come with one\n\nof his relations.

Accordingly, in this context,\n\nthe phrase \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\" indicates that the evidence and\n\narguments brought forward by the prosecution to establish the defendant\u2019s\n\nguilt must be done so clearly, in a manner that it is accepted as fact by any\n\nrational person.\n\nIn the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V.

If not, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of the\n\ncharges. The prosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot\n\nderive any strength from the weaknesses in the defence, and when the\n\nguilt of the accused is not established beyond reasonable doubt, he is\n\nliable to be acquitted as a matter of right and not as a matter of grace or\n\nfavour.\u201d"

V. State of M.P., AIR [2007] SCW 5589\n\n(2007) 7 SCC 625, it was observed:\n\n\u201cIt is well-settled that credibility of witness has to be tested on the\n\ntouchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite possible that\n\nin a given case, a Court of Law may not base conviction solely on the\n\nevidence of Complainant or a Police Official but it is not the law that\n\npolice witnesses should not be relied upon and their evidence cannot be\n\naccepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars by other\n\nindependent evidence. The presumption that every person acts honestly\n\napplies as much in favour of a Police Official as any other person. No\n\ninfirmity attaches to the testimony of Police Officials merely because\n\nthey belong to Police Force. There is no rule of law which lays down that\n\nno conviction can be recorded on the testimony of Police Officials even if\n\nsuch evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy. The rule of\n\nprudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the\n\nCourt is convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of\n\ntruth, conviction can be based on such evidence\u201d.\n\nIn Attorney General v. Devunderage Nihal [2011] 1 SLR 409 the court held\n\nthat:\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement in law that a particular number of witnesses\n\nshall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. Unlike in a case\n\nwhere an accomplice or a decoy is concerned, in any other case there is\n\nno requirement in law that the evidence of a Police Officer who\n\nconducted an investigation or raid resulting in the arrest of an offender\n\nneed to be corroborated on material particulars.\n\nHowever, caution must be exercised by a trial Judge in evaluating such"

This has further\n\nstrengthened the defence as the raiding team had not searched the house of\n\nthe Appellant.\n\nAlong with the probable cause for an arrest, the place of arrest must also be\n\nclearly established by law enforcement.

The purpose and the object\n\nseem to be quite clear that there should be fairness in investigation,\n\ninvestigation.\u201d\n\nIn cases such as this, the principal source of all information which would\n\nbecome evidence in the criminal prosecution would be the police. Therefore,\n\nas the investigative arm of the state, the police bear the primary and\n\nmandatory responsibility to acquire such evidence as accurately as possible,\n\nwithout any contradictions.\n\nThe learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the evidence given by\n\nPW1 and PW2 contradict each other on material points regarding the place\n\nof arrest. According to PW1, the Appellant and the other person were arrested\n\nnear \u2018Sumithrarama Temple\u2019 when they came to a \u2018Watta\u2019. According to PW2,\n\nthe Appellant was arrested while the duo was coming from \u2018Sumithrarama\n\nWatta\u2019. According to the original information, the Appellant was supposed to\n\nhave come from \u2018Kotahena Watta\u2019.\n\nNext, the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that PW1 and PW2\n\nalso contradicted each other regarding the existence of a three-way junction\n\nnear the temple. PW1 in his evidence told the Court that he has no knowledge\n\nabout the three-way junction. PW2 in his evidence stated that the road that\n\nleads to \u2018Watta\u2019 was situated when proceeding straight, after passing the\n\ntemple.\n\nConsidering these contradictory positions taken by PW1 and PW2 regarding\n\nthe place of arrest, the outcome of the case will most definitely be affected.\n\nLegal provisions and various judicial precedents have made it clear that\n\nomissions and contradictions are one of the ways to shake the credibility of\n\nCA/HCC/0005/20222\n\n11 | P a g e\n\na witness.

By omitting to evaluate the absence of conclusive medical corroboration, the\n\nHon. High Court Judge erred in law and misdirected himself on a material\n\naspect of the case.\n\niv. The Hon. High Court Judge erred by failing to consider the wider context of\n\nfamily conflict and prolonged institutional care, which could have influenced\n\nthe testimony and credibility of PW1, leading to miscarriage of justice.\n\nv. The Hon. High Court Judge erred in failing to consider the need for\n\ncorroboration of the child's testimony, especially given the inconsistencies and\n\nsurrounding circumstances that warranted such caution.\n\nvi. The Hon. High Court Judge erred in rejecting the dock statement solely for\n\nlack of prior cross-examination, without assessing its independent probative\n\nvalue.\n\nvii.

Further, the witness stated that such an incident had occurred in 2013, with the\n\nlast incident taking place in 2014.

At that time, according to\n\nthe witness, the Appellant sent her younger sister to the woman with whom he was\n\nallegedly having an extramarital affair, who had just moved to their neighbourhood. It is\n\nnoted that this incident occurred prior to the matter being reported to the police.\n\nThe witness has described another incident that occurred 2 days prior to the last incident.\n\nAccording to her testimony, while she was asleep, the Appellant removed her clothing.\n\nPage 58 of the brief,"

She stated that she had agreed to make the payments in order to continue\n\nPW 3, who thereafter reported the incident to the Bribery Commission.\n\nDuring cross\u2011examination, PW 2 admitted that when she accompanied PW 1 to the\n\nAppellant\u2019s office, she was unable to hear the conversation that took place between PW 1\n\nand the Appellant.\n\nPW 3, Ajith Kumara, an officer of the Bribery Commission, together with SI Livera\n\nDuglas Perera, PW 4, received information regarding the Appellant\u2019s demand and\n\nproceeded to conduct the raid. He further stated that several other officers accompanied\n\nhim and assisted in carrying out the raid. Upon reaching the location, the officers recorded\n\na statement from PW 1, thereby formally documenting his account before proceeding with\n\nthe raid.\n\nPW 3 further stated that he accompanied PW 1 as a decoy during the raid.

At that time, the appellant went to the rear side of the\n\nhouse and attempted to run, but the witness pursued and arrested him. Subsequently,\n\nAfter the prosecution concluded, the appellant testified that he had long known PW1, who\n\nis disabled. He stated that he had helped PW1 obtain artificial limbs without expecting\n\nany benefit. Upon learning of a government donation scheme to assist disabled persons in\n\nbuilding houses, the appellant informed PW1 and recommended his name to the\n\nDivisional Secretariat. Once PW1\u2019s eligibility was confirmed by the Secretariat, the\n\nappellant conveyed the information to PW1 and provided the necessary instructions.\n\nBecause PW1 could not read or write, the appellant prepared a letter in format for\n\nsubmission to the Divisional Secretariat. On Monday, PW1, accompanied by another\n\nperson, brought the letter to the appellant\u2019s office and handed it over before leaving.\n\nShortly afterwards, the appellant went to his tea estate, where a group of officers arrived\n\nand arrested him.\n\nAfter being arrested by bribery officers and taken to his office, the appellant was\n\nquestioned about the money that was recovered from the documents. He denied any\n\nknowledge of it, stating that he had never received money from PW1 and suggesting that\n\nPW1 may have secretly placed it there. The appellant further claimed that PW5 had a\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\npersonal dispute with him and had deliberately made a false complaint to implicate him\n\nin a crime.\n\nWe note that according to PW 1, the money was kept under a black bag. However, the\n\nAppellant contends that the money was actually recovered from his documents. The\n\nquestion that arises is whether, when the Appellant was present, it was probable for PW1\n\nto conceal the money in the said room without his knowledge. This inconsistency casts\n\ndoubt on the reliability of the testimony."

This inconsistency casts\n\ndoubt on the reliability of the testimony.\n\nthe testimonies of PW1 and PW3. It is true that such a discrepancy exists: PW1 stated\n\nthat after handing over the money, he went to the police, whereas PW3 testified that he\n\nsaw PW1 standing near the gate. It must be noted, however, that PW1 was the\n\ncomplainant, while PW3 was the officer involved in the raid, and each had different roles.\n\nPW1, after handing over the money, left the scene, while PW3 informed PW4 about the\n\nmatter. Thus, both witnesses were engaged in different tasks.\n\nI am mindful of the following judgments.\n\nVeerasamy Sivathasan v.

Further, it is quite possible that IP\n\nWelagedera did not see the exact manner in which WSI Gamage conducted herself,\n\nparticularly as he would have been concentrating on relieving himself from the\n\ngrip of the 1st Accused and on preventing the 1st Accused from evading arrest and\n\nfleeing from the scene along with the polysack bag. When \u2018participant-witnesses\u2019\n\nas opposed to \u2018passive-observer-witnesses\u2019 give evidence regarding an incident that\n\noccurred quite suddenly, it is not humanly possible for their testimonies to mirror\n\neach other.\u201d\n\nSamaraweera V. The Attorney General 1990 (1) SLR, 256 at page 260, P.R.D. Perera, J,\n\nheld that\n\n\u201cWhere however the maxim set out above is applicable it must be borne in mind\n\nthat all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of\n\nskill in observation upon any point or points, exaggeration or mere embroidery or\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\nembellishment must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood.

On the other hand, PW3 testified that he heard both the witness and\n\nthe appellant speaking. It is noted that PW2 is an elderly lady. However, the fact remains\n\nthat PW1\u2019s evidence that the appellant made a demand was not disputed by the defence.\n\nIt is also significant that the letter was recovered from the appellant\u2019s office. Considering\n\nthe defence evidence, there appears to be no reason for the appellant to have fled from the\n\noffice. Accordingly, the Learned High Court Judge correctly came to the conclusion that\n\nthe Appellant solicited the money from PW 1 and accepted by the Appellant.\n\nWe believe that the Appellant\u2019s conduct, running from the house and locking the front\n\ndoor, establishes the fact that PW1\u2019s version that he placed the money on the table and\n\nhow the raid was conducted.\n\nWe hold that the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant has\n\nsolicited and accepted a bribe from one Abhabinna Arachchige Anura Bandara Abesinghe.\n\nIn those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the judgment of the Learned\n\nHigh Court Judge dated 24.01.2019, together with the sentencing order and dismiss the\n\nappeal.\n\nThe Appeal is dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"
