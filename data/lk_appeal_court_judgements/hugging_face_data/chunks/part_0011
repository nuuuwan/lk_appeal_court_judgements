019s mother was the original 6th Defendant in the lower court case and as admitted that she had not contested the pedigree of the Plaintiff Respondent. Until the death of the original 6th Defendant, the interlocutory decree and final decree was never challenged. 14] On careful perusal, this court sees that (X1), that 10, 11, 12 Defendants have fled notices of appeal to the interlocutory judgment. It is unclear what would happen to this appeal. Whatever, if the 10, 11, 12 Defendants could file an appeal in a timely manner, this court cannot see why the 6th Original Defendant cannot file an appeal to the said judgment. The main principle is that Law assists the wakeful, not the sleepy (Latin legal maxim Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt ). 15] In Gunasekara and another v Abdul Lathief [1995] 1SLR 225, at p235, Ranaraja J, states that laches itself means slackness or negligence or neglect to do something which by law a man is obliged to do. It also means that there is an unreasonable delay in pursuing a legal remedy there by a party forfeits the benefit upon the principle vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt.\n\n14\n\n\u201cIndeed, the Dhammapada, Appamada Vagga, 26, says:\n\n\"Pamadamanuyunjanti bala dummedhinho jana Appamadam ca medhavii dhananam settham'va rakkhati.\" (Fools, men of little intelligence, give themselves over to negligence, but the wise man protects his diligence as a supreme treasure. . .)

It was also said :\n\n\u201cLaches means negligence or unreasonable delay in asserting or enforcing a right. There are two equitable principles which come into play when a statute refers to a party being guilty of laches. The first doctrine is delay defeats equities. The second is that equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent\u201d 18] Thus, we cannot accept the inordinate delay and the reason explained by the 6th Added Petitioner. Moreover, there was a right of appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kalutara, as some Defendants agitated above, the Restitutio-in-Integrum cannot be sought. 19] In Perera v. Wijewickreme 15 NLR 411. His Lordship Pereira J. held;\n\n15\n\n\u201cIt was not granted unless no other remedy was available to the applicant or unless restitution was the more effectual remedy\u201d 20] In Menchinahamy v. Muniweera 52 NLR 409 his Lordship Dias J. held;\n\n\u201cRestitutio in integrum is not available if the petitioner has another remedy open to her.\u201d 21] As the original Petitioner being the 6th Defendant, she should have sought her statutory remedy if the corpus is identified or lager land is not showed. Further, if the learned trial judge failed to comply section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, it also can be challenged in the appellate forum. I stressed if there is a statutory right of appeal that the Defendant ought to have exercised, and her negligence cannot be condoned by way of restitution which causes grave injustice to other parties.\n\n22] In the above circumstances, we see no merit in this application. Thus, the\n\napplication is dismissed with costs.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nR. GURUSINGHE J.\n\nI agree\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

Thus, without any preceding issues, the appellant\u2019s actions cannot be\n\njustified by the notion of a sudden fight. The legal framework stipulates\n\ncompelling evidence of \u201cheat of passion without premeditation arising\n\nout of sudden altercation\u201d that precipitated the escalation into violence.\n\n17. In this instance, the lacking of any altercation negates the possibility of\n\nthe appellant invoking this exception.\n\n18. The Counsel for the appellant has also drawn the attention of the Court\n\nto the discrepancies of the evidence in the testimony of PW01 in regard\n\nto the description of the wooden pole allegedly used by the appellant to\n\nassault the deceased, the manner in which it was brought to the\n\npossession of the investigation officers and the probability of the same\n\nlying at the scene of the crime until it was discovered.\n\n19. PW01 has been called to testify in court almost eight years after the\n\nincident. Such a lengthy interval almost inevitably dulls a witness\u2019s\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\nrecollection especially of peripheral or technical details. In particular,\n\nPW01 now may struggle to recall the precise weapon that was used in\n\nthe attack, its size, shape, colour or distinguishing marks.\n\n20. Similarly, he maybe be uncertain about the circumstances in which the\n\npolice eventually discovered or seized that weapon. Natural memory\n\ndecay can therefore lead to inconsistencies or discrepancies between\n\nPW01\u2019s testimony and the testimony of an investigating officer as\n\nregards to the shape, size of the weapon used in an attack. These\n\ncontradictions do not necessarily mean that PW01 is dishonest; rather,\n\nthey reflect the fallibility of human memory over time.\n\n21. PW07, Inspector of Police Balasooriya has visited the scene of the crime\n\nthe next morning; January 02, 2010 at about 8.35 hours. The area had\n\nbeen deserted, no crowd had gathered at the scene before his arrival\n\nand nothing had suggested that the scene had been tampered with."

    "chunk_text": "the next morning; January 02, 2010 at about 8.35 hours. The area had\n\nbeen deserted, no crowd had gathered at the scene before his arrival\n\nand nothing had suggested that the scene had been tampered with.\n\nSeveral blood stains had been present on the ground and PW07 has\n\ncollected samples of each stain with cotton swabs. However, no weapon\n\nhas been recovered from the scene in that instance.\n\n22. This is consistent with the fact that PW01 had picked up the wooden\n\npole that had been lying at the scene, taken it into the Pettah Police\n\nStation on January 02, 2010, and later given a second statement about\n\nthe incident involving the deceased and the appellant prior to PW07\n\nproceeding to the scene of the incident to conduct investigations there.\n\n23. The learned High Court Judge has undertaken a holistic assessment of\n\nthe appellant\u2019s testimony in the context of the entire testimony\n\nincluding the prosecution witnesses and documentary material. This\n\nassessment has revealed inconsistencies in the appellant\u2019s account on\n\nmaterial particulars, such as how an animosity among the appellant\n\nand PW01 had purportedly developed, which has a direct bearing on\n\nthe core issue of the testimony of the appellant. The learned High Court\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\nJudge has found that these discrepancies were not minor but\n\ncontradictions that go to the root of the defence.\n\n24. The learned High Court Judge has further noted inherent\n\nimprobabilities in the appellant\u2019s narrative when tested against\n\nordinary human conduct and the factual, verifiable evidence on record.\n\nThat the appellant\u2019s testimony appeared to be an afterthought. That\n\ntaken together the discrepancies and the improbabilities undermined\n\nthe credibility of the appellant\u2019s version. Accordingly, the learned High\n\nCourt Judge has declined to place reliance on the appellant\u2019s testimony\n\nand has rejected it.\n\n25. Due to the matters discussed above, I am not inclined to interfere with\n\nthe conviction, the disputed judgment together with the sentencing\n\norder."

The Order made under Section 27A(4) by Gazette A4 states as follows:\n\n\u201c1975 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 39, 1981 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 14, 1981 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 39, 1986 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 14 \u0dc3\u0dc4 1986 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 16 \u0daf\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0db4\u0db1\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc1 \u0ddd\u0db0\u0dd2\u0dad 1972 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 1 \u0daf\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0d89\u0da9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc3\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dab \u0db1\u0dd3\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dda 27\u0d85(4) \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dcf \u0dc1\u0dc0\u0dad \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0db6\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dbd \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb, \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dca\u200d\u0dba \u0db4\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0db1, \u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dc1\u0dda \u0d9a\u0da7\u0dba\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dd4, \u0dc0\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0db8\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dba \u0dbb\u0dad\u0dca\u0db1\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0db8\u0db1\u0dcf\u0dd9\u0d9a \u0dc0\u0db1 \u0db8\u0db8, \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dd3 \u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc1 \u0ddd\u0db0\u0dd2\u0dad \u0d89\u0da9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc3\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dab \u0db1\u0dd3\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dda \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc1\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dcf\u0daf\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0da7 \u0d85\u0db1\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd6\u0dbd\u0dc0 1972 \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9a 11 \u0daf\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dca\u200d\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dd8\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0db8\u0db8\u0d9a \u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dae\u0dcf \u0db4\u0db1\u0dad \u0dd9\u0da7\u0dc1\u0dad\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0daf \u0da2\u0dca\u200d\u0db1\u0dad\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db8\u0db1 \u0db8\u0dab\u0dca\u0da9\u0dbd\u0dd9\u0da7 \u0dc1\u0db8\u0dc4\u0dd2 1\u0dc0\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0d8b\u0db4\u0dc1\u0dda\u0d9b\u0db1\u0dc1\u0dda \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc1\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0d89\u0da9\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dcf \u0dc1\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf\n\nPage 7 of 15"

However, the court could give effect to such cancellation only after consideration of the circumstances of each case. Conduct and Undue Delay\n\nThe Respondents state that since the Petitioner did not object to the re-vesting of a portion of land by Order (A4) in 1996, the Petitioner is estopped from challenging it under the instant application. However, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked in an instant where a public authority acted ultra vires. Professor Wade views that \u201cin public law the most obvious limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is that it cannot be invoked so as to give an authority powers which it does not in law possess. In other words, no estoppel can legitimate action which is ultra vires\u201d [H.W.R. Wade and C.F.F. Forsyth in \u2018Administrative Law - eleventh edition @ page 197 ]. In the case in hand, the Court has come to a conclusion that since the revesting Order published in the Gazette marked A4 is ultra vires and bad in law, the defence taken up by the Respondents in relation to estoppel cannot stand."

    "chunk_text": "The Respondents state that since the Petitioner did not object to the re-vesting of a portion of land by Order (A4) in 1996, the Petitioner is estopped from challenging it under the instant application. However, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked in an instant where a public authority acted ultra vires. Professor Wade views that \u201cin public law the most obvious limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is that it cannot be invoked so as to give an authority powers which it does not in law possess. In other words, no estoppel can legitimate action which is ultra vires\u201d [H.W.R. Wade and C.F.F. Forsyth in \u2018Administrative Law - eleventh edition @ page 197 ]. In the case in hand, the Court has come to a conclusion that since the revesting Order published in the Gazette marked A4 is ultra vires and bad in law, the defence taken up by the Respondents in relation to estoppel cannot stand.\n\nNevertheless, delay alone shall not prevent a person from receiving the relief to which they may be entitled. It has to be decided upon the facts of\n\nPage 12 of 15\n\neach particular case. The Petitioner submits that delay would not defeat the application of the Petitioner as the purported re-vesting Order is ultra vires. In Biso Menika v Cyril de Alwis and others [1982] 1 SLR 368, it was held that,\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied that the Order complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction, the Court would be loath to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such event, the explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically\u2026\u201d"

This approach has been followed in a number of decisions by the Court of Appeal. However, some decisions had followed what could be termed as the Restrictive approach on the ground that the Provincial High Court and Court of Appeal rank equally when exercising appellate and Revisionary powers and that concurrency does not generate hierarchy.\n\nIn the resent case of W.T.S. Nilantha Fernando v. P.M.S. Nilanthi Perera2, His Lordship Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena has rejected this reasoning of Gunawardane3 holding where a Provincial High Court has acted in excise of its appellate jurisdiction (as\n\n1 SC Appeal No. 111-2015 with SC Appeal Nos. 113-2015 & 114-2015, SCM 27.05.2020 2 SC Appeal No. 65-2025 SCM 10.10.2025 3 supra\n\n5\n\nin this instant case), the Court of Appeal cannot exercise revisionary jurisdiction against such order or judgement.\n\nIn Seylan Bank PLC v. Christobel Daniels4, as quoted by His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena, in W.T.S. Nilantha Fernando v. P.M.S. Nilanthi Perera5, it is stated that;"

According to PW1, upon seeing the four police officers who were in civil attire,\n\ndistress, put his hand into the pocket in his trouser.

It was also stated that the\n\nAppellant started to walk towards Summitpura C Lane when the police officers were\n\nto run away.\n\n9. It is my opinion that if the Appellant was a seasoned criminal who was into drug\n\ntrafficking business, it is very likely that he would be on alert as to what is happening\n\naround, for they are aware of the disastrous consequences that they might have to face, if\n\nget caught by the law enforcement officers. In fact, it was stated by the PW1 that although\n\nthe police officers were in civil attire, the Appellant, nevertheless, appeared to have\n\nrecognized them which made him panic. Therefore, version of PW1 and PW2 that the\n\nAppellant did not make any attempt to escape even after noticing the presence of the\n\npolice officers and instead put his right hand into the pocket of his trouser thereby making\n\nit more obvious to the police officers that he was concealing something seems highly\n\nimprobable.\n\nCA/HCC/0175/2024\n\n5 | P a g e\n\n10. Moreover, the evidence of PW2 indicates that the appellant was known to them prior to\n\nthe arrest.

Further, according to PW2, the\n\nappellant was taken to the Modera Police Station by a three-wheeler, yet not even the\n\nregistration number of the three-wheeler has been noted. This omission further casts\n\ndoubt on the credibility and probability of the prosecution\u2019s version of the arrest.\n\n11. Furthermore, when testifying PW1 stated that he has conducted nearly 300 raids,\n\nindicating that he is a seasoned officer with substantial experience in handling drug-\n\nrelated cases.

Moreover, it is important to note that, PW1 never made any note explaining the reason as\n\nto why he failed to examine the identity card or inspect the residence of the Appellant.

Another critical piece of information that this Court should not lightly disregard is the\n\ninability of PW2 to identify the productions at the trial before the High Court.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 it was held that;\n\n\u201cIn considering the question as to whether evidence given by the witness should be\n\naccepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine whether the witness is, an\n\ninterested witness and to enquire whether the story deposed to by him is probable and\n\nwhether it has been shaken in cross-examination. That is whether there is a ring of\n\ntruth surrounding his testimony.\u201d\n\n15. The aforementioned facts would certainly make the prosecution\u2019s version improbable and\n\nhard to believe. At the same time, it is desirable to emphasize that, in a criminal trial, the\n\nCourt has a duty to evaluate and assess the credibility and probability of the evidence of\n\nCA/HCC/0175/2024\n\n7 | P a g e\n\nofficial witnesses irrespective of their accuracy and consistency. It is incumbent on the\n\ntrial judge to examine and evaluate their evidence, especially the probability of the\n\nprosecution\u2019s narration of events since in drug cases probability of the prosecution\u2019s\n\nversion of events is often challenged by the defense. Therefore, it is quite unfortunate that\n\nthese facts have escaped the attention of the learned High Court Judge.\n\n16. The learned Counsel for the Appellant also contended that there exist several inter se\n\ncontradictions between the versions of PW1 and PW2 which go to the root of the case.\n\n17. For instance, PW1, when testifying stated that he took the right hand of the Appellant out"

In this regard, it is pertinent to note that, despite the contradictions that exist between the\n\nevidence of PW1 and PW2, the notes taken by both PW1 and PW2 seems strikingly\n\nsimilar in content. Both PW1 and PW2 in their notes have stated that, PW1 took the\n\nAppellant\u2019s right hand out from the pocket of his trouser and found out that the Appellant\n\nwas holding tightly in his right hand a cellophane bag containing Heroine.\n\n20. However, despite such similarities in the notes, PW1 and PW2 have contradicted each\n\nother whilst giving evidence. Also, considering the similarity that exists between the\n\nCA/HCC/0175/2024\n\n9 | P a g e\n\nnotes taken by both PW1 and PW2, the only possible inference that could be drawn is that\n\nthey did not take notes independently, but copied from the other person\u2019s notes.\n\n21. It is noteworthy that according to PW2, it was PW1 who searched the appellant and\n\nrecovered the parcel of Heroin from the appellant\u2019s pocket, which totally contradicts the\n\nevidence of PW1. In my view, this is a vital contradiction that goes to the root of the\n\nmatter, as the charge against the appellant is primarily based on the alleged recovery of\n\nHeroin from his possession. When the two officers who participated in the raid provide\n\ntwo entirely contradictory versions as to the manner in which the parcel of Heroin was\n\nrecovered from the appellant, the very foundation of the prosecution case is irreparably"

While one may argue that\n\nthe aforesaid inconsistencies between the two testimonies of PW1 and PW2 are\n\nminor/trivial in nature, considering this privilege that is available to them, as opposed to\n\nother lay witnesses in a trial, I am of the opinion that, it is not unfair or unrealistic to\n\nexpect more accurate evidence from the official witnesses in a trial of this nature.\n\n24. Thus, when PW1 and PW2 contradicts on some material points which go to the root of\n\nthe matter, it would adversely affect the credibility of the prosecution case.\n\n25. In the Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [2011] 2 Sri LR 292 the\n\nCourt held that:\n\n\u201cWhilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect the\n\ntrustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that the Court must\n\nCA/HCC/0175/2024\n\n10 | P a g e\n\nexercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency or contradiction and whether\n\nthey are material to the fact in issue\u201d\n\n26. Hence, it is not safe to allow the conviction to stand, given the above-mentioned"

Following are the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant.\n\na. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider probability\n\nand also failed to evaluate the testimony of PW2;\n\nb. Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance was not considered;\n\nc. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate medical evidence; and\n\nd. The procedure adopted by the High Court Judge and prosecutor to remove\n\nevidence of PW9, a lay witness, from the proceedings is wrong in law.\n\nCA/HCC/0059/2023\n\n3 | P a g e\n\nBackground to the appeal:\n\n4. The prosecution story was that PW1 the victim when going home riding his bicycle\n\nwas halted by the appellant and pulled the victim to the side of the road and removed\n\nhis trouser and inserted the appellant\u2019s penis twice into his anus.\n\n5. I will first consider whether the learned trial Judge had failed to evaluate the\n\ntestimony of PW1 in particular the probability of his story. According to PW1, when\n\nhe was riding a bicycle, the appellant blocked him and made him to fall. Thereafter,\n\nthe appellant removed the victim\u2019s trouser and inserted his penis to the victim\u2019s\n\nrectum. At that time a person called Priyankara PW9 came and questioned the\n\nappellant. Thereafter, the victim went home crying and informed the incident to his\n\nmother PW1.\n\n6. According to the victim, the alleged offence was committed at the side of the road and\n\nit was a sandy place. The victim was laying on his stomach when the alleged offence\n\nwas being committed by the appellant. \u200d\n\n7. The offences of this nature are normally committed in discreet places where no eye\n\nwitnesses are found. Therefore, court has to rely on the evidence of the victim and if\n\navailable on medical evidence. Very rarely, an eye witness could be found in this kind\n\nof offences."

According to the Medico Legal Report (MLR) the victim was\n\nexamined by PW6 on 23.01.2010 at 10.50 am. The alleged offence was committed on\n\n22.01.2010.\n\n11. According to PW6 he observed no injuries on the body of the victim expect redness\n\naround the anus. It could be observed in the MLR, when PW6 recorded the injuries,\n\nhe had written that there was no evidence of anal penetration but cut it off and later\n\nwrote on the Report that there is medical evidence of recent penetration. It is\n\nsignificant to note that PW6 when stated his opinion on the MLR did not even\n\ndescribe it as anal penetration but recent penetration."

According to MLR, the victim was examined by PW6 on the following\n\nday. In his evidence, the victim stated that he was fallen when the bicycle was stopped\n\nby the appellant. Furthermore, he stated that his hands were held behind his back by\n\nthe appellant and that he was forced to lie on the road while being sexually abused by\n\nhim.

In view of the unconvincing medical evidence, and particularly when the victim\u2019s\n\nnarrative remains uncorroborated by such evidence, it was incumbent upon the\n\nprosecution to call PW9, an eyewitness to the alleged incident.

The Court cannot lightly disregard the non-production of such a\n\ncrucial witness, particularly when his testimony would have provided direct evidence\n\nof the alleged incident. In this regard, the following authorities would be of much\n\nrelevance.\n\n19. In Walimunige John v.

Witnesses\n\nessential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based must be\n\ncalled by the prosecution, whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or\n\nagainst the case for the prosecution.\n\n22. In the present case, there was no justifiable reason for the prosecution to refrain from\n\ncalling PW9, who, according to the testimony of PW2, was an eyewitness to the\n\nincident. Furthermore, a careful examination of the High Court proceedings reveals\n\nthat the learned Judge had permitted the expunging of PW9\u2019s evidence after the same\n\nhad been recorded. In my view, this action has gravely impaired the appellant\u2019s right\n\nto a fair trial.\n\n23. What then was the nature of PW9\u2019s evidence? Why was it expunged? Was it because\n\nsuch evidence was unfavorable to the prosecution\u2019s case? No satisfactory explanation\n\nemerges from the record, nor is any reasonable justification discernible.\n\n24. Moreover, the location where the alleged incident took place further casts doubt on\n\nthe prosecution story. According to PW1, the offence was committed by the appellant\n\non a roadside, which is not a secluded place, and PW3 also purportedly witnessed it.\n\nCA/HCC/0059/2023\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nWhen the medical evidence fails to support the prosecution\u2019s version, the probability\n\nof the prosecution story is further called into question."

Thus, a person of PW 1\u2019s caliber should have reasonably anticipated that someone\n\nwho was supposed to take the parcel form the Appellant would have been roaming in\n\nthe vicinity. If that was the case, allowing the informant to be there with PW 1 and\n\nPW 11 until the Appellant came by three-wheeler would certainly enable any\n\ninterested party to know who the informant is. This again questioned the credibility of\n\nthe PW 1\u2019s evidence."

As admitted by PW1 during cross-examination, their notes\n\ncontained no reference to taking any equipment for sealing purposes, which further\n\ncalls into question the credibility of their evidence.\n\n30.

Justice Shirani Tilakawardane, J. in the case of AG v. Mahadurage Dimson and 3\n\nOthers, CA 141/A-B-2000, decided on 24.11.2003, Her Ladyship held that;\n\n(1) \u201cThe Courts must, while evaluating evidence, bear in mind that in a case\n\nof rape especially a girl of tender age would not come before a Court\n\nmerely to make a humiliating statement against her honour. Therefore,\n\ncontradictions which have no material effect on the veracity of the\n\nprosecutrix case should not be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable\n\nprosecutrix case.\u201d\n\n10. As can be seen from the evidence, the defence marked three contradictions, D1 to D3,\n\nwhen cross-examining PW1, the victim. It must be noted that D1 is not a contradiction but\n\nmerely an omission, which does not affect the credibility of the victim. This omission\n\nconcerns whether the victim had stated to the police that PW3 had assaulted the appellant\n\nwith a pipe.\n\n11. Similarly, the contradictions marked as D2 and D3 are not related to any critical issue of\n\nthe case that could cast doubt on the credibility of PW1. The contradictions marked as D4\n\nand D5 through PW3 are also not connected to any matter that goes to the root of the case.\n\nTherefore, in my view, these contradictions, whether appreciated by the learned trial Judge\n\nor not, would have no impact on the judgment.\n\n12. In a case of this nature, given the age of the victim and the considerable time gap between\n\nthe date of the incident and the date of the trial, the court cannot expect the evidence to be\n\nentirely free of contradictions or omissions. A victim\u2019s testimony does not need to be\n\nperfect to be credible. What is essential is the consistency of the core aspects of the\n\nnarrative, even if minor details vary.

This is because the trial Judge has the priceless\n\nadvantage to observe the demeanour and deportment of the witness which the Court\n\nof Appeal does not have.\u201d\n\n21. The third ground of appeal advanced by the appellant is that it is unsafe to rely on PW1\u2019s\n\nevidence and convict the appellant in the absence of corroborative evidence. It is, however,\n\nwell established that in offences of this nature, it is often difficult to expect eyewitnesses\n\nother than the victim, as the offender usually selects a secluded location to commit the\n\ncrime. In the present case, PW3 also witnessed the incident. According to PW3, when he\n\nwhen to the room where the Appellant and PW1 were, he saw the Appellant touching the\n\ngenitals of PW1 with one hand while touching his own genitals with the other. The charge\n\nleveled against the appellant involves grave sexual abuse, and PW3\u2019s evidence corroborates\n\nPW1\u2019s testimony to a significant extent. No material contradictions appear between their\n\naccounts.\n\n22. In the case of Sunil and another V.

Accordingly, the law permits either to act\n\non corroborated or uncorroborated evidence in determining sexual offences.\n\nWhat expects from a trial Judge is to carefully analyze whether corroboration is\n\nneeded or not.\n\n25. In the instant case, the appellant\u2019s identity was not in dispute, and the complaint\n\nregarding the offence was made promptly. The only matter to be established is the act\n\nof sexual abuse committed by the appellant. As noted earlier, there is no independent\n\nevidence to corroborate the act itself, as it was not witnessed by anyone else; it must be\n\nproved solely on PW1\u2019s evidence. Other incidental matters require no corroboration for\n\nthe reasons discussed above. Accordingly, I hold that there is no issue regarding\n\ncorroboration in this case.\n\n26. During cross-examination, it was only suggested to PW1 that the appellant had not\n\nsexually abused her and that the evidence regarding sexual abuse was false. However,\n\nthe victim\u2019s account of how the appellant asked her to come to the room and how she\n\nwent with him has never been challenged during cross-examination. Consequently, this\n\nunchallenged prosecution evidence must be accepted, as, in the absence of any\n\nsuggestion put to PW1 to the contrary, it amounts to an admission of the prosecution\u2019s\n\nversion, in accordance with the judicial authorities cited below"

In her testimony, the Judicial Medical Officer stated that no injuries\n\ncould be found in this kind of sexual abuse.\n\n31. In her evidence, PW1 stated that the appellant had inserted his penis into her genitals\n\nand that she felt some whitish substance on her body. According to the evidence of the\n\nJMO, he observed no damage to the hymen of the victim and did not notice any redness\n\non her genitals.

Due to this relationship, the victim and her mother\n\nwere frequent visitors to the Appellant\u2019s house and had spent several nights\n\nat the Appellant\u2019s residence. The Appellant\u2019s house was a small rented house\n\nand the inmates of his house were his wife, daughter, son and a person called\n\nThimira who was a bank employee at that time.\n\nAs per PW1, who is the victim in this case, the incident mentioned in this\n\ncase had taken place around 8 or 9 months before the complaint was lodged\n\nwith the police. The victim was not able to provide or confirm any details\n\nabout what grade in school she was in, whether it was a weekday or a\n\nweekend or whether she was on school holidays when the incident had taken\n\nplace.\n\nThe victim claims that the first incident had taken place during a day where\n\nshe had visited the Appellant\u2019s house with her mother. According to her, on\n\nthat given day, while she was watching television with her cousins (the\n\nAppellant\u2019s children), the Appellant had sat on the arm rest of the chair and\n\nhad touched her chest by inserting his hand into the T-shirt she was wearing\n\nat that time.

The Appellant had\n\nslept on the ground with his son. In the morning, the Appellant had been\n\nto the victim. The Appellant had been talking to her and his daughter when\n\nthe second incident had taken place. In that moment, the Appellant had\n\ntouched her genital area over her clothes, while kissing her ear. When the\n\nCA/HCC/0139/2024\n\n5 | P a g e\n\nvictim had then tried to leave the room, the Appellant had hugged the victim\n\nfrom behind.\n\nThe third incident had taken place when she was leaving Thimira\u2019s room\n\nafter taking a wash. At that moment, the Appellant had come behind her and\n\nhugged her again. At the time the victim had encountered this, she was 13\n\nyears and 8 months old.\n\nThe victim and her mother had continued to visit the Appellant after the\n\nincident. However, the victim had not complained about this to anyone\n\nexcept an unnamed friend. Later on, due to a misunderstanding having\n\noccurred between the two families in respect of a financial transaction, she\n\nhad revealed about these incidents to her mother, after which, they had\n\nlodged a complaint to the police.\n\nJMO H. T. D. W. Ariyaratne, who is PW3 in this case, had examined the\n\nvictim and had gone on to note that no external injuries were noted on the\n\nvictim\u2019s body. According to PW3, as the victim had seemed sad, he had\n\nreferred the victim to a Consultant Psychiatric.\n\nThe Learned President\u2019s Counsel argues that the nature of the acts allegedly\n\ncommitted by the Appellant cannot constitute grave sexual abuse. His claim\n\nlies in the argument that the Learned High Court Judge had merely\n\nproceeded to convict the Appellant of the 1st and 2nd charges in the\n\nindictment without proper consideration of whether the mentioned acts do,\n\nin fact, constitute grave sexual abuse.\n\nIn the 1st charge in the indictment, the sexual act noted by the prosecution\n\nwas \u2018touching the chest area of the victim\u2019."

Grave Sexual Abuse\n\n(1) Grave sexual abuse is committed by any person who, for sexual\n\ngratification, does any act, by the use of his genitals or any other part of\n\nthe human body or any Instrument on any orifice or part of the body of\n\nany other person, being an act which does not amount to rape under\n\nsection 363, in circumstances falling under any of the following\n\ndescriptions, that is to say\u2014\n\n(a) without the consent of the other person;\n\n(aa) with or without the consent of the other person when the other\n\nperson is under sixteen years of age;\n\n(b) with the consent of the other person while such other person was\n\nin lawful or unlawful detention or where that consent has been\n\nobtained, by use of force, or intimidation or threat of detention or by\n\nputting such other person in fear of death or hurt;\n\n(c) with the consent of the other person where such consent has been\n\nobtained at a time the other person was of unsound mind or was in a\n\nstate of intoxication induced by alcohol or drugs.\n\nThe acts that fall under the scope of Section 365B must be graver than mere\n\ntouch. The definition found within the section also consists of the words:\n\n\u201cwhich does not amount to Rape\u201d, clearly indicating that the most accurate\n\ninterpretation would be that the act, to constitute grave sexual abuse, must\n\nbe more than merely touching a person.\n\nIn Mahalakotuwa v. The Attorney General [2011] 2 B.L.R 406 D.S.C\n\nLecamwasam,J. held that:\n\n\u201cOn a plain reading of the above section it is clear, that the section\n\nenvisaged a grave situation which falls short of rape. It cannot be a mere\n\n\u2018Touch\u2019. It has to be much more serious than a touch and to come within"

Attorney-General [2010] 2 Sri L.R. 162 it was\n\nheld that:\n\n\u201cTo establish a charge under section 365 (B) of the Penal Code the\n\nprosecution must establish that the alleged act was done with the intention\n\nof having sexual gratification. This aspect must be proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the pertinent issue at hand would be whether the 1st and 2nd\n\ncharges in the indictment could clearly constitute offences under Section 365\n\nB (1) of the Penal Code as amended. In respect of the 1st charge, the alleged\n\nact is that the Appellant had touched the chest area of the victim to obtain\n\nsexual gratification. In respect of the 2nd charge, the alleged act is that the\n\nAppellant had touched the genital area of the victim over her dress to obtain\n\nsexual gratification.\n\nAs examined above, there must be serious, grave circumstances involved in\n\nthe situation in order to punish an accused under Section 365B (1). In this\n\ncase, as seen in the charges, the Appellant had only touched the chest area\n\nand the genital area of the victim. Thereby, I conclude that mere touching of\n\nsuch sensitive areas of a person would not fall under the scope of grave\n\nsexual abuse, as Section 365 B only includes graver situations which fall\n\nshort of rape.\n\nAccordingly, it must now be considered whether the Appellant could be found\n\nguilty in respect of a lesser offence, with the evidence available in this\n\nsituation.\n\nAs per the facts of this case, it is quite evident that the Appellant, while being\n\na close relation of the victim, had used his authority and breached the trust"

The learned Counsel for the appellant has to draw the Court\u2019s attention to the\n\ndiscrepancies identified earlier.

While lapses in memory can occur, they do not inherently undermine the overall reliability of PW1\u2019s testimony when viewed in light of the corroborative elements provided by the prosecution. The absence of evidence indicating any animosity or ill will between the appellant and PW01 is also pertinent to this matter.\n\n21.

The learned High Court Judge was misdirected on the alibi\n\ntaken up by the fourth accused appellant.\n\niii. The judgment contains serious misdirections as to the facts and\n\nlaw.\n\nThe learned Counsel for the fifth accused appellant set out the following\n\ngrounds of appeal:\n\ni. Conviction which solely hinges on the evidence of the sole\n\neyewitness, namely Premadasa, is wholly unsafe.\n\nPage 7 of 12\n\nii. Following closely on ground 01, the learned trial Judge\u201fs\n\nassessment with regard to the credibility and the testimonial\n\ntrustworthiness of the said eyewitness is deficient and defective.\n\niii. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on a\n\ncritical issue of fact by asserting that the evidence of the sole\n\neyewitness has not been challenged, which factual finding is\n\ndemonstrably false, consequently being wholly prejudicial to the\n\nappellants.\n\niv. Although the conviction is based on the footing of unlawful\n\nassembly/common object and common intention, the judgment\n\nis depleted of the said legal principles as concepts which\n\nconsequently renders the judgment legally unattainable.\n\n12. While the appellant\u201fs Counsel have advanced distinct grounds of appeal,\n\nI will address them collectively as they arise similar issues.\n\n13. Courts have consistently affirmed that the prosecution alone carries the\n\nlegal burden of proving a criminal charge.

Accordingly, if the evidence\n\nleaves the trier of fact with a reasonable doubt, the only permissible\n\nverdict is an acquittal.\n\n14.

Rule 3(1) (a) and (b) of the\n\nCourt of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990 is clear as\n\ncrystal on this matter.\n\nAll copies of documents material to the application have to be filed\n\nalong with the petition and affidavit. Where a person is unable to\n\ntender any such document, he shall state the reason for such\n\ninability and seek leave of Court to furnish such document later. This\n\nPetition of Appeal filed against the impugned order is a vital\n\ndocument material to the application to bolster the Petitioner\u2019s\n\nposition that he has pursued the alternative remedy of appeal.\n\nHowever, the petitioner has neither produced same at the time of\n\nfiling of the application nor sought permission to furnish it later. This\n\nis a violation of Rule 3(1) (a) and (b) and therefore, the petitioner is\n\nprecluded from producing the document later and using it to support\n\nhis written submissions\u201d.\n\nOn perusal of the annexed document marked \u2018X\u2019, I found a copy of the\n\nPetition of Appeal tendered to the High Court of Colombo on 13.11.2024\n\nby the Petitioner. The availability of the Petition of Appeal in the revision\n\nbrief is completely suppressed by the Petitioner. As such, the Respondent\n\nsubmits that the Petitioner had not come before this Court with clean\n\nhands and therefore, cannot invoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt.\n\nThe suppression of material facts to the court means intentionally"

Moreover, the petitioner cannot argue that, under the agreement marked P2, he is entitled to pay the amount stipulated therein and resign from the commission. The agreement should be read in line with the provisions of the Air Force Act, and the agreement cannot override the express provisions of the Act. In the case of P.S. Bus Company Limited vs. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61 NLR 491, the court held, inter alia,\u201cThe Court should also take into consideration the disastrous consequences of granting the Writ.\u201d Considering the conduct of the petitioner, the court cannot use its discretion in favour of the petitioner. If the Court allowed the petitioner's application, it could set a bad precedent and as the Air Force Commander expressed his fear, lead Tri Services Medical Officers in the same category to gain MBBS qualifications and leave the service as and when they decide to do so. In the above circumstances, the respondents have acted in accordance with the provisions of the Air Force Act. The recommendations of the 1st respondent to the Ministry of Defence cannot be considered arbitrary or ultra vires.

Document R6 corroborates that the 5th\n\nRespondent was transferred from one entity to another and it is significant R6 was signed by\n\nKeith Wilson on behalf of Reuters Limited while the affidavit marked A8 was sworn and given\n\nby the same person on behalf of Reuters News and Media Limited.\n\nIn view of this material, it is evident that the transfer of the 5th Respondent between two entities\n\nof the same group did not interrupt the continuity of his employment. A mere internal transfer\n\nwithin a corporate group cannot be relied upon to suggest that the employment relationship was\n\ndiscontinued.\n\nNext, I turn to the question of the nature of the relationship between the Petitioner and the 5th\n\nRespondent, namely whether it constituted a contract of employment or merely a contract for\n\nemployment.\n\n7\n\nIn determining whether an individual is a freelancer or an employee, the Court is required to\n\nexamine the substance of the relationship, not the labels used by the employer. It is abundantly\n\nclear that the Petitioner failed to submit any of the annual contracts signed by the parties to the\n\ninstant application whereas the 5th Respondent has produced the written contract marked R1\n\nalong with his objection.\n\nThe material before this Court demonstrate that the 5th Respondent had been working for the\n\nPetitioner under annually renewed agreements from 2005 until 2018. Such long term,\n\nuninterrupted service is inconsistent with freelance work which is ordinarily ad hoc, assignment\n\nbased and non-exclusive. A worker who remains attached to the same organization for more than\n\na decade, on annual renewals indicates the regular nature of the work of the 5th Respondent."

Further, the Learned High Court Judge directed that all\n\nthree sentences run concurrently. Furthermore, payment of Rs. 200,000 compensation to\n\nthe victim, in default, two years of simple imprisonment.\n\nBeing aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Appellant has\n\npreferred this appeal to this Court. However, on 12th November 2025, when the matter\n\nwas taken up for argument, Geeth Karunaratne, AAL, for the Appellant, informed that\n\nthe Appellant intends only to pursue the Appeal against the sentence and accordingly\n\nabandoned and withdrew the appeal against the conviction.\n\nWe note that generally, when sentencing, the Courts consider the aggravating and\n\nmitigating factors along with the gravity of the offence. At the inquiry before sentencing,\n\nthe Counsel for the Appellant had pleaded for mitigation on the following grounds:\n\n1. The Appellant has no previous criminal record.\n\n2. At the time of the instance, the Appellant had pleaded guilty without going for a\n\ntrial\n\n3. The parties involved were in a consensual romantic relationship at the time of the\n\nincident.\n\n4. Considering the case of SC 03/2008 based on similar facts, and accordingly, even\n\nif the legislature has prescribed a minimum sentence, the Supreme Court can act\n\nleniently towards the appellant.\n\nFurther, before sentencing, the Counsel for the Prosecution pleaded the following factors\n\nas aggravating:"

Such other and further reliefs as Your Lordships\u2019 Court shall seem fit\n\nand meet.\n\n2] Brief history of this application is as follows: the case began in the Magistrate's\n\nbreach of peace regarding a family burial ground. The officer in charge of\n\nGalewela Police Station had filed a report under section 66 of the Primary Court\n\nProcedure Act. The 1st Party (Petitioner) claimed the land, called\n\n\"Deganthuduwa,\" was a Paraveni Property given to her father and used as a\n\nfamily burial ground for over 75 years, alleging that the 2nd Party\n\n(Ethabendiwewa Upali Himi) unlawfully entered and filled the graves. The 2nd\n\nParty disputed this, claiming the land was not a family burial ground and the\n\n1st Party lacked title. It is seen in the said action that there were two intervenient\n\nparties, namely Adhikari Gedara Thilakaratne and Adhikarigedara Punchim\n\nMenika. However, by order dated 26/01/2016, said case bearing No. 68943(66)\n\nof Dambulla District/Magistrate\u2019s Court, the learned Primary Court Judge held\n\nthat possession was to be given to the 1st Party, the Petitioner.\n\n3] The controversy escalated when the Divisional Secretary of Galewela\n\n(Appellant/Petitioner) filed an action seeking recovery of possession under the\n\nState Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act of the said land, case bearing No. 80992\n\nof Dambulla District/Magistrate\u2019s Court, the basis of this application.\n\n4] The Respondent (the original 1st Party), now the Petitioner in this application,\n\nobjected, asserting the land was a Paraveni Property and provided documents,\n\n5\n\n\u0dc0\u0dcf1 to \u0dc0\u0dcf 7. After inquiry, the learned Magistrate, by order dated 21/03/2018,\n\nissued an order of ejectment, which was upheld by the Provincial High Court.\n\n5] The Petitioner now seeks a Revision/Restitutio in Integrum, arguing the courts\n\nacted on documents with \"no legal value,\" failed to properly address the land"

It is seen though; the Petitioner had filed revision\n\napplication with regard to the order of 66 Application order, the Petitioner has\n\nnot filed any application before High Court, regarding recovery of the State Land\n\nRecovery of Possession Act. She has clear statutory rights against the\n\nMagistrate\u2019s impugned order which was delivered under the State Land Recovery\n\nof Possession Act. Thus, it is clear that despite the alternative remedy, the\n\nPetitioner had filed this application to this court. In Wijersiri Gunawardane &\n\nOthers v. Chandrasena Muthukumarana & Others, SC Appeal No. 111/2015\n\ndecided on 27.05.2020, his Lordship Aluwihare PC.

In Perera v. Wijewickreme, 15 NLR 411. His Lordship Pereira J. held:\n\n\u201cIt was not granted unless no other remedy was available to the applicant\n\nor unless restitution was the more effectual remedy\u201d\n\n9] In the same case, His Lordship Ennis J. held that;\n\n\u201cThis is an application for restitutio in integrum.

On the day of\n\nthe incident, at around 7.00pm he had gone to pick up his uncle from his\n\nfood stall. When he was riding his motor bike with the deceased, on the new\n\nbridge which was on their way, the witness, with the aid of an electric light\n\nnearby, had spotted a group of people lurking on the middle of the bridge.\n\nAfter seeing the crowd, the deceased had told him to ride the motorbike\n\nthrough the old bridge to avoid the crowd.\n\nBefore entering the old bridge, when the motor bike had slowed down to\n\nnegotiate a hump on the old bridge, the motorbike had broken down and\n\ntoppled to the side of the old bridge. While he was near his motor bike, the\n\ndeceased had started to run from the scene. At that time, PW1 had seen with\n\nthe help of the nearby lights, the 1st Appellant dealing a blow to the back of\n\nthe deceased\u2019s head with a manna knife. Due to the fatal blow, the deceased\n\nhad collapsed and the witness had seen the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Appellants\n\nstanding in the vicinity. The 2nd and 4th Appellants, who were armed with\n\niron rods, had pelted stones at him to chase him out from the scene of crime.\n\nDue to fear, he took to his heels and when he had turned back, he had seen\n\nthe 2nd and 4th Appellants dealing blows on the deceased\u2019s body with iron\n\nrods. PW1 had then hidden himself in the dark for about one hour and had\n\nonly appeared after the arrival of the police."

Thereby, it was\n\ncontended that a conviction for murder is not safe based on his testimony.\n\nThe importance of an omission in criminal trials has been discussed in\n\nseveral judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our country. It is\n\npertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned omissions have any\n\nadverse effect on the evidence given by PW01 in this case.\n\nIn the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa\n\n(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,\n\n\u201cWhilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect\n\nthe trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that\n\nthe Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency\n\nor contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.\n\nDiscrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the\n\nbasic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance.\n\nWitnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies\n\nand omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should\n\ndirect his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness\n\nshould be given an opportunity of explaining the matter.\u201d\n\nCA/HCC/0139-142/2020\n\n10 | P a g e\n\nThe incident happened on 06/03/1998 and PW01 had given evidence before\n\nthe High Court on 06/02/2017 after about 19 years of the incident.\n\nConsidering the contradictions, omissions and the passage of time after the\n\nincident, a reasonable court cannot expect hundred percent accurate\n\nevidence from a witness.

The learned President\u2019s\n\nCounsel submitted that the charges based on the disposal of sand and\n\nthe remand of a suspect are described on the face of the two charge\n\nsheets, and on the said charges, the disciplinary sanction was imposed\n\nby P-13. Hence, P-13 is a speaking order, and the petitioner could rely\n\non the matters stated therein and requires no other material or reports,\n\nso to say. In support of this submission, the petitioner relied on the\n\ndecision of Manickam vs. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of\n\nDefence and External Affairs 62 NLR 204, at page 208.\n\n5. Then, it was argued that the acts on which the disciplinary action is\n\nbased are judicial decisions, and even if they be erroneous, the remedy\n\nis not disciplinary but appellate. As such judicial decisions cannot be\n\nthe subject matter of discipline, the taking into consideration of such\n\ndecisions amounts to taking into account irrelevant considerations, and\n\nsuch decision is thus illegal."

The conduct of the petitioner cannot be branded as unreasonable to disentitle it to a Writ especially when the decisions contained in the letters marked P12 and P13 are ultra vires the powers of the Tea Commissioner.\u201d\n\nWRT/0146/22\n\nPage 7 of 18\n\n\u201cThere has undoubtedly been great delay in challenging the validity or legality of the said circulars. However, the rule of laches or delay is not a rigid rule which can be cast in a straightjacket formula, for there may be cases where despite delay and creation of third-party rights, the Court may still in the exercise of its discretion interfere and grant relief to the petitioner.\u201d\n\n12. As I see, P-13, the decision to terminate the services made upon the\n\nconsideration of two inquiry reports, may be voidable but is certainly not\n\na nullity. The JSC did have the authority and the power to determine\n\nthe sanction upon considering the said inquiry reports. The fact that the\n\ndisciplinary action was based on what the petitioner referred to as\n\njudicial orders does not make the process or the finding a nullity. In\n\ncertain circumstances, a judicial order, though amenable to review or\n\nappeal, can also be the subject matter of discipline. There is no absolute\n\nlegal or other bar preventing or prohibiting judicial decisions from being\n\nthe subject of discipline.\n\nAre judicial orders amenable to discipline?"

The sum total of the orders made by the petitioner in respect of the\n\nrelease of sand is that the petitioner has continuously released property\n\nthat was confiscated and forfeited to the State. It may be to a local\n\nauthority; however, once the property is so confiscated, the property in\n\ngoods becomes State property. The petitioner has claimed ignorance of\n\nthe circular which contains specific directions as to the manner of\n\ndealing with such confiscated sand. By the arbitrary release of the sand,\n\nthe petitioner exhibited an alarming degree of ignorance as to the legal\n\neffect and import of such confiscation. The continuous and repeated\n\norders so made confirm the degree of ignorance. This conduct will\n\nundermine the confidence, integrity, and impartiality and bring\n\ndisrepute to the judiciary. This conduct is thus necessarily egregious\n\nand most certainly deserves and warrants disciplinary action.\n\n28. The charges based on remanding the suspect appear to be a series of\n\nacts. Even with no credible report, information, or material that was\n\nforthcoming from the Police, except the belief of the Police Officer, the\n\npetitioner has continued to remand the suspect. When the psychiatric\n\nreport was called for, and if such report was not brought to the notice of\n\nthe petitioner, the judicial officer ought to have made a much more\n\ndiligent inquiry to ascertain if in fact such report had been received.

In\n\nfact, there are two reports in the record. The psychiatric report is dated\n\nmentioned in Court. It is found in the certified copy of the record.

However,\n\nin the context of the nature and function of a judicial officer, it cannot\n\nbe evaluated or considered in the same plane as any other service or\n\nprofession when it comes to issues of misconduct and discipline.

A Judge, like Caesar\u2019s wife, must be above suspicion. The credibility of the judicial system is dependent upon the Judges who man it.

Accordingly, the sole question for\n\ndetermination in this appeal is whether the sentence imposed on the appellant by the\n\n9. The counsel submitted that the sentence is excessive given the minimum mandatory\n\nsentence is 10 years. In the case before the High Court, it was submitted that the\n\nAppellant is 36 years old, married, and has one child who studies at grade 6; and the\n\nAppellant is the sole breadwinner upon whom the entire family is financially\n\ndependent. Additionally, Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant\n\nrepents on what he had done and therefore, expects clemency form the court.\n\nCA/HCC/0027/2024\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n10. Accordingly, the principal ground urged by the defense in mitigation is the hardship\n\nlikely to befall the Appellant\u2019s family consequent to his incarceration.\n\n11. There are instances where courts exercise leniency in sentencing an accused despite\n\nthe nature of the offence, particularly where mitigating circumstances are present. To\n\nelaborate further, a lesser sentence may be imposed only if the Court is satisfied that\n\n\u201csubstantial and compelling circumstances\u201d exist which would justify such a\n\ndeparture. However, courts must also remain mindful of the message conveyed to\n\nsociety, especially the principle that offences of a heinous nature will not be tolerated\n\nor treated lightly.\n\n12. In deciding whether the mitigatory grounds advanced by the Appellant warrant a\n\nreduction of sentence, this Court must not lose sight of the aggravating circumstances\n\nsurrounding the case, nor of the legislative intent in prescribing severe custodial\n\nsentences for sexual offences.\n\n13. Sri Lankan Courts, in a long line of judicial authorities have held that cases involving\n\nsexual offences, especially where the victims are children, have to be severely dealt\n\nwith so as to create deterrence on the society."

In the case of, Keith Billam (1986) Vol 82 Criminal Appeal Reports 347, the Lord\n\nChief Justice reiterated the foregoing observations and stated that in a contested case\n\nof rape a figure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting point of the\n\nsentence, subject to any aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as\n\nfollows:\n\n\" The crime should in any event be treated as aggravated by any of the\n\nfollowing factors : (1) violence is used over and above the force necessary, to\n\ncommit the rape ; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the victim ; (3)\n\nthe rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been carefully planned : (5) the\n\ndefendant has a previous convictions for rape or other serious offences of a\n\nviolent or sexual kind ; (6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities\n\nor perversions ; (7) the victim is either very old or very young ; (8) the effect\n\nupon the victim, whether physical or mental, is of special seriousness. Where\n\nany one or more of these aggravating features are present, the sentence\n\nshould be substantially higher than the figure suggested as the starting point\n\n\".\n\n25. It can be observed that several of these aggravating circumstances are present in the\n\ncase in hand. The appellant\u2019s request for a glass of water, by which he deceptively\n\ncreated an opportunity to forcibly remove the prosecutrix to a room; the fact that her\n\ngrandmother was asleep after taking medication; the appellant\u2019s prior confirmation\n\nthat the parents were absent from the house; the tender age of the victim, who was\n\nbelow the legal age of consent; the evident degree of pre-planning by the appellant;"

According to PW1, the team left on routine patrol at 9.00 a.m. The arrest in the\n\nKeselwatta area was made at 13.00 hours, and the appellant was subsequently arrested\n\nat 20.00 hours.

In a raid of this nature, it is of paramount importance to maintain notes pertaining to\n\nthe important events which led to the arrest. In the present case, there is a significant\n\ntime gap between the first arrest and the arrest of the appellant. The prosecution\n\nversion is that they were patrolling the area and had communication with their\n\ninformants. In the absence of the odometer reading of the vehicle in which they\n\ntravelled and accurate notes it is difficult to ascertain the truth of the prosecution\n\nversion.\n\n13.

It is also noteworthy that there exists a significant omission in the chain of custody of\n\nthe productions. According to the prosecution, the productions were handed over to\n\nthe Magistrate\u2019s Court by PC 55637 Balasuriya and were accepted by a production\n\nclerk named T. L. Kosala. However, Kosala did not testify at the trial. Instead, another\n\nproduction clerk, Konagama (PW15), gave evidence by referring to the production\n\nregister maintained during the relevant period.

The observations made by the learned trial Judge\n\nat page 40 of the impugned judgment indicate that he had pre-judged the case even\n\nbefore analysing the defence evidence. It can also be observed that the testimony of\n\nthe defence witnesses, although subjected to cross-examination, does not reveal any\n\nsignificant inter-se contradictions. While it is true that they are family members of the\n\nappellant, that fact alone should not serve as a ground to reject their testimony unless\n\nthere exist inherent improbabilities on the face of their evidence.\n\n23. The appellant\u2019s dock statement was corroborated by the defence witnesses. During\n\ncross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, it was put to them that the appellant\n\nhad been arrested at his residence and not at Kadireshan Street as alleged by the\n\nCA/HCC/0214/2019\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nprosecution. In the circumstances, the infirmities in the prosecution evidence, when\n\nconsidered alongside the defence version, undoubtedly cast a reasonable doubt on the\n\nprosecution case. Accordingly, such doubt must be resolved in favour of the appellant.\n\n24. Considering the totality of the evidence, the defence version gains credibility, and at\n\nthe very least, a complete rejection of the defence evidence would not be justified.\n\nThis is a situation where the defence has successfully created a reasonable doubt in\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s version.

Specifically, a doubt arises as to the mode of detection and\n\nproperly appreciate this aspect, which operates in favour of the appellant.\n\n25. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the learned High Court Judge himself\n\nreached the conclusion that the dock statement and the evidence of the defence\n\nwitnesses were deliberately designed by the appellant to create doubt with regard to\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s case, and hence, the defence version could not be accepted.\n\n26. During the trial, both PW1 and PW6 stated that, while on patrol, they arrested a\n\nsuspect with narcotics and handed him over to the Keselwatta Police. However, both\n\nwitnesses failed to corroborate that assertion, as no notes or records were made in that\n\nregard. The defence, in cross-examination, emphasized this omission, as it clearly\n\ncalls into question the credibility of the testimonies of PW1 and PW6.\n\n27. Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge disregarded this point and concluded that\n\nit had no relevance to the present case, further suggesting that the burden lay upon the\n\ndefence to prove the contrary if the arrest was disputed. In my respectful view, this\n\napproach is erroneous in law. When the prosecution asserts a fact but fails to establish\n\nit through credible evidence, the defence cannot be burdened with proving a negative.\n\nThe obligation lies upon the prosecution to prove what they allege, and not upon the\n\naccused to disprove what has not been sufficiently established.\n\n28. For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to\n\nestablish the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

That being so, the\n\npetitioner\u2019s position is that there is absolutely no evidence to justify\n\nnaming him as a suspect. However, according to the further reports and\n\nthe objections, it is apparent that the Customs as well as the Police\n\nhave recorded a statement of the local agent of the shipping company\n\nthat was involved in the importation of this consignment, in the course\n\nof which they have identified the actual importer, who is alleged to be\n\nliving abroad.

As explained in Wade &\n\n\u201cIf confusion and complication are to be avoided judicial review must be accurately focused upon the actual existence of power and not upon the mere preliminaries. The House of Lords perhaps appreciated this point in [citing R vs. Secretary of State for Employment ex p Equal Opportunities Commission [1995] 1 AC 1] \u2026 a case of prematurity, where the issue was not ripe for review.\u201d\n\n7.

The initial application has been filed in this Court on\n\n02.10.2024. That is one year after the receipt of the said summons.

Therefore, it is not\n\nconceivable that such a charge of public nuisance can be maintained by the police. In those\n\n8\n\ncircumstances, if the Petitioner is of the view that there is a nuisance as far as he or his business is\n\nconcerned, then he must institute an action in the District Court on the basis of private nuisance or\n\npublic nuisance to those who come to the shopping complex 3 . Therefore, the Petitioner's\n\nApplication against the Respondents cannot be maintained.\n\nThe second matter is that the Petitioner has made allegations against the Local Government\n\nAuthority, who should take actions against the perpetrators to prosecute for using a space of the\n\nroad for three-wheel parking. However, during submissions, when this Court questioned the\n\nlearned Counsel, it was his submission that even for the Local Government Authority to take action,\n\nthey need to initiate it through the police; therefore, the police were only made Respondents. In\n\nthat sense, without the Local Government Authority as a Respondent, no order can be made in that\n\nrespect, even against the Respondents who are cited in this Application.\n\nThirdly, none of the so-called perpetrators have been made parties to this Application. Therefore,\n\nwithout hearing them, no writ can be issued against anybody, including the Respondents, as their\n\nrights will be affected.\n\nAs such, it is my view that no writ lies in this case. However, if the Petitioner so desires to make\n\nan application, he is entitled to do so by making an application to the District Court to obtain his\n\ncivil rights as an owner to the property in suit4."

It is therefore evident that there are material discrepancies between the\n\nevidence of PW 1, PW 2, and PW 7.\n\nOur courts have consistently held that where such discrepancies go to the root of the\n\nmatter and undermine the basic version of the victim, the court must attach due weight\n\nto those discrepancies.\n\nWhat is a discrepancy was described in The Law of Evidence by Sir John Woodroffe and\n\nSyed Amir Ali (18th edition, Volume I, page 411),\n\n\u201c(5) DISCREPANCIES\n\nPage 11 of 13\n\nThe constant theme on the appreciation of evidence in our courts is the\n\ndiscrepancies in the testimony of various witnesses.

There can be discrepancies of truth as\n\nwell as discrepancies of falsehood. It is common experience that discrepancies do\n\noccur, even in the statements of perfectly honest witnesses; they are really due to\n\ndifferences in individual faculties with regard to observation, recollection and\n\nrecital of details; and unless there is any good ground to think that they are due to\n\na deliberate attempt to suppress or depart from the truth, it is unfair to discard\n\nthe direct testimony of witnesses, merely on account of such discrepancies, when\n\nthere is a general agreement as to material circumstances.

    "chunk_text": "On 11.08.2017, PW 9, SIP Mahesh Raveendra Kumara, arrested the 1st Appellant.\n\nFrom his statement, an iron rod was recovered from behind the Appellant\u2019s\n\nresidence. However, during the trial, PW 1 and PW 2 failed to identify the said\n\nproduction.\n\nPage 7 of 16\n\nAppellant gave evidence from the witness box. According to the 2nd Appellant, on\n\nthe previous day, they had met the deceased, who had asked them to come the\n\nfollowing day to discuss the transaction. According to the Appellant, when they\n\narrived at the house, PW 1 opened the gate. (It is noted that this was not advanced\n\nby the defence during the cross-examination of PW 1.) PW 1 then went inside and\n\nwoke up the deceased, who came out and took hold of an iron rod that was near\n\nthe wall and began to strike the appellant. The 1st Appellant seized the iron rod\n\nfrom the deceased and struck him in return. At that time, PW 1 brought chilli-\n\nmixed water and threw it at the appellants. PW 1 thereafter took a long knife from\n\nunder a chair and handed it to the deceased. (During the cross-examination of PW\n\n1, this was not proposed to her.)\n\nThe 2nd Appellant stated that he pulled the knife from the deceased. This version\n\nwas not challenged during the cross-examination of PW 1. He further claimed that\n\nafter the deceased attacked the appellants with chilli powder, the 2nd Appellant\n\nheld the 1st Appellant and moved outside. The deceased then returned, took the\n\niron rod from the 1st Appellant, and subsequently fell down. At that point, the 2nd\n\nAppellant, in order to safeguard his brother, struck the deceased once with the\n\nknife.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge rejected the appellants\u2019 defense of a sudden fight\n\nand ruled that the appellants are guilty of murdering Samantha Kumara.\n\nThe main arguments advanced by the Appellants are as follows:\n\n1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account the\n\ndiscrepancies in the eyewitness testimony.\n\n2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to properly consider the\n\noccurrence of a sudden fight."

The Learned High Court Judge failed to properly consider the\n\noccurrence of a sudden fight.\n\nInconsistency in the witness\u2019s testimony\n\nIn evaluating the evidence of both witnesses, it is observed that PW 1 and PW 2\n\nwere eyewitnesses to the incident, though they were not present simultaneously.\n\nIt is further noted that PW 2 was only 12 years old at the time, whereas PW 1,\n\nbeing the wife of the deceased, was the only elder there. Both witnesses\n\nconsistently testified that the 1st Appellant attacked the deceased with an iron\n\npipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna knife. The 1st and 2nd\n\nAppellants did not deny this fact. Their defence was that the deceased attempted\n\nto attack them and threw chilli water, and that they acted in private-defence.\n\nWhen we examine the testimonies of PW01 and PW02, certain discrepancies\n\nbecome apparent. PW01 did not mention that the deceased was holding a pole,\n\nwhereas PW02 stated that his father was carrying a wooden pole. Another\n\ninconsistency arises regarding the use of chilli powder water: PW01 claimed that\n\nshe alone threw it, while PW02 asserted that the deceased was the one throwing\n\nchilli water.\n\nThe critical issue, therefore, is whether these discrepancies undermine the\n\ncredibility of these witnesses. The following judgments are relevant to answer the\n\nabove question.\n\nSunil v. Attorney-General, 1999 (3) SLR 191 at page 194, Jayasuriya, J held that:\n\n\u201cIn Jagathsena v.

    "chunk_text": "extends under Section 100 to causing death if there is reasonable\n\napprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the\n\nassault. The oft quoted observation of this Court in Salim Zia v. State of\n\n\"It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self-\n\ndefence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that,\n\nwhile the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,\n\nthe accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his\n\nonus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying\n\nbasis for that plea in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses or\n\nby adducing defence evidence....\"\n\nThe accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. It is enough for him to show as in a civil case that\n\nthe preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea.\u201d\n\nThe Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows,\n\n\u2018when a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the\n\nexistence of circumstances bringing the case within any of general\n\nexceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso\n\ncontained in any part of the same Code, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. is upon him, and the\n\ncourt shall presume absence of such circumstances\u201d (Emphasis added)\n\nIs there any evidence before the trial judge that supports the private defence?\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Learned High Court Judge correctly found that both\n\nAppellants, armed with weapons, entered the house and attacked its windows. No\n\nevidence was adduced of any injuries sustained by the Appellants, whereas the\n\ndoctor recorded multiple injuries on the deceased. It was further established that,\n\nPage 14 of 16\n\nimmediately following the incident, the Appellants threatened the witnesses. In\n\nthese circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge rightly considered and\n\nrejected the plea of private defence."

When the police, PW 10, inspected the scene, they\n\nobserved damage caused to the house. It is further noted that the deceased\n\nsustained multiple injuries inflicted by the Appellants, whereas no injuries were\n\nfound on either Appellant.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded that there is no evidence to\n\nestablish that the injuries sustained by the deceased were inflicted in the exercise\n\nof private defence. We are further of the view that there is no material to\n\ndemonstrate any necessity for the Appellants to cause such injuries to the\n\ndeceased.\n\nWe note that the Appellants arrived armed and entered the house. Furthermore,\n\nboth PW 1 and PW 2 consistently testified that the 1st Appellant assaulted the\n\ndeceased with an iron pipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna\n\nknife. It is also established, based on the testimony of PW 1 and PW 2, that the\n\nAppellants threatened the family members of the deceased before they are leaving\n\nthe house. Upon evaluating the evidence, we hold that the Appellants entered the\n\npremises with a common intention.\n\nUpon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution established the case,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the Appellants committed the murder of\n\nSamantha Kumara.\n\nPage 16 of 16\n\nIn those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the disputed judgment\n\ntogether with the sentencing order.\n\nThe Appeal is dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

According to PW2,\n\n\u2018Chandran Thambi\u2019 is the 3rd Appellant in this case. Considering the evidence\n\ngiven by PW7, the investigation officer, the learned High Court had\n\ndisregarded PW2\u2019s evidence at pages 504-505 of his judgment. As the learned\n\nHigh Court Judge mainly relied on the evidence given by PW1, the eye\n\nwitness, I am of the view that not considering the dying declaration of the\n\ndeceased had not caused any prejudice to the Appellants.\n\nAs per the 4th ground of appeal, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the\n\n2nd,3rd and 4th Appellants contended that the learned High Court Judge had\n\nwrongly rejected the alibi of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Appellants.\n\nIt is trite law that no burden is cast upon the accused to prove his alibi, as\n\nthe alibi is not a defence.

The Respondents have drawn the attention of Court to clause 22 of the Sale Agreement No. 536 dated 24.11.1999, which provides as follows;\n\nIt is of the utmost significance that the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari is a decision founded purely on contract. The act or decision complained of arose from an alleged breach of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is the \"Competent Authority\"' appointed by statute cannot alter the intrinsic character of the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari. The decision is one taken wholly within the context of the contractual relationship and not in the exercise of the powers of a public authority as such. It invoked no administrative powers or authority. It is a decision made in the exercise of a power which springs from contract. In my view, it is a decision clearly\n\n27 Vide paragraphs 15-22 of the Written Submissions of the Respondents. 28 [1985] 2 Sri L.R. 413. The other decision cited by the Respondents in their Written Submissions, Samaraweera v.

I am of the view that the Respondents have successfully made out a case within the aforementioned parameters to establish that the grant of a writ of Mandamus would be futile in the instant application.\n\n34 [1985] 1 Sri L.R. 146 at 151. 35 [2007] 2 Sri L.R. 281. 36 39 NLR 186LR 186 at 191.\n\n20\n\n37 Vide paragraphs 6.1-6.3 of the Written Submissions of the Petitioners. 38 CA (Writ) Application No. 243/2017, decided on 07.11.2017. 39 CA (Writ) Application No. 132/2018, decided on 03.06.2021. 40 CA (Writ) Application No. 21/2022, decided on 13.02.2023. 41 C.A.

They are they expected to maintain the highest professional standards in the regulation and management of their respective sectors, to hold the scales even in the resolution of disputes and, perhaps most importantly, to safeguard the rights and interests of the vulnerable segments within their purview. As custodians of powers vested for the public benefit, such authorities may be reasonably expected to act with the highest degree of responsiveness, diligence, efficiency, transparency and accountability in the discharge of their mandate. I hope the Condominium Management Authority will take heed of such matters in their future conduct.\n\nApplication is dismissed.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal Mayadunne Corea, J.\n\nI agree.

He heavily relies on the judgement of Justice Saleem Marsoof in\n\nthe case of Ratnasiri and Others v. Ellawala and Others (2004)1.\n\nThe second contention of Mr. Jayawardena is that when the Petitioner sought the reasons by P5 as\n\nto why his Tour of Duty was concluded by P4. It was the explanation of the Respondents by way\n\nof Objections, since the Minister had given directions to the 2nd Respondent to recall the Petitioner\n\nfrom his Tour of Duty by R5 (document marked along with the Objections), such decision has\n\nbeen taken by the 1st Respondent. Therefore, Mr. Jayawardena argued that the Minister has given\n\n1 Ratnasiri and Others v. Ellawala and Others [2004] 2 Sri L.R. 137\n\n5\n\ndirections to recall the Petitioner; as such, the 1st and 2nd Respondents are dictated by the political\n\nauthority. As such, the said letter P4 along with P6 is not only irrational, but they were also\n\nauthored under the pressure and dictates of the Minister; therefore, politically motivated decision\n\nis contained therein, though it is not articulate.\n\nHowever, on a question posed by the Court, on whether R5 is only a red herring, his contention is\n\nthat reasons must be given in P4 and P6, otherwise the political reasons have to be attributed to\n\nR5 only.\n\nMr. Dharmawardena on the other hand, having referred to the letter R5, argued that according to\n\nthe Article 52(2) of the Constitution, ministers are not just puppets or cogs in a wheel; any\n\nparticular minister of a particular ministry can give directions to carry out policy decisions to his\n\nsecretary. Therefore, R5 is justified."

As\n\nsuch, as Mr. Dharmawardena indicated, it is clear that the Petitioner has not been absorbed into\n\nthe main cadre of the Foreign Service but was appointed on contract basis by letter marked as P1.\n\n8\n\nTherefore, it is my view that the Petitioner is not entitled to function as a Minister of the Consulate\n\nGeneral.\n\nHowever, on a question posed by me, Mr. Dharmawardena further answered that the retired\n\nsuperior court judges and some retired star-generals have secured appointment in the Foreign\n\nService only on contract basis. Thus, the Petitioner may be having a complaint (if at all) based on\n\nfundamental rights, and not in this Court.\n\nWhether the Petitioner is subject to the contract\n\nIt should be noted that the terms and conditions pertaining to the Petitioner\u2019s appointment are"

However, if the Petitioner is not entitled\n\nto be appointed or be absorbed into the cadre of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service, he is not entitled\n\nto such rights derived from the Constitution or from the Gazette bearing No. 1996/28 as nothing\n\nflows from such law.

They are, as also are government\n\ndepartments, restricted in certain ways by rules of administrative law, such as the rules\n\nwhich prevent their contracts from fettering their discretionary powers and from creating\n\n10\n\nestoppels in some cases. European Union law, moreover, has imposed a special regime for\n\nprocurement contracts, designed to ensure fair competition and non-discrimination.\n\nThe Crown is free to make contracts (though not to spend public money) without statutory\n\nauthority since it enjoys the powers of a natural person?\u2019 Local authorities, on the other\n\nhand, are wholly statutory bodies and can bind themselves by contract only in so far as\n\nstatute permits.\n\nContractual obligations are not enforceable by judicial review, unless the question is"

It is trite law that failure to make necessary parties are fatal to a Writ Application. In coming to this conclusion, I am guided by Rawaya Publishers v. Wijedasa Rajapakse (2001) 3 SLR 213 and Hatton National Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Labour and others CA Writ 457/2011 decided on 31.01.2020.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have considered the submissions made by all parties and have considered the pleadings and the marked documents tendered to this Court. In my view, for the above stated reasons the Petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie case that warrants the intervention of this Court. Hence, I refuse to grant formal notice and proceed to dismiss this Application.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal\n\nMahen Gopallawa, J\n\nI agree\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal"

To be clear, the police were directed to record a\n\nsecond statement, and I most definitely consider the availability of the same\n\nto be very essential to dispense justice.\n\nIn Hattuwan Pedige Sugath Karunaratne v Hon.Attorney General SC\n\nAppeal 32 of 2020 dated 20.10.2020 his Lordship Aluvihare held that:\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 No doubt the duty of a State Counsel is to present the\n\nProsecution in an effective manner to the best of their ability in furtherance\n\nof securing a conviction, if the evidence can support the charge. The\n\nProsecutor, however, is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the\n\nCA/HCC/175/23\n\n6 | P a g e\n\ncourt to dispense justice. Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a\n\nconviction at any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is\n\nmeted out. A Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either\n\nfrom the court or from the Accused. If the investigation has revealed\n\nmatters which are favourable to the Accused and the Accused is unaware\n\nof the existence of such facts, it is the bounden duty of the Prosecutor to\n\nmake those facts available to the court and to the defence. Rule 52 of the\n\nSupreme Court Rules (Conduct and Etiquette for Attorneys at Law) Rules\n\n1988 requires an Attorney at Law appearing for the prosecution to bring it\n\nto the notice of the court any matter which if withheld may lead to a\n\nmiscarriage of justice\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\nIn Wijepala v The Attorney General [2001] 1 SLR 46 at pages 49 and 51"

That Article not only entitles an\n\naccused to a right to legal representation at a trial before a competent\n\nCourt, but also to a fair trial, and that includes anything and everything\n\nnecessary for a fair trial.

He is entitled in law to know such\n\nevidence before he is called upon to plead to the Indictment. It is a right of\n\nhis, inherent in that procedure.\u201d\n\nA fair trial would refer to the legal procedure which has been set in place to\n\nguarantee the fair and just treatment of individuals accused of crimes, which\n\nincludes rights such as public hearings by an independent and impartial\n\ncourt within a reasonable time period.

The\n\nprosecution had used the same Medico Legal Report of the victim which had\n\nbeen filed in HCR/39/2017 to re-consider the charge.\n\nThe Appellant pleaded guilty to the amended indictment 29.03.2022 and was\n\nsentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment suspended for five years with\n\na fine of Rs.5000/- subject to default sentence of 03 months simple\n\nimprisonment. Additionally, a compensation of Rs.150,000/- was ordered\n\nwith a default sentence of 01-year simple imprisonment. The Appellant had\n\nalready paid the fine and the compensation.\n\nBoth the indictments were filed on the same day, that was on 25.11.2016 at\n\nthe High Court of Ratnapura.\n\nAs the prosecution reduced the charge of rape to sexual harassment\n\nconsidering the same Medico legal report of the victim, I conclude that the\n\nprosecution should not have forwarded the indictment pertaining to this case\n\nunder section 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code in the High Court of Ratnapura.\n\nOnce the MLR is compromised, it cannot be used to file additional charges\n\nagainst an Accused.\n\nThe Learned Additional Solicitor General, in keeping with the highest\n\ntradition of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, endorsed that there is merit\n\nin the appeal grounds discussed above.\n\nCA/HCC/175/23\n\n9 | P a g e\n\nThe Appellant has been in remand since 09.05.2023, the date of judgment.\n\nConsidering the evidence led in this case and guided by the judgements\n\nmentioned above, I conclude that this is an appropriate case to acquit the\n\nAppellant from the conviction. Hence, he is acquitted from this case.\n\nThe appeal is allowed."

Has the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the\n\nprosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt based on circumstantial evidence?\n\nii. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the dying\n\ndeclaration in its correct perspective.\n\niii. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the\n\ndefence\u2019s case.\n\n11. The legal principles of dying declarations have originated in English\n\ncommon law based on the maxim \u201cnemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri\u201d\n\n(a man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth) and is applied\n\ntoday as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, though with specific\n\nconditions in different legal systems.\n\n12. The concept of trustworthiness is rooted in the belief that a person at the\n\npoint of death with no hope of recovery has a profound spiritual incentive\n\nto tell the truth, similar to being under oath. The rational for admitting\n\nthis type of evidence (despite it being hearsay and not subject to cross\n\nexamination) is necessity. Often, the victim is the only eye-witness to the\n\ncrime and excluding his or her declaration might allow a perpetrator to\n\nescape justice.\n\nPage 6 of 13\n\n13.

It has been established that the deceased possessed literacy and suffered\n\nfrom no known speech impediment. The appellant has identified a\n\nKalum, it\u2019s the son of the deceased and they have resided together in the\n\nsame household.\n\nPage 9 of 13\n\nFurther, the postmortem examination\u2019s findings are critical. The nature\n\nof the deceased\u2019s injuries precluded neither an instantaneous loss of\n\nconsciousness nor immediate impairment of her speech capabilities. The\n\nattending medical officer has concluded that the deceased would have\n\nretained the ability to speak at the time she was confronted by PW01.\n\nFurthermore, the deceased\u2019s capacity to identify her assailant is not in\n\ndispute, owing to her intimate familiarity with the appellant. This context\n\nrenders it exceptionally improbable that a mother would, in her final\n\nmoments, deliberately make a false declaration implicating her own son.\n\nUnder those circumstances, the relevant contention of the Counsel for\n\nthe appellant must fail.\n\n22. PW08, Dr. De Silva, has testified that the corresponding internal injury,\n\nspecifically bleeding on the right side of the brain, was, in the ordinary\n\ncourse of nature sufficient to cause the death of the deceased.\n\nFurthermore, in King vs. Thajudeen, 6 NLR 16 at page 19, Bonser, J, has\n\nheld that, \u201cwhen people cause injuries to another man their intent must\n\nbe judged by the result of their action\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut it was urged that they did not intend to break the\n\nman\u2019s rib and therefore they could not be convicted of\n\ngrievous hurt.

In light of medical evidence and legal precedent, it can be inferred that\n\nthe appellant intended to inflict the injury upon the deceased which was,\n\nin the ordinary course of nature, sufficient to cause her death.\n\n24. While the learned High Court Judge has not explicitly stated this\n\nconclusion in so many words, he has thoroughly referred to the injuries\n\ninflicted on the deceased. He has also meticulously examined the\n\nmedical evidence elicited at the trial and established a clear connection\n\nbetween the injuries and the deceased\u2019s death. Consequently, it can be\n\nunderstood that the learned High Court Judge has implicitly concluded\n\nthat the appellant has committed murder under the third limb of section\n\n294 of the Penal Code.\n\n25. The learned Counsel for the appellant has also submitted that the\n\nlearned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the facts,\n\nspecifically in concluding that the appellant attempted to flee upon being\n\naccosted by PW03, after the deceased was hospitalized. It has been\n\ncontended that the testimony merely demonstrates that the appellant\n\nturned away, rather than evidencing an attempt to flee.\n\n26. In convicting the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has not relied\n\nsolely on the solitary circumstance earlier referred to. Rather the learned\n\nHigh Court Judge has assessed the totality of the evidence on record and\n\nfound the deceased\u2019s declaration to PW01 was consistent with other\n\nindependent circumstances. Taken together those circumstances have\n\nPage 11 of 13\n\nlent assurance to the reliability of the deceased\u2019s declaration and\n\njustified the Court\u2019s reliance on it."

The 10th Respondent argued that the Petitioner's\n\nsubsequent submission of backdated forms was a continuation of the fraud\n\nperpetrated on the Court. The Petitioner was also guilty of withholding\n\ndocuments (\"A6\" and \"A7\") that were unfavourable and would have exposed the\n\ndeceptive conduct, raising a presumption under Section 114, Illustration (f) of\n\n11"

Chief Justice Sripavan in Noble Resources International Private Limited v\n\nHon Ranjith Siyamabalapitiya and Others [SC FR No. 394/2015 decided\n\non 24th June 2016] held that neither the State nor the Procurement\n\nCommittee was to act contrary to the Bid Documents and Government\n\nProcurement Guidelines, and that full and strict compliance with all\n\nnecessary safeguards was of utmost importance, with any departure\n\nmaking the evaluation process void.\n\n4.

It is also common ground and an undisputed fact, as\n\nadmitted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents, that the 4th Respondent\u2019s powers have been delegated to the\n\n1st Respondent to authorise or grant building permits or development permits to the people within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the 1st Respondent.\n\nHowever, in the instant case, neither has the 9th Respondent obtained such approval or permit from\n\nthe 1st Respondent, nor has the 1st Respondent issued such approval or permit to the 9th Respondent\n\nto construct the impugned building erected on the premises of the 9th Respondent. As such, it is\n\nmy view that the 1st to 3rd Respondents are responsible for taking actions against the 9th Respondent\n\nfor and on behalf of the 4th Respondent and other Respondents as it is a vicarious duty and\n\nresponsibility as provided for by the law. Therefore, it is my view that the Respondents have\n\nderelicted their statutory duties in taking legal actions against the 9th Respondent, on the complaint\n\nmade by the Petitioner, who is directly affected by the said unauthorised construction.\n\nIn fact, permits are issued in respect of construction, particularly in areas where local government\n\nbodies are set up under the law, for the purpose of regulating the smooth living conditions in such"

The modern administrative state was taking shape,\n\nreflecting the feeling that it was the duty of government to provide remedies for social and\n\neconomic evils of many kinds. This feeling was the natural consequence of the great\n\nconstitutional reforms of the nineteenth century.

Thus, this Court can issue a Writ of\n\nMandamus, compelling them to take necessary actions against the 9th Respondent.\n\nThe local authorities are expected to regulate proposed building plans for several reasons. One\n\nsuch reason is regarding natural resources; all individuals residing within the jurisdiction of such\n\nlocal authority should be equally entitled to have access to the available natural resources such as\n\nwater, sunlight, and unpolluted air (ventilation), as it is a part to their right to life.\n\nThe second matter that should be considered by the local authorities is the amount of inhabitants\n\nwho will occupy or use the area proposed to be constructed; if the number of inhabitants exceeds\n\nthe expected amount, then it has to be regulated for the simple reason that an enormous number of\n\ninhabitants occupying or residing within a small area might affect the rights of other people, when\n\nit comes to common amenities such as water supply, drainage, ventilation, sunlight, and electricity\n\nsupply.\n\nFurthermore, the following passage illustrates H.W.R.

Like the quashing order, it later developed into\n\npart of the regular mechanism of judicial control both of inferior tribunals and of\n\nadministrative authorities.3\u201d\n\nQuestion of delay\n\nThe next question that needs to be decided is whether delay on the part of the Petitioner defeats\n\nthe issuance of any writ in favour of the Petitioner.\n\nAs particularly the Counsel for and on behalf of the 9th Respondent argued, even if there appears\n\nto be delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court, such gap of time cannot be considered as a\n\ndelay for the following reasons.\n\nFirstly, unless and until the Petitioner wrote to the 1st Respondent by P20 and the 1st Respondent\u2019s\n\nresponse to the same in P21, the Petitioner was not aware that the 9th Respondent had not been\n\nissued with a valid development permit or approved building plan issued by the 1st Respondent or\n\nany other authority. The questions contained in P20 have been answered by P21; the document\n\nmarked P21 has been issued on 2022.01.03, a month after P20. Therefore, it is my view that there\n\nis no delay in prosecuting this application as it had been filed on 2022.10.14.\n\nThe second matter is that the 9th Respondent had initially constructed only the ground floor; slowly\n\nhe has added other floors; therefore, his secret in intentions in adding other floors should not defeat\n\nthe Petitioner\u2019s right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, because the completion of the building\n\n3 Chapter 16 \u201cPrerogative Remedies\u201d, Page 483.\n\n17"

The legal consequences imposed\n\n14.\u200bIn Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe [1993] 2 SLR 81, S. N. Silva, J, as he\n\nwas then, in assessing the aggravating circumstances as regards to the\n\noffence of rape has stated as follows;\n\n\u201cIt is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the Lord Chief\n\nJustice in the Court of Appeal of England, with regard to the\n\nsentences to be imposed for an offence of rape. In the case of\n\nRoberts [4] at page 244. It was observed as follows;\n\n\u201cRape is always a serious crime. Other than in wholly exceptional\n\ncircumstances, it calls for an immediate custodial sentence. This\n\nwas certainly so in the present case. A custodial sentence is\n\nnecessary for a variety of reasons. First of all to mark the gravity of\n\nthe offence. Secondly to emphasise public disapproval. Thirdly to\n\nserve as a warning to others. Fourthly to punish the offender, and\n\nlast but by no means least, to protect women. The length of the\n\nsentence will depend on all the circumstances. That is a trite\n\n8\n\nobservation, but these, in cases of rape vary widely from case to\n\ncase.\n\nIn the case of, Keith Billiam [5] the Lord Chief Justice repeated the\n\nforegoing observations and stated that in a contested case of rape a\n\nfigure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting\n\npoint of the sentence, subject to any aggravating or mitigating\n\nfeatures. He observed further as follows:-\n\nThe crime should in any event be treated as aggravating by any of\n\nthe following factors: (1) violence is used over and above the force\n\nnecessary to commit the rape; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or\n\nwound the victim; (3) the rape is repeated; (4) the rape has been\n\ncarefully planned; (5) the defendant has previous convictions for\n\nrape or other serious offences of a violent or sexual kind; (6) the"

Subendran for the Respondent Argued on : 19-11-2025 Decided on : 10-12-2025\n\n4\n\nthan 10 years. Furthermore, when the property was mortgaged to the plaintiff-respondent by the 2nd defendant-respondent, the agreement to sell the property to the petitioner was expressly cancelled by the 2nd defendant, by deed no. 1225 dated 10-05-2018, for which the petitioner was also a party and signed the same. Therefore, there is no valid agreement to sell the property to the petitioner. After the decree nisi was made absolute, the 2nd defendant-respondent executed deed no. 28 dated 13-10-2025 in favour of the petitioner for the property described in the schedule to that deed, subject to the Mortgage Bond No. 1224 dated 10-05-2018. The same property was mortgaged to the plaintiff company by the 2nd defendant-respondent by the said Mortgage Bond No. 1224. Petitioner states that he had filed an application under section 241 of the Civil Procedure Code before the District Court of Colombo. The Learned Additional District Judge of Colombo, by her order dated 29-10-2025, dismissed the petitioner\u2019s application. In this application, the petitioner seeks, inter alia, the following reliefs.\n\nb) Revise and/or set aside the order of the learned District Judge of Colombo dated the 29th October 2025 made in the Case bearing No. DDR 151/19 of the District Court of Colombo,\n\nc) Revise and/or set aside all the orders of the learned District Judge of Colombo made in the Case bearing No. DDR 151/19 of the District Court of Colombo,\n\nd) Revise and/or set aside the fiscal report entered on 31st of October 2025 in the Case bearing No DDR 151/19 of the District Court of Colombo,\n\ne) Grant and issue an interim order staying the operation of the Writ of Execution issued against the Petitioner and the 2nd Defendant-Respondent."

According to the respondents, these recruitments on contractual basis\n\nwere necessitated in order to safeguard the archaeological sites across\n\nthe island, and in view of the urgency, they were so recruited on\n\ncontractual basis. Recruitments on this basis had been made as there\n\nhad not been cadre approval to accommodate the required number of\n\nemployees at that point. To meet this exigency and due to the urgency,\n\nthe 1st respondent, the CCF, has agreed to recruit the petitioners on\n\nsuch contract basis and assign them to the Department of Archaeology\n\n(vide R-1 and R-2). It is thus admitted and conceded by the respondents\n\nthat the petitioners were employed on such contractual basis. However\n\nthe respondents claim that it was strictly on such basis for a specific\n\ntime period. The respondents also concede that such contracts initially\n\ngranted were in fact extended in respect of two categories of petitioners\n\nreferred to in paragraph 03 above.\n\n5. The position of the respondents is that, at all material times, the\n\npetitioners were employees of the CCF. Thereafter, with the approval of\n\nthe Director General of the Department of Management Services, cadre\n\npositions for 865 Archaeological Assistants and 1,000 watchers were\n\napproved within the Department of Archaeology (vide 4R-4). Then, by\n\npublic notice dated 03.04.2019, applications were called for to fill these"

At this juncture, it is necessary to refer to the\n\nrelief sought by prayer (d). The learned State Counsel argues that the\n\nrelief sought is for reinstatement, and it cannot be granted. The\n\nargument is that a reinstatement sought is based on the abandoned\n\nprocess of recruitment, and the petitioners have not challenged the said\n\nabandonment. However, on a careful and close perusal of prayer (d) it is\n\nWRT/0127/20\n\nPage 45 of 56\n\napparent that the petitioners have sought to be reinstated in service in\n\nthe posts they held under P-1 to P-394 (as per the original letters of\n\nappointment and contract). However, the said relief also seeks writs of\n\nmandamus directing the respondents to make the said appointments of\n\nthe said petitioners permanent in terms of the Public Administration\n\nCirculars marked P-4(i) and P-4(ii). These two Circulars provide for the\n\nappointment and/or making permanent those who hold certain posts on\n\na contractual basis. The relevant portion, from P-4(ii), are as follows:"

This is a clear\n\nholding out that at some point in time, upon the cadre approval, the\n\npetitioners will be attached to the Department of Archaeology. The\n\nsaid posts by the Department of Management Services. The learned\n\nState Counsel argues that this is a mere information and not a promise\n\nof permanent employment.\n\n19. The plain reading of the said clause simply means what it says, and\n\nthat\u2019s no more and no less than that the attachments will be made to\n\nthe Department of Archaeology upon the realisation or receiving of cadre\n\napproval. These petitioners have been appointed on contract basis to two\n\nspecific posts. The cadre approval was to be obtained in the future. When\n\nthe petitioners are informed that attachment would be made with the\n\napproval, that means that they will be so appointed. This certainly\n\ncreates an expectation, and as it is based on a lawful basis, to my mind,\n\nit is legitimate per se.\n\n20. I will now consider if the sequence of events that is common ground\n\nbetween the parties in fact is sufficient to create such a legitimate\n\nexpectation. The starting point is the initial letters of appointment, P-1\n\nto P-394. The petitioners have been serving between 1 \u2013 3 years in such\n\nposts and positions. The learned State Counsel does inferentially argue\n\nthat the said letters of appointment were not given by the Department\n\nof Archaeology, but the CCF. The argument is that in the absence of any\n\ndirect holding out, promise, or representation by the Department of\n\nArchaeology, the petitioners cannot have a legitimate expectation which\n\nwould bind the Department of Archaeology. To this end, I observe that\n\n4R-1 is relevant.

Paragraphs 1 and 4 read as follows:\n\n21. According to which, the Director General of Archaeology has informed\n\nthat upon a discussion held with the Minister and the Secretary, it has\n\nbeen decided that the persons who may be recruited to the CCF, upon\n\nbeing so recruited, would be attached to the Department of Archaeology.\n\nFurther it has also been stated by the Director General, in no uncertain\n\nterms, that the said recruitments to the CCF be made in accordance\n\nwith the scheme of recruitment of persons with the requisite\n\nqualifications, as such persons are due to be absorbed to the\n\nDepartment of Archaeology. This, as I see, is a clear holding out by the\n\nDirector General of Archaeology that, in fact, the petitioner, in due\n\ncourse, would be absorbed.\n\n22.

The position of the respondents is that in\n\nview of the said circulars, the recruitment of the petitioners, including\n\nWRT/0127/20\n\nPage 52 of 56\n\nthose who were successful at the interviews held in 2019, could not be\n\nprocessed and made. Accordingly, the learned State Counsel argues that\n\nthe petitioners are thus not entitled to seek employment as prayed for.\n\n26. I will now consider this argument in the light of the events that\n\ntranspired between 2019 and 2021. At the very outset, the petitioners\n\nhave certainly been recruited on contract basis by the CCF for the\n\nspecific purpose and object of them being employed for the purposes of\n\nthe Department of Archaeology. The use of the words \u2018attachment\u2019 and\n\n\u2018absorption\u2019 clearly puts it beyond doubt that the petitioners, though\n\nrecruited on contract basis by the CCF, were in fact so recruited on\n\nbehalf of the Department of Archaeology, at least to the extent that the\n\npersons so recruited whilst being physically employed at various\n\narchaeological sites were intended to be so absorbed and attached to the\n\nDepartment of Archaeology upon the cadre approval. In these\n\ncircumstances, the petitioners certainly will have the expectation of\n\nbeing attached and absorbed to the Department of Archaeology without\n\nany other interview or examination. However, by 4R-4 and 4R-5, there\n\nappears to have been a change that such persons may be required to\n\nface an interview. It is in view of this change of policy and procedure that\n\nthe petitioners have applied and faced the interviews in 2019.\n\n27.

Bad faith therefore scarcely has an independent existence as a distinct ground of invalidity.\u201d [emphasis added]. 30. Accordingly, on the one hand, the 98 petitioners who had a legitimate\n\nexpectation of being recruited has been denied and their expectations\n\nviolated. Similarly, the decision to change the policy by Circular No.\n\nevent, is unreasonable vis-\u00e0-vis the said 98 petitioners, as it appears\n\nthat the same was for an extraneous consideration and made in bad\n\nfaith, to that extent. Even if this does not necessarily imply any moral\n\nturpitude, such exercise of power is mala fide as a matter of law.\n\nConclusion.\n\n31. Accordingly, I hold that the 98 petitioners hereinafter mentioned are\n\nentitled to the relief as follows, in respect of prayer (d). A writ of\n\nmandamus is accordingly issued directing the respondent 5A, the\n\nDirector General of the Department of Archaeology, to appoint the 1st,\n\n18th, 21st, 43rd, 49th, 50th, 58th, 60th, 61st, 63rd, 65th, 66th, 79th,\n\n80th, 81st, 84th, 91st, 94th, 99th, 104th, 107th, 120th, 121st, 125th,\n\n126th, 127th, 133rd, 142nd, 148th, 151st, 152nd, 155th, 156th, 157th,\n\n158th, 160th, 169th, 171st, 175th, 180th, 183rd, 188th, 194th, 196th,\n\n199th, 200th, 208th, 209th, 215th, 216th, 217th, 218th, 220th, 227th,\n\n231st, 233rd, 235th, 247th, 251st, 253rd, 256th, 258th, 261st, 267th,\n\nWRT/0127/20\n\nPage 55 of 56\n\n269th, 273rd, 279th, 285th, 286th, 290th, 292nd, 294th, 295th, 296th,\n\n302nd, 306th, 315th, 316th, 317th, 322nd, 323rd, 336th, 337th, 341st,\n\n342nd, 344th, 345th, 347th, 348th, 350th, 353rd, 354th, 356th, 364th,\n\n366th, 384th, 386th, and 390th petitioners to the respective posts such\n\npetitioner has been successful at the interviews as depicted in X-1 and\n\nX-2.

    "chunk_text": "The Petitioner in the instant application was an employee of the Nuwara Eliya branch of the National Housing Development Authority (hereinafter sometimes referred to as NHDA). It is said that while occupying the official quarters, the Petitioner had applied for a land from a housing scheme of the 1st Respondent in Nawagamgoda. Consequently, after all due payments were settled, the 1st Respondent had undertaken to grant the title deed for the property bearing No.56, Nawagamgoda, Hawaeliya, Nuwara Eliya, to the Petitioner as per the letter marked P2 dated 23.08.2005. However, the 2nd Respondent had unlawfully and forcibly entered into such property, and subsequently, the 1st Respondent had given possession of such property to the 2nd Respondent. Although the Petitioner had requested the 1st Respondent to evict the 2nd Respondent and hand over possession of the impugned land, the 1st Respondent had failed to do so.\n\nPage 3 of 8\n\nPetitioner states that the 1st Respondent abused the power vested in it by failing and neglecting to comply with the provisions of the National Housing Authority Act.\n\nAccordingly, the Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this Court by seeking a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to evict the 2nd Respondent from the above-mentioned house bearing No.56, and to deliver vacant possession of such house to the Petitioner and to issue the relevant title deed in favour of the Petitioner."

However, she is not entitled to\n\nnominate anybody as her successor in terms of Section 48B of the Ordinance.\n\nTherefore, nominating the 5th Respondent as her successor, and registering it by the 1st Respondent\n\nin the relevant Folio is erroneous and cannot be maintained.

Nevertheless,\n\naccepting her rights and the decision to issue a new permit or grant in due favour is erroneous. In\n\naddition to that, accepting the nomination of the 5th Respondent by the 4th Respondent as her\n\nsuccessor and registering her name is erroneous.

She resided with the\n\nincident, while returning from work around 6:30\u20137:00 p.m., PW1 heard the\n\ndistressing voice of the deceased.

PW2\n\nunequivocally stated that she saw only two persons and did not testify that they were\n\ndid anything beyond holding the deceased. Moreover, the trial Judge\u2019s conclusion that\n\nthe deceased died as a result of an assault by the 1st to 3rd accused is not supported by\n\nthe evidence. The sole eyewitness, PW2, never stated that she observed the 1st to 3rd\n\naccused attacking the deceased. Such findings, which are inconsistent with the record,\n\nconstitute material misdirection.\n\n8. What is discernible from the judgment is that several conclusions reached by the\n\nlearned trial Judge are wholly inconsistent with, or contrary to, the evidence led at the\n\ntrial. At pages 5 and 6 of the judgment, the learned Judge concludes that PW2\n\nCA/HCC/0205/2024\n\n4 | P a g e\n\nwitnessed the 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused assaulting the deceased, an assertion never made\n\nby PW2 in her testimony.\n\n9.

These findings, being unsupported by the evidence, amount to clear\n\nmisdirection.\n\n10. More importantly, at page 8 of the judgment, the learned Trial Judge stated that he\n\nwould analyze the testimony of PW2 on the premise that she had stated that she saw\n\nthe deceased being attacked by the 3rd accused (the appellant). It is significant to note\n\nthat PW2, in her evidence, never stated that she saw the appellant attacking the\n\ndeceased.\n\n11. It is further evident that the learned Trial Judge proceeded on the premise that PW2\n\nhad witnessed the deceased being attacked with sharp cutting weapons by the 1st to 3rd\n\naccused, despite PW2 never having stated any such fact in her testimony.

Regrettably, the learned Trial Judge appears to have paid little or no attention to the\n\nevidence adduced at the trial, as he has made several glaring errors in the judgment.\n\nHis lack of care is clearly demonstrated by the erroneous statement that the 1st and 2nd\n\naccused had testified at the trial, whereas the 1st accused had died even before the\n\ncommencement of the proceedings.

It is well settled that an alibi once raised, the Court is under a duty to consider it in\n\nlight of the totality of the evidence. The mere absence of formal notice does not, by\n\ntaken by surprise or prejudiced in any manner. The jurisprudence consistently\n\nrecognizes that an alibi must be evaluated alongside all other evidence, and if it raises\n\na reasonable doubt as to the presence of the accused at the scene, the benefit of that\n\ndoubt must be afforded to the accused.\n\n16. In these circumstances, the learned Trial Judge\u2019s refusal to consider the alibi solely on\n\nthe basis of an alleged procedural default constitutes a misdirection in law. Such an\n\napproach undermines the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial and fails to appreciate the\n\nproper legal principles governing the assessment of alibi evidence.\n\n17. It is also notable that the learned Judge, without any evidential foundation, proceeded\n\nto attribute blame to the defence counsel by suggesting that the alibi may have been a\n\ncreation or fabrication on the part of counsel. In my view, this was an entirely\n\nunwarranted and inappropriate remark which ought not to have been made. Such\n\ncomments reflect adversely on the Judge\u2019s attitude towards defence counsel and raise\n\nserious concerns regarding the fairness and impartiality of the trial process.\n\n18. It may also be observed that the learned trial Judge drew an adverse inference against\n\nthe appellant on the basis that he had been evading arrest for six months. Although the\n\nappellant surrendered to court six months after the incident, there was no evidence\n\nwhatsoever to establish that he had been evading arrest during that period.

Another glaring error evident in the judgment is the observation by the Trial Judge\n\nthat PW2 had seen the deceased being killed and that the appellant was attacking the\n\ndeceased while kneeling beside him.

Many of the conclusions reached by the\n\nlearned Trial Judge are based on speculation rather than on any supporting evidence.\n\nThe contradiction marked as 3D1 reveals that the sole eyewitness, PW2, was unable\n\nto identify the person who was kneeling beside the deceased when she first saw him.\n\nShe further stated that the individual who was mounted on the deceased\u2019s legs was not\n\npresent in court.

The judgment of the learned High Court Judge is contrary to section 283 of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure Act;\n\n2. The learned trial Judge has first come to the findings that the PW1 sole eye\n\nwitness is a credible witness before considering the other evidence of the\n\nprosecution and the defense witnesses;\n\n3. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the Government Analyst\n\nReport on ballistic evidence marked as X creates a reasonable doubt on the\n\nprosecution case;\n\n4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of the\n\nsole eye witness contradicts the Government Analyst Report, her evidence is\n\nimprobable and not credible as there exist material contradictions and\n\nomissions. Her evidence contradicts medical evidence and also, she is an\n\ninterested witness; and,\n\n5. The learned trial Judge has failed to call the defense of the accused-appellant\n\nas per Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n5. The sole eyewitness, PW1, is the mother of the deceased. According to her testimony,\n\non the day of the incident she had gone to pick flowers at a land known as\n\nPattanbugodawatta. The deceased had also gone there to play elle. While PW1 was\n\nseated on a log, she observed the deceased approaching the land from a nearby paddy\n\nfield in the company of a friend named Ajith. At that moment, the appellant\n\napproached the deceased from behind, followed by the second and third accused."

However, for the reasons stated above, I am not inclined to treat this\n\nas a material omission that diminishes the credibility of PW1\u2019s evidence.\n\n22. It is trite law that not every inconsistency or omission in the testimony of a witness is\n\nfatal to the prosecution. Courts have repeatedly emphasized that minor variations,\n\nparticularly those attributable to the passage of time, do not erode the credibility of a\n\nwitness unless they strike at the very core of the prosecution\u2019s version. Human\n\nrecollection is inherently fallible, and with the lapse of many years, such as in the\n\npresent case, some degree of discrepancy is not only natural but inevitable. What the\n\ncourt must determine is whether the alleged contradictions pertain to material\n\nparticulars that fundamentally undermine the prosecution case, or whether they are\n\nmerely trivial deviations that do not affect the reliability of the witness on the central\n\nnarrative.\n\n23. So far as the question of inconsistency between medical evidence and ocular evidence\n\nis concerned, the law is well settled that, unless the oral evidence available is totally\n\nirreconcilable with the medical evidence, the oral evidence would have primacy.

A very great South African judge. Curlewis J. A., in the case of R. v. Hepworth, 1928\n\nA.D. 265, 277 once said:\n\n\"A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim the benefit of\n\nany omission or mistake made by the other side. and a judge's position in a\n\ncriminal trial is not merely that of an umpire to see that the rules of the game\n\nare observed by both sides.

It is also significant to emphasize that this was not an incident that unfolded step by\n\nstep, allowing the witness to observe each stage slowly and carefully. Therefore, it\n\ncannot reasonably be expected of a lay witness of PW1\u2019s calibre to precisely state the\n\nnumber of shots fired at the deceased based solely on the sound of gunfire,\n\nparticularly given that the shots were fired in rapid succession.\n\n28. In these circumstances, the inconsistency in PW1\u2019s evidence regarding the number of\n\nshots fired cannot, in my view, be regarded as a material contradiction that\n\nundermines the credibility of PW1.\n\n29. Another argument advanced by the appellant is that the Government Analyst\u2019s Report,\n\nmarked as \u2018X\u2019 by the defence, contradicts the evidence of PW1 and establishes that\n\nthe empty cartridges recovered from the scene of the murder were not discharged\n\nCA/HCC/0229/2018\n\n9 | P a g e\n\nfrom the pistol marked as P3.

Furthermore, the learned Trial Judge has considered the dock statement but\n\na nearby thicket after the incident and was arrested on the following day. In fact,\n\nduring cross-examination, the appellant specifically disputed the prosecution\u2019s version\n\nof his arrest. In any event, it is impossible to infer that any reasonable judge could\n\nhave reached a different conclusion regarding the appellant\u2019s guilt, even if the\n\nevidence had been analyzed in greater detail.\n\n49. Therefore, it is my considered view that, despite the presence of some minor\n\ncontradictions and omissions, the prosecution\u2019s evidence, when considered in its\n\nentirety, is sufficient to safely secure the conviction of the appellant, notwithstanding\n\nthe appellant\u2019s submission that the prosecution failed to prove the charge beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\nCA/HCC/0229/2018\n\n14 | P a g e\n\n50.

The learned trial Judge failed to exercise his judicial mind in determining\n\nwhether the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n2. The learned trial Judge failed to properly analyze and give legal consideration\n\nto the inherently improbable and contradictory evidence of the prosecution\n\nwitness.\n\n3. The learned trial Judge failed to adequately assess the unreliable and\n\nimprobable evidence pertaining to the seizer and sealing of production and\n\nprocedural irregularities followed by the prosecution which undermined the\n\nintegrity of the chain of custody and cast serious doubt on the safety of the\n\nconviction.\n\n4.

The team of officers left the Colombo North Crime Investigation Unit at\n\naround 21.00 hours and proceeded to No. 47/K/14, Sumittpura, Mattakkuliya, where\n\nresidence.\n\n6. They entered the Appellant\u2019s house and found the Appellant seated in the living room.\n\nAs instructed by PW1, PW7 took the Appellant into a room inside the house and\n\nCA/HCC/0119/2025\n\n4 | P a g e\n\nconducted a physical search, during which she recovered a parcel from the right-side\n\npocket of the frock worn by the Appellant. PW7 thereafter handed the parcel over to\n\nPW1, who sealed the production.\n\n7. It is noteworthy that when questioned, PW7 was unable to recollect whether any other\n\npersons were present at the Appellant\u2019s house at the time of the raid. It is also\n\nimportant to note that in her evidence-in-chief, PW7 stated that the police vehicle had\n\nstopped right in front of the Appellant\u2019s house. However, during cross-examination,\n\nwhen questioned about the width of the road where the Appellant\u2019s house is situated,\n\nthe witness admitted that it was a narrow lane. It was further suggested to the witness\n\nthat the width of the road leading to the Appellant\u2019s house was only two feet, but the\n\nwitness failed to answer the question.\n\n8. Thereafter, the witness admitted that the police vehicle had not stopped in front of the\n\nAppellant\u2019s house, as stated in her evidence-in-chief, but rather at the entrance of the\n\nroad leading to the Appellant\u2019s residence. One of the most improbable aspects of\n\nPW7\u2019s evidence, as observed by this Court, is her assertion that the Appellant had\n\nkept a heroin parcel in the front pocket of her frock until the police party arrived at\n\nher residence and searched her. Hence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept that a\n\nperson would have kept a small parcel of heroin in the pocket of her frock while\n\nremaining inside, waiting for the police to arrive and arrest her."

Another\n\nunusual aspect is that this witness certified the lead officer\u2019s notes, which is not the\n\nstandard practice.\n\n10.

Although PW1 stated that he had searched the vehicle and the officers prior to setting off\n\non the routine duty, no notes were made in that regard. PW1 in fact admitted that such a\n\nsearch constituted an important part of the raid.\n\n11. The failure to record this essential procedural step is a serious lapse, as the pre-search of\n\nofficers and the vehicle is a safeguard designed to eliminate the possibility of subsequent\n\nfabrication or planting of illicit substances.\n\n12. Courts have repeatedly underscored the importance of documenting each stage of\n\ndetection, particularly in narcotics cases where strict scrutiny is required due to the severe\n\npenalties involved. The omission to make contemporaneous notes not only reflects non-\n\ncompliance with established procedure but also weakens the reliability of the\n\nprosecution\u2019s version.\n\n13.

Yet, they had not\n\ntrafficker would keep part of his contraband at his residence.\n\n15. These infirmities in PW2\u2019s evidence certainly cast doubt on the alleged arrest of the\n\nAppellant. More importantly, PW2 himself admitted that most of the events about which\n\nhe failed to maintain notes were of great importance. If that was so, he ought to have\n\nprovided a reasonable explanation for his failure to record those matters.\n\n16. The next ground of appeal, which is most critical to the sustainability of the conviction,\n\nconcerns the manner in which the learned Trial Judge analyzed and evaluated the\n\nevidence presented by both parties, as well as his observations regarding the burden of\n\nproof placed on the defense.\n\n17. It is discernible from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge first evaluated the\n\nevidence of the prosecution witnesses and concluded that such evidence was sufficient to\n\nestablish the charge against the Appellant. Only thereafter did he proceed to evaluate the\n\ndefense evidence. In my view, this approach is erroneous in law, particularly in light of\n\nthe legal principles enunciated in James Silva v.

It is trite law that the duty of a trial Judge is to consider all the evidence placed before the\n\nCourt, whether by the prosecution or by the defense, as a whole, and to arrive at his\n\nfindings accordingly, rather than compartmentalizing the evidence as was done in the\n\nimpugned judgment.\n\n19.

The law pertaining to the evidentiary value of a dock statement, the proper manner of its\n\narticulated in several authoritative decisions.\n\nCA/HCC/0138/2019\n\n7 | P a g e\n\n25. In Kathubdeen vs Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] (3) Sri L.R.107, it was observed:\n\nIt is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as evidence. It has\n\nalso been laid down that if the unsworn statement creates a reasonable doubt\n\nin the prosecution case or if it is believed, then the accused should be given\n\nthe benefit of that doubt.\n\n26. In Gunasiri and two others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SRI.L.R 39 it was held\n\nthat:\n\nIn evaluating a dock statement, the trial Judge must consider the following\n\nprinciples: (1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon. (2) If the\n\ndock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the defence\n\nmust succeed.\n\n27. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the dock statement, and in\n\nparticular, the imposition of a burden on the Appellant to prove it, is wholly contrary to\n\naccepted legal principles. The burden of proving a criminal charge always rests on the\n\nprosecution, and the defense is never required to prove a negative. The defense is only\n\nrequired to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In the present case, the\n\nevidence adduced by the prosecution does not discharge the burden of proving the case\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. The dock statement made by the Appellant was rejected by the\n\nlearned Trial Judge on an erroneous premise, in direct contravention of the established\n\nprinciples of law.\n\n28. In Pantis v. The Attorney General - (1998) 2 Sri L.R.148, it was held that \u201cThe burden of\n\nproof is always on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and no such\n\nduty is cast on the accused and it is sufficient for the accused to give an explanation"

As the appellant initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, the trial commenced on\n\n27.05.2024. However, during the pendency of the trial, the appellant withdrew his\n\nearlier plea and pleaded guilty to both counts. Accordingly, the learned High Court\n\nJudge convicted the appellant on both counts and sentenced him as follows:\n\na) For the first count: Ten years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.\n\n5,000/-, carrying a default sentence of three months\u2019 rigorous imprisonment.\n\nb) For the second count: Twelve years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.\n\n5,000/-, carrying a default sentence of three months\u2019 rigorous imprisonment.\n\nc) Furthermore, the learned Trial Judge ordered the appellant to pay Rs."

The learned Counsel for the appellant, at the hearing, confined his submissions solely\n\nto the question of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.\n\nAccordingly, the sole question for determination in this appeal is whether the sentence\n\nimposed on the appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle is excessive in\n\nthe circumstances of the case.\n\nBackground to the appeal:\n\n4. The victim was 16 years old at the time of the offence. On the day of the incident, he\n\nwas waiting at an isolated spot near a canal, having avoided a tuition class scheduled\n\nfor that day. It was at this point that the appellant approached him and assaulted him.\n\n5. Thereafter, the appellant asked the victim to remove his clothes and proceeded to\n\nsexually assault him by inserting his penis into the victim\u2019s anus. The appellant also\n\ncompelled the victim to perform oral sex on him, which the victim did out of fear.\n\n6. Subsequently, the appellant took Rs. 2,500 from the victim\u2019s purse and threatened to\n\nhand him over to the police. The appellant falsely represented himself as a police\n\nofficer. After the incident, the victim walked toward the town. On his way, a person in\n\na vehicle stopped and asked him why he was wet and why his clothes were muddy.\n\nThe victim then began to cry. This person took the victim to a nearby boutique and,\n\nultimately, he was handed over to his parents.\n\n7. It can be observed that, following the conviction, both the prosecution and the defence\n\nmade submissions regarding the appropriate sentence. The learned High Court Judge\n\ncarefully considered the submissions made by both parties before imposing the\n\nsentence."

The learned High Court Judge\n\ncarefully considered the submissions made by both parties before imposing the\n\nsentence.\n\nold at the time of the offence. In determining the appropriateness of the sentence for\n\noffences of this nature, the Court must consider several factors, including the age of\n\nthe victim, the age of the appellant, the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim,\n\nthe degree of violence used, the need for deterrence in society, and the past conduct of\n\nthe appellant.\n\nCA/HCC/0217/2024\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n9. Usually, courts regard the young age of an offender as a mitigating factor in the\n\nsentencing process. However, the young age of the victim cannot, by itself, be treated\n\nas a mitigating consideration when dealing with an offence of this nature. If an\n\noffender, due to youthfulness, is genuinely unable to comprehend the gravity or\n\nconsequences of the act, such immaturity may be considered in mitigation, provided\n\nthat no aggravating circumstances exist.\n\n10. In the present case, after five witnesses had testified for the prosecution, the appellant\n\nwithdrew his earlier plea and pleaded guilty to both charges. Apart from the young\n\nage of the appellant, no other mitigating factor was advanced by learned counsel\n\nduring submissions before the High Court. It must also be noted that the victim was\n\nhimself a young boy, and the offence was committed after the appellant instilled fear\n\nin him by threatening to hand him over to the police. The victim was alone and in an\n\nisolated location at the time the offence was committed.\n\n11. Culpability will be increased where an offender deliberately targets a victim due to an\n\nactual or perceived vulnerability. Likewise, culpability is further aggravated where the\n\nvictim\u2019s vulnerability is created or exacerbated by the offender\u2019s own actions."

Furthermore, it is necessary to accentuate that sexual violence victims often\n\nexperience a deep sense of shame, stigma and violation. Given the fact that sexual\n\nviolence is a degrading, humiliating and brutal invasion of the security of the person,\n\na victim is most often left with psychological injuries that are far more serious and\n\ndifficult to detect than physical injuries.\n\n19. Furthermore, it is worthy to note that crimes of this nature are on the rise, and the\n\nLegislature, in its wisdom, has prescribed stringent sentences in order to ensure\n\ndeterrence, particularly with a view to protecting children.

But, in this instance there is yet\n\nanother ground upon which this application for revision ought to be exercised\n\nand that is that the petitioner had no knowledge of the order made against him\n\ntill the time for preferring an appeal had elapsed.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Podi Singho 51 NLR 385 it was held that\n\n\u201ceven though the revisionary powers should not be exercised in cases when\n\nthere is an appeal and was not taken, the revisionary powers should be\n\nexercised only in exceptional circumstances such as (a) miscarriage of justice\n\nCA/PHC/0043/2019\n\nPage 11 of 16\n\n(b) where a strong case for interference by the Supreme Court is made out or (c)\n\nwhere the applicant was unaware of the order.\u201d Court also observes that \u201cthe\n\nSupreme Court in exercising its powers of revision is not hampered by\n\ntechnical rules of pleading and procedure.\u201d\n\nSee also; Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd.\n\n1978 (1) SLR 05, Janita Vs. Abeysekara (Sri skantha Law Report Vol iv\n\nPage 22), and Thilagaratnam Vs. Edirisinghe 1982 (1) SLR 56.\n\nIn the light of the principle laid down by Court in the aforesaid decisions, an\n\nAppellate Court can exercise its revisionary jurisdiction conferred on the\n\nAppellate Court only and only, in exceptional circumstances, where an\n\nalternative remedy lay. [emphasis is mine]\n\nSection 67(1) and (2) of the Act enacts thus;\n\n\u201c(1) Every inquiry under this Part shall be held in a summary manner"

Although this information was communicated to PW1, he\n\nhad not noted down such information in his note book.

As such, the Learned\n\nCounsel who represented the Appellant at the trial court had objected to\n\nleading the evidence pertaining to receiving the information, on the basis of\n\nhearsay evidence. After considering the submissions of both parties, the\n\nlearned trial judge had disallowed the objection and permitted the\n\nprosecution to lead the evidence.\n\nAccording to the information, a person called Nalinda, was expected to traffic\n\nheroin from \u2018Kotahena Watta\u2019 to Sugathadasa Stadium. The informer had\n\nfurther said that he could meet the police officers at a place called\n\n\u2018Galpalliya\u2019. A police team was organised, excluding the police officer who\n\nhad initially received the information. At 8.30 hours the police team had met\n\nthe informant at the said place. After obtaining further information, PW1 and\n\nPW2 had hired a three-wheeler and gone to inspect the place from where the\n\nAppellant was supposed to come from. The informer had accompanied them\n\nas well. After ascertaining the \u2018Watta\u2019 the police officers had waited close to\n\na temple called \u2018Sumithrarama\u2019 and the informant had gone to the \u2018Watta\u2019 to\n\nprovide further information to the police.

Accordingly, in this context,\n\nthe phrase \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\" indicates that the evidence and\n\narguments brought forward by the prosecution to establish the defendant\u2019s\n\nguilt must be done so clearly, in a manner that it is accepted as fact by any\n\nrational person.\n\nIn the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V.

If not, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of the\n\ncharges. The prosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot\n\nderive any strength from the weaknesses in the defence, and when the\n\nguilt of the accused is not established beyond reasonable doubt, he is\n\nliable to be acquitted as a matter of right and not as a matter of grace or\n\nfavour.\u201d"

V. State of M.P., AIR [2007] SCW 5589\n\n(2007) 7 SCC 625, it was observed:\n\n\u201cIt is well-settled that credibility of witness has to be tested on the\n\ntouchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite possible that\n\nin a given case, a Court of Law may not base conviction solely on the\n\nevidence of Complainant or a Police Official but it is not the law that\n\npolice witnesses should not be relied upon and their evidence cannot be\n\naccepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars by other\n\nindependent evidence. The presumption that every person acts honestly\n\napplies as much in favour of a Police Official as any other person. No\n\ninfirmity attaches to the testimony of Police Officials merely because\n\nthey belong to Police Force. There is no rule of law which lays down that\n\nno conviction can be recorded on the testimony of Police Officials even if\n\nsuch evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy. The rule of\n\nprudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the\n\nCourt is convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of\n\ntruth, conviction can be based on such evidence\u201d.\n\nIn Attorney General v. Devunderage Nihal [2011] 1 SLR 409 the court held\n\nthat:\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement in law that a particular number of witnesses\n\nshall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. Unlike in a case\n\nwhere an accomplice or a decoy is concerned, in any other case there is\n\nno requirement in law that the evidence of a Police Officer who\n\nconducted an investigation or raid resulting in the arrest of an offender\n\nneed to be corroborated on material particulars.\n\nHowever, caution must be exercised by a trial Judge in evaluating such"

Therefore,\n\nas the investigative arm of the state, the police bear the primary and\n\nmandatory responsibility to acquire such evidence as accurately as possible,\n\nwithout any contradictions.\n\nThe learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the evidence given by\n\nPW1 and PW2 contradict each other on material points regarding the place\n\nof arrest. According to PW1, the Appellant and the other person were arrested\n\nnear \u2018Sumithrarama Temple\u2019 when they came to a \u2018Watta\u2019. According to PW2,\n\nthe Appellant was arrested while the duo was coming from \u2018Sumithrarama\n\nWatta\u2019. According to the original information, the Appellant was supposed to\n\nhave come from \u2018Kotahena Watta\u2019.\n\nNext, the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that PW1 and PW2\n\nalso contradicted each other regarding the existence of a three-way junction\n\nnear the temple. PW1 in his evidence told the Court that he has no knowledge\n\nabout the three-way junction. PW2 in his evidence stated that the road that\n\nleads to \u2018Watta\u2019 was situated when proceeding straight, after passing the\n\ntemple.\n\nConsidering these contradictory positions taken by PW1 and PW2 regarding\n\nthe place of arrest, the outcome of the case will most definitely be affected.\n\nLegal provisions and various judicial precedents have made it clear that\n\nomissions and contradictions are one of the ways to shake the credibility of\n\nCA/HCC/0005/20222\n\n11 | P a g e\n\na witness.

A compensation of Rs. 100,000/- was\n\nordered to be paid to the victim; in default, a term of 1 year of rigorous imprisonment.\n\nFurthermore, the appellants were acquitted with the 2nd and 3rd counts.\n\nPage 3 of 9\n\nAppellant has preferred this appeal to this court. The grounds of appeal as pleaded by the\n\nAppellant are as follows;\n\ni. The Hon. High Court Judge misdirected himself and erred in failing to consider\n\nthe uncertainty surrounding the first information of the alleged offence. The\n\nconflicting evidence as to how and when the complaint originated was not\n\nproperly examined. This constitutes a vital misdirection affecting the fairness\n\nof the trial.\n\nii. The Hon. High Court Judge failed to consider the legal presumption under\n\nSection 114(t) of the Evidence Ordinance arising from the suppression of\n\nmaterial witnesses.\n\nThe omission to consider this presumption constitutes a serious misdirection\n\nin law.\n\niii. By omitting to evaluate the absence of conclusive medical corroboration, the\n\nHon. High Court Judge erred in law and misdirected himself on a material\n\naspect of the case.\n\niv. The Hon. High Court Judge erred by failing to consider the wider context of\n\nfamily conflict and prolonged institutional care, which could have influenced\n\nthe testimony and credibility of PW1, leading to miscarriage of justice.\n\nv. The Hon. High Court Judge erred in failing to consider the need for\n\ncorroboration of the child's testimony, especially given the inconsistencies and\n\nsurrounding circumstances that warranted such caution.\n\nvi. The Hon. High Court Judge erred in rejecting the dock statement solely for\n\nlack of prior cross-examination, without assessing its independent probative\n\nvalue.\n\nvii. The non consideration of the \"ghost factor\" amounts to a misdirection and an\n\nerror on the part of the Hon. High Court Judge, as it reflects a failure to engage\n\nwith a plausible alternative explanation.\n\nPage 4 of 9"

She stated that she had agreed to make the payments in order to continue\n\nPW 3, who thereafter reported the incident to the Bribery Commission.\n\nDuring cross\u2011examination, PW 2 admitted that when she accompanied PW 1 to the\n\nAppellant\u2019s office, she was unable to hear the conversation that took place between PW 1\n\nand the Appellant.\n\nPW 3, Ajith Kumara, an officer of the Bribery Commission, together with SI Livera\n\nDuglas Perera, PW 4, received information regarding the Appellant\u2019s demand and\n\nproceeded to conduct the raid. He further stated that several other officers accompanied\n\nhim and assisted in carrying out the raid. Upon reaching the location, the officers recorded\n\na statement from PW 1, thereby formally documenting his account before proceeding with\n\nthe raid.\n\nPW 3 further stated that he accompanied PW 1 as a decoy during the raid.

At that time, the appellant went to the rear side of the\n\nhouse and attempted to run, but the witness pursued and arrested him. Subsequently,\n\nAfter the prosecution concluded, the appellant testified that he had long known PW1, who\n\nis disabled. He stated that he had helped PW1 obtain artificial limbs without expecting\n\nany benefit. Upon learning of a government donation scheme to assist disabled persons in\n\nbuilding houses, the appellant informed PW1 and recommended his name to the\n\nDivisional Secretariat. Once PW1\u2019s eligibility was confirmed by the Secretariat, the\n\nappellant conveyed the information to PW1 and provided the necessary instructions.\n\nBecause PW1 could not read or write, the appellant prepared a letter in format for\n\nsubmission to the Divisional Secretariat. On Monday, PW1, accompanied by another\n\nperson, brought the letter to the appellant\u2019s office and handed it over before leaving.\n\nShortly afterwards, the appellant went to his tea estate, where a group of officers arrived\n\nand arrested him.\n\nAfter being arrested by bribery officers and taken to his office, the appellant was\n\nquestioned about the money that was recovered from the documents. He denied any\n\nknowledge of it, stating that he had never received money from PW1 and suggesting that\n\nPW1 may have secretly placed it there. The appellant further claimed that PW5 had a\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\npersonal dispute with him and had deliberately made a false complaint to implicate him\n\nin a crime.\n\nWe note that according to PW 1, the money was kept under a black bag. However, the\n\nAppellant contends that the money was actually recovered from his documents. The\n\nquestion that arises is whether, when the Appellant was present, it was probable for PW1\n\nto conceal the money in the said room without his knowledge. This inconsistency casts\n\ndoubt on the reliability of the testimony."

Petitioners further state that the waste from the 1st petitioner's manufacturing process could have been disposed ofby dumping or incineration; however, such methods would harm the environment. To prevent this, the waste is recycled by Polydime International Pvt. Ltd., (a sister company of the 1st petitioner company) and used for the production of plastic products (not 1st-grade products).\n\nIn 2022, Sri Lanka Customs commenced an inquiry into the waste generated in the 1st petitioner company's export production process. The 2nd respondent functioned as the Inquiring Officer. The said inquiry concluded on 24-05-2022. The decision of the 2nd respondent is as follows:\n\nHaving considered the context of the inquiry and the plea of Mr D.M.R. Tranchell, the Managing Director of M/s. Overdime Exports Pvt Ltd., I make the following order:\n\n1. I declare forfeit an amount of Polythene waste of 4,330,937kg valued at\n\nRs. 88,673,404/=, in terms of Section 50A (1) of the Customs Ordinance. However, as the goods are not available at this stage, I declare forfeit an amount of Rs. 266,020,212/=, being the treble of the value of goods in terms of section 50A (2) of the Customs Ordinance and mitigate it to recover Rs. 29,000,000/= from M/s.

The petitioners contend that it is unfair to inquire into the disposal of waste for the previous nine years. The 2nd respondent arbitrarily decided that the amount of polythene waste is 4,330,937 Kgs valued at 88,673,404/- in terms of Section 50A of the Customs Ordinance. Physically, there was no such waste in the possession of the petitioner. He decided to recover Rs. 29.0 million as a mitigated amount under Sections 50A (2) and 163 of the Customs Ordinance. There was no real basis to arrive at the above figures. As discussed above, the customs duties have not been exempted for the inputs imported under the TIEP-1 scheme. Secondly, there were no conditions stipulated regarding the disposal of waste in the TIEP-1 scheme. Therefore, the respondents did not have a jurisdiction to act under Section 50A of the Customs Ordinance. In the above circumstances, the Court decides that the decision of the 2nd respondent dated 24-05-2022 was made without jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court issues Writs of Certiorari as prayed for in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of the prayer to the petition.\n\nApplication allowed.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal\n\nDr. S. Premachandra J. I agree. Judge of the Court of Appeal."

Therefore, the 1st Respondent has failed to follow the rules\n\nof natural justice.\n\nThe second argument advanced by Mr. Weraduwage is that the 5th Respondent has failed to register\n\nthe succession within 3 months from the death of the original grantee. Therefore, the registering\n\nof the succession reflected in X11 is ultra vires.\n\nThe third argument is that the succession is registered in terms of the entire land, whereas the\n\ntestamentary action was filed in respect of only a kumburu land. Therefore, the 1st Respondent is\n\nnot empowered to register the succession.\n\n5\n\nHowever, Dr. Gunaratne argued that there is no application by the Petitioner to succeed to the\n\ngrantee\u2019s rights after his death. Therefore, there is no necessity to hold an inquiry by the 1st\n\nRespondent. Secondly, he argued that there was no complaint until X11 was registered by the\n\nPetitioner. Further, he argued that the Petitioner is guilty of misrepresentation or non-\n\nrepresentation material facts, as borne out by 5R(5) and 5R(2).\n\nHowever, on the other hand, Mr. Mahaarachchi argued that X8, the order of the testamentary action\n\nbearing No. T/29/2004, clearly indicates that, as the 3rd Respondent, the Petitioner also participated\n\nin the proceedings. Therefore, she is well aware that a testamentary action was instituted in respect\n\nof the entirety of the land alienated under X3 to the original grantee. Therefore, even the District\n\nJudge has considered that fact, and no objection was raised by the Petitioner in that application.\n\nFurther, he argued that, in terms of Sections 63, 64, and 65 of the Ordinance, the 5th Respondent\n\nhad taken steps to have the Last Will propounded in District Court and given notice to the"

This is clearly explained with mental pictures and graphic\n\ntouches by Charles Dickens2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, after the institution of the said Testamentary action in the District Court, it\n\nhas taken more than three months, as the record indicates; nevertheless, it is my view that the 5th\n\nRespondent has taken all the necessary steps within his prerogative and ability to propound the\n\nLast Will left by the testator, his father, to propound the same and obtain probate.

Therefore, even Section 64 needs to be read not only subject to Section\n\n2 Charles Dickens \u201cBleak House\u201d (1852), Jarndyce v Jarndyce\n\n12\n\n65(1), but also the law provided for in Chapter XXXVIII of the Civil Procedure Code.

The general principle is that the law allows only reasonable force to be used in the\n\ncircumstances and, what is reasonable is to be judged in the light of the circumstances\n\nas the accused believed them to be (whether reasonably or not).\n\n12. In assessing whether a defendant had used only reasonable force, Lord Morris\n\nin Palmer v R [1971] AC 814, felt that a jury should be directed to look at the\n\nparticular facts and circumstances of the case. His Lordship made the following\n\npoints:\n\nA person who is being attacked should not be expected to \u201cweigh to a nicety\n\nthe exact measure of his necessary defensive action\u201d.\n\nCA/HCC/0027/2022\n\n5 | P a g e\n\nIf the jury thought that in the heat of the moment the defendant did what he\n\nhonestly and instinctively thought was necessary then that would be strong\n\nevidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.\n\nA jury will be told that the defence of self-defence will only fail if the\n\nprosecution shows beyond reasonable doubt that what the accused did was not\n\nby way of self-defence.\n\n13. When the observations of the learned trial Judge are examined in the light of the legal\n\nprinciples set out above, it becomes necessary to carefully analyse and evaluate the\n\nevidence of the eyewitnesses, who testified before the High Court, as well as the\n\ndefence evidence, in particular that of the defence witness Manju.\n\n14.

Manju was also called as a defence witness.

There is no evidence to suggest that the appellant harboured any animosity towards\n\nthe deceased despite the earlier attack, nor is there any material to indicate that the\n\nappellant had premeditated the present incident. Equally, there is no evidence of any\n\nrecent quarrel, argument, or scuffle between the appellant and the deceased prior to\n\nthe occurrence.\n\n25. The appellant\u2019s evidence, though containing certain omissions, adequately explained\n\nthe circumstances under which he came into possession of a knife.

It is also significant to note that the subsequent conduct of the appellant is indicative\n\nsudden fear. The appellant had sufficient opportunity to flee the area had he intended\n\nto evade arrest. Instead, he was apprehended while hiding in an abandoned building,\n\nand at the time of arrest he appeared fearful, offered no resistance, and made no\n\nattempt to escape. Such conduct is inconsistent with a premeditated or calculated act.\n\n28.

Moreover, the evidence of the defence witness Manju, to the effect that the deceased\n\nhabitually carried a knife and was armed with one at the relevant time, when\n\nconsidered in conjunction with the threatening words uttered by the deceased, lends\n\nfurther credence to the appellant\u2019s version. Taken together, these circumstances\n\nsubstantiate the appellant\u2019s contention that he acted under a genuine and reasonable\n\napprehension of imminent bodily harm at the hands of the deceased.\n\n35. However, this Court cannot lose sight of the extent of the force employed by the\n\nappellant against the deceased, which, in the circumstances of the case, appears to be\n\nexcessive and disproportionate to the threat apprehended. Consequently, this Court is\n\nnot persuaded to grant the appellant a complete exoneration from criminal liability.\n\n36. In the light of the foregoing analysis, this Court is of the view that the learned trial\n\nJudge erred in wholly rejecting the appellant\u2019s plea of private defence. The evidence\n\nestablishes that the appellant acted under a genuine apprehension of imminent bodily\n\nharm and that the incident occurred suddenly, without premeditation. Nevertheless,\n\nhaving regard to the number and nature of the injuries inflicted, the force used by the\n\nCA/HCC/0027/2022\n\n10 | P a g e"

On the same day, while the deceased was driving his\n\nthree-wheeler from Embilipitiya to Panagoda, it had collided with the\n\nAppellant\u2019s van which was heading towards the opposite side. The stance of\n\nthe prosecution is that the Appellant had deliberately collided with the three-\n\nwheeler and committed the murder of the deceased.\n\nThe Appellant from the inception of the trial, took up the position that the\n\nincident was purely accidental. In his dock statement, he had taken up the\n\nposition that when he was driving towards Embilipitiya, a truck had\n\novertaken his vehicle recklessly. In order to avoid the said vehicle, when he\n\nmoved his vehicle from the left side to the right, it collided with a three-\n\nwheeler. According to him, until he saw the deceased, he was not aware that\n\nthe injured was his father-in-law. He had taken quick steps to admit the\n\ndeceased to the hospital and had remained at the place of the incident until\n\nthe arrival of the police.\n\nThe learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that there is no evidence\n\nwhatsoever that the Appellant knew the deceased would be travelling along\n\nthat route in his three-wheeler.\n\nTherefore, the learned Counsel appealing to this court, claimed that it is\n\nmore appropriate to convict under culpable homicide not amounting to\n\nmurder under 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of knowledge in this case.\n\nThe learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent, upholding the\n\nhighest tradition of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, conceded that the\n\nAppellant cannot be convicted for murder.\n\nCA/HCC/0269/23\n\n4 | P a g e\n\nIn this case the defence was unable to place any evidence regarding the"

Under these circumstances, the learned High Court Judge\n\nshould have directed his mind to the circumstances and considered the fact\n\nthat the Appellant is entitled to have the benefit of the lesser verdict.\n\nIn The King v Bellana Vithanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:\n\n\"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury the\n\nalternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not\n\namounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the\n\nevidence on record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon\n\nby the accused.\u201d\n\nAnalysing the evidence presented in this case it clearly demonstrates that\n\nthe events described above do not establish the existence of a murderous\n\nintention. The evidence clearly shows that the stressful events and the\n\nstrained relationship between the Appellant and the deceased had not\n\nresulted in the unfortunate incident. The Learned High Court Judge had\n\nfailed to consider the non-existence of the murderous intention of the\n\nAppellant.\n\nAt present the Appellant is suffering from fatty liver Grade II along with an\n\nabdominal condition. He also has to support his elderly parents. His pre-\n\ndetention period of remand has run for more than one year. At present he is\n\nin remand pending appeal since 09.11.2023.\n\nConsidering all the circumstances stressed before this court, I conclude that\n\nit is appropriate to consider this case under Section 297 of the Penal Code\n\non the basis of knowledge only, for the Appellant\u2019s benefit.\n\nHence, I set aside the death sentence and convict the Appellant for culpable\n\nhomicide not amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal Code\n\n(second limb). I sentence the Appellant for 04 years rigorous imprisonment"

Accordingly, they request orders directing the 1st\n\nRespondent to demolish the unlawful construction or bring it into regulatory\n\nconformity, restraining the issuance of further approvals, and compelling the\n\nproduction of all relevant correspondence and documents from the Respondents\n\nto ensure a just and lawful outcome.

One satisfactory way to explain the\n\ndelay is for the petitioner to show that he has been seeking relief elsewhere\n\nin a manner provided by the Law.\n\nWhen the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order\n\ncomplained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction, the Court\n\nwould be loath to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject the\n\napplication simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very\n\nextraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority\n\nPage14\n\nconcerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court\n\nmay grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows\n\nthat he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In Any such event,\n\nthe explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically.\n\n\"Recent practice clearly indicates that where the proceedings were a nullity\n\nan award of Certiorari will not readily be denied\" - de Smith - Judicial\n\nReview - 4th Ed. page 426.\n\nIn this connection, Professor Wade in his \"Administrative Law\" 4th Ed. at\n\npage 561 states\n\n\"the discretion to withhold remedy against unlawful action may make\n\ninroads upon the rule of Law and must therefore be exercised with the\n\ngreatest care. In any normal case the remedy accompanies the right, but\n\nthe fact that a person aggrieved is entitled to Certiorari ex debito justitiae\n\ndoes not alter the fact that a Court has power to exercise the discretion\n\nagainst him, as it may in the case of any discretionary remedy.\""

In Perera v. Ranatunge, 66NLR 337,\n\nHis Lordship BASNAYAKE, C. J, held that a negative servitude for a view or\n\nlight cannot be acquired by mere long enjoyment or prescription. A\n\nlandowner is generally presumed to be a building on their land for their own\n\nconvenience and profit and cannot be prevented from building higher by an\n\nadjacent landowner unless a formal legal agreement exists. [Emphasis is added]\n\n42] In D. H. MOOSAJEE, vs Y. CAROLIS SILVA, 70 NLR 217, His Lordship H.\n\nN. G. FERNANDO, C.J. held that servitude of light and air, window light, a\n\nNegative servitude that bare enjoyment cannot create a prescriptive title under\n\nsection 3 of the Prescription Ordinance (Cap. 68).\n\n43] Thus, it is crystal clear that the Petitioners have no standing on an\n\ninfringement of private right, nor do they have any legal standing that they do\n\nnot put forward this as public interest litigation. If this allowed a person in\n\nKandy to point out a premise in Colombo that had been built in violation of the\n\nregulations and to seek a writ for demolition. If so, it would lead to uncertainty\n\nand would open floodgates.\n\n44] In the case of Vasana Vs. Incorporated Council of Legal Education and\n\nothers [2004] 1 SLR 163 Gamini Amaratunga J stated in this regard as follows:\n\n\" ... A writ of mandamus is available against a public or a statutory body\n\nperforming statutory duties of a public character.

In GEEGANAGE v. DIRECTOR GENERAL OF CUSTOMS,\n\n[2001] 3 Sri L.R. 179, U. DE Z. GUNAWARDANA, J. held;\n\n\"If a certain decision is left unchallenged, it will be accepted and enforced\n\nas if it were valid. Only a decision of a Court can establish its nullity. One\n\nignores the void decision at one's peril and with ouster and time - limit\n\nclauses coming into vogue, effluxion of time can prevent a challenge to a\n\nnullity being ever mounted after the stipulated period.\n\n46] In Weligamawa Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd. vs.\n\nChandradasa Daluwatta [1984] 1 S.L.R. 195 stressed that a writ of\n\nmandamus should be issued to secure the performance of a public duty, in the\n\nperformance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. The public duty\n\nsought to be enforced must be of a public nature stemming from a statute,\n\ncharter, the common law or custom, and cannot be of a merely private character.\n\n47] Sansoni J. observed in Samaraweera vs. Balasuriya 58 NLR 118 (at p.120)\n\n\u201cIt is trite law that Mandamus is only available to compel the doing of a\n\nduty not done, and not on the ground that the duty had been done\n\nerroneously.\u201d\n\n48] It should be stressed that Mandamus will not be available where there has\n\nbeen a valid exercise of power, merely because the Petitioner believes that the\n\ndiscretion has been exercised erroneously by the Respondents. Till P34, there\n\nwas no evidence. However, as I observed, P34 was done in breach of the rules of\n\nnatural justice and vehemently disputed by the 1st Respondent parties."

Further,\n\nas de Smith says in his work \"Judicial Review of Administrative Action\", 4th Ed.\n\n(1980) p. 404:\n\n\"Thus, certiorari is a discretionary remedy and may be withheld if the\n\nconduct if the applicant, or, it would seem, the nature of the error does not\n\njustify judicial intervention\".\n\n81] In P.

In the instant case, the evidence of PW9, who was responsible for delivering the\n\nproductions from the Magistrate Court to the Government Analyst Department, is\n\nfraught with infirmities that go to the very root of the prosecution case. These lapses\n\nhave irreparably undermined the credibility of the prosecution evidence, yet,\n\nregrettably, they appear to have escaped the attention of the learned High Court Judge.\n\n26. Furthermore, the out-entry made by PW9 is recorded as 22.15 hours on 21.02.2013,\n\nwhereas he left for the Government Analyst\u2019s Department only on 22.02.2013,\n\nthereby contradicting his own testimony.

I find that after the\n\npetition of appeal was filed the proctor for the accused made an\n\napplication for bail. This application was refused by the District\n\nJudge on the ground that the accused was a habitual criminal. In\n\nmaking this order the learned District Judge has evidently over-\n\nlooked the provisions of section 341 of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\nby which a Court is bound to make an order for the release on bail\n\nof every convicted person who prefers an appeal. Habitual criminals\n\nare not excluded from the privilege granted by this section\u201d.\n\nAnalysing this judgement, it is revealed that no discretion has been\n\nvested in a Magistrate or a Judge of District Court to determine whether\n\na convicted accused should be released on bail or not.\n\nHowever, in cases decided under the Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance,\n\nwhich was in existence till 1973, the court held a different principle in\n\ndeciding bail pending appeal.\n\nIn King v Keerala (1942) 48 NLR the Court held that:\n\n\u201cI am unable to allow this application on the grounds stated above\n\nThis court does not grant applications for bail in the absence of\n\nexceptional circumstances\u201d.\n\nIn King v Cooray (1950) 51 NLR 360 the Court held that:\n\n\u201cRelease on bail will only be granted in cases pending appeal in\n\nexceptional circumstances. Having considered this matter carefully,\n\nI consider that there are in these case exceptional circumstances\n\nwhere I am justified in granting the application\u201d.\n\nIn R v Muthuretty (1953) 54 NLR 43 the Court held that;\n\n\u201cIn bail pending appeal, court will not grant bail as a rule.

    "chunk_text": "In Attorney General v Ediriweera (Supra) Shiranee Thilakawardena, J.\n\nheld that:\n\n\u201cIn an application for bail after conviction the Appellate Court should\n\nnot pre-empt the hearing of substantive appeal and pronounced\n\na matter solely to be determined by the Appellate Court hearing the\n\nAppeal\u201d.\n\nThe Court further held:\n\n\u201c\u2026in the case of Ramu Thamodarampillai v Attorney General (SC\n\n141/75) the court followed the well-recognised and uninterrupted\n\npractice of not granting bail pending Appeal to any convict sentenced\n\nto a term of imprisonment of Seven years or more and that this\n\nshould be a norm to be adhered to\u2026\u201d.\n\nThe High Court Judge in his impugned order had very correctly and\n\naccurately considered the applicable law and legal norms and come to a\n\ncorrect finding that the Petitioner had failed to demonstrate the existence\n\nof exceptional circumstances. Although the learned Counsel for the\n\nPetitioner submitted that the Petitioner was sentenced to 10 years of\n\nimprisonment, upon examination of the judgement delivered in HC\n\nColombo Case No.7259/2014, the Petitioner had been sentenced to 12\n\nyears and six months imprisonment.\n\nIn Bank of Ceylon v Kaleel and Others [2004] 1 SLR 284 it was held\n\nthat:\n\n\u201cIn any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order\n\nchallenged must have occasioned a failure of justice and be\n\nmanifestly erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or\n\nirregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it-the\n\nCA PHC APN 102/2024\n\n14 | P a g e\n\norder complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked\n\nthe conscience of court\u201d.\n\nConsidering all the factors submitted above, I see no reason to revise the\n\norder of the learned judge of the High Court of Colombo. I too agree that\n\nthe Petitioner had failed to demonstrate the existence of exceptional\n\ncircumstances to the satisfaction of the court.\n\nFurther, I conclude that the material submitted by the Petitioner has\n\nfailed to shock the conscience of this court. As such, I dismiss this"

If the 2nd Respondent had acted in accordance with clause 6(f) of SLNO 0501 (skipping steps set out in clauses 6(g) to 6 (n)) and arrived at the verdict, I may have been inclined to consider such position. However, he had not done so. After recording the Petitioner\u2019s plea of guilt, the 2nd Respondent had nevertheless proceeded to record evidence. Since he had elected to record evidence and hear the case, in my view he was obliged to arrive at a finding based on the evidence led and indicate reasons for same in accordance with clause 6(n) of SLNO 0501.

If the statutory authority violates the mandatory procedural provisions of the statute, the act of the statutory authority would be invalidated. The 2nd respondent acting under Section 42 has authority to impose certain punishments indicated therein. It is not legal nor proper for the 2nd respondent to issue recommendations or advisory sermons to the Commander of the Army in respect of matters which are exclusively not within the ambit of Sec. 42.\n\nIt is observed that section 28(2) of the Navy Act would be comparable to the said section 42 of the Army Act.

This is the first time our company has encountered such an issue, and we assure you that it was not intentional.\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\nThe Petitioners challenge the validity of the enforcement of CITES in Sri Lanka by regulations made under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act without any statute (legislative enactment) in the light of the Supreme Court decision Singarasa Vs. Attorney General [2013] 1 Sri LR 245. On the principle enumerated in the above Singarasa Case, an international treaty or covenant could be given effect domestically by Parliament passing a Statue by exercising its legislative power.\n\n\u201cTherefore, when the President, in terms of customary international law, acts for the Republic and enters into a treaty or accedes to a covenant the content of which is not inconsistent with the Constitution or the written law, the act of the President will bind the Republic qua State. But such a treaty or a covenant has to be implemented by the exercise of legislative power by Parliament, and where found to be necessary by the People at a Referendum to have internal effect and attribute rights and duties to individuals. This is in keeping with the dualist theory which underpins our Constitution as reasoned out in the preceding analysis.\u201d\n\nIn the instant application, it is apparent that there is no such Statue which gives effect to the CITES. The regulations published in the Gazette No.2023/51 were made under Section 61(1)(u) of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act.\n\nProf. Wade states that \u201calthough there may be so many instances of the principle of ultra vires being infringed, the courts intervene only where the thing done goes beyond what can fairly be treated as incidental or consequential to the statutory powers vested with the respective authority. \u201c(Administrative Law, H.W.R.

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295 and Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v.

The validity of such a Gazette notification does not become ab initio void automatically and will stand unless and until such Gazette is set aside by a competent court.\n\nHence, it is my view that the decision reflected in the document marked P9 dated 11.11.2024 does not bear any illegality and I see no reason to interfere with said decision.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I do not wish to grant any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the Petition.

    "chunk_text": "\u201cWe sincerely regret this oversight, which occurred due to a misunderstanding of the regulatory requirements. This is the first time our company has encountered such an issue, and we assure you that it was not intentional.\n\nThe Petitioners challenge the validity of the enforcement of CITES in Sri Lanka by regulations made under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act without any\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\nstatute (legislative enactment) in the light of the Supreme Court decision Singarasa v. Attorney General [2013] 1 Sri LR 245. On the principle enumerated in the above Singarasa Case, an international treaty or covenant could be given effect domestically by Parliament passing a Statue by exercising its legislative power.\n\n\u201cTherefore, when the President, in terms of customary international law, acts for the Republic and enters into a treaty or accedes to a covenant the content of which is not inconsistent with the Constitution or the written law, the act of the President will bind the Republic qua State. But such a treaty or a covenant has to be implemented by the exercise of legislative power by Parliament, and where found to be necessary by the People at a Referendum to have internal effect and attribute rights and duties to individuals. This is in keeping with the dualist theory which underpins our Constitution as reasoned out in the preceding analysis.\u201d\n\nIn the instant application, it is apparent that there is no such Statue which gives effect to the CITES. The regulations published in the Gazette No.2023/51 were made under Section 61(1)(u) of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act.\n\nProf. Wade states that, \u201calthough there may be so many instances of the principle of ultra vires being infringed, the courts intervene only where the thing done goes beyond what can fairly be treated as incidental or consequential to the statutory powers vested with the respective authority.\u201d(Administrative Law, H.W.R.

Wade & C.F. Forsyth, 11th edition at p. 178)\n\nWade further goes on to state that the court would intervene only where \u201cthe relevant considerations neglected or the irrelevant considerations adopted are so\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\nserious as to put the decision outside the powers of the statute.\u201d (Administrative Law, H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth, 11th edition at p. 339)\n\nTherefore, in exercising the regulatory powers vested with the Minister by the Statute, the Minister may adopt certain frameworks, standards or guidelines so long as those do not fall outside the powers of the statute.\n\nIn spite of the above, where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial purposes, the illegality must be established before a court. Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th ed., South Asian Edition (2017), at page 185,\n\n\"An act by a public authority which lacks legal authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its illegality is established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will be regarded as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it will be regarded as incapable of ever having produced legal effects.\"\n\nIn Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council (1956) AC 736,769-770, Lord Radcliffe held:\n\n\u201cAn order, even if not made in good faith, is still an act capable of legal consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders.\u201d"

Secondly, does the Petitioner have title to the land?\n\nIf the LRC has title to the land, then the Petitioner\u2019s claim has to fail and vice versa.

Hence, the said deed is valid and the land depicted in Schedule \u201cB\u201d of the said deed could not have vested with the LRC.\n\nFurther, this Court also observes that subsequently the Petitioner pleads that there had been another litigation between the Petitioner and his father\u2019s brother and sister, one Abeysuriya Pattabandige Mathius Silva and Abeysuriya Pattabandige Seminona. The said Abeysuriya Pattabandige Mathius Silva is the father of the 6th ,7th and 8th Respondents whereby the said father of the above-mentioned Respondents had claimed title, and, to resolve the dispute the Petitioner\u2019s mother on behalf of the Petitioner had instituted a District Court action as the Petitioner was a minor. In the said circumstances it appears when the deed P2 was executed the Petitioner had to be a minor as the said deed was executed prior to the District Court case bearing no 3447/L. However, the deed P2 does not bear the beneficiary as a minor.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that the signatures had been placed on the deed on 07.08.1972. However, curiously, the date of attestation is 07.09.1972 which is after one month from the date parties have signed the deed. It is also pertinent to note that the Law came into operation on 26.08.1972.\n\n12"

In adjudicating the dispute, as correctly submitted by the Counsel for the Respondent, the presence of Thirumal is necessary. In the circumstances, I am inclined to agree that for the proper adjudication and for establishment of the Petitioner\u2019s case, the said Thirumal becomes a necessary party and the Petitioner has failed to bring in necessary parties.\n\nMaterial facts are in dispute\n\nAs stated above, the Petitioner is claiming his title by virtue of the deed marked as P2. However, as I have observed elsewhere in the Schedule to P2, the boundaries for North, South and West for the land claimed by the Petitioner are not demarcated other than to state that it is the remaining portion of the larger land. Hence, the boundaries for the so-called land are in dispute.\n\nIn the absence of proper demarcation, the Petitioner would first have to establish the correct boundary of his land out of the larger land to stake any claim. Hence, the portion the Petitioner owns becomes a disputed fact."

Hence, in my view the Petitioner after sleeping over his rights since 1985 now cannot stake a claim to a land so vested which is nearly after more than few decades of the publication of 1R5. Especially, the Petitioner should have staked a claim to the 1st Respondent whose head office is situated in Colombo. Hence, even if we are to consider that the land could have been in an area where there was an armed conflict in the year 1985, it does not deter the Petitioner from acting pursuant to section 13 and 1R5 and making his claim to the 1st Respondent, whose head office is situated in Colombo.\n\nLet me now consider the Petitioner\u2019s prayers.\n\nThe prayers\n\nThe Petitioner in prayer (c) is seeking for a Writ of Certiorari to quash any order or decision of the 1st Respondent deeming that that the corpus which was decreed to the Petitioner by the Batticaloa District Court case vested with the 1st Respondent has to\n\n21\n\nfail for the above stated reasons.

The said entry corresponds with the grant depicting the highland. All parties conceded that the dispute is concerning the highland. The original grantee, one Subhaya too has expired in the year 2000. It is also contended by the Petitioners that though the children of the original grantor Subhaya were in possession of the lands, none of the children have taken steps to be appointed as the successor until the year 2020. It is also not disputed that the eldest son of Subhaya, namely, Wimaladasa had not staked a claim to the highland. However, subsequent to the death of Wilmaladasa, a dispute arose between the children pertaining to the succession to the grant depicted in P11, which is the highland.\n\nAt this stage, it is pertinent to note that all parties before this Court conceded that the dispute is confined to the highland which is depicted in grant P1.\n\nSuccession to the deceased grantor\n\nIt is common ground that when Subhaya died in the year 2000, he had not nominated a successor to the highland depicted in P1. However, it was also not disputed that before obtaining the grant on 13.09.1994, Subhaya had been in possession of the land depicted in Pe1, on the strength of a permit and as stated above, Subhaya has nominated 3 successors to the highland. It is pertinent to note that in the absence of a specific nomination in the grant, this Court has constantly held that a nomination made for the permit is considered a nomination for the land grant."

It was the contention of the 6th Respondent that there had been a meeting on 28.04.2021 at the Divisional Secretary\u2019s Office presided by the Divisional Secretary and the parties had agreed to demarcate the land as stated in the said document 6R1. According to this letter, the demarcation and the division of the land is to be made as follows:\n\n\u201c \u0dbb\u0dd6\u0da9\u0dca \u0db4\u0dbb\u0dca\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca 02 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf \u0db8\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc2 \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd3\u0dbb 02 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbb\u0dbb\u0ddd\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba 02 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0da2\u0dba\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0d9a 01 00\n\n9\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbb\u0dc2\u0dd3\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba 01 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0d9a 03 27\u201d\n\nFurther, by the said letter, the 6th Respondent had sought the Divisional Secretary\u2019s permission to survey the land according to the divisions in the said letter. Interestingly, at the bottom of the letter there is an endorsement which states that all the parties mentioned in the said letter have agreed to the said division. In agreement the said parties have placed their signature. The Court observes that the said agreement is signed by the Petitioners. This document was not submitted to this Court by the Petitioners nor have they disclosed it in their pleadings. In my view, after placing their signatures and not pleading about the existence of the document, the Petitioners have misrepresented and suppressed material facts from this Court. The said request has been approved by the Divisional Secretary by his letter dated 31.05.2021 marked as 6R2. The Petitioners have not denied placing their signatures in the document marked as 6R1.\n\nNow I will consider the objections raised by the Respondents."

Hence, the quashing of the document marked as P12 or P14 will not deprive the rights and entitlements of the 6th Respondent over the corpus. Thus, the reliefs, even if granted, would end up in futility.\n\nThe prayers of the Petitioners\n\nLet me now examine the prayers of the Petitioners.\n\nThe Petitioners\u2019 prayer (c) is to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to allocate the lots according to the plan prepared by the 6th Respondent marked as P14. However, I observe the said decision to allocate land according to the division in the plan marked as P14 is not before this Court. Even if I am to assume that the said decision is the letter marked as P12, the said letter does not disclose a decision to allocate the lots pursuant to the plan P14. Thus, the Petitioner is inviting the Court to exercise its Writ jurisdiction to quash a decision which is not before this Court. Hence, in the absence of a decision to allocate the lots, the said prayer has to fail.\n\nThe Petitioners\u2019 prayer (d) has to fail as the Petitioner has failed to disclose the right the Petitioners have, to obtain the Writ of Mandamus the way it is pleaded. When coming to this decision I am mindful of the fact that the Petitioners are not seeking a Writ of Mandamus to succeed to the title according to their late father\u2019s nomination in the permit.\n\n12\n\nIt is trite law that a Writ of Mandamus is available only to implement a legal right that the Petitioner is entitled to but has been denied (Dr. Ranganathan Kapilan v. University Services Appeal Board and 60 others CA Writ 430/19 decided on 22.06.2023)."

University Services Appeal Board and 60 others CA Writ 430/19 decided on 22.06.2023).\n\n\u201cThere is rich and profuse case law on mandamus, on the conditions to be satisfied by the applicant. Some of the conditions precedent to the issue of mandamus appear to be:\n\na) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by\n\nthe parties against whom the mandamus is sought\u2026\u2026 The foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. b) The right to be enforced must be a \u201cpublic right\u201d and the duty sought to be\n\nenforced must be of a public nature...\u201d\n\nFurther, the relief prayed cannot be granted in the absence of impugning the document marked as P5. As stated above by the said document 6th Respondent is recognized and registered as the successor to the grant of Subhaya. Thus, the said prayer cannot be sustained and has to fail.\n\nIn parting with this judgement, it is pertinent to note that even if I am to assume that the Petitioners at this belated juncture is seeking to implement Subhaya\u2019s nomination to the permit, it cannot succeed without quashing the succession of the 6th Respondent, which the Petitioners have not attempted to do even in this Writ Application.\n\n13\n\nConclusion\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated above, in my view, the Petitioners\u2019 Application has to fail. Therefore, I refuse to grant the reliefs prayed for and proceed to dismiss this Writ Application. The parties are to bear their own costs.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that this judgement should not be a bar for an amicable settlement the parties may arrive at, if they so desire.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal\n\nMahen Gopallawa, J\n\nI agree\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal"

The 1st Petitioner was granted a permit under the Land Development Ordinance, and the 2nd Petitioner, her daughter, was nominated as successor to the said permit. It is alleged that in or around 2005, the 1st Petitioner had obtained a loan of Rs. 18,000 from the 7th Respondent, and the Petitioners permitted the 7th Respondent to cultivate a portion of the land until repayment of the sum owed to him. In 2009, the 7th Respondent refused to accept repayment of the loan\n\n6\n\nThereafter, the Petitioners became aware that the Grama Niladhari had written to the Divisional Secretary recommending that part of the land be granted to the 8th Respondent, wife of the 7th Respondent. The Grama Niladhari had also cancelled the nomination of successors to the land made by 1st Petitioner and had granted 1 Rood from the land to the 8th Respondent by a deed. The Petitioners state that under duress, the 1st Petitioner placed her signature on the deed to dispose of 1 Rood from the land in favour of the 8th Respondent.\n\nThe Petitioners\u2019 contention\n\nThe Petitioners contend that the 7th and 8th Respondents had acted in collusion with the other Respondents to obtain a permit to a part of the land granted to the Petitioners, and that the 1st to 6th and/or 9th Respondents had acted contrary to the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 contention\n\nThe Respondents raised the following objections:\n\n\u2022 The Petitioners are guilty of laches. \u2022 The Petitioners have misrepresented material facts. \u2022 The Petitioners have failed to come before this Court with clean hands. \u2022 The Petitioners have failed to name the necessary parties. \u2022 The Petitioners\u2019 Application is frivolous, vexatious and futile.\n\nAnalysis"

Let me first examine the law pertaining to the transfer of the land.\n\nThe 1st Petitioner being the beneficiary of the grant becomes the owner of a holding under the LDO, as the said grant had been given under the LDO. Chapter VI of the LDO\n\n8\n\ndeals with disposition of holdings. Pursuant to section 42, an owner of a holding has a discretion to dispose of such a holding subject to the provisions thereto. To get a better understanding, let me now consider section 42 of the LDO. Section 42 reads as follows:\n\n\u201cThe owner of a holding may dispose of such holding to any other person except where the disposition is prohibited under this Ordinance, and accordingly a disposition executed or effected in contravention of the provisions of this Ordinance shall be null and void.\u201d"

Although section 43 deals with a conditional prohibition of a lease or mortgage of a holding, this Court observes that the said section does not deal with an outright transfer. It is also pertinent to note that section 46 of the Ordinance will not apply in this instance as it deals with a permit.\n\nLet me now consider whether the grant marked as P2, in the column under conditions, prohibits the alienation of the land as depicted in the impugned deed marked as P15. The said conditions stipulate a minimum fraction of disposition. However, the Petitioners did not contest that the land alienated under P15 was in violation of this condition. Under clause 7 of the conditions there is a prohibition imposed on the grantee which prohibits the disposition of the holding or any disposition thereof without the prior permission of the Divisional Secretary. Let me know consider whether the 1st Petitioner has complied with this condition when executing the deed P15.\n\nAlong with the statement of objections, the 1st Respondent tendered the document marked 1R3.

Subsequently, the Divisional Secretary in his letter dated 14.11.2011 marked and tendered as 1R15 has given his consent to the execution of the deed for the alienation of half of the land depicted in the grant. Subsequently, by the document marked 1R17 the Divisional Secretary had approved the draft deed which has incorporated the conditions stipulated in the grant P2 namely conditions 1-7 and has informed the 1st Petitioner to inform the said to the land registry and submit it to the Divisional Secretary. Hence, it appears that in executing the deed P15, the conditions in granting P2 have not been violated it has been approved by the Divisional Secretary. The Petitioners\u2019 next contention was that the said deed was executed in violation of section 162(2) of the LDO.

Thus, this section makes the holding a protected holding.\n\nHowever, the law was amended by Act, No. 16 of 1969. Thereby section 162(1) was amended and the requirement of the written consent of the Government Agent and the requirement to attach the said consent to the deed and a special mention of the said consent in the attestation have been done away with. Hence, in my view, in the absence of the said protection afforded under section 162(1) being visible in the Amended Act, the Petitioners cannot rely on the lack of the reference of the said consent in the attestation to impugn the document P15. Further, as stated in the judgement above, the documents marked 1R13, 1R14, 1R15 and 1R17 clearly demonstrate that the Divisional Secretary\u2019s consent has been obtained and by the Second Schedule to the deed and the conditions attached had complied with the conditions of deed P2 and the deed P15 has been subject to the said conditions and the protection clause in the Second Schedule.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the 1st Petitioner herself and the 1st Respondent had followed the procedure laid down in the LDO prior to the execution of P15. At this stage, I wish to reiterate that the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate any provisions of the LDO that had been violated by the Respondents in executing P15. In the absence of such in my view, the first ground of the Petitioners that P15 is bad in law is not tenable."

However, this Court observes that the said deed had been executed in the year 2011. If the 1st Petitioner was forced to sign the said deed, the Petitioners had ample time to complain to the Divisional Secretary, the police or even the notary who executed the said deed that she was compelled to sign the said deed by coercion and by force. I have considered the documents marked as P18(a), P18(b) P18(c) and P18(d) which again are complaints to the police made by the 2nd Petitioner and not by the 1st Petitioner. However, none of the said complaints state that a deed had been executed by force.\n\n13"

The writ of prohibition is not a remedy to restrain the doing of a purely physical act, to restrain which the proper remedy is an injunction. Further, where it is necessary to restrain an official from purporting to exercise power which he does not have, it is an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition to restrain him that must be sought and not a mandamus to compel him not to act\u201d\n\nThe position therefore is that a Writ of Prohibition is available to the Petitioner to prevent an illegal exercise of power \u2026\u201d\n\nIn this instance the transfer has already taken place and the Petitioners themselves have submitted the number of the executed deed.

The same has been sent to the Petitioner on the same date by registered post, marked as X12.\n\nHas the Petitioner complied with provisions of the Act to register a communication address?\n\nThe Petitioner alleges that the Petitioner was not notified of the resolution. In this context it is important to consider section 2 of the Act which reads as follows:\n\n\u201c(1) Every person-\n\n(a) to whom any loan is granted by a bank on the mortgage of property, or (b) who has obtained probate of the will or letters of administration to the estate\n\nof a person to whom any loan has been granted by a bank on the mortgage of property, or who, upon application made in that behalf by the Board, has been appointed by court to represent such estate, or\n\n7\n\n(c) to whom any right, title or interest whatsoever in any property mortgaged to\n\na bank as security for any loan, has passed, whether by voluntary conveyance or by operation of law,\n\nshall register with a bank an address to which all notices to him may be addressed.\u201d (Emphasis added)."

It was the contention of the Respondents that the registered post letters had not been returned. In any event, the proviso to section 2(2) of the Act contemplates the course of action available in the event that an address had not been registered, which the Respondents have complied with, namely the publication of the resolution in the Gazette, which is marked and tendered as X13a,13b and 13c, and the publication of the same in three languages in the newspaper, marked and tendered as X14a, X14b and X14c. This too had been informed to the Petitioner by X15 and the registered post receipt is tendered and marked as X15a. It was submitted that the said letter had not been returned.\n\nHence, in my view the Respondents have complied with the requirements of the Act in informing the Petitioner. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner attempted to impugn the document marked as X15b on the ground that the schedule to the said notice is published in the English language. It is apparent the notice and the 1st schedule pertaining to the description is published in the Tamil language but the machinery that was mortgaged depicted in the 2nd Schedule is in English language, however in my view the said objection which is highly technical in nature, would not have any effect to\n\n8\n\nvitiate the validity of the publication, and the compliance with the requirements of the Act, as the land mortgaged, is properly identified and the particulars of the resolution are published in the three languages."

The Petitioner has decided to challenge the said resolution by instituting the instant Application before this Court in December 2023, which is nearly three years after the resolution was passed. The Petitioner has failed to give a reasonable explanation to purge the delay.\n\n\u201cThe proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a Writ application dwindle and the Court may reject a Writ application on the ground of unexplained delay.\n\n\u2026\n\nAn application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the Order which the applicant seeks to have quashed. What is reasonable time and what will constitute undue delay will depend upon the facts of each particular case. However the time lag that can be explained does not spell laches or delay. If the delay can be reasonably explained, the Court will not decline to interfere. The delay which a Court can excuse is one which is caused by the applicant pursuing a legal remedy and not a remedy which is extra-legal. One satisfactory way to explain the delay is for the petitioner to show that he has been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by the Law.\u201d\n\nFurther, in the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to establish the impugned decision to be manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction. The Petitioner also relied on Private Tea Factory Owners\u2019 Association v. Tea Commissioner SC Appeal 47/2011, SC Minutes 04.06.2014 and Pathirana v. Victor Perera (DIG Personal Training Police) 2006 (2) SLR 281. I find the facts and circumstances of the said cases are different to the case before me.

Especially, when the Petitioner in this case had failed to establish that the decision impugned is a nullity or taken without jurisdiction.\n\n11\n\n\u201cThe Writs are extraordinary remedies granted to obtain speedy relief under exceptional circumstances and time is of the essence of the Application\u2026 The laches of the Petitioner must necessarily be determining factor in deciding the Application for Writs as the Court will not lend itself to making a stultifying order which cannot be carried out.\u201d\n\nFurther, in the case of Kolombage Udara Sudarshani Silva v. Subasinghe Arachchige Dona Maria Reeta Pilaminahami and others CA Writ 304/2019 decided on 20.01.2023 it was held that:\n\n\u201cThe doctrine of laches is based on the Latin maxim \u2018Vigilantibus Non Dormientius Aequitas Subventil\u2019 which means that Equity aids the vigilant, not the ones who sleep over their rights. The doctrine of laches is one of the few defences available to the defendant.\n\nThe doctrine of laches is used by the Courts to deal with an inordinate delay that occurs in filing a Petition or complaint. It means if you have any legal claim, you have to approach the Court promptly. Laches is a fair doctrine or an equitable defense. The Courts will not help the person who sleeps over their rights but will help those who are aware of their rights. A person is said to be liable for laches when he comes to the Court to affirm their rights after a reasonable delay. In many matters, a delay in filing a case has the effect of blocking the opposing party from putting on a fair defense."

Hence,\n\nthis judgement.\n\n6\n\nArguments\n\nThe contention advanced by the Counsel for and on behalf of the Petitioner is that the Arbitrator\n\nhas not considered and followed the recruitment scheme adhered to by the Petitioner in recruiting\n\nthe officers for Class M-VI. Therefore, the arbitral award awarded by the 1st Respondent is against\n\nthe weight of the evidence adduced before him.\n\nThe next argument is that the 4th to 22nd Respondents had not passed the test or interview with the\n\nrequired marks of fifty percent; therefore, they are ineligible to be recruited as Class M-VI\n\nOfficers; despite that fact, it is the view of the 1st Respondent to redress their grievances for not\n\nbeing recruited as Class M-VI Officers with effect from 05.04.2012 which could not have been\n\ndone as there were no vacancies in the cadre to absorb them.\n\nThe next contention is that the Grievance Committee, having looked into the matter, made certain\n\nsuggestions, and on their suggestions and proposals, certain officers were absorbed into Class M-\n\nVI. However, those who had not scored the required marks at the interview were not recruited.\n\nFurthermore, it is also argued for and on behalf of the Petitioner, that some of the officers who are\n\nparty to the arbitration, had already retired from the service; therefore, their grievances cannot be\n\nredressed as arbitral award itself to that extent is not legally binding.\n\nHowever, the learned State Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondents, Mr. Sampath informed the Court"

The arbitral award was granted in favour of the 4th to 22nd Respondent, however, it did not consider the fact that there were no vacancies existing at the time to absorb them into the cadre. Writ of Certiorari and Prohibition issued quashing the said arbitral award.",

Later, though their matter\n\nwas referred to the Grievance Committee, it had also not given any redress except for properly to\n\ngive some suitable relief according to the law. Accordingly, certain Respondents who are now\n\nbefore the Arbitrator were also given appointments in due course, depending on the available\n\nvacancies, with effect from 04.10.2018.\n\nHowever, their grievance is that their appointments should be backdated with effect from\n\n05.04.2012.

The said entry corresponds with the grant depicting the highland. All parties conceded that the dispute is concerning the highland. The original grantee, one Subhaya too has expired in the year 2000.

It is also not disputed that the eldest son of Subhaya, namely, Wimaladasa had not staked a claim to the highland. However, subsequent to the death of Wilmaladasa, a dispute arose between the children pertaining to the succession to the grant depicted in P11, which is the highland.\n\nAt this stage, it is pertinent to note that all parties before this Court conceded that the dispute is confined to the highland which is depicted in grant P1.\n\nSuccession to the deceased grantor\n\nIt is common ground that when Subhaya died in the year 2000, he had not nominated a successor to the highland depicted in P1. However, it was also not disputed that before obtaining the grant on 13.09.1994, Subhaya had been in possession of the land depicted in Pe1, on the strength of a permit and as stated above, Subhaya has nominated 3 successors to the highland. It is pertinent to note that in the absence of a specific nomination in the grant, this Court has constantly held that a nomination made for the permit is considered a nomination for the land grant."

There is no material to demonstrate that the 6th Respondent, being the second eldest son, had given his consent. The Counsel for the Petitioner failed to tender any document to show that even the 2nd Petitioner had given his consent for the nomination of the 1st Petitioner as successor to the grant. It appears, that none of the children of Subhaya have staked a claim for the highland on the basis that they were the nominees to the permit. In any event no such document demonstrating such a request was tendered to Court. Instead, it appears that all the children have gone on the basis of the late father not having nominated a successor and had invited the Divisional Secretary to act pursuant to the provisions of the LDO on the basis that there was no nominated successor to the grant marked as P2. It is pertinent to observe that by their conduct the Petitioners have voluntary given up their right to succeed to title in the permit as nominees of Subhaya."

The Counsel for the Petitioner failed to tender any document to show that even the 2nd Petitioner had given his consent for the nomination of the 1st Petitioner as successor to the grant. It appears, that none of the children of Subhaya have staked a claim for the highland on the basis that they were the nominees to the permit.

Thus, by P5 the Divisional Secretary has recognized R.P. Danapala, the 6th Respondent to this case as the successor and has taken steps to register the land under his name.

It was the contention of the 6th Respondent that there had been a meeting on 28.04.2021 at the Divisional Secretary\u2019s Office presided by the Divisional Secretary and the parties had agreed to demarcate the land as stated in the said document 6R1. According to this letter, the demarcation and the division of the land is to be made as follows:\n\n\u201c \u0dbb\u0dd6\u0da9\u0dca \u0db4\u0dbb\u0dca\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca 02 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf \u0db8\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc2 \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd3\u0dbb 02 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbb\u0dbb\u0ddd\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba 02 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0da2\u0dba\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0d9a 01 00\n\n9\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0dbb\u0dc2\u0dd3\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba 01 00\n\n\u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd3. \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0d9a 03 27\u201d\n\nFurther, by the said letter, the 6th Respondent had sought the Divisional Secretary\u2019s permission to survey the land according to the divisions in the said letter. Interestingly, at the bottom of the letter there is an endorsement which states that all the parties mentioned in the said letter have agreed to the said division.

This document was not submitted to this Court by the Petitioners nor have they disclosed it in their pleadings. In my view, after placing their signatures and not pleading about the existence of the document, the Petitioners have misrepresented and suppressed material facts from this Court. The said request has been approved by the Divisional Secretary by his letter dated 31.05.2021 marked as 6R2. The Petitioners have not denied placing their signatures in the document marked as 6R1.\n\nNow I will consider the objections raised by the Respondents."

Thus, the reliefs, even if granted, would end up in futility.\n\nThe prayers of the Petitioners\n\nLet me now examine the prayers of the Petitioners.\n\nThe Petitioners\u2019 prayer (c) is to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to allocate the lots according to the plan prepared by the 6th Respondent marked as P14. However, I observe the said decision to allocate land according to the division in the plan marked as P14 is not before this Court. Even if I am to assume that the said decision is the letter marked as P12, the said letter does not disclose a decision to allocate the lots pursuant to the plan P14. Thus, the Petitioner is inviting the Court to exercise its Writ jurisdiction to quash a decision which is not before this Court. Hence, in the absence of a decision to allocate the lots, the said prayer has to fail.\n\nThe Petitioners\u2019 prayer (d) has to fail as the Petitioner has failed to disclose the right the Petitioners have, to obtain the Writ of Mandamus the way it is pleaded. When coming to this decision I am mindful of the fact that the Petitioners are not seeking a Writ of Mandamus to succeed to the title according to their late father\u2019s nomination in the permit.\n\n12\n\nIt is trite law that a Writ of Mandamus is available only to implement a legal right that the Petitioner is entitled to but has been denied (Dr. Ranganathan Kapilan v.

Some of the conditions precedent to the issue of mandamus appear to be:\n\na) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by\n\nthe parties against whom the mandamus is sought\u2026\u2026 The foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. b) The right to be enforced must be a \u201cpublic right\u201d and the duty sought to be\n\nenforced must be of a public nature...\u201d\n\nFurther, the relief prayed cannot be granted in the absence of impugning the document marked as P5. As stated above by the said document 6th Respondent is recognized and registered as the successor to the grant of Subhaya. Thus, the said prayer cannot be sustained and has to fail.\n\nIn parting with this judgement, it is pertinent to note that even if I am to assume that the Petitioners at this belated juncture is seeking to implement Subhaya\u2019s nomination to the permit, it cannot succeed without quashing the succession of the 6th Respondent, which the Petitioners have not attempted to do even in this Writ Application.\n\n13\n\nConclusion\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated above, in my view, the Petitioners\u2019 Application has to fail.

Therefore, it is an unusual act on\n\nthe basis of national policy.\n\n6\n\nOn the other hand, Ms. Saroujah for the Respondents contended that when the appointment is\n\nmade, the very same appointing authority has the power to remove such appointed person since\n\nthe appointment also entails the power of removal as per Section 14 of the Interpretation Act.\n\nTherefore, there is no requirement to provide any reasoning for such removal, as such removal can\n\nbe done at any time.\n\nIn addition to that, Ms. Saroujah argued that Section 44(3) of the Universities Act itself\n\ncontemplates occasions where a Council Member can lose his post through a Vacation of Post or\n\nremoval of his post. Therefore, such removal cannot be challenged in any court of law.

In addition to that, before his removal, the Petitioner had not been\n\n8\n\naccorded any opportunity to present his case or asked for any explanation as to why he should not\n\nbe removed.

Nor, for the same reason, are the remedies concerned only with\n\nthe rights of subjects in the sense of legal rights.

F. H.

Thereafter, he has been employed in the Land Reforms\n\nCommission as a director. However, in the meantime, in response to an advertisement to secure\n\nan appointment in the Council of the Eastern University, the Petitioner had applied, and\n\nconsequently the Petitioner had been appointed as a member of the Council on 02.03.2023 by the\n\ndocument marked as P7 for a period of three years. However, after the current Government came\n\ninto power, new members of the University Grants Commission have been appointed, which is the\n\n1st Respondent. Later, the Petitioner was asked to tender his resignation before the expiry of his\n\nthree-year term by the document marked as P11. However, he has been removed by letter dated\n\n26.03.2025 (P18) despite his resistance to such a removal. Accordingly, he challenges his removal\n\nby this Application.\n\nThis Application was supported on 17.09.2025, and thereafter formal notice was issued on the\n\nRespondents, who filed their respective objections. This matter was taken up for argument on\n\n5\n\n06.11.2025 before me, and the following submissions were made by the Counsel on both sides in\n\nsupport of and in opposition of the application; hence this judgement.\n\nArguments\n\nThe first contention of the Counsel for the Petitioner, Mr. Sirimanne, is that removal of the\n\nPetitioner from the post as a Member of the University\u2019s Council by P18 is violative of Section\n\n44(3) of the University Act; therefore, it is illegal.

In addition to that, he contended that the said decision\n\nto remove the Petitioner without a hearing is a denial of natural justice; therefore, the Petitioner is\n\nentitled to the relief as prayed for in the prayer.\n\nThe second contention of Mr. Sirimanne is that the \u2018National policy\u2019 is contained in the particular\n\nAct, namely the Universities Act, which was not amended by the so-called national policy, and if\n\nthere is such a national policy, it can also be challenged if it is against the law or the Constitution;\n\ntherefore, the Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs as prayed for.\n\nOn the other hand, the learned State Counsel, Mr. Dilan Sampath argues that a national policy is\n\nin the public domain; therefore, the Petitioner can also have access to the national policy. As such,\n\nthe notice thereof need not be given or informed as a reason for the removal from office, as they\n\nare merely implementing the said national policy.\n\nThe next argument of Mr. Sampath is that no court will interfere with the national policy, even if\n\nit is not reflected in any enactment, as such national policy can be changed when a new\n\nGovernment comes into power.\n\n6\n\nHis second argument is that in all the letters written by the Petitioner to the University Grants\n\nCommission, he has accepted the fact that he can be removed and will resign; however, the\n\nPetitioner wants to know the reasons behind such a decision. Since the reasons are given in P7\n\nitself as the reason to implement the national policy, such reasons need not be given in writing to\n\nthe Petitioner.

However, the Respondents have made an attempt to justify that on the basis that\n\nsuch removal was effected in implementing National policy. The Petitioner\u2019s removal from the\n\npost of a Council member was effective from February 2025. Prior to the removal, he was asked\n\nto resign; since he declined or failed to do so, the Respondents then took steps to remove him, as\n\nreflected in the documents marked as P18. Accordingly, it is very clear that the Petitioner has been\n\nremoved from his post of a Council member in the course of implementing national policy.\n\nNational policy versus Election manifesto\n\nNow, the question that has arisen for consideration, as argued by Counsel for and on behalf of the\n\nPetitioner, is whether National policy, or what is not spelt out in black and white, can be\n\nimplemented in the guise of National policy or not. No policy so far has been spelt out in a\n\ndocument placed before this Honourable Court, except an election manifesto marked as R2.\n\nIf the Respondents are permitted to adopt the manifesto of a particular political party, and what is\n\nspelt out in that manifesto is imposed as National Policy, that itself poses discriminatory treatment\n\n7\n\nin so far as it affects members of other political parties, because in a democracy, what is spelt out\n\nin an election manifesto is a decision taken by one political party. If such politicized decisions are\n\nadopted as National Policy without being considered by opposing parties, it would further amount\n\nto imposing a hegemonic rule."

Accordingly,\n\nNational Policy should be formulated to protect the rights of each and every individual in society.\n\nThis was elaborated by Ronald Dworkin in his famous book \u201cTaking Rights Seriously\u201d (1977)1;\n\n\u201cIn order to save them, we must recognize as competing rights only the rights of other\n\nmembers of the society as individuals. We must distinguish the 'rights' of the majority as\n\nsuch, which cannot count as a justification for overruling individual rights, and the\n\npersonal rights of members of a majority, which might well count. The test we must use\n\nis this. Someone has a competing right to protection, which must be weighed against an\n\nindividual right to act, if that person would be entitled to demand that protection from\n\nhis government on his own title, as an individual, without regard to whether a majority\n\nof his fellow citizens joined in the demand.\u201d2 [Emphasis is mine]\n\nIt was argued for and on behalf of the Respondents by Mr. Sampath, the learned State Counsel,\n\nthat the National policy is available in the public domain and if the Petitioner or any other person\n\nwere to search, he can easily have access to such a policy. However, unless it is placed before the\n\n1 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (Harvard University Press, Cambridge (MA) 1977) 2 Page 194.\n\n8\n\nCourt by way of a document or provided for in the form of an Act of Parliament, the Court is not\n\nsupposed to take cognizance of such a policy. If a policy is in the form of an Act, that has to be\n\ntaken cognizance of by the Court, and the Court has to follow such a policy."

Therefore,\n\nshe argued that the tenement number 126 should first be dealt with by the relevant authorities\n\n5\n\nseparately; as such, the Petitioner\u2019s application should be allowed as far as only the Tenement\n\nbearing No. 126 is concerned.

However, before her death, without\n\nsucceeding as the life interest holder, she had made an application to the Divisional Secretary to\n\namalgamate both lands, namely Lot Nos.126 and 127 in P3, and divide the same among the"

As such, according to the Third Schedule\n\nbefore the amendment enacted in 2022, since the issue of succession had arisen in 1996 with the\n\ndeath of the father, or at least (worst case scenario) in 1997 with the death of the mother which\n\ntook place prior to the enactment of the amending Act, No. 11 of 2022, the Petitioner is entitled to\n\nthe said rights as the eldest male child of the original permit holder. Thus, I hold that the Counsel\n\nfor the 1st to 3rd Respondents\u2019 argument referred to above appears to be attractive, which I further\n\nhold that Mr. Jayawardena\u2019s argument should succeed.\n\n8\n\nIn those circumstances, the 1st Respondent\u2019s decision to amalgamate the Lot Nos. 126 and 127 as\n\none land, and divide the same in equal shares amongst the Petitioner and the 4th to 11th Respondents,\n\nand issue permits or grants to be made on that basis as reflected in the document marked as 1R4,\n\nis erroneously taken and palpably wrong.

    "keywords": "The Petitioner being the eldest child of the original permit holder, who had died and nominated his wife as the successor, sought to be substituted. The same permit holder held two plots of land, one on permit issued under the Land Development Ordinance, and the other one\u2019s permit was on the pipeline to be issued. The widow never made an application to succeed within the time stipulated as she had also died within sixteen months of the death of the original permit holder. The Divisional Secretary decided to amalgamate both lands and divided into equal shares among all the children. The Petitioner successfully invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to obtain a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus to declare him as the successor in respect of the plot of land held under permit.",

Therefore, the said decision should be quashed by way\n\nof a Writ of Certiorari. However, Lot No. 127 should be divided in equal shares and accordingly\n\nDelay\n\nThe Respondents have raised the issue of delay in pursuing the Petitioner\u2019s present Application in\n\nthis Court, namely after the father\u2019s death in 1996, almost twenty-odd years had elapsed.\n\nNevertheless, when all the facts discussed by me above are put together and considered as a whole,\n\nit is the Respondents who had caused the delay as it is for the Respondents to act in terms of\n\nSection 72 of the Ordinance and then issue the permit or accept the Petitioner as the successor to\n\nthe original permit holder in respect of Lot No. 126 of P3 to the Petitioner.\n\nSince the Petitioner was not issued with such a permit, the delay was caused, and the Respondents\n\nhave embarked upon on unwanted and redundant inquiries on the applications made by other\n\nparties (siblings of the Petitioner). Therefore, the delay is mainly caused by the Respondents; thus,\n\nthe delay does not defeat this Application.\n\nConclusion\n\nAccordingly, Writ of Certiorari is issued as prayed for in (d) of the Petition. In addition to that,\n\nsince the Petitioner is entitled to succeed on the above-mentioned basis, he is entitled to compel\n\nthe 1st to 3rd Respondents to register his name as the successor to the original permit holder\u2019s rights\n\n9\n\nto Lot No. 126 of P3; therefore, relief prayed for in prayers (a), (b), and (c) of the Petition is\n\ngranted; thus, Writ of Mandamus is also issued.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"
