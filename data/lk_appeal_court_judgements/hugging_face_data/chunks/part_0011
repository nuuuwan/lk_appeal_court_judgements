Moreover, the petitioner cannot argue that, under the agreement marked P2, he is entitled to pay the amount stipulated therein and resign from the commission. The agreement should be read in line with the provisions of the Air Force Act, and the agreement cannot override the express provisions of the Act. In the case of P.S. Bus Company Limited vs. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61 NLR 491, the court held, inter alia,\u201cThe Court should also take into consideration the disastrous consequences of granting the Writ.\u201d Considering the conduct of the petitioner, the court cannot use its discretion in favour of the petitioner. If the Court allowed the petitioner's application, it could set a bad precedent and as the Air Force Commander expressed his fear, lead Tri Services Medical Officers in the same category to gain MBBS qualifications and leave the service as and when they decide to do so. In the above circumstances, the respondents have acted in accordance with the provisions of the Air Force Act. The recommendations of the 1st respondent to the Ministry of Defence cannot be considered arbitrary or ultra vires. Therefore, the application of the petitioner is dismissed.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal\n\nDr. S. Premachandra J.\n\nI agree.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal."

Document R6 corroborates that the 5th\n\nRespondent was transferred from one entity to another and it is significant R6 was signed by\n\nKeith Wilson on behalf of Reuters Limited while the affidavit marked A8 was sworn and given\n\nby the same person on behalf of Reuters News and Media Limited.\n\nIn view of this material, it is evident that the transfer of the 5th Respondent between two entities\n\nof the same group did not interrupt the continuity of his employment. A mere internal transfer\n\nwithin a corporate group cannot be relied upon to suggest that the employment relationship was\n\ndiscontinued.\n\nNext, I turn to the question of the nature of the relationship between the Petitioner and the 5th\n\nRespondent, namely whether it constituted a contract of employment or merely a contract for\n\nemployment.\n\n7\n\nIn determining whether an individual is a freelancer or an employee, the Court is required to\n\nexamine the substance of the relationship, not the labels used by the employer. It is abundantly\n\nclear that the Petitioner failed to submit any of the annual contracts signed by the parties to the\n\ninstant application whereas the 5th Respondent has produced the written contract marked R1\n\nalong with his objection.\n\nThe material before this Court demonstrate that the 5th Respondent had been working for the\n\nPetitioner under annually renewed agreements from 2005 until 2018. Such long term,\n\nuninterrupted service is inconsistent with freelance work which is ordinarily ad hoc, assignment\n\nbased and non-exclusive. A worker who remains attached to the same organization for more than\n\na decade, on annual renewals indicates the regular nature of the work of the 5th Respondent."

The sentencing decision clearly\n\nreflects a measured and balanced evaluation, with appropriate weight given to the\n\nmitigating circumstances.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge carefully weighed all mitigating and aggravating factors\n\nbefore imposing a sentence of 10 years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment. This decision reflects the\n\nbroader concern about the risk of such injustices recurring, and underscores society\u2019s\n\ndependence on the justice system to uphold a deterrent effect, preserving social order and\n\npreventing the escalation of crime.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, we find no justification to interfere with the sentence\n\nhanded down by the Learned High Court Judge on 02.05.2024.\n\nThe Sentence is backdated to the date of conviction, namely 02.05.2024. Furthermore, we\n\nmake no change in the fine and the compensation imposed on the Appellant.\n\nThe Registrar of this court is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of\n\nBalapitiya for compliance.\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\n\nAmal Ranaraja, J.\n\nI AGREE\n\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

On the day of\n\nthe incident, at around 7.00pm he had gone to pick up his uncle from his\n\nfood stall. When he was riding his motor bike with the deceased, on the new\n\nbridge which was on their way, the witness, with the aid of an electric light\n\nnearby, had spotted a group of people lurking on the middle of the bridge.\n\nAfter seeing the crowd, the deceased had told him to ride the motorbike\n\nthrough the old bridge to avoid the crowd.\n\nBefore entering the old bridge, when the motor bike had slowed down to\n\nnegotiate a hump on the old bridge, the motorbike had broken down and\n\ntoppled to the side of the old bridge. While he was near his motor bike, the\n\ndeceased had started to run from the scene. At that time, PW1 had seen with\n\nthe help of the nearby lights, the 1st Appellant dealing a blow to the back of\n\nthe deceased\u2019s head with a manna knife. Due to the fatal blow, the deceased\n\nhad collapsed and the witness had seen the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Appellants\n\nstanding in the vicinity. The 2nd and 4th Appellants, who were armed with\n\niron rods, had pelted stones at him to chase him out from the scene of crime.\n\nDue to fear, he took to his heels and when he had turned back, he had seen\n\nthe 2nd and 4th Appellants dealing blows on the deceased\u2019s body with iron\n\nrods. PW1 had then hidden himself in the dark for about one hour and had\n\nonly appeared after the arrival of the police."

Thereby, it was\n\ncontended that a conviction for murder is not safe based on his testimony.\n\nThe importance of an omission in criminal trials has been discussed in\n\nseveral judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our country. It is\n\npertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned omissions have any\n\nadverse effect on the evidence given by PW01 in this case.\n\nIn the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa\n\n(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,\n\n\u201cWhilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect\n\nthe trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that\n\nthe Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency\n\nor contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.\n\nDiscrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the\n\nbasic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance.\n\nWitnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies\n\nand omissions.

To\n\nelaborate further, a lesser sentence may be imposed only if the Court is satisfied that\n\n\u201csubstantial and compelling circumstances\u201d exist which would justify such a\n\ndeparture. However, courts must also remain mindful of the message conveyed to\n\nsociety, especially the principle that offences of a heinous nature will not be tolerated\n\nor treated lightly.\n\n12. In deciding whether the mitigatory grounds advanced by the Appellant warrant a\n\nreduction of sentence, this Court must not lose sight of the aggravating circumstances\n\nsurrounding the case, nor of the legislative intent in prescribing severe custodial\n\nsentences for sexual offences.\n\n13. Sri Lankan Courts, in a long line of judicial authorities have held that cases involving\n\nsexual offences, especially where the victims are children, have to be severely dealt\n\nwith so as to create deterrence on the society."

In the case of, Keith Billam (1986) Vol 82 Criminal Appeal Reports 347, the Lord\n\nChief Justice reiterated the foregoing observations and stated that in a contested case\n\nof rape a figure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting point of the\n\nsentence, subject to any aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as\n\nfollows:\n\n\" The crime should in any event be treated as aggravated by any of the\n\nfollowing factors : (1) violence is used over and above the force necessary, to\n\ncommit the rape ; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the victim ; (3)\n\nthe rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been carefully planned : (5) the\n\ndefendant has a previous convictions for rape or other serious offences of a\n\nviolent or sexual kind ; (6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities\n\nor perversions ; (7) the victim is either very old or very young ; (8) the effect\n\nupon the victim, whether physical or mental, is of special seriousness. Where\n\nany one or more of these aggravating features are present, the sentence\n\nshould be substantially higher than the figure suggested as the starting point\n\n\".\n\n25. It can be observed that several of these aggravating circumstances are present in the\n\ncase in hand. The appellant\u2019s request for a glass of water, by which he deceptively\n\ncreated an opportunity to forcibly remove the prosecutrix to a room; the fact that her\n\ngrandmother was asleep after taking medication; the appellant\u2019s prior confirmation\n\nthat the parents were absent from the house; the tender age of the victim, who was\n\nbelow the legal age of consent; the evident degree of pre-planning by the appellant;"

According to PW1, the team left on routine patrol at 9.00 a.m. The arrest in the\n\nKeselwatta area was made at 13.00 hours, and the appellant was subsequently arrested\n\nat 20.00 hours.

In a raid of this nature, it is of paramount importance to maintain notes pertaining to\n\nthe important events which led to the arrest. In the present case, there is a significant\n\ntime gap between the first arrest and the arrest of the appellant. The prosecution\n\nversion is that they were patrolling the area and had communication with their\n\ninformants. In the absence of the odometer reading of the vehicle in which they\n\ntravelled and accurate notes it is difficult to ascertain the truth of the prosecution\n\nversion.\n\n13.

It is also noteworthy that there exists a significant omission in the chain of custody of\n\nthe productions. According to the prosecution, the productions were handed over to\n\nthe Magistrate\u2019s Court by PC 55637 Balasuriya and were accepted by a production\n\nclerk named T. L. Kosala. However, Kosala did not testify at the trial. Instead, another\n\nproduction clerk, Konagama (PW15), gave evidence by referring to the production\n\nregister maintained during the relevant period.

    "chunk_text": "together, rather than compartmentalizing the prosecution evidence in isolation.\n\n21. In James Silva vs Republic [1980] (2) Sri L.R., it was held that:\n\nThere is a serious misdirection in law. It is a grave error for a trial judge to\n\nevidence of the accused in the light of the evidence led by the prosecution. To\n\nexamine the evidence of the accused in the light of the prosecution witnesses is\n\nto reverse the presumption of innocence.\n\n22. Furthermore, this Court cannot lightly overlook the basis upon which the learned trial\n\nJudge rejected the defence evidence. The observations made by the learned trial Judge\n\nat page 40 of the impugned judgment indicate that he had pre-judged the case even\n\nbefore analysing the defence evidence. It can also be observed that the testimony of\n\nthe defence witnesses, although subjected to cross-examination, does not reveal any\n\nsignificant inter-se contradictions. While it is true that they are family members of the\n\nappellant, that fact alone should not serve as a ground to reject their testimony unless\n\nthere exist inherent improbabilities on the face of their evidence.\n\n23. The appellant\u2019s dock statement was corroborated by the defence witnesses. During\n\ncross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, it was put to them that the appellant\n\nhad been arrested at his residence and not at Kadireshan Street as alleged by the\n\nCA/HCC/0214/2019\n\n8 | P a g e\n\nprosecution. In the circumstances, the infirmities in the prosecution evidence, when\n\nconsidered alongside the defence version, undoubtedly cast a reasonable doubt on the\n\nprosecution case. Accordingly, such doubt must be resolved in favour of the appellant.\n\n24. Considering the totality of the evidence, the defence version gains credibility, and at\n\nthe very least, a complete rejection of the defence evidence would not be justified.\n\nThis is a situation where the defence has successfully created a reasonable doubt in\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s version.

Specifically, a doubt arises as to the mode of detection and\n\nproperly appreciate this aspect, which operates in favour of the appellant.\n\n25. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the learned High Court Judge himself\n\nreached the conclusion that the dock statement and the evidence of the defence\n\nwitnesses were deliberately designed by the appellant to create doubt with regard to\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s case, and hence, the defence version could not be accepted.\n\n26. During the trial, both PW1 and PW6 stated that, while on patrol, they arrested a\n\nsuspect with narcotics and handed him over to the Keselwatta Police. However, both\n\nwitnesses failed to corroborate that assertion, as no notes or records were made in that\n\nregard. The defence, in cross-examination, emphasized this omission, as it clearly\n\ncalls into question the credibility of the testimonies of PW1 and PW6.\n\n27. Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge disregarded this point and concluded that\n\nit had no relevance to the present case, further suggesting that the burden lay upon the\n\ndefence to prove the contrary if the arrest was disputed. In my respectful view, this\n\napproach is erroneous in law. When the prosecution asserts a fact but fails to establish\n\nit through credible evidence, the defence cannot be burdened with proving a negative.\n\nThe obligation lies upon the prosecution to prove what they allege, and not upon the\n\naccused to disprove what has not been sufficiently established.\n\n28. For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to\n\nestablish the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

According to PW2,\n\n\u2018Chandran Thambi\u2019 is the 3rd Appellant in this case. Considering the evidence\n\ngiven by PW7, the investigation officer, the learned High Court had\n\ndisregarded PW2\u2019s evidence at pages 504-505 of his judgment. As the learned\n\nHigh Court Judge mainly relied on the evidence given by PW1, the eye\n\nwitness, I am of the view that not considering the dying declaration of the\n\ndeceased had not caused any prejudice to the Appellants.\n\nAs per the 4th ground of appeal, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the\n\n2nd,3rd and 4th Appellants contended that the learned High Court Judge had\n\nwrongly rejected the alibi of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Appellants.\n\nIt is trite law that no burden is cast upon the accused to prove his alibi, as\n\nthe alibi is not a defence. It is the duty of the Learned High Court Judge to\n\nconsider the alibi and if any doubt arises in the mind of the Learned Trial\n\nJudge, the benefit of the doubt must be awarded to the accused.\n\nCA/HCC/0377-381/19\n\n15 | P a g e\n\nLearned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 508-509 of the brief very\n\ncorrectly considered the law pertaining to alibi under Section 126A of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 and rejected the same after\n\ngiving plausible reasons. Hence, it is incorrect to say that the learned High\n\nCourt Judge had not considered the alibi in his judgment.\n\nIn this case, even though the learned High Court Judge had not had the\n\nbenefit to observe the demeanor and the deportment of all the witnesses\n\nduring the trial, he had properly evaluated the evidence given by both sides\n\nto arrive at his finding.

Such argument is posited on section 487(3) of the Companies Act, which provides as follows;\n\n487 (3) Where an existing company fails to comply with the requirements imposed under subsection (2) of this section within the time specified therein, the Registrar shall cause to be published the name of such company in a daily newspaper in the Sinhala, Tamil and English Language, and where such company continues to fail to comply with those requirements thereafter, the Registrar shall, within six months of the publication of its name in the newspapers, strike off the name of such company from the register maintained by him under the provisions of section 473.

The Respondents have drawn the attention of Court to clause 22 of the Sale Agreement No. 536 dated 24.11.1999, which provides as follows;\n\nIt is of the utmost significance that the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari is a decision founded purely on contract. The act or decision complained of arose from an alleged breach of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is the \"Competent Authority\"' appointed by statute cannot alter the intrinsic character of the decision sought to be quashed by certiorari. The decision is one taken wholly within the context of the contractual relationship and not in the exercise of the powers of a public authority as such. It invoked no administrative powers or authority. It is a decision made in the exercise of a power which springs from contract. In my view, it is a decision clearly\n\n27 Vide paragraphs 15-22 of the Written Submissions of the Respondents. 28 [1985] 2 Sri L.R. 413. The other decision cited by the Respondents in their Written Submissions, Samaraweera v.

The court will take a liberal view in determining whether or not the writ will issue.\" This position has been considered by many other authorities. For instance, in Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edition, Vol.l, page 125, page 134), it is clearly stated that the writ of mandamus will not be issued when it appears that it is impossible of performance, by reason of the circumstances and the writ will normally be refused' if the party against whom it is prayed does not, for some other reason, possess the power to obey'. I am of the view that the Respondents have successfully made out a case within the aforementioned parameters to establish that the grant of a writ of Mandamus would be futile in the instant application.\n\n34 [1985] 1 Sri L.R. 146 at 151. 35 [2007] 2 Sri L.R. 281. 36 39 NLR 186LR 186 at 191.\n\n20\n\n37 Vide paragraphs 6.1-6.3 of the Written Submissions of the Petitioners. 38 CA (Writ) Application No. 243/2017, decided on 07.11.2017. 39 CA (Writ) Application No. 132/2018, decided on 03.06.2021. 40 CA (Writ) Application No. 21/2022, decided on 13.02.2023. 41 C.A.

The failure to cite necessary parties and the futility of the grant of reliefs sought, as determined by me, too, militate against the grant of prerogative relief to the Petitioners. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the application. No costs."

Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the application. No costs.\n\nBefore I part with this judgment, I wish to highlight that regulatory authorities, such as the Condominium Management Authority in the instant case, play a critical role in the community. They are they expected to maintain the highest professional standards in the regulation and management of their respective sectors, to hold the scales even in the resolution of disputes and, perhaps most importantly, to safeguard the rights and interests of the vulnerable segments within their purview. As custodians of powers vested for the public benefit, such authorities may be reasonably expected to act with the highest degree of responsiveness, diligence, efficiency, transparency and accountability in the discharge of their mandate. I hope the Condominium Management Authority will take heed of such matters in their future conduct.\n\nApplication is dismissed.\n\nJudge of the Court of Appeal Mayadunne Corea, J.\n\nI agree. Judge of the Court of Appeal"
