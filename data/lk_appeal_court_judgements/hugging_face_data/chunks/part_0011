Therefore, I hold that the machinery under the Agricultural Lands Law\n\nand the Agrarian Services Act is the only one available to a tenant cultivator of\n\npaddy land to secure and vindicate his tenurial rights. The general procedure\n\nobtaining in Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act with regard to\n\ndisputes affecting land where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely, is\n\nnot applicable in such a situation.\n\nSee also; Loku Banda vs. Ukku Banda-1982(2) SLR 704\n\nUpon a careful consideration of the scheme embodied in the Agrarian\n\nDevelopment Act No. 46 of 2000 in its totality, particularly, in conjunction with\n\nits objectives and the preamble and the principle enunciated by Court in\n\nMansoor and Another Vs. OIC Avissawella, Police and Another (Supra) it\n\nbecomes abundantly, clear without any doubt that the machinery thereunder\n\nis the one only available to a tenant cultivator of paddy land to secure and\n\nvindicate his tenurial rights and in such a situation only, the Agrarian\n\nCA/PHC/0028/2021\n\nPage 10 of 13\n\nDevelopment Act of 46 of 2000 will oust the jurisdiction of a Magistrate vested\n\nin him by Part VII of the Act.\n\nHence, nowhere in the decision in Mansoor and Another Vs. OIC Avissawella,\n\nPolice and Another (Supra) had it been laid down by this Court that not only a\n\ndispute with regard to a tenurial right of a tenant cultivator but also any kind"
