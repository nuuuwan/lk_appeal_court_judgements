"(ii) Partition decrees cannot be the subject of a private agreement between"
"parties on matters of title which the Court is bound by law to examine. There"
"is  a  greater  need  for  the  exercise  of  judicial  caution  before  a  decree  is"
"entered.”"
"20] Further, in Faleel Vs. Argeen and others [2004] 1 SLR 48. The Court held"
"that although parties can settle partition action, the court should title each party"
"as;"
"“It  is  possible  for  the  parties  to  a  partition  action  to  compromise  their"
"disputes provided that the Court has investigated the title of each party and"
"satisfied itself as to their respective rights.”"
"21] In Somasiri Vs. Faleela and others [2005] 2 SLR 121, court held;"
"“(i) The error had arisen owing to the failure of the trial Judge to investigate"
"title."
"(ii) The trial Judge must satisfy himself by personal Inquiry that the plaintiff"
"made out  a  title  to  the land sought  to be partitioned  and  that  the parties"
"before Court are solely entitled to the land.”"
"22] Moreover, in Karunarathna Banda Vs. Dassanayake [2006] 2 SLR 87,"
"court held;"
"“1. …………………………………"
"2
. A partition suit is not a mere proceeding inter-parties to be settled of"
"consent or by the opinion of the Court upon such points as they choose to"
"submit to it in the shape of issues."
"3
. The Court has to safeguard the interests of others who are not parties"
"to the suit who will be bound by the decree.”"
"2
3] Therefore, the Court should safeguard that the  Plaintiff has made out his"
"title  to  the  share  claimed  by  him  and  other  co-owners.  In  Sopinona  vs."
"Pitipanaarachchi  And  two  others,  [2010]  1  SR1L.R  87,  the  same  principle"
"was stressed as;"
"“In  a  partition  action,  it  would  be  the  prime  duty  of  the  Trial  Judge  to"
"carefully  examine  and  investigate  the  actual  rights  and  title  to  the  land,"
"sought to be partitioned. In that process, it would be essential for the Trial"
