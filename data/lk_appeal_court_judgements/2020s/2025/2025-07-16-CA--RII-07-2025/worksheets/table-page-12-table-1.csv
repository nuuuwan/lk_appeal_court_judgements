"especially under partition law, as it becomes a judgment in rem. In the case in"
"hand,  there  is  a  vast  difference  between  the  extent  of  land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned  and  the  land  which  was  surveyed  according  to  the  preliminary"
"survey. Thus, the investigation of the title and identity of the land sought to be"
"portioned  has  not  been  properly  considered  and  proved  in  this  case.  The"
"judgment entered in connection with the settlement becomes illegal and must"
"therefore be set aside."
