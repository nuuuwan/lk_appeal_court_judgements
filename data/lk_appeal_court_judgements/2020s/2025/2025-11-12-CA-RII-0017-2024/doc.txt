Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

1] This an application for Restitutio-in-Integrum and the Petitioner mainly prays

for that staying all further proceedings in Magistrate’s Court Case No. 8194 and

the operation of the judgments marked “P-1” and “P-3” until the final

determination of this application; further to set aside the judgment of the learned

High Court of Galle dated 03.01.2024 marked “P-1” and the judgment of the

learned Magistrate of Galle dated 21.09.2023 marked “P-3”; to order a re-trial of

Magistrate’s Court Case No. 8194; to grant the reliefs prayed for in the Revision

Application No. 789/23 (Rev) of the Provincial High Court of Galle.

2] The Petitioner, being the virtual complainant and Appellant states that she

filed a Revision Application bearing No. 789/23 (Rev) in the Provincial High Court

of Galle against the judgment of the learned Magistrate in Case No. 8194 dated

21.09.2023. By the said judgment, the 1st and 2nd Accused were acquitted of

charges arising from the forged execution of Deed No. 3204 dated 01.07.2007,

which directly affected the proprietary rights of the Petitioner. The Petitioner,

who is the lawful owner of the subject property by virtue of Deeds No. 88 and 89

of 1997, contends that the learned Magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to

appreciate the overwhelming oral and documentary evidence presented before

Court, including testimony from the Land Registry, the Government Examiner of

Questioned Documents, and attesting witnesses.

3] The Petitioner further states that the Revision Application was dismissed by

the Provincial High Court on 03.01.2024 without affording her an opportunity of

being heard, in violation of the fundamental principle of audi alteram partem.

The Petitioner has already invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this court by way

of a properly constituted appeal, and certified copies of the impugned judgment,

appeal petition, and other relevant material have been duly annexed for

reference. It is respectfully submitted that the findings of the learned Magistrate,

8

as well as the order of the learned High Court Judges, are contrary to law and

manifestly erroneous, thereby causing grave miscarriage of justice.

4] The Petitioner therefore prays that this court to set aside the order dated

21.09.2023 of the Magistrate’s Court of Galle and the order dated 03.01.2024 of

the Provincial High Court of Galle, to declare Deed No. 3204 of 01.07.2007 as a

forged instrument, and to direct a trial de novo before the Magistrate’s Court.

5] The Parties have filed written submission in this regard. The Petitioner mostly

reiterated the same facts which was mentioned in the petition. The Petitioner,

being the virtual complainant and PW-01 in Magistrate’s Court Case No. 8194 of

Galle, was aggrieved by the Judgment dated 21.09.2023 marked P-3, whereby

the Learned Magistrate acquitted the 1st and 2nd Accused. Dissatisfied with the

outcome, the Petitioner sought sanction to appeal from the Hon. Attorney

General by letter dated 17.10.2023 marked P-9. However, such sanction was

refused. Consequently, the Petitioner invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of Galle by way of Revision Application No. 789/2023 (Rev)

filed on 27.12.2023.

6] On 03.01.2024, the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the said Revision

Application by Judgment marked P-1, doing so without calling the matter in open

court and without affording the Petitioner an opportunity of being heard. The

Petitioner maintains that such dismissal constitutes a clear violation of the rule

of audi alteram partem and the principles of natural justice. Thereafter, the

Petitioner invoked the revision and/or restitutio in integrum jurisdiction of this

Court by petition dated 12.02.2024 marked P-2, seeking to set aside the High

Court Judgment dated 03.01.2024 and the Magistrate’s Judgment dated

21.09.2023, and further seeking an order for a re-trial of the Magistrate’s Court

Case No. 8194.

7] The facts are briefly as follows; the subject matter of the complaint relates to

a fraudulent deed of gift bearing No. 3204 dated 01.07.2007 attested by the 1st

9

Accused, a Notary Public. The Petitioner and her husband were the lawful owners

of the property in question by virtue of Deeds Nos. 88 and 89 dated 14.09.1997,

marked P-5 and P-6. The 2nd Accused had, in fact, been an attesting witness to

both Deeds Nos. 88 and 89, thereby having knowledge of the true ownership of

the property. In 2008, when the Petitioner attempted to sell the said property,

the 2nd Accused produced the fraudulent Deed No. 3204, thereby obstructing the

sale. This prompted the Petitioner to lodge a complaint with the Special

Investigation Bureau of Galle, which culminated in the filing of the case before

the Magistrate’s Court.

8] At trial, several witnesses, including Land Registry officers and the

Government Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD), provided evidence

confirming the fraudulent nature of Deed No. 3204. The EQD highlighted

discrepancies in the signatures of the purported attesting witnesses, while one

such witness, Senadeerage Don Daya Siril Dammika, unequivocally denied

having signed the said deed. Despite this cogent evidence, the Learned

Magistrate acquitted the Accused without calling official witnesses under section

186 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

9] The Petitioner states that the Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact by

failing to consider that the 2nd Accused, as an attesting witness to Deeds Nos.

88 and 89, had clear prior knowledge of the Petitioner’s ownership, thus

substantiating the fraudulent nature of Deed No. 3204. The Magistrate further

ignored the evidence of the EQD and the categorical denial by witness Dammika.

In addition, the Magistrate did not permit the Prosecution to call the

Investigating Officer (PW-10), despite the Prosecution’s request following the

EQD testimony, thereby depriving the prosecution of crucial evidence. Moreover,

the Magistrate misapplied the burden of proof by placing an unduly high

threshold upon the complainant while disregarding the sufficiency of the

evidence already adduced.

10

10] In relation to dismissal of High Court, the Petitioner contends that the

Learned High Court Judge erred by dismissing the Revision Application

summarily without affording the Petitioner a fair opportunity to be heard, an

omission that amounts to a denial of natural justice. Accordingly, the Petitioner

seeks from this Court an order setting aside both Judgments marked P-1 and P-

3, directing a re-trial of Magistrate’s Court Case No. 8194.

11] The 1st and 2nd Accused Respondents say that the Petitioner had earlier

sought sanction from the Hon. Attorney General to appeal against the impugned

judgment , but sanction was refused on the basis that there were no legal

grounds, only factual disputes regarding the Magistrate’s evaluation of witness

testimony. They say that the Revision Application in the High Court was also

based on similar grounds without raising any question of law or exceptional

circumstances. They pray for dismissal.

12] I now consider the merits of this application. Article 138 of the Constitution

enacts:

“138. (1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be [committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court

of First Instance], tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things [of which such High

Court, Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution may have taken

cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be reversed

or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.” [ Emphasis is added]

11

13] The Petitioner has prayed for restitution of High Court Judge’s Chamber

order. I now consider whether said order is amenable for restitution. In the case

of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd vs Shanmugam and Others [1995]

1 Sri LR 55, it was considered when to consider restitution as follows:

“Superior courts of this country have held that relief by way of Restitutio in

Integrum in respect of judgments of original courts may be sought where (a)

the judgments have been obtained by fraud, (Abeysekerasupra), by the

production of false evidence. (Buyzer v. Eckert) (12) or nondisclosure of

material facts, (Perera v. Ekanaike) (13), (or where judgment has been

obtained by force or fraud, (Gunaratne v. Dingiri Banda (14), Jayasuriya v

Kotelawela) (15), (b) Where fresh evidence has cropped up since judgment

which was unknown earlier to the parties relying on it, (Sinnethamby-

supra), and fresh evidence which no reasonable diligence could have helped

to disclose earlier, (Mapalathan-supra). (c) Where judgments have been

pronounced by mistake and decrees entered thereon, (Sinnethamby-supra),

provided of course that it is an error which connotes a reasonable or

excusable error, (Perera v. Don Simon) (16). The remedy could therefore be

availed of where an Attorney-at-Law has by mistake consented to judgment

contrary to express instructions of his client, for in such cases it could be

said that there was in reality no consent, (Phipps-supra), Narayan Chetty v.

Azeez) (17),but nowhere the Attorney-at-Law has been given a general

authority to settle or compromise a case, (Silva v. Fonseka (18) ).”

14] The said order cannot be treated as “Where judgments have been pronounced

by mistake”. We are of the view that the impugned order was well considered

before it was made. As Learned State Counsel mentioned that there was no well-

founded reason to grant sanction to appeal against the Magistrate’s acquittals of

Accused Respondents.

15] As seen that there was a District Court Case against the forgery which was

alleged and it was held against the Petitioner. The Petitioner has appealed

12

against the said order, which was refused, and the appeal is now before the

Supreme Court. In PERERA et al. v. WIJEWICKREME et al 15 NLR 411, His

Lordship PEREIRA J.- agreeing with His Lordship Ennis J. held that;

“Restitutio in integrum is not granted in Ceylon if the applicant has any other

remedy equally effectual open to him”

16] Further, in Kumudu Samanthi Akmeemana v. Araliya Kankaanamge

Somasiri de Silva & Others CA/RII/1/2018, Decided on 21.02.2019, His

Lordship Samayawardhena, J considered the principles and held;

“It must be stressed that “the power to grant relief by way of restitutio

in integrum is a matter of grace and discretion.” (Usoof v. Nadarajah

Chettiar, 58 NLR 436) The petitioner cannot seek restitution as of right. There

are several thresholds matters to be sorted out before addressing the core

issue………. One such important hurdle to overcome is that “relief by way of

restitutio in integrum should be sought for with the utmost promptitude.”

Vide Menchinahamy v. Muniweera, Babun Appu v. Simon Appu, Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation Limited v. Shanmugam …………, it is crystal clear

that the petitioner has not acted with the utmost promptitude when she

decided to come before this Court more than two years after the District

Court held against her. The delay is too long by any stretch of imagination

particularly because the final order of the District Court against her was not

ex parte but inter partes………… The explanation for delay over two years

is unacceptable. Hence, on that ground alone, the application of the

petitioner is liable to be dismissed.” [Emphasis is added]

17] We note that the Learned High Court Judge, in refusing the application,

carefully considered three issues:

(i) the Attorney General’s refusal to sanction an appeal meant that neither

the AG nor the Police could proceed with prosecution;

13

(ii) in criminal cases where charges are filed by the AG, a private lawyer

cannot conduct the prosecution; and

(iii) the Magistrate had lawfully exercised discretion under Section 186 of

the Criminal Procedure Code, with no error serious enough to shock the

conscience of the Court.

18] Mainly, the chamber order made by the Learned High Court Judge on

considering that there was no legal or exceptional basis to revise the Magistrate’s

judgment. We see it is totally within the purview of his jurisdiction and there is

no necessity to hear the Petitioner’s version as she cannot give evidence from the

Bar Table. Thus, allowing, the Petitioner to be heard would not vitiate the

impugned order.

19] It is further seen that the Learned Magistrate, in his judgment, had observed

the waste of court time, state funds, and parties’ resources caused by pursuing

baseless evidence. Additionally, in a related District Court case (No. 15764/L,

judgment dated 12/09/2022), the 2nd Respondent had succeeded, with the

Court declaring Deed No. 2304 valid and the deeds relied on by the Petitioner

invalid. In view of these findings and we hold that the lack of merit in the

Petitioner’s claims.

20] Section 186 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides Magistrate to acquit

and discharge an accused for insufficient evidence without wasting court’s

precious time. It is reproduced below for clarity;

“186. Anything hereinbefore contained shall not be deemed to prevent

a Magistrate from discharging the accused at any previous stage of

the case, but he shall record his reasons for doing so:

Provided that, if the Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by

him, that further proceedings in the case will not result in the conviction

of the accused, he shall acquit the accused” [Emphasis is added]

14

21] Further, EQD Report cannot be taken as conclusive evidence to prove a fact

and the court cannot solely rely on it to convict the accused. It should be

remembered under Article 13(5) of the Constitution; the innocence of the accused

should be presumed until guilty is proven beyond reasonable doubt in a fair trial.

22] In the above premises, we see no prima facie case before us. We hold that

there is no miscarriage of justice or failure of justice. Having considered the facts

and law, we are not satisfied to issue notice on the Respondents. The application

is dismissed. No Costs.
