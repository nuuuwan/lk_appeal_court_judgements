"18. The importance of proving the chain of evidence was emphasized In S v Matshaba 2016"
"(2) SACR 651 (NWM) as follows:"
"“The importance of proving the chain of evidence is to indicate the absence of"
"alteration or substitution of evidence. If no admissions are made by the defense,"
"the State bears the onus to prove the chain of evidence. The State must establish"
"the name of each person who handles the evidence, the date on which it was"
"handled and the duration. Failure to establish the chain of evidence affects the"
"integrity of such evidence and thus renders it inadmissible”."
