"accurately defined, which is crucial for the court to properly execute a decree and avoid"
"ambiguity in the judgment."
"In a civil action in the District Court seeking recognition of a real right (a servitude) over"
"another’s land, which would result in the creation of an affirmation of a permanent right"
"attached  to  the 
land,  the  absence  of  a  precise  description  would  make  the  decree"
"uncertain  and  unenforceable 
in  practice,  since  the  Fiscal  would  have  no  clear 
land"
"boundaries to execute against."
"A proceeding under Part VII of the PCP Act regarding a dispute concerning a right of way"
"in the nature of a servitude under Section 69 of the PCP Act is for an order of temporary"
"character to maintain  peace and regulate possession or use temporarily until rights are"
"determined  by  a  competent  civil  court.  As  such,  since  an  order  does  not  determine"
"substantive rights, compliance with Section 41 of the CPC is unnecessary so long as the"
"disputed right in the nature of a servitude can be identifiable physically on the ground by"
"any means."
"Existence of Exceptional Circumstances for Revision"
"It 
is  by  now  settled 
law  that  the  revisionary 
jurisdiction  of  the  Superior  Courts 
is"
"extraordinary,  discretionary,  and  not  to  be  invoked  as  a  matter  of  course.  As  held  in"
"Ramalingam v. Thangarajah22, procedural lapses such as non-compliance with time-limits"
"under  Sections  66  and  67  of  the  Primary  Courts’  Procedure  Act  are  mere  irregularities,"
"not illegalities, and do not divest the Court of jurisdiction unless prejudice or injustice is"
"shown.  In  Ratnayake  v.  Padmini  de  Silva  and  another23,  the  Court  of  Appeal  reaffirmed"
"that  non-compliance  with  every 
rule  of  procedure  does  not  destroy 
jurisdiction;"
"revisionary  powers  will only be exercised  where the defect constitutes an illegality  that"
"has  occasioned  a  failure  of  justice  or  prejudiced  substantial  rights.  Most  recently,  in"
"Ananda  Sarath  Paranagama  v.  Dhammadhinna  Sarath  Paranagama  and  others,24  the"
"Court  emphasised  that  a  revision  application  is  confined  to  correcting  illegalities  and"
"patent irregularities of such magnitude as to warrant intervention, and that the remedy"
"cannot  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  appeal  or  as  a  routine  second  look  at  a  concluded"
"judgment.  Thus,  the  principle  consistently  affirmed  is  that  revision  lies  only  where  an"
"illegality  or  fundamental  irregularity  with  jurisdictional  consequence  is  demonstrated,"
