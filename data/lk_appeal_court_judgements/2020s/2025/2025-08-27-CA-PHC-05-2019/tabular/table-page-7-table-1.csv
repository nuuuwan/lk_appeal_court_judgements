It  was  contended  that  the  Learned  Magistrate  placed  undue  emphasis  on"
"","the Appellant’s refusal to consent to a site inspection and wrongly drew an"
"","adverse inference against him."
"","o 
Reliance  was  placed  on  Hewagarusinge  Sugathadasa  and  two  others  v."
"","Wijayamunige  Anulawathi  and  another6  and  where  it  was  observed  that"
"","the refusal of site inspection alone cannot attract adverse inference."
"2.  Failure to evaluate affidavits and deeds",""
"","o 
The  Appellant  argued  that  neither  the  Magistrate  nor  the  High  Court"
"","properly 
considered 
the 
affidavits, 
counter-affidavits, 
deeds, 
and"
"","complaints filed by him, which demonstrated that:"
"","the Respondents’ deeds contained no servitude,"
