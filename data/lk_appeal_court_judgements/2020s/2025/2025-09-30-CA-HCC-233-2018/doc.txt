Case of the prosecution

4. In April 2015, PW01 has purchased a bus bearing registration number WPNA

2181. Following his acquisition, PW01 has sought assistance from a politician

known to him to obtain the necessary permit to operate the bus on the

Colombo-Aluthgama route.

Page 6 of 12

5. The politician has facilitated an introduction between PW01 and PW04, the

Chairman of the Western Province Passenger Transport Authority.

Consequently, PW04 has connected PW01 with the appellant, who was the

Transport Manager of the authority at that time.

6. On October 12, 2015, PW01 has visited the office of the appellant, to submit

his application for the route permit. Upon handing over the application, PW01

has been informed by the appellant that the documents were in order, subject

to the production of a further recommendation from the branch office, in

Kaluthara. However, it is alleged that the appellant initially solicited a sum of

Rs.20,000 but later reduced the amount to Rs.10,000 to expedite the

processing of PW01’s application.

7. Further allegations suggest that the appellant accepted a payment of Rs. 1000

on the same date the application was submitted. The remaining balance of

Rs. 9000 was reportedly paid on October 15,2015, when the appellant handed

over a temporary permit to PW01.

Case of the Appellant

8. The appellant has asserted that he was setup. Specifically, has maintained

that PW01 walked into the appellant’s office and placed a sum of money on

his table. Shortly, thereafter, the officers from the Bribery Commission, arrived

and arrested the appellant based on what he claims is a false allegation of

solicitation and acceptance of a gratification.

Ground of Appeal

9. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the Counsel for the appellant

urged the following ground of appeal;

i. Evidence of the prosecution witnesses failed the test of

credibility and probability.

ii. The reasons given by the learned High Court Judge in

rejecting the defence evidence is unreasonable.

10. As previously mentioned, PW01 has approached a politician known to him to

influence the issue of a root permit, concerning the bus owned by the former.

The politician has subsequently contacted PW04, the Chairman of the

Authority at that time, directing him to issue a permit to PW01. Under these

circumstances, it is likely that PW01 and PW04 developed an acquaintance.

11. It is also noteworthy that both PW04 and the appellant, the Transport Manager

of such authority had their offices located in the same building close to one

another. On October 12, 2015, both PW04 and the appellant have reported

for duty and have been present in their offices when PW01 submitted the

application for a route permit to the appellant.

12. If the appellant had solicited and accepted a portion of the money purportedly

intended to expedite the processing of PW01’s application, it is puzzling that

PW01 did not inform PW04 of this matter on the same date. Especially given

their acquaintance. It would have been a natural course of an action for PW01

to report the appellant to PW04, considering that the appellant was a

Page 8 of 12

subordinate of PW04 and worked in the same office. Furthermore, since PW04

had specifically directed the appellant to address the matter, it would have

been even more pertinent for PW01 to bring the issue to PW04’s attention.

PW01 has not acted in a manner consistent with what a prudent individual

would have done. Furthermore, there is no adequate explanation for this lapse

on the part of PW01.

13. When PW01 was questioned about whom he met at the office at the Western

Province passenger transport authority on October 12, 2015, he has stated

that he has met the appellant. Subsequently, when asked whether he also met

PW04 at the same office on that day, PW01 has initially claimed he could not

remember, however, he has later revised his testimony, asserting that he had,

in fact, met PW04 first at the latter’s office on that day.

14. Furthermore, when PW01 was questioned whether he met the appellant on

October 14, 2014, he has responded affirmatively. However, on another

occasion, he has stated that he visited the regional office of the Authority in

Kaluthara to get the relevant documents approved, which he then forwarded

to the appellant on October 15, 2015. This contradiction has not been

addressed by PW01.

15. Regarding the introduction of PW02 to the appellant PW01 has testified that

he was responsible for introducing PW02 to the appellant during the very first

encounter with the appellant in his office on October 15, 2015. However, PW02

contradicts this account. She has stated that her introduction to the appellant

occurred at a subsequent encounter with the appellant, just prior to the

transaction in which the appellant allegedly received a sum of Rs. 9000 from

PW01.

Page 9 of 12

[vide pages 241 and 242 of the Appeal Brief]

Page 10 of 12

16. PW01 has recounted the reaction of the appellant when he expressed the

difficulty in parting with a sum of Rs. 9000. PW01 has stated that the

appellant initially took the documents from him and placed them in a drawer.

Subsequently, has stated that the documents were placed on the table first

and thereafter moved the documents from the table into a drawer. PW02 has

contradicted PW01 by testifying that the appellant after receiving the

documents, handed them back to PW01.

[vide page 255 of the Appeal Brief]

Page 11 of 12

17. It has been alleged that the appellant received a sum of Rs. 9000 using his

right hand and subsequently placed it into the pocket of his left trouser leg.

This incident raises doubts about its plausibility.

18. The positioning of the money in a left side trouser pocket adds a layer of

improbability. Generally, individuals tend to use their dominant hand to

facilitate transaction and placing cash into the opposite pocket could indicate

lack of natural coordination or awareness. Such action appears unusual and

lacked the discretion that the circumstances in the instance demanded.

Further, the choice to act in such a manner in such a situation is puzzling as

it stands in stark contrast to the expectations set by the context.

19. The discrepancies in the prosecution’s narrative raise significant concerns

about the validity of their case. It is essential to recognise that the prosecution

has failed to present cogent and reliable evidence that substantiates its

claims. Key testimonies lack coherence, with witnesses providing improbable

and conflicting accounts. Such inconsistencies not only weaken the

prosecution’s case but also cast doubt on the reliability of their sources.

20. Matters discussed being as such, it is the view of this Court, that a necessity

would not arise to consider the second ground of appeal urged by the

appellant.

Page 12 of 12

21. Due to the foregoing reasons, I am inclined to interfere with the conviction and

the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order and set aside the

same accordingly.

Appeal allowed.

22. I make no order regarding costs, the Registrar of this Court is directed to send

this judgment to the High Court of Colombo for compliance.
