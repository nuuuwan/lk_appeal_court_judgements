"There had been some cases between two parties in the Magistrate’s Court of"
"Nugegoda.    In  one  such  case,  the  1stdefendant-respondent  stated  that  Rs."
"2.6  million  was  due  to  be  paid  to  the  plaintiff-petitioner.    At  that  moment,"
"the  1st  defendant-respondent  had  admitted  that  he  had  received  Rs.  2.6"
"million 
from  the  plaintiff-petitioner.  This  shows  that  the  1st  defendant-"
"respondent  accepted  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff-petitioner  had  already  paid"
"the consideration. At that time, the defendant-respondent’s version was that"
"he  received  only  Rs.2.6  million,  while  the  plaintiff-petitioner’s  version  was"
"that she paid Rs.3.5 million to the 1st defendant-respondent."
"The  1st  defendant-respondent  tried  to  eject  the  plaintiff-petitioner’s  tenants"
"from  the  possession  of  the  property.    As  a  result,  there  was  a  case  in  the"
"Magistrates  Court  under  the  provisions  of  section  66  of  the  Primary  Court"
"Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979."
"The  Learned  Additional  Magistrate  delivered 
the  order  on  07/10/2022,"
"deciding that the 1st defendant-respondent had disturbed the possession of"
"the first party, who were in possession of the premises, and ordered the first"
"party to be in possession of the property. The first parties  in that case  (MC"
"Nugegoda  Case  No:5039/22)  were  Sammu  Arachchige  Krishanthi  and"
"Sammu Arachchige Pradeepa Mahindrani."
"It 
is  clear 
from  the  available  evidence  that  the  plaintiff-petitioner 
is 
in"
"possession  of 
the  property. 
It 
is  probable 
that  after  payment  of 
the"
"consideration  for  the  transfer  of  the  property 
in  the  plaintiff-petitioner’s"
"name, 
the  1st  defendant-respondent  had  given 
the  possession 
to 
the"
"plaintiff-petitioner.  The position of the 1st defendant-respondent is that the"
"plaintiff-petitioner  came  into  possession  using  fraudulent  documents  in  or"
"around  2016,  cannot  be  believed.  As  the 
first  defendant  states, 
if  that"
"happened,  the  1st  defendant  would  not  have  kept  quiet  without  taking"
"immediate legal action.  There was no complaint made to the police on that"
"basis."
"The  Learned  Additional  District  Judge  of  Nugegoda,  in  his  order  dated  26-"
"04-2024,  states  that  the  plaintiff  had  failed  to  make  out  a  prima  facie  case"
"against  the  defendants.  Further,  the  Learned  Additional  District  Judge  of"
"Nugegoda  decided  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  1st  defendant  was"
"trying to dispossess the plaintiff from possession."
"A  prima  facie  case  does  not  mean  that  the  plaintiff  will  certainly  win  the"
"case.  If the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried at"
"the hearing there is a prima-facie case."
"In Jinandasa vs Weerasinghe 31 NLR 33, Court held that,"
