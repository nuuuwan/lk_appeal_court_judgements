"the  alienation  of  the  property  more  fully  described  in  the  schedule  to  the"
"plaint marked P1 (hereinafter referred to as the property)."
"Facts of the case as stated by the petitioner"
"The plaintiff-petitionerâ€™s position is that she paid Rs. 3.5 Million on the 01st"
"of  February  2010 
to  the  1st  defendant-respondent 
to  buy  the  property"
"described in the schedule to the plaint. On the same day, the 1st defendant-"
"respondent  stated  to  the  plaintiff-petitioner  that  the  property  had  been"
"mortgaged  at  the  moment  and  that  he  would  get  it  released  within  a  week,"
"and  the  deed  would  be  written  thereafter.    The  1st  defendant-respondent"
"further  agreed  to  give  a  power  of  attorney  to  the  plaintiff-petitioner  to  deal"
"with the property until the deed of transfer was written.  The petitioner was"
"given  possession  of 
the  property,  and  she  has  been 
in  uninterrupted"
"possession  of  it  since  then.  The  petitioner  later  came  to  know  that  the  1st"
"defendant-respondent had transferred the property to a third party. Then, as"
"the  1st  defendant-respondent  did  not  have  the  paper  title  to  the  property,"
"the  plaintiff-petitioner  filed  an  action  seeking  to  recover  the  money  paid  to"
"the 1st defendant-respondent as the consideration to buy the property.  After"
"some time, the buyer of the property retransferred the property in the name"
"of  the  1st  defendant-respondent,  citing  a  lesser  value  as  the  consideration."
"After  that,  the  plaintiff-petitioner  filed  the  present  action  in  the  District"
"Court  of  Nugegoda,  seeking  a  declaration  of 
title  on 
the  basis  of 
the"
"prescriptive  title. 
  At  the  moment,  the  plaintiff-petitioner  possesses  the"
"property through the tenants.  The 1st defendant-respondent is trying to eject"
"the tenants of the plaintiff-petitioner.  As such, the plaintiff-petitioner sought"
"an interim injunction against the 1st defendant-respondent."
