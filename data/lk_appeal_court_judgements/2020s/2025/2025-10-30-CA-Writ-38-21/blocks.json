Though the said report contains a space for the owner\u2019s name and the owner\u2019s signature, it appears that the owner\u2019s name is not reflected nor is there a signature on the letter. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that none of the documents have reached them as their address is not reflected in any of these documents. This Court observes that as per the Petition, the Petitioner\u2019s address is given as \u201cSirisanda Kappetiyagoda South, Galle/Nagoda\u201d. It appears that none of the initial reports calling the Petitioner for an inquiry to the Commissioner\u2019s office have been addressed to this particular address. It is also pertinent to observe that the labour officer who originally submitted his report marked as 1R1 at the commencement has named K.W. Premadasa as an agent of the employer. However, in all the documents including the annexures filed with the certificate in the Magistrates\u2019 Court, his name is listed as an employee. The learned State Counsel has failed to address this Court on this vital discrepancy. It is also pertinent to observe how the labour officer obtained the information which he attached in Schedule 1 with the certificate in the absence of any books tendered by the employer which would have reflected the total earnings of each employee and the exact period of their work. The Court makes this observation especially after considering the statements of the employees marked as 1R3(i-v) as in all the statements the purported employees have admitted that they do not sign an employee\u2019s book. In the absence of such, it is doubtful how the labour officer who compiled his report pertaining to the employment income arrived at figure reflected. Thus, it is apparent that none of the correspondence or the notices have been dispatched to the correct address of the Petitioner. This Court is at a loss to understand why the inquiring officer who obtained the statements of the purported employees and the purported representative of the employer could not obtain the correct address of the employer. In my view this creates a serious doubt as to the accuracy of the findings of the inquiring officer.",

In the said Writ Application, among other grounds, one of the main grounds alleged was that the Petitioner was not given a fair hearing thereby, violating rules of natural justice.

In this context, it is now recognised that 'qui aliquid statuerit parte in audita altera acquum licet discerit, haud acquum fecerit' - which means that he who determines any matter without hearing both sides, though he may have decided right, has not done justice. According to the jurisprudence built around the 'audi alteram partem' principal, there should not only be a hearing of both sides, but the hearing should be more than a pretence. The procedure followed should be fair and conducive to the achievement of justice. In Board of Education v Rice Lord Loreburn, L.

In my view, the Commissioner of Labour before instituting action should have taken appropriate measures to ascertain the identity of the employer. I make this observation after considering the pleadings of the Petitioner in this case where he denies employing any of the employees whose names are in the attachment to the certificate filed before the learned Magistrate. It is the contention of the Petitioner that other than one employee, namely, K. W. Premadasa, none of the others were in his employment. Another glaring error I find is that in the original report marked 1R1, the labour officer interviews Premadasa as the representative of the employer. However, strangely in the same report in another part he interviews the same Premadasa as an employee and based on his interview with the said Premadasa he prepares the documents marked as 1R9 and comes to the conclusion on the working hours, the salary, etc. This matter should have been clarified by the learned State Counsel for the Respondents. Even upon inquiry from the Court the learned State Counsel was not in a position to clarify the same. In this context I am of the view that, depriving the Petitioner of a fair hearing is fatal to this application and there is a serious violation of rules of natural justice, which casts a doubt on the findings of the inquiring officer and renders a final decision null and void.",

However, the notices to produce the said documents had been sent to several addresses in the name of the Petitioner which clearly demonstrates that the labour officer who dispatched the letters were unsure of the address of the Petitioner. Further, when some of the letters were not returned there are endorsements to state to resend the letters to the same address. This clearly demonstrates that the Respondents were unaware of the exact address to communicate with the Petitioner. The inquiring officers who came to the conclusion as to who the employer of the workers was by interviewing the employees could have easily ascertained the correct address of the employer. His inability to extract the address of the employer casts a doubt on the findings of his own report. This Court makes the above dicta on the basis that if an employee doesn\u2019t know the address of his employer who is also in the same area, then the information that they give has much to be desired.",
