"of the provisions of the Section 75 of the Civil Procedure Code (“CPC”),"
"such fact not so denied should be taken as being admitted. In support"
"of  which, 
the  petitioner  relies  on 
the  decision  of  Fernando  vs."
"Samarasekere  49  NLR  285, 
in  which 
it  was  held  that  where  a"
"defendant does not deny an averment in a plaint, he must be deemed"
"to have admitted that averment. On these lines, the petitioner submits"
"that Report P-7 should be considered as being impliedly admitted, and"
"this Court is thus entitled to proceed on that basis. Then, the petitioner"
"also adverts to Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance and argues that,"
"relying  on  the  dicta  of  Balapitiya  Gunananda  Thero  vs.  Talalle"
"Methananda  Thero  [1997]  2  Sri  L.R.  101,  the  failure  to  explain  or"
"disclose facts peculiarly within the parties’ knowledge allows the Court"
"to  draw  an  adverse  inference.  This  argument  is  further  based  on  the"
"premise  that  the  1st  –  5th  respondents  have  forwarded  the  relevant"
"material 
to 
the  Attorney  General,  and  as  such, 
it 
is  within 
the"
"knowledge of the Attorney General, the 8th respondent."
