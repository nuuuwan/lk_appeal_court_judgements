"The  petitioner","therefore  submits 
that  she  was  not 
informed  of"
"","allegations against her, that she was not afforded an impartial inquiry"
"and 
thus, 
the","recommendation 
of 
the 
institution

"","original  or  a  certified  copy  of  the  decision  or  recommendation  P-7  is"
"","tendered to Court arose for consideration. P-7 is primarily tendered to"
"","Court as being a copy of the Commission Report, which contains the"
"","impugned recommendation. However, P-7 is neither the original nor a"
"","certified  copy  of  the  said  Report.  When  this  matter  was  specifically"
"raised  during","the  argument,  Mr.  Faisz  Musthapha,  PC, 
for 
the"
"","petitioner, submitted that this is the copy the petitioners possess, and"
"","since the 1st â€“ 5th respondents have not filed any objections and the 7th"
"","and 8th respondents have merely claimed ignorance of the averments of"
"","paragraphs 18 and 38, this Court can consider this document as not"
"","being  denied  or  challenged,  and  also  since  it  is  a  matter  within  the"
"","knowledge of the respondents, Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance"
"","may be relied upon, and the Court may consider document P-7 for the"
"","purposes of this application. In the written submissions filed on behalf"
"of 
the  petitioner,","this 
issue  had  been  specifically  adverted 
to  at"
"","paragraph 3 (page 12 onwards). It is submitted that the petitioner had"
"","not been officially served with a copy of the Report, and the document"
"","P-7 is that which circulated on social media. It is also submitted that"
"","the petitioner has specifically prayed in paragraphs (b) and (c) to call for"
"","and examine the record and that the petitioner be issued with a copy of"
"the entire Report.",""
"8.  The  argument  advanced  is  that  the  7th  respondent  Secretary  to  the",""
"","President, and the 8th respondent, Hon. Attorney General, have pleaded"
"","that they are unaware of the contents of paragraph 18, which refers to"
"","P-7. Then, the petitioner proceeds to argue that as the said respondents"
"","have merely claimed to be unaware and not specifically denied in view"
