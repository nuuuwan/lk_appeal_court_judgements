"According to which, it is plain and simple that writ applications under"
"Article 140 of the Constitution should be by way of petition and affidavit"
"and should be accompanied by the originals of documents material to"
"such  application  or  duly  certified  copies  thereof.  Admittedly,  in  the"
"present application, document P-7 is neither the original nor a certified"
"copy as required by the said Rules. On a perusal of P-7, I observe that"
"this does not contain the signatures of the Commissioners or any form"
"of authentication emanating from the 1st â€“ 5th respondents or from such"
"person or authority who is so empowered to so authenticate or certify"
"such  a  Commission  Report.  Admittedly,  this  is  a  print  made  from"
"something which had circulated on social media. Therefore, document"
"P-7 cannot be considered as a duly certified copy or an original within"
"the meaning and for the purposes of Rule 3 (1) (a). As a matter of fact,"
"the petitioner can say no more than that this was something that was"
"circulated on social media. This Court certainly cannot legally accept or"
"consider  this  a  certified  copy  or  a  document  containing  the  true  and"
"accurate contents of the purported Commission Report."
