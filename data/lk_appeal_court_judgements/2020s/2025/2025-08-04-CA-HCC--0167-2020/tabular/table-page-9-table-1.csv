"CA/HCC/ 167/2020"
"When this Court invited the Senior Additional Solicitor General to express her"
"views with regard to the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, in keeping with the"
"highest tradition of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Department, she humbly submitted"
"that she leaves the matter to be decided by this Court."
"When analysing the entirety of the evidence presented, I am of the view that the"
"prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the  charges  against  the  Appellants  beyond  a"
"reasonable doubt. Hence, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed"
"on the Appellants and acquit them from this case."
"The appeal is allowed."
"The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Kalutara"
"along with the original case record."
