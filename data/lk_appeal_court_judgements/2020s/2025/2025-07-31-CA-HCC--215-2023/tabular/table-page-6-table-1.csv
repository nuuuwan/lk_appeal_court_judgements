"satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs that were analysed…"
"were in fact those seized by police from the appellant’s house”;"
"The afore-mentioned judgments clearly highlight the  crucial importance of"
"the evidence with regards to the chain of custody in drug-related offences."
"They  provide  clear  guidance  on  how  this  evidence  should  be  presented  to"
"satisfy the trial court. Each piece of evidence requires thorough analysis to"
"ascertain its origin and who had access to it, ensuring no deviations from"
"standard practice."
"In cases regarding drug related offences, chain of custody issues is of critical"
"importance.  The  prosecution  must  present  undisputable 
evidence 
to"
"establish the chain of custody of the exhibits. Additionally, they must prove"
"that the item presented at trial is the same item originally in the possession"
"of  or  taken  from  the  accused.  Relying  on  tainted,  unreliable,  or  tampered"
"evidence would undermine the integrity of the judicial system."
"In  this  regard,  the  learned  High  Court Judge  had  not  made  any  comment"
"about  the  weight  discrepancy 
in  his 
judgment.  This  has  caused  great"
"prejudice to the Appellant and has effectively refused him a fair trial."
"Further,  although  PW1  and  PW2  had  said  that  the  finger  prints  of  the"
"Appellants were taken to seal the production after weighing, at the trial it"
"was revealed that one of the Appellant’s signatures was absent on the sealed"
"envelope, regardless of which the learned High Court Judge had arrived at"
"the conclusion that the production had been properly sealed in the presence"
"of  the  Appellant.  This  is  a  clear  misdirection  which  had  also  deprived  the"
"Appellants a fair trial."
"The evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the inward journey"
"of  the  productions  creates  a  serious  doubt  on  the  conviction  against  the"
"Appellant. Further, the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses consists"
"of contradictions and improbabilities."
