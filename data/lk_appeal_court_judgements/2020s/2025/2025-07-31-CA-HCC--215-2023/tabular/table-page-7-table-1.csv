"CA-HCC 0215/2023"
"Considering  the  ground  of  appeal  discussed  above,  it  clearly  supports  the"
"stance taken by the Appellant in defence as well as in  the dock statement"
"and certainly affects the root of the case."
"Therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant"
"by the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw dated 06.08.2021. Therefore, he"
"is acquitted from all charges."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to High Court"
"of Chilaw along with the original case record."
