"T","he JEDB cited in the petition as the 2nd Respondent but had failed to appear in court to resist the"

"of Appeal delivering its judgement on 17 July 1987, directed the LRC to execute legal documents",""

"Despite  this  judgment,  it  appears  that  the  execution  was  delayed  due  to  various  administrative",""

findings  of
