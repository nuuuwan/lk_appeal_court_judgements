"The Petitioner has challenged the decision of the Respondents concerning the award"
"of  a  tender  for  cleaning  services  at  the  Bandaranaike  International  Airport.  As  per"
"the document marked R1, there were five bidders for the said tender, among whom"
"the  Petitioner  had  submitted  the  lowest  bid.  However,  the  Petitioner’s  bid  was"
"rejected without any reasons being communicated to the Petitioner. The absence of"
"any reasons for the rejection, prima facie, appears to be arbitrary."
"It  is  trite  law  that  interim  reliefs  are  granted  in  cases  where  a  prima  facie  case  is"
"established in favor of the Petitioner.  What is adduced to be a prima facie case? in"
"‘Law of Injunctions’ by G S Gupta 7th edition page 168 it is defined as follows:"
"“Prima facie case really means that there is a serious question to be tried and that the"
"claim of the plaintiff is not frivolous or vexatious.”"
"If a Petitioner seeking an interim injunction fails to establish a prima facie case, they"
"are  not  entitled  to  such  relief.  In  such  circumstances,  the  Court  must  deny  the"
"issuance  of  an  interim  injunction.  Thus  in  Felix  Dias  Bandaranayake  Vs  The  State"
"Film  corporation  and  Another  [1981]  2  SLR  287  at  page  302  His  Lordship  Justice"
"Soza stated as follows"
"“In Sri Lanka we start off with a prima facie case. That is, the applicant for an interim"
"injunction must show that there is a serious matter in relation to his legal rights, to"
"be tried at the hearing and that he has a good chance of winning.”"
"Upon  examining  the  documents  submitted  before  this  Court,  it  is  evident  ex  facie"
"that  the  Petitioner  had  indeed  submitted  the  lowest  bid  out  of all  five  bidders,  yet"
"was not awarded the tender. No reasons for this rejection have been communicated"
"to  the  Petitioner,  and  on  the  face  of  the  record,  the  decision  appears  arbitrary.  In"
"light of this, I find sufficient grounds to issue formal notice on the Respondents."
"However,  during  the  course  of  arguments,  it  was  revealed  that  the  contract  in"
"question  has  already  been  awarded  to  the  10th  Respondent,  Care  Clean  (Pvt)  Ltd.,"
"and is currently in operation. Given this factual position, issuing an interim order at"
"this  stage  would  not  serve  any  practical  purpose  as  it  such  an  order  would  fail  to"
"reverse  the  contract  already  in  force  and  also  create  unnecessary  complications  in"
"the ongoing cleaning operations at Bandaranaike International Airport."
