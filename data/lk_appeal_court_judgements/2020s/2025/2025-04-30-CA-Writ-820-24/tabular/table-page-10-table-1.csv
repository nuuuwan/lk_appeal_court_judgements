"pertaining to tax liabilities under Act, No. 10 of 2006 should be subjected to Act, No."
"24 of 2017. What is contemplated by the Legislature is clear by the words used.  The"
"words used are “may be recovered” which allows the Inland Revenue Department to"
"use  the  mechanism  stated  under  Act,  No.  10  of  2006  or  Act,  No.  24  of  2017  to"

"not  expressly  preclude  the  Respondents  from  filing  the recovery action as  they have"
"done in this instance. Hence, if the liability arose before the commencement of the new"
"Act coming into operation, the Respondents can institute recovery action pursuant to"
"the  provisions  of  the  old  Act.  This  is  further  buttressed  by  the  provisions  in  section"
"203(1) which states as follows;"
