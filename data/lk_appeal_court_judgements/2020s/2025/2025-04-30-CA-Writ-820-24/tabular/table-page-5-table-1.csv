"tax return was a belated return. Thereafter, the assessment and tax in default had been"
"served which culminated with the recovery action before the Magistrates Court. It is the"
"contention of the Petitioner that although the Petitioner has tendered a late tax return."
"In  this  Writ  Application  the  Petitioner  does  not  challenge  the  accuracy  of  the  tax  in"
"default notice nor does the Petitioner challenge the amounts that are reflected to be paid"
"as tax in default and penalty. However, the Petitionerâ€™s complaint to Court is that the"
"Respondents have instituted recovery proceedings in 2024 under Act, No. 10 of 2006"
"which  was  repealed  by  Act,  No.  24  of  2017.  Thus,  the  Petitioner  argues  that  as  per"
"section 1 of Act, No. 24 of 2017 from 01.04.2018 what is valid is Act No. 24 of 2017."
"Therefore, the Petitioner contended that the recovery actions should have been instituted"
"under Act, No. 24 of 2017 and not under Act, No. 10 of 2006. The Petitioner heavily"
"relied on section 202(1) of Act No. 24 of 2017 which specifically states that Act No. 10"
"of 2006 is repealed. Further, he argued that under section 202(5) and (6) of Act No. 24"
"of 2017 all recovery actions should be filed under the new Act. Hence, the argument"
"that the action filed under a repealed Act is bad in law, and on that ground alone this"
"Court should issue notice on this Writ Application."
