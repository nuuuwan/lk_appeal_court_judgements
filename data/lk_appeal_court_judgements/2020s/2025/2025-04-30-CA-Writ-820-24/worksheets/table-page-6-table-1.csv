"has filed this Application only in December 2024, seeking to quash the Certificate of"
"Tax in Default (P2)."
"I
n this Application the Petitioner’s argument is based on the premise that the Certificate"
"of  Tax  in  Default  has  been  issued  under  a  repealed  Act.  It  is  contended  that  the"
"prosecution  commenced  in  2024  under  the  old  Act  which  has  been  repealed  and"
"pursuant to section 202(5), a new prosecution should be instituted under the new Act."
"Hence, the Petitioner argues that the whole process is bad in law as the Certificate of"
"Tax in Default was issued under a repealed Act and there is no jurisdiction to institute"
"recovery proceedings under the said repealed Act. Disagreeing with the said submission"
"the learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the Petitioner had in fact been"
"served with a letter of intimation and an assessment. Thereafter, the Petitioner had made"
"an appeal to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred to as"
"‘CGIR’), which had been dismissed as it had been made out of time. This contention"
"was not denied by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner. However, leaving it as it may,"
"this Court observes that the Petitioner has not refuted the Respondents’ contention that"
"the Petitioner has failed to pay tax which is the subject matter of the Magistrate’s Court"
"recovery action."
"S
uppression of material facts."
"T
he learned DSG strenuously argued that the Petitioner’s Application should fail as the"
"Petitioner has failed to come to Court with clean hands and the Petitioner has failed to"
"adhere to the principle of uberima fides."
"T
his  Court  also  observes  that  under  Chapter  XII  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act,  every"
"person chargeable with income tax is bound to send the returns and information to the"
"Inland Revenue Department."
"W
e do find that in the Petition, the Petitioner has failed to  plead its failure to pay the"
"taxes. Nor has the Petitioner pleaded the failure to file the tax returns according to the"
"Act within the prescribed time. In paragraph 7, the Petitioner without disclosing  its non"
"submission has pleaded that the Petitioner has submitted the tax returns on 22.04.2021."
"In the said paragraph too the Petitioner has failed to disclose that this tax return is for"
"the taxable period of 2016/2017 and that the said tax return is a late submission."
