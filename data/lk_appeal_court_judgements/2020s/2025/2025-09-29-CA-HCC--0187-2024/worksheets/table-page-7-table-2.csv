"Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance states:"
"In  criminal  proceedings  the  fact  that  the  accused  person  has  a  bad"
"character is irrelevant, unless evidence has been given that he has a good"
"character, in which case it becomes relevant."
"Explanation  1.-  This  section  does  not  apply  to  cases  in  which  the  bad"
"character of any person is itself a fact in issue."
"Explanation  2.-  A  previous  conviction  is  relevant  as  evidence  of  bad"
"character in such case."
