"In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 it was held"
"that:"
"“A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although"
"we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are"
"of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to"
"fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions….”"
"In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states: [1987] 1"
"SLR 155"
"""The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence."
"His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his"
"guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt”."
"In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:"
"“the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in"
"a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is"
"well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of"
"probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond"
"the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it"
"admitted  fanciful  possibilities  to  deflect  the  course  of  justice.  If  the"
"evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility"
"in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, “of course it is"
"possible,  but  not  in  the  least  probable,”  the  case  is  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice”."
"In a case of Money Laundering, the prosecution has to establish the known"
"income  and  the  alleged  expenditure  of  the  Accused  during  the  material"
"period. When the prosecution established the income and the expenditure of"
"an Accused during the said period, he or she must establish to a standard"
