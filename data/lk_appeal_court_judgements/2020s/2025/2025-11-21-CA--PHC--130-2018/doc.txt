Thotawatte, J.

Proceedings had been instituted by the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent, theMunicipal Commissioner of Galle Municipal Council (hereinafter sometimes referred to as“the Respondent”) by filing an application in the Magistrate’s Court of Galle under CaseNo. 68706 in terms of Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Authority Law, No. 41 of1978 as amended (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “the UDA Act”), by a Petition andAffidavit dated 27.01.2017 (found at pages 28 and 30 of the Appeal Brief) for ademolition order with regards to premises bearing No. 166/1, Matara Road, Galle(hereinafter sometimes referred to as “the subject premises”) built by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “the Appellant”). It had beenalleged therein that the subject premises, situated within a development area declaredby Extraordinary Gazette No. 38/16 dated 01.06.1979, in terms of Section 3 of the UDAAct had been constructed without obtaining a valid development permit required underSection 8J (1) of the UDA Act. In consequence, the construction had been treated as anunauthorised development, for which the demolition order had been sought.

The Appellant, in response to the above application by the Respondent, had duly filedObjections dated 18.01.2018 in the Magistrate Court of Galle, and the Respondent’sCounter-Objections, dated 08.03.2018, were tendered thereafter. After both parties hadfiled their respective Written Submissions, the matter had been fixed for Order.

On 21.06.2018, the learned Additional Magistrate delivered an order in favour of theRespondent, granting the demolition relief. The Magistrate found, inter alia:

The Appellant had not obtained development approval under the UDA Law,

Merely submitting an application for approval does not amount to obtaining apermit, and

The Appellant’s explanation (“show cause”) cannot be accepted.

Dissatisfied by the order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant invoked the revisionaryjurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle byPetition and Affidavit dated 16.07.2018 under Case No. Rev 313/18, alleging substantiveand procedural irregularities.

The learned Judge of the High Court, after hearing oral submissions of the Counsel forthe Appellant in support of the application and submissions of the Counsel for the

4

Respondent had, delivered an order on 25.07.2018, refusing to issue notice anddismissing the revision application. The High Court had held that:

The Appellant had not produced a valid development permit, and

The learned Magistrate had adequately considered the relevant legal and factualissues.

The Petitioner (the Appellant in the instant case) has failed to submit sufficientreasons for the court to issue formal notices.

Being aggrieved by the order of the High Court, the Appellant had lodged an Appealbefore this Court, challenging both the Magistrate’s Order dated 21.06.2018 and theHigh Court Order dated 25.07.2018.

The grounds urged by the Appellant in the petition of appeal are;

a) The Judge of the High Court failed to consider the irregular nature of the “notice”

issued by the UDA.b) The institution of proceedings had not been in accordance with the provisions of

Section 136 (1) (a) and (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

However, in the written submissions of the Appellant dated 29.06.2021 inter alia thefollowing ground had also been asserted.

The Municipal Commissioner had no legal power to file the demolition application.No evidence had been submitted that the premises were in a declareddevelopment area.The commissioner is not empowered to certify development areas.

The Appellant’s consistent position had been that the Respondent MunicipalCommissioner lacked the legal authority to invoke Section 28A(3).

In Palligoda Withanage Keerthi Wimal Withana v. Muniyandy Paneer Selvam andanother1, his lordship Sripavan J. has stated that;

“For the reasons set out above, I hold that the provisions contained in Section28A(3) fall within the scope of the term ‘planning’ and therefore the powers,

1SC Appeal 123-09 SCM 18.01.2012

duties and functions referred to therein could be delegated by the UDA to anyofficer of a local authority.”

As such, the above argument of the Appellant is unattainable and is in conflict with theprevailing, established legal position.

Further, it has been held by a line of authorities from Urban Development Authority v.S.W. Kulasiri2 that in proceedings under Section 28A of the Urban Development AuthorityAct, the existence of a valid development permit issued under Section 8J is the sole anddeterminative answer to a demolition application. The burden rests unequivocally uponthe person against whom notice is issued under Section 28A(1) to adduce and establishthe existence of a valid permit. In the absence of a valid permit, the construction isdeemed unauthorised as a matter of law, obligating the Magistrate to order demolition orrestoration to original condition. Building plans, applications, or other documents cannotsubstitute for a permit, and equitable considerations cannot defeat statutory compliance.

In the instant case, the Appellant does not contest the fact that she does not have a validpermit. I am unable to find any merit in the various assertions made by the Appellant. Isee no reason to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate or the learned Judgeof the High Court. As such, I dismiss the appeal subject to cost.
