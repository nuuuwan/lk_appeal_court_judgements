"JUDGMENT"
"R. Gurusinghe, J."
"T
his  application  arises  out  of  the  partition  action  bearing  No.  136/2011/P,"
"in the District Court of Nugegoda, instituted by the plaintiff-respondent.  The"
"6th  defendant-petitioner  filed  this  Restitutio-in-Integrum  before  this  court  on"
"26-04-2024,  seeking  to  set  aside  the  interim  injunction  issued  against  the"
"petitioner on 06-01-2021.  By the  said  order, the Learned  District Judge of"
"Nugegoda, 
restrained 
the  petitioner 
from  altering 
the  nature,  causing"
"structural  alteration,  demolishing  parts  and  erecting  new  parts 
in 
the"
"portion  of  the  building  bearing  no.  158/3,  situated  in  the  corpus  of  the"
"action occupied by the 5th defendant."
"T
he plaintiff-respondent sought to partition the land called Gongahawatte in"
"extent of 15.62 perches. The petitioner states that the interim injunction was"
"obtained by suppressing and misrepresenting material facts before the court."
"The  petitioner  states  that  she  is  a  co-owner  and  occupies  a  portion  of  the"
"house in the corpus.  The petitioners’ position is that what she attempted to"
"do was necessary repairs to the roof and floor of the house, which was in a"
"very  bad  state. 
  The  petitioner 
further  states  that  her  Leave  to  Appeal"
"application 
to 
the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  of  Mount  Lavinia  was"
"dismissed.  However, a copy of that dismissal was not filed by the petitioner,"
"and the date of such dismissal was not revealed."
"T
he 
substituted-plaintiff-respondent 
filed 
objections 
to 
the  petitioner’s"
"application. 
  The  substituted-plaintiff-respondent  pointed  out 
that 
the"
"petitioner  had  failed  to  file  the  plaint  or  the  documents  before  the  District"
"Court to obtain an interim injunction.  Respondent also stated that the Civil"
"Appellate  High  Court  and 
the  District  Court  of  Nugegoda,  allowed 
the"
"petitioner  to  do  repairs  to  the  premises  which  are  necessary  to  meet  the"
"requirements of occupation."
"R
estitutio-in-Integrum is an extraordinary remedy that will be granted under"
"exceptional  circumstances.    A  party  seeking  restitution  must  act  with  the"
"utmost  promptitude.    Relief  by  way  of  Restitutio-in-Integrum  in  respect  of"
"judgments of original Courts may be sought,"
