"Limited vs Shanmugam and another [1995] 1 Sri LR 55.)"
"T
he petitioner states that the plaintiff-respondent misrepresented the fact by"
"saying  the  petitioner’s  occupation  of  the  residence  within  the  corpus  was"
"illegal. 
  However,  these  submissions  cannot  be  accepted. 
  The  plaintiff"
"herself stated in her plaint that the 6th defendant-petitioner was entitled to a"
"1/28th share from the corpus.  The respondent has not sought to prevent the"
"petitioner  from  effecting  necessary  repairs  to  the  roof.  They  sought  only  to"
"prevent  structural  alterations  that  changed  the  nature  of  the  building,  as"
"well  as  the  demolition  of  parts  of  the  building  or  the  construction  of  a  new"
"one.    The  Learned  District  Judge  has  considered  the  position  taken  up  by"
"the petitioner.  The Learned District Judge observed that since the petitioner"
"was already before the court, he could have done the necessary repairs with"
"the permission of court."
"T
he  petitioner  has 
failed 
to  substantiate 
the  claim 
that 
the  plaintiff-"
"respondent misrepresented the facts of the case.  The petitioner has not filed"
"a copy of the plaint, or a copy of the petitioners’ statement of claim, or a copy"
"of  the  preliminary  plan  before  the  District  Court.    The  petitioner  has  also"
"failed to file a copy of the order of the High Court.  The petitioner has failed"
"to tender the necessary documents with the petition."
"A
ccording to the plaint filed by the respondent, the 6th defendant-petitioner"
"is entitled to a 1/28th share of the land.  That is roughly half a perch.  The"
"Learned District Judge observed that  if  the petitioner  were  allowed to effect"
"structural changes to the building, it would prejudice the rights of the other"
"parties."
"T
he  order  of  the  Learned  District  Judge 
is  valid  only  until  the  case 
is"
"concluded.  The  District  Court  case  has  now  reached  its  final  stage.  The"
"plaintiff has closed its case, and the  6th defendant petitioner has also given"
"evidence."
