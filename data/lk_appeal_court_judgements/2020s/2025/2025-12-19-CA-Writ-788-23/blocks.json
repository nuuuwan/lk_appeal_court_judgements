It was also contended that despite the Respondents being invited by the bank to come for negotiations on the repayment plan, the Petitioner had failed to utilized the opportunity granted. The Petitioner, even by the letter marked and tendered as P37, had requested further time to make repayments, which the Respondents have granted by P38.

The main ground to impugn the said publications is that they were not published in the three languages as stipulated by the Act. I have considered the said documents and I find that they are identical in description to the previous publication that was cancelled upon the request and negotiated payment by the Petitioner. The ground to impugn being that the 2nd schedule of the Tamil language newspaper describes the mortgaged machinery in English language. However, the land to be auctioned is correctly described in all three languages. As I have stated above, in the given circumstances, I am not inclined to accept the Petitioner\u2019s highly technical objection that the validity of the entire notice is vitiated due to the mere fact that part of the subject matter to be auctioned namely the machinery is described in English in the 2nd Schedule to the Tamil publication. This is so especially when the Petitioner had not challenged the publication when it was published for the first auction, which the Petitioner thought fit to negotiate and make a payment.",

Further, this argument cannot be maintained by the conduct of the Petitioner themselves, as upon receiving the said notice the Petitioner had instituted an action in the Commercial High Court and had sought for an interim injunction to stay the auction. The Commercial High Court had rejected the Petitioner\u2019s application for an interim injunction. The order of the said Court was marked and tendered as X35, which the Petitioner has not challenged in a superior court.

Further, the documents X7 and X8 has been send to an address at Paliyagoda from which the Petitioner had replied to the letters sent by the Respondents. Also, the receipt of the letters marked as X7 and X8 is acknowledged through the letter P35, sent by the Petitioner. Further the respondents also tendered to court the registered post articles in proof of postage. Hence, the allegation that the Petitioner has not received the impugned document and challenging the said documents on the basis that they had not been sent, cannot be maintained. The Petitioner challenged the auction on the basis that the Respondents had failed to take into consideration the circumstances of the Petitioner and the inability to grant a grace period makes the resolution bad in law. This Court observes that the Petitioner\u2019s contention cannot be maintained as those grounds are legally not recognized grounds to vitiate the resolution and the auction, especially when the Petitioner after giving many opportunities to settle the loan has failed to do so and also as the Petitioner has failed to demonstrates how the said grounds are bad in law.",

It is not disputed by the parties that the Petitioner has failed to repay the said sum. The said default had commenced as early as 2019. This is reflected by the document P11. Further, numerous letters have been exchanged between the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent seeking further time for repayment and to submit the repayment plan. However, I find despite several reminders by the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner had failed to comply with the said repayment plan. Instead had been seeking for further time to settle the loan by giving various reasons which prompted the Respondent to pass a resolution under section 4 of the Act. The Petitioner on many occasions had acknowledged the debt and sought time for repayment, as submitted, it appears though the Petitioner had agreed to make repayment, has failed to bring the said agreement in to action. Accordingly, the Respondents had taken steps to auction the land in compliance with the provisions of the Act. It is observed as per the document marked X37, the auction had been carried out, and in the absence of buyers, the Respondent Bank had purchased the property and a Certificate of Sale bearing number 3037 had been issued. Further, as per the endorsement in the Certificate of Sale, the said certificate had been registered at the land",

The subsequent conduct of the Petitioner clearly demonstrates that instead of making a resolute plan to re-pay and to make arrangements to repay the loan, the Petitioner has used various tactics to delay the repayment and inevitable reliefs, the bank is entitled to under the Recovery of Loans (Special Provisions) Act. It is evident through the correspondents marked the Petitioner has used various addresses even to communicate with the bank which is again a tactic of delaying repayment. It is also observed without registering a proper address the Petitioner has tried to take advantage of his own non-compliance with the Act to challenge the notices sent by the bank in compliance with the Act.",
