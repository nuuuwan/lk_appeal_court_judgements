"such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused"
"and must only be consistent with his guilt.”"
"Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I"
"hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to"
"be  drawn,  such  an  inference  must  be  the  one  and  only  irresistible  and"
"inescapably conclusion that the accused committed the offence. When the"
"evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and"
"inescapable conclusion that  can be arrived at is that the accused committed"
"the murder of Prema Jayawardwene.”"
