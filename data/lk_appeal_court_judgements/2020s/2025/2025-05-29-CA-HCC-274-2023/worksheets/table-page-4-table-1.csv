"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  convicted  and  sentenced  the  Accused  to  death"
"based  on  the  DNA  report  that  the  blood  found  in  the  three-wheeler  of  the  1st"
"Accused was of the deceased."
"When we consider the evidence of P12, Attanayake, he has stated that he took the"
"blood samples from the place where the deceased’s body was lying. He specifically"
"stated that he never obtained any blood samples from the deceased’s body. But the"
"Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself that the sample was from the body"
"of the deceased. The particular DNA report was based on the blood sample of the"
"deceased.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  the  blood  samples  were"
"obtained from the deceased’s body."
"There  is  no  direct  evidence  against  the  Accused.  This  case  is  solely  based  on"
"circumstantial evidence."
"Thus,  it  is pertinent  to  consider  the  rules governing  the  cases  of circumstantial"
"evidence."
