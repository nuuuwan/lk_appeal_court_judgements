Facts pleaded by the petitioner are briefly as follows: The petitioner was enlisted as an Officer Cadet of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University on 12-06-2010. The petitioner was admitted to the MBBS degree programme consequent upon his signing an agreement with the Chairman of the Board of Management of General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, to undergo a course of study and training at the University for a period of five years from the date of his enlistment. The petitioner has signed a bond/agreement to serve twelve years in the Air Force. In 2016, while interning at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, the petitioner met Dr Ms. Bowala (now his wife). Dr Bowala was offered a job in the emergency department at Campbell town Hospital in New South Wales, Australia and was required to assume duties on 12-11-2021. Dr. Bowala successfully passed the Australian Medical Council examinations in 2018. Petitioner further states that he decided to marry his fianc\u00e9e prior to her departure to Australia. Whereupon, the petitioner preferred an application, by letter dated 23-08-2020 and 25-08-2020, to the Chief of Staff of the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF), requesting permission to marry Dr. Nadeesha Bowala. Petitioner further states that the marriage to Dr. Nadeesha Bowala was scheduled for 11-09-2020. Petitioner received a letter on 09-09-2020 from the Director of Administration of SLAF, requesting the petitioner to submit a declaration to the effect that he would not consider the marriage as leverage to apply for resignation, before the completion of the bonded period.",

The petitioner married Dr. Bowala on 11-09-2020. The marriage certificate was marked P7. On 21-09-2020, the petitioner addressed a letter to the Air Force Commander requesting permission to resign from the post of Flight Lieutenant. That request was not approved, and the petitioner was informed of it by letter dated 29-01-2021. By letter dated 07-10-2020, the Director, Administration of SLAF, informed the petitioner, inter alia, that SLAF is not bound to release any Officer from service on the basis of marriage to a foreign national/foreign citizen or a possible migrant. It was further stated therein that the resignation from service is not a right. That letter was marked P10. By letter marked P11 dated 29-10-2020, Director Administration SLAF informed the petitioner, \u201cit was found that you had violated the order/instruction and acted in an irresponsible manner as you have failed to obtain prior approval from the AFHQ for your marriage to Miss Bowalagaha Ralalage Tharanga Nadeesha Bowala on 11-09-2020.\u201d Further asked to show cause within 14 days as to why the recommended course of action should not be imposed on the petitioner.

A charge sheet was issued against the petitioner in terms of section 42 and section 129 of the Air Force Act, for the registration of marriage without prior permission of the Air Force Headquarters. The charge sheet was marked P15. Thereafter, the petitioner preferred a complaint to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) on 10-03-2020, stating that the refusal to grant permission to marry was violative of his fundamental rights and of the equal protection of law guaranteed to him under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. That letter is marked as P16 (A). The petitioner also states that the petitioner was willing to pay the amount due on the bond. By letter dated 17-05-2021, the petitioner wrote to the Commander of the Air Force, SLAF, detailing his marriage and his wife\u2019s employment, and requesting his resignation from the Air Force. That letter produced marked P 17. Meanwhile, the petitioner was found guilty of the offence under section 129(1) of the Air Force Act, punishable under section 42 of the Air Force Act. The decision in that regard is contained in the document marked P18.",

(b) the Medical Officers who were similarly circumstanced were permitted to resign prior to completing of the period they were bonded. (c) the refusal to permit him to resign from service and join his spouse in Australia in order to begin his family life restricts the right of the complainant and his spouse to enjoy a family life which is in contravention to Article 10 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which contrary is violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. (d) The petitioner has a legitimate expectation that he would be permitted to exercise the options to resign in terms of the conditions stipulated in clause 12(a) of the bond. Petitioner sought the relief prayed for in the prayer to the petition. The 1st and 2nd respondents have filed their objections to the petitioner\u2019s application. Respondents raised the preliminary objection that the order made by His Excellency the President affirming the recommendations of the 1st respondent cannot be maintained, and that, in terms of Article 35 of the Constitution, the Court has no jurisdiction. The respondents further pleaded that the petitioner\u2019s application to quash the document P26 is futile, as the petitioner has failed to impugn the preceding decisions not to recommend the resignation of the petitioner.

The petitioner was severely reprimanded as the punishment.

As noted above, there is a dearth of Medical Officers in the SLAF. From the time of enlistment to obtain service as a Medical Officer, it would take about six and a half years. During those six and a half years, even though no service can be obtained from such a person, the SLAF has to pay his salary and other allowances. The petitioner had been paid for six years and five months, though no service was rendered during that period, with the expectation that the petitioner would serve in the SLAF for at least twelve years from his graduation as a Medical Officer. The petitioner married his wife with full knowledge that he would have to serve in the SLAF for at least 12 years. He did not obtain permission for the marriage. He submitted an application to the SLAF seeking permission to marry, but he did not wait for a response. Within two weeks of the application, he entered into the marriage. As this was an offence, the petitioner was found guilty and severely reprimanded. The Learned State Counsel submitted that, after filing this application before this Court, the petitioner has deserted the Air Force and now apparently lives in Australia. Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim that he had a clean record. In the case of Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Rathnapura and another [1996] 2 Sri LR 70. Justice F.N.D. Jayasuriya held \u201ca petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has the discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction, are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief.\u201d In the case of Siddeek vs. Jacolyn Seneviratne and Three Others [1984] 1 Sri LR 83, Soza J. stated, citing from two Administrative Law text books,\u201cThus, Certiorari is a discretionary remedy and may be withheld if the conduct of the applicant or it would seem, the nature of the error does not justify judicial intervention.\u201d In terms of section 11 (1) of the Air Force Act, an Officer of the Regular Air Force has no right to resign his commission.

    "text": "the SLAF by the petitioner stated \u201cIn this backdrop, the ROG forwarded by the Officer seeking resignation of commission is not recommend in the best interest of the SLAF and to elude formalising a precedent among Tri Service Medical Officers under the same category to gain MBBS qualification and leave the services as and when they decide.\u201d The President approved the recommendations referred to by the Ministry of Defence, and the same was informed to the Ministry of Defence by letter dated 23-03-2023. Moreover, the petitioner cannot argue that, under the agreement marked P2, he is entitled to pay the amount stipulated therein and resign from the commission. The agreement should be read in line with the provisions of the Air Force Act, and the agreement cannot override the express provisions of the Act. In the case of P.S. Bus Company Limited vs. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61 NLR 491, the court held, inter alia,\u201cThe Court should also take into consideration the disastrous consequences of granting the Writ.\u201d Considering the conduct of the petitioner, the court cannot use its discretion in favour of the petitioner. If the Court allowed the petitioner's application, it could set a bad precedent and as the Air Force Commander expressed his fear, lead Tri Services Medical Officers in the same category to gain MBBS qualifications and leave the service as and when they decide to do so. In the above circumstances, the respondents have acted in accordance with the provisions of the Air Force Act. The recommendations of the 1st respondent to the Ministry of Defence cannot be considered arbitrary or ultra vires. Therefore, the application of the petitioner is dismissed.",
