JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Appellant"), who is the father of

the victim, was indicted before the High Court of Hambanthota on three counts of grave

sexual abuse against a minor, Loku Kaluthotage Kavishani Kaushalya punishable under

Section 365B (2)(b) of the Penal Code, as amended by Acts Nos. 22 of 1995, 28 of 1998,

and 16 of 2006.

At the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through 6 witnesses and marking

productions P1-P2 and thereafter closed its case. In defence, the Appellant has given a

dock statement.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court delivered judgment on

22.05.2024. The Appellant was found guilty on the 1st count of the indictment and

sentenced to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 10,000, with a default

sentence of 10 months rigorous imprisonment. A compensation of Rs. 100,000/- was

ordered to be paid to the victim; in default, a term of 1 year of rigorous imprisonment.

Furthermore, the appellants were acquitted with the 2nd and 3rd counts.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of the Learned High Court Judge, the

Appellant has preferred this appeal to this court. The grounds of appeal as pleaded by the

Appellant are as follows;

i. The Hon. High Court Judge misdirected himself and erred in failing to consider

the uncertainty surrounding the first information of the alleged offence. The

conflicting evidence as to how and when the complaint originated was not

properly examined. This constitutes a vital misdirection affecting the fairness

of the trial.

ii. The Hon. High Court Judge failed to consider the legal presumption under

Section 114(t) of the Evidence Ordinance arising from the suppression of

material witnesses.

The omission to consider this presumption constitutes a serious misdirection

in law.

iii. By omitting to evaluate the absence of conclusive medical corroboration, the

Hon. High Court Judge erred in law and misdirected himself on a material

aspect of the case.

iv. The Hon. High Court Judge erred by failing to consider the wider context of

family conflict and prolonged institutional care, which could have influenced

the testimony and credibility of PW1, leading to miscarriage of justice.

v. The Hon. High Court Judge erred in failing to consider the need for

corroboration of the child's testimony, especially given the inconsistencies and

surrounding circumstances that warranted such caution.

vi. The Hon. High Court Judge erred in rejecting the dock statement solely for

lack of prior cross-examination, without assessing its independent probative

value.

vii. The non consideration of the "ghost factor" amounts to a misdirection and an

error on the part of the Hon. High Court Judge, as it reflects a failure to engage

with a plausible alternative explanation.

Page 4 of 9

viii. Failure to consider the Accused-Appellant socio-economic condition as a

mitigating factor in sentencing amounts to an error in law and a misdirection.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows.

PW 01, Kavishani Kaushalya, the victim in this case, testified that she was 10 years old

at the time of the incident and was 15 years old when giving her testimony. She stated

that in December 2014, she had been placed on probation due to abuse from the Appellant.

The witness further confirmed that the incidents occurred during 2013 and 2014. She

revealed the matter to one of the neighbouring aunts. According to her testimony, the

incidents took place when her mother, PW 02, was on the night shift and no one else was

at home. Further, the witness stated that such an incident had occurred in 2013, with the

last incident taking place in 2014. She further testified that, thereafter, a neighbouring

aunt advised her to disclose the matter at the seminar held at the school the following

day, where police officers were present.

The witness stated that on the day of the last incident, her elder siblings were at school.

She and her youngest sister returned home from school at around 1:45 p.m. The Appellant

arrived shortly thereafter and made her younger sister leave. At that time, according to

the witness, the Appellant sent her younger sister to the woman with whom he was

allegedly having an extramarital affair, who had just moved to their neighbourhood. It is

noted that this incident occurred prior to the matter being reported to the police.

The witness has described another incident that occurred 2 days prior to the last incident.

According to her testimony, while she was asleep, the Appellant removed her clothing.

When she attempted to shout, the Appellant threatened to kill her. She further stated

that the Appellant engaged in sexual assault by rubbing his genital organ against her

vagina. Thereafter, he instructed her to go and wash.

The witness admitted that she did not disclose the incident to PW 02 because the

Appellant had threatened her, stating that he would kill her mother as well. According to

her testimony, she revealed that the Appellant had committed similar acts on several

occasions prior to the incident in question. It is further noted that the prosecution referred

to another incident that occurred during the night.

According to her testimony, while she was sleeping, she suddenly awoke to find herself

undressed. We note that she did not clearly disclose what had happened to her on that

day.

It is further noted that the witness disclosed another incident which occurred while she

was at her aunt’s house. According to her testimony, the Appellant summoned her to their

house and compelled her to undress. He then made her lie down, and as described by the

witness, rubbed his genital organ against her vagina.

The witness described that three incidents had occurred to her, one at night and two

during the daytime. She further disclosed that she made a statement to the police on 5th

November 2014. She firmly stated that, on the day she was sleeping at night, she did not

know what had happened to her.

උ : ඔව්.

During cross-examination, the defence suggested that the mother of the victim had

engaged in an extramarital affair. The witness denied this allegation and stated instead

that it was the Appellant who had maintained such an affair. She further stated that she

had informed her neighbouring aunt, Senori, about the incident. Following this disclosure,

the police came to the school and recorded her statement. It is observed that the defence

questioned the witness regarding the dress she was wearing during the last incident,

which had occurred five years earlier. The defence then highlighted a contradiction

concerning the colour of the dress. With regard to one incident in which the father came

and asked the witness to come to the house, it was marked as an omission, as she had

failed to disclose this fact to the police in her initial statement. That is a second incident

in which she described how the sexual assault took place. The Learned High Court judge

has considered this omission in his Judgment.

We note that, without taking into account the fact that the victim was a child, the defence

proposed numerous questions as follows.

Further, the defence proposed that the witness was falsely accusing the Appellant due to

PW 02’s alleged extramarital affair. The witness denied this suggestion. However, it

remains a fact that all her children were placed under probation.

Upon the conclusion of the prosecution’s evidence, the Appellant gave a dock statement.

The Appellant denied all allegations and asserted that PW 02 had instructed the victim

to falsely accuse him, allegedly due to her extramarital affair.

The Learned High Court Judge observed that, during the cross-examination of PW 02,

the defence did not raise any questions regarding her alleged extramarital affair.

ප්‍රමොණෙත්ත පහරතුෙක් නැත.”

Considering the above evidence, the Learned High Court Judge concluded that the

prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the

second and third counts.

Page 180 of the brief,

“කෙකසේ කෙතත් කෙෙ තීන්දුකේදී මීට කෙර සඳහන්ද ෙරන ලද ෙරිදි ෙැමිණිලි කිරීෙට දිනෙට කෙර සිු වූ සිුවීෙ

ෙෙණක් ඇයකේ සාක්ිකයහි සලො බැලිය යුතු සාක්ිය ෙශකයන්ද නිගෙනය ෙරන ලදි.”

When we analyse the testimony of PW 01, it is evident that she remained consistent with

regard to the first count. We note that the contradiction that was marked by the defence

is not sufficient for us to disbelieve the victim. We further observe that her testimony has

been steady and coherent throughout the examination and cross-examination regarding

the first count.

It is pertinent to refer to the following judgments.

In Premasiri V. The Queen 77 N.L.R 86 Court of Criminal Appeal, Alles, J held:-

“In a charge of rape it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated

evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as to

convince the Jury that she is speaking the truth.”

In Sunil and another V. The Attorney General 1986 1 SLR 230it was held that:-

“ it is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman victim of

a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could be acted on even

in the absence of corroboration.”

In the case of Thambarasa Sabaratnam v. Attorney General, CA 127/2012, Decided on

03.08.2015, H.N. J. Perera,J. (as he was then)

“Thus the court could have acted on the evidence of the victim provided the trial

Judge was convinced that she was giving cogent, inspiring and truthful testimony

in court.”

Page 9 of 9

In light of the judgments and the evidence she has presented, and with no substantial

grounds to question her credibility, we find no reason to reject her account of events.

Upon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution has established, beyond a

reasonable doubt, that regarding the first count.

In the light of the foregoing, the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge are hereby affirmed. I am not inclined to interfere with the disputed

judgment, together with the sentencing order and dismiss the appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed.
