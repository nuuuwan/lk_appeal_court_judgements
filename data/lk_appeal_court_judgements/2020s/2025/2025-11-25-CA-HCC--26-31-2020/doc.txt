JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused–Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and

6th Appellant) were indicted before the High Court of Galle on the following counts:

1. That on or about the 29th of January 2011 at Katudampe within the

jurisdictional limits of this court above above-named Accused, being a member

of an Unlawful Assembly with the Common Object of causing hurt to Galla

Dehige Gaya Chaminda and thereby committed an offence punishable under

section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. That at the same time, place and the same transaction as above Charge No.

01 caused the death of Galla Dehige Gaya Chaminda and thereby committed

an offence punishable under section 296 read with section 146 of the Penal

Code.

4 of 32

3. That at the same time, place and the same transaction as above Charge No.

01 cause voluntarily hurt to Kasthuri Alison and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 315 read with section 146 of the Penal Code.

4. That at the same time, place and the same transaction as above Charge No.

01 cause the death of Galla Dehige Gaya Chaminda and thereby committed an

offence punishable under section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

5. That at the same time, place and the same transaction as above Charge No.

01 cause voluntarily hurt to Kasthuri Alison and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 315 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

At the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through thirteen witnesses and

marked productions P1-P6 and thereafter closed its case. At the closure of the

prosecution's case, the counsel for the Appellants made an application under Section

200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act requesting the courts to acquit the

Appellant without calling the defence, and the Learned High Court Judge has

rejected the application.

Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge directed the defence to call their witnesses.

The 1st,3rd,4th,5th, and 6th Appellants, in their defence, made dock statements, and

the 2nd Appellant opted to remain silent. Additionally, the 1st and 3rd Appellants

called 4 witnesses in their defence.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court delivered judgment

on 19 February 2020. All the Appellants were found guilty on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th

counts of the indictment. For the 1st count, sentenced to six months’ simple

imprisonment and fined Rs. 2,500, with a default sentence of three months’ rigorous

imprisonment and on the 2nd and 4th counts, the sentence of death was imposed.

Furthermore, the appellants were acquitted of the 3rd and 5th counts.

5 of 32

Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned

High Court Judge, all the appellants preferred an appeal before this Court. I have

formulated the following grounds as urged by all the Appellants.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider Omissions and

Contradictions of the prosecution witnesses

2. Whether the High Court Judge failed to consider and evaluate the fact that

deceased failed to identify the Accused and therefore he did not mention the

names of the Accused to his wife.

3. Whether the prosecution has failed to prove the common object as required

by section 146 of the Penal Code

4. Whether the High Court Judge failed to consider and evaluate the dock

statements and evidence of witnesses called by defense.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW 2, Kasthuri Wimalawathi, the mother-in-law of the deceased, was residing with

her daughter (PW 3), the deceased, their children and along with her parents on

29.01.2011. While she was watching the news around 8:30 p.m. together with the

deceased, she had seen the 1st and 5th Appellant arriving in a three-wheeler and

commencing a quarrel in front of the house. At that point, the witness’s mother, PW

4, who is not summoned by the prosecution, intervened and stated: “මෙතන ගහ ගන්න

එපා, අපිට සාක්ෂි මෙන්න වේවි” and the Appellant responded by verbally abusing her. The

deceased then also intervened, saying: “ෙචං මෙතන ගහ ගන්න එපා, ඒ ෙනුස්සයා කියන්මන්

ඇත්තමන්”. Immediately thereafter, the 1st Appellant struck the deceased with the belt.

After the incident, the deceased remarked: “ෙට ගැහුවට කෙක්ෂ නෑ, යන්න” and following

his statement, the 1st and the 5th Appellant departed from the scene. The witness

further testified that she had known both Appellants for a period of 7 to 8 years.

Further, she stated that the 1st Appellant is also known as the son of SI Anura, who

resides in ‘පලමමගාඩ රණවිරු මගෙර’ and that the 5th Appellant was also known by the

alias ‘බලු අන්ඩා’.

6 of 32

After about 30 minutes, a three‑wheeler arrived carrying five individuals, shouting

“චන්ිමයෝ වමරව්.” The witness testified that among them she identified 4, but she

revealed only the 1st, 3rd, and 6th Appellant, whose names were revealed to be

Dinushka, Nisal, and Indika. The witness also stated that the 3rd Appellant is also

known to her for a period of 7 to 8 years. We note that the witness identified all three

Appellants by name and knew them for a long period of time.

Further, she stated that she didn't identify the other 2 people who came. The 1st,

namely Dinushka, and 3rd, namely Nisal, Appellant then dragged the deceased, who

had been seated on the veranda, and the 3 Appellant struck him with iron rods. Then

she identified the 6th Appellant, who had struck him. She stated the PW 3 was with

her in the veranda, and at the time, she could see them in the light of the veranda.

The assault lasted for approximately 30 minutes, and each time the deceased

attempted to rise, he was struck again. Around 9:00 p.m., the deceased was admitted

to Karapitiya Hospital. According to her, when the Appellant attacked the deceased,

PW 1 was in the kitchen.

The witness identified the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Appellant in the identification

parade. According to her, the 2nd Appellant was there and did not assault the

deceased but stated ‘චන්ිකෙ මපන්වනවයි කියල’. Later, she says that the 1st, 2nd and

3rd Appellants were attacking, 4th was there. Further, she has stated that the

Appellant has left the scene with 2 three-wheelers. The deceased succumbed to his

injuries on 02.02.2011, and on that day, she gave a statement to the police. The iron

rods used in the attack were handed over to the police the following morning. We note

that she has not mentioned how PW 1 got involved in the scene.

During cross‑examination, the witness identified that her sister, Chandrika, came

during the second incident. After the first incident, when the deceased son-in-law was

struck and PW 4, the mother was verbally abused; the witness stated that she

subsequently went back inside and watched television. The plausibility of such

conduct is questionable, given the gravity of the situation. She affirmed in the cross-

examination that only two people were involved with the first incident. She admitted

7 of 32

the fact that she had not gone to the police on that day, and the daughter, PW 3 and

PW 4, the mother of the witness, had gone to the police. Defence suggested to the

witness that no one had gone to the police, and the witness denied that statement.

PW 2 admitted the fact that she had given a statement to the police on 30.02.2011.

Later, she denied the statement that with PW 4, she had gone outside to see the fight

in the first incident. Further, the defence marked a contradiction arising from the

police statement dated 30th, wherein it was recorded that on that day, when the

witness and her mother (PW 4) came outside, they heard the words “ෙට ගහන්න එපා,

ොව මේරගන්න”. The witness denied having made such a statement, and the defence

accordingly marked this as Contradiction No. 1V1.

We note that she was not sure about the evidence she gave.

පටිමයන් ගැහුමව් දිනුෂ්ක

At that stage, it is observed that the Court adjourned the proceedings.

The defence counsel also highlighted an omission in the police statement, specifically

the phrase “මතෝ ෙරනවා ත්‍රී වීල් රථය තුලදීෙ,” and the quarrel between the 1st and the 5th

Appellant. Further, she admitted the fact that she made two statements to the police.

The defence counsel highlighted the omission that in the police statement, there is no

mention of the 1st Appellant hitting the deceased.

The defence suggested that, during the inquest, if the witness was certain that the

1st Appellant, Dinushka, had struck the deceased with a belt, she would have stated

so at that stage. The defence argued that her failure to mention it was because the

1st Appellant had not in fact committed the act. In response, the witness replied as

follows:

උ : පිලිගන්නවා ස්වාමිනි.

We observe that if the witness was already familiar with the 1st Appellant, there

would have been no necessity to identify him at the identification parade. Counsel

further noted a contradiction in her testimony regarding the first occasion, where she

stated that three individuals arrived in a three‑wheeler. This account is inconsistent

with her earlier statement, which has now been shown to be incorrect.

උ : ඒක වැරදියි.

When the Learned High Court Judge was considering the evidence of PW 2, he made

the following observations:

1. According to the witness, in the first incident, only two individuals arrived

and began to quarrel.

9 of 32

2. At that time, the 1st Appellant struck the deceased, though this fact was not

mentioned in his testimony.

3. In the second incident, six persons came and attacked the deceased; however,

the witness referred to only five individuals and, at the identification parade,

identified the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Appellant.

Page 951 of the brief,

‘මෙෙ සිේධිමයන් විනාි 30කට පෙණ පසු 06 මෙමනකුමේ කණ්ඩායෙක්ෂ පැමිණ 05 මෙමනකු

ඇෙමගන ඇවිත් පහර දුන් බවෙ අභිමයෝගයට ලක්ෂ මනාමව්.’

We note that the Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded that she had no

clear recollection of when she made her statement to the police, rendering the timing

of that statement questionable. According to her, the deceased had conveyed the

names to his daughter, PW 3, and it was only through PW 3 that she came to know

the names of the Appellant.

We note that according to the testimony of PW 6, the deceased did not provide any

names in his police statement. If that is the case, the question arises as to how PW 3

came to know the names of the Appellant. This inconsistency calls for closer scrutiny.

Accordingly, the focus now shifts to the testimony of PW 3.

PW 3, Kasthuri Kumari Kusumawathi, the wife of the deceased, testified that while

they were watching the news along with her kids, the deceased and her grandparents,

three individuals came and began fighting in front of their house. At that time, her

grandmother, PW4, shouted, and the deceased also intervened, asking them not to

fight. Thereafter, the 5th Appellant struck the deceased with a belt. However, it is

noted that PW 2 had stated that the 1st Appellant struck the deceased. She identified

the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Appellants as being there in the first incident.

Subsequently, a crowd arrived in a three‑wheeler, and two individuals dragged the

deceased, while another struck him with an iron rod. According to PW 3, the 2nd and

3rd Appellant were holding the deceased, but she did not identify the person who

10 of 32

delivered the blow. We note that PW 1 was also injured during the incident, but there

is no indication from the witness regarding how and when they took him to the

hospital. Thereafter, the deceased was taken to the hospital, where, according to her

testimony, he succumbed to his injuries on 02.02.2011. According to the witness,

before the death of the deceased, when she visited the hospital, the deceased disclosed

to her the names of those who had assaulted him, namely Nilushka, Dinesh, Nisal,

Anura, and Dinushka, on 30.02.2011. She confirmed that these individuals had been

known to her since childhood.

She identified in court the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Appellants, consistent with

the statement attributed to the deceased. She further stated that she knew the 5th

Appellant as “Balu Anda.” Further, the witness has admitted that her mother’s sister

had given evidence to the police, and she herself confirmed that she provided her

statement the following morning. At the identification parade, she recognized

Nilushka (1st Appellant), Nihal (3rd Appellant), and Dinesh (2nd Appellant). She

11 of 32

also confirmed that three individuals had assaulted the deceased. She admitted that

she lodged her complaint on the same day. It is noteworthy that, during the first

incident, the deceased addressed the Appellant as “machan.” The witness has

admitted the fact that the deceased was familiar with those individuals, and that was

why he addressed them as “machan.” If that was indeed the case, a serious question

arises as to why the deceased did not disclose their identities to the police when

reporting the incident.

This witness admitted that the 5th Appellant was known by other names such as

“Balu Anda,” “Anura Priyantha,” or “Anura Shantha”. However, any of the names

were mentioned in her police statement. She further stated that she made her

statement on the 30th, but this was not corroborated by the police witnesses. It is

also noted that she mentioned the 1st and 3rd Appellant as holding the deceased, yet

she did not observe who actually struck him. Later contradicting the witness’s earlier

statement, she stated that one individual held the deceased while two others attacked

the deceased, which was marked as contradiction 1V5 by the defence.

This witness admitted that she had only seen five people in total in the second

incident. She further took the position that, following the first incident, all of them

remained outside. When the question was put to the witness, she contradicted her

earlier statement and stated that 5 people came and dragged the deceased, which

was marked as contradiction 1V8.

It is to be noted that PW 2 had testified that, while they were inside, the Appellant

came and dragged the deceased. This contradiction was highlighted during the

inquest, where she made a statement before the Magistrate confirming that the

Appellant had come and dragged the deceased. Further, the defence suggested that,

during the inquest, she had not mentioned the name of “Balu Anda,” although he was

known to her. This omission was marked, as in her statement dated 30.02.2011, she

did not mention any names.

12 of 32

Furthermore, the defence counsel suggested that the 3rd appellant, Nisal Chandana,

was known to the witness, and that on 30.02.2011, after the deceased had disclosed

his name, she failed to mention it to the police because he had not been present. The

witness denied this suggestion. She nevertheless admitted that she had not disclosed

the name of Nisal Chandana during the inquest either.

PW 3 admitted during the inquest that the 3rd Appellant was holding the hand of the

deceased. We note that, in her original testimony, she stated that the 3rd Appellant

had come. However, she later altered her position, saying that she had only seen him

during the second incident, which was marked as omission O3 by the defence.

Further, she admitted that in both incidents the 4th Appellant was not present.

Page 400 of the brief,

උ : ෙැක්ෂමක්ෂ නැහැ ස්වාමිනි

Furthermore, when questioned by counsel regarding the 5th Appellant, she denied

the suggestion that she had made no reference to him in her police statement. She

stated that she had mentioned the name “Balu Anda” or “Anura Priyantha” to the

police. The defence marked this as omission O4.

The defence primarily contended that, upon evaluating the testimony of PW2 and

PW3, the court should find their evidence wholly unreliable and devoid of credibility.

The central objection was that the Learned High Court Judge failed to properly

address the contradictions and omissions that cast serious doubt on the truthfulness

of these witnesses.

Although the defence counsel highlighted certain contradictions and omissions, the

Learned High Court Judge found them immaterial and provided the following

13 of 32

reasons. It is noteworthy to refer to the portion of the judgment of the Learned High

Court Judge.

Page 962 of the brief,

“වෙෙ සිද්ධිවේ සිද්ධදිෙය ක්‍රියාදාෙය තුල ක්ෂණිකව වවනස් වන විවිධ අවස්ථාවන් සම්බන්ධවයන්

අවවබෝධ කර ගත හැක.”

Before analysing the contradictions and omissions highlighted by the defence, it is

necessary to first consider how our courts have traditionally approached such

inconsistencies when assessing the credibility of witness testimony.

It would be relevant to reproduce the relevant portion about the contradictions

expressed in Sir John Woodroffe and Amir Ali, in the book of Law of Evidence, 18th

Edition, Vol. I, page 425,

“(6) CONTRADICTIONS AND OMISSIONS

In regard to appreciation of evidence regarding the contradictions and

omissions, they generally arise under s 162, Cr PC 1973. In Ponnusami Chetty

v Emperor, Burn J of the Madras High Court took an extreme position and

observed:

Whether it is considered as a question of logic or of language, 'omission and

'contradiction' can never be identical. If a proposition is stated, any

contradictory proposition must be a statement of some kind, whether positive

or negative. To contradict means to 'speak against' or in one word to 'gainsay'.

It is absurd to say that you can contradict by keeping silence. Silence may be

full of significance, but it is not 'diction' and therefore it cannot be

'contradiction'...The same conclusion follows from a consideration of s 145,

Evidence Act. If it is intended to contradict the witness by the writing, his

attention must be called to those parts of the writing which are to be used to

contradict him. It would be sheer misuse of words to say that you are

14 of 32

contradicting a witness by the writing, when what you really want to do is to

contradict him by pointing out omissions from the writing...A witness cannot

be confronted with the unwritten record of an unmade statement...It is

impossible to state a case in which an omission amounts to a contradiction...s

162 can only be used in order to show that the witness in the box is

contradicting something he had said before...It is not permissible to use such

statements in order to show 'development' of the prosecution case; it is only

permissible to use them to prove contradictions...

………………………

In State v Ram Bali, the Allahabad High Court expressed the same principle

and observed:

A statement recorded by the police under s 162 can be used for one purpose

and one purpose only and that of contradicting the witness.

Therefore, if there is no contradiction between his evidence in court and his

recorded statement in the diary, the latter cannot be used at all. If a witness

deposed in court that a certain fact existed but had stated under s 162, either

that fact had not existed or that the reverse and irreconcilable fact had existed,

it is a case of conflict between the deposition in the court and the statement

under s 162 and the latter can be used to contradict the former. But if he had

not stated under s 162, anything about the fact, there is no conflict and the

statement cannot be used to contradict him. In some cases, an omission in the

statement under s 162 may amount to contradiction of the deposition in court;

they are the cases where what is actually stated is irreconcilable with what is

omitted and impliedly negatives its existence. If the statement under s 162 can

be reconciled with the deposition in court and can stand with it, there is

absolutely no conflict. An omission is not a contradiction unless what is said

actually contradicts what is omitted to be said. The test to find out whether an

omission is a contradiction or not, is to see whether one can point to any

sentence or assertion which is irreconcilable with the deposition in the court.

It would be quite meaningless to say that the entire statement under s 162

15 of 32

contradicts the deposition: therefore, one cannot point to the entire statement

as being irreconcilable with the deposition.”

State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K. Anthony, reported in Supreme Court Journal 1984 (2)

page 498,

“While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether

the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate

them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given

by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as

to render it unworthy of belief.”

Further, Jayasuriya J held in Banda & others v AG 1999 (3) SLR page 172

“Having regard to the omission proved, in evaluating the testimony of a

witness, a Court would be guided by principles of common sense and by certain

tests of credibility that are employed to assess credibility. When one goes

through proceedings, it is evident that the learned defence counsel had closely

looked at the statement made by Andrayas to the Police and also looked at the

inquest evidence Andrayas had given before the Magistrate and had attempted

to mark contradictions in relation to that statement and the inquest evidence.

Vide pages 126 and 129 of the record, where there is a specific reference to

contradictions marked 5VI and 5V2. These contradictions certainly do not

cause any dent whatsoever on the testimonial trustworthiness of witness

Andrayas. Thus, after the aforesaid attempt failed the resulting position in

regard to the Police statement and inquest evidence is that the test of

inconsistency and consistency echoes in favour of the witness' credibility.

Besides, there are no contradictions and inconsistencies in his evidence per se

or inter se.

16 of 32

…………………………

By proving omissions is another method of assailing the testimonial

trustworthiness of a witness.”

Chandra Ekanayake, J in Padmatilake (Sgt) V. Director General, Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery/Corruption 2009 2 SLR Page 151, Held that;

“ It has to be stressed here that credibility of prosecution witnesses should be

subject to judicial evaluation in totality and not isolated scrutiny by the Judge.

When witnesses make inconsistent statements in their evidence either at one

stage of at two stages, the testimony of such witnesses is unreliable and in the

absence of special circumstances, no conviction can be based on the testimony

of such witnesses. On the other hand, one cannot be unmindful of the

proposition that Court cannot mechanically reject the evidence of any witness.”

In light of the foregoing judgments, our attention now turns to the evidence of PW2.

The defence has highlighted the following contradictions in her testimony.

These contradictions and omissions strike at the very root of the case, undermining

the credibility of the witness. Upon analysis, her testimony reveals a lack of

consistency, which reflects unfavorably on her reliability. The inconsistencies further

weaken the trustworthiness of her evidence.

When we consider the evidence of PW 2 after the incident, she has not indicated any

names in her statement. Although she knew the Appellant, she could not name them.

Further, we note that when we analyse her evidence with PW 3, there is a discrepancy

between them. Also, we are mindful that according to her, the deceased has told PW

2, who is the daughter of this witness, the names of the Appellants. This evidence is

totally false. It is pertinent to refer to PW 6.

PW 6, Gamini Ihalawela, the police officer who supervised the investigation on

04.02.2011, arrested the 4th Appellant and the 1st Appellant, who is the son of SI

Anura. Further, he stated that the hospital police at Karapitiya recorded a statement

from the deceased before his death.

During cross-examination, the witness stated that the first complaint was lodged on

January 30, 2011, by Kusuma, PW4, the wife of PW1. We note that this witness was

not summoned by the prosecution. Until that time, the hospital police had not

provided any information regarding the deceased. On 02.02.2011, when they filed the

B report, there was no mention of the names of the suspects. It shows that PW 4,

when giving evidence to the police, did not mention any names.

The witness further testified that PS 19864 Waharathanthri Anura recorded the

statement of the deceased on 30.01.2011 at 9.35 a.m. Further witness admitted that

he obtained and read the statement from the hospital police. The hospital police

subsequently informed the police station of this statement on 31.01.2011 via

telephone call. In that communication, it was noted that the deceased had said he

could identify six individuals as having assaulted him, though he did not mention any

names.

After obtaining and reading the statement, the witness confirmed the details that

had been conveyed in the earlier call. Subsequently, the hospital police informed the

22 of 32

witness of the death of the deceased on 02.02.2011. The witness admitted that the

first B report was filled based on information given by Jayasena. When filling the B

report, the witness admitted the statements of Walage Kusuma and Kasthuri

Wimalawathi.

Page 496 of the brief,

උ : එවහෙයි උතුොවණනි.

The witness admitted the fact that he arrested the 3rd Appellant on 09th September

2011. Further, in the 1st B report, the names of the 1st and 3rd Appellants were not

included. The witness admitted the fact that the Wimalawathi statement was

recorded before the 1st B report was filed. The witness also testified that PW 2 had

stated, “පලමමගාඩ බස් නැවතුම පළ අසල නිවමස් සිටිය අය” and based on that disclosure, he

proceeded to arrest the 1st Appellant. Furthermore, defence counsel inquired

whether any names had been mentioned by any witness, to which the witness

responded that Chandrika Damayanthi had disclosed certain names in her statement

dated 02.02.2011.

In the B report, the witness stated that the name of a suspect, called Champika, is

there.

Page 510 of the brief,

ප්‍ර : ඒ බී වාර්තාවේ ඔබ වහායන සැකකරුවවෝ අතවර් චම්පික කියන සැකකාරවයක් ඉන්නවා

23 of 32

උ : එවහෙයි උතුොණනි.

ප්‍ර : ඒ බී වාර්තාවේ ඒක පැහැදිලිව සටහන් කරල තිවබනවා?

උ : එවහෙයි.

This person is not indicted as an Appellant in the indictment.

Page 195 of the brief,

ප්‍ර : තමුන් දැක්වක් නැහැ?

උ : ෙෙ කියන වද්ධ වනාවවයි ෙට කියවවන්වන්.උවද්ධට කෑවවත් නැහැ දැන් ෙට බඩගිනි

ස්වාමිනි.පටිවයන් ගැහුවේ දිනුෂ්ක.

The witness admitted the fact that the witnesses had failed to mention any names. It

is noted that this witness effected the arrest of the Appellants only after conducting

an investigation. This indicates that the witnesses had not disclosed or identified any

names beforehand. But according to PW 2, she has stated that her husband, the

deceased, disclosed the names of the Appellants.

Page 298 of the brief,

ප්‍ර : මොනවෙ කියපු නම?

උ : ඔක්ෂමකාමේෙ නම කිවුවා

ප්‍ර : ඒ කියපු නම ටික අපිටත් කියන්න ?

උ :නිලුෂ්ක, දිමන්ෂ්, නිසල්, අනුර දිනුෂ්ක

It should be observed that her statement was recorded only after the death of the

deceased. This raises a pertinent question: how did she inform the police of the names

of the Appellants when her husband himself had not disclosed any names? The only

reasonable inference this Court can draw is that the names were disclosed to her by

interested parties for reasons not otherwise apparent. This creates doubt about her

truthfulness of the evidence.

24 of 32

Furthermore, we note the following contradictions and omissions, as highlighted by

the defence during trial, arising from the statement made to the police and the

evidence given at the inquest testimony of PW3, which were not considered by the

Learned High Court Judge. Now we refer to the contradictions marked by the defence

during the cross-examination of PW 3.

We further note that during the cross-examination, she totally denied that she had

seen the 4th Appellant in the scene.

30 of 32

When we analyse the evidence, her evidence is not consistent. We observe there is a

contradiction between PW 2 and PW 3. PW 2 states that in the 1st incident, she has

identified 2 people, namely 1st and the 5th Appellants. But PW 3 states that she

identifies the 1st,2nd and 5th Appellants. But according to her, she knows the name of

the 5th Appellant, but she has not disclosed the name to the police.

With respect to the second incident, PW 2 testified that five individuals arrived in a

vehicle. The 1st and 3rd Appellants entered the house and dragged the deceased

outside. While they restrained him, the 6th Appellant delivered the blow. However,

we note that the PW 2 made no reference to the 4th and 5th Appellants. It is also

noted that PW 1, though injured, was unable to identify any of the assailants.

However, according to PW 2 and PW 3, all the accused are from the same locality.

The contradictions and omissions noted above, coupled with the fact that the deceased

was unable to identify any of the Appellants by name, have undermined the

credibility of the eyewitnesses.

Also, we are mindful that the Learned High Court Judge failed to analyse the

common intention. He has failed to describe how each individual participated. We are

conscious that mere presence at the scene, without active participation, is not

sufficient to establish guilt. Also, there is a doubt whether 5 or 6 people came in the

second incident. According to PW 3, she has identified only 3 people among them. In

the said indictment, there is no mention of the unknown person being also involved.

And she further stated that two people hold the deceased, Dinesh Kumara, 2nd

Appellant and Nisal Chandana, 3rd Appellant. But she has not identified any other

person who hit the deceased.

The Learned High Court Judge failed to take this version into account. Subsequently,

PW2 stated that the deceased had mentioned the names of the Appellants. In relation

to her testimony, she asserted that during the first incident, she identified the 1st

and 5th Appellant. In the second incident, she claimed that five individuals arrived

in a three-wheeler, yet she identified only four of them, and among those, she

mentioned merely three names.

Furthermore, she stated that she knew them by name, as they had been known to

her for more than seven years, and also that they are from ‘පලම්වතාට’. However, we

note that the witness only identified the 1st Appellant, the 3rd Appellant, and the 6th

Appellant. She further stated that the 1st and the 3rd Appellants dragged the deceased

from the house, and Indika 6th Appellant, only attacked him. She identified the

1st,2nd,3rd and 4th Appellants in the identification parade. She stated that the 2nd

32 of 32

Appellant was assisting the 1st Appellant, and the 4th was standing. However, we note

that the 2nd and 4th Appellants' names were transcribed after the leading questions

were asked by the state.

Upon analysing the testimony of PW 3, it is evident that there is no indication of

participation by all six Appellants. Nevertheless, the Learned High Court Judge

concluded that each of them was a member of the unlawful assembly.

Upon consideration of the entire body of evidence, I find that the testimony presented

before the Learned High Court Judge, particularly that of PW2 and PW3, is wholly

devoid of credibility and cannot be accorded any degree of trustworthiness.

I hold that the evidence led by the Prosecution is insufficient to establish the guilt of

the Appellants beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, for the reasons set out above,

the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge dated 19.02.2020 is hereby set aside.

Consequently, this appeal is allowed. The convictions entered, and the sentences

imposed upon the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Appellants are set aside. The said

Appellants are acquitted of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th charges.

Appeal Allowed.
