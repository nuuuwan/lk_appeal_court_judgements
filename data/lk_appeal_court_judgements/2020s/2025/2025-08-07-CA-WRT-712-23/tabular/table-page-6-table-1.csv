"The Petitioner has further alleged that he had been denied a fair hearing at the arbitration. I"
"wish  to  observe  that  the  Petitioner failed  to  specify  the  grounds  for  such  allegation  in  the"
"petition,  and  the 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  further  failed  to  do  so  when  the"
"application  was  taken  up  for  support.  As  set  out  in  the  narration  of  the  factual  judgment"
"herein, I am satisfied that the 2nd Respondent has accorded a fair hearing to the Petitioner,"
"wherein he had been permitted representation, allowed to file pleadings, lead evidence and"
"cross-examine  opposing  witnesses 
and 
tender  documents 
and  written 
submissions."
"Furthermore,  as  submitted  by  the 
learned  State  Counsel  for  the  Respondents,  the  2nd"
"Respondent had adduced cogent reasons for his conclusions in his Award. Hence, I am of the"
"view that the Petitioner’s allegation that he had been denied a fair hearing is devoid of merit"
"and should be rejected."
"A
part from the submissions made on the merits, the learned State Counsel also raised certain"
"legal  objections, 
including  the 
lack  of  uberrima  fides  and  the  availability  of  alternative"
"remedies.  Whilst  I  think  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider  such  legal  objections  in  light  of  my"
"aforementioned findings, I wish to refer to the objection raised by her relating to defectiveness"
"in  the  prayer  to  the  petition.  The  learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  had"
"failed to specify against which respondents the writs of Certiorari and Mandamus have been"
"sought and in respect of which acts or omissions. As such, she submitted that paragraph (b)"
"of  the  prayer,  which  contained  the  substantive  relief  sought  in  the  instant  application  and"
"which merely state “to grant prerogative writs in the nature of certiorari and mandamus as"
"requested on the basis of this application against the Respondents” was defective."
"T
he  necessity  for  the  reliefs  sought  to  be  clear  and  specific  when  the  writ  jurisdiction  is"
"invoked, particularly when a writ of Mandamus is sought, has been considered by this Court"
"in several decisions. The Court has not been inclined to allow reliefs when it is too wide or"
"vague. 
In  Wanninayaka  Mudiyanselage  Dhanapala 
v.  Mr.  Nimal  Kotawalagedara"
"Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs,17 the Court observed as follows (per Dehideniya, J. P/CA"
"(as His Lordship was then));"
