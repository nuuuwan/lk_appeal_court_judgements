"Conclusion and Orders of Court"
"For the reasons set out above, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie"
"case to be considered by this Court. The legal objection relating to the defectiveness of the"
"prayer raised by the Respondents, as determined by me above, too, militates against the grant"
"of  prerogative  relief  to  the  Petitioner.  Therefore,  I  decline  to  issue  formal  notice  and  the"
"application is accordingly dismissed. No costs."
