"","and introduced to the appellant as well as the other person. This was also"
"","the position taken up in his dock statement at the end of the trial."
"A","ccording to the dock statement, the accused does state that two persons"
"","arrived  on  a  motorcycle  and  also  there  was  a  trishaw  and  that  he  was"
"pushed","into  the  trishaw,  and  that  this  happened  at  Pepiliyana.  His"
"","position  is  that  at  this  point,  he  received  a  call  on  his  phone  and  that"
"","person  came  shortly  thereafter  to  Pepiliyana.  A  substance  was  then"
"","recovered from the said person, which was subsequently apportioned, and"
"","a gross sum of 10.520 grammes was introduced to the appellant. The facts"
"","being so, I will now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal."
"Grounds of Appeal No. 01 and No.2",""
"","6.  Grounds of Appeal No. 01 and No.2 will be considered together as they are"
"","inter connected and are overlapping. They are that, the trial judge erred in"
"","law by failing to assess the credibility of the evidence of PW-01 as the said"
"","evidence  is  neither  accepted  nor  rejected;  and  the  dock  statement  was"
"","erroneously rejected on the basis of the evidence of PW-01."
"","7.  The counsel for the appellant argued that the prosecution had led only one"
"","witness  and  that  calling  of  one  witness  is  not  lawful.  That  being  so,  he"
"","developed his argument and submitted that the trial judge had completely"
"","failed to evaluate the credibility of PW-01. In formulating the first ground"
"","of  appeal,  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  did  submit  that  the  failure  to"
"","assess credibility is an error of law. He further argued and submitted that"
"","the judgement as formulated by the learned trial judge is not in conformity"
"","with the provisions of Section 283 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"","Act. His argument is that the trial judge had determined that the defence"
"","of the accused is untenable in light of the evidence led by the prosecution."
"","In  support  of  his  argument,  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  relied  on  the"
"","following dicta in James Silva vs. The Republic 028 SLLR 1980."
