"HCC-0231-2017"
"“It is a grave error of law for a trial Judge to direct himself that he"
"must examine the tenability and truthfulness of the evidence of the"
"defence  in  the  light  of  the  evidence  led  by  the  prosecution.  Our"
"criminal law postulates a fundamental presumption of legal innocence"
"of  every  accused  till  the  contrary  is  proved.  This  is  rooted  in  the"
"concept  of  legal  inviolability  of  every  individual  in  our  society,  now"
"enshrined in our Constitution. There is not even a surface presumption"
"of truth in the charge with which an accused is indicted. Therefore, to"
"examine  the  evidence  of  the  accused  in  the  light  of  the  prosecution"
"witnesses is to reverse the presumption of innocence”."
