"Rejection of the Dock Statement",""
"","10. As stated above, the trial judge has considered the totality of the evidence"
"","including  the  defence  suggestions  and  the  dock  statement  and  then"
"","applying the probability test rejected the defence version. The  trial  judge"
"","has embarked upon this exercise adopting a unique style of his own. This"
"","certainly  is  not  a  rejection  of  the  dock  statement  on  a  mere  comparison"
"","with the prosecution version. The rejection is on the application of the test"
"of  probability  and","improbability  upon  considering  the  totality  of  the"
"","evidence.  The  learned  trial  judge  has  not  separately  considered  if  the"
"","evidence of the accused creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case"
"by  examining  the  defence  by","itself.  The  burden  all  along 
is  on  the"
"","prosecution  to  prove  the  charge  of  possession  by  the  accused  beyond"
"","reasonable doubt. The trial judge has been mindful of this and the rejection"
"","is  on  the  application  of  the  test  of  probability  and  improbability  upon"
"","considering the totality of the evidence. Thus, I see no apparent flaw in the"
"","method adopted by the trial judge and certainly no miscarriage of justice"
"","has occurred. However, I will now endeavour to consider if the rejection of"
"the dock statement is reasonable and correct.",""
