"well  established  that  findings  of  primary  facts  by  a  trial  judge  who  hears"
"and sees witnesses are not lightly disturbed in appeal’. Then in R v. Paul"
"[[1977]1 SCR 181] it was observed that, “There is simply no jurisdiction in"
"an appellate court to upset trial findings of fact that have evidentiary support."
"A court of appeal improperly substitutes its view of the facts of a case when"
"it seeks for whatever reason to replace those made by the trial judge. It is"
"also to be noted that the state is not obliged to disprove every speculative"
"scenario consistent with the innocence of an accused.”"
"Conclusion"
"20. In  the  present  appeal,  the  inferences  drawn  and  conclusion  arrived  are"
"reasonable and is in accordance with the evidence. In the above premises,"
"and for the reasons assigned we find that the arguments advanced for the"
"appellant  are  misconceived  and  not  sustainable.  Accordingly,  we  see  no"
"merit in this appeal."
"A
ccordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the conviction and sentence are"
"hereby affirmed."
