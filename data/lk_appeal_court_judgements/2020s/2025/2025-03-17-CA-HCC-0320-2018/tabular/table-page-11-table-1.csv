"contradiction  or  omission  which  does  not  go  into  the  root  of  a  case"
"cannot be considered a reason to reject the evidence of a witness. This"
"Court is of the view that the discrepancies in the evidence referred to"
"by the appellant are so trivial that they do not create a doubt as regards"
"to the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution. When, such evidence"
"is taken into consideration in its totality, it is clear that PW1 had made"
"a part payment to the appellant in the belief that he could purchase the"
"particular  car  which  the  appellant  had  offered  to  sell  to  him  at  a"
"discounted price."
