"PW1 at a discounted price if the consideration was paid in cash.  The"
"Learned Deputy Solicitor General has also contended that the alleged"
"discrepancies do not go into the core of the issue and are matters that"
"do not affect the credibility of the prosecution case. He was also of the"
"view that the Learned High Court Judge had imposed a lenient sentence"
"on the appellant upon conviction. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General"
"has moved that the appeal be dismissed for want of merit."
