"It is contended that contrary to the learned President’s Counsel’s argument that pursuant"
"to section 32(1) the Commission gives appointment letters to all its officers and they"
"become officers of the Commission."
"T
his  Court  observes  that  Chapter  IV  deals  with  the  powers  and  functions  of  the"
"Commission 
to  appoint,  promote, 
take  disciplinary  control  and  pertaining 
to 
the"
"dismissal  of  employees  of  the  Commission.  Hence,  it  is  clear  that  the  Commission"
"pursuant  to  section  32  is  empowered  to  take  disciplinary  action  against  any  officer."
"Thus, if the Petitioners are alleging misdeeds or acts of  ultra vires in conducting the"
"investigation  by 
the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents, 
they  should  complain 
to 
the  3rd"
"Respondent. In this case, the Court is not privy to any document by which the Petitioners"
"have complained to the 3rd Respondent against the alleged unlawful acts of the 1st and"
"2nd Respondents before filing the Writ Application. It is pertinent to note the Petitioners’"
"whole  contention  is  that  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  are  acting  ultra  vires  of  their"
"powers,  hence, 
there 
is  no 
requirement 
to  make  any  allegation  against 
the  3rd"
"Respondent.  If  that  is  so  the  Petitioners  should  have  first  complained  to  the  3rd"
"Respondent against the alleged acts of the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Further as per the"
"Petitioners’ contention if the 1st and 2nd Respondents are acting without the authority of"
"the 3rd Respondent then the Petitioners have failed to give an explanation and plead as"
"to why they have failed to complain to the 3rd Respondent against the acts of the 1st and"
"2nd Respondents."
"I
t  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  as  per  paragraph  2(c)  of  the  Petition,  the  Petitioners"
"concedes that the 1st and 2nd Respondents are officers attached to the Commission and"
"goes on to say that “the Commission is a body corporate that may sue and be sued in"
"such  name”.  Nevertheless,  the  Petitioners  further  state  that  they  are  not  seeking  any"
"reliefs against the 3rd Respondent. However, the Petitioners have failed to explain the"
"reason as to why the 3rd Respondent was made a party to this action, if the allegation is"
"only pertaining to the 1st and 2nd Respondents, and especially if the said Respondents"
"are acting independent of the Commission."
"I
n the limited objections filed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents, the Director General"
"of  the  Commission  affirms  that  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  are  conducting  the  said"
"investigations pursuant to the approval of the Commission. It is not disputed that the 3rd"
"Respondent is, pursuant to Article 156A (1) of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution"
"read with section 4 of the Anti-Corruption Act, is the sole body to investigate bribery"
"and  corruption  and  is  empowered  to  authorize  arrests  and  prosecutions  and  the  said"
"power is carried out by the officers of the Commission. As per the scheme of the Act,"
"it is through the officers and the employees of the Commission that the Commission"
"efficiently discharges its functions."
