"“wage  or  salary”  should  be  construed  to  not 
include  the  “Academic"
"Allowance”."
"Cost of living allowance or special living allowance is to be considered as"
"the  amount  of  money  that  an  employee  gets  in  addition  to  his  or  her"
"normal  pay  to  cover  the  additional 
living  costs 
incurred.  Ex  facia,  an"
"academic  allowance  is  an  allowance  paid  to  cover  the  cost  incurred  for"
"academic purposes during the occupation of the employee. It is my view"
"that,  contrary  to  the  living  allowance,  an  academic  allowance  paid  to"
"university 
academic 
staff 
does 
not 
contribute 
to 
subsistence 
or"
"sustenance  to  their  livelihood  in  any  manner.  The  rule  of  interpretation,"
"ejusdem generis rule, provides that where specific words are followed by"
"general words, the general words should be interpreted in the context of"
"the specific  words that precede them. As such, I hold that an  Academic"
"Allowance  cannot  be  construed  as  a  “cost  of  living  allowance,  special"
"living allowance or other similar allowance” in calculating the gratuity in"
"terms  of  the  Act  and  that  there  is  no  obligatory  requirement  in  law  to"
"count an academic allowance in calculating gratuity in terms of the Act."
"It 
is  also  observed 
that  the  UGC  has 
issued  a  Circular  marked  P6,"
"establishing 
a 
requirement 
to 
count 
the  Academic  Allowance 
in"
"calculating gratuity in terms of the Act with effect from 01.06.2019. The"
"said Circular does not specify that the same shall apply with retrospective"
"effect. In the case of R.A. Dharmadasa vs. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka"
"(SC  Appeal  No:  13/2019,  S.C.  Minutes  dated  16.06.2022),  the  Supreme"
"Court held that:"
"“If  it  was  the  intention  of  the  Director  General  of  the  Respondent"
"that the said condition should apply with retrospective effect, then,"
"there  should  have  been  a  specific  reference  to  that  effect,  which  is"
"not the case.”"
"In  the 
instant  application,  the  Circular  P6  does  not  specify  that  the"
"provisions shall apply retrospectively. Nor do the words contained therein"
"enable 
this  Court 
to  come 
to 
the  conclusion 
that 
the  Commission"
"intended the said Circular P6 to apply with retrospective effect. Thus, this"
"Court 
is  of  the  view  that  the  said  Circular  P6  has  no  retrospective"
