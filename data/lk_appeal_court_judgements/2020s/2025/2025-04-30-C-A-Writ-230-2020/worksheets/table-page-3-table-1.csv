"Economics  at  the  University  of  Ruhuna  and  had  gone  on  retirement  on"

of 
the 
Petitioner, 
the"
"employees’ basic salary, cost of living and academic allowance had been"
"taken 
into  consideration.  However, 
it 
is  stated  that 
in  calculating  the"
"Petitioner’s gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act (hereafter referred"
"to as  the Act),  the ‘Academic  Allowance’ of the Petitioner  had not been"
"included at the time of his retirement."

"University Grant Commission(UGC), Academic Allowance should be taken"
"into  consideration  in  calculating  the  gratuity  in  terms  of  the  Act  for  the"

in 
the"
"provisions  in  Sections  6(2)(a)  and  20  of  the  Act,  and  the  same  benefit"
"should be offered to the Petitioner. The Petitioner claims that the 1st to 3rd"
"Respondents’ 
failure  to  act  accordingly  and  pay  the  gratuity  to  the"
"Petitioner is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious."
"The  law  relating  to  payment  of  gratuity  is  governed  by  the  Payment  of"
"Gratuity Act. Section 6 of the Act lays down the formula for the purpose"
"of calculating the gratuity based on the rate of wage or salary last drawn"
