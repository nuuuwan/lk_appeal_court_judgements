"prospective  effect.  Although  the  Petitioner  stated  that  the  same  benefit"
"should be offered to the Petitioner who retired on 08.01.2018 before said"
"Circular  P6  came  into  effect,  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  challenge  the"
"validity or correctness of the said Circular P6 based on the date of effect"
"of  the  said  Circular  P6  nor  has  the  Petitioner  in  his  Petition  sought  any"
"reliefs accordingly. Hence, I see no need to consider such an aspect under"
"the instant application."
"In  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  am  not  inclined  to  grant  any  of  the  reliefs"
"prayed for in the Petition of the Petitioner, and I proceed to dismiss the"
"application without cost."
"Application is dismissed."
