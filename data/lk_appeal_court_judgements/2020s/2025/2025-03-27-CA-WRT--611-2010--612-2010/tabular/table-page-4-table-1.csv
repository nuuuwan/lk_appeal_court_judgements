"Lanka(Pvt) Ltd and another V Jayathilaka and others (2009) 1 SLR 276). However, at the"
"end of the judgment of the Supreme Court, the Court refers as;"
"“This  order will not  prejudice the authority of  an officer of  customs  or recover any"
"sums that are due according to law.”"
"On the said basis, the Respondent purporting to act in terms of section 18(2) of the Customs"
"Ordinance, sent a letter of demand dated 1st of September 2010, demanding the Petitioner the"
"payment of Rs.67,380,782/= as ‘Customs duty and other levies’ based on ‘misclassification’."
"The  Respondent  contends  that  the  Toyota  Prados  that  were  classified  under  the  HS  Code"
"‘8702.10.01’ should be classified under HS  Code ‘8703.32.07’ and  alleges that there was a"
"short payment of Rs.67,380,782/= as ‘Customs duty and other levies’."
"The section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance refers as follows,"
"“(2) When any duties, dues or charges on any goods, imported or exported, have been"
"short levied or where any such duties, dues or charges after having been levied, have"
"been erroneously refunded, the persons chargeable with the duties, dues or charges"
"so  short  levied  or  to  whom  such  refund  has  erroneously  been  made  shall  pay  the"
"deficiency or repay the amount so erroneously refunded, if the payment of the amount"
"short  levied  or  erroneously  refunded  shall  be  demanded  within  twenty-  four  months"
"from the date of such short levy or refund.”"
"The above reproduced section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance requires the payment of short"
"levy shall be demanded within twenty-four months from the date of the levy. However, the"
"Petitioner has received the letter of demand for the short levy after the expiration of twenty-"
"four  months.  Factually,  the  relevant  vehicles  were  initially  levied  in  2003  to  2005  and  the"
"subsequent demand on short levies was made in 2010. Therefore, the Petitioner has sought a"
"writ application No.612/2010 seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the letter of demand dated"
"1st of September 2010, as it is contrary to section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance. However,"
"the  Respondent  has  objected  to  the  application  on  the  ground  that  the  period  of  24  months"
"referred to in section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance should commence from the date of the"
"judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  S.C.  Appeal  49/2008  delivered  on  20th  of  March  2009."
