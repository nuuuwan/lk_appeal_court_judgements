"months begins from the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court."
"In the case of SC Appeal No.179/2010, Gamini Amaratuga J. has held,"
"“In dealing with this appeal I wish to make the following observations. The words in"
"section  18(2)  are  plain,  clear  and  unambiguous.  The  point  of  time  from  which  the"
"period of 24 months has to be reckoned is clearly laid down by the words ""from the"
"date of such short levy or refund in section 18(2). The Court of Appeal has held that"
"the 24-month period begins to run from the due of the judgment of the Supreme Court"
"i.e.20.03.2009.  What  the  Supreme  Court  has  said  was  that  ""This  order  will  not"
"prejudice  the  authority  of  an  officer  of  customs  to  recover  any  sums  that  are  due"
"according to law"". This sentence cannot be construed to mean that the period of 24"
"months begins to run from the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court.”"
