"a  commercial  value  and  the  timber  is  used  for  the  production  of  timber  products  and"
"furniture. To understand the issue before us this Court would now consider the submission"
"of the Counsel pertaining to the nature of the Appellant’s business. As per the submission"
"of  the  Appellant  to  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission,  which  is  at  page  12  of  the  brief  in"
"paragraph one, it is submitted that the Appellant “is engaged in cultivation, manufacture"
"and sale of tea and rubber. It is also engaged, interalia, in renting out its factory and sale"
"of  trees”  (emphasis  added).  Thus,  the  argument  that  the  said  cultivation  and  sale  is  for"
"commercial purpose. This also demonstrates that the Appellant is cultivating trees. It is in"
"this background that the Respondent contend the albezia cultivation and the selling of trees"
"is to earn an income. It is in these circumstances that the Court is invited to give an opinion"
"as to whether the sale of albezia trees falls within the exemption as sale of live trees, or as"
"the Respondent contends, the sale is for trees logged and processed as logs which do not"
"fall within the exemption, or in the alternate whether the supply of trees falls within the"
"exemption under sawn timber."
"It is the contention of the Appellant that the sale of albezia trees is within the meaning of"
"unprocessed agricultural products and that the agreement is for the supply of live trees. It"
"was further submitted that the tender called for is to uproot the live trees. If it is a supply"
"of  live  trees  the  Appellant  claims  the  supply  falls  within  the  provisions  of  unprocessed"
"agricultural produce and is exempted from tax."
"In answering this question let us first consider the relevant provisions of the Act."
