his argument of the Appellant cuts across their first argument that the sale was of live"

"“wood that has been produced either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping"

he Appellant in his submissions argued that alternatively the timber logs sold were sawn"
"wood  and  falls  within  the  exemption  above.  However,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  if  the"
"Appellant is pleading under the exemptions for sawn wood, then the said wood does not"
"consist  of  living  trees.  Thus,  to  fall  into  the  definition  of  sawn  wood,  the  wood  has  to"
"undergo a stage of processing. It appears by this argument that the Appellant is attempting"
"to blow hot and cold. If the Appellant is pleading that they fall under the latter exemption"
"then they cannot maintain the position taken that the sale was of unprocessed agricultural"
"produce. In the view of this Court, the moment the Appellant pleads under this exemption,"
"it is admitted that the supply was not unprocessed wood. This Court observes that if we are"
"to accept the alternate argument of the Appellant then the first submission that the sale was"
"for  unprocessed  agricultural  produce  fails.  In  paragraph  57  of  the  Appellant’s  written"
"submissions defines sawn wood as follows:"
"“The term ‘sawn wood’ refers to sawing the cutting of wood from trees into different"
"shapes and sizes. Sawn timber on the other hand is timber that is cut from logs into"
"different shapes and sizes. Sawn timber is generally cut into varying rectangular"
"widths and lengths but may also be wedge-shaped. It could also cover round wood"
"timber. Common sawn wood products include timber beams and more rectangular"
"timber.”"
"Item (a)(xxii)(iv) of Part II of the First Schedule to the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of"
"2002 exempts wood (sawn)."
