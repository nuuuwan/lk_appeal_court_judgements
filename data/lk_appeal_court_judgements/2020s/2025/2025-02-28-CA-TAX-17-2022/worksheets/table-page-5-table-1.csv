"As stated above, it is contended that the said wood has to be processed to be used as timber"
"for the production of wooden products including furniture, and the said activity is done by"
"the  buyer.  The  Appellant  concedes  that  the  said  products  are  liable  for  VAT  unless"
"specifically  exempted.  The  Appellantâ€™s  argument  is  based  on  the  premise  that  the  said"
"wood is supplied by the Appellant in living form. Thus, qualifying for the exemption."
