"corresponding paragraphs  of  the Affidavit tendered by  the Petitioner, the Respondents"
"state that the Petitioner has been sleeping on her rights and not taken any steps to make"
"representations to the 2nd Respondent in order to facilitate her request in P15."
"The Respondents has not specifically denied or answered the averments in paragraph 30 of the"
"petition. The Respondents appear to be relying on the general denial clause, denying all those"
"averments or paragraphs that are not specifically and expressly denied or admitted. As such it is"
"reasonable to assume that paragraph 30 has been denied in its entirety without any reason being"
"given."
"In spite of the direct challenge to the authority under which the  registration was done and the"
"impugned  certificate  issued,  the  1st,  2nd,  and  4th  Respondents  have  not  mentioned  by  what"
"authority  the impugned certificate  was issued,  or any statutory foundation for the  registration"
"process."
"This  only  statute  that  has  been  mention  in  this  application  (by  the  Petitioner)  is  the  Buddhist"
"Temporalities Act. However, there is no provision in this act that justifies issuing of registration"
"certificates in order to register any land as a Buddhist Temple or a “Viharaya”. I have been unable"
"to find any legislation that permits such a registration. The only conclusion that can be drawn from"
"Respondents  deliberate  silence  regarding  a  jurisdictional  challenge,  is  that  they  are  unable  to"
"submit where the power is drawn from for this particular registration.  It appears that no statutory"
"power  is  vested  in  the  1st  Respondent  to  register  the  Petitioner’s  property  as  a  Temple  or  a"
"“Viharaya”. As such, the registration and the issuance of the certificate of registration regarding"
"‘Neelakarama Mahasen Bhawana Madhyasthanaya’ bearing No. බ ෞ.බ ො./විහො.බේ/19/27/25"
"dated 29.01.2013 issued by the 1st Respondent is ultra vires and void from its inception. 3"
"Accordingly, this Court issues a writ of certiorari, formally quashing the impugned registration and"
"registration certificate of the 1st Respondent for lack of jurisdiction."
