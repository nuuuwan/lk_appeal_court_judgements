"Does the punishment of the Petitioner amount to double jeopardy?"
"T
hough  the  Petitioner  had  not  pleaded  this  ground  in  her  Application,  the  learned"
"Counsel  raised  the  said  ground  in  his  oral  submissions.  For  completeness  this  Court"
"would  consider  the  said  ground.  The  Petitioner’s  contention  is  that  she  was  charged"
"with,  found  guilty  and  subsequently  punished  at  a  summary  trial.  As  per  R1,  the"
"Petitioner upon being found guilty at the inquiry had been subject to 14 days detention"
"and forfeiture of the salary during the said period. Thereafter, the Petitioner had been"
"discharged  from  the  Sri  Lanka  Air  Force  under  “Service  No  Longer  Required”.  The"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  contends  that  the  said  discharge  amounts  to  the"
"Petitioner being punished twice for the same offence and hence, the argument of double"
"jeopardy. The learned SSC vehemently rejected the said contention and argued that the"
"offence committed by the Petitioner is considered a serious breach of discipline. It was"
"further contended that Air Force being at the forefront of protecting the nation has to"
"maintain  strict  discipline  among  its  officers.  This  Court  agrees  with  said  submission"
"that the Tri-Forces of the country should have strict discipline and the failure to maintain"
"the  same  will  result  in  the  erosion  of  public  confidence  and  respect.  Our  Courts  on"
"several  occasions  have  stressed  on  the  importance  of  maintaining  strict  discipline"
"among the forces. In the case of H.D.S. Pushpakumara v. Gagana Bulathsinghala CA"
"Writ 464/2015 decided on 02.09.2019  this Court held that:"
"“It is the contention of the learned ASG that the Commander has been given such"
"authority in order to maintain discipline in the Air Force. I am in full agreement"
"that, unlike in any other institution, if there is no discipline in the members of the"
"Armed Forces including the Police Force, those institutions cannot possibly run."
"In short, if there is no discipline, there is no Army, Navy or Air Force. This is"
"equally true to the Police Force.”"
