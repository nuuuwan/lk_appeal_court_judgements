"took place while the Petitioner and the other officer was engaged in an official training"
"program.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  did  not  deny  these  allegations.  The"
"learned Counsel for the Petitioner also contended that the Petitioner could not have been"
"charged under section 43 whereby there was a summary trial in which the Petitioner"
"participated and was penalized. Section 43 deals with summary trial and section 129(1)"
"deals with the offences. It is also observed by this Court that subsequent to the inquiry"
"that  was  held  in  2021,  the  Petitioner  had  been  punished  with  forfeiture  of  pay  and"
"allowances  for  the  duration  of  the  detention  of  14  days.  The  Petitioner  had  signed"
"accepting the said verdict. Though the Petitioner contended that holding a summery trial"
"in this instance was bad in law, the said argument was not pursued at the argument stage"
"and  the  Petitioner  failed  to  establish  her  contention  as  to  why  the  holding  of  the"
"summary trial was bad in law."
