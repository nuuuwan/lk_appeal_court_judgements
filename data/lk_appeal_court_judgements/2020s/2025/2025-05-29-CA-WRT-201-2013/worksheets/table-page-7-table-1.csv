"contention of the Petitioner that the said Notice of assessment for the taxable period of December"
"2003 is ultra vires as it is time-barred in terms of section 33 of the VAT Act, further it also includes"
"several other taxable periods within the aforesaid taxable period of December 2003. Accordingly,"
"the Petitioner has appealed the aforesaid notice of Assessment on 27th of March 2006, which was"
"acknowledged by the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner states that the evidence was adduced and the"
"appeal was heard by the 4th Respondent. The determination of the said appeal was received by the"
"Petitioner on the 10th of April 2008."
"Being dissatisfied with the said order, the Petitioner preferred an appeal dated 21st of May 2008 to"
"the Board of Review against the determination by the 4th Respondent. The appeal was heard by"
"the board of review, and both parties have submitted their written submissions. However, the board"
"of  review  ceased  to  function,  therefore,  the  aforesaid  appeal  was  heard  by  the  tax  appeals"
"commission, and the determination was delivered on 28th of February 2013."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  determinations,  the  Petitioner  has  now  made  a  writ  application  to"
"quash the determinations made by the Respondents."
"The  Respondents  state  that  the  determination  dated  28th  of  February  2013  of  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission is based on the following issues."
