JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) has

been indicted in the High Court of Kuliyapitiya in High Court case

number HC Kuliyapitiya 177/2010.

The charges in the indictment are as follows.

Charge 01

That on or about March 23, 2008, at Kosdeniya, Kandemadagama,

within the jurisdiction of this Court, the appellant committed

murder by causing the death of one Jayasundara Mudiyanselage

Podimanike and thereby committed an offence punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code.

Charge 02

That in the same course of transaction as above, the appellant

committed murder by causing the death of one Nawarathna

Page 3 of 16

Henayalage Imesh Madushan and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

Charge 03

That in the same course of transaction as the first two charges, the

appellant caused injuries to one Bamunu Mudiyanselage Mallika

by attacking her with stones, clasping her neck and pushing her

down from a rock, with such intention that had he by such acts

caused the death of the said Bamunu Mudiyanselage Mallika, he

would have been guilty of murder, and that he by such an act

caused hurt to the said Bamunu Mudiyanselage Mallika; and that

he has thereby committed an offence punishable under section

300 of the Penal Code.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, learned High Court Judge has convicted

the appellant of the second and third charges. The appellant has been

sentenced to death in respect of the second charge and sentenced to 15

years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10000.00 with a term of 2

years rigorous imprisonment in default in respect of the third charge.

3. Further, the appellant has also been directed to pay a sum of Rs.

100000.00 as compensation to PW01 with a term of 4 years rigorous

imprisonment in default. It has also been directed that in case the

appellant default in the payment of the fine and the compensation, the

terms of imprisonment in default shall run consecutively.

Case of the prosecution

4. The deceased named in the first charge was the mother in law of the

appellant. The second charge involves the appellant’s child, while the

injured party mentioned in the third charge is the wife of the appellant.

Page 4 of 16

5. On March 23, 2008, the deceased and the injured party have visited the

Hettipola Police Station to address and inquiry stemming from a

complaint that the appellant had failed to provide for his wife and child.

At the police station, all parties have reached an agreement regarding the

matter.

6. Following this settlement, the appellant has suggested they visit a temple

familiar to him to participate in a religious ritual, in hope that the

settlement reached would endure indefinitely.

7. The appellant has then taken the deceased and the injured party to the

temple. From there, he has led them to a secluded area located further

away from the temple. Such secluded area has been situated on a

precipice, nestled high above a valley.

8. When the appellant and the others reached such area, consequent to a

verbal altercation, the appellant has allegedly pushed his mother in law

i.e. the deceased named in the first charge and his wife down the

precipice. Thereafter, the appellant has also stoned the women he

pushed down the precipice.

9. PW01, the injured person named in the third charge has lost

consciousness due to the assault. Upon regaining consciousness the

next morning, she has climbed up the precipice, gone to the temple and

informed the priest of the incident. Thereafter, the police has been

notified and an inspection of the scene done by the officers attached to

the Katupotha Police Station.

10. During the initial inspection, the officers have discovered the body of the

deceased named in the first charge. The officers have also proceeded to

Page 5 of 16

record a statement from the injured person i.e. the wife of the appellant

who was hospitalized at that time for treatment. Due to the information

provided, the appellant has been arrested on the same afternoon i.e.

March 24, 2008, at 13.20 hours at the Nikaweratiya bus station and a

statement of his recorded immediately.

11. The information provided by the appellant has led to the discovery of the

body of the deceased child, who is named in the second charge. The body

has been found at the location the officers had visited earlier that

morning. The part of the statement that specifically pertains to the

recovery of the child’s body has been presented as evidence and

designated as පැ05.

12. PW10, Dr. D. K. Wijewardhana, Consultant Judicial Medical Officer, has

conducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased child. PW10,

upon conclusion of such examination has concluded that the death of

the child has occurred due to pressure on the neck due to manual

strangulation and other fatal injuries caused to the face of the child. The

relevant post-mortem report has been presented as evidence and

designated as පැ06.

13. Dr. D.K Wijewardhana, Consultant Judicial Medical Officer has also

examined the injured person named in the third charge on three

occasions.

14. PW10 has examined the injured person named in the third charge on

March 24, 25, 2008, and May 6, 2008. The doctor has observed a total of

nineteen injuries on the body of the patient including fractures,

lacerations and contusions. The majority of those injuries have been

caused to the patient’s face. The doctor has opined that the injuries

Page 6 of 16

numbers 02 to 12 (mainly on the face) would have endangered the life of

the patient due to infection. The relevant medico-legal report has been

presented as evidence and designated as පැ08.

Case of the appellant

15. The appellant has maintained that he together with the deceased named

in the first two charges and the injured person named in the third charge

went to a temple to participate in a religious ritual in hope that the

settlement reached earlier which his wife, i.e. the injured person named

in the third charge would endure indefinitely.

16. Thereafter, an argument erupted between him and his wife. Observing

the tension, the mother in law, i.e. the deceased named in the first

charge has stepped closer to the couple hoping to mediate and restore

peace. At that moment, the three of them have grappled and fallen down

the precipice. Thereafter, it is alleged that the wife of the appellant pelted

stones at the appellant

Grounds of appeal

17. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Counsel for the

appellant urged the following grounds of appeal:

i. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

credibility of PW01.

ii. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

section 27 recovery in the correct perspective (body of the child).

Page 7 of 16

iii. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the defence’s

case.

iv. Was the appellant denied a fair trial due to the excessive questioning

by the Judge and irregular correction of the proceedings?

v. Whether the elements of attempted murder has been proved by the

prosecution.

18. The counsel for the appellant has complained that the evidence of PW01

is not consistent and therefore not reliable. To buttress his claims, he

had drawn the attention of the Court to contradictions and omissions

that were highlighted in the original Court.

19. Furthermore, the Court’s attention has also been drawn to the witness’s

narrative regarding her explanation of the number of stones pelted at

her, the manner in which she described her fall down the precipice, the

place where she landed at the end of her fall, and so on.

20. The contradictions and the omissions highlighted in the trial Court refer

to the argument that allegedly occurred before the appellant pushed

PW01 down the precipice, the place the child was at the particular

moment of time, whether PW01 looked for her mother and as mentioned

elsewhere, the manner in which PW01 has described her fall down the

precipice and where she landed at the end of the fall.

21. PW01 has been hospitalized when her statements were recorded. The

first statement has been recorded only a few hours after her admission, a

time during which she would have been experiencing significant pain and

emotional distress. Given these circumstances, her ability to recall the

Page 8 of 16

incident accurately and provide a coherent statement was likely

compromised.

22. At the time of recording the statement, PW01 would have been not only

physically uncomfortable due to her medical condition but also would

have been grappling with psychological trauma associated with her

experience. Such factors can greatly affect an individual’s mental

processes involved in comprehension and influence her capacity to reflect

on the past events clearly and comprehensively.

23. By taking into account these elements – pain, trauma and the timing of

the statements, it becomes evident that PW01’s recollection and narrative

may not fully represent her experience. Therefore, it is important to

interpret her statements within the context of her emotional and physical

condition at that time.

24. Further, PW01 has testified in Court eight months after the incident

involving her. Such significant lapse of time can greatly impair an

individual’s memory. It is natural for PW01 to forget certain details of the

event, specifically considering the trauma she experienced. Her

subconscious effort to cope with and possibly forget the traumatic nature

of the incident could further hinder her ability to recall events

comprehensively.

25. As a result, this may lead to gaps in her testimony and discrepancies in

the sequence of events. Memory is often fragile, particularly when it is

intertwined with emotional distress. The longer the time span between

the incident and the testimony, the more likely it is that critical details

may be lost or altered.

Page 9 of 16

26. Additionally, the psychological effects of trauma can manifest in various

ways, including dissociation and selective memory repression. These

factors are essential to consider when evaluating the completeness and

accuracy of PW01’s testimony.

27. The contradictions and omissions that were highlighted in the original

Court proceedings regarding the testimony of PW01 do not undermine

the fundamental aspects of the witness’s narrative. These discrepancies

while noteworthy, do not materially affect the core narrative of PW01. It

is important to note that all inconsistencies in a witness’s account are

significant, they may arise from complexities of human memory or the

natural evolution of a person’s recollection over time.

28. The witness’s overall credibility, the consistency of key details and the

corroborative evidence from other sources should be weighed more

heavily than the minor contradictions referred to. Those contradictions

and omissions do not reduce the reliability of PW01’s overall testimony or

its relevance to the case in hand.

29. The essence of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895 is

that certain information or confessions can be admitted as evidence if

they meet specific criteria.

i. The person providing the information must be in police

custody.

ii. The person must be formally accused of an offence related to

the information given.

iii. The information must lead to the discovery of evidence that

connects to the crime in question.

Page 10 of 16

30. The appellant complains that he was neither formally charged with a

crime nor recognized as a suspect at the time in issue and that he did

not give any information that led to the discovery of the dead body of the

child named in the second charge, indicating that the provisions in

section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895 did not apply.

31. Through the testimony of PW05, Mr. A.L Abeygoonawardhane, Inspector

of Police, it has been established that the appellant was taken into

custody on March 24, 2008, at the Nikaweratiya bus station at 13.20

hours, following information regarding his whereabouts. The appellant

has been detained as a suspect in relation to the incidents outlined in

the charges against him. Subsequently, a statement from the appellant

has been recorded at the location of his arrest. After the statement was

taken, that same evening, the appellant has been escorted to the scene of

the incident, where the information he provided has led to the discovery

of the deceased child’s body.

32. Considering the narrative provided by PW05 along with the matters

discussed above, the assertion that the provision of section 27 of the

Evidence Ordinance do not apply to the appellant, must be rejected.

33. The appellant in attempting to persuade the Court that the body of the

deceased child was not discovered due to the information he provided,

has in this context, directed the Court’s attention to specific portions of

the evidence given by PW02 and PW03. Upon reviewing these portions of

evidence, it becomes evident that the witnesses were referring to the

initial instance when the investigators (police officers) inspected the

scene, rather than to any subsequent occasions when the investigators

(police officers) returned to such scene.

Page 11 of 16

34. However, on page 177 of the brief, PW11, Ven. Kithulwala Wimalasiri

Thero has testified that the child’s dead body was recovered by the

investigators following the appellant’s arrest by the police and

subsequent transport to the scene of the incident.

35. Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895 grants judges the

authority to inquire broadly in order to uncover relevant facts and ensure

the proper administration of justice. Specifically, this provision empowers

judges to pose any question they deem necessary to witnesses or other

parties involved in the case. This level of inquiry is essential for

uncovering the truth and enable the court to make well informed

decisions.

36. However, the exercise of this power is not without limitations. Questions

posed by the Judge must adhere to certain standards to maintain the

integrity of the judicial process. Firstly, it is imperative that the questions

do not prejudice either party involved in the proceedings. The Judge

must be cautious to avoid questions that may unfairly advantage one

party over another, as it would compromise the impartiality of the Court.

37. Moreover, the questions must be framed in a manner it is unbiased and

fair. It is critical that the questioning remains objective and respectful to

ensure that all the participants feel safe and valued in expressing their

testimonies. Judges must be aware of their role as neutral arbiters and

should strive to maintain this stance throughout the questioning

process.

Page 12 of 16

38. In The Queen v Nimalasena de Zoysa [1958] 60 NLR 97, Basnayake C.J.

stated that:

“The section quoted above gives the Judge a wide power. In order to

discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts he may ask any

question he pleases in any form, at any time, about any fact

whether relevant or irrelevant. This power extensive though it be has

limits, but those limits cannot be precisely defined. The trial Judge

himself is the best arbiter of how and when he may exercise it. In its

exercise a Judge should be careful not to usurp the functions o f the

prosecution or the defence. He should also so regulate his

interpositions as not to hamper the conduct o f the case by counsel

for the prosecution or the defence. The fact that neither the parties

nor their agents are entitled to make any objection to any question

by the Judge or to cross-examine any witness upon any answer

given in reply to his questions is a matter which calls for caution in

the exercise of this power.”

39. The learned High Court Judge has questioned the majority of the

witnesses to gain a clearer understanding of the facts surrounding the

case. His approach has been both impartial and thorough, ensuring that

any ambiguities are addressed and resolved.

40. The complaint that the learned High Court Judge has posed leading

questions to specific witnesses and altered the trajectory of their

testimony must therefore be dismissed.

41. Corrections to legal proceedings must be conducted with all parties to

the case present. This ensures transparency and fairness throughout the

process. Each party shall have the opportunity to voice any objections

Page 13 of 16

regarding the proposed corrections to the proceedings. If one party raises

an objection, the judge is required to intervene and assess the situation.

42. In such circumstances, the Judge will issue an appropriate order, taking

into account the arguments presented by the parties. The Judge’s role is

crucial in resolving disputes between parties and ensuring that

corrections are made in a manner that respects the rights and interests

of everyone involved. By allowing parties to participate actively in the

correction process and by having the judge preside over any disputes,

the likelihood of misunderstandings or unjust modifications is

significantly reduced.

43. The contents of pages 83 and 165 of the brief indicate that corrections

have been made to the legal proceedings recorded in those pages.

However, when the Court’s attention is drawn to the journal entry dated

August 8, 2016, it does not reflect that these corrections have occurred

in the presence of the parties involved in the case. Hence, the appellant

has argued that this oversight has denied him a fair trial.

44. Upon examining the corrections made to the legal proceedings, which

were apparently initiated by the learned High Court Judge himself, it is

evident that these changes are quite minor. Importantly, the corrections

have not altered the trajectory of the evidence presented. The contents

remain fundamentally unchanged and have not been modified in any

unjust manner.

45. Given these circumstances, the irregularity identified has not resulted in

a failure of justice.

Page 14 of 16

46. Section 436 of the Criminal Procedure Code reads as follows,

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account –

a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this Code; or

b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

47. In the case of Batuwanthudawa v Karunaratne [1922] 4 CLR 64, Bertram

C.J. held that:

“Under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code a conviction

should not be set aside in appeal on a purely technical objection.

The point of law may be decided in appellant’s favour but the appeal

dismissed unless there has been a failure of justice; that is to say if

the point had been considered in the original Court the judge or jury

would have come to a different conclusion.”

48. In pages 43 and 44 of the disputed judgment, the learned High Court

Judge has articulated several key points regarding the evaluation of the

evidence presented by the appellant.

Page 15 of 16

49. It is evident from the analysis provided that the learned High Court

Judge has undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the appellant’s

testimony.

50. Firstly, he has meticulously considered the appellant’s demeanor during

his testimony. This attention to demeanor reflects the learned High Court

Judge’s understanding of the vital aspects of witness evaluation which

can significantly influence the interpretation of the spoken word.

Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has applied the test of

probability to the appellant’s testimony, assessing its plausibility in the

context of the overall case. Importantly, the learned High Court Judge

has also approached the testimony holistically rather than in isolation.

This comprehensive perspective has allowed for a thorough consideration

of how the appellant’s testimony interacted with that of the prosecution.

Instead of compartmentalizing the testimonies, the learned High Court

Judge has proceeded to analyze them within the broader narrative

presented during the trial.

51. The learned High Court Judge has also provided cogent reasons for his

decision not to accept the appellant’s testimony. These reasons are

methodically detailed and grounded in the evidence presented illustrating

a well-reasoned decision making process. He has also ensured that the

judgment is based on established legal principles and factual analysis.

52. Although the learned Counsel for the appellant has urged the fifth

ground of appeal, as stated above, he has not pursued it, when the

instant appeal was argued.

Page 16 of 16

53. Due to the circumstances referred to above, I am not inclined to interfere

with the conviction, disputed judgment together with the sentencing

order.

54. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal and make no order regarding costs.

Appeal dismissed.

55. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court in Kuliyapitiya for compliance.
