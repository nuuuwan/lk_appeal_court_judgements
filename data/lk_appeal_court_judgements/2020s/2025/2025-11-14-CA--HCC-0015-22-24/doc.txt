Judgment

1. The 1st and 8th Accused – Appellant (hereinafter the refer to as the Appellant) were

indicted before the High Court of Kaluthara on 3 counts. Namely,

a. On or about 24th March 2003, within the jurisdiction of this Court and in

Southern Kalutara, the persons above-named being the members of an

unlawful assembly acting in furtherance of a common intention to commit

the death of one Mohamed Farisz committed an offence punishable under

section 140 of the Penal Code.

b. In the same course of conduct and as part of the same transaction, the persons

above-named, being a member/members of the aforesaid unlawful assembly,

caused the death of Mohamed Farisz and such offence was committed in

furtherance of the common intention shared by the aforesaid unlawful

assembly or in the alternative, the said members of the said unlawful assembly

were at least aware that such offence was likely to be committed in pursuance

of the said common intention; the persons above named, being the members

of an unlawful assembly, have thereby committed murder punishable under

section 146 read with section 296 of the Penal Code.

c. In the same course of conduct and as part of the same transaction, the persons

above named by causing the death of Mohamed Farisz, committed murder

punishable under section 32 read with section 296 of the Penal Code.

2. The trial was conducted by the learned High Court Judge of Kalutara without a jury.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found all the appellants

guilty of the charges leveled against them and sentenced them to death.

HCC/0015/0022/2024

4 | P a g e

3. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 8th

accused preferred an appeal. Similarly, the 4th and 6th accused also appealed against

the conviction and sentence. Both appeals were taken up together for argument.

4. The grounds of appeal advanced by both sets of Appellants are as follows:

1) PW 1’s evidence lacks credibility.

2) The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself of the evidence of the

defense.

5. On behalf of the prosecution, ten witnesses testified. Thereafter, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd

appellants gave evidence. The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th appellants made dock

statements.

6. It could be observed that during the argument, the appellants primarily challenged the

credibility of the testimony of PW1, who is the mother of the deceased. Accordingly,

I will first consider whether the evidence of PW1 is sufficient to sustain the

conviction of the appellants and whether its trustworthiness is satisfactory.

7. According to the evidence of PW1, during the relevant period, she was residing at

Kaleel Place, Kalutara. The incident had occurred around 9.00–10.00 p.m. on that

night. The witness heard someone shouting, “ෆාරිස්ට ගහනවා” (“They are assaulting

Faris”). When she ran towards the road, she saw the deceased lying there with cut

injuries. She further stated that the deceased was lying on his stomach and that the

appellants were present at the scene, but upon seeing her, they ran away.

Furthermore, the witness stated that all the appellants were armed, and the 6th

appellant was carrying a sword in his hand. According to PW1, when she arrived at

the scene, only the appellants were present. Thereafter, the deceased was taken to the

hospital, and the witness made a statement to the police.

8. The second witness who testified on behalf of the prosecution was PW3, Jaizer

Zaheed Mohamed, the father of the deceased. He did not witness the incident but

went to the scene about ten minutes after PW1 had arrived there. When this witness

reached the scene, no one was present. According to his testimony, he was unaware

of any dispute or animosity between the appellants and the deceased. He stated that

HCC/0015/0022/2024

5 | P a g e

he was informed of the incident by another person, and only thereafter did he proceed

to the scene.

9. PW 4 K.Sunil Kumara is the Judicial Medical Officer who performed the autopsy of

the deceased. According to him there were 18 injuries on the deceased and they were

sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of the nature.

10. It is in evidence that a vehicle was damaged due to an explosion at the scene.

However, PW1, in her testimony, made no mention of such an occurrence. This

omission casts a serious doubt as to whether PW1 was indeed present at the scene at

the time the deceased was being attacked. The central thrust of the Appellants’

argument is that PW1’s evidence is unreliable and lacks creditworthiness. It could

also be observed that, according to her own account, when she arrived at the scene,

the deceased had already been attacked. At page 182 of the record, the witness

testified as follows:

ප්රt : තමන් යන කකොට කට්ටියක් දිව්වා කිව්වා ?

උ : ඔව්.

ප්රt : තමන් ඊට පසුව ගියා ද ත්රීද කය ද යකයක් ක්න්න ?

උ : ඔව්.

ප්රt : තමන් එතනට ගිහිං ඒ එක්කම ත්රීද කය ද යකයක් ක්න්න ගියාද ?

උ : නහැ. පුතා කපලා තිබුනා. ඒ කවලාකව් තමයි මම ගිකේ. එතනින් කමහාට

එන්න ඔන ත්රීදවීල් එ එකක් ගන්න.

…………….

Vide Page 182

11. It is also significant to note that when PW1 went to the Police, she had sufficient time

to gather all the necessary information before making her statement. As elicited

during cross-examination, PW1 gave her statement to the Police at around 7.20 p.m.

on the following day. Furthermore, when PW1 went to the scene, the deceased had

already fallen to the ground with injuries.

උ : නෑ කවුරුත් එකහම සාක්ෂියක් දීලා නෑ.

ප්රt : දැන් තමුන් කියන විදියට තමුන් එතනට යන කකොට කේ පුතා බිම වැටිලා

උ : ඔව්.

…………….

Vide Page 195

12. A careful examination of PW1’s testimony reveals that she had not witnessed the

deceased being attacked. It was nearly 20 hours after the incident that PW1 made a

statement to the Police. There is no plausible explanation for this delay, which

remains unexplained either by PW1, any other lay witnesses, or the Police Officers

involved in the investigation.

13. The most critical issue in this case is the reliability of the evidence concerning the

identification of the Appellants by PW1. The entire prosecution case rests upon the

testimony of PW1, who is the sole eyewitness. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully

examine and evaluate the credibility of her evidence, particularly in relation to the

identification of the Appellants. As admitted by PW1, she first heard someone

shouting and then proceeded towards the scene. According to her evidence, all the

Appellants were known to her prior to the alleged incident.

14. Although PW1 stated that the 1st Accused was armed with a sword, she had not made

such a statement at the inquest held before the Magistrate on the 1st of April.

Furthermore, during the trial before the High Court, PW1 appeared confused when

asked to identify the Appellants and made errors while identifying them in the dock.

15. The Investigating Officer, PW7, testified that when the Magistrate visited the scene

of the crime and inquired whether there was anyone who could provide evidence

regarding the incident, no one came forward. This evidence further casts doubt on

whether PW1 had, in fact, witnessed the deceased being attacked. It is significant to

note that PW1, in her own testimony, admitted that she went to the Police only on the

following day around 7.20 p.m. According to the evidence of PW5, he visited the

crime scene immediately after receiving the first complaint, around 11.10 p.m. on the

day of the incident, but found no eyewitnesses present. More importantly, when the

Magistrate visited the crime scene on 5th March 2023, no eyewitnesses were disclosed

HCC/0015/0022/2024

7 | P a g e

at that time either. Therefore, the question arises as to whether PW1 actually saw the

incident. Had PW1 witnessed the deceased being attacked by the Appellants, she

could reasonably have been expected to come forward when requested to do so by

either PW5 or the Magistrate. However, PW1 did not come forward as a witness until

7.20 p.m. on the following day.

16. The evidence of PW1, when analyzed, reveals that it is inconsistent and vague,

particularly with regard to the identification of the appellants. During the trial, PW1

failed to make an accurate dock identification, as she wrongly identified the 3rd

appellant as Kaffer. Similarly, PW1 identified the 5th appellant as the 6th appellant,

and again, she identified the 4th appellant as the 5th appellant (vide pages 167 and

168).

17. In this case, PW1 is the sole eyewitness to the crime; therefore, in order to secure a

conviction against the Appellants, her evidence must be clear, cogent, and free from

uncertainties. In other words, the credibility and reliability of her testimony must

reach a high standard so as to establish the charges against the Appellants beyond

reasonable doubt.

18. At the trial before the High Court, PW1 stated that when she arrived at the scene

where the deceased was lying, the Appellants were present, and upon seeing her, they

ran away. She testified as follows:

ප්රt : තමුන් කිව්වා පුද්ගලයන් 08 කදකනක් හටියා කියලා ?

උ : ඔව්.

ප්රt : කවුද?

Vide Page 165,166

19. During cross-examination, PW1 further stated that when she arrived at the scene, a

group of people ran away, and she saw that her son had been cut.

20. It is also pertinent to note that although PW1 stated at the trial that the 6th Appellant

was armed with a sword, she had not mentioned this fact at the inquest before the

learned Magistrate, which was held six days after the incident.

21. Furthermore, the uncertainty in her evidence regarding the identification of the

appellants can again be observed at page 214, where she stated that:

ප්රt : තමන් කේ සිද්ධිය ඇසින් දුටු සාක්ෂිකරුකවක් කනොවන බව මම කය ජනා

කයනවා?

උ : කේ කගො එකල ඔක්කකොම කයල තිකයන්කන්. ප්රt : කේ සිද්ධිකේ තමන් සිටිකේ නැහැ කියලා කය ජනා කයනවා?

උ : නි එ පාට සයම ඇඳලා, ලන්කට් ඇඳලා මම වැටිලා ක එ ගලනවා. Vide page 214

22. Similarly, at page 217, PW1 admitted that the appellants were fleeing when she

arrived at the scene, which further demonstrates that by the time PW1 reached the

location, the attack had already taken place, and she had no opportunity to witness the

deceased being assaulted with weapons.

23. More importantly, PW7 Gamini Silva, in his evidence, stated that when he visited the

scene with the Magistrate, several people had gathered there; however, when the

Magistrate inquired whether there were any eyewitnesses, no one came forward.

24. Since the Appellants were charged under Section 296 read together with Section 32

of the Penal Code, it is essential to establish the participatory presence of each

Appellant at the scene of the crime. Only on that basis can the Appellants be found

guilty under the principle of common intention. Nevertheless, upon a careful

consideration of PW1’s evidence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain the

participatory presence of the Appellants, as her testimony does not reveal any sharing

of a common intention among them.

25. As held in King v. Assappu (50 NLR 324), the sharing of a common murderous

intention is an essential ingredient in a charge of this nature. In the absence of proof

of such shared intention, Section 32 of the Penal Code cannot be invoked to convict a

person on the basis of common intention. In Assappu, it was held:

In a case where the question of common intention arises the Jury must he directed

that:

(i) the case of each accused must be considered separately.

(ii) the accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the act at the time the offence was committed.

(iii) common intention must not be confused with same or similar intention

entertained independently of each other.

(iv) there must be evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of

prearrangement or some other evidence of common intention.

(v) the mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offence

is not necessarily evidence of common intention.

26. When two or more persons are indicted for murder under the principle of common

intention, the participation of each accused must be examined separately. Particularly

HCC/0015/0022/2024

10 | P a g e

in the absence of direct evidence, the Court must exercise great caution in

determining whether the surrounding circumstances are sufficient to establish the

guilt of all the accused. Mere suspicion or assertion cannot serve to establish the guilt

of the appellants. Moreover, the trial Judge must be satisfied that each accused was

acting with a common intention at the time of committing the offence.

27. In Wimalasena v. IP Hambantota 74 NLR 176, the court held that: “Mere presence

of an accused person is not sufficient to establish common intention within the

meaning of section 32 of the Penal Code”.

28. Regrettably, the learned High Court Judge has not discussed the applicability of

common intention to this case, despite the fact that the appellants were charged on

that basis. In his judgment, the learned trial Judge failed to set out the grounds upon

which all the appellants were convicted of the murder of the deceased. Notably, the

learned High Court Judge did not analyze the evidence in the context of Section 32 of

the Penal Code, nor did he explain how the appellants were convicted as members of

an unlawful assembly under Section 140 of the Penal Code. The judgment contains

no analysis as to how or why each appellant was found guilty of the charges, and in

particular, the evidence against each appellant was never discussed, an omission

which, in my view, is fatal to the sustainability of the conviction.

29. It is a settled principle that when appellants are charged with murder on the basis of

common intention or for being members of an unlawful assembly, the prosecution

must prove the culpability of each appellant by cogent and reliable evidence. The trial

judge also bears an indispensable duty to analyze and evaluate the evidence against

each accused to satisfy himself that their participation and shared intention are clearly

manifested by the evidence adduced at the trial. As held in King v. Assappu (supra),

the sharing of a common murderous intention is the very essence of a charge under

Section 32 of the Penal Code, and in the absence of such proof, the section cannot be

invoked.

30. Similarly, in Pandurang, Tukia and Bhillia v. State of Hyderabad (AIR 1955 SC

216), it was held that mere presence at the scene of the crime does not make a person

liable under the principle of common intention unless there is clear evidence of

participation and a pre-arranged plan. In Masalti v. State of Uttar Pradesh (AIR 1965

HCC/0015/0022/2024

11 | P a g e

SC 202), the Supreme Court emphasized that to establish liability under the concept

of common object, it must be proved that each accused shared or was aware of that

object.

31. Therefore, the mere presence of the appellants at the scene, without evidence of

active participation or shared intent, is insufficient to sustain a conviction based on

common intention or common object. What has to be proved against a person who is

alleged to be a member of an unlawful assembly is that he was one of the persons

constituting the assembly, and he entertained along with the other members of the

assembly the common object

32. Furthermore, to secure a conviction under section 146 of the Penal Code it must be

proved either that the offence was committed in prosecution of the common object of

the assembly or that the appellants were aware the offence was likely to be committed

in prosecution of that object. In King vs Sellathurai 48 NLR 570 it was held that:

In order to make members of an unlawful assembly vicariously liable for the

act of any one of them under section 146 of the Penal Code, the act must be

one which, upon the evidence, appears to have been done with a view to

accomplish the common object attributed to the members of the unlawful

assembly.

The vicarious liability attaching to a person by reason of his being a member

of an unlawful assembly is not sufficient for a member of such assembly who

is unarmed to be found guilty of an offence under section 141 of the Penal

Code.

33. In the present case, the only common object of the unlawful assembly alleged in

Count 2 was to commit the murder of Mohammed Fariz. The offence must have been

committed in prosecution of that common object. The fact that all the appellants did

not personally attack the deceased makes no difference to their liability under Count

2. Nevertheless, it must be established that each appellant, while being a member of

the unlawful assembly, shared the common object of committing the murder of the

deceased.

HCC/0015/0022/2024

12 | P a g e

34. In other words, what has to be proved against a person alleged to be a member of an

unlawful assembly is that he was one of the persons constituting the assembly and

that he, along with the other members, entertained the common object.

35. As stated in The King Vs. Abeywickrama 4 NLR 254, 256, “once they were found to

be members of an unlawful assembly, the extent of their participation is immaterial

when we are considering their liability in law. In regard to that liability, they also

serve who stand and wait.”

36. However, the pivotal issue in the present case is whether the evidence of the sole

eyewitness, namely PW1, inspires the confidence of the Court to sustain the

conviction of the appellants, given the vagueness and inconsistencies discernible,

particularly in relation to the identification of the appellants. Case law has

consistently emphasized that while identification of an accused person is a crucial

element in establishing guilt, such identification must be proved beyond reasonable

doubt. Courts have repeatedly cautioned against relying on weak identification

evidence, especially when it is based on a fleeting glance or solely on dock

identification.

37. In R. v. Turnbull [1977] QB 224, the English Court of Appeal laid down important

guidelines for assessing identification evidence, emphasizing that such evidence can

be unreliable unless properly tested with caution. It is desirable to emphasize that

when the identity of the accused is in issue, the testimony of an identifying witness

must be subjected to the most careful scrutiny, and conviction should not rest on

identification evidence unless the Court is satisfied that the witness had a clear and

unobstructed view and sufficient opportunity for observation.

38. In the present case, it is evident that the testimony of PW1 does not provide a firm

foundation for a finding of guilt. Her evidence reveals that she reached the scene only

after the attack had taken place and that the appellants were fleeing when she arrived.

This fact alone casts serious doubt on her ability to correctly identify the assailants.

Furthermore, her failure to mention certain material facts at the inquest, such as the

weapons allegedly carried by the appellants, and the inconsistencies in her testimony

during the trial, substantially weaken the reliability of her evidence. In these

circumstances, it would be unsafe to base a conviction solely on her uncorroborated

HCC/0015/0022/2024

13 | P a g e

identification, which, according to established judicial precedent, demands the

highest degree of scrutiny before acceptance. Thus, where identification evidence is

weak, uncertain, or inconsistent, the benefit of the doubt must necessarily be extended

to the accused.

39. It could be observed from the evidence of PW1 that she was inconsistent regarding

the identification of the appellants at the scene. A careful examination of her

testimony raises a serious question as to whether she had, in fact, seen the appellants

attacking the deceased. On one occasion, she stated that when she went to the scene,

the deceased was already lying with cut injuries and that the appellants ran away

upon seeing her. However, at another point, she claimed that when she arrived, the

deceased was being attacked by the appellants. When her testimony is examined in its

entirety, it reveals vagueness and material inconsistencies concerning identification.

Therefore, it would be unsafe to base a conviction solely on PW1’s evidence, which

is tainted with significant uncertainties and contradictions.

40. Unfortunately, the learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration to

the aforesaid weaknesses discernible in the testimony of PW1, who was the sole

eyewitness to the incident. Moreover, the learned High Court Judge misdirected

himself by concluding that the appellants had evaded arrest for a period of three

months and, on that basis, drew an adverse inference against them based on their

subsequent conduct. However, the evidence clearly indicates that the appellants had

surrendered themselves within a few days of the incident. Furthermore, the learned

High Court Judge has not adequately evaluated the defence evidence, including the

dock statements. Significantly, the rejection of the defence evidence appears to have

been unduly influenced by the erroneous finding that the appellants had been evading

arrest for three months.

41. Accordingly, in view of the foregoing observations, it is evident that the conviction of

the appellants is unsafe to be sustained. The prosecution has failed to prove the

charges beyond reasonable doubt, particularly in light of the infirmities in the

testimony of PW1 and the misdirection apparent in the reasoning of the learned High

Court Judge. Therefore, I find that the conviction and sentence entered against the

appellants cannot stand in law.

HCC/0015/0022/2024

42. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence are hereby set aside. The appellants are

acquitted of all charges. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
