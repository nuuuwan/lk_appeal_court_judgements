"CA/HCC/0045/2023"
"24. In the present case, the Appellant has preferred the Petition of Appeal to this Court after"
"17 years from the date of the Judgment and therefore there is inordinate and undue delay"
"in lodging this Appeal. It appears that this delay had been caused mainly due to the fact"
"that  the  Appellant  was  absconding  the  law  enforcement  authorities.  In  other  words,  the"
"delay could be attributed to the contumacious conduct of the Appellant."
"25. It  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  the  Appellant  had  been  served  the  Indictment  on  20-11-"
"2001 and was  well aware of the case pending  against him. However, the Appellant  had"
"been absconding for almost 17 years until he was arrested and produced before the Court."
"Therefore,  it  cannot  be  reasonably  inferred  that  the  Appellantâ€™s  absence  was  due  to  his"
"ignorance of the case against him."
"26. Given the undue delay and the contumacious conduct of the Appellant, this Court is not"
"inclined  to  exercise  its  revisionary  powers  to  revise  the  Judgment  of  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge dated 27-07-2005."
"27. Moreover,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submitted  that  there  was  no  evidence"
"before the learned High Court Judge to proceed under section 241 of the CCPA."
"28.  However, the learned High Court Judge has conducted an inquiry prior to have the trial"
"in absentia against the Appellant on 27-11-2002."
"29. It is important to note that, at the said inquiry, a police constable attached to Katharagama"
"Police Station named Herath Mudiyanselage Sampath Hasitha Bandara Herath who was"
"assigned  with  the  task  of  executing  the  warrants,  had  given  evidence  stating  that  the"
"whereabouts of the Appellant could not be found despite his best efforts and that he had"
"inquired from the Grama Niladari and the chief prelate of the temple in the relevant area"
"that the Appellant was residing, about his whereabouts, but to no avail."
"30. Therefore, it is quite clear that it was after holding a proper inquiry that the learned High"
"Court Judge has decided to hold the trial in absentia against the Appellant."
"31. In Gunasiri and Others and Albara Dura Ananda v  The State [1990] 2 Sri LR 265 it"
"was held inter alia that:"
"When an accused keeps away from Court deliberately, without attending the trial, it is"
"not necessary to hold a second inquiry before the trial commences, where the Court"
"has already satisfied itself after inquiry, that the accused is absconding."
