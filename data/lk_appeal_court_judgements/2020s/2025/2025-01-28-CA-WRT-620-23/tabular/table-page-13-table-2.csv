"SLR  70 at page  73, His Lordship Jayasuriya, J held that;"
"“I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a"
"writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right"
"or  as  a  matter  of routine.  Even  if  he  is  entitled  to  relief,  still  the  court  has  a"
"discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver,"
"submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments which stand against the grant"
"of relief.”"
