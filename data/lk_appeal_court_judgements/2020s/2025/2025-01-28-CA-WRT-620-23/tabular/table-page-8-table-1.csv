"30.09.2023 to settle the outstanding amounts from the Respondent bank upon negotiating"
"a settlement plan with the Respondent Bank, by letter dated 18.07.2023 marked P23, the"
"Respondent  bank  notified  the  Petitioners  that  the  property  in  which  the  “Eminence"
"Luxury Banquet Hall” is situated was published in the Gazette and newspapers purported"
"acting under Section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Bank (Special Provisions) Act No.4 of"
"1990."
"The  Petitioners  further  state  that,  by  letter  dated  25.09.2023,  the  Petitioners  were"
"notified that the property containing “Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall” will be sold at a"
"public auction on 23.10.2023 at 9.00 a.m."
"Further, the Petitioners state that the Resolution marked P23A had appointed the 13th"
"Respondent  to  sell  the  land  of  the  Petitioners  at  a  public  auction  on  the  said  date.  As"
"averred by the Petitioners, the letter marked P24 inter alia states that the Petitioners are"
"not  entitled  to  the  moratorium  granted  by  the  Central  Bank  on  07.07.2022  as  the"
"Petitioners had not come to an agreement with the Respondent on any settlement plan."
"The Petitioners state that according to Circular No. 2 of 2022 dated 07.07.2022 marked"
"P25, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank had directed the licensed banks including"
"the Respondent to consider granting concessions on a case-by-case basis by clause 4.1 of"
"the said Circular."
"The Petitioners state that the Respondent had not conducted a valuation of the property"
"pursuant to auctioning of the said property."
"The main grievance of the Petitioners is that the Resolution passed by the Respondent"
"Bank  to  sell  the  property  containing  “Eminence  Luxury  Banquet  Hall”  by  auction  is"
"arbitrary  and  unreasonable  on  the  basis  that  the  said  auction  was  called  without"
"conducting  a  valuation  for  a  period  of  more  than  three  years  of  the  said  property  and"
"without ascertaining the current market value."
