"“Sub section (1) above provides for the borrower to prevent the auction being held"
"provided  he/she  tenders  to  the  Board  unpaid  portion  of  the  loan  together  with"
"interest and the costs incurred thereto. Sub section (2) allows the borrower to pay"
"the installment in respect of which default has been made with the moneys and"
"costs recoverable by the Bank and then to request the Board to halt the auctioning"
"of the property mortgaged using its discretion referred to therein. Therefore, it is"
"clear that the borrower should have paid the unpaid installments if he/she has not"
"paid the entire unpaid amount, in order to move under Section 10 of the Act No.4"
"of 1990.”"
