"the   priceless   advantage   to   observe   the   demeanour   and   deportment   of   the"
"witness which the Court of Appeal does not have.”"
"31. In the present case, the decision reached by the learned Trial Judge on the totality of the"
"evidence does not contain any substantial misdirection or non-direction either on the"
"facts or law."
"32. As stated earlier, the credibility of PW1’s testimony remains intact despite some trivial"
"contradictions, which do not weaken the prosecution’s case. The learned High Court"
"Judge carefully analyzed and evaluated the evidence presented by the prosecution"
"before finding the appellant guilty of the charge of grave sexual abuse."
"33. Furthermore, he has adequately taken into account the contradictions highlighted by the"
"defense and has provided sufficient and cogent reasons as to why those contradictions"
"alone are not enough to render the victim an untrustworthy witness or to undermine the"
"credibility of his evidence."
"34. More importantly, the learned Judge discussed the relevant legal principles and applied"
"them correctly in determining the appellant’s guilt. Therefore, there is no reasonable"
"basis, upon which, his decision could be interfered with."
"35. For the reasons stated above, I dismiss the appeal. Accordingly, I affirm the conviction"
"of the appellant and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge. The"
"sentence shall run from the date of the judgment."
