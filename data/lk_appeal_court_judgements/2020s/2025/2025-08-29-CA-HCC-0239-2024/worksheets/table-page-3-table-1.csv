"","Madhushan, the victim, who testified as PW1. According to his evidence, the appellant"
"","was known to him and was also a distant relative. On the day of the incident, the victim"
"","was playing with his friends at a nearby playground. Before the victim went to the"
"","playground, the appellant had met him and asked him to come to the appellant's house."
"","After playing, the victim visited the appellant's house as requested."
"7.","According to the victim, the alleged offense was committed on him by the appellant on"
"","a makeshift bed at the latter's residence. The appellant asked the victim to remove his"
"","clothes, which he did. Thereafter, the appellant also undressed himself, placed his penis"
"","between the victim's thighs, and moved up and down until he ejaculated. After that, the"
"","appellant gave the victim Rs 200/-, and the victim returned home. At the time of the"
"","alleged offense, the victim was 12 years old."

"","cardinal issue that needs consideration of this court is whether a particular piece of"
"","evidence which the appellant claims to be contradictions, significant and quite material"
"","which go to the root of the prosecution case.  In this regard, following authorities would"
"","be of much assistance."
