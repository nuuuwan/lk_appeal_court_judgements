"19. In the case of Gamini Sugathasena & the Others v. The State 1998 (1) SLR 405 whilst"
"discussing the procedure in marking contradictions, the court held that;"
"""when a witness is to be contradicted the proper procedure is set out in section 145"
"of the Evidence Ordinance. This section contemplates that when a witness is to"
"be contradicted, his attention must be first drawn to the fact of having made a"
"previous statement and thereafter, more specifically, to the parts of the statement"
"which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. It is only after that the"
"actual writing from which the witness was contradicted, can be proved"""
