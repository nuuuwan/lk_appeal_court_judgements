"the delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court"
"could act on the evidence of a belated witness.”"
"25. Justice Sisira De Abrew in the case of Anandappan Vishawanadan v AG, SC Appeal"
"15/2018, decided on 12.2.2021, held that:"
"(1) “I hold that court should not reject the evidence of a witness who has made a"
"belated statement to the Police if the delay has been explained. In the present"
"case the delay in making the statement to the Police has been explained. Thus,"
"the   decision   of   the   learned   trial   Judge   to   accept   the   evidence   of   witness"
"Murugase Ravindran cannot be found fault with.”"
"26. Therefore, in light of the above authorities, the belatedness of the victim’s complaint in"
"the present case does not, in my opinion, significantly affect the credibility of PW1’s"
"testimony."
"27. It is also pertinent to emphasize that it is not the function of an appellate court to re-try a"
"case already tried. In legal proceedings, the credibility of a witness is indeed primarily a"
"matter   for   the   trial   judge   to   determine. The   judge,   having   observed   the   witness's"
"demeanor and delivery firsthand, is in the best position to assess the truthfulness and"
"reliability of their testimony.  The appellate court will not overturn a finding of fact"
"unless it's manifestly wrong."
"28. In this regard, it is relevant to refer to the dictum in Fraad vs. Brown & Co. Ltd. 20"
"NLR 282, where it was held that when the issue is mainly on the credibility of witnesses"
"an appellate court should not interfere unless the findings of the judge are perverse."
"29. As held in Dharmasiri vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2010] 2 SR1L.R 241, credibility of a"
"witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge, Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the"
"findings of a trial Judge with regard to the credibility of a witness unless such findings"
"of trial Judge are manifestly wrong."
"30. In Ariyadasa v Attorney-General, [2012] 1 Sri. L.R. 84, Sisira de Abrew, has held as"
"follows:"
"(1) “Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb a finding of a trial Judge with regard to"
"the acceptance or rejection of a testimony of a witness, unless it is manifestly"
"wrong, when the trial judge has taken such a decision after observing the"
"demeanour and the deportment of a witness. This is because the trial Judge has"
