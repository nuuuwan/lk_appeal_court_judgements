"are  all  necessary  parties.  If  their  number  is  very  large,  some  of  them  could  be  made"
"respondents in a representative capacity (vide Prabodh Derma v. State of Uttara Pradesh"
"AIR 1985 – SC 167 also see Encyclopedia of Writ By P.M. Bakshi).””"
"In the instant case, the petition itself states that 207 members had been elected to Executive"
"Committees and the petition in Writ Application No. HCW 02/2023 marked P15 discloses their"
"identities. Therefore, the Petitioner was fully aware of the identities of the members elected to"
"Executive Committees of Branch Societies. Considering the adverse impact upon their rights"
"and interests, if the reliefs sought by the Petitioner are to be granted, I am of the view that such"
"members  are  necessary and  material parties  to the  instant  application. Hence,  I  uphold the"
"objection raised by the learned State Counsel that the Petitioner has failed to cite necessary"
"and material parties in this application."
