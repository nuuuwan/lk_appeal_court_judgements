"Provided, however, that the Registrar or any person so authorised by him shall not have"
"the right to vote at any such meeting."
"It is evident from the provisions of the aforementioned Rule 18(ii) that the appointment of the"
"4th Respondent to convene the meetings of the Executive Committees of Branch Societies and"
"to appoint their office bearers and representatives to the General Assembly of the Petitioner"
"clearly falls within the powers conferred upon the 1st Respondent therein, in the capacity as the"
"Registrar of Co-operatives of the North-Western Province."
"T
herefore, the next issue to be considered is whether the exercise of such power by the 1st"
"Respondent was rational and reasonable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case. The"
"first  paragraph  of  P48  above  notes  the  fact  that,  despite  repeated  directions,  the  General"
"Manager/ Secretary  of the Petitioner  had failed to  convene  meetings of Branch  Societies  to"
"appoint their office bearers and representatives to the General Assembly. In fact, the current"
"Board of Directors of the Petitioner have consistently maintained the position that the General"
"Assembly should not convene in view of unresolved issues pertaining to the Branch Societies"
"elections."
"It is observed that, since it consists of representatives of Branch Societies, the General Assembly"
"cannot be convened unless and until such representatives of Branch Societies are appointed."
"Hence, the resultant position from stance adopted by the Petitioner was that that the General"
"Assembly  could  not  be  convened,  notwithstanding  the  three-month  time  limit  specified  for"
"such purpose in By-Law 33(2) of the Petitionerâ€™s By-Laws. Such three-month period expired on"
"17.04.2023. 
In  such  circumstances,  as  submitted  by  the 
learned  State  Counsel,  the  1st"
"Respondent was  compelled  to  intervene by  appointing  an  Authorized  Officer  to ensure  that"
"statutory obligations cast on the Petitioner by its own constituent By-Laws were carried out,"
"given the repeated refusal of its current Board of Management to do so for a period of almost"
"one (01) year and ten (10) months."
"I  am 
inclined  to  accept  the  submission  of  the 
learned  State  Counsel.  Viewed  from  such"
"attendant factual circumstances, I find that the appointment of the 4th Respondent by the 1st"
"Respondent to carry out the functions set out in P48 and the action taken pursuant thereto by"
"the 4th Respondent by publishing the Notice marked P49 cannot in any manner be considered"
"as being irrational or unreasonable, as alleged by the Petitioner. If at all, I am of the view that"
"such intervention by the 1st Respondent should have been made earlier, since the term of office"
"of Executive Committee members is three (3) years, and one-year (01) and ten (10) months had"
"already lapsed by the time such intervention was made. I am further inclined to add that, had"
"the 1st Respondent not intervened, the legitimately elected members of the Branch Societies"
