"cases where discretionary relief is sought from Court, but even in Admiralty cases involving"
"the grant of injunctions.”"
"T
he 
learned  State  Counsel  referred  to  several  aspects 
in  the  conduct  of  the  Petitioner"
"demonstrating a serious lack of uberrima fides on its part. One such aspect was the conduct of"
"the General Manager/Secretary of the Petitioner, who had certified the veracity of the lists of"
"voters used for the election held on 17.01.2023 and signed P9a and had now sought to assail"
"the validity of the same in the instant application. Another aspect referred to by the learned"
"State  Counsel  was  the  contradictory  positions  taken  up  by  the  Petitioner 
in  the 
instant"
"application and in the writ application before the Provincial High Court. It was pointed out that,"
"although the Petitioner has sought to prevent the convening of the meetings of the Executive"
"Committees  of  Branch  Societies  and  the  General  Assembly  in  the  instant  application,  it  had"
"nevertheless not supported the application for interim relief in the Provincial High Court Writ"
"Application No. HCW 02/2023, when the petitioner in that case had sought similar relief. In the"
"order  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge,  it  is  specifically  recorded  that  the  1st,  8th  and  220th"
"respondents, who constitute the Petitioners in the instant application, had sought to associate"
"themselves with the submissions made by other respondents who had opposed the grant of"
"interim relief (vide page 22)."
"T
he 
learned  State  Counsel  submitted 
that  such  conduct  constituted  “approbation  and"
"reprobation,” which is repugnant to the law."
"In  Ceylon  Plywoods  Corporation  v.  Samastha  Lanka  G.N.S.M.  &  Rajya  Sanstha  Sevaka"
"Sangamaya10  (per  S.  N.  Silva,  J)  held  that  “the  doctrine  of  approbate  and  reprobate  (quod"
"approbo non reprobo) is based on the principle that no person can accept and reject the same"
"instrument”.  A Divisional Bench of the Supreme Court has explained the manner in which the"
"doctrine  applies  in  Ranasinghe  v.  Premadharma  and  others,11  in  the  following  terms  (per"
"Sharvananda CJ);"
