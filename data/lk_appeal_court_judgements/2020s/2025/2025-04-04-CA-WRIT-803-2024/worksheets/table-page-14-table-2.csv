"standard expected to establish mala fides in judicial review applications. With regard to such"
"standard required, this Court has held in Bandaranayake v. Judicial Service Commission,5 as"
"follows (per Sripavan J.);"
"“Learned Counsel also urged bad faith on the part of the first respondent Commission."
"""The plea of mala fides is raised often but it is only rarely it can be substantiated to the"
"satisfaction of Court.  Merely raising doubt is not enough. There should be something"
"specific, direct and precise to sustain the plea of mala fides. The burden of proving mala"
"fides is on the individual making allegation as the order is regular on its face and there"
"is a presumption in favour of the administration that it exercises its power in good faith"
"and for the public benefit."" Principles of Administrative Law (Jain & Jain, 4th Edition 1988"
"Page 564) Accordingly, the court will not in general entertain allegations of bad faith"
"made against the repository of a power, unless bad faith has been expressly pleaded and"
"properly  enumerated  in  detail.  [Vide  Gunasinghe  v  Hon  Gamini Dissanayake].6  The"
"petition however did not set out in detail the allegations of mala fide against the first"
"respondent Commission.”"
