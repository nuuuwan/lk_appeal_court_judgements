"of the pathologist that the death was primarily caused due to the head"
"injuries. He had explained the process by which death results due to the"
"direct effect and consequence of injuries No. 1A and 1B."
"16. The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is that there was a"
"delay in obtaining the required medical attention, and this resulted in"
"the death of the deceased. According to the totality of the evidence, the"
"appellant  had  dealt  multiple  blows  on  the  head,  neck,  and  abdomen"
"using an axe. The pathologist confirms that the injuries No. 4, 11, and"
"12, found on the forearm and the hands of the deceased, are probably"
"defence  injuries.  This  inferentially  establishes  that  the  deceased  had"
"made  an  attempt  to  wade  off  the  blows,  but  despite  his  effort,  the"
"appellant had succeeded in inflicting blows with extreme force. When a"
"person uses the blunt side (the handle end of the axe head) and directs"
"the  blows  to  the  head  and  the  abdomen,  the  only  intention  that  is"
"inferentially possible is that he intends at least to cause bodily injury to"
"the victim. The medical evidence confirms that the said injuries No. 1A"
"and 1B did cause his death notwithstanding the immediate attention of"
"blood transfusion and saline being given. The deceased had died around"
"05:45  AM  at  04.08.2006.  This  is  approximately  within  12  hours  of"
"sustaining the injuries. As explained by the pathologist, the death has"
"been so caused as a direct consequence of the brain damage, affecting"
"the functions of the heart and the lung. Therefore, even if there was no"
"medical intervention, it is established without any doubt that the nature"
"of the head injuries was such that it was sufficient in the ordinary course"
"of  nature  to  cause  the  death.  Accordingly,  the  evidence  has  clearly"
"established that the appellant had acted with the intention of causing"
"bodily  injury  and  the  injury  so  inflicted  was  sufficient  in  the  ordinary"
"course of nature to cause the death of the deceased. This comes within"
"the 3rd limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code."
"17. In the post argument written submission, the appellant submits that the"
"medical evidence reveals that there was a scuffle or a fight between the"
"assailant  and  the  deceased.  On  the  perusal  of  the  medical  evidence,"
