"“Though  Section  334(1)  refers 
to  cases  of 
trial  by 
jury, 
it 
is"
"reasonable  and  proper 
to  assume 
that 
the 
intention  of 
the"
"legislation must necessarily be the same, whether it is a trial before"
"a Jury or Judge sitting alone. The deciding factor being that there"
"should  be  evidence  upon  which  the  accused  might  reasonably"
"have been convicted.” (Emphasis added)."
