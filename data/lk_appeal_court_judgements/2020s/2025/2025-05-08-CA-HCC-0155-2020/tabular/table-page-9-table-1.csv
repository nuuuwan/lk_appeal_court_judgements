"several  blows  on  vital  areas 
(head  and  abdomen)  with  a  heavy"
"instrument;  an  axe.  This  evidence  sufficiently  proves  the  subjective"
"intention  being  none  other  than  to  cause  bodily  injury.  There  simply"
"cannot  be  any  other  reasonable  inference  or  hypothesis.  As  to  the"
"sufficiency in the ordinary course of nature to cause death is required"
"to be considered objectively (vide Farook vs. Attorney General). It was"
"held as follows:"
"“The third clause discards the test of subjective knowledge. It deals"
"with  acts  done  with  the  intention  of  causing  bodily  injury  to  a"
"person and the bodily injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of"
"nature to cause death. In this clause the result of the intentionally"
"caused  injury  must  be  viewed  objectively.  If  the  injury  that  the"
"offender  intends  causing  and  does  cause  is  sufficient  to  cause"
"death in the ordinary way of nature the offence is murder whether"
"the  offender 
intended  causing  death  or  not  and  whether  the"
"offender had a subjective knowledge of the consequences or not.”"
"21. Accordingly,  the  operative  element  of  limb  3  of  Section  294  is  the"
"intention of the appellant to cause bodily injury. As to the nature of the"
"injury  there  is  no  requirement  of  proving  that  the  appellant  had  the"
"subjective  knowledge  of  its  consequences.  This  limb  appears  to  have"
"been formulated based on the presumption that the person intends the"
"natural  and  probable  consequences  of  his  conduct.  Hence,  when  the"
"appellant intends to cause bodily injury, it shall be presumed that he"
"also  intends  natural  and  probable  consequences  of  such  injury  so"
"inflicted. In Chandrasena vs. Attorney General (2008) 2 SLR 255, the"
"ingredients  to  establish  murder  under  limb  3  of  Section  294  are  as"
