"HCC-0155-20"
"28. On a perusal of the judgement, it is apparent that the Trial Judge has"
"not considered the dock statement separately and determined if the said"
"dock statement creates any doubt or to that matter, there is no express"
"rejection  of  the  dock  statement.  To  that  extent,  the  ground  raised"
"appears to have some merit."
"29. In this backdrop, I would consider the effect of the dock statement in the"
"context of the totality of the prosecution evidence. The sum total of the"
"dock  statement  is  one  of  denial.  Whilst  admitting  his  presence  at  or"
"about  the  time  the  incident  took  place  and  meeting  the  deceased,  his"
"position is that he proceeded to his house, avoiding any confrontation"
"with  the  deceased.  In  the  same  breath,  the  appellant  claims  to  have"
"heard some commotion, and finding out that the deceased was taken to"
"hospital and the appellant then decides to leave and abscond. The police"
"evidence confirms that the appellant did so abscond. The appellant and"
"the deceased are close relatives living in the same neighbourhood. They"
"work together on a regular basis. The appellant claims that he had no"
"previous enmity with the deceased."
"30. That being so, is it natural and normal to have surreptitiously so left?"
"As I see, there is no reason or rationale for the appellant to avoid and"
"leave  in  that  manner  as  claimed.  In  the  normal  course  of  events,  one"
"would  expect  the  appellant  to  have  rushed  to  the  assistance  of  his"
"relative. It is specially so if he happened to hear or see him in trouble."
"This sequence of events and the position taken up by the appellant is"
"inherently improbable and contrary to the normal course of conduct of"
"any rational person. Thus, the dock statement is inherently improbable,"
"it must in all probabilities be false."
"31. Then it is also relevant that the events as narrated in the dock statement"
"have not been suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses. That being"
"so, the position so taken up by the appellant in his dock statement lacks"
"consistency.  On  the  other  hand,  the  appellant  having  made  a  dock"
