"application.  Thereafter, the 4th defendant petitioner made this application to"
"this court."
"T
his application of the 4th Defendant affects only to his two siblings, the 9th"
"and  10th  defendants.  The  9th  and  10th  defendants  filed  objections  to  the"
"petitioner's  application  and 
took  up  several  preliminary  objections  and"
"technical  objections.      But  they  have  not  disputed  the  facts  pleaded  by  the"
"4thdefendant-petitioner.    There  is  a  glaring  error  and  a  clear  miscarriage  of"
"justice caused to the petitioner for no fault of his own. Therefore, I would not"
"hold with the objections of the 9th and 10th defendants."
"I
n the joint statement of claim of the 1st to 6thdefendants stated that the 4th"
"defendant  and  his  mother  had  transferred  their  rights  to  the  9th  and  10th"
"defendants  by  deed  no.  11233  dated  31-03-1993.    However,  the  9thand"
"10thdefendants  never  filed  a  statement  of  claim  or  gave  evidence  before  the"
"court.  In the evidence led before the District Court, there was no evidence to"
"the effect that the rights of the 4th defendant were transferred to the 9th and"
"10th  defendants.    The  deed  referred  to  in  the  statement  of  claim  was  never"
"produced.  Such a title deed was not produced in the District Court,the Civil"
"Appellate  High  Court,  or 
in  this  Court. 
  The  Learned  Counsel 
for  the"
"petitioner referred to it as a fictitious deed.  Since such a title deed was never"
"forthcoming, it is reasonable to  conclude that there was no such  deed. The"
"Learned  Additional  District  Judge  would  have  relied  on  the  statement  of"
"claim of a party without perusing the title deeds."
"T
he  Learned  Additional  District  Judge 
failed  to  notice  the 
fact  that  by"
"admission  no.  8,  all  parties  have  admitted  that  1/6thundivided  share  of"
"Gunawardena  was  devolved  on  4th,  9th  and  10th  defendants  an  undivided"
"1/18th share each. Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance provides as follows:"
"5
8. No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their"
"agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree"
"to admit by any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in"
"force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings:"
"P
rovided that the court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be"
"proved otherwise than by such admissions."
"N
o  party  has  made  any  application 
to  withdraw 
the  admission  no.  8."
"Further,  no 
issue  has  been  raised  to  the  effect  that  the  rights  of  the"
"4thdefendant  were  transferred  to  the  9th  and  10th  defendants.    The  9th  and"
"10th defendants did not even participate in the trial.   Sections 61 and 62 of"
"the  Evidence  Ordinance  provide  that  â€œthe  contents  of  documents  may  be"
