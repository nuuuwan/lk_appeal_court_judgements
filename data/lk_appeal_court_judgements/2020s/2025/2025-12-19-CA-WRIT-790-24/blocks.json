Once the impugned consignment arrived in Colombo, it was detained by Sri Lanka Customs for failure to produce an export permit in terms of Article IV of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Thereafter, the 2nd Petitioner requested the Customs to allow the 1st Petitioner to re-export the consignment. In the meantime, the Customs commenced an inquiry, and the 2nd Petitioner was required to show cause as to why the said consignment should not be confiscated. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the 2nd Respondent, the inquiring officer, found that the 1st Petitioner had violated the provisions of Article IV of CITES, and thereby the regulations outlined in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2023/51 dated 15.06.2017, issued by virtue of provisions of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 02 of 1996.",
