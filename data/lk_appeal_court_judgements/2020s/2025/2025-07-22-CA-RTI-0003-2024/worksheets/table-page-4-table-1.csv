"issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Mass  Media  in  terms  of  Section  28  of  Sri  Lanka"
"Rupavahini  Corporation  Act  No.  6  of  1982  and  under  the  frequency  licence"
"issued  by  a  Telecommunication  Regulatory  Commission 
(TRC),  under"
"Section  22  of  Sri  Lanka  Telecommunication  Act  No.  25  of  1991. 
  The"
"petitioner 
further  submitted 
that  although  radio 
frequencies  are  public"
"property,  the  mere 
licensed  use  of  a 
frequency  by  a  private  entity 
for"
"commercial  broadcasting  purposes  does  not,  in  itself,  transform  the  entity"
"into one performing a public function or service as contemplated by the RTI"
"Act. 
  As  all 
the  members  of 
the  petitioner  are  engaged 
in 
the  same"
"broadcasting entity and are subject to the exact licensing requirement as the"
"appellant,  the  impact  on  their  members’  rights  and  interests  is  clear  and"
"direct. The petitioner’s position is that the members of the petitioner do not"
"fall within the definition of public authority under section 43 of the RTI Act."
"The  petitioner  further  states  that  the  RTIC's  decision  to  classify  private"
"entities  as  “Public  Authorities”  under  the  RTI  Act  would  have  far-reaching"
"and potentially adverse consequences, extending the scope of the RTI Act to"
"a vast number of private entities.  The petitioner further states that without"
"granting  the  petitioner  a  hearing,  serious  prejudice  would  be  caused  to  the"
"members of the petitioner and seeks to intervene in the appeal."
"T
he 
citizen  who 
sought 
information 
(Appellant-Respondent) 
from  Asia"
"Broadcasting  Corporation 
objected 
to 
the 
petitioner’s 
application 
for"
"intervention 
in 
the  appeal. 
  The  appellant-respondent 
submitted 
the"
"following objections:"
"a.  The Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 do not provide a"
"provision related to third-party intervention."
"b.  The  petitioner  has  no  direct  and  substantial  interest  in  the  subject"
"matter of this application and is not a necessary party to this matter."
"c.  The  petitioner  lacks  Locus  Standi  as  it  was  not  a  party  to  the  RTIC"
"Appeal."
