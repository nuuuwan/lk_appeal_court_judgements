"her entitlement to the shares would relate back to the date of the testator’s"
"death."
"F
urther, 
it  was  submitted 
that 
the  extended  meaning  of  shareholder"
"envisaged  under  section  232  of  the  Companies  Act  supports  the  position"
"taken up by the petitioner. It was argued that 25% of the shares had already"
"devolved  upon  the  petitioner  upon  the  death  of  the  petitioner’s  father.    On"
"behalf  of  the  petitioner,  the 
following  passage 
from  the  Order  made  by"
"Justice D.N. Samarakoon, regarding the preliminary objections taken by the"
"respondents, dated 12-12-2023."
"“The situation, as respondents argued, is that the petitioner must prove"
"the  will  and  then  institute  action  under  sections  224  and  225;  then,  if"
"the District Court of Negombo, after a protracted inquiry, determines that"
"the will is proved, the remedy is rendered nugatory.”"
"I
  also  concur  that  this  is  a  possible  situation.  However,  it  is  not  the  only"
"possible  scenario.    The  District  Court  may  also  dismiss  the  petitioner’s"
"testamentary case. Nonetheless, there is one safeguard that remains in place"
"to protect the rights of the petitioner; that is, once the testamentary action is"
"filed, 
the 
respondents  are  prohibited 
from  disposing  of  any  property"
"belonging to the deceased without leave of the court."
"T
o  be  fair  by  the  petitioner,  I  must  say  that  there  is  nothing  suspicious  on"
"the face of the will; and if the will is genuine, the petitioner has a legitimate"
"grievance. However, it must be noted that there is no presumption as to the"
"genuineness of a last will, even if it appears genuine on the face of it."
"T
he 
law 
in 
this  regard 
is 
that 
the 
title  claimed  under  a  will  can  be"
"established  in  Courts  only  by  the  proof  of  probate.  Probate  of  a  will  is  a"
"precondition  to  establishing  title  under  a  last  will.  This  is  a  long-standing"
"principle of our law. The following cases are examples."
"I
n the case of Charles Hamy vs. Jane Nona,15 NLR 481, Lascelles C.J. stated"
"the following."
"But the question is whether such a proceeding is permissible under the"
"Civil  Procedure  Code  which  now  regulates  the  probate  of  testamentary"
"writings.  To  this  question  there  can  be  but  one  answer. 
If  chapter"
"XXXVIII.  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  means  anything  at  all,  it  means"
"that the wills of persons dying in Ceylon must be proved in the manner"
"therein prescribed, and that they can be proved in no other manner."
