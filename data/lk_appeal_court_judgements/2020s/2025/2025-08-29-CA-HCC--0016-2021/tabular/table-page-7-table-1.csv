"back at the van which had missed and fallen on the road instead. This had"
"been seen by the witnesses."
"It should be noted the alleged parcel of Heroin is last seen by the witnesses"
"in the hands of the person who picked up and threw back at the van."
"PW1, in his evidence told Court that the statement of the person who picked"
"up and threw the parcel back to the van, had been recorded but he was not"
"called to give evidence by the prosecution. Considering the circumstances of"
