"n the Attorney General v Sandanam Pitchai Mary Metilda S.C. Appeal"
"No. 79/2008 decided on 06.05.2010 the Supreme Court held that:"
"â€œWhen  considering  the  testimonial  creditworthiness  of  Matilda,  it  is"
"important to bear in mind established principles on witness credibility"
"which  may  guide  the  Court  in  assessing  the  facts  in  situation  where"
"conflicting  evidence  is  presented.  The  Court  must  be  conscious  of  the"
"fact  that  not  all  witnesses  are  reliable.  A  witness  may  fabricate  or"
"provide a distorted account of the evidence through a personal interest"
"or through genuine error (Vide, Emson, Evidence, 3rd Edition, 2006)."
