"Reasonable doubt is legal terminology referring to insufficient evidence that"
"prevents a judge from convicting a defendant of a crime. In a criminal case,"
"it is the duty of the prosecution to convince the judge that the defendant is"
"guilty of the crime with which he has been charged and, therefore, should"
"be  convicted.   The  phrase  ""beyond  a  reasonable  doubt""  means  that  the"
"evidence  presented  and  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  prosecution"
"establish the defendant's guilt so clearly that they must be accepted as fact"
"by any rational person."
"In Woolmington v DPP (1935) the Court ruled that in criminal cases, the"
"burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt"
"beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  The  defendant  is  presumed  innocent  until"
"proven guilty, and it is not for the defendant to prove his innocence."
"In  the  first  ground  of  appeal  the  Learned  Counsel  contended  that  the"
"evidence of prosecution witnesses failed the test of credibility and probability."
