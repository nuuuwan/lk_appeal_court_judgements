"n Queen v. Buddharakkita Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:"
"“That  the  right  of  an  accused  person  to  make  an  unsworn  statement"
"from the dock is recognized in our law. That right would be of no value"
"unless such statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the accused,"
"subject however to the infirmity which attaches to statements that are"
"unsworn and have not been tested by cross-examination.”"
