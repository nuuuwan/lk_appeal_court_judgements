"substantiate this position. But the Heroin parcel recovered from the place of"
"shooting had been amalgamated with the Heroin parcels said to have been"
"recovered  by  PW4.  This  raises  very  serious  doubts  about  the  recovery  of"
"Heroin as described by the prosecution."
"Further, following the alleged arrest and the subsequent recovery of Heroin,"
"the raiding party had returned to the Dehiwela Police Station in the van along"
"with  the  Appellant,  but  had  not  done  any  examination  of  the  van  at  the"
"Dehiwala Police Station. According to PW1, the van had been inspected at"
"the Borella Police Station after about five and a half hours of the shooting"
"incident and a Heroin parcel was then recovered from the van. Therefore, I"
"conclude that the prosecution had failed to prove the exclusive possession"
"and  chain  of  custody  of  the  productions  in  this  case  beyond  a  reasonable"
"doubt. The learned High Court Judge had failed to consider these matters"
"which are substantial enough to vitiate the conviction in this case. Hence, I"
"find that this ground too has merit."
"In  the  3rd  and  4th  grounds  of  appeal,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  had"
"contended that the learned High Court Judge had rejected the evidence of"
"the defence on unreasonable grounds."
"The learned President’s Counsel citing the following portion of the judgement"
"at page 592 of the brief, contended that the learned High Court Judge before"
"analysing and considering the defence case had come to the conclusion that"
"the prosecution had proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt."
