"According to PW1, the police team had used two private vehicles for this raid."
"The  car  in  which  PW1  and  PW4  travelled  was  driven  by  PW9.  The  three-"
"wheeler in which PW2 and PW5 travelled was driven by PW6."
"The  police  team  had  left  the  Borella  Police  Station  at  14:40  hours  and"
"reached Mihindu Mawatha in Mount Lavinia which was located on the left"
"side of the Colombo-Galle main road, from their direction of arrival. At about"
"15:30 hours a van bearing No.253-3358 stopped on the main road to turn to"
"Mihindu Mawatha. Upon observing this, PW1 instructed the officers in the"
"three-wheeler to block the van as soon as it entered Mihindu Mawatha. PW4"
"stepped out of the car to stop the van when it approached the three-wheeler,"
"but it drove through a gap that was there in front of it. Then PW1 and PW4"
"had  proceeded  to  shoot  at  the  van,  but  it  had  continued  moving  forward"
"without stopping. PW1 and PW4 had got into the car and followed the van."
"About 150 meters from the place of incident, there was a four-way junction"
"and due to another car, which entered the road obstructing the van, the van"
"slowed down. At that time, PW1 had seen a parcel being thrown out of the"
"van to a plot of land on the right side of the road. Then a person on the land"
"had picked up the parcel and he had thrown it back at the van which had"
"missed and had landed on the road instead. Then PW1 had directed PW4 to"
"collect the parcel and PW1 had chased behind the van with PW9. Another 1"
"km down the road, the van was overtaken and the Appellant was arrested"
"and was taken  to  the four-way junction. At the junction PW4 had handed"
"over a plastic bag which contained 06 bags of Heroin."
"Further investigation was conducted and a statement was recorded from the"
"wife of the Appellant at his residence. PW1 had then gone to the Dehiwala"
"Police Station upon a message received to the effect that a Heroin parcel and"
"a scale had been discovered at the place of the shooting. After that the team"
"had come to the Borella Police Station  and a search was done in the van."
"According to PW1, another parcel was found concealed in a small chamber"
