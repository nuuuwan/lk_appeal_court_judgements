"2020, Aluwihare, P.C., J, has stated as follows;"
"“As far as the mental element is concerned, I am of the"
"view  that  the  offence  or  [drug]  trafficking  is  similar  to"
"possession,  since  it  requires  to  be  established  that  the"
"perpetrator  knowingly  possessed  or  had  control  over  a"
"dangerous  drug.  Thus,  one  cannot  engage 
in  drug"
"trafficking  while  being  unaware  that  he  or  she 
is 
in"
"possession  of  a  drug,  or  if  he  or  she  reasonably  but"
"mistakenly  believes 
that 
the  substance 
is 
legal.  The"
"offence of drug trafficking, however, also requires that the"
"prosecution establish that the perpetrator was involved in"
"the 
selling, 
procuring, 
storing, 
administering,"
"transporting,  delivering  or  distributing  of  such  drugs,  or"
"had offered to do anything referred to above [Definition of"
"the  term “traffic”  in  section  54 A  of  the Ordinance].  It  is"
"this additional requirement [of an act] that transforms the"
"status of the offence [of possession] to trafficking."
