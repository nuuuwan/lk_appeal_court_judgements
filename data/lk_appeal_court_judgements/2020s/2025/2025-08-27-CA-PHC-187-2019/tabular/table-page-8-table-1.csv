"In the above case, the owner of the vehicle was a businessman, and the accused person"
"was working as a driver for the past few years and had never been engaged in any legal"
"activity.  Hence,  Karunarathna  J.  observed  that  the  owner  had  no  reason  to  suspect  the"
"accused driver."
"In  Hettiarachchige  Chathurika  Maduwanthi  v.  The  Officer-in-Charge,  Police  Station,"
"Tissamaharama and Others7 and Udugama Gamage Yasas Chamindha v. Attorney General"
"and  Others8His 
lordship  Justice  Kumararatnam  has  taken  the  position  that  the  court"
"should  have  considered  the  facts  that  the  vehicle  has  not  been  used  for  any 
illegal"
"activities by the driver for the past years, the driver was not a habitual offender and the"
"relationship between the driver and the owner."
"Considering the position illustrated by the decisions referred to above, it appears that we"
"are  moving  away  from  the  position  “The 
judiciary  has  to  only  discern  whether  the"
"claimant, being the owner of the vehicle, had taken all precautions to prevent the use of"
"the vehicle for the commission of the offence. This entails positive actions on the part of"
"the  owner  and  not  claiming  mere  ignorance”  as  stated  in  Rajapakse  Dewage  Asanga"
"Kumara Chandrasena v. Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Katugasthota and another.9"
"Although, as per Section 40(1), a positive action  on the part of  the  owner is  necessary,"
"what  action  of  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  will  suffice  to  constitute  “all  precautions”"
"envisaged  in  Section  40(1)  of  the  act  would  necessarily  depend  on  the  circumstances"
"under which the vehicle was given to another party. However, I am unable to agree with"
"the Counsel for the appellant that the precautionary action that would need to be taken"
"should depend on the owner’s ability. If the person allows his/her vehicle to be used by"
"someone  else,  that person should have the capacity to  take “all precautions” necessary"
"under the circumstances."
"In the instant case, the Appellant, under cross-examination, has admitted that because of"
"her situation, she had no ability to monitor or exercise control over the accused driver's"
"usage of the vehicle. This admission is fatal to her application as it establishes that she has"
"not  been  able  to  discharge 
the  burden  cast  upon  a  vehicle  owner  by 
the  Forest"
"Ordinance."
