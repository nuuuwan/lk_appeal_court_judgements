"Case No. 2487/21 was instituted on 08th of December 2021. Although summons were issued"
"for  the  accused  to  appear  in  court  on  08th  March  2022,  the  accused  failed  to  attend.  The"
"accused eventually appeared in court on the 25th of January 2023. On 22nd of February 2023,"
"the accused appeared once more, pleaded guilty, and the case was brought to a conclusion."
"C
ase  No.  2492/21  was  filed  on  the  19th  of  March  2021,  and  summons  were  issued  for  the"
"accused to appear in court on the 03rd of June 2021. However, the accused failed to appear."
"Notices were subsequently issued to the sureties. On 26th of January 2022, it was undertaken"
"by  the  Petitioner  that  the  accused  would  be  produced  before  the  court  on  the  29th  of  April"
"2022. On that date, however, only the Petitioner, appeared in court, but the accused was not"
"produced.  On  the  14th  of  September  2022,  the  accused  was  again  not  presented,  though  all"
"three sureties, including the Petitioner, appeared in court. The case was then postponed to 08th"
"of November 2022. On that date, the accused was still not presented. As a result, the case was"
"scheduled for 05th of January 2023. On this date as well, the accused failed to appear, which"
"lead to the forfeiture of the surety’s bail."
"A
s  for  the  circumstances  set  out  above,  they  raise  two  fundamental  issues,  that  require"
"determination  by  this  court.  These  issues  are  pivotal  to  the  resolution  of  the  matter  at  hand"
"and must be addressed to ensure a just outcome. Accordingly, the court must consider:"
"1.  Whether it is illegal or unlawful to confiscate the bail under the given circumstances?"
"2.  Whether the quantum of confiscation is unjustifiable or not?"
"W
hen  addressing  the  first  issue  as  for  the  bail  bond  entered  on  02nd  of  December  2020,"
"though  undertaken to  produce the suspect  in  Magistrates’ Court on the 17th of March 2021,"
"the Petitioner has failed to comply with that and has not produced the suspect in court until"
"the 25th of January 2023, which is a clear violation of her own undertaking. In addition, as for"
"the  format  of  the  surety  bond  under  the  Administration  of  Justice  Law  which  has  been"
"continued to be used up to this date, the surety guarantees that the accused will attend court on"
"the appointed date and will keep on appearing until the court directs otherwise. If the accused"
"fails to do this, the surety agrees to pay the specified amount to the Republic of Sri Lanka."
"F
urthermore, by signing the said  bond the surety  asserts  and confirms  that  he has sufficient"
"funds and assets to comply with that undertaking if such necessity arises. Therefore, the last"
"two alleged exceptional circumstances need not be considered any further."
