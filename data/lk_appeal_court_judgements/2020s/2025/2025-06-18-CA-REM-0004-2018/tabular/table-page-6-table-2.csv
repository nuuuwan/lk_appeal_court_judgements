"of Singapore held as follows:",""
"P","aragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 78 of that judgment are as follows:"
"","3.  The right to arrest and the risk of a vessel being  arrested are  normal"
"","incidents  arising  from  the  operation  and  management  of  any  vessel."
"","Typically, parties dealing with vessels do not transact directly with the"
"","registered owner of the vessel but with managers and/or agents of the"
"","vessels,  which  may  vary  from  port  to  port.  In  the  case  of  bareboat"
"","charters,  this  is  almost  invariably  the  case  because  the  effect  and"
"","essence  of  any  bareboat  charter  is  to  grant  the  bareboat  charterer"
"","complete  control  and  possession  of  the  vessel.  Given  that  there  is  no"
"","public  registry  of  bareboat  charters  available 
for 
inspection,  third"
"","parties dealing with bareboat charterers have no way of finding out if"
"","the vessel is on bareboat charter and may well assume that they are in"
"","fact dealing with the owners of the vessel."
"","4.  This point assumes critical significance when one considers that, until"
"","the 1980s, vessels on bareboat charter were insulated from arrest for"
"","most  claims  save  for  a  limited  class  of  maritime  liens.  Thus,  third"
"","parties could not arrest a vessel to satisfy debts owed to them by the"
"","bareboat  charterers.  This  placed  third  parties  who  transacted  with"
"","bareboat  charterers  at  a  significant  disadvantage, 
for 
they  could,"
"","unbeknownst  to  them,  be  left  without  security  for  their  claims.  In"
"","recent  decades,  many  common  law  jurisdictions  such  as  the  United"
"","Kingdom,  Hong  Kong,  Australia,  Malaysia,  Canada,  and  New  Zealand"
"","have amended their laws to permit the arrest of the bareboat chartered"
"","vessel if, at the time the action is brought, the vessel still remains on"
"","bareboat  charter  to  the  party  liable in  personam.  The  laws  in  these"
"","jurisdictions  are  largely  uniform  save  for  that  of  New  Zealand,  which"
"","permits  not  only  the  arrest  of  the  specific  bareboat  chartered  vessel"
"","implicated  in  the  cause  of  action  but  also  the  arrest  of  any  other"
