"Contracts.    This  point  was  also  dealt  with  in  the  case  of  “Chem  Orchid”"
"(Supra) as follows:"
"42     The  admiralty  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  is  conferred  by"
"statute and exists where the requisite statutory conditions have"
"been satisfied; it cannot be conferred by the agreement or waiver"
"of the parties if it does not exist under the HCAJA (see The “Ohm"
"Mariana” 
ex 
“Peony” [1992]  1  SLR(R)  556  at [15]  and The"
"“Alexandrea” [2002]  1  SLR(R)  812  at  [10]–[11]).  Similarly,  the"
"admiralty jurisdiction of this court exists in this case only if the"
"requisite  statutory  conditions  have  been  satisfied  (i.e.,  if  Sejin"
"was  the  demise  charterer  at  the  time  the  writs  were  brought)."
"HKC’s submission that the doctrine of privity of contract would"
"preclude  the  plaintiffs  from  challenging  the  termination,  with"
"respect,  misses  the  point.  The  issue  here  is  one  of  jurisdiction"
"and not one of contract. The plaintiffs were not seeking, as non-"
"parties,  to  sue  on  the  Lease  Agreement 
(which 
is  a  purely"
"contractual  point).  Rather,  they  were  seeking  to  show  that  the"
"court  has 
jurisdiction 
in 
this  matter  because 
the 
Lease"
"Agreement  was  still  valid  when  the in  rem writs  were  issued  –"
"that 
is  a 
jurisdictional 
issue.  I  agree  that 
it 
is  open  to  the"
"plaintiffs  to  challenge  the  validity  of  the  termination  so  as  to"
"establish 
jurisdiction 
in 
aid 
of 
the 
enforcement 
of 
their"
"respective  claims,  notwithstanding  Sejin’s  apparent  acceptance"
"of the termination."
