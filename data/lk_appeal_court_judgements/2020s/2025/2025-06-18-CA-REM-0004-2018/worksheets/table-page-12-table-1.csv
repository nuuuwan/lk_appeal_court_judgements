"For the reasons set out above, and in terms of the provisions of section 3 (4)"
"(b), the 2nd defendant being the owner of the 1st defendant ship, I hold that"
"the decision of the Learned High Court Judge that, the 2nd defendant is the"
"person who would be liable in the claim in the action in personam is correct,"
"although  the  plaintiff  has  not  directly  dealt  with  the  2nd  defendant.  As  per"
"the  provisions  of  the  Admiralty  Jurisdiction  Act  No.40  of  1983,  the  2nd"
"defendant comes within the meaning of ‘relevant person’. The appeal of the"
"2nd defendant is dismissed."
