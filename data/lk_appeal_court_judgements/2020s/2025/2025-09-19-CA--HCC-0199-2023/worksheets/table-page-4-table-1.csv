"","“Experience has shown that children may not speak out about something that has"
"","happened to them for a number of reasons. A child may"
"","be confused about what has happened or about whether or not to speak out;"
"","blame him/herself for what has happened or be afraid that he/she will be blamed"
"","for it and punished;"
"","be  afraid  of  the  consequences  of  speaking  about it,  either for  him/herself  and/or"
"","for another member of the family;"
"","may feel that s/he may not be believed;"
"","may have been told to say nothing and threatened with the consequences of doing"
"","so;"
"","may  be  embarrassed  because  s/he  did  not  appreciate  at  the  time  that  what  was"
"","happening  was  wrong,  or  because  s/he  enjoyed  some  of 
the  aspects  of 
the"
"","attention they were getting;"
"","simply blank what happened out and get on with their lives until the point comes"
"","when they feel ready or the need to speak out {e.g. for the sake of a younger child"
"","who s/he feels may be at risk};"
"","may feel conflicted: loving the abuser but hating the abuse.”"
