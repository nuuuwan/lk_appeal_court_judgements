"CA/HCC/0199/2023"
"31. The  learned  Trial  Judge  has  convicted  the  appellant  only  on  two  counts,  namely,"
"count  1  and  count  2.  During 
the  cross-examination  of 
the  prosecutrix,  several"
"contradictions were marked by the counsel for the appellant."
"32. The Court’s attention was also drawn to certain omissions  in the statement  made  by"
"the prosecutrix to the police. As stated elsewhere  in this  judgment, the credibility of"
"the  victim’s  testimony  must  be  assessed  in  the  context of  her  age  at the  time  of  the"
"alleged offence, her age when the police statement was recorded, and the lapse of time"
"between  the  incident  and  the  trial.  It  would  therefore  be  unrealistic  to  expect  her  to"
"recount 
the  ordeal  with  photographic  precision,  and  any  discrepancies 
in  her"
"testimony must be evaluated against these circumstances."
"33. It is also important to note that the prosecutrix never admitted to the existence of any"
"of the contradictions marked by the defence, nor did she admit to any of the omissions"
"highlighted  during  cross-examination.  Moreover, the  defence  did  not  call  any  police"
"officer  to  prove  the  said  contradictions.  Consequently,  those  contradictions  remain"
"unproved."
"34. The other point to be emphasized  is that the said contradictions, even  if established,"
"cannot be considered  material  so as to affect the core of the prosecution case or cast"
"doubt on the victim’s testimony. The contradiction  marked D1 related to the  manner"
"in which the victim was taken to the nearby cinnamon field, whether she was dragged,"
"as  stated  in  the  police  statement, or  simply  accompanied  by  the  appellant.  The  next"
"contradiction concerned the attire of the appellant at the time of the offence, whether"
"he  was  wearing  a  sarong  or  trousers.  These  contradictions,  however,  are  immaterial"
"and do not undermine the credibility of the victim’s testimony, particularly in view of"
"the lapse of time between the date of the offence, the recording of the statement, and"
"the giving of evidence."
"35. Similarly,  the  omissions,  namely,  the  victim’s  failure  to  mention  the  2nd  and  3rd"
"incidents  of  rape  in  her  police  statement,  do  not,  in  my  view,  adversely  affect  the"
"credibility  of  her  testimony,  particularly  as  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not"
"convicted  the  appellant on  the  charges  relating  to those  incidents.  Another  omission"
"brought to the attention of the Court was that the victim  had not stated in her police"
"statement  that  she  first  disclosed  the  alleged  offence  to  her  mother.  For  the  reasons"
