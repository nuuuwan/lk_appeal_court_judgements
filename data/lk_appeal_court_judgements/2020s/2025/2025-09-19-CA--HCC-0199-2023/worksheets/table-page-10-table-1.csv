"already  discussed,  I  do  not  regard 
this  omission  as  significant 
in  assessing 
the"
"credibility of the victim’s testimony."
"36. Accordingly, 
the  said  contradictions  and  omissions, 
taken  either 
individually  or"
"collectively, do not cast any doubt on the reliability of the victim’s evidence."
"37. As  held  in  Sumith  Kumara  Vs.Attorney  General  [2012]  2  Sri.LR  311    Overdue"
"importance cannot be given to minor discrepancies. Discrepancies which do not go to"
"the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witness, therefore cannot be"
"attached with undue importance."
"38. In Miller vs Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All.E R 372, Lord Denning  summarized"
"the  requirements  of  standard  of  proof  to  convict  the  accused  in  a  criminal  case  as"
"follows:"
"It  need  not  reach  certainty,  but  it  must  carry  a  high  degree  of  probability."
"Proof  beyond  reasonable  doubt  does  not  mean  proof  beyond  a  shadow  of"
"doubt.  The  law  would  fail  to  protect  the  community  if  it  permits  fanciful"
"possibilities to deflect the course of justice."
"39. The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has,  in  his  judgment,  duly  considered  the  issues  of"
"delay  in  lodging  the  complaint,  as  well  as  the  contradictions  and  omissions,  while"
"giving due weight to the age of the victim at the time of the offence. Thus, in light of"
"the  established  legal  principles  and  the  strength  of  the  evidence,  I  see  no  ground  to"
"disturb the findings of the learned High Court Judge."
"40. In  his  dock  statement,  the  appellant  alleged  that  Chamith  Madhushanka  had  broken"
"open the door of his house, assaulted his wife with a knife, and that a complaint was"
"made to the Uragaha Police  in that regard. He further stated that he had been  falsely"
"implicated  in  another  case  by  the  victim.  It  is,  however,  significant  that  in  his  dock"
"statement the appellant did not deny any of the charges levelled against him."
"41.  Moreover,  during 
the  trial,  none  of 
these 
incidents  were  even  suggested  to  the"
"prosecution  witnesses,  nor  was  any  evidence  led  by  the  defence  to  corroborate  the"
"appellant’s version. The dock statement, therefore, does not create any doubt as to the"
"prosecution  case.  Accordingly,  even  if  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to"
