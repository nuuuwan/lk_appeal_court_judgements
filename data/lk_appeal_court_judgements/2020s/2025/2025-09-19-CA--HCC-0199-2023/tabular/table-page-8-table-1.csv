"25. Furthermore, the conduct of the victim does not suggest that she  intended to lodge a"
"complaint  with  the  police  against  the  appellant  or  have  him  arrested.  Rather,  she"
"casually  narrated  her  ordeal 
to  a  probation  officer,  and 
it  was 
that  officer  who"
"informed the police, which in turn led to the investigation of the crimes."
"26. The  defence  has  neither 
raised  nor  established  any  significant  contradiction  or"
"omission.  Considering  the  totality  of  the  evidence  and  the  circumstances  discussed"
"above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  it  is  safe  to  accept  and  act  upon  the  testimony  of  the"
"prosecutrix, as rightly done by the learned Trial Judge."
"27. In Dharmasiri v. Republic of Sri Lanka (CA 019/2008): The Court emphasized that"
"the belatedness of a witness's statement does not alone discredit their testimony. The"
"court  must  inquire  into  the  reason  for  the  delay  and,  if  the  reason  is  plausible  and"
"justifiable, the evidence can be acted upon."
"28. Ajith Samarakoon v. The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case): The Court held that"
"the  belatedness  of  a  witness's  statement  does  not  entitle 
the  court  to  reject 
the"
"testimony  solely  on  that  ground.  The  court  must  consider  the  reasons  for  the  delay,"
"and if they are justifiable, the evidence can be accepted."
"29. The second witness who testified for the prosecution was T. Somalatha, the mother of"
"the  prosecutrix.  According  to  her  evidence,  she  was  unaware  of  any  of  the  alleged"
"offences  committed  against  PW1  until  a  probation  officer  informed  her.  She  further"
"stated that, as the prosecutrix had been assaulted by Chamith, she handed her over to"
"the  probation  authorities.  Somalatha’s  evidence  clearly  indicates  that  she  is  illiterate"
"and  had  not reported the  matter to the police, even when the prosecutrix  had  eloped"
"with  Chamith.  She  approached  the  Probation  Office  only  after 
learning 
that  the"
"prosecutrix had been ill-treated by Chamith."
"30. A careful examination of the testimony of PW2 reveals that she too did not treat the"
"ordeal  suffered  by  PW1  with  due  seriousness,  as  she  wished  to  ensure  that  the"
"appellant’s  family,  particularly  his 
two  children,  would  not  become  destitute  by"
"disclosing these incidents to the police."
