JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Appellant’), along with another,

was indicted before the High Court of Kurunagala on the count of committing the offence

of murder of one Rajamuni Dewayalage Pini, on or about 24th December 1995, punishable

under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The prosecution led the evidence through nine witnesses, and marked productions from

P1 to P4 and thereafter closed its case. After the conclusion of the prosecution's case, both

accused, in their defence, made a dock statement.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court delivered judgment on

26 April 2018. The Appellant was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to death. The

2nd Accused was acquitted.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Accused had preferred an appeal

to this court and submitted the following grounds of appeal:

Page 3 of 10

1. Whether the learned trail judge erred in law by failing to act in terms of Section

196 of Code of Criminal Procedure?

2. Whether the learned trial Judge has failed to consider the contradictory positions

taken up by the PW 02 and PW 04 with regard to the Identification of the Appellant

in the Identification Parade?

3. Whether the learned trial Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

contradictions and omissions marked by the defense, which go to the root of the

case?

4. Whether the learned trial Judge failed to apply the test of probability and

improbability in respect of the evidence of the Prosecution Witnesses No. 1, 4 and

11 whose evidence was unworthy of credit?

5. Whether the learned trial Judge failed to apply the test of probability and

improbability in respect of the evidence of the investigating officers, whose

evidence was unworthy of credit?

6. Whether the learned trial Judge failed to consider the dock statement made by

the Accused-Appellant?

7. Whether the learned trial Judge failed to consider to the credibility of the

prosecution witness no.4 who was the sole eyewitness, since also the learned State

Counsel for the prosecution mentioned some issues regarding to PW-04 in his oral

submission.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW 4, Surangika Sandamali, the granddaughter of the deceased, the only eyewitness of

this case, stated that she was 7 years old at the time of the incident, and the date was

24th December 1995. She stated that she was with the deceased at the shop near her

house, named Welekade, at the time of the incident. She stated that the incident occurred

between 7.00 and 8.00 in the morning and that the distance from the house to the house

was about 25 feet. She states that at that time, her father and her father's younger brother

had gone to the Gokarella police station to file a complaint regarding the shop being

broken into at night.

The witness said that the deceased had come from the shop and had come out of the shop

to go to the main house, asking to speak to her if anyone came, and that at that time a

motorbike was stopped. She states that the deceased, who had gone to the upper main

house, had stopped it and returned to the small gap between the shop and the main road.

Page 4 of 10

She has stated that at that time she recognized the people who had come on that

motorbike, and that she had seen them coming to the shop regularly before that, and had

seen them talking to the deceased before. The witness has stated that the deceased called

them Jayasuriya and Sunil, and that they are known by that name.

She has stated that a person who stopped the motorcycle on the side of the road and took

a knife that was in front of it, and she cannot remember who took it, but both had two

knives in their hand. A the trial, we note that this witness cannot identify who was in the

front seat and back seat.

It should be noted that she has identified the 1st accused at the identification parade.

While standing outside, the deceased has uttered මාව මරන්න එපා පුතේ. She has stated that

after that, a person named Appellant stabbed the deceased.

ප්‍ර : ේද ඇන්කන්?

උ : ජෙසුරිෙ කිෙන එක්ක නො.

Even at that time, she had not identified which accused was Jayasuriya.

She further stated that the deceased's hands were cut while she was holding the knife.

Accused then stabbed her neck, chest and face. She stated that when Appellant stabbed

the deceased, the other person came to stab her with the knife.

At that moment, Jayasuriya remarked, “කපොඩි කපොඩි අෙ කනකම්, කලොකු අෙකගන් පළි ගන්න” (“Do

not take revenge on small people, but on the big ones”), and both proceeded towards the

main house. The witness then shouted, at which point the deceased collapsed on the

ground near a sandy area. She further stated that she, too, shouted at the scene. After

some time, her cousin arrived.

The witness affirmed that she was unaware of any prior enmity between the deceased

and the individual who stabbed her. She confirmed that she had identified both accused

during the identification parade, naming Jayasuriya as the first accused and Sunil as the

second. Additionally, she stated that she was not aware of any disputes between the

accused and her family.

During the cross‑examination, the witness stated that the second accused placed a knife

to her neck. The defence then suggested that this detail was not recorded in her police

statement. The witness further stated that she had identified two individuals in the

identification parade, but not by name. In the parade, she identified the first accused and

another suspect. It was proposed by the defence that the witness did not identify the

second accused even during the inquest proceedings. When questioned as to why she

failed to identify the second accused, the witness explained that she did not know the

identification parade was being conducted in relation to the death of the deceased.

Upon perusal of the parade notes, it is recorded that counsel for the accused argued there

was no necessity to conduct an identification parade since both the accused and the

witnesses were from the same village. Nevertheless, the Acting Magistrate proceeded

with the parade, in which six suspects participated. When questioned by the Magistrate

as to the purpose of her presence, the witness stated that she was there to identify the

persons responsible for the death of the deceased and her uncle. In the course of the

parade, she identified Jayasuriya, the appellant, as the person who stabbed the deceased.

It is noted that she identified another suspect other than the appellant and failed to

identify the second accused during the identification parade.

It should be noted that both accused were known by name.

During further cross‑examination, the witness stated that the appellant cut the neck of

the deceased. It was then recorded as an omission that the witness had previously

described how the appellant stabbed the deceased.

The witness stated that after the appellant stabbed the deceased, she went and hid herself

behind the door. She consistently maintained that the deceased fell to the ground and was

bleeding. However, it was noted that during cross‑examination, she gave a different

version, stating that she did not know the individuals who stabbed the deceased by name,

although in her earlier testimony, she had stated that she knew them by name.

PW 01, Susil Premaratne, the father of PW 4 and son of the deceased, testified that his

younger brother died on 24 December 1995. He stated that a few days earlier, on 20

December 1995, there had been a robbery at their boutique. During that incident, while

he was inside the shop, he recognized Jayasuriya, Wimalasuriya, Gamini, Priyantha,

Sunil, and Weerasinghe as the persons who broke into the premises. Since the suspects

had not been arrested by 24 December 1995, his younger sister and his younger brother

went to the police station to lodge a complaint. At that time, the suspects appeared and

stabbed his younger brother, causing his death. He further stated that the second accused

also attempted to stab him during the same incident. Later, at the Kurunegala police

station, he got to know that his mother had also passed away. At that moment, he stated

that this was when he became aware of the deceased’s death.

During cross‑examination, the defence suggested that no case had been filed against the

suspects because they had not committed the robbery. In response, the witness firmly

stated that he had personally seen the robbery taking place and further witnessed these

suspects murdering his younger brother. The defence further suggested that the witness

had coached PW‑04 to give evidence in accordance with his own version of events. The

witness categorically rejected this suggestion.

PW 11, Rajamuni Dewayalage Somawathi, the sister of the deceased, testified that she

saw the dead body of her sister (deceased) lying in front of the shop, fallen on the sand.

Dr Keerthi Kularatne Weerakkodige, the Judicial Medical Officer, testified that upon

examination, he observed a total of 14 injuries, including 3 stab wounds. He further stated

that there were injuries on the hands which appeared to be defensive wounds, sustained

while attempting to ward off the attack. The witness confirmed that injury No. 14 was

fatal. When the prosecution produced a knife before him, he stated that injuries of the

type observed on the deceased could have been caused by such a weapon.

PW 21, Lalith Chandra Kumara, Sub Inspector, stated that he accompanied the

Magistrate to the scene of the incident and observed the dead body of the deceased lying

behind the shop. He further testified that on 26 December 1994, the Appellant, along with

Page 8 of 10

another suspect, surrendered to the police. A statement was then recorded from the

appellant. The witness emphasized that he did not threaten the appellant at any point.

Based on the information provided in the appellant’s statement, the witness recovered a

knife from Priyantha’s room.

When we analyze the evidence of PW 4, who is the only eyewitness in the case, we observe

clear contradictions in her testimony. At the beginning, she stated that she identified both

the appellant and the second accused as Jayasuriya and Sunil. However, later in her

testimony, she changed her position, claiming that although she identified them as the

persons who stabbed the deceased, she did not know their names. Furthermore, she

asserted that she had identified both the appellant and the second accused during the

identification parade. Yet, the parade notes reveal that she had in fact identified only the

appellant, and not the second accused.

These inconsistencies between naming the assailants, later denying knowledge of their

names, and claiming to have identified both in the parade when only one was actually

identified create serious doubt regarding the reliability and consistency of the witness’s

evidence. As the sole eyewitness, such contradictions materially weaken the credibility of

her testimony. I am mindful of the following judgements.

1974 (1) SCR 489, Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade v. Maharashtra (Krishna Iyer,J)

“In our view there is only one eye-witness, P.W. 5, Vilas. Even if the case against the

accused hangs on the evidence of a single eye-,witness it may be enough to sustain the,

conviction given sterling testimony of a competent, honest man, although as a rule of

prudence courts call for corroboration. It is a platitude to say that witnesses have to be

weighed and not counted since quality matters more than quantity in human affairs. We

are persuaded that the PW 5 is a witness for truth but in view of the circumstances that

he is interested, we would still want corroboration in this case to reassure ourselves. And

that we have in this case.”

1999 (3) SLR 137 Sumanasena v. Attorney General, Jayasuriya.J held

“In our law of evidence the salutary principle is enunciated that evidence must not be

counted, but weighed and the evidence of a single solitary witness if cogent and impressive

could be acted upon by a Court of law. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance sets out that

"no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact'.

In an Indian case the conviction for murder was affirmed on the mere circumstantial

Page 9 of 10

evidence given by a solitary witness and a pointed reference was made to the principle

which we have adumbrated above vide Mulluwa v. The State of Maddhya Pradesh.

Testimony must always be weighed and not counted and these principles have been

followed by Justice G. P. A. De Silva in Walimunige John v. State; King v. N. A, Fernando(.

Thus, the Court could have acted on the evidence of the solitary witness Nandasena

provided the trial Judge was convinced that he was giving cogent, inspiring and truthful

testimony in Court.”

In light of the above legal authority, I now address the evidence introduced at trial.

Upon examining the identification parade notes, it is observed that Prosecution Witness

No. 4 (PW4) identified the appellant as the individual who stabbed the deceased. In

addition, she pointed out another suspect, though notably, this was not the second accused.

However, during her testimony before the court, PW4 stated that at the time of the

incident she recognized both assailants by name, specifically Jayasuriya and Sunil, as the

persons who attacked the deceased. Yet, under cross-examination, her version shifted: she

asserted that she had identified both the appellant and the second accused as the

perpetrators of the stabbing, but clarified that she did not know them by their names.

This shifting narrative, first identifying only the appellant, then claiming to have

identified both the appellant and the second accused without knowing their names,

demonstrates that PW4’s evidence is not consistent and raises doubts about the reliability

of her identification.

We observe that although the 2nd Accused was present at the identification parade, the

witness failed to identify him. No explanation has been provided as to why she could not

recognize the 2nd Accused at that stage. Furthermore, during the trial, she did not

disclose who was riding the motorcycle and who was seated behind. She also stated that

both accused were frequent visitors to the shop and were known to her by name. If that is

the case, her inability to identify the 2nd accused at the parade raises serious doubt as to

whether she was truly present at the time of the incident. The failure to identify a person

already known to her creates a reasonable doubt regarding the credibility of her testimony.

We emphasize that identification is a matter that must remain firm and unshaken. It has

created a doubt whether she has properly identified the 1st accused who stabbed the

deceased. We are also mindful that her statement was recorded later.

I am mindful of the dictum expressed by the burden of proof

Page 10 of 10

Upon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution has failed to establish, beyond a

reasonable doubt, that the Appellant committed the murder of Rajamuni Dewayalage Pini.

In light of the foregoing, the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge dated 26 April 2018 are hereby set aside. The accused is acquitted of the

charge on which he was convicted.

Appeal Allowed.
