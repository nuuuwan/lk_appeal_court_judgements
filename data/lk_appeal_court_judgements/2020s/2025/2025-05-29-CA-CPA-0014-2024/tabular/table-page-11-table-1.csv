"21. The appropriate course of action in response to the observation mentioned"
"above is to file an application under section 24 of the CIABOC Act. Such"
"application should take the form of a writ in the Supreme Court, seeking"
"to quash the directive issued by the Commission to institute proceedings"
"in the High Court."
"22.  Be that as it may, it appears that the Learned High Court Judge has been"
"guided  by  the  judgment  in  Anoma  S.  Polwatte  (supra)  where  it  was"
"determined that a direction to institute proceedings under the Bribery Act"
"or The Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975 is a function"
"of the Commission, and such function shall be exercised collectively by the"
"Commission."
"23.  Upon  consideration  of  the  relevant  legal  framework,  the  Learned  High"
"Court Judge has concluded that investigating allegations communicated"
"to the Commission is also a function of the Commission as defined under"
"Section 3 of the CIABOC Act. Consequently, the Learned High Court Judge"
"has determined that the indictment should be dismissed, citing that the"
"Commission  has  not  collectively  conducted  the  investigation  into  the"
"allegations pertinent to the offences specified in the indictment."
