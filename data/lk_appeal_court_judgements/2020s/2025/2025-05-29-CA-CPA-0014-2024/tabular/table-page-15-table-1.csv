"High Court Judge was correct in extending the principle laid down by the"
"Supreme Court in the judgment of Anoma S. Polwatte (supra) to dismiss"
"the indictment."
"31. If one takes the face value of section 3 of the CIABOC Act, it can be argued"
"that  investigation  of  allegations  communicated  to  it  and  institution  of"
"proceedings  are  functions  designated  to  the  Commission  and  should  be"
"exercised collectively."
"32. However, when one goes through the other sections of the CIABOC Act is"
"clear that the intention of the legislature on formulating the provisions in"
"the Act had not been that."
"33. Section  3  of  the  CIABOC  Act  begins  with  the  phrase  “The  commission"
"shall,  subject  to  the  other  provisions  of  this  Act…”.  The  wording"
"indicates that section 3 must be understood in the context of the CIABOC"
"Act as a whole. It emphasizes the necessity of interpreting its stipulations"
"in  relation  to  the  various  other  provisions  outlined  in  the  CIABOC  Act,"
"particularly concerning the investigation of allegations communicated to it"
"and the institution of legal proceedings."
