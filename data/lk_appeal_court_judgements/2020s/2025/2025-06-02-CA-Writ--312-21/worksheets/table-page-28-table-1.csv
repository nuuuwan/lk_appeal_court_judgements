"Chaturvedi3 states thus,"
"“In order to constitute abandonment or waiver, it must be a voluntary act on the"
"part of the person possessing the rights. Acquiescence or standing by when there"
"is a duty to speak or assert a right creates an estoppel. In such cases knowledge"
"of the act must be brought by the acquiescing party. Acquiescence does not mean"
"simply  an  intelligent  consent,  but  may  be  implied  if  a  person  is  content  not  to"
"oppose irregular acts which he knows are being done.”"
