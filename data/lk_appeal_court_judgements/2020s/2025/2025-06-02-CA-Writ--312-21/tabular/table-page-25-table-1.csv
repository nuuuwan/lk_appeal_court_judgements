"of the right to be heard as the inquiry proceeded ex parte. In the case of B. Surinder"
"Singh Kanda v The Government of the Federation of Malaya,2 Lord Denning held that,"
"“If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry"
"with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He"
"must know what  evidence has been given and what  statements  have been made"
"affecting him: and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict"
"them.”"
"Considering the above, this Court is of the view that the tribunal had failed to follow"
"the  procedure  laid  down  in  the  Code  by  not  warning  the  Petitioner  of  the  ex  parte"
"hearing  and thereby  causing  a failure of justice  as he was denied the opportunity to"
"know the evidence presented against him and to challenge it."
"The Petitioner argues that the evidence recorded is not in line with the period mentioned"
"in the charge sheet marked as P39. The Petitioner states that the 1st witness, Suvedda"
"Piratheepan, had studied under the Petitioner in her second year in 2011. Even though"
"the 1st witness was admitted to the University in 2007, she rejoined in the year 2010"
"after  ending  the  civil  war  that  prevailed  in  the  country,  and  according  to  the  sworn"
"translation of the inquiry proceedings (CA-2), the witness has admitted that she studied"
"the subject taught by the Petitioner in 2011. The 3rd witness, Ms. Thevakumaran Janani"
"had admitted to the University for the academic year 2010/2011 and had studied under"
