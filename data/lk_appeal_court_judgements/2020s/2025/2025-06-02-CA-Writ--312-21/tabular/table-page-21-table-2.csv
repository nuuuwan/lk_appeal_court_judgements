"Citing  the  last  sentence  of  paragraph  11.5,  the  Petitioner  argues  that  his  objections"
"marked as P50 were not recorded in the inquiry proceedings marked as P47A-III and"
"the  tribunal  stated  that  a  ruling  will  be  given  after  the  inquiry.  In  this  regard,  the"
"Respondents argue that all the objections were recorded and considered by the inquiry"
"tribunal. When reading paragraph 11.5 as a whole, it is clear that when any objection is"
"raised  before  the  inquiry  tribunal,  the  decision  of  the  tribunal  with  regard  to  such"
"objection shall be final, and such decision can be taken with the view of completing the"
"inquiry on time without any hindrance from such objections. The Petitioner himself has"
"stated  the  fact  that  the  inquiry  panel  has  stated  that  a  ruling  would  be  given  on  the"
"conclusion  of  the  inquiry.  Paragraph  11.5  does  not  imply  that  when  an  objection  is"
"raised, it should be provided a ruling at the time it is raised. Therefore, considering the"
"above facts, this Court cannot agree with the argument of the Petitioner that the inquiry"
"tribunal has violated paragraph 11.5 of the Code."
