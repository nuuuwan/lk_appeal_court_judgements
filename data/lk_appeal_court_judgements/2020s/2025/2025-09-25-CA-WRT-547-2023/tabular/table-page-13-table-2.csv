"“In view of the authorities cited above, I hold that the Petitioner’s claim cannot be"
"suitably  decided  in  a  Writ  application.  Furthermore,  prerogative  writs  will  not"
"issue  where  there  are  adequate,  convenient  and  effective  remedies  available  to"
"determine the rights of parties granted where the Petitioner has another adequate"
"and specific legal remedy in the District Court competent to afford relief upon the"
"same subject matter.”"
