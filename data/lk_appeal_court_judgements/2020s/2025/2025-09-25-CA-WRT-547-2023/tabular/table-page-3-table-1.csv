"possession  of  that  lot  before  the  Grant  marked  as  P1  was  issued.  The  father  had"
"abandoned the possession of the land due to the Civil War prevailing in those areas at"
"that time. When the Petitioners’ father returned to the area on or around 1996, the 4th"

"though the mother of the 4th and 5th Respondents has been issued with the Grant marked"
"as P23 for Lot 2311 in 1991, the Petitioners’ fathers’ Grant P1 was issued in 1993 for"
"Lot 2297. Petitioners state that their father had possessed Lot 2311 until he died in 2003"
"due to a vehicle accident, and the mother also died in the same accident thereafter, as"
"the eldest son, the 2nd Petitioner came into possession of that lot."
"After  the  death  of  the  father,  the  2nd  Petitioner  repeatedly  requested  the  relevant"
"authorities (by letters marked as P7(i), P8 and P22) to register his name as the successor"
"to Lot 2297, which is the lot granted to his father by P1. In reply to those requests, the"
"Assistant  Land  Commissioner,  Kanthale  (the  2nd  Respondent),  by  his  letter  dated"
"06.04.2016 marked as P13, requested the 2nd Petitioner to hand over the Grant marked"
