"sent by the Commissioner General of lands (the 3rd Respondent) to the 2nd Respondent,"
"the Petitioners were compelled to hand over the Grant marked as P1 to the Divisional"
"Secretary of Kanthale, the 1st Respondent. Even though the 2nd Petitioner has returned"
"P1 to the 1st Respondent, his name has not been registered as the successor. Thereafter,"
"the 2nd Petitioner became aware that, notwithstanding the 2nd Respondentâ€™s failure to"
"register him as the owner of Lot 2297, the 2nd Respondent, following the demise of the"
"mother of the 4th Respondent, has registered the 4th Respondent as the owner of Lot"
"2311. Under the above-stated circumstances, the Petitioners argue that the failure of the"
"1st to 3rd Respondents to register the 2nd Petitioner as the lawful successor of Lot 2297"
"in terms of the Ordinance is arbitrary and unreasonable. The Petitioners have invoked"
"the Writ jurisdiction of this Court and seek the following substantive relief, inter alia,"
