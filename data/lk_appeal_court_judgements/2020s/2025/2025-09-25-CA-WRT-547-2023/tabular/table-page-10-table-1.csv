"“The general rule of mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority"
"to do its duty. The essence of mandamus is that it is a command issued by the"
"superior courts for the performance of public legal duty. Where officials have a"
"public duty to perform and have refused to perform, mandamus will lie to secure"
"the performance of the public duty, in the performance of which the applicant"
"has sufficient legal interest.”"
