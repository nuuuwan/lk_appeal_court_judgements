"as P23/4R4(a) to the 1st Respondent, the Petitioners have failed to return their fatherâ€™s"
"Grant marked as P1 to the 1st Respondent. The learned Counsel appearing for the 4th"
"and 5th Respondents argue that, a party seeking a Writ of Mandamus must prove that"
"such party has a legal entitlement for a Mandamus, and that the Petitioners in the instant"
"Application  have  failed  to  establish  any  legal  entitlement  to  Lot  2297,  which  is"
"currently in possession of the 4th and 5th Respondents, who have developed the said lot."
"The contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that, in terms of"
"Section 104A of the Ordinance, a Grant could only be cancelled on two grounds. Either"
"the owner of the Grant had purposefully given false information at the time of obtaining"
"the Grant, or the Grant had been issued to a person other than the person in possession"
"of the land. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners further argues that the"
"second limb of Section 104A is applicable to them. However, they were in possession"
"of lot 2311, mistakenly believing that they were in possession of lot 2297. Therefore,"
"the  Petitioners  should  not  be  punished  for  a  genuine  mistake.  Section  104  of  the"
"Ordinance sets out the grounds upon which a Grant may be cancelled. Section 104 reads"
"thus,"
