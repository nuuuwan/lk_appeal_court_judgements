"be  Lot  2297.  The  learned  State  Counsel  has  further  stated  that  when  the  1st  to  3rd"
"Respondents discovered the error committed by them, they informed the Petitioners and"
"the 4th and 5th Respondents to return P1 and P23 to cancel those Grants and issue fresh"
"Grants,  the  4th  and  5th  Respondents  have  returned  the  Grant  marked  as  P23,  but  the"
"Petitioners have failed to return P1."
"Under the above-stated circumstances, it is clear that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have"
"requested from the parties to return their Grants to correct the lot numbers when they"
"realised that they are not in possession of the respective lots which they are entitled to"
"by the respective Grants. The Petitioners are seeking relief to get the 1st and/or the 2nd"
"Petitioner registered as the lawful successor of the Grant marked as P1. Therefore, this"
"Court is of the view that the Petitioners' argument on the cancellation of the Grant P1"
"has no application to the case at hand."
"The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners further argues that, even though the"
"2nd Petitioner is  possessing Lot 2311 under the impression that  he  is  possessing  Lot"
"2297, the Petitioners, as the lawful successors of their deceased father, are entitled to"
"the rights dealt with the Grant marked as P1. Now this Court will look into whether the"
"Petitioners have a right to succeed the Grant marked as P1 as the lawful successors."
"The Petitioners' contention is that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have acted arbitrary and"
"unreasonable by refusing to register the 2nd Petitioner as the lawful successor of Lot"
"2297 under the provisions of the Ordinance. When an owner of a holding (Grant) dies"
"without leaving behind a spouse and there is no nominated successor, under Section 72"
