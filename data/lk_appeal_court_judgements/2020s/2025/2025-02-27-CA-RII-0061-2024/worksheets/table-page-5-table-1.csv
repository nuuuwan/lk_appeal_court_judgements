"Court.  Although, the petitioner appeared before the District Court  she had"
"not filed show cause as to why the decree nisi should not be made absolute."
"Counsel 
for  the  respondent  pointed  out  that  the  respondent  had  acted"
"reasonably.    As  per  the  Lease  Agreement,  the  monthly  rental  from  01st  of"
"June 2020 to 31st May 2022 was Rs. 300,000/- for a month.  However, the"
"respondent  agreed  to  reduce  the  monthly  rental  to  Rs.  150,000/-  for  the"
"months during the periods of curfew or travel restrictions due to the COVID-"
"19 pandemic.  Furthermore,  during the  time of the economic crisis, though"
"there  were  no  such  travel  restrictions  or  curfews,  the  respondent  agreed  to"
"reduce the monthly rental to Rs. 200,000/-."
"T
he  petitioner  has  obtained 
interim  orders  without  giving  notice  to  the"
"respondent and without furnishing any security, staying the proceedings in"
"the District Court."
"T
he petitioner should have contested the validity of the decree nisi before the"
"District  Court  in  terms  of  Section  12  of  the  Act.    Without  challenging  the"
"decree nisi before the District Court, the petitioner cannot seek to set aside"
"the  decree  nisi  before  this  court.    Restitutio  in  Integrum  is  an  extraordinary"
"relief granted at the discretion of the court to a petitioner whose substantial"
"rights are prejudiced or occasioned a failure of justice."
"I
n  the  above  circumstances  we  decide  that  this  is  not  a  fit  case  to  use  the"
"discretion of this court to grant relief to the petitioner.  The application of the"
"petitioner is dismissed."
