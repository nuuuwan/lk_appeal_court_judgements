"Accordingly, a “gun"" includes any component part of any such weapon."
"Thus,  any  component  part  of  a  weapon  (firearm)  comes  within  the"
"meaning of a gun as defined under Section 2 of the Firearms Ordinance."
"So, even if a component part was recovered, that would suffice to come"
"within the meaning of a firearm as aforesaid. That being so, assembly"
"of  the  components  in  the  context  of  the  Firearms  Ordinance  has  not"
"caused any prejudice or a change of form or substance that affects the"
"liability under Firearms Ordinance so to say."
