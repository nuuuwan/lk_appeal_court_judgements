"HCC-0081-21"
"the  Firearms  Ordinance.  If  ‘possession’  is  strictly  limited  to  actual"
"physical possession only, it would lead to an absurdity. For instance, if"
"the firearm was found in the house of the accused, and if such accused"
"was at a different place when or at the time the recovery was made, he"
"could not be held liable. Can this be so? I think not."
