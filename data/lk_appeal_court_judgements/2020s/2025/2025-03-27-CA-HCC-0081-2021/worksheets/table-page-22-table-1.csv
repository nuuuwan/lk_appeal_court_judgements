redibility of PW-01 and PW-04",""
"","48. The sum total of the defence position is that nothing was recovered at"
"","the Tissamaharama, Hambantota house, but a weapon was introduced"
"","by the Police. If that be so, there would be no rational or logical reason"
"","or any necessity for such a Police Officer to concoct and complicate his"
"","recovery by spinning a fictitious story that the gun was in a dismantled"
"form.  Therefore, 
the  suggestion  and","the  defence  position  become"
"","inherently improbable. Correspondingly, the testimony that it was in the"
"","dismantled form and the fact that PW-01 has documented the condition"
"","in which the weapon was recovered and the procedure adopted by him,"
"","buttresses  and  enhances  his  credibility  and  the  probability  of  his"
"","version.  It  is  a  clear  indicator  that  PW-01  has  narrated  the  events"
"","truthfully in the very manner they happened and transpired. Thus, the"
"","Trial Judgeâ€™s finding that the prosecution evidence is cogent, convincing"
"and reliable is correct and justified.",""
"Conclusion",""
"","49. An Appellate Court exercises a jurisdiction to examine the effect of the"
"","grounds raised in appeal. However, the Appellate Court will not step into"
"","shoes of the trier of fact and revisit the evidence afresh and substitute"
"","its own findings. The defects or insufficiency in the evidence and errors"
"","of  law  and  procedure  are  required  to  be  tested  and  considered  in  the"
"","context of the totality of the evidence and trial. Upon so endeavouring I"
"am  satisfied  that  the  convictions  are  not  unsafe  and  there","is  no"
"miscarriage of justice that warrant the intervention of this Court.",""
