"HCC-0081-21"
"50. On an appeal from a conviction by a  Judge alone, where the issue is"
"whether the verdict is unreasonable, an Appellate Court must determine"
"whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury or judge could"
"reasonably have reached. The question whether a verdict is reasonable"
"is  one  of  law  but  the  evaluation  of  evidence  is  one  of  fact.  This  court"
"cannot  interfere  with  those  assessments  of  fact  unless  it  cannot  be"
"supported on any reasonable view of the evidence.  [vide R. v. Burke,"
