"prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. However, there is no positive"
"finding  that  the  prosecution  has  proved  its  case  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt  at 
this  stage.  Thereafter, 
the  Trial  Judge  summarises  and"
"evaluates the accused’s evidence. It is at the end, upon considering the"
"accused’s evidence that the learned Trial Judge has come to the finding"
"of proof beyond reasonable doubt (vide page 319). As a matter of rule,"
"there is no fixed process or sequence fixed by law or otherwise as to how"
"a Judge should come to a finding in a criminal judgement. One of the"
"methods would be to consider the prosecution evidence, and if there be"
"a  case  established  on  cogent  evidence,  then  to  consider  the  defence"
"version, and finally, consider the totality and determine if there be any"
"reasonable doubt or otherwise. The learned Trial Judge has followed this"
"process. He had not placed any burden on the accused as stated by the"
"Appellant’s  counsel.  Hence 
this  ambiguity  has  not  prejudiced 
the"
"substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice."
