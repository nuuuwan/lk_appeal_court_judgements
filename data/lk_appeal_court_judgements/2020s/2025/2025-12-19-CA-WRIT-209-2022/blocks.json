    "text": "Decided on: 19.12.2025 Mahen Gopallawa, J. Introduction The Petitioner, who was serving in the rank of Leading Infantry of the Sri Lanka Navy (Regular Force) with a period of 16 years 09 months of service in the Sri Lanka Navy, has been dismissed without disgrace consequent to a Summary Trial held against him. In the instant application, he has sought a writ of Certiorari to quash the proceedings of the said Summary Trial held by the 2nd Respondent on 02.03.2021 and the verdict and punishment delivered therein. The Petitioner has also sought a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to reinstate the Petitioner in the service of the Sri Lanka Navy with effect from 08.04.2021, which is the date he was dismissed. The Respondents, by their statement of objections dated 21.11.2024, have objected to the grant of the aforesaid reliefs, and, accordingly, the application was taken up for argument. The parties also tendered written submissions. Factual Background In the first instance, I intend to briefly examine the circumstances which culminated in the conduct of the Summary Trial and the dismissal of the Petitioner from the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN), as presented in the pleadings. The Petitioner had been serving as a junior instructor at the SLN Camp named Navy Ship Shiksha (SLNS Shikha) at Poonewa training recruits. According to the Petitioner, the events that subsequently unfolded had occurred due to reporting an incident of assault of a recruit P.R.S. Sasika by an officer Lieutenant Commander T.S.P.P. Deraniyagala (4th Respondent) on 12.02.2021, pursuant to which a Board of Inquiry into the incident was convened and he had made statements. Thereafter, the said 4th Respondent is said to have threatened the Petitioner stating that \u201c\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0d8b\u0db9\u0da7 \u0d89\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dc4\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dda\u201d (see what will happen to you in the future).",

Although the Petitioner had denied such allegation, the 5th Respondent, who was an officer of the Naval Provost Branch, had assaulted him on the back of his head and abdomen, in the presence of naval recruits. Four naval recruits, who had witnessed such assault, have corroborated such account of events and submitted affidavits, which have been annexed to the petition marked \u2018P2\u2019, \u2018P3\u2019, \u2018P4\u2019 and \u2018P5\u2019. It is observed that, apart from a bare denial, the Respondents have not offered any explanation regarding this incident. The Petitioner had been ordered by the 5th Respondent to give a written statement, and, he states, that, despite the coercion exerted, he had given a written statement denying the allegation made against him. However, a copy of the said statement had not been issued to the Petitioner, despite a request being made under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016. Upon a statement being recorded, the Petitioner had been returned to SLNS Shiksha, although his telephone had been seized. According to the petition, the Petitioner had been taken into custody again by the Naval Provost Branch at or about 0900hrs on the following day (25.02.2021) and had been presented before the 6th Respondent at the North Central Naval Hospital for a urine test. The 3rd Respondent had informed him that his urine sample was tested positive and threatened him to admit the allegations made against him, when he was taken back to the Naval Provost Branch. Recruit W.A.C.N. Chandrasiri had also been produced for a urine test along with the Petitioner on 25.02.2021. The Petitioner has annexed a copy of the Medical Report pertaining to the test to the petition (\u2018P6\u2019), which was obtained through a RTI request after his dismissal. The Petitioner has observed that a single report has been issued in respect of both persons and has assailed its authenticity. In order to avoid further physical and mental harassment, the Petitioner states that he had given a written statement that he had brought cannabis to the Camp and had sold them to recruit Chandrasiri and a copy of the said statement, which he had obtained through another RTI request, has been tendered with the petition marked \u2018P7\u2019. Once again, on 26.02.2021 the Petitioner had been taken into custody by the Naval Provost Branch and was shown a statement made by Recruit Chandrasiri and was ordered to make a verbal statement consistent with the same. The Petitioner had complied in desperation. In the statement of recruit Chandrasiri, as there was an additional allegation that the Petitioner had sold him two cigarette packets at a price of Rs. 4000/=, he was ordered to make a further written statement on such issue as well. The verbal and written statements made by the Petitioner, which he had obtained after his dismissal through a RTI request, have been annexed to the petition marked \u2018P8\u2019 and \u2018P9\u2019. He had been handed back to SLNS Shiksha at about 2100hrs and been kept in \u201cclose arrest\u201d (detention) in the guard detention room for a period of 5 days until 02.03.2021. The Petitioner alleges that he was subjected to",

Although the Petitioner had requested for a copy of the charge sheet and wanted to seek legal assistance and know the Defending Officer appointed to represent him, such requests were disregarded and was marched to the Commandant\u2019s Office for the Summary Trial. He states that he was told by the 7th Respondent to plead guilty. The Petitioner has stated that, although he expected to be asked by the 2nd Respondent whether he desired to be dealt with summarily or tried by a Court Martial as per the provisions of the Navy Act, he not given such option, and, the Summary Trial commenced straightway with the charges being read out. As per the proceedings of the Summary Trial marked \u2018P14\u2019, which too had been issued to the Petitioner after his dismissal upon a RTI request, the 3 charges had been framed against the Petitioner in respect of the following acts; illegally bringing cigarettes into the Camp and selling them at an exorbitant rate to naval recruits (charge 1); surreptitiously bringing cannabis, which is a prohibited substance, into the Camp and selling them to naval recruits (charge 2); and making and smoking cannabis cigarettes, which is a prohibited substance (charge 3).

    "text": "The Petitioner has stated that, although he had pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to all the charges, disregarding his plea, the 2nd Respondent had stated that he found the Petitioner guilty of all the charges even before commencing proceedings.1 The proceedings of the Summary Trial (\u2018P14\u2019) indicate that the Petitioner had pleaded guilty to all 3 charges. The Petitioner has further stated that he was unaware that he was being represented by the 8th Respondent (Lieutenant (Vol) W.M.N.M. Bandara) until the verdict was pronounced, and that the said 8th Respondent had neither discussed the case with him beforehand nor spoken to him before, during or after the Summary Trial. The involvement of the 8th Respondent appears to have been confined to making a plea in mitigation after the final address of the prosecuting officer requesting the 2nd Respondent to inflict a less severe punishment upon the Petitioner.2 On the conduct of the Summary Trial, the Petitioner has stated that only one witness, Recruit Chandrasiri was called to give evidence, and that he was not given an opportunity to cross-examine such witness.3 He has further stated that he was also not given an opportunity to call any witnesses on his behalf or even to give evidence himself on oath or at least to make a statement.4 He has also stated that he was not issued a copy of the proceedings of the Summary Trial and that such proceedings were issued only after he was dismissed upon an RTI request.5 The Petitioner has stated that he was kept under \u201copen arrest\u201d after the Summary Trial until 30.03.2021. He has also averred that, during such period, he had met Recruit Chandrasiri who was also kept on \u201copen arrest\u201d and that the said Chandrasiri had stated that he had",

A written statement given to such effect has been annexed to the petition marked \u2018P15\u2019.6 On 30.03.2021, the Petitioner had been marched for a parade and the 2nd Respondent had read out the warrant of sentence imposing the punishment of dismissal from the Navy without disgrace. Accordingly, the 7th Respondent had ordered him to leave the Camp on 08.04.2021.7 Thereafter, the Petitioner has stated that he had submitted an appeal dated 24.04.2021 (\u2018P16\u2019) to the 1st Respondent Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy seeking reinstatement, and, in the absence of a reply, he had submitted a further appeal dated 22.10.2021 (\u2018P17\u2019). Reference has also been made to the correspondence addressed through his Attorneys-at-Law on 23.11.2021 (\u2018P18\u2019) and the response thereto by the SLN dated 22.04.2022 (\u2018P23\u2019), and several RTI requests made by the Petitioner (\u2018P19\u2019, \u2018P20\u2019, \u2018P21\u2019 and \u2018P22\u2019). In the backdrop of the aforementioned narrative presented by the Petitioner, I wish to examine the response thereto by the Respondents. The objections of the Respondents consist of a statement of objections and an affidavit affirmed to by the 1st Respondent Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy supplementing the same. In the said objections, it is, inter alia, stated that the 3 charges against the Petitioner were read over to him before the executive officer to SLNS Shiksha on 24.02.2021, and, as such he had sufficient time to prepare his defence.8 The said objections also set out that the Petitioner was not given an opportunity to choose between a Court Martial and a Summary Trial due to the fact that he was a junior sailor and was only entitled to be tried at a Summary Trial.9 With regard to appointment of the 8th Respondent as the Petitioner\u2019s Defending Officer, the Respondents have taken up the position that the Petitioner never objected to such appointment or requested that any other officer be appointed10 and have stated that the 8th Respondent had been given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness Recruit Chandrasiri11 and had also made a plea in mitigation of punishment at the said Trial.12 With regard to the Petitioner\u2019s conduct at the Summary Trial, the objections refer to the fact that the Petitioner had pleaded guilty to all charges, and, as such, it was not necessary to lead any evidence of Naval Provost personnel or the Medical Officer.13 The objections",

It is further observed that the directions to officers conducting Summary Trials contained in the said SLNO are cast in mandatory terms with the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d in most instances. It is evident that the grounds of review urged by the Petitioner essentially relate to violations of the principles of natural justice, more particularly the denial of a fair hearing, in the conduct of the Summary Trial conducted against him. Thus, it is incumbent upon this Court to consider and determine whether any provisions of the Navy Act or the principles and safeguards set out in SLNO 0501 have been violated in the conduct of the Summary Trial against the Petitioner. The following issues relating to the conduct of the Summary Trial have been raised in the pleadings and were addressed by learned Counsel in their submissions and written submissions filed by the parties. (a) Choice of a Court Martial or Summary Trial The Petitioner has alleged that he was not asked by the 2nd Respondent whether he wished to be tried by a Court Martial or tried summarily as provided in sections 29 read with 28 of the Navy Act.17 It is also observed that clause 6(b) of SLNO 0501 requires such option to be offered to a \u201csenior sailor\u201d who is charged for a \u201cnon-disciplinary offence.\u201d The position of the Respondents in issue is that section 29 of the Navy Act is not applicable in the instant case for two reasons; firstly, as per the ranks published in the Ceylon Government Gazette No. 10,222 dated 09.03.1951 (\u2018R1\u2019), the rank of \u201cLeading Seaman\u201d (Leading Infantry) which the Petitioner held was lower than the ranks of \u201cWarrant Officer \u201c and \u201cPetty Officer\u201d to whom the option of a Court Martial or Summary Trial was to be offered under the said section. Secondly, it was submitted that the all 3 charges preferred",

Such position taken up by the Respondents is confirmed by a plain reading of the text of section 29 of the Navy Act. For avoidance of any doubt, since specific reference has been made to \u201cofficer\u201d in section 28(1)(b) of said Act, such provision too is not applicable to the Petitioner by virtue of his lower rank. Hence, I am inclined to accept the position taken up by the Respondents that the Petitioner was only entitled to be tried summarily by virtue of his rank and nature of offences preferred against him, and, as such, offering the option of a Court Martial did not arise. (b) Appointment of a Defending Officer The Petitioner contended that he was denied the right of being defended by a Defending Officer of his choice at the Summary Trial in violation of clause 5(g) of SLNO 0501. As set out in the factual narrative above, the Petitioner has stated that he was unaware that he was being represented by the 8th Respondent until the verdict was pronounced and had neither discussed the case with him beforehand nor spoken to him before or during or after the Summary Trial.",

They have further pointed out that the 8th Respondent had been given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness Recruit Chandrasiri and had also made a plea in mitigation of punishment at the said Trial. The objections of the Respondents do not reveal that the appointment of the 8th Respondent was made prior to the date of the Summary Trial or that the Petitioner was afforded an opportunity to discuss his case and prepare his defence. The proceedings of the Summary Trial (\u2018P14\u2019) show that the 8th Respondent had not cross-examined the only witness for the prosecution and had only made a plea in mitigation after the verdict had been delivered. Although the Petitioner had made specific allegations regarding the appointment and the role of the 8th Respondent, neither the said Respondent nor the 2nd Respondent who had appointed him had sought to file affidavits offering an explanation. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner had not been provided the services of a Defending Officer at his will, as contemplated by clause 5(g) of SLNO 0501, thereby impairing his ability to defend himself against the charges preferred against him. In arriving at this conclusion, I am guided by the decision in Lalith Deshapriya v. Captain Weerakoon",

Although it is observed that the passiveness in requesting a Defence Officer of his choice, the Court cannot condone the Respondents for failing to serve the accused a charge sheet, failure to provide adequate time to prepare his defence and most significantly on the grave violations of the Sri Lanka Navy Order 0501 marked R3 when conducting the Summary Trial.20 (c) Prior Service of the Charge Sheet",

Firstly, it is observed that the 3rd charge preferred against the Petitioner relates to making and smoking cannabis cigarettes, which is a prohibited substance.

    "text": "containing the request for such tests for the aforementioned persons and the results of such tests confirms the position that both the request was made and the tests were conducted on 25.02.2021. Since it could be reasonably expected that a charge of smoking cannabis could have been preferred only after the results of the aforementioned medical test were available, it would have been well-nigh impossible for the executive officer to SLNS Shiksha to have read over the \u201c3 charges\u201d against the Petitioner on 24.02.2021, as contended by the Respondents. Secondly, neither a copy of the charge sheet issued against the Petitioner nor any proof of the charges being read over have been tendered to this Court by the Respondents. The \u201c3 charges\u201d against the Petitioner are only stated in the proceedings of the Summary Trial (\u2018P14\u2019). However, I wish to state that such record of the proceedings of the Summary Trial cannot be equated to a charge sheet or considered as a substitute thereof. Thirdly, neither the officer who is alleged to have read the charges over to the Petitioner nor any other Respondent who was privy to the same have submitted affidavit evidence to such effect, although the Petitioner had put such matter in issue from the very outset in the petition. Fourthly, as evidenced by the Log Entry in the Log Book of SLNS Shiksha (\u2018P10\u2019), the Petitioner has been placed under \u201cclose arrest\u201d from 26.02.2021 until the commencement of the Summary Trial on 02.03.2021. No evidence has been placed by the Respondents that a charge sheet was served to him or the charges were read over to him or services of a Defending Officer were provided during such period of detention. In such circumstances, I conclude that neither was a charge sheet served on the Petitioner nor sufficient time granted for him to prepare for his defence, as required by clause 5(f) of SLNO 0501. In Lalith Deshapriya v. Captain Weerakoon and others (supra),22 the Court reached a similar conclusion, highlighting the absence of a separate charge sheet. (d) The Plea of the Accused A key issue in dispute between the parties relates to the plea made by the Petitioner and recorded by the 2nd Respondent at the Summary Trial. According to the Petitioner, he had pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to all the charges, but disregarding his plea, a plea of guilt had been recorded in respect of all 3 charges.23 The position maintained by the Respondents was that the plea of \u201cguilty\u201d was validly made by the Petitioner.

    "text": "Trial (\u2018P14\u2019) indicate that the Petitioner had pleaded guilty to all 3 charges, after the Court had inquired whether he understood the said charges. Based on the proceedings (\u2018P14\u2019), there appears to be notional compliance with clauses 6(d) (reading out and explaining of the charges to the accused) and clause 6(e) (plea of the accused to the charges) of SLNO 0501, to the extent that the charges appear to have been read over and a plea of \u201cguilty\u201d from the accused had been recorded. However, that clause 6(f) of SLNO 0501 imposes two further obligations on the officer conducting the trial; firstly, if such officer is not satisfied that the accused understood the consequences of his plea of guilt, he is required to fully explain to the accused such consequences; and secondly, such officer is required to ensure that the accused pleaded guilty without any threat, promise or coercion. In my view, such provisions perform a critical function in ensuring a fair trial, namely, to ascertain whether the plea is made knowingly and voluntarily. It is observed that there is no notation or certification in the proceedings (\u2018P14\u2019) made by the 2nd Respondent that he had considered such matters and satisfied himself that the aforementioned twin requirements in clause 6(f) have been met. It is also observed that, although the Petitioner had made a specific and personal allegation against the 2nd Respondent in incorrectly recording his plea, the said Respondent has opted not to respond to such allegation by affidavit evidence, though he had ample opportunity to do so. Considering the aforementioned matters, and bearing in mind the very serious allegations made by the Petitioner regarding the circumstances in which disciplinary action was initiated against him (which the Respondents have not responded in detail), I am not inclined to accept that the Petitioner\u2019s plea of \u201cguilty\u201d recorded in the proceedings of the Summary Trial (\u2018P14\u2019) had been validly made and reflects the true intention of the Petitioner regarding the charges preferred against him. (e) Conduct of the Trial The Petitioner has referred to several violations of clause 6 of the SLNO 0501 in the conduct of the Summary Trial, including not being furnished with copies of summary of evidence, abstract of evidence or the investigation report prepared against him, not being afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the witness who gave evidence against him (clause 6(h)) or call witnesses on his behalf (clause 6(l)) or to give evidence under oath or to make a statement without taking oath (clauses 6(k) and 6(l)). He has also contended that, although the charges against him had been based on the investigation conducted by the Naval Provost Personnel including the 3rd and 5th Respondents and the medical report issued by",

In response, Respondents took up the option that that, since the Petitioner pleaded guilty to all charges, it was not necessary to lead any evidence of Naval Provost personnel or the Medical Officer.24 They have further maintained that, the Petitioner had opted to remain silent, though he had been given a fair opportunity to give evidence himself or call other witnesses,25 and that he had not requested for any summary of evidence or abstract of evidence or investigation report.26 Upon perusal of the proceedings in \u2018P14\u2019, it is observed that the manner in which the Trial has been conducted after the plea of the accused has been recorded appears to be irregular and contrary to the procedure prescribed in clause 6 of SLNO 0501. In terms of clause 6(f), if the officer conducting the trial was satisfied about the plea of guilt by the accused, the steps set out in clauses 6(g) to 6 (n) should be skipped and he should proceed to convict the accused on his own plea and pass sentence in terms of clauses 6(o) and 6(p). However, in the instant case, despite the Petitioner\u2019s plea of guilt, the 2nd Respondent had called for evidence from the prosecution. Notwithstanding the fact that he had called for evidence to be led, the 2nd Respondent had nevertheless proceeded to convict the Petitioner based on his plea. Thus, I am not convinced that the Summary Trial has been held in accordance with the procedure set out in clause 6 of SLNO 0501. The Petitioner has also assailed the authenticity of the proceedings of the Summary Trial (\u2018P14\u2019) on the premise that the questions by the Court after the examination-in-chief of the only witness for the prosecution (Recruit Chandrasiri) appeared to be directed not at the said witness but at the Petitioner.

As opposed to that, the accused has denied being in possession and also suggested that this may be an introduction. What is important is that a person entrusted with the trying of the accused, both on facts and law, should advert and consider the evidence and formulate his opinion. In the present context, these also entailed the evaluation of the position put forward by the accused person. According to item 06(n) of the Sri Lanka Navy Order 0501, reasons should be indicated. Indicating the reasons will mean the manifesting of such reasons, which should be available along with the finding, and therefore, the reasons for the finding should be provided.

    "text": "An administrative official or tribunal exercising a quasi \u2013 judicial power is bound to comply with the principles of natural justice. i.e. to comply with the rules of audi altera partem and nemo judex in causa sua. A quasi-judicial decision may involve finding of facts and it affects the rights of a person. Sometimes such decisions involve matters of law and facts or even purely matters of law. In Russell v. Duke of Norfolk and Others (1949) 1 All E.R. 109 Tucker LJ. observed that one essential requirement in regard to the exercise of judicial and quasi \u2013 judicial powers is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case. I am of the opinion that where the power is conferred in an administrative body or tribunal which exercises power in making decisions which affect the rights of persons, such body or tribunal should act according to the principles of natural justice except in cases where such right is excluded, either by express words or by necessary implication, by the legislature. Lord Diplock in the case of O\u2019Reilly v. and Others v. Mackman and Others (1983) 2 AC 237 at 276 held that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that Parliament intended that a failure to observe it should render null and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement. In relation to Summary Trials in the Tri Forces, the indispensable requirement for decision-makers to give a fair hearing has been articulated in Lalith Deshapriya v. Captain Weerakoon and others (supra) in the following manner (per Marsoof, J. P/CA (as he then was);",

According to the jurisprudence built around the audi alteram partem principal, there should not only be a hearing of both sides, but the hearing should be more than a pretence. The procedure followed should be fair and conducive to the achievement of justice. In",

Hence, I hold that the disciplinary proceedings conducted against the Petitioner and his consequent dismissal from service by the Sri Lanka Navy is illegal and ultra vires theprovisions of the Navy Act and the SLNO 0501 and unreasonable. As pleaded in his appeals \u2018P16\u2019 and \u2018P17\u2019, the dismissal from service has adversely affected his career progression, livelihood and tarnished his reputation.

Accordingly, I proceed to issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the proceedings of the Summary Trial held against the Petitioner by the 2nd Respondent on 02.03.2021 and the verdict and punishment delivered therein, as prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition. I further issue a writ of Mandamus directing the 1B Respondent to re-instate the Petitioner in the service of the Sri Lanka Navy forthwith, notionally with effect from 08.04.2021, which is the date on which he was dismissed without disgrace from the Navy. However, the Petitioner will not be entitled to any payment of salary or other emoluments during the period that he has not in fact been in service. In this context, I also wish to observe that the Court has not been informed of any circumstances that may impede the ability of the Respondents to give effect to the above writ of Mandamus.
