"4.  When this application was filed on 21.05.2025 the said Eviction Order P-"
"22 issued by the learned Magistrate was in existence. The Eviction Order"
"is  now  issued.  By  this  application,  the  petitioner  is  seeking  to  quash"
"certain steps taken prior to and made in the run up to the said Eviction"
"Order. As such, the relief sought will be superfluous and futile so long as"
"the eviction order remains unchallenged and in force. The petitioner ought"
"to  have  challenged  the  Quit  Notice  before  the  issue  of  the  Order  for"
"Eviction. A Writ of Mandamus will not be issued if it will be futile and be"
"of no purpose."
