"The court has a discretion in regard to the grant of relief in the exercise"
"of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time and time again by"
"our Courts that ‘A writ... will not issue where it would be vexatious or"
"futile.’  See,  P.S.  Bus  Co.  Ltd.  v  Members  and  Secretary  of  the"
"Ceylon Transport Board. (61 NLR 491, 496).”"
