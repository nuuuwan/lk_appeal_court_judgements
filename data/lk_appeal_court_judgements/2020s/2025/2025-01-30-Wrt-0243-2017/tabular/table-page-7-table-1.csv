"Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, has nothing to do with clearing the lands"
"belonging  to  the  temple  lands.    It  is  clear  from  the  objections  and  the"
"documents  tendered  by  the  respondents  that  the  10th  respondent  has  not"
"cleared  any  area  declared  as  a  forest  by  any  law  or  gazette  notification."
"Clearly,  the  land  used  for  mango  cultivation  belongs  to  the  temple.    That"
"mango 
cultivation 
is 
adjoining 
the  main 
road 
from  Nakolagane 
to"
"Ehetuwewa.  It is also adjoining the Nakolagane Kanishta Vidyalaya and the"
"temple.  The  10th  respondent  carried  out 
the  plantation  of 
the  mango"
"saplings, leaving the major trees that were on the location."
"W
hile  this  action  was  pending  before  this  court,  there  was  a  joint  field"
"inspection by all the parties to the action.  A copy of the observations by the"
"parties  was  attached  to  the  affidavit  of  the  10th  respondent.    According  to"
"that  report,  a  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Buddhist  Affairs,  two  officers  from"
"Central  Environment  Authority,  an  officer  from  Wild  Life  Conservation,  the"
"acting Director of Provincial Environmental Authority, the 10th respondent,"
"two representatives representing the 1st and 2nd petitioners, a legal officer"
"of  the  3rd  petitioner,  a  Deputy  Director  of  Central  Environment  Authority"
"and 
two 
officers 
from  Ehetuwewa  Divisional  Secretariat  Office  had"
"participated in the joint field inspection.  In their report, they observed that"
"Nakolagane Kanishta Vidayalaya, the temple, the mango plantation and two"
"houses  of 
the  petitioners  were  all  situated  on 
the  same  side  of 
the"
"Nakolagane Ehetuwewa main road.  All three are almost adjoining lands and"
"were protected by electric fences.  They also came to the conclusion that the"
"electric fence erected by the 10th respondent does not obstruct any elephant"
"corridor.  All the parties stated above signed these observations."
"T
he  petitioners  have 
failed  to  substantiate  the  allegation  that  the  10th"
"respondent  has  obstructed  an  elephant  corridor  or  where 
the  alleged"
"elephant  corridor  is  situated.  The  land  used  to  cultivate  mango  saplings"
"clearly  belonged  to  the  temple  and  was  not  a  forest  land.  The  allegations"
"that the 10th respondent and his servants or agents have acted contrary to"
"and  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  law  are  not  substantiated.  There  is  no"
"allegation to say that specific provisions of law have been violated."
"T
he  respondents  dispute  the  major  facts  pleaded  by  the  petitioners.  When"
"the  petition  raises  questions  of  fact  that  are  disputed,  their  determination"
"requires oral evidence  and such disputes may not appropriately be tried in a"
"writ application."
