"(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  temple)  contrary  to  and  in  violation  of  the"
"provisions of law and such activities were being carried out in collaboration"
"with /or with the funding of private investors. The petitioner further states"
"that the 10th respondent proceeded with clearing the forest and erecting the"
"electric 
fence  without  obtaining  necessary  approvals 
required  by 
the"
"National  Environmental  Act,  the  Buddhist  Temporalities  Ordinance,  the"
"Antiquities Ordinance, the North Western Provincial Environmental Statute"
"and the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance."
"T
he  petitioners 
further  state 
that  an  electric 
fence  has  been  erected"
"surrounding the cleared area contrary to the instructions of the Department"
"of  Wild  Life  Conservation  and  the  provisions  of  the  law.  The  petitioner"
"further states that the cleared area was a natural forest patch that formed a"
"refuge for elephants that regularly traverse this area and is a critical part of"
"their  home  range.  Clearing  and  blocking  areas  such  as  these  result  in  a"
"decrease 
in  access 
to  natural 
forest  areas 
for 
the  elephants, 
thereby"
"compelling  them  to  use  the  area  inhabited  by  humans  more  and  more,"
"leading to the escalation of human-elephant conflict in the area."
"T
he 1st to 9th respondents and the 11th respondent filed objections to the"
"petitioner’s  application  together,  while  the  10th  respondent  filed  objections"
"to the petitioner’s application separately."
"T
he  respondents  stated  that  the  10th  respondent  had  not  cleared  forest"
"land.  The  10th  respondent  had  cleared  shrubs/bushes  and  weeds  in  the"
"area 
for 
the  purpose  of  cultivating  a  mango  plantation.  Further, 
the"
"respondent states that mango trees result in a lusher forest area when fully"
"developed.  Consequently, 
the  assertion 
that 
the  10th 
respondent  has"
"harmed 
the  environment  by  clearing 
forest 
land 
is  unreasonable  and"
"without merit."
"I
n his objections the 10th respondent stated that the development committee"
"of  the  temple  decided  to  plant  mango  trees  in  the  temple  land  to  generate"
"income  to  bear  the  expenses  of  the  temple.  He  further  states  that  he  had"
"cleared only shrubs and bushes and not removed any trees.  In the cleared"
"area, he planted mango saplings. The 10th respondent provided photographs"
"(marked 10R 14 and 10R 15) of the cultivated mango trees and a sketch of"
"the disputed area."
