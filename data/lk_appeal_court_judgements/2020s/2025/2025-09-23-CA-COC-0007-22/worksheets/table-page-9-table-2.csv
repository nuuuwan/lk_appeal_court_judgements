"views of the Court in Sectorguard plc v Dienne plc [2009] EWHC 2693 (Ch),"
"“…failure to perform an impossible undertaking is not a contempt. The"
"mental element required of a contemnor is not that he either intends to"
"breach or knows that he is breaching the court order or undertaking, but"
"only that he intended the act or omission in question, and knew the facts"
"which made it a breach of the order”."
