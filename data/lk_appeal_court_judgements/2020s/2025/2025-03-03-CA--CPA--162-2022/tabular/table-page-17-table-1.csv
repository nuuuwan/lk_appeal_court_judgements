"It  is  clear  from  the  above-stated  facts  that  the  Law  Court  for  Minors  in  Milan  has"
"observed that even though there is a conflict between the parents, there appears to be a"
"sufficiently good relationship between the 1st Respondent and the children. Further, it"
"is clear from these observations that even the Law Court for Minors in Milan is reluctant"
"to  forfeiture  of  parental  responsibility  of  the  1st  Respondent  due  to  the  lack  of  a"
"psychological assessment of both parents and for the reasons of the investigations that"
"are still in progress. In the said order the Law Court for Minors in Milan has entrusted"
"the custody of the children to the Municipality of the residence to keep the children"
"with the mother. The Law Court for Minors in Milan had also instructed to regulate the"
"relationship  between  the  1st  Respondent  and  the  children  and  if  requested,  it  to  be"
"observed and protected with the help of an educator at the initial stage."
"When considering the above facts, one cannot presume that once the children return to"
"Italy the 1st Respondent will be forfeited from his parental responsibilities based on the"
"document  marked  as  1R7(a).  Therefore,  this  Court  is  not  inclined  to  accept  the"
"argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner in that regard based on a"
"presumption that the 1st Respondentâ€™s parental rights might be forfeited which might"
"lead  to  placing  the  children  in  an  intolerable  situation  upon  their  return  to  Italy."
"Considering the above facts this Court is of the opinion that the learned High Court"
"judge  had  not  erred  in  concluding  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  proved  the  exceptions"
"provided by Section 11(1) of the Act."
