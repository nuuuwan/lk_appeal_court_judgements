"Italy on 09.03.2015. The children stayed in Italy for an unknown period until returning"
"to Sri Lanka and once again returning back to Italy on 21.06.2015."
"Even though the Petitioner contends that the habitual residence of the children is in Sri"
"Lanka, the only materials brought before the Court to prove it is the fact that the eldest"
"child attended school in Sri Lanka after they returned to Sri Lanka in the year 2014 and"
"the fact that the parents had a settled intention to have their habitual residence in Sri"
"Lanka."
"The learned SASG appearing for the Petitioner-Respondent citing the case Friedrich v."
"Friedrich6 where it was held that, “to determine the habitual residence, the court must"
"focus on the child, not the parents, and examine past experience, not future intentions”"
"argued  that  the  habitual  resident  of  the  children  cannot  solely  be  decided  upon  an"
"intention to build a matrimonial home in Sri Lanka. When examining the brief of the"
"case before the High Court of Colombo, even though the 1st Respondent has admitted"
"that they came to Sri Lanka to build a house, no other evidence has been brought before"
"the High Court to prove that the parents had a settled intention to change their habitual"
"residence to Sri Lanka. Considering the above fact this Court is inclined to accept the"
"argument of the Learned SASG that the intention between the parents cannot be the"
"sole fact to decide the habitual residence of the Children."
