"The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argued that the learned High"
"Court judge erred in his judgement by failing to take into consideration the applications"
"for the return of the children made by the appropriate authority in Italy marked as P3a"
"and P3b. The learned Counselâ€™s argument is that the request is to return the children to"
"Italy to the usual residence with the mother until a court of law in  Italy or Sri Lanka"
"makes a definitive decision on their custody and such order of custody has already been"
"passed  by  the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  of  the  Western  Province  in  the  case  No."
"WP/HHCA/MT/73/2019/F - A and B."
"In terms of Section 11(4) of the Act, the High Court shall take into account a decision"
"on custody of the child when making an order of return to the specified country under"
"Section 10 of the Act and such decision on custody shall not be the only reason to refuse"
"to make an order of return. Section 11(4) reads thus,"
