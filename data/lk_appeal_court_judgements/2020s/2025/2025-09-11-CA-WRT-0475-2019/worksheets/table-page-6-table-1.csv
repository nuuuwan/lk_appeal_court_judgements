"Illankagoon at page 53, citing the dicta of the case of Chandrasena,"
"the Court held as follows:"
"“To  be  more  specific,  when  doing  so:  the  court  should  weigh  the"
"character  and  substance  of  the  expectation  and  the  prejudice"
"caused to the petitioner by its frustration, on the one hand; against"
"the 
importance  of 
the  public

"representation, it correspondingly creates a right in such person to have"
"the  same  enforced.  This  right,  in  such  person,  would  thus  create  a"
"corresponding  duty  upon  such  public  official  who 
is  statutorily"
"empowered  and  authorised  to  give  effect  to  the  same.  Legitimate"
"expectation may be procedural or substantive. I will now endeavour to"
