"Further in D.K.Lionel vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 79 NLR 553, Tennekoon,"
"C.J. has stated,"
"“the duty of the Judge to inform the “accused” that he is entitled to"
"give  evidence  must  be  addressed  to  the  accused  himself  and  the"
"decision whether or not the accused is to give evidence must be that of"
"the accused himself.”"
"16. On July 29, 2019, when the case was resumed for further trial, the Counsel"
"representing  the  first  appellant  in  the  High  Court  has  withdrawn  from  the"
"proceedings.    Consequently,  a  new  Counsel  has  been  assigned  to  the  first"
"appellant and the trial continued on the same day."
"17. However, the assigned Counsel has not been given adequate time to prepare"
"for  the  case,  by  the  trial  being  adjourned  to  another  day.  As  a  result,  the"
"assigned Counsel has been required to conduct the case of the first appellant"
"without proper preparation. This situation, it is argued by the learned Counsel"
"for the appellants has compromised the fairness of the trial of his client."
"I
n Murugaiya Sharmila Devi vs. Hon. Attorney General CA 262/09, decided on"
"October 03, 2012, Rohini Marasinghe, J. has stated,"
"“The Counsel for the Appellant contends that the appellant had been"
"denied  a  fair  trial.  In  this  case  as  borne  out  by  the  case  record,  the"
"assigned counsel of the appellant had been absent at the time the case"
"was taken up for hearing. The Trial Judge had very rightly assigned"
"another  counsel.  Having  assigned  a  counsel,  the  Trial  Judge  had"
"wrongly proceeded to hear the case on the same day at the same time.”"
"18. The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the respondents"
"has  acknowledged  that  the  procedural  discrepancies  mentioned  earlier  has"
"deprived the appellants of their right to a fair trial in the High Court."
"19. The offences with which the appellants have been charged are of a serious and"
"grave  nature.  Acquitting  the  appellants  solely  on  the  basis  of  procedural"
