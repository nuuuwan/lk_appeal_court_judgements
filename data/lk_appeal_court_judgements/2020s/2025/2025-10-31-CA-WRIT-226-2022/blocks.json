If the Petitioner\u2019s stance was that there should have been strict compliance with the provisions of the statute and that JEDB should have been sent a section 4 notice, then the Petitioner should explain why it has represented itself by P16 and stake a claim to obtain compensation which is payable to the owner. Further, the Petitioner has failed to disclose whether the Petitioner, as the lessee and the occupant, has informed the lessor of the acquisition of part of the estate. The Petitioner has failed to give an explanation to this effect. Further, in the last paragraph of page 2 of P16, the Petitioner makes a specific representation stating that whatever compensation is being given, the lessee should take steps to obtain the compensation on behalf of the lessor. The Petitioner made further representations to state that the lessor had given powers to the lessee to obtain compensation on behalf of the lessor.

It appears to this Court that this paragraph explains why a section 4 notice had not been sent to the JEDB at the commencement. However, as per the submissions made by the Respondents and the available documents, it appears to this Court that the acquiring officer, in the absence of identifying an owner, had decided to resort to section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act. Subsequently, the Petitioner, being in possession of the land, had received the said notice. A plain reading of the said letter also indicates that at the inquiry, the Petitioner had not disclosed the ownership of the JEDB. Therefore, in the letter dated 20.04.2021 marked as P17, the inquiring officer had clearly addressed the two main objections raised by the Petitioner. Firstly, that the probability of laying off the workers who were working within the 12 acre plot could be remedied by redeploying them elsewhere within the estate. Secondly, the author had disregarded the said land having a tea plantation by stating that there is no other alternate land identified for the purposes of development of the university. Finally, the author had further stated to support the acquisition process, that it is considered a national requirement, thus overruling the objection pertaining to the acquisition.",

The process had been ongoing until 2021, with the Petitioner refusing and objecting to the acquisition. As per the documents before this Court, it appears that the necessity for acquiring the land is for the Uva Wellassa University. The necessity of the acquisition was further elaborated by the learned Senior State Counsel, drawing our attention to document R7. It was strenuously argued that the need for the acquisition of the 12 acres was for the purpose of the construction of hostels for the students of the university. As per the said document, it was brought to the attention of this Court that there are 2290 students who are not in hostels and that there are 1308 students residing in 48 rented houses and the rent for the said 48 houses per month totals to a staggering amount of Rs. 43 million, which would result in a huge financial loss. Thus, it was the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel that by resorting to section 38 proviso (a), especially in the face of the objections and the refusal to hand over land by the Petitioner, the authorities had acted to expedite the acquisition process. Coming back to consider whether publication of a notice under section 38 proviso (a) is justifiable and whether there is an urgency, in my view, the process of acquisition that commenced in 2019 had not concluded even by 2021, i.e., three years after the commencement of the acquisition process. Leave alone the construction of hostels for the students, the State has not been able to even conclude the acquisition process of the land. In my view, coming to a conclusion as to whether there was an urgency depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. In this instance, the burning issue of constructing hostels for the students even after the lapse of three years from the commencement of the proceedings to acquire the land is yet to be concluded. I am satisfied that the Respondents have demonstrated the urgency for the acquisition through the document marked as R7, on the other hand, considering all these factors, in my view, the Petitioner has failed to impress",

In my view, no person would like his or her land being acquired, especially a plantation company that has leased out a land to obtain economic benefits. The Petitioner\u2019s contention is based on the premise that the lot acquired is cultivated by them with tea. However, the Respondents have tendered documents and argued that the said lot is uncultivated land which consists of a scrub jungle. Therefore, they contend there is no economic benefit derived from the lot acquired. As the two conflicting contentions make the issue of cultivation a disputed fact, in my view, this Court would not be the correct forum to canvass the said contention. However, it is sufficient to state that for the acquisition, the statute itself provides compensation and as I have held elsewhere in this judgement, it is for a public purpose and for the benefit of a larger section of the society. It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner cannot have any legitimate expectation against the state pertaining to a land that has been leased out by the JEDB. For a legitimate expectation to arise against the State, a representation should be made to the Petitioner by the State to the effect that the leased-out land would not be acquired. This argument could have been considered if the acquisition had been done for the JEDB or if the lessor was the State and the land was State land. Hence, the said contention has to fail.",

In 1975, with the Land Reform Commission law coming into operation and the said law being extended to cover company-owned plantations, the said company-owned plantations were vested in the Land Reform Commission. However, for better and productive management of the said lands with the creation of the JEDB, the said lands were vested with the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation and the JEDB. In the instant case before me, the land in question has been vested with the JEDB by Gazette Extraordinary No. 183/10 dated 12.03.1982 (P2). Thereafter, under the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987, came into operation and by the said law, the management and the movable property of the said estates were vested with the Petitioner company by Gazette Extraordinary No. 718/16 dated 11.06.1992 (P3). However, by this Gazette, the title of the land was not vested. Accordingly, the Petitioner argues that the land belongs to the JEDB and it is State land. Further, to substantiate the said argument, it is contended that the JEDB land is considered State land under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. Thus, it is argued that the State cannot acquire State land. In my view, this argument is not tenable as I have stated above, JEDB is a creature of a statute which makes it a statutory board. However, to evict illegal occupants and to take possession of the land belonging to the said statutory body, the JEDB land, for the purposes of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is considered as State land. In the instant case before this Court, the State has decided that a land is required to be acquired for public purposes, namely for the purposes of the development of the Uva Wellassa University. For this particular purpose, the State cannot take a land that is vested with the JEDB for the said public purpose. Therefore, correctly, the State has decided to acquire the required portion of 12 acres from the Wewasse Estate for the above-mentioned",

This would then enable the respondents to respond to the averments of fact and law raised by the Petitioner.
