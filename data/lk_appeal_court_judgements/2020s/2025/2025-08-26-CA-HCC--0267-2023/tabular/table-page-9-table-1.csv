"CA/HCC/ 267/23"
"After careful perusal of the evidence presented in the trial, I am of the view"
"that  the  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution  is  tainted  with  serious"
"shortcoming and ambiguity. Therefore, it is not safe to act on such evidence"
"of the prosecution against the appellant."
"Considering the evidence presented by the prosecution and the very serious"
"procedural  irregularities  taken  place  in  this  case,  I  concluded  that  the"
"grounds  of  appeal  advanced  by  the  Appellant  carry  sufficient  merit  to"
"substantiate awarding the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant."
"I,  therefore,  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  imposed  on  the"
"Appellant  by  the  learned  High  court  Judge  of  Kalutara.  The  Appellant  is"
"acquitted from the charge."
"The appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  High  Court  of  Kalutara"
"along with the original case record."
