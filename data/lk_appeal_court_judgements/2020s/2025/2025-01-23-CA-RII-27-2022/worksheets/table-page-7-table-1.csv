"subsequently owned by the Petitioner on the 11th of November 2018 as alleged. Therefore, the"
"order of the learned Magistrate of Bandarawela remains proper in law."
"In  the  case  of  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation  Ltd.  V.  Shanmugam  and  Another  (1995)  1"
"SLR 55,  Ranaraja J. held as follows;"
"“ Relief by way of Restitutio-in-Integrum in respect of judgments of original courts may"
"be sought:"
"(a)  where  judgments  have  been  obtained  by  fraud  by  the  production  of  false  evidence,"
"non-disclosure of material facts, or by force; or"
"(b) where fresh evidence has cropped up since judgments, which was unknown earlier to"
"the parties relying on it or which no diligence could have helped to disclose earlier, or"
"(c)  where  judgments  have  been  pronounced  by  mistake  and  decrees  entered  thereon"
"provided, of course, it is an error which connotes a reasonable and ""excusable error.”"
"Accordingly, when applied to  the facts  before us,  I do not  see any  reason to  interfere with  the"
"orders of the Learned Magistrate of Bandarawela. Further, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the"
"necessary threshold needed for invoking the jurisdiction of this court under Article 138(1) of the"
"Constitution. Therefore, the Court finds that there is no merit in the Petitioner‟s application."
"This  application  is  dismissed  with  a  cost  of  Rs.  50,000  payable  by  the  Petitioner  to  the  1st"
