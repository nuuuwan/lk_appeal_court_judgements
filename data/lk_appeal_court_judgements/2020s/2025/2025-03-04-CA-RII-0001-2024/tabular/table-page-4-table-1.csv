"action to a termination, the Court may dismiss the action: provided,"
"however, that in a case where the plaintiff fails or neglects to prosecute"
"a partition action, the Court may, by order permit any defendant to"
"prosecute the action and may substitute him as a plaintiff for the"
"purpose and may make such order as to costs as the Court may deem"
"fit"". (156)"
"One must not forget the fact, as the Court had (forgotten) that section 70"
"makes  it  imperative  or  mandatory,  before  the  action  is  dismissed,  that"
"(to quote the very  words of the section): the ""Court had endeavoured to"
"compel  the  parties  to  bring  the  action  to  a  termination"".  One  could  say"
"without fear of contradiction that there would have been, at least, some,"
"amongst the 60 odd parties, who would have been willing to go on with"
"the case had they been ""compelled"" more so as there was, in fact, very"
"little left to be done, as the interlocutory decree itself had been entered"
"on  12.4.1965,  ie  nearly  seven  years  prior  to  the  date  that  the  plaintiff"
"had been noticed to follow up. Even after the lapse of nearly 14 years,"
"after the notice  was served on the plaintiff to  which there had been no"
"response,  the  Court  had  been  content  to  let  the  case  idle  till  the  4th"
"defendant-respondent  made  the  application,  on  his  own,  that  he  be"
"permitted  to continue  the  action. Thus, it  will be seen  that  if the  action"
"had stagnated, without being prosecuted, the District Court had only to"
"thank  itself  for  that  and  I  cannot  bring  myself  to  believe  that  parties"
"should be penalized or inconvenienced by making an order of dismissal."
"I think it is superlatively right to say that the Latin Maxim: Actus curiae"
"neminem gravabit - should come to the rescue of this case, rather of the"
"parties, which maxim means that an act of the Court shall prejudice no"
"man. Where a delay in an action is the act or the omission of the Court,"
"no party shall suffer for it. (157)"
