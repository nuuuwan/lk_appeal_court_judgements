"grantâ€™ clearly signifies the conferring of a discretion. In contrast, Section"
"18, prohibits the sale of any excisable article without a licence obtained"
"from the Government Agent. Similarly, Section 19(2) prohibits a grantee"
"of  a  privilege  under  Section  19(1)  from  exercising  the  same  until  he"
"receives a licence from the Government Agent. Section 18 prohibits any"
"person from engaging in the sale of liquor without a licence from the"
"Government Agent. However, Section 18 does not expressly or otherwise"
"confer  a  discretion  on  the  Government  Agent  in  the  issuance  of  a"
"licence. The scheme of granting a licence under the Excise Ordinance"
"appears to be a combined effect of the operation of Sections 18 and 19."
"Thus  when  the  Commissioner  General  conveys  to  the  Government"
"Agent  of  his  decision  to  grant  the  privilege,  the  Government  Agent  is"
"required  to  issue  the  relevant  licence  in  the  prescribed  form,  upon"
"collecting any fee that may be levied"
