"issue of licences. Sections 18  and 19 reads as follows:"
"18. No excisable article shall be sold, or kept or exposed for sale,"
"without a licence from the Government Agent: Provided that –"

"manufacture  and  sell  toddy  under  this  Ordinance  or  to  a"
"person licensed under this Ordinance to manufacture arrack or"
"vinegar from toddy;"
