"Later, she was summoned by the Court to identify the document marked P4 which"
"was mentioned by PW9. According to PW1, she identified the document marked"
"P4. She stated that she had referred to the incident in the said letter which was"
"marked by the defence as V6 (a) and (b)."
"According to PW4, the Principal of the school, the prosecutrix gave a letter to them"
"on 23.11.2010 through her friend which is marked as P4.  According to her, one"
"uncle and two boys had abused the prosecutrix."
"The question that arises here is why she has failed to indicate the specific incident"
"which happened  two days prior  to  writing the  said letter. In  the  said letter she"
"mentioned the incidents which had happened some time ago and mentioned people"
"who  had  been  involved  and  simply  mentioned  about  an  uncle.  According  to"
"evidence given by the witnesses, teachers had seen the prosecutrix and her friend"
"inside  a  washroom.  Thereafter,  when  they  questioned  her,  she  revealed  what"
"happened to her and they asked her to put it into writing."
"The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the failure of the prosecutrix"
"to indicate the incident in the letter which happened two days prior.  A prudent"
"man  will  disclose  all  the  details  that  happened  in  the  recent  past  with  detail."
"According to her, this letter was given two days after the incident happened. The"
"question before us is why she has failed to disclose the incident in the said letter"
"where she has mentioned other people and not a single word about the Accused."
"There is no other evidence to corroborate her version of the story. It is true that"
"there is no need for corroboration to prove this type of offences. But our Courts"
"expect the evidence of the prosecution to be strong and consistent. In other words,"
