"Case of the appellant",""
"10. The  appellant  has  maintained","that  he  being  a  son  of  a  successful"
"","businessman, he was not in great need of money and that he was not pressed"
"to ask for money from PW02.",""
"11. The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the appellant argues that the appellant",""
"","has been convicted only of the first and second charges. Consequently, the"
"","appellant  would  have  to  focus  solely  on challenging  the  conviction  and  the"
"sentences imposed for the first and second charges only.",""
"12. The  journal  entry  dated  February  23,  2018,  indicates  that  the  disputed",""
"","judgment  has  been  delivered  in  open  Court  on  that  date.  The  learned  high"
"","court  judge  has  concluded  that  the  prosecution  has  established,  beyond  a"
"","reasonable doubt, that the appellant has committed the offences outlined in"
"","all three charges set forth in the indictment. As a result, the appellant has"
"been convicted of all three charges.",""
"13. In  contrast,  upon  reviewing  the  disputed  judgment  included  in  the  appeal",""
"","brief, it becomes clear that the appellant has been convicted only of the first"
"","two  charges.  When  this  discrepancy  is  compared  with  the  material  in  the"
"","disputed judgment and presented in the journal entry, it is evident that the"
"omission in the judgment is due to a typographical error.",""
"14. Despite this error in the disputed judgment, it is the view of this Court that it",""
"","has not resulted in a failure in justice.  Consequently, it does not expel the"
"","appellant from challenging the conviction and the sentence imposed for the"
"third charge in the indictment.",""
"15. The  learned  Presidents  Counsel  has  also  raised  concerns  regarding  the",""
"","implications of section 20(a) and section 20(b) of the Bribery Act No.11 of 1954"
"","(as  amended).  Specifically,  section  20(a)  addresses  the  offence  of  offering  a"
"","gratification, while section 20(b) pertains to solicitation and acceptance of a"
"","gratification  aimed  at  achieving  one  or  more  of  the  objectives  outlined  in"
"subsections (i) to (vii).",""
