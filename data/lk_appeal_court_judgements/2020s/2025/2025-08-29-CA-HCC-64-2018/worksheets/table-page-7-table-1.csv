"16. In this context, the decision of the respondent to combine the distinct conduct"
"described in section 20(a) and section 20(b) into a single charge; namely the"
"first  and  second  charges  in  the  indictment;  it  is  contended  has  resulted  in"
"prejudice to the appellant."
"17. The  appellant’s  dock  statement  constitutes  a  concerted  effort  to  refute  the"
"allegations outlined in the indictment against him. He has categorically denied"
"the allegations presented in the charges and has explained that his financial"
"standing,  stemming  from  inherited  wealth,  has  eliminated  any  need  for  the"
"actions of which he is accused."
"18. Accordingly, the  circumstances  surrounding  the  appellant’s  situation  do  not"
"suggest  that  he  was  misled  by  any  errors  in  the  particulars  stated  in  the"
"charges. The assertion that he acted without culpability due to his wealth does"
"not  show  any  significant  errors  in  stating  the  offences  in  the  charges  in  the"
"indictment  that  would  warrant  a  dismissal  of  the  charges.  Therefore,  the"
"alleged errors in the particulars do not rise to the level of being material enough"
"to undermine the appellant’s case or to prejudice him anyway."
"19. The provisions outlined in section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act"
"No.15 of 1979 are pertinent to the aforementioned instance."
"Section 166 is as follows;"
"“Any error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to"
"be stated in the charge and any omission to state the offence or these"
"particulars shall not be regarded at any stage of the case as material,"
"unless the accused was misled by such error or omission”."
"20.  The learned President’s Counsel has also argued that it was essential for the"
"prosecution to present compelling evidence demonstrating that PW02 was the"
"registered owner of the bus bearing registration number CP GO 2274. That this"
"evidence was crucial for substantiating the charges outlined in the indictment."
"However, since the prosecution has failed to establish this fact, the appellant"
"should be afforded the benefit of the doubt."
