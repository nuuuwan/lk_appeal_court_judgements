"his is an appeal preferred by the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to"
"as the Appellant) from the order of the Wakf Tribunal dated 29.04.2023."
"FACTUAL MATRIX IN A NUTSHELL"
"The  subject  matter  of  this  petition  concerns  a  mosque  situated  in  Eravur,  known  as  the"
"Valiyappa Thakkiya Mosque. A donor subsequently came forward, expressing his willingness"
"to renovate the mosque at his own expense, on the condition that the mosque be renamed as"
"""Mohideen Abdul Qadir Jailani Valiyappa Thakkiya Mosque."""
"Following this, the appellant sought approval from the Wakf Board for both the renovation"
"and the proposed name change. Initially, the Wakf Board refused the request. However, it"
"later reversed its decision and granted permission."
"Dissatisfied with this outcome, the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred"
"to as the Respondents) filed an appeal before the Wakf Tribunal. After hearing both parties,"
"the Tribunal set aside the Wakf Boardâ€™s order dated 02.12.2021, which had permitted the"
"name change. Furthermore, the Tribunal determined that the existing name of the mosque,"
"Waliyappa Thakkiya Mosque, should be retained."
"It  is  against  this  order  of  the  Wakf  Tribunal  that  the  appellants  have  now  preferred  the"
"present appeal."
