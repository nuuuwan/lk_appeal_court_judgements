The Board has further observed that his evidence pertaining to the Petitioner had been given under duress. This observation has not been contradicted by the Petitioner. It is also pertinent to note that the Board has considered the evidence that the said Wijedasa had initially occupied the premises as the tenant of the 7th Respondent\u2019s mother and had stayed in the same for a long time. Wijedasa has occupied the said premises under the Petitioner only for a year. While the Petitioner alleges that Wijedasa was his tenant, the 7th Respondent contended that Wijedasa was his mother\u2019s tenet and had been paying rent initially to the 7th Respondent\u2019s mother and subsequently to the 7th Respondent until the 7th Respondent had authorised the Petitioner to collect the rent to set off against the interest the 7th Respondent owed to the Petitioner pursuant to obtaining a loan.
