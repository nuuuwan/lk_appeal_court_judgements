"be redeemed by the debtor by virtue of any legally enforceable agreement between"
"him and his creditor."
"(1A)  The  Board  shall  not  entertain  any  application  by  a  debtor  or  creditor  in"

"application  is  made  within  three  years  of  the  date  of  the  notarially  executed"
"instrument, effecting such transfer: Provided that nothing in this subsection shall"
"be read or construed as preventing the Board from entertaining, after the period"

"the property transferred."
