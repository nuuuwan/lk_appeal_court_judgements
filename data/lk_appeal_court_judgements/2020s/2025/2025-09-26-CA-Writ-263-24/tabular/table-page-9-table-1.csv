"Has the Debt Conciliation Board made its own finding on possession?"
"T
he  Petitioner  contends  that  the  Board  has  failed  to  analyse  on  its  own  the  evidence"
"presented at the possessory inquiry and had depended on the findings of the Primary Court"
"and the High Court to come to the conclusion the Board has arrived at. Let me now consider"
"the Order marked as P7. In the said Order the Board has considered the judicial Orders"
"made by the Primary Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal. However, the Board"
"has also analysed the evidence presented by both parties on possession, independent of the"
"said Orders in arriving at its conclusion. This is evident throughout the Order, especially"
"on pages 295, 296, 297 and 298 of the brief. Hence, I am unable to agree with the learned"
"Counselâ€™s  contention  that  the  Board  had  failed  to  come  to  a  conclusion  of  its  own  on"
"possession."
