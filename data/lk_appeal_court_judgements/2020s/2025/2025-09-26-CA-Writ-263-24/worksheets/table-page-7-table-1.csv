"The learned Counsel for the 7th Respondent contended that in view of the said litigation the"
"7th Respondentâ€™s possession has been established. Reverting back to the proviso to section"
"19A(1A), it is clear that if an applicant had been in possession of the premises, the Board"
"can  entertain  an  application  notwithstanding  the  time  bar  imposed  pursuant  to  section"
"19(1A) of the Ordinance."
