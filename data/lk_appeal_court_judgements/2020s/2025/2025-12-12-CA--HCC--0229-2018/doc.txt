Judgment

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the appellant”) was indicted, along

with two other accused, for the murder of Godawatthage Lalith Susantha. They were

charged under Section 296 read together with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. The trial commenced before the learned Judge of the High Court without a jury. At the

trial, six witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution. All three accused gave dock

statements, and the Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Galle, as well as the

Registrar of the Magistrate’s Court of Galle, were called by the defense to testify.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the 1st accused (the

appellant in the present appeal) guilty of the charge, while acquitting the 2nd and 3rd

accused. Accordingly, the appellant was sentenced to death by the learned High Court

Judge. It is against this conviction and sentence that the appellant has preferred the

present appeal.

CA/HCC/0229/2018

4. At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, the counsel for the appellant

tendered written grounds of appeal. Although several grounds were enumerated

therein, many are interrelated and may be summarized as follows:

1. The judgment of the learned High Court Judge is contrary to section 283 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act;

2. The learned trial Judge has first come to the findings that the PW1 sole eye

witness is a credible witness before considering the other evidence of the

prosecution and the defense witnesses;

3. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the Government Analyst

Report on ballistic evidence marked as X creates a reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case;

4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of the

sole eye witness contradicts the Government Analyst Report, her evidence is

improbable and not credible as there exist material contradictions and

omissions. Her evidence contradicts medical evidence and also, she is an

interested witness; and,

5. The learned trial Judge has failed to call the defense of the accused-appellant

as per Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code.

5. The sole eyewitness, PW1, is the mother of the deceased. According to her testimony,

on the day of the incident she had gone to pick flowers at a land known as

Pattanbugodawatta. The deceased had also gone there to play elle. While PW1 was

seated on a log, she observed the deceased approaching the land from a nearby paddy

field in the company of a friend named Ajith. At that moment, the appellant

approached the deceased from behind, followed by the second and third accused.

Suddenly, the appellant fired a shot at the deceased, causing him to fall to the ground.

Thereafter, the appellant fired another shot, upon which the deceased’s friend fled.

PW1 then fell unconscious. On the same day, around 6.00 p.m., PW1 lodged a

complaint with the Ratgama Police.

6. First, I shall consider the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grounds of appeal together, as they are

interrelated. These grounds primarily pertain to the assessment of the evidence, the

alleged contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, and the weight

CA/HCC/0229/2018

4 | P a g e

given to the dock statements of the accused. It is necessary to examine whether the

learned High Court Judge correctly evaluated the evidence in its entirety, giving due

regard to any omissions or inconsistencies, and whether any such discrepancies are

material enough to affect the safety of the conviction.

7. In doing so, I will also assess whether the learned trial Judge properly considered the

defense evidence and the credibility of the witnesses called by the accused. It was

emphasized on behalf of the appellant that the learned High Court Judge failed to

consider the material omissions and contradictions in PW1’s evidence which go to the

root of the prosecution case. It was further contended that the Post-Mortem Report

and the Government Analyst’s Report contradict PW1’s testimony, and therefore it is

unsafe to base a conviction solely on her evidence.

8. The concept of contradiction in criminal jurisprudence cannot be confined within a

rigid definition, as its significance necessarily varies from case to case. It is the duty

of the Court to assess whether a particular contradiction is trivial, or whether it is

sufficiently material to undermine the reliability of a witness’s testimony. In

undertaking this exercise, the Court must consider the contradictions in the broader

context of the entire body of the witness’s evidence and assess them holistically in

order to arrive at a rational and just conclusion.

9. Therefore, contradictions which have no material effect on the veracity of the

prosecution case should not be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution

case.

10. The following authorities have articulated the principles governing how courts should

assess the presence of contradictions, omissions, and minor inconsistencies when

evaluating evidence:

11. In The Attorney General v.Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR 292 the

court held that:

“Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect the

trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that the Court must

exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency or contradiction and

whether they are true material to the facts in issue”.

CA/HCC/0229/2018

5 | P a g e

12. In the case of Mohamed Niyas Naufer and others v. Attorney General (Sc. 01/2006

decided on 08/12/2006), the Court observed that;

“when faced with contradictions in a witness's testimonial, the Court must

bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions, viewed in light

of the whole of the evidence given by the witness."

13. While appreciating the evidence, the court has to take into consideration whether the

contradictions/omissions had been of such magnitude that they may materially affect

the trial. Minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on

trivial matters without effecting the core of the prosecution case should not be made a

ground to reject the evidence in its entirety. The Trial Court, after going through the

entire evidence, must form an opinion about the credibility of the witnesses and the

appellate Court in normal course would not be justified in reviewing the same again

without justifiable reasons. (Vide: State Represented by Inspector of Police v.

Saravanan & Anr., AIR 2009 SC 152).

14. In State of Rajasthan v. Smt. Kalki & Anr., AIR 1981 SC 1390, while dealing with

this issue, the Supreme Court observed as under:

"In the depositions of witnesses there are always normal discrepancies,

however honest and truthful they may be. These discrepancies are due to

normal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time,

due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of the

occurrence, and the like. Material discrepancies are those which are not

normal, and not expected of a normal person."

15. In exceptional cases where there are compelling circumstances, and the judgment

under appeal is found to be perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order of

acquittal. The findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to be perverse if the

findings have been arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking

into consideration irrelevant/inadmissible material. A finding may also be said to be

perverse if it is `against the weight of evidence', or if the finding so outrageously

defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality. Balak Ram & Anr. v. State of

U.P., AIR 1974 SC 2165;

CA/HCC/0229/2018

16. The instant case is required to be examined in light of the aforesaid legal principles.

First, I shall consider whether there exist any material omissions or contradictions in

the testimony of the sole eyewitness which go to the root of the case and may have

escaped the attention of the learned trial Judge. I will also examine whether her

evidence is inconsistent with the medical and ballistic evidence contained in the Post-

Mortem Report and the Government Analyst’s Report respectively, and whether such

inconsistencies, if any, render her testimony untrustworthy.

17. As can be observed from the evidence of the eyewitness and the medical evidence, the

murder had been committed by shooting, and the incident occurred in the year 2001.

The trial before the High Court commenced only in 2013, that is, 12 years after the

incident. Hence, it would be unreasonable to expect PW1 to recount the events with

photographic accuracy. The presence of minor discrepancies, omissions, or

contradictions attributable to the natural fading of memory over time is therefore to be

expected in her testimony.

18. The defence marked eight contradictions during the cross-examination of PW1. The

contradictions marked as D1 to D4 pertain to previous cases pending against the

deceased and therefore do not go to the root of the present case. In other words, none

of these contradictions undermine the credibility of PW1’s evidence regarding the

events that occurred on the day of the incident.

19. Contradiction D5 concerns whether the deceased was already present when PW1 went

to the land to pick flowers, or whether he arrived while PW1 was sitting on a log. D6

relates to whether the deceased was talking to Ajith and Paul at the time he was shot.

D7 concerns whether PW1 was picking flowers or sitting on a log at the time of the

shooting. D8 challenges the number of shots fired at the deceased.

20. A careful consideration of these contradictions reveals that they pertain only to

peripheral or collateral aspects of PW1’s testimony. None of them strike at the core of

the prosecution’s narrative regarding the identity of the assailant or the essential

sequence of events leading to the shooting. Therefore, these contradictions cannot be

regarded as material enough to discredit PW1’s evidence or to create a reasonable

doubt in the prosecution case.

CA/HCC/0229/2018

7 | P a g e

21. It was also suggested to PW1 that she had never mentioned in her police statement

that she was seated on a log watching the deceased play elle, and this was highlighted

as an omission. However, for the reasons stated above, I am not inclined to treat this

as a material omission that diminishes the credibility of PW1’s evidence.

22. It is trite law that not every inconsistency or omission in the testimony of a witness is

fatal to the prosecution. Courts have repeatedly emphasized that minor variations,

particularly those attributable to the passage of time, do not erode the credibility of a

witness unless they strike at the very core of the prosecution’s version. Human

recollection is inherently fallible, and with the lapse of many years, such as in the

present case, some degree of discrepancy is not only natural but inevitable. What the

court must determine is whether the alleged contradictions pertain to material

particulars that fundamentally undermine the prosecution case, or whether they are

merely trivial deviations that do not affect the reliability of the witness on the central

narrative.

23. So far as the question of inconsistency between medical evidence and ocular evidence

is concerned, the law is well settled that, unless the oral evidence available is totally

irreconcilable with the medical evidence, the oral evidence would have primacy. In

the event of contradictions between medical and ocular evidence, the ocular testimony

of a witness will have greater evidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence and when

medical evidence makes the oral testimony improbable, the same becomes a relevant

factor in the process of evaluation of such evidence. It is only when the contradiction

between the two is so extreme that the medical evidence completely rules out all

possibilities of the ocular evidence being true at all, that the ocular evidence is liable

to be disbelieved. (Vide: State of U.P. v. Hari, (2009) 13 SCC 542; and Bhajan Singh

@ Harbhajan Singh & Ors. v. State of Haryana, (2011) 7 SCC 421).

24. It is a settled legal proposition that while appreciating the evidence of a witness,

minor discrepancies on trivial matters, which do not affect the core of the

prosecution's case, may not prompt the Court to reject the evidence in its entirety.

"Irrelevant details which do not in any way corrode the credibility of a witness cannot

be labelled as omissions or contradictions. Supreme Court of India. Bhajan Singh @

Harbhajan Singh & Ors vs State of Haryana on 2011 (7) SCC 421

CA/HCC/0229/2018

8 | P a g e

25. " Difference in some minor detail, which does not otherwise affect the core of the

prosecution case, even if present, would not itself prompt the court to reject the

evidence on minor variations and discrepancies. After exercising care and caution and

sifting through the evidence to separate truth from untruth, exaggeration and

improvements, the court comes to a conclusion as to whether the residuary evidence is

sufficient to convict the accused. Thus, an undue importance should not be attached to

omissions, contradictions and discrepancies which do not go to the heart of the matter

and shake the basic version of the prosecution witness. As the mental capabilities of a

human being cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb all the details, minor

discrepancies are bound to occur in the statements of witnesses. [Vide: Vijay @

Chinee v. State of M.P., (2010) 8 SCC 191;

26. A very great South African judge. Curlewis J. A., in the case of R. v. Hepworth, 1928

A.D. 265, 277 once said:

"A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim the benefit of

any omission or mistake made by the other side. and a judge's position in a

criminal trial is not merely that of an umpire to see that the rules of the game

are observed by both sides. A judge is an administrator of justice, he is not

merely a figure head, he has not only to direct and control the proceedings

according to recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done."

27. It is also significant to emphasize that this was not an incident that unfolded step by

step, allowing the witness to observe each stage slowly and carefully. Therefore, it

cannot reasonably be expected of a lay witness of PW1’s calibre to precisely state the

number of shots fired at the deceased based solely on the sound of gunfire,

particularly given that the shots were fired in rapid succession.

28. In these circumstances, the inconsistency in PW1’s evidence regarding the number of

shots fired cannot, in my view, be regarded as a material contradiction that

undermines the credibility of PW1.

29. Another argument advanced by the appellant is that the Government Analyst’s Report,

marked as ‘X’ by the defence, contradicts the evidence of PW1 and establishes that

the empty cartridges recovered from the scene of the murder were not discharged

CA/HCC/0229/2018

9 | P a g e

from the pistol marked as P3. It was therefore contended that this discrepancy strikes

at the root of the prosecution case. It was further submitted that, since there is no

evidence relating to the recovery of the pistol marked as P3, such evidence cannot, in

any event, support the conviction.

30. It is correct that the prosecution has not adduced any evidence as to how the pistol

was recovered or from whose possession it was recovered. In these circumstances,

any evidence relating to this weapon becomes irrelevant to the determination of the

appellant’s culpability, particularly since there is no material to connect the recovery

of the weapon to the appellant. Moreover, it is of considerable significance that the

pistol marked P3 was not conclusively identified by PW1 as the firearm used in the

commission of the offence. Her evidence was only that the weapon used was similar

in appearance to P3. She stated as follows:

ප්රa : ඔබ සඳහන් කලා පළවෙනි චූදිතයා අවේ ඔබ පිස්වතෝලයක් තිවයනො

දැක්කා කියලා ?

උ : ඔව්.

ප්රa : දැන් මා ඔබට වපන්ෙනො යම් නඩු භාණ්ඩයක්. ඒ ඔබ සඳහන් කරපු

භාණ්ඩය සමඟ සැසවදනෙද ?

උ : ඔව් වමය තමයි.

ප්රa : ඔබ සඳහන් කලා කළු වකොට ආයුධයක් කියලා ?

උ : ඔව්.

ප්රa : වමෙැනි ආයුධයක් ද තිබුවණ් ?

උ : ඔව්.

Vide pages 122 and 123 of the briefs

31. More importantly, PW1’s evidence must be evaluated in the context of a lay witness,

and not held to the standard expected of an expert. At the time of the shooting, she

had only a few seconds to observe the events, and no real opportunity to examine the

weapon. In other words, her observation of the weapon was made at a fleeting glance.

Therefore, it would be unreasonable to expect PW1 to identify, with precision at the

trial, the exact firearm used in the commission of the offence. What is material is that

PW1 witnessed the shooting, and the medical evidence conclusively establishes that

the deceased died as a result of gunshot injuries.

CA/HCC/0229/2018

10 | P a g e

32. Accordingly, the pistol marked P3 has little relevance to the determination of this

case. In the circumstances, the absence of evidence linking P3 to the shooting, as well

as the minor discrepancy in PW1’s identification of the weapon, does not, in my view,

erode the credibility of her testimony nor diminish the strength of the prosecution

case.

33. In the submissions filed on 01.07.2019, it was contended that the remanding of the

witness, Palitha Silva (PW2), denied the appellant a fair trial. It appears that the

prosecution had made an application to cross-examine PW2 in terms of Section 154

of the Evidence Ordinance, as he was evasive during his testimony. At the conclusion

of his evidence, the learned Trial Judge ordered that PW2 be remanded.

34. The appellant placed considerable reliance on Ranasingha Arachchilage Edmand

Perera v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka CA 267/06 and R.M.S.

Priyantha Rathnayake v. Attorney-General CA 41/2012, where it was held that

remanding a witness for not giving evidence in accordance with the statement made to

the police amounts to a serious and substantial miscarriage of justice, as it may create

a fearful impression among other witnesses that they too would be remanded if they

failed to testify in conformity with their police statements.

35. However, in the present case, PW2 was remanded only after his testimony had been

fully concluded. Moreover, no lay witness was called to testify thereafter. Therefore,

even if the learned Trial Judge’s decision to remand PW2 could be considered an

abuse of power, it has neither instilled fear in any witness nor denied the appellant a

fair trial.

36. Furthermore, PW2’s evidence related only to the arrest of the 2nd and 3rd accused,

and not to the arrest of the appellant. It is also noteworthy that the learned High Court

Judge has not relied upon or taken into account the evidence of PW2. Thus, PW2’s

testimony has no bearing whatsoever on the conviction of the appellant.

37. It was also argued that the learned High Court Judge has failed to call the defense of

the accused-appellant as per Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

38. Apparently, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the record does not indicate that

the learned High Court Judge complied with section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act by explaining to all the accused their right to call evidence. However,

CA/HCC/0229/2018

11 | P a g e

the proceedings dated 04.03.2015 show that defence counsel informed the Court of

his intention to lead evidence on behalf of the defence and, accordingly, would file a

list of witnesses. Thereafter, on 17.06.2015, permission was sought to file an amended

list of witnesses, and it was further stated that the accused would also testify. On

10.07.2017, both the prosecution and the defence agreed to adopt the evidence

recorded before the previous judges and proceed thereafter before the presiding Judge

at that time. On 17.05.2018, all three accused made dock statements, and on

06.06.2018, two witnesses testified on behalf of the defence, after which the defence

case was concluded.

39. It is true that the learned trial Judge has not expressly recorded compliance with

Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Nevertheless, all three accused

were represented by an Attorney-at-Law throughout the trial. It is noteworthy that

they were well aware of their right to call evidence and were, in fact, afforded the

opportunity to do so. Had the trial Judge not formed the view that there were grounds

to proceed with the trial after the close of the prosecution case, or had he failed to

explain to the accused their right to lead evidence, there would have been no necessity

for counsel to tender a list of witnesses intended to be called on behalf of the accused.

More importantly, given the strength of the prosecution evidence, any reasonable trial

Judge could not have done anything other than call for the defence.

40. In these circumstances, the mere absence of a recorded explanation under Section

200(1) cannot, by itself, be construed as causing prejudice to the accused. The

conduct of the defence throughout the proceedings demonstrates that they were fully

aware of the procedural stage of the trial and of their entitlement to adduce evidence.

41. The defence not only indicated their intention to call witnesses but also sought

permission to amend the witness list and ultimately led two witnesses in addition to

making dock statements. This active participation clearly indicates that the accused

were not disadvantaged or misled as to their rights. Therefore, the omission to

explicitly record compliance with Section 200(1), although undesirable, does not

amount to a fatal irregularity that vitiates the trial.

42. What is discernible from the prosecution evidence and the proceedings of the High

Court is that the learned trial Judge, while affording the accused the opportunity to

present their defence, has failed to formally record the calling of the defence. In my

CA/HCC/0229/2018

12 | P a g e

view, this omission, though procedurally undesirable, has not caused any prejudice to

the accused nor resulted in any substantial injustice, particularly in light of the fact

that they were duly represented by counsel throughout the trial. The record clearly

reflects that the accused were aware of their right to lead evidence and that they

exercised that right without hindrance. Hence, the mere failure to record the formal

calling of the defence does not, in the circumstances of this case, amount to a fatal

irregularity.

43. In the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the Constitution of our

country provide provisions to rectify any error, omission or irregularity in a judgment

where such error, omission or irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial

right of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. Section 436 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979 states as follows:

“Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment passed by a

court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on appeal or

revision on account- (a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other proceedings

before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this code;

or (b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135, Unless such error,

omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a failure of justice.” [

Emphasis added]

44. Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka states:

“The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all

errors in fact or in law which shall be [committed by the High Court, in the

exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First

Instance], tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things [of which such High Court, Court of First

Instance] tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance: Provided

that no judgment, decree, or order of any court shall be revised or varied on

account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the

substantial right of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice”. [

Emphasis added]

CA/HCC/0229/2018

13 | P a g e

45. Therefore, in my opinion, the failure of the Trial Judge to record the steps taken in

compliance with Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act has neither

caused any substantial injustice to the appellant nor occasioned any miscarriage of

justice at the trial.

46. The next ground to be considered is whether the judgment of the learned Trial Judge

complies with Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It was further

submitted that the learned Trial Judge erred in concluding that the evidence of PW1

was consistent with the medical evidence. It must be noted, however, that PW8

testified that the fatal injuries sustained by the deceased were caused by a firearm.

This is entirely consistent with the evidence of PW1, who stated that the appellant

shot the deceased with a firearm. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge’s conclusion in

this regard cannot be considered erroneous.

47. It appears that the learned Trial Judge has not analysed the evidence of PW1 in detail.

Nevertheless, he has taken into consideration the promptness with which PW1 made

his statement to the police and concluded that the contradictions and omissions

highlighted by the defence in PW1’s testimony do not go to the root of the

prosecution case.

48. Furthermore, the learned Trial Judge has considered the dock statement but

incorrectly observed that the appellant had not challenged the evidence that he fled to

a nearby thicket after the incident and was arrested on the following day. In fact,

during cross-examination, the appellant specifically disputed the prosecution’s version

of his arrest. In any event, it is impossible to infer that any reasonable judge could

have reached a different conclusion regarding the appellant’s guilt, even if the

evidence had been analyzed in greater detail.

49. Therefore, it is my considered view that, despite the presence of some minor

contradictions and omissions, the prosecution’s evidence, when considered in its

entirety, is sufficient to safely secure the conviction of the appellant, notwithstanding

the appellant’s submission that the prosecution failed to prove the charge beyond a

reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/0229/2018

14 | P a g e

50. It is also desirable to emphasize that the presence of minor contradictions or

omissions in a witness’s testimony does not necessarily create a reasonable doubt in

the prosecution’s case. While it is true that the prosecution is required to prove the

charges against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, this does not mean the

standard extends to fanciful or imaginary doubts. In this regard following authorities

are of much relevance.

51. In Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1973 SC 2622, the

Supreme Court of India has commented that,

“the cherished principles of the golden thread of proof beyond reasonable

doubt which runs through the web of our law should not be stretched morbidly

to embrace every hunch and degree of doubt. … Only reasonable doubts

belong to the accused. Otherwise, any practical system of justice will break

down and lose credibility with the community.”

52. In Dharm Das Wadhwani v. The State of Uttar Pradesh, 1974 Cri. LJ (SC) 1249, the

Supreme Court of India has observed that,

“… The rule of benefit of reasonable doubt does not imply a frail willow bending

to every whiff of hesitancy. Judges are made of sterner stuff and must take a

practical view of legitimate inferences flowing from evidence, circumstantial or

direct. …”

53. In Wijesekera (Excise Inspector) v Arnolis, (1940) [17 CLW 138], Justice

Wijeyewardene has held that

“… it is not every kind of doubt the benefit of which an accused person is

entitled. An accused person could claim only the benefit of a reasonable doubt.

It is always possible to conjure up a doubt of a very flimsy nature. But an

accused person cannot be acquitted on the ground of such doubt…The guilt or

innocence of an accused person must be determined on evidence and not on

some suggestion made in the course of an argument…”.

CA/HCC/0229/2018

15 | P a g e

54. In Miller v. Minister of Pensions, [(1947) 2 A.E.R. 372] Lord Denning has explained

what proof beyond reasonable doubt is, in the following lucid manner:

“…Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of

a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful

possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against

a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be

dismissed with the sentence, ‘of course it is possible, but not in the least

probable’, the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of

that will suffice.”

55. Upon the above analysis of the law and facts, in light of the grounds of appeal, I find

no merit in the arguments advanced by the defence. Accordingly, I see no reason to

interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. In the circumstances, I

hereby dismiss the appeal.
