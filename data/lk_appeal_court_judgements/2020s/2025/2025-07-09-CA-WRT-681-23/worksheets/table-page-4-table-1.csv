"6.  When this matter was taken up, the learned State Counsel appearing"
"for  the  1st  and  2nd  respondents  took  up  the  legal  objections  that  the"
"petitioner  lacks  locus  standi,  that  necessary  parties  have  not  been"
"named,  that  the  alleged  decision  to  be  quashed  is  not  annexed  or"
"produced and that the document A-11 does not contain a decision."
"Applicable law"
"7.  The petitioner’s primary argument is that the Divisional Secretary erred"
"in applying the provisions of the LDO as amended by Act No. 11 of 2022"
"in determining the issue of succession. Assuming that A-11 refers to a"
"decision, it is if at all the finding that the 3rd respondent is the successor"
"to the said holding based on the provisions of the LDO as amended by"
"Act No. 11 of 2022. The learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that"
"the  determination  of  the  successor 
in  accordance  with  the  Third"
"Schedule as amended by the Act No. 11 of 2022 is erroneous. This Act"
"amended the original Schedule and the order of succession. Prior to the"
"amendment, the eldest male son was the preferred successor. However,"
"upon  the  amendment,  the  eldest  child  was  considered,  whereby  the"
"gender  bias  was  rectified.  Mr.  Muthukumarana 
for  the  petitioner"
"argued that as reflected in paragraph 2 of A-11, the determination of"
"the successor had been made on the provisions of the LDO as amended"
"by Act No. 11 of 2022. As the original permit holder died in 1994, he"
"argues that the pre-amended provisions were applicable and the eldest"
"surviving  son  should  be  the  legitimate successor.  The  4th  respondent"
"happens  to  be  the  son  of  Piyasena,  the  eldest  son  of  Gimarahamy."
"Piyasena  was 
living  at  the  time  of  Gimarahamy’s  death  but  died"
"subsequently without seeking nomination."
"8.  The  3rd  respondent,  Seelawathi  is  the  eldest  surviving  child,  but  is  a"
"daughter  Piyasena,  being 
the  eldest  son  of  Gimarahamy, 
though"
"younger to the 3rd respondent, happened to be the eldest surviving male"
"successor  at  the  time  of  the  death  of  Gimarahamy.  As  such  it  is  the"
"petitioner’s  position  that  determining  the  3rd  respondent  to  be  the"
