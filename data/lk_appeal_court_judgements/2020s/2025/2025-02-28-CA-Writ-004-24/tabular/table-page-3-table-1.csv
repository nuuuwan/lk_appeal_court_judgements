"served  with  a  vacation  of  post  letter  dated  09.01.2023.  The  Petitioner  submitted  his"
"appeal papers to the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent, the Senior Superintendent of"
"Police Ampara rejected the appeal. Hence this Application."
"T
he Petitioner’s grievance"
"T
he Petitioner submits that the letter whereby the Petitioner is sent on vacation of post"
"is bad in law or ultra vires. Let me now consider the Petitioner’s submissions. At this"
"stage,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that,  throughout  the  Petition,  the  dates  reflected  in  the"
"paragraph does not seem to be correct. However, the learned Counsel appearing for the"
"Petitioner failed to make any application to correct the same. It is the contention of the"
"Petitioner  that  he  had  gone  to  Saudi  Arabia  for  a  week  to  assess  the  availability  of"
"employment opportunities. Upon inquiry by the Court, the learned Counsel submitted"
"that no leave was obtained to go overseas. However, he further submitted that upon his"
"return, he had continuously worked for five months and drawn his salary. This Court"
"observes that the document marked as P3 is a document produced and relied on by the"
"Petitioner, which is an appeal to the National Police Commission written by the wife of"
"the  Petitioner.  The  said  document  gives  a  completely  different  narration  about  the"
"Petitioner  going  abroad.  In  the  said  letter  it is  conceded  that  the  Petitioner  has  gone"
"abroad  without  permission  and  as  per  the  contents  of  the  said  letter  he  had  gone  on"
"21.05.2022 and returned on 02.06.2022. The said letter further states that the Petitioner"
"has  gone  to  Dubai  due  to  his  brother’s  illness.  This  is  a  glaring  contradiction  to  the"
"paragraph in the Petition and affidavit tendered to this Court. The Petitioner failed to"
"disclose this contradiction and as per the failure to clarify this contradiction, the only"
"conclusion this Court can arrive at is that the Petitioner has not come to this Court with"
"clean hands. In our view the Petitioner has fails the uberrima fides.  Hence the Petitioner"
"disentitles himself to the reliefs he seeks by way of a Writ Application. In coming to"
"the conclusion, we have considered the following cases."
"I
n the case of W. S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettictrachchi (1973) 22 NLR 77 it was"
"held that,"
"“when an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is made, it is the"
"duty of the petitioner to place before the Court, before it issues notice in the first"
"instance, a full and truthful disclosure of all the material facts; the petitioner"
"must act with uberrima fides.”"
