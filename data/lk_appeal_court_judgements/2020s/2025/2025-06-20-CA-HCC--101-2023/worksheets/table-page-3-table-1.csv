"CA/HCC/0101/23"
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  aforesaid  conviction  and  sentence  the  Appellant"
"preferred this appeal to this court."
"The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant"
"has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument"
"he was connected via Zoom from prison."
"At  the  very  outset  of  the  argument  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant"
"informed  this  Court  that  the  Appellant  is  only  contesting  the  sentence"
"imposed  to  run  consecutively  in  relation  to  the  three  counts  where  the"
"Appellant had pleaded guilty."
"The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows."
"The  prosecutrix  in  this  case  was  living  with  her  sister  as  her  mother  had"
"employed in Colombo. Using this opportunity the Appellant had raped her"
"several times. As the appellant threatened her that he would harm her family"
"members, she remained silent until she was found pregnant."
"The  victim  was  15  years  old  when  she  was  raped  by  the  Appellant.  The"
"Appellant was 47 years old when he committed this offence."
"When a person accused of a crime pleads guilty or has been found guilty, the"
"judge orders a sentence.  The judge takes several factors into account when"
"deciding on a sentence, including the circumstances surrounding the crime"
"and the situation of the person who committed the crime."
"The sentence must be in proportion to the seriousness of the crime.  The law"
"establishes  how  serious  a  crime  is  by  providing  different  sentences  for"
"different  types  of  crimes.    This  means  lighter  sentences  for  less  serious"
"crimes  and  heavier  sentences  for  more  serious  crimes.    According  to  the"
"principle of fairness in sentencing, the sentence must be just."
"As in other countries, no sentencing guidelines have been formulated in our"
"jurisdiction.    Therefore,  sentencing  is  the  prerogative  of  the  court  in  our"
"jurisdiction."
