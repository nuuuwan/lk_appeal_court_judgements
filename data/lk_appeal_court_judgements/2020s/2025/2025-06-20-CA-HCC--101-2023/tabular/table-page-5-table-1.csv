"CA/HCC/0101/23"
"The Appellant pleaded guilty to the indictment, thus saved valuable time of"
"the court. Further, now the Appellant is 58 years old and a married person"
"with two children. The victim also settled and having a good family life."
"Considering all the factors into consideration, I think this is an appropriate"
"case to order the sentence imposed to run concurrently. Therefore, I order"
"the 12 years of rigorous imprisonment for each count to run concurrently."
"Fines,  compensation  and  default  sentence  imposed  on  the  Appellant  shall"
"remain same."
"Considering  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  is  in  remand  from  the  date  of"
"conviction, I, order the sentence imposed on the Appellant be operative from"
"the date of sentence namely, 16.02.2023."
"Therefore, the conviction  is affirmed and  the sentence  is varied up to that"
"extent. The Appeal is partly allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Hambantota along with the original case record."
