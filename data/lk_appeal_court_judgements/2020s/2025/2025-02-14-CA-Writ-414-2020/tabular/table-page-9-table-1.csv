"17. While the Petitioners have tried to counter the 7th Respondent's position by referencing"
"their letter P9, which acknowledges certain errors and defects and requests relief from the"
"Deputy  General  Manager  of  Human  Resources,  this 
letter  does  not  prevent  the  7th"
"Respondent  from  later reaching  a  contrary  conclusion regarding the  errors  and defects"
"they initially highlighted."
"18. The  Petitioners,  have  not  specifically  submitted  what  constitute 
the 
irregularities,"
"mistakes, translation discrepancies and the questions that were not in line with the  P4"
"Syllabus. It appears that for this purpose the Petitioners had relied on P9 however, this"
"letter is not supported by its author."
"19. The 5th Respondent, who prepared the question paper, has denied the allegations made"
"in paragraph 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the Petitions concerning irregularities and/or mistakes"
"and/or  translation  discrepancies,  and  questions  not  being  in  line  with  the  P4  Syllabus."
"Similarly,  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  has  also  denied  the  same.  Even  if  P9  had  been"
"accepted by the 7th Respondent, this Court is unable to determine the truth of the claims"
"given the rejections by the 1st to 5th Respondents."
"20. Even if, in response to prayer (f), the papers from the impugned examination were made"
"available  to  the  Court,  it  would  still  be  impossible  for  the  Court  to  determine  whether"
"there were errors, defects, or nonconformities with the syllabus  without conducting an"
"inquiry. The Court cannot issue an order compelling a public institution to perform an act"
"based on disputed or uncertain facts."
"Reliefs prayed for is untenable"
"21. The  relief  sought  in  prayer  (c)  is  to  pass  all  candidates  that  sat  for the examination  on"
"consideration of the several discrepancies and anomalies in the examination paper and"
"results given therein. The justification for this request appears to be on the premise that"
"all the candidates that were unsuccessful was solely unsuccessful because of the above"
"stated discrepancies and anomalies. However, if the 1st Respondent is to accede to this"
"request, 
it  needs  ensure 
that  no 
candidate  was  unsuccessful  because  of 
their"
"incompetency,  as 
it  would  be  contrary  to  the  basis  submitted  by  the  Petitioners."
