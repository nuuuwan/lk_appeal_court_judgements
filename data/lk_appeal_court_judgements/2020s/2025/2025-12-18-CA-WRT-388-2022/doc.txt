Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

1] The 1st Petitioner, a company operating “The Coffee Bungalow Kandy” on

Rajapihilla Mawatha, and the 2nd Petitioner, the owner of that property and a

director of the 1st Petitioner, challenge what they describe as an unlawful and

hazardous construction at No. 12, Mahamaya Mawatha, named as Grand

Serendib Hotel, within the Kandy World Heritage City. Their renovated

bungalow, dating to the 1860s, depends significantly on its historic setting and

“picturesque view,” which they assert is now imperilled by the erection of a six-

floor structure with a high roof reaching approximately 22 metres in height.

2] It is seen by pleadings, beginning in April 2019, the Petitioners engaged in

extensive correspondence with several state authorities—including the Urban

Development Authority (UDA)—after obtaining information on the applicable

Page6

planning and building regulations (P6(a), P6(b), P8–P25). Their concerns

intensified following the Buwelikada building collapse in September 2020, which

they believed raised analogous risks in respect of the Mahamaya Mawatha

construction; a related news article was annexed as P31, P30(a), P30(b), P30(c).

3] The Petitioners’ persistent efforts precipitated the appointment of a seven-

member investigation committee by the State Ministry of Urban Development.

In response to a Right to Information request submitted by the 2nd Petitioner

(P32), the 1st Respondent disclosed the committee’s report on 30/05/2022

(P34). The committee unanimously confirmed several serious violations of the

applicable UDA regulations, including: the construction of 24,097 sq. ft. where

only 3,491 sq. ft. was permitted (Regulation 13(c)); a land area of merely 25.65

perches where 40 perches were required for a development on that gradient

(Regulation 15(3)); and a site coverage exceeding 65% where the permissible

limit was 40% (Regulation 24). The committee also determined that the

purported three “basements” were, in fact, ground or lower-ground floors,

resulting in an unlawful increase in the number of floors.

4] The Said Committee recommended disciplinary action against officers

involved in approving the plans contrary to the regulations. Despite follow-up

letters from the 2nd Petitioner dated 06/06/2022 (P35) and 01/07/2022 (P36),

the UDA failed to take any steps to ensure compliance. Meanwhile, the Central

Environmental Authority had commenced separate environmental-violation

proceedings (Case No. 32102/21; P37), and a further report obtained around

January/February 2022 revealed irregularities in issuing permits,

recommending disciplinary measures and possible proceedings under the

Bribery and Corruption Act. The construction also contravened

recommendations by the State Engineering Corporation concerning structural

safety, particularly in relation to the so-called basements.

Page7

5] In these circumstances, the Petitioners seek urgent interim and final relief to

prevent what they characterise as continuing unlawful construction posing a

grave threat to public safety and the integrity of their adjacent heritage property.

They assert that the failure of the 1st to 3rd Respondents to exercise their

statutory powers—particularly under Section 28A of the Urban Development

Authority Law—to demolish the offending structure or compel conformity results

in an ongoing violation of their rights and a significant public health hazard.

Despite repeated written appeals, including letters dated 29/08/2022,

08/09/2022, and 19/10/2022 to the 10th Respondent and the Chairman of the

UDA, the Petitioners fear that the authorities are instead attempting to grant

illegal approvals or certificates of conformity, which would render any eventual

judicial relief nugatory. Accordingly, they request orders directing the 1st

Respondent to demolish the unlawful construction or bring it into regulatory

conformity, restraining the issuance of further approvals, and compelling the

production of all relevant correspondence and documents from the Respondents

to ensure a just and lawful outcome. Above was the case of the Petitioner.

6] The Petitioners pray for the following reliefs;

a. Issuing Notice on the Respondents

b. Calling for the record pertaining to this matter, including all

correspondence, reports, approvals, certificates, permits, correspondence

and other documents in the possession of the relevant respondents

(including all reports made with regard to the construction at No. 12,

Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy, including the report made in or around

January or February 2022 at the request of the Urban Development

Authority, and all reports/ recommendations made by the State

Engineering Corporation with regard to the said construction or such

other appropriate order

c. Issuing an interim order, restraining and/or prohibiting the relevant

respondents or their representatives, agents, assigns or anyone acting

Page8

under their authority from taking any steps towards granting a certificate

of conformity to the building being constructed on No.12, Mahamaya

Mawatha, Kandy, or such other appropriate order, until the final hearing

and determination of this application

d. Issuing a Writ of Prohibition, restraining and/or prohibiting the relevant

respondents and/ or their representatives, agents, assigns or anyone

acting under their authority from taking any steps towards granting a

certificate of conformity to the building being constructed on No.12,

Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy, or such other appropriate order

e. Issuing a Writ of Certiorari quashing any purported permits and/or

approvals (including quashing the purported Development Permit P45)

and/or the decision to grant approval (as may be disclosed by the

documents obtained by calling for the record) granted for the construction

on premises No.12, Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy and/or quashing any

purported approvals/ the decision to grant approvals for the construction

on premises No.12, Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy to the extent of

inconsistency with the applicable building regulations P6 (A), or such

other appropriate order

f. Issuing a Writ of Certiorari quashing any Certificate of Conformity (as may

be disclosed by the documents obtained by calling for the record) granted

for the construction on premises No.12, Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy, or

such other appropriate order

g. Issuing a Writ of Mandamus, directing the relevant respondents, including

especially the 1st – 3rd respondents, to give effect to the recommendations

contained in the investigation report marked P34, with regard to the

building/ construction on No.12, Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy, or such

other appropriate order

h. Issuing a Writ of Mandamus, directing the relevant respondents, including

especially the 1st -3rd respondent, to exercise their powers under section

Page9

28A (1) (C) of the Urban Development Authority Law by acting to demolish

the construction on premises No.12, Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy and/or

at minimum the illegal and/or unlawful portions of the building at No.12,

Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy, so as to bring it in conformity with the

applicable regulations, or such other appropriate order

i. For costs including punitive and/or exemplary costs; and

j. For such further and other reliefs as to Your Lordships’ Court shall seem

meet.

7] The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th Respondents concede certain background facts,

notably, that a Special Committee was appointed by the Governor following the

Buwelikada building collapse to investigate comparable structural risks. They

say, however, that the construction of this application was not among the twenty

collapsible buildings identified by that Committee.

8] In refuting allegations made by the Petitioners, the said Respondents

maintain that all requisite procedures were duly followed, affirming that

approval for a seven-floor structure was granted on 19/09/2019, followed by

the issuance of a Development Permit under the Urban Development Authority

Act. They further contend that the subsequent Certificate of Conformity (COC)

was lawfully issued after a site inspection, which, in their assessment, showed

no significant incline and confirmed that the building footprint covered only 80%

of the land in compliance with the relevant regulations. The Respondents also

note that the earlier report marked P34 was later reviewed and determined to

have been prepared on “incorrect premises” and in an “erroneous manner,”

resulting in the exoneration of the officers whose conduct had been questioned.

9] Beyond these limited admissions, the Respondents categorically deny all other

allegations. They raise several preliminary objections, asserting that the

Petitioners have failed to present material facts, have willfully suppressed or

misrepresented information, and have therefore not approached the Court with

Page10

the requisite “clean hands,” amounting to a breach of uberrima fides. They also

contend that the application is misconceived and futile.

10] Further, the Respondents argue that “The Coffee Bungalow” is situated at a

significantly higher elevation than the 6th and 7th Respondents’ construction,

with an approximate 200-foot separation, and thus any structural instability of

the “Grand Serendib Hotel” would not affect the Petitioners’ premises. Asserting

that their actions were lawful and properly executed, they submit that the

Petitioners have failed to demonstrate any illegality or impropriety and request

that the Court dismiss the application and award costs.

11]The 6th and 7th Respondents—Hotel Grand Serendib and its director—

vigorously oppose the Petition, contending that it should be dismissed in limine

on the grounds that it is misconceived, frivolous, and vexatious. They argue that

document P34, the report of the purported seven-member committee, is not

properly before the Court and was prepared in violation of natural justice,

asserting that it cannot be relied upon. That was the case for the State.

12]They further submit that the Petitioners have suppressed and

misrepresented material facts in order to mislead the Court. Describing the

development of Hotel Grand Serendib at No. 12, Mahamaya Mawatha, they state

that they invested over USD 4 million and complied fully with all requisite

approvals from the Urban Development Authority (UDA), the Central

Environmental Authority (CEA), and other regulatory bodies. They say that they

have already obtained a Certificate of Conformity (COC) and all necessary

operational licences, including a liquor licence. Emphasizing the structural

soundness of the building.

Page11

13] They assert that the Hotel was designed by qualified experts and constructed

on flat land, directly contradicting the Petitioners’ allegations of hazardous

construction on a steep incline.

14] They claim to have had no prior knowledge of the seven-member committee’s

report and maintain that the committee neither visited the site nor afforded them

a fair hearing. They confirm that the building was originally approved for a

height of approximately 22 metres and was subsequently constructed with seven

floors (B1 + B2 + G + G1 + 3), pursuant to an amended plan duly approved by

the UDA (6R28). They categorically deny any suppression of documents and

assert that the hotel poses no risk of collapse, relying on documents 6R37, 6R38,

and 6R39, which they say affirm its structural integrity. Their request is that

the Petition be dismissed with costs.

15] The 8th Respondent, Mayor of the Municipal Council, Kandy, generally

denies or expresses unawareness of the averments made by the Petitioners

across paragraphs 1 to 33 and 35 to 36 of the petition. Specifically, they admit

that the building in question is located within the Kandy Municipal Council

limits, is approved by the Urban Development Authority (UDA), and has received

a Certificate of Conformity from the UDA.

16] The 8th Respondent says that 9th Respondent has fulfilled all requirements

for their building plan approval and that the impugned related processes are

outside the administrative scope of the 9th Respondent. The 8th Respondent

formally prays that the Court dismiss the Petition.

17] The 9th Respondent, The Kandy Municipal Council, admits to certain facts,

such as the existence of a property called "The Coffee Bungalow Kandy" and the

admission that the building is approved by the Urban Development Authority

(UDA) and is located within the Kandy Municipal Council (KMC) limits.

Page12

18] However, they state that they are unaware of facts and documents referenced

in the petition, including the letter marked P10 received by the 8th Respondent,

the news articles P30(a)-P30(c) concerning the building collapse in Buwelikada,

the news article P31, the documents P32-P34, the investigation report, the letter

P35, the document P36, the document P38, and the communications marked

P40 to P45. Crucially, the 9th Respondent denies involvement in the building's

construction or the inspection mentioned in paragraph 21, states they are not

members of the Investigation Committee, and asserts they were not a party to

the Magistrate's Court case No. 32102/21.

19] At this moment, firstly, the Court considers the objection to X1 to be

considered. It should be considered based on the merits of the application,

before the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner objected that the NBRO Report

marked as X1, which was prepared on 13/10/2025 by the Chief Geologist of

NBRO-Kandy. The record shows that this was tendered by motion of the 6th

Respondent's Registered Attorney, Mr. Sanath Wijewardene, dated 23/10/2025.

I noted that oral submissions of the Petitioners have been concluded on

01/10/2025 and the adjudication must be considered situation of at the date of

filing the application. This report has been prepared well after the institution of

this application, therefore court refuses to consider materials in X1.

20] The Petitioners contend that their application for a Writ of Certiorari ought

to be adjudicated on its merits and not dismissed on the ground of laches,

particularly because the impugned approvals and the Certificate of Conformity

(COC) are alleged to be nullities issued without jurisdiction. They argue that

while the Court possesses discretion in granting prerogative writs, such

discretion must be exercised in accordance with ordinary principles of

administrative law, and that delay is immaterial where the challenged act is void

ab initio.

Page13

21] They rely on Ashokan v Commissioner of National Housing and Biso

Menika v Cyril de Alwis, which emphatically state that laches cannot defeat a

challenge to a jurisdictionally defective decision. The Petitioners therefore

submit that even if some delay is established, the Court is nevertheless bound

to scrutinize the legality of the impugned acts, as nullities are incapable of being

validated by the mere passage of time.

22] In Ashokan v Commissioner of National Housing [2003] 3 SLR 179, Sripavan,

J., held the question of delay as;

“Question of delay does not apply where the proceedings are a nullity”

23] In Biso Menika Vs. Cyril de Alwis [1982] 1 SLR 368, 379, SHARVANANDA,

J., (As he then was) held that,

“An application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable

time from the date of the Order which the applicant seeks to have quashed.

What is reasonable time and what will constitute undue delay will depend

upon the facts of each particular case. However the time lag that can be

explained does not spell laches or delay. If the delay can be reasonably

explained, the Court will not decline to interfere. The delay which a Court

can excuse is one which is caused by the applicant pursuing a legal remedy

and not a remedy which is extra-legal. One satisfactory way to explain the

delay is for the petitioner to show that he has been seeking relief elsewhere

in a manner provided by the Law.

When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order

complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction, the Court

would be loath to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject the

application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very

extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority

Page14

concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court

may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows

that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In Any such event,

the explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically.

"Recent practice clearly indicates that where the proceedings were a nullity

an award of Certiorari will not readily be denied" - de Smith - Judicial

Review - 4th Ed. page 426.

In this connection, Professor Wade in his "Administrative Law" 4th Ed. at

page 561 states

"the discretion to withhold remedy against unlawful action may make

inroads upon the rule of Law and must therefore be exercised with the

greatest care. In any normal case the remedy accompanies the right, but

the fact that a person aggrieved is entitled to Certiorari ex debito justitiae

does not alter the fact that a Court has power to exercise the discretion

against him, as it may in the case of any discretionary remedy."

24] In this application, the Petitioners allege that the construction at No. 12,

Mahamaya Mawatha, Kandy, was undertaken in clear violation of the Urban

Development Authority Law and its subsidiary regulations. They assert that a

series of approvals—ranging from the Preliminary Planning Clearance to the

Planning Approval and subsequent amendments—were granted in blatant

disregard of mandatory regulatory requirements governing floor area ratio (FAR),

plot coverage, building height, and the treatment of basements.

Page15

25] The Petitioners rely extensively on material obtained through a Right to

Information application, particularly the seven-member investigation committee

report (P34), which documents numerous breaches, recommends disciplinary

action, and calls for suspension of the COC. Despite these findings, the

Respondents allegedly issued the COC in undue haste in an attempt to frustrate

the Petitioners’ legal challenge. The Central Environmental Authority has also

initiated proceedings for environmental violations, further reinforcing the

unlawfulness of the project.

26] Specially, the Petitioners’ argument concerns the actual slope of the land

and the resulting FAR restrictions under the applicable Planning and Building

Regulations. They contend, based on reports from the National Building

Research Organization [NBRO] and material from the UDA’s own records, that

the land has a slope between 30°–40°, thereby limiting the permissible FAR to

1:0.5. Nevertheless, the Respondents granted FAR values ranging from 1:2.5 to

1:3.3, which the Petitioners submit constitutes a gross and jurisdictionally fatal

excess of statutory authority. Additional violations are cited in respect of rear

open space, natural light and ventilation requirements, plot coverage, and

maximum permissible height. The Petitioners argue that the Respondents’

attempt to disregard or retroactively invalidate Report P34 is an abuse of

process, as the report was produced by a committee appointed by a higher

authority and remains corroborated by independent evidence. Thus, the record

demonstrates indisputable violations rendering the entire approval process ultra

vires.

27] The Petitioners highlight that an invalid administrative action is “unusually

destitute of legal effect” and may be collaterally challenged or ignored with

impunity. The Petitioners emphasize that the timeline of approvals reflects

arbitrary and unreasonable conduct by the Respondents, including the granting

of approvals for expanded construction despite known hazards and objections,

and despite evidence—such as landslide zonation maps—establishing

significant public safety risks. The issuance of the COC after the application is

Page16

filed is characterised as an attempt to confer retrospective legitimacy on an

unlawful structure.

28] Thus, the Petitioners argue that any act not performed within statutory

authority is null and void, and all purported permits granted in this matter must

therefore be quashed.

29] Moreover, the Petitioners submit that once the permits and approvals are

found to be invalid, the logical and mandatory consequence under Section 28A

of the UDA Act is demolition of the unlawful construction.

30] The Petitioners rely on the decision of KORALAGAMAGE v COMMANDER OF

THE ARMY, [2003] 3 SLR 169. In that, SRIPAVAN, J., held;

“If the impugned acts are not done in the genuine exercise of the regulations,

then they are not done in the 'Exercise of a power conferred by law and are

a nullity.”

31] Further, Petitioners mentioned the decision of S A J T Chandralatha vs

Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha, C A (Writ) Application No. 466 / 2008,

Decided on: 2017 - 06 – 29, where His Lordship P. Padman Surasena J ( As His

Lordship then was) held statutory duty in unauthorised construction and

ordered demolition. His Lordship noted;

“It was shown to the satisfaction of this Court that the 5th Respondent had

constructed a building along the boundary of the Petitioner's land violating

clause 51(1) of the Building and Planning Regulation produced marked P 2

which requires such construction to be away from the boundaries of the

adjoining lands.

Page17

The petitioner has shown to the satisfaction of this Court that she has a

legal right of demanding that an action according to law be taken to redress

the violations of her rights of enjoyment of her property. The Respondents

(except the 5th Respondent) are the statutory authorities charged with the

sole power to take necessary action according to law, to protect the rights

of the Petitioner which has been adversely affected by the unlawful

constructions done by the 5th Respondent.”

32] Similarly, in the case of Daya Chandrasiri Jayanetti et al. v. Urban

Development Authority et al. (SC FR/621/2010), Decided on: 3.4.2019, Sisira

J de Abrew J. has considered unauthorized structure in a fundamental rights

case. His Lordship noted;

“Thus the applicable regulations are the regulations found at document

marked P4. The width of the Chapal Lane is SC /FR/621/2010 15 only 6

meters. Thus, according to Section 27(2) of the said regulations which I have

referred to earlier, this building cannot be permitted to be built and if the

said building has already been constructed it has to be demolished. When

I consider the aforementioned matters, I hold that the development permit

issued to construct the above-mentioned building marked 9R22 extended

by 9R24 has violated the above regulations and that therefore it becomes

an illegal document. However, learned President’s Counsel (PC) appearing

for the 9th and the 10th Respondents admitted at the hearing before us that

there is no any building at No.12, Chapal Lane Nugegoda and that the

development permit issued to construct the above-mentioned building

marked 9R22 extended by 9R24 has now lapsed. However, if the building

shown in 9R23 has been constructed or part of the said building has been

constructed at No.12, Chapal Lane Nugegoda, the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents should take all steps to demolish the said building.”

Page18

33] In line with the above case laws, the Petitioners contended that the 1st

Respondent has not performed the statutory duty within the framework, all the

approvals become nullity, and nullity defeats the laches.

34] In Chief Adjudication Officer v Foster [1993] AC 239, the court considered

the concept of void versus voidable administrative actions and the timing of

judicial review. The principle established (or reaffirmed) is that not all actions

taken by administrative bodies have the same immediate and binding legal

consequences. Where a comprehensive internal review and appeal system exists,

an initial decision may be seen as lacking final legal effect until that process is

exhausted or the review period has passed.

35] In the above case, Lord Goff used the phrase "unusually destitute of legal

effect" to characterise the initial decision in that specific statutory context. He

reasoned that the decision was subject to a seamless and complete

administrative review process, under which the reviewing officer could

substitute their own decision with retrospective effect. This meant the initial

decision did not have the finality or independent legal standing typically

associated with administrative actions subject to judicial review.

36] The impugned construction was not an overnight construction and it went

certain stages spanning nearly a decade. The Petitioners have objected to the 1st

Respondent for unlawful constructions but no steps were taken. The Petitioners

mainly rely on P34. This P34 was made by the constant complaints made by the

2nd Petitioner. It shows;

“2. කමිටුවේ අවධානයට ලක් කළ ඇති ගැටළු.

වෙෙ ඉඩෙට යාබදව ඉහළින් වකාපි ව ාප් වයාපාරයක් පවත්වාවගන යන ෙහොයා ොවවත් හි

තුසිත පරණගෙ ෙහතා විසින් ඔහුවේ ඉඩවේ සිට බලන විට දර් ශන පථය අවහිර කරමින් අංක

12, ෙහොයා ොවවත් ඉදිකිරීේ සේබන්ධව දිගින් දිගටෙ කරන ලද පැමිණිලි”

Page19

37] It is clear that the report was made by the 2nd Petitioner and the duty of the

committee was;

“3. කමිටුවේ කාර් යය භාරය

ෙහනුවර ෙහොයා ොවත, අංක 12 දරණ ස්ථානවේ ඉදිකරනලද වගාඩනැගිල්ල සඳහා අනුෙැතිය

ලබා දීවේදී නීතයානුකුලව අනුෙැතිය ලබා තිවේද යන්න පරික් ා කිරීෙ.”

38] On careful perusal, P34 does not show the methodology adopted to arrive at

such conclusions. It does not show that the committee visited the impugned

vicinity and a physical inspection had been done before the arrival of the

conclusion. Moreover, it is not mentioned that owners of the alleged illegal

construction were given a chance to explain their version, and the said

purported report was made ex parte, breaching the rules of natural justice.

39] It is seen by 6R40, the Petitioners’ premises are not in close proximity to the

said and it was 200 feet apart by three roads, namely Mahamaya Mawatha,

Rajapihilla Mawatha and a private road to the Petitioners’ Coffee Bungalow,

Kandy,and Liselma Residence. (details taken from Google Maps). Thus,

Petitioners’ premises are nowhere near the impugned Grand Serendib Hotel.

40] I now consider whether Petitioners’ rights have been affected. The purpose

of the said P34 inquiry was whether the scenic view of Dalada Maligawa was

disturbed by the impugned Grand Serendib Hotel. (ඉඩවේ සිට බලන විට දර් ශන පථය

අවහිර කරමින්). Now, the question arises whether the Petitioners have a right to an

undisturbed view, as of right.

Page20

41] The Petitioners have viewed Shri Dalada Maligawa for over 100 years and

have long possession created a servitude? In Perera v. Ranatunge, 66NLR 337,

His Lordship BASNAYAKE, C. J, held that a negative servitude for a view or

light cannot be acquired by mere long enjoyment or prescription. A

landowner is generally presumed to be a building on their land for their own

convenience and profit and cannot be prevented from building higher by an

adjacent landowner unless a formal legal agreement exists. [Emphasis is added]

42] In D. H. MOOSAJEE, vs Y. CAROLIS SILVA, 70 NLR 217, His Lordship H.

N. G. FERNANDO, C.J. held that servitude of light and air, window light, a

Negative servitude that bare enjoyment cannot create a prescriptive title under

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance (Cap. 68).

43] Thus, it is crystal clear that the Petitioners have no standing on an

infringement of private right, nor do they have any legal standing that they do

not put forward this as public interest litigation. If this allowed a person in

Kandy to point out a premise in Colombo that had been built in violation of the

regulations and to seek a writ for demolition. If so, it would lead to uncertainty

and would open floodgates.

44] In the case of Vasana Vs. Incorporated Council of Legal Education and

others [2004] 1 SLR 163 Gamini Amaratunga J stated in this regard as follows:

" ... A writ of mandamus is available against a public or a statutory body

performing statutory duties of a public character. In order to succeed in an

application for a writ of mandamus the petitioner has to show that he or she has

legal right and the respondent corporate, statutory or public body has a legal duty

to recognize and give effect to the petitioner's legal right... "

Page21

45] The Petitioners prayed for the approval of the public authority (UDA) to be

declared null and void, and on that premise, a demolition order be granted, and

Mandamus be issued. In GEEGANAGE v. DIRECTOR GENERAL OF CUSTOMS,

[2001] 3 Sri L.R. 179, U. DE Z. GUNAWARDANA, J. held;

"If a certain decision is left unchallenged, it will be accepted and enforced

as if it were valid. Only a decision of a Court can establish its nullity. One

ignores the void decision at one's peril and with ouster and time - limit

clauses coming into vogue, effluxion of time can prevent a challenge to a

nullity being ever mounted after the stipulated period.

46] In Weligamawa Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd. vs.

Chandradasa Daluwatta [1984] 1 S.L.R. 195 stressed that a writ of

mandamus should be issued to secure the performance of a public duty, in the

performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. The public duty

sought to be enforced must be of a public nature stemming from a statute,

charter, the common law or custom, and cannot be of a merely private character.

47] Sansoni J. observed in Samaraweera vs. Balasuriya 58 NLR 118 (at p.120)

“It is trite law that Mandamus is only available to compel the doing of a

duty not done, and not on the ground that the duty had been done

erroneously.”

48] It should be stressed that Mandamus will not be available where there has

been a valid exercise of power, merely because the Petitioner believes that the

discretion has been exercised erroneously by the Respondents. Till P34, there

was no evidence. However, as I observed, P34 was done in breach of the rules of

natural justice and vehemently disputed by the 1st Respondent parties.

Page22

49] The P34 report itself shows that the first building plan was approved on

19/11/2015 and the second building plan was approved on 16/12/2016. The

Respondents have spent millions of monies, Google says that the impugned

premises is a 5 Star Hotel. 1. The Petitioners’ Hotel is a 4 Star Hotel. 2I do not

see why the Petitioners have waited till 2022 to bring this application. The

application was filed on 21/10/2022; construction of the building began in

2015; and P34 was issued on 22/10/2021, exactly 1 year after P34.

50] The Respondents say that the Petitioners are guilty of laches; thus, the

application should be dismissed. In Arachchige Dona Christene Shani De

Silva et al. v. Urban Development Authority et al, CA WRIT/278/18, CA

Minute 26-10 2021, the Court of Appeal held that the principle of laches

prevents a party from claiming judicial review if they have unreasonably delayed

in asserting their rights. However, it has also been held that if the delay is

adequately explained by the applicant, the objection regarding laches can be

disregarded. The Petitioners explanation was that they complained to the

authorities and waited for a reasonable outcome. In the above case His Lordship

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. held;

“If the writ jurisdiction of this Court is invoked after an inordinate delay, the

Petitioner shall explain the delay in his petition. That is a threshold

requirement. Vide Lindsey Petroleum Com. v. Hurd [1873-74] LR 5 PC 221;

Fisher v. Brooker [2009] UKHL 41; Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis and Others

[1982] 1 Sri LR 368 and Bogawanthalawa Plantation Ltd. v. Minister of

Public Administration, Home Affairs and Plantation Industries [2004] 2 Sri

LR 329”

51] But what we do not see is that once the complaint was made, if the public

authority does not act promptly, waiting for such a long time cannot be excused.

The principle is that the law assists the vigilant, not the sleepy (Vigilantibus

Non Dormientibus Jura Subveniunt). Thus, the explanation cannot be

accepted.

52} The Learned Senior State Counsel in her written submission has drawn a

comprehensive comparison (table) with regard to P34 and position according to

the UDA. This clearly shows that facts are disputed by the parties.

53] This table was drawn below for clarity and it clearly shows that facts are

disputed by the parties.

Page24

Page28

Page29

Page30

54] It is seen that the substantive relief sought by the Petitioners, is specifically

quashing the Development Permit (P45) and the Certificate of Conformity (COC).

The 1st to 5th Respondents say that these documents, P45 and COC, are lawful,

and the relief of a Writ of Mandamus directing the demolition of the building

should be denied on the grounds of futility and lack of public duty. They say

they do not owe a public duty towards the Petitioners. As I noted above, the

Petitioners do not have a legal right to have a pristine view of Dalada Maligawa

by prescription.

55] The Respondents contend that the Petitioners had the opportunity to

challenge the Development Permit before the COC was issued, making the

current petition belated and untenable.

56] A key legal principle cited against the Petitioner's ability to challenge the

documents is the Mac Foy Principle, derived from the case of Mac Foy v United

Africa Company [1961] 3 W.L.R 1405 at Page 1410. (1961) 3AER 1169), in that,

the House of Lords held;

“No court has ever attempted to lay down a decisive test for distinguishing

between the two: but one test which is often useful is to suppose that the

other side waived the flaw in the proceedings or took some fresh step after

knowledge of it. Could he afterwards, in justice, complain of the flaw?

Suppose, for instance, in this case that the defendant, well knowing that

the statement of claim had been delivered in the long vacation, had

delivered a defence to it? Could he afterwards have applied to dismiss the

action for want of prosecution, asserting that no statement of claim had

been delivered? Clearly not. That shows that the delivery of a statement of

claim in long vacation is only voidable. It is not void. It is only an irregularity

and not a nullity. It is good until avoided. In this case, the statement of claim

not being avoided, it took effect at the end of the long vacation and the time

for defence then began to run. Likewise when the plaintiffs signed judgment

in default of defence, that too was voidable but not void. It was not a nullity.

Page31

It was therefore a matter for the discretion of the court whether it should be

set aside or not…

Once this stage is reached, it becomes plain that there is no ground for

interfering with the decision of the West African Court of Appeal. As they

pointed out: " The defendant knew when the statement of claim was

delivered to him, and he knew it was then vacation. He made no application

in the court below to set aside the statement of claim as having been

delivered irregularly; he did not raise the point in any way until he appeared

in this court to argue the appeal, over eight months after the statement of

claim had been delivered. Instead of applying to have the statement of claim

set aside, he allowed judgment to go against him by default and then moved

to have the judgment set aside. In that application, he proceeded on the

basis that the judgment was a regular and subsisting one. In support of the

application, he made an affidavit with the object of showing that he had a

defence on the merits, and set out certain averments intended to establish

a basis of fact for that contention. At the hearing of the application he

appeared by counsel, and the application was argued on the merits of the

defence." In the light of the history, it is well within the discretion of the

Court of Appeal to refuse to set aside the judgment.”

57] The Petitioners knew that there was an unauthorised construction, yet they

waited till the edge of issuing the COC. Thus, the stage has passed to get the

declaration of nullity, and the court is vested with the discretion to exercise. We

hold that the Petitioners now cannot apply to invalidate the Development Permit

(P45) or the COC, and the 1st Respondent asserted that the Urban Development

Authority (UDA) followed due process in issuing them.

58] Thus, the issuing prerogative writ can be refused if its purpose is to serve no

practical end or if it would cause mischief to the lawful action. In Samastha

Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya and Others Vs. D.

Dissanayake Secretary, Public Administration and Ministry of Home

Page32

Affairs and Another SC. Appeal No. 158 of 2010, decided on 14.06.2013,

Saleem Marsoof J.

“It is trite law that no court will issue a mandate in the nature of writ of

certiorari or mandamus where to do so would be vexatious or futile. See,

P.S. Bus Company Ltd., v Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport

Board 61 NLR 491, Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs

Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd., 2005 (1) Sri LR 89. The writ of mandamus

59] The Respondents challenge the validity of the "purported Report marked as

P34," which the Petitioner relies upon for the Writ of Mandamus. The

Respondents assert that this report, which contains findings and

recommendations for demolition, is "unlawful and arbitrary" and "ab initio an

invalid report." They say that the committee was not appointed by the Board of

Management of the UDA as required by Section 5(1) of the UDA Law, but instead

by the Secretary of the line Ministry without proper authority.

60] The said section 5 is produced for clarity; it says;

“5 (1) The Board may establish committees consisting of such number of

persons for the proper exercise, discharge and performance of its powers,

functions and duties

(2) The Board may delegate to such committees such of its powers, functions

and duties as may be determined by the Board.

(3) Every committee established under subsection (1) shall determine the

quorum for and the procedure to be followed at the meetings of such

committee.”

61] It is plain to see that the said committee was appointed by the secretary to

the line Ministry, and P34 has no force in law. Thus, this court cannot act on

P34 findings, and the Petitioners should fail at this juncture.

Page33

62] As contrasted above by the table, the technical findings of P34, such as the

building's floor area ratio (FAR), total height (under 15 meters, thus not a 'high

rise' building per Regulation P6(a)), and number of floors, are in compliance with

the Development Permit (P45) and UDA regulations. Specifically, they point to

an alleged error in P34 regarding the building site's slope, contrasting it with a

2016 NBRO Report, which they state was misinterpreted. These facts are, thus,

disputed.

63] A.S. CHOUDRI in his book on the Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights

(2nd Ed.), Vol. 2,(at page 449) states thus:

"Where facts are in dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary

that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have

ample opportunity of examining their witnesses and the Court would be

better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue."

64] In the case of Thajudeen Vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another [1981] 2

SLR 471 Ranasinghe J held:

“ That the remedy by way of an application for a Writ is not a proper

substitute for a remedy by way of a suit, especially where facts are in

dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the questions

should be canvassed in a suit where the parties would have ample

opportunity examining their witnesses and the Court would be better able

to judge which version is correct, has been laid down in the Indian cases of

Ghosh v. Damodar Valley Corporation Porraju v. General Manager B. N. Rly”

(at page 474).”

65] Thus, even if P34 is to be considered lawful, yet facts are disputed, and this

court cannot call records and hold an inquiry superficially to find the truth.

Thus, the application should be dismissed.

Page34

66] The Supreme Court in Ratnayake and Others vs C.D. Perera and others

[1982] 2 Sri LR 451 held that:

“The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where

officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform,

Mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in the

performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is only

granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature, and not

merely of private character that is to say for the enforcement of a mere

private right, stemming from a contract of the parties.”

67] This position was reiterated in Jayawardena vs. People’s Bank [2002] 3

Sri LR 17, and the Court held that:

“Courts will always be ready and willing to apply the constitutional remedy

of mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must

necessarily be a situation where there is a public duty. In the absence of a

public duty, an intrusion by this Court by way of mandamus into an area

where remedial measures are available in private law would be to redefine

the availability of a prerogative writ.”

68] In Rajeswari Nadaraja v. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed, Minister of

Industries and Commerce and Others SC Appeal No. 177/15; SC Minutes of

31st August 2018. , Aluwihare, J held that,

“In an application for a writ of mandamus, the first matter to be settled is

whether or not the officer or authority in question has in law and in fact the

power which he or she refused to exercise. As a question of law, it is one of

interpreting the empowering statutory provisions. As a question of fact, it

must be shown that the factual situation envisaged by the empowering

statute in reality exists.”

Page35

69] In Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs M/s Jafferjee and

Jafferjee (Pvt) Limited, [2005] 1 Sri LR 89. The court held that “the foundation

of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not grant a Writ of

Mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal and not based upon a public duty.”

Thus, it is seen that the 1st to 5th Respondents do not owe a public duty towards

the Petitioners, thus, the application on the above premises should be

dismissed.

70] The learned Senior State Counsel submitted a comprehensive table (as

shown above) and countered P34. As I noted, this committee, the P34, was not

constituted by the proper authority and has no legal validity.

71] Under Section 28A(1)(c) of the UDA Act, demolition should be done only if

the construction was made without a Development Permit or contrary to the

permit. In this case, when the COC is issued, the construction is deemed to be

completed according to the conditions of the permit. This P34 has become an

invalid piece of paper; there cannot be a factual matrix to prove that it was a

construction, not according to the development of the permit.

72] Atkin, J in the case of Rex v. Electricity Commissioners ex parte London

Electricity Joint Committee Co [1924] 1 KB 171, held that the controls of

judicial review may be used “wherever anybody of persons having legal authority

to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act

judicially, act in excess of their legal authority.” In here, we cannot see any excess

of using legal authority.

73] In Stassen Exports (Pvt) Ltd Vs. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue & Others CA (Writ) Application No: 71/2019, the Court held that; “The

above-mentioned matters are serious matters which are connected to the reliefs

sought in this Application. Since those matters are involved with the facts, the

Page36

Court cannot decide on those facts on affidavit evidence. It is trite law that when

the material facts are in dispute the Courts does not exercise its Writ jurisdiction”.

74] Vjith K. Malalgoda, PC J. in Francis Kulasooriya Vs. OIC-Police Station-

Kirindiwela SC Appeal No. 52/2021 held that; “Courts are reluctant to grant

orders in the nature of writs when the matters on which the relief is claimed are

in dispute or in other words when the facts are in dispute.” In this case, the facts

are heavily disputed and cannot be decided merely on untested affidavits and

documents.

75] In Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura

and Another, [1996] 2 SLR 70 at page 73, Jayasuriya, J held that;

“I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue

of a writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter

of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the

court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to his

conduct; delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid

impediments which stand against the grant of relief.” [ Emphasis is added]

76] Further, in The Board of Trustees of the Tamil University Movement vs.

F.N. de Silva [1981] 1 SLR 350) and in exercising the writ jurisdiction, the

court said that “this Court will not consider whether the decision is right or wrong

in the context of the greater benefit of the society or otherwise, but whether the

decision is lawful or unlawful in the eyes of the law. (Vide Public Interest Law

Foundation vs. Central Environment Authority [2001] 3 SLR

330 & CA/WRIT/173/2015, C.A. Minutes dated 03.07.2018).”

77] In Urban Development Authority v. Minister of Lands and 5 others

(2009 B.L.R.) at p 252, the Supreme Court had observed by reference to

“Administrative Law (Ninth Edition) by Wade and Forsyth as follows:

“…. the issue is a Writ of mandamus issue is not that of an abuse of

discretion, but whether the public authority failed to discharge a duty owed

to the applicant.” The position is emphasized in a subsequent section at

Page37

page 620 which reads as follows: “Obligator duties must be distinguished

from discretionary powers. With the latter Mandamus has nothing to do….”

78] Further, it was held in S.I. Syndicate v. Union of India AIR 1975 SC 460;

"As a general rule the order will not be granted unless the party complained

of has known what it was he was required to do so that he had the means

of considering whether or not he should comply and it must be shown by

evidence that there was a distinct demand of that which the party seeking

the mandamus desires to enforce and that that demand was met by a

refusal."

79] As noted above, in Ratnayake and Others vs C.D.Perera and others

[1982] 2 Sri LR 451- “to succeed with the prayer for the Writ of Mandamus, the

claimant must establish that they have a legal right to the performance of a public

duty by the Respondents.”

80] It is necessary at this stage to bear in mind that certiorari is a discretionary

remedy, -see Wade, "Administrative Law" 5th Ed. (1982) pp. 546, 591. Further,

as de Smith says in his work "Judicial Review of Administrative Action", 4th Ed.

(1980) p. 404:

"Thus, certiorari is a discretionary remedy and may be withheld if the

conduct if the applicant, or, it would seem, the nature of the error does not

justify judicial intervention".

81] In P. S. BUS CO., LTD., Vs. MEMBERS AND SECRETARY OF CEYLON

TRANSPORT BOARD. 61 NLR 491. SINNETAMBY. J., held that;

“A prerogative writ is not issued as a matter of course and it is in the

discretion of Court to refuse to grant it if the facts and circumstances are

such as to warrant a refusal. A writ, for instance, will not issue where it

would be vexatious or futile…

…The Court will also consider the probable consequences of granting the

writ-vide 9 Halsbury P 81 (Hailsham ed.) and the cases referred to there-

Page38

in. In the present case the consequences of granting the writ can only be

described as disastrous.”

82] In the case of Siddeeque Vs. Jacolyn Seniviratne [1984] 1 SLR-p83. the

Supreme Court observed that;

“Certiorari being a discretionary remedy will be withheld if the nature of the

error does not justify judicial intervention. Certiorari will not issue where

the end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.”

83] In Annalingam Annarasa and others vs Pathimarasa Leeliyankurus

and others, CA/WRIT/21/2022, Decided on: 13.02.2023, Sobhitha

Rajakaruna J.,

“Similarly, I am attracted by the following passage as well, where it is laid

down under the sub topic of ‘Relief refused in discretion’ in the above

‘Administrative Law’ by H. W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth (p. 426); “Closely

akin to the subject of the foregoing paragraphs and overlapping it in some

cases, is the question of the court’s discretion. The remedies most used in

natural justice cases -the quashing order, the prohibiting order, the

mandatory order, the injunction and the declaration-are discretionary, so

that the court has power to withhold them if it thinks fit; and from time to

time the court will do so for some special reason, even though there has

been a clear violation of natural justice”

84] In Mendis v. Jayaratne, Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Forestry,

[1997] 2 SLR 215, DR. RANARAJA, J., held;

“It is only if the Minister has failed to reasonably exercise his discretion that

relief could be granted. The petitioner has failed to satisfy court on this

aspect.”

85] Lastly, the Respondents raised objection that some prayers prayed for are

vague and therefore, no writ lies. Prayer “f” shows to quash “any Certificate of

Conformity”. It is to be noted that Certificate of Conformity was issued later and

Page39

the Petitioners neglects to amend the Petition as law provides. Without proper

prayer no relief can be granted. The Court cannot act on assumptions. Prayers

must be specific and the Petitioners out to have made it clear by way of

amendment. In H. K. D. Amarasinghe and others vs. Central Environmental

Authority and others, CA/Writ/132/2018 decided on 03.06.2021, His

Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeysekere J., P/CA held in this regard;

“…the relief that is sought must be specific and should address the concerns

of the petitioner. This would then enable the respondents to respond to the

averments of fact and law raised by the petitioner. The fact that the relief is

vague is an indication that the petitioner is unsure of the allegations that

he/she is making against the respondents and makes the task of Court to

mete out justice that much harder”.

86] I am guided by the above authorities, and I feel the Petitioners have failed to

establish that they have a right to bring this action, that they are not guilty of

laches, and facts are disputed, and some documents are contrary to each other,

rendering the refusal of this application.

87] For the aforesaid reasons, we dismissed the application with costs.
