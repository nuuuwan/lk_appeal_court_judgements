"HCC/0275/2023"
"27. In Goverdhan & Anr. Vs State of Chhattisgarh Criminal Appeal No. 116 OF 2011"
"decided on January 09, 2025, Indian Supreme Court elaborately discussed the concept"
"of “reasonable doubt” and stated as follows. “It  means that such doubt  must be free"
"from  suppositional  speculation. 
It  must  not  be 
the 
result  of  minute  emotional"
"detailing,  and 
the  doubt  must  be  actual  and  substantial  and  not  merely  vague"
"apprehension.  A  reasonable  doubt  is  not  an  imaginary,  trivial  or  a  merely  possible"
"doubt,  but  a  fair  doubt  based  upon  reason  and  common  sense  as  observed 
in"
"Ramakant Rai v. Madan Rai, (2003) 12 SCC 395 wherein it was observed as under : “"
"Doubts  would  be  called  reasonable 
if 
they  are 
free 
from  a  zest 
for  abstract"
"speculation.  Law  cannot  afford  any  favourite  other  than  the  truth.  To  constitute"
"reasonable doubt, it must be free from an overly emotional response. Doubts must be"
"actual and substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from the"
"evidence,  or 
from 
the 
lack  of 
it,  as  opposed 
to  mere  vague  apprehensions.  A"
"reasonable  doubt  is  not  an  imaginary,  trivial  or  a  merely  possible  doubt;  but  a  fair"
"doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of the evidence in the"
"case.”"
