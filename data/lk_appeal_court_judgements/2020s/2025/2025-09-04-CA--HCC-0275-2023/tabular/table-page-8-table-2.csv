"discussed as follows.:"
"The burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove all ingredients of the"
"charge  beyond  reasonable  doubt  and  there  is  no  burden  in  our  law  for  the"
"accused 
to  give  any  explanation  (unless 
in  certain  cases  where  specific"
"provision is  made by law).  In my view it is  sufficient  if the accused gives an"
"explanation  which  satisfies 
the  court  or  at 
least 
is  sufficient to  create  a"
"reasonable doubt as to his guilt."
"It should be kept in mind that the trial Judge was a trained judge who would"
"have  been  aware  of 
the 
fact 
that 
the  burden  of  proof 
is  always  on 
the"
"prosecution 
to  prove  a  case  beyond 
reasonable  doubt.  Therefore, 
if  a"
"reasonable doubt was created in his mind, no doubt he would have given the"
"benefit of that doubt to the accused and acquitted him on the charges."
