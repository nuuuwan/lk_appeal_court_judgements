"At page 45, the learned trial Judge has merely narrated the evidence of PW1 regarding"
"the  reasons  for  the  delay  in  making  the  complaint,  without  indicating  whether  he"
"found those reasons satisfactory."
"40. It  is  also  noteworthy  that  the  learned  Judge  did  not  adequately  evaluate  the  dock"
"statement and failed to state why he was not inclined to accept it. The learned Judge"
"simply reproduced a summarized version of the dock statement but did not explicitly"
"state whether he refused to accept it or not. Thus, it is obvious that the judgment was"
"not in accordance with Section 283 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15"
"of 1979."
"41. In summary, the learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the doubt discernible in"
"the prosecutionâ€™s evidence and erred in not extending the benefit of that doubt to the"
"A
ppellant.  He  further  failed  to  take  into  account  the  material  discrepancies  in  the"
"testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and, in  particular, neglected to  evaluate the"
"dock statement of the appellant. These omissions amount to a serious misdirection in"
"law, vitiating the safety of the conviction."
"42. For the reasons set out above, I allow the Appeal and proceed to quash the convictions"
"and sentences imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Vavunia."
"Accordingly, the Appellant is acquitted from the charge."
