"been able to file a police complaint without fear and request a formal investigation to"
"identify the perpetrator."
"17. Furthermore, no evidence was presented to suggest the appellant had a bad character"
"or a violent nature. Therefore, even if we presume the victim was under some form of"
"threat, there was no reason for her parents  (PW1 and PW2) to withhold information"
"about the alleged rape or threat, as there was no evidence that either of them had been"
"threatened by the appellant."
"18. Moreover,  the  victim's  testimony  was  that  she  feared  the  appellant  would  harm  her"
"father  due  to  their  professional  relationship.  In  direct  contradiction,  however,  PW2"

"their  statement  is  belated,  provided  the  reasons  for  the  delay  are  justifiable  and"
"probable.  It  would  depend  upon  several  factors.  To  determine  if  the  reasons  are"
"sufficient, the court must meticulously analyze them within the context of the specific"
