"Case of the appellant"
"7.  The appellant has maintained his innocence during the proceedings. He has"
"asserted that he was manipulated by the person named as the 2nd accused in"
"the indictment into participating in transactions that, on the surface appeared"
"to be innocuous."
"8.  The crux of the appellantâ€™s argument lies in the assertion that he was misled"
"and coerced into those dealings, which he believed to be legitimate exchanges"
"with PW01."
"Grounds of appeal"
"9.  When  the  matter  was  taken  up  for  argument,  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;"
"i.  Whether the indictment is defective as the necessary ingredients"
"of the offence of cheating are not contained in the charges of the"
"indictment?"
"ii. Whether  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the  ingredient  of"
"damage  or  loss  caused  to  the  government  in  the  offence  of"
"cheating?"
"iii.  Whether the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider"
"PW01 is not a credible witness and his evidence should not be"
"relied upon?"
"iv. Whether  the  Learned High Court  Judge  has  failed  to properly"
"consider and evaluate the evidence of the defence?"
"v.  Whether the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself"
"by  coming  to  erroneous  or  irrelevant  conclusions/findings  in"
"the judgment and therefore whether the judgment is bad in law?"
