"no  opportunity  to  cause  the  external  injuries  associated  with  the  hemorrhage"
"and the fractured ribs that were observed."
"13. Consequently,  it  is  clear  that  the  injuries  that  were  sufficient  in  the  ordinary"
"course  of  nature 
to  cause 
the  death  of  the  deceased  have  been 
inflicted"
"subsequently. PW04 has reported seeing a third individual present at the scene"
"where  the  deceased 
lay  with  such 
injuries.  In  the 
light  of  the  absence  of"
"evidence  suggesting  otherwise,  the  prosecution  has 
failed  to  eliminate  the"
"possibility 
that 
this 
third 
individual  could  have  struck 
the  deceased  and"
"inflicted  the  injuries  that  were  sufficient  in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  to"
"cause the death of the deceased."
"14. As a result the prosecution has relied on suspicious circumstances, rather than"
"concrete  circumstances, 
thereby, 
failing 
to  meet 
the  burden  of  proof 
in"
"establishing  that  the  appellant  inflicted  the injuries  that  were  sufficient  in  the"
"ordinary 
course 
of  nature 
to 
cause 
the 
death 
of 
the 
deceased. 
The"
"establishment  of  suspicious  circumstances  alone  is  generally  not  sufficient  to"
"meet  the  burden  of  proof  to  establish  an  accused  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable"
"doubt. Suspicion may arise further questions but it does not equate to proof of"
"guilt."
