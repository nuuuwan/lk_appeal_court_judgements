"Having  regard 
to 
the  principles 
laid  down 
in 
the  above"
"judicial decisions I hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence in"
"order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury or the"
"trial 
judge  as  the  case  may  be  must  be  satisfied  on  following"
"grounds.  (a)  Proved  facts  must  be  consistent  only  with  the  guilt  of"
"the accused (b) Proved facts must point the finger of guilt only to the"
"accused (c) Proved facts must be incompatible and inconsistent with"
"the innocence of the accused. (d) Proved facts must be incapable of"
"any other reasonable explanation than that of his guilt. In a case of"
"circumstantial  evidence, 
if 
two  decisions  are  possible 
from 
the"
"proved  facts,  then  the  decision  which  is  favorable  to  the  accused"
"must  be 
taken. 
In  a 
case  of 
circumstantial  evidence, 
if 
the"
"circumstances found to be as consistent with the innocence as with"
"the guilt of the accused; or if an innocent explanation is found from"
"the  evidence  of  the  prosecution,  no 
inference  of  guilt  should  be"
"drawn. Therefore if the prosecution seeks to prove a case purely on"
"circumstantial 
evidence, 
the 
prosecution  must 
exclude 
the"
"possibility that the proved facts are consistent with the innocence of"
"the accused‚Äù."
