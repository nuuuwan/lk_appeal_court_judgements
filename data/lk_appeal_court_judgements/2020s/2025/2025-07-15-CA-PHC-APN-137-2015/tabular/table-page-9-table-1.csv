"(6) Profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-detection.   In view"
"of the shortage of cars in this country and the prohibitive prices of second-hand"
"cars  and  also  the  demand  for  spare-parts,  the  profits  to  the  culprit  would  be"
"immense."
"(7) Also the use to which a stolen article could be put."
"Stolen  cars, 
it 
is  well-known,  are  used 
for  committing  other  offences, 
like"
"burglary, abduction, and so on."
"These are all matters that the Magistrate should have taken into consideration."
"He  has  failed  to  discharge  his  duty  properly  in  dealing  with  these  two  cases."
"Therefore, in each one of these cases I would sentence the accused under Section"
"367 to a term of two years' rigorous imprisonment. The sentence in the later case"
"will begin to run at the expiration of that in the earlier one. The amounts paid as"
"Crown costs to be returned to the accused."
"Before  I  part  with  these  cases  I  must  also  indicate  the  circumstances  under"
"which I came to send for these cases and to act by way of revision."
"These cases were brought to my notice by a pseudonymous petition, copies of"
"which  had  been 
forwarded 
to 
the  Chief  Justice  and 
the  Judicial  Service"
"Commission. Such petitions normally find their way into my waste-paper basket,"
"of course, after I have read them. But when I read this petition I felt that there"
"must be some substance in the allegations and that they should be verified."
"Having been a Judicial Officer for a number of years, I was moved to make"
"representations, over a decade ago, to the Criminal Courts Commission, presided"
"over by Gratiaen, J., and of which Pulle, J., was a member, that there should be"
"inspections of Magistrates' Courts by competent persons, not with a view to finding"
"fault with their work, but with a view to assisting them in discharging their duties"
"properly.  This  I  did  because  I  was  aware  of  a  growing  public  dissatisfaction"
