"I would also indicate what factors should be taken into consideration by"
"Judges on the matter of sentence. I proceed to quote from the case of The Attorney-"
"General v. H. N. de Silva1.[1 (1955) 57 N. L. R. 121.] . At page 124 Basnayake,"

"passed on an offender the judge should consider the matter of sentence both from"
"the point of view of the public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look"
"at  the  question only  from  the  angle  of the offender.  A judge  in determining  the"
"proper sentence should first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from"
"the nature of the act itself, and should have regard to the punishment provided in"
"the Penal Code, or other Statute, under which the offender is charged."
