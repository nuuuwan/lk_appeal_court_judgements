"The order-made by the learned trial Judge in respect of the respondent is therefore"
"one that falls properly to be revised."
"T
he all too frequent use of section 325 of the Criminal Procedure Code in cases to"
"which it should not be applied requires that the considerations that Judges of first"
"instance should take into account in the imposition of punishments on offenders"
"should be laid down by this Court. Primarily the punishment for crime is for the"
"good of the State and the safety of society 1[Rex v. Nash (1950) 1 D. L. R. 543 ;"
"Kenneth John Ball (1951) 35 Cr. A. R. 164.]. It is also intended to be a deterrent"
"to others from committing similar crimes 2[Rex v. Dash (1948) 91 can. G. G. 187"
"at  191.].  There  must  always  be  a  right  proportion  between  the  punishment"
"imposed and the gravity of the offence."
"I
n assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge should"
"consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the public and the"
"offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question only from the angle of"
"the offender. A Judge should, in determining the proper sentence, first consider"
"the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should"
"have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under"
"which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment"
"as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective. If the offender held"
"a position of trust or belonged to a service which enjoys the public confidence that"
"must be taken into account in assessing the punishment. The incidence of crimes"
"of the nature of which the offender has been found to be guilty 3[Rex v. Boyd (1908)"
"1 Cr. App. Rep. 64.] and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should"
"receive  due  consideration.  The  reformation  of  the  criminal,  though  no  doubt  an"
"important consideration, is subordinate to the others I have mentioned. Where the"
"public interest or the welfare of the State (which are synonymous) outweighs the"
"previous good character, antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must"
"prevail."
