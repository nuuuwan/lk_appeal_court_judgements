K. M. S. DISSANAYAKE, J.

The instant appeal arises from an order of the learned High Court Judge of the

North Western Province holden in Chilaw dated 06.08.2019 (hereinafter called

and referred to as ‘the order’) dismissing an application in revision filed before

it by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter called and referred to as

‘the Appellant’) seeking to revise and set aside the order of the learned

Magistrate of Chilaw dated 30.04.2019 wherein the learned Magistrate had

made order under and in terms of the provisions of section 10 of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (as amended) (hereinafter

called and referred to as ‘the Act’) directing the Appellant to be ejected

forthwith from the State land referred to in the application made to it by the

Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the

Respondent’) being the Competent Authority under section 5 thereof. The sole

reason adduced in her order by the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw for the

dismissal of the application in revision is that the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 in section 5 makes provisions only for

preferring an appeal to the High Court from an order made by a Magistrate

under section 10 of the Act, and thus, it makes no provisions for preferring an

application in revision from an order as such and therefore, there was no

proper application before Court and hence, it should be dismissed. It is this

CA/PHC/0155/2019

Page 4 of 8

order that the Appellant now seeks to impugn before this Court in the instant

Appeal.

In the light of the reasoning adduced by the learned High Court Judge of

Chilaw as enumerated above, the pivotal question that would now, arise for our

consideration in this appeal is that the order of learned High Court Judge can

sustain in law in terms of the provisions of section 10(1) and (2) of the Act

which reads thus;

“(1) If after inquiry the Magistrate is not satisfied that the person showing

cause is entitled to the possession or occupation of the land, he shall

make order directing such person and his dependants, if any, in

occupation of such land to be ejected forthwith from such land.

(2) No appeal shall lie against any order of ejectment made by a

Magistrate Court under subsection (1)”

Upon a careful reading of section 10 (2) of the Act in conjunction with section

10 (1) thereof, it becomes abundantly, clear without an iota of doubt that no

appeal shall lie against any order of ejectment made by a Magistrate Court

under subsection (1). Hence, right of appeal is not available from an order

under subsection (1) of the Act.

Hence, the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw had grossly, erred in law when

she had proceeded to dismiss the application in revision on the sole premise

that the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 in

section 5 makes provisions only for preferring an appeal to the High Court from

an order made by a Magistrate under section 10(1) of the Act, and thus, it

makes no provisions for preferring an application in revision from an order as

such and therefore, there was no proper application before Court and hence, it

should be dismissed.

CA/PHC/0155/2019

Page 5 of 8

I would therefore, hold that the order of the learned High Court Judge cannot

in any manner, sustain in law and as such it should be rejected in-limine.

Let me now, examine the provisions contained in section 5 of the High Court of

the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 which reads thus;

“5- The Provisions of written law applicable to appeals to the Court of

Appeal, from convictions, sentences or orders entered or imposed by a

Magistrate's Court, and to applications made to the Court of Appeal for

revision of any such conviction, sentence or order shall, mutatis

mutandis, apply to appeals to the High Court established by Article 154P

of the Constitution for a Province, from convictions, sentences or orders

entered or imposed by Magistrate's Courts, Primary Courts and Labour

Tribunals within that Province and from orders made under section 5 or

section 9 of the Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, in respect of land

situated within that Province and to applications made to such High

Court, for revision of any such conviction, sentence or order.”

A careful reading of section 5 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, clearly, shows that it only, provides for the

procedure for appealing to the High Court and nothing more.

Hence, it becomes manifestly, clear that the said section 5 the High Court of

the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 does not expressly, or

impliedly, provides for a right of appeal against any order of ejectment made by

a Magistrate Court under subsection (1) as erroneously, found by the learned

High Court Judge of Chilaw.

Hence, I would hold that, the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw had gravely,

misconstrued and/or grossly, misinterpreted the section 5 of the High Court of

the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 when she had proceeded

to dismiss the application in revision upon a total misconception and/or

CA/PHC/0155/2019

Page 6 of 8

misapprehension that the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 in section 5 makes provisions only for preferring an appeal to

the High Court from an order made by a Magistrate under section 10(1) of the

Act, and thus, it makes no provisions for preferring an application in revision

from an order as such and therefore, there was no proper application before

Court and hence, it should be dismissed.

I would thus, hold that the order of the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw

cannot sustain in law and as such it should be dismissed in-limine on this

basis too.

Let me now, consider the pivotal question raised by the learned Counsel for the

Appellant, namely; whether revision will lie from an order made by a Magistrate

under section 10 (1) of the Act for; right of appeal shall not lie therefrom in

terms of section 10(2) thereof.

In Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 68 NLR 36 at page 38, it was held

that, “The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its

object is the due administration of justice and the correction of errors,

sometimes committed by this Court itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of

justice. It is exercised in some cases by a Judge of his own motion, when an

aggrieved person who may not be a party to the action brings to his notice the

fact that, unless the power is exercised, injustice will result.” This was later

approved by a Divisional Bench in Somawathie v. Madawela 1983 [2] SLR 15

and in Gunarathna v. Thambinayagam 1993 [2] SLR 355. (Vide-SC

Appeal/111/2015-Decided on 27.05.2020.)

Furthermore, time to time, Courts in Sri Lanka have observed that an

appellant could invoke the revisionary jurisdiction even when there is a right of

appeal available (Vide-Attorney General v. Podisingho 51 NLR 385) and

when there is no right of appeal available (Vide-Sunil Chandra Kumar v.

CA/PHC/0155/2019

Page 7 of 8

Veloo 2001 [3] SLR 91) or when the said right of appeal has been exercised

(Vide-K. A. Potman v. Inspector of Police, Dodangoda 74 NLR 115). (Vide-

SC Appeal/111/2015-Decided on 27.05.2020.)

In the light of the law laid down by Court in the aforesaid decisions, I would

hold that Revision will lie to the Provisional High Court of North Western

Province holden in Chilaw against the order made by the learned Magistrate of

Chilaw under section 10 (1) of the Act for; right of appeal shall not lie therefrom

in terms of section 10(2) thereof (Vide- Sunil Chandra Kumar v. Veloo 2001

[3] SLR 91).

I would therefore, hold that the Appellant had rightly, invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provisional High Court of North Western Province holden in

Chilaw against the order made by the learned Magistrate of Chilaw under

section 10 (1) of the Act for; right of appeal shall not lie therefrom in terms of

section 10(2) thereof.

Hence, I would set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of the North

Western Province holden in Chilaw.

I would thus, direct the learned High Court Judge of the North Western

Province holden in Chilaw to hear and determine the threshold issue as to the

issuance of notice on the Respondents named therein as prayed for in prayer

“අ” of the petition of the Appellant dated 15.05.2019 forwarded to High Court of

the North Western Province holden in Chilaw.

And I would further direct the learned High Court Judge of the North Western

Province holden in Chilaw to hear and determine the instant application in

revision on its merit strictly, in accordance with the law and procedure in case

the learned High Court Judge of the North Western Province holden in Chilaw

is satisfied that there is a prima facie case made out by the Appellant in his

petition for the issuance of notices on the Respondent.

Hence, I would allow the instant appeal however, without costs.
