JUDGEMENT K. M. G. H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioner was an undergraduate of the Faculty of Medicine,

University of Peradeniya, registered for the academic year 2009/2010.

The petitioner has successfully completed the undergraduate studies

and graduated, obtaining an MBBS degree. The petitioner’s basic

complaint to this Court is that though she had obtained the required

marks to qualify to be awarded a Second Class Lower, by obtaining the

required average marks as specified in Clause XXIII of the Student

WRT-0457-2020

Page 37 of 47

Handbook. However, the Council of the University of Peradeniya has

refused and not awarded the Second Class Lower to the petitioner on

the basis that she had not passed all the subjects in the first attempt

as prescribed in the said Clause XXIII.

2. The petitioner, in November 2019, was required to sit for the final MBBS

examination and take five subjects, namely, (1) Medicine; (2)

Gynaecology & Obstetrics; (3) Paediatrics; (4) Surgery; and (5)

Psychiatry. The petitioner has sat for three subjects, Medicine, Surgery,

and Psychiatry, in the final examination held in 2019. The petitioner

has then sat for the other two subjects, Gynaecology & Obstetrics and

Paediatrics, in the Final MBBS Examination held in June 2020. The

petitioner has so sat for two subjects in the following year upon

submitting a medical certificate for those two subjects. It is common

ground that the medical certificate submitted by the petitioner was

approved by the Senate and accepted by the University. Upon so

accepting the medical certificates, the petitioner was permitted to sit for

the said two subjects in June 2020. The petitioner had successfully

passed the said two subjects and has also obtained an average of 62%,

which brings her within the qualifying average mark of 60–64% to be

awarded a Second Class Lower. The petitioner was not awarded the

Second Class Lower. In view of this, the petitioner preferred this

application.

3. The position of the petitioner is that if a medical certificate is approved

by the Senate and is accepted, such attempt is not considered as being

an attempt, and passing of the said two subjects on the following

occasion would then be deemed as the completion of the final

examination and passing all subjects in the first attempt. As opposed

to this, the respondents’ position is that the said position of the

petitioner is devoid of merit and unreasonable, as all medical students

from faculties of medicine across Sri Lanka were required to sit for all

five subjects without any break, in one sitting, in the final MBBS

examination, as per the procedure approved by the University Grants

WRT-0457-2020

Page 38 of 47

Commission (UGC). It is such students who are entitled to have

obtained classes. This, being a highly competitive examination, allowing

a person to claim a class upon sitting for the examination on two

different occasions, affords such student an undue advantage as

against those who have sat for all five subjects at one and the same

examination without any break. To this end, the respondents appear to

base their arguments on the plain reading of Clause XXIII that the

candidate must pass all subjects in the first attempt to obtain a class.

4. The final year MBBS examination consists of five subjects, and all final

year medical students are required to sit for all five subjects to be

considered as a first attempt. It is the position of the respondents that

the MBBS final examination is a common examination, held across Sri

Lanka for all medical students at all Sri Lankan universities registered

under the UGC. The criteria and guidelines as to the requirements to

award degrees is contained in the Rules and Regulations Governing

Examinations in the Faculty of Medicine, as incorporated and included

in the University Student Handbook (P-9, 2014 Edition), according to

which the relevant clause is Clause XXIII, which reads as follows:

“CLAUSE XXIII

Classes

With respect to the final MBBS, classes are awarded on the basis

of the average overall mark as shown below. This proposal was

implemented from 2007/08 batch.

Average Mark per subject Class

60-64 Second Class Lower

65-69 Second Class Upper

70 and above First Class

The candidates must pass all subjects in the first attempt to obtain

a class.”

According to the above, it is expressly provided that the candidates

must pass all subjects in the first attempt to obtain a class. The

WRT-0457-2020

Page 39 of 47

contentious issue between the parties in this application arises out of

this clause based on the term “first attempt”. The argument advanced

on behalf of the petitioner is that the phrase “first attempt” is subject to

Clause XV, which provides for the tendering and accepting of medical

certificates. Clause XV of Section 3 provides that:

“CLAUSE XV

With respect to any examination

(1) A student must sit the first available examination unless

a valid excuse has been submitted to the Faculty and

accepted by the Senate.

(2) The first available attempt is the examination in respect

to a module, for which a student has been assigned to and

is held at the scheduled end of the module, course or subject.

(3) If an excuse submitted to the Faculty for failure to sit an

available examination is accepted by the Senate, that

examination shall not be considered as an attempt.

(4) A valid excuse shall be

(a) An illness; or

(b) A personal problem (described in item 6 below)”

The above clearly provides that an illness is a valid excuse. As

contemplated by sub-clause (3) of Clause XV, if the Senate had accepted

the said ground for the failure to sit an examination, such examination

shall not be considered as an attempt.

5. Relying on these provisions, it is argued on behalf of the petitioner that

due to her failure to sit for two subjects on the basis of an illness, the

subsequent attempt should be deemed her first attempt in respect of

the said subjects, though she sat and successfully completed the

examination that was held next. On this basis, it is the petitioner’s

contention that she should be considered as having passed all subjects

in the first attempt within the meaning of Clause XXIII. It is on this basis

that the petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus directing the

respondents to award her a Second Class Lower classification.

WRT-0457-2020

Page 40 of 47

6. Clause XV provides for any examination; this would include the Final

MBBS examination as well. Accordingly, if the excuse is accepted, it

provides that such examination shall not be considered as an attempt.

Based on this provision, the petitioner argues that due to being excused

from two subjects the first time around, based on the valid excuse of an

illness, such first attempt would not be considered as an attempt, which

certainly is correct and appears to be so on a plain reading of Clause

XV (3).

7. According to the objections, the Admission Card had been issued on

the basis that the petitioner’s sitting for the examination in 2020 is a

repeat examination. It is also the position of the respondents that the

petitioner was offered two options. The said options alleged to have been

so offered are that “the petitioner can request to make the first attempt

null and void and to sit for all the five subjects at the next available

examination as the first attempt and in such instance she will be entitled

for honours and distinction, OR the petitioner can sit for the remaining

two subjects in the next available examination, which will be a second

attempt” (vide paragraphs 41 and 42 of the objections). The respondents

submit that the petitioner did accept the second option and sat for the

examination on the said premise.

8. I will now consider the position and procedure as provided for by the

Rules and Regulations Governing Examinations in the Faculty of

Medicine in the context of this application. In the current application,

the submission of medical certificates and the same being accepted and

approved by the University is not in dispute and is common ground.

This is in fact admitted by the respondents in paragraph 53 of the

objections. That being so, the rules provide that a student is required

to take all subjects to complete the examination in any given attempt.

WRT-0457-2020

Page 41 of 47

Clause XXII provides thus:

“Clause XXII

Referred and Fail

In any given attempt the student is required to take all the subjects

in which he/she needs a pass to complete the examination.”

Therefore, it is a requirement that all the subjects should be taken by a

student at any given attempt.

9. The piecemeal sitting for selected subjects is thus prohibited and not

allowed. However, a student may, in certain circumstances, be excused

from taking and sitting for one or more subjects at such examination

and be permitted to take and sit for such subjects. separately on a

subsequent occasion. This, according to the current Rules and

regulations, may arise in two situations: firstly, where a student is

referred in respect of one or more subjects as provided for by Clause

XXII; and secondly, if a valid excuse is accepted in respect of some of the

subjects as provided by Clause XV. In both these situations, such

student is entitled to and will be required to take and sit such referred

or excused subject at the immediate next examination. The referred

students will be so categorised and will be considered as their next

attempt. However in respect of those who have been excused, be it based

on medical grounds or otherwise, they are not in the same position, nor

can they be considered referred or repeat candidates, as Clause XV (3)

clearly provides that if a valid excuse is accepted, such examination shall

not be considered as an attempt. The effect and import of this clause is

that if on the first attempt an excuse was accepted, then the immediate

next “attempt” which such excused student sits for will be considered

the first attempt. Thus, to my mind, the plain reading of the Rules and

Regulations is that an excused candidate stands in a different position

from that of a repeat/referred student.

10. At this juncture and in this context, the propriety of the purported two

options granted by the University requires to be considered. As stated

WRT-0457-2020

Page 42 of 47

above, the respondents claim to have offered either to abandon the first

attempt in respect of the successful subjects and sit afresh for the entire

examination (all five subjects) or sit and take the two subjects as a

referred student. For the aforementioned reasons, as an excused

student cannot be considered or deemed to be a referred student, the

second option is not tenable.

11. The first option was that the petitioner could have the first attempt

made null and void and to consider the next examination the first

attempt (vide paragraph 21(i) of the Objections). I have perused the

provisions pertaining to the Rules and Regulations Governing

Examinations in the Faculty of Medicine, but I have not found any

provision that enables making of a first attempt null and void in order

to make the next examination the first attempt. This option so offered to

the petitioner is contrary to the said Rules and Regulations. Accordingly,

the so called options offered are clearly contrary to and is inconsistent

with the Rules and Regulations Governing Examinations in the Faculty

of Medicine. In similar vein, there is no lawful basis to deem or consider

the sitting of the 2020 examination in respect of the two subjects to be

a repeat or referred. Accordingly, I hold that the respondents could not

and cannot categorise the petitioner as a referred student nor compel

the petitioner to abandon and make void the entirety of the examination

she sat for in 2019. Accordingly, I hold that the sitting of the 2020

examination of the two subjects should be considered as the petitioner’s

first attempt for all purposes of the Rules and Regulations, including for

the consideration of awarding of a class.

12. On an overall consideration of the Rules and Regulations, it is apparent

that the scheme provided for examinations appears to be as follows. To

qualify for a class, it is required that a student should pass all the

subjects in the first available attempt. As for the petitioner, it was the

2019 examination. As for the said three subjects, the 2019 examination

is the first attempt. Then, as for the subsequent two subjects, taken and

WRT-0457-2020

Page 43 of 47

sat in 2020, it cannot, in the normal course, be the first attempt but is

the next attempt. However, by virtue of the provisions in Clause XV (3),

the 2019 examination cannot be considered as an attempt. As stated

above, the examination the petitioner sat for in July 2020 and took two

subjects, for all purposes, including for the consideration of awarding of

a class, will thus be deemed the first attempt for the said two subjects.

Therefore, the petitioner, by operation of the said Rules and Regulations

is considered to have passed all the subjects in the first attempt, so to

say.

13. The learned State Counsel vehemently argued that a student, to be

considered and to qualify for a class, is required to pass all the subjects

in the first attempt in one and the same sitting. The learned State

Counsel, in advancing this argument, proceeds on the premise that

there is a requirement of having to sit and pass all subjects in one and

the same sitting, under Clause XXIII. Unfortunately, the clause does not

provide so. It only refers to a first attempt. With the acceptance of an

excuse with the Clause XV (3), such subsequent attempt will be deemed

and be considered the first attempt. If the Rules and Regulations

intended to exclude the application of Clause XV (3) to the awarding of

classes, the Rules ought to have excluded its application and specifically

stated so; in the absence of which, such a requirement cannot be read

into by a process of interpretation.

14. The supporting argument of the respondents is that as the petitioner

had the opportunity of sitting for the several subjects on a staggered

basis as opposed to the other students who were required to sit all

subjects in the same examination, and this would create an unfairness

from the point of view of the other students, giving an undue advantage

to the petitioner. It was also argued that the awarding of classes is a

matter which should be left to the academic authorities, and this

unfairness, or unfair advantage that may be gained by the petitioner

should be a relevant consideration in deciding this issue. As

WRT-0457-2020

Page 44 of 47

aforementioned, on a plain reading of the provisions of the Rules and

Regulations, it has enabled the petitioner to be considered to have sat

and passed all five subjects in the first attempt, although it was two

different sittings. When rules provide so, the petitioner is entitled to the

benefit of the same. The basis of a possible unfair advantage as against

others merely cannot be a lawful reason to deny the petitioner the benefit

or the advantage she may have so gained according to the rules. Such

advantage or benefit cannot be considered illegal or unlawful but is a

lawful advantage gained in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.

15. I am mindful that matters and decisions pertaining to qualitative issues

of awarding degrees and making other similar decisions should be left

to the respective educational institutions and that Courts should seldom

intervene. In this regard, I find the following dicta of Sedley, L.J., in

Clark vs. University of Lincolnshire and Humberside (2000) 1 WLR

1988, cited in Wade & Forsyth’s Administrative Law (11th Ed. at page

537), relevant:

“The courts will, in any case, be reluctant to enter into ‘issues of academic or pastoral judgement which the University was equipped to consider in breadth and in depth but on which any judgment of the Courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That undoubtedly included such questions as what mark or class a student ought to be awarded or whether an aegrotat was justified.”

The above was followed in the case of Abeysundara Mudiyanselage

Sarath Weera Bandara vs. University of Colombo (CA Writ

Application No. 844/2010, decided on 08.06.2018), where A. H. M. D.

Nawaz, J., with P. P. Surasena, J. (P/CA) (as his Lordship then was),

agreeing, held that,

“The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie within the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities, the Court has to be slow and circumspect before interfering with any decision taken by them in connection therewith. Unless a decision is demonstrably illegal, arbitrary and unconscionable, their province and authority

WRT-0457-2020

Page 45 of 47

should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of want of judicially manageable standards and necessary expertise to assess, scrutinise and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions.” [emphasis added].

16. In the present application, however, it is not a pure and simple decision

or a holistic determination of a qualitative issue of awarding a class. It

is but a specific decision and determination of the entitlement of a

student to be awarded a class in accordance with the express Rules and

Regulations. The 1st respondent university and its authorities have

initially made certain proposals completely alien, inconsistent and

contrary to the express Rules and Regulations. Secondly, the petitioner

had been denied what she is plainly entitled to by virtue of the operation

of the said governing Rules and Regulations. This is different and

distinct from the facts and circumstances of the aforesaid decisions. Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. (as her Ladyship then was), in Dr.

Karunanada vs. Open University of Sri Lanka and Others (2006) 3

Sri L.R. 225 (decided on 31.05.2006), did clearly opine that,

“I am not in agreement with the view that academic decisions are beyond challenge, there is no necessity for the Courts to unnecessarily intervene in matters ‘purely of academic nature’ since such issues are best dealt with by academics who are fully equipped to consider the questions in hand; however if there are allegations against decisions of academic establishments that fall under the category stipulated in terms of Article 126, there are no provisions to restrain this Court from examining an alleged violation relating to an infringement or imminent infringement irrespective of the fact that the said violation is in relation to a decision of an academic establishment.” [emphasis added].

This is one such unique situation in which the academic decision is not

beyond challenge and where the intervention of the Court is required,

warranted, and justified.

17. Accordingly, the decision to refuse and not award the relevant class is,

to that extent, contrary to the rules and amounts to an illegality. In the

context of the principles of administrative law governing the grounds of

WRT-0457-2020

Page 46 of 47

judicial review, an illegality arises where a decision maker acts outside

the scope of its legal authority, misdirects itself in law, or fails to apply

the governing legal framework correctly. Lord Diplock, in his exposition

of the principles of judicial review in the landmark case of Council of

Civil Service Unions vs. Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374

(commonly referred to as the “GCHQ case”), expressed the above view as

follows:

“By ‘illegality’ as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable.”

In the present instance, the 1st respondent University and its authorities

have acted contrary to the Rules and Regulations Governing

Examinations in the Faculty of Medicine by categorising the petitioner

as a repeat candidate and by purporting to offer options not

contemplated by and inconsistent with the said Rules. This amounts to

an illegality and constitutes a clear instance of an authority acting ultra

vires. The impugned decision, therefore, is tainted with illegality,

warranting the intervention of this Court in the exercise of its writ

jurisdiction, and is liable to be quashed.

18. For the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that the petitioner is entitled

to the relief as prayed for by prayers (b), (e), and (h) of the petition.

19. Accordingly, the following writs are issued:

a. a writ of certiorari is hereby issued to quash the impugned

decision of the Faculty Board of the Faculty of Medicine, the

Senate and/or the Council of the University of Peradeniya,

comprising the 1st to 40th respondents and/or any one or more of

them or the other respondents, deciding/determining and

classifying that the petitioner was a repeat candidate when she

sat for the subjects of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and

WRT-0457-2020

Page 47 of 47

Paediatrics at her final MBBS Examination at the University of

Peradeniya;

b. a writ of mandamus directing the Faculty Board of the Faculty of

Medicine, the Senate and/or the Council of the University of

Peradeniya, comprising the 1st to 40th respondents and/or any

one or more of them or the other respondents, to issue

fresh/amended results/results sheets/transcripts which do not

classify the petitioner as a repeat candidate at her final MBBS

examination and to classify the petitioner as having completed

the same examination in her first attempt; and

c. a writ of mandamus directing the Faculty Board of the Faculty of

Medicine, the Senate and/or the Council of the University of

Peradeniya, comprising the 1st to 40th respondents and/or any

one or more of them or the other respondents, to award the

petitioner the Honours Class in the appropriate category for the

MBBS degree programme.

20. Application is allowed to that extent. However, I make no order as to

costs.
