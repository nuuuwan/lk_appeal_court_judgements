"6.  Clause XV provides for any examination; this would include the Final"
"MBBS  examination  as  well.  Accordingly,  if  the  excuse  is  accepted,  it"
"provides that such examination shall not be considered as an attempt."
"Based on this provision, the petitioner argues that due to being excused"
"from two subjects the first time around, based on the valid excuse of an"
"illness, such first attempt would not be considered as an attempt, which"
"certainly is correct and appears to be so on a plain reading of Clause"
"XV (3)."
