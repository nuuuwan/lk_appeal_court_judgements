"","Handbook.  However,  the  Council  of  the  University  of  Peradeniya  has"
"","refused and not awarded the Second Class Lower to the petitioner on"
"","the basis that she had not passed all the subjects in the first attempt"
"as prescribed in the said Clause XXIII.",""
"","2.  The petitioner, in November 2019, was required to sit for the final MBBS"
"examination 
and 
take 
five 
subjects,  namely,","(2) 
(1)  Medicine;"
"Gynaecology  &  Obstetrics; 
(3)  Paediatrics; 
(4)  Surgery;","and 
(5)"
"","Psychiatry. The petitioner has sat for three subjects, Medicine, Surgery,"
"","and  Psychiatry,  in  the  final  examination  held  in  2019.  The  petitioner"
"","has then sat for the other two subjects, Gynaecology & Obstetrics and"
"","Paediatrics,  in  the  Final  MBBS  Examination  held  in  June  2020.  The"
"","petitioner  has  so  sat  for  two  subjects  in  the  following  year  upon"
"","submitting  a  medical  certificate  for  those  two  subjects.  It  is  common"
"","ground  that  the  medical  certificate  submitted  by  the  petitioner  was"
"","approved  by  the  Senate  and  accepted  by  the  University.  Upon  so"
"","accepting the medical certificates, the petitioner was permitted to sit for"
"","the  said  two  subjects  in  June  2020.  The  petitioner  had  successfully"
"","passed the said two subjects and has also obtained an average of 62%,"
"","which brings her within the qualifying average mark of 60–64% to be"
"","awarded  a  Second  Class  Lower.  The  petitioner  was  not  awarded  the"
"","Second  Class  Lower.  In  view  of  this,  the  petitioner  preferred  this"
"application.",""
"","3.  The position of the petitioner is that if a medical certificate is approved"
"","by the Senate and is accepted, such attempt is not considered as being"
"","an  attempt,  and  passing  of  the  said  two  subjects  on  the  following"
"occasion  would 
then  be  deemed  as 
the  completion  of","the 
final"
"","examination and passing all subjects in the first attempt. As opposed"
"","to  this,  the  respondents’  position  is  that  the  said  position  of  the"
"","petitioner is devoid of merit and unreasonable, as all medical students"
"","from faculties of medicine across Sri Lanka were required to sit for all"
"","five  subjects  without  any  break,  in  one  sitting,  in  the  final  MBBS"
"","examination, as per the procedure approved by the University Grants"
