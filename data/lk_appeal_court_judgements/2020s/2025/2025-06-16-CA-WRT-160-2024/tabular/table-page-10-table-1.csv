"extraordinary 
jurisdiction  of  this  Court  from  being  invoked  in  matters  that  fall"
"squarely within the purview of specialized forums established by statute."
"H
owever,  it  must  be  emphasised  that  the  existence  of  an  alternative  remedy  does"
"not  constitute  an  absolute  bar  to  invoking  the  writ  jurisdiction  of  this  Court.  But"
"where  such  remedy  is  available,  two  preconditions  must  be  satisfied  before  this"
"Court may exercise its discretion to intervene:"
"1.  The  Petitioner  must  provide  cogent  and  satisfactory  reasons  for  failing  to"
"exhaust the alternative remedy; and"
"2.  The  Petitioner  must  establish  that 
the  alternative  remedy 
is  not  equally"
"efficacious or adequate."
"Unless  these  two  thresholds  are  met,  the  Court  will  not  be  inclined  to  exercise  its"
"extraordinary jurisdiction in favour of the Petitioner."
"I
n the present matter, the Petitioners have failed to invoke or exhaust the alternative"
"remedies provided under the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act."
"In  particular,  Section  14(1A)  of  the  said  Act  empowers  the  Wakfs  Board  to  revoke"
"the appointment of a trustee at any time if it is satisfied that the appointment was"
"made  by  reason  of  a  mistake  of  law  or  fact,  and  Section  9H  which  allows  the"
"aggrieved  party  to  make  an  appeal  to  the  Wakf  Tribunal.  No  reasons  have  been"
"furnished by the Petitioners as to why this statutory recourse was not pursued."
"Given  the  above,  the  availability  of  an  adequate  and  effective  alternative  remedy"
"before the Wakfs Board and the Wakfs Tribunal further militates against the exercise"
"of  writ  jurisdiction  by  this  Court.  The  Petitioners  remain  at  liberty  to  invoke  these"
"specialized mechanisms and ventilate their grievances through a proper fact finding"
"inquiry."
"F
UTILITY OF RELIEF SOUGHT"
"It  is  further  contended  that  the  Petitioners  have  challenged  only  the  instrument  of"
"appointment  marked  P9,  but  have  failed 
to  seek  the  quashing  of  the  Boardâ€™s"
"decision marked 3R5, which forms the legal foundation and basis for P9. As rightly"
"emphasized by learned Counsel for the 11th and 14th Respondents, this omission is"
"not merely procedural, it goes to the heart of the relief sought. Therefore, even if P9"
"were to be quashed, the underlying decision in 3R5 would remain intact, rendering"
"the relief entirely ineffective. In essence, no consequential or practical benefit would"
"flow to the Petitioners even upon a favourable order."
