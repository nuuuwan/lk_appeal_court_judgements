"F
ACTS ARE IN DISPUTE"
"In perusing the pleadings and materials placed before this Court, it becomes evident"
"that  there  is  a  substantial  and  material  dispute  as  to  the  facts  surrounding  the"
"conduct of the Petitioners at the conclusion of the trustee election held on 25.01.2024."
"The Petitioners maintain that their conduct was not improper and contend that the"
"decision  of  the  Wakfs  Board  to  exclude  them  from  appointment  was  arbitrary.  In"
"contrast,  the  Respondents,  relying  on  reports,  translations,  affidavits,  and  official"
"communication,  have  alleged  that  the  Petitioners,  used  abusive,  derogatory,  and"
"intimidatory language against the public officers present, including members of the"
"Wakfs Board."
