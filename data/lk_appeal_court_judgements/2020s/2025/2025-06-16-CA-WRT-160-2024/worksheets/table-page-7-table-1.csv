"“The writ of mandamus is principally a discretionary remedy… The Court will issue"
"a writ only if (1) the major facts are not in dispute and the legal result of the facts are"
"not subject to controversy and (2) the function that is to be compelled is a public duty"
"with the power to perform such duty.”"
"Applying these principles to the present case, I am of the view that the disputed and"
"controversial  nature  of  the  material  facts  dictates  against  the  grant  of  prerogative"
"relief. The proper forum for resolving such disputes, especially those requiring the"
"testing of credibility through cross-examination, is by way of regular civil action."

n any event, even if the factual disputes were resolved in favour of the Respondents"
"or  the  Petitioners,  I  find  that  the  decision  of  the  Wakfs  Board  not  to  appoint  the"
"Petitioners,  notwithstanding  their  electoral  success, 
is 
justified  and 
lawful.  The"
"Wakfs Board, as the statutory body overlooking Mosques, bears a duty to assess not"
"only  the  formal  eligibility  but  also  the  practical  and  moral  suitability  of  persons"

"A further matter of serious concern arises  from the Petitioners’ failure to tender to"
"this  Court  a  copy  of  the  Constitution  governing  the  Mosque,  marked  3R1  by  the"
"Respondents. This document is materially relevant to the dispute, as it outlines the"
"framework  under  which  the  election  of  trustees  was  conducted  and  stipulates  the"
"Wakfs Board’s role in appointments."
"I
nstead  of  placing  before  Court 
the  authentic  version  of 
the  Constitution, 
the"
"Petitioners  filed  a  translation  of  a  purported  Constitution  without  disclosing  or"
"submitting 
the  version  officially

record  with 
the  Wakfs  Board.  That"
"Constitution, marked 3R1, was subsequently filed by the 3rd Respondent along with"
"their objections and is shown to have been signed by the Petitioners at pages 10 and"
"11, respectively, against Nos. 3 and 14."
"N
otably, the Petitioners have not denied the authenticity of document 3R1, nor have"
"they  provided  any  explanation  as  to  why  they  failed  to  submit  it  to  Court.  The"
