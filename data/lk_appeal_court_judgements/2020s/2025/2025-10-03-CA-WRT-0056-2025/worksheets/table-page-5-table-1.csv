"the  period  of  14  days  in  which  the  interim  relief  was  in  operation  as  well  in"
"blatant disregard and gross violation of the interim order granted by this Court."
"It  was  further  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner"
"in  the  course  of  the  argument  before  us  that,  the  first  option  requires  the"
"reinstatement of the Petitioner in service or require him to report to work and if"
"the Respondents had picked the first option, then the interim order would only"
"be  prospective  as  it  is  a  restraining  order  staying  the  effect  of  the  letter  P19"
"interdicting  him  with  half  pay  for;  the  compliance  with  such  an  order  would"
"necessarily,    involve  permitting  the  Petitioner  to  report  back  to  work  from  the"
"effective  date  of  the  interim  order  itself  and  however,  the  effect  of  the  second"
"limb 
is  entirely,  different 
for; 
it 
is  not  a  restraining  order  but  rather  a"
"mandatory 
order 
granting 
the 
affirmative 
interim 
relief 
requiring 
the"
"Respondents to pay money in the form of salary and therefore, the second limb"
"unlike the first limb would cover the entire period of interdiction and requires"
"the  payment  of  his  full  salary  and  emoluments  during  the  entire  period  in  as"
"much as unlike the first limb, second limb is capable of retrospective effect for;"
"it 
is  worded 
to  cover 
“the  period  of 
interdiction”  which  commenced  on"
"03.01.2025  and  since 
the 
interim  order  was  valid  upto  13.02.2025, 
the"
"moment  the  interim  order  was  issued  salary  from  03.01.2025  would  become"
"payable 
in 
terms 
thereof  and 
that, 
this  Court  has  made  no 
indication"
"whatsoever that the interim order is prospective only."
"It  was  on  the  other  hand,  submitted  by  the  learned  State  Counsel  for  the"
"Respondents  that  the  second  limb  of  the  interim  order  is  prospective  for;  this"
"Court had expressly limited the operation of the interim order only to a period"
"of 14 days from the date of issuance of the same leaving no room for ambiguity"
"as 
to 
its  effective  date;  and 
that 
the 
it  was  granted  ex  parte  without"
"participation  of  the  Respondents  and 
in  such  circumstances 
it  could  not"
"reasonably,  have  been  the  intention  of  this  Court  that,  it  has  a  retrospective"
"effect  thereby  imposing  financial  obligation  on  the  Respondents  for  a  period"
