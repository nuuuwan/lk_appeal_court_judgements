"the  purpose  of  construing  the  real  intention  of  this  Court  with  regard  to  the"
"effective  date  of 
the 
limited 
interim  order  so 
issued  by 
this  Court  on"
"31.01.2025, namely; whether it is retrospective in its effect as contended by the"
"learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner; or else whether it is prospective"
"in  its  effect  as  contended  by  the  learned  State  Counsel  for  the  Respondents;"
"does  not  in  any  manner,  arise  before  this  Court  as  stated  by  S.G.G.  Edgar  in"
"Craies  on  Statute  Law  (7th  Edition)  at  page  64,  as  cited  to  us  by  the  learned"
"President’s Counsel for the Petitioner in the written submissions and therefore,"
"this  Court 
is  bound  to  adopt  a 
literal  and/or  plain  meaning  that  can  be"
"assigned to the very words used by this Court."
"Hence,  the  literal  meaning  that  should  in  my  opinion,  be  assigned  to  the  very"
"words  used  by  this  Court,  namely;  “Learned  President’s  Counsel  informs  this"
"Court he has given notices to Respondents. As they are not before this Court,"
"this  Court 
issues  an 
interim  relief  under  prayer 
‘b’  of  the  petition  dated"
"29.01.2025 only for 14 days….”, is that since, the Respondents were not before"
"the  Court,  out  of  an  abundance  of  caution  and  for  the  purpose  of  minimizing"
"and/or  the  reducing  any  harm  and/or  any  prejudice  that  might  otherwise,"
"interim  order 
in  their 
cause  to  the  Respondents  by  granting  an  ex-parte"
"absence before Court, this Court had granted an ex-parte interim order effective"
"only  for  14  days  from  the  date  of  the  grant  of  the  same  and  therefore,  the"
"intention  of  the  Court  is  manifest  and  becomes  more  clearer,  by  deliberately,"
"using  the  operative  words,  namely;  “Learned  President’s  Counsel  informs  this"
"Court he has given notices to Respondents. As they are not before this Court,"
"this  Court 
issues  an 
interim  relief  under  prayer 
‘b’  of  the  petition  dated"
"29.01.2025 only for 14 days….” that, the ex-parte interim order so granted only"
"for  14  days  should  have  only  prospective  effect  and  therefore,  it  should  be"
"effective only for the period of 14 days from the date of issuance of the same on"
"31.01.2025,  namely;  13.02.2025,  unless,  the  validity  period  of  the  limited  ex-"
"parte interim order was extended by Court at the expiry of it on 13.02.2025."
