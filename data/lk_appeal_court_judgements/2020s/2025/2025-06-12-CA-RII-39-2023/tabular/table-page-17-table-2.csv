"J. as follows;"
"“1. Applications to set aside ex-parte decree are proceedings incidental to"
"and  not  a  trial  proper.  The  inquiry  must  be  conducted  on  principles  of"
"fairness."
"2.The affidavit of the Process Server is prima facie evidence of the"
"fact that summons was duly served and there is a presumption that"
"summons was duly served. Accordingly, the burden shifts onto the"
"defendant to prove that no summons had been served."
"3.The defendants have to begin leading evidence and once the defendant's"
"lead  evidence  to  prove  that  summons  had  not  been  served  on  them  and"
"establish  that  fact,  burden  shifts  back  onto  the  plaintiffs  to  rebut  the"
"evidence.  This  can  be  done  by  calling  the  Process  Server.”  [Emphasis  is"
