The balance must in the first instance be for the policy maker to strike; but if the outcome is challenged by way of judicial review, I do not consider that the Court's criterion is the bare rationality of the policy maker's conclusion. While policy is for the policy-maker alone, the fairness of his or her decision not to accommodate reasonable expectations which the policy will thwart remains the Court's concern (as of course the lawfulness of the policy). To postulate this is not to place the judge in the seat of the Minister...but it is equally the court\u2019s duty to protect the interests of those individuals whose expectation of different treatment has a legitimacy which in fairness outtops the policy choice which threatens to frustrate it.\u201d [emphasis added].",
