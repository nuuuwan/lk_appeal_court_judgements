"been any particular agreement or formula followed in respect of payment"
"of  bonus,  and  the  management  has  in  their  discretion,  on  an  ad  hoc"
"basis made bonus payments."
"18. The  argument  of 
the  petitioners  and 
their  position,  both  at 
the"
"arbitration and before this Court, is that the 1st respondent company is"
"under an obligation as an implied condition of employment to make the"
"payments  of  bonus 
in  accordance  with  the 
formula  A-4(a),  of  the"
"agreement  A-4.  The  evidence  is  to  the  effect  that  certain  ex  gratia"
"payments, such as special allowances, and when profit was made, bonus"
"payments have in fact been made. However, the said payments are not"
"in  accordance  with  the 
formula  A-4(a).  Accordingly,  A-4 
is  not  an"
"agreement  to  which  neither  the  petitioners  nor  the  1st  respondent"
"company was a party, and there is a lack of evidence to establish that"
"the  particular 
formula  contained 
in  A-4(a)  had  been  adopted  and"
"consistently applied since 2009."
"19. That  being  so,  A-8  clearly 
informs 
the  petitioners,  and 
the  1st"
"respondent  company  has  placed  on  record,  on  04.01.2011,  that  the"
"determination of the bonus entitlement will be subject to reconsideration"
"(“නැවත  සොමලෝචනය”)  upon  the  receipt  of  financial  reports.  This  puts  it"
"beyond doubt, that the 1st respondent and the present management has,"
"at no point of time, considered the formula at A-4(a) as being binding or"
"applicable,  in  quantification  or  payment  or  bonus.  There  is  no  direct,"
"unequivocal, 
unambiguous, 
clear, 
or 
specific 
utterance 
or"
"representation made to that effect either. Therefore there is no basis, in"
"fact or in law, to conclude that the formula as appearing at A-4(a) could"
"constitute an implied condition or confer a right to the petitioners."
"20. In 
these  circumstances, 
I 
find 
that 
the  arbitrator’s 
findings  and"
"conclusions in making the award ‘Y’ are lawful, correct, and reasonable."
"Accordingly,  the  petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  a  writ  of  certiorari  as"
"prayed  for  by  prayer  (c).  Similarly,  by  prayers  (d),  (e),  and  (f),  the"
