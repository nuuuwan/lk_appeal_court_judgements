"In  drug-related  cases,  contradictions  within  the  prosecution’s  evidence  or"
"between the prosecution and defence can seriously weaken the case and may"
"even  result  in  an  acquittal.  While  minor  inconsistencies  are  generally  not"
"decisive,  major  discrepancies  can  damage  witness  credibility  and  create"
"reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt, particularly when they concern"
"crucial facts in dispute."
"In  every  criminal  case  the  burden  is  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  case"
"beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  against  the  accused  person.  In  a  case  of  this"
"nature, the prosecution needs to not only prove the case beyond a reasonable"
"doubt  with  cogent  and  credible  evidence  sans  any  contradictions  or"
"omissions but  should also ensure  that the arrest, detection, weighing  and"
"sending  the  substance  for  analysis  is  conducted  in  accordance  to  due"
"process which will otherwise affect the root of the case."
