"The failure of the witnesses to pass the test of credibility and probability and"
"the  inter  se  contradiction  of  the  prosecution  witnesses  are  substantial"
"enough to vitiate the conviction."
"Due  to  the  aforesaid  reasons,  I  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentence"
"dated  24/06/2020  imposed  on  the  Appellant  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge of Panadura. Therefore, he is acquitted from both charges."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Panadura"
"along with the original case record."
