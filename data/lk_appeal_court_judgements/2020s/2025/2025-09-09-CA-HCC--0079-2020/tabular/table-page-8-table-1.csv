"In this case although PW1â€™s stance was that they stopped the Appellant and"
"checked him, PW2 in his evidence very clearly stated that the Appellant was"
"only checked when he stopped his motorcycle after passing the bridge. This"
"is  a  very  serious  contradiction  between  important  prosecution  witnesses."
"Further, this inter se contradiction raises very serious questions as to the"
"credibility of the so-called detection."
"The effect of a valid and serious contradiction in a criminal trial has been"
"discussed in several judicial decisions. A contradiction which affects the root"
"of the case will  certainly overturn the original decision pronounced by the"
"trial court.  The appellate court will not encourage the provision of a second"
"chance  to  the  prosecution  to  rectify  the  ambiguity  created  by  the  police"
"investigators in a case of this nature."
