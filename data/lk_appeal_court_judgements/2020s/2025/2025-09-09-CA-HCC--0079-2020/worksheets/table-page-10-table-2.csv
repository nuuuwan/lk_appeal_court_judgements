"(iii) failure to evaluate and consider the dock statement of"
"accused."
"Test  of  reasonable  doubt  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  evaluation  of  defence"
"evidence. The evidence of the Appellant may not be so convincing yet it may"
"be capable of creating a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case."
"Hence, I agree that the failure to properly consider the dock statement of the"
"Appellant  as  argued  by  the  learned  Counsel,  would  have  a  detrimental"
"impact on the prosecution story."
"The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the"
"observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the"
"prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,"
"means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their procedurally"
"equal position during the course of a trial."
"When the defence evidence creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution"
"case, the benefit of the same should be given to the Appellant."
