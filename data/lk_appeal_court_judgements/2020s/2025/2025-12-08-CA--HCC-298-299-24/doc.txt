JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and the 2nd Appellant)

were indicted before the High Court of Gampaha on the charge of committing the

offence of murder of one Samantha Kumara on 01.08.2017, punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

At the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through 7 witnesses and marking

productions P1-P10, and thereafter closed its case. The first Appellant, in his

defence, made a dock statement, and the 2nd Appellant gave evidence in the

witness box. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by

judgment dated 25.09.2024, found both Appellants guilty of murder and imposed

the death sentence.

Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge, the Appellants have preferred an appeal before this

Court, articulating the following grounds in support of their challenge.

1. Failure to Properly Evaluate and Reconcile Contradictory Eyewitness

Testimony

2. Improper admission of inadmissible evidence under section 27 (1) of the

Evidence ordinance and judicial misattribution of recovery.

3. Improper analysis of private defence and sudden fight

4. Erroneous finding on common intention under section 32 of the penal code

5. Failure to prove the offence of murder beyond reasonable doubt -

entitlement to acquittal

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW 1, Jeewanthi Aruna Kumari, the wife of the deceased, testified as follows:

On 01.08.2017, the deceased was at home, resting in his room. At approximately

5:00 p.m., both Appellants arrived and knocked at the gate. She observed that the

1st Appellant, Dilum, carried an iron pipe, while the 2nd Appellant, Dinuka, was

Page 4 of 16

armed with a Manna knife. She then called out to the deceased and at that time

the Appellants proceeded to unlock the gate and enter the house. Once inside, they

began breaking the windows. As the deceased approached them near the portico,

the 1st Appellant struck him with the iron pipe, causing him to fall to the ground.

Immediately thereafter, the 2nd Appellant inflicted a cut on him with the Manna

knife.

During the cross-examination, she admitted that she threw chilli powder mixed

with water at the 1st Appellant. At the time the deceased was being attacked, both

the daughter and the second son were present in the house. The witness identified

both Appellants as residents of Kongasdeniya and admitted that the deceased and

the 2nd Appellant had previously quarrelled over a money transaction on the

31.07.2017. On that occasion, the 2nd Appellant attempted to take the key of the

motorbike, but the deceased resisted, quarrelled with him, and ultimately retained

the key. The witness then took the deceased to the Wathupitiwala hospital, where

he subsequently died on the way and on the same day, the witness gave a

statement to the police.

It was observed that, during cross-examination, counsel for the defence questioned

the witness regarding several cases that were filed against the deceased in court

involving the deceased. The defence further asserted that the deceased had

obtained Rs. 500,000 from the appellants, and that on the date in question, they

visited his residence intending to recover this sum. The witness, however, denied

this version of events. The defence further proposed that the deceased attempted

to attack the Appellants with a Manna knife, and that the witness threw chilli

water at them. The witness denied this version. The defence also contended that

Page 5 of 16

the Appellants had seized the knife from the deceased and attacked him in self-

defence. Further, the defence proposed that the witness and the deceased were

armed with the Manna knife, an iron pipe and chilli powder and attacked the

Appellants.

Upon considering the evidence of PW 01, it is noted that counsel for the Appellants

failed to highlight any contradictions or omissions. It is further observed that the

witness remained consistent in her statement of how the attack took place, and

that the Appellants had entered the house armed. Furthermore, it is noted that

the witness admitted to having thrown chilli water in an attempt to protect her

husband from the Appellants.

PW 2, Ravindu Dilshan, the second son of the deceased, testified that while he was

flying a kite in a land behind the house, he heard a commotion from the house.

Thereafter, this witness has come from the back door of the house. When he came

onto the porch, the witness saw his parents and the Appellants engaged in a

heated argument, during which the Appellants attempted to attack the deceased.

Furthermore, the witness admitted that the deceased had instructed the

Appellants to leave the house. The witness has seen the 1st Appellant holding the

iron pipe and the 2nd Appellant holding the Manna knife. The witness stated that

he saw his father, deceased, throwing chilli powder towards the Appellants, which

was given by PW 1, and at that time he saw the 1st Appellant attacking the

deceased with the iron pipe, and the 2nd Appellant attacking the deceased with the

Manna knife.

Initially, the deceased was attacked by the 1st Appellant’s iron pipe, and after that,

he fell, and the 1st Appellant continued to attack him. Then the 2nd Appellant

came and attacked the deceased with the Manna Knife more than 5 times on the

neck of the deceased. Then the Appellants had threatened the witnesses to go

inside the house and leave the house on a white color scooter.

During cross-examination, the witness acknowledged that he was 12 years old at

the time of the incident. He further testified that the deceased was holding a pole

and instructed the Appellants to leave the house. The defence highlighted a

contradiction, noting that in his police statement, the witness had said the

Appellants moved towards the road when the deceased, holding the pole, told them

to leave. The witness also confirmed that the Appellants had issued threats before

departing. Additionally, he admitted that the deceased threw chilli powder at the

Appellants because they refused to leave when they were told to leave. The witness

was clear in stating that although the deceased held a pole, he did not attack the

Appellants but only threatened them to go away from the house.

PW 10, IPS Ruwan Pradeepa Siriwardana, upon receiving the information on

01.08.2016, proceeded to the scene, where police officers from Nittambuwa were

already present. He thereafter observed blood patches on the gate and on the road

in front of the house. He further observed that the motorcycle had sustained

damage caused by a sharp object, that a window of the house was broken with

shattered glass, and that cut marks were also visible on the gate.

On 11.08.2017, PW 9, SIP Mahesh Raveendra Kumara, arrested the 1st Appellant.

From his statement, an iron rod was recovered from behind the Appellant’s

residence. However, during the trial, PW 1 and PW 2 failed to identify the said

production.

Page 7 of 16

Upon conclusion of the trial, the 1st Appellant gave a dock statement, and the 2nd

Appellant gave evidence from the witness box. According to the 2nd Appellant, on

the previous day, they had met the deceased, who had asked them to come the

following day to discuss the transaction. According to the Appellant, when they

arrived at the house, PW 1 opened the gate. (It is noted that this was not advanced

by the defence during the cross-examination of PW 1.) PW 1 then went inside and

woke up the deceased, who came out and took hold of an iron rod that was near

the wall and began to strike the appellant. The 1st Appellant seized the iron rod

from the deceased and struck him in return. At that time, PW 1 brought chilli-

mixed water and threw it at the appellants. PW 1 thereafter took a long knife from

under a chair and handed it to the deceased. (During the cross-examination of PW

1, this was not proposed to her.)

The 2nd Appellant stated that he pulled the knife from the deceased. This version

was not challenged during the cross-examination of PW 1. He further claimed that

after the deceased attacked the appellants with chilli powder, the 2nd Appellant

held the 1st Appellant and moved outside. The deceased then returned, took the

iron rod from the 1st Appellant, and subsequently fell down. At that point, the 2nd

Appellant, in order to safeguard his brother, struck the deceased once with the

knife.

The Learned High Court Judge rejected the appellants’ defense of a sudden fight

and ruled that the appellants are guilty of murdering Samantha Kumara.

The main arguments advanced by the Appellants are as follows:

1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account the

discrepancies in the eyewitness testimony.

2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to properly consider the

occurrence of a sudden fight.

Page 8 of 16

Inconsistency in the witness’s testimony

In evaluating the evidence of both witnesses, it is observed that PW 1 and PW 2

were eyewitnesses to the incident, though they were not present simultaneously.

It is further noted that PW 2 was only 12 years old at the time, whereas PW 1,

being the wife of the deceased, was the only elder there. Both witnesses

consistently testified that the 1st Appellant attacked the deceased with an iron

pipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna knife. The 1st and 2nd

Appellants did not deny this fact. Their defence was that the deceased attempted

to attack them and threw chilli water, and that they acted in private-defence.

When we examine the testimonies of PW01 and PW02, certain discrepancies

become apparent. PW01 did not mention that the deceased was holding a pole,

whereas PW02 stated that his father was carrying a wooden pole. Another

inconsistency arises regarding the use of chilli powder water: PW01 claimed that

she alone threw it, while PW02 asserted that the deceased was the one throwing

chilli water.

The critical issue, therefore, is whether these discrepancies undermine the

credibility of these witnesses. The following judgments are relevant to answer the

above question.

Sunil v. Attorney-General, 1999 (3) SLR 191 at page 194, Jayasuriya, J held that:

“In Jagathsena v. Bandaranayake Justice Colin-Thome gave his mind to

contradictions of inter se proved between the testimony of two witnesses.

His Lordship in evaluating those contradictions raised the following

question: "Was the discrepancy due to dishonesty or to defective memory or

whether the witness' powers of observations were limited"

Further held that;

“Justice Thakkar in a very instructive judgment, relying on human

psychology and relying on his vast experience in the trial Court, has laid

down certain important principles which ought to guide any Court in the

evaluation of testimony adduced before it. Having indulged in that exercise

Page 9 of 16

he finally observed that discrepancies which do not go to the root of the

matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses therefore, cannot be

annexed with undue importance: Bharwada Bhogindhai Hirjibhai v. State

of Gujarat at 755. In Samaraweera v. Republic. The Court of Appeal placing

reliance on passages from Indian treatises and following dicta laid down in

Indian judgments has raised some issues which any Court ought to consider

- Whether the discrepancy in testimony is due to dishonesty or to human

defects or due to an embroidery indulged in by the witness and the latter

situation does not justify the rejection of his testimony.”

Justice S. Tilakawardane, J. in A.G vs. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa (SC

Appeal 7912008, SC minutes dated 06.05.2010) has observed that.

"Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic

version of the witness cannot be given too much importance. "

Accordingly, we find that the discrepancy highlighted by the Appellants does not

undermine the credibility of the witnesses. We are mindful that both witnesses,

who are the wife and the son testifying on the memory of a horrendous incident

where the deceased was killed.

It is true that the wife of the deceased, PW 1 did not mention seeing the deceased

carrying a pole. However, the second son, PW 2 stated that he observed the

deceased holding a pole. It must be remembered that PW 1’s testimony focused on

how the Appellants entered the house armed and began attacking the deceased.

In an attempt to protect her husband, the deceased she threw chilli powder mixed

with water and continued to follow him in order to prevent further attack. By

contrast, PW 2, who was a child at the time, arrived later and witnessed the

incident differently. Our courts have consistently recognized that witnesses are

human beings, and it is unreasonable to expect each of them to perceive and

recount an event with identical focus or detail. It is pertinent to refer to the dictum

expressed in the following judgement.

Page 10 of 16

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC 753 wherein Indian Supreme Court held as follows:

“By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo graphic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen.

Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The Witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to attuned to absorb the details.

The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person’s mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another.

Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on.”

I hold that the discrepancies highlighted by the Appellants does not go to the root

of the matter. I further hold that the evidence of both witnesses is credible and

truthful.

We further conclude that the Learned High Court Judge who heard the case had opportunity to assess evidence as he saw the deportment and demeanor of the witnesses. In this regard it is pertinent to refer to the judgment Fradd V. Brown & Co. Ltd., 20 NLR page 282, wherein Earl Loreburn, J, held as follows,

“It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit, upon a point of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal, because Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a Judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or from narrative of those who were present. It is very rare that, in questions of veracity, so direct and so specific as these, a Court of Appeal will over-rule a Judge of first instance.”

We hold that discrepancy submitted by the counsel for the Appellants are not vital and they do not go to the root of the case. For the above reasons, I reject the said contention of the counsel for the Appellants.

Page 11 of 16

Private Defence

Both Appellants' main contention is that the Learned Trial Judge has erred both

in fact and law with regard to the applicability of the exception of private defence.

Exception 2 to Section 294 in the Penal Code reads as follows,

“Exception 2 - Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the

exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property,

exceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of the person

against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation

and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the

purpose of such defence.”

The Appellants contend that the deceased first attacked the 1st Appellant, and

that in an effort to prevent any further assault, the 2nd Appellant retaliated by

attacking the deceased.

The concept of private defence was elaborated by G.L. Peries in his book ‘Offences

under the Penal Code of Sri Lanka’, Page 124.

“(B) Bona Fide Excess of the Right of Private Defence

Exception 2 to section 294 of the Penal Code provides that "Culpable

homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the

right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to

him by law, and causes the death of the person against whom he is

exercising such right of defence without premeditation and without any

intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such

defence”

Further, it is pertinent to refer to the case of Subramani v. State of Tamil Nadu,

2005 AIR SC, Page 1983, Arjith Pasayat, J held;

“Only question which needs to be considered is the alleged exercise of right

of private defence. Section 96, IPC provides that nothing is an offence which

Page 12 of 16

is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. The Section does not

define the expression `right of private defence'. It merely indicates that

nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right. Whether in

a particular set of circumstances, a person legitimately acted in the exercise

of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the

facts and circumstances of each case. No test in the abstract for determining

such a question can be laid down. In determining this question of fact, the

Court must consider all the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary

for the accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If

the circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately

exercised, it is open to the Court to consider such a plea. In a given case the

Court can consider it even if the accused has not taken it, if the same is

available to be considered from the material on record. Under Section 105 of

the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short `the Evidence Act'), the burden of

proof is on the accused, who sets up the plea of self-defence, and, in the

absence of proof, it is not possible for the Court to presume the truth of the

plea of self-defence. The Court shall presume the absence of such

circumstances. It is for the accused to place necessary material on record

either by himself adducing positive evidence or by eliciting necessary facts

from the witnesses examined for the prosecution. An accused taking the

plea of the right of private defence is not necessarily required to call

evidence; he can establish his plea by reference to circumstances

transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself. The question in such a case

would be a question of assessing the true effect of the prosecution evidence,

and not a question of the accused discharging any burden. Where the right

of private defence is pleaded, the defence must be a reasonable and probable

version satisfying the Court that the harm caused by the accused was

necessary for either warding off the attack or for forestalling the further

reasonable apprehension from the side of the accused. The burden of

establishing the plea of self-defence is on the accused and the burden stands

discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea

on the basis of the material on record.

Page 13 of 16

…………..

Sections 100 to 101 define the extent of the right of private defence of body.

If a person has a right of private defence of body under Section 97, that right

extends under Section 100 to causing death if there is reasonable

apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the

assault. The oft quoted observation of this Court in Salim Zia v. State of

U.P., AIR (1979) SC 391), runs as follows:

"It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self-

defence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that,

while the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,

the accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his

onus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying

basis for that plea in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses or

by adducing defence evidence...."

The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence

beyond reasonable doubt. It is enough for him to show as in a civil case that

the preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea.”

The Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows,

‘when a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of general

exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso

contained in any part of the same Code, ………….. is upon him, and the

court shall presume absence of such circumstances” (Emphasis added)

Is there any evidence before the trial judge that supports the private defence?

It is pertinent to note that the Learned High Court Judge correctly found that both

Appellants, armed with weapons, entered the house and attacked its windows. No

evidence was adduced of any injuries sustained by the Appellants, whereas the

doctor recorded multiple injuries on the deceased. It was further established that,

Page 14 of 16

immediately following the incident, the Appellants threatened the witnesses. In

these circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge rightly considered and

rejected the plea of private defence.

Accordingly, the Learned High Court Judge made the following observations and

findings:

In considering the plea of private defence, we are mindful that both Appellants

arrived at the house armed. When the police, PW 10, inspected the scene, they

observed damage caused to the house. It is further noted that the deceased

sustained multiple injuries inflicted by the Appellants, whereas no injuries were

found on either Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded that there is no evidence to

establish that the injuries sustained by the deceased were inflicted in the exercise

of private defence. We are further of the view that there is no material to

demonstrate any necessity for the Appellants to cause such injuries to the

deceased.

We note that the Appellants arrived armed and entered the house. Furthermore,

both PW 1 and PW 2 consistently testified that the 1st Appellant assaulted the

deceased with an iron pipe, while the 2nd Appellant attacked him with a Manna

knife. It is also established, based on the testimony of PW 1 and PW 2, that the

Appellants threatened the family members of the deceased before they are leaving

the house. Upon evaluating the evidence, we hold that the Appellants entered the

premises with a common intention.

Upon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution established the case,
