"entirely on circumstantial evidence, the fact that the deceased was last seen"
"alive in the company of the deceased would not of itself justify a conviction,"

"accused subsequently attempted to dispose of a weapon which might have"
"caused the injuries on the deceased. Again, where the only evidence against"
"two  accused,  indicted  for  murder,  was  that  they  had  the  opportunity  of"
"committing  the  offence  either  jointly  or  individually  and  that  after  the"
"discovery of the body, they absconded and were not apprehended for three"
"years, the verdict of guilty was held to be unreasonable.‚Äù"
