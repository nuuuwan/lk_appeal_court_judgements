"Court held:"
"“Prosecution  case  has  to  stand  on  its  own  legs  and  cannot  take  support  from  the"
"weaknesses of the case of defence. However great the suspicion against the accused"
"and however strong the moral belief and conviction of the Court, unless the offence of"
"the accused is established beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of legal evidence and"
"material  on  the  record,  he  cannot  be  convicted  for  an  offence.  There  is  an  initial"
"presumption of innocence of the accused and the prosecution has to bring home the"
"offence against the accused by reliable evidence. The accused is entitled to the benefit"
"of every reasonable doubt.”"
