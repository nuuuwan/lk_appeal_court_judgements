"They left the STF Camp after entering the out entry at 21.35pm."
"5.  They proceeded along Atthidiya Road toward Maliban junction in Ratmalana. They then"
"parked the vehicle near the Keells Super Market on Atthidiya Road to meet the informant."
"6.  The  informant  gave  specific  information  about the  appellant's  arrival.  He  stated that the"
"appellant,  identified  as  ""Ratmalane  Ratnapala,""  would  be  arriving  on  his  motorcycle"
"bearing  No.  BAG-9175  around  11:00  PM  at  Sumangala  Mawatha,  carrying  a  parcel  of"
"heroin. The  informant also described the appellant as being a  fat person, about 50 years"
"old, and approximately 5 Â½ feet tall."
"7.  The STF officers proceeded 35 feet down Sumangala Road and positioned themselves in"
"front of a medical center. PW 5 was sent 15 meters toward Maliban Junction, while Police"
"Constable Senananayake was sent further down Sumangala Road. In the meantime, PW1"
"and PW2 remained near the jeep with PC 2725 Sisira."
"8.  At  approximately  10:00  PM,  PW  1  received  a  phone  call  from  the  informant  on  Galle"
"Road, who notified him of the appellant's arrival. After spotting the appellant turning his"
"motorcycle onto Sumangala Mawatha, PW 1 ordered him to stop and dismount."
"9.  When  searching  the  appellant,  PW1  felt  something  hidden  in  the  appellant's  groin  area"
"and asked him to hand it over. The appellant then reached into his trousers, took a parcel"
"out of his underwear, and gave it to PW1."
"10. The  appellant's  parcel  was  wrapped  in  newspaper  and  sealed  with  tape.  PW1  tore  open"
"the newspaper, revealing a cellophane bag filled with a brown, heroin-like substance. The"
"appellant was arrested shortly after, at approximately 11:20 PM."
"11. They proceeded to the Narcotic Bureau, where a field test and weighing of the substance"
"were conducted. The field test revealed that the substance from the appellant was heroin,"
"and the cellophane-wrapped package had a gross weight of 20 grams and 430 milligrams."
"The productions were subsequently sealed and given to reserve officer Bandara."
"12. The  main  ground 
for 
the  appeal 
is 
that 
the  High  Court 
Judge  overlooked  vital"
"contradictions  among 
the  prosecution  witnesses.  This 
led 
the 
judge 
to  the 
incorrect"
"conclusion that their testimonies were fully consistent."
