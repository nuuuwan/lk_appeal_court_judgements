"13. Since 
the  appellant's  primary  argument  focuses  on 
inconsistencies  both  within  and"
"between  the  prosecution's  evidence,  it's  appropriate to  examine  the  testimonies  of  PW1,"
"PW2, and PW5, as the prosecution heavily relied on their evidence to prove the charges"
"against the appellant. In this regard, following authorities would be of much relevance."
"14. In  evaluating  contradictions  inter-se  of  two  witnesses,  the  Judge  must  probe  whether"
"discrepancy  is  due  to  dishonesty,  or  defective  memory  or  whether  witness’s  power  of"
"observation was limited - per Colin Thome J. in Bandaranayake vs. Jagathsena [1984] 2"
"SLR  397.  Discrepancies  which  do  not  go  to  the  root  of  the  matter  and  shake  the  basic"
"version of the witnesses cannot be given too much importance. Boghi Bhai Hirji Bhai vs."
"State of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC 753."
"15. It can be observed from PW 1's testimony on page 72 that he did not reveal the specific"
"nature of the information he received from the informant over the phone. According to the"
"evidence of PW 1 and PW 2, they drove to  Aththidiya and parked their vehicle 100 yards"
"before  the  Maliban  Junction,  parking  the  jeep  on Atthidiya  Road  in  front  of  the  Keells"
"Super Market."
"16. PW1  further testified that the informant agreed to meet them on Aththidiya Road before"
"the  Maliban  Junction.  This  was  confirmed  by  PW2 
in  his 
testimony  on  page  197."
"However,  Asanka  Bandara  Edirisinghe  (PW5)  contradicts  PW1  and  PW2's  evidence"
"regarding where the informant met PW1."
"17. On  page  332,  PW5  explicitly  stated  that  the  Keells  Super  Market  was  on  Galle  Road,"
"located about 100 meters from the Maliban Junction toward Galle, on the land side. This"
"testimony  directly  contradicts  the  evidence  from  PW1  and  PW2,  who  both  claimed  the"
"Keells Super Market was on Aththidiya Road before the Maliban Junction."
"PW 5 testified as follows;"
