  "keywords": "The 2nd Respondent is an employee under the Petitioner as a driver, who was involved in an accident that resulted in the death of a passerby; he was then prosecuted before the Magistrate\u2019s Court, exonerated from all charges, and reinstated without back wages. The dispute was referred to arbitration, and the arbitral award in favour of the 2nd Respondent was granted. When the Petitioner challenged the said arbitral award, notice was refused since the arbitrator is justified in granting the award after having properly considered all the evidence.",
