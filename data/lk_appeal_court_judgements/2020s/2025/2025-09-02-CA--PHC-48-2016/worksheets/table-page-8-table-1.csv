"an  occupier 
is  to  prove  possession  or  occupation  under  a  valid  permit  or  written"
"authority issued by the State, with the burden of proof resting  on the occupier, whose"
"failure to establish such authority would necessitates an order of ejectment."
"The  Appellant  in  the  present  case  has  not  produced  any  valid  permit  or  authority.  His"
"reliance  on  alleged  “technical  defects”  such  as  typographical  errors  and 
inadvertent"
"omissions cannot override the strict limitations imposed by Section 9 of the Act."
"Even if the quit notice is challenged before or outside the proceedings under Section 09"
"of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act by way of a writ application, courts have"
"accepted 
the 
substantial 
compliance  doctrine9 
as 
the  notice 
is 
a 
jurisdictional"
"precondition to the Competent Authority’s application."
"In terms of Section 9(2) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, a respondent to"
"ejectment proceedings is precluded from raising objections based on alleged defects or"
"irregularities  in  the  quit  notice.  The  sole  permissible  defence  being  to  establish  lawful"

"(iv) Natural Justice"
"The Appellant alleged a violation of natural justice. This contention must fail. As held in"
"Farook v Gunawardene, Government Agent, Amparai,10 the Act is designed to secure the"
"speedy recovery of State lands, and as such, the opinion of the Competent Authority is"
"not subject to challenge before the Magistrate. The statutory safeguards lie in Sections"
"12 
and 
13, 
permitting 
separate 
proceedings 
to 
vindicate 
ownership 
or 
claim"
"compensation."
"The Appellant has had an opportunity to present his case at the inquiry held before the"
"Magistrate, but has failed to establish the only statutory defence. The learned Magistrate"
"has considered the title deed submitted by the Appellant (marked “X”) and has arrived at"
"a  determination  that  the  deed  submitted  by  the  Appellant  does  not  refer  to  the  land"
"described in the schedule of the quit notice."
