"13.  In Perera vs. The Attorney General [1998] 1 SLR 378, J. A. N. De Silva,"
"J, as he was then, has stated."
"“It  is  a  recognized  principle  that  in  a  case  of  this  nature,  the"
"prosecution must prove that the productions had been forwarded to"
"the  analyst  from  proper  custody,  without  allowing  room  for  any"
"suspicion  that  there  had  been  no  opportunity  for  tampering  or"
"interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst. Therefore,"
"it is correct to state that the most important journey is the inwards"
"journey because the final Analyst report will depend on that. The"
"outward journey does not attract the same importance.”"
