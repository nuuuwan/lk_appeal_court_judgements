"The above observation was followed by His Lordship W.L Ranjith Silva J,"
"in  the  Case  of  Don  Kuruppu  Arachchige  Indika  Gayan  v  The  Republic  of  Sri"
"Lanka, CA 205/2007, decided on 16th December 2010."
"Upon  reviewing  the  entire  evidence  presented  by  PW01,  we  observe  that  no"
"contradiction or omission has been brought to the court’s attention, except for the"
"discrepancy  mentioned  above.  Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the  rest  of  his"
"testimony remains consistent."
"Regarding the victim’s evidence, we acknowledge that his testimony was largely"
"consistent,  and  the  noted  contradiction  does  not  affect  his  credibility.  We  also"
"recognize that PW01 provided evidence after a lapse of nine years, during which"
"it is natural that he may not recall every minor detail—especially those he may"
"have  deemed  insignificant.  Additionally,  we  are  mindful  that  victims  of  sexual"
"harassment often choose not to discuss their experiences and prefer to move past"
"them."
"The  contradiction  pertains  only  to  whether  the  victim  attended  school  at  the"
"relevant time, and it does not influence the core incident itself. In our view, this"
"discrepancy  is  not  substantial  enough  to  create  reasonable  doubt  about  his"
"testimony. Therefore, we dismiss the contention raised by the defense counsel."
"One  of the  grounds urged  by  the  counsel  is that  there  is a  delay  in making  the"
"complaint. We acknowledge the timing of the incident—at the time, Aruna Lakshan was"
"only nine years old and had reported the matter to his mother. However, the mother did"
"not take any immediate action to report the incident to anyone. According to the victim,"
"he felt compelled to inform his mother as he had been subjected to repeated abuse by the"
"accused."
