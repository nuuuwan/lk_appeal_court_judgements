"We find no reason to doubt the testimony of PW01, as his evidence was consistent"
"and  could  be  relied  upon  to  support  his  allegations  against  the  appellant.  His"
"testimony remained intact despite cross-examination."
"In  cases  of  sexual  abuse,  delays in  reporting  are  common  due  to  fear  or  lack  of"
"awareness. Considering these factors, I am of the view that none of the grounds of"
"appeal presented by the appellant's counsel warrant interference with the findings"
"of the Learned High Court Judge."
"The  judgment  dated  30.05.2024  is  upheld,  and  the  conviction,  along  with  the"
"sentence, remains in effect."
"The appeal is dismissed."
