Thotawatte,J.

This appeal is against the order dated 26.11.2018 pronounced in favour of the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the“Respondents” and where necessary, individually as the 1st, and 2nd Respondents) by thelearned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Wayamba holden at Kurunegala,exercising revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution, wherebythe said Court upheld the order dated 22.05.2015 made by the learned Magistrate of theMagistrate’s Court of Kurunegala acting as the Primary Court Judge under the provisionsof the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter sometimes referred toas the “PCP Act”).

The information under Section 66(1)(b) of the PCP Act was lodged before the Magistrate’sCourt of Kurunegala by the Respondents on or about 19th May 2011. It was allegedtherein that the Respondent–Petitioner–Appellants (hereinafter collectively referred to asthe “Appellants,” and individually as the 1st and 2nd Appellants where relevant) had, on09th April 2011, unlawfully removed the existing boundary fence and erected a newfence, thereby appropriating a portion of the land belonging to a brother of theRespondents presently residing in Australia, and as such the Respondents have beendispossessed from the said portion of the land (hereinafter referred to as the “disputedportion of the land”).

Initially, after an inquiry, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge haddelivered an order dated 25th November 2011, dismissing the case on the grounds thatthe disputed portion of the land cannot be correctly identified. Consequent to an ordermade by the Provincial High Court, the Magistrate Court of Kurunegala has re-consideredthe matter and had delivered the order dated 22.05.2015 holding that the disputed fenceshould be removed and the disputed portion of the land to be restored to theRespondents.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellants had invokedthe revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Kurunagala. The learned HighCourt judge of Kurunegala, delivering her order dated 26.11.2018, has dismissed therevision application.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Judge of the High Court, the Appellantshave preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the order of the learned High Court Judgeand the order of the learned Magistrate inter alia on the following grounds.

The Honorable Judge of the Provincial High Court has failed to consider;

a. The exceptional circumstances outlined by the Appellants in the paragraph 13 ofthe Revision Application.b. The fact that there existed no breach of peace or imminent breach of peace withregard to the property subject matter to the action.c. The Respondents has no right of action to institute and proceed with the casebearing No. 33247/L/11 before the Magistrate’s Court of Kurunegala in terms ofthe Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. d. The Respondents did not have possession of the property subject matter to theaction.

In Nandawathie and Another v. Mahindasena1 His Lordship Ranjith Silva, J. analyzing theduty of an appellate court when sitting in appeal regarding a Judgement or order of theProvincial High Court delivered exercising revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b)of the Constitution, has stated;

“When an order of a Primary Court Judge made under this chapter is challenged byway of revision in the High Court the High Court Judge can examine only the legalityof that order and not the correctness of that order. The High Court may be able toprevent a breach of the peace by issuing interim stay orders or by allowing aninterim order made by the Primary Court Judge to remain in force. But what is theposition when a person aggrieved by such an order made in revision by the HighCourt is also appealed against to the Court of Appeal. Is the Court of Appeal vestedwith the power to re-hear or allow the parties to re-agitate the main case byreading and evaluating the evidence led in the case in the Primary Court or is it thatthe Court of Appeal is restricted in its scope and really have the power only toexamine the propriety or the legality of the order made by the learned High Court 12009 02 SLR 218 at page 238 CA PHC 242/2006 CAM 04.05.2009

judge in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. I hold that it is the only sensibleinterpretation or the logical interpretation that could be given otherwise the Courtof Appeal in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may be performing a functionthe legislature, primarily and strictly intended to avoid. For the reasons I haveadumbrated I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in thecircumstances should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense but in fact anapplication to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the order madeby the learned High Court Judge in the exercise of its revisionary powers”.

The judgment contains a clear, authoritative exposition by His Lordship Ranjith Silva, J.on:

1. The appellate jurisdiction invoked in these circumstances is of a restrictedcharacter.2. The Court is disallowed from re-opening the evidentiary record or undertaking afactual re-evaluation, functions reserved exclusively for the Primary Court.3. The appellate court’s remit extends solely to an examination of the legality,propriety, and procedural correctness of the High Court’s order made in revision,and does not permit an inquiry into the correctness of the Primary Court’s factualfindings.4. The appellate court must avoid performing a function the legislature “primarilyand strictly intended to avoid”

The instant appeal must be approached within the limited framework applicable toappeals from Provincial High Court orders made in the exercise of revisionary jurisdictionunder Article 154P(3)(b). The jurisprudence is unequivocal. A consistent line of authority—Jayasekarage Bandulasena et al. v. Galla Kankanamge Chaminda Kushantha et al.2,Wijamunige Charlis Godalhena (Deceased) at el. v. Weerappulige Ashoka Weerasinghe3,Ranawana Hewa Vitharanalage Anoma Geethanjali Samarasena v. Officer in Charge,Police Station, Kandy4, R.D. Somadasa and another v. Additional Commotional of AgrarianService and another5, and Muthusami Loganathan v. Walpale Gedara Malani Manjalikaand another6,establishes that such appeals are not “true appeals” in the classical sense.

The Court of Appeal is confined to reviewing the correctness, legality, propriety, andregularity of the High Court’s exercise of revision.

The Court therefore has no jurisdiction to re-hear the matter, re-evaluate the evidence,or correct errors (if any) of the Magistrate or Primary Court. Its sole task is to ascertainwhether the High Court properly exercised its revisionary powers, including whether itcorrectly assessed the presence or absence of exceptional circumstances warrantingintervention. In the absence of demonstrable illegality, impropriety, irregularity, ormisdirection by the High Court in applying the principles of revision, the appellate courtmust refrain from interference.

Accordingly, unless the Appellant can demonstrate a manifest error amounting to amiscarriage of justice in the High Court’s exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction, the appealmust necessarily fail.

It is stated in the paragraph 16 (b) of the petition of appeal submitted to this court that;

“The Honorable Judge of the Provincial High Court has failed to consider the exceptionalcircumstances outlined by the Appellants in the paragraph 13 of the RevisionApplication”.

However, on perusal of paragraph 13, it appears that although described as exceptionalcircumstances, what is contained are merely grounds of appeal.

In Dharmaratne and Another v. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and Others7 His LordshipGamini Amaratunga, J. observed that:

“Thus, the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which theCourt selects the cases in respect of which this extra-ordinary method ofrectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there, revisionaryjurisdiction of this Court will become a gateway for every litigant to make a secondappeal in the garb of a revision application or to make an appeal in situationswhere the legislature has not given right of appeal”

If exceptional circumstances are not required, the revisionary jurisdiction would inevitablybe used as a substitute for a full appeal, allowing parties to obtain appellate review insituations where the law has neither granted nor intended to grant such a right. Thiswould disrupt the statutory appeal structure and defeat its intended purpose. As such,

“the existence of exceptional circumstances is a precondition for the exercise of thepowers of revision”8.

It is now well-settled that the revisionary jurisdiction is an extraordinary and residualremedy, exercisable only upon the demonstration of exceptional circumstances. In orderto succeed, an applicant must establish fundamental illegality, procedural impropriety,jurisdictional error, or such grave and irremediable prejudice that non-intervention wouldresult in a miscarriage of justice. The courts have further held that revision lies onlywhere the circumstances disclose denial of justice, irremediable harm, or a defectincapable of being remedied through the ordinary appellate structure. Thus, interventionis justified only if allowing the impugned order to stand would be unjust, inequitable, orlegally intolerable, and not where the complaint concerns mere error, disagreement, ordissatisfaction with factual evaluation.9

In Hon. Attorney General v. Thusaya Hakuru Weerarathne and another10, His LordshipJustice Sasi Mahendran, reaffirmed the governing limits of the revisionary jurisdiction byadopting and quoting with approval the dictum of His Lordship Sarath N. Silva, C.J., inAthurupana v. Premasinghe11, in the following terms:

“Every illegality, impropriety or irregularity does not warrant the exercise ofrevisionary jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction will be exercised only where the illegality,impropriety or irregularity in the proceedings has resulted in a miscarriage ofjustice, by the party affected being denied what is lawfully and justly due to thatparty. In such event the Court will in revision set right the illegality, impropriety orirregularity by passing any judgment or making any order as the interests of justicemay require.”

The learned High Court Judge has properly evaluated the evidence presented and hascome to the correct conclusion that the Appellant has failed to establish any grounds thatcould be considered as exceptional grounds.

Further the learned High Court Judge has also observed that the learned Magistrateacting as the Primary Court Judge had correctly decided that the ownership of therelevant land is immaterial to a matter relating to proceedings under Section 66 of the

PCP Act and that the documentation submitted supporting Appellants’ claim by themdoes not refer to the portion of land from which the Respondents had been dispossessed.

Therefore, it is evident that no exceptional circumstances had been disclosed that wouldwarrant the learned High Court Judge’s exercise of revisionary jurisdiction to set aside theorder of the learned Magistrate. Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge was correct indeclining to interfere with that order.

In view of the foregoing reasons, we see no reason for us to set aside the order of thelearned Magistrate dated 22.05.2015 as well as the order of the learned High Court Judgedated 26.11.2018.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
