Therefore, the 2nd respondent has no jurisdiction to impose forfeiture under Section 50A of the Customs Ordinance against the petitioners. The respondents have tacitly admitted this position by issuing new instructions for the year 2023/2024 with regard to the disposal of waste. The petitioner produced a copy of the new instructions issued by the Sri Lanka Customs, marked CA (1) (b). A comparison of these instructions with those issued for the previous years demonstrates that there was no such instruction relating to the disposal of waste in the earlier period.

Although the respondent stated the above in their objections, in fact, Sri Lanka Customs have issued \u2018write-off notes\u2019, and a large number of such notes are produced by the petitioner along with the petition. Therefore, the argument that the Sri Lanka Customs does not issue write-off notes is not acceptable. The TIEP-1 scheme requires a MCE to obtain approvals for the wastage factor/conversion ratio of the raw material (inputs) used to manufacture finished goods. The petitioners produced the approval documents issued by the Ministry of Commerce and the Bond Division of the Sri Lanka Customs (P3 (a) (1) to P3 (a) (8)). Sri Lanka Customs issues write-off notes of customs duties in respect of raw material (inclusive of waste generated) after reconciling with such inputs with the finished goods using the approved conversion ratio. Until the write-off notes are issued, the customs duties/levies remain payable. After the issuance of such write-off notes in respect of inputs, there can be no loss of revenue to the Government by the disposal of waste.The petitioners disposed of the waste that was generated during the production of finished goods. They neither retained nor disposed of any imported raw materials to any third party.",

    "text": "It is on common ground that the impugned consignment was imported under the TIEP and Bonding Facility Scheme. Under the said scheme, the Petitioners are allowed to import only certain permitted items without customs duties or other payable levies. The said Scheme has been introduced to assist exporters by exempting them from paying fiscal levies on the importation of goods needed to manufacture goods for export. It is undue and unlawful for the Petitioners to enjoy such a duty exemption to import other (non permitted) items for personal use or any other purpose. In the above-mentioned case, the petitioners were allowed to import accessories for the garment industry and to export value-added goods under the TIEP-1 scheme. In that case, the container imported by the petitioners contained certain undeclared cosmetics, two ceramic commodes, and three ceramic wash basins. Those three items were first, not declared and, second, not allowed under the TIEP-1 scheme. In that case, the court was never invited by the parties to determine whether the TIEP-1 scheme exempted customs duties and levies at the stage of importing raw materials. The issue of whether the raw materials were exempted from customs duties did not arise for consideration. Further, the facts of that case are clearly distinguishable from those of the present case. Therefore, the above-mentioned case is not relevant to the case in hand. The respondents have argued that, as the petitioner had paid the fine of Rs. 100,000/- imposed by the 2nd respondent, the petitioners have acquiesced in the jurisdiction of the Inquiring Officer and therefore cannot challenge the jurisdiction of the Inquiring Officer. When the Inquiring Officer has no jurisdiction, the agreement of the petitioner cannot grant jurisdiction to the Inquiring Officer. As discussed earlier, the 2nd respondent could not have applied the provisions containing Section 50A of the Customs Ordinance. This can be considered a patent lack of jurisdiction.",

A Court may lack jurisdiction over the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects ; the first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as a \u2018 patent \u2019 or \u2018 total \u2019 want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the second a \u2018 latent \u2019 or \u2018 contingent \u2019 want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders which are void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature ; Sansoni, J.stated as follows inKandy Omnibus Company Ltd. v. Roberts 56 N. L. R. page 293 \u201cIt is not open to a person to confer jurisdiction by consent and no amount of acquiescence confers jurisdiction upon a Tribunal or Court where such jurisdiction did not exist.\u201d The lack of jurisdiction here is a patent lack of jurisdiction and, as such, could not be cured by acquiescence. Furthermore, the 2nd petitioner specifically stated that he had to do so, as failure to pay the fine would result in serious personal consequences, including loss of personal liberty. The 2nd petitioner, in his affidavit, stated there was a threat of arrest if he did not comply with the order. The petitioners have exhausted the other remedies. After the decision of the 2nd respondent dated 24-05-2022, the petitioners appealed to the Minister of Finance (P8). The Finance Minister did not allow the petitioners' appeal. The respondents contended that the petitioners had failed to exhaust the remedy provided under section 154(1) of the Customs Ordinance. Section 154(1) of the Customs Ordinance is as follows;",
