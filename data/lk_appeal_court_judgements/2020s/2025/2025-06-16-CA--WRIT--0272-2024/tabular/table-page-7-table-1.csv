"it is merely a rule of construction, not a rule of law”. Further, Farwell L.J., has"
"enunciated in Tillmanns and Co. v. SS. Knutsford 1908 2 KB 385 at pages"
"402  to  403  that  “there  is  no  room  for  the  application  of  the  ejusdem  generis"
"doctrine  unless  there  is  a  genus  or  class  or  category  –  perhaps  category  is  the"
"better  word….”.  Though,  in  this  matter,  the  cause  related  to  continuation  of"
"proceedings before  new judge Advocate, the provision of section 42(3) is clear"
"and unambiguous."
"18] I now consider the application of the legal maxim generalia specialibus non"
"derogant. Justice Griffith said in R v Greenwood, [1992] 7 O.R. (3d) 1, “The"
"maxim  generalia  specialibus  non  derogant  means  that,  for  the  purposes  of"
"interpretation  of  two  statutes  in  apparent  conflict,  the  provisions  of  a  general"
"statute must yield to those of a special one. “In the case in hand, the section 42(3)"
"of the Navay Acy and no direct impact or conflict on section 48 of the Judication"
"Act.  However,  the  Respondents  try  to  expand  the  scope  of  appointing  a  new"
"adjudge-Advocate without dissolution of the existing court martial."
"19] In Lalonde v Sun Life, [1992] 3 SCR 261, Justice Gonthier had expressed"
"in his opinion with regard to above legal maxim as: “The principle is, therefore,"
"that where there are provisions in a special Act and in a general Act on the same"
"subject  which  are  inconsistent,  if  the  special  Act  gives  a  complete  rule  on  the"
"subject, the expression of the rule acts as an exception to the subject-matter of the"
"rule  from  the  general  Act.”  In  the  instant  case,  the  appointing  authority  had"
"appointed  a  Judge-Advocate  afresh  when  the  incumbent  Judge-Advocate  has"
"accepted a post in another institution. Thus, the both statutes have no direct"
"impact or inconsistency."
"20]      However,  our  superior  courts  have  held  that  where  a  given  provision"
"appears to fall within the scope of more than one provision of a statute, Courts"
"have consistently held that specific provision must be operative while the general"
"provision must be taken to affect only of other parts of the Statute to which it"
"may  properly  apply  [Campbell  &  Co.  v.  Wijesekere  21  N.L.R.  431;  Ceylon"
"Insurance  Company  Ltd.,  v.  Diesel  and  Motor  Engineering  Company  Ltd."
"(supra); Brown & Co., Ltd v. G. S. Fernando [1986] 2 S.L.R. 177]."
"21] In HENDRICK APPUHAMY vs. JOHN APPUHAMY 69 NLR 29, His Lordship"
"SANSONI, C.J. considered the provisions of the Paddy Lands Act as a special"
"Act and held that there is sole machinery which was introduced by the said Act"
"and a landlord to evict his tenant cultivator by the Act should follow the special"
"machinery.  The  court  held  the  Act  takes  away  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Courts."
"Thus,  the  court  held  that  the  action  was  not  maintainable  and  the  Plaintiff"
"should have sought his remedy under the Paddy Lands Act and should not have"
"filed  action  in  the  District  Court.  Thus,  it  is  apparent  that  the  Navy  Act  is  a"
"special Act and its provisions should prevail over any other Act."
