"13] The section 42(3) says;"
"“42(3) Where the Judge-Advocate of a court martial dies or is unable to"
"attend the court martial owing to illness or any other cause, the court"
"martial  shall  adjourn  and  the  president  shall  report  the  circumstances  to"
"the authority by whom the court martial was ordered to be held; and in the"
"case of the death of the Judge-Advocate, or where the authority by whom"
"the  court  martial  was  ordered  to  be  held  is  of  the  opinion  that  it  is"
"inexpedient  to  delay  the  trial  until  the  Judge-Advocate  who  is"
"unable to attend the court martial is able to do so, the court martial"
"shall be dissolved.” [Emphasis is added]"
