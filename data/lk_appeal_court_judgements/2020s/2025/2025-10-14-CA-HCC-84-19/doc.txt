JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Accused’) was indicted

before the High Court of Puttalam for possession and Trafficking 20.41g of heroin

under Section 54 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No. 13

of 1984, as amended.

At the trial, the prosecution led evidence through 7 witnesses and marking

productions P1-P18, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in his defence,

gave evidence in the witness box. After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge

found the accused guilty on both counts in the indictment and sentenced him to

life imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by said judgment, this appeal was preferred by the Accused. The

following Grounds of Appeal were urged by the counsel for the Accused.

1. The Learned Trial judge has failed to consider the failure of the prosecution

to prove the chain relating to the inward journey of the productions that

were tendered to the Government Analyst beyond a reasonable doubt.

2. The Learned Trial judge has failed to give conscious consideration to the

inter se contradictions and inherent improbabilities of the story of the

prosecution and the lacunas in the investigation carried out by PW 01 -

Ruwanthilake Bandara, thereby denying the Accused Appellant of his right

to a fair investigation.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to properly consider the Dock statement

of the Accused Appellant

The facts of this case and the background to the incident may be set out briefly as

follows;

According to the testimony of PW 01, Jayathilakage Ruwan Thilaka Bandara, who

was serving as a Sub Inspector of Police attached to the Puttalam Police Station,

he departed the station on 29th October 2013 at approximately 2:45 p.m.,

accompanied by PW 02 and Police Constable Lionel, for roadblock duty at

Lunulinda Junction, Sirambiadiya, Puttalam. They arrived at the junction around

3:00 p.m. and positioned themselves on the left side of the road to monitor vehicles

travelling from Puttalam towards Anuradhapura from Puttlam. After inspecting

several vehicles, at approximately 3:45 p.m., PW 02 stopped a blue-colored three-

wheeler bearing registration number WPYW2086, which appeared suspicious.

PW 01 initially questioned the driver regarding their whereabouts, to which the

driver responded that they were travelling from Colombo to Anuradhapura. The

accused was seated in the passenger seat, and PW 01, having observed the

accused’s evasive behaviour and lack of eye contact, instructed PW 02 to search.

PW 02 first examined the bag, which yielded no items of concern. Upon inspecting

the accused, PW 02 recovered a mobile phone and discovered a yellow-coloured

parcel marked "W50" in the right pocket of the accused’s shorts. The parcel was

wrapped in cello tape, newspaper, and a pink grocery bag, all of which were

removed by the witness, revealing a powdery substance contained within. At the

same time driver had tried to walk away from the three-wheeler, then he was

stopped and searched. They found a parcel in his pocket and found that it

contained a similar substance. Then this officer took the custody of the two parcels

marked with separate identification on both parcels, and then returned to the

station. Thereafter, he sealed both parcels and handed over the productions to the

reserved duty officer, PC 5360 Karunarathna, entering the production in 194/13

and 191/13.

On the morning of 30.10.2013, PW-01, accompanied by PW-02, PC Lionel, and the

Accused, proceeded to the pharmacist at Puttalam Hospital for the purpose of

weighing the substance. It should be note that he has not mentioned the name

Page 5 of 11

person where he collected the production The net weight was recorded as 49,857

grams. Thereafter, they returned to the police station around 11:40 A.M. and

entered the production in the PR No.200/13, handed over to the production to PC

78156 Wickramarathna, who was on reserved duty at 12:10. Thereafter, he took

the accused to the Magistrate Court of Puttalam, where the accused was

remanded. During the trial, production was shown to him, and he identified the

production.

During the cross-examination, he stated that he had received the production from

PC 78156 Wickramarathna around 9:30 a.m. to weigh it. Vide page 150 of the

brief.

He further stated that he handed over the production to PW 11, PC 78120

Wickramarathna at approximately 11:40 a.m.

According to the testimony of PW 02, PC 12118 Ajith Susantha, he has

corroborated the evidence of PW 01. According to him he has accompanied the PW

01 with other officer proceeded to the Lunulinda Junction where they stop this

three wheeler arrested the driver and the accused and searched them and found

the production from their pockets and arrested and brought to the police station

and production was hand over to the PC 5360 Karunarathna before hand over the

production it was entered in the PR no. 193/13. The witness stated that they were

unable to bring any notebooks to the scene and, as a result, recorded their notes

only after returning to the police station.

According to the testimony of PW-11, Asanka Wickremaratne, on 30.10.2013 at

11:40 a.m., under P.R. 200/13, the production was handed over to him by PW-01.

The witness asserted that on the same day, after securing production in the police

station’s safety locker, it was released to PW-04, Karunaratne, at 5:35 p.m. (Vide

page 259 of the brief).

On the same day, he received the production from PW 11 at 17.35 hours.

Furthermore, on 31.10, 01.11, and 02.11, there were multiple instances in which

the witness handed over the production to PC 7648 Viraj. During cross-

examination, the witness affirmed that he had worked continuously for five days

alongside PC Viraj, each day on a 12-hour shift.

PW 05, Police Constable 7648 Viraj, received the productions under No. PR No.

200/13 from PW 04, 4.45 p.m. on 31.10.2013. On 2nd November 2013, he handed

over the production to 79123 Danushka, who has taken it to the government

analyst.

The accused, giving evidence, has stated that he was returning from his wife’s

residence when, during the journey, the officers stopped the vehicle, and another

three-wheeler was there. After 15 minutes, the officers have instructed them to

proceed, allegedly saying “ෙරි මෙං ඹගොලගලා ෙන්න”. Shortly thereafter, the police

searched, and the Accused claims that the officers planted two packets of heroin

in his and the driver’s pockets. He further states that they were produced before

the Magistrate approximately one hour later and were subsequently held in

Page 8 of 11

custody for four days, during which no officer came to record a statement from

them.

The Learned High Court Judge rejected the defence argument concerning

ownership of the vehicle, noting that although the vehicle belonged to the Accused,

the driver possessed a valid driving license, rendering the objection immaterial.

The Judge further observed that the Accused had not previously denied ownership

of the heroin, when the police had placed them before the Magistrate.

We note that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to address the

inconsistency surrounding the handing over of the productions on 30.10.2013.

According to the testimony of PW 01, the productions were handed over to him by

PW 11 on that date. However, PW 11 asserts that he received the productions

200/13 only after they were weighed at the hospital around 11.40 a.m.

On the other hand, PW 04 testified that he handed the productions under PR NO

191/13, to PW 01 for the purpose of measurement, which was received by PW 01.

Also, he confirmed that he received the production from PW 11. We note that when

PW 01 gave evidence, he failed to mention from whom he got the production on

that day. But he asserts that the production he received from the reserve under

PR No: 191/13. PW 04 stated that his duty is a 12-hour shift, 18.30 received the

production according. Witness No. P11 Asanka confirmed that he handed over the

production to PW 04 at 17.35p.m.

I am mindful of the observation made by J.A.N. De Silva.J. as he was then in

Perera V. Attorney General 1998 (1) SLR page 378 at page 380:

“It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the

prosecution must prove that the productions had been forwarded to

the Analyst from proper custody, without allowing room for any

suspicion that there had been no opportunity for tampering or

interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst. Therefore

it is correct to state that the most important journey is the inwards

Page 9 of 11

journey because the final Analyst report will be depend on that. The

outward journey does not attract the same importance.”

It is acknowledged that PW 01, in his testimony, stated that he received the

production from PC 78156. However, he gave this evidence without referring to

the relevant notes. This oversight could have been rectified had the Learned State

Counsel directed the witness to refer to his notes in the Information Book. Notably,

the State Counsel also failed to address and correct this discrepancy during re-

examination.

On the other hand, PW 4 and PW 11 have clearly indicated how they acted

regarding the production. And also, this court is concerned that the failure of the

state counsel to properly prosecute the evidence and not giving a reason gives an

advantage to the defence. If the state counsel was vigilant before he closed the

prosecution, he should have asked the PW 01 to clear any doubt by relying on PW

01 by perusing the inward and outward journey on 30.10.2013.

It is noted that the Learned High Court Judge failed to address the inconsistency

surrounding the handling and transfer of productions on 30.10.2013. According to

the testimony of PW 01, the productions were handed over to him by PW 11 on

that date. However, PW 11 stated that he received the productions marked 200/13

only after they were weighed at the hospital. Furthermore, PW 04 testified that

he handed over the productions to PW 01 for measurement under PR No. 191/13,

which PW 01 acknowledged receiving. PW 04 also confirmed that he had received

the productions from PW 11.

During his examination-in-chief, PW 01 failed to specify the source from which he

obtained the productions on the relevant day. PW 04 testified that he was on a 12-

hour duty shift and received the productions at 18:30. He also stated that he had

handed over the productions to PW 01 at approximately 09:30 a.m. Furthermore,

PW 11, Asanka, testified that he received the productions from PW 01 at around

11:40 a.m. and later handed them over to PW 04 at 17:35 p.m.

Page 10 of 11

Although it is acknowledged that PW 01 received the productions from officer

78156, his testimony was provided without reference to the relevant records. It is

important to note that, at the time of giving evidence, PW 01 was no longer

attached to the police—a fact observed by the Learned High Court Judge. It is

pertinent to reproduce that part of the judgment.

Page 315 of the brief,

“විප ේෂපයන්ම උ.ප ො. බණ්ඩොර සොක්ි පදන අවසේථොව වන විට ප ොලිසේ පස්ේවපේ සිටි

නිළධොරිපයකු පනොවන අතර ඔහු පමම නඩුපව් චූදිත පනො ළ වරද ට ැටලවීපේ සේවරෑ යකින්

සොක්ි දුන් බවක් මො නිරීක්ෂණය පනො රන ලදි.”

This oversight should have been rectified by the Learned State Counsel, who failed

to instruct the witness to refer to his inward and outward journey entries recorded

in the Information Book—an action permissible under the Evidence Ordinance.

Moreover, the Learned State Counsel did not take any steps to clarify this issue

during the re-examination of the witness.

On the other hand, PW 04 and PW 11 have clearly articulated their respective

roles in the handling of the productions. However, this Court is compelled to

express concern over the Learned State Counsel’s failure to adequately prosecute

the evidence and address the inconsistencies that have arisen, which

inadvertently operate to the advantage of the defence. Had the State Counsel

exercised due diligence prior to closing the prosecution, these uncertainties could

have been resolved by directing PW 01 to read and verify the relevant entries in

the Information Book, including his inward and outward journey records.

The fact remains that the Accused was arrested in 2013 in possession of 25.41

grams of pure heroin. However, judgment in the case was delivered only in 2019.

In light of the evidentiary gaps and procedural shortcomings, particularly the

failure of PW 01 to consult the relevant records before testifying, despite having

the right to do so. I am of the view that this case warrants a retrial.

Page 11 of 11

In view of the foregoing reasons, we are inclined to set aside the conviction, the

impugned judgment, and the sentence imposed on 09.03.2019.

Retrial ordered.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment together with the

original case record to the High Court of Puttalam for compliance.
