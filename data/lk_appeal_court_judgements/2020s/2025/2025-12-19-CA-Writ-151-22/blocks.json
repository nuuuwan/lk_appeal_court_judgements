It is also observed that in the attestation, the notary had stated that no consideration had passed between the parties in the notary's presence. I also observe that, though the Petitioner claims that he owns the portion depicted in Schedule \u201cB\u201d which says the said portion is divided, it is a larger portion of land consisting of 429 Acres 1 Rood and 12 Perches. However, there is no plan referred to in the Schedule to identify the exact portion depicted in the said Schedule \u201cB\u201d. Hence, in the circumstances, it appears that though the said deed describes the said portion of the land as divided, it is not demarcated as the boundaries depicted in the Schedule are not depicted in a plan.

Hence, in view of the conflicting situation taken by the said Thirumal the declarant of 1R1 and the alleged vendor of P2, the execution and whether any title was intended to be given to the Petitioner becomes a disputed fact.",

In the submissions, the Counsel for the Respondents made a comment on the date of signing of the deed and the date of attestation as the date of signing falls within the prohibitive period and the date of executing is subsequent to the Law coming into operation.

Further, the said declarant, Thirumal, had not challenged the vesting of the land under the Law by the Respondent. In fact, he has declared the entire land as land in excess and also obtained compensation from the 1st Respondent subsequent to the land being vested with the 1st Respondent and subsequent to the statutory determination. Hence, it is not open to the Petitioner now to contest the vesting of the land when the original declarant did not contest the vesting of the said land.

The Petitioner has failed to explain why he has not complied with the requirements of the said Gazette. Hence, in my view the Petitioner after sleeping over his rights since 1985 now cannot stake a claim to a land so vested which is nearly after more than few decades of the publication of 1R5. Especially, the Petitioner should have staked a claim to the 1st Respondent whose head office is situated in Colombo. Hence, even if we are to consider that the land could have been in an area where there was an armed conflict in the year 1985, it does not deter the Petitioner from acting pursuant to section 13 and 1R5 and making his claim to the 1st Respondent, whose head office is situated in Colombo.",
