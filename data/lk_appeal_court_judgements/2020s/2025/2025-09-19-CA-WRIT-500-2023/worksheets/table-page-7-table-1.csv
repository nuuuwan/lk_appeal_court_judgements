"T
he Petitioner states that he had participated in the arbitrations and had submitted the documents"
"marked  පැ5(1)-පැ5(34),  which  he  states  indicates  the  repayments  of  the  loans  made  by  him.8"
"However, it is observed that the Petitioner has not annexed any documents to the petition in proof"
"of such fact or indicating the position taken up by him at the arbitration. The Petitioner had been"
"found liable in all arbitrations and ordered to pay a cumulative amount of  Rs. 158,149,623/= as"
"principal and interest in default. In the instant application, the Petitioner has sought to impugn the"
"arbitral awards marked පැ6(1)-පැ6(96)."
"T
he Petitioner appears to have preferred appeals in respect of some of the aforementioned arbitral"
"awards. Although such appeals have been identified as පැ7(1)-පැ7(56) in the petition, a perusal of"
"the  docket  reveals  that  only  the  documents  marked  පැ7(1)-පැ7(4)  and  පැ7(8),  පැ7(11),  පැ7(14),"
"පැ7(17), පැ7(20), පැ7(23), පැ7(26), පැ7(29) and පැ7(32) constitute appeals and that the documents"
"marked පැ7(35)-පැ7(56) appear to be statements made by the Petitioner on 08.08.2023 in relation"
"to the said appeals at the Office of the Assistant Commissioner of Co-operative Development of the"
"Colombo District. The petition also does not disclose the outcome of the Petitioner’s appeals and"
"neither did the learned Counsel for the  Petitioner offer any clarification in respect of the above"
"matters when the application was taken up for support. In their limited objections, the 3rd and 4th"
"Respondents have stated that the Petitioner had preferred appeals only in respect of 15 awards"
"and that they were pending before Commissioner of Co-operative Development.9"
"T
he  limited  objections  of  the  3rd  and  4th  Respondents  also  disclose  that  the  Society  had  sought"
"enforcement in respect of 97 arbitral awards where the Petitioner had not preferred appeals in"
"terms of section 59 of the Statute. It was clarified by learned Counsel that such proceedings were"
"pending. However, the sole reference made in the petition is to Case No. 1415/18 instituted in the"
"Magistrates’ Court of Nugegoda and proceedings in such case have been annexed to the petition"
"marked පැ10. The relief sought in paragraph (ඊ) of the prayer to the petition too relate to the said"
"case.  A  perusal  of  the  proceedings  පැ10  disclose  that  the  aforementioned  case  is  a  criminal"
"prosecution filed by the Officer-in-Charge, Criminal Investigation Unit of the Criminal Investigation"
"Department against 13 accused, including the Petitioner, who has been cited as the 4th accused.10"
"In fact, it has been stated in the limited objections of the 3rd and 4th Respondents that investigations"
"had  commenced  pursuant  to  complaints  made  by  depositors  who  were  unable  to  recover  their"
"deposits.11  Hence,  as  submitted  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondents,  the  said  Case  No."
"1415/18 does not have any bearing or relevance to the enforcement of the arbitral awards against"
"the Petitioner. In similar vein, I observe that the Petitioner has failed to provide information on the"
"enforcement proceedings relating to the arbitral awards to this Court."
