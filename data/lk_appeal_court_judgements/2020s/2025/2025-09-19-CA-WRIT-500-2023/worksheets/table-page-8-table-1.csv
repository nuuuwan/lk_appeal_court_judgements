"When the application was taken up for support, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted"
"that the entries in official records maintained by the Society had been fraudulently altered by the"
"current office bearers as an act of revenge against the Petitioner and that he had also not been"
"permitted 
to 
inspect  such 
records  or  provided 
information  requested  under 
the  Right 
to"
"Information Act. He also referred to section 31(1) of the Statute relating to proof of entries in books"
"of the Society. In addition, he submitted that certain awards referred to loans obtained from the"
"Padukka MPCS, of which he was not even a member.13 It was also submitted that the Petitioner had"
"been  unable  to  prefer  appeals  in  respect  of  all  awards  due  to  the  inability  to  furnish  a  security"
"deposit as required by section 58(3) of the Statute."
"I
n response, both learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the fact that the loans had"
"been taken by the Petitioner and he was in default was properly documented in the official records"
"of  the  Society.  The  Statement  of  Petitioner’s  Loan  Account  annexed  to  the  petition  marked"
"පැ9(117)-  පැ9(118)  confirms  that  a  cumulative  amount  of  Rs.  158,149,623/=  as  principal  and"
"interest was in default as at 20.08.2020.14 Regarding the reference to the Padukka MPCS in certain"
"awards, it was submitted by Counsel for the Respondents that such reference was an oversight and"
"that no prejudice had been caused to the Petitioner thereby since the arbitral reference number,"
"loan particulars and amounts had been correctly set out in the said awards."
"I
n relation to evidence of repayment, learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted that some of"
"the  documents  relied  upon  by  the  Petitioner  (පැ5(20)-පැ5(30)  were 
illegible  and  that 
if  any"
"repayments had in fact been made, they would be recorded in the official loan accounts."
"T
he  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondents  also  contended  that,  as  reflected  in  the  proceedings"
"පැ10(a), the learned Magistrate in Case No. 1415/18 had merely recorded that a forensic audit had"
"not  been  conducted  and  that  the  order  made  by  him  was  a  direction  to  the  Commissioner  to"
"conduct an audit and submit the report of same.  Accordingly, they submitted that there was no"
"order directing a forensic audit, and, that in any event, the said case had no relevance to the arbitral"
"awards impugned in the instant application."
"I
 now wish to examine the circumstances relating to the conduct of the arbitrations in issue in the"
"instant application. In the first instance, I observe that, since loans obtained by the Petitioner from"
"the Society were in default, a “dispute” existed between such parties that was capable of being"
"referred to arbitration under section 58 (2) of the Statute. It is further observed that the Petitioner"
"too has not challenged the reference of disputes to arbitration. Prior to the commencement of the"
"arbitration,  the  Petitioner  had  received  letter  demands  පැ9(1)-පැ9(116).  Distinct  summons  to"
"attend  and  produce  oral  and  documentary  evidence  at  the  arbitral  inquiries  in  respect  of  each"
"reference been served on the Petitioner, as evidenced by the documents marked පැ3(1)-පැ3(114)"
"and පැ4(1)-පැ4(92). In the petition, the Petitioner has stated that he had attended the inquiries and"
"had submitted the documents marked පැ5(1)-පැ5(34) in proof of repayment (vide paragraph 7). I"
"also wish to observe that, since the Petitioner has not annexed any documentary evidence that he"
"had tendered at the arbitral inquiries or the proceedings of such inquiries to the petition, this Court"
"is not in a position to examine the veracity or otherwise of the several allegations that were made"
"when  the 
instant  application  was  taken  up  for  support.  Such  allegations 
included  the  non-"
"consideration of evidence of repayment submitted by him, fraudulent alteration of official records"
"of the Society, and acts of revenge by certain parties against him."
