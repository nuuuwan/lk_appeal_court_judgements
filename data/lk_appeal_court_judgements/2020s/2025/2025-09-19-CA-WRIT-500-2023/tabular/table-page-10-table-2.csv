"petitioner seeking relief from Court was set out by the Supreme Court in the following terms (per"
"Yapa J);"
"â€œ
When a litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters into a contractual"
"obligation with the Court. This contractual relationship requires the petitioner to disclose all"
"material facts correctly and frankly. This is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from Court."
"In the case of Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Limited v. Wilfred Van Els and Two Others,20 the Court"
"highlighted this contractual obligation which a party enters into with the Court, requiring the"
"need to disclose uberrima fides and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to Court. Any"
"party who misleads Court, misrepresents facts to Court or utters falsehood in Court will not be"
"entitled to obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established proposition of law, since Courts"
"expect a party seeking relief to be frank and open with the Court. This principle has been"
"applied even in an application that has been made to challenge a decision made without"
"jurisdiction. Further, Court will not go into the merits of the case in such situations. Vide Rex v."
