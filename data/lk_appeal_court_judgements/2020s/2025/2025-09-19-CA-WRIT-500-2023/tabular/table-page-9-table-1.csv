"I observe that the awards in respect of each reference had been communicated to the Petitioner"
"under  the  hand  of  the  respective  arbitrator,  as  evidenced  by  පැ6(1)-පැ6(96).  The  said  awards"
"contain, inter alia, the Petitioner’s liability in respect of the loan, order and a time limit for payment"
"and the availability of an appeal including applicable time limit and security requirements."
"A
s  evidenced  by  the  documents  marked  පැ7(1)-පැ7(4)  and  පැ7(8),  පැ7(11),  පැ7(14),  පැ7(17),"
"පැ7(20),  පැ7(23),  පැ7(26),  පැ7(29),  පැ7(32)  and  පැ7(35)-පැ7(56),  at  least  in  respect  of  certain"
"awards, the Petitioner has exercised the right of appeal conferred by section 58(3) of the Statutes"
"and  had  made  written  statements  on  08.08.2023  relating  to  such  appeals  at  the  Office  of  the"
"Assistant Commissioner of Co-operative Development of the Colombo District."
"I
t  is  evident  from  the  above  narrative  that  the  arbitration  proceedings  have  been  conducted  in"
"accordance with the provisions of section 58 of the Statute and I am unable to find any illegality or"
"irrationality  either  in  the  procedure  adopted  or  the  awards  made.  Considering  the  fact  that  the"
"Petitioner had  not  complied  with  the  awards,  the  Respondents  were  entitled  in  law  to  institute"
"enforcement proceedings under section 59 of the Statute. Such a course of action too cannot be"
"considered as being illegal or irrational. In this regard, I am inclined to agree with the Respondents"
"that a forensic audit is not a requirement in the arbitral enforcement proceedings."
"I
t is trite law that, in an application for judicial review, the scope of inquiry that a Court is mandated"
"to undertake  relates  to an  examination  of  the  legality of  the  impugned order,  as  opposed to  its"
"merits Such distinction between judicial review and appeal on merits has been articulated in the"
"celebrated text Wade & Forsyth’s Administrative Law15 in the following terms;"
"T
he system of judicial review is radically different from the system of appeals. When  hearing an"
"appeal, the court is concerned with the merits of a decision: is it correct? When subjecting some"
"administrative act or order to judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality: is it within the"
"limits of the powers granted? On an appeal the question is ‘right or wrong?’ On review the question"
"is ‘lawful or unlawful?’16"
"I
n the aforementioned circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish"
"that the conduct of the Respondents is either illegal or irrational or has occasioned any procedural"
"impropriety warranting the intervention of this Court sitting in judicial review."
