"Kensington Income Tax Commissioners; Princess Edmond De Polignac.21 This principle of"
"uberrima fides has been applied not only in writ cases where discretionary relief is sought from"
"Court, but even in Admiralty cases involving the grant of injunctions.”"
"In my view, the aforementioned conduct on the part of the Petitioner demonstrates a serious lack"
"of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner in failing to make a full and fair disclosure of all"
"material facts. Hence, I uphold the objection raised by Counsel for the Respondents."
"(b) Availability of Alternative Remedies"
"T
he learned State Counsel submitted that a statutory right of appeal had been accorded to a party"
"aggrieved by an award of an arbitrator under section 58(3) of the Statute and that the Petitioner"
"had failed to avail himself of such remedy. Although the Petitioner had stated that he had preferred"
"appeals in paragraph 8(b) of the petition and submitted the documents marked පැ7(1)-පැ7(4) and"
"පැ7(8),  පැ7(11),  පැ7(14),  පැ7(17),  පැ7(20),  පැ7(23),  පැ7(26),  පැ7(29),  පැ7(32)  and  පැ7(35)-"
"පැ7(56පැ7(1)-පැ7 in relation thereto, it is observed that he has not stated how many such appeals"
"were made or what the outcome of such appeals were. In their limited objections, the 3rd and 4th"
"Respondents have stated that the Petitioner had preferred appeals only in respect of 15 out of a"
"total of 112 awards."
"T
he  only  excuse  provided  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  in  response  was  that  the"
"Petitioner had been unable to prefer appeals in respect of all awards due to the inability to furnish"
"a security deposit as required by section 58(3) of the Statute. In my view, such excuse cannot be"
"accepted as a justifiable reason in law not to exercise an equally efficacious statutory remedy. It is"
"observed that a comprehensive and self-contained regime for the resolution of disputes among co-"
"operative  societies  and  their  members  has  been  included  in  Chapter  X  (sections  58-60)  of  the"
"Western Province Co-operative Societies Statue No. 03 of 1998 (as amended), which appears to be"
"substantively based on the Co-operative Societies Law No. 05 of 1972 (as amended) and, it would"
"defeat the entire purpose of such statutory scheme if the  position taken up by the Petitioner is"
"condoned. Hence, I am inclined to uphold the objection raised by the Counsel for the Respondents."
