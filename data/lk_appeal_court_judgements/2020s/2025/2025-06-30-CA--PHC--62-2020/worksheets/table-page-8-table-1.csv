"When the matter was taken up on 2nd December 2010, counsel for the 2nd Accused raised"
"a preliminary objection, asserting that proceedings could not be sustained against the said"
"party on the basis that the 2nd Accused was a non-existent legal entity. As a result, the"
"prosecution sought to amend the charge sheet."
"On  06.11.2011,  the  prosecution  submitted  an  amended  plaint,  naming  the  directors  of"
"Nestlé  Lanka  PLC  as  the  3rd  to  8th  Accused,  in  addition  to  the  original  1st  and  2nd"
"Accused.  When  the  matter  was  taken  up  on  06.03.2014,  several  preliminary  objections"
"were raised on behalf of the Accused-Appellant."
"Consequently, the Court directed them to file written submissions. These objections were"
"overruled  by the  learned  Magistrate  on 20.11.2014.  Dissatisfied with  this decision,  the"
"Accused-Appellant filed a revision application before the High Court of Kandy. By order"
"dated 11.06.2020, the learned High Court Judge granted the prosecution leave to include"
"the names of the 3rd to 8th Accused in the charge sheet."
"Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant preferred this appeal"
"We  note  that,  as  per  the  amended  charge  sheet,  the  date  of  detection  is  recorded  as"
"22.10.2008. Although the original plaint was filed on 30.10.2008, the amended plaint—"
"filed on 06.01.2011—now includes the 3rd to 8th Accused-Appellants, who are directors of"
"Nestlé Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., as additional accused."
"When  the  matter  was  taken  up  before  this  Court  on  19.03.2025,  the  learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor General, representing the Complainant-Respondent, apprised the Court that, in"
"view of the Supreme Court’s judgment in SC Appeal No. 128/19 delivered on 27.10.2022,"
"the  legal  position  pertinent  to  the  present  appeal  now  stands  resolved  in  favour  of  the"
"Petitioner-Appellant."
"The issue before this Court is whether the recently added Accused-Respondents—namely,"
"the directors of Nestlé Lanka PLC—may be brought within the ambit of these proceedings"
"under  the  provisions  of  the  Food  Act,  in  light  of  the  aforementioned  judgment  of  the"
"Supreme Court."
"As per both the original and amended charge sheets, the alleged offence was detected on"
"22  October  2008.  The  original  plaint  was  filed  shortly  thereafter,  on  30  October  2008."
"However, the amended plaint, which includes the 3rd to 8th Accused—being directors of"
"Nestlé  Lanka  PLC—was  filed  on  6  January  2011,  over  two  years  after  the  date  of"
"detection."
