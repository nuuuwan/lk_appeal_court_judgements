JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Accused), along with 3rd

and the 4th Accused were indicted before the High Court of Colombo on 14 counts for the

offence of soliciting and accepting a bribe from one Nishshanka Arachchige Sumathipala

during the period of 01.05.2012 to 08.08.2012, punishable under Section 16 (b), 19(c) to be

read section 25 (2) of the Bribery Act.

The Prosecution led evidence through seven witnesses and marked the productions P1 –

P10 and closed its case. The Accused made dock statements separately in their defence.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court, by judgment dated

22nd March 2019, convicted the 1st Accused on counts 1, 2, 9, and 10, and the 2nd Accused

on counts 3, 4, 11, and 12. Accordingly, the 1st Accused was sentenced to six years of

rigorous imprisonment on each of counts 1 and 2, to run concurrently and further

sentenced to six years of rigorous imprisonment on each of counts 9 and 10, also to run

concurrently. As a result, the total sentence imposed for all four counts amounted to

twelve years of rigorous imprisonment. Additionally, a fine of Rs. 5,000 was imposed for

each count, along with an extra fine of Rs. 30,000 for the 9th count. For the 2nd Accused,

the 3rd and 4th counts were sentenced to 5 years of rigorous imprisonment, to run

concurrently, and the 11th and 12th counts were also sentenced to run concurrently and,

in total, 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for all four counts. Additionally, a fine of Rs.

5,000 was imposed for each count; furthermore, Rs. 100,000 as compensation to PW 01

from each Accused. The 3rd and 4th Accused were acquitted of all charges against them.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, both Accused have

preferred this appeal to this Court on the premise that the Learned High Court Judge has

influenced PW 1 by inducing him to give evidence.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

According to PW 1, Nishshanka Arachchilage Sumathipala, who lodged the complaint

against the Accused, gave evidence to the effect that he had been engaged in sand mining

since 2010. Initially, he operated under a valid permit issued for the location known as

Page 4 of 11

‘Periyaru Mankanda’. Upon expiry of that permit, the witness resumed mining activities

at the same location without a valid permit and continued such operations for

approximately six months.

In April 2012, while engaged in mining, 4 Wildlife officers from the Polonnaruwa

Department arrived at the place, and they inquired whether the witness possessed a valid

permit, to which he responded in the negative. According to the witness, after all 4 officers

solicited money to avoid instituting any legal actions against him.

Then the prosecution led the following questions.

Then, after the witness identified the 1st accused, Kumara, as the one who asked for the

money. Suddenly, the learned high court judge asked the following questions.

(අධිකරණයෙන්)

ප්‍ර : කව්ද සල්ලලි ඉල්ලුමව්?

When we analyse the evidence placed on that day, the witness stated that the 1st Accused

was the lead officer, who told the witness that sand mining required a valid permit.

Following a question posed by the Court, it emerged that the 4th Accused had solicited a

Page 7 of 11

monthly payment of Rs. 30,000 to refrain from initiating legal proceedings against the

witness, and the 1st Accused was also present at that time.

Thereafter, the court adjourned the case, and when the case was taken up later the

counsel for the prosecution made application to adjourn to take the trial on another

date. And the Learned High Court Judge made the following remarks.

Page 192 of the brief,

Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge released PW 1, the complainant, on a personal

bond and adjourned the trial to 01.02.2018 and 02.02.2018.

When this witness gave evidence on 1 February 2018, the witness stated that he could

not give evidence as he was under duress. He made a complaint on 30 January 2018,

informing the Bribery Commission by writing regarding this threat. He informed the

court that he was threatened by the 1st and the second accused. When he gave evidence,

he had changed his earlier position. This contradiction was not considered by the Learned

High Court Judge.

Upon reviewing the judgment, it is evident that the Learned High Court Judge did not

address a key contradiction in the evidence. Furthermore, the Judge failed to determine

whether any threats were made by the first and second accused. It is imperative to note

that the credibility of a witness must be assessed through the lens of probability,

consistency, and contradiction. In my considered opinion, the Learned High Court Judge

did not adequately evaluate the testimony of PW 01.

Page 8 of 11

During the course of arguments, counsel for the appellant observed that the Learned High

Court Judge, acting on their own accord, released PW 01 on a personal bond. Ordinarily,

when a witness retracts or deviates from their earlier testimony, the prosecution may

seek to have the witness declared adverse. In such circumstances, the court typically

proceeds to release the witness by imposing a personal bond.

We are also mindful that there is no evidence on record to establish that Prosecution

Witness 01 (PW 01) was under any threat. Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge

appears to have independently concluded that PW 01 was indeed under threat, without

any evidentiary basis for such a finding. When we analyse the evidence placed on that

day learned high court judge asked questions when PW 01 when back from his evidence.

It is pertinent to refer to Section 4 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political

Rights.

Section 4(1) provides as follows;

(1) A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be entitled-

(a) to be afforded an opportunity of being tried in his presence;

(b) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing and

where he does not have any such assistance, to be informed of that right;

(c) to have legal assistance assigned to him in appropriate cases where the interest

of justice so requires and without any payment by him, where he does not have

sufficient means to pay for such assistance.

(d) to examine or to have examined the witnesses against him and to obtain the

attendance of witnesses on his behalf, under the same conditions as witnesses

called against him;

(e) to have the assistance of an interpreter where such a person cannot understand

or speak the language in which the trial is being conducted; and

(f) not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.

Page 9 of 11

(emphasis added)

In this instance, it is observed that when the witness recanted his initial testimony, the

Learned High Court Judge compelled his attendance by ordering him to enter into a bond,

which did not conform to proper procedure. Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge

posed several questions that appeared intended to implicate the Accused.

I am mindful of the observation made by Justice A.R.P. Amasinghe in his book ‘Judicial

Conduct, Ethics and Responsibilities’, page 818,

A judge has the right and indeed the responsibility to prevent conduct which may

well be or become an abuse of the process of the court. However, a judge must act

with caution so as to leave unfettered the right of a party, through his or her

counsel, to subject any witness's testimony to the test of cross-examination. It is

not allowable, in advance, to place any length of time to be consumed by cross-

examination.

We have seen that judges must act within the norms of the adversary adjudicative

process. Ludovic Kenndy was quoted as saying: Whereas in Britain the judge acts

as a kind of referee in what is largely a test of debating skills between counsel, in

France it is the presiding judge who does all the questioning.' Although in some

civil law jurisdictions which have an inquisitorial system, it is the responsibility of

the judge to develop the litigative facts, in common law countries like Sri Lanka,

which as we have seen, have the adversarial system, judges are arbiters who must,

in general, leave it to counsel to place the evidence before the court. and to deal

with the case that is put before the court by counsel for the parties.

The role of a judge in an adversarial system was described by Bacon.

The parts of a judge in hearing are four:- to direct the evidence; to moderate

length, repetition, or impertinency of speech; to recapitulate, select, and

collate the material points of that which hath been said; and to give the rule

or sentence. Whatsoever is above these is too much, and proceedeth either

of glory and willingness to speak, or of impatience to hear, or of shortness

of memory, or want of staid and equal attention.

Lord Denning, in Jones v National Coal Board said:

(The Judge] must keep his vision unclouded... Let the advocates one after

the other put the weights into the scales - the nicely calculated less or more

- but the judge at the end decides which way the balance tilts, be it ever so

slightly. The judge's part in all this ... is to hearken to the evidence, only

Page 10 of 11

himself asking questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up any

point that has been overlooked or left obscure; to see that the advocates

behave themselves seemly and keep to the rules laid down by law to exclude

irrelevancies and discourage repetition; to make sure by wise intervention

that he follows the points that the advocates are making and can assess

their worth; and at the end to make up his mind where the truth lies. If he

goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a judge and assumes the robe of

an advocate; and the change does not become him well... Such are our

standards.

The basis of the judge's role was explained in Regina v Torbiak and Campbell.221

Kelly JA, delivering the judgment of the court, said:

The proper conduct of a trial is circumscribed by two considerations. On the one hand [the

judge's] position is one of great power and prestige which gives his every word an especial

significance. The position of established neutrality requires that the trial judge should

confine himself as much as possible to his own responsibilities and leave to counsel and

members of the jury their respective functions. On the other hand his responsibilities for

the conduct of the trial may well require him to ask questions which ought to be asked

and have not been asked on account of the failure of counsel, and so to compel him to

interject himself into the examination of witnesses to a degree which he might not

otherwise choose.

In the present matter, we find no justification for the learned trial judge's decision to

release the witness on bond, particularly in the absence of any stated reasons.

Impact on remanding a witness was considered by Justice Sisira de Abrew in Dinga

Balithiyannalage Dayananda Sisira Kumara v. The Republic of Sri Lanka, CA Appeal

No. 196/06, Decided on 29.09.2008, held that;

“Remanding a witness for giving false evidence during the pendency of

a trial can bring pressure on witnesses to be called by the prosecution or

the defence, to stick to their versions in the police statement or the

deposition in the Magistrate’s Court. In such a situation Superior Court

can conclude that the accused has been deprived of a fair trial.”

Page 11 of 11

We observed that after he was released on bail, he had changed his position and

implicated the different accused.

Furthermore, we observe that the nature of the questions posed by the court was

prejudicial to the accused. Such conduct, in our view, constitutes a breach of the

fundamental principles of a fair trial.

Accordingly, I hereby set aside the convictions and sentences imposed by the learned High

Court Judge on the first and second accused and order a fresh trial.

Appeal allowed.
