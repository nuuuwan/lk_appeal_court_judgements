"the inquiry has issued the Writ to eject the unauthorized occupants. These facts have"
"not been disclosed to this Court, thereby, the Petitioners have suppressed material facts"
"to Court. The Petitioners failed to respond to this argument."

n  Liyanage  and  Another  v  Ratnasiri  Divisional  Secretary,  Gampaha  and  others"
"(2013) 1 SLR 6 it was held that,"
"‘It is now a well-established principle that when an applicant has suppressed or"
"misrepresented  the  facts  material  to  an  application  and  when  there  is  no"
"complete and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the Court will not go in to"
"the merits of the relevant application, but will dismiss it in limine”"
"I
n my view, the Petitioners have failed to negate the allegation of not coming to Court"
"with clean hands."
"T
he Petitioners in paragraph 28 of the Petition have pleaded that a Farmers’ Association"
"of  the  Muththunagar  village  has  filed  two  Fundamental  Rights  Applications  in  the"
"Supreme Court.  However, they have failed to disclose the particulars of the said cases."
"The learned DSG appearing for the Respondents contended that some of the Petitioners"
"in  the  said  Fundamental  Rights  cases  are  also  Petitioners  in  the  present  case.  It  was"
"further argued that the main relief sought in this case is also the subject matter of the"
"Fundamental  Rights  cases.  Hence,  the  argument  that  since  the  Fundamental  Rights"
"Applications were filed before the Petitioners filed this Application, they were aware of"
"the grounds, and of the reliefs pleaded in the Fundamental Rights Applications. Yet, the"
"Petitioners failed to disclose this important fact to this Court. It is observed that even at"
"the submission stage, the Petitioners were silent on the existence of the Fundamental"
"Right Applications until it was raised by the  Respondents’ Counsel  and then too  the"
"said  contention  was  not  answered  by  the  Petitioners.  Hence,  the  argument  that  the"
"Petitioners are attempting to have two bites at the same cherry in two different forums"
"without disclosing the same."
"F
urther, the learned DSG’s submitted that the Fundamental Rights Application and the"
"subject matter of this Writ Application is both on the vesting of the land with the SLPA"
"and subsequent process to evict the Petitioners, which was not denied by the Petitioners."
"Hence, in my view, the Petitioners ought to and there was a duty cast on them to disclose"
"the particulars pertaining to the Fundamental Right Application in detail. The failure to"
"do so by the Petitioner in this instance amounts to a grave suppression of material facts."
