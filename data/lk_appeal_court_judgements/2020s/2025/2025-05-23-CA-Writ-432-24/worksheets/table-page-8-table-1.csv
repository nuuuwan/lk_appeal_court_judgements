"In  this  instance,  the  Gazette  vesting  the  land  to  the  SLPA  had  been  issued  in  1984."
"Hence, as submitted, at that time it had been considered by the Minister that the said"
"land was required for the purposes of the port. The Petitioners have failed to impugn"
"this position. In any event, it was not the contention of the Petitioners that the Vesting"
"Order was wrong, as the land was not needed for any purpose the Act has enumerated."
