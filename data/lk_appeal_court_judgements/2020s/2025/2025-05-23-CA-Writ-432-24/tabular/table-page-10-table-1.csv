"T
he delay"
"I
n this Application, the Petitioners are attempting to quash the Vesting Order marked"
"as P6. The said Order has been published on 12.09.1984. As per the Vesting Order, the"
"land has been vested with the 1st Respondent with effect from 15.03.1984. After a long"
"slumber of nearly four decades, the Petitioners have awakened and are attempting to"
"challenge the Vesting Order which is nearly forty years old. The Petitionersâ€™ attempt to"
"explain the delay on ignorance cannot be accepted as ignorance of the law does not help"
"a litigant. The Petitioners themselves have tendered to Court the Gazette through which"
"the  vesting  of  the  land  with  the  SLPA  was  published.  Hence,  the  Respondents  have"
"published the vesting order in the Government Gazette, thus, the vesting of the land is"
"not done secretly."
