"Subsequent  to  the  settlement  dated  13th  January  2011,  the  2nd  Respondent,  Assistant"
"Commissioner of Co-operative Development-Galle, acting under the power delegated by"
"the 1st Respondent under gazette No. 1589/19, has issued a letter dated 15th December"
"2011  (annexed  marked  Pe7)  authorizing  the  3rd,  4th  and  5th  Respondents  to  inspect  the"
"books of the Co-operative Society."
"In response to the objections of the Chairman of the  Co-operative Society to letter Pe7,"
"the  2nd  Respondent  has  sent  letter  dated  22nd  February  2012  (annexed  marked  Pe9)"
"retreating  that  she  has  received  the  power  to  authorize  3rd,  4th  and  5th  Respondents"

"Commissioner of Co-operative Development."
"However,  it  appears  that  after  arrival  at  the  office  of  the  Appellant  Society,  due  to  the"
"protests  by  the  Chairman,  the  3rd,  4th  and  5th  Respondents  had  departed  without"
"conducting the authorized inspection."
"Thereafter, the Appellant Society has received a copy of a letter dated 1st November 2017"
"(annexed marked Pe12), which has been addressed to 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents by the"
"1st Respondent, authorizing them to conduct an inspection of the books of the Appellant"
"Society and report their observations with regard to the specific areas mentioned in the"
"said letter."
"It appears that thereafter 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents had begun their inspection under"
"the  authorization  given  by 
letter  Pe12  and  the  specified  period  for  the 
inspection"
"mentioned 
in  the 
letter  Pe12  has  also  been  extended  at  the  request  of  the  3rd–5th"

"of  the  Co-operative  Society  has  specified  the  documents  needed  by  them  and  also"
"directed the office bearers of the Co-operative Society to hand over the said documents"
"before the 30th November 2017 (annexed marked Pe14)."
"On 22nd January 2017 (should be 22nd January 2018), the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents had"
"made  another  entry  in  the  Co-operative  Society’s  log  book  (annexed  marked  Pe18)  and"
"had  requested  additional  documents  whilst  stating  inter  alia  that  the  previous  request"
"had not been complied with properly."
