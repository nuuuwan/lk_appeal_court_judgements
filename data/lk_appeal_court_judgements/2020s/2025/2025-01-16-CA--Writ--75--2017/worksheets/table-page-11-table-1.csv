"Authority.  The  provisions  indicate  the  legislature's  intention  to  continue"
"registration and issuing permits and licenses under the new legislation too."
"The  second  proviso  specifies  that  the  relevant  hotels  liable  to  be  levied"
"should be registered with or approved or recognised by the Ceylon Tourist"
"Board  for  the  purposes  of  the  Tourist  Development  Act  No.14  of  1968."
"Therefore,  as  per  Section  16  of 
the 
Interpretation  Ordinance, 
the"
"expression  “Ceylon  Tourist  Board” 
in 
the  second  proviso  should  be"
"interpreted 
and 
understood 
as 
“Sri 
Lanka 
Tourism  Development"
"Authority”. Accordingly, the non-existence of the “Ceylon Tourist Board”"
"would not make proviso nugatory."
"Tourist Hotel Code"
"The  Petitioner  further  states  that  when  it  was  in  existence,  the  Ceylon"
"Tourist Board promulgated a “Tourist Hotel Code” in terms of Section 77"
"of the Tourist Development Act for registration of hotels to carry out the"
"business of a tourist hotel. The said Section 77 of the Tourist Development"
"Act  has  been 
repealed  by  Section  68 
(2)  of 
the  Tourism  Act  and"
"consequently without such registration no premises could be used for the"
"purpose of carrying on business of a tourist hotel. However, Section 48(3)"
"of the Tourism Act provides necessary provisions to register every Tourist"
"Enterprise and Tourist Service with the Authority and a license issued in"
"the  name  of  such  Enterprise  or  Service  by  the  Authority.  The Petitioner"
"conceded that its all members are registered by the Tourism Development"
"Authority established in terms of the Tourism Act. Therefore, the repeal of"
"Section 77 of the Tourist Development Act does not have any effect on the"
"provisions in the second proviso."
"The Petitioner claims that there is no reason and that it is unreasonable to"
"categorise hotels separately from the other institutions set out in Schedule"
"1(B) of Gazette Notification P3. However, it is important to observe that as"
"per Schedule 1 (c)(i) of Gazette Notification P3, not only the hotels but also"
"in respect of Hotels, Restaurants or Lodging Houses were levied."
"Conclusion"
"In the circumstances and owing to the reasons given above, I am of the"
"view  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  satisfy  the  Court  that  there  is  any"
"illegality in the decision contained in the Gazette Notification P3 as prayed."
