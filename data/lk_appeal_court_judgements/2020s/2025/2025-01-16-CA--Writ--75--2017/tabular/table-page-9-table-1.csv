"the imposition of a duty in respect of licensed premises in general without"
"taking into account the fact as to whether such licensed premises shall be"
"used  for  trade  purposes  or  not. 
In  other  words,  at  the  time  of  the"
"introduction of original Section 247A, the intention of legislation had been"
"that  the  duty  imposed  under  Section  247A  should  be  solely  based  on  a"
"single consideration i.e., the annual value of the premises. However, with"
"the introduction of the amendment in 1985, the legislature had intended"
"to deviate from such position and to take into account matters such as the"
"turnover of business of such trade, the profit that is likely to be earned in"
"such trade and the essential nature of the goods or services supplied in the"
"course of such trade in addition to the annual value, where such licence"
"authorizes the use of such premises for the purposes of any trade."
"In the said background, this Court is of the view that the above first proviso"
"should be interpreted giving effect to the purposive rule. The section must"
"be  construed  as  a  whole  and  the  proviso  may  throw 
light  upon  the"
"construction of the operative part. The term ""maximum duty"" mentioned"
"in the first proviso shall only apply in instances where the duty is entirely"
"determined based on the annual value. Hence, I view that the first proviso"
"shall only apply in the instances where the “annual value of the premises”"
"is the sole consideration for the imposition of levy and where such licensed"
"premises are not used for trade purposes. In the said backdrop, I am unable"
"to agree with the position advanced by the Petitioner that as per the first"
"proviso to Section 247A(2), the maximum duty imposed on the Petitioner"
"should not exceed beyond Rs.5000."
"The  non-existence  of  the  Ceylon  Tourist  Board  referred  to  in  the  second"
"proviso"
"The second proviso stipulates, that where any premises are used for the"
"purposes of a hotel, restaurant or lodging house, and such hotel, restaurant"
"or lodging house is registered with or approved or recognised by the Ceylon"
"Tourist  Board  for  the  purposes  of  the  Tourist  Development  Act  No.14  of"
"1968,  the  duty  so  levied  shall  be  according  to  the  takings  of  the  hotel,"
"restaurant or lodging house for the year preceding the year in which the"
"licence duty is levied, and shall not exceed one per centum of such takings."
"It is apparent that the second proviso specifically provides the manner in"
"which the duties should be levied in case of hotels, restaurants and lodging"
"houses.  However, the Petitioner argues that in view of the repealing of"
"certain provisions under the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No.10 of 1966 by"
"Section 67(1) of the Tourism Act, No.38 of 2005, the Ceylon Tourist Board"
