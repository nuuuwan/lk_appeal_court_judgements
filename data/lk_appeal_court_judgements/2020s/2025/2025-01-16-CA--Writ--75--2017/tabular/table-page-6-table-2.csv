"person, firm, company or corporation for any purpose, a"
"licence or concession, whether exclusive or otherwise, for"
"any period or for any consideration, subject to such terms"
"and conditions as to the Council may seem fit;"
"Accordingly, I do not agree with the contention of the Petitioner that the"
"Municipal  Council  Ordinance  does  not  empower  the  Council  to 
issue"
"licence to hotels."
"A  duty 
levied  under  subsection  247A  (1)  of  the  Ordinance  shall  be"
"determined according to Section 247A(2) of the Ordinance. The table of"
"licence duty stipulated in Schedule No.1(a) of the Gazette Notification P3"
"has been allegedly imposed under Section 247A of the Ordinance but not"
"under  any by-laws.  It  is  noted  that  the  Gazette  Notification  P3  provides"
"that “This license duties and Taxes levied by the Colombo Municipal Council for the year"
"2017  under  the  provisions  of  Sections  247A,247B,247C  and  247E  of  the  Municipal"
"Councils Ordinance (Chapter 252) as amended by the Municipal Councils (Amendment)"
"Act, Nos. 42 of 1979 and 20 of 1985.”"
"However, the powers conferred to make by-laws under Section 272 of the"
"Ordinance are without prejudice to the general powers conferred to the"
"Council.  Therefore, as per the powers conferred to the Council to grant"
"licences under Section 40 of the Ordinance and to impose a duty levy in"
"respect of licences by Section 247A (1) of the Ordinance, there is no barrier"
"for  the  Municipal  Council  to  publish  a  list  of  purposes  for  which  the"
"premises including hotels may be used subject to obtaining a licence as"
"specified under Section (b) of Schedule No. 01 of the Gazette Notification"
"P3."
"Powers of the Municipal Council to issue licences under the by-laws"
"However, the Petitioner further contended that the by-laws made by the"
"Council do not empower the Council to issue licence or to register hotels."
"Section 267 of the Ordinance specifies the power to make by-laws for the"
"purpose  of  carrying  out  the  principles  and  provisions  of  the  Ordinance."
"Section 267 of the Ordinance is as follows."
