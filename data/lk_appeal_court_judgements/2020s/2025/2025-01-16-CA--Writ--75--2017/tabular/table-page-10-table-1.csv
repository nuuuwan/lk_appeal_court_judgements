"is  no  longer  in  existence.  Hence,  the  Petitioner  states  that  none  of  its"
"members running hotels are not registered with the Ceylon Tourist Board"
"for the purpose of the Tourist Development Act No.14 of 1968 as there is"
"no Ceylon Tourist Board in existence at the moment. Accordingly, it was"
"submitted  that  second  proviso  to  Section  247A  has  no  application 
in"
"respect of the Petitioner."
"However, the Respondents argued that the said position advanced by the"
"Petitioner would be  baseless in view of Section  16 of the Interpretation"
"Ordinance and the legal principles of statute interpretation. Section 16 of"
"the  Interpretation  Ordinance  provides  that,  where  any  written  law  or"
"document  reference 
is  made  to  any  written 
law  that 
is  subsequently"
"repealed, such reference shall be deemed to be made to the written law"
"by which the repeal is effected or to the corresponding portion thereof."
"This principle has been given effect to by the Supreme Court in the case of"
"Sepala  Francis  Perera  vs.  W.  Norman  Appuhamy  (CA(PHC)  168/2013"
"decided on 30.11.2018)."
"The  Tourist  Development  Act,  No.  14  of  1968  has  been  amended  by"
"Section 68 of the Tourism Act substituting â€œTourism Act, No. 38 of 2005"""
"and  ""Sri  Lanka  Tourism  Development  Authority"" 
for  the  expressions"
"""principal Act"" and ""Board"", respectively. Said Section 68 is as follows."
