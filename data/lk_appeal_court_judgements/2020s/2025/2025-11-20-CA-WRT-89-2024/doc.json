  "keywords": "The original grantee had died and, before his death, had placed the 4 th Respondent in possession under a tenancy agreement, without permission of the Divisional Secretary, violating the conditions of the original grant. The Petitioner, who is the heir of the original grantee, seeks a writ against the Divisional Secretary for his decision to hold an inquiry to decide whether the Petitioner is entitled to the grant or whether the 4th and 5th Respondents, who are in possession, are entitled. Application was refused since it is the Divisional Secretary who should take a decision and, without going into evidence, this Court cannot decide.",
