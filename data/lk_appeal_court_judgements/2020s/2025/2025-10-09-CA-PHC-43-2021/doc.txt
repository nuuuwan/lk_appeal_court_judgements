The Officer-in-Charge of Gampaha Police Station filed an information in theMagistrate’s Court of Gampaha on 13th May 2019 under the Provisions of Section 66of the Primary Court’s Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter sometimes referredto as “the Act”) to the effect that there was a dispute regarding the possession of aresidential property situated in Gampaha (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the“subject premises”) between 1st Party-Petitioners-Appellants (hereinafter sometimesreferred to as “Appellants”) and 2nd Party-Respondents-Respondents (hereinaftersometimes referred to as “Respondents”).

On 05th March 2019, 1st Party 3rd Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referredto as “3rd Appellant”) had made a complaint to the police, stating that he wasentrusted with the care of the adjoining property by the owner of that property whowas residing in Colombo, and on the 22nd of the previous month (22 February 2019)the 2nd Party 1st and 2nd Respondents-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred toas “1st and 2nd Respondents”) forcibly occupied the house situated in the said property.

On 06th April 2019, statements of the 1st and 2nd Respondents had been recordedregarding what appears to be an unconnected incident, and in that statement, the 1st

Respondent has stated that he and his brother came to reside in the house bearingassessment No.110, at Miniruwangama, Kotugoda about two months previously(which would be within the month of February 2019). Further that, this propertypreviously belonged to their mother.

The identification of the property as No. 110, Miniruwangama, Kotugoda, and the factthat the Respondents were in possession of the property at the time of filing of theinformation had not been disputed by the parties.

Upon the conclusion of inquiry, the learned Magistrate of Gampaha, sitting as thePrimary Court, having considered the affidavits, counter-affidavits and submissions ofthe parties, by order dated 31st July 2019, granted possession to the Respondents anddismissed the Appellants’ application for restoration of possession, on the groundsthat the Appellants had not been able to establish that they had been dispossessedduring the two months immediately preceding the filing of information.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the learned Magistrate of Gampaha, theAppellants sought revision in the High Court of Gampaha, challenging the PrimaryCourt’s order as being legally flawed and overly technical. On 26th October 2021, theHigh Court dismissed the revision application, confirming the Primary Court’s order.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellants havefiled this instant appeal in this court inter alia, seeking the following reliefs;

I.Set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha in Rev.83/2019, dated 2021/10/26.II.Set aside the order of the learned Magistrate of Gampaha in 79186/19, dated2019/07/31.III.Order to restore the possession of the subject matter to the Appellants.

The instant appeal seeks to set aside the impugned orders of the subordinate courtson the following grounds;

a) That the learned High Court Judge has failed to properly interpret and apply

section 66 (1) (a)(i) of the Primary Court Procedure.b) That both the learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge gave a

narrow interpretation to the term "With least possible delay" in section 66 (1)(a)(i) of the Primary Court Procedure thereby defeated the intention of thelegislature.c) That the evidence as admissions by the 2ndparty that they disposed the 1st

party was disregarded by the Court.d) That the police statement given by the 2ndparty saying that the disposed the

first party on the 22nd March was regarded as typographical error by the Court.

Subsections (1) and (3) of Section 68 of the Primary Court’s Procedure Act No. 44 of1979 reads thus;

68

(1)Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land orpart thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the

5

Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to whowas in possession of the land or the part on the date ofthe filing of the information under section 66 and makeorder as to who is entitled to possession of such land orpart thereof.(2)(3)Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to thepossession of any land or any part of a land the Judge of thePrimary Court is satisfied that any person who had been inpossession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessedwithin a period of two months immediately before the dateon which the information was filed under section 66, he maymake a determination to that effect and make an orderdirecting that the party dispossessed be restored topossession and prohibiting all disturbance of such possessionotherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of acompetent court.

In proceedings under the Primary Court’s Procedure Act, the learned Magistrate’s dutyunder Section 68 is, in the first instance, to ascertain and determine who was in actualpossession of the land on the date on which the information was filed, ascontemplated by Section 68(1).1 The inquiry is not into ownership or title, but into thefactual state of possession, broadly understood as control or occupation regardless ofproprietary rights.

However, the Act also provides for situations where possession has been disturbedunlawfully. Under Section 68(3), when forcible dispossession is alleged, the Court maylook beyond possession on the filing date to determine whether such dispossessionoccurred within two months prior.2 This safeguard ensures that a party wrongfullyousted shortly before proceedings is not denied the statute’s protection.

In the instant case, Appellants accept the fact that the Respondents were inpossession of the property as at the time the information was filed, and their claimrests upon being forcibly dispossessed from the property. Such a position inevitablyshifts the inquiry from Section 68(1) to Section 68(3). The learned Magistrate,appreciating this distinction, proceeded to examine whether the statutory requisitesof Section 68(3) had been met, namely, whether the alleged dispossession had taken

place within the two-month period contemplated by the Act. In doing so, the learnedMagistrate has heavily relied upon what appears to be a complaint of forcibledispossession made by the 3rd Appellant.

However, it appears that the 1st Party 2nd Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimesreferred to as “2nd Appellant”) has on 22-02-2019 made a complaint to GampahaPolice Station stating that the 1st and 2nd Respondents are attempting to forciblyoccupy the house in adjoining land which they are looking after on behalf of the 1st

Appellant, and as such to legally evict them. The 1st Appellant, making a statement on23-02-2019, has stated that he, being the owner of the subject premises, wasinformed on the previous day that some people had broken into and entered thepremises. When he visited the premises in the morning, he observed three personsleaving the house, and he found that some items belonging to him that were insidethe house had been stolen.

The 3rd Appellant, making a complaint to the Gampaha Police Station on 05-03-2019,has stated that the 1st and the 2nd Respondent had since the 22nd of the previousmonth (which would mean 22-02-2019) forcibly occupying the subject premises, andas such, to assist him in retrieving some property of his that is inside the subjectpremises.

When examining the above-mentioned statements of the Appellant party, it issignificant that it is the 3rd Appellant’s statement dated 05-03-2019, which clearlystates that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents are forcibly residing in the subjectpremises since 22-02-2019. This position is further supported by the statements of the1st and the 2nd Respondents to the police dated 06th April 2019.

The above evidence counters the 1st Appellant’s claim that the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents have accepted the fact that they came into occupation of the saidproperty on 22nd March 2019. This assertion is based on the statements made to thepolice by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents on the 19th April 2019. However, in theiraffidavits submitted to the Magistrate’s Court, the 1st and the 2nd Respondents haveclearly stated that by 22nd February 2019, they were in possession of the property.

The party alleging unlawful dispossession bears the initial burden of proof to establish,on a balance of probability, that they were in possession within the two-month periodcontemplated by the Act, and that their possession was disturbed within that time. Inlight of the greater weight of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable for the learnedMagistrate to consider the date 22nd March 2019, which appears as the date ofdispossession in the statements of the 1st and 2nd Respondents dated 19th April 2019,as an inadvertent error that can be disregarded.

On the above grounds, I am unable to agree with the contention of the Appellants thatthe Respondents have admitted to the dispossession within the requisite time period.The learned Magistrate, on the material available, has come to the correct conclusionthat the Appellants had not been able to establish that they had been dispossessedduring the two months immediately preceding the filing of information, and as suchcannot be restored to possession.

I am unable to agree with the Appellants’ contention that Section 68(3) of the Actshould be more broadly interpreted. Proceedings under Part VII of the Primary Court’sProcedure Act are of a temporary and preventive character, solely to determinefactual possession in order to prevent a potential breach of the peace which mayresult in danger to life and property. The intrinsic urgency demands that these mattersbe concluded as expeditiously as possible. It is imperative that the learned Magistrateact strictly within the parameters of the relevant sections, as any deviation couldresult in the defeat of the limited purpose for which this legislation has been drafted.As such, it is imperative that the learned Magistrate strictly adhere to Section 68 (1)and 68 (3).

In paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Appellants’ written submissions, the Appellants haveaverred that the learned Magistrate has failed to properly apply Section 66 (1) (a)(i) bytreating the delay which was due to the police inaction as fatal to their case. However,if the Appellants assert that the dispossession occurred on 22nd March 2019, theycannot simultaneously contend that there was undue delay on the part of the police.If the dispossession was on 22nd March 2019, it would fall well within the two-monthstatutory period. Therefore, it is not open to the Appellants to both affirm and denywith regard to the date of dispossession.

According to the available evidence, the 1st information received by the policeregarding a forcible occupation of the premises was when the 3rd Appellant made acomplaint on 05th March 2019. The previous complaint dated 23-02-2019 made by the1st Appellant, the owner of the premises, does not state that the subject premises isbeing occupied by the Respondents or any other party. He had only wanted therecovery of stolen items. Even the 05th March 2019 statement of the 3rd Appellantdoes not contain a request for restoration. It is only in the statement dated 12th May2019 made by the 1st Appellant that he has informed the police that he has beendispossessed from his premises, and as such, has requested restoration. Consideringthat the police proceeded to file the information on 13th May 2019, the police cannotbe said to have been remiss in attending to the matter.

8

In my view, the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge are justified intheir conclusions, and thus, I do not see merit in any of the grounds urged by thelearned Counsel for the Appellants, which would necessitate interference with theorders of the learned Magistrate of Gampaha dated 31st July 2019 and the learnedHigh Court Judge of Gampaha dated 26th October 2021. Appeal is dismissed subject tocosts.
