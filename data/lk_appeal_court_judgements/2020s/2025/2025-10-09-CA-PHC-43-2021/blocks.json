    "text": "I am unable to agree with the Appellants\u2019 contention that Section 68(3) of the Actshould be more broadly interpreted. Proceedings under Part VII of the Primary Court\u2019sProcedure Act are of a temporary and preventive character, solely to determinefactual possession in order to prevent a potential breach of the peace which mayresult in danger to life and property. The intrinsic urgency demands that these mattersbe concluded as expeditiously as possible. It is imperative that the learned Magistrateact strictly within the parameters of the relevant sections, as any deviation couldresult in the defeat of the limited purpose for which this legislation has been drafted.As such, it is imperative that the learned Magistrate strictly adhere to Section 68 (1)and 68 (3).",

However,if the Appellants assert that the dispossession occurred on 22nd March 2019, theycannot simultaneously contend that there was undue delay on the part of the police.If the dispossession was on 22nd March 2019, it would fall well within the two-monthstatutory period. Therefore, it is not open to the Appellants to both affirm and denywith regard to the date of dispossession.",

The previous complaint dated 23-02-2019 made by the1st Appellant, the owner of the premises, does not state that the subject premises isbeing occupied by the Respondents or any other party. He had only wanted therecovery of stolen items. Even the 05th March 2019 statement of the 3rd Appellantdoes not contain a request for restoration. It is only in the statement dated 12th May2019 made by the 1st Appellant that he has informed the police that he has beendispossessed from his premises, and as such, has requested restoration. Consideringthat the police proceeded to file the information on 13th May 2019, the police cannotbe said to have been remiss in attending to the matter.",
