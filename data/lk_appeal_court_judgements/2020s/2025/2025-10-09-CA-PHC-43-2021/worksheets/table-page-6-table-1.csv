"place within the two-month period contemplated by the Act. In doing so, the learned"
"Magistrate  has  heavily  relied  upon  what  appears  to  be  a  complaint  of 
forcible"
"dispossession made by the 3rd Appellant."
"However, it appears that the 1st Party 2nd Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes"
"referred  to  as  “2nd  Appellant”)  has  on  22-02-2019  made  a  complaint  to  Gampaha"
"Police  Station  stating  that  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  are  attempting  to  forcibly"
"occupy  the  house  in  adjoining  land  which they are  looking  after on  behalf  of the  1st"
"Appellant, and as such to legally evict them. The 1st Appellant, making a statement on"
"23-02-2019,  has  stated  that  he,  being  the  owner  of  the  subject  premises,  was"
"informed  on  the  previous  day  that  some  people  had  broken  into  and  entered  the"
"premises.  When  he  visited  the  premises  in  the  morning,  he  observed  three  persons"
"leaving  the  house,  and  he  found  that  some items  belonging  to  him  that  were  inside"
"the house had been stolen."
"The 3rd Appellant, making a complaint to the Gampaha Police Station on 05-03-2019,"
"has  stated  that  the  1st  and  the  2nd  Respondent  had  since  the  22nd  of  the  previous"
"month (which would mean 22-02-2019) forcibly occupying the subject premises, and"
"as  such,  to  assist  him  in  retrieving  some  property  of  his  that  is  inside  the  subject"
"premises."
"When  examining 
the  above-mentioned  statements  of 
the  Appellant  party, 
it 
is"
"significant  that  it  is  the  3rd  Appellant’s  statement  dated  05-03-2019,  which  clearly"
"states  that  the  1st  and  the  2nd  Respondents  are  forcibly  residing 
in  the  subject"
"premises since 22-02-2019. This position is further supported by the statements of the"
"1st and the 2nd Respondents to the police dated 06th April 2019."
"The  above  evidence  counters  the  1st  Appellant’s  claim  that  the  1st  and  the  2nd"
"Respondents  have  accepted  the  fact  that  they  came 
into  occupation  of  the  said"
"property on 22nd March 2019. This assertion is based on the statements made to the"
"police  by  the  1st  and  the  2nd  Respondents  on  the  19th  April  2019.  However,  in  their"
"affidavits  submitted  to  the  Magistrate’s  Court,  the  1st  and  the  2nd  Respondents  have"
"clearly stated that by 22nd February 2019, they were in possession of the property."
"The party alleging unlawful dispossession bears the initial burden of proof to establish,"
"on a balance of probability, that they were in possession within the two-month period"
"contemplated by the Act, and that their possession was disturbed within that time. In"
"light of the greater weight of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable for the learned"
"Magistrate  to  consider  the  date  22nd  March  2019,  which  appears  as  the  date  of"
"dispossession in the statements of the 1st and 2nd Respondents dated 19th April 2019,"
"as an inadvertent error that can be disregarded."
