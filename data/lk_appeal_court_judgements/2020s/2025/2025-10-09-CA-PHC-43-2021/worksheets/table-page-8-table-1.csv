"In my view, the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge are justified in"
"their  conclusions,  and  thus,  I  do  not  see  merit  in  any  of  the  grounds  urged  by  the"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellants,  which  would  necessitate  interference  with  the"
"orders  of  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Gampaha  dated  31st  July  2019  and  the  learned"
"High Court Judge of Gampaha dated 26th October 2021. Appeal is dismissed subject to"
