"â€œ(3) Reason for rule in Section 157"
"T
he section proceeds upon the principle that consistency is a ground for belief in the"
"veracity of a witness, just as inconsistency is a ground for disbelieving him. But the"
"corroborative  value  of  such  previous  statements  varies  and  depends  on  the"
"c
i
rcumstances of each case. A person can adhere to falsehood, once uttered, when he"
"has a motive for it."
"(4) T
he two circumstances set out in Section 157"
"Section 157 requires that the former statement must have been made"
"(
A
)
 
At or about the time when the fact took place, or"
"(
B
)
 
Before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact."
"(A) A
t
 
or about the time when the fact took place"
"Generally, statements made immediately or soon after the occurrence of an event, so"
"that it could not have been made for the purpose of creating evidence, contain truth,"
"f
or sufficient time may not have elapsed for concoctions and fabrications to creep in."
"Therefore, such statements are a legitimate means of corroboration on the basis of"
"consistency.  They  support  the  credibility  of  the  person  whose  evidence  is"
"corroborated. The object of this part of the section is to admit statements made at a"
"t
i
me when the mind of the witness is still so connected with the events as to make it"
"probable that his description of them then would be accurate. But lapse of time"
"sufficient for reflection would make the statement of very little value and even"
"dangerous, as being capable of fabrication."
