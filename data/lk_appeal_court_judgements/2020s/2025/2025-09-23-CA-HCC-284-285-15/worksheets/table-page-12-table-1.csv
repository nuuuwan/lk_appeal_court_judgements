"further weakens the credibility of his account, as it suggests a lack of independent"
"corroboration  at  the  time  of  the  alleged  identification.  The  delay  in  naming  the"
"Accused, despite the witness’s familiarity with them and the gravity of the incident,"
"raises  serious  concerns  about  the  authenticity  of  his  narrative.  In  light  of  these"
"inconsistencies,  the  Court  finds  that  PW  01’s  evidence  must  be  approached  with"
"caution and cannot be accepted as wholly reliable."
"We hold that the Learned High Court Judge erred in failing to adequately consider a"
"material aspect of the evidence, namely, that the sole eyewitness, PW 01, the brother"
"of the deceased, did not disclose the names of the Accused to the police at the earliest"
"opportunity and misdirected himself."
"For the aforementioned reasons, we set aside the conviction and sentence against the"
"accused imposed on 01.12.2015."
"Appeal allowed."
