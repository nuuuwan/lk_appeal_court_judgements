"Rule 3(1) of the Pension Fund states as follows:"
"“Commencing from the month of January 1994, the Board shall remit monthly to the Pension"
"Fund a sum of money equivalent to 7% of the total of salaries of all the employees computed"
"on the aggregate salary on which contributions are made to the Provident Fund.”"
"C
onsidering  the  legal  effect  and  the  force  of  law  of  the  rules  of  the  Pension  Fund,  His"
"Lordship E.A.G.R. Amarasekara in the above judgment stated as follows."
"“
In terms of Section 56 of the Ceylon Electricity Board Act, every regulation made by the"
"Minister shall be published in the Gazette and shall come into operation on the date of the"
"publication  or  upon  such  later  date  as  may  be  specified.  Every  such  regulation  has  to  be"
"placed before the Parliament for approval. Every such regulation deemed to be rescinded as"
"from the date of disapproval by the Parliament but without prejudiced to anything previously"
"done thereunder. Any person who contravenes the provisions of any regulation made under"
"the Act shall be guilty of an offence punishable by a Magistrate.”"
"A
nother aspect that needs to be emphasized is the impact on public finance and sustainability"
"of the Pension Fund. If employees who have not satisfied the qualifying criteria are granted"
"pension rights, it would impose an unauthorized financial liability on the Pension Fund and,"
"indirectly,  on  the  public  money.  Permitting  such  unlawful  grants  would  erode  the  financial"
"stability of the Pension Fund and amount to the malpractices of the Board."
"H
ence, my considered view is that the decision of the Arbitrator to grant pension rights to the"
"5th  to  7th  Respondents  without  completing  the  required  240  months  of  service  cannot  be"
"sustained, as it is contrary to the law and ultra vires."
"T
he Respondents, in their joint affidavit, have asserted that the application of the Petitioner"
"should be rejected on the grounds of undue delay and misrepresentation of facts. It is true that"
"the  remedies  under  judicial  review  cannot  be  invoked  by  those  who  are  guilty  of  laches,"
"misrepresentation  and  suppression  of  material  facts.  Likewise,  the  fact  that  the  question  of"
"inordinate delay does not arise, where there is a blatant violation of the law or unless there are"
"extraordinary reasons to justify such a delay.  However, as I mentioned earlier, the award of"
"the  Arbitrator  is  manifestly  erroneous  in  light  of  the  rules  of  the  Pension  Fund.  In  such"
