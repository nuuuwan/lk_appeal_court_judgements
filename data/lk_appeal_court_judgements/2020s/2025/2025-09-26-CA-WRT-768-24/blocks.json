The Petitioners state that the 9th Respondent held ownership of the land in issue by virtue of Deeds Nos. 5504, 5505, and 5506, dated 1st February 2017, and the same had been mortgaged to the Hatton National Bank in order to obtain a loan facility. Consequent to the default of the loan, the Hatton National Bank had acquired the land in issue at a public auction. Thereafter, the Petitioners had purchased the land in issue from Hatton National Bank upon a Deed bearing No. 142 dated 10th July 2024 executed in favour of the Petitioners. The Petitioners state that after the land in issue was acquired, the Petitioners cultivated the land. However, the 7th and the 8th Respondents had attempted to enter the land claiming that they own a particular portion of the land. Thereafter, the 9th Respondent had made a complaint to the Agrarian Development Officer - Dambulla, stating that the Petitioners obstructed the agricultural roadway which leads to the Mahakapuyaya tank and the said portion of land. Accordingly, the 2nd Respondent had conducted an inquiry under Section 90 of the Agrarian Development Act (herein after sometimes refers to as \u201cthe Act\u201d) and had arrived at the conclusion that the Petitioners have interfered with the cultivation rights of the 9th Respondent and accordingly had directed the Petitioners to remove the obstructions to the agricultural roadway which gives access to the land that has been identified as a paddy land and to allow the 9th Respondent to cultivate the land (document marked P10).",

I am of the view that the Order P10 read with Section 90(1) of the Act speaks for itself that the interference or attempted interference by the Petitioners will result in damage or loss of crop or livestock in the impugned land. Accordingly, I view that the impugned Order P10 is in substantive compliance with Section 90 of the Act, and the P10 itself is a speaking order. Further, it is noted that the facts and materials placed before the 2nd Respondent do not suggest otherwise that the Commissioner-General could have arrived at a contrary decision to that of P10.
