"and further, the Court permitted both parties to file written submissions."
"This order pertains to the issuance of notice and relevant interim relief."
"The Petitioners state that the 9th Respondent held ownership of the land"
"in issue by virtue of Deeds Nos. 5504, 5505, and 5506, dated 1st February"
"2017, and the same had been mortgaged to the Hatton National Bank in"
"order to obtain a loan facility. Consequent to the default of the loan, the"
"Hatton National Bank had acquired the land in issue at a public auction."
"Thereafter,  the  Petitioners  had  purchased  the  land  in  issue  from  Hatton"
"National  Bank  upon  a  Deed  bearing  No.  142  dated  10th 
July  2024"
"executed in favour of the Petitioners. The Petitioners state that after the"
"land in issue was acquired, the Petitioners cultivated the land. However,"
"the 7th and the 8th Respondents had attempted to enter the land claiming"
"that 
they  own  a  particular  portion  of 
the 
land.  Thereafter, 
the  9th"
"Respondent had made a complaint to the Agrarian Development Officer -"
"Dambulla, stating that the Petitioners obstructed the agricultural roadway"
"which 
leads  to  the  Mahakapuyaya  tank  and  the  said  portion  of 
land."
"Accordingly, the 2nd Respondent had conducted an inquiry under Section"
"90 of the Agrarian Development Act (herein after sometimes refers to as"
"“the  Act”)  and  had  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  the  Petitioners  have"
"interfered  with 
the 
cultivation 
rights  of 
the  9th  Respondent 
and"
"accordingly  had  directed  the  Petitioners  to  remove  the  obstructions  to"
"the  agricultural  roadway  which  gives  access  to  the  land  that  has  been"
"identified as a paddy land and to allow the 9th Respondent to cultivate the"
"land (document marked P10)."
"It 
is 
the  main  submission  of 
the 
learned  President  Counsel  of 
the"
"Petitioners 
that 
Section 
90 
of 
the  Act 
does 
not 
empower 
the"
"Commissioner General of Agrarian Services to entertain a complaint made"
"by a person who is not an owner, cultivator, or occupier of an agricultural"
"land.  It  is  contended  that  the  evidence  adduced  at  the  inquiry  failed  to"
"prove the fact that the 9th Respondent is the owner or the occupier of the"
"land.  Hence, 
it 
is  claimed 
that 
the  decision  P10  made  by 
the  2nd"
"Respondent 
is  prejudicial  to  the  right  of  the  Petitioners  who  are  the"
"present cultivators or occupiers of the land in issue."
