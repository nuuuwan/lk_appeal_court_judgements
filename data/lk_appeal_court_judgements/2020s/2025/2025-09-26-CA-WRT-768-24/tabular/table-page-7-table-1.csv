"with  such  directions  as  may  be  specified 
in  such  order"
"necessary for the protection of such rights :"
"In  view  of  the  above  facts  and  circumstances,  the  fact  that  the  9th"
"Respondent was an occupier of the lands in dispute has been established."
"Thus, 
in  terms  of  Section  90(1)  of  the  Act,  the  9th  Respondent  was"
"empowered 
to  make 
a 
complaint 
to 
the 
Commissioner-General"
"thereunder.  Therefore,  the  contention  of  the  Petitioners  that  the  9th"
"Respondent lacks standing to make a complaint in terms of Section 90(1),"
"is untenable."
"The  Petitioners  contend  that  the  Order  marked  P10  is  not  a  speaking"
"order. It is my view that under Section 90(1) of the Act, the issuance of an"
"order  is  dependent  upon  the Commissioner-General  being  satisfied  that"
"such interference or attempted interference will result in damage or loss"
"of crop or livestock. The 2nd Respondent in her Order P10 specified that"
"she had satisfied that the 2nd Petitioner had interfered with the cultivation"
"rights  of 
the  9th  Respondent 
in 
view  of 
the  proceedings  of 
the"
"investigation,  written  submissions,  and  the  inspection  held.  I  am  of  the"
"view  that  the  Order  P10  read  with  Section  90(1)  of  the  Act  speaks  for"
"itself  that  the  interference  or  attempted  interference  by  the  Petitioners"
"will  result  in  damage  or  loss  of  crop  or  livestock  in  the  impugned  land."
"Accordingly, 
I  view 
that 
the 
impugned  Order  P10 
is 
in  substantive"
"compliance  with  Section  90  of  the  Act,  and  the  P10  itself  is  a  speaking"
"order. Further,  it is noted that the facts and materials placed before the"
"2nd Respondent do not suggest otherwise that the Commissioner-General"
"could have arrived at a contrary decision to that of P10. Therefore, I am of"
"the opinion that the Order P10 does not contravene the provisions under"
"Section 90(1) of the Act or principles of natural justice."
"The  7th,  8th  and  9th  Respondents  claim  that  the  Petitioners  unlawfully"
"obstructed 
the 
access 
road 
to 
the  properties  owned  by 
the  9th"
"Respondent, depicted as Lot 359 in the Village Plan bearing No. 510 and"
"that the same is a property of the State. In support of the said position,"
"the  Respondents  submitted  the  village  Plan  No.  510  marked  Y2  and  the"
