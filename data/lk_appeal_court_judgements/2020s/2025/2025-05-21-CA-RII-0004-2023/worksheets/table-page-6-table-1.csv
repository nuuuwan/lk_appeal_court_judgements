"In  the  District  Court,  the  petitioner  himself  has  given  evidence  in  favour  of"
"the defendant.  The petitioner very well knew that by this action, the plaintiff"
"sought to eject the defendant from the premises involved in this application."
"He gave evidence on 18-12-2013, and he was 33 years old by then.  By that"
"time, his motherâ€™s application to intervene in the case was already rejected."
"At that time he did not claim that he was also living in that premises. He did"
"not give evidence to the effect that he was also in possession of the premises."
"This  conduct  of  the petitioner  deprives him  of  seeking  relief  in  Restitutio-in-"
"Integrum  application.  The  application  of  the  petitioner  is  dismissed  with"
"costs."
