"premises described in the schedule to the plaint for two years.  After the two"
"years  the  defendant  continued  in  that  premises  as  a  monthly  tenant  of  the"
"plaintiff.  Thereafter, by letter dated 28-10-2005, the plaintiff had terminated"
"the  tenancy  agreement  with  the  defendant. 
  Answering  the  plaint, 
the"
"defendant  admitted  that  the  lease  agreement  referred  to  in  the  plaint  was"
"terminated.  However, the defendant took up the position that after the lease"
"agreement  was 
terminated, 
the  defendant 
entered 
into 
a  new 
lease"
"agreement 
for  the  same  premises  with  the  new  owner  of  the  premises,"
"namely Payagala Vidana Arachchige Rohini Perera and became the tenant of"
"the  said  Rohini  Perera.    Rohini  Perera  made  an  application  to  intervene  in"
"the action.  That application was dismissed by the Learned District Judge on"
"29-05-2008,  and  the  said  Rohini  Perera  had  not  appealed  against  that"
"Order.  The said Rohini Perera is the mother of the present petitioner.  After"
"the trial, the judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff.  The defendant"
"appealed  against  the  said  judgment.    While  the  appeal  was  pending,  the"
"plaintiff  made  an  application  to  execute  the  Writ  of  Possession. 
  That"
"application  was  allowed  by  the  District  Judge,  and  the  Writ  of  Possession"
"was executed."
"T
he  petitioner  filed an  application  under  Section  328  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code  and  took  up  the  position  that  his  mother,  Rohini  Perera,  became  the"
"owner of the premises, and she had gifted the same to the petitioner, and the"
"petitioner  became  the  owner  of  the  premises  and  the  petitioner  was  not  a"
"person claiming under the defendant."
"A
fter an inquiry, the Learned District Judge, by her Order dated 22-02-2023,"
"dismissed  the  petitioners’  application  made  under  Section  328  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code."
"T
he  Learned  District  Judge  observed  that  the  petitioner  had  failed  to  make"
"an application within fifteen days of the execution of the Writ.  Further, she"
"had  considered  whether  the  petitioner  came 
into  possession  under  the"
"defendant.  The Learned District Judge had observed that at the time of the"
"execution  of 
the  Writ,  Payagala  Vithana  Arachchige  Rohini  Perera  and"
"Madappuli  Arachchige  Dinusha  Madubashini  Fernando  were  in  the  house."
"While the Writ was being executed, the petitioner came to that place and told"
"the fiscal officer that he was also residing in that house. The Learned District"
"Judge  observed 
that 
the  petitioner’s  mother,  after 
the  rejection  of  her"
"application to intervene, took no further steps to canvass the rejection of her"
"application before any other forum.  The Learned District Judge further held"
"that  the  petitioner  was  not  a  bona  fide  possessor  of  the  premises  and  had"
"sought  to  adduce  false  evidence  in  support  of  his  case  through  Grama"
"Niladhari. It is evident from the evidence given by the petitioner on behalf of"
"the  defendant  at  the  trial  that  the  petitioner  was  not  in  possession  of  the"
"premises."
