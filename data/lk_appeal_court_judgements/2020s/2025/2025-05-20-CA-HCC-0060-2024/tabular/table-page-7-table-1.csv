"When we consider the evidence of PW1, it is highly improbable that a person who was in"
"possession of heroin of more than 1kg would keep such a parcel on his lap when the vehicle"
"was stopped and searched by the Police officers."
"Upon applying the test of probability and the test of improbability to the aforementioned"
"facts, it becomes evident that the evidence presented through the prosecution narratives"
"cannot be deemed credible."
"The other point to consider is the rejection of the evidence of the Appellant by the Learned"
"Trial Judge. The Learned High Court Judge rejected the evidence of the Appellant on the"
"basis that the Appellant has the burden to prove the facts he has stated."
"According to the evidence of the Appellant, they were going to the place of one Mohan to"
"collect money he had already lent. According to the Appellant, this parcel was introduced"
"by the Police which was given by the said Mohan. The fact remains that, the information"
"received was that heroin was transported in the said van. The check post was situated"
"close to the Police station. If so, what is the reason for the police to wait for two hours to"
"take them to the Police Station?"
"Our  Courts  have  given  the  following  guidelines  with  regard  to  the  evaluation  of  the"
"evidence by the Trial Judge."
