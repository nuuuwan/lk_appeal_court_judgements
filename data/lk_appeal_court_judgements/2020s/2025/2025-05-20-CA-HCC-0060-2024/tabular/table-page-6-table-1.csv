"“Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version"
"of  the  witnesses  therefore  cannot  be  annexed  with  undue  importance.  More  so"
"when  the  all-important  “probabilities-factor”  echoes 
in  favour  of  the  version"
"narrated by the witnesses.”"
"In Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and Others [1996] 2 S.L.R. 95, on page 98, His Lordship"
"Jayasuriya J. observed that;"
"“A Judge, in applying the test of Probability and Improbability, relies heavily on"
"his knowledge of men and matters and the patterns of conduct observed by human"
"beings both ingenious as well as those who are less talented and fortunate."""
"A  similar  situation  with  regard  to  high  improbability  was  considered  by  Her  Ladyship"
"Deepali Wijesundera J in Selvanayagam Carmel Jenova Vs. The Attorney General, CA"
"Case No. 107/2011 decided on 13.10.2021 and held that;"
"“The  grounds  of  appeal  urged  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  are  as"
"follows.  That  the  version  of  the  prosecution  is  highly  improbable  and  that  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  had 
failed  to  apply  the  test  of  probability  and"
"improbability in evaluating the evidence. The appellant’s counsel submitted that"
"it  is  highly  improbable  to  believe  that  when  six  police  officers  were  searching  a"
"small house for the appellant to take address alleged to have contained heroin in"
"the pocket and put it in to a bucket. If the appellant took the said dress from the"
"clothes line and put it into a bucket as claimed by the prosecution this would have"
"drawn their attention to the dress which is not the conduct of a wrong doer. I find"
"this  improbable.  There  are  more  than  enough places  in  a  house  to  conceal such"
"articles.”"
