"close proximity of the Kollonnawa oil refinery, the Petitioners have obtained written permission,"
"marked as P3, from the Ministry of Defence. According to the approved plan marked as P4 and"
"P5 the Petitioners have constructed a single story building in the said premises. The Petitioners"
"have obtained a building construction report issued by the Petroleum Storage Terminal  as well"
"(P6). The Petitioners state that they conduct tuition classes in the said premises to the students of"
"the area under the name and style of ‘Syntax’ which is registered (P7)."
"On 16.02.2024 the Petitioners received a letter from the 1st Respondent requesting the Petitioners"
"to relocate the tuition classes, cut down the mango tree and remove the illegal constructions (P8)."
"In terms of the documents tendered, it is established that the constructions of the Petitioners are"
"lawful and in terms of the approved plan issued by the relevant authorities. The mango tree does"
"not  cause  any  disturbance  to  the  common  right  of  way  or  to  the  parties,  and  there  is  no  noise"
"pollution or traffic congestion caused by the conduct of tuition classes. Thereafter, the 1st, 2nd and"
"3rd Respondents have withdrawn the said letter marked P8. It is stated that the 4th Respondent being"
"a Legal Officer of the 1st Respondent, on the instructions of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents parks"
"her car and has given permission to her clients, who come to consult her, to park their vehicles"
"obstructing the said common right of way, which is marked as lot 2 in plan marked as P2. The"
"Petitioners further state that the permission given by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to their Legal"
"Officer, the 4th Respondent, to park her vehicle in the common right of way is unreasonable, illegal"
"and mala fide."
"Having scrutinised the petition, affidavit, objections, documents and submissions it is abundantly"
"clear that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have no right to allow the 4th Respondent to park her"
"vehicle in the common right of way. Admittedly, the 4th Respondent being a Chief Legal Officer"
"of the 1st Respondent has no legal right to park her vehicle in the common right of way obstructing"
"the said common piece of land."
"It is manifestly clear that the decision of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the aforesaid conduct"
"of  the  4th  Respondent  are  unlawful,  illegal,  arbitrary,  and  violating  the  lawful  right  of  the"
"Petitioners. In the event of failure on the part of this court exercising its revisionary jurisdiction,"
"indeed material prejudice will be caused to the Petitioners due to the illegal conduct of the public"
"institution and public officers, namely the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents."
