"16.  In  the  case  of  Queen  vs  V.P.Julis  [1953]  65  NLR  505  at  510-511,"
"Basnakaye, C.J. has held that,"
"“The identification of the accused at a parade held before the trial"
"is not substantive evidence at the trial. The fact that the witness"
"has been able to identify the accused at the identification parade"
"is  only  a  circumstance  corroborative  of  the  identification  at  the"
"trial.  The  jury  can  act  only  on  the  evidence  given  before  them."
"There  is  no  section  of  the  evidence  ordinance  which  declares"
"proceedings at an identification parade to be evidence as to the"
"fact  of  identity.  The  principal  evidence  of  identification  is  the"
"evidence of the witness given in court as to how and under what"
"circumstances he came to pick out a particular accused person"
"and the details of the part which the accused took in the crime in"
"question”."
