"participated as witnesses. It is important to note that PW01’s wife was"
"unable to provide testimony at the trial due to her passing prior to the"
"proceedings."
"13.  In  his  testimony,  PW01  has  referred  to  the 
identification  parade,"
"affirming  that  he  identified  the  appellant,  during  that  event.    In  open"
"Court,  he  has  reiterated 
that 
the 
individual  he 
identified  as 
the"
"perpetrator  was  indeed  the  same  person  standing  in  trial.  However,"
"during 
cross-examination, 
significant 
inconsistencies, 
in 
PW01’s"
"testimony  has  come 
to 
light. 
It  has  been 
revealed 
that  he  had"
"contradicted  himself  regarding  the  physical  features  of  the  appellant"
"when  describing  him  in  Court,  compared  to  earlier  descriptions  made"
"during his statement, to the investigating officers."
"14.  Additionally,  PW01  has  disclosed  that  the  appellant  has  visited  his"
"business  premises  on 
two  prior  occasions.  This 
revelation 
raised"
"questions  about  his  ability  to  confidently  identify  the  appellant  at  the"
"identification  parade,  as  it  was  information  not  included  in  his  initial"
"statement  to  the  investigation  officers.  These  discrepancies  call  into"
"question 
the 
reliability  of  PW01’s 
identification  and  whether  his"
"identification of the appellant was influenced by prior encounters rather"
"than by identification parade itself."
"15.  The 
identification  of 
the  appellant 
further 
raises  critical 
issues"
"regarding the credibility of witness's testimony as well as the integrity of"
"the identification parade, especially given the 8 year delay between the"
"incident and the parade.  The inconsistencies of PW01’s testimony and"
"the  absence  of  corroborating  testimony  from  his  deceased  wife  further"
"underscore the complexities."
