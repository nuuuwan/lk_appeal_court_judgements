"Furthermore,  Section  31  of  the  Local  Authorities  Elections  Ordinance  provides  an"
"exhaustive list of grounds upon which nomination papers may be rejected. A careful"
"examination  of  these  provisions  reveals  that  the  legislature  did  not  include  the"
"method of document certification as a permissible basis for rejection."
"Section  28(8)  grants  the  independent  group  leader  or  secretary  of  the  registered"
"political party the right to rectify any errors or omissions in nomination papers before"
"the  nomination  period  expires.  This  provision  establishes  that  when  any  error  or"
"omission exists in the nomination papers, the Returning Officer has a duty to inform"
"the independent group leader or secretary of the registered political party to enable"
"correction of such error or omission."
"Having carefully considered these applications, this Court observes that Returning"
"Officers  appear  increasingly  inclined  to  reject  nominations  on  minor  technicalities"
"and frivolous grounds, an approach wholly inconsistent with legislative intent. The"
"statutory framework governing elections was never designed to empower Returning"
"Officers as obstructive gatekeepers, rather, their proper role is to serve as facilitators"
"of the democratic process. It is imperative that these officials make conscious efforts"
"to interpret electoral provisions liberally, resolve ambiguities in favor of participation."
"Such  an  approach  is  essential  to  safeguard  both  the  fundamental  right  to  contest"
"elections and the correlative right of electors to choose their representatives freely."
"This Court is further mindful of the fact that no candidate or registered political party"
"raised objections before the Returning Officer regarding the authenticity of the birth"
"certificates in question. Moreover, for the identification of the candidates in all these"
"applications, the National Identity Card of the candidates have been tendered."
"For the foregoing reasons I hold that the copies of the birth certificate certified by the"
"Justice of Peace or the Notary Public is sufficient to accept as certified documents in"
"terms of the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, and therefore"
"the decision of the Returning Officer rejecting the nomination papers is quashed. This"
"Court issues a Writ of Mandamus directing the 6th and 7th Respondent to accept the"
"nomination  papers  submitted  by  the  Petitioners.  Accordingly,  the  application  is"
"allowed. No cost."
"The  judgement  in  this  application  is  applicable  and  binding  on  all  parties  in  the"
"connected applications bearing nos. WRT/280, 259, 255, 260, 227, 296, 273, 230, 231,"
