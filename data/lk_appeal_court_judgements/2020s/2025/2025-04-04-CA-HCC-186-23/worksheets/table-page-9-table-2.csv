"17. The primary concern of PW1 as the officer in charge of the raid had been"
"the  safety  of  the  other  officers  and  the  appellant.  Before  sealing  the"
"parcel that contained the other parcels with the powdered substance, at"
"the  scene  of  arrest,  PW1  has  conducted  a  risk  assessment.  Such"
"assessment  has  been  aimed  to  determine  whether  there  was  a  risk  of"
"conflict with the members of the public. Upon concluding that it was not"
"safe  to  proceed,  PW1  has  decided  against  sealing  the  production  at  the"
"scene of arrest. Therefore, PW1 has acted within his authority in making"
"such a decision."
