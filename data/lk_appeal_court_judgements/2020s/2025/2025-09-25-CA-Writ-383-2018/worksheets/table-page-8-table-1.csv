"Failure to disclose freight or insurance as evidence of intent to defraud revenue"
"The  Petitioner  has  taken  the  position  that,  as  the  contract  with  ALSN  was  a  “turnkey”"
"contract,  and  as  such,  the  goods  were  delivered  on  DDU  terms,  without  separate"
"disclosure  of 
freight  and 
insurance  or  tendering  distinct 
invoices  for  such  charges."
"However,  the  absence  of  freight  or 
insurance  being  separately  mentioned  does  not"
"negate the existence of an actual cost of freight or insurance. The Petitioner’s support of"
"the  position  taken  by  ALSN  that  these  costs  could  not  be  extricated  from  the  DDU"
"amount  has  resulted 
in  the  base  upon  which  “customs  value” 
is  calculated  being"
"substantially reduced or of undervaluation."
"It is a well-established  principle of commercial jurisprudence that the primary object of"
"trade 
is  the  making  of  profit.  To  achieve  profitability,  a  trader  must  ascertain  with"
"precision  the  total  expenditure  incurred  until  the  product  is  ready  for  delivery  to  the"
"purchaser, so that the sale price may be fixed with an appropriate margin of profit."
"It  is  untenable  for  an  international  corporate  entity  to  profess  ignorance  of  the  costs"
"incurred in placing goods in a saleable condition, particularly where those very costs were"
"borne by the entity itself. Such a position is contrary to commercial common sense and"
"inconsistent with ordinary accounting practice."
"The price schedules  of the contract  (at Part  2  - Provisioning  Schedules  of  the Contract)"
"under the heading “Submersible Plant – Sri Lankan Seas”, the “FOB price” (Free on Board)"
"for the Sri Lankan segment of the undersea cable, is shown to be the same as the “DDU"
"price”  (Delivered  Duty  Unpaid) 
implying  that  transport  expenses  or 
insurance  up  to"
"delivery to the destination was already included in the FOB price.  The expenses are not"
"separately itemised, but rather incorporated into a single composite price."
"Even  though  it  can  be  argued  that  INCOTERMS  are  not  pricing  methods,  the  question"
"remains as to why an INCOTERM, such as FOB, which would specifically make it appear"
"that the cost of freight and insurance is not included in that amount, isused to describe"
"the unit price as well as the total price."
"I  am  satisfied  that  the  refusal  of  the  Petitioner  to  provide  a  breakdown  of  freight  and"
"insurance  creates  a  grave  suspicion  that  the  amount  described  as  the  FOB  price  or  the"
"DDU price does not include the freight and insurance charges. By concealing freight and"
"insurance, there can be a substantial reduction in customs duties for the Petitioner. The"
"Petitioner undoubtedly would be the main beneficiary of this situation."
