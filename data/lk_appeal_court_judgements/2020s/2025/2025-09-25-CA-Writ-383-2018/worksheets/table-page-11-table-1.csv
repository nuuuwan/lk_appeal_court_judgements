"Installation/Laying Charges"
"The  Petitioner’s  position  is  that,  as  this  was  a  “turnkey”  contract,  the  contract  price"
"included  everything  and  ALSN  undertook  to  deliver  a  fully  operational  submarine  cable"
"system, including transport, assembling, and laying, for one unified price. And as such, no"
"separate value was allocated to laying the cable within Sri Lankan waters."
"The  laying  was  integral  to  importation.  The  cable  had  no  utility  until  it  is  installed;  the"
"vessel’s  operation  was  not  mere  transport  but  simultaneous  installation.  Under  Article"
"8(1)(e)(ii)  of  Schedule  E,  “handlings  associated  with  transport”  includes  the  controlled"
"discharge of the cable along the seabed. Thus, what was imported was not just coils of"
"cable, but a functioning segment of the network delivered into Sri Lanka’s territory. Same"
"as the freight and Insurance, it should be calculated and separately added."
"Allegations of bias and breach of natural justice"
"The Petitioner’s contention  that  the inquiry  offended the principles of natural justice is"
"devoid of merit. A show-cause notice is required only to set out the allegations, and not"
"the underlying reasons for such allegations, particularly where the notice is issued at the"
"conclusion of an inquiry in which the Petitioner has actively participated. The obligation"
"to  provide  reasons  arises  at  the  stage  of  the  final  order.  In  the  present  instance,  the"
"Petitioner  was  clearly 
informed  that  the  charges  pertained  to  the  failure  to  declare"
"freight, insurance, and laying costs. The Petitioner responded to these charges by filing"
"detailed written submissions."
"The 
allegation  of  bias 
is  wholly  unsubstantiated.  On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
record"
"demonstrates  impartiality  on  the  part  of  the  inquiry  officer,  who,  upon  considering  the"
"Petitioner’s  position,  accepted 
it  and  accordingly  withdrew  one  of  the  charges.  The"
"Petitioner  was  afforded  an  unimpeded  opportunity  to  adduce  evidence.  It 
is  also  of"
"significance  that  the  inquiry  extended  over  several  hearings,  during  which  both  parties"
"were represented by legal counsel."
"In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the inquiry was conducted in conformity with the"
"rules of natural justice, and that no infringement of those principles has been disclosed."
"On 11th September 2018, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the 2nd Respondent"
"has issued a detailed show cause notice with the relevant values and penal sections. As"
"such, once the show cause notice was issued, the Petitioner should have been fully aware"
