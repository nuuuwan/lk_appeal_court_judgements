"paid  or  payable  for  the  goods  when  sold  for  export,3  adjusted  in  accordance  with  the"
"provisions of Article 8."
"Article 8 of Schedule E requires that certain elements be added to the price actually paid"
"or payable if not already included. These include:"
" 
Transport (freight) to the port/place of importation."
" 
Loading, unloading, and handling charges."
" 
Insurance cost."
"If  explained  in  a  simple  manner,  these  adjustments  together  effectively  convert  a  FOB"
"invoice price into a CIF equivalent customs value (Cost + Insurance + Freight), and the CIF"
"value is thus ‘generally’ the basis for duty assessment."
"Regardless of the INCOTERMS used or whether the total value mentioned in the CusDec"
"includes the cost of freight and Insurance or not, in order for the customs to arrive at the"
"“customs  value”, 
the  Customs  need 
to  know  exactly 
the  cost  of 
freight 
(freight"
"component)  and  the  cost  of  Insurance  (Insurance  Component)  separately.  If  freight  or"
"insurance amounts are not declared, Customs cannot leave them at zero; the law obliges"
"Customs  to 
include  them 
in  the  “customs  value”.  However,  Customs  cannot  apply"
"arbitrary  or  fictitious  values.  The  statutory  requirement  is  that  any  addition  must  be"
"founded on objective and quantifiable data.4"
"It  is  accepted  that  in  the  CusDec  S-17693  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the"
"“P19(b)”), the cost of the freight and Insurance components is not shown separately, and"
"in  the  CusDec  S-28036  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  “P20(b)”),  only  the"
"Insurance component has been shown separately."
"The reason for the difference may be the fact that in P19(b) the INCOTERM is declared as"
"CIF, and in P20(b) the INCOTERM is declared as CFR."
"Further,  the  Petitioner’s  CusDecs  did  not 
include  the  portion  of  the  contract  price"
"attributable to the cable-laying/installation services within Sri Lankan territorial waters. It"
"is the position of the Customs that the commodity (the cable) achieves its purpose and"
"accordingly  the  ‘value’  after  it  has  been  laid  on  the  seabed  of  the  Sri  Lankan  territorial"
"waters."
