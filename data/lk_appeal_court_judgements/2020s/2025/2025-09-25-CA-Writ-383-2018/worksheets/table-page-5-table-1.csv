"It is of importance to note at this stage that, out of the four aspects initially subjected to",""
"inquiry  (as  stated  above),  the  allegation  concerning  the  length  of  cable  laid  within  Sri",""
"Lanka’s Exclusive Economic Zone was withdrawn by the Customs Inquiry Officer (the 2nd",""
"Respondent),  upon 
acceptance  of 
the  Petitioner’s","contention 
that 
the  Customs"
"Ordinance has no application beyond the limits of the country’s territorial waters.",""
"The  inquiry  proceeded  only  in  respect  of  the  remaining  charges,  namely,  the  alleged",""
"omission  of  freight,  insurance,  and  cable-laying/installation  costs  (within  the  territorial",""

"The  Petitioner,  throughout  customs  inquiry,  had  categorically  and  continuously  stated",""
"that they are unable to provide the missing values separately, as contract between them",""
"and  ALSN,  being  a  so-called  “turnkey”  contract,  ALSN","is  contractually  obligated  to"
"complete and hand over the “works and the system” in an operational state. As such, the",""
"price  quoted  by  ALSN  is  inclusive  of  total  expenses  incurred  (obviously  inclusive  of  the",""
"profit margin) up to the moment of handing over to the Petitioner.  It is the Petitioner’s",""
"position that, as no breakdown of the price has been given to them, they are unable to",""
"ascertain  freight,  insurance,  and  cable-laying/installation  costs  separately.  Further,  that",""
"they  do  not  want  to  notionally  separate  these  expenses  from  the  rest,  as  that  would",""
"amount to a false declaration.",""
"The Petitioner has further contended that, as ALSN had used their own specialised ships",""
"to lay the cable up to Sri Lankan shores, and as such, there is no ship owner, charterer, or",""
"freight forwarder who can supply the absent freight amounts.",""
"The Petitioner is heavily reliant on a letter marked as D6 dated 08th March 2018 received",""
