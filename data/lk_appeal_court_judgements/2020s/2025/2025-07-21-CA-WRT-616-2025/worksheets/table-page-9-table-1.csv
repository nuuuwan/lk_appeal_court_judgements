"that  on  17.12.2024, 
the  1st  respondent  was  notified  of 
the  HRC"
"complaint. According to X-7 the petitioner had informed that the relief"
"he  is  seeking  is  the  obtaining  of  the  Leaving  Certificate  and  the  No"
"Objection Letter. The sum total is that on a consideration of the totality"
"of this material, it is apparent that the petitioner did in fact request for"
"the Leaving Certificate as well as the No Objection Letter in November"
"2024. Therefore, the denial made in paragraph 07 cannot be correct and"
"true."

"dated 09.04.2025 (X-26) formally informs that there is no objection in"
"respect of football, but does not grant the No Objection Letter in respect"
"of rugby. This letter does not make any reference to the alleged illegal"
"participation  at  a 
rugby  match  between  Kingswood  College  and"

the  aforesaid, 
the  1st"

"fact true and in existence, these issues should necessarily be relevant in"
"issuing  the  Leaving  Certificate  as  well  as  the  consideration  of  the  No"
"Objection.  Therefore,  the  allegation  made  of  mala  fides  cannot  be"
"disregarded in view of the conduct of the 3rd respondent as aforesaid."
