the  Settlement  Order  dated  09.08.1972  published 
in 
the"
"Gazette No.43 dated 19.01.1973, after more than 45 years. Additionally,"
"Section  4(1)  of  the Ordinance  stipulates  that,  if no  claim  to  such  land  is"
"made  to  the  settlement  officer  within  three  months  from  a  date  to  be"
"specified in settlement notice, the land to which no claim has been made,"
"will be declared under section 5 (1) to be the property of the State and"
"will be dealt with on account of the State. Once the statute gives specific"
"time 
limits,  no 
further  claims  could  be  made  or 
received  by 
the"
"settlement  officer  after  the  lapse  of  the  statutorily  specified  time  limit,"
"especially after a long delay of 45 years. The Respondents argue that the"
"application  of 
the  Petitioners  should  be  dismissed

the"
"Petitioners  failed  to  provide  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the  above-"
"mentioned  delay  or 
laches.  Therefore,  the 
fundamental 
issue  to  be"
"determined in this application is whether the settlement notice issued in"
"1967 and the settlement order issued in 1973 could be challenged after"
"such a lengthy period of time."
"It is a well-established principle that an application for a Writ of Certiorari"
"must be filed within a reasonable time from the decision or order which"
"the applicant is challenging. In the case of Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis and"
"Others (1982) 1 Sri LR 368, the Supreme Court stated that,"
