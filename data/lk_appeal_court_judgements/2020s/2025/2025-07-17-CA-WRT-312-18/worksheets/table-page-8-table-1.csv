"Accordingly,  I  view  that  the  Petitionersâ€™  argument  that  the 
impugned"
"Settlement Notice is ultra vires, as the alleged lands do not fall within the"
"purview of Section 4(1) of the Ordinance, cannot be upheld."
"Further,  it  is  observed  that  a  period  of  three  months  from  a  date  to  be"
"specified in  the  settlement  notice  is  given  to  the  persons  who  have  any"
"interest or share in the relevant land to make their claims under Section"
"4(1) of the Ordinance. In the instant application, it appears that no claim"
"had  been  made  by  the  Petitioners  during  the  said  specified  period  of"
"three  months.  Such  failure  of  the  Petitioners  to  submit  their  alleged"
"claims  within  the  period  of  three  months  further  supports  the  above"
"presumption 
that 
the  Settlement  Officer 
took  steps 
to  publish 
the"
"impugned  Settlement  Notice  only  because  he  was  satisfied  of 
the"
"conditions  specified 
in  Section  4(1)(b)  of 
the  Ordinance.  Since 
the"
"relevant stakeholders had been given the opportunity (three months) to"
"make  their  alleged  claims,  no  allegations  could  be  advanced  that  the"
"Petitioners had not been offered a fair hearing."
"Procedural Impropriety"
"The Petitioners claim that certain procedural steps, which are set out in"
"Section  4  of  the  Ordinance,  have  been  violated  by  the  Respondents"
"during  the  publication  of  the 
impugned  Settlement  Notice.  Section  4"
"stipulates  the  requirements  such  as  publishing  the  settlement  notice  in"
"the  Gazette  in  three  languages,  posting  copies  of  the  notice  within  the"
"village 
in  which  the 
land 
is  situated,  affixed  to  the  walls  of  several"
"Kachcheris and several courts and beating of tom-tom on or near the land"
"within  six  weeks  from  the  date  of  the  publication  of  the  notice,  etc  in"
"order  to  give  the  due  publicity  to  the  relevant  settlement  notice.  The"
"Petitioners submit that the said prerequisites were not complied with by"
"the  Settlement  Officer  prior  to  publishing 
the 
impugned  Settlement"
"Order."
"There are certain facts which need not be proved by either party, as the"
"Court can take judicial notice of the same. As provided under Section 81"
"of the Evidence  Ordinance,  genuineness of a Gazette Notification  is one"
"such  matter.  The  impugned  settlement  notices  and  the  order  had  been"
