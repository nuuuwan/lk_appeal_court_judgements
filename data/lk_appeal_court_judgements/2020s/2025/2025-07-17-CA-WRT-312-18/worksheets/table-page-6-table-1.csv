"Notice  or  Settlement  Order  as  per  Section  4(1)  of  the  Land  Settlement"
"Ordinance.  It  shall  be  lawful  for  the  settlement  officer  to  declare  by  a"
"notice that, if no claim to a land or to any share of or interest in such land"
"in  the  nature  specified  under  the  Section  4(2)  is  made  to  him  within  a"
"period of three months from a notified date, such land, share or interest"
"will be declared under section 5 (1) to be the property of the State and"
"will be dealt with on account of the State. Said Section 4(1) is as follows:"
"“(1) Whenever it appears to the Settlement Officer that any land is"
"of any of the following descriptions: -"
"(a)  forest,  waste,  unoccupied,  or  uncultivated 
land,  or  chena  or"
"other  land  which  can  only  be  cultivated  after  intervals  of  several"
"years; or"
"(b)  cultivated  or  otherwise  improved  land  which  was,  within  the"
"period  of  twenty-five  years  next  preceding  the  date  of  the  notice"
"hereinafter 
in  this  subsection  provided 
for, 
land  of  any  of  the"
"descriptions specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection,"
"it shall be lawful for him to declare by a notice signed and dated by"
"him  and  published  as  hereinafter  provided 
(in 
this  Ordinance"
"referred to as a ""settlement notice "") that, if no claim to such land"
"or to any share of or interest in such land is made to him within a"
"period  of  three  months  from  a  date  to  be  specified  in  such  notice"
"the  land  to  which  or  to  any  share  of  or  interest  in which  no  claim"
"has been made as aforesaid will be declared under section 5 (1) to"
"be the property of the State and will be dealt with on account of the"
"State:”"
"There is no specific evidence before this Court to conclude under which"
"description of Section 4(1), the Settlement Officer had decided to publish"
"the  notice 
in 
issue.  However, 
it 
is  on  the  common  ground  that  the"
"impugned lands, which have been settled in favour of the State, did not"
"fall  within  the  provisions  specified  under  Subsection  (a)  of  Section  4(1)"
"above.  The  Respondents 
in  their  oral  submission,  as  well  as 
in  their"
"written  submissions,  conceded  the 
impossibility  of  relying  on  Section"
"4(1)(a)."
