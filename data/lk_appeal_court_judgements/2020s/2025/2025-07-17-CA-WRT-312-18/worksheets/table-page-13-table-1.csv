"Supreme  Court  judgement  is  that,  in  the  instant  application,  there  is  a"
"matter to be looked into at the stage of argument without dismissing at"
"the preliminary stage. The matter is remitted to this Court for full hearing"
"with  the  direction  “…the  Court  of  Appeal  to  complete  all  pleadings...”"
"without  imposing  any  restrictions  based  on  lashes.  Hence,  no  inference"
"could be drawn by this Court to the extent that the Respondents are not"
"entitled to raise the objection based on laches. Accordingly, I do not agree"
"with 
the  argument  advanced  on  behalf  of 
the  Petitioners 
that 
the"
"Respondents are not entitled to raise the objection based on laches at the"
"argument."
"The  main  argument 
that 
the  Respondents  repeatedly 
raised 
in 
this"
"application 
is  whether 
the 
impugned 
Gazette 
No.14733 
dated"
"27.01.1967,  after  more  than  52  years,  and  the  Gazette  No.43  dated"
"19.01.1973,  after  more  than  45  years,  could  be  challenged  before  this"
"Court. The only reason that the Petitioners submit to justify the long delay"
"to make the application is that they were not aware of the above Gazettes"
"until the Settlement Notice was brought to their notice for the first time"
"on  or  about  21.05.2018  and  the  Settlement  Order was  disclosed  by  the"
"4th  Respondent  by  his  letter  dated  02.07.2018(see  paragraph  52  of  the"
"Petition)."
"Section  81  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  stipulates  that  the  Court  shall"
"presume 
the  genuineness  of  every  document  purporting 
to  be 
the"
"Gazette  of  Ceylon  or  Sri  Lanka.  Accordingly,  the  existence  of  the  above"
"Gazettes  could  be  presumed.  Nevertheless,  the  existence  of  the  above"
"Gazette Notifications is not in dispute. A Gazette is an official publication"
"that  notifies  of  the  actions  and  decisions  of  the  government.  Notices"
"published in government Gazettes encompass all aspects of governmental"
"concern 
and 
regulation, 
and  most 
are 
published 
due 
to 
legal"
"requirements."
"The  Government  Gazette  serves  as  an  authorized  legal  document  and"
"vital  tool  that  provides  access  to  official/public  notifications,  ensuring"
"transparency  and  public  awareness.  As  commonly  known,  ignorance  of"
"the 
law 
is  not  an  excuse.  Likewise, 
sometimes 
ignorance  of

"pertaining  to  official  acts  cannot  be  considered  as  an  excuse.  Thus,  the"
