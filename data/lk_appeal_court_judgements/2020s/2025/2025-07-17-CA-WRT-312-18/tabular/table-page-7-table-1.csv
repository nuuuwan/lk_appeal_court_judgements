"Nevertheless,  the  Respondents  rely  on  the  provisions  under  Section"
"4(1)(b) of the Ordinance, upon which it shall be lawful for the Settlement"
"Officer to publish a Notice of Settlement in respect of the forest, waste,"
"unoccupied, or uncultivated land, or chena or other land, which had been"
"cultivated  or  otherwise  improved  within  the  period  of  twenty-five  years"
"next  preceding  the  date  of  the  notice  which  amount  to  a  conditional"
"publication.  The  submission  of  the  Petitioners  is  that  the  Respondents"
"need to provide clear and unequivocal evidence that the land in question"
"falls within the criteria set out under Section 4(1)(b) during the required"
"25-year  period. 
It  should  be  noted 
that 
in 
the  given 
instance, 
the"
"Petitioners are attempting to obtain the reliefs sought from this Court by"
"shifting the burden to the Respondents after more than half a century of"
"sleeping over their rights."
"The 
impugned 
Settlement  Notice  had  been 
issued 
in  1967. 
The"
"Settlement Officer would not have issued the Settlement Notice unless he"
"had been satisfied himself that the land to be settled had been cultivated"
"or improved within the period specified in Section. In the instance where"
"the Settlement Officer had taken steps to publish a Settlement Notice, it"
"could be presumed that the Settlement Officer published such notice only"
"because such conditions precedent have been fulfilled at the time of the"
"publication  of  the  same,  until  the  contrary 
is  proved.  (All  things  are"
"presumed  to  have  been  done  according  to 
law  until  the  contrary 
is"
"proved/  Omnia 
praesumuntur

"However,  the  Petitioners  submit  that  most  of  the  land  lots  described  in"
"the 
Settlement  Notice 
are 
identified 
as 
salterns 
and  have  been"
"continuously used for generations for the manufacture of solar salt since"
"time  immemorial.  I  am  of  the  view  that  a  mere  submission  does  not"
"enable this Court to come to a conclusion contrary to the opinion formed"
"by the Settlement Officer owing to the absence of any clear evidence to"
"support the stance of the Petitioner that the lands in concern did not fall"
"under  the  purview  of  Section  4(1)(b)  of  the  Ordinance.  Further,  the"
"Petitioners' contention that the Petitioners were unaware of the relevant"
"Gazette 
is  not 
tenable  as 
it  was  an  accessible  public  document."
