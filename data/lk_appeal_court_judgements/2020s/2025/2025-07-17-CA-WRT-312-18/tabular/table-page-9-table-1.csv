"notice without calling for any evidence. Additionally, as per Section 4(5) of"
"the Ordinance, the Gazette in which such settlement notice is published,"
"if  produced  in  any  Court  in  Sri  Lanka  the  same  should  be  received  as"
"prima facie evidence of such requirements specified under the Ordinance"
"have  been  duly  complied  with 
in 
issuing  such  notice.  Further, 
it 
is"
"observed that a certain lot bearing No.274 has been settled to one Pitchai"
"Thamby  Marikkar  Zeynambu  Netchiya  of  5th  Cross  Street,  Puttalam,  by"
"Settlement Order No.146 (page 46 of the Gazette marked P14B). It means"
"that  there  had  been  at  least  one  claimant.  The  inference  that  could  be"
"reached by such observation is that a notification has been duly published"
"as  prescribed 
in  Section  4  of  the  Ordinance,  and  that  the  relevant"
"statutory prerequisites have been complied with."

in 
respect  of

"Kachcheris and several courts and beating of tom-tom on or near the land"

"requiring  them  to  prove  the  alleged  non-compliance  with  the  statutory"
