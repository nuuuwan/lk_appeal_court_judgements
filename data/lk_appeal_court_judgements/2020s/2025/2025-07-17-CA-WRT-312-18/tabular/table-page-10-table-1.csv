"strong and convincing evidence in support of the alleged non-compliance."
"I am of the view that the contents of the above affidavits do not satisfy"
"such an onus. The declarant of the affidavit marked P15(A) stated that he,"
"as a government servant, was unaware that any notice was published in"
"any Gazette in 1966 or 1967. It is observed that even some of the other"
"declarants  of  the  respective  affidavits  were  not  notified  of  the  notice"
"published 
in  the  Gazette.  However,  the  publication  of  the 
impugned"
"Gazette 
is  not  disputed  by  the  Petitioners.  Accordingly, 
ignorance  or"
"failure  of  the  Petitioner  to  take  notice  of  the  relevant  publications  of"
"notice  cannot  be  considered  as  procedural  defects.In  view  of 
the"
"illustration  (d)  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  and 
in  the  absence  of  any"
"cogent  evidence  produced  by  the  Petitioners  to  prove  that  said  official"
"acts have not been regularly performed, I am of the view that this is a fit"
"case to adopt the said presumption under Section 114."
"Owing to the foregoing reasons, this Court could arrive at the inference"
"that all procedures have been duly complied with in the usual manner as"
"prescribed by the maxim omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter acta esse"
"(all  things  are  presumed  to  have  been  done  correctly  and  solemnly),"
"which  covers  generally  all  official  acts.  Therefore,  this  Court  is  satisfied"
"that the relevant statutory procedural steps were duly followed during the"
"publication  of  the  settlement  notice.  I  am  also  mindful  of  the  learned"
"DSG’s attempts during his oral submissions to submit the original record"
"containing  documents  confirming 
the  displacing  of 
the  notice 
in  a"
"conspicuous  place  and  the  beating  of 
‘tom  toms’.  However,  such  an"
"attempt  was  prevented  by 
the 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the"
"Petitioners 
stating 
that 
the  Petitioners  were  not 
given 
any  prior"
"reasonable opportunity to peruse such records as it was not produced to"
"the  Court  at 
the  appropriate  stage.  Hence, 
this  Court  had  not  the"
"opportunity to peruse such documents."
"Delay/Laches"
"The  Respondents 
further  claim 
that 
the 
instant  application  of 
the"
"Petitioner 
is  a  belated  one.  The  Petitioners  challenge  the  settlement"
"notice 
issued  under  Section  4  of 
the 
Land  Settlement  Ordinance"
"published in the Gazette No.14733 dated 27.09.1966, after more than 52"
