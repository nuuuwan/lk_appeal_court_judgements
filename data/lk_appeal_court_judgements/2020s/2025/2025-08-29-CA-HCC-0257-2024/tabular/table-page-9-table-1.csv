"29. Therefore, in my considered view, the Court ought not to impose suspended sentences on"
"first offenders, save where compelling mitigating circumstances exist, such as ignorance,"
"negligence, or a failure to appreciate the gravity of the offence by reason of tender age, which"
"would   justify   and   inspire   confidence   in   the   Court   to   exercise   leniency.   In   this   case,   the"
"aggravating factors clearly outweigh the mitigating ones."
"30. In the instant case, the appellant was serving in the Sri Lanka Army at the time of committing"
"the offence. Accordingly, having undergone military training, he was expected to conduct"
"himself with greater responsibility and discipline than an ordinary person."
"31. Having   considered   the   foregoing,   I   find   no   justification   to   extend   leniency   towards   the"
"appellant, particularly in view of the brutality exhibited in the commission of the crime."
"32. The  appellant  was  indeed  fortunate  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge proceeded  under"
"section  297  of  the  Penal  Code,  despite  overwhelming  evidence indicating a premeditated"
"attack."
"33. Therefore, I see no mitigating factors in the present case in favor of the appellant and hence,"
"see no reasons to disagree with the appropriateness of the sentence imposed by the learned"
"High Court Judge."
"34. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal.  The  prison  term  shall  run  from the date of conviction,"
"namely 31 July 2024."
