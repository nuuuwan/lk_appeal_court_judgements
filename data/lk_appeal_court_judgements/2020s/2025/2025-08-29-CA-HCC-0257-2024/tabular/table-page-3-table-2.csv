"","Furthermore, 
the 
learned  High  Court 
Judge 
did 
not 
provide 
any 
reasons 
for"
"","imposing a sentence of 18 yearsâ€™ rigorous imprisonment along with the fine."
"5.","Therefore,  I  shall  consider  whether  any  mitigating  factors  exist,  taking  into  account the"
"","facts of the case, particularly the attendant circumstances, the ages of both the victim  and"
"","the  appellant,  and,  more  importantly,  the  modus  operandi  of  the  crime, along  with other"
"","relevant considerations."
"6.","It is undisputed that the appellant stabbed the deceased, who later succumbed to her injuries"
"","at  the  Gampaha  Hospital.  The  evidence  establishes  that  the  appellant  and the  deceased"
"","were 
engaged 
in 
conversation 
shortly 
before 
the 
incident. 
In 
his   testimony, 
the"
"","appellant admitted that he had purchased a knife on his way to meet the deceased, claiming"
"","it was for self-defence as he believed certain persons were waiting to assault him, a claim I"
"","am not inclined to accept for the reasons mentioned below."
