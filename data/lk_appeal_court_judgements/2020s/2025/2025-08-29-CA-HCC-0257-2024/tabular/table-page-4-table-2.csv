"considered  in 
 determining the 
 sentence   on  an  accused  person  in  a crime   against   a"
"woman as follows:"
"In  recent  years,  the  rising  crime  rate-particularly  violent  crime  against"
"women  has  made  the  criminal  sentencing  by  the  courts  a  subject  of  concern."
"Today 
there 
are 
admitted 
disparities. 
Some 
criminals 
get 
very 
harsh"
"sentences  while  many  receive  grossly  different  sentence 
for  an  essentially"
"equivalent 
crime  and  a 
shockingly 
large  number 
even  go  unpunished,"
"thereby  encouraging  the  criminal  and  in  the  ultimate  making  justice  suffer by"
"weakening  the  system's  credibility.  Of  course,  it  is  not  possible  to  lay down"
"any  cut  and  dry  formula  relating  to  imposition  of  sentence  but  the object of"
"sentencing  should  be  to  see  that  the  crime  does  not go  unpunished and  the"
"victim  of  crime  as  also  the  society  has  the  satisfaction  that  justice has  been"
"done 
to 
it. 
In 
imposing  sentences, 
in 
the  absence  of  specific legislation,"
"Judges  must  consider  variety  of 
factors  and  after  considering   all 
those"
"factors 
and 
taking 
an 
over-all 
view 
of 
the 
situation, 
impose   sentence"
"which  they  consider  to  be  an  appropriate  one.  Aggravating  factors cannot  be"
"ignored  and  similarly  mitigating  circumstances  have  also 
to  be   taken   into"
"consideration."
"In  our  opinion, 
the  measure  of  punishment 
in  a  given  case  must  depend"
"upon 
the  atrocity  of 
the 
crime; 
the 
conduct  of 
the 
criminal  and 
the"
"defenceless  and  unprotected  state  of 
the  victim.  Imposition  of  appropriate"
"punishment  is  the  manner  in  which  the  courts  respond  to  the  society's  cry for"
"justice against the criminals. Justice demands that courts should impose"
