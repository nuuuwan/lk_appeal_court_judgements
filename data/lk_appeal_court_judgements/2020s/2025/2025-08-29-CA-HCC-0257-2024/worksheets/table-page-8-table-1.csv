"23. After  the  deceased  was  stabbed  in  the  abdomen,  she  bent  over.  The  appellant  then"
"stabbed  h e r   a  second 
time 
in 
the  back,  a  fact 
that  was  confirmed  by  medical"
"evidence."
"24. This offense was not only   inhuman and barbaric   but also a ruthless crime committed in"
"broad daylight. It took the life of a young, unarmed, and helpless schoolgirl. The autopsy"
"report details the injuries the appellant inflicted upon the deceased."
"25. It's important to stress that the deceased suffered her fatal injuries while speaking with the"
"appellant,  with  whom  she  was  having  an  affair.  There's  no  evidence  that the  deceased"
"was  ever  aggressive  toward  the  appellant  on  that  day. The  appellant's horrifying  cruelty"
"toward 
the 
teenage  schoolgirl 
is  especially  shocking  when considering the eyewitness"
"accounts of the tragic incident."
"26. The only mitigating  factors  in  this  case   are  the  appellant’s  tender  age,  being 21  years at"
"the  time  of  the  offence,  and  the  absence  of  any  previous  convictions. The  court  must"
"carefully balance these considerations, taking into account the victim’s suffering as well as"
"the broader message the sentence conveys to the society."
"27. The   Court would fail in its duty   if it did not give an appropriate punishment for a crime"
"committed  against  both  the  individual  victim  and  the  society.  It  is  my  view,  that  the"
"punishment for a crime should be based on how severe   it was, the criminal's actions, and"
"the  victim's  vulnerability.  When  courts 
impose  an  appropriate  punishment, 
they   are"
"responding   to  society’s  demand  for
  justice.
  The  punishment  should  fit 
the  crime,"
"showing  the  public’s  disgust  with  the  act.  Courts  must  consider  the  rights  of  the victim"
"and  society,  not  just  the  criminal,  when  deciding  on  a  punishment.  At  the same  time,"
"court  shall  not  lose  the  sight  of  its  duty  to  punish  crimes  appropriately,   as   they  are"
"committed against society as a whole, not just the individual victim."
"28. I may also observe that the practice of imposing suspended sentences on first offenders"
"risks setting a bad precedent and it would encourage individuals to commit serious offences"
"once in their lifetime under the mistaken belief that, as first offenders, they would escape"
"custodial   imprisonment.   The   inevitable   consequence   would   be   a   society   increasingly"
"permeated   with   crime.   Courts   must   therefore   be   vigilant   to   guard   against   such   a"
"phenomenon, which is almost certain to occur if suspended terms are routinely granted to"
"first offenders."
