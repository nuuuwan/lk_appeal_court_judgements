"","accused–appellant 
(hereinafter  “the  appellant”)

"3.","At the time of the incident, the deceased was a student of Kotadeniyawa Vidyalaya and  was"
"","having  an  affair  with  the  appellant,  a  soldier  attached  to  the  Sri  Lanka Army.  Both  had"
"","attended 
the 
same 
school 
before 
completing 
their  O/L examinations. On the day of"
"","the incident,  the  appellant, who was on leave, came to the  Kotadeniyawa  bus  station  to"
"","meet  the  deceased. While  they were  talking,  the appellant  asked  her  to  go  with  him,  but"
"","she  refused.  In  response,  the  appellant threatened 
that  he  would  swallow  some 
tablets"
"","if  she  did  not  comply,  yet  the deceased still refused. Suddenly, the appellant pushed her"
"","against the closed doors of a nearby boutique, stabbed her, swallowed something, and then"
"","collapsed. The deceased  was  later  taken  to  hospital,  where  she  succumbed  to  her  injuries"
"","after several days."
"4.","The counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant had acted under grave and sudden"
"","provocation,  which  was  the  cumulative  effect  of  a  series  of  events  that  had   transpired"
"","between the deceased and the appellant. It was therefore argued that the sentence   imposed"
"","was excessive   and should  be reduced. It is noteworthy   that neither the appellant  nor the"
"","respondent filed written submissions in this appeal. When the"
