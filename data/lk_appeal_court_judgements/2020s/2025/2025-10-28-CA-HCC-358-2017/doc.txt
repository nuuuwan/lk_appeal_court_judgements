That in the course of the same transaction as above, the appellant

punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code.

Page 3 of 11

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the charges and sentenced the appellant to

death in respect of the first charge and a term of 10 year rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1000.00 with a term of 1 week in default

of payment of the fine in respect of the second charge.

3. Aggrieved by the conviction, the disputed judgment and the sentencing

order, the accused appellant has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. PW02 and PW01 are husband and wife. They are the parents of a child.

PW02 has been a teacher and PW01 has been the director of an

educational institute. The child has been of school going age.

5. In those circumstances, there had been no one in the house occupied by

PW02 and his family during the day on weekdays.

6. As such, the deceased has been employed as a caretaker. The deceased

had reported to work in the morning and left at the time PW02 returned

home with the child after school in the afternoon.

7. On May 11, 2005, PW02 along with the child has returned home in the

afternoon. On his return, he has observed that the house had been

ransacked by an unknown person/persons. The doors that were locked

broken open, and the lifeless body of the deceased lying on the floor of

the kitchen.

Page 4 of 11

8. Subsequent searches by PW01 and PW02 have revealed that some items

of jewelry and other belongings have been removed by the person or

persons who ransacked the house.

9. Following a complaint, an investigation has commenced and an item of

jewelry that had been removed from the cupboard it was stored in the

house, taken into custody from the possession of PW05, who had

allegedly purchased it from the appellant and another individual. This

item of jewelry has been identified by PW01, the person who possessed it

and marked පැ03.

Case of the appellant

10. The appellant asserts that he was approached by two individuals who

presented him with various items of jewelry and a camera. They have

sought his assistance in disposing of those items to help one of the

individual‟s sister secure funds to travel abroad. The appellant has

agreed to their request and received a payment of Rs. 2000.00 for the

assistance he provided.

Grounds of appeal

11. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Counsel for appellant

raised the following grounds of appeal,

i. The learned High Court Judge had arrived at a wrong

conclusion that the items of circumstantial evidence adduced

by the prosecution were sufficient to arrive at the one and

only inference that the accused appellant was the person who

had committed the murder and robbery.

Page 5 of 11

ii. The learned High Court Judge had allowed to place

inadmissible evidence, and the learned High Court Judge had

failed to comply with section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

iii. The learned High Court Judge had rejected the dock

statement on unreasonable grounds.

12. The item of jewelry marked as පැ03 has been confirmed as stolen from

the home of PW01 and PW02 on the day of the break in, specifically on

May 11, 2005. This item has been taken from the cupboard where the

valuables were stored. On the same day in the same incident, the

deceased has also been found smothered in the kitchen of the house.

13. In his testimony, PW05 has stated that on May 12, 2005, between 11.00

and 12.00 hours, the appellant along with another individual approached

him with an offer to sell various items, including jewelry. PW05 had

subsequently purchased those items.

14. Notably among the items bought has been the item of jewelry marked

පැ03, which PW05 has identified during the Court proceedings.

15. In those circumstances, applying the provisions in section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895 and the matters eluded in

illustration „A‟, the appellant being charged with murder and committing

robbery in the same transaction, the learned High Court Judge has

concluded that the recent unexplained possession of a stolen property

i.e. the item of jewelry marked පැ03 is presumptive evidence against the

appellant for the robbery charge and would similarly serve as evidence

against him for the murder charge.

Page 6 of 11

16. However, the Counsel for the appellant has raised concerns regarding the

prosecution‟s failure to establish through compelling evidence, the

appellant‟s recent and unexplained possession of the item of jewelry

marked as පැ03.

17. He has directed the Court‟s attention to the inconsistencies surrounding

the timing of the appellant‟s arrest and the recovery of the item of jewelry

from the possession of PW05 among other discrepancies. PW05, a

civilian and PW10, an investigator in their testimony has stated as

follows,

18. According to PW05, the appellant has sold several items, including the

item of jewelry marked පැ03 on May 12, 2005, between 11.00 and 12.00

hours.

19. The investigating officers have confronted PW05 approximately an hour

and a half later. At this time, the item of jewelry marked පැ03 has been

handed over to an investigating officer by PW05.

20. However, as per PW10, an investigating officer, it has been stated that he

alongside PW09, I.P. Ginage, the appellant and another individual visited

PW05‟s residence for the first time on May 12, 2005, at 23.05 hours.

Subsequently, an investigating officer has proceeded to record PW05‟s

statement at 23.15 hours on the same day.

21. PW09 has also been involved in the investigation of the incident referred

to in the charges. When the case went to trial, this officer had been

abroad, making it impossible to secure his attendance without significant

delay.

22. Consequently, the learned High Court Judge has ostensibly invoked the

provisions in section 32(2) of the Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895,

allowing the prosecution to submit his notes, made in the course of his

professional duty, from the information book maintained at the

designated police station as evidence. These notes had been accepted as

substantive evidence in the proceedings.

23. In his notes (written statement), PW09 has noted that the appellant was

arrested on May 12, 2005, at 19.05 hours.

24. Upon considering the testimonies of PW05, PW10 and the written

statements of PW09, it is evident that there are contradictions regarding

Page 10 of 11

the time of the appellant‟s arrest and the recovery of the item of jewelry

marked පැ03 from PW05‟s possession.

25. These inconsistencies not only raise doubts about the specific timeline

but also impact the credibility of the testimony provided by PW05. Since

the prosecution heavily relies on presumptive evidence to establish its

case, such discrepancies undermine the very foundation of the

prosecution‟s argument.

26. The integrity of witness testimonies is crucial in legal proceedings and

any conflict in evidence presented can lead to significant concerns about

reliability.

27. In this instance, the inconsistences in the timing surrounding the sale

and recovery of the item of jewelry marked පැ03 create uncertainty. Such

uncertainty casts a shadow over PW05‟s credibility and lead the Court to

question the overall validity of the prosecution‟s claims.

28. To build a strong case, it is essential for the prosecution to present clear

and consistent evidence. The reliance on presumptive evidence further

complicates matters; when the supporting testimony is contradictory, it

becomes increasingly challenging to establish guilt of the accused beyond

a reasonable doubt.

29. Therefore, these discrepancies are not merely trivial issues; they strike at

the core of the prosecution‟s case.

30. Presumptive evidence is indirect or circumstantial evidence that allows a

conclusion to be drawn about a fact based on the existence of other

related facts, rather than directly proving it.

Page 11 of 11

31. Though presumptive evidence is useful, it is also inherently fragile. To

act upon such evidence, it must meet the standard of certainty that

leaves no room for doubt. Therefore, it is crucial that this evidence

withstands vigorous scrutiny and maintains a high degree of reliability

before any action is taken based on such evidence.

32. Unfortunately, the presumptive evidence the prosecution relies on to

establish its case is lacking in such attributes.

33. In those circumstances, I am inclined to interfere with the conviction, the

disputed judgment and the sentencing order and I set aside the same

accordingly.

Appeal allowed.

I make no order regarding costs.

34. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to

the High Court of Galle for compliance.
