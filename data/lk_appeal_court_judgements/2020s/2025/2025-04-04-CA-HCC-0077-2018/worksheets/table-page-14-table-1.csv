"22. Due to the matters discussed above, it is the opinion of this Court that"
"the fourth ground of appeal urged by the appellant has merit. Hence, the"
"decision  of  this  Court  to  interfere  with  the  impugn  judgment  together"
"with the sentencing order. I accordingly set aside the conviction together"
"with  the  impugned  sentence  and  acquit  the  appellant  of  the  charges  in"
"the indictment."
