"Section 17(1) of the State Lands Ordinance provides as follows:"
"“
Where a Government Agent is of opinion that the grantee of any permit or license"
"has failed to observe any condition attached to any such permit or license, he may"
"cancel  such  permit  or 
license,  and  eject 
the  grantee 
in  accordance  with  the"
"procedure  prescribed  in  sections  106  to  128  of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance"
"which shall apply accordingly as though the grantee of a permit or license under this"
"Ordinance were a permit-holder under that Ordinance and as though the land which"
"is the subject-matter of a permit or license under this Ordinance were land alienated"
"by a permit issued under that Ordinance:..”"
"I
n the case of Kalu Banda v. Upali 1999 3 SLLR  391 at page 398, His Lordship Yapa, J."
"has stated;"
"“
An examination of the provisions referred to above would make it clear that before"
"a  cancellation  of  a 
lease  permit  or  an 
instrument  of  disposition,  a  particular"
"procedure has been clearly laid down in sections 106-128 of the Land Development"
"Ordinance.  Therefore, 
in 
terms  of  section  106 
(2)  of 
the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance the 2nd Respondent in this case was required by law to issue a notice to"
"the  Petitioner  intimating  to  him  that  his  lease  permit  would  be  cancelled  unless"
"sufficient cause to the contrary was shown.”."
"I
t is clear that with regard to the Lease bearing No 4/10/20592, there is a statutory"
"procedure to be followed and that the 1st to 4th Respondent have disregarded this."
"38. With  regard  to  the  Lease  Approval  bearing  No  4/10/20614,  it  is  not  stated  under"
"what 
legal  provision 
it  is 
issued.  Even 
if  there 
is  no  specific  statutory  provision"
"regarding cancelation of a Lease Approval, rules of natural Justice prevent the 1st to"
"4th Respondent from canceling this lease instrument without granting the Petitioners"
"and opportunity to be heard. Rules of natural justice dictate that that the party that"
"would be affected by the decision should be given a hearing before the decision is"
"taken. It is clear that 1st to 4th Respondents have violated a fundamental principle of"
"natural 
justice.  As  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  has  not  given  prior  notice  of  the"
"discussion  to  the  Petitioners  and  has  also  failed  to  give  them  a  hearing,  both"
"components of  Audi Alteram Partem rule has been violated.  Further, these actions"
"of the 1st to 4th Respondents are compounded by the fact that 5th Respondent who is"
"a  rival  for  the  claim  of  the  Petitioners  and  would  profit  by  the  cancelation  of  the"
"subject lease instruments had participated at the discussion."
"39. The  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectation  ensures  that  administrative  authorities  act"
"fairly  and  would  not  take  arbitrary  decisions.  It 
is  a  ground  for  judicial  review."
"Whether an expectation is legitimate is a question of fact. Legitimate expectation is"
