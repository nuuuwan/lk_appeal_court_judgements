"T
he  19th  Respondent  characterizes 
the  Petition  as  an  attempt

"O
n the merits, they  state that the interview process was  conducted in a"
"fair, transparent, and objective manner, the top three scoring candidates"
"were forwarded to the appointing authority in alphabetical order without"
"recommendation 
or 
ranking

and 
that 
the 
ultimate"
"appointment was made by the 1st Respondent Authority’s Board and the"

"T

"of 
interview  and  ranking,  but 
it  was  not  binding  on  the  appointing"
"authority 
in  determining 
final  selection.  They  also  submit 
that 
the"
"Petitioner’s  interpretation  of  the  SOR  as  requiring  strict  appointment"
"solely  based  on  interview  scores  is  misplaced  and  inconsistent  with  the"
"discretion conferred under Section 12 of the RDA Act."
