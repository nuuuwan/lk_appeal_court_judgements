"account of the delay in filing, Futility, as the Petitioner’s claims are moot"
"and 
ineffective,  Material  non-disclosure,  alleging  suppression  and/or"
"misrepresentation of material facts, and that the Petitioner has no locus"
"to invoke the Court’s discretionary jurisdiction."
"W
ithout prejudice to the preliminary objections, these Respondents deny"
"the  substantive  claims  and  maintain  that  the  appointment  of  the  19th"
"Respondent was made in good  faith and within the statutory framework"
"provided under Section 12 of the Road Development Authority Act No. 73"
"of  1981 
(as  amended), 
in

"23rd Respondent (Secretary to the Ministry), the Board took into account"
"not  only 
the 
interview  marks  but  also

"and  that  the  SOR  is  merely  administrative,  and  cannot  override  the"
