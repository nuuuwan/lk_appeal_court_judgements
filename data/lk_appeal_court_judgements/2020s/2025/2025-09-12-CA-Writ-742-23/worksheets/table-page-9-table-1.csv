"The successor to the Grant"
"A
s  per  the  document  submitted  to  Court  the  late  Podimanika  did  not  nominate  a"
"successor  to  the  Grant.  It  was  the  contention  of  the  Petitionerâ€™s  Counsel  that  in  the"
"absence  of  a  nomination  then  again,  the  successor  must  be  named  pursuant  to  the"
"prescribed order in the Third Schedule to the Land Development Ordinance. However,"
"the learned Counsel appearing for the 7th Respondent argued that the succession to the"
"Grant  in  this  instance  will  not  fall  within  the Third  Schedule  as  the  Grantee  did  not"
"nominate a specific successor, she had already nominated a successor to the land when"
"she was the Permit holder."
