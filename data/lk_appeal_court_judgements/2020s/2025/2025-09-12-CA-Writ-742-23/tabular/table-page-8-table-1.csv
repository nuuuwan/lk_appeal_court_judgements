"transfer of life interest is wrong and therefore, the Grant issued to Podimenika too is"
"illegal."
"A
 similar line of thinking is visible in the Commissioner’s letter dated 04.01.2021 (P9)"
"addressed  to  the  Divisional  Secretary.  Be  that  as  it  may,  on  the  demise  of  the  said"
"Karunaratne the Divisional Secretary had registered the Petitioner as the successor to"
"the Grant (P10)."
"I
t  was  the  Commissioner’s  opinion  that  on  the  demise  of  Bramphy  Singho,  in  the"
"absence of a nomination the succession should have been devolved on the eldest son,"
"Karunaratne.  The  letter  marked  as  P8,  goes  on  to  state  that  as  Wijeratne  had  been"
"nominated  as  the  successors  by  Podimenika  who  had  only  the  life  interest,  the  said"
"nomination of Wijeratne too is faulty. The learned President’s Counsel appearing for the"
"Petitioner  heavily  relied  on  this  document  to  assert  the  Petitioner’s  title.  It  was  the"
"contention  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that  in  view  of  the  findings  of  the"
"Commissioner of Lands, the Divisional Secretary had correctly come to the conclusion"
"to  name  the  eldest  son  Karuaratne  as  the  successor  and  hence  on  the  demise  of"
"Karunaratne the Petitioner was named as the successor."
"I
 am not inclined to accede to the contention of the learned President’s Counsel as in"
"my view the Commissioner’s findings in P8 are not legally tenable. In arriving at his"
"decision, the Commissioner of Lands had not considered the fact that at the time the"
"original  Permit  was  issued  Bramphy  Singho  had  been  dead. Accordingly,  a  Permit"
"cannot be issued to a deceased individual. Hence, the authorities had correctly issued it"
"to the other occupier of the land, Bramphy Singho’s wife. She obtained the Permit not"
"in the capacity of the widow of Bramphy Singho but on her own accord. Hence, the"
"Permit was never issued to  Bramphy Singho but the Permit holder  was Podimanika."
"Therefore, Podimanika did not accede to the Grant as the widow of Bramphy Singho"
"and  received  only  life  interest,  but  she  got  title  for  herself  as  the  Permit  holder."
"Subsequent to her becoming the Permit holder she had decided not to confer it to her"
"eldest son but to another son, namely, Wijeratne. This has been duly done and registered."
"Thereafter, the Permit holder was given a Grant for the same land marked as P7. This"
"Grant has not been revoked and therefore it is valid. In any event, none of the parties"
"challenged the validity of the Grant, nor the issuance of the Permit to Podimanika or the"
"nominee she made during her lifetime. Thus, the valid title holder to the land depicted"
"in the Grant becomes Podimenika."
