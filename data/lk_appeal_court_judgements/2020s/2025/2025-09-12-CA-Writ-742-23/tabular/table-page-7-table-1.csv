"W
 
ith the demise of Wijeratne, the 7th Respondent was registered as the successor and"
"P5 was issued. The Petitioner’s father Karunaratne being the eldest son contested the"
"issuance of P5 whereby on 06.03.2002, the 7th Respondent had been registered as the"
"successor to Wijeratne."
"I
n  accepting  the  said  contention  of  the  eldest  son  of  Podimanika,  the  Divisional"
"Secretary had registered the said Karunaratne as the successor to the land by document"
"marked as P7(a). Interestingly, this has been done on 26.07.2002 which is four months"
"after  registering  the  7th  Respondent  as  the  successor  to  the  land. At  this  stage,  it  is"
"pertinent to note that none of the parties had submitted any documents to demonstrate"
"that prior to issuing P7(a) the authorities had cancelled the document marked as P5. It"
"is also contended by the Respondents that there had been no inquiry conducted by the"
"Divisional Secretary prior to taking the decision to cancel P5, which had been issued to"
"the 7th Respondent."
"It was argued by both parties that there had been several Court cases pertaining to the"
"succession  of  the  land  between  the  said  Karunaratne  and  the  7th  Respondent. As  the"
"issue before this Court is not the said litigation nor the outcome of the said litigation, I"
"will  not  be  addressing  the  facts  and  circumstances  pertaining  to  the  said  litigation."
"However, it is sufficed to state that the dispute between the Petitioner’s father and the"
"7th Respondent had continued unabated. With the demise of the Petitioner’s father, the"
"Petitioner has succeeded to the title."
"I
t  appears  that  on  receiving  the  claim  of  Karunaratne,  the  Commissioner  of  Lands"
"(herein sometimes referred to as ‘Commissioner’) had held an inquiry and subsequent"
"to the said inquiry the Commissioner had sent a letter dated 22.10.2003 to the Divisional"
"Secretary. The said letter is marked as P8."
"The letter P8"
"I
t appears the dispute between the parties had commenced as a result of the letter marked"
"as P8. A plain reading of the said letter demonstrates that the Commissioner of Lands"
"had gone on the premise that the original Permit had been issued to Bramphy Singho"
"and on the demise of the said Bramphy Singho, the life interest had been given to his"
"widow Podimenika. The Commissioner has further come to the conclusion that the said"
