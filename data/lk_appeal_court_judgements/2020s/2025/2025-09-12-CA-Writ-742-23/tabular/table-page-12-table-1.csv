"position to impugn or contradict the contents of the letter marked as P14. The said letter"
"clearly states that Bramphy Singho had died on 04.04.1992 and the original Permit had"
"been issued only on 20.01.1993, which is more than a year after the demise of Bramphy"
"Singho. If the Petitioner’s stance was that the wife of Bramphy Singho, Podimanika was"
"not the original Permit holder it could have easily been established by producing the"
"Bramphy Singho’s death certificate and established that the said Podimanika succeeded"
"to the Permit only in the capacity of the widow. The Petitioner has failed to do so. It is"
"trite law that in a Writ Application the burden of proof lies with the Petitioner."
