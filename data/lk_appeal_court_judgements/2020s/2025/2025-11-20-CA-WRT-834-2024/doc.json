  "keywords": "Partition action instituted in the District Court of Tangalle in respect of land situated within the same jurisdiction. Allegations that the entire land has not been depicted in the preliminary plan.

Held \u2013 the writ court cannot intervene into the matter since it affects the Judicial power of the parties since only the District Court of Tangalle has the jurisdiction in terms of Section 3(2) of the Partition Law, Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the Constitution. Though the writ court is empowered to issue writs, when there is no allegation of irrationality, act of ultra vires affecting the rights of the parties, or acted without evidence, no writ lies.",
