"the same. The change of the operative date was by an amendment and"
"not interpretation."
"35. In  this  context,  one  should  be  mindful  of  the  effect  and  import  of  a"
"change  brought  about  to  a  provision  by  statute  as  opposed  to  a"
"subsequent change of interpretation of a provision by a binding Court of"
"law.  When  it  involves  a  different  interpretation  of  the  same  provision,"
"then  the  subsequent  interpretation  will  determine  as  to  how  the  law"
"ought to have been. Therefore, a subsequent interpretation may affect a"
"previous decision made on the interpretation as it was then. As opposed"
"to that, if the substantive provision of law is amended, then its operation,"
"unless expressly so provided, will be prospective. Section 53 prior to the"
"amendment reads as follows: “Sentence of death shall not be pronounced"
"on  or  recorded  against  any  person  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the  court,  is"
"under the age of eighteen years; but, in lieu of that punishment, the court"
"shall  sentence  such  person 
to  be  detained  during 
the  President’s"
"pleasure.”  It  is  clear  on  a  plain  reading  that  the  relevant  age  of  the"
"offender 
is  at  the  time  of 
imposition  of  the  sentence  and  not  the"
"commission of the offence. However, upon the Amendment, Section 53"
"(1) was enacted and clearly states that the sentence of death shall not"
"be pronounced against a person who was under 18 years of age at the"
"time  of  the  commission  of  the  offence.  The  change  as  to  the  point  at"
"which the accused ought to be less that 18 years, was thus changed by"
"a  statutory  amendment. 
In 
the  absence  of  any  provision 
for 
its"
"retrospective effect, the application of Section 53 upon the Amendment"
"shall  be  prospective.  This  is  the  rationale  and  the  reasoning  of  the"
"Arachchige 
Anil 
Priyankara 
vs. 
decision 
in  Warnakulasuriya"
"Attorney General (supra). Accordingly the submission made on behalf"
"of the appellant based on the application of Section 53 is misconceived."
"36. In 
the  above  circumstance, 
I  see  no  merit 
in 
this  appeal,  and"
"accordingly, the appeal is dismissed."
