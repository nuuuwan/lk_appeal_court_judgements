"HCC-0315-16"
"causes  a  girl  of  6  years  to  be  put  into  a  canal  with  water.  The  law"
"presumes that persons intend the natural and probable consequences"
"of their conduct. Accordingly, there is a strong and irresistible inference"
"that the appellant acted with a murderous intention when the girl was"
"put  into  the  water.  To  cap  it  all,  the  appellant  upon  returning  home"
"makes  a  false  denial  of  any  knowledge  as  to  the  whereabouts  of  the"
"victim. In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the utterance of any"
"falsehood,  in  or  outside  Court,  would  amount  to  corroboration  of  the"
"prosecution case based on circumstantial evidence."
