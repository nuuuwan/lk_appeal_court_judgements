"the appellant had been 17 years of age as at the date of offence. So, to"
"that  extent,  the  issue  considered  and  the  relevant  facts  are  almost"
"identical. His Lordship, upon considering these issues, held that:"
"“An accused who had been convicted for murder before 2021 must"
"be sentenced to death if he was not under 18 years of age at the"
"date  of  sentencing  him.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  no"
"discretion to impose a lesser sentence for murder as he was bound"
"to impose the death sentence on the accused-appellant who had"
"been convicted for murder.”"
