JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Registered Owner -Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”)

instituted this appeal against the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Central Province holding in Kandy in case No. 66/2016 dated

21.10.2020 where the Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned

Magistrate of Kandy bearing No. 87998 dated 10.10.2018 where the Learned Magistrate

has confiscated a lorry bearing No. SP LB 3340 consequent to an inquiry.

The accused, Walihena Hewage Samantha, was found guilty of the offence of illegally

transporting eight Mahogany logs, in violation of Section 25(2) read with Section 40 of Act

No. 65 of 2009 of the Forest Ordinance. Following the conviction, the Learned Magistrate

proceeded to conduct an inquiry regarding the vehicle that had been seized for its

involvement in the unlawful transportation of the Mahogany logs, in contravention of the

Forest Ordinance.

The Learned Magistrate, acting in terms of Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance, allowed

the owner to show cause as to why the lorry should not be confiscated.

In an inquiry of this nature, it is incumbent upon the owner of the vehicle to demonstrate

to the Court that all reasonable precautions were taken to prevent the vehicle's use in the

commission of the offence. The amendment to Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance by Act

No. 65 of 2009 provides that,

Page 4 of 8

“Where any person is convicted of a forest offence.

(A) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect

of which the offence has been committed, and

(B) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing such

offence

Shall, in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be confiscated

by order of the convicting magistrate.

Provided that where the owner of the vehicle is a third party, no order of

confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction shall be made if

such owner proves to the satisfaction of the court that she had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and

machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the offence.’

This principle is followed by the Her Ladyship Justice K. K. Wickremasinghe in

Karunapedi Durayalage Sumana Kumara v. Officer-in- Charge, Police Station,

Narammala and others has stated:

“Further, it is imperative to note that as per, section 40 of the Forest Ordinance

(amendment Act No. 65 of 2009), it is mandatory to prove preventive measures

taken by the vehicle owner in question. Even thoughthe previous law allowed a

vehicle owner to prove either he took precautions or he had no knowledge of an

offence being committed, the amended section 40 only focuses on the precautions

taken by a vehicle owner in question. Therefore, I am of the view that mere denial

of the knowledge about an offence being committed or denial of t he control over

his own vehicle is not sufficient for a vehicle owner to discharge the burden cast on

him, under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended).”

Iddawala J in Rajapakse Dewage Asanga Kumara Chandrasena v. Officer- in- Charge,

Police Station, Katugasthota and another has stated;

“By the amendment to the Forest Ordinance in 2009 by Act No. 65 of 2009, the

legislature has determined that having no knowledge of the offence being

committed is a not good enough a reason anymore to claim a confiscated vehicle.

Therefore, Counsel has to be mindful in citing cases decided prior to the 2009

Page 5 of 8

amendment or cases decided under other legislations. The judiciary has to only

discern whether the claimant being the owner of the vehicle, had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence. This

entails positive actions on the part of the owner and not claiming mere ignorance.”

The aforementioned cases underscore the necessity for the vehicle owner to demonstrate

that he implemented adequate preventive measures to ensure the vehicle was not

involved in any unlawful activities. It must be shown that the owner issued clear and

explicit instructions to the driver, prohibiting the use of the vehicle for unauthorized or

illegal purposes. Accordingly, the owner is required to establish that all reasonable

precautions were taken to prevent such misconduct.

During the inquiry, the owner testified that he had entrusted the vehicle to the accused

to operate as a driver for a payment of Rs. 1,500. He further stated that after the vehicle

was handed over to the wife of the owner, she informed him about its status. The owner

also mentioned that he had been actively searching for the vehicle to the best of his ability.

During the cross examination the Appellant has asserted that he is a Navi Officer and

that he was unaware that, on the date of the offence—04.07.2016—the driver intended to

transport logs. He emphasized that had he known about such an intention, he would not

have permitted the use of the lorry.

We are mindful that, under prevailing legal standards, the courts require the owner to

demonstrate—on the balance of probabilities—that appropriate precautions were taken

to prevent the commission of the offence. In our view, the Learned Magistrate correctly

arrived at the conclusion with respect to Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance. It is

incumbent upon the Magistrate to assess whether the owner has sufficiently established,

on a balance of probabilities, that she exercised the necessary precautions.

Upon a comprehensive review of the evidence presented before the Learned Magistrate,

we are not satisfied that the owner of the vehicle has demonstrated that he took

appropriate and reasonable precautionary measures to prevent the vehicle from being

used in the commission of an offence.

We note with concern that the wife of the vehicle owner did not provide evidence at the

inquiry. Her testimony would have been pivotal in determining whether adequate

precautions were taken to prevent the commission of the offence. While the owner, being

a Naval Officer, was unable to monitor the vehicle's movements due to professional

constraints, it is evident that his wife had direct control over the vehicle. Therefore, she

would have been the more appropriate person to clarify the preventive measures, if any,

that were in place.

We note that the Learned Magistrate rightly observed that, although the appellant

claimed to have taken all necessary precautions, this assertion remained unsubstantiated

and was not proven on the balance of probabilities

For the reasons stated above, we respectfully submit that the Learned Magistrate has

rightly reached the conclusion and made the appropriate order.

Upon perusal of the order made by the Learned High Court Judge on 21.10.2020, it is

evident that the revision application was rejected on the grounds that the Learned

Magistrate had duly considered all the precautionary measures claimed to have been

taken by the Appellant. It is relevant to reproduce that portion of the said order.

We hold that the Learned High Court Judge of Province correctly arrived at the conclusion

considering the precautions that was taken by the Appellant and evaluating the order of

the Learned Magistrate.

Page 7 of 8

We are not satisfied that the owner has demonstrated that he has not took all necessary

steps to implement precautionary measures to prevent any illegal activity.

In light of the foregoing facts, I am of the considered opinion that the confiscation of the

vehicle is justified. Accordingly, I uphold the order of the Learned High Court Judge.

Having regard to the above circumstances, we find no reason to interfere with the order

of the Learned High Court Judge dated 21.10.2020 and the order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 10.10.2018.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed and we order no cost.

We direct the Registrar to communicate this order to the Magistrate Court of Kandy for

further compliance.
