By Order dated 26-04-2024, the Learned District Judge of Mount Lavinia refused the petitioner\u2019s show cause, and the decree nisi was made absolute. A copy of that order is annexed as P19. Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner preferred a revision application bearing no. WP/HCCA/MT/06/2024/RA to the Civil Appellate High Court of Mount Lavinia. Copy of the petition dated 14-05-2024 in that revision application produced as P20. A copy of the objections produced as P21. The Civil Appellate High Court of Mount Lavinia, by judgment dated 04-09-2024, dismissed the petitioner\u2019s application and affirmed the District Court Order. A copy of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated September 4, 2024, is annexed as P24. The petitioner filed this application before this court on September 9, 2024, seeking the reliefs prayed for in the petition. The plaintiff-respondent filed objections to the petitioner\u2019s application. The respondent has taken up the following objections:",
