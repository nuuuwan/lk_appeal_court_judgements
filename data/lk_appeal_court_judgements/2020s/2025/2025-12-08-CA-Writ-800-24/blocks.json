Even though the Petitioner did not make submissions on the ground of estoppel, the Court observes that the Petitioner had pleaded that the 4th Respondent is estopped from subsequently lodging a complaint with the 2nd Respondent as he had sought the same reliefs from the Labour Tribunal and has withdrawn the said application. However, this Court observes that as per X3, the complaint made against the Jayasinghe Industries, the partnership, is for non-payment of EPF, while in the application filed before the Labour Tribunal, the 4th Respondent, had canvassed his termination and had sought for arrears in wages. Hence, the two applications filed in two different entities (the Labour Tribunal and the Assistant Commissioner of Labour) are different in nature. Therefore, the Petitioner\u2019s objection based on estoppel cannot be sustained.",

I cannot find any ground on which the Petitioner is impugning the decision marked as X6 pleaded in the Petition. In my view, the Petitioner has failed to plead that the decision marked as X6 is bad in law. It is not challenged on the grounds of being ultra vires or on unreasonableness. Hence, in the absence of any ground pleaded and any particular ground established, in my view, the Petitioner\u2019s Petition has to fail.",

    "text": "However, the Petition is not filed by the partners of the partnership but only by a single partner. There is no material to demonstrate that the other partners had authorized the Petitioner to file this Writ Application on behalf of the partnership. Hence, in my view, the partners of the partnership against whom the impugned order X6 is made are necessary parties to this Application. The Petitioner has not pleaded any ground as to why he failed or omitted to make the other partners a party to this Application. It is trite law that failure to make necessary parties are fatal to a Writ Application. In coming to this conclusion, I am guided by Rawaya Publishers v. Wijedasa Rajapakse (2001) 3 SLR 213 and Hatton National Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Labour and others CA Writ 457/2011 decided on 31.01.2020.",
