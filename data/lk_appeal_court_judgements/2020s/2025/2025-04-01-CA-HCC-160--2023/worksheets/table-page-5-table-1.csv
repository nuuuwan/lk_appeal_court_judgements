"State  (which  are  synonymous)  outweighs  the  previous  good  character,"
"antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must prevail.”"
"This dictum was followed by His Lordship Gunasekara J in The Attorney General"
"v. Mendis 1995 1 SLR 138 and held that;"
"“In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea,"
"or after trial, the Trial Judge has a difficult function to perform. That is to"
"decide  what  sentence  is  to  be  imposed  on  the  accused  who  has  been"
"convicted. In doing so he has to consider the point of view of the accused on"
"the one hand and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge"
"must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the manner"
"in which it  has been committed the  machinations  and  the  manipulations"

"such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which it"
"has  been  committed,  the  persons  who  are  affected  by  such  crime,  the"

"any other person, be it counsel or accused or any other person. Whilst plea"
"bargaining  is  permissible  in  our  view,  sentence  bargaining  should  not  be"
"encouraged at all and must be frowned upon.”"

"“We  are  in  agreement  with  the  observations  of  Basnayake,  A.C.J.  that"
"whilst  ""the  reformation  of  the  criminal  though  no  doubt  is  an  important"
"consideration  in  assessing  the  punishment  that  should  be  passed  on  an"
"offender, where the public interest or the welfare of the state outweighs the"
"previous  good  character,  antecedents  and  age  of  the  offender,  that  public"
"interest must prevail."" Having regard to the manner and the ingenuity with"
