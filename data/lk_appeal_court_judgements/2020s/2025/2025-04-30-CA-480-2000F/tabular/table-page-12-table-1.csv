"rent  to  the  Plaintiff  from  1970  to  1985.  No  written  agreement  or  any"
"other  documentary  proof  has  been  placed  before  the  Court  to  support"
"the position that the Defendant entered the premises in occupation as a"
"tenant in 1970. The Plaintiff conceded the fact that he had let another of"
"his  houses 
to  a 
relative  of 
the  Defendant  named  Harriet 
in  cross-"
"examination.  Although  the  Defendant  submitted  that  the  above  oral"
"testimony  leads  to  the  assumption  that  the  subject  premises  must  also"
"have been let to the Defendant on rent as opposed to the alleged leave"
"and 
license  granted  by  the  Plaintiff,  this  Court  cannot  accept  such  a"
"submission. 
  As  such  an  acceptance 
is  against  the  established 
legal"
"principles on the admissibility of evidence. Therefore, the inference that"
"could be arrived at based on the evidence available is that the Defendant"
"came  into  the  possession  of  the  subject  premises  as  a  licensee  of  the"
"Plaintiff."
"The Defendant had made an application to the Commissioner of National"
"Housing to purchase the land by document marked V1 on 05.04.1982. As"
"per  the  document  V3,  it  is  evident  that  the  Commissioner  rejected  the"
"above application on 13.07.1984, as the Plaintiff was not willing to sell the"
"property. Accordingly, the Defendant had taken steps to deposit rent only"
"after he failed to purchase the property. Furthermore, it was revealed in"
"the  evidence  given  by  Gunadasa  Perera,  Revenue  Officer, 
that 
the"
"Defendant  started 
to  deposit 
rent 
in 
the  Town  Council 
from  1985."
"Therefore, the inference that could be arrived at from the above evidence"
"and the circumstances is that the Defendant had started to deposit rent"
"only from 1985."
"Then  a  question  arises:  Would  the  depositing  of  rent  from  1985  by  the"
"Defendant  amount 
to  a 
tenancy  agreement  between  Plaintiff  and"
"Defendant? As the evidence suggests that the Defendant had come into"
"occupation of the premises as a licensee of the Plaintiff, mere depositing"
"of  rent  in  the  Town  Council  shall  not  give  rise  to  a  tenancy  agreement"
"between  the  parties.  Because  meeting  of  the  minds  of  the  parties  is  an"
"essential component  for a contract to  be constituted in law. There is no"
"evidence  to  support  that  the  Plaintiff  agreed  to  enter  into  such  a  rent"
"agreement. It is further observed that there is no evidence to the extent"
