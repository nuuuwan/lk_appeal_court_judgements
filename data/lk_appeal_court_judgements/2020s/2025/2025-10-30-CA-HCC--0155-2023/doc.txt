committed an offence punishable under section 25(1) read with

Rs. 140,000.00 using a cheque No. 260965, from Account No

0073776069, which was a closed account at that time, committed an

offence punishable under section 25(1) read with section 25(1)(b) of

the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No 02 of 1990 as amended

by the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No 09 of 1994.

Before commencement of the trial, the Counsel for the Respondent had

raised the preliminary objection against the maintainability of the 2nd to 22nd

charge on the basis that the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No 02 of

1990 as amended, conferred Jurisdiction in the Magistrate Court in respect

of offences committed under Section 25(1) of the said Act and as such the

Hon. Attorney General is not empowered to forward an indictment to the

High Court including charges in terms of Section 25 (1) of the Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990.

After the submissions by the Counsels for the Respondent and the

prosecution, the Learned High Court Judge had accepted the preliminary

objection raised by the Respondent and rejected the stance of the

prosecution regarding the 2nd to 22nd counts in the indictment and ordered

only to proceed with the 1st count of the indictment.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo,

the Appellant had filed this instant Appeal to set aside the order of the

CA/HCC/0155/23

10 | P a g e

learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 27.04.2023. The Appellant had

cited the following grounds of appeal in support of this application.

a. The learned High Court Judge has erred in determining that the

charges under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of

1994 as amended by the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No.09

of 1994, can only be filed at the Magistrate Court and that the Hon.

Attorney General should not have filed charges under the said Act to

the High Court through an indictment.

b. The learned High Court Judge has misled himself in determining that

Section 393(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not given any

power to the Attorney General to override the provisions of the Special

Provisions Act.

c. The learned High Court Judge has erroneously determined that the

Code of Criminal Procedure is not applicable to the Acts which have

specific provisions with regard to filing of charges for the offences

recognized under the Special Provisions Act and that Section 393(7)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not applicable for the charges

filed under the Debt Recovery Act (Special Provisions) Act No.02 of

1990 as amended by the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No.

09 of 1994 at the High Court.

d. Citing the case of “Lanka Walltiles PLC v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue CA/TAX/0010/2015 and the exert of the Hansard of

the debate held at the time, the amendment to the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 52 of 1980 which was brought consequently after

the Court of Appeal judgment “Wijesiri v. AG [1980] 2 SLR 317”, the

learned High Court Judge has erroneously determined that the Hon.

Attorney General has no power to resort to Section 393(7) to file

charges at any Court on his discretion, when Acts specifically provide

the court to which the charges should be filed.

e. The learned High Court Judge erred in determining that the 2nd to

22nd charges cannot be maintained.

CA/HCC/0155/23

11 | P a g e

The main argument of the Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Petitioner

is that the High Court has jurisdiction to try offences under Section 25(1) of

the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 as amended by Act

No. 04 of 1994 as the Act confers jurisdiction to the Magistrate Court to try

the said offences.

In this context, it is very pertinent to discuss Section 393(7) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 which reads as follows:

Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this Act, it shall be

lawful for the Attorney-General, having regard to the nature of the

offence or any other circumstances, in respect of any summary offence

- (a) to forward an indictment directly to the High Court, or

(b) to direct the Magistrate to hold a preliminary inquiry in accordance

with the procedure set out in Chapter XV in respect of any offence

specified by him where he is of opinion that the evidence recorded at a

preliminary inquiry will be necessary for preparing an indictment;

and thereupon such offence shall not be triable by a Magistrate's Court.

In an identical issue, Sisira De Abrew, J. in Sellaiya Sribalan v The

Attorney General CA(PHC) APN 09/2012 decided on 29.03.2012 after

considering Section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the Section

9(1) of the Judicature Act, held that:

“When the above legal provisions are considered, I hold the view that the

Attorney General has the power to send an indictment to the High Court

in respect of a summary offence (an offence triable by the Magistrate) and

when such an indictment is forwarded, the High Court Judge has the

power to hear, try and determine the case and that the Magistrate loses

jurisdiction to hear such a case.”

CA/HCC/0155/23

12 | P a g e

In this case the decision taken to try the charges preferred under the Debt

Recovery Act No.02 of 1990 as amended in the indictment is not open to

challenge as it is the decision of the Attorney General under the power vested

on him under Section 393(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979.

Hence, the High Court under Section 9(1) of the Judicature Act, has the

jurisdiction to hear, try and determine the indictment which include

summary offences triable by the Magistrate.

Hence, I set aside the order of Learned High Court Judge dated 27.04.2023

and direct the learned High Court Judge of Colombo to restore the case back

into the Court’s case roll, to cause the Respondent to appear before the High

Court and proceed the trial to its conclusion.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the High

Court of Colombo for information.
