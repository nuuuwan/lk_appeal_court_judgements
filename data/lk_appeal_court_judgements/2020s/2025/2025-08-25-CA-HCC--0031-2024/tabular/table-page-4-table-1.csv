"indictment.  He  contended  that  the  2nd  count  and  the  3rd  count  in  the"
"indictment  arise  on  the  single  sexual  act  committed  by  the  Appellant."
"Therefore,  the  Counsel  argues  that  convicting  the  Appellant  for  count  two"
"and three are improper and caused great prejudice to the Appellant."
"The Learned Deputy Solicitor General (hereinafter referred to as the ‘DSG’)"
"having considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the Appellant,"
"moved time to consider the argument advanced by the Appellant’s Counsel."
"When  this  matter  resumed  on  17.07.2025,  the  learned  DSG  informed  the"
"Court that given the facts and the circumstances that led to the conviction"
"and  other  incidental  matters,  that  she  will  not  be  contesting  the  sentence"
"passed on the 2nd count by the learned High Court Judge of Ampara."
"The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows."
"The victim was 08 years old and was schooling at the time of the incident."
"The Appellant is a relative of the victim and according to the relationship, he"
"is known as her uncle."
"On the day of the incident, the Appellant left the house with the victim with"
"her mother’s permission to see the Oluvil Harbour and thereafter to go to the"
"Appellant’s  house  in  Ampara.  Both  rode  on  the  Appellant’s  motor  bike."
"Whilst on their way and under the guise of showing her some elephants, the"
"Appellant had parked his motor bike in a forest area and after making her to"
"sit on the motor bike, had kissed her face. A villager who had observed this"
"incident  had  warned  them  to  leave  the  place  immediately.  Thereafter,  the"
"Appellant  had  taken  the  victim  to  a  hilly  area,  made  her  lie  atop  a  rock,"
"removed  her  undergarment  and  kissed  her  again.  At  that  time,  about  six"
"villagers  accompanied  by  a  police  officer  had  arrested  the  Appellant  and"
"handed him over to the Buddhangala Police Post. Thereafter, both had been"
"taken to the Ampara Police Station and an investigation has been conducted."
"The Appellant had been a police officer by profession at that time."
