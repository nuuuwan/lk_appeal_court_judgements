"“The petitioner denies having signed the said Deed of Transfer, even though the"
"said deed had been attested by the same Attorney-at-Law before whom all other"
"deeds and agreements relating to the said properties had been signed by the"
"petitioner. The jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution"
"is to examine whether a statutory authority has acted within the four corners of"
"its enabling legislation. It is not competent for this Court in the exercise of its"
"jurisdiction to issue writs, to investigate disputed questions of fact. Therefore,"
"this Court cannot in these proceedings determine whether the Petitioner has in"
"fact signed the said Deed or not.”"
