"“The writ of mandamus is principally a discretionary remedy - a legal tool for"
"the dispensation of justice when no other remedy is available. Given the power"
"of such a remedy, the Common Law surrounding this remedy requires multiple"
"conditions that must be met prior to the issuance of a writ by Court. The Court"
"will issue a writ only if (1) the major facts are not in dispute and the legal result"
"of the facts are not subject to controversy and"
"(2) the function that is to be compelled is a public duty with the power to perform"
"such duty.”"
