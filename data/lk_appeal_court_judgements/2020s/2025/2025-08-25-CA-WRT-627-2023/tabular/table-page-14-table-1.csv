"“I have given my anxious and careful consideration to the procedure adopted by"
"this Board, and as it appears to me even though these appeals were out of time"
"by  one  day  the  Board  by  its  conduct  during  a  period  of  several  months  has"
"clearly waived its objection to jurisdiction. There is no question that the Board"
"has inherent jurisdiction to hear these appeals. In the circumstances, the delay"
"in filing these appeals being a matter of procedure in my view, if the Board by"
"its conduct has waived its objection by delay and acquiescence on its own part"
"it would not be open to pursue an objection like this when an aggrieved party"
"seeks a bearing before the Board. Procedure should be an aid to Justice and not"
"a mere trap for the uninitiated”"
