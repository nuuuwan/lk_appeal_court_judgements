"in terms of Section 25(3) and 25(4) of the Act and the question at hand is whether the"
"land in question is a “high land” or not. Section 25(3) and 25(4) of the Act reads thus,"
"(3) Where the board disallows an appeal against an award made under section 17,"
"the decision on the appeal shall confirm or reduce the amount of compensation"
"allowed to the appellant by that award."
"(4) Where the board allows an appeal against an award made under section 17, the"
"decision on the appeal shall determine the amount of compensation payable to"
"the appellant:"
"Provided that the board shall not allow as compensation to the appellant an"
"amount which exceeds the amount of the claim for compensation which he had"
"originally notified to the acquiring officer who made such award."
"It is the view of this Court that the classification of the acquired land, whether as “paddy"
"land”,  “high  land”,  or  a  “garden”,  is  directly  relevant  to  the  determination  of  the"
"quantum  of  compensation,  as  the  nature  of  the  land  is  a  critical  factor  in  such"
"assessment. When considering the above facts and circumstances, the view of this Court"
"is that it is not in a position to agree with that contention of the Petitioner. Furthermore,"
"considering the fact that the Board of Review has acted according to the provisions of"
"the Act, this Court is not inclined to grant the writ of Certiorari prayed for in prayer (c)"
"to  the  Petition  quashing  the  order  of  the  Board  of  Review  rejecting  the  Petitioner’s"
"appeal."
