"Act, the Board of Review shall not hear such appeal. In terms of Section 28(1) of the"
"Act, a party dissatisfied with a decision made by the Board of Review can appeal to this"
"Court  against  such  a  decision  on  a  question  of  law.    It  is  trite  law  that  writs  are"
"discretionary remedies and are granted only upon the establishment of grounds such as"
"illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety (vide Council of Civil Service Unions"
"v Minister for the Civil Service6). Accordingly, as mentioned above, the exercise of the"
"writ jurisdiction by this Court is confined to determining whether the statutory authority"
"has acted within the four corners of law. It is the view of this Court that the Board of"
"Review, by rejecting the Petitioner’s appeal in its order marked as P19 on the ground"
"of non-compliance with the stipulated time period for filing an appeal under the Act,"
"has acted within the powers conferred upon it by law. Therefore, considering the fact"
"that the Petitioner had the ability to appeal to this Court under Section 28 of the Act,"
"this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has failed to exhaust the alternative remedy"
"available to him. Furthermore, apart from making a general assertion that the said order"
"is unlawful, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of this Court,"
"how or on what basis the said order can be deemed unlawful."
"The Petitioner further argues that even if the Board of Review heard the Peitioner’s"
"appeal, it has jurisdiction to make only a determination on the amount of compensation"
