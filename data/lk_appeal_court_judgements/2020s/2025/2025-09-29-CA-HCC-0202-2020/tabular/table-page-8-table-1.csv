"13.  The appellant has contended that the inconsistencies highlighted in the cash"
"registers marked පැ-X, පැ-Y and පැ-Z are either calculation errors or mistakes"
"and that they did not have an impact; as the money and the cheques collected"
"by  her  were  handed  over  to  PW02  and  PW02  had  acknowledged  receipt  by"
"making a note in a register termed the “income book”. She has also contended"
"that  PW05,  the internal auditor  has referred to  the contents of the  register"
"termed the “income book” and if such register was produced at the trial, the"
"contents  of  the  same  would  have  revealed  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had"
"handed over the money/cheques collected by her to PW02 at the end of each"
"day. The appellant has also contended that monies deposited directly in the"
"bank  account  of  the  school  would  have  also  been  inserted  in  the  register"
"termed the “income book” hence, further revealed that the appellant had not"
"set apart any money for her use. Therefore, the prosecution by not producing"
"the register termed the” income book” has failed to prove its case beyond a"
"reasonable doubt."
