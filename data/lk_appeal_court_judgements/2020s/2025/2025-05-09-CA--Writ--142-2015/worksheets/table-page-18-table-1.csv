"I am  mindful of  the scope of the jurisdiction  of this Court.  It is my view"
"that,  under  the  instant  application,  any  examination  of  non-compliance"
"with 
the  Supreme  Court 
settlement  or  any 
interpretation  of 
such"
"settlement does not arise. It appears that the issue involved in the instant"
"application  goes  beyond  such  consideration  of  non-compliance  and"
"interpretation. As per the settlement entered before the Supreme Court"
"(P26), the Supreme Court directed the Board of Management to appoint"
"a new panel of Examiners and to ensure that the new Panel so appointed"
"is impartial in the conduct of the said examination. It is observed that the"
"said  appointment  has 
to  be  effected  by 
the 
relevant  authority 
in"
"accordance with the terms laid down under the aforesaid settlement. The"
"specific procedure to be adopted is laid down by the Supreme Court in its"
"aforesaid  order. 
I  hold  the  view  that  the  procedure  followed 
in  the"
"appointment of the new  panel of Examiners by the relevant authority is"
"an administrative process which could be reviewed by this Court under a"
"writ  application.  It  cannot  be  considered  as  an  act  of  interference  or  a"
"process of interference with the functions of the Supreme Court. Hence, I"
"am not in agreement with the submission made on behalf of the Counsel"
"for  the  Respondent  that  this  Court 
lacks 
jurisdiction  to  entertain  the"
"instant application challenging the process of such an appointment made"
"subsequent to a settlement entered before the Supreme Court."
"Allegation of Partiality of the Newly Appointed Panel of Examiners"
"The 
Petitioner 
claims 
that 
the 
newly 
appointed 
examiner, 
Dr."
"Samaranayake  (54th  Respondent),  has  not  completed  seven  years  after"
"completing  her  MD  in  order  to  qualify  as  an  examiner.  Accordingly,  it  is"
"claimed that her appointment to the Panel of Examiners is a violation of"
"the  PGIM  rules.  Anyhow,  the  said  examiner,  54th  Respondent,  had  been"
"removed 
from 
the  Panel  of  Examiners  on  26.01.2015  before 
the"
"examination  was  conducted. 
It  was  further  submitted  that,  since  the"
"51st,52nd,53rd 
and  55th  Respondents  who  were 
appointed 
as  new"
"examiners are persons who have given letters (letters marked P30(a) and"
"P30(b))  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioners  of  the  SCFR    354/2014  case,  said"
"Respondents were bias towards the Petitioners of the said Supreme Court"
"case. Nevertheless, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court as to how"
