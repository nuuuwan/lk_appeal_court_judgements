"instance. In the present circumstance, as I mentioned above, the Board of"
"Study  has  not  been 
involved 
in  arriving  at  the  decision  reflected 
in"
"P40/R21. Therefore, there is no valid decision available before this Court"
"to  review.  This  Court  only  possess  the  power  to  review  any  irregularity,"
"illegality  or  arbitrariness 
in  a  decision 
taken  by  a  decision-making"
"authority  and  not 
the  power 
to  make  decisions  on  behalf  of  such"
"decision-making  authority.  As  such, 
I  am  of  the  view  that  this  Court"
"cannot get into the shoes of the either the Board of Study or the PGIM"
"and make a decisions on their behalf as to whether the Examination held"
"in  February  2015  should  be  considered  as  an  attempt  of  the  Petitioner,"
"whether 
the 
Petitioner 
has 
successfully 
completed 
the 
‘Written"
"Examination’  and 
‘Dissertation  Viva’  components  of 
the  MD(Family"
"Medicine)  Examination  conducted  by  the  PGIM  or  as  to  whether  the"
"Petitioner 
should 
only 
be 
required 
to 
sit 
for 
the 
Clinical"
"Examination(OSCE) 
and 
Portfolio 
Viva 
components 
of 
the 
above"
"examination  scheduled 
for  2015 
for  the  purpose  of  completing 
the"
"MD(Family Medicine) Examination 2013. Hence, I am not inclined to issue"
"the aforesaid Writs of Mandamus as prayed for in the prayers (j), (k) and"
"(l) of the amended Petition."
"However,  since  this  Court  has  now  quashed  the  decision  reflected 
in"
"document marked P40, I view that this decision of the Court should not"
"stand 
in  the  way  of  PGIM  making  an  appropriate  decision  with  the"
"recommendation of the Board of Study in respect of the reliefs prayed for"
"in  the  prayers  (j),(k)  and  (i)  of  the  amended  Petition.  Accordingly,  the"
"application is partly allowed. I order no cost."
