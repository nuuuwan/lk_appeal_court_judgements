"Examination 2013 in February 2015. The Petitioner further requested that"
"he be not considered as a candidate for the above MD (Family Medicine)"
"Examination  to  be  held 
in  February  2015,  and  requested  that  he  be"
"permitted to sit for the subsequent examination, considering the same as"
"his first attempt. Thereafter, the Petitioner had applied to sit for the MD"
"(Family  Medicine) 
Examination 
scheduled 
for  April  2015. 
The  4th"
"Respondent  by  his 
letter  dated  18.03.2015 
(P40)  had 
informed 
the"
"Petitioner that the Board of Management of the PGIM has decided that"
"as  the  Petitioner  did  not  sit  for  the  special  examination  for  MD  (Family"
"Medicine)  held  in  February  2015,  the  examination  he  will  be  sitting  in"
"April will be considered as his second attempt and that he is required to"
"sit for all components of the examination. The Petitioner moves that the"
"said letter marked P40 be quashed."
"The  3rd 
to  5th  and 
the  239th  Respondents  state 
that 
the  Board  of"
"Management of the PGIM in its meeting No. 2003/02 held on 08.02.2003"
"has  decided  that 
if  a  candidate  does  not  sit  for  a  PGIM  examination"
"without  due  reasons,  it  will  be  counted  as  an  attempt.  Extract  of  the"
"Minutes of the said  meeting  marked as R20  has been annexed with the"
"Statement of Objections. The above Respondents contend that since the"
"Petitioner did not sit for the MD (Family Medicine) Examination 2013 held"
"in  February  2015  without  a  valid  reason,  the  Board  of  Management"
"decided  that  the  same  should  be  considered  as  an  attempt,  and  the"
"Petitioner  would  have  to  sit  for  all  components  of  the  next  scheduled"
"examination (P40/R21)."
"Upon careful consideration of the letter marked P35, it appears that the"
"Petitioner, on his own, has decided that the MD (Family Medicine) Special"
"Examination 2013 to be held in February 2015 is illegal and has decided"
"not to participate in the same."
