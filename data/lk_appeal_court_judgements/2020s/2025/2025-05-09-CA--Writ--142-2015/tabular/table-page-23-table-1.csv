"The  3rd  to  5th  Respondents  avers  in  their  Statement  of  Objections  (see"
"paragraph 43 of the Statement of Objections of the 3rd to 5th Respondent)"
"that the policy decisions with regard to whether a candidate should sit for"
"all  components  of  a  particular  examination  or  only 
for 
the 
failed"
"components, 
is  generally  set  out 
in  the  respective  prospects  of  the"
"specialty. Further, the Respondents concede that some prospectuses are"
"silent  on  this 
issue. 
It  appears  that  Family  Medicine 
is  one  of  such"
"prospectuses  which 
is  silent  as  to  the  above. 
In  such  a  situation,  an"
"exemption  could  be  made  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Board  of"
"Study  upon  an  application  to  that  effect  being  made  by  the  candidate."
"(The contents of the documents marked R24 and R25 further support the"
"said  procedure.)  In  the  instant  application,  it  appears  that  the  Board  of"
"Management  has  taken  its  decision  requiring  the  Petitioner  to  sit  for  all"
"the components without consulting the Board of Study."
"Therefore, I hold that the Board of Management of the PGIM has arrived"
"at 
the  aforesaid  decision 
reflected 
in  P40/R21  without  having  due"
"authority to arrive at such  a decision and usurping the lawful powers of"
"the  Board  of 
Study.  Hence, 
the  decision 
taken  by 
the  Board  of"
"Management  of  the PGIM  reflected  in  the  P40/R21  is  arbitrary  and  had"
"been taken without any legal authority. Accordingly, based on the reasons"
"given above, I quash the decision reflected in the document marked P40"
"and  issue Writs of Certiorari prayed for in the prayers (f), (g), and (h) in"
"the amended Petition."
"The Petitioner further seeks in the nature of Writs of Mandamus directing"
"Respondents not to consider the Examination held in February 2015 as an"
"attempt  of  the  Petitioner,  to  treat  as  the  Petitioner  has  successfully"
"completed the ‘Written Examination’ and ‘Dissertation Viva’ components"
"of  the  MD(Family  Medicine)  Examination  conducted  by  the  PGIM  and"
"allow  the  Petitioner  to  sit  only  for  the  Clinical  Examination(OSCE)  and"
"Portfolio Viva components of the above examination scheduled for 2015"
"for  the  purpose  of  completing  the  MD(Family  Medicine)  Examination"
"2013.  (vide  Prayers  (j),  (k)and  (l)  of  the  amended  Petition).  In  my  view,"
"decisions with regard to the aforementioned Writs of Mandamus have to"
"be taken by the PGIM in consultation with the Board of Study at the first"
