"panel of Examiners; and"
"d.  The  Members  of  the  Board  of  Studies  and  the  panel  of"
"Examiners must ensure that they are impartial in the conduct"
"of the said examination."
"Given the above Supreme Court settlement, the Petitioner had withdrawn"
"the  aforesaid  District  Court  action.  Thereafter,  the  4th  Respondent  had"
"informed  the  Petitioner  that  the  new  panel  of  Examiners  and  the  Chief"
"Examiner  appointed  by  the  Senate  of  the  1st  Respondent  University  in"
"January will conduct the Portfolio Viva and Clinical Examination as per the"
"Supreme  Court  order.  The  Petitioner  states  that  although  the  above"
"settlement  arrived  at  before  the  Supreme  Court  specifically  mentioned"
"that  the  Board  of  Studies  and  the  Panel  of  Examiners  must  ensure  that"
"they  are 
impartial 
in  the  conduct  of  the  Examination,  some  of  the"

"Examiners’  and  ‘Guidelines  for  Conduct  of  Examinations’,  it  is  essential"
