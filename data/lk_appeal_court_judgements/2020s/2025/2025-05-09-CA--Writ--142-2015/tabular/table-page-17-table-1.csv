"The  3rd  to  5th  and  the  239th  Respondents  have  raised  a  preliminary"
"objection  to  the  effect  that  this  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  and"
"determine  this  application  as  the

"alleged non-compliance with the settlement entered before the Supreme"
"Court 
in  application  No.  SC  FR  354/13  dated  07.10.2014(P26).  The"
"Petitioner in his Petition avers that the Petitioner, the 229th and the 230th"
"Respondents  of  the  instant  application  were  unaware  of  the  settlement"
"arrived  before 
the  Supreme  Court  and  were  surprised  by 
the  said"
"settlement. It is on the common ground that the Petitioner, the 229th and"
"the  230th  Respondents  of  the  instant  application  were  the  216th,  217th,"
"and  218th  Respondents  of  the  Supreme  Court  application  No.  SC  FR"
"354/13. As per document P26, the present Petitioner (216th Respondent)"
"was  represented  by  a  Counsel  on  the  day  the  instant  settlement  was"
"entered  before  the  Supreme  Court.  Hence,  the  Petitionerâ€™s  submission"
"cannot be accepted."
"The Petitioner also complains that the Supreme Court settlement has not"
"been properly complied with in appointing a new panel of Examiners. It is"
"stated 
that  some  of 
the  members  of 
the  new  panel  of  Examiners"
"appointed  (51st  to  55th  Respondents)  could  not  have  been  appointed  in"
"terms  of  the  settlement  entered  before  the  Supreme  Court,  as  the  54th"
"Respondent,  has  not  completed  7  years  since  completing  her  MD  to"
"qualify as an Examiner, and the others have issued letters in favour of the"
"Petitioners in the Supreme Court case. In the said backdrop, the 3rd to 5th"
"and  the  239th  Respondents  submit  that  no  inferior Court  can  examine  a"
"question as to non-compliance with a judgement of a Superior Court, nor"
"any inferior Court could interpret such judgement of a Superior Court."
