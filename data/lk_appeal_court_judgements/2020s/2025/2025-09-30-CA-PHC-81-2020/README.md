JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. On June 29, 2010, officers of the Range Forest Office in Polonnaruwa

have arrested the accused-respondent-respondents for illegal entry and

logging of “Weera trees” within a protected forest reserve. During the

arrest, the officers have also seized the lorry bearing registration

number CP-LD 2482 together with a tractor trailer that were loaded

with logs.

Page 5 of 14

2. Thereafter, the range forest officer, Polonnaruwa, has filed the action in

the Hinugurakgoda Magistrates Court against the accused-respondent-

respondents for illegally logging “Weera trees” within a protected forest

reserve and causing a loss to the government of Sri Lanka, an offence

punishable in terms of section 20 read with section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance. The accused-respondent-respondents upon pleading guilty

to the charge have been convicted and sentenced.

3. Subsequently, a confiscation inquiry has been held regarding the

vehicle bearing registration no. CP LD 2482. By order dated October

06,2017, the learned Magistrate has ordered the confiscation of the said

vehicle. Aggrieved by the order, the petitioner-appellant [hereinafter

referred to as the appellant] has filed an application in revision [HCRA

01/2018] in the High Court of Polonnaruwa. The learned High Court

Judge by his order dated May 14, 2020, has dismissed the revision

application and affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate. The

appellant also being aggrieved by the order of the High Court Judge of

Polonnaruwa dated May 14, 2020, has preferred the instant appeal to

this Court.

Page 6 of 14

4. It is common ground that the Range Forest Officer of Polonnaruwa has

instituted proceedings against the accused-respondents for illegally

logging “Weera trees” valued at Rs. 24,000.00 on June 29, 2010 and

thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section 20 read

with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No.16 of 1907 (as amended).

5. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 (as amended)

provides;

“(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence –

(a) All timber of forest produce which is not the property of

the State in respect of which such offence has been

committed; and

(b) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines

used in committing such offence,

Shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools,

vehicles, implements, and machines used in the

commission of such offence, is a third party, no Order of

Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

Page 7 of 14

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions

to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the

commission of the offence.

(2) Any property forfeited to the State under subsection (1) shall-

(a) if no appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal

against the relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State

with effect from the date on which the period prescribed

for preferring an appeal against such conviction expires;

(b) if an appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal

against the relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State

with effect from the date on which such conviction is

affirmed on appeal.

In this subsection, “relevant conviction” means the conviction in

consequence of which any property is forfeited to the State under

subsection (1)”.

6. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance states that upon a conviction,

all timber and forest produce that have been the subject matter of

the offence and vehicles used for the commission of such offence

Page 8 of 14

would be confiscated. If the owner of a vehicle himself was the

accused in the preceding case, then the issue before a Court in a

confiscation inquiry will not be complicated. However, if the owner

is a third party, it would be necessary for a Court to ascertain

whether the offence has been committed by a particular accused

with the knowledge and the connivance of the owner of such vehicle

used for the commission of the forest offence.

7. The owner of the vehicle must establish on a balance of

probability, that he took all precautions to prevent the vehicle

from being used in the commission of a forest offence. The

specific precautions deemed relevant will vary from case to case;

there are no universal measures that all vehicle owners must

follow. It is crucial that the precautions taken are convincing and

clearly demonstrate the owner’s diligence. Any actions that

suggest a lack of sincerity or responsibility may undermine the

owner’s position.

Page 9 of 14

8. Further, in an inquiry in the nature of the one in question, the

owner of a vehicle is considered to be the person who has control

over the vehicle in issue.

9. In Oriental Finance Services Corporation Ltd vs. Range Forest

Officer and Another [2011] 1 SLR 86, Sisira de Abrew, J, has

stated;

“It is therefore seen under the existing law a vehicle

transporting timber cannot be confiscated if the owner of the

vehicle on a balance of probability establishes one of the

following things.

1. That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use

of the vehicle for the commission of the offence.

2. That the vehicle has been used for the commission of

the offence without his knowledge.

Who is the owner of the vehicle? This is the most important

question that must be decided in this case. Can it be said that

the absolute owner (the finance company) committed the

offence or it was committed with the knowledge or

Page 10 of 14

participation of the absolute owner. The answer is obviously

no. Surely a finance company cannot participate in the

commission of an offence of this nature when the vehicle is not

with it. It cannot be said that the finance company had the

knowledge of the commission of the offence when the vehicle

was not with it. The owner envisaged in the law cannot be the

absolute owner. In the present case the registered owner is the

one who drove the vehicle at the time of the commission of the

offence. He was convicted on his own plea. If the court is going

to release the vehicle on the basis that the owner of the vehicle

is the absolute owner, then after the release, it is possible for

the absolute owner to give the vehicle to another person. If this

person commits a similar offence the finance company can

take up the same position and the vehicle would be again

released. Then where is the end of the commission of the

offence? Where is the end of the violation of the Forest

Ordinance? There will be no end. If the courts of this country

take up this attitude the purpose of the legislature in enacting

the said provisions of the Forest Ordinance would be defeated.

In my view Courts should not interpret the law to give an

Page 11 of 14

absurd meaning to the law. In this connection I would like to

consider a passage from “Interpretation of Statures by Bindra

7th edition page 235”. “It is a well-known rule of construction

that a statue should not be construed as to impute absurdity

to the legislature”. For these reasons I hold that the owner

envisaged in law is not the absolute owner and the owner

envisaged in law in a case of this nature is the person who

has control over the use of the vehicle. The absolute owner has

no control over the use of the vehicle except to retake the

possession of the vehicle for non-payment of instalments. If the

vehicle is confiscated holding that the absolute owner is not

the owner envisaged in law, no injustice would be caused to

him as he could recover the amount he spent from the

registered owner by way of action in the District Court on the

basis of violation of the agreement”.

10. The petitioner being the registered owner of the lorry bearing

registration no. CP LD 2482 has executed a power-of-attorney on

May 03, 2010. The document has been drawn by A. M.

Ganganatha, Attorney-at-Law and Notary Public and produced

Page 12 of 14

marked “X1”. Through this document, he has nominated and

appointed his father, Siril Abeyweera, as his lawful Attorney,

granting him the authority to superintend, manage and control his

movable and immovable property whether freehold or leasehold.

11. The lorry in issue has been taken into custody on June 29, 2010,

consequent to the control of the lorry being assumed by the

Attorney, thereby designating him as the owner for the purposes of

an inquiry of this nature.

12. The Attorney of the petitioner-appellant i.e. the father of the

petitioner appellant has however failed to take necessary steps to

advance the prosecution during the confiscation inquiry. Over the

course of the inquiry, which has extended for more than one year

and six months, the Counsel retained by the petitioner-appellant

has also requested multiple adjournments. This includes where the

inquiry was scheduled to proceed finally.

Page 13 of 14

13. In light of these circumstances, the learned Magistrate has taken

action to confiscate the vehicle bearing registration number CP LD

2482, citing the owner’s failure to actively prosecute the case

during the inquiry. This Court finds that the learned Magistrate’s

decision to proceed with the confiscation, in the absence of

prosecution by the owner is not irregular.

14. Such action, underscores the importance of adhering to timelines

and the responsibility of a party in prosecuting his case effectively.

This Court, recognises the need for judicial efficiency and fairness,

particularly in the situations where undue delay may adversely

affect proceedings. The failure of the Attorney i.e. the father of the

appellant to engage in the inquiry has led to an unavoidable

consequence to the appellant, illustrating the critical role that

prompt action and diligence play in legal processes.

15. In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the

disputed orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned High

Court Judge dated October 06, 2017 and May 14, 2020

respectively.

Page 14 of 14

16. I hereby dismiss the appeal. I make no order regarding costs.

17. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this

judgment to the Magistrate Court in Hinugurakgoda for information

and compliance.
