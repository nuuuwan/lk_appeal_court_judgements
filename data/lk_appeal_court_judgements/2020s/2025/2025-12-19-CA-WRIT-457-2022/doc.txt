RESPONDENTS

Before: R. Gurusinghe J.

&

Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

Counsel: U. Abdul Najeem for the Petitioner.

Nayomi Kahawita, SSC for the Respondents.

Written Submissions: By the Petitioner – Not filed

On behalf of the 25th and 27th Respondents filed on

11/11/2024

On behalf of the 1st to 23rd Respondents filed on

17/12/2025

Argued On : 21/07/2025 and 29/10/2025

Judgment on : 19/12/2025

Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

1] The Petitioner, who holds a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology with

Second Class Upper Division Honors and an M.Sc. in Computer Science,

previously served as a Temporary Demonstrator in ICT and was among thirteen

candidates interviewed on 24/11/2021 for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) in

the 1st Respondent University.

Page 6 of 17

2] She later became aware that the Council of the 1st Respondent University

had approved the recruitment of the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th Respondents

based on the Selection Committee’s recommendations, decisions she now

challenges.

3] Central to her grievance is the application of the approved marking scheme,

details of the evaluation framework allocated marks for Qualification, Teaching

Ability, Subject Knowledge, Communication Skills, Teaching

Experience/relevant skills, and Personality & other relevance, the Petitioner

asserts that she was awarded only 20% for Qualifications, despite her academic

record entitling her to 25%. She further contends that the Selection Committee

failed to adopt a proper marking scheme for the 15% allocated to Teaching

Ability, thereby rendering the assessment process arbitrary and opaque.

4] The Petitioner further argues that the marks assigned for Subject Knowledge

were distributed inconsistently and without reasonable justification. She

highlights that the 26th and 27th Respondents' degree holders in Electrical and

Electronic Engineering, and Computing and Information Systems, respectively,

were each awarded 12%, while other candidates received significantly lower

marks (05%, 08%, 08%, 11%, and 05%). She also maintains that, under the

University Grants Commission (UGC) circulars, her two years of teaching-

related service as a Temporary Demonstrator should have been recognized as

teaching experience and should have entitled her to up to 10% (02% per year).

Instead, she was awarded only 4% for a different qualification-related

component. These discrepancies, she argues, demonstrate a non-transparent,

arbitrary process that operated to her detriment. The Petitioner further asserts

that the treatment of Research and Publications was similarly flawed, with

certain candidates’ publications not being properly authenticated in accordance

with UGC instructions, thereby undermining the integrity of the assessment

process.

Page 7 of 17

5] The Petitioner ultimately challenges the selection and appointment of the

24th, 25th, and 26th Respondents as Lecturers (Probationary) in ICT, alleging

that the process was tainted by bias, conflicts of interest, and violations of the

Sri Lanka Qualifications Framework (SLQF) and the applicable recruitment

scheme. She contends that the 26th Respondent did not possess qualifications

that fully conformed with the SLQF requirements for Information and

Communication Technology, yet his marks for qualifications were arbitrarily

inflated.

6] She further alleges that the 25th Respondent’s recommendation was

improperly influenced by two Selection Committee members who were close

friends, while the selection of the 24th Respondent was compromised by her

close familial ties to the spouse of a prominent local politician who is also a

relative of the Selection Committee’s chairman. The Petitioner maintains that

key Committee members, including the 2nd Respondent, failed to recuse

themselves despite clear conflicts of interest. In light of these irregularities, and

supported by the annexed documents, she seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the impugned selection process and the resulting appointments.

7] In the above premises, the Petitioner prays to;

a. Issue notice to the Respondents

b. Issue a direction to the 23rd respondent to submit to the Court a certified

copy of the Individual marking sheets used by the members of the

Selection Committee based on which the Evaluation Sheet marked P6c

was prepared

c. Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing:

i. The Evaluation process and assessment of candidates as depicted

in document marked as P6c adopted by the Selection Committee

Page 8 of 17

consisting of the 02nd, 03rd, 11th, 12th,18th and 22nd respondents,

and

ii. The decision made by the Council of the 1st Respondent on

27/11/2021 at its 251st meeting as stated in document marked

as P6e to appoint the 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th Respondents to the

Post of Lecturer [Probationary] in Information and

Communication Technology in the Department of the Information

and Communication Technology of the Faculty of Technology in

the 1st Respondent based on the recommendation of the Selection

Committee

d. Direct the Chairman, University Grants Commission to conduct an

appropriate inquiry and take suitable disciplinary action against the

members of the Selection Committee and Council of the 01st Respondent

who are responsible for the process adopted in the evaluation of

candidates in the interview and unethical conduct in decision making

process to make appointment to the Post of Lecturer [Probationary] in

Information and Communication Technology in the Department of the

Information and Communication Technology of the Faculty of Technology

in the 1st Respondent

e. For costs, and,

f. For such further and other reliefs as to Your Lordships’ Court shall seem

meet.

8] The learned Senior State Counsel on behalf of the Respondent University

argues that the application is largely futile, as two of the successful candidates

have already resigned, and asserts that the selection process was conducted in

strict compliance with the University Grants Commission (UGC) Circular No.

721 and relevant marking schemes.

Page 9 of 17

9] The Respondents justify the marks awarded by detailing the specific academic

and professional standing of each candidate. They contend that the Petitioner’s

postgraduate qualifications were not recognized because she only completed the

coursework component of an M.Sc., failing to meet the "research component"

requirements (minimum 15–60 credits or a full thesis) mandated by UGC

Circular No. 08/2016. Furthermore, the 1st Respondent University clarifies that

the Petitioner’s experience as a "Temporary Demonstrator" does not qualify as

"teaching experience" at the university level, citing that "Demonstrators are not

teachers" under current regulations. In contrast, they highlight that the

successful 24th Respondent held a "Lecturer (Probationary)" position, which was

validly earned and entitled her to teaching marks.

10] Addressing the Petitioner's specific challenge against the 26th Respondent’s

degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University submits that this

discipline falls within the broader "computing" umbrella. They rely on the Sri

Lanka Qualifications Framework (SLQF) and the ACM/IEEE guidelines, which

state that computing is an evolving discipline that overlaps significantly with

Engineering. The Respondents argue that the selection committee exercised

valid "academic judgment" in determining the relevance of the degree to the ICT

department’s evolving curriculum, emphasizing that such technical

assessments are within the purview of educational authorities rather than the

courts.

11] To support the University's autonomy, the submissions rely on established

case law, specifically Dr. Karunananda v. Open University of Sri Lanka

[2006]3SLR 225, where the court held there is "no necessity for the Courts to

unnecessarily intervene in matters purely of academic nature."1

1 Shirani Bandaranayake, J (As she then was) , held; "I am not in agreement with the view chat academic decisions are beyond challenge, there is no necessity for the Courts to unnecessarily intervene in matters 'purely of academic nature' since such issues are best dealt with by academics who are fully equipped to consider the questions in hand; however if there are allegations against decisions of academic establishments that fall under the category stipulated in terms of Article 126, there are no provisions to restrain this Court from examining an alleged violation relating to an infringement or imminent infringement irrespective of the fact that the said violation is in relation to a decision of an academic establishment". (3) The case of the petitioner refers to the failure of the respondents to appoint him as Professor/Assistant Professor where he had the required marks-the petitioner has not questioned the correctness of the assessment of the external experts or the examination panel, the question at issue does not

Page 10 of 17

12] It is to be noted in judicial reviews that the courts are "slow and circumspect"

in interfering with academic decisions unless the decisions are demonstrably

illegal or arbitrary.

13] The Petitioner’s main argument is that her qualification has not been

properly evaluated and assessed by the interview board, and the Board was

biased towards selected candidates. I note that later (bias) was not proved, and

the former assessment of the qualification is within the academic purview, as

the court does not sit as an academic board.

14] In Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth, H.W.R. Wade, C.F. Forsyth,

Administrative Law (11th Edition, Oxford University Press 2014) page 537., it

has been mentioned that Courts will be reluctant to enter “issues of academic

or pastoral judgment which the University was equipped to consider in breadth

and in depth but on which any judgment of the Courts would be jejune and

inappropriate. That undoubtedly included questions such as what mark or class

a student ought to be awarded, or whether an aegrotat was justified. (held in

Clark v. University of Lincolnshire Humberside [2000] 1 WLR 1988. Cited

with authority in Alex Kwao v. University of Keele [2013] EWHC 56 (Admin).

15] Further, in De Smith’s Judicial Review, De Smith’s Judicial Review (8th

Edition, Sweet & Maxwell 2018), page 592, noted;

“The question of the appropriate measure of deference, respect, restraint,

latitude or discretionary area of judgment (to use some of the terms

variously employed) which Courts should grant the primary decision maker

under this head of review is one of the most complex in all of public law and

goes to the heart of the principle of the separation of powers. This is because

there is often a fine line between assessment of the merits of the decision

(evaluation of fact and policy) and the assessment of whether the principles

of “just administrative action” have been met. The former questions are

revolve around matters relating to allocation of marks of examinations, methodology of teaching or matters regarding the curriculum, which are purely of an academic nature.

Page 11 of 17

normally matters for the primary decision-maker, but the latter are within

the appropriate capacity of the courts to decide.”

16] In Dr. Jayawardena v. University of Colombo, CA. Writ 137/2018,

Decided on: 22nd June 2020, His Lordship Arjuna Obeysekere J., considered

the aforementioned principles observed as follows;

“This Court is therefore of the view that while due recognition will be given

to the view of the decision maker, whether the decision relates to academic

matters or otherwise, this Court can, and will, in the exercise of the

jurisdiction vested in it by Article 140 of the Constitution, examine whether

the impugned decision of the 1st Respondent is tainted with illegality,

irrationality or procedural impropriety. This Court would however exercise

extreme caution if asked to consider, for example as in this case, whether a

decision of a selection board or panel to award less marks than what a

petitioner claims is rightfully due, is irrational or unreasonable.”

17] Moreover, in Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara vs

University of Colombo and others, CA (Writ) Application No. 844/2010; CA

Minutes of 8th June 2018., A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. considered several English

cases in this regard, held as follows:

“The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie within

the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities, the

Court has to be slow and circumspect before interfering with any decision

taken by them in connection therewith. Unless a decision is demonstrably

illegal, arbitrary and unconscionable, their province and authority should

not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of want of judicially

manageable standards and necessary expertise to assess, scrutinise and

judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions.”

Page 12 of 17

18] In Dr. Chelliah Elankumaran vs University of Jaffna and others, CA

(Writ) Application No. 147/2013; CA Minutes of 17th May 2019., S. U. B.

Karalliyadde, J., held;

“This Court is of the view that the Selection Committee cannot merely rubber

stamp the marks given by the External Experts and the Panel and that the

Selection Committee must have the power to examine the marks given by

each of the experts and the panel, and where necessary make

adjustments…

…Therefore, it is imperative that the right balance is struck between the

two. This Court is of the view that where there are any inconsistencies

which are of a non-academic nature, or any glaring errors in the marks

given by the experts or the panel, the Selection Committee has the power to

rectify such errors or inconsistencies.”

19] In R v. Higher Education Funding Council ex-parte Institute of Dental

Surgery (1994) 1 WLR 242, Stephen Sedley, observed;

"This is not to say for a moment that academic decisions are beyond

challenge."

"The question why in isolation as it can now be seen to be, is a question of

academic judgement. We would hold that where what is sought to be

impugned is on the evidence, no more than an informed exercise of

academic judgement, fairness alone will not require reasons to be given.

This is not to say for a moment that academic decisions are beyond

challenge. A mark, for example, awarded at an examiners' meeting where

irrelevant and damaging personal factors have been allowed to enter into

the evaluation of a candidate's written paper is something more than an

informed exercise of academic judgement."

20] In the case of B.S.E.M. Perera Vs Victor Perera, Inspector General of

Police and 22 Others, considering the same matter Justice Sathya Hettige held

as follows;

Page 13 of 17

“…And as such I do not see that any injustice or prejudice has been caused

to the petitioner at the Interview as all the candidates have been assessed

by the interview board in good faith without any discrimination. I do not

agree with the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that the petitioners were prejudiced as marking scheme was made known

to the candidates prior to the interviews…”

21] Further, in A. T. Muditha Sahandani vs University Grants Commission

and others, C.A. Case No.WRT-286/20, DECIDED ON: 08.08.2023, WICKUM

A. KALUARACHCHI, J. noted;

“It is to be noted that when there is a written examination and an interview,

the person who obtained the highest marks in the written examination

would not essentially be selected as the first in the interview. Sometimes

the person who obtained the highest marks in the written examination may

be disqualified in the interview. Therefore, the argument that the petitioner

had a legitimate expectation that she would be selected in the interview has

no merit.”

22] In PERERA AND NINE OTHERS v. MONETARY BOARD OF THE CENTRAL

BANK OF SRI LANKA & TWENTY-TWO OTHERS, [1994] 1 SLR 152,

Amerasinghe J: considered the selection process and observed;

“Eventually, the guiding factor is the achievement of the goals of the

institution within the framework of the law. and at every stage of the

selection process, from the determination of the need for the services of a

particular type of officer and numbers in each class, through the

determination of the relevant qualifications for eligibility, to the selection of

a candidate: those who are entrusted with the task of the achievement of

the goals of the institution must necessarily have a discretion because it is

they who are responsible and accountable for the success or failure of the

institution. In the exercise of their discretion, they have both a right and a

duty to discriminate so that the objects of the institution as set out in the

instrument of creation may be achieved: Distinctions are regarded as

Page 14 of 17

permissible because they are necessary to select those who are necessary

and best suited for the performance of specific tasks. On the question of

cadre they may decide that different numbers of officers are required for

each post. On the question of eligibility they may distinguish between the

various qualifications and qualities.”

23] In W.M. Namal Sanjeewa vs Neville Gunawardena Director General of

Customs and others, SC FR Application No. 244/2012, Decided on: 17-07-

2020, Murdu N.B. Fernando, PC J.(As her ladyship then was)

“In my view the criterion adopted by the Respondents in selecting the best

candidate was based upon legitimate, reasonable and intelligible

differentia. Hence, the said classification cannot be termed discriminatory

or arbitrary as contended by the Petitioner. The main object of the

Respondents were to select the most suitable candidates from a number of

eligible candidates and an elimination system had to be adhered to, in such

a situation…

… In the said circumstances, I am of the view that the marking scheme

adopted by the interview board cannot be deemed arbitrary, capricious or

defy reasoning as contented by the Petitioner. Similarly, the marking

scheme cannot be deemed unreasonable, or in violation of the fundamental

rights of the Petitioner as submitted by the Petitioner before this Court.”

24] In the case in hand, the 1st Respondent University is to select the best-suited

candidate for the performance of specific tasks. Awarding marks for each

category is for the academics; this court, as non-academics, is not to decide that.

Thus, in view of the above authorities, I hold that the Petitioner has not satisfied

the requirement for intervention of this court to invoke writ jurisdiction.

25] I note that Prayer “d” is prayed for “Direct the Chairman, University Grants

Commission, to conduct an appropriate inquiry and take suitable disciplinary

action against the members of the Selection Committee”. If an injustice is being

Page 15 of 17

done, the Petitioner should act under section 86(a) of the Universities Act No. 16

of 1978. It reads as follows: 86.

“The Appeals Board shall have and may exercise the following powers,

duties and functions:

(a) to conduct investigations into appointments and promotions alleged to

have been made to the staff of the Commission and to Higher

Educational Institutions in contravention of the schemes of recruitment

and the procedures for appointment in force at the time such

appointments or promotions were made or alleged to have been made

and into allegations that appointments or promotions have not been

made to posts when vacancies have arisen in such posts;”

26] I do not see any bar that the Petitioner was preventing from having redress

under the above section. In fact, the Petitioner has an alternative remedy against

the impugned decision, which she has not resorted to. Thus, the Petitioner

would have directly appealed to the University Appeal Board to have an inquiry.

27] In this regard, the decision in R v. Commissioner of Police of the

Metropolis, ex parte Blackburn [1968] 2 QB 118 reaffirmed the discretionary

nature of writs and emphasized that their issuance may justifiably be declined

when an adequate alternative remedy exists.

28] In R (G) v. Governors of X School [2011] UKSC 30; 1 AC 167. and R (O) v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 19; 1 WLR 1717.,

where the UK Supreme Court held that the Petitioners, respectively a suspended

teacher and an asylum seeker, ought to have availed themselves of internal

appeal procedures and statutory appellate mechanisms before turning to the

courts to invoke writ jurisdiction.

29] In Sri Lanka, in the case of Somasunderam Vanniasingham Vs. Forbes

and others 1993 (2) SLR 362. the Supreme Court held that;

Page 16 of 17

“A party to an arbitration award under the Industrial Disputes Act is not

required to exhaust other available remedies before he could challenge

illegalities and errors on the face of the record by an application for a writ

of certiorari. This is so even though he had the right to repudiate the award

under section 20 (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act. A settlement order should

not itself be hastily regarded as a satisfactory alternative remedy to the

Court's discretionary powers of review. There is no rule requiring the

exhaustion of administrative remedies.”

Per Bandaranayake J.

“As I have said there is no rule requiring alternative administrative remedies

to be first exhausted without which access to review is denied. A Court is

expected to satisfy itself that any administrative relief provided for by

statute is a satisfactory substitute to review before withholding relief by

way of review.”

30] Similarly, in Ishak v Laxman Perera [2003] 3 SLR 18, held that;

“where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the applicant

with a satisfactory remedy the Courts will usually insist on an applicant

exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial review. In doing so the Court

is coming to a discretionary decision.”

31] In Jayaweera V. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura

and Another [1996] 2 SLR 70, the Court held;

“A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ

of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right

or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a

discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches,

waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments which stand

against the grant of relief.”

Page 17 of 17

32] In line with the above authorities, this court sees that the Petitioner ought

to have first gone to the University Appeal Board under 86(a) of the University

Act, and thereafter vindicate her rights in this court.

33] For the foregoing reasons, the application for writ of certiorari prayed for by

the petitioner is dismissed without costs.
