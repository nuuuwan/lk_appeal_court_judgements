"5.  The parties involved were in a consensual romantic relationship at the time of the"
"incident."
"I
n this context, this Court has to consider what is the punishment imposed by the"
"legislature."
"S
ection 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 stipulates that;"
"“The High Court may impose any sentence or other penalty prescribed by"
"written law”"
"In the instant case, the said sentence or penalty prescribed by written law is found"
"in Section 364 (2)(e) of the Penal Code;"
"(2) “Whoever—"
"(e) commits rape on a woman under eighteen years of age;"
"shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not test than ten"
"years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall in addition be"
"ordered  to  pay  compensation  of  an  amount  determined  by  court  to  the"
"person in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused"
"to such person;"
"P
rovided,  however,  that  where  the  offence  is  committed  in  respect    of  a"
"person under sixteen years of age, the court may, where the offender is a"
"person under eighteen years of age and the intercourse has been with the"
"consent of the person, impose a sentence of imprisonment for  term less than"
"ten years."
"Upon perusal of the proceedings dated 04.05.2022, it appears that the learned State Counsel"
"has incorrectly cited the relevant legal provisions pertaining to the sentence. Furthermore, we"
"observe that he has failed to address the Court regarding the aggravating circumstances that"
"may influence the sentence. We are mindful that sentencing is contingent upon the facts and"
"circumstances specific to each case."
