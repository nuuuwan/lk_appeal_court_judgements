"Our courts have considered that when the court imposes the sentence, the views of the all the"
"parties involved in the case must be considered in a balanced manner."
"In this instant case, the learned High Court Judge has not indicated on what basis"
"he has imposed  08  years rigorous  imprisonment,  where  the  maximum  sentence"
"that could be imposed is 10 years. On the other hand, the learned State Counsel"
"has  not  indicated  what  the  aggravating  factors  are  that  have  to  be  considered"
"when imposing a sentence on the Accused."
