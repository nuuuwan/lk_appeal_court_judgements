"2 Held; The finality attached to an interlocutory decree of partition under section 48 (1) of the"
"Partition  Law,  No.  21  of  1977,  does  not  preclude  an  appeal  court  from  interfering  with  such"
"decree by way of revision or restitutio in integrum where a miscarriage of justice has occurred."
"In this case the corpus to be partitioned had not been sufficiently identified either by means of"
"the stated boundaries or by extent and the land of the petitioner appeared to be included in the"
"corpus. Therefore, there has been a miscarriage of justice."
