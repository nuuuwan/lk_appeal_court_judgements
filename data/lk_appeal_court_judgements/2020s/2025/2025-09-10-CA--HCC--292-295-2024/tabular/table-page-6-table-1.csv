"Bharatipuram checkpoint on 31 January 1998. He stated that gunfire was directed from the"
"jungle area over the checkpoint beginning at nightfall and continuing into the early hours of"
"the  following  morning.  The  police  returned  fire,  and  no  injuries  were  reported  during  the"
"exchange."
"R
einforcements  arrived  around  5:30  a.m.,  including  PW  78  (Headquarters  Inspector  of"
"Kantale), the 4th Accused, and subsequently the 2nd Accused. PW 37 was positioned near a"
"Nuga tree directly opposite the checkpoint, from where he had a clear and unobstructed view"
"of the area. Between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m., the 2nd Accused brought two civilians clad only in"
"sarongs  from  the  direction  of  Pokkurani  and  seated  them  near  the  checkpoint.  These"
"individuals  were  then  placed  under  the  custody  of  the  4th  Accused,  who  proceeded  to"
"interrogate them. The 2nd Accused was not present during this questioning."
"H
e  later  observed  the  civilians  being  dragged  behind  the  checkpoint  by  a  man  dressed  in"
"civilian clothing, whose identity he could not ascertain and who was not among the accused"
"present in court. Shortly thereafter, the witness saw the two civilians lying dead in a pool of"
"blood  behind  the  checkpoint.  The  witness  further  noted  that  several  armed  police  officers"
"were present at the scene, many of whom were dressed in civilian attire."
"D
uring  cross-examination,  PW  37  confirmed  that  both  PW  78  and  the  4th  Accused  were"
"present  together  in  the  tea  pantry.  When  questioned  by  Learned  Counsel  regarding  an"
"alleged  omission  in  his  police  statement,  specifically,  that  he  had  not  mentioned  the  4th"
"Accused  interrogating  the  two  civilians,  the  witness  firmly  asserted  that  he  had  indeed"
"included that detail."
"P
W  37  also  noted  the  presence  of  an  unidentified  individual  at  the  scene,  although  the"
"indictment makes no reference to any such ""unknown person."" Upon reviewing the evidence,"
"PW 37â€™s testimony describes the 2nd Accused bringing a civilian and handing him over to the"
"4th Accused. This was followed by an unidentified person who arrived with the two deceased"
"civilians and subsequently shot and killed them. There is no evidence to suggest that the 1st,"
"5th and 8th Accused were present at the time of the incident."
