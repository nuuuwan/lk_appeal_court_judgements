"The  issue  is  further  elucidated  in  the  following  passage  extracted  from  Ratanlal  and"
"Dhirajlal, The Law of Crimes, Ninth Edition, at page 321."""
"“2. 'Common object’.-The essence of the offence is the common object of the persons"
"forming the assembly. Whether the object is in their minds when they come together,"
"or whether it occurs to them afterwards, is not material. But it is necessary that the"
"object should be common to the persons who compose the assembly,  that is, that they"
"should all be aware of it and concur in it. It seems also that there must be  some"
"present and immediate purpose of carrying into effect the common object; and that a"
"meeting for deliberation only, and to arrange plans for future action is not an unlawful"
"assembly.”"
