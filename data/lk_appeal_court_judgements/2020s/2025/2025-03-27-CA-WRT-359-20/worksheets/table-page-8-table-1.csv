"prima facie evidence against the Petitioner, suggesting that his conduct had"
"tarnished  the  reputation  of  the  University.  Consequently,  the  Committee"
"recommended the Petitioner’s immediate removal from the position of Head of"
"Department and further action, leading to the issuance of a charge sheet in"
"July 2016 (marked ""P7A"" and ""R13"")."
"T
he  disciplinary  inquiry  began  on  21st  November  2016  and  spanned  over"
"multiple sessions until August 2019. During these proceedings, the Petitioner"
"was  represented  by  legal  counsel,  and  extensive  cross-examinations  took"
"place. The inquiry concluded with the Petitioner being found guilty of several"
"charges,  including  sexual  harassment  and  the  use  of  offensive  language"
"towards colleagues (marked ""P16""). Following the completion of the inquiry,"
"the  University  Council,  in  its  568th  meeting,  reviewed  the  findings  and"
"decided 
to 
terminate 
the  Petitioner’s  employment,  which  was 
formally"
"communicated to him in June 2020 (marked ""P13"")."
"T
he Petitioner, dissatisfied with the outcome, filed the present writ application"
"in  September  2020,  seeking  judicial  intervention  to  overturn  the  decisions"
"related to his dismissal and other disciplinary actions. He contends that the"
"proceedings violated procedural fairness and that the University acted in bad"
"faith throughout the process (marked ""P10"" and ""P13"")."
"T
he  Respondents  have  raised  several  preliminary  objections,  including  the"
"argument  that  the  Petitioner  has 
failed  to  exhaust  alternative  remedies"
"available under the Universities Act, specifically the appeal process before the"
"University  Services  Appeals  Board.  The  Respondents  assert  that  the  issues"
"raised  by  the  Petitioner  pertain  to  employment  matters,  which  are  not"
"typically justiciable under the writ jurisdiction. Additionally, the Petitioner’s"
"conduct,  including  the  suppression  of  material  facts,  has  been  called  into"
"question, with the Respondents arguing that such actions disqualify him from"
"seeking the extraordinary remedy of a writ (marked ""R7"")."
"A
n  order  of  this  Court  dated  08.11.2022,  overruled  the  initial  preliminary"
"objections  raised  by  the  Respondents.  However,  the  said  order  granted  the"
"Respondents 
permission 
to 
raise 
additional 
preliminary 
objections."
"Furthermore,  although 
the  Petitioner 
initially  sought 
interim  relief, 
the"
"President's Counsel for the Petitioner chose not to pursue such relief, in order"
"to facilitate the expeditious resolution of the matter."
