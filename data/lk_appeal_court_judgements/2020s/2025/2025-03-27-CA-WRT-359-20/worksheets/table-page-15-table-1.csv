"The Petitioner’s application for judicial review is fundamentally flawed, as it"
"is  premised  on  claims  regarding  the  procedural  integrity  of  the  disciplinary"
"process  and  the  availability  of  alternative  remedies.  The  Respondents  have"
"demonstrated  that 
the  disciplinary  process  was  not  only  conducted 
in"
"accordance with the required procedures but also that any alleged deficiencies"
"were  addressed  promptly.  The  Petitioner,  despite  having  a  clear  statutory"
"avenue  for  appeal,  chose  not  to  pursue  this  remedy.  Instead,  he  sought"
"judicial  review  without  providing  adequate  justification  for  bypassing  the"
"University Services Appeals Board."
"T
he  legal  arguments  advanced  by  the  Petitioner  fail  to  demonstrate  any"
"substantial  error  in  the  Respondents'  actions.  Specifically,  the  Petitioner’s"
"arguments  regarding  procedural  unfairness  and  bias,  though  serious  in"
"nature, are unsupported by suffiecient evidence. While this court observes a"
"possible  conflict  of  interest  in  the  disciplinary  process,  the  Respondents’"
"arguments,  corroborated  by  relevant  documentation,  demonstrate  that  the"
"inquiry  was  fair,  transparent,  and  conducted  by  an  independent  inquiry"
"officer. The Petitioner had the opportunity to engage with the process, raise"
"objections,  and  participate  fully  in  the  hearings.  Yet,  at  no  stage  did  the"
"Petitioner 
challenge 
the  process 
or 
raise 
concerns  about  procedural"
"unfairness until after the conclusion of the inquiry."
"T
he  Respondents  have  also  clearly  shown  that  the  charge  sheets,  while"
"initially vague, were amended in response to the Petitioner’s concerns. These"
"amendments, which occurred well within the timeline required by the relevant"
"regulations,  ensured  that  the  Petitioner  was  adequately  informed  of  the"
"charges  and 
could  present  a  proper  defense.  This 
corrective  action"
"demonstrates the Respondents’ commitment to ensuring procedural fairness,"
"despite the Petitioner’s failure to object at an earlier stage (marked “P7A” and"
"“P8”)."
"A
dditionally,  the  Respondents’  position  regarding  the  sufficiency  of  the"
"alternative remedy, the University Services Appeals Board, holds significant"
"weight.  The  Petitioner’s  argument  that  the  appeal  mechanism  would  not"
"address  the  procedural  issues  he  raised  is  unconvincing.  The  University"
"Services  Appeals  Board 
is  a  statutory  body  empowered  to  consider  the"
"fairness of decisions, including those related to disciplinary inquiries. Its role"
"encompasses 
reviewing 
procedural 
fairness 
and 
ensuring 
that 
any"
"disciplinary action taken is in line with established procedures and principles"
"of  natural 
justice.  The  Petitioner,  however,  opted 
to  bypass 
this  well-"
"established mechanism without providing a compelling reason for doing so."
"As  established  in  administrative  law,  where  an  alternative  remedy  exists,  a"
"party  must  exhaust  that  remedy  before  seeking  judicial  intervention.  By"
