"details,  further  demonstrating  the  unfairness  of  the  proceedings  (marked"
"""P7A"" and ""P8"")."
"T
he Respondents maintain that the disciplinary proceedings were conducted"
"in accordance with due process, and that the Petitioner was afforded ample"
"opportunity 
to  respond 
to 
the  allegations.  They  reject  claims  of  bias,"
"emphasizing that the individuals involved in the inquiry were not improperly"
"influenced and that the inquiry was independent. They further argue that the"
"Petitioner’s  failure  to  object  to  the  process  at  any  stage  is  evidence  of  his"
"acquiescence to the proceedings (marked ""R13"")."
"T
he 
involvement  of 
faculty  members  who  were  both  complainants  and"
"members  of  the  disciplinary  inquiry  committee  creates  conflict  of  interest."
"Such  involvement  undermines  the  impartiality  and  fairness  of  the  inquiry."
"Judicial  fairness  requires  that  decisions  are  made  by  unbiased  individuals"
"who are not personally invested in the outcome."
"While  the  Petitioner’s  concerns  regarding  bias  and  procedural  irregularities"
"are  not  without  merit,  the  Respondents  have  successfully  defended  the"
"process as fair and within the bounds of the law."
"T
he  Petitioner  has  failed  to  provide  concrete  evidence  of  bias  or  procedural"
"violations  that  would  warrant  the  quashing  of  the  disciplinary  decision."
"Moreover, the Petitioner participated in the inquiry without raising objections"
"at  any  point,  which  undermines  his  claims  of  procedural  unfairness.  His"
"failure  to  object  during  the  proceedings  suggests  that  he  acquiesced  to  the"
"process, 
further  weakening  his  argument 
that 
the  proceedings  were"
"fundamentally flawed."
