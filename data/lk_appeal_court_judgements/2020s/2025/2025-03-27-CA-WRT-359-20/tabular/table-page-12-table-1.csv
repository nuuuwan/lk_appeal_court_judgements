"availability of an alternative remedy and the private nature of the dispute."

bservations of the Court"
"A
lternative Remedy (University Services Appeals Board)"
"T
he  Respondents  assert 
that 
the  Petitioner  has  an  alternative  remedy"
"available under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, specifically through an"
"appeal to the University Services Appeals Board. The Respondents emphasize"
"that  judicial  review  is  an  extraordinary  remedy  and  should  not  be  invoked"
"when  an  adequate  statutory  remedy  exists.  They  cite  previous  cases  that"
"reinforce the importance of exhausting all available administrative remedies"
"before  resorting  to  judicial  review  (marked  ""R16""  and  ""R17"").  They  further"
"argue that this alternative remedy is both effective and comprehensive, as it"
"provides a dedicated platform for addressing disputes related to employment"
"within the university system."
"The Petitioner counters this argument by asserting that the appeal process"
"would be limited to reviewing the decision's accuracy rather than addressing"
"the procedural unfairness and bias in the disciplinary process. He claims that"
"the appeal mechanism would not provide him with a remedy for the alleged"
"breaches of natural justice, such as bias and conflict of interest, and thus is"
"not adequate in this case (marked ""P10"" and ""P11"")."
"T
he Respondents' argument regarding the availability of an alternative remedy"
"is  robust.  The  University  Services  Appeals  Board 
is  a  statutory  body"
"specifically created to resolve disputes related to university employment. The"
"Petitionerâ€™s assertion that the appeal process does not address the procedural"
"issues, such as bias and conflict of interest, does not undermine the adequacy"
"of  the  remedy 
itself. 
In  the  case  at  hand,  the  Petitioner  has 
failed  to"
"demonstrate that the alternative remedy provided by the Appeals Board would"
"be 
ineffective 
in  addressing  his  grievances.  The  Petitioner  has  also  not"
"adequately explained why he did not pursue this remedy, which remains the"
"most appropriate and effective route for resolving disputes of this nature."
"P
rocedural Fairness and Bias"
"T
he  Petitioner  asserts 
that 
the  disciplinary  process  was 
riddled  with"
"procedural irregularities, including the involvement of individuals who were"
"both complainants and members of the disciplinary inquiry committee, which"
"led to an inherent conflict of interest. He argues that these issues deprived"
"him of a fair hearing and rendered the entire process invalid. Additionally, the"
"Petitioner points to  the vague charge sheets, which failed to specify critical"
