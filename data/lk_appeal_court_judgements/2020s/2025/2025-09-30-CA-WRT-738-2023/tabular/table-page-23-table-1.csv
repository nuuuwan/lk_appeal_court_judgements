"The prerogative remedy of mandamus has long provided the normal means of"
"enforcing the performance of  public duties by public authorities of  all kinds."
"Like the other prerogative remedies, it is normally granted on the application"
"of a private litigant, though it may equally well be used by one public authority"
"against another. The commonest employment of mandamus is as a weapon in"
"the hands of the ordinary citizen, when a public authority fails to do its duty by"
"him.  Certiorari  and  prohibition  deal  with  wrongful  action,  mandamus  deals"
"with wrongful inaction. The prerogative remedies thus together cover the field"
"of governmental powers and duties."
"Mandamus reached the zenith of its utility in the eighteenth century, when as"
"well as protecting the citizen, it played a conspicuous part in the machinery of"
"the era between the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1640 and the creation of"
"the modern system of local government in the nineteenth century. During that"
"inter-regnum the business of administration was mainly in the hands of local"
"magistrates  and  other  authorities  who  enjoyed  an  extraordinary  measure  of"
"independence.  A  mandamus  from  the  King’s  Bench  was  virtually  the  only"
"effective means of forcing some such body to carry out its duties under common"
"law or Acts of Parliament. We have already seen an example of its use in that"
"heyday of the rule of law."
"The essence of mandamus is that it is a royal command, issued in the name of"
"the Crown from the Court of King’s Bench (now the Queen’s Bench Division of"
"the  High  Court),  ordering  the  performance  of  a  public  legal  duty.  It  is  a"
"discretionary  remedy,  and  the  Court  has  full  discretion  to  withhold  it  in"
"unsuitable cases. It has never lost the wide scope which the courts gave it in the"
"eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries,  when  it  was  so  vital  a  part  of  the"
"mechanism of the state. But in the highly organised administrative system of the"
"modern state, it has no longer this prominent role to play. Governmental bodies"
