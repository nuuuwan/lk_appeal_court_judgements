"constructions  have  been  carried  out  within  the  boundaries  of  the  Wilpattu  National"
"Park.  Therefore,  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  encroachments  alleged  by  the"
"Petitioner fall within the boundaries of Block V of the Wilpattu National Park stipulated"
"in P2."
"Now the question before this Court is whether the 1st Respondent has failed to discharge"
"the statutory duty imposed upon him under the FFPO. The contention of the Petitioner"
"is that the illegal encroachers had violated the provisions mentioned in Sections 5 and"
"6(1) of the FFPO. Unless a permit issued by the ‘prescribed officer’ is obtained, entry"
"to a National Park is prohibited in terms of Section 5(1) of the FFPO. Under Section"
"5(2) of the Ordinance, a permit issued under Section 5(1) can only be obtained for the"
"purpose of studying or observing the fauna and flora in a National Park. In terms of"
"Section  5(4)  of  the  FFPO,  a  person  who  enters  and  remains  within  a  National  Park"
"without obtaining a permit is guilty of an offence under the FFPO. Therefore, it is clear"
"that, other than for the purpose of studying or observing the environment, no person"
"can enter or remain within the National Park."
"Section 6 of the FFPO lays down the acts that are prohibited in Strict Natural Reserves,"
"National Parks, Nature Reserves and Jungle Corridors. In terms of Section 6(1)(i) of"
"the FFPO, except under the authority of a permit issued by the ‘prescribed officer’, no"
"person can erect any building, whether permanent or temporary, or occupy any building"
"so  erected.  As  per  Section  72  of  the  FFPO,  the  ‘prescribed  officer’  is  interpreted  to"
"mean any wildlife officer unless otherwise defined under the FFPO. In terms of Section"
