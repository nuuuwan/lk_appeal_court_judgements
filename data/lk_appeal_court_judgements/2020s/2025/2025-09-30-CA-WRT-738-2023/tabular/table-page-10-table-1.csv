"such illegal activities has posed a serious threat to the conservation of wildlife within"
"the Wilpattu National Park. The learned State Counsel has also admitted this allegation"
"of the Petitioner."
"In terms of the preamble, the purpose of the FFPO is to protect and conserve the fauna"
"and flora of Sri Lanka and their habitats. In terms of Section 66A(b) of the FFPO, if an"
"officer appointed under the FFPO “who willfully neglects or fails to perform any duty"
"under this Ordinance or neglects or fails to report any offence under the Ordinance”"
"shall be guilty of an offence under the FFPO. This alone establishes the fact that the 1st"
"Respondent  owe  a  statutory  duty  to  ensure  that  provisions  of  this  FFPO  have  been"
"complied with. In the case of Environmental Foundation Ltd. v. Central Environmental"
"Authority and Others,2 Sripavan, J. observed that, “where a statute requires the power"
"to be exercised in a certain form, the neglect of that form renders the exercise of the"
"power ultra vires.” Furthermore, in Bandara and Another v. Premachandra, Secretary,"
"Ministry of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Others,3 it was held that,"
