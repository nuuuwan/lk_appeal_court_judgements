"Therefore, it is my view that the Petitioner is entitled to obtain a  Writ of Mandamus"
"compelling the 1st Respondent to perform the official duties cast upon him under the"
"Ordinance. Accordingly, the Petitioner is entitled to the Writs sought from this Court."
"Delegation of duties of the 1st Respondent"
"In this case, one additional point to be mentioned is that it was argued for and on behalf"
"of the Respondents, particularly the 1st Respondent, that without the assistance or the"
"participation  the  Divisional  Secretary  of  the  area,  the  1st  Respondent  cannot  take  a"
"decision. No statutory provision was brought before us to establish that the Divisional"
"Secretary  is  in  charge  of  the  Wilpattu  National  Park,  or  that  the  1st  Respondent  can"
"delegate  his  powers  to  the  Divisional  Secretary  to  exercise  any  power  under  him  or"
"under the Fauna and Flora Ordinance to take action against people or actions in favour"
"of the squatters who have already settled within the boundaries of Wilpattu National"
"Park. Therefore, the contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents is not acceptable"
"for two reasons. One is that there is no statutory provision or any law to establish that"
"the Divisional Secretary is empowered to settle squatters within the boundaries of the"
"Wilpattu  National  Park.  The  second  matter  is  that  the  powers  entrusted  to  the  1st"
"Respondent cannot be delegated to the Divisional Secretary either to settle squatters or"
"to  eject  or  bring  them  before  the  law  under  the  Ordinance.  Therefore,  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus has to be issued against the 1st Respondent to compel him to take necessary"
"actions. An argument based on bringing or citing the Divisional Secretary of the area"
"as a necessary party only amounts to introducing a red herring."
