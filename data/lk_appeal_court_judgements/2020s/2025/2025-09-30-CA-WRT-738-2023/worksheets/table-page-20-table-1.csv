"bordering  villages  of  the  said  districts  were  also  destroyed  during  the  hostilities,"
"although wildlife, though disturbed, was not eradicated."
"After the hostilities ceased, at one point in time, normalcy came to exist in the day-to-"
"day life of human activity. With that, it was found that human activities started; this"
"includes  encroachment,  colonisation,  and  unlawful  settlement  within  the  boundaries"
"and territories of the Wilpattu National Park. Thus, adversely affecting the biodiversity"
"of the Wilpattu Park and its buffer zones."
"The complaint of the Petitioner to this Court is that the Respondents, particularly the 1st"
"Respondent,  has  failed  and  neglected  to  take  actions  against  the  squatters  who  have"
"now settled within the boundaries of the Wilpattu National Park after the cessation of"
"hostilities  between  the  belligerent  parties  in  2009.  Hence,  the  Respondents  have"
"derelicted their statutory duties cast upon them. In those circumstances, the Petitioner"
"seeks  to  obtain  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  against  the  Respondents,  particularly  the  1st"
"Respondent, compelling them to perform their statutory duties."
"The question that arises is whether the Petitioner is entitled to obtain a writ in the nature"
"of  Mandamus,  compelling  the  Respondents  to  take  certain  measures  or  to  perform"
"statutory duties imposed upon them by the relevant statutes. For that purpose, I will"
"first consider what legal right the Petitioner possesses to sue the Respondents in order"
"to  compel  them  to  perform  certain  acts  that  are  statutorily  cast  upon  them.  As  the"
"Petitioner asserts, it is a non-governmental organisation registered as a limited liability"
