    "text": "JUDGMENT R. Gurusinghe, J. The petitioner filed this Restitutio-in-Integrum application against the plaintiff-respondent Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Bank), seeking the relief prayed for in the petition. The respondent bank instituted an action against the petitioner\u2019s late husband as the defendant to recover monies due upon a mortgage bond. The petitioner\u2019s husband and the Bank agreed to settle the action on 22 February 2018. The written terms of the settlement motion dated 22-02-2018, signed by the registered Attorneys for the bank and the petitioners\u2019 husband and his registered Attorney, were tendered to the court. A decree was entered in accordance with the terms of the settlement. On 24-05-2019, the petitioner\u2019s husband passed away. The bank made an application under Section 26 of the Mortgage Bond Act to the District Court on 11-12-2020, and that application was supported in open court on 14-12-2020. The Bank produced the death certificate of the deceased defendant and the marriage certificate of the petitioner and the deceased defendant. Accordingly, the District Court issued notice on the petitioner. The Fiscal of the Court reported to the court that the notice had been served on the petitioner. The court appointed the petitioner as the legal representative of the deceased defendant. Thereafter, the Bank submitted an application to execute the writ in accordance with the settlement decree. The court allowed that application. Petitioner in this application states that although the notices were issued on the petitioner, the petitioner was not duly appointed as the legal representative of the deceased-defendant. Further, the petitioner states that she is not the only heir to the deceased-defendant. The deceased-defendant and the petitioner have four children, and those children should have been made parties. Petitioner states that she did not receive the notice of the application made by the Bank, as she had left the premises at No. 2 Gangarama Cross Road, Magalle, Galle, prior to the dispatch of such notice.",

A settlement was reached between the bank and the defendant, and accordingly, the rights of the parties had already been determined. The petitioner has not made any application to the District Court. In terms of the provisions in Section 26 of the Mortgage Act No. 6 of 1949 as amended, the petitioner, being the wife of the deceased defendant, is the most suitable person to be appointed as Legal Representative. The respondent bank made the application to appoint the petitioner on 11-12-2020. The defendant died on 24-05-2019. Clearly, the bank has made the application under section 26 of the Mortgage Act after the expiration of a six-month period following the death of the deceased. The bank has produced copies of the death certificate of the deceased defendant and the marriage certificate of the deceased defendant and the petitioner. If the petitioner's position is that she did not receive the notices, she should have made an application before the District Court and given evidence to prove that fact. The petitioner has not made any application to the District Court. In terms of section 26 of the Mortgage Act, the petitioner is appointed to represent the estate of the deceased defendant for the purpose of the hypothecary action. In terms of section 26 of the Mortgage Act, there is no necessity to make all the heirs as legal representatives in a mortgage bond action. In terms of the proviso to Article 138 (1), no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. In this case, the substantial rights of the parties were settled between the deceased defendant and the bank. There was no application to set aside the consent decree. Restitutio-in-Integrum is an extraordinary remedy and will be granted under exceptional circumstances. (vide Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited vs Shanmugam and another [1995] 1 SLR 55). In that case it was held that relief by way of Restitutio-in-Integrum in respect of judgments of original courts may be sought;",
