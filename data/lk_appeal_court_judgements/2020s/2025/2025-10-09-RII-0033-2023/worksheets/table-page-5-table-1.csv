"The petitioner is the wife of the deceased defendant and the  person to  who"
"probate of the will or letters of administration to the estate of the deceased"
"would  ordinarily  be  issued;  the  petitioner  does  not  dispute  this  fact.  A"
"settlement  was 
reached  between 
the  bank 
and 
the  defendant, 
and"
"accordingly, the rights of the parties had already been determined."
"T
he petitioner has not made any application to the District Court.  In terms"
"of  the  provisions 
in  Section  26  of  the  Mortgage  Act  No.  6  of  1949  as"
"amended,  the  petitioner,  being  the  wife  of  the  deceased  defendant,  is  the"
"most  suitable  person 
to  be  appointed  as  Legal  Representative. 
  The"
"respondent  bank  made  the  application  to  appoint  the  petitioner  on  11-12-"
"2020.  The defendant died on 24-05-2019. Clearly, the bank has made the"
"application under section 26 of the Mortgage Act after the expiration of a six-"
"month period following  the death of the deceased.   The bank  has produced"
"copies  of  the  death  certificate  of  the  deceased  defendant  and  the  marriage"
"certificate  of  the  deceased  defendant  and  the  petitioner.    If  the  petitioner's"
"position  is  that  she  did  not  receive  the  notices,  she  should  have  made  an"
"application  before  the  District  Court  and  given  evidence  to  prove  that  fact."
"The petitioner has not made any application to the District Court.  In terms"
"of section 26 of the Mortgage Act, the petitioner is appointed to represent the"
"estate of the deceased defendant for the purpose of the hypothecary action."
"In terms of section 26 of the Mortgage Act, there is no necessity to make all"
"the heirs as legal representatives in a mortgage bond action."
"I
n terms of the proviso to Article 138 (1), no judgment, decree or order of any"
"court  shall  be  reversed  or  varied  on  account  of  any  error,  defect  or"
"irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or"
"occasioned a failure of justice."
"I
n  this  case,  the  substantial  rights  of  the  parties  were  settled  between  the"
"deceased defendant and the bank.  There was no application to set aside the"
"consent  decree.    Restitutio-in-Integrum  is  an  extraordinary  remedy  and  will"
"be  granted  under  exceptional  circumstances. 
(vide  Sri  Lanka 
Insurance"
"Corporation  Limited  vs  Shanmugam  and  another  [1995]  1  SLR  55).    In  that"
"case  it  was  held  that  relief  by  way  of  Restitutio-in-Integrum  in  respect  of"
"judgments of original courts may be sought;"
