  "keywords": "The Petitioner, as an entrepreneur, had invested money in an apartment housing complex by purchasing shares thereof \u2014 a nuisance caused by certain three-wheel drivers, parking their three- wheels, causing a hindrance at the entrance of the housing complex. The Petitioner made a police complaint for the police to prosecute them for public nuisance. The Magistrate Court refused to entertain a charge based on that; however, entertained a charge of criminal trespass. Writ is sought against the police, compelling them to charge the said three-wheel drivers with public nuisance. Application was refused since evidence has to be considered, and the Petitioner can still obtain relief from the District Court.",
