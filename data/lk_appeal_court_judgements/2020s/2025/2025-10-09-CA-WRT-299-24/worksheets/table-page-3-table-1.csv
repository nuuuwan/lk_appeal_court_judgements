"petitioner company is not a ‘wilful defaulter’, which, according to him,"
"had  not  been  considered  by  the  1st  respondent  prior  to  passing  the"
"resolution. The resolution is passed under and by virtue of Section 04"
"of Act No. 04 of 1990. The enabling provision of the statute does not"
"specify any such requirement or the consideration if the default or the"
"defaulter  is  wilful.  When  there  is  a  default  and  a  demand  has  been"
"made,  the  bank  is  entitled  to  resolve  that  such  property  be  sold  by"
"public auction.  As to whether such  default was  wilful  or otherwise is"
"not a consideration that the statute recognises. The petitioner did not"
"refer to any clause of the agreement either, which provided for such a"
"consideration. In these circumstances, it is settled law that in the guise"
"of interpretation, a Court will not endeavour to interpolate or add fresh"
"or  new  grounds  or  matter  which  such  statutory  provision  does  not"
"provide for."
