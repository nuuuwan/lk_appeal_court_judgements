"granting  possession  of  that  portion  to  the  Respondent.  The  original  Plaintiff"
"thereafter filed a case in the District Court seeking a declaration of ownership"
"and  possession.  However,  during  the  trial,  a  settlement  was  proposed  and"
"accepted by the parties, based on an assumption that the  Respondent owned"
"adjoining  State 
land,  but 
later 
information  obtained 
through  a  Right 
to"
"Information request revealed that the Respondent owned no such land."
"3] The Petitioner argues that the original Plaintiff agreed to the settlement under"
"false pretenses and made an application to set it aside, claiming fraud, mistake,"
"and  misrepresentation.  The  District  Judge  initially  agreed  to  inquire  into  the"
"matter, but after a full hearing, dismissed the Petitioner’s application in an order"
"dated 21.03.2024."
"4] The Petitioner says that although the  learned trial judge acknowledged  the"
"Respondent owned no state land, the decision focused on whether the disputed"
"land (Schedule B) was part of the Petitioner’s land (Schedule A) or part of a grant"
"allegedly  belonging  to  the  Respondent’s  mother.  The  Petitioner  contends  that"
"neither the Respondent's mother nor any other family member was called as a"
"witness and that no legal claim was made by any such third party, rendering"
"the judgment erroneous and unsupported by evidence."
"5]  The  Petitioner  further  states  that  the  Respondent  gained  rights  to  land"
"through a fraudulent settlement, and the District Court erred in not recognizing"
"this  error.  He  emphasis  that  the  core 
issue 
is  the  Respondent’s 
lack  of"
"ownership, and without such a right, the settlement should not be valid."
"6]  The  Petitioner  also  says  that  his  request  for  a  new  survey  commission  to"
"resolve  confusion  in  land  boundaries  was  rejected  by  the  court,  prompting  a"
"separate 
leave 
to  appeal  application 
(UP/H.C.C.A/L.A.09/2024)  currently"
"pending in the Civil Appeal High Court in Badulla."
"7] Basically, the learned trial judge has refused to vacate the settlement on the"
"basis that no fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake occurred when entering the"
"purported settlement."
