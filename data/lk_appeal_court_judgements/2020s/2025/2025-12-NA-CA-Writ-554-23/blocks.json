In paragraph 10 it was pleaded that the wife, the daughter and another child of the eldest son of Subhaya, the wife and two sons of the 1st Petitioner had written to the Divisional Secretary and requested to nominate the 1st Petitioner as the successor and for him to divide the highland among R.P. Dahanpala, R.P. Karunathilka and Gamini Karunathilke in equal shares (P4(a)-(g)). However, no documentary evidence was tendered to Court to establish the relationship between Subhaya or the children and the authors of these letters. It is pertinent to note as per the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners, the 1st Petitioner is the youngest son of Subhaya. However, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner did not address this Court as to the basis this request was made, which is in violation of the provisions pertaining to succession under the LDO. As I have stated above, even if the Petitioners disregarded the nomination made to the permit, then the applicable position would be to resort to the 3rd schedule of the LDO on the basis of the absence of a nominated successor. However, there is no provision in the LDO to nominate the youngest son of the deceased grant holder to succeed in violation of the 3rd Schedule. Further, there is no other material",
