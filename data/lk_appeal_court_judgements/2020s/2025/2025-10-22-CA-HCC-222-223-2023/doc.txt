JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The second and the fourth accused appellants (hereinafter referred to

as “Appellants”) have been indicted in the High Court of Chilaw

together with two others in High Court case number HC 49/13.

The charge in the indictment is as follows:

Charge 01

That on or about, July 27, 2010, at Pothuwatawana in the

District of Puttalam within the jurisdiction of this Court, the

appellants have committed murder by causing the death of

Page 3 of 8

one Senarath Gunasekara Arachchilage Sarath and have

thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 296

of the Penal Code.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has found

the appellants and one other (third accused) guilty of the charge,

convicted the appellants and the other of the same and proceeded to

sentence them to death.

3. Aggrieved by the conviction and the disputed judgment together with

the sentence, the appellants have preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. On July 27, 2010, the deceased, accompanied by PW01 has visited a

boutique located in the bazaar at Pothuwatawana junction to

purchase some provisions. At that time, the fourth accused appellant

has been in the vicinity.

5. He has made contact with another individual via a mobile phone after

which the third accused named in the indictment has arrived at the

location shortly thereafter.

6. The third accused together with the fourth accused appellant have

argued with the deceased and pushed him onto the ground. When the

deceased was fallen on the ground, the first accused and the second

accused appellant too have arrived at the scene.

7. The first accused has proceeded to slap the deceased on his face while

the second accused appellant and the third accused have assaulted

the deceased with sharp edged weapons.

8. Consequent to such attack, the appellants together with the other

accused, have fled the scene.

9. Though the deceased has been rushed to hospital for treatment, he

has succumbed to his injuries.

10. PW06, Dr. W. R. A. S. Rajapaksha, Assistant Judicial Medical Officer

has conducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased and

opined that the cause of death was:

i) Bilateral hemothorax

ii) Multiple stab injuries to the abdomen

The post-mortem report has been presented as an exhibit marked

“P1”.

Case of the appellants

11. The appellants have denied any involvement in the incident referred to

in the charge and have submitted pleas of alibi to support their

claims.

12. When the matter was taken up for argument, the counsel for the

appellants has raised the following ground of appeal.

i) Has the prosecution failed to prove the presence of the appellants

at the scene of the incident and therefore has the case against the

appellants not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt?

ii) Has the learned High Court Judge misdirected herself in applying

the legal principles applicable to the defence of alibi?

Page 5 of 8

13. A plea of alibi is a vindication in a criminal case where the accused

claims he was physically somewhere else at the time of the alleged

crime was committed, making it impossible for him to have been at

the crime scene.

14. Accordingly, in the legal realm, a plea of alibi serves as a critical

defence strategy that asserts the accused person’s presence in a

different location at the time the crime was committed.

15. One fundamental principle surrounding this plea is that there is no

burden placed on the accused to prove his alibi.

16. Instead, the onus rests entirely with the prosecution. It is the

responsibility of the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable

doubt that the accused person was present at the crime scene when

the crime occurred.

17. This principle underscores the presumption of innocence that is

foundational to a justice system.

18. The accused person does not need to offer evidence or witnesses to

corroborate his alibi; rather, the prosecution must work to dispel the

reasonable doubt that may arise from such claim.

19. Hence, if the accused pleads an alibi, the prosecution is challenged to

provide compelling evidence that negates the possibility of the accused

being elsewhere.

20. In Banda and Others v Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 169, F.N.D.

Jayasuriya, J. has held:

Page 6 of 8

“There is no burden whatsoever on an accused person who

puts forward a plea of alibi and the burden is always on the

prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the

accused was not elsewhere but present at the time of the

commission of the criminal offence.”

21. Also in Punchibanda v The State [1973] 76 NLR 293 at 308, G.P.A. De

Silva, S. P. J. (as he was then) has held:

“Where the defence is that of an alibi, the accused person has

no burden as such of establishing any fact to any degree of

probability.”

22. Further when an accused sets up a plea of alibi, J. A. N. De Silva C.J.

in Jayatissa v Attorney General [2010] 1 SLR 279 at 283 has

suggested three postulates;

i) If the evidence is not believed the alibi fails,

ii) If the evidence is believed, it succeeds,

iii) If the alibi evidence is neither believed nor disbelieved, but

would create a reasonable doubt, the accused should get the

benefit of the doubt.

23. Matters relating to a plea of alibi being as discussed above, now leads

me to turn my attention to the disputed judgment.

24. In the trial at hand, the appellants have submitted pleas of alibi. The

learned High Court Judge has outlined these pleas and subsequently

evaluated their credibility.

25. During this evaluation, the learned High Court Judge has applied

various tests commonly used to assess the reliability of evidence,

Page 7 of 8

indicating an implicit expectation that the burden lies on the

appellants to substantiate their alibi.

26. Also, it is crucial to point out that the High Court Judge has not

considered the appellants’ pleas of alibi in a holistic manner. The

thorough examination of the alibi should not only focus on individual

credibility of the plea but also take into account the entirety of the

prosecution’s case.

27. By failing to integrate the alibi alongside the prosecution’s testimonies

and evidence, the learned High Court Judge has inadvertently

overlooked important contextual factors that could strengthen the

credibility of the appellants’ claim.

28. Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has not come to a finding or

concluded that the identity of the appellants at the scene of the crime

had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. This raises

significant concerns regarding the due consideration of the pleas of

alibi.

29. If the prosecution’s evidence regarding the identities are not

compelling, then the pleas of alibi should warrant a more careful

analysis.

30. In light of these observations, it appears that the learned High Court

Judge’s approach has led to a superficial evaluation of the pleas of

alibi.

31. A more balanced consideration that weighs both prosecution’s

evidence and the pleas of alibi is necessary to ascertain whether the

pleas of alibi hold up against the standard of reasonable doubt. The

dismissal of the pleas of alibi without a robust examination against

the entirety of the evidence presented has led to an unjust outcome.

32. In such circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has misdirected

herself regarding the law.

33. The offence for which the appellants are charged is of a serious

nature, carrying the possibility of capital punishment upon conviction.

Given these circumstances, acquitting the appellants solely on the

ground that the learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself

regarding the law is not justified.

34. Therefore, a retrial is necessary to ensure that all legal considerations

are adequately addressed.

I set aside the conviction, the disputed judgment together with the

sentence and order a retrial accordingly.

Retrial ordered.

I make no order regarding costs.

35. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment together

with the original case record to the High Court of Chilaw for

compliance.
