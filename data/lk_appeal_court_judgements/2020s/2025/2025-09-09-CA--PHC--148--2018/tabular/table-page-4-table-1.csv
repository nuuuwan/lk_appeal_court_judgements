"The  main  grounds  upon  which  the  Appellants  preferred  the  revision  application  to  the",""
"High Court of Kegalle are as follows:",""
"1.","Jurisdictional Error"
"","Whether  the 
learned  Primary  Court  Judge  acted  within  the  ambit  of  Section"
"","66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979, in entertaining the"
"","Respondent’s private information and proceeding to make orders in the absence"
"","of a police report confirming a likelihood of breach of the peace."
"2.","Absence of a Proper Prayer"
"","The 
learned  Judges  of  the  Primary  Court  and  the  High  Court  erred 
in 
law 
in"
"","granting relief not prayed for by the Respondent, who had merely sought removal"
"","of  the  obstruction,  without  claiming  any  right  of  way  or  a  right  in  the  nature  of"
"","servitude under Section 69 of the said Act."
"3.","Lack of Locus Standi"
"","The  Respondent 
in  the  Primary  Court  had  no 
locus  standi  to  maintain  the"
"","application, as the alleged dominant tenement was owned by his mother, and he"
"","neither claimed nor instituted proceedings as her representative."
"4.","Failure to Consider Evidence and Objections"
"","The 
learned 
Judges 
failed 
to  properly  evaluate 
the  preliminary  objections,"
"","affidavits,  and  submissions  filed  by  the  Appellants,  disregarded  the  document"
"","marked “X”, and failed to address the position relating to the alternative access."
