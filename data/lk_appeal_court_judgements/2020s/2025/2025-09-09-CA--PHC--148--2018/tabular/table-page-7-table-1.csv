"The Appellants submit that, in the absence of a prayer under Section 69(1) of the PCPA,"
"the Primary Court lacked competence to order the removal of obstructions under Section"
"69(2).  Reliance  was  placed  on  the  observation  of  Her  Ladyship  Madawala,  J.  In  H.A."
"Prasanji Thusitha Kumara Dias & N.L.D.G. Uthika Dias vs Hettiarachchige Dias & Jasinthu"
"Hewage Kalyanawathie Dias,6where  the  Magistrate  erred 
in  ordering  restoration  of"
"possession when such relief was not sought. In support of this position, the Appellant has"
"further  cited Surangi vs Rodrigo,7  a  divorce  case.  However,  in  “Surangi”,  the  basis  was"
"that Section 40(e) of the Civil Procedure Code requires the plaint to contain a demand for"
"the relief claimed."
"While  the  general  rule  is  that  courts  cannot  grant  relief  outside  the  prayer,  Sri  Lankan"
"jurisprudence does recognise limited exceptions, particularly where:"
"1.
Incidental or consequential relief is necessary to give full effect to the main relief"
"sought."
"2.
Equity and justice demand intervention, even if the precise wording of the prayer"
"does not cover it."
"However, this proposition has since been revisited. In Eshan Abeywickrama Danapala v."
"Kalupahana Mesthrige Ariyasena and Another,8His Lordship Justice Janak de Silva clarified"
"that,  in  applications  under  Section  66(1)(b)  of  the  PCPA,  it  is  not  incumbent  upon  the"
"petitioner to specifically pray for restoration of possession. The statutory duty imposed"
"on  the  Magistrate  includes  determining  and  declaring  the  party  entitled  to  possession,"
"irrespective of whether the relief is expressly prayed for."
"Commenting  on  the  decision  in  Dias and another v. Dias and another9,  His  Lordship"
"Justice Janak de Silva has stated;"
"“…with the greatest respect to their lordships in Dias and another v. Dias"
"and another (supra), I hold that in a private information filed under Section"
"66(1)(b) of the Act it is not incumbent on the petitioner to specifically pray"
