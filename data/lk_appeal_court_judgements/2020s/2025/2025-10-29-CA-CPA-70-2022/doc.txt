JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is a revisionary application filed by the 17th Accused Petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this court,

seeking the following reliefs prayed in the petition dated 25 July 2022.

The Petitioner has inter alia prayed for the following reliefs;

a) Issue Notice on the Complainant - Respondent abovenamed;

b) Make an Order to revise and set aside the sentence (PA) pronounced in

relation to the Petitioner on 05th May 2022 in the High Court, Colombo,

Case No. HC 3748/2007 in relation to the 2nd count and substituting the

said sentence with a reduced sentence handed to the Petitioner

c) Grant costs, and

d) Grant such further and other relief

The following facts are relevant to the Application

The Petitioner, along with others, was indicted before the High Court of Colombo

bearing case No. HC 3748/2007 by an indictment dated 07th March 2007 on 20

charges. On 9th January 2012, Senior State Counsel for the respondent amended

the indictment by removing ‘මිනී මැරීමට තැත් කිරීමේ’ from 5,6,7,8,9, and 10 counts.

After the petitioner did not plead guilty, the trial commenced on 09.01.2012 before

the High Court of Colombo. On 24.02.2020, the counsel who appeared for the

Accused informed the court that the petitioner is willing to plead guilty if the

charges for murder are reduced to those punishable under section 297 of the Penal

Code by ending the case No. HC 3748/2007 without further time spent.

Thereafter, on 5 May 2022, the Deputy Solicitor General informed the court that

they are not proceeding against the 4th, 13th, 18th and 21st Accused on the basis

that there is no evidence against them. And the court discharged above above-

accused from all charges; and allowed the indictment to be amended. Accordingly,

the Accused were charged under Section 32 read together with Section 297 of the

Penal Code.

Subsequently, the petitioner, together with the other accused, entered a plea of

guilty to charges 1 to 10 and charge 20. Upon considering the submissions

presented by both parties, the Learned High Court Judge delivered the judgment

on 05.05.2022, imposing the following sentences on the Petitioner:

Charge 1 -A fine of Rs. 5,000

Charge 2 - Eight years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000

Charges 3 to 7 - Two months of rigorous imprisonment for each charge,

along with a fine of Rs. 5,000 per charge

Charges 8 to 10 - A fine of Rs. 1,000 per charge

Charge 20 - Six months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000

The Learned High Court Judge provided the following reasons for imposing the

sentence on the petitioner.

The petitioner’s principal grievance was that the Learned High Court Judge had

not taken into account the mitigating circumstances submitted on behalf of the

petitioner during sentencing. The petitioner contends that the punishment

imposed for the second count is excessive.

Page 5 of 6

We are mindful that the incident occurred at the University of Jayawardenapura

between two groups who were pro-ragging and anti-ragging. According to the

evidence, the deceased, Owitigala Vithanage Samantha, sustained 37 injuries as

a result of the incident. During, several eyewitnesses identified the petitioner as

having assaulted the deceased with a club. Furthermore, we are mindful that the

sentence was imposed by the Learned High Court Judge based on the evidence

presented before him.

We are also mindful that the petitioner was originally indicted on charges of

murder and attempted murder, and evidence was led in support of those charges.

However, on 24th February 2020, counsel for the defence submitted an application

indicating their willingness to plead guilty, provided the charge of murder was

amended to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Following the said amendments, the accused entered a plea to the revised charge,

upon which the Court proceeded to sentence them. It is noteworthy that although

the trial commenced in 2009, no application was made by the petitioner to seek a

reduction of the charge until the conclusion of the trial. The request to plead guilty

to a lesser offence was only submitted after the prosecution had closed its case.

According to the findings of the Learned Trial Judge, the 17th accused bore a

greater degree of criminal liability in comparison to the others and was identified

as the principal offender. The sentence was imposed on 15.05.2022; however, the

revision application was filed on 21.07.2022, following a delay of two months.

Generally, our courts are reluctant to invoke revisionary jurisdiction unless the

petitioner demonstrates exceptional circumstances or satisfies the court that the

impugned order shocks its conscience.

In Wijesinghe V. Tharmaratnam CA 120/80, Decided on 14th October 1986, page

47 at page 49 Srikantha’s Law Reports, Volume (IV) Jameel J. held that,

“Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of court.”

Page 6 of 6

This was further established in Bank of Ceylon Vs Kaleel and others [2004] 1 SLR

284, Per Wimalachandra J,

“In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it; the order complained of is of such a nature which would

have shocked the conscience of court.”

In the instant case, the petitioner has failed to establish any exceptional

circumstances that would warrant the invocation of this Court’s revisional

jurisdiction.

Also, we are mindful that there was a delay of two months in filing this application,

for which the petitioner has provided no explanation.

For the above-mentioned reason, we dismissed the application without issuing the

notice to the respondents.
