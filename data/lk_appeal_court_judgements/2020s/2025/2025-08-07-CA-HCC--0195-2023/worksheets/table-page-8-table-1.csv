"As the victim has shown reluctance to give evidence, the learned High Court"
"Judge had adjourned the trial citing that the trial should be delayed for at"
"least six monthsâ€™ time. The trial only resumed after about 11 months of the"
"initial  trial  and  when  it  did,  the  victim  had  given  evidence  which  was  in"
"conformity with her statement to the police."
"As  stated  above,  through  part  of  the  evidence-in-chief  of  the  victim,  the"
"learned High Court Judge had observed that the victim was not well and was"
"possibly  suffering 
from  a  psychological  disorder,  however,  he  had  not"
"collected any medical report to prove the same. While the victim was giving"
"evidence, her mother, PW2 had been summoned to his chambers as well and"
"the Judge had inquired from PW2 whether the victim was suffering from any"
"disorder at that time. After consulting PW2, the learned High Court Judge"
"had arrived at the conclusion that the trial cannot proceed  at least within"
"the  next  six  months.  Postponing  the  case  for  such  a  long  period  of  time"
"without any plausible reason has caused great prejudice to the Appellant."
"According to the victim, her brother had witnessed the Appellant leaving the"
"room where the alleged offence took place. Further she had stated that her"
"brother had disclosed the incident to her mother."
"PW2,  the  mother  of  the  victim  had  endorsed  the  same  when  she  gave"
"evidence. The relevant portions are re-produced below:"
