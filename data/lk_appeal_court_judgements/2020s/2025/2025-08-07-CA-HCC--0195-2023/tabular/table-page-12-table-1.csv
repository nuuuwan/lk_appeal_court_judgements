"has  been  further  aggravated  due  to  the  prosecutionâ€™s  failure  to  call  an"
"essential witness, the brother of the victim."
"Taking into consideration all these circumstances, I am of the view that the"
"conviction  of  the  Appellant  cannot  be  allowed  to  stand  as  the  prosecution"
"had failed its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. I set aside"
"the  conviction  and  sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of"
"Monaragala dated 11/08/2023 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted"
"from this case."
"Therefore, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Monaragala along with the original case record."
