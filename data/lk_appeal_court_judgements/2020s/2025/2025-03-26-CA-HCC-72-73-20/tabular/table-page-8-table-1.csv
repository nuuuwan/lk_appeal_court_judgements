"17.  A  person  by  the  name  of  Kasun  has  informed  PW9  about  the  incident"
"referred to in the charge in the indictment. The person who provided the"
"first information however has not been listed as a witness. Such a move"
"demonstrates  the  fact  that  the  inquiring  officer  has  not  questioned  the"
"person  named  Kasun  but  has  only  proceeded  to  reduce  into  writing  the"
"statement made by him. The evidence presented indicate that the shop of"
"Lewis located near the site of the alleged attack was closed at that time."
"Further,  Regina  Gunasekara’s  house has had a hedge in front of it. The"
"hedge had obstructed the view of the site of the alleged incident. Hence,"
"resulted  in  Regina  Gunasekara’s  inability  to  see  the  incident.  In  those"
"circumstances,  the  said  Lewis  and  Regina  Gunasekara  were  unlikely  to"
"be able to give worthwhile evidence with regard to the incident stated in"
"the charge."
