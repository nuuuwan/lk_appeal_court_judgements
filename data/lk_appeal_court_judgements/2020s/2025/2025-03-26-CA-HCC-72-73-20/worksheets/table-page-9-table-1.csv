"no burden of proof on the appellant. The evidence on alibi has merely to"
"be weighted in the balance with the prosecution evidence. If the evidence"
"of  alibi  is  not  believed,  it  fails.  If  it  is  believed,  it  succeeds,  but  if  it  is"
"neither  believed  nor  disbelieved  but  creates  a  reasonable  doubt  to  the"
"prosecutionâ€™s case, the appellant is entitled to be acquitted."
