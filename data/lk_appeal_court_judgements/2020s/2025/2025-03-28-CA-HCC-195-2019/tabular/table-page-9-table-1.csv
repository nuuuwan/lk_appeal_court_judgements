"substance.  PW1,  PW5  and 
the 
informant  have 
thereafter  positioned"
"themselves  at  a  location  close  to  a  bridge  in  the  Wellampitiya  area  after"
"18.20  hrs.  The  informant  having  had  very  little  information  with  regard  to"
"the  three-wheel  scooter  that  the  appellant  was  going  to  use  to  transport  a"
"narcotic substance,  he would have had to pay  attention  to each and  every"
"black  coloured  threewheel  scooter  that  went  pass  them.  The 
informant"
"would  have  had  to  engage  in  such  an  exercise  until  22.50  hours  i.e.  for  a"
"period of four hours or more. Further, it being night time, the street lamps"
"had been switched on. Though the street lamps would have illuminated the"
"road, the interior of vehicles travelling along such road would not have been"
"illuminated  by  the 
light  that  stemmed 
from  those  street 
lamps.  Being"
"unaware  of  the  registration  number  of  the  particular  three-wheel  scooter,"
"the informant would have had to identify the particular three-wheel scooter"
"through its occupant. When no evidence  has been led to  establish the fact"
"that the interior of the particular three-wheel scooter was illuminated, it is"
"uncertain  as 
to  how 
the 
informant 
identified 
the  appellant  when 
the"
"appellant  was 
driving 
the 
particular 
three-wheel 
scooter 
in 
such"
"circumstances."
