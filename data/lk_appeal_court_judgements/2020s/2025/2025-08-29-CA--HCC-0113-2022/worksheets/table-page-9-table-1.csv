"32. Another important fact that requires serious consideration is the opinion of the Assistant"
"Government  Analyst  (PW10)  regarding  the  cartridges  recovered  at  the  scene.  His"
"evidence does not suggest that they were fired from the gun marked as P1, which was"
"recovered from the vehicle in which the appellant was travelling. He clearly stated that"
"the marks visible on the cartridges were insufficient for microscopic examination and,"
"therefore, he could not express any opinion as to whether they were fired from gun P1."
"In re-examination, he further clarified that he could not rule out the possibility that they"
"were  fired  from  gun  P1.  Thus,  there  is  no  conclusive  opinion  establishing  that  the"
"cartridges found at the scene were discharged from gun P1. This, in turn, severs a major"
"link in the chain of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution."
