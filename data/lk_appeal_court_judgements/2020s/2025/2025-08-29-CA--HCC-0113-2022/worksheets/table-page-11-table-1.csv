"remainder of his testimony, as there can be no assurance that PW2 clearly perceived the"
"incident. This further undermines the credibility of the prosecutionâ€™s evidence."
"43. The foregoing facts clearly demonstrate that the evidence led by the prosecution was"
"insufficient for the trial Judge to draw an irresistible inference pointing to the guilt of"
"the appellant. Where the prosecution has failed to discharge its burden of proving the"
"case  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the  question  of  the  credibility  or  sufficiency  of  the"
"defence does not arise. In view of the above, it is my considered opinion that it would"
"be unsafe to convict the appellant on the charge of murder, given the insufficiency and"
"fragility of the circumstantial evidence relied upon."
"44. Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence dated 15.07.2015 of the learned"
"High Court Judge of Gampaha. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
