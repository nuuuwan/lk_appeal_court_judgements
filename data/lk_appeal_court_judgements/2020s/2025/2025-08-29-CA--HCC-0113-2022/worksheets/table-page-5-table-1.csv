"","""In  a  case  based  on  circumstantial  evidence, 
the  settled 
law 
is 
that 
the"
"","circumstances  from  which  the  conclusion  of  guilt  is  drawn  should  be  fully"
"","proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature. Moreover, all the"
"","circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain"
"","of evidence. Further, the proved circumstances must be consistent only with the"
"","hypothesis  of 
the  guilt  of 
the  accused  and 
totally 
inconsistent  with  his"
"","innocence."""
"16. Sir Alfred Wills in his book `Wills' Circumstantial Evidence' (Chapter VI) lays down",""
"","the following rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence:"
"(1).","the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and"
"","beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum;"
"(2).","the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact,"
"","which infers legal accountability;"
"(3).","in all cases, whether of direct of circumstantial evidence the best evidence must"
"","be adduced which the nature of the case admits;"
"(4).","in  order 
to 
justify 
the 
inference  of  guilt, 
the 
inculpatory 
facts  must  be"
"","incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation,"
"","upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt; and"
"(5).","if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, he is entitled as of"
"","right to be acquitted."
"17. In Padala Veera Reddy v. State of A.P., AIR (1990) SC 79 it was laid down that when",""
"","a  case  rests  upon  circumstantial  evidence,  such  evidence  must  satisfy  the  following"
"tests:",""
"","(1)   The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn, must"
"","be cogently and firmly established;"
"(2)","Those  circumstances  should  be  of  a  definite  tendency  unerringly  pointing"
