"","2.  The appellant was arrested at a roadblock approximately one hour after the incident,"
"in possession of a gun that still emitted the smell of gunpowder.",""
"","3.  Two empty cartridges were recovered from the scene of the crime, and the cause of"
"","death was established as injuries to the brain and skull caused by gunshot."
"","4.  The gun is capable of firing 12-bore cartridges, and, according to the Government"
"Analyst, a shot had been discharged from this firearm.",""
"","5.  Despite there being no conclusive proof that the cartridges found at the scene were"
"","fired from the gun marked P1, the Judge has noted that it also cannot be ruled out"
"that they were not fired from the gun.",""
"","28. The learned High Court Judge has considered the above circumstantial evidence and"
"","concluded that it was sufficient to establish the guilt of the appellant and inconsistent"
"","with his innocence. However, in a case resting solely on circumstantial evidence, it is"
"","incumbent  upon  the  court  to  determine  whether  the  established  facts  are  not  only"
"","consistent with the guilt of the accused but also wholly inconsistent with any reasonable"
"hypothesis of innocence.",""
"","29. In  this  case,  the  prosecution  placed  much  reliance  on  the  testimony  of  PW2  Sanath"
"","Perera. He testified that he did not see a gun in the appellant's hand during the scuffle;"
"","he  simply  heard  a  gunshot  and  saw  the  deceased  fall.  Furthermore,  there  was  no"
"","evidence to suggest the appellant was armed with a gun when he got out of his vehicle."
"","In this regard, the JMO's opinion on the nature of the injuries and the distance from"
"which the shot was fired is particularly crucial.",""
"","30. His  observations  indicate  that  the  person  who  fired  the  shot  was  at  a  distance  of"
"","approximately  4  to  10  feet  from  the  deceased.  More  importantly,  he  observed  no"
"tattooing,  blackening,  or  burn  marks  on","the  deceased.  This  observation  further"
"","confirmed his opinion on the distance from which the shot was fired, as such marks"
"would have been present if the gun had been close to the deceased.",""
"","31. Thus, it is highly improbable that the appellant shot the deceased, as PW2 clearly stated"
"","that he heard a gunshot and saw the deceased fall to the ground while the appellant and"
"the deceased were in a scuffle.",""
