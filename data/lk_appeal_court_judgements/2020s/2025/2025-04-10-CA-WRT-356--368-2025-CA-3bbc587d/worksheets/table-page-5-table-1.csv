"The Limited Authority of Ex Parte Orders"
"An ex parte order, issued without hearing the opposing party, serves urgent interim"
"relief but carries no precedential weight. Such orders are provisional by nature, often"
"grounded in incomplete arguments and exigent circumstances. They lack the rigorous"
"legal  analysis  characteristic  of  a  binding ratio  decidendi.  For  example,  a  stay  order"
"granted ex  parte to  prevent  imminent  harm  cannot  establish  a  legal  principle.  Only"
"after  a  full  hearing,  where  both  parties  present  arguments,  can  a  court  deliver  a"
"judgment 
capable  of 
setting  precedent.  Thus,  while ex 
parte rulings 
address"
"immediate  needs,  they  do  not  contribute  to  the  jurisprudential  corpus  that  binds"
"future cases."
"In the aforementioned fundamental rights applications before the Supreme Court, the"
"central issue was not whether birth certificates attested by a Justice of the Peace or"
"Notary  Public  were 
legally  valid.  Rather, 
the  Court's  determination 
focused"
"exclusively on whether the Petitioners' fundamental rights had been violated by the"
"rejection of their nomination papers. In its ex parte order refusing the applications, the"
"Supreme  Court  made  passing  observations  suggesting  that  such  certifications  by"
"Notaries Public or Justices of the Peace could not constitute proper certification. These"
"remarks were rendered without the benefit of full argument, as the Respondents were"
"not heard in the proceedings, as such, it is not a determination of the Supreme Court"
"in  regards  to  the  central  issue  at  hand  which  pertains  to  the  certification  of  birth"
"certificates and compliance with the 7th schedule to the Constitution."
"This  position 
is  substantiated 
in 
the  Supreme  Court's  determination 
in Jeevan"
"Thonadaman  V.  Returning  Officer,  Nuwaraeliya, 
(SC  Writ  Application  No."
"33/2025 dated  04.04.2025),  where  certain  petitioners  sought  to  invoke  the  Supreme"
"Court's  writ 
jurisdiction  concerning  the  validity  of  birth  certificates  certified  by"
"Justices  of  the  Peace  or  Notaries  Public  and  adhering  to  the  7th  Schedule  of  the"
"Constitution.  The  Supreme  Court  expressly  declined  to  entertain  the  application,"
"holding that such matters properly fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal."
"This  ruling  makes  abundantly  clear  that  the  Supreme  Court  consciously  abstained"
"from  adjudicating  the  substantive  certification 
issue  and  compliance  to  the  7th"
"schedule of the Constitution, affirmed the Court of Appeal as the appropriate forum"
"for such determinations."
