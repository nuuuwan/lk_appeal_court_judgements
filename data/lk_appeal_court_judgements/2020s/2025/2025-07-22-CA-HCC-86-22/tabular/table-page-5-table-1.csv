"Lord  Wilberforce 
in  Warner  v.  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  (1968)  52"
"Criminal Appeal Report 373.  has considered this matter;"
"“The question, to which an answer is required, and in the end, a jury must answer"
"i
t
,
 is whether in the circumstances the Accused should be held to have possession of the"
"substance, rather than mere control. In order to decide between these two, the jury should,"
"i
n
 my opinion, be invited to consider all the circumstances- to use again the words of"
"Pollock and Wright, possession in the common law, P. 119- the ‘modes or events’ by which"
"the custody commences and the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating"
"them to typical situations, that they must consider the manner and circumstances in"
"which the substance, or something which contains it, had been received, what knowledge"
"or means of knowledge or guilty knowledge as to the presence of the substance, or as to"
"the nature of what has been received, the Accused had at the time of receipt or thereafter"
"up to the moment when he is found with it; his legal relation to the substance or package"
"(
i
ncluding his right of access to it). On such matters as these (not exhaustively stated)"
"they must make the decision whether, in addition to physical control, he has, or ought to"
"have imputed to him the intention to possess, or knowledge that he does possess, what is,"
"i
n
 
fact, a prohibited substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not additionally"
