"aches by the Petitioners"
"T
he Respondents’ main objection is that the Petitioners are guilty of laches. Let me now"
"consider  the  said  objections.  As  per  the  material  before  Court  it  is  undisputed  that  the"
"corpus was acquired in the year 1971. Section 38A publication is dated 28.05.1971 (P27)."
"The Petitioners did not challenge the said Gazette and waited till July 2022 to challenge"
"the said Gazette which is nearly 50 years after the acquisition.  In explaining the delay, it"
"was  submitted  by  the  Petitioners  that initially  the original  owners  did not challenge  the"
"acquisition as they were afraid of political revenge. This argument cannot be accepted and"
"not tenable, as the Petitioners have failed to place any material independent of what the"
"Petitioners  assert,  to  substantiate  any  kind  of  political  interference  in  the  acquisition"
"process.  Further,  the  Petitioners  contended  that  they  had  at  various  times written  to  the"
"Minister of Lands of successive Governments after 2014 pertaining to the irregularities in"
"the acquisition procedure. However, the only document that the Petitioners have tendered"
"to this Court to substantiate this contention is the document marked as P40, which is a letter"
"written by an Attorney-at-Law on the instruction of the Petitioners to the Minister of Lands."
"The said letter does not challenge the acquisition based on a defective Notice pursuant to"
"section 2.  In the said letter, the Petitioners’ only contention is that the land acquired was"
"not utilized for the public purpose it was acquired for."
