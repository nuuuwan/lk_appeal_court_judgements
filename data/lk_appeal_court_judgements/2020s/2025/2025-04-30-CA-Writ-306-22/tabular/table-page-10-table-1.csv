"disclose  any  meaningful  steps  that  have  been  taken  to  challenge  the  acquisition  till  the"
"filing of this Application."
"T
he Petitioners in explaining the delay further contended that they visited the  corpus in"
"2014 and thereafter took steps to appeal to the Minister. The Petitioners failed to establish"
"this position too with any material or independent evidence other than P40, which is dated"
"26.5.2020. Thus, the Court observes that even after 2014, the Petitioners had waited till"
"2022 to file this action and seek for Orders to quash the acquisition Gazette. The Petitioners"
"have  failed  to  explain  this  delay.  It  is  trite  law  that  unexplained  delay  disentitles  the"
"Petitioners from obtaining any relief from this Court."
"I
n Dissanayake v. Fernando (1986) 71 NLR 356  His Lordship Weeramantry J. enunciated"
"that ""where there has been a delay in seeking relief by way of certiorari, it is essential that"
"the reasons for the delay should be set out in the papers filed in the Supreme Court"". Even"
"in the case of Gunasekera v. Weerakoon 73 NLR 262 His Lordship Sirimane J., held that"
"""the  application  should  be  refused  because  the  Petitioner  was  guilty  of  undue  delay  in"
"making the application. In the said matter, a delay of 7 months was considered to be ""too"
"long""."
"A similar line of thinking was adopted in the Abdul Rahuman v. Mayor of Colombo 69"
"NLR 453, and Wijegoonawardena v. Kularatne 51 NLR 453."
"T
his Court has also considered the cases of Biso Menike v. Cyril de Alwis 1982 SLR 368,"
"Seneviratne v. Tissa Bandaranayake and another 1999 2 SLR 341 and Ceylon Petroleum"
"Corporation and others v. Dayanthi Dias Kaluarachchi and others SC Appeal 43/2013"
"decided on 19.06.2019."
"I
n the absence of any valid explanation to purge the delay this Court upholds the objection"
"of delay and I hold that the Petitioners are guilty of latches."
"I
t is also pertinent to note that subsequent to the acquisition and pursuant to section 44 of"
"the Act, the land had been vested with the CWE. The Petitioners have not challenged the"
"said  vesting  certificate.  Further,  after  nearly  4  decades  by  a  Deed  of  Transfer  the  3rd"
"10"
