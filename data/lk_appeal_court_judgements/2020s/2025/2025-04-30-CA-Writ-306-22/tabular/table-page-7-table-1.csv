"The crux of the learned Counsel appearing for Petitionersâ€™ argument is that what can be"
"legally acquired is only the extent stipulated in the section 2 Notice. It is his contention that"
"any extent acquired in excess makes the notice bad in law. It is his argument that what has"
"been stipulated in the notice is only 18 Perches. Hence, the amount acquired has exceeded"
"the  said  extent  and  there  by  the  Notice  becomes  bad  in  law.  However,  as  I  have  stated"
"above the Notice published pursuant to section 2 does not limit the extent to be acquired to"
"be  exactly  18  Perches.  In  view  of  the  above  wording,  in  my  view,  this argument  is  not"
"tenable and has to fail."
