"disclosure would cause an unwarranted invasion of an individual's privacy. This"
"includes  information  that  is  private  to  an  individual  and  not  relevant  to  their"
"public  role  or  the  public  interest.  Thus,  if  the  Public  Authority  spends  public"
"funds 
for 
its  high  officials, 
the  reasons,  performance,  and  breakdown  of"
"expenditures cannot be treated as private information. It is my considered view"
"that personal information is considered to be information that is not connected"
"to any public activity or interest. If the public essence is touched, it can no longer"
"be treated as personal."
"17] This court admits that the disclosure of personal information must not cause"
"an unwarranted invasion of an individual's privacy. This means that information"
"that  is  considered  private  and  sensitive,  such  as  health  records  or  personal"
"financial details, is generally exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act. That is"
"what is meant by section 5(1) of the RTI Act."
"18] In the modern era, the Right to Information laws are crucial for combating"
"corruption  by 
increasing 
transparency  and  accountability  within  public"
"institutions. By granting citizens the right to access information held by public"
"authorities, 
the 
Authorities 
can 
expose 
instances 
of 
corruption,"
"maladministration,  and  abuse  of  power. This  access  to 
information  makes"
"citizens  to  participate  more  effectually  in  public  life  and  hold  those  in  power"
"accountable. To  sustain  a  developed  country,  bribery  and  corruption  must  be"
"curtailed.  Thus,  the  rule  should  be  access  to  information,  and  the  exemption"
"should be refusal."
"19]  At  this 
juncture,  the  court  notes  the  observation  made 
in  Chamara"
"Sampath vs Neil Iddawala, CA/RTI/0004/2021, Decided on: 28-02-2023, by"
