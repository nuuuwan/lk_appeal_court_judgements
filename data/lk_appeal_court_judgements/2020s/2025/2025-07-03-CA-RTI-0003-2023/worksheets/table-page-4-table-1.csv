"6]  Further,  the  Appellant-Respondent  emphasizes  that  under  the  Right  to"
"Information Act No. 12 of 2016, the Petitioner is required to uphold principles of"
"transparency and accountability. The Appellant-Respondent reiterates that his"
"revised  request  limited  to  details  of  foreign  travels,  approvals,  and  expenses"
"related to Mr. Priyantha Fernandez is not exempt under Sections 5(1A) or 5(1G)"
"of  the  RTI  Act,  contrary  to  the  Petitioner’s  position,  and  that  the  refusal  to"
"disclose the requested information is unlawful."
"7] It is seen that in the written submission, the Petitioner acknowledges that the"
"right  to  access 
information  under  Article  14A(1)  of  the  Constitution 
is  a"
"fundamental  right  but  emphasizes  that  it  is  not  absolute  and  is  subject  to"
"limitations detailed in Section 5 of the RTI Act. The Petitioner says that the Act"
"recognizes  while 
promoting 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
public"
"administration,  certain  categories  of 
information  must  remain  confidential."
"Thus, the requested information comes under the purview of section 5 of the RTI"
"Act."
"8] The Petitioner said that as a Listed Company, they submit that the disputed"
"information  concerns  foreign  business  travel  expenses,  which  are  included"
"under the broader category of operating costs covering day-to-day expenses such"
"as  direct  costs,  sales,  marketing,  and  administration  in  the  annual  financial"
"statements disclosed to the public."

]  The  Petitioner  argues  that  the  Right  to  Information 
(RTI)  Act  must  be"
"interpreted in line with Article 14A of the Constitution, which balances the right"
"to 
information  with  necessary  democratic  restrictions, 
including 
individual"
"privacy and broader public interest considerations. The Petitioner states that the"
"specific request for details of the COO's foreign travel expenses does not serve"
"any larger public interest, as all such expenses are already disclosed in aggregate"
"under 
“Operating  Costs” 
in 
the  publicly  available 
financial 
statements."
"Disclosing individual expenses would amount to an unwarranted invasion of the"
"COO’s privacy and fall within the RTI Act’s exemptions under Section 5(1)(a). The"
"Petitioner 
emphasizes 
that 
its 
employees 
are 
contractually 
bound 
by"
"confidentiality  as  per  Article  116(5)  of 
its  Articles  of  Association,  and  the"
"information requested relates to internal business decisions, not public activity."
"Therefore,  the  refusal  of  the  request  was  justified  under  Sections  5(1)(a)  and"
"5(1)(g) of the RTI Act."
"1
0]  I  now  consider  the  merits  of  this  appeal.  The  Petitioner  seeks  protection"
"under section 5(1)(a) and section 5(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, No. 12"
"of 2016. Those sections are reproduced below for clarity."
