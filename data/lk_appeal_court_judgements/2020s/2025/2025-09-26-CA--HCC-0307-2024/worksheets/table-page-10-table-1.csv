"In  recent  years,  we  have  noticed  that  crimes  against  woman  are  on  the  rise.  These"
"crimes  are  an  affront  to  the  human  dignity  of  the  society.  Imposition  of  grossly"
"inadequate sentence and particularly against the mandate of the Legislature not only"
"is  an  injustice  to the  victim  of  the  crime  in  particular  and  the  society  as  a  whole  in"
"general but also at times encourages a criminal. The Courts have an obligation while"
"awarding  punishment  to  impose  appropriate  punishment  so  as  to  respond  to  the"
"society's cry for justice against such criminals. Public abhorrence of the crime needs"
"a reflection through the Courts verdict in the measure of punishment. The Courts must"
"not only keep in view the right of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of crime"
"and the society at large while considering imposition of the appropriate punishment."
"The  heinous  crime  of  committing  rape  on  a  helpless  13/14  year  old  girl  shakes  our"
"judicial conciseness. The offence was inhumane."
