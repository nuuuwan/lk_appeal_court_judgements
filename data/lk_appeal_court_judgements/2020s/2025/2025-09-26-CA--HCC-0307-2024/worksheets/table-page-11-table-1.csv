"living  with  the  Appellant  and  it  was  while  PW1  was  at  the  Appellant’s    place  that  this"
"heinous crime was committed by the Appellant to satisfy his lustful desires."
"31. This is a story involving an incestuous stepfather who took advantage of his relationship"
"with PW1 to satisfy his lustful desires. Needless to say, when PW1 returned to stay with"
"her  mother after the alleged  incidents of sexual abuse by  her  father and grandfather, she"
"must have already  been traumatized and  in a very vulnerable position. She expected her"
"mother's home to be a safe haven."
"32. It  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  the  Appellant  was  40  years  old  at  the  time.  Instead  of"
"affording  PW1  the  necessary  protection  and  care  expected  of  a  responsible  adult,  he"
"exploited  her  helplessness  and  vulnerability  to  satisfy  his  own  desires,  conduct  that"
"cannot be condoned under any circumstances. Furthermore, following the incident, PW1"
"informed  her  mother  of  what  had  transpired;  however,  the  mother  did  not  believe  her"
"account,  which  may  have  driven  PW1 
into  an  even  more  vulnerable  and  helpless"
"situation."
"33. In Archbold: Sentencing Guidelines (2019), Thomson Reuters, on page 274, under the"
"heading of applicability of guidelines on sexual offences, it is stated that;"
"“Starting  points  define 
the  position  within  a  category  range 
from  which 
to  start"
"calculating the provisional sentence."
"………  Once 
the  starting  point 
is  established, 
the  court  should  consider 
further"
"aggravating  and  mitigating  factors  and  previous  convictions  so  as  to  adjust  the"
"sentence within the range. Starting points and ranges apply to all offenders, whether"
"they have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trial.”"
"34. Having  regard  to  the  aggravating  circumstances  set  out  above,  the  mitigatory  grounds"
"advanced  by 
the  defence  do  not  persuade  this  Court  to 
interfere  with 
the  sentence"
"imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge. To  elaborate, the  aggravating  factors  clearly"
"outweigh the mitigating factors, and accordingly, the sentence imposed on the Appellant"
"by the learned High Court Judge does not warrant any reduction."
"35. However, it is important to note that the Appellant has been serving his sentence since 27-"
"11-2024. Therefore, approximately, the Appellant has spent 10 months in remand custody"
"by now."
