"discretion  over  legal  or  title-related  decisions,  which  were  matters  reserved"
"exclusively for HNB’s Legal Department."
"A
ccording 
to 
the  Petitioners, 
the  complaint  giving  rise 
to 
the  present"
"proceedings originated from the 6th Respondent, who deposited a sum of Rs."
"6.25  million  to  settle  outstanding  dues  in  a  loan  account  held  by  the  12th"
"Respondent  company.  The  Petitioners  maintain  that  the  said  deposit  was"
"accepted 
in 
the  normal  course  of  business  and  duly  credited 
to 
the"
"appropriate  account  in  accordance  with  routine  banking  procedure.  They"
"categorically deny any knowledge of or involvement in a scheme to defraud"
"the 6th Respondent, nor did they make any representations or assurances to"
"him regarding the ownership or transfer of the subject property."
"T
he Petitioners further state that the legal title to the mortgaged property was"
"examined  and  approved  by 
the  Bank’s  Legal  Department  prior 
to 
the"
"execution  of  the  mortgage.  The  Petitioners,  as  branch-level  employees,  had"
"neither the legal competence nor the authority to verify deeds or assess title"
"disputes.  When 
the  7th  Respondent 
later  visited 
the  Bank  asserting"
"ownership of the mortgaged property, the matter was referred immediately to"
"the Legal Department of HNB. The Petitioners submit that they acted in good"
"faith  at  all  times  and  followed  the  directions  of  their  superiors  and  legal"
"advisors."
"T
he Petitioners assert that they were not identified as suspects in the initial"
"stages  of  the  investigation  carried  out  by  the  CID.  Their  statements  were"
"recorded on or about February 2012, and no adverse observations were made"
"against them in the CID's report dated 6th August 2012. However, in August"
"2020, over eight years later, the CID, purportedly acting on the instructions"
"of the Attorney General, submitted a further report naming the Petitioners as"
"suspects. The Petitioners contend that the said decision is devoid of factual"
"justification and unsupported by any new material or evidence."
"I
t is the Petitioners’ position that they were not served with any notice, nor"
"were they afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to the"
"issuance of arrest warrants and the imposition of a travel ban by the Learned"
"High Court Judge. They assert that these actions were taken in violation of"
"the principles of natural justice and in breach of their right to a fair hearing."
"The Petitioners contend that the judicial process was invoked against them in"
"a  manner  that  was  procedurally  unfair,  substantively  flawed,  and  grossly"
"prejudicial."
"T
he Petitioners submit that the indictment against them under Section 398"
"of the Penal Code lacks the essential elements of the offence, in particular the"
"presence  of  mens  rea  or  dishonest  intention  to  cause  wrongful  gain.  They"
"maintain that there is no material on record to support a finding that they"
"had,  at  any  point 
in 
time,  knowingly  or  dishonestly  deceived 
the  6th"
"Respondent  to  part  with  his  money.  The  elements  required  to  sustain  an"
"offence of cheating are therefore absent."
