"It  is  thus  the  Petitioners’  position  that  the  decisions  to  name  them  as"
"suspects,  indict  them,  and  subject  them  to  coercive  judicial  process  are"
"arbitrary, unlawful, and ultra vires. The Petitioners accordingly pray that this"
"Court exercise its jurisdiction to issue the writs sought."

st, 7th, 8th, and 9th Respondents"
"T
he 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th Respondents, assert that the Petitioners are not"
"entitled  to  the  reliefs  prayed 
for 
in  the  Petition  and  deny  the  material"
"averments  therein.  They  submit  that  the  impugned  decision  to  indict  the"
"Petitioners in High Court Case No. HC 1998/2020, together with the naming"
"of them as suspects in the related Magistrate’s Court proceedings, was made"
"lawfully  and  upon  due  consideration  of 
the  available  material  by 
the"
"Honourable Attorney General, whose discretion in this regard is not amenable"
"to judicial interference except in the limited circumstances."
"T
hese  Respondents  state  that  the  factual  matrix  giving  rise  to  the  criminal"
"proceedings 
emanates 
from 
a 
fraudulent 
scheme 
involving 
the"
"misrepresentation  of  ownership  of  the  premises  situated  at  No.  562/5,"
"Welikadawatte,  Rajagiriya. 
They 
aver 
that 
the 
6th  Respondent  was"
"fraudulently  induced  by  the  8th,  9th,  and  10th  Respondents,  acting  in"
"collusion with other parties, to part with a sum of Rs. 6.25 million under the"
"belief  that  the  said  property  would  be  transferred  to  him  in  lieu  of  his"
"payment,  which  was  used  to  settle  the  outstanding  loan  owed  by  the  12th"
"Respondent company to Hatton National Bank PLC."
"T
he Respondents submit that the Petitioners, as officers of the Borella Branch"
"of HNB, facilitated and authorised the acceptance and application of the said"
"funds in furtherance of this scheme, without disclosing the true nature of the"
"title  to  the  property,  and  in  disregard  of  the  7th  Respondent’s  assertion  of"
"ownership  which  was  brought 
to 
the  attention  of 
the  Bank.  The  7th"
"Respondent had at the time lodged complaints with the Bank and with the"
"CID, asserting that the mortgage was created using forged documentation."
"I
t is their position that the CID conducted a full and proper investigation into"
"the  matter,  culminating  in  a  report  which  was  referred  to  the  Honourable"
"Attorney  General 
for  consideration.  After  a  detailed  examination  of  the"
"evidence  and  the  statements  recorded,  the  Attorney  General  rendered  an"
"opinion on 17th June 2020 recommending that the Petitioners be named as"
"suspects  and  indicted  for  the  offence  of  cheating  under  Section  398  of  the"
"Penal Code, among others. The Respondents contend that the said decision"
"is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  rather 
founded  upon  sufficient"
"investigative material that reveals the Petitioners' knowledge of the fraudulent"
"nature of the transaction."
"T
he Respondents further assert that there is no legal or factual basis to claim"
"that the Petitioners were unfairly or discriminatorily treated."
