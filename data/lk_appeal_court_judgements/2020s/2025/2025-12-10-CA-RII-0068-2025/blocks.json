The plaintiff-respondent filed an action under the Provisions of the Recovery of Loans (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990, as amended by Act No. 9 of 1994, against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendant-respondents, to recover a loan granted to the 1st defendant. The 2nd and 3rd defendants were guarantors. The 2nd defendant mortgaged two properties owned by him as security. Having considered the plaint, affidavit and the documents filed by the plaintiff, issued a decree nisi on 14-06-2019, against the defendant-respondents. There was a settlement between the parties. However, as the defendants failed to repay the loan as agreed, the District Court allowed the Writ to be executed in relation to the mortgaged property in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. The petitioner in this application states that he and the previous owner of the property described in the schedule to the petition had an agreement to sell the property to the petitioner in 2013 (there is no schedule in the petition). However, the previous owner sold the property (the property described in the schedule to the Mortgage Bond No. 1224 dated 10-05-2018 is hereinafter described as the property) to the 2nd defendant-respondent. Thereafter, the 2nd defendant-respondent and the petitioner entered into an agreement to sell the property to the petitioner. Petitioner further states that he had paid an advance payment to the 2nd respondent. The time stipulated in both agreements to sell the property to the petitioner has lapsed for more",

Therefore, there is no valid agreement to sell the property to the petitioner.
