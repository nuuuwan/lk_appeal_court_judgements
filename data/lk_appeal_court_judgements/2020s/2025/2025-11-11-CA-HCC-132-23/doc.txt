JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") was indicted before the

High Court of Embilipitiya on one count of criminal trespass and two counts of Grave

Sexual Abuse committed against a minor, Patabandi Gallage Sanduni Nisansala, during

the period from 13th November 2016 to 11th December 2016 which is punishable under

Section 436 of the Penal Code and Section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code, as amended by

Act No. 22 of 1995, Act No. 29 of 1998, and Act No. 16 of 2006.

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence through 5 witnesses and marked the

production from P1-P2 and thereafter closed its case. Upon the conclusion of the

prosecution's case, the Accused made a dock statement in his defence.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by a judgment dated

15.02.2023, found the Accused guilty on all three counts. Consequently, for the 1st count,

7 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10000 and in default of the fine, 12

months of simple imprisonment. For the second and third counts, 15 years of rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10000 and in default of the fine, 12 months of simple

imprisonment were imposed to run concurrently. Additionally, an amount of Rs 100,000

Page 3 of 9

in compensation to the victim in a default of 12 months of rigorous imprisonment was

ordered.

Aggrieved by the aforementioned conviction and sentence, the Accused preferred this

appeal before this Court. The grounds of appeal advanced by the Accused are as follows:

1. The criteria adopted by the Learned Trial Judge in evaluating the evidence

purely based on surmises and conjectures is completely contrary to the evidence

led at the Trial.

2. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to consider the inconsistent

evidence of Prosecution Witnesses and the evidence of PW1 which fails the text of

spontaneity.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the medical evidence which

contradicts the evidence of the Prosecutrix.

Facts and circumstances of the case are as follows,

According to PW 1, Sanduni Nisansala, the victim in this case, was fourteen years old at

the time the alleged incident occurred. On the evening of the first occasion, she was alone

at home, and the Accused, who was her neighbour, entered the room in her house and,

while conversing with her, all of sudden caressed the body of the prosecutrix. In the chest

area, to be specific. Following this, the witness exited the house and informed her mother

upon her arrival. According to the witness, the Accused remained there for approximately

four to five minutes in her house and returned to his residence. After the incident, the

witness’s mother informed the accused’s wife of the events.

The witness further stated that she is often alone at home when her mother takes her

sister to classes, and that she occasionally visits the accused's residence to converse with

his wife. On a later occasion, the witness went to the accused’s house while his wife was

not present. During this visit, the accused allegedly caused the witness to lie down, lifted

her clothing, and touched her breast area. He then removed her skirt and positioned

himself on top of her. According to the testimony of PW 1, the accused placed his male

organ on top of her vagina. The witness resisted pushing the accused away and returned

to the house. Further, she has noticed discharge in her skirt. PW1 disclosed the incident

to her mother upon her arrival.

The PW 1 states that the complaint was initiated through a telephone call to the police,

following which officers visited her residence. After being transported to the police station

by jeep, a medical examination was conducted. We note that she was not sure about which

incident took place at first.

The witness denied the statement recorded in the police report that the accused had

hugged her from behind. She also refuted the allegation that, on the first day, the accused

attempted to take her to bed and made physical advances toward her, as documented in

the same report. The defense counsel highlighted a contradiction concerning a second

alleged incident that reportedly occurred one week after the first, involving inappropriate

physical contact. Additionally, the counsel pointed out inconsistencies in the witness’s

statement to the Police regarding her decision to disclose the incident to her mother while

failing to inform the accused’s wife. She also claimed that the accused had attempted to

initiate a relationship with her. Finally, the witness denied the defense counsel’s

Page 5 of 9

suggestion that she had associated with another boy six months after filing the police

complaint.

During the testimony of PW 02, Anushika Gunasiri, the mother of the victim it was

revealed that the accused had purchased a portion of their land. Approximately six

months later, she observed a suspicious relationship between the accused and PW 01.

After PW 01 denied the existence of such a relationship, PW 02 used a phone recorder to

gather evidence and confirmed her suspicions. She then informed the accused’s wife and

played the recording for her. Subsequently, PW 02 reported the matter to the police via

the emergency call center. The witness confirmed that the incident occurred on or before

10.12.2016, and PW 02 provided a formal statement to the police two days later, on

12.12.2016.

Upon analyzing the evidence of PW1 and PW2, a contradiction emerges between the two

witnesses.

According to PW 03, Dr. Sisira Seneviratne, has examined the prosecutrix. According to

the history provided by PW-01, the accused became acquainted with the prosecutrix

within a month and attempted to initiate a relationship with her. On the first day of their

interaction, the accused allegedly touched the breast area of the prosecutrix. During the

medical examination, on 14.12.2016 Dr. Seneviratne observed signs consistent with

frequent sexual activity. Additionally, upon examining the victim’s genital area, he noted

old tears in her hymen.

The witness stated that such injuries could result from vaginal penetration or the

insertion of a finger. It is also noted that, according to the history provided by the

prosecutrix, she has not engaged in any sexual activity with any other individual.

Upon analyzing the testimony of PW1, it is evident that she did not mention any act of

penetration. In contrast, the medical evidence presented by the examining doctor

indicates old tears in the hymen, which suggests prior penetration. Notably, the doctor’s

findings do not align with the brief history provided to him by the prosecutrix.

Furthermore, she failed to disclose or explain the injuries to her hymen, and her testimony

does not offer any account of how these vaginal injuries may have occurred. This

inconsistency raises a serious question regarding the credibility and truthfulness of her

statement before the court.

Furthermore, PW2—the mother of the prosecutrix—stated that she became suspicious of

the prosecutrix’s behavior towards the accused and subsequently lodged a complaint with

the police. In contrast, the prosecutrix testified that she herself disclosed the incident

directly to her mother. These inconsistencies highlight a clear discrepancy between the

accounts of PW1 and PW2.

According to the testimony of Prosecution Witness 4 (PW4), WPC Sunethra Nishanthi,

she recorded the statements of PW1 on 12th December 2016 and 14th January 2017.

During cross-examination, the witness acknowledged that the second alleged incident

occurred approximately one week after the first.

PW 8, On 12.12.2016 Police Inspector Dinesh Kumara Herath received a call from PW 2

concerning the incident. PW 4 had recorded statements from PW 01 and proceeded to the

prosecutrix’s residence. The accused was subsequently arrested on 13.12.2016.

Investigations later revealed that the incident had taken place roughly three weeks prior

to the arrest. During cross-examination, the witness testified that, according to the police

Page 7 of 9

statement, PW2 had expressed suspicion that the accused had approached PW1 while she

was alone.

The accused, in the dock statement, stated that he had purchased the land from PW1’s

family in 2016. He further alleged that the family had subsequently demanded him to

vacate the property, and that the complaint was lodged after he moved to the new

residence. The accused denied all allegations of sexual assault levelled against him.

In light of the observations made by PW3 during the examination of PW1, particularly

concerning the nature of the alleged frequent sexual activities, the Learned High Court

Judge concluded that such findings may be attributed to acts involving the insertion of

the accused’s finger or tongue. The Court found this inference relevant in assessing the

medical and testimonial evidence. Accordingly, it is pertinent to reproduce the relevant

portion of the judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judge for clarity and context.

When we analyse the evidence of the prosecutrix, she has stated that the Accused touched

her breast area on the first day and on the second day kept his penis on her genital area.

She never uttered a word about the penetration, and when the doctor examined the

prosecutrix, he observed that there were injuries in her vagina and there was a partially

healed tear over the hymen. Also, the doctor has stated there is evidence which was

completable with manipulation of the vagina with penetration.

When we compare the doctor’s evidence and the prosecutrix evidence doctor’s evidence

does not corroborate with the evidence of the prosecutrix. It is well established that in

sexual abuse cases, the courts expect the prosecutrix’s evidence to be sufficiently

convincing. When the testimony of the prosecutrix is not convincing, then courts expect

the corroboration of evidence.

Page 8 of 9

When we analyse the evidence of PW1, she is not sure about which incident took place

first. I am mindful that our courts place great emphasis on the consistency of witness

testimony. In the present case, the evidence provided by the prosecutrix lacks consistency.

The evidence given by the doctor does not corroborate the testimony of the victim about

the sexual act, which gives a different picture of the prosecutrix's version. We note that

it is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim of a sex offence

if the evidence is not convincing.

In Premasiri V. The Queen 77 N.L.R 86 it was held: -

"In a charge of rape, it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated

evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such a character as to

convince the Jury that she is speaking the truth."

In Sunil and another V. The Attorney General 1986 1 S.L.R 230 it was held that:-

"Corroboration is only required if the witness requiring corroboration is otherwise

credible. If the evidence of the witness requiring corroboration is not credible his

testimony should be rejected and the accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of

a witness's evidence should not be used as a process of inducing belief in such

evidence where such evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman victim of

a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could be acted on even

in the absence of corroboration."

In Gurcharan Singh v. State of Haryana, AIR 1972 SC 2661, the Court observed that in

cases of this nature, it generally seeks some form of corroboration. The ruling stated as

follows:

“As a rule of prudence, however, court normally looks for some corroboration of her

testimony so as to testify its conscience that she is telling the truth and that the

person accused of rape on her has not been falsely implicated.”

Above three judgements were considered by H.N.J. Perera, J. (as he was then) in

Wjethunga Mudiyanselage Heen Banda v Attorney General, CA 129-2013, decided on

07.10.2015 held that,

‘The short history given to Doctor does not appear to be compatible with her

testimony in the High Court.

Page 9 of 9

………………..

I hold that the medical evidence does not support the evidence of the prosecutrix

that she has been raped. Thus the case depends only on the evidence of the

prosecutrix.

………………………..

I hold that the evidence of the prosecutrix is not credible’

Considering above facts and the judgements cited above my considered view is that the

evidence of the prosecutrix is not credible, and it is not safe to act on her evidence. Since

the evidence of the prosecutrix is not reliable and cannot be believed, it is unsafe to allow

the conviction to stand.

I therefore set aside the conviction and the sentence and acquit the Accused.

Appeal Allowed.
