"“The doctrine of legitimate expectation is basically aimed at the prevention"
"of  administrative  authorities 
from  abusing 
their  discretionary  powers"
"against 
the 
legitimate  expectations  of 
individuals,  which  have  been"
"engineered  by  the  prior  conduct  of  the  authorities.  The  Petitioner  has"
"studied 
in  a  university  which  has  been  duly  recognized  by 
the  1st"
"Respondent. It is evident that, the 1st Respondent’s act of recognizing the"
"university  has  engineered  a  legitimate  expectation  of  the  Petitioner.  The"
"legitimate  expectation  of  a  person  ensures 
that, 
the  administrative"
"authorities are bound by their undertakings and assurances unless there"
"are compelling reasons to change the policy subsequently. It further ensures"
"legal certainty which is imperative as the people ought to plan their lives,"
"secure in the knowledge of the consequences of their actions. The perception"
"of  legal  certainty  deserves  protection,  as  a  basic  tenet  of  the  rule  of  law"
"which this court attempts to uphold as the apex court of the country. The"
"public perception of legal certainty becomes negative when the authorities"
"by  their  own  undertakings  and  assurances  have  generated  legitimate"
"expectations of people and subsequently by their own conduct, infringe the"
"so generated expectations."
"Lord Denning has stated  that, (in “Recent Development  in  the Doctrine of"
"consideration’’)  ‘A  man  should  keep  his  words.  All  the  more  so  when"
"promise is not a bare promise but is made with the intention that the other"
"party should act upon it’. The principle of legitimate expectation is connected"
"with  an  administrative  authority  and  an 
individual. 
It  emerges 
in  an"
"instance where an administrative authority affects a person by depriving"
"him of some benefit or an advantage which he had been in the past been"
"permitted  by  the  decision  maker  to  enjoy  and  which  he  can  legitimately"
"expect  to  be  permitted  to  continue.  Thus  as  an  essence,  administrative"
"authority must respect the expectations. There are essential ingredients of"
"legitimate expectation. Some are:"
