"jabbing with a closed fist. She had not seen any weapon and it appears"

"accused. Therefore, she had been able to observe the initial assault on"
"the  deceased.  Then  she  had  seen  the  two  accused  run  away  and  the"
"deceased fallen on the ground. It is subsequently that she had observed"
"blood on the deceased. She had been approximately 2 â€“ 3 feet away from"
"the  place  of  the  assault.  PW-01  has  seen  this  from  the  light  that"
"emanated from a nearby building and she admits that the surrounding"
"was not very well lit but there was sufficient light. There had also been"
"a torch."
