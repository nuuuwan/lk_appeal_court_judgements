"HCC/0061-0062/2019"
"(f) the Jury should be told that in order to justify the inference that"
"a particular prisoner was actuated by a common intention with the"
"doer  of  the  act,  there  must  be  evidence,  direct  or  circumstantial,"
"either of pre-arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a declaration"
"showing  common  intention,  or  some  other  significant  fact  at  the"
"time of the commission of the offence, to enable them to say that a"
"co-accused had a common intention with the doer of the act, and"
"not merely a same or similar intention entertained independently"
"of each other— 47 N. L. R. at p. 375, 48 N. L. R. 2 95;"
"(g) the Jury should also be directed that if there is no evidence of"
"any common intention actuating the co-accused, or any particular"
"co-accused, or if there is any reasonable doubt on that point, then"
"the charge cannot lie against anyone other than the actual doer of"
"the criminal act—44 N. L. R. 370, 46 N. L. R. 135, 473, 475;"
"(h) in such a case such co-accused would be liable only for such"
"criminal acts which they themselves committed;"
"(i) the Jury should also be directed that the mere fact that the co-"
"accused were-present when the doer did the criminal act does not"
"per se constitute common intention, unless there is other evidence"
"which justifies them in so holding— 45 N. L. R. 510 ; and"
"(j) the Judge should endeavour to assist the Jury by examining the"
"case against each of the co-accused in the light of these principles.”"
