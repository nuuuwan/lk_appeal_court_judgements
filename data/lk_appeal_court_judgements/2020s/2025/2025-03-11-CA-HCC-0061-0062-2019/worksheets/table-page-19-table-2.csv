"jury be directed as following vital and fundamental principles:"
"“(a) the case of each prisoner must be considered separately;"
"(b) that the Jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that"
"he  was  actuated  by  a  common  intention  with  the  doer  of  the"
"criminal act at the time the alleged offence was committed;"
"(c) they must be told that the benefit of any reasonable doubt on"
"this matter must be given to the prisoner concerned— 47 N. L. R."
"at p 375;"
"(d) the Jury must be warned to be careful not to confuse “Same or"
"similar  intention  entertained  independently  of  each  other”  with"
"“Common intention”;"
"(e) that the inference of common intention should never be reached"
"unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances"
"of the case—A. I. R. 1945 P. C. 118;"
