"Identity of the 1st accused"
"28. Did the trial judge err in the evaluation of the reliability as far as the"
"identity of the 1st accused is concerned? As stated above, the 1st accused"
"clearly  being  a  person  who  was  familiar  and  known,  PW-01  had  no"
"difficulty in recognizing him. As at the point of incident, PW-01 had been"
"2-3 feet away when she saw the 1st accused grappling with the deceased."
"She  clearly  claims  to  have  recognised  that  it  was  no  one  but  the  1st"
"accused who attacked the deceased with ‘a closed fist.’ The issue raised"
"in  this  appeal  on  behalf  of  the  first  accused  is  that  PW-01  had  not"
"observed a knife. If there was sufficient light, she ought to have seen the"
"weapon and identified the same, which she had not been able to do. The"
"submission is that due to lack of sufficient light, she could not have seen"
"and  recognised  the  assailant.  The  learned  trial  judge  had  concluded"
"otherwise."
