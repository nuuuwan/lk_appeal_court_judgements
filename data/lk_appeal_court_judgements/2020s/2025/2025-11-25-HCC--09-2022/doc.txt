JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Appellant’) was indicted before the High Court

of Colombo for Possession and Trafficking 9.5 g of Heroin under Section 54 (a) (d) and Section 54 (a)

(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No. 13 of 1984, as amended.

At the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through four witnesses and marking productions P1-P9

and thereafter closed its case. The Appellant, in his defence, gave evidence from the witness box. Upon

conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the Appellant guilty on both counts and

imposed life imprisonment on 21.10.2021.

Aggrieved by the aforementioned conviction and sentence, the Appellant preferred this appeal before

this Court. The grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant are as follows:

1. The Failure to deploy a female officer to assist in the conducting of the raid

2. The illegal drugs came to be taken into custody whilst it was buried in the neighbouring

premises

Page 3 of 10

3. Failure to establish the fact that the Accused Appellant was the owner of the house wherein the

heroin came to be recovered. There is an irregularity with regards to the notes of the Excise

Inspector Janaka

4. The prosecution version fails the test of probability

5. The Prosecution failed to establish the case beyond reasonable doubt

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW 2, Excise Inspector Janaka Perera, testified that on 18.06.1998, a private informant provided a tip-

off. According to the information received, a consignment of heroin belonging to Kapila was concealed

in a house located at No. 33, Gardens, Thotalaga.

Upon receiving this information, with the advice of PW 1, the witness informed the private informant

to provide the exact date and location where the consignment of heroin would be available. Acting on

this advice, the informant contacted the witness on 19.06.1998. The witness then organized a raid,

instructing the informant to arrive at the Excise Department around 11.30 a.m. on his motorbike, and

informed the OIC accordingly. Following PW 1’s instructions, eleven other officers, together with the

witness, took part in the raid. The witness left the department at 12:00 p.m., and while proceeding

towards the cinema hall, the team spotted the informant. At that point, the witness directed the informant

to lead them.

After halting the vehicle at the market on Ferguson Road, the informant led the team on foot through

the place, passing several shanties. The informant pointed out a shanty where the appellant was standing

to the witness, that this was the location where the consignment of heroin was concealed and thereafter

left the scene.

We note that the witness admitted that they did not make any inquiry to ascertain the true owner of the

house. Instead, upon the Appellant’s revelation, they proceeded to arrest her.PW 1 then approached the

Appellant and requested her to cooperate by handing over the heroin concealed in her house.

The Appellant appeared frightened and pointed to a table, beneath which there was a pot. She removed

the pot, revealing a hole underneath that contained a cellophane bag. The Appellant handed the bag to

PW 1, and upon inspection, it was found to contain seven cellophane bags. Inside those seven bags were

Page 5 of 10

644 packets, which PW 1 showed to PW 2, who identified the contents as heroin. The Appellant was

arrested at 12:45 p.m., and the witness admitted that the material was in the possession of PW 1 until

they took it to the office, where it was weighed and recorded as 28 grams, and subsequently seized the

production.

On the same day, the production and the Appellant were handed over to the Maligakanda Magistrate’s

Court at 3:40 p.m. Thereafter, on 10.07.1998, pursuant to an order of the Learned Magistrate, the

production was handed over to the Government Analyst by PW 1.

During cross-examination, the witness stated that after halting the vehicle, three officers, together with

the witness, followed the private informant. The witness further testified that only the witness and PW

1 went to the place where the informant pointed out that heroin was concealed. The defence then

questioned the witness regarding the route taken during the raid, the manner in which it was conducted

with the assistance of the informant, and the subsequent handing over of the production to the

Magistrate’s Court and thereafter to the Government Analyst. Furthermore, the witness asserted that

the Appellant acknowledged residing in the said house.

PW 1, Excise Inspector Prasanna Pathirana, acting upon the information provided by PW 2, informed

the OIC and organized the raid. In giving evidence, the witness corroborated the testimony of PW 1.

Upon reaching the Appellant’s residence, the informant pointed out as the place where Kapila’s heroin

is concealed. After the witness requested that the Appellant allow them to take Kapila’s heroin, the

Appellant pointed out and produced the heroin.

Further, the witness affirmed that he and PW 2 sealed the production, which was thereafter handed over

to the Magistrate’s Court by PW 2.

During cross-examination, the defence questioned the witness regarding the manner in which the raid

was conducted and the route taken to reach the Appellant. The witness admitted that he could not hear

what the informant had said to PW 2. When the counsel for the Appellant inquired about the ownership

of the house, the witness stated that the Appellant herself had acknowledged that the house belonged to

her.

During cross-examination, the witness denied the defence suggestion that the place where the

production was concealed belonged to a person named Kapila. He further rejected the claim that Kapila

had contacted him, stating that he would surrender to the police.

PW 3, Government Analyst K.P. Sivarajan, testified that the productions handed over by PW 2 on

10.07.1998 were properly sealed at the time of delivery, and upon analysis, confirmed that the pure

weight of the production was 9.5 grams.

Upon the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecution, in the Dock statement, the Appellant asserted

that on the day of the incident, three officers came to her house and inquired about Kapila. She stated

that she replied that she did not know, after which the officers took her outside. The Appellant then

pointed to a house located three houses away from her own as Kapila’s house. She further claimed that,

in the absence of a female officer, the officers took her to their office, where her fingerprints were

obtained, despite no evidence being found in her house. It is noted that this version was not elicited or

advanced by the defence in the course of cross-examination.

The Learned High Court Judge, upon analyzing the evidence presented before him, held that in this type

of case, the prosecution is required to prove possession and not ownership. It is therefore appropriate to

reproduce that portion of the judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judge.

The issue for determination is whether the prosecution has established that the Appellant was in

exclusive possession of the production. In the present case, PW 1 informed the Appellant that they

already knew the location of the production and requested that she show it.

Page 169 of the brief,

ප්‍ර : ඔබ ම ානවද කිව්මව්?

උ : කාන්තාවට පැහැදිලිව ප්‍රකාශ කළා ම ස්ථානමේ කපිල න ැති පුද්ගලයාට අයිති මහම ායින්

This indicates that the officers had prior knowledge of the location. The question that arises is how they

obtained this knowledge, whether it was from the Appellant herself or from another source.

There is no evidence before this Court to demonstrate who possessed the keys to the house or how entry

was effected. We are also mindful that the informant did not mention the Appellant’s name at any stage.

These gaps in the evidence cast doubt on the prosecution’s claim of exclusive possession of heroin by

the Appellant.

According to Sir Hari Singh Gour in his book "The Penal Law of India," he has stated: "Possession to

be criminal must be actual and exclusive. For criminal liability does not apply to constructive

possession.”

Justice De Sampayo considered this proposition in the case of Banda v. Haramanis, 21 NLR page 141.

Justice De Sampayo held:

“ ………The question is whether either of the accused could be convicted under the provision

in question. Mr. Jayawardene has referred me to page 1892 of the second volume

of Gour, where the learned author states, with reference to authorities, that "possessi on to be

criminal must be actual and exclusive, for criminal liability does not attach to constructive

possession. . . . . From this it follows that, where property is found in a house in the possession

Page 8 of 10

of more than one inmate, none of them could' be said to be in possession of it for the purpose

of this offence, unless there is evidence of exclusive conscious control against them.”

The above Judgment was referred by Justice F.N.D. Jayasuriya, in Case of Muttaiaah Sriyalatha

Saraswathie v. Attorney General, CA 212/95, Decided on 30.06.1999, Appellate Court Judgements

1999 Unreported. F.N.D. Jayasuriya, J held that;

“The conduct of the Accused is somewhat suspicious as referred to by the Learned Trial Judge,

that fact per se is insufficient to hold that the prosecution has proved that the heroin in question

was in the actual, exclusive and conscious possession of the Accused.”

When applying the above dictum, it becomes evident that there is no material to establish that the

Appellant had actual and exclusive possession over the heroin in question. The prosecution's case rests

primarily on the information provided by the private informant. According to the evidence presented

at the trial, we note that PW01 has informed the Appellant where the production was kept. Thereafter,

she went to the house and took the product from the place where it was hidden. But there is no indication

that the house was occupied by the Appellant. We are mindful that the informant implied that the

production, which belonged to Kapila as “එක්ත ා නිවසක කපිල කියලා මකමනක්ට අයිති මහම ායින්”.

There is no evidence indicating that, when the informant led the officers to the house, he identified

whose property it was.

A similar circumstance was considered by His Lordship S. Thurairaja PC, J in Sundaralingam Sankar

Kumar v. Attorney General, CA 12/2008, Decided on 14.03.2018, held that;

“Following factors raise concern of this court;

a. Heroin was not found in the physical possession of the Appellant.

b. Arrest and recovery of the production happened on two different dates.

c. Production was recovered at a different place.

d. There is 27 (1) Statement regarding the recovery of the production was recorded.

e. Keys were found at a place where others had access, especially Sivakula.

f. The place where the heroin was recovered was accessible to others other than the

Appellant.

g. Evidence relating to the recovery does not reveal the cupboard was exclusively or normally

used by the Appellant. Such clothes and other personal belongings.

h. Sivakula who had the key was neither produced as a suspect nor as a prosecution.

We couldn't find answers to the above questions in the brief nor in the submissions. It is the

content of the Respondent's Counsel that the Appellant had ample knowledge of the substance.

Page 9 of 10

Presuming, hypothetically, that's correct. Then the issue arises of whether knowledge alone is

sufficient to convict a person instead of exclusive possession.” (Emphasis Added)

We note that the evidence adduced at the trial is primarily circumstantial in nature. The prosecution has

relied upon such circumstantial evidence in seeking to establish the charges against the accused. While

the informant tip and the subsequent raid form the foundation of the case, no direct evidence has been

produced to demonstrate that the accused had actual and exclusive possession of the narcotics. The

prosecution’s case, therefore, rests on inferences drawn from the surrounding circumstances. We are

mindful that there is no evidence before this Court as to the manner in which the house was opened.

In cases based on circumstantial evidence, any inference of guilt must be the sole, compelling, and

inescapable conclusion that the accused committed the offence. Upon evaluating the evidence presented

at trial, the only logical and unavoidable conclusion is that the Appellant had exclusive possession of

the production, to the exclusion of all others.

The above dictum was considered by Aluwihare, PC, J in Junaiden Mohamed Haaris v. Attorney

General, SC Appeal 118/17, Decided on 09.11.2018:

“Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this appeal, it should be

borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on circumstantial evidence to establish the

charges, for the reason that there were no eyewitnesses to substantiate any of the charges

against the Accused-Appellant. Thus, it was incumbent on the prosecution to establish that the

‘circumstances’ the prosecution relied on, are consistent only with the guilt of the accused-

Appellant and not with any other hypothesis.

Regard should be had to a set of principles and rules of prudence, developed in a series of

English decisions, which are now regarded as settled law by our courts.

The two basic principles are-

i. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved facts, if it is

not, then the inference cannot be drawn.

ii. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable inference from

them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude other reasonable inferences,

then there must be a doubt whether the inference sought to be drawn is correct (per

Waterm eyer J. in R vs. Blom 1939 A.D. 188)”

With the evidence presently before the Court, the crucial issue that arises is whether such evidence is

sufficient to sustain a conviction against the accused on the charges of trafficking and possession. The

Page 10 of 10

prosecution has relied primarily on the information provided by the informant and the subsequent

recovery of the narcotics.

Considering the above evidence, it is observed that the private informant categorically stated that the

heroin belonged to Kapila. The informant led the team to the location, pointed out the house as the place

where the goods were concealed, and thereafter departed. At no point did the informant refer to the

Appellant, and it was explicitly stated that the goods were attributed to Kapila. Furthermore, the

evidence does not disclose whether any person resided in the house where the Appellant was allegedly

staying, nor does it establish the occupation of the premises. We also note that there is no evidence

before this Court as to the manner in which the house was opened, or how many individuals had access

to it. In addition, PW 1 entered the house on the basis that the witness was aware of the presence of

productions therein, and stated that they should be handed over without resistance.

In light of the foregoing factors, a reasonable doubt arises as to whether the Appellant had actual,

exclusive, and conscious control over the heroin or whether another individual may have had access to

the premises before the raid. Consequently, the prosecution has failed to establish exclusive possession

of the drugs in question.

Upon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution has failed to establish, beyond a reasonable

doubt, that the Appellant was in exclusive possession of the drugs.

In the light of the foregoing, the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge

are hereby set aside. The Appellant is acquitted of the charge on which he was convicted.

Appeal Allowed.
