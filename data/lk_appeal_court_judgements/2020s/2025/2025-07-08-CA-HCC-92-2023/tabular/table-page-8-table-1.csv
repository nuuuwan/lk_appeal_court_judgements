"act referred to in the charge has been allegedly committed on her when"
"she was just 12 years old. Being subjected to such sexual abuse, the"
"experience  would  naturally  be  harrowing  to  her.  PW01  would  have"
"preferred not to talk about the incident. She would have naturally liked"
"to forget about the incident as soon as possible. Further, PW01 when"
"giving  evidence  before  the  High  Court,  would  have  been  aware  of  the"
"negative  association  between  her  and  the  society  due  to  the  incident"
"she was testifying to. The testimony of PW01 shows that PW01 has been"
"reluctant to testify to the incident at the trial before the High Court. She"
"has therefore been a reluctant witness. In those circumstances, a fair"
"amount of coaxing and persuasion would have been needed to extract"
"the relevant evidence from her."
