"22.  It is also contended that, the inherent features in the window of the"
"room in which the alleged incident took place has not been corroborated"
"by PW08, the investigating officer who visited the scene of the incident."
"23.  It is the testimony of PW08 that the particular window was a wooden"
"one. However, since he has visited the scene during the day he has not"
"proceeded  to  switch  on  the  light  inside  the  room  and  probe  as  to"
"whether a person could see into the room as stated by PW03. However,"
"the testimony corroborates the fact that the room in which the alleged"
"incident took place was fixed with a wooden window, though there had"
"been a minor lapse on the part of PW08 as to the manner in which he"

"earlier  and  seen  the  appellant  engaging  in  a  sexual  act  with  PW01."
"PW03  has  immediately  informed  his  parents  of  the  incident  he  saw."
"Thereafter,  the  parents  have  rushed  to  the  appellants’  house  to  free"
"PW01  from  the  appellant.  In  those  circumstances,  the  contradiction"
