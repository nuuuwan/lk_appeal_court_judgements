"9.  Dr. M. R. Dissanayake, has stated that the cause of death of the deceased"
"was 
internal  hemorrhage  resulting 
from  a  stab  wound.  He  has  also"
"concluded  that  the  corresponding 
injuries  sustained  to  the 
internal"
"organs of the deceased were necessarily fatal."
"Case of the appellant"
"10. The appellant has asserted that he is unaware of the incident mentioned"
"in 
the  complaint  and  has  maintained  his 
innocence 
regarding  any"
"criminal activity."
"Ground of appeal"
"11.  Then 
the  matter  was 
taken  up 
for  argument.  The  Counsel 
for 
the"
"appellant has urged the following ground of appeal,"
"i) 
The learned High Court Judge has not considered the"
"contradictions and omissions in the evidence of PW01"
"and  also  the  contradictions  between  the  evidence  of"
"PW01 and PW02 (inter se)."
"12. The  evaluation  of  contradictions  or  omissions  plays  a  pivotal  role 
in"
"determining the reliability of evidence and credibility of witness testimony."
"Material  contradictions  refer  to  discrepancies  in  statements  or  evidence"
"that  are  significant  enough  to  undermine  the  integrity  of  a  case.  These"
"inconsistencies  can  arise  from  conflicting  testimonies  or  variations  in"
"physical evidence."
"13. On 
the 
other  hand, 
omissions  pertain 
to 
the  absence 
of 
critical"
"information  that  might  significantly 
influence  the  outcome  of  a  case."
"When a  witness fails, to disclose relevant facts or details, it can create a"
"distorted understanding of the circumstances surrounding the case."
