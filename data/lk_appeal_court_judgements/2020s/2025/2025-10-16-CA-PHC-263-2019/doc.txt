D. Thotawatte, J.

This appeal is against the order dated 05th December 2019 made by the learned HighCourt Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province holden in Kalmunai,exercising revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution, wherebythe said Court vacated the order of the learned Magistrate of the Magistrate’s Court ofPothuvil made in favour of the Complainant–Respondent–Appellant (hereinaftersometimes referred to as the “Appellant”) under the provisions of the Primary Court’sProcedure Act, No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “PCP Act”).

The Appellant initiated proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court of Pothuvil, filinginformation by affidavit under Section 66(1)(b) of the PCP Act, on 13-06-2016, against theRespondents-Petitioners-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the‘Respondents’). France Lloyd Caminda, a foreign national and a director of the Appellantcompany, asserts that the land in dispute was purchased on behalf of the company in2010 and was in its possession until 15-04-2016, when the 3rd respondent, ThevendrarasaPulendran, accompanied by several persons, unlawfully entered the premises andintimidated Varatha RajaThambiraja (According to the translation of his affidavit dated 08-06-2016), who was employed as the watcher, into leaving the land, thus dispossessing theAppellant. Further, the Respondents have installed “other persons” on the land,preventing repossession by the Appellant.

The 3rd Respondent has not clearly stated the origin of his claim over the land in dispute,but has stated that he had been in occupation of the disputed land since 25-03-2016.

The learned Magistrate, acting as the Primary Court Judge, having inquired into thematter, delivered the Order on 07-10-2016 holding that the Appellant is entitled to thepossession of the subject land.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondents had invoked the revisionaryjurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province holden in Kalmunaiagainst the order of the learned Magistrate. The learned High Court judge, havinginquired into the matter, had set aside the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge andallowed the application for revision filed by the Respondents and had restored theirpossession to the land in dispute. Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned HighCourt Judge dated 05-12-2019, Appellant has appealed against the said order of thelearned High Court of Kalmunai to set aside the said order and to affirm the order of thelearned Magistrate dated 07-10-2016.

The nature of an inquiry and purpose under Section 66 was clearly defined bySharvananda J. (as he then was) in Ramalingam v. Thangarajah1, which continues to beregarded as the leading authority on the subject.

In an inquiry under Part VII of the Primary Court’s Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, relatingto a dispute over possession of land where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely,

the principal issue is who was in actual possession of the land on the date of filing theinformation under Section 66.

Under Section 68 (1), the Judge is required to determine the party who was in possessionof the land on the date of filing of information and, under Section 68 (2), to declare thatperson as entitled to continue in such possession. Section 68(3) applies only where it isclearly established that a party was forcibly removed within two months immediatelypreceding the filing of information, in which case that dispossessed person would bedeemed to have been in possession on the date of filing, notwithstanding the fact that hewas dispossessed.

The Judge’s duty is therefore to ascertain which party was, or is deemed to have been, inpossession on the relevant date and to protect that possession, even against the rightfulowner, until eviction is effected by due process of law. Accordingly, even a trespasser orsquatter who has been in possession for more than two months prior to the filing ofinformation is entitled to legal protection. The inquiry should thus be confined to actualpossession on the date of filing, save in cases of forcible dispossession within two monthspreceding that date. In such an event for restoration under the PCP Act, to be possible,the dispossession should have happened within the two-month period and not before.Even if a person with no demonstrable lawful connection to the property had forciblyentered and dispossessed a long-term possessor merely one day prior to thecommencement of the two-month period, such dispossessed party would not be entitledto restoration under the PCP Act.

In the instant case, there is no dispute as to the fact that on the date of filing ofinformation, it was the Respondents who were in possession of the subject land. Undersuch circumstances, the duty of the learned Magistrate would have been to ascertainwhether the Appellant had been forcibly dispossessed from the relevant land within twomonths immediately preceding the filing of information. Appellant’s claim is that thecompany was in possession of the land since purchasing the same in 2010 till thecompany was dispossessed on 15-04-2016 by the Respondents. The Respondents'position is that although the land belonged to them, the Appellant had installed awatcher on the land on 23-03-2016. However, as this watcher employed by the Appellantleft the land on 25-03-2016, the Respondents regained possession and have been inuninterrupted possession from 25-03-2016 onwards.

6

If the Respondents’ claim to have been in uninterrupted possession from 25-03-2016 isaccepted, it would mean that they had been in possession prior to the commencementof the two-month period and, as such, would be entitled to remain in possession till afinal determination is made by a competent court.

After affidavits, supporting documents, and written submissions were filed by the parties,the learned Magistrate delivered the order on 07-10-2016 in favour of the Appellant,accepting the position submitted by affidavits that the Appellant was dispossessed fromthe land on 15-04-2016, demonstrating that the dispossession happened within thestatutory two-month period.

Although I agree with the learned Magistrate that the affidavits are sufficient to make adetermination without an investigation into the matter, I am unable to understand onwhat basis the learned Magistrate decided to accept the affidavits submitted on behalf ofthe Appellant, as they are totally contrary to the contents of the police statements madeby the relevant deponents.

With regard to the incident which resulted in his removal from the disputed land, thewatcher Thambiraja has made two Police statements and filed an affidavit in the Court.

a) Watcher Thambiraja, in his affidavit dated 08-06-2016, submitted to the

Magistrate Court of Pothuvil, had stated:

I.that a person named Banduprema recruited him to watch (guard) thesubject land on 23-03-2016.II.when he was serving in that capacity, several persons entered the land andevicted him from the land after forcibly detaining him inside a cabana andthreatening him.III.that before he was evicted on 15-04-2016, it was the Appellant whopossessed and maintained the subject land.

b) However, in a statement made to the police on 25-03-2016, the watcher

Thambiraja had stated:

I.that on that day (25-03-2016) whilst he engaged in his duties, some peoplecame in a vehicle and told him to leave and removed the items in the room.II.that he left the land, and the intruders did not say anything else to him.

7

c) In the second statement made to the police on 25-04-2016, the watcher

Thambiraja had stated:

I.that he was engaged to watch (guard) the subject land from 23-03-2016.II.that two persons came in a car on 28-03-2016 (it is unclear whether thedate given is 25 or 28; however, it is clearly in the month of March) andtold him to remove the “stuff”.III.that the intruders did not admonish him. Further, he left willingly, and theintruders gave him a lift to his nephew’s house.

It is pertinent to observe that the watcher, Thambiraja, has never asserted that he re-entered the land after leaving on 25-03-2016, nor has he alleged that his statements tothe police were inaccurately recorded. Accordingly, his affidavit dated 08-06-2016, inwhich he claims to have been evicted on 15-04-2016, is false and appears calculated tomislead the Court into believing that the alleged dispossession occurred at a later date,thereby bringing the matter within the scope of the provisions of the PCP Act.

R. K. Banduprema, a local director of the Appellant who appears to have employed thewatcher, Thambiraja, in his affidavit dated 08-06-2016, stated that some individuals cameto the subject land, threatened the watcher, Thambiraja, broke the locks of the entrancegate and the cabana, and “stayed there”.

It is significant that R. K. Banduprema, in his affidavit, avoids mentioning the date whenthis incident occurred, and also the language of his averments (averment 06 of theaffidavit) appearsto give the impression that he was present at the time of the incident.

R. K. Banduprema’s statement to the police dated 25-04-2016 states that he was calledto the residence of the watcher, Thambiraja’s nephew, and found Thambiraja wasfrightened, and Thambiraja told him that some persons came in a red car and told him toleave. Further, those persons had brought him to his nephew’s residence with the itemsthat they had removed from the premises. It is clear from this statement that R. K.Banduprema was not a witness to the incident.

Although I agree that the Appellants could exercise possession through their agent oragents, there is no evidence that the watcher, Thambiraja, R. K. Banduprema, or anyoneelse from the Appellant Company attempted to enter or reassert their control over thesubject land after 25-03-2016, and as such, for all intents and purposes, the Appellanthas been dispossessed on 25-03-2016.

8

Appellant’s claim that they were dispossessed on the 25-04-2016 appears to be based onthe fact that the Respondents had installed their own watcher on the subject land onthat day. There is no doubt that this irrational claim is also motivated by the sole purposeof bringing the date of dispossession within the two months immediately preceding thefiling of information.

It appears that the contradictions between the affidavits and the statements of thecrucial witnesses had escaped the attention of the learned Magistrate when arriving athis determination. I agree with the learned High Court Judge’s view that “…… there is noiota of evidence to satisfy the court that there was a, “Forcibly Dispossession" during theabove said, "Relevant Period".

In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere withthe Order dated 05-12-2019 made by the learned High Court Judge.

Hence, the Appeal is dismissed with costs.
