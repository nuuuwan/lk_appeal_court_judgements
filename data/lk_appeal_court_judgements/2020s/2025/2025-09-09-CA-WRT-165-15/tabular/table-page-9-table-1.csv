"It  is  observed  that  the  Divisional  Secretary  had  failed  to  identify  or  to"
"provide  such  alternative  land  for  the  Petitioner  who  had  lost  her  land."
"Nevertheless, 
the  5th  and 
the  6th  Respondents  had  been  allocated"
"alternative 
lands  as  reflected 
in 
the 
letters  marked  P4  and  P4a  as"
"facilitated  by  the  Clause  2.2.1.1.  of  the  Circular  R1.  Said  Clause  2.2.1.1"
"states that “If people have lost their encroached state lands after residing"
"in encroached state lands in the relevant areas and they are qualified to"
"get 
lands;  they  should  also  be  considered  when  alternative 
lands  are"
"given”.  The granting of the portion of the land claimed by the Petitioner"
"to 
the  5th  and 
the  6th  Respondent  who  have  been 
identified  as"
"encroachers is not in line with the guidelines specified under the Circular"
"R1.  The  Divisional  Secretary  has  not  given  any  valid  reason  to  deviate"
"from his original decision to allocate alternative lands for the 5th and the"
"6th Respondents. Since the 1st to 4th Respondents have identified the 5th"
"and 
the  6th  Respondents  as  encroachers 
(see  P3)  and  had  acted"
"accordingly, decision to allocate portion of the land in dispute to 5th and"
"6th  Respondent  (P4,  P4a,  P5  and  P10)  based  on  the  aforesaid  reasons"
"cannot  be  accepted.  Therefore, 
I  am  of  the  view  that  the  decision"
"reflected in documents P5, P9 and P10 are without a valid reason and is"
"unjustifiable."
"The 
letter  P3,  which  states  that  steps  would  be  taken  to  oust  the"
"encroachers (i.e. the 5th and the 6th Respondents), had been issued by the"
"Provincial  Land  Commissioner  to  the  Divisional  Secretary  with  a  copy  to"
"the Petitioner. Furthermore, the letters marked P4 and P4a issued by the"
"Divisional  Secretary  to  the  5th  and  the  6th    Respondents  informing  the"
"decision to grant alternative land were also copied to the Petitioner. Upon"
"careful perusal of the contents of the letters P3, P4 and P4a, it is apparent"
"that  such 
letters  create  a 
legitimate  expectation 
in  the  mind  of  the"
"Petitioner  of  placing  her  in  possession  of  the  entire  land.  However,  the"
"subsequent  actions  and  the  conduct  of  the  1st  to  the  4th  Respondents"
"frustrate such legitimate expectations of the Petitioner."
"The 1st to 4th Respondents submit that the land referred to in Permit P1"
"had been given for residential purposes and to maintain the garden. The"
"1st  to  4th  Respondents  submit  that  the  Petitioner  had  failed  to  take"
