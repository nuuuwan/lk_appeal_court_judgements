"the  next  round  of  war 
in  2006  had  prevented 
the  Petitioner 
from"
"effectively pursuing the matter."
"After  the  end  of  the  war  situation 
in  2009,  the  Petitioner  had  made"
"repeated representations to the 2nd Respondent seeking an early remedy"
"pertaining to the issue. Thereafter, the Petitioner had received a copy of a"
"letter dated 30.05.2014 (P3) addressed to the 2nd Respondent by the 1st"
"Respondent in which it had been mentioned that it was decided that the"
"said 
land  be  granted  to  Mr.  V.  Ponnuthurai  (father  of  Petitioner)  and"
"instructions had been given to two persons who had encroached into the"
"land to quit at the end of the harvest period failing which legal action be"
"taken  to  oust  them.  It  had  been  mentioned  that  the  said  letter  P3  is"
"followed pursuant to an inquiry held in respect of the dispute referred on"
"06.05.2014. Further, said letter had indicated that action would be taken"
"to provide them with land and with a housing scheme at another place."
"Thereafter, 
the  Petitioner  had 
received  copies  of 
the 
letters  dated"
"20.06.2014 (P4 and  P4a) sent to the 5th and the 6th Respondents by the"
"2nd  Respondent 
informing  them  that  they  should  vacate  the 
land 
in"
"dispute  in  compliance  with  the  decision  arrived  at  the  inquiry  held  on"
"06.05.2014, and alternative lands will be provided to them."
"Despite 
the  above  directions, 
the  5th  and 
the  6th  Respondents  had"
"remained in the land, and no action had been taken to evict them by the"
"1st and the 2nd Respondents. However, subsequently, the 2nd Respondent"
"by  the  letter  dated  12.08.2014  (P5)  had  informed  the  Petitioner  that  as"
"per  the  decision  taken  on  11.07.2014  at  the  mobile  service,  out  of  the"
"entire  land  of  ½  acre,  ¼  acre  will  be  allotted  to  the  Petitioner  and  the"
"remaining  ¼  acre  will  be  allotted  to  the  5th  and  the  6th  Respondents  by"
"which  each shall be entitled for 20 perches. The Petitioner  had  rejected"
"and protested the said decision of the 2nd Respondent to divide the said"
"land  in  such  a  manner  as  such  decision  is  arbitrary,  unreasonable  and"
"ultra vires."
"Thereafter, 
in  response 
to 
the  written  representations  made 
to  the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Lands  by  the  Petitioner,  the  Petitioner  had"
"received  a  copy  of  a 
letter  dated  03.09.2014  (P9)  addressed  to  the"
"Provincial Land Commissioner by the 2nd Respondent, Divisional Secretary,"
