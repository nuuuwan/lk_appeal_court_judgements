"Furthermore,  the  Respondents  state  that  they  are  not  in  a  position  to"
"verify how the permit devolved to the Petitioner since the entirety of the"
"relevant records are  unavailable. The Petitioner by producing the Permit"
"marked  P1  has  established  to  the  best  of  her  ability  that  she  has  rights"
"over the land in view of the same. In the event where the Petitioner has"
"submitted documents to prove her entitlement to the land and if the 1st"
"to  4th  Respondents  are  not 
in  a  position  to  admit  such  position,  the"
"burden  of  submitting  evidence 
in 
rebuttal 
lies  upon 
the  1st 
to  4th"
"Respondents. Rights of a party should not be prejudiced owing to a failure"
"or omission on the part of an administrative authority. Further, it appears"
"that  the  consequential  actions  taken  by  such  Respondents  demonstrate"
"that  they  have  acted,  conceding  the  interests  of  the  Petitioner  over  the"
"land.  Thus, 
in  the  given 
instance  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  cannot"
"approbate  and 
reprobate 
their  position.  Hence, 
the  1st 
to 
the  4th"
"Respondents  are  estopped  from  taking  up  a  contrary  position  claiming"
"that the Respondents cannot verify the rights of the  Petitioner with the"
"available  documents.  As  such,  merely  because  the  Respondent  failed  to"
"verify the rights of the Petitioner and to produce evidence in rebuttal, this"
"Court is not inclined to reject the existence of the Permit P1, its contents"
"or the rights of the Petitioner upon it. Therefore, I am of the view that the"
"transfer of the rights to the Petitioner over the P1 cannot be denied."
"The  Petitioner  also  moves  this  Court  to 
issue  a  Writ  of  Mandamus"
"compelling the 1st to the 4th Respondents to perform their statutory duty"
"of  evicting  the  5th  and  6th  Respondents  from  the 
land 
in 
issue.  The"
"Petitioner 
contends 
that 
the  5th  and 
the  6th  Respondents,  being"
"encroachers and trespassers, are liable to be dealt under the provisions of"
"Section 168A(1) of the LDO. Section 168A of the LDO is as follows;"
