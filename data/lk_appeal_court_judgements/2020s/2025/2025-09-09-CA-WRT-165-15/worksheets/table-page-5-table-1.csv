"stating that action would be taken to grant the land to the Petitioner after"
"receiving  a 
response 
from 
the  Commissioner  General  of  Land.  The"
"Petitioner  states  that  the  stance  reflected  in  the  aforesaid  letter  P9  is"
"untenable and had been issued in bad faith. Subsequently, the Petitioner"
"had received the letter dated 24.12.2014 (P10) signed by the 3rd and 4th"
"Respondents, stating that, as per the decision taken at the mobile service"
"in Kilinochchi, action would be taken to grant ¼ Acre to the Petitioner and"
"20 Perches to the 5th and 6th Respondents each."
"The  Petitioner  states  that  the  decisions  taken  by  the  2nd,  3rd,  and  4th"
"Respondents, as reflected in the letters marked P5, P7, P9, and P10, are"
"ultra vires and are subject to the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Further, it"
"was submitted that there is a statutory and public duty cast upon the 1st"
"to the 4th Respondents to take swift measures to evict the 5th and the 6th"
"Respondents  from  the  land  in  issue  and  to  duly  place  the  Petitioner  in"
"possession  of  the  entire  land  in  issue.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  had"
"invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by seeking inter alia mandate in the"
"nature  of  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  decisions  contained  in  the"
"letters marked P5, P9 and P10, a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st to"
"the 4th Respondents to perform their statutory duty of evicting the 5th and"
"6th  Respondents  from  the  land  in  issue  and  to  place  the  Petitioner  in"
"possession 
thereof

restrain  1st 
to  4th"
"Respondents  causing  the  division  of  the  land  in  issue  and/or  alienating"

"It is on the common grounds that the Petitioner’s father had been issued"
"a  Permit 
in 
respect  of 
the 
land 
in 
issue.  However, 
the  1st 
to  4th"
"Respondents  challenge  the  authenticity  of  the  transfer  of  possession  of"
"the land in subject to the Petitioner on basis that the said Permit P1 only"
"carries  a  name  and  a  signature  and  does  not  bear  the  seal  of  the"
"Divisional 
Secretary.  Furthermore, 
the  Respondents 
state 
that 
two"
"signatures  are  required  for  the  amendment  of  the  name  of  the  permit"
"holder in the Permit P1, as the same had been amended twice. However,"
"the  Respondents  have  failed  to  demonstrate  the  existence  of  any  legal"
"requirement 
to 
the  effect 
that 
two  signatures  are  required 
for 
the"
"amendment of the name of the permit holder as reflected in Permit P1."
