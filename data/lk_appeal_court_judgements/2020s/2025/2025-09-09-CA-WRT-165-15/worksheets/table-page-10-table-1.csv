"residence or to maintain garden as required under the Permit P1. Thus, it"
"is  position  of  the  said  Respondents  that  the  Petitioner  has  violated  the"
"condition contained in the Permit P1.  However, the Petitioner claims that"
"she was unable to make any improvement on the land in dispute, due to"
"the  war  situation  of  the  area.  Considering  the  facts  that  there 
is  a"
"consensus  among  the  parties  that  a  civil  war  prevailed 
in  the  area"
"concerned at the relevant time and the Petitioner was displaced owing to"
"such  conditions,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  failure  of  the  Petitioner  to"
"develop  the  land  is  justifiable.  Further,  the  encroachers  occupying  the"
"land in question would prevent the Petitioner from developing the land."
"At  the  same  time,  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  have  never  taken  steps  to"
"cancel  the  Permit  P1  in  view  of  the  alleged  violation  as  required  by  the"
"law.  Considering  the  above  discussed  exceptional  circumstances  which"
"prevented  the  Petitioner  from  complying  with  the  conditions  of  the"
"Permit P1, the failure of the Petitioner to reside in or develop the land in"
"issue should be excused."
"Accordingly, I am of the view that the surrounding circumstances of this"
"application  suggest  that  the  2nd  to  4th  Respondents  have  failed  to  duly"
"exercise their discretion in arriving at the impugned decisions reflected in"
"documents  P5,  P9  and  P10.  Thus, 
I  am  also  of 
the  view 
that 
the"
"assessment  of 
facts  by 
the  1st 
to  4th  Respondents 
is  ultra 
vires,"
"unreasonable  and 
irrational.  Similarly,  the  1st  to  the  4th  Respondents'"
"failure to take action as required under Section 168A of the LDO amounts"
"to a breach of a public duty."
"In view of the reasons given above and the circumstances of the instant"
"application  Court  issues  Writ  of  Certiorari,  Writ  of  Mandamus  and  the"
"Writ of Prohibition as prayed for in the amended Petition. I order no cost."
"Application is allowed."
