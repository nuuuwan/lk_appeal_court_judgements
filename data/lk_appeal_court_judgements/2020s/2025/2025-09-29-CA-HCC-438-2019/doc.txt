Penal Code.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has

with the sentencing order had preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

Case of the Prosecution

5. On the date of the incident, i.e., April 12, 2001, the deceased, the

appellant, the first accused named in the indictment and several others

have congregated before making their way to St. Mary’s School. Upon

arriving at the entrance, the deceased, the appellant, the first accused,

and PW06 (who has also been among those who congregated) have

entered the school premises. Once inside, PW06 has witnessed the

appellant and the first accused attacking the deceased with sharp edged

weapons (knives).

6. Tragically, the deceased has succumbed to the injuries sustained

during the assault.

7. Dr. S.V.Pathirana, Judicial Medical Officer of Colombo, has conducted

the post-mortem examination and the findings are documented in the

post-mortem report, which has been marked as පැ-1.

Case of the Appellant

8. The appellant, along with the first accused, have maintained that

though they were in the vicinity, they had no knowledge of the alleged

assault.

Ground of Appeal

9. When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for

the appellant urged the following ground of appeal;

1. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the

evidence of PW06 (eye witness) is not credible in light of the

contradictory nature of his evidence.

10. The learned Counsel for the appellant has raised a concern regarding

the testimony of PW06 before the High Court. Specifically, that PW06

has stated that he witnessed the first accused and the appellant,

assault the deceased with sharp edged weapons (knives).

11. However, the learned Counsel points out that this critical detail has not

been mentioned by PW06 during the inquest conducted by the learned

Magistrate. But he only stated that he heard the screams of the

deceased from the direction to which the deceased was escorted by the

first accused and the appellant.

12. Nonetheless, it is important to note that this alleged contradiction, has

not been formally marked by the Counsel representing the appellant at

the trial.

13. The proper procedure in marking contradictions is set out in section

145 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895.

“…This section contemplates that when a witness is to be

contradicted his attention must be first drawn to the fact of

having made a previous statement, and thereafter, more

specifically, to the parts of the statement which are to be used

for the purpose of contradicting him. It is only after that, the

actual writing with which the witness was contradicted with, can

be proved.”

14. Further the post-mortem report marked as පැ-1 indicates that the

Judicial Medical Officer has identified 26 medical injuries on the body

of the deceased. Among those injuries, fifteen has been classified as

stab injuries and four as cut injuries. The characteristics of these

injuries are consistent with the account provided by PW06, who has

stated that the first accused and the appellant attacked the deceased

with sharp edged weapons, specifically knives.

15. The Counsel for the appellant has also raised concerns regarding a

discrepancy in the testimonies of the witnesses. Specifically, while

PW07 has indicated that PW08 was present among those who

approached the entrance of the school, PW06 has asserted that PW08

was not at the location during that time. This inconsistency it is argued

undermines the credibility of the narrative of PW06.

16. However, it is important to know that the discrepancy in question does

not pertain directly to the incident involving the offence itself.

17. Importantly, PW08, does not provide any details regarding the assault

on the deceased and does not significantly impact the overall

understanding of the events surrounding the incident.

18. In evaluating the various accounts, it is essential to discern, which

elements directly influence the core facts of the case. While differing

recollections can affect witness credibility, the relevance of such

discrepancies must be carefully considered in the broader context of

the testimony regarding the offence in question.

19. Further, the prosecution has the latitude to call certain number of

witnesses, it is not a fixed requirement. Instead it is a calculated choice

aimed at effectively establishing the case.

20. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance No.15 of 1895 emphasizes that

the number of witnesses required to substantiate a claim or fact is not

fixed or premeditated. The principle allows for flexibility in the

presentation of evidence. It acknowledges that the testimony of a single

witness can be sufficient to establish the truth of a fact, depending on

the credibility of that witness. The focus shifts from the quantity of

evidence to its quality. A credible witness can provide more compelling

evidence than multiple witnesses who may lack reliability.

21. In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the

conviction and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing

order.

22. I dismiss the appeal and make no order regarding costs.

Appeal dismissed.

23. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo for compliance.
