"Respondents. The 1st to 5th Respondents have admitted that it had occurred due to"
"their inadvertence(P14). Conversely, even if it had been registered before the death"
"of  Bebinona,  such  a  nomination(P5)  would  not  have  any  effect  as  said  Bebinona"
"had  no  power  to  nominate  a  successor

"Ordinance.  Section  48B(2)  specifies  that  any  nomination  made  by  a  spouse

"contravention of the provisions of subsection (1) shall be invalid. As such, this Court"

"of such spouse,  devolves as prescribed in rule 1 of the Third Schedule. Aforesaid"
"Section 72 is as follows:"
"‘If  no  successor  has  been  nominated,  or  if  the  nominated  successor  fails  to"
"succeed,  or  if  the  nomination  of  a  successor  contravenes  the  provisions  of"
"this Ordinance, the title to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-holder"
"who  at  the  time  of  his  or  her  death  was  paying  an  annual  instalment  by"
"virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the holding of an owner shall, upon"
"the death of such permit-holder or owner without leaving behind his or her"

"The 6th Respondent claims that he, being the eldest son of Bodisena and Bebinona,"
"and in the absence of a valid nomination, rightfully succeeds to the land in dispute"

"6R1 dated 23.10.2013, the Divisional Secretary has granted ownership of the land"
"to the 6th Respondent in accordance with Sections 49 and 72 of the Ordinance. I"
