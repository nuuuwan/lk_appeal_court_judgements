"Land Acquisition Act, found in the Parliamentary Hansard Report, dated"
"04th January 1979 (page 104), which is as follows:"
"â€œUnder the present Land Acquisition Act it is not possible for me,"
"as Minister, to divest the State of the ownership of land even where"
"representations are made by an Hon. Member of Parliament that"
"the land is not being used for the purpose for which it was taken"
"over. There is no provision under the present law to hand the land"
"back to the owner or possessor of it at the time it was taken over."
