"Section 39A (4) (b) provides that the right, title, or interest over the land"
"of the person interested that existed at the time of the vesting Order shall"
"be  deemed  not  to  have  been  extinguished.  Similarly,  it  provides  that"
"such  right,  title,  or  interest  thereonwards,  shall  be  revived  valid  and"
"enforceable  notwithstanding  the  vesting  Order.  This  puts  it  beyond"
"doubt  that  until  and  unless  a  divesting  Order  is  published  in  the"
"Gazette, the heirs will have no legal entitlement of inheritance. As stated"
"above,  upon  the  divesting  Order  being  made,  such  persons’  right  of"
"inheritance will revive in view of the deeming provisions. Thus, legally,"
"the prospective heirs will have no standing or a legitimate basis to object"
"to the divesting on the said basis."
