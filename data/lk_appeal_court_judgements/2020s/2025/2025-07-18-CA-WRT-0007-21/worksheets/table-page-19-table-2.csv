"divesting of a part of the land vested is not lawful and it should be the"
"entirety  of  the  land  covered  by  the  vesting  Order.  S.  N.  Silva,  J.,  in"
"Kingsley Fernando vs. Dayaratne and Others (supra), observed that;"
"“Section 39A (1) empowers the Minister to “divest” the State of the"
"land so vested by the vesting order. The vesting order referred to"
"is that made under Section 38. It is clear from the papers filed in"
"the previous application that there was one vesting order in respect"
"of the entire extent of 12 acres. Therefore, I am inclined to agree"
"with the submission of Learned Counsel for the Respondents that"
"the  divesting  was  to  relate  to  the  entire  extent  covered  by  the"
"vesting order. This view is further supported by Section 39A (4) (a)"
"which  provides  that  upon  a  divesting  order  that  land  shall  be"
"deemed never to have vested in the State by virtue of the vesting"
