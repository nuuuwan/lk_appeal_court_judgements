"38. As  opposed  to  that  in  De  Silva  vs.  Atukorale,  Minister  of  Lands,"
"Irrigation,  and  Mahaweli  Development  and  Another  (supra),  the"
"divesting was ordered in respect of a part of the original land acquired."
"In the said application, a total of seven allotments of land, consisting of"
"19 acres, 1 rood and 23.8 perches in extent were acquired. That too, had"
"been co-owned land. Possession had been taken and handed over to the"
"Urban  Development  Authority.  The  public  purpose  was  for  the  Bibile"
"Town Development Project. However, at a particular point of time, the"
"implementation  of  the  said  project  had  been  suspended  for  the  non-"
"availability of funds. Simply, it was a failure to utilise the land for the"
"intended public purpose. It was held that the only provision under which"
"the  Minister  could  have  acted  is  Section  39A,  and  to  divest,  provided"
"that the four requirements under subsection (2) were satisfied. The land"
"was  acquired  for  the  purpose  of  construction  of  a  proposed  shopping"
"complex.  It  was  observed  that  19  acres  of  land  is  far  beyond  the"
"requirement  to  satisfy  this  public  purpose,  and  the  Supreme  Court"
"upheld the divesting of a part thereof. His Lordship held thus;"
