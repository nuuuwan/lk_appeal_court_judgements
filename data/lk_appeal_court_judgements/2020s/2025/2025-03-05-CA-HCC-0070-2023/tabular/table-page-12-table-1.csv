"All three witnesses who were the eyewitnesses of the incident are consistent with"
"their  testimonies  and  have  been  at  the  scene  when  the  Accused  stabbed  the"
"deceased  and  they  have  denied  that  no  one  had  thrown  acid  at  the  Accused."
"Further,  according  to  evidence,  after  the  heated  argument  with  the  PW1,  the"
"Accused had gone to his house and brought the weapons. It should be noted that"
"the  deceased  was  not  there  when  this  incident  happened.  We  are  mindful  that"
"PW1 is the mother of the deceased and the deceased’s wife eloped with the Accused"
"and was living together with him at the time of the incident. The fact remains that"
"on  the  previous  day,  the  PW1,  the  deceased,  and  his  father  had  gone  to  the"
"Accused’s house and told the deceased’s wife not to come to the deceased’s house."
"Further, we observe that the deceased did not have any weapons at the time of the"
"incident.  When  we  consider  all  three  testimonies  of  the  witnesses  together,  the"
"evidence is consistent. This Court sees no reason to reject their evidence."
