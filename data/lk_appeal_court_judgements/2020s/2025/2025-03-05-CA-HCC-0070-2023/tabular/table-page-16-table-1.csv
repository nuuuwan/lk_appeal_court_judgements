"pre-meditation can be furnished by former grudges or previous threats and"
"expressions of ill-feelings; by acts of preparation to kill, such as procuring a"
"deadly  weapon or  selecting  a  dangerous  weapon in preference  to  one less"
"dangerous,  and  by  the  manner  in  which  the  killing  was  committed.  For"
