"need for the Accused to start a fight. Further, she confirmed that she and some"
"other people prevented the Accused from entering the house. She flatly denied that"
"the deceased had a weapon in his hand. She further confirmed that the Accused"
"had  an  iron  rod  and  a  sickle  which  were  brought  by  him  from  his  house.  They"
"suggested  that  the  Accused  picked  the  Sickle  from  there  to  prevent  him  from"
