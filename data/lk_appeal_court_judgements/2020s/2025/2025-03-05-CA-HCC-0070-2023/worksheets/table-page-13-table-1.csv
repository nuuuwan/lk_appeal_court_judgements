"The evidence of the three witnesses indicates that there had been a lapse of time"
"between the quarrel with PW1 and the stabbing. After PW1 scolded the Accused"
"where the deceased was not there, the Accused had come back to the scene with a"
"weapon. This shows that there was premeditation."
"T
his Court can come to the conclusion from the wounds and the place where the"
"stab injuries were caused that this is not a result of negligence or self-defence. A"
"strong  presumption  arises  that  the  injuries  caused  were  intended  to  cause  the"
"death.  The  inference  could  be  drawn  that  the  Accused’s  intention  was  to  cause"
"death to the deceased."
"T
he main defence taken by the Counsel for the Defence was that the incident took"
"place as a result of a sudden fight. They have taken the defence that PW1 and the"
"deceased  had  thrown  acid  at  the  Accused.  The  Accused  gave  evidence  from  the"
"witness box which is as follows."
"A
ccording to the Accused, while he was passing by the deceased’s house, the PW1"
"grabbed him by the shirt and dragged him to the deceased’s uncle’s house. Further,"
"he  admitted  that  he  eloped  with  the  deceased’s  wife  and  stayed  at  a  different"
"house."
"A
ccording to him, while he was sitting on the ‘ගල් වැටිය’, the PW1, PW2, and her"
"husband  namely  Weerasinghe  had  scolded  the  Accused  and  he  had  listened  to"
"them quietly. Then the said PW2’s husband had thrown the hot tea which he had"
"been having towards the Accused which burnt his face. This was not suggested to"
"the  prosecution  witnesses  when  they  were  cross-examined.  Then,  the  Accused"
"tried to hit the said husband but the relatives of the deceased who were there had"
"hit  the  Accused.  Then  the  PW1  had  come  towards  the  Accused  saying  “දතෝ"
"ෙනවා” and had bit the left side of the Accused’s chest. This was also not suggested"
"to the PW1. When the Accused tried to hit the PW1, the said Weerasinghe had"
"come with a mamoty to hit him. Thereafter, the Accused took a long sickle which"
"was  there  and  waved  it.  It  broke  then  after  hitting  the  wall.  Again,  the  said"
