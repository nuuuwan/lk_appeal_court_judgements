"5.  Inflicting  two  deep  stab  injuries  on  the  deceased  which  caused  the  death"
"using the said weapon."
"On the other hand, there was no evidence to show that the Accused sustained burn"
"injuries  which  were  caused  by  acid.  Further,  the  Accused  had  tried  to  abscond"
"from the scene. We observe that, if he had been wounded by such acid, he would"
"have gone to the hospital and a prudent man would produce the medical reports"
"of  such  wounds  before  this  Court.  According  to  him,  the  deceased  had  tried  to"
"attack him and in defence, he had stabbed the deceased."
