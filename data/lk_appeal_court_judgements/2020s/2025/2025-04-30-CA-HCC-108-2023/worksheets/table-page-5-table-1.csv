"“It is the contention of the accused-appellant that the dying deposition on which"
"he was convicted fails to satisfy these stringent tests, in view of the inconsistencies"
"referred to above and therefore the prosecution has failed to prove its case against"
"him.”"
"With these authorities in mind, it is pertinent to delve into the facts as revealed at the"
"trial Court in terms of the two dying declarations made by the deceased."
"A
ccording to PW1, Abdul Sameen Mohamadu Rilwan while he was talking to one Jiffry"
"at  around  1.30  PM  near Kottaramulla  Al-Hira  School,  he  saw  the  deceased  in  a three-"
"wheeler driven by PW2. The deceased was bleeding at the time and the deceased said ‘මාව"
"කැපුවා’. When the PW1 asked ‘මමාකද වුමේ’, the deceased had replied ‘මට මංජු කැපුවා’."
"According  to  him,  he  has  identified  that  the  name  mentioned  as  Manju  refers  to  the"
"Accused. The deceased had asked PW1 whether to go to the Police or to the hospital. Then"
"PW1 asked PW2 to take the deceased to the hospital immediately. As stated by PW1, then"
"the  deceased  was  taken  to  the  Marawila  Hospital  and  was  transferred  to  the  Colombo"
"General Hospital, and passed away there."
"P
W1 has given evidence at the post-mortem at the Marawila Magistrates Court."
"At the cross examination, PW1 affirmed that he met the deceased near Al-Hira School."
"He  further  affirmed  that  when  he  asked  as  to  what  happened  from  the  deceased,  he"
"replied saying  ‘මට මංජු කැපුවා’.  Further,  PW1  has stated  that there  is no one else  called"
"Manju in the area other than the Accused."
"According to PW8, Jayamaha Hitihamilage Dharmarathna Jayamaha, the Police Officer,"
"when he was the Acting OIC of the Koswatta Police, on 09.09.2014, he received a piece of"
"information through 119. Thereafter, he along with some other officers went to the crime"
"scene at around 2.40 PM. He mentions that there were blood stains on the crime scene."
"Further according to PW8, a person called Rubin showed the crime scene and the people"
"who had gathered there informed them about the Accused."
