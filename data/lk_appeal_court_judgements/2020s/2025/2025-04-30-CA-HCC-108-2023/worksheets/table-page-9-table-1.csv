"Therefore, the Learned High Court Judge had considered the principles related to dying"
"declarations laid in the above judgments and correctly had come to the conclusion that"
"the Prosecution had established that the evidence of the witnesses, PW1 and PW8 who"
"testified about the dying declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. There is"
"no reason for us to dispute this decision."
