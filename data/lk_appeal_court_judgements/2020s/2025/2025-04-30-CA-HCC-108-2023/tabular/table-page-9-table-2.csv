"n King vs. Thajudeen 6 NLR 16 at page 19, His Lordship Bonser CJ has held that;"
"“But it was urged that they did not intend to break the man’s rib and therefore"
"they could not be convicted of grievous hurt. No doubt they had not in their mind"
"at the time they struck him their baton and with their fists any definite idea that"
"they  were  going  to  break  his  ribs  or  any  particular  rib;  but  when  people  cause"
"injuries to a man, their intent must be judges by the result of their action. They"
"must be deemed in law to have intended what they did.”"
