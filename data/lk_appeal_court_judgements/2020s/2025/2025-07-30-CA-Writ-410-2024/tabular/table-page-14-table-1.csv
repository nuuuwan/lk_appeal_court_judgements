"This Court is of the view that, having considered the aforementioned authorities and"
"the  fact  that  the  1st  Respondent  acted  without  jurisdiction  in  concluding  that  the"
"Petitioner falls within the definition of a ‘public authority’ under Section 43(g) of the"
"Act, it is inclined to grant the Writs of Prohibition as prayed for in prayers (c) and (d)"
"of the Petition in the instant Application."
"The learned Counsel  appearing  for the 1st  to  6th Respondents  further  argues that the"
"Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court, as the Petitioner"
"has an alternative remedy by way of an appeal under Section 34 of the Act to make an"
"appeal to this Court. In terms of Section 34 of the Act, a citizen or a public authority"
"aggrieved by a decision made by the 1st Respondent under Section 32 of the Act can"
"appeal against such a decision to this Court. The 1st to 6th Respondents’ argument is"
"that a statutory remedy is available to the Petitioner, and therefore, this is not a fit case"
"to exercise the discretionary remedy of this Court. This Court agrees with the fact that"
"when  there  is  an  effective  alternative  remedy  available,  writ  courts  are  reluctant  to"
"exercise  its  jurisdiction.  However,  it  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  whether  the"
"Petitioner should resort to such an alternative remedy available to him depends on the"
"facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  information"
"requested,  this  Court  has  already  held  that  the  Petitioner  does  not  fall  within  the"
"definition of a 'public authority' under Section 43(g) of the Act. Accordingly, the 1st"
"Respondent has acted without jurisdiction in determining that the Petitioner is a public"
"authority.  Therefore,  the  availability  of  an  alternative  remedy  does  not  prevent  this"
