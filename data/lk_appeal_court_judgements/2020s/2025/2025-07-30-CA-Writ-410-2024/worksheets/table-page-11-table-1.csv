"General of Labour,1 held that,"
"“Error of law on the face of the record is a ground for certiorari."
"If  the  tribunal  had  no  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into  the  matter,  there  is  no  issue"
"that the decision taken is a nullity. On the other hand, even if the tribunal had"
"jurisdiction to inquire into the matter, the decision can still become a nullity if"
"inter alia (a) it has identified a wrong issue as the correct issue to be answered"
"or  (b)  having  initially  identified  the  correct  issue,  ultimately,  albeit  bona  fide,"
"answered a wrong issue as the correct issue.”"
