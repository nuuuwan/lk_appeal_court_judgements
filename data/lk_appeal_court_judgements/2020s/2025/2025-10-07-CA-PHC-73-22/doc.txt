JUDGMENT

The Registered Owner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

“Owner”) instituted this appeal against the order of the Learned High Court Judge

of the Provincial High Court of Sothern Province holding in Matara in case No.

29/2019 where the Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned

Magistrate of Matara bearing No. 23459 where the Learned Magistrate has

confiscated a tractor (hereinafter referred to as the ‘vehicle’) and a trailer bearing

No. 27-3068 and SPGM 0977 respectively consequent to an inquiry.

On 8th July 2009, six individuals were taken into custody along with a vehicle and

trailer in connection with a violation of the Forest Ordinance, for the unlawful

transportation of ten jackfruit logs. Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned

Magistrate, on 8th September 2015, found the first and second accused guilty of

the offence. Following their conviction, the Learned Magistrate initiated an

inquiry into the confiscation of the vehicle and trailer, which had been seized due

to their involvement in the commission of the offence.

Page 4 of 15

At the inquiry, the registered owner, Lahandapurage Wijethunga and one

Kahandapurage Wijesiri gave evidence. Thereafter, on 09.01.2019, the Learned

Magistrate delivered an order and confiscated the vehicle and the trailer.

Aggrieved by the said order, Owner has filed the revision application in the High

Court of Matara, where the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the said revision

application. The Owner has preferred this instant appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge.

Upon examination of the order issued by the Learned Magistrate on 09.01.2019,

it was his considered opinion that the Owner had failed to satisfy the court, on a

balance of probabilities, to warrant an order preventing the confiscation of the

vehicle and trailer. The Learned Magistrate concluded that the owner had failed

to take adequate measures to prevent the use of the said vehicle in the commission

of a subsequent offence.

It is noted that, in its original form, the Forest Ordinance lacked any provision

empowering the learned Magistrate to conduct an inquiry concerning the

confiscation of the vehicle. Consequently, the owner was deprived of an

opportunity to present his case.

“ 40. when any person is convicted of a Forest offence, all timber or forest produce

which is not the property of the Crown in respect of which such offence has been

committed and all tools boats, carts, cattle, motor vehicles used in committing such

offence shall be liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate to confiscation. Such

confiscation may be in addition to any other punishment prescribed for such

offence."

Subsequently, Section 40 of the principal enactment was amended by Section 12

of Act No. 13 of 1966, thereby affording the owner an opportunity to protect his

property from confiscation by demonstrating that he had exercised due diligence

to prevent the use of the said vehicle in the commission of the offence.

Page 5 of 15

Forest (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1966

12. Section 40 of the principal enactment hereby amended by the substitution, for all the words shall be liable," to the end of that section, of the following:-

" shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed for such offence, be confiscated by order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, boats, carts, cattle or motor vehicles is a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to he satisfaction of the court that he had used all precautions to prevent the use of such tools, boats, carts, cattle or motor vehicles, as the case may be, for the commission of the offence.”

This amendment granted the owner an opportunity to demonstrate that all

necessary precautions had been taken to prevent the use of the vehicle in the

commission of an offence, thereby safeguarding it from confiscation.

At this juncture, it is appropriate to reflect upon the views expressed by our Judges

concerning the property rights of the innocent owner.

Akbar J in Excise Inspector Fernando Vs, Marther And Sons, The Ceylon Law weekly, Volume I-50, page 337 held that;

“That before confiscation of a vehicle used for transporting an excisable article without a permit is ordered the owner should be given an opportunity of being heard against the order.”

Page 6 of 15

Justice Nagalingam, J, in RASIAH V. TAMBIRAJAH (Divisional Forest Officer) 53 NLR

574;

“In cases where accused person convicted of the offence is not himself the owner of

the property seized, an order of confiscation without a previous inquiry would be

tantamount to depriving the person of his property without an opportunity being given

him to show.: cause against the order being made.

It is one of the fundamentals of administration of justice that a person should not be

deprived either of his liberty or of his property without an 7 opportunity being given to

him to show cause against such an order being made. To take a case, which' cannot be

regarded as an extreme one, where an owner lends or hires his cart to another without

knowing that the borrower or the hirer intends to case it of the purpose of committing an

offence, would it be right to confiscate the cart merely because it has been so used ? I think

if the owner can show that the offence was committed without his knowledge and without

his participation in the slightest degree justice would seem to demand that he should be

restored his property.”

This amendment provided the innocent owner with an opportunity to prevent the

confiscation of his vehicle. Subsequently, in the exercise of legislative wisdom, the

said provision was repealed through the introduction of Section 7 of Act No. 13 of

1982. It is noteworthy that the section had already been repealed prior to this, by

Act No. 53 of 1979.

For easy reference, I reproduced both amendments.

Forest (Amendment) Act No. 56 of 1979

9. Section 40 of the principal enactment is hereby amended by the repeal of the proviso to that section.

10. Section 41 of the principal enactment is hereby amended by the addition of the following new proviso at the end of that section:-

"Provided that, where any timber or forest produce is subject to speedy and natural decay the court may direct, at any stage prior to the conclusion of the trial, the sale of such timber or forest produce and that the proceeds of the sale be deposited in court to be dealt with at the conclusion of the trial in such manner as the court

Page 7 of 15

may direct."

Forest Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1982

7. Section 40 of the principal enactment, as last amended by Act No. 56 of 1979, is hereby repealed and the following section substituted thereof;-

40.(1) Upon the conviction of any person for a forest offence-

a) all timber of forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect of which such offence has been committed; and

b) all tools, boats, carts, cattle and motor vehicles used in committing such offence (whether such tools, boats. carts, cattle and motor vehicles are owned by such person or not)”

As a result of these legislative changes, even an innocent owner was rendered

powerless to contest the forfeiture.

The issue of participation by an innocent owner was judicially considered by

Sharvananda, C.J., in Manawadu v. Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30. Until that

decision, the Act provided no avenue for the owner to be heard, and forfeiture of

the vehicle was automatic upon conviction for the offence.

In Manawadu, Sharvananda, C.J emphasized the fundamental principle that “no

man is to be condemned in his person or property without being heard,” citing with

approval the dicta of Nagalingam J in Rasiah v. Thambiraj. Following this

landmark judgment, courts have recognized the right of individuals to participate

in vehicle inquiries, thereby restoring a measure of procedural fairness.

At present, pursuant to Act No. 65 of 2009, a statutory provision exists enabling

vehicle owners to demonstrate that they took reasonable precautions to safeguard

their vehicle and prevent the commission of any offence.

Section 40 (1) of the said Act , as amended by Act No 65 of 2009;

Section 26

Page 8 of 15

Section 40 of the principal enactment is hereby amended by the repeal of

subsection (1) thereof and the substitution therefore of the following.

“Where any person is convicted of a forest offence.

(A) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in

respect of which the offence has been committed, and

(B) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing

such offence

Shall, in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by order of the convicting magistrate.

Provided that in any where the owner of such tools, implements and

machines used in the commission of such offence, is a third party, no order

of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the

Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools

vehicles, implement, cattle and machines as the case may be, for the

commission of the offence.”(emphasis added)

Prior to this amendment, the courts required the owner to establish either that

all necessary precautions had been taken to prevent the offence or that the offence

was committed without the owner's knowledge.

In Finance Company PLC Vs. Priyantha Chandra and Five Others (2010) 2 SLR

220, after considering several judicial pronouncements, Dr. Shirani

Bandaranayake, J. (as she was then) held:

“On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, an order of confiscation shall not be made if that owner had proved

to the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

Page 9 of 15

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions shows that the owner has to

establish the said matter on the balance of probability.”

Held further:

“As has been clearly illustrated by several decisions referred to above, it

would be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to establish that the vehicle

that had been used for the commission of the offence had been used without

his knowledge and that the owner had taken all precautions available to

prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of such an offence.”

In Range Forest Officer v. Duwa Pedige Aruna Kumara, SC Appeal No.120/2011,

decided on 10.12.2013, Priyasath Dep, PC. J, (as he was then) held that:

“The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the

Attorney General. Therefore, it is settled law that before an order for forfeiture is

made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on

balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken precautions to prevent

the commission of the offence or the offence was committed without his knowledge

nor he was privy to the commission of the offence then the vehicle has to be

released to the owner.”

Following the enactment of this amendment, the courts now expect the owner to

prove, on the balance of probabilities, that preventive measures were taken to

avert the commission of the offence. This principle has been considered in the

following judgments.

Her Ladyship Justice K. K. Wickremasinghe in Karunapedi Durayalage Sumana

Kumara v. Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Narammala and others has stated:

“Further, it is imperative to note that as per, section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance (amendment Act No. 65 of 2009), it is mandatory to prove

preventive measures taken by the vehicle owner in question. Even though

the previous law allowed a vehicle owner to prove either he took precautions

Page 10 of 15

or he had no knowledge of an offence being committed, the amended section

40 only focuses on the precautions taken by a vehicle owner in question.

Therefore, I am of the view that mere denial of the knowledge about an

offence being committed or denial of the control over his own vehicle is not

sufficient for a vehicle owner to discharge the burden cast on him, under

section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended).”

His lordship Iddawala J in Rajapakse Dewage Asanga Kumara Chandrasena v.

Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Katugasthota and another has stated;

“By the amendment to the Forest Ordinance in 2009 by Act No. 65 of 2009,

the legislature has determined that having no knowledge of the offence

being committed is a not good enough a reason anymore to claim a

confiscated vehicle.

Therefore, Counsel has to be mindful in citing cases decided prior to the

2009 amendment or cases decided under other legislations. The judiciary

has to only discern whether the claimant being the owner of the vehicle, had

taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of

the offence. This entails positive actions on the part of the owner and not

claiming mere ignorance.”

Upon examining the Owner’s evidence, it is evident that he has expressly stated

having taken all necessary precautions to prevent the commission of the offence.

It is therefore pertinent to reproduce the evidence presented before the Learned

Magistrate on 03.07.2018.

From this evidence, it is clear that the owner has established that he has taken all

the precautions to prevent the said vehicle from the commission of the offence and

that the said vehicle was used for the commission of the offence without his

knowledge. But both the learned magistrate and the Learned High Court judge

did not consider this evidence. It should be noted that this evidence was not

Page 12 of 15

contradicted. When the evidence is not contradicted, it becomes uncontradicted

evidence.

This concept was considered by Justice H.N.J. Fernando CJ in L.Edrick De Silva

v. L. Chandrdasa de Silva, 40 NLR 169:

“Where the petitioner has led evidence sufficient in law to prove his status, I.E, a

factum probandum, the failure of the respondent to adduce evidence which

contradicts it adds a new factor in favour of the petitioner. There is then an

additional “matter before the Court” which the definition in section 3 of the

Evidence Ordinance requires the court”, to take into account , namely that the

evidence led by the petitioner is uncontradicted. The failure to take account of

these circumstances is a non direction amounting to a misdirection in law.”

But learned Magistrate and learned High Court Judge has failed to consider this

fact.

It is pertinent to refer to the learned Magistrate’s order with regard to the evidence

placed before him.

I hold that a learned magistrate failure to consider the evidence is a misdirection

in law.

Page 13 of 15

We are mindful that our courts require the owner to establish his claim on the

balance of probabilities.

In the case of Orient Financial Service Corporation Ltd. v. Range Forest Officer

and One Other, CA (PHC) APN 26/2011, decided on 28.04.2011, Sisira De Abrew

J held that:

“It is therefore seen under the existing law a vehicle transporting timber

cannot be confiscated if the owner of the vehicle on a balance of probability,

establishes one of the following things.

1. That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence.

2. That the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without

his knowledge.”

I am mindful of the observations set out by His Lordship Justice Ranaraja, in

Officer in Charge, Nagoda v. Katuneliya Gamage Dilsha Theekshana Kumara, CA

PHC/59/2020, decided on 27.03.2025. held that;

“When considering the contents quoted above, it is clear that if indisputable

evidence is provided by the appellant to satisfy the Court on a balance of

probability of the precautionary measures taken by her to prevent the use

of the particular vehicle to commit an offence, then evidence to corroborate

the narrative of the appellant is not essential.”

Upon a comprehensive review of the evidence presented before the Learned

Magistrate, we are satisfied that the owner, who is the registered owner of the

vehicle, has placed his evidence on the balance of probability, which our courts

require. The owner had known the accused for a period of 8 to 10 years and had

entrusted the vehicle under clearly defined conditions, including instructions to

undertake only nearby hires. Moreover, the vehicle had been in the owner’s

possession since 2010, with no prior record of involvement in any unlawful

activity. Despite these consistent and credible safeguards, such factors were not

adequately taken into account in either of the orders currently under review.

Page 14 of 15

Moreover, it is noted that the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court

Judge failed to consider the above factors into account in arriving at their

determination.

When we peruse the learned High Court Judge’s Order made on 10.02.2022, it is

evident that the learned High Court judge has failed to analyse the evidence of the

owner, which was placed before the learned Magistrate.

Page 60 of the brief;

“සියළු පුර්වාරක්ෂක ක්‍රියාමාර්ග ගනු ලැබූ ෙව වැඩිෙර සාක්ි මත ඔප්පපු කිරීමට වාචිකව රියදුරුට

සාක්ි ප්‍රතික්බෂේප කර ඇති අතර, ඒ සදහා පිළිගත හැකි බහේතුන් ද සඳහන් කර ඇත.”

In my considered opinion, the learned High Court Judge either failed to evaluate

the evidence presented by the owner or omitted any reference to it in the judgment.

As such, we allow the Appeal and set aside the orders dated 09.01.2019 and

11.02.2022 of the Learned Magistrate of Matara and the Learned Provincial High

Court Judge of Matara, respectively.

In light of the foregoing facts, I am of the opinion that the confiscation of the

vehicle is unjustified and cannot be upheld. Therefore, we direct to release of the

tractor and the trailer bearing No. 27-3068 and SPGM 0977 to the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Matara Magistrate's Court of Matara for compliance.
