"574;"
"“In cases where accused person convicted of the offence is not himself the owner of"
"the  property seized, an order of confiscation without a previous inquiry would be"
"tantamount to depriving the person of his property without an opportunity being given"
"h
i
m
 
to show.: cause against the order being made."
"I
t
 is one of the fundamentals of administration of justice that a person should not be"
"deprived either of his liberty or of his property without an 7 opportunity being given to"
"h
i
m
 to show cause against such an order being made. To take a case, which' cannot be"
"regarded as an extreme one, where an owner lends or hires his cart to another without"
"knowing that the borrower or the hirer intends to case it of  the purpose of committing an"
"o
ffence, would it be right to confiscate the cart merely because it has been so used ? I think"
"i
f
 
the owner can show that the offence was committed without his knowledge and without"
"h
i
s
 participation in the slightest degree justice would seem to demand that he should be"
"restored his property.”"
"T
his amendment provided the innocent owner with an opportunity to prevent the"
"confiscation of his vehicle. Subsequently, in the exercise of legislative wisdom, the"
"said provision was repealed through the introduction of Section 7 of Act No. 13 of"
"1982. It is noteworthy that the section had already been repealed prior to this, by"
"Act No. 53 of 1979."
"For easy reference, I reproduced both amendments."
