"by making such alterations to the said Mortgage Bond P5 and has acted"
"ultra vires, adopting the Board Resolution P10 based on such fraudulent"
"Mortgage Bond."
"Although the Petitioner claims that he has not executed a Mortgage Bond"
"for Rs. 25,000,000, he has not explicitly denied obtaining the loan facility"
"of Rs. 25,000,000. Furthermore, upon a close evaluation of the pleadings"
"and the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner, it is apparent that"
"the Petitioner does not deny the execution of Mortgage Bond P5 except"
"for the alterations made therein."
"The  stance  of  the  1st  Respondent 
is  that  the  Petitioner  obtained  the"
"financial  facility  of  Rs.  25,000,000  from  the  1st  Respondent  Bank  as"
"evidenced  by  the  loan  applications  marked  1R2  and  1R3.  The  Mortgage"
"Bond  P5  has  been  duly  executed  to  secure  the  aforesaid  facilities  by"
"mortgaging  the  properties  mentioned 
in  the  above 
loan  applications"
"marked  1R2  and  1R3.  However,  when 
the  Mortgage  Bond  P5  was"
"submitted  to  the  Land  Registry  for  registration,  the  Notary  Public  who"
"attested  the  Bond  had  been  notified  by  the  Registrar  to  correct  the"
"mistake regarding the value of the Bond as the bond was stamped  for a"
"value of Rs.  25,000,000 while its value was incorrectly mentioned as Rs."
"7,500,000  in  the  body  of  Mortgage  Bond  P5.  The  Respondents  submit"
"that  the  Notary  Public  corrected  the  aforesaid  mistake  on  the  advice  of"
"the  Registrar  of  Lands  and  executed  the  Deed  of  Declaration  bearing"
"No.4388 dated 07.08.2013 marked as 1R12."
"In view of the above circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the parties"
"are  at variance on the nature of the corrections made on the Mortgage"
"Bond P5, whether it was a fraudulent activity or a mistake on the part of"
"the 1st Respondent Bank. Furthermore, the parties are also at variance as"
"to the appropriate method of rectifying such alterations required to have"
"been made, i.e., whether the 1st Respondent Bank should have executed a"
"Deed  of  Declaration or  a  Deed  of  Rectification.  Similarly,  the  parties  are"
"also at variance on the value referred to in the Mortgage Bond. Therefore,"
"it is abundantly clear that the facts in relation to whether any fraudulent"
"activity has been committed in executing the impugned Mortgage Bond,"
"are in dispute. Consequently, in order to arrive at a decision with regard"
