"partners of the partnership named M/S New Sri Luck and Company, and a"
"shareholder  of 
the  business 
carried  on  with 
the  4th  and 
the  5th"
"Respondents named M/S Chamathkara Industries (Pvt) Ltd. The Petitioner"
"alone  and  the  Petitioner  with  the  4th  and  the  5th  Respondents  had"
"obtained  several  loan  facilities,  executing  the  Mortgage  Bonds  bearing"
"No.  6756  dated  03.10.2006  marked  as  P3,  No.7414  dated  07.08.2007"
"marked  as  P4,  No.  1450  dated  26.10.2010  marked  as  P5  and  No.2678"
"dated 29.02.2012 marked as P6. However, the Petitioner claims that the"
"Mortgage  Bond  bearing  No.  1450,  dated  26.10.2010  (P5),  is  an  ex  facie"
"fraudulent  and 
illegal  document  due  to  the  reasons  set  out 
in  the"
"Petition.  Since  the  aforesaid loan  facilities obtained had been defaulted,"
"the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent Bank had passed the Board"
"Resolution  dated  24.09.2013,  marked  as  P10,  acting  in  terms  of  Section"
"29D  of  the  People's  Bank  Act  No.  29  of  1961,  to  sell  the  properties"
"mortgaged 
to 
the  1st  Respondent  Bank  and 
thereby 
to 
settle 
the"
"purported loans."
"While 
the  matters  remained  as  such, 
the  Petitioner  challenged 
the"
"aforesaid Board Resolution before the Commercial High Court of Colombo"
"in the case bearing No. 274/14 MR, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that"
"the aforesaid Board Resolution is null and void and orders restraining the"
"1st  Respondent  Bank  from  auctioning  the  corresponding  properties.  The"
"interim relief sought in the aforesaid case to restrain the 1st Respondent"
"Bank from auctioning the said lands, had been refused."
"The Petitioner claims that the purported Board Resolution and the Parate"
"Procedure  adopted  are  bad 
in 
law  and  ultra  vires  on  the 
following"
"grounds:"
"a.  The 
1st 
Respondent 
Bank 
is 
attempting 
to 
enforce 
the"
"fraudulently executed Mortgage Bond No.1450 (P5) via the said"
"Board Resolution"
"b.  The  1st  Respondent  Bank 
is  attempting  to  recover  a  sum  of"
"money  which  exceeds  the  value  secured  upon  the  mortgage"
