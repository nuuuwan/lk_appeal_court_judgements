"property.  Therefore, 
there 
is  nothing 
that  prevents 
the  Bank 
from"
"adopting one resolution for the same property mortgaged under several"
"bonds  where  such  Board  Resolution  provides  sufficient  clarity  as  to  the"
"defaulters, 
facilities  and 
the  property.  Thus, 
the  contention  of 
the"
"Petitioner  that  one  Resolution  cannot  be  executed  in  respect  of  several"
"loan facilities is bad in law and is an erroneous view."
"Further,  Section  29K  of  the  People’s  Bank  Act  facilitate  the  adoption  of"
"such a resolution. Section 29K(1) is as follows:"
"“In  any  case  where  two  or  more  loans  have  been  granted  by  the"
"Bank  on  the  security  of  the  same  property  and  default  is  made  in"
"the payment of any  sum due upon anyone or more of such loans,"
"the foregoing provisions of this Act shall apply notwithstanding that"
"default may not have been made in respect of the other loan or any"
"of  the  other 
loans,  and  the  Board  may, 
in  any  such  case,  by"
"resolution under section 29D authorize the sale of the property for"
"the recovery of the total amount due to the Bank in respect of both"
"or  all  of  the  loans,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  the  provisions  of  this"
"Part of this Act shall apply accordingly.”"
"Further, the Petitioner submits that the Notice of Resolution is bad in law"
"as  the  Board  Resolution  marked  P10  refers  to  the  auctioning  of  the"
"properties in Mortgage Bonds Nos. 6756, 7414, 1450 read together with"
"Deed  of  Declaration  4388  and  2678,  while  the  Notice  of  Resolution"
"published in the Gazette marked as P11 refers only to the enforcement of"
"Mortgage Bonds Nos.  6756,  7414 and 1450. It is further  submitted that"
"the  above  publication  P11  does  not 
refer 
to 
the  Mortgage  Bond"
"(No.2678)  executed  by  M/S  Chamathkara 
Industries 
(Pvt)  Ltd,  even"
"though the purported Resolution P10 refers to the default payment made"
"by the said entity.  However, it is abundantly clear that this is a complete"
"misconception as the Notice of Publication marked P11 also refers to all"
"the  Deeds  referred  to 
in  the  Board  Resolution  marked  P10, 
including"
