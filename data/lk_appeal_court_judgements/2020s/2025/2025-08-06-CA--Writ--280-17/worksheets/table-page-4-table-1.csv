"c.  The  purported  Resolution  is  contrary  to  the  provisions  under"
"Section 29 of the Peopleâ€™s Bank Act and is bad in law."
"The  Petitioner  states  that  the  aforesaid  acts  of  the  1st  Respondent  are"
"ultra  vires,  unlawful,  irrational,  and  are  not  in  compliance  with  the  due"
"process. Accordingly, the Petitioner seeks inter alia reliefs in the nature of"
"Writ of Certiorari quashing the purported Board Resolution (P10) and in"
"the  nature  of  Writ  of  Prohibition  restraining  the  1st  Respondent  from"
"acting under and in terms of the Board Resolution (P10)."
"Validity of the Impugned Mortgage Bond Before the Law"
"The  Petitioner  states  that  the  Mortgage  Bond  No.1450  (P5),  which 
is"
"referred  to  in  the  Board  Resolution,  is  a  fraudulent  deed.  As  per  the"
"extract  of  the  Volume/  Folio  3315/65  registered  in  the  Land  Registry  of"
"Delkanda  marked  P14, 
the  value  of 
the  Mortgage  Bond  P5 
is  Rs."
"7,500,000/-. However, it is submitted that in two instances on page 4 of"
"the Mortgage Bond P5, the value of Rs. 7,500,000/- has been deleted and"
"replaced  with  Rs.  25,000,000/-,  which  had  not  been 
initialled  by  the"
"Notary Public. Further, the amount of Rs. 7,500,000/-, which is referred to"
"in the attestation of the Mortgage Bond P5, has also been altered as Rs."
"25,000,000/-. The contention of the Petitioner is that he never executed a"
"Mortgage  Bond  for  Rs.  25,000,000/-,  and  such  alterations  have  been"
"effected subsequent to the registration of the Mortgage Bond P5 without"
"the concurrence and/or agreement of the mortgagor."
"Further,  the  Petitioner  submits  that  although  the  Notary  Public  who"
"attested the impugned Mortgage Bond P5, rectified the inconsistencies in"
"the said Bond by executing a Deed of Declaration bearing No. 4388 dated"
"07.08.2013, the execution of such Deed of Declaration is not the proper"
"recourse  to  correct  any  such  invalid  alterations.  It  is  claimed  that  the"
"appropriate  recourse  would  have  been  to  effect  such  correction  in  the"
"aforesaid  notarial  document  by  way  of  a  Deed  of  Rectification.  It  is  the"
"position of the Petitioner that the aforesaid Deed of Declaration is invalid"
"and has no legal effect as the said deed has been executed in the absence"
"of the Petitioner without his consent, participation or knowledge.  Hence,"
"it is claimed that the 1st Respondent Bank has committed a serious fraud"
