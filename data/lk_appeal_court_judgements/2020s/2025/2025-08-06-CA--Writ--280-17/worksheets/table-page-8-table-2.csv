"may reject a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay."
"An  Application  for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  should  be  filed  within  a"
"reasonable time.”"
"Therefore, I am of the view that there is an unexplained delay involved in"
"the Petitioner coming before this Court seeking the reliefs."
"The  Petitioner  contends  that  although  the  Mortgage  Bonds  marked  P3"
"and  P4  secured  only  a 
total  amount  of  money  not  exceeding  Rs."
"16,500,000,  the  Board  Resolution  P10  has  been  passed  to  recover  the"
"sum, which is more than the stamp value and/or the secured interest by"
"the  aforesaid  Bonds.  However,  it  is  observed  that  as  per  the  aforesaid"
"Mortgage Bonds, not only the loans granted but also the interest on the"
"amount  referred  therein  are  also  secured.    Therefore,  the  argument  of"
"the  Petitioner  that  the  1st  Respondent,  via 
its  Board  Resolution  P10"
"attempts  to  recover  a  sum  which  exceeds  the  value  secured  upon  the"
"mortgage bonds is not tenable."
"The Petitioner contends that the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent"
"Bank 
illegally  and  unlawfully  passed  one  resolution  pertaining  to  all"
"default 
loan 
facilities  obtained  by 
separate 
legal  entities,  and 
said"
"Resolution  does  not  clearly  identify  which  loan  facility  was  granted  to"
"which  entity.  Accordingly,  there  should  have  been  a  separate  resolution"
"for each property."
"In the instant case, there is no dispute that the 1st Respondent Bank has"
"granted 
loans  to  the  Petitioner’s  sole  partnership  business,  Sri  Luck"
"Stores,  New  Sri  Luck &  Company,  and  M/S  Chamathkara  Industries  (Pvt)"
"Ltd,  and 
the  Petitioner,  4th  and  5th  Respondents,  were 
in  default."
"Impugned 
loan  facilities  have  been  obtained,  securing  the  Mortgage"
"Bonds  referred  to 
in  Resolution  P10.  Resolution  P10  referred  to  the"
"names of the defaulters and relevant Mortgage Bonds."
"There  is no legal requirement to have separate resolutions in respect of"
"each  property  mortgaged.  All  Mortgage  Bonds 
relate 
to 
the 
same"
