"then the courts may rule that the time-limit runs from that earlier"
"decision.”"
"In the case of K.G.D. Walter Abeysundera and another Vs. S. Hettiarachchi,"
"Secretary,  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Other,  (CA/Writ/371/2021decided  on"
"22.09.2021) also this Court was of the view that, in instances where the"
"impugned  action  takes  place 
in  stages,  the  Petitioner  has  a  right  to"
"challenge  such decision  at  the  earliest  stage  rather  than waiting  for  the"
"final and decisive stage."
"In the light of the above, I am not inclined to accept the contention of the"
"1st  to  12th  Respondents  that  the  Petitioner’s  application  challenging  the"
"report and proceedings of the Investigating Committee are premature."
"Availability of an Alternative Remedy"
"The 1st to 12th Respondents have asserted that the writ jurisdiction of this"
"Court  should  not  be 
invoked 
in  the 
instant  application,  as  the 
law"
"provides  the  Petitioner  with  an  adequate  statutory  alternative  remedy"
"under  the  Act.  The  Respondents  rely  on  Section  8  of  the  Act,  which"
"provides the right of appeal against the report or decision of the Council,"
"Disciplinary  Committee  and 
the 
Investigating  Committee.  The  writ"
"jurisdiction,  being  a  discretionary  remedy,  the  Court  will  not  normally"
"exercise it unless and until the  Petitioner has exhausted other remedies"
"reasonably  available  and  equally  appropriate.  However, 
in  the 
instant"
"application, 
the  relevant  Respondents  were  reluctant 
to  submit  the"
"impugned report of the Investigating Committee even for the perusal of"
"this  Court  on  the  basis  that  it  is  a  confidential  one  which  could  not  be"
"revealed  or  accessed  by  non-members  of  the  1st  Respondent  Institute"
"and  the  public.  The  attitude  of  the  1st  to  12th  Respondents  effectively"
"precludes the Petitioner from “reasonably” exercising his right of appeal"
"as mandated by the Statute. The conduct of the 1st to 12th Respondents"
"creates significant challenges for the Petitioner to resort to the so-called"
"alternative remedy suggested by the Respondents. Accordingly, given the"
"specific  circumstances  of 
this  application, 
I  view 
that 
in 
the  given"
"instance,  the  Petitioner  cannot  be  reasonably  expected  to  resort  to  the"
"aforesaid alternative remedy."
"The  facts  related  to  the  alleged  misconduct  of  the  Petitioner  was  not"
"contested by the parties at length during the course of the argument and"
"their  submissions  were  limited  to  the  aforesaid  procedural  impropriety."
