"that the Report of the Investigating Committee is confidential and has not"
"been  submitted  to  the  Court,  as  producing  it  would  make  the  report"
"accessible 
to 
non-members 
and 
the 
public. 
Although 
the 
said"
"Respondents  state  that  the  Report  of  the 
Investigating  Committee 
is"
"confidential, in terms of the provisions of Section 8(6)(a) of the Act, such"
"a  report  is  subject  to  a  right  of  appeal.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the"
"legislature  intended  such  a  report  to  be  accessible  to  the  party  being"
"investigated.  Hence, 
I  am  of  the  view  that  such  a  report  cannot  be"
"deemed to be a privileged document, which the Petitioner or this Court"
"could not have had access to."
"However,  the  Regulations  P37A  makes  such  report  of  the  Investigating"
"Committee a confidential report, thus creating an apparent inconsistency"
"between primary legislation and the subordinate legislation. It is not my"
"place  to  review  this 
inconsistency 
in  the 
instant  application,  because"
"none of the parties have raised any issues to this effect. Therefore, I shall"
"leave it as a mere observation made in the course of analysing the law in"
"question."
"I am of the view that the 2nd to 9th Respondents had the opportunity to"
"submit  said  Confidential  Report  to  the  Court  at  least  under  confidential"
"cover without giving access to any third party. If so, the Court would have"
"had  the  opportunity  to  assess  the  contents  of  the  alleged  confidential"
"report  and  consider  whether  the  relevant  Respondents  have  complied"
"with 
the  applicable 
laws  and  regulations.  However, 
the  2nd 
to  12th"
"Respondents  have 
failed  to  produce  the  alleged  confidential  report,"
"which is said to be only accessible by the 2nd to 9th Respondents (Council)."
"Since  the  Respondents  themselves  have  created  a  gap  in  the  evidence,"
"this  Court  cannot  determine  whether  the  Investigating  Committee  has"
"reached  a  decision  in  respect  of  the  severity  of  the  misconduct  or  the"
"nature  of 
such 
conduct 
(whether 
it 
is 
trivial  or  grave). 
In 
those"
"circumstances, the Respondents should not be allowed to take any undue"
"advantage upon their failure that would cause prejudice to the Petitioner."
"Additionally, if the Court decides to determine the matter based on the"
"unseen confidential report, which is deemed the only relevant evidence,"
"it would constitute an unwarranted inference by law."
"Further, the Court is mindful of Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance,"
"which  provides  that  the  Court  may  presume  that  evidence  which  could"
"be  and 
is  not  produced  would, 
if  produced,  be  unfavourable  to  the"
