"(ii)  
the misconduct is of a grave nature, the Council shall"
"appoint  a  Disciplinary  Committee  to  inquire  into  and"
"report to the Council on the alleged misconduct.”"
"The  relevant  procedure  which  should  be  adopted  in  proceeding  with  a"
"disciplinary inquiry discussed in Section 8(4A) is further elaborated under"
"Regulations  (P37A) made  under  the  authority  derived  from Section  6  of"
"the Act. The Regulations mandate the Investigation Committee to submit"
"a 
confidential 
report 
to 
the  Council.  Regulation  No.9.1(6)  of 
the"
"Regulations P37A provides that:"
"“The Investigation Committee shall submit a Report containing the"
"procedure  adopted,  its  findings  and  other  relevant  information,  in"
"the form of a written report to the Council in a confidential manner."
"All the necessary documents and correspondences shall be annexed"
"to the said report.”"
"Section 8(4A)(c) of the Act provides that once an Investigating Committee"
"reports  to  the  Council  that  a  prima  facie  case  of  misconduct  has  been"
"made,  and  the  purported  misconduct 
is  of  a  trivial  or  grave  nature,"
"subsequent  decisions  could  be  made  by  the  Council  accordingly.  The"
"Petitioner asserts that the Respondent Council has not demonstrated to"
"the  Court  whether  the 
Investigating  Committee  has  reported  to  the"
"Council that a prima facie case of misconduct has been made and/or that"
"the  purported  misconduct 
is  of  a  “trivial”  or  “grave”  nature.  The"
"Petitioner 
submits 
that 
the  above-referred  are 
statutory  precedent"
"conditions which have to be mandatorily satisfied. Hence, the Petitioner"
"contends that in the event where the 2nd to 9th Respondents fail to satisfy"
"that  a  prima  facie  case  of  misconduct  against  the  Petitioner  has  been"
"made or that the purported misconduct is of a trivial or grave nature, all"
"subsequent  directions  made  by  the  Council  are  vitiated,  tainted,  and"
"rendered ex facie illegal."
"The  3rd  Respondent,  by  his  letter  marked  P39,  informed  the  Petitioner"
"that the Investigating Committee had come to the conclusion that there"
"is a prima facie case of professional misconduct. Accordingly, the Council"
"has  decided  to  refer  the  matter  to  a  Disciplinary  Inquiry  Committee  for"
"further action. The Petitioner contended that the aforementioned letter"
"does  not  adequately  convey 
the  nature  or  severity  of 
the  alleged"
"professional  misconduct  against  him  that  supports  the  conclusion  of  a"
"prima 
facie  case.  Even 
in 
the 
letter  marked  P40,  sent  by 
the  3rd"
