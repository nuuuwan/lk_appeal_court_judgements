"person who withholds it. In the case of Hemathilake Vs. Allina And Others"
"(2003) 2 SLR 144 at 147, it was held as follows:"
"“What  section  114  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  provides  for  is  the"
"common  sense  advice  that  court  may  from  a  proved  fact 
infer"
"another fact which it thinks is likely to be true regard being had to"
"human  conduct  and  the  common  course  of  natural  events.  The"
"particular  facts  of  each  case  must  be  carefully  considered  before"
"any 
inference 
is  drawn  under 
section  114  of 
the  Evidence"
"Ordinance.”"
"Further,  in the case of  Leelawathie And Others Vs. Makewita (2019)1SLR"
"271 at 281, it was opined that:"
"“For 
the  presumption  under 
Section  114(f)  of 
the  Evidence"
"Ordinance 
to  arise, 
the  evidence  must  not  be  available  or 
is"
"withheld by the opposite party. The presumption will not arise if it is"
"available  within  the  control  of  the  party  who  wishes  to  lead  that"
"evidence.  In  other  words,  no  inference  can  be  drawn  where  the"
"witness  in  question  is  equally  available  to  both,  particularly  when"
"he is actually in Court."
"In  view  of  the  rationale  upheld  in  the  above-cited  cases,  this  is  a  clear"
"case  where 
the  presumption  under  Section  114(f)  of 
the  Evidence"
"Ordinance  could  be  applied,  especially, 
in 
the  backdrop  where 
the"
"Petitioner has no access to the said confidential report."
"It  is  on  common  grounds  that  the  above  relevant  provisions  of  the  Act"
"and  the  Regulations specified  in  Regulations  P37A  are  mandatory. Since"
"these  disciplinary  procedures  may  even  possibly 
finally 
lead 
to 
the"
"disenrollment  of  a  member 
from  the  professional  organisation, 
it 
is"
"essential  that  the  2nd  to  9th  Respondents  strictly  comply  with  relevant"
"statutory provisions and the Regulations. However, as discussed above, I"
"am of the view that the Respondents have failed to satisfy this Court as to"
"the due compliance with procedure laid down under the Statute and the"
"Regulations."
