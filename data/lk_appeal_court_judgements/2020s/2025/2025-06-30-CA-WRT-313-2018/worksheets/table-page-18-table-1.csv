"Respondent  to  the  Petitioner,  does  not  reveal  that  the 
Investigating"
"Committee has come to any findings of misconduct of grave nature."
"The  1st  to  12th  Respondents  submit  that  Section  8  of  the  Act  does  not"
"place any obligation on the Council to inform the Petitioner of the nature"
"of the prima facie case. It is claimed that however, letter marked P39 is a"
"clear 
indication 
in  respect  of  the  prima  facie  case  found  against  the"
"Petitioner. However, I am not inclined to accept such an argument as the"
"decisions made by the Council under Section 8(4A)(c) of the Act are also"
"subject to a right of appeal under Section 8(6)(a) of the Act. In an event"
"where  a  particular  decision 
is  subject  to  a  right  to  appeal,  clear  and"
"specific determinations of the decision subject right to appeal should be"
"informed to the party affected in order for such party decide upon as to"
"whether he/she shall avail such right and if availed on what grounds."
"Regulation 
No.9.1(7)(a) 
of 
Regulations 
P37A 
provides 
that 
the"
"confidential  report,  which  has  to  be  submitted  by  the 
Investigating"
"Committee,  shall  contain  a  draft  charge  or  charges  and  the  basis  of"
"evidence supporting such charges, if disciplinary action is recommended."
"Further the Regulation 9.3.2(1)(a) of the Regulations P37A specifies that"
"the  preparation  of  a  charge 
sheet 
is  a  duty  of 
the 
Investigating"
"Committee.  Nevertheless, 
in  the  instant  application,  the  charge  sheet"
"marked P41 annexed to the letter marked P40 has been prepared by the"
"Disciplinary 
Committee, 
but 
not 
the 
Investigating 
Committee 
as"
"statutorily  required.  Hence,  the  inference  that  this  Court  could  reach  is"
"that the Investigating Committee had not made any determination as to"
"the nature of the misconduct, whether it is trivial or grave in compliance"
"with the statutory provisions."
"Since the 2nd to 9th Respondents claim that they have fully complied with"
"the requirement set  out in Section  8(4) of the Act,  the burden lies with"
"the Respondent to satisfy this Court that the Respondents have complied"
"with  such  requirements.  It  is  apparent  that  the  most  prudent  way  to"
"discharge such a burden of proof is for the Respondent to make available"
"the alleged confidential report for the perusal of the Court. The Petitioner"
"submits 
that 
the 
relevant  Respondents  have 
failed 
to  produce  any"
"minutes of the Council or any such report of the Investigating Committee"
"before  the  Court,  which  is  important  for  this  Court  to  determine  as  to"
"whether 
the  due  procedure  and 
the 
legal  requirements  have  been"
"satisfied by the relevant Respondents. The 2nd to 9th Respondents assert"
