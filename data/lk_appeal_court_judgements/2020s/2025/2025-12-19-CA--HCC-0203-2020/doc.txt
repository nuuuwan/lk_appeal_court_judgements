Judgment

1. This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (Hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) against the conviction and sentence dated 13.02.2020 of the High Court

Judge of Balapitiya.

2. The appellant was indicted under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance for possession and trafficking of 21.44 grams of heroin. The trial

commenced on 01.07.2019, during which ten witnesses testified for the prosecution,

and the appellant made a dock statement.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty

on both counts and accordingly convicted him and sentenced him to life

imprisonment. It is against the said conviction and sentence that the appellant has

preferred the present appeal.

4. Although the appellant had advanced eleven grounds of appeal, during the course of

oral submissions learned counsel for the appellant informed Court that he would

confine his arguments to the 1st and 4th grounds of appeal set out in written

submissions.

5. The 1st and 4th grounds of appeal primarily relate to the learned High Court Judge’s

failure to consider the defense’s position that the prosecution evidence is

CA/HCC/0203/2020

3 | P a g e

untrustworthy when tested by the standard of probability. These grounds also

highlight the trial Judge’s failure to properly evaluate the evidence of police officer

D.D. Wijesekara, in particular, his explanation to the Magistrate regarding the initial

refusal by the Government Analyst Department to accept the productions and the

subsequent resealing of the same.

The facts of the case may be briefly stated as follows:

6. According to the prosecution, during the relevant period, PW1 was the Officer-in-

Charge of Ahungalle Police Station. On 13.01.2013, pursuant to information received

from PS Gnanadasa (PW3), PW1 organized a raid. The information indicated that a

person travelling by bus from Colombo to Galle was allegedly carrying a parcel of

heroin.

7. PW1 made the necessary arrangements to conduct the raid and proceeded to a petrol

shed at Ahungalle, accompanied by IP Jayasuriya, PS 28850 Gnanadasa, PS 31908

Karunarathne, PC 13413 Priyantha, and PC 12104 Kalum. The party set off from the

police station at 17.10 hours and reached the petrol station, where they positioned

themselves at different locations. PW1 and IP Jayasuriya were in uniform, while the

remaining officers were in civilian attire.

8. Shortly thereafter, a bus arrived, and upon a signal from PW3, PW1 proceeded to his

location and found a person in PW3’s custody. The person was then taken to the bus

halt, where PW1 conducted a search and recovered a small parcel concealed under the

person’s undergarment. PW1 untied the parcel, examined its contents, and identified

the substance as heroin. Subsequently, the parcel and the appellant were taken to a

jewelry shop, where the substance was weighed. Thereafter, the police party returned

to the station with the appellant and the parcel, and both were handed over to the

police reserve.

9. PW1 admitted in his evidence that he had failed to record the odometer reading of the

police vehicle at the time of leaving for the raid. It is an accepted and well-established

procedure that when police officers leave for an official duty, particularly for a raid of

this nature, the odometer reading of the vehicle used must be recorded. What is more

CA/HCC/0203/2020

4 | P a g e

disturbing is the fact that PW1 left the relevant column blank in the original notes

where the odometer reading was required to be entered, yet when the I.B. extracts

were subsequently forwarded to the Attorney General’s Department, an odometer

reading had been included. This conduct inevitably raises serious doubts as to the

genuineness and authenticity of the alleged raid. The explanation tendered by PW1

for his failure to record the odometer reading at the material time is wholly

unsatisfactory and cannot be accepted.

10. Further, having allegedly received prior information that the appellant was in

possession of a parcel of heroin, and being fully aware that any illegal narcotic

substance recovered is required to be sealed at the place of detection, the police party

had failed to carry the necessary equipment for sealing the alleged recovery. This

omission, viewed in light of the other infirmities already identified, further

undermines the credibility and reliability of the prosecution case.

11. The evidence of PW2 also discloses several infirmities which seriously undermine the

credibility of the prosecution case. PW2 had submitted an affidavit dated 12.02.2013

to the Magistrate’s Court, in which he stated that the raid was conducted at Galkanda

Junction.

12. However, during cross-examination, PW2 admitted that this statement was incorrect

and that the raid had, in fact, been conducted near the bus stand. Further, PW2

admitted that the appellant was searched inside the bus stand, yet no notes whatsoever

were made in respect of this crucial aspect of the raid.

13. According to the evidence of both PW1 and PW2, the police vehicle used for the raid

was driven by PW2. Nevertheless, neither PW1 nor PW2 recorded any odometer

readings in their notes. PW2 further admitted that although he carried a weapon, a

CIB, and cash, he failed to record these items in his notes. He also conceded that,

inadvertently, he had made out-entries in two different places. Additionally, PW2

admitted that although the in-entry reflects a return time of 6.55 p.m., they had in fact

returned to the station at 6.45 p.m. These discrepancies and omissions, viewed

cumulatively, further erode the reliability of the prosecution evidence.

CA/HCC/0203/2020

5 | P a g e

14. It is also in evidence that when the productions were handed over to the Magistrate

Court, only one witness had signed, whereas the procedure requires the signatures of

two witnesses. This omission further undermines the credibility and regularity of the

handling of the productions.

15. The evidence of PW3, PS 28850 Gnanadasa, is also not free from blemish. According

to his testimony, he was the officer who initially received the information; however,

he took approximately forty minutes to communicate the same to PW1. No

satisfactory explanation was offered for this inordinate delay, which casts further

doubt on the reliability of the prosecution narrative.

16. PW2’s evidence regarding the handing over of the productions to the Magistrate Court

further weakens the credibility of the prosecution case, inasmuch as PW5 admitted

that it was he who signed document P8, despite the fact that the productions were

allegedly handed over by PW2. This inconsistency raises a serious doubt as to the

authenticity of the procedure adopted and the reliability of the prosecution evidence

relating to the chain of custody.

17. The credibility of the prosecution evidence was further gravely undermined by the

testimony of Senior Assistant Government Analyst Kanchan Ratnapala. She stated in

her evidence that when the productions pertaining to this case were first brought to the

Government Analyst Department on 20.02.2013, the Department refused to accept

them on the ground that the cover containing the production was damaged.

Consequently, the productions were returned to the officer who had produced them.

According to her testimony, the officer who brought the productions on that occasion

was PC 18334 Wijesekara.

18. When the damaged cover was shown to the witness in Court, it was revealed that the

damaged portion measured approximately 8 cm in length. She further testified that

through this damaged area, it was possible to remove or insert contents without

disturbing the seals.

CA/HCC/0203/2020

6 | P a g e

19. Thereafter, when the productions were brought again to the Government Analyst

Department on 22.02.2013, they were accepted as the damaged cover had been

enclosed within a new sealed cover. The damaged cover was marked P10, while the

new outer cover was marked P3.

20. More significantly, attention was drawn to the Government Analyst’s Report itself,

wherein a substantial discrepancy was noted between the gross weight of the

productions recorded by the police and that recorded by the Government Analyst

Department, amounting to a difference of 12.33 grams. This unexplained discrepancy,

when considered together with the earlier rejection of the productions due to damage

and the possibility of interference without breaking the seals, severely compromises

the integrity of the chain of custody and casts a serious doubt on the reliability of the

prosecution case.

21. The productions were obtained by PW9 from the Magistrate’s Court on 20.02.2013

for the purpose of delivering them to the Government Analyst’s Department.

However, it is evident that PW9 did not deliver the productions on the same day.

Instead, he retained them in his personal locker until 22.02.2013, and only thereafter

delivered them to the Government Analyst’s Department.

22. In my view, this conduct is wholly contrary to accepted procedure and seriously

undermines the integrity of the chain of custody. PW9 did not even take steps to hand

over the productions to the Police Reserve, but instead kept them in his personal

custody. Notably, PW9 had not recorded the time of receiving the productions from

the Magistrate’s Court, nor had he made any such entry in his pocket notebook.

23. In cases of this nature, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt the

integrity of the chain of custody. This requires a clear record of the seizure, handling,

and transfer of the substance from the point of its arrest to its presentation to the

Government Analyst Department for analysis. The chain of custody is essential to

prevent contamination, tampering, or loss, thereby safeguarding the reliability and

authenticity of the evidence.

CA/HCC/0203/2020

7 | P a g e

24. To elaborate, the prosecution must establish that the productions were forwarded to

the Government Analyst from proper custody, without leaving any room for suspicion

of tampering or interference along the way. The most critical stage in this process is

the inward journey, as the reliability of the Government Analyst’s report depends

entirely on the integrity of this transfer.

25. In the instant case, the evidence of PW9, who was responsible for delivering the

productions from the Magistrate Court to the Government Analyst Department, is

fraught with infirmities that go to the very root of the prosecution case. These lapses

have irreparably undermined the credibility of the prosecution evidence, yet,

regrettably, they appear to have escaped the attention of the learned High Court Judge.

26. Furthermore, the out-entry made by PW9 is recorded as 22.15 hours on 21.02.2013,

whereas he left for the Government Analyst’s Department only on 22.02.2013,

thereby contradicting his own testimony. Moreover, according to the in-entry made by

PW9, he returned to the station only on 23.02.2013 at 8.10 a.m. after returning from

the Government Analyst’s Department. Thus, PW9 failed to comply with Police

Regulations by not making the requisite entries on 22.02.2013 itself.

27. The above-mentioned infirmities in the prosecution evidence constitute serious lapses

that cannot be lightly overlooked. The object and purpose of proving the chain of

productions is to ensure that what was recovered is sent to the Government Analyst,

and to exclude any possibility of mixing up or tampering with the production. This

position was emphasized in Witharana Doli Nona vs Republic of Sri Lanka (CA-

19/19) and in Perera vs Attorney General [1998] 1 S.L.R. 378 as follows:

“The prosecution must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The

purpose is to establish that the productions have not been tampered with and

that the very productions taken form the accused-appellant was examined by

the Government Analyst. To this end, the prosecution must prove all the links

of the chain from the time it was taken from the accused-appellant to the

Government Analysts’ Department”

CA/HCC/0203/2020

8 | P a g e

28. In Mahasarukkalige Chandrani vs AG (CA 213/2009 C.A.M. 30.09.2016) Court

observed: Government Analyst Report which is the principal evidence in a drug

offense is entirely dependent on the inward journey of the production chain and

therefore, there is a duty cast on the prosecution to establish the inward journey of the

production with reliable evidence.

29. The importance of proving the chain of evidence was emphasized In S v

Matshaba 2016 (2) SACR 651 (NWM) as follows:

“The importance of proving the chain of evidence is to indicate the absence of

alteration or substitution of evidence. If no admissions are made by the

defence, the State bears the onus to prove the chain of evidence. The State

must establish the name of each person who handles the evidence, the date on

which it was handled and the duration. Failure to establish the chain of

evidence affects the integrity of such evidence and thus renders it

inadmissible”.

30. The aforementioned unexplained and serious lapses in the handling of the

productions, coupled with the failure to adhere to mandatory Police Regulations, have

irreparably compromised the chain of custody. In cases involving narcotic substances,

strict compliance with procedural safeguards is not a mere formality but a substantive

requirement to ensure the integrity and reliability of the evidence. The prosecution has

failed to offer any satisfactory explanation for these deviations. Consequently, the

possibility of tampering or contamination cannot be ruled out. This deficiency strikes

at the very root of the prosecution case and creates a reasonable doubt as to the

authenticity of the production sent for analysis. In such circumstances, it would be

wholly unsafe to allow the conviction to stand.

31. The importance of maintaining accurate and contemporaneous notes by officers

involved in raids of this nature, as well as the necessity of preserving an unbroken

chain of custody of productions from the time of arrest until their delivery to the

Government Analyst for analysis, has been repeatedly emphasized by the courts on

numerous occasions. Regrettably, however, only a few appear to take these

obligations seriously.

CA/HCC/0203/2020

32. It is also pertinent to emphasize the considerable time and public resources expended

by the State in prosecuting cases of this nature. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon the

relevant officers to act with diligence and care when handling narcotics-related

investigations. Failure to do so only serves to enable offenders to evade the arm of the

law. The facts of the present case amply demonstrate the negligent conduct of the

officers concerned.

33. Upon consideration of the foregoing factual and legal context, it is manifestly unsafe

to allow the conviction to stand. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence imposed on

the appellant are set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of all charges. The appeal is

therefore allowed.
