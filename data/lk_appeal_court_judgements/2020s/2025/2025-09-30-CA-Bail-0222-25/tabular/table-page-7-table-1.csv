"and  circumstances  before  the  court  disclose 
that 
there  were  such"
"materials to sustain such a plea then the court must consider whether"
"the accused should be convicted for a lesser offence.”"
"In Jayathilaka v. The Attorney General [2003] 1 SLR 107 the court held"
"that:"
"“Though the accused has not taken up the defence of intoxication if such"
"defence arises on the evidence, it is the duty of the jury to consider the"
"same”."
"In this case there was evidence to show that there was a sudden fight which"
"took place between the Appellant and the deceased. This is further confirmed"
"by the fact that both were not in good terms over an alleged dispute over a"
"paddy field."
"The Learned Senior State Counsel in keeping with the highest tradition of"
"the  Attorney  General’s  Department  informed  this  court  that  this 
is  an"
"appropriate case to be considered under Section 297 of the Penal Code."
"Hence,  considering  all  the  circumstances  of  this  case, 
I  set  aside  the"
"conviction  and  sentence  imposed  on  the  Appellant  on  18.01.2022  by  the"
"Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura."
"I convict the Appellant under Section 297 of the Penal Code and impose 06"
"years  of  rigorous  imprisonment.  A  fine  of  Rs.10,000/-  with  06  months"
"default sentence is also imposed on the Appellant. Further, the Appellant is"
"ordered to pay Rs.200,000/- as compensation to the deceased’s family with"
"a default sentence of 12 months simple imprisonment."
"As the Appellant is in prison since the date of conviction by the Learned High"
"Court Judge, I order the sentence imposed by this Court to be operative from"
"18.01.2022, the date of judgment."
