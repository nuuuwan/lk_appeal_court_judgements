"n this context, I am guided by the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court of India"
"in Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai1, where it was held:"
"“Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of"
"the  case,  has  the  discretion  to  entertain  or  not  to  entertain  a  writ  petition.  But  the"
"High  Court  has  imposed  upon  itself  certain  restrictions,  one  of  which  is  that  if  an"
"effective  and  efficacious  remedy  is  available,  the  High  Court  would  not  normally"
"exercise its jurisdiction."
"However,  the  alternative  remedy  has  been  consistently  held  by  this  Court  not  to"
"operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely: (i) where the writ petition has"
"been  filed  for  the  enforcement  of  any  of  the  fundamental  rights;  (ii)  where  there  has"
"been  a  violation  of  the  principles  of  natural  justice;  or  (iii)  where  the  order  or"
"proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.”"
