"ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES"
"It is a well settled principle that the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140"
"of the Constitution is discretionary and will not ordinarily be exercised where there"
"exists an adequate and efficacious alternative remedy. Courts have consistently held"
"that  where  a  statutory  remedy  exists,  it  must  be  resorted  to  unless  exceptional"
"circumstances are demonstrated."
