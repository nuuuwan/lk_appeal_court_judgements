"In Sigera Vs. Attorney General (Supra, on page 215) His Lordship Ranjith Silva, J held"
"“This cannot in my opinion prejudice the defence in any event as corroboration is"
"not the sine qua non in proving a dying declaration. As I have enumerated in a"
"different  chapter of  his  judgment  an  accused  can  be  convicted for  murder  based"
"mainly and solely on a dying declaration made by a deceased without corroboration"
"under certain circumstances.”"
