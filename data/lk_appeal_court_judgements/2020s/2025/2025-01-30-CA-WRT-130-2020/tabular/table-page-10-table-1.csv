"matters 
concerning  Reservists 
in 
the  Police  Reserve 
Service. 
This"
"limitation was established with the introduction  of the 17th Amendment"
"to  the  Constitution,  which  means  that  Reserve  Police  Officers  are  not"
"entitled  to  appeal  to  NPC  as  such  claims  are  concerned  with  a  period"
"while  serving  as  a  Reserve  Police  Service.  Consequently, 
in  terms  of"
"Section  4  of  the  Administrative  Appeals  Tribunal  Act,  AAT  shall  have  no"
"jurisdiction to entertain the impugned appeal preferred by the Petitioner."
"In  the  given  circumstances,  the  AAT  has  considered  the  appeal  of  the"
"Petitioner and had determined that the NPC, ab initio, lacked jurisdiction"
"to hear and determine the appeal of the Petitioner in respect of a matter"
"that  has  arisen  during  his  service  as  a  Reserve  Police  Officer  because,"
"unlike  the  Regular  Police  Force,  the  disciplinary  matters  of  whom  are"
"governed by the National  Police Commission, the disciplinary matters of"
"the  Reserve  Force  and  Reservists  are  still  subject  to 
the  provisions"
"contained in section 26B(i) and 26(H) of the Police Ordinance."
"As  per  Section  04  of 
the  Administrative  Appeals  Tribunals  Act, 
the"
"Petitioner  has  correctly  pointed  out  that  the  correct  forum  to  prefer  an"
"appeal against a determination of the NPC is the AAT. However, where the"
"NPC has made a determination regarding a matter, in respect of which, it"
"has  no  jurisdiction,  the  AAT  will  be  forced  to  abstain  from  exercising  its"
"appellate  powers 
in 
respect  of 
the 
same  coram  non 
judice  order."
"Therefore,  the  AAT  could  not  have  assumed 
jurisdiction  to  hear  and"
"determine the instant appeal."
"As  such, 
I  am  of 
the  view 
that  the  AAT  was  correct 
in 
issuing 
its"
"determination that the Petitioner is not entitled to forward an appeal in"
"respect of his period of service in the Reserve Police and his remedy lies"
"elsewhere and not with the NPC. Hence, I view that said decision is not"
"contrary  or  barred  by  the  provisions  of  Section  4  of  the  Administrative"
"Appeals Tribunal Act. Accordingly, the application is dismissed."
