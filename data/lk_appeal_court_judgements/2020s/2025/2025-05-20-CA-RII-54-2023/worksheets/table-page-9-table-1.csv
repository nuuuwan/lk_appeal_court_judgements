"Kankaanamge  Somasiri  de  Silva  &  Others  CA/RII/1/2018,  Decided  on"
"21.02.2019, His Lordship Samayawardhena, J held,"
"“It must be stressed that “the power to grant relief by way of restitutio in"
"integrum  is  a  matter  of  grace  and  discretion.”  (Usoof  v.  Nadarajah"
"Chettiar,  58  NLR  436)  The  petitioner  cannot  seek  restitution  as  of"
"right.  There  are  several 
thresholds  matters 
to  be  sorted  out  before"
"addressing the core issue………. One such important hurdle to overcome is"
"that “relief by way of restitutio in integrum should be sought for with the"
"utmost promptitude.” Vide Menchinahamy v. Muniweera, Babun Appu"
"Insurance  Corporation  Limited 
v. 
v.  Simon  Appu,  Sri  Lanka"
"Shanmugam …………, it is crystal clear that the petitioner has not acted"
"with  the utmost promptitude  when she decided  to come before  this Court"
"more than two years after the District Court held against her. The delay is"
"too long by any stretch of imagination particularly because the final order"
"of the District Court against her was not ex parte but inter partes…………"
"The explanation for delay over two years is unacceptable. Hence, on that"
"ground  alone,  the  application  of  the  petitioner  is  liable  to  be  dismissed.”"
