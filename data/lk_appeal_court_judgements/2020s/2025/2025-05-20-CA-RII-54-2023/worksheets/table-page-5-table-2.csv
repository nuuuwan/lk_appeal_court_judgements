"Respondents have not come with a clean hand and is guilty of misrepresentation"
"and suppression of material facts. Those were that;"
"a)  The  Respondents  have  failed  to  establish  their  possession  against  the"
"possession of the Petitioner since 1973."
"b) Although a Fiscal Officer came to execute the writ of possession against"
"the  Petitioner,  the  Petitioner  continued  to  be  in  possession  of  the  land  in"
"dispute. (he was never dispossessed)"
"c) The Petitioner further says since the Respondents were not in possession,"
"there  was  no  necessity,  therefore,  he  did  not  take  any  step  to  evict  the"
"Respondents."
