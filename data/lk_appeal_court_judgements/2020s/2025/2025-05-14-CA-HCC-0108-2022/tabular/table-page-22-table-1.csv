"resulted

series

"misunderstanding 
involving  mistaken 
identity, 
the  police  officers,"
"believing themselves to be responding to a threat, have discharged their"
"weapons 
in  the  direction  of  the  appellant  and  the  deceased.  The"
"appellant has subsequently witnessed the horrifying moment when the"
"deceased  was  struck  by  police  gunfire.  While 
the  appellant  has"
"presented this narrative as a critical part of his defence, it is important"
"to  note  that  key  elements  of  this  account  have  not  been  brought  up"
"during the cross examination of prosecution witnesses. The omissions"
"of the appellant’s perspective during this critical phase of the trial raises"
"significant  concerns  about  the  credibility  of  his  claims.  Furthermore,"
"the 
failure  to  address  this  omission 
leaves  unanswered  questions"
"regarding the reliability of the appellant’s account, which appears to be"
"an afterthought rather than a well-integrated part of the defence of the"
"appellant."
