  "keywords": "The Petitioner is the Foreign Employment Bureau, who advertised to fill the vacancies in the Administrative Class of the cadre internally. The 4th to 22nd Respondents were among the candidates who had applied; however, they did not obtain the required marks. A dispute arose and the matter was referred to arbitration. The arbitral award was granted in favour of the 4th to 22nd Respondent, however, it did not consider the fact that there were no vacancies existing at the time to absorb them into the cadre. Writ of Certiorari and Prohibition issued quashing the said arbitral award.",
