"respondents. 
  The  petitioners 
further  stated  that 
in  January  2022,  the"
"victims  of  the  1st  and  2nd  respondents  wrote  to  the  then  Minister  of  Public"
"Security, complaining of the fraud committed against them by the 1st and 2nd"
"respondents. 
  As  a  result, 
the 
then  Minister  of  Public  Security  made"
"inquiries  of  the  4th  respondent  regarding  a  pre-payment  mechanism  for  the"
"victims  of  the  1st  and  2nd  respondents.    The  4th  respondent  replied  to  the"
"then  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  stating,  inter  alia,  that  the  4th  respondent"
"had  refused  the  repayment  plan  presented  by  the  1st  respondent.  The  3rd"
"respondent  had  also  constantly  reminded  the  Attorney  General  to  initiate"
"legal  action  against 
the  1st  and  2nd  respondents.  Furthermore, 
the  4th"
"respondent  is  not  in  a  position  to  repay  the  victims  of  the  1st  respondent,"
"and  repayment  should  be  made  through  a  judicial  process.    A  copy  of  that"
"letter was produced with the petition marked P7.  The petitioners state that"
"after  receiving 
the  report 
from 
the  4th  respondent, 
the  3rd,  5th 
to  9th"
"respondents are under a statutory obligation in terms of Section 42 (6) of the"
"Act 
to  do  one  or  all  of 
the  stipulated  acts 
therein, 
including 
issuing"
"directions to the persons and/or entities,  who has carried finance business"
"legally to repay the deposit liabilities.  The petitioners state that the 3rd, 6th"
"to 9th respondents, in the letter marked P7, have taken the position that they"
"were not legally empowered to formulate a repayment plan and/or direct the"
"1st and 2nd respondents to repay the deposit liabilities.  In terms of Section"
"42 (6) of the Act, the 3rd, 6th to 9th respondents have given discretion to make"
"necessary  orders  or  directions  in  respect  of  the  deposits  accepted  without"
"legal  authority.  The  petitioners 
further  state 
that 
the  3rd,  6th 
to  9th"
"respondents  have  failed  to  direct  the  1st  and  2nd  respondents  to  come  up"
"with a mechanism to adequately repay the depositors/victims of the 1st and"
"2nd  respondents  or  institute  legal  action  against  the  same.    The  petitioners"
"further state that the 1st and 2nd  respondents are able to carry on the said"
"illegal  finance  business,  accepting  the  deposits  from  the  public  legally  with"
"licenses from the Monetary Board, due to the failure on the part of the 3rd to"
"9th  respondents 
to  supervise  and  regulate  as  set  out 
in 
the  Act.  The"
"petitioner states that in totality of the aforesaid circumstances, the decision"
"reflected in the letter marked P7 refusing to take action or issue a direction"
"on the 1st and 2nd respondents for the repayment of deposit liabilities  is;"
