"The  3rd 
to  11th 
respondents  denied  having  acted 
illegally,  unlawfully,"
"unreasonably,  irrationally,  maliciously,  in  a  disproportionate  manner  with"
"respect to any transaction, dealing, correspondence, order, determination or"
"any  other  matter  affecting  the  petitioner  or  any  persons  claiming  under"
"them. 
  They 
further  stated  that  they  have  acted 
in  good 
faith  and 
in"
"accordance with the law.  They further stated that the respondents have, at"
"no stage, pursued a collateral purpose or acted with an improper motive."
"T
he  respondents 
further  submitted  that  CBSL  continuously  engaged 
in"
"conducting  awareness  programs  at 
the  national  and  regional 
levels 
to"
"educate  the  public  on  the  risk  of  depositing  money  with  unauthorized"
"entities/persons.  A list of institutions authorized by CBSL to accept public"
"deposits  is  given  on  the  website  of  the  CBSL.      Therefore,  as  responsible"
"citizens, the petitioners have failed to act in their social obligation and have"
"sponsored an unauthorized finance business.  According to section 55 of the"
"Act,  any  person  who  abets,  conspires,  or  attempts  to  commit  an  offence"
"under  the  Act  shall  be  guilty  of  an  offence  and  shall  be  punishable  in  the"
"same manner as for the substantive offence under the Act."
"The  respondents  have  further  stated  that  the  petitioners  have  not  come  to"
"court with clean hands as they have acted irresponsibly in depositing money"
"in  the  1st  and  2nd  respondents  for  obtaining  high  level  of  interest  rates  (by"
"taking  a  high  risk)  instead  of  depositing  such  money  in  licensed  banks  or"
"licensed  finance  companies  which  are  listed  by  CBSL  as  the  institution"
"which are having authority to accept deposits from the public."
"I
n  addition  to  the  above  objections  at  the  hearing,  Learned  Counsel  for  the"
"3rd 
to  11th 
respondents  argued 
that 
there  are  nearly 
ten 
thousand"
"depositors,  while  the  petitioners  represent  only  eighteen  depositors.  It  was"
"further  submitted  on  behalf  of 
the  respondents 
that, 
in 
terms  of 
the"
"provisions  of  section  58  of 
the  Act, 
this  court  has  no 
jurisdiction 
to"
"determine the petitioner’s application."
"T
here  are  18  petitioners  in  this  application.    Petitioners  state  that  they  are"
"representing the members of an unregistered association called  “අසාධාරණයට"
"ලක්වු  ඉයයෝන්  ලංකා  සාමාජිකයන්යේ  සංගමය”.  Petitioners  have  attached  a  list  of"
"3,480  names  of  their  members.    However,  petitioners  have  not  submitted"
"any  evidence  to  show  that  they  represent  all  those  3,480  members  of  the"
"said  informal  association.    The  1st  and  2nd  respondents  themselves  have"
"represented  that  there  are  9,449  depositors.    Paragraph  15  of  the  petition"
"states  as  follows:  “The  petitioner  states  they  have  now  become  aware  that"
"the  1st  and  2nd 
respondents  have  unlawfully  and  wrongfully  accepted"
