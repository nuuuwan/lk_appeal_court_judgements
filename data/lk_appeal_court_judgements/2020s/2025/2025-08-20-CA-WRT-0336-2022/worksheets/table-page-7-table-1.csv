"payment plan to the Monetary Board, agreeing to pay off his victims, subject"
"to lifting the freezing orders issued by the High Court.  The Monetary Board"

"1st  respondent,  and  he  was  directed  to  devise  a  more  detailed  and  effective"
"mechanism for repaying his victims.  The petitioner further states that they"
"believe  that,  thereafter,  the  1st  respondent  submitted  a  payment  plan  and,"

"victims.  However, the said proposal was also rejected by the 3rd, 5th, and 9th"
