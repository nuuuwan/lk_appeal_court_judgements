"n the case of Kumar De Silva and two others vs, Attorney General  [2010] 2"
"Sri LR 169, Sarath de Abrew J.   noted that;"
"“Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. The acceptance or rejection"
"of  evidence  of  witnesses  is,  therefore,  a  question  of  fact  for  the  trial"
"Judge.  Evidence  must  be  weighed  and  never  countered;  in  reviewing"
"the  veracity  of  a  witness,  appellate  Courts  enforce  certain  rules  and"
"guidelines as they do not have the benefit of observing and questioning"
"the witnesses first land.”"
