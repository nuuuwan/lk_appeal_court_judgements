"procedural  care  for  a  critically  ill  patient  on  13.03.2015.  The  evidence  adduced  at  the"
"inquiry establishes that the Petitioner:"
"•  Went on half-day leave while the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit following"
"cardiac arrest;"
"• 
Failed to formally handover clinical responsibility to another consultant;"
"• 
Continued 
to 
issue 
instructions 
telephonically, 
thereby 
maintaining"
"responsibility without being physically present (Inquiry Proceedings, pp. 86–88,"
"232–239)."
"The  Respondent  submits  that such conduct  amounts  to gross negligence, violating the"
"professional duty of care and constituting grave misconduct under the Establishments"
"Code.  The  documentary  evidence  and 
inquiry  proceedings  show  that  her  absence"
"contributed to a gap in clinical oversight, resulting in the death of a patient."
"M
oreover,  the  Petitioner’s  claims  that  she  was  denied  the  opportunity  to  lead  full"
"evidence  are  adequately  rebutted.  The  Inquiry  Officer  was  compelled  to  manage  the"
"proceedings in view of repeated adjournments and the Petitioner’s unexplained absence"
"on  critical  dates,  which  were  neither  substantiated  nor  excused  in  accordance  with"
"Section 21:2 of the Establishments Code (marked P11(o); P11(p); Inquiry Proceedings,"
"12.07.2019)."
"T
he  Petitioner’s  assertion  that  she  was  deprived  of  a  fair  hearing  and  that  natural"
"justice was  violated is misconceived and exaggerated. The inquiry spanned 88 sittings"
"over  nearly  four  years.  The  Petitioner  was  represented  by  senior  counsel,  allowed  to"
"cross-examine  prosecution  witnesses,  and  lead  defence  evidence.  In  this  context,  the"
"fact that her defence was curtailed at a certain stage due to procedural lapses and her"
"own non-appearance cannot be construed as a denial of justice per se."
"T
he Respondent emphasizes that the Principle of Audi Alteram Partem was adhered to"
"throughout the proceedings. The ex parte conclusion on 12.07.2019 occurred only after"
"repeated  postponements,  a 
failure 
to  appear,  and  express 
indication 
from 
the"
"Petitioner’s  attorney  that  she  was  no  longer  participating  (marked  ‘P11(q)’;  Inquiry"
"Proceedings,  12.07.2019).  This  process  was  consistent  with  Section  21:15  of 
the"
"Establishments Code, which allows for the accused officer to submit a written statement"
"in lieu of oral evidence where the inquiry cannot proceed further (‘P11(s)’)."
"T
he Petitioner’s reliance on the alleged delay in concluding the inquiry is not fatal to the"
"process.  The  Respondent  correctly  argues  that  the  timeframes  stipulated  in  Section"
"22:1:1  of  the  Establishments  Code  are  directory,  not  mandatory.  The 
inquiry  was"
"extended due to procedural applications and the complex nature of evidence, not due to"
"any mala fides on the part of the Hospital Board."
