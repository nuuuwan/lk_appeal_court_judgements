"disciplinary  board  and  serve  a  charge  sheet  on  the  Petitioner.  Consequently,  the"
"Petitioner was placed on compulsory leave with effect from the same date. The charge"
"sheet  marked  “P7”  contained  several  charges  of  gross  misconduct  and  negligence"
"arising  out  of  the  Petitioner’s  alleged  failure  to  adequately  attend  to  the  patient  post-"
"procedure and to provide continuous care despite the patient being in critical condition."
"P
ursuant  to  the  said  charge  sheet,  a  formal  disciplinary  inquiry  was  instituted.  The"
"inquiry commenced on 3rd October 2015 and was conducted by Mr. K.K.G.S.F. Perera, a"
"retired judicial officer, whose appointment was not objected to by the Petitioner at any"
"stage prior to or during the initial phase of the inquiry. The Petitioner was represented"
"by  senior  counsel  and  participated  in  the  proceedings  through  to  their  substantial"
"conclusion."
"T
he  prosecution  concluded 
its  case  after  69  sittings  spanning  over  32  months."
"Thereafter, 
the  defence  commenced 
leading  evidence  on  18th 
July  2018.  Several"
"witnesses  were 
led  by 
the  defence, 
including 
senior  medical  professionals  and"
"administrative 
staff  of 
Sri 
Jayewardenepura  General  Hospital.  The  proceedings"
"continued until July 2019, when the inquiry was concluded  ex parte, following a series"
"of adjournments and the Petitioner’s failure to attend a scheduled hearing, allegedly due"
"to  non-receipt  of  notice.  An  order  was  thereafter  delivered  on  25th  September  2019,"
"wherein  the  Inquiry  Officer  found  the  Petitioner  guilty  of  all  charges  levelled  against"
"her."
"S
ubsequently,  on  3rd  June  2020,  the  Board  of  Sri  Jayewardenepura  General  Hospital,"
"acting  upon 
the 
findings  of 
the 
inquiry, 
issued 
the  decision  marked 
“P17” 
to"
"compulsorily retire the Petitioner from service. It is this decision that is now impugned"
"before this Court."
"T
he  Petitioner,  by  way  of  her  application,  contends  that  the  inquiry  was  vitiated  by"
"procedural  irregularities,  including  denial  of  a  fair  hearing,  bias  on  the  part  of  the"
"Inquiry Officer, unlawful curtailment of her defence, and inordinate delay in concluding"
"the 
inquiry.  She  further  submits  that  the  decision  to  retire  her  compulsorily  was"
"motivated by mala fides and constituted an abuse of power."
"T
he Respondents, by their Statement of Objections dated 10th July 2023, assert that the"
"disciplinary  proceedings  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  Establishments  Code"
"and  the  governing  statute  of  the  1st  Respondent,  and  that  the  Petitioner  was  afforded"
"ample opportunity to defend herself. They further contend that the inquiry process was"
"not  objected  to  by  the  Petitioner  at  its  inception  and  that  the  Petitioner  is  guilty  of"
"laches  in  challenging  the  disciplinary  process  only  after  an  adverse  finding  had  been"
"made."
