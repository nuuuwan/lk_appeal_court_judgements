"T
he  Petitioner,  challenges  the  lawfulness,  propriety,  and  fairness  of  the  disciplinary"
"proceedings  initiated  against  her  and  the  resultant  decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  to"
"compulsorily retire her from service by letter dated 3rd June 2020 (marked ‘P17’)."
"T
he  Petitioner's  principal  contention  is  that  the  entire  inquiry  process  commencing"
"from the preliminary investigation to the issuance of the retirement letter was tainted"
"with  procedural  impropriety,  bias,  mala  fides,  and  a  breach  of  natural  justice,  thereby"
"rendering the decision ultra vires and amenable to judicial review by way of writ."
"T
he  Petitioner  states 
that  she  was  a  senior  Consultant  General  Surgeon  at  Sri"
"Jayewardenepura  General  Hospital  with  an  exemplary  professional  record,  who  had"
"rendered  distinguished 
service, 
including 
training 
in 
the  United  Kingdom 
and"
"performing life-saving surgeries for war victims (marked ‘P2(m)’, ‘P2(n)’, ‘P2(e)’)"
"T
he Petitioner alleges long-standing institutional malice and personal animus directed"
"at her by senior hospital administrators, particularly Dr. S.A.K. Gamage, who is  said to"
"have harassed her and created a hostile work environment, as corroborated by sworn"
"statements from other doctors (marked ‘P2(r)’, ‘P2(s)’)."
"T
he  core  of  the  Petitioner’s  challenge  lies  in  the  alleged  procedural  irregularities  and"
"lack of fair hearing in the formal disciplinary inquiry, including:"
"• 
The  prosecution  was  allowed  69  sittings  over  32  months  to  present  its  case,"
"while the defence was limited to 16 sittings and was abruptly curtailed, violating"
"the principle of audi alteram partem (Inquiry Proceedings; Pages 626–813)."
"• 
The  Inquiring  Officer  is  alleged  to  have  unfairly  struck  off  the  testimony  of  Dr."
"Rekha  Gamage,  a  key  defence  witness,  despite  her  absence  being  justifiably"
"explained due to a medical emergency (Proceedings, 26.05.2019, Page 972)."
"T
he  Petitioner  was  then  directed  to  commence  her  own  evidence  prematurely,  and"
"when she was medically unable to attend on 8th June 2019, the Inquiry Officer, allegedly"
"under  pressure  from  a  letter  dated  30th  April  2019  issued  by  the  Chairman,  moved"
"hastily to close the inquiry ex parte without ensuring proper service of notice (marked"
"‘P12(b)’; ‘P11(o)’, ‘P11(p)’, ‘P11(q)’)."
"T
he Petitioner submits that the Inquiry Officer acted contrary to Section 21:2 and 21:15"
"of the Establishments Code by:"
"• 
Proceeding ex parte without valid service of notice when the Petitioner had not"
"failed to appear consecutively without cause;"
"• 
Forcing  the  Petitioner  to  submit  a  written  statement 
in 
lieu  of  giving  oral"
"testimony,  thereby  depriving  her  of  the  right  to  present  her  defence  in  the"
"manner of her choosing (Establishments Code; P11(s))."
