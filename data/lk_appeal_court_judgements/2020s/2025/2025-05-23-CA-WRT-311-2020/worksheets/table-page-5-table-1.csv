"T
he Petitioner contends that the inquiry spanned over four years, far exceeding the one-"
"year time frame  prescribed under Section  22:1:1 of the  Establishments  Code. She was"
"placed on compulsory leave from 6th August 2015 and was only reinstated in May 2019,"
"and even then, without being permitted to resume her original duties (P13; P9; R4)."
"T
he Final Order of the Inquiry was issued only on 25th September 2019, followed by the"
"disciplinary decision being taken on 3rd June 2020, almost five years after the incident"
"that led to the proceedings."
"T
he Petitioner asserts that she had a legitimate expectation to continue in service up to"
"the age of 65 as per the prevailing Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital policy and her"
"prior record, and that the decision to retire her compulsorily at the age of 50 is arbitrary"
"and constitutes a disproportionate exercise of discretion, done with the ulterior motive"
"of frustrating her employment (P1(g); P26)."
