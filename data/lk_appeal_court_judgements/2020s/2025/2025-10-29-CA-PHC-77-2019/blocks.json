Nevertheless, by virtue of the casus omissus provision contained in the Act, the provisions of the Civil or Criminal Procedure Codes may, where appropriate, be applied with necessary adaptations to fill that procedural gap. The legal and practical consequence of the learned Magistrate\u2019s failure to consider the application to purge default is that the Appellant remains a party in default and, as such, is not entitled to participate in the inquiry. In proceedings under Section 66, even where a party\u2019s request to fully re-enter the inquiry is refused, Section 66(8) nonetheless obliges the Court to take into account any material on record relating to the claims of the defaulting party when making its determination and order.",

Section 66(8)(b) of the PCP Act has not expressly specified whether \u201cthe material\u201d to be considered includes that filed subsequently by a party who has been declared in default. It stands to reason that Section 66(8)(b) contemplates only material that was before the Court prior to the party being declared in default. To give a different interpretation would allow the defaulting party to achieve indirectly what they are not permitted to do directly, thereby defeating the legislative intent underlying Section 66(8).",
