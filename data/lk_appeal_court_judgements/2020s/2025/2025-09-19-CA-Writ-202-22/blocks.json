The total number of students is around 900. Therefore, faculty as a whole satisfies the IESL staff-student ratio of 1:12, but at department level it does not reflect as satisfactory. Therefore at least 15 academic staff could be considered as satisfactory and that shall be satisfied. It is recommended to maintain a maximum intake number, which is considered to be around 50.

In my view, the 1st \u2013 7th Respondents had given a reason as to why the sub-committee was appointed. It was argued that the 1st Respondent was accredited to a world body and that is the recognition the Petitioners are seeking. It was submitted in view of the accreditation with the world body, the Respondents have to maintain and keep the high standards of the world body and the said standards should be maintained by the degree awarding institutions that seeks recognition of the 1st Respondent. It was further argued that if the 1st Respondent recognises an institution that falls short of the requirements there is a danger of the 1st Respondent\u2019s accreditation to the world body being challenged. Therefore, it is 1st-7th Respondents contention that by encouraging the institutions to promote their degree programmes to IESL recognised standards, the institutions improve themselves and thereby the final product, the fully qualified engineers. It appears as submitted to keep with the said purpose, it is necessary to maintain a strict and rigorous scrutiny of the institutions which seek recognition. Therefore, it is argued that until the said institute improves their quality of education, the said institutes and their degree awarding programmes would not be given recognition by the 1st Respondent. In keeping with the above and taking into consideration the serious infirmities in the degree programme offered by the 8th Respondent, the 1st Respondent had decided to appoint a sub-committee to consider the application pertaining to the awarding of the recognition.",

Once it is recognised, it is included in the recognised institutions list of the 1st Respondent. For a non-recognised institution to be recognised, the said institution has to make an application. Hence, merely because an institute awards a degree or has an engineering degree programme the recognition does not come to an institution as of right. If the Petitioners were eager to receive a degree that is recognised by the IESL then, when the Petitioners joined the 8th Respondent and commenced their studies it was incumbent on them to ascertain whether the institution, they had joined is recognised by the IESL. As it was submitted at the argument stage, it is not all students who want the said recognition. Therefore, a student who wishes to be qualified as an engineer from a IESL recognised degree programme should be aware of the fact as to whether the institution awarding the degree programme is IESL recognised or not. Hence, when a student joins a degree programme it is of paramount importance for the student to ascertain whether the institution they join to complete the degree has IESL recognition for the degree. Unfortunately, at the time the Petitioners joined the degree programme at the KDU, the 8th Respondent, they had not considered this factor. As at the time of joining as well as at the time of their qualifying as engineers the 8th Respondent had no recognition from the IESL for its degree programmes. Thus, the Petitioners could not have harboured a legitimate expectation to obtain IESL recognition at the time they graduated.",

Hence, it is their contention that they had a legitimate expectation of obtaining a conditional recognition. Thus, when the 1st Respondent refused to grant the said conditional recognition by P10, the said expectation was frustrated. In considering this submission, I find that for legitimate expectations to be harboured, the said expectation should be derived from an undertaking or specific, explicit expression made by a person of authority, and I would consider the said expression or communication should be communicated to the person who argues that by the said act there was a legitimate expectation created in him. A party can always argue that there is an expectation, however, whether the said expectation becomes legitimate or not depends on the circumstances and facts of each and every case, as the concept of legitimate expectation in a given circumstance becomes a question of fact rather than law. In coming to the said conclusion, I have considered the judgments of Samarakoon and Others v. University Grants Commission and others (2005) 1 SLR 119 and also Siriwardena v.

One is an automatic registration upon application if he has a degree from a recognised university.

The Petitioners themselves in paragraph 45 of the Petition have conceded on this path and stated that the 17th \u2013 28th Petitioners had followed this path and sat for the GQE as Associate Engineers of the IESL. Hence, it is established that if an engineer has a degree in civil engineering that is not recognised by the IESL, he can still obtain IESL recognition and be an Associated Member by siting for the GQE paper. Thus, in my view, the Petitioners have an alternative remedy to obtain recognition for their degree. In this instance it is also pertinent to observe that the Petitioners contended that passing the said GQE examination is extremely difficult and the 17th- 28th Petitioners have sat for the exam and failed. In response, the learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for 1st -7th Respondents submitted that the 1st Respondent has to maintain the high standard that is maintained by them under the Washington Accord and that was the main reason why the IESL does not grant recognition for each and every degree programme as their evaluation would fall less than the accepted standard. It was further submitted that once the 8th Respondent complied with the recommendation and improves their degree programmes it",

Hence, based on these two documents it was argued that the UGC had recognised the degree programmes which are more fully stated in the letter dated 24.05.2010 which is addressed to the UGC by the Vice Chancellor of the KDU. In view of these letters the Petitioners contended that when a degree programme is recognised by the UGC, the 1st Respondent cannot refuse to recognise the said degree programme (P10). As stated earlier, this Court observes that the 1st Respondent, as per Act No. 04 of 2017 has the power to register and recognise certain degree programmes. The degree programmes awarded by all universities are not automatically recognised by the 1st Respondent. The by-laws of the 1st Respondent and the manual marked P5 specifies the procedure to recognise an engineering degree. Knowing this, the 8th Respondent had made the application to recognise the degree and willingly on the payment of money had subjected its degree programmes for the evaluation process, which was carried out and resulted in P10, where the IESL for the reasons stated therein refused to recognise the degree programme.",

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners also submitted that under rule 8.4 of the document marked P5, it was imperative for the IESL to make its decision for the recognition for its programme of study and the said recognition should be based on the recommendations of the Education Standing Committee.

Hence, in my view, the document P5 will have no bearing on the degree programme marked as P10. However, even as per rule 8.4 it demonstrates that the 1st Respondent is not bound to make a decision on recognition for a programme of study only based on the recommendation made by the Education Standing Committee as rule 8.4 also allows the 1st Respondent to take into consideration any other relevant submissions. Hence, I am compelled to agree with the submissions made by the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the 1st-7th Respondents. In refusing to recognise the degree programme of the 8th Respondent, the 1st Respondent had considered the infirmities of the 1st Evaluation Panel and the infirmities and recommendations for improvement by the Education Standing Committee and the sub-committee appointed by by-law 63.

Further, the 8th Respondent themselves have made an application pertaining to the recognition of its degree course which was evaluated by the Evaluation Panel and the Education Committee. The 1st Respondent did not recommend full recognition due to the infirmities highlighted in their report. The 1st Respondent had replied by P10 when refusing to grant recognition. The said recognition is granted after evaluation of the degree programme offered by the 8th Respondent and that is pursuant to the application of the 8th Respondent after paying a fee.

The said three committees consists of professionals and experts in the said field. The Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Mandamus to get a recognition for an educational institute which the 1st Respondent Institution had refused to grant recognition and which the said institution itself has accepted. In my view, the Court should be reluctant to impose the Court\u2019s opinion pertaining to the recognition of degrees by education institutes over the opinion of experts in the field. In coming to this conclusion, I am guided by the decision in Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara v. University of Colombo and others CA Writ 844/2021decided on 08.06.2018 where the Court held \u201cThe consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie within the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities, the Court has to be slow and circumspect before interfering with any decision taken by them in connection therewith.\u201d The said judgment goes further, and states as follows, \u201cThis is mainly because of want of judicially manageable standards and necessary expertise to assess, scrutinise and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions.\u201d",

Further, the procedure established by the material submitted would be for an engineer whose degree programme is not recognised by the Respondents is to sit for the GQE. Hence, the Petitioners seek to quash the decision which would amount to the 1st -7th Respondents acting ultra vires to their own by-laws and manuals. As correctly submitted by the learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the Respondents and was disputed by the Petitioners, the Petitioners who are qualified with an engineering degree are not barred from carrying out their engineering duties without being registered by the 1st Respondent. Hence, if the Petitioners do not wish to sit for the GQE which allows degree holders whose degree programmes are not recognised by the 1st Respondent, to obtain the 1st Respondent\u2019s Associate Membership. The Petitioners are free to engage in their duties as engineers without sitting for the exam. However, they would not fall within the definition of engineers practicing engineering within the meaning of the Act. The Petitioners have failed to impugn the purported decision which they claim directed them to sit for the GQE. Hence, in my view, the main substantive prayers of the Petitioners have to fail. Though the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the 1st -7th Respondents raised many other preliminary objections, in view of my findings above, there is no necessity to consider the said objections.",
