"he appointment of the sub-committee"
"T
his Court has carefully considered the submissions of the Petitioners and the response of"
"the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents. In my view, the 1st – 7th Respondents"
"had given a reason as to why the sub-committee was appointed. It was argued that the 1st"
"Respondent was accredited to a world body and that is the recognition the Petitioners are"
"seeking. It was submitted in view of the accreditation with the world body, the Respondents"
"have  to  maintain  and  keep  the  high  standards  of  the  world  body  and  the  said  standards"
"should be maintained by the degree awarding institutions that seeks recognition of the 1st"
"Respondent. It was further argued that if the 1st Respondent recognises an institution that"
"falls short of the requirements there is a danger of the 1st Respondent’s accreditation to the"
"world  body  being  challenged.  Therefore,  it  is  1st-7th  Respondents  contention  that  by"
"encouraging  the  institutions  to  promote  their  degree  programmes  to  IESL  recognised"
"standards,  the  institutions  improve  themselves  and  thereby  the  final  product,  the  fully"
"qualified engineers. It appears as submitted to keep with the said purpose, it is necessary"
"to  maintain  a  strict  and  rigorous  scrutiny  of  the  institutions  which  seek  recognition."
"Therefore, it is argued that until the said institute improves their quality of education, the"
"said institutes and their degree awarding programmes would not be given recognition by"
"the  1st  Respondent.  In  keeping  with  the  above  and  taking  into consideration  the  serious"
"infirmities in the degree programme offered by the 8th Respondent, the 1st Respondent had"
"decided to appoint a sub-committee to consider the application pertaining to the awarding"
"of the recognition."
