"would be in par with the accepted standards of the Washington Accord, whereby the 8th"
"Respondent’s degree programme could be granted recognition."
"D
o the Petitioners have an alternative remedy?"
"I
t was contended by the learned President’s Counsel for the 1st – 7th Respondents that the"
"Petitioners have a more efficacious and speedy alternative remedy to overcome the obstacle"
"of them not being able to practice as engineering practitioners in Sri Lanka. The attention"
"of the Court was drawn to by-law 7, whereby it was argued that the Petitioners can apply"
"themselves  to  be  Associate  Members  in  the  absence  of  their  university  degree  being"
"recognised by the 1st Respondent."
"I
t was submitted that they can still sit for the GQE and upon obtaining the prescribed pass"
"mark  they  would  become  eligible  to  apply  for  admission  as  an  Associate  Member."
"However, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the only a few applicants"
"have  passed  the  said  examination.  Hence,  they  submitted  that  it  is  not  an  alternative"
"remedy. In response, the learned President’s Counsel for 1st to 7th Respondents vigorously"
"contended  that  the  entire  syllabus  for  the  said  GQE  exam  is  set  in  accordance  with  the"
"Washington  Accord.  Hence,  if  an  applicant  is  not  fit  to  pass  the  examination,  he  is"
"unsuitable  to  be  granted  Associate  Membership.  This  Court  is  mindful  in  keeping  the"
"standards in accordance with the Washington Accord is the duty of the examiner and the"
"Court should not and would not wear the shoes of the examiners. However, I am inclined"
"to accept the submissions of the Respondents that in keeping with the Washington Accord"
"and the international accreditation and recognition, the standard and quality of the exam"
"has to be high."
"D
oes the 1st Respondent have the power to recognise universities?"
"T
he learned Counsel for the Petitioners also advanced an argument to state that in refusing"
"recognition to the 8th Respondent, which is a recognised university under the University"
"Grants Commission (hereinafter referred to as ‘UGC’) the 1st Respondent’ is usurping the"
"powers of the UGC. Further it was contended that through the decision refusing to extend"
"the  recognition  to  the  8th  Respondent,  the  1st  Respondent  acts  in  ultra  vires  the  powers"
"granted as they do not have the power or the competence to recognise universities. It was"
"their contention that the power to recognise universities is vested with the UGC and KDU"
