"Prayers (e) and (f) seek Writs of Mandamus against the 1st- 7th Respondents to grant full"
"recognition of IESL for the degree programme of the 8th Respondent pertaining to the 31st-"
"34th  intakes.  I  observe  that  this  prayer  is  completely  contrary  to  the  recognition  of  the"
"procedure  which  is  tendered  to  this  Court.  Further,  the  8th  Respondent  themselves  have"
"made an application pertaining to the recognition of its degree course which was evaluated"
"by  the  Evaluation  Panel  and  the  Education  Committee.  The  1st  Respondent  did  not"
"recommend  full  recognition  due  to  the  infirmities  highlighted  in  their  report.  The  1st"
"Respondent had replied by P10 when refusing to grant recognition. The said recognition is"
"granted after evaluation of the degree programme offered by the 8th Respondent and that is"
"pursuant to the application of the 8th Respondent after paying a fee. In the view of this, the"
"Court finds that the Petitioners do not have a legal right to seek a Writ of Mandamus to"
"direct the 1st -7th Respondents to grant full recognition in violation of the said procedure."
