"It is also observed by this Court that the procedure of the 1st Respondent to recognise a"
"degree programme is clearly depicted in P5 which reads “Manual for the Recognition of"
"Four-Year Engineering Degrees Conducted in Sri Lanka”. The said manual clearly sets out"
"how and the mode of recognising a degree programme of the IESL. The learned Counsel"
"for the Petitioners also submitted that under rule 8.4 of the document marked P5, it was"
"imperative for the IESL to make its decision for the recognition for its programme of study"
"and  the  said  recognition  should  be  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Education"
"Standing Committee. Hence, any deviations from this manual were argued to be ultra vires"
"and bad in law."
