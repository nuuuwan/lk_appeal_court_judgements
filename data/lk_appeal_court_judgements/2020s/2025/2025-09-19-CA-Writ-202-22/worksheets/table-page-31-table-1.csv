"exercise extreme caution if asked to consider, for example whether the Petitioner is"
"entitled to more marks than what has actually been given by the examiners.”"
"F

"learned DSG for the 8th -11th and 14th Respondent they had submitted a fresh application"
"for recognition of their degree courses. Hence, this prayer has to fail."
"F
urther,  relief  (f)  cannot  succeed  as  stated  elsewhere  in  this  judgement  the  Petitioners"
"cannot seek a Writ of Mandamus to grant conditional recognition to the degree programmes"
"awarded by the 8th Respondent when the said recognition is conditional and in the absence"
"of any evidence submitted by the 8th Respondent to establish that they had complied with"
"any of the conditions in the recommendation."

n prayer (d) the Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the"
"1st Respondent directing the Petitioners to sit for the GQE.  The Court observes that in this"
"instance also the Petitioners have failed to annex and tender the said decisions which they"
"seek to quash. Further, the procedure established by the material submitted would be for"
"an engineer whose degree programme is not recognised by the Respondents is to sit for the"

"Petitioners,  the  Petitioners  who  are  qualified  with  an  engineering  degree  are  not  barred"
"from carrying out their engineering duties without being registered by the 1st Respondent."
"Hence, if the Petitioners do not wish to sit for the GQE which allows degree holders whose"
"degree programmes are not recognised by the 1st Respondent, to obtain the 1st Respondent’s"

"without  sitting  for  the  exam.  However,  they  would  not  fall  within  the  definition  of"
"engineers practicing engineering within the meaning of the Act. The Petitioners have failed"
"to impugn the purported decision which they claim directed them to sit for the GQE. Hence,"
"in my view, the main substantive prayers of the Petitioners have to fail. Though the learned"
"President’s Counsel for the 1st -7th Respondents raised many other preliminary objections,"
"in view of my findings above, there is no necessity to consider the said objections."
