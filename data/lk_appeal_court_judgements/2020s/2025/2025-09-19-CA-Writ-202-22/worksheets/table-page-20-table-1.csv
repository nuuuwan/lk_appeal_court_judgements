"expectation among the Petitioners. Let alone it be a legitimate one. Therefore, in my view,"
"such conditional recommendations cannot in any event create a legitimate expectation to"
"the Petitioners."
"I
 have also observed that as stated above in this judgment, the final decision-making body"
"is the 1st Respondent. Hence, they can accept, vary, or disregard the said recommendation."
"Hence, I cannot  subscribe to the Petitioners’  argument that this has  created a legitimate"
"expectation on them for their degree programme to be given IESL recognition. Therefore,"
"in  my  view,  both  limbs  of  the  Petitioner’s  contention  that  frustration  of  the  legitimate"
"expectation is not tenable and has to fail."
"T
his situation is more exacerbated when one reads the Regulations and the manual, both"
"of which were marked and tendered to this Court, as both documents do not contain any"
"provisions which compels the IESL to accept the recommendations of the Evaluation Panel"
"or  the  Education  Committee  as  submitted.  On  a  plain  reading,  it  is  clear  that  the  two"
"Committees are submitting mere recommendations and not decisions."
"F
urther, this Court observes that the Petitioners submitted that the Petitioners belong to 4"
"intakes of the Faculty of Engineering at KDU as pleaded in paragraph 10 of their Petition."
"Respectively in the years of 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. However, it is observed that the"
"Evaluation  Panel’s  recommendation  marked  as  P8  and  also  marked  by  the  1st  to  7th"
"Respondents as R4(a) only make a conditional recommendation pertaining to the 2013 and"
"2014  intakes.  As  per  the  Petition  there  is  no  material  to  demonstrate  that  any  of  the"
"Petitioners belong to the 2013 intake. However, as per paragraph 3 read with paragraph 10"
"of the Petition, only the 28th Petitioner belongs to the 31st intake which is the 2014 batch."
"Hence,  in  any  event,  the  Court  observes  that  the  Petitioners  cannot  succeed  in  their"
"argument on legitimate expectations based on the document P8 as the said document does"
"not consider the intakes to which the Petitioners, other than the 28th Petitioner, belong to."
"Hence, even for arguments sake none of the Petitioners other than the 28th Petitioner can"
"even harbour a legitimate expectation based on P8."
