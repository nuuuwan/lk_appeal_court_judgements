"being recognised as a university by an Act should be recognised as a University under the"
"IESL."
"I
n  advancing  the  said  argument,  the  learned  Counsel  contended  that  KDU  had  sought"
"recognition from the 1st Respondent by the document marked as P6. Hence, by refusing the"
"recognition by P10, the 1st Respondent had acted in violation of the law. Therefore, the said"
"decision is bad in law. I am not in agreement with this contention as the IESL has nothing"
"to do with recognising or not recognising the institution as a university. As quite correctly"
"submitted by the 1st to 7th Respondents counsel the IESL recognition is given to degree"
"programmes of a University and the IESL is not engaged in recognising or non-recognising"
"universities."
"I
t was the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that by P3a, the UGC has"
"recognised  the  degree  afforded  by  the  KDU.  The  letter  dated  24.05.2010  and  the  reply"
"dated 12.06.2010 marked as P3a was brought to the attention of this Court. Hence, based"
"on these two documents it was argued that the UGC had recognised the degree programmes"
"which are more fully stated in the letter dated 24.05.2010 which is addressed to the UGC"
"by the Vice Chancellor of the KDU. In view of these letters the Petitioners contended that"
"when a degree programme is recognised by the UGC, the 1st Respondent cannot refuse to"
"recognise the said degree programme (P10). As stated earlier, this Court observes that the"
"1st Respondent, as per Act No. 04 of 2017 has the power to register and recognise certain"
"degree  programmes.  The  degree  programmes  awarded  by  all  universities  are  not"
"automatically recognised by the 1st Respondent. The by-laws of the 1st Respondent and the"
"manual marked P5 specifies the procedure to recognise an engineering degree. Knowing"
"this, the 8th Respondent had made the application to recognise the degree and willingly on"
"the payment  of money had  subjected its degree programmes for  the evaluation process,"
"which was carried out and resulted in P10, where the IESL for the reasons stated therein"
"refused to recognise the degree programme."
"A
s stated above in this judgement and in view of what I have stated above I am not inclined"
"to accept the argument that if an engineering degree programme is accepted by the UGC it"
"would and should be accepted by the IESL without any evaluations. I would further observe"
"that  this  position  had  not  been  advanced  even  by  the  8th  Respondent  who  conducts  the"
"degree programme and who sought recognition for its degree programmes from the IESL."
