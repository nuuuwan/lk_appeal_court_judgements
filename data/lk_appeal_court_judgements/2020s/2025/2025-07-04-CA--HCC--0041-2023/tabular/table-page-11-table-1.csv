"and  to  eliminate  any  doubt  about  the  way  the  Deceased  was  shot.  To  elaborate  further,"

"shooting incident took place that ultimately resulted in the death of the Deceased it cannot"
"be  sensibly  argued  that  PW3’s  narrative  is  not  required  to  unfold  the  truthfulness  of"
"prosecution’s version of events."
"53. Furthermore, the fact that PW3 was listed as a witness leads to the reasonable assumption"
"that his statement has been evaluated by the prosecution, and deemed to be of value to the"

"presumption set forth in Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance to the non-production"
"of  PW3’s  evidence  at  the  trial  which  is  to  the  following  effect:  ""That  evidence  which"
"could  be  and  is  not  produced  would  if  produced,  be  unfavorable  to  the  person  who"
"withholds it."""
