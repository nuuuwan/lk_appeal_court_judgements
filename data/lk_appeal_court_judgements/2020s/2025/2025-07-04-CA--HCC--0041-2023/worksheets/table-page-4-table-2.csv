"6. The grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant are as follows:"
"(a)  Due  to  his  failure  to  evaluate  the  credibility  of  the  prosecution  witnesses  using  the"
"accepted tests  of consistency, probability and spontaneity the learned trial  judge has"
"failed to conclude that the case of the prosecution has failed;"
"(b) The  learned  trial  judge  has  failed  to  evaluate  the  role  that  the  eye  witness  PW3â€™  s"
"testimony would have played had he been called a witness, and has failed to draw an"
"adverse inference against the prosecution for their failure to call PW3;"
"(c)  The  learned  trial  judge  has  failed  to  identify  that  a  fair  investigation  had  not  been"
"conducted, as the statements of the witnesses at the scene have not been recorded;"
