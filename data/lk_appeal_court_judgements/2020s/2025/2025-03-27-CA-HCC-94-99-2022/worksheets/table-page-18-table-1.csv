"the  van.  We  note  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  acquitted  the  14th"
"Accused on the basis that he only drove the vehicle. According to PW6, there were"
"more than 30 people at the scene and all were firing at the van. Only based on this"
"evidence, I have disbelieved PW6."
"Without analysing the evidence, the Learned High Court Judge has formed the"
"opinion that the Accused were members of the unlawful assembly and acquitted"
"the 14th Accused as he was just a driver. But he transported all these Accused who"
"were armed."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  there  is  no  iota  of  evidence  to  establish  that  the  2nd,  4th,"
"5th,9th,  12  and  13th  along  with  the  deceased  1st  Accused  were  members  of  the"
"unlawful  assembly  with  the  object  to  commit  the  murders  indicated  in  the"
"indictment. We are also mindful that the said indictment did not speak about the"
"persons who were unknown to the Prosecution."
"In this context, I reproduce a relevant excerpt on this particular point from the"
"judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judge."
