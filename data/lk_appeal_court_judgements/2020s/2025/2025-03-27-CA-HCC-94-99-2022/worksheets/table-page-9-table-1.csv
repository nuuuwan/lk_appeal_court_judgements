"PW1 has stated in the examination in chief that he saw the 1st Accused and two"
"others. In cross-examination, he stated that he saw the 9th Accused carrying a gun."
"He further stated that the van belonged to the 2nd Accused. At the re-examination,"
"he mentioned the 2nd Accusedâ€™s name. We are mindful that all the people involved"
"in  this  case  were  living  in  the  same  area  and  there  was  a  case  pending.  The"
"question then is why PW1 has not identified the two people who come with the 1st"
"Accused. We hold that he is not consistent with his evidence. According to him,"
"only 3 people came and shot."
"In contrast to him, PW2 who was seated in the front row of the van has stated that"
"the 4th Accused got down and shot the passengers in the van. He firmly stated that"
"he  only  saw  the  4th  Accused  shooting  during  the  whole  time.  But,  when  giving"
"evidence to the Judicial Medical Officer, he stated that an unknown person came"
"and shot."
"We note that later PW2 had changed the story saying that  he identified the 4th"
"Accused. We note that PW2 is not a credible witness as he had not mentioned the"
"4th Accused in the first instance. The delay in mentioning the 4th Accused is tainted"
"with the opportunity for fabrication."
"According to PW3, she had identified that there were a few people shooting but"
"identified only the 1st Accused with a weapon and the 9th Accused. She thereafter"
"stated that she also saw the 5th 10th, 12th, and 13th Accused after the shooting from"
"the back. At the cross-examination, she admitted that less than 5 people came and"
"shot. However, we observe that she did not mention in evidence that the person"
