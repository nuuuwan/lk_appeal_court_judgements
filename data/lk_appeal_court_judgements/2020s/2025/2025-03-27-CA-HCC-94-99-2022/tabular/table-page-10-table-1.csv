"who was seated behind her was dead. The question is whether she was actually"
"inside the van. There is a doubt created from her evidence."
"When we consider PW6, she stated that the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th 12th, and 13th"
"Accused got down from the van and started to fire at the van. Further, she stated"
"that  the  14th  Accused  drove  the  van  in  which  the  said  Accused  came.  She  also"
"stated that there were around 15 people in the van. During the cross-examination,"
"she  stated  that  there  were  around  30  people  at  the  scene.  This  contradicts  the"
"evidence given by PW1, PW2 and PW3. If we were to believe the PW6’s story, that"
"the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th 12th, and 13th Accused were armed, there should be"
"more cartridges from different weapons found at the crime scene. Therefore, it is"
"noticed that if the story of PW6 is to be believed, the evidence of PW1, PW2, and"
"PW3  become  contradictory.  Their  evidence  is  inconsistent  with  the  number  of"
"people involved. This contradiction goes to the root of the case and it is sufficient"
"to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case."
"We  are  mindful  that  the  prosecution  has  only  indicted  15  accused  and  not"
"mentioned about unknown people. Although PW6 identified only several Accused,"
"she mentioned that more people were around the place of the incident. We are also"
"mindful that, the Learned High Court Judge had acquitted the 3rd, 7th, 8th, 14th,"
"and 15th Accused."
"When  we  consider  all  three  witnesses  namely  PW1,  PW2,  and  PW3  who  were"
"inside  the  van,  especially  PW1  and  PW2,  they  materially  contradict  each  other"
