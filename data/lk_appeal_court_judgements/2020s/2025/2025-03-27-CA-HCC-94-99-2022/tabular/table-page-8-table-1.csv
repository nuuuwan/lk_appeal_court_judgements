"PW3,  whose evidence  was led  under  Section 33  of the  Evidence  Ordinance,  has"
"stated in the non-summary inquiry that, she was seated in the 3rd row of the van"
"and saw the 1st Accused approached the van and started shooting towards the van."
"She  stated  that  she  also  saw  the  9th  Accused  namely  Namal  in  the  scene."
"Thereafter,  she  has  seen  some  other  unknown  people  with  them.  She  further"
"stated that she also saw the 5th, 10th, 12th, and 13th Accused at the crime scene. We"
"note that she had not stated in her evidence that the person who was seated behind"
"her was dead."
"However, PW6 tells a different story who was a bystander. According to her, a van"
"stopped near ‘Deepa Niwasa’ and the 1st Accused got down from the vehicle and"
"threatened to kill her. Thereafter, she hid herself near the wadiya with a child and"
"saw the incident from there. According to her, the 1st Accused had a gun and saw"
"3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, 12th, and 13th Accused were also armed and they were shooting"
"at the van. Further, according to her, the 14th Accused drove the vehicle in which"
"all the Accused came. She observed that there were about 30 people and among"
"them,  she  identified  only  15  people.  We  are  mindful  that  the  Police  had  only"
"recovered two types of cartridges from the scene."
"According to PW15, when he arrived at the crime scene, he recovered 19 T-56 shell"
"casings and a red 12-boro shell. If PW6’s evidence is to be believed that all fired at"
"the van, the Police should have collected more and different cartridges from the"
"place of the crime."
"Now  we  analyse  each  piece  of  evidence  separately,  to  see  whether  they  are"
"consistent."
