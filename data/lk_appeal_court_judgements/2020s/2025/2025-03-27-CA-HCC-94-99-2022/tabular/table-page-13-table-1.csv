"“All persons who convene or who take part in the proceedings of an unlawful"
"assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part in an unlawful assembly."
"Persons present by accident or from curiosity alone without taking any part"
"in the proceedings are not guilty of that offence, even though those persons"
"possess  the  power  of  stopping  the  assembly  and  fail  to  exercise  it.  Mere"
"presence  in  an  assembly  does  not  make  such  a  person  a  member  of  an"
"unlawful  assembly  unless  it  is  shown  that  he  had  done  something  or"
"omitted to do something which would make him a member of an unlawful"
"assembly,  or  unless  the  case  falls  under  Sec.  142,  I.P.C.  It  would  appear"
"that  the  place  of  occurrence  is  surrounded  on  all  sides  by  the  houses  of"
"appellants. If members of the family of the appellants and other residents"
"of the village assembled, all such persons could not be condemned ipso facto"
"as  being  members  of  that  unlawful  assembly.  It  would  be  necessary,"
"therefore,  for  the  prosecution  to  lead  evidence  pointing  to  the  conclusion"
"that  all  the  appellants  had  done  or  been  committing  some  overt  act  in"
"prosecution  of  the  common  object  of  the  unlawful  assembly.  Where  the"
"evidence as recorded is in general terms to the effect that all these persons"
"and many more were the miscreants and were armed with deadly weapons,"
"like guns, spears, pharsas, axes, lathis, etc. this kind of omnibus evidence"
"has to be very closely scrutinized in order to eliminate all chances of false"
"or mistaken implication. Simply because certain members are present in a"
"crowd at the time of a riot by the certain members of their community, it"
"cannot be said that they also, who used no violence, were guilty of the riot.”"
