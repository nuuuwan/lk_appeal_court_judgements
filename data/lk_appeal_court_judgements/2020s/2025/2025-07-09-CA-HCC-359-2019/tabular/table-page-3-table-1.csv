"a discussion that lasted approximately an hour and a half. During this meeting, the informant reiterated"
"that  the  accused  was  transporting  heroin  by  motorcycle  from  Delgoda  to  Sedawatta  Thudugala."
"Following this, PW1 contacted the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) via phone and dispatched two officers—"
"PC 77008 Balagolla and PC 83860 Nuwan—to the Sedawatta area on motorcycles."
"Acting  on  PW1’s  instructions,  the  officers  proceeded  to  the  Thudugala  Road  turn-off  and  took  up"
"strategic  surveillance  positions.  They  were  directed  to  alert  PW1  should  the  red  Pulsar  motorcycle"
"bearing number BDQ-0800 be seen approaching from any direction. Meanwhile, PW1, accompanied"
"by officers PS 8507 Pushpakumara and PC 81716 Samantha, stationed themselves in a three-wheeler"

"to the area on a motorcycle bearing number BDQ-0800, wearing a full-face helmet. Abeywickrama and"
"another officer came from behind the motorcycle and the three-wheeler where PW1 was inside, passed"

"Accordingly, PW1 and the other officers stopped the motorcycle. PW1 introduced himself as an officer"
"from the Organized Crime Prevention Division and switched off the motorcycle and took it into custody."
