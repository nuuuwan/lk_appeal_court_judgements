"In  view  of  the  above,  the  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  PSC  has  approved  the"
"Scheme of Recruitment as published in Gazette P3/1R2, and the publication of the"
"Gazette Notification P3/1R2 is well within the applicable law."
"P
etitionersâ€™  Allegation  that  the  Development  Officer  will  not  be  able  to  Function"
"Efficiently in the Post due to their Lack of Scientific and Technological Knowledge"
"The Petitioners state that, as the Development Officers are not science Graduates,"
"they lack scientific and technological knowledge and cannot function efficiently in"
"the post of Assistant Director Grade III. As per the impugned Gazette Notification"
"P3/1R2,  Development  Officers  are  eligible  to  apply  for  the 
limited  competitive"
"examination  held  for  the  recruitment  for  the  post  of  Assistant  Director  (Fisheries"
"and  Aquatic  Resources).  The  Scheme  of  Recruitment  (1R1)  provides  that  the"
"degree  from  a  University  recognized  by  the  University  Grants  Commission  is  a"
"required  educational  qualification  for  a  candidate  to  be  eligible  to  apply  for  the"
"post  of  Assistant  Director 
(Fisheries 
and  Aquatic  Resources). 
The  Gazette"
"Notification P3/1R2 does not specify that holding a Bachelor of Science Degree is a"
"requirement to be eligible to apply for the aforesaid post. Further, in terms of the"
"Scheme  of Recruitment  (1R1),  for  a  person  to  be  recruited  for  the  above  post  of"
"Assistant Director (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources), such persons are required to"
"sit for three papers, namely, the Fisheries Act and Regulations, Office Systems and"
"Financial Regulations."
"The decision as to the educational qualifications required for an individual to hold a"
"particular  office 
is  entirely  a  decision  that  should  be  made  by  the  Appointing"
"Authority, in this case, the PSC. I am of the view that this Court cannot strike down"
"a decision merely because it feels another policy decision would have been fairer,"
"wiser or more scientific or logical. The Court is not expected to express its opinion"
"as  to  whether,  at  a  particular  point  of  time  or  in  a  particular  situation,  any  such"
"decision  should  have  been  adopted  or  not,  unless  such  policy 
is  found  to  be"
"manifestly  unreasonable  or 
irrational. 
It 
is  best 
left  to  the  discretion  of  the"
"authority  concerned.  Thus,  such  policy  consideration  should  be  arrived  at  by  the"
"PSC."
