"In Free Lanka Trading Co Ltd vs. W L P De Mel and Commissioner of Labour"
"(1978) 79 (II) NLR 161, in which quotation by Lord Denning distinct an ‘employee’"
"with an ‘Independent Contractor’ was quoted as follows:"
"“Under a contract of service, a man was employed as a part of the business, and"
"his work is done as an integral part of the business; whereas under a contract for"
"service, his work, although done for the business is not integral into but is only an"
"accessory to it”."
"In  terms  of  the  above  quotation,  if  the  service  is  considered  relevant  to  the"
"integral part of the business, he is considered to be a ‘servant’ of the employer,"
"whereas if the services rendered are not considered as integral, he is considered"
"to be an ‘Independent Contractor’."
"In the landmark case of Montral Locomotive Works and AG for Canada (1947)"
"7 DLR 161, followed by Perera vs. Marikkar Bawa (1989) 1 SLR 347, it was"
"decided  that  the  ‘Four-Fold  Test’  should  be  applied  in  deciding  whether  the"
"master-servant relationship exists between the employer and employee, which"
"includes the tests as follows: i. Control test; (ii) Integration Test; (iii) Economic"
"reality test; (iv) Multiple test."
"To  find  out  as  to  what  kind  of  relationship  existed  between  the  Petitioner"
"Company and the 4th Respondent, the said tests need to be applied and followed."
"One  important  element  in  a  contract  of  services  is  the  payment  of  wages  or"
"other remuneration between the parties."
