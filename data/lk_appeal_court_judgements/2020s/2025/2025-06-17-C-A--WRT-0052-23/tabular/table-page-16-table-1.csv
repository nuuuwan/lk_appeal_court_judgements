"and 
administrative 
support 
staff 
required 
to 
carry 
out 
the"
"assignments entrusted to the Petitioner."
"8.  Specifically,  paragraph  12  of  Section  E  stipulates  that  the  consultancy"
"services to be provided shall include the engagement of various categories"
"of domestic and support staff, which are listed in an accompanying table."
"Under Section 3 of this table, titled “Technical Staff”, it is explicitly"
"stated that the Petitioner must engage Technical Officers as part of"
"its obligations."
"9.  It  was 
furtherance  of  these  express  contractual  obligations  that  the"
"Petitioner recruited the 4th Respondent as a Technical Officer. Thus, this"
"recruitment  was  not 
incidental  or  ancillary,  but  was  a  direct"
"requitement arising from the Petitioner’s obligations under X3."
"10. Accordingly,  the  4th  respondent,  along  with  other  personnel  similarly"
"recruited,  was 
essential 
to 
the  Petitioner’s  ability 
to  perform 
its"
"contractual obligations and to generate revenue therefrom. Absent such"
"personnel,  the  Petitioner  would  have  had  no  means  of  discharging  it"
"contractual duties."
"11. In  simple  terms,  the  Petitioner  was  compelled  to  hire  such  as  4th"
"Respondent to carry out the services it had contracted to perform and"
"to earn a profit. As such, the 4th Respondent was an integral component"
"of the Petitioner’s operations and business model, and must therefore be"
"regarded as an employee of the Petitioner."
