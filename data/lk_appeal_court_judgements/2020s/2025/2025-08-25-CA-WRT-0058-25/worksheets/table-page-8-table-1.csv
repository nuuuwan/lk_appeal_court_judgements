"and was serving at the Divisional Secretariat of Kinniya. The argument"
"of impossibility advanced by Mr. Weragoda is on the premise that Mr."
"Krishnendran could not have signed a certificate in May 2000. This is"
"misconceived. Though registered in 14.05.2000, the copy P-6 has been"
"issued subsequently in 2007, at which point of time Mr. Krishnendran"
"had been holding office and he could have thus signed the copy P-6."
"Hence there is no impossibility. The petitioner has not submitted any"
"letter or document from Mr. Krishnendran denying his signature either."
"Accordingly, the argument advanced and the position taken up by the"
"petitioner is misconceived and erroneous to that extent. The issue was"
"also  raised  that  the  original  certificate  of  P-6  had  been  registered  on"
"14.05.2000,  which  happens  to  be  a  Sunday.  What  is  relevant  and"
"important to this application is not the date of first registration but the"
"validity of the copy of the business names registration (P-6) as certified"
"and  issued  in  2007.  To  that  extent,  the  acceptance  of  P-6  and  the"
"rejection  of  this  appeal  by  R-7  and  awarding  of  the  tender  to  the  9th"
"respondent cannot be found fault with."
