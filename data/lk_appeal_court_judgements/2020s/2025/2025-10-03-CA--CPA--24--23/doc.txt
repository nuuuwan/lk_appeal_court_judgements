D. Thotawatte, J.

The present revision application arises out of a dispute concerning the enforcement of aloan obtained by the Petitioner–Respondent, Undugodage Chamila Kumarai, (hereinaftersometimes referred to as the “Applicant” for reasons of clarity), from the 1st

Respondent–Petitioner, Gampaha District Co-operative Rural Bank Union Limited(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “1st Respondent–Petitioner”).

On 3rd December 2015, the Applicant had borrowed a sum of Rs. 3,500,000/- from the 1st

Respondent–Petitioner on a reducing balance scheme, subject to 12% annual interest. Ascollateral, the Applicant’s residential house and the property belonging to her husbandwere pledged under a mortgage deed to the 1st Respondent–Petitioner. It is stated thatat the time of obtaining the said facility, the Applicant’s husband was employed in Italy asa chef and was the family’s sole source of income.

The initial loan installments were serviced through foreign remittances sent by theApplicant’s husband. However, consequent to a fire at the hotel where he was employed,the Applicant’s husband is said to have sustained injuries which caused the loss of hisemployment. As a result, the repayment of the loan fell into default after the payment ofeight installments.

Consequent to default, the 1st Respondent–Petitioner, in order to recover the money,resorted to the arbitration mechanism under the Western Province Co-operativeSocieties Statute No. 03 of 1998. The Arbitrator had, after inquiry, on 16th November2018, awarded a sum of Rs. 3,694,473.52 (which had accrued to Rs. 3,801,049.07 withinterest by 12-02-2019) against the Applicant. Consequent to the award, the Applicanthas requested from the 1st Respondent–Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent, theCommissioner of Co-operative Development - Western Province (hereinafter sometimesreferred to as the “2nd Respondent”), to be allowed to settle the debt in 38 monthlyinstallments, stating her that her husband had recovered (the 11th averment in theaffidavit of the Applicant submitted to the High Court) and as such indicating that theywill be able make payments if the relevant concession is granted. However, according tothe Applicant, the Respondents (of the High Court application) had refused suchaccommodation and initiated recovery proceedings to auction her matrimonial home.

The Applicant had filed Writ Application No. 13/2019 dated 25th November 2019 in theProvincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Gampaha, seeking relief by way

4

of certiorari and mandamus. The Applicant has challenged the “legality” of theRespondents’ refusal to allow installment payments and the decision to proceed with theauction.

The High Court, upon hearing, ultimately delivered judgment on 29th September 2022,issuing a writ of certiorari quashing the intended auction. The 1st Respondent–Petitioner,dissatisfied with the order of the High Court, has filed this instant application seeking torevise or set aside the Judgment dated 29-09-2022 of the Provincial High Court ofGampaha.

It should be noted that the Applicant has never disputed the fact that she owed moneyto the 1st Respondent-Petitioner or the arbitral award. The Applicant’s contention is thatSection 66(1) of the Co-operative Societies Statute No. 03 of 1998 (Western ProvinceProvincial Council) gives the Respondents discretion to allow the Applicant to pay theamount owed in installments and the failure of the Respondents to allow this in spite ofrepeated requests by her amount to a violation of Section 66(1) and a breach of naturaljustice.

Section 66(1) of the Western Province Co-operative Societies Statute No. 03 of 1998 doesnot empower either the Gampaha District Co-operative Rural Bank or the Commissionerof Co-operative Development to grant relief by installments in lieu of auction. Its purposeis only to channel disputes into arbitration or the Registrar’s decision-making. ThePetitioner Respondent’s reliance on Section 66(1) for installment relief is misconceived inlaw.

The Prayer appearing in the Applicant’s petition to the High Court in the writ applicationdrafted in Sinhala is somewhat unusual; as such, I have attempted to translate it intoEnglish as closely as possible.

The Respondent had filed the Writ application in the High Court seeking the followingreliefs;

a) Issue notices on the Respondents (of the High Court writ application)b) To issue a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision taken by

documents P4 and P4a against the 3rd Respondent (of the High Court writapplication) in order to prevent the damage that would be caused to her, if her

5

property worth Rs. 11900000 was sold to recover Rs. 3800000 as a single lump-sum settlement.c) To issue a writ in the nature of mandamus ordering the Respondents (of the High

Court writ application) to enter upon a justifiable procedure of allowing her to paythe Rs. 3800000 in 38 monthly installments.d) To grant a stay order against the 3rd Respondent, temporarily preventing the sale

of the relevant property.e) Costf) Any other relief that the court is inclined to grant.

The Document marked ‘P4a’ is a letter, which appears to be dated 08.02.2019 (the datebeing partly illegible), addressed to the Applicant, wherein she is informed that, havingfailed to discharge the arbitration award in the sum of Rs. 3,694,473.52, which togetherwith accrued interest is at Rs. 3,801,049.07, the matter would be referred to the 2nd or 3rd

Respondents (of the High Court writ application) for the purpose of obtaining a decreefrom the District Court to auction the relevant property and recover the said sum,together with default interest at the rate of 14% and costs of court.

The document marked ‘P4’ is a letter dated 07.11.2019, issued on the letterhead of theGampaha District Co-operative Rural Bank Union Limited, under the signature of its ChiefExecutive Officer, addressed to the Applicant, stating that the Board of Directors of the 1st

Respondent–Petitioner has declined to grant the relief sought by her, on the basis thatlegal proceedings have already been instituted.

When the aforesaid two letters are considered together, the Applicant should have beenleft in no doubt as to the fact that recovery proceedings had been instituted in theDistrict Court. However, it is significant that the Applicant has failed to disclose in herpetition to the High Court at least the fact that she had been informed (by letter markedP4) that legal proceedings had already been commenced. Moreover, as at 25th November2019, when the Applicant filed the writ application in the High Court of Gampaha,proceedings in District Court Case No. 5176/Spl. had already been concluded, and on 11th

November 2019, a decree had been entered in favour of the 1st Respondent-Petitioner toauction the relevant property and recover the monies due (the petition and affidavit filingthe award in the District Court, and the decree entered has been filed with the instantpetition).

6

It is abundantly clear that the Applicant has deliberately suppressed material facts, and assuch, the application should have been dismissed in limine. However, even after this factwas brought to the notice of the learned High Court Judge, she has disregarded this facton the grounds that there was no proof that the Applicant knew about the district courtenforcement case and had proceeded to grant a writ of certiorari quashing the decisionto auction the property as per prayer (b).

By prayer (b), what has been prayed for is a writ of certiorari to quash the decision takenby documents P4 and P4a.

The “decision” contained in P4 is only that the 1st Respondent-Petitioner is unable toaccede to the request of the Applicant.

The “decision” contained in P4a is that the 1st Respondent-Petitioner has resolved torecover the monies due through legal proceedings.

In circumstances where the legal proceedings envisaged in document P4a have alreadybeen instituted before a competent Court, duly proceeded with, and brought to aconclusion by the issuance of a legally binding decree, the quashing of a decision tocommence such proceedings for the recovery of monies by auction of the mortgagedproperty would serve no practical purpose. Since the decree of the District Courtcontinues to remain operative, the issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash the said initialdecision, as sought by prayer (b), is rendered futile.

The basis stated by the learned High Court Judge for the issuance of a writ of certiorari isthat no justice would be done with regard to the auctioning of the property and recoveryof the money without the intervention of the court. In an application for Judicial review,the Court can interfere where there is a manifest unreasonableness in an administrativeact. The test is whether the administrative authority has acted within the rules of reasonand justice1. The court should only consider whether the decision is lawful or unlawful.2

The learned High Court Judge had not come to any finding that the Respondents actedwithout jurisdiction, in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or in breach of naturaljustice.

For the reasons stated above, this Court allow the application in revision and sets asidethe order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 29-09-2022.
