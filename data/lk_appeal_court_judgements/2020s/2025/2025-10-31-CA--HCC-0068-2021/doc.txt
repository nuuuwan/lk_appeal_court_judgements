Judgment

1. This is an appeal by the accused–appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the Appellant”)

against the judgment dated 29.03.2012 delivered by the learned High Court Judge of

Badulla. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the learned Deputy Solicitor

General (DSG) appearing for the State raised a preliminary objection as to the

maintainability of the appeal, on the ground that the petition of appeal had been

lodged on 23.09.2021, almost nine years after the delivery of the judgment.

Background to the appeal:

2. The Appellant was indicted before the High Court of Badulla for committing the

murder of W. M. Lalani Renuka on or about 14.05.2002. On 25.11.2005, the

indictment was served on the Appellant, and upon it being read out, he pleaded not

guilty to the charge. At the request of the Appellant, the trial was initially fixed to be

heard without a jury before the High Court Judge.

3. However, on 11.07.2006, an application was made by the Appellant to have the case

tried before a jury, which application was allowed by the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the trial was fixed for 05.02.2007. On that date, however, the trial was

postponed as the learned High Court Judge was on leave.

4. The trial was rescheduled for 25.06.2007 but was postponed again due to the absence

of the witnesses. The case was thereafter postponed on several occasions for various

reasons, and finally, the trial was rescheduled for 12.02.2009.

5. However, on that date, the accused was not present, and accordingly, the Court issued

a warrant for his arrest. Thereafter, the Appellant failed to appear before the Court,

and after the necessary steps were taken under section 241 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, the Appellant was tried in absentia. At the conclusion of the

prosecution’s case, the learned Trial Judge convicted the Appellant and sentenced him

to death.

6. Thereafter, an open warrant was issued as the Appellant continued to abscond. The

Appellant never surrendered to the Court. He was later arrested by the police and

produced before the Magistrate of Bandarawela, and subsequently produced before

the High Court of Badulla on 09th September 2021. On that date, the learned High

Court Judge read out the judgment to the Appellant, who was not represented by an

Attorney-at-Law on that day.

7. It is section 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which sets out the appeal

procedure.

Section 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and section reads as

follows:

331 (1) An appeal under this Chapter may be lodged by presenting a petition

of appeal, or application for leave to appeal to the Registrar of the High Court

within fourteen days from the date when the conviction, sentence or order

sought to be appealed against was pronounced: Provided that a person in

prison may lodge an appeal by stating within the time aforesaid to the jailer of

the prison in which he is for the time being confined his desire to appeal and

the grounds therefore and it shall thereupon be the duty of such jailer to

prepare a petition of appeal and lodge it with the High Court where the

conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced.

(2) In computing the time within which an appeal may be preferred, the day on

which the judgment or final order appealed against was pronounced shall be

included, but all public holidays shall be excluded. In terms of the above

provisions, the petition of appeal has to be lodged with the Registrar of the

High Court within fourteen days from the date when the conviction, sentence

or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced.

8. In terms of the above provisions, the petition of appeal has to be lodged with the

Registrar of the High Court within fourteen days from the date when the conviction,

sentence or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced. The following

authorities are of particular relevance to the manner in which the appeal period is

calculated.

9. In the case of Haramanis Appuhamy vs Inspector of Police, Bandaragama, 66 NLR

526, Sri Skandarajah J. held that

“where an accused is convicted and sentenced, the time within which an

appeal should be preferred must be computed from the date on which the

reasons for the decisions are given and not from the date of conviction and

sentence.”

10. In the case of Solicitor General vs Nadarajah Muthurajah 79 NLR 63 following the

above case, Pathirana J. held that

“the period of the time within which an appeal should be referred must be

calculated from the date on which the reasons of the decisions are given and

not from the date of which the verdict was entered.

11. In the case of Rajapakse vs The State [2001]2 Sri LR161, Kulathilake J. followed the

above decisions and held that:

“the period of time within which an appeal should be preferred must be

calculated from the date on which the reasons for the decision are given.”

12. In the present appeal, it is clear that the appeal was filed out of time and therefore

cannot be entertained. Nevertheless, in the interest of justice, the Court may exercise

its revisionary jurisdiction when the circumstances so warrant. The Court would

invoke this extraordinary power, vested in it under the law, particularly to prevent a

miscarriage of justice or to ensure the due administration of justice. For such

intervention, the Appellant must generally have no other avenue of appeal or relief.

However, even where another remedy is available, revision may still be considered if

special circumstances are established.

13. In the present case, the Appellant was well aware of the case pending before the High

Court of Badulla. When the indictment was served on him, the Court assigned counsel

CA/HCC/0068/2021

5 | P a g e

to represent him. Therefore, the right to be represented by an Attorney-at-Law, as

guaranteed by the Constitution, was duly accorded to the Appellant.

14. Nevertheless, he deliberately absconded and did not even take steps, through his

sureties, to inform the Court of any reason that prevented his appearance. Therefore, it

is difficult, if not impossible, to infer that the Appellant had any genuine reason for

absconding.

15. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that even if this Court were to hold

that the petition of appeal was out of time, it would not preclude the Appellant from

inviting this Court to exercise its inherent revisionary powers in terms of section 364

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It was further submitted that the revisionary

powers of the Court of Appeal are sufficiently wide to encompass cases where a right

of appeal was not exercised.

16. If this Court is to exercise its revisionary powers, it must first be satisfied that there

exist exceptional circumstances which shock the conscience of the Court and that a

grave miscarriage of justice would otherwise be caused to the Appellant. Moreover,

the Appellant must come before the Court with clean hands. The following judgments

are of much relevance to the present appeal.

17. In the Case of Rajapakse v. The State (2001) 2 Sri LR 161, it was held that,

" ... When considering this issue this Court must necessarily have regard to the

contumacious conduct of the accused in jumping bail and thereafter conducted

himself in such a manner to circumvent and subvert the process of the law and

judicial institutions. In addition if this Court were to act in revision the party

must come before Court without unreasonable delay. In the instant case there

is a delay of 13 months ... "

18. In the case of Seylan Bank V. Thangaveil (2004) 2 Sri L.R. 101, it was held that:

"Unexplained and unreasonable delay in seeking relief by way of revision,

which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which will disentitle the petitioner

to it. An application for judicial review should be made promptly unless there

are good reasons for the delay. The failure on the part of the petitioner to

explain the delay satisfactorily is by itself fatal to the application.

CA/HCC/0068/2021

19. In the case of Rajapakshe vs State (Supra), Kulathilake J. held as follows: “However

an application in revision should be entertained save in exceptional circumstances..”

20. In the case of Ossen vs Exercise Officer 34 NLR 50, Dolton J. held,

“the Supreme Court will hear a case in revision, if the appellant makes out a

strong case, amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice, in regard to the

law or the judge’s appreciation of facts.”

21. In the case of Attorney General vs Podi Singho,51 NLR 385, Dias J. held that:

“the powers of the Supreme Court are wide enough to embrace a case where an

appeal lay but was not taken in such a case. However, an application of

revision should not entertain save in exceptional circumstances such as there

has been a miscarriage of justice.”

22. These revisionary powers, therefore, will be exercised only in rare and exceptional

circumstances where the Court is satisfied that there exists a reason justifying a

departure from the normal appellate procedure. The discretion of the Court will not be

exercised unless the Appellant provides a full and honest explanation for the non-

compliance. If such explanation satisfies the Court that there was a valid excuse for

the default, and that a grave miscarriage of justice has occurred which shocks the

conscience of the Court, only then will the Court be inclined to exercise its

revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the questions that must be addressed by the Appellate

Court on an application for revision, in place of an appeal, are as follows:

(a) What is the explanation for the default?

(b) Does it provide a good excuse for the default?

(c) Are there any exceptional circumstances which justify the court taking the

exceptional step of exercising its revisionary jurisdiction?

23. It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that mere procedural technicalities should

not be allowed to overshadow the fundamental right of the Appellant to seek justice

and a fair evaluation of his case. It was further submitted that dismissing an appeal on

purely technical grounds could result in grave injustice and undermine public

confidence in the legal system.

CA/HCC/0068/2021

24. However, it is pertinent to emphasize that in the present case, the Appellant was

convicted and sentenced to death on 09.03.2012, whereas the petition of appeal was

filed on 23.09.2021, almost nine years after the judgment. Thus, the appeal is not only

out of time but the delay is inordinate and inexcusable.

25. Furthermore, it is worth noting that at no stage were the fundamental rights of the

Appellant denied or violated, nor was any grave prejudice caused to him during the

trial. When the indictment was served on the Appellant, the Court assigned a counsel

to represent him. Nevertheless, without any plausible reason, the Appellant failed to

appear for the trial and did not provide any instructions to his counsel. Moreover, the

Appellant made no effort to surrender himself to Court and was eventually arrested by

the Police and produced before the High Court, nine years after the date of conviction.

26. The learned High Court Judge has duly taken steps under Section 241 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act and led the evidence of the two sureties of the Appellant

before proceeding to hold the trial in absentia. Hence, I find no illegality or procedural

irregularity in the conduct of the trial before the High Court.

27. Accordingly, I see no exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the

revisionary powers of this Court, especially when the contumacious conduct of the

Appellant is clearly evident. It is true that the Appellant has been sentenced to capital

punishment; however, a careful examination of the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge reveals that there are no irrational or illogical findings therein. The

evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly PW1 and PW9, clearly established

the charge against the Appellant. The nature and extent of the injuries, as explained by

PW9, demonstrate that the act committed by the Appellant falls within the ambit of

Section 294 of the Penal Code.

28. Although PW9 stated that the injuries were not necessarily fatal, his evidence clearly

established that they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,

thereby bringing the act within the ambit of the third limb of Section 294 of the Penal

Code, which reads as follows:

If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the

bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of

nature to cause death;

CA/HCC/0068/2021

8 | P a g e

29. The manner in which the Appellant acted during and after stabbing the deceased,

together with the weapon used, and when considered alongside the number and

severity of the injuries, would certainly satisfy the ingredients of the third limb of

Section 294 of the Penal Code.

30. The learned High Court Judge has also clearly observed that there was no evidence to

infer that the death was caused as a result of sudden and grave provocation, mistake,

or accident on the part of the Appellant. Hence, I find no reason to conclude that the

Appellant could have availed himself of any of the exceptions stipulated in Section

294 of the Penal Code.

31. Another important fact that deserves emphasis is that the alleged incident occurred in

2002, whereas the trial against the Appellant was concluded in 2012. If the present

appeal is permitted to be argued, what message would it convey to society? Can an

Appellant who has been sentenced to death and has deliberately absconded for a long

period be allowed to be heard, completely disregarding the existing legal provisions?

Surely, this could not have been the intention of the Legislature when specific time

limits were set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

32. Another important fact that requires consideration is that the Appellant has failed to

provide any valid reason for his prolonged absence. What prompted him to abscond

for nine years until he was arrested and produced before Court by the Police? Was he

unaware of the case pending against him? The answer to all these questions must

undoubtedly be in the negative.

33. The delay in filing the appeal is not a matter of several days, weeks, or even months,

but several years. In this context, can it reasonably be regarded as a mere technicality

when the appeal is refused on account of such inordinate and inexcusable delay? The

answer is no. It is also significant to note that if such applications are allowed,

especially where the Appellant’s contumacious conduct is evident, it would lead to an

absurdity and a mockery of justice.

34. It is also desirable to emphasize that it was the Appellant’s own conduct that

necessitated the trial being held in absentia. The findings of the learned Trial Judge

are manifestly consistent with the evidence led at the trial. Therefore, it cannot

CA/HCC/0068/2021

9 | P a g e

reasonably be contended that the dismissal of the appeal would, in any manner,

undermine the principles of justice as submitted by the Appellant.

35. For the reasons stated above, I find no merits on the submissions made on behalf of

the Appellant. Accordingly, I uphold the objection raised on behalf of the State and

dismiss the appeal.
