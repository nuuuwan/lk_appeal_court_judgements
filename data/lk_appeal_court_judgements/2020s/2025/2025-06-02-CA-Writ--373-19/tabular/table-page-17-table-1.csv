"I am of the view that the Review Panel has acted within the scope of its mandate. The"
"Petitioner also argues that the decision to issue a charge sheet is in breach of the no-"
"evidence rule, as the Review Panel in its report marked as P34 has stated that there is"
"no clear evidence to find that the Petitioner is guilty of the charges. In the report marked"
"as P34, the Review Panel has stated that even though the evidence before them does"
"not  show  that  the  Petitioner  is  guilty  of  the  charges,  a  mere  plain  reading  of  the"
"statements recorded shows that there is a prima facie case to warrant an inquiry. Hence,"
"the  Review  Panel  has  recommended  holding  a  fresh  inquiry.  The  Petitioner  further"
"argues  that  the  entire case record of the formal  inquiry has been included under the"
"documents  in  the  charge  sheet  marked  as  P39,  while  the  Council  has  accepted  the"
"Review Panel recommendations to set aside those proceedings. Even though the said"
"formal  inquiry  proceedings  have  been  listed  as  a  document  under  the  charge  sheet"
"marked P39, no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner, as the 2nd formal inquiry"
"has been conducted on P39. Under the above stated circumstances, this Court see no"
"merit in the argument of the Petitioner that the charge sheet is illegal and null and void."
"Therefore, this Court refuses to grant relief prayed for in prayer (b) of the Petition."
"In the prayer (e) the Petitioner seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash the determination of"
"the Council if any made in pursuance of the recommendations of the Review Panel, in"
"prayer (g) a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from taking further steps"
"in pursuance of P34 and charge sheet marked P39 and in prayer (h) a Writ of Mandamus"
"directing the Respondents to make a determination according to law based the finding"
