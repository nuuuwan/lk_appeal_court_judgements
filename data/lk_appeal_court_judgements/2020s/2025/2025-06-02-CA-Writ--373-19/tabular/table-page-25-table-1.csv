"Rajakaruna J. observed that,"
"“The  Para  18.7  of  the  said  Chapter  stipulates  that  if  the  person  cannot  be"
"appropriately interdicted in terms of this Section, but it is in the  interest of the"
"investigation or inquiry that he should not exercise the functions of his office, he"
"should  be  transferred,  or  placed  on  compulsory  leave  in  terms  of  Para  14  of"
"Chapter X.”"
"Considering the above facts, it is evident that the Council have the power to place the"
"Petitioner  on  compulsory  leave  in  the  interest  of  the  inquiry  until  they  think  fit."
"Therefore, this Court refuses to grant relief prayed for in prayer (f) as the Council has"
"acted within its power by placing the Petitioner on compulsory leave."
"The Petitioner in  prayer (i) seeks  a  Writ of Mandamus  directing the Respondents  to"
"grant his increments withheld during the period of his compulsory leave in terms of"
"Paragraph 14.3 of Chapter X of the Code. Paragraph 14.3 reads as follows,"
"“Persons who are compelled to keep away from work for reasons beyond their"
"control in terms of sub-paragraph 14.1 above shall be paid their increments for"
"the period they were on compulsory leave.”"
"The Petitioner argues that the 1st Respondent has failed to release his increments during"
"the  period  of  his  compulsory  leave.  Except  for  denying  this  fact  in  the  statement  of"
"objections, the Respondents do not argue on this matter. However, in terms of the letter"
