"“A preliminary Investigation is purely a fact-finding process. It is meant to be"
"search for material that may disclose an employee's guilt or provide evidence"
"for any charges that may be framed against the person suspected of the offence."
"It may involve the recording of statements of witnesses, and a search for and"
"examination of documents. Since this process is not an ""inquiry"", the suspect."
"person or his representative need not be present when statements are recorded."
"In fact it would be inadvisable to allow the suspect person or his representative"
"to  be  present  or  to  disclose  any  material  to  him  at  this  stage.  He  should,"
"however, be present if stores or cash etc. in his charge are verified in connection"
"with an alleged offence, so that he could signify that the verification was done"
"in his presence and the results accepted by him, or when productions have to be"
"sealed  in  his  presence,  or  when  it  is  necessary  to  have  him  identified  by  a"
"witness,  etc.  Preliminary  investigations  should  be  completed  and  the  report"
"furnished with the least possible delay.”"
