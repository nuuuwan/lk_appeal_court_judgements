"T","he plaintiff-respondent took up the following two preliminary objections."
"","1.  If  the  petitioners  were  dissatisfied  with  the  order  dated  13-12-2023,"
"","they  should  have  filed  an  application  for  Leave  to  Appeal  to  the  High"
"","Court  of  Civil  Appeals  held  at  Galle  within  fourteen  days  of  the  said"
"","order, in terms of sections 754 (2) and 757 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"","However, the petitioner has failed to do so."
"","Hence, 
the  petitioners  have  not 
invoked 
the  alternative 
remedy,"
"","namely,  the  Leave  to  Appeal  Application.  They  are  not  entitled  in  law"
"","to  make  an  application  by  way  of  Revision  and/or  Restitutio 
in"
"","Integrum."
"","2.  The  petitioners  have  made 
this  application 
in  Revision  and  /or"
"","Restitutio  in  Integrum  to  this  court  against  an  order  of  the  Learned"
"","District  Judge  dated  13-12-2023,  wherein  the  matter  has  been  fixed"
"","for ex-parte trial.  In Chapter XII of the Civil Procedure Code, sections"
"","86 
(2)  and  86 
(2A)  set  out  alternative  remedies  available 
to 
the"
"","petitioner.    Therefore,  the  petitionersâ€™  application  is  premature  and"
"","ought to be dismissed in limine."
