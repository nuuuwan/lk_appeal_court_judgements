1] The 27th Defendant-Petitioner prays for following reliefs from this Court;

a. Issue notices on the Respondents

b. Revise and set aside and vary the judgement dated 26.4.2017 delivered

and entered by the District Court of Kalutara Case bearing No. 6887/P

f. Issue and interim order staying the proceedings of the District Court of

Kalutara case bearing no.6887/P, until hearing and final determination of

this action

2] This is an action for partition. The dispute concerns ownership of the land

known as “Kelawanthottam” alias “Nakiyawaththa,” which stems from a series

of successive conveyances involving undivided shares. Through various deeds,

Ibrahim Lebbe Marikar Mohamed Samsudeen ultimately acquired a dominant

15/16 undivided share, while Abdul Cassim Marikkar Fathima Umma retained

the remaining 1/16. Upon Samsudeen’s death, his majority share devolved to

his legal heirs his wife (11th Defendant), his son (10th Defendant), and four

daughters (12th, 13th, 14th, and 27th Defendants/Petitioner). These heirs,

18

particularly the 8th to 14th Defendants and the 27th Defendant, form the central

group of litigants, asserting rights derived from their common inheritance.

3] The dispute evolved into a partition action initiated by the Plaintiffs, who

initially allocated 21/24 of the undivided share to “Unknown parties.” As the

case progressed, Samsudeen heirs were impleaded as the 9th through 14th

Defendants, while the 27th Defendant/Petitioner appeared nearly fifteen years

later. A major issue arose regarding the land’s demarcation, with the 8th to 12th

Defendants contesting the accuracy of Preliminary Plan No. 1516 and advocating

for Alternate Plan No. 1132. The Trial Judge’s final judgment on April 26, 2017,

dismissed several deeds relied upon by these Defendants and allocated the

Petitioner an undivided 35/256 share. The Petitioner now contends that the

judgment disregarded her arguments and that her rightful inherited share was

improperly diverted to other parties, forming the core of her current grievance.

4] The Petitioner is seeking the intervention of this Court to invoke its revisional

and/or restitutio in integrum jurisdiction against a judgment and interlocutory

decree, primarily on the grounds that they are contrary to law, evidence, and the

principles of the Partition Act No. 21 of 1977.

5] Key arguments include the learned trial judge's failure to follow proper steps

in Partition Law, errors in evaluating title deeds (10V3, 10V5, 10V6, and 10V7),

misdirection regarding issues raised by one of the Defendants, and failure to

consider the alleged fraudulent nature of the submitted evidence. The Petitioner

asserts that the interlocutory decree and judgment were ab initio null and void,

that serious fraud and procedural errors occurred during the trial, and that the

continued operation of the decree would cause irreparable loss, prejudice, and

eventual eviction from a property occupied for over a century. The application is

presented as one involving exceptional circumstances, serious fraud, and

miscarriage of justice, necessitating the Court's intervention due to the lack of

an alternative remedy.

19

6] The core argument of the Petitioner is that the Learned District Judge

committed "grave errors" and an "ex facie wrong and bad in toto" by failing in the

"solemn and inescapable duty" to "investigate title" thoroughly, as required by

the Partition Act and case law (citing Mother v. Thamotheram Pillai, Richard

v Seibel Nona, Priyanthi v Uma, and others). The petitioner contends that this

failure resulted in an incorrect allocation of shares, particularly by denying the

Petitioner (a sibling of other defendants) her rightful 35/256 share and rejecting

relevant deeds.

7] The Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent raised preliminary objections, primarily

focusing on the Petitioner's culpable and unreasonable delay (laches) in filing the

application for revisionary relief and/or Restitutio in Integrum.

8] The core argument is that the partition action, Case No. 6887/P, which is an

action in rem, has been litigated for over 25 years and its outcome should not be

reversed due to the Petitioner's lack of due diligence. The Petitioner's delay is

deemed "glaring," as the decree was issued on or about 27.04.2018, while the

current application was only filed on or about 21.03.2022, an unexplained delay

of over 4 years.

9] The Respondent meticulously details the Petitioner's alleged awareness of the

proceedings, arguing it is difficult to believe the Petitioner was unaware for 18

years when all her immediate family members and other relatives resided in the

same house and were actively participating. Evidence is presented to show that

the Petitioner's close family members (the 10th-14th Defendants-Respondents)

are her mother, siblings, and other relatives who all reside at "No. 10/4, Saviya

Lane, Mahagoda, Beruwala," which is also the Petitioner's address. Notices of

the action were published through the Grama Niladhari and affixed at a

conspicuous place on the property in 2013. Moreover, the Petitioner was

reportedly named as the 11th Defendant in two Statements of Claim filed by an

Attorney-at-Law representing her relatives in 2001 and 2003, and was also

allegedly notified of a property survey in 2002. The Respondent thus argues that

20

the Petitioner's subsequent claim of unawareness is untrue, asserting that her

failure to participate was "by her own choice and election and not due to any

ignorance."

10] In addition to laches, the Respondent raises several other preliminary

objections, including that the Petitioner is acting dishonestly and/or in collusion

with other parties, is guilty of willful and fraudulent suppression and

misrepresentation of material facts, and has failed to demonstrate any special or

exceptional circumstances warranting the court's discretionary jurisdiction. The

Respondent contends that the Petitioner had access to alternative remedies (like

an appeal) and failed to exercise due diligence. Allowing the relief would be

contrary to law, cause greater prejudice to the Respondent who has participated

for 25 years, and does not redress a substantial prejudice or miscarriage of

justice.

11] Further, 16th Defendant-Respondent asserts that the Petitioner failed to

annex the entire case record (specifically citing the certified copy of the record

being dated 27.04.2018, while the petition is dated 21.05.2022), did not comply

with Rule 3 of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 regarding

Restitutio in Integrum, and is guilty of laches or culpable and unreasonable

delay.

12] The Petitioner counters the objections by asserting that under Rule 3, only

copies of the relevant proceedings and documents (marked as Q1-Q15) are

required, not the entire case record, and that the date of the certified copy should

not preclude the filing. Furthermore, the Petitioner argues they are not guilty of

laches or negligent, claiming the prejudice is due to negligence and mistakes by

the former Attorney-at-Law who mistakenly named the Petitioner as the 11th

Defendant. The Petitioner, who is the party aggrieved by the judgment despite

evidence supporting her claim, subsequently joined the action as the 27th

Defendant.

21

13] We now consider the preliminary objections. The objections revolve around

Laches and Unexplained Delay, Collusion with the 10th and 11th Defendants-

Respondents, Suppression of Material Facts and Abuse of Process, and the

absence of a Prima Facie Case or Threshold Met.

14] It is seen that the Respondents argue the Petitioner is guilty of a five-year

delay from the 2017 Interlocutory Decree to filing the application in 2022, with

a four-year unexplained delay after obtaining the case record in 2018. They

contend such laches is fatal and that the Petitioner, represented by the same

instructing attorney as the 10th and 11th Defendants, filed the application

collusively to assist their grievances after the final scheme inquiry, which the

Petitioner remained silent on until its advanced stage.

15] Furthermore, the Respondents submit that the Petitioner deliberately

suppressed the current status of the Partition Action, annexing only an outdated

2018 case record and failing to disclose subsequent material developments like

the issuance of the commission, the final scheme, and objections thereto. This

non-disclosure renders the petition ambiguous, misleading, and procedurally

defective, preventing the Court from assessing the true context. They pleaded

that the action should be dismissed in limine.

16] The Petitioner relies on Gnanapandithen and Another v. Balanayagam

and Another, [1998] 1 SLR 391. In that case His Lordship G. P S. De Silva. CJ.

Held that judgement could be vacated if there was no investigation of title where

circumstances show the judgement was obtained by collusive action. His

Lordship notes;

“1. There was a total want of investigation of title. The circumstances were

strongly indicative of a collusive action. In the result, there was a

miscarriage of justice in the case, and the appellants were entitled to a

22

revision of the judgment of the District Judge notwithstanding delay in

seeking relief.

2. The question whether delay is fatal to an application in revision depends

on the facts and circumstances of the case. Having regard to the very special

and exceptional circumstances of the case the appellants were entitled to

the exercise of the revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal.”

17] Further, in Mather vs. Thamotheram Pillai 6 NLR 246, LAYARD, C.J. had

the similar view as;

“In partition proceedings the paramount duty is cast by the Ordinance upon

the District Judge himself to ascertain who are the actual owners of the land.

As collusion between the parties is always possible, and as they get their

title from the decree of the Court, which is made. good and conclusive as

against the world, no loopholes should be allowed for avoiding the

performance of the duty so cast upon the Judge”

18] Moreover, in RICHARD AND ANOTHER v. SEIBEL NONA AND OTHERS,

[2001] 2 SLR -1, His Lordship Jayawickrema J., considered the decree held on

settlement;

“Court has completely acted in violation of the provisions of the Partition Law

and has accepted by way of a settlement, the evidence of the 1st Defendant,

without investigating into the title of all the parties as required by the

Partition Law. A partition decree cannot be entered by settlement; it is the

duty of the Judge to fully investigate into the title to the land and shares.”

19] On careful perusal, it is seen that original partition action was filed on

17.08.1998. Q7 document shows that the Petitioner had filed her statement of

claim along with 8 to 12 Defendants, the Petitioner as the 11th Defendant on

23

25.04.2001. Amended statement claim was filed on 12.03.2003 by the same

Defendants (Vide Q7 (i)). In that, the 11th Defendant, that is the Petitioner’s share

was mentioned in paragraph 11 as 35/256. Q 11 shows when the issues were

raised the above Defendants, including the Petitioner were represented by Mr.

Anaz, AAL on the instruction of Mr. Dharmasena Fernando on 10.05.2005 and

issues Nos 16 to 26 were raised on behalf of them. 06.05.2011, the Plaintiff’s

case was closed and Mr. Anaz moved a date to call the defence case for the 8 to

14th Defendants, including the Petitioner, which was the 11th Defendant. After a

full contested trial, interlocutory judgment was entered by the Learned District

Judge of Kalutara on 26.04.2017. In that, 11th Defendant was allotted divided

share 18/144. Interlocutory decree was entered and it was registered at Kalutara

land registry under folio D206/107 on 10.10.2017.

20] Now, the Petitioner claims that her name was added as the 11th Defendant

by mistake of attorney at Law, which cannot be accepted. When a Partition

Action is instituted, there were notices issued on the Respondents and affixed

the land sought to be partitioned. If they were vigilant, this action cannot be

missed by anybody as the Petitioner lived on the same vicinity. Then question

arises why the Petitioner has not participated at the partition action if her rights

derived from Ibrahim Lebbe Marikar Mohamed Samsudeen. Though, the

Petitioner said that she was not served, she has failed to give reasonable

explanation. Mere assertion that summons was not served on her is not

sufficient to hold that interlocutory decree is bad.

21] In Jayalath Pedige Nimal Chandrasiri vs Karuna Pedige Seeti others,

SC APPEAL NO: SC/APPEAL/89/2011, Decided on: 12.05.2023, His Lordship

Samayawardhena, J. held that District Judge has no obligation to help parties

who do not take part. His Lordship holds;

“This does not mean that in a partition action the burden is on the District

Judge to successfully prosecute the case on behalf of the parties whilst the

parties take no interest in the case. There is no such obligation. The District

24

Judge need not go after the parties pleading with them in earnest for help

to identify the land and then investigate title to the land. Vide Priyanthi v.

Gamage Uma (SC/APPEAL/2/2019, SC Minutes of 15.10.2021).”

22] In Thilagaratnam v. Athpuna [1996] 2 Sri LR 66 at 68 His Lordship

Anandacoomaraswamy J. stated:

“The Learned Counsel for the Appellant cited several authorities

Goonaratne v. Bishop of Colombo 32 NLR 337, Peris v. Perera 1 NLR

362, Neelakutty v. Alvar 20 NLR 372, Cooray v. Wijesuriya 62 NLR 158,

Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas 59 NLR 546 at 549 and Sheefa v.

Colombo Municipal Council 36 NLR 38 and stated that it is the duty of

the Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the

judgement is a judgement in rem. We are not unmindful of these authorities

and the proposition that it is the duty of the Court to investigate title in a

partition action, but the Court can do so only within the limits of pleadings,

admissions, points of contest, evidence both documentary and oral. Court

cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding the shares

in the corpus for them, otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and

expect the Court to do their work and their Attorneys-at-Law’s work for them

to get title to those shares in the corpus.”

23] Further, in Francis Wanigasekera v. Pathirana [1997] 3 Sri LR 231 at

234- 235, His Lordship Weerasekera J. considered the duty cast upon on

investigation title as;

“Learned Counsel also urged that the learned District Judge failed to act in

terms of section 25 of the Partition Act which requires Court to examine and

hear and receive evidence of the title of each party as decided in the case of

Sirimalie v. Punchi Ukku 60 NLR 448. I do agree that section 25 of the

Partition Act requires the Court to examine and hear and receive evidence of

the title and interest of each party. But it must be remembered that the literal

application of the provisions of this section would lead to the most

25

disturbing, hilarious and absurd result and no partition case could ever be

finally concluded.”

24] Thus, this court cannot see any failure of investigation of title by the learned

District Judge. This Petitioner said that she has no alternative remedy. It is

noteworthy to say the observation of Weerasuriya, J., in Jayaratne and

another Vs. Premadasa and others [2004] 1 SLR 340. His Lordship says;

“The Court had no jurisdiction to vary the Judgement. The decree is final

subject to appeal under Section 48(1) and also revision or restitution in

intergrum. The Court may also vary the Judgement under Section 48(4) only

in respect of the parties and in the limited circumstances….

25] Thus, the interlocutory judgment is subjected to an appeal which was not

exercised by the Petitioner as the 27th Defendant. Quite sometimes, the Petitioner

had participated in the lower court proceedings. It is seen, by journal entry 116,

dated 25.07.2018, the 27th Defendant was represented by Mr. Prabath Gamage,

AAL. It is further seen that she has represented after the interlocutory decree

until final scheme of plan and this court puzzled why the Petitioner waited till

2022 to file this action by passing Civil Appellate Court. He could have filed

revision application if the interlocutory decree is ex facie bad. I reckon, the

Petitioner is guilty on laches.

26] In Maligaspe Koralalage Arwin Peter Nanayakkara, (Deceased) and

other vs Epage Dayananda, and others, SC APPEAL NO:

SC/APPEAL/2/2019, Decided on: 15.10.2021, His Lordship Mahinda

Samayawardhena, J. noted the partition judgments and decrees should not be

easily toppled and held;

“A judgment entered in a partition action after following a longdrawn-out

cumbersome procedure shall not be set aside with a stroke of the pen and

retrial ordered causing enormous difficulties, under the popular banner

“failure to investigate title”, unless there is good cause for doing so.”

27] In Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited v. Shanmugam and

another [1995] 1 SLR 55, Ranaraja J. held the instance where restitution is

available as follows:

“Restitutio in integrum is an extraordinary remedy; it is not to be given for

mere asking or when there is some other remedy available, Mapalathan v.

Elayavan. It is a remedy which is granted under exceptional circumstances

and the power of court should be most cautiously and sparingly exercised,

(Perera-supra). A party seeking restitution must act with utmost

promptitude, Babun Appu v. Simon Appu) , (Menchinahamy - supra), and

before a change has taken place in the position of the parties,

(Sinnethamby v. Nallathamby). Where there has been negligence on the

part of the applicant seeking relief or his attorney-at-law, restitution will not

be granted (Wickremasoodya v. Abeywardene). The party invoking the

extraordinary powers of this court must display honesty and frankness.

Thus, where a party by its own conduct has acquiesced in or approbated

the defective proceedings, court will not exercise its discretion to set aside

the impugned proceedings. For it is not the function of court in the exercise

of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of the consequences of

their own folly, negligence or laches. (Don Lewis v. Dissanayake)”

28] Further, in Menchinahamy v. Munaweera 52 NLR 409, His Lordship Dias,

S.P.J. held;

“It has also been laid down that relief by way of restitutio in integrum should

be sought for with the utmost promptitude-see Babun Appu v. Simeon

Appu 3[ (1907) 11 N. L. R. at p. 45.]. It has been argued that an examination

of the relevant dates will show not only that the petitioner has been guilty

of unreasonable delay in seeking her remedy, but that the facts seem to

indicate that she is acting in collusion with the appellants whose appeal

against the interlocutory decree was dismissed by this Court. It is pointed

27

out that the judgment in appeal was delivered on 16.02.1949; that

thereafter there was some abortive attempt to appeal to the Privy Council;

and when that failed this petitioner on 10.03.1949, moved this Court and is

in effect seeking to over-rule the interlocutory decree and the judgment of

the Supreme Court in appeal. The explanation given by the petitioner in her

affidavit is that she sought her relief as soon as she heard what had

happened, and she submits that the course in this trial has gravely

prejudiced her, and she is asking for relief. I am unable on the materials

before me to hold that her statements are false. After all she is a village

woman living in a remote part of this Island, and it may well be that she

was in total ignorance of what was happening. Furthermore, there is no

evidence which would justify me in holding that she is acting in collusion

with the defeated appellants.”

29] In Perera v. Don Simon 62 NLR 118 His Lordship Sansoni, J (as he then

was) held;

“In those cases it was held that restitutio would not be granted where there

has been negligence on the part of the applicant for relief. The case is all the

worse if the error is due to the act of the plaintiff himself, as would appear

to be the case here. ...Over three years had elapsed between the entering of

the decree and the filing of the present application, and it was therefore filed

too late.”

30] In M.A. Don Lewis v. D.W.S.Disanayake 70 NLR 8 is somewhat identical

to this case. In that, His Lordship Tennekoon,J (as he then was) held;

“These being the facts the first question that arises for consideration is

whether this court should exercise its extraordinary powers of revision or by

way of Restitutio in Integrum in favour of the applicant. There is no doubt in

my mind that the petitioner was aware of the partition action from the date

the Surveyor first went on the land. Petitioner has only himself to blame if

he pursued the ill-advised course of trying to usurp the place of the 8th

28

defendant-respondent. Petitioner could, long before the Interlocutory Decree,

have sought to have himself added instead of taking the inexplicable course

he did. Even after the Interlocutory Decree was entered the petitioner in

seeking to intervene persisted in trying to persuade the District Court that

he and Carolis Caldera were one and the same person. Further when his

application to intervene was dismissed by the District Court (which in its

order explicitly stated that the petitioner’s remedy if any was by way of an

application for revision to this court) the petitioner did nothing for 8 months.

It is not the function of this court in the exercise of the jurisdiction now being

invoked to relieve parties of the consequences of their own folly, negligence

and laches. The maxim Vigilantism, non dormientibus, jura subveniunt

provides a sufficient answer to the petitioner’s application on the ground

now under consideration.”

31] Thus, we are of the view that the Petitioner is guilty on lashes and she has

failed to show exceptional circumstances to invoke jurisdiction under Article 138

of the Constitution. We uphold the preliminary objections. The Application is

dismissed, No Costs.
