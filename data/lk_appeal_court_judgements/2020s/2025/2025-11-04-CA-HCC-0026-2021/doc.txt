JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Accused’) was indicted

before the High Court of Galle for possession and Trafficking 382.3 g of heroin

under Section 54A (d) & (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, No. 13 of 1984, as amended.

At the trial, the prosecution led evidence through 7 witnesses and marking

productions P1-P28, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in his defence,

gave evidence in the witness box and called 3 witnesses in his defence. After the

trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the accused guilty on both counts in

the indictment and imposed the death sentence on 12.02.2021.

Being aggrieved by said judgment, this appeal was preferred by the Accused. The

following Grounds of Appeal were urged by the counsel for the Accused.

(a) The learned High Court Judge has completely disregarded the

suspicious nature of the informant who gave the tip-off and his heavy

involvement in the case.

(b) The time difference and distance subsequent to the arrest do not support

or confirm the prosecution's case but instead are in line with the defence

evidence and corroborate what the defence alleges.

(C) The absence of any external evidence of the incident of arrest, apart from

the evidence of the officials involved.

(d) The weight of the defence case

(e) The involvement and sudden release of Susil Kumarasiri

Facts and circumstances of the case are as follows

PW 01, IP Nihal Perera, testified that on 14th May 2001, at approximately 11:50

a.m., he received information from a private informant regarding Heroin in Galle.

Pursuant to this information, a team of police officers proceeded to the Ranmal

Hotel in Hikkaduwa. Subsequently, acting on further details provided by the same

informant on 15th May 2001, at around 1:00 a.m., the witness, accompanied by 9

police officers, departed from the hotel to a location in Galle, which the informant

identified as the residence of the Accused.

The witness, accompanied by Officer Thennakoon and the informant, proceeded

approximately 300 m along Dangedara Hiribura Road towards the residence of

the Accused. The other officers stayed in the jeep at the start of the road. At around

2:25 a.m., the witness observed the Accused opening the gate, upon which the

informant identified him as the individual engaged in drug trafficking and

subsequently departed. Moments later, the Accused stepped out through the gate,

at which point the witness and Officer Thennakoon effected his arrest around 2:30

a.m. At the time of arrest, the Accused was carrying a black shopping bag in his

right hand. Inside the bag was a nickel-coloured iron box, beneath which lay a

cellophane bag containing drug substances. The nickel-coloured box also contained

a scale with weights. Additionally, within one bag were two smaller bags—one

light green and the other pink—which the witness identified as containing drugs.

The witness summoned the other team, and although the house search yielded no

illegal items, a person who was residing there was arrested on suspicion.

Thereafter, both the seized material and the Accused were taken to the Police

Narcotics Bureau at approximately 6:40 a.m., where the material was weighed

and recorded as 1 kg and 80 g. After the production was handed over to the PW

11, PS Gurnaratne at the reserve.

During cross-examination, counsel for the Accused questioned the witness

regarding the label affixed to the parcel. The witness stated that he could not recall

whether he had glued or stapled the label.

Furthermore, the witness admitted that the productions remained in his

possession and were not sealed until arrival in Colombo. He further stated that

the production was recovered from the possession of the Accused and remained in

his custody until he arrived in Colombo. He also affirmed the ownership of the

house by Susil Kumarasiri, who was arrested in the said house. It is noteworthy

that the defence primarily questioned him regarding the sealing kit, to which he

explained its absence during the operation.

He made reference to the information he received on that day.

The witness confirmed the sequence of events, detailing how the informant

approached the officers and how the accused was apprehended through a joint

effort between the witness and the informant. He also provided an explanation for

not being in possession of the official notebooks at that time. During cross-

examination, Learned Counsel for the defence inquired about the specific

information that purportedly linked the owner of the house to the alleged plan to

transport narcotics. In reply, the witness stated that the accused had been

identified by the informant as he was exiting the house.

The witness further stated that it is correct that the informant initially reported

the Accused as approaching the bus stand, but subsequently identified him at the

house. It is noted that the incident unfolded based on the information provided by

the informant, and the identification of the Accused was made by the informant

himself. The witness also affirmed that the Accused was arrested in front of the

house.

The witness further affirmed that the Accused was apprehended with the

production in front of the house. In response to a suggestion by defence counsel

that he was testifying in favour of Susil Kumarasiri—who had been released by

the Officer-in-Charge—the witness denied the allegation. He also clarified that

the decision to release Susil Kumarasiri had not been made by him.

What we observe from the cross-examination it’s clear that the defence mainly

focused on the release of Susil Kumarasiri. But the witness confirmed that nothing

was found on him when he was arrested. He further stated that Susil Kumarasiri

was released only after an inquiry was conducted by the senior officers. When

confronted with the route, the witness affirmed that the court may refer to the

notes for verification.

Defence counsel put to the witness that he had initially proceeded to the Accused’s

residence, effected the arrest there, and subsequently took the Accused to the

residence of Susil Kumarasiri. The witness denied this suggestion.

It is pertinent to note that one of the grounds advanced by the Accused, even

during the argument stage, was that Susil Kumarasiri—admittedly the owner of

the house—had been released by the police without a proper investigation. While

it is acknowledged that Susil Kumarasiri was indeed the owner of the premises,

no incriminating material was recovered either from his possession or from within

the house. Further, we observe that Susil Kumarasiri was arrested with the

Accused and taken to Colombo after interrogation, only he was released on the

advice of the Attorney General. When we analyse the evidence he has provided on

the following matters.

1. Throughout the journey, the informant was with them informant only

identified the place and the accused, who was coming out of the house with

a bag

2. In his evidence, he clearly states that the witness found the Heroin from the

Accused

We note that there is no reason for us to disbelieve his version.

PW 5, P.S. Kapila Senaratne, corroborated the testimony of PW 1 and stated that

he, along with other officers, remained near the Buddha statue at the beginning

of the road until approximately 2:35 a.m., until the accused was apprehended by

PW 01. On the PW 01’s instructions, they have searched the house. The witness

admitted to having assisted in sealing the productions and identified the

handwriting on the envelopes used for sealing. Furthermore, during cross-

examination, the witness acknowledged that he prepared notes under the

instructions of PW 1, that the officer had made a complete and detailed record,

and that his own extended notes pertained solely to the duties he had performed.

According to PW 11, Police Sergeant Gunaratne, on 15th May 2001 at 8:15 a.m.,

PW 01 handed over to him the productions under PR Numbers 119, 120, and 121

and two suspects. The productions were secured in the designated security box,

while the suspects were placed in the jail cell and subsequently handed over to PW

13 at 5:55 p.m.

PW 13, Inspector of Police Dayananda, acknowledged that he received the

productions from PW 11 and handed them over to the Government Analyst’s

Department on 18th May 2001.

During the testimony of PW 15, Government Analyst Siriyani Sakunthala

Thennakoon, stated that on 18th May 2001, she received a production item from

PW 13. The item was duly accepted following standard procedure and was fully

sealed. The innermost bag contained the suspected substance. The brown powder

contained in the polythene bag weighed 1,056.1 grams, of which the pure quantity

of heroin was determined to be 382.3 grams.

In his dock statement, the Accused stated that, owing to his employment, he was

renting a room in the house owned by Susil Kumarasiri. He was arrested while

asleep, and the police requested access to the room, as the key was in his

possession. The Accused further alleged that the police publicly identified him to

the neighbours as a drug dealer. He noted that Susil Kumarasiri was present in

the police jeep at the time of arrest. According to the Accused, the police had

searched the house the previous night and recovered a parcel, but upon searching

his room, they found nothing. These versions were not put forward to the PW 01

during cross-examination.

The main defence taken by him is that he was implicated in a false charge.

According to the Accused, he had a room in that house which was not completed,

and he used to go there every day. The informant has indicated that the house

belongs to the accused. When a person observes person regularly goes to a house

and comes back that this person is the owner. Learned high court judge correctly

analysed the evidence of the defence. We hold that the evidence does not create

any doubt over the evidence led by PW 01.

The learned High Court Judge, upon analysing the evidence, held that the manner

in which Susil Kumarasiri was investigated and arrested does not give rise to any

reasonable doubt in this case. It is pertinent to reproduce the relevant portion of

the judgment.

We note that the central issue in this matter is whether the Accused was in

possession of the drugs, and it is undisputed that no materials were recovered from

Susil Kumarasiri and from his house. I am mindful that even if Susil Kumarasiri

had been in possession of drugs, such a fact would not, in itself, cast doubt on the

Accused’s possession of drugs. We are mindful that the arrest occurred at that

moment because Susil Kumarasiri did not identify himself as the owner of the

house, and the failure to properly verify his identity contributed to his

apprehension.

It is noted that Susil Kumarasiri was released following the conclusion of the

investigation. Upon analysing the testimony of PW 01, it is evident that the

informant accompanied him throughout the operation and was the individual who

pointed out both the house and the Accused to the witness, thereby facilitating the

arrest. The principal defence advanced by the Accused is that his arrest was falsely

effected in order to secure the release of Susil Kumarasiri. On the other hand, PW

1 has stated that the accused was arrested outside the house with drugs.

We don’t see any discrepancy in the evidence of PW 01 and note that the

subsequent arrest of another individual does not affect the validity of the initial

arrest. In the drug cases following items have been proven by the prosecution

1. The accused was arrested with illegal substances.

2. The accused had the exclusive possession of such product,

3. After the arrest, the substance was properly sealed and handed over to the

reserve, and it was kept under custody till it was sent to the Government

Analyst.

4. Then the government analyst should confirm whether the production

received by him comes under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance.

In this instant case, we note that it is observed that the prosecution has

established that the Accused was in exclusive possession of the heroin, which was

duly forwarded to the Government Analyst in accordance with proper procedure.

Taking all the aforementioned matters into account, we find no reason to interfere

with the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the conviction and sentence imposed on

the Accused are affirmed.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
