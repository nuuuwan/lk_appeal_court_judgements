"is permissible in our view, sentence bargaining should not be encouraged at all and"
"must be frowned upon.”"
"Further held that;"
"“We are in agreement with the observations of Basnayake, A.C.J. that whilst ""the"
"reformation  of  the  criminal  though  no  doubt  is  an  important  consideration  in"
"assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, where the public"
"interest  or  the  welfare  of  the  state  outweighs  the  previous  good  character,"
"antecedents  and  age  of  the  offender,  that  public  interest  must  prevail.""  Having"
"regard to the manner and the ingenuity with which the crimes that the Accused-"
"Respondent has committed to which he has pleaded guilty, we are of the view that"
"the sentence imposed is grossly inadequate. In our view the crimes to which the"
"Accused-Respondent  pleaded  guilty  are  of  a  very  serious  nature  and  have  been"
"committed with much planning, deliberation and manipulation and called for an"
"immediate custodial sentence.”"
"The above dictum was considered by His Lordship S.N. Silva J (as he was then) in  The"
"Attorney General v. Ranasinghe and Others 1992 2 SLR 81 at page 88;"
"“It is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the Lord Chief Justice in the"
"Court  of  Appeal  of  England,  with  regard  to  the  sentence  to  be  imposed  for  an"
"offence of rape. In the case of Roberts at page 244. It was observed as follows:"
"“Rape is always a serious crime. Other than in wholly exceptional circumstances,"
"it calls for an immediate custodial sentence. This was certainly so in the present"
"case. A custodial sentence is necessary for a variety of reasons. First of all to mark"
"the  gravity  of  the  offence.  Secondly  to  emphasise  public  disapproval.  Thirdly  to"
"serve as a warning to others. Fourthly to punish the offender, and last but by no"
"means least, to protect women. The length of the sentence will depend on all the"
"circumstances. That is a trite observation, but these, in cases of rape vary widely"
"from case to case.”"
"Further held that"
"“It is seen that several of these aggravating circumstances are present in the case."
