"The  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  includes  a  provision  that  enables  the  learned"
"High Court Judge to acquit the accused."

"the evidence on the part of the prosecution or is of opinion that such evidence fails"
"to  establish  the  commission  of  the  offence  charged  against  the  accused  in  the"
"indictment  or  of  any  other  offence  of  which  he  might  be  convicted  on  such"
"indictment, he shall record a verdict of acquittal; if however the judge considers"
"that there are grounds for proceeding with the trail he shall call upon the accused"
"for his defence."
"There is another section that addresses acquittal before the trial by jury."
"220  (1)  When  the  case  for  the  prosecution  is  closed.  If  the  judge  considers  that"
"there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence he shall direct the jury"
"to return a verdict of “not guilty.”"
"I
n both sections, the Judge has the authority to acquit the accused if no evidence"
"is presented before him or the jury. However, this decision can only be made by"
"the learned High Court Judge only at the conclusion of the prosecution case."

"158, court held that:"
"“Under this provision the Judge can direct the Jury to return a verdict of not guilty"
"only at the close of the prosecution case. A practice appears to have developed in"
"our Courts of Judges stopping a case even before that stage is reached. This matter"

"""The procedure actually adopted by the learned Judge in this case, is to our"
"knowledge, not infrequently resorted to by Judges in this country when it becomes"
"apparent to the Court and counsel that to continue is to waste precious time and"
"that there is no purpose of ""flogging a dead horse"". We ourselves have no desire,"
