"prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding."
"n R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:"
"“A  criminal  trial  is  not  a  game  where  one  side  is  entitled  to  claim  the"
"benefit  of  any  omission  or  mistake  made  by  the  other  side,  and  a"
"Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an umpire to see"
"that  the  rules  of  the  game  are  applied  by  both  sides.  A  Judge  is  an"
"administrator  of  justice,  not  merely  a  figure-head,  he  has  not  only  to"
"direct  and  control  the  proceedings  according  to  recognised  rules  of"
"procedure but to see that justice is done”."
