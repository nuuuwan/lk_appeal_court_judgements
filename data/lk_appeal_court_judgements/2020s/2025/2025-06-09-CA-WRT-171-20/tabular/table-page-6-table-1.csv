"WRT/0171/20"
"8.  The learned DSG relying on Section 60 of the Ordinance, submitted that"
"a  nomination  or  the  cancellation  thereof  of  a  successor  is  not  valid,"
"unless such nomination or the cancellation is duly registered before the"
"death of the owner of the holding or the permit holder. The operative"
"argument is that the petitioner has failed to place before this Court any"
"evidence of the registration of his nomination. As such, the  apparent"
"nomination, referred to in documents 3R1, the permit, 3R1A, the land"
"ledger, and A1(a), the letter dated 21.12.2016 is not valid. As opposed"
"to  that,  the  nominations  of  the  4th  and  the  5th  respondents  are"
"registered, and is therefore valid."
