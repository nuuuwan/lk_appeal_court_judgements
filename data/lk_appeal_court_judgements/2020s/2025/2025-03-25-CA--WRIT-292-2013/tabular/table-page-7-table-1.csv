"“The situation is different where the company has received income"
"on  a  continuous  basis  from  the  transactions  carried  out 
in  the"
"course of the business of trading in securities (i.e., sale or purchase"
"of shares in the share market, which goes beyond the activity of a"
"simple acquisition or sale of shares). Such transactions would be a"
"supply of services provided for consideration as part of continuous"
"commercial activities of such company.”"
"In  addition, 
the  Petitioner  has  admitted 
that 
the  Petitioner  merely"
"provides  the  surrounding  environment  to  facilitate  the  activities  of  a"
"Casino. I am of the view that such a facilitation could be considered as a"
"supply of services as defined in Section 83 of the VAT Act because in the"
"absence of such facilitation, the wagering activities affiliated with a Casino"
"could not reasonably exist."
"Furthermore,  the  Department  of 
Inland  Revenue  has  relied  on 
(R4)"
"Section 5 of the Act, which stipulates the mechanism for calculating the"
"value  of  a  taxable  supply  of  services  for  business  activities  such  as  the"
"Petitioner’s  business.  Said  Section  5(4)  of  the  Act 
is  reproduced  as"
"follows:"
"5(4)  Where  a  supply  of  services  is  made  under  any  lottery  or  any"
"taxable activity of entering into or negotiating a waging contract or"
"any  business  of  like  nature,  the  value  of  such  supply  shall  be  the"
"total amount of money receivable in respect of such supply less the"
"consideration  of  the  prizes  or  winnings  awarded  in  such  lottery,"
"wagering contract,  or  any business of like nature as the case  may"
"be."
"The  aforesaid statute  shows  that  the  legislature  intended  to  include  the"
"services provided by the business in the nature of the Petitioner’s venture"
"under the purview of the VAT Act."
"Having  pointed  out  the  provisions  of  Section  5(4)  of  the  VAT  Act,  the"
"Respondents have contended that businesses in the nature of “wagering"
"contracts”  have  been  explicitly 
identified  as  constituting  a  supply  of"
"service  within 
the  VAT  Act.  The  activities  of  a  Casino  would  quite"
"comfortably  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  business  in  the  nature  of  a"
"wagering  contract.  The 
inclusion  of  the  term  “wagering  contract” 
in"
"Section 5(4) of the VAT Act is too much of a coincidence to be overlooked."
