"The  Respondents  state  that  the  Petitioner  did  not  respond  to  the  said"
"P4(a) within a reasonable time. Accordingly, steps were taken to register"
"the Petitioner under the VAT Act on 14.06.2007, and VAT TIN 114383430"
"7000  (where  7000  is  the  VAT  code  assigned  to  the  existing  TIN  of  the"
"Petitioner) was assigned and the VAT registration certificate was issued. In"
"support of the above, the Taxpayer Information sheet for VAT marked R2,"
"which was effective from 01.08.2004, was submitted."
"The Petitioner in response to the P4(a) by its letter dated 26.06.2007 (R3)"
"i.e. after the registration on 14.06.2007, has objected to the imposition of"
"VAT  on  Petitionerâ€™s  Casino.  However, 
the 
issue 
in 
respect  of  non-"
"registration  of  VAT  or  not  receiving  the  VAT  certificate  has  not  been"
"challenged therein. The Petitioner was informed of its liability to pay VAT"
"by letter dated 26.07.2007 (R4) by the Department of Inland Revenue."
"Section 2 of the VAT Act imposes the duty to pay VAT upon a registered"
"person.  In  terms  of  Section  21(1)  of  the  VAT  Act,  a  registered  person  is"
"liable to furnish returns of his supplies to the Commissioner-General. The"
"above-mentioned  conduct  of 
the  Petitioner 
itself 
indicates 
that 
the"
"Petitioner  has  acted  as  a  registered  VAT  payer,  as  outlined  in  the  Act.  If"
"the Petitioner was not a registered person, there would be no reason for"
"the  Petitioner  to  pay  VAT  or  submit  the  required  returns  as  specified  in"
"the Act. The very same reasons suggest a reasonable conclusion that the"
"Petitioner received the certificate of registration."
"If  the  Petitioner  had  genuine  concern  about  the  fact  that  there  was  an"
"issue  with 
registration 
status 
and 
the 
receipt  of 
the 
registration"
"certificate,  the  Petitioner  should  have  promptly  raised  this  issue  at  the"
"earliest  opportunity  by  challenging  the  decision  of  the  Department  of"
"Inland  Revenue  to  treat  the  Petitioner  as  a  registered  VAT  payer.  This"
"proactive approach could have fostered a more efficient resolution of the"
"matter. However, it is observed that the Petitioner has raised the issue of"
"non-registration only in 2009 by its letter of appeal P6 against the Notices"
"of  Assessment.  The  Petitioner  has  not  raised  the  non-registration  issue"
"even  in  the  communications  marked  R3,  R7,  R10  and  P4(b).  It  appears"
"that  the  Petitioner  has  not  even  prayed  for  the  Petitioner  to  not  be"
"considered  a 
registered  VAT  payer 
in 
the 
instant  application.  The"
"Petitioner  argued  that  there  is  no  need  to  challenge  the  registration,  as"
"there is currently no registration in effect. However, I am of the view that,"
