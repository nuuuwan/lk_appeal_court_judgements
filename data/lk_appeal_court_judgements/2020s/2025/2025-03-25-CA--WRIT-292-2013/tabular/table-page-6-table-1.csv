"succeeds in a game of chance against a customer. Therefore, the monies"
"received  by 
the  Petitioner 
from 
its  business 
activities 
cannot  be"
"considered  as  a  “supply  of  service”  as  per  the  Act.  In  this  instance,  it  is"
"important to consider what a “supply of service” means."
"Section  83  of  the  VAT  Act  defines  “supply  of  services”  as  “any  supply"
"which is not a supply of goods which includes any loss incurred in taxable"
"activity for which an indemnity is due”."
"Moreover, the Petitioner states that the gaming activities of a Casino do"
"not 
involve  any  “supply  of  goods  or  services”  as  the  VAT  cannot  be"
"practically  ascertained  by 
reference 
to 
the  value  of  such  goods  or"
"services.  However,  such  an  assessment  should  be  considered  in  light  of"
"the definition of the ‘taxable activity’ which is provided in the Act."
"“Taxable  activity”  is  defined  in  Section  83  of  the  Act  inter  alia  as  ‘any"
"activity carried on as a business, trade, profession or vocation other than"
"in the course of employment or every adventure or concern in the nature"
"of trade’. It is settled law  that a “taxable activity” is to be given a broad"
"interpretation  given  the  existence  of  the  loose  and  unrestrictive  phrase"
"“every adventure or concern in the nature of trade”. This has been clearly"
"stipulated in the case of Malwatte Valley Plantations Plc Vs. Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue 2021 2 SLR 45 as follows:"
"“It is important to note that the definition of a taxable activity in the"
"VAT  Act  includes  not  only  any  activity  carried  on  as  a  business  or"
"trade but also ""every adventure or concern in the nature of trade."""
"Hence, it need not be a trade alone, as any act in the nature of a"
"trade 
is  also  captured  under  the  definition.  This  gives  the  term"
"'taxable activity' a very broad definition; one under which the sale"
"of trees by the Appellant falls quite comfortably.”"
"In  fact,  the  activities  of  the  Casino  are  such  that  it  would  formulate  a"
"continuous  flow  of  revenue  from  the  transactions  carried  out 
in  the"
"course of its activities. Such revenue would constitute an indemnification"
"of 
a 
loss 
incurred 
in 
carrying  out 
a 
taxable 
activity. 
This 
same"
"interpretation  has  been  adopted  in  People's  Leasing  and  Finance  Plc  Vs."
"The 
Commissioner 
General 
of 
Inland 
Revenue, 
Case"
