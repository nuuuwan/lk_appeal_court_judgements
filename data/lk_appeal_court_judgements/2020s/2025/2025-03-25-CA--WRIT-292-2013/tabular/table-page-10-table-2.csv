"subsequently. In Sarath Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardene [1986] 1 SLR 275 at"
"282, Siva Selliah J. held as follows:"
"“A  Petitioner  who  seeks  relief  by  Writ  which  is  an  extraordinary"
"remedy  must  in  fairness  to  this  court,  bare  every  material  fact  so"
"that the discretion of this court is not wrongly invoked or exercised."
"In the instant case, the fact that the petitioner had a residence at"
"Dehiwala is a material fact which has an important bearing on the"
"question of the genuineness of the residence of the petitioner at the"
"annexe  and  on  whether  this  court  should  exercise  its  discretion  to"
"quash the order complained of as unjust and discriminatory. On this"
"ground too the application must be dismissed for lack of uberrima"
"fides.”"
