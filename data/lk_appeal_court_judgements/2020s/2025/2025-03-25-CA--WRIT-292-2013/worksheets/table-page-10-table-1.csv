"since the Department of Inland Revenue has treated him as a registered"
"VAT payer, the Petitioner should have pursued the appropriate relief."
"It was submitted that the Petitioner has paid the VAT for September 2004"
"(R12), and submitted nil returns from August 2004 to March 2012 (R13),"
"which  is  admitted  by  the  Petitioner.  Although  the  Petitioner  states  that"
"such  payments  were  made  under  protest,  no  sufficient  materials  have"
"been  placed  before  the  Court  to  support  the  said  stance.    Further,  it  is"
"stated  that  the  Petitioner  has  submitted  VAT  returns  for  the  period  of"
"June 2010 to September and March 2011 to March 2012(R27(a)-R27(V))."
"Hence, based on the above-attended circumstances, I am of the view that"
"the Petitioner is now estopped from denying such registration under the"
"VAT Act. Accordingly, the Petitioner's argument that the Petitioner is not"
"liable  to  pay  VAT  at  the  material  time  of  assessment  for  the  reason  of"
"non-registration under the VAT Act cannot be sustained."
