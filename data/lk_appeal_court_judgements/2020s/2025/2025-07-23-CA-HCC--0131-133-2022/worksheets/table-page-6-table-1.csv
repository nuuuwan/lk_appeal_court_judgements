"Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  appearing  for  1st  and  2nd  Appellants  and  the  Counsel"
"appearing for the 3rd Appellant that the prosecution has failed its duty by not"
"proving the case against the Appellants beyond a reasonable doubt. Further,"
"the  evidence  given  by  PW1  and  PW2  contain 
inter  se  and  per  se"
"contradictions."
"Eyewitness  testimony  stands  as  one  of  the  paramount  types  of  criminal"
"evidence,  posing  a  challenging  yet  pivotal  task  for  judges  in  evaluating"
"criminal  cases.  This  often  entails  scrutinizing  whether 
the  witness's"
"narrative  aligns  with 
established 
facts  of 
the 
case.  However,  direct"
"verification  or  falsification  of  such  accounts  may  not  always  be  feasible."
"Consequently, judges must assess the reliability of the source."
"Moreover,  while  an  eyewitness's  testimony  holds  significant  sway  in  court"
"proceedings, its accuracy in numerous cases remain questionable. Evidence"
"suggests 
that  erroneous  eyewitness  accounts  can 
result 
in  wrongful"
"convictions, leading individuals to serve extended prison sentences, and in"
"severe cases, to face capital punishment for crimes they did not commit."
"When deliberating on eyewitness evidence, the court should consider various"
"factors, including the demeanour of the witness, the inherent plausibility of"
"the  account, 
internal  consistencies,  consistency  with  prior  statements,"
"potential biases, the compatibility of the account with crime scene evidence,"
"and  corroboration  from  other  witnesses.  These  considerations  hold  great"
"significance,  especially  considering  that  the  burden  of  proof  lies  with  the"
"prosecution in all criminal cases."
