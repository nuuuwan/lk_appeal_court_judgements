JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) has been

indicted in the High Court of Ampara in High Court case number

HC/AMP/1693/2016.

The charges in the indictment are as follows,

Charge 01

That on or about September 06, 2012, at Ellegoda, in the District of

Ampara, within the jurisdiction of this Court, the appellant committed

the offence of kidnapping, of a minor girl from lawful guardianship and

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354 of the Penal

Code.

Charge 02

That in the course of the same transaction as above, the appellant

committed the offence of grave sexual abuse by placing his penis on the

Page 3 of 10

vagina of the earlier mentioned minor girl for sexual gratification, and

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 365B(2)(b) of the

Penal Code, as amended.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has proceeded to

convict the appellant of both charges and sentenced him to 7 years rigorous

imprisonment in respect of the second charge.

3. The appellant aggrieved by the conviction, disputed judgment and the

sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. On the day of the incident, PW01, her siblings together with two of their

uncles i.e. younger brothers of PW01’s mother, who also had been in their

teens have gone to a tank close by to have a bath.

5. On their return, PW01 and others have gathered near a “kon” tree to pick its

fruits. While the crowd was engaged in picking the “kon” fruits, PW01 has

moved away to collect firewood.

6. In that instance, the appellant who had been in the vicinity, has allegedly

dragged PW01 further into the forest and committed grave sexual abuse on

her by engaging in a sexual act by placing the penis of the appellant on the

vagina of PW01.

7. Following the filing of the complaint, an investigation has been initiated. The

investigators have presented PW01 before a Consultant Judicial Medical

Officer for an examination. The relevant medico-legal report has been entered

into evidence as exhibit ඳැ02.

Case of the appellant

8. The appellant has asserted that he, along with the individuals mentioned in

the testimony of PW01 went to bathe in a nearby tank. After their bath, they

have stopped near a “kon” tree to pick its fruits.

9. Following this, the appellant has returned home and has not participated in

any of the activities with PW01 as described in the second charge.

Grounds of appeal

10. When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned President’s

Counsel for the appellant raised the following grounds of appeal:

i. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in not considering the

inherent weaknesses of the case for the prosecution?

ii. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in not considering the

contradictions between the several witnesses for the

prosecution?

iii. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in acting on hearsay

evidence?

iv. Is the sentence imposed on the accused appellant excessive

considering his age at the time of the incident?

11. It is the testimony of PW01 that on the day of the incident referred to in

the charges she went to a tank for a bath, accompanied by her siblings

Page 5 of 10

and her uncles. On their return they had stopped to pick “kon” fruits.

While the others were at it, PW01 has moved away to collect firewood.

12. At that instance, an unidentified person has held PW01 from behind,

covering her eyes and mouth. Thereafter, PW01 has been dragged further

into the forest, at which time she has lost consciousness.

13. Four to five minutes later, PW01 has regained consciousness, gone back

home accompanied by her siblings and informed their mother about the

incident.

14. In this context, PW01 has asserted that she was completely unaware of

any criminal activity being perpetrated against her. Furthermore, she has

taken up the position that she does not have any knowledge of a specific

individual who may have committed an offence against her. This lack of

awareness raises important questions about the circumstances

surrounding the incident.

15. PW01 has also not provided any testimony regarding any sexual abuse

allegedly perpetrated by the appellant. Moreover, she has not specified

the nature of the acts that the appellant is accused of committing.

16. In this case, the testimony of PW01, being the victim of the incident

specified in the second charge, is of paramount importance. Her evidence

serves as a crucial pillar on which the prosecution will build its case. The

prosecution would have to heavily rely on her first-hand account to

establish the facts surrounding the incident.

17. A detailed narrative provided by the victim will not only describe the

events but also shed light on the motivations and the circumstances that

led to the crime.

Page 6 of 10

18. Furthermore, the prosecution’s case will rest significantly on this

primary testimony, as it forms the foundation upon which other pieces of

evidence will be presented.

19. While additional witnesses may offer corroborating testimonies, their

evidence will serve primarily to support and reinforce the material facts

stated by PW01. Therefore, the testimony of those supporting witnesses

can be regarded as secondary to the material narrative provided by the

victim i.e. PW01.

20. The intricate details regarding the commission of the crime – such as

sequence of events, will be revealed by PW01’s testimony.

21. PW01’s experiences and observations are critical as they light up the

context of the incident, which may otherwise remain obscured.

22. Thus, any corroborative evidence must be aligned with the victim’s

testimony, ensuring that it supports the established narrative.

23. Without PW01’s direct and compelling testimony, the prosecution’s

ability to convincingly present its case would be significantly

undermined. It is through the eyes of PW01 that this Court will gain

insight into the reality of the incident, as her testimony stands as the

central thread connecting various elements of the prosecution’s

argument.

24. Accordingly, the testimonies of PW03 and PW06 who have claimed to

have a witnessed the appellant and PW01 in a compromising position in

the forest, though not conceding is considered cogent, provide only a

Page 7 of 10

basis for suspicion. These testimonies do not conclusively provide that

the specific incident outlined in the second charge occurred.

25. While the observations of PW03 and PW06 may raise questions about the

interaction between the appellant and PW01, they fall short of

establishing the essential elements required for the second charge.

Suspicion alone is not sufficient to meet legal standard of proof needed to

substantiate the allegation being made.

26. In the case of The Queen Vs. M.G. Sumanasena [1963] 66 NLR 350,

Basnayake, C.J. held that:

“In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt.

Nor does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances

relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the

accused beyond reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give or

call evidence”

27. Further, the testimonies of PW03 and PW06 reveal significant

contradictions concerning the manner in which both the appellant and

PW01 were dressed or undressed at the time each witness claims to have

observed them in a compromising position.

28. Specifically, PW03 has asserted that PW01 and the appellant were

naked. In contrast, PW06 offers a conflicting account stating that the

appellant was dressed in a trouser. These discrepancies not only cast

doubt on the credibility of the witnesses but also complicate the overall

narrative of the incident in question.

29. In page 14 of the disputed judgment, the learned High Court Judge has

stated as follows:

30. In light of the circumstances, it is evident that the learned High Court

Judge has reviewed the contents of the statement as made to the

investigators, contained in the I.B. extracts and has regarded the

Page 9 of 10

contents of such statements as substantive evidence. However, this

practice is not permitted by law.

31. In Sri Lanka, a trial court cannot go through a statement of a witness

recorded in the Police Information Book (I.B. extracts) and consider its

contents as substantive evidence. Such statements are generally

inadmissible and cannot be used to prove a fact in issue.

32. Statements recorded in the I.B. are used for a limited and specific

purpose, the court can only look at these statements when a witness is

testifying in court and is confronted with a previous statement they made

to an investigator. This process serves to test the credibility of a witness

and establish omissions. The defence can use a prior inconsistent

statement to contradict a witness’s testimony given in court. The defence

can also bring up an omission in a prior statement to challenge the

witness’s memory and credibility.

33. In Punchi Mahattaya v. The State [1973] 76 NLR 564, Fernando P. held

that:

“Court of Criminal Appeal (or Supreme Court in appeal) has not authority to

peruse statements of witnesses recorded by the police in the course in

their investigation, (i.e., statement in the Information Book) other than

those properly admitted in evidence by way of contradiction or otherwise.”

34. The matters discussed being as above, it is the view of this Court that it

is not necessary for it to delve into the third and fourth grounds of

appeal.

35. In those circumstances, I am inclined to interfere with the conviction,

disputed judgment together with the sentencing order and I set aside the

same accordingly.

Appeal allowed

I make no order regarding costs

36. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment for

the High Court of Ampara for compliance.
