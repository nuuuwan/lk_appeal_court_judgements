"The Petitioners allege that the inquiring officer, the 2nd Respondent, proceeded to issue"
"the charges, disregarding the evidence led on behalf of the 1st Petitioner, and the charges"
"have  been  issued  without  due  and  proper  analysis  of  evidence  and  an  explanation"
"supported by any reason. However, the Respondent argues that the charges were framed"
"after evaluating all the evidence led on behalf of the Petitioners.  The reasons for the"
"findings  in  the  document  marked  a  P5  are  clearly  set  out  in  the  observations  of  the"
"inquiring officer marked as 1R5. When taking into consideration the observations of"
"the inquiring officer marked as 1R5, this Court agrees with the learned DSG appearing"
"for the Respondents that charges have been framed after proper analysis of the evidence"
"led before the inquiry. Furthermore, during the oral submissions, the learned Counsel"
"appearing for the Petitioner argued that the observations were not given to them and"
"they were not aware of the existence of such document.  In the order marked P7, the"
"inquiring officer has stated that the observations have not been issued to the Petitioners"
"as it is a statutory requirement for the Petitioners to request the same after making the"
"necessary payments. This Court observes that at the end of each inquiry, the Petitioners"
"have  requested  the  uncertified  copies  of  the  inquiry  and  the  inquiring  officer  has"
"instructed the officer assisting the inquiry to issue the same after recovering the due"
"charges.  One  cannot  simply  argue  that  they  were  unaware  of  the  existence  of  a"
"document and therefore this Court is not inclined to accept the argument of the learned"
"Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that they were not given the observations of the"
"inquiring officer."
