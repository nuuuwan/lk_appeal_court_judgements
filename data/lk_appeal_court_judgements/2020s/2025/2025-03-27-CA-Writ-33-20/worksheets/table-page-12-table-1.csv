"Tilakawardena, J. (P/CA) (as she then was) held that,"
"“However it is clear that the Company was all times represented through the 2nd"
"petitioner  at  the  inquiry  and  he  had  accepted  to  show  cause  on  behalf  of  the"
"Company during the inquiry. Therefore though the Company has a separate legal"
"entity distinct from  its  members  and share holders  the 2nd petitioner has been"
"employed as the representative of the Company in this case. In any event, as the"
"Company has no physical existence in its affairs it is clearly 160 managed by its"
"agents, in this case the 2nd petitioner and therefore it can be concluded that the"
"charges framed against the 2nd Petitioner on behalf of the Company were valid.”"
