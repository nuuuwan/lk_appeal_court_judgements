"determination of this Application.‚Äù"
"The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners in his oral submission argued that the"
"allegation against the 1st Petitioner in the case brief at the preliminary stage was that"
"the  1st  Petitioner  illegally  disposed  Semi  Extensible  Sack  kraft  papers  to  the  local"
"market, misusing the TIEP scheme. However, when leading evidence subject to cross-"
"examination  and  re-examination,  the  inquiring  officer  framed  charges  based  on  the"
"evidence of the witness called Kottachchi on a new basis that was not originally there"
"in the case brief. The Petitioners allege that the inquiring officer changed the basis of"
"the allegation that they have not accounted for everything that has been imported under"
"the  TIEP  scheme.  Therefore,  the  Petitioners  argue  that  there  is  a  violation  of  the"
"principles of Natural justice as they were not informed of the new allegations."
