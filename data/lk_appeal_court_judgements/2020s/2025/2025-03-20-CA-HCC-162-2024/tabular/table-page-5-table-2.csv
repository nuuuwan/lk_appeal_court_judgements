"7.  Thereafter, 
the  Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  objecting 
to  a"
"variance  in  the  sentences  imposed  on  the  appellant  has  contended"
"that  upon  a  careful  analysis  of 
the 
judgment 
in  SC  Reference"
"03/2008,  the  legal  implications  of  the  enactment  of  the  proviso  to"

"Further,  it  is  also  contended  that  the  intention  of  the  legislature  in"
"enacting  a  minimum  mandatory  sentence  should  be  considered  vis  a"
