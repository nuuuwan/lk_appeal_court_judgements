"The Appellant admitted the contents of the Government Analyst Report. The"
"prosecution had not taken any endeavour to clarify the weight discrepancy"
"highlighted by the Government Analyst during the trial."
"Nevertheless, it is the paramount duty of the Prosecution to prove that it is"
"the same production recovered at the time of detection which has reached"
"the Government Analyst. The main reason is to establish that the evidence,"
"which is related to the alleged crime, was collected from the accused and was"
"in its original condition rather than having been tempered with or planted"
"deceitfully  to  make  someone  else  guilty,  which  helps  in  establishing  an"
"undisturbed  inward  journey  of  the  substance,  which  as  stated  above  is"
"essential in the prosecution of accused for drug related offences. Handling of"
"production evidence is a lengthy process but the court necessitates it for the"
"proper  adjudication  of  causes  related  to  drugs  cases.  This  proves  the"
"integrity of the production which had been recovered from the accused has"
"been preserved until it reaches the Government Analyst Department."
"In this regard, the Learned High Court Judge in her judgment had not made"
"any  comments  about  the  discrepancy  in  weight  in  the  given  case.  In  the"
"absence  of  any  comment  regarding  this  particular  point;  no  doubt,  the"
"Appellant had not been afforded a fair trial. Thereby, this has caused great"
"prejudice to him."
"As the weight discrepancy is a substantial fact, the prosecution had not put"
"relevant questions to PW1. Further, the Government Analyst was not called"
"to explain the reason for the difference. Considering the pure Heroin detected"
"in this case, a discrepancy in weight is crucial which certainly have impact"
"on the outcome of the net result of the Government Analyst."
"As the discrepancy in weight in a drug related case of this nature is crucial"
"to the outcome of the case, it is not necessary to address the other grounds"
"of appeal raised by the Appellant."
