"the  production  were  handed  over  to  the  reserve  police  officer  PC  3986"
"Pathmini at the Aranayake Police Station."
"The parcel pertaining to the Appellant had been registered under production"
"No. 348/2018, which was produced to the Mawanella Magistrate Court along"
"with the Appellant. The production had been retained at the police station"
"under  different  reserve  duty  officers  before  being  taken  to  the  Magistrate"
"Court in Mawanella. After obtaining a court order, the production had been"
"handed over to the Government Analyst Department on 29/03/2018."
"The prosecution led 05 witnesses excluding the Government Analyst, marked"
"productions  and  closed  the  case.  The  Government  Analyst  Report  was"
"admitted under Section 420 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Thereafter,"
"the defence was called and the Appellant made a dock statement and called"
"a witness."
"In his dock statement, the Appellant took up the position that he was never"
"in  possession  of  any  dangerous  drugs  as  claimed  by  the  prosecution."
"According to him, his father was arrested first and when he visited the police"
"station,  his  father  was  released  and  he  was  taken  into  custody.  In  his"
"contention the drugs were introduced to him by the 1st and 2nd witnesses."
"His father gave evidence in support of his defence."
"It is essential to consider here the fundamental doctrine that all persons are"
"presumed innocent until proven guilty and entitled to their freedom unless"
"and  until  they  are  found  guilty  by  a  Court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  This"
"principle  places  the  burden  of  proof  on  the  prosecution  to  demonstrate,"
"beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  the  accused  committed  the  crime. It"
"ensures  fairness  in  the  legal  process  and  protects  individuals  from  being"
"unfairly convicted or punished."
