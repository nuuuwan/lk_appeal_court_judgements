"and comes back to the court should be established‚Äù."
"Under the first ground of appeal,  the Appellant takes up the position that"
"there is a discrepancy in the weight of Heroin recovered from the Appellant"
"and the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for the Appellant contends"
"that  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  misdirected  himself  by  failing  to  analyse  the"
"weight discrepancy which disturbs the production chain. He submits further"
"that this is a substantial fact that the prosecution will have to prove beyond"
"a reasonable doubt."
"According to the Chief Investigation Officer PW1, SI Gamini, the substance"
"found  in  the  possession  of  the  Appellant  was  weighed  using  an  electronic"
"scale used in the afore-mentioned jewellery shop. He had chosen this option"
"considering  that  the  weighing  machines  used  in  the  jewellery  shops  are"
"registered  and  accurate.  In  that  instance,  the  parcel  recovered  from  the"
"Appellant was seem to be weighing about 8.400 grams of substance."
"However,  when  the  productions  were  taken  to  the  Government  Analyst"
"Department,  a  notable  difference  in  weight  had  been  noted  in  the  parcel."
"According to the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as P9"
"in  the  High  Court  Trial,  the  weight  of  the  parcel  was  mentioned  as  6.956"
"grams. This is 1.494 grams less than the original weight. The Government"
"Analyst has also made a note of it in the report.  Hence, the Appellant argues"
"that the weight difference creates a serious doubt in the prosecution case."
"When this Court invited the Respondent to explain  the discrepancy in  the"
"weight of the substance, the Additional Solicitor General submitted that as"
"the Appellant had admitted the Government Analyst Report under Section"
"420 of the CPC, he cannot contest this discrepancy in the appeal."
