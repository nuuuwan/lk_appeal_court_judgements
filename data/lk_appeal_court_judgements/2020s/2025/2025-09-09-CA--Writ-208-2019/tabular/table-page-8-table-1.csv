"been  any  arbitrary  exercise  of  power  by  the  administrative  authority  in"
"question.”"
"In the above circumstances, it is obvious that the State had acquired the"
"impugned property in view  of alienating such property to the Petitioner"
"Society,  and 
the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  have 
throughout  made"
"representations to that effect."
"In  Samarakoon  and  others  v.  University  Grants  Commission  and  others"
"[2005]  1  Sri  LR  119  at  130  Bandaranayake.J.  with 
Jayasinghe 
J.  and"
"Fernando 
J.  agreeing  held:  “Legitimate  expectation  derives 
from  an"
"undertaking given by someone in authority and such an undertaking may"
"not even be expressed and would have to be known from the surrounding"
"circumstances."
"A  public body  may  act  in  a  manner  which  creates  an  expectation  in  the"
"mind of a person or body. A legitimate expectation will arise in the mind"
"of a person where such person has been led to understand by the words"
"or  actions  of  the  decision-maker  that  a  certain  act  may  or  may  not  be"
"done. Moreover,  those who form expectations tend to act in reliance of"
"such  expectations.  In  the  instant  application,  the  Petitioner  Society  has"
"also acted in reliance of the continuous representations made by the  1st"
"and  the  2nd  Respondents  by  continuing  to  conduct  business  activities  in"
"such  premises.  Where  such  expectations  have  been  created  and  where"
"parties have relied on such expectations, the decision-maker is not free to"
"simply ignore such a request."
"Meanwhile, the 1st and 2nd Respondents have taken steps to suspend the"
"process of alienation of the impugned property to the Petitioner Society."
"According to the Document dated 12.09.2012 marked A33, the reason for"
"this suspension was the failure to take steps to evict the individuals with"
"whom the Petitioner Society entered into agreements."
"In  Multinational  Property  Development  Limited  v  Urban  Development"
"Authority. 1996(2) Sri LR 51, Ranaraja J, held that “…. Individuals who have"
"legitimate  expectations  based  on  promises  made  by  public  bodies  that"
"they will be granted certain benefits, have a right to be heard before those"
"benefits are taken away from them ….”"
