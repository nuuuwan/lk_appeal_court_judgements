"The Petitioner Society argues that these allegations are frivolous and that"
"no fair hearing was given before such a decision was made. Furthermore,"
"there  is  no  material  produced  before  this  Court  to  establish  that  the  1st"
"and 2nd Respondents informed the Petitioner Society to take steps to evict"
"those individuals before issuing the said letter A33. Therefore, it appears"
"that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have failed to provide a valid justification"
"for suspending the process of alienation of the property to the Petitioner"
"Society. Thus, the Respondents have acted irrationally, unreasonably and"
"in  complete  neglect  of  the 
legitimate  expectations  of  the  Petitioner"
"Society  while  depriving  the  Petitioner  Society  of  a  fair  hearing,  which"
"amounts  to  a  breach  of  natural  justice  and  was  accordingly  ultra  vires."
"Thus,  the  suspension  of  the  alienation  process  communicated  via  the"
"letter dated 12.09.2012 marked A33 is invalid and illegal."
"It appears that the Respondents have deviated from their original stance"
"and  suspended  the  process  of  alienation  of  property  to  the  Petitioner"
"Society only after the 3rd Respondent, Pradeshiya Sabhawa, took steps to"
"construct  a  conference  hall 
in 
the  disputed  property

"Regional Coordinating Committee meeting held on 12.06.2012. As per the"
"proceedings of the above-mentioned meeting held on 12.06.2012 (A27),"
"since the old  cooperative  society building was in a deplorable state,  the"
"General Manager of the Petitioner Society had been instructed to resolve"
"the matter by discussing the possibility of removing the old  cooperative"
"building and constructing a new building in its place in which the ground"
"floor was to be used by the cooperative society and the upper floor was"
"to be used as the conference hall of Pradeshiya Sabhawa (A27(i)). It had"
"been agreed that  the matter was to  be  resolved in consultation  with all"
"relevant 
parties. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
Respondents 
have 
failed 
to"
"demonstrate to the Court that there were such negotiations involving all"
"relevant parties and that a decision was reached."
"It  appears 
from 
the  documents 
(A34,  A35,  A36)  submitted  by 
the"
"Petitioner  Society  that  the  1st  Respondent  was  not 
in  a  position  to"
"consider  the  Petitioner  Societyâ€™s  claim  for  the  area 
in  the  proposed"
"building 
constructed  by 
the  Pradeshiya  Sabhawa.  However,
