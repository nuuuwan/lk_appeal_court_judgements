"“Provided 
that  no 
judgment,  decree  or  order  of  any  court  shall  be"
"reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which"
"has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a"
"failure of justice”. (Emphasis is mine.)"

2.  The  proviso  aforesaid 
is  couched 
in  mandatory 
terms  and 
the"
"burden

the  party  seeking  relief  to  satisfy 
the  court 
that 
the"
"impugned 
error,  defect 
or 
irregularity  has 
either  prejudiced 
the"
"substantial rights of the parties or has occasioned a failure of justice. It"
"must  be  observed  that  no  such  Constitutional  provision  is  to  be  found"
"either 
in 
the 
‘1948  Soulbury  Constitution’  or 
the 
‘First  Republican"
"Constitution of 1972’."
