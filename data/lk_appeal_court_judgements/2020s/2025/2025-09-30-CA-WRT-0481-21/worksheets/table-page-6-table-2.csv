"per Sections 16 and 23 of the COI Act, as amended. The basis of this"
"argument is twofold:"
"(1)  that by virtue of Section 13 of the COI Act, a person who is"
"summoned to give evidence is entitled to all the privileges to"
"which  a  witness  giving  evidence  before  a  court  of  law  is"
"entitled; and"
"(2)  that  under  Section  16  of  the  COI  Act,  if  a  person  whose"
"conduct is the subject of an inquiry under the said Act or who"
"is implicated or concerned in the matter under inquiry shall"
"be entitled to be represented during the whole of the inquiry."
