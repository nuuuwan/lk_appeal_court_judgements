However, one must be mindful that the writ jurisdiction of this Court is an original jurisdiction. In other words, this Court is called upon to totally depend on the material supplied by the parties of such writ application. Thus, there is an incumbent and sacred duty on the part of the Petitioner in particular, to adduce sufficient admissible and reliable evidence to prove its case before Court. According to Rule 3 (1) (a) cited above, it is a \u2018duly certified copy\u2019 of the document (in the absence of original), material to the application in hand and not a \u2018true copy' that the Petitioner is required to submit with his application. It must be borne in mind that there are two requirements in the above phrase. The first is that the relevant copy must be certified and the second is that the said certification must be duly done. The phrase \u2018duly certified copy\u2019 must mean that the authority responsible for its issuance must have certified the copy submitted to Court as a copy duly obtained from the original. It is only then that a Court of Law can rely and act on such document.\u201d [emphasis added.] Surasena, J. (as his Lordship then was), in the above judgement, also",
