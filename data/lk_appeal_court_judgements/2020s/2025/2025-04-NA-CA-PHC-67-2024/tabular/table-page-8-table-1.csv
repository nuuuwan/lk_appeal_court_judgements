"considered irrelevant facts when she refused the Appellant’s application. When we peruse"
"the record, there is no indication that the father of the driver was convicted of a similar"
"offence."
"It should be noted that the said driver had worked with the Appellant's father and her for"
"more than 3 years and there was no prior conviction. Further, the said lorry was never"
"used for any illegal activities or commission of an offence prior to this event."
"We  hold  that  the  Learned  Magistrate  has  wrongly  come  to  the  conclusion  and  has  not"
"applied the legal principles when she dealt with the inquiry on the confiscation.  The only"
"matter to be considered by the Learned Magistrate is whether the owner has established"
"that she has taken all precautions against the commission of the offence and the offence"
"was committed without her knowledge. This matter needs to be established on a balance"
"of probability."
"I hold that the Learned Magistrate has erred in analysing the law in relation to Section"
"40(1) of the Forest Ordinance. Therefore, the said order is to be quashed."
"The  next  question  is  whether  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  correctly  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the Appellant was not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time of"
"the commission of the offence."
"When we peruse the document of Certificate of Registration of Motor Vehicle marked as"
"ඉ1,  the  previous  owner’s  name  was  Samaranayaka  Mudalige  Upali  Samaranayaka"
"contained in a column debited related to the lorry. According to the said document, the"
"said  transaction  took  place on 20.07.2022. In other words, the  current  owner Darshani"
"Sandamali de Silva Pulle, became the owner of the lorry since 20.07.2022. According to"
"the  charge  sheet,  the  offence  was  committed  on  30.07.2022.  Therefore,  the  Learned"
"Provincial High Court Judge erred in concluding that the Appellant was not the registered"
