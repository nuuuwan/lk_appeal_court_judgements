The person who prepared P15 has no expertise in regard to archaeology or the preservation of archaeological monuments. In regard to the preservation of the archaeological monument, the opinion of a Conservator of Forest cannot prevail over the opinion of the Director General of the Department of Archaeology. Another consideration is that the unearthing of the ancient monument will cause damage to the Bo tree in the temple.

The Buddha Sasana in this country is primarily protected, managed, fostered by those who are in charge of that task namely, the Buddhist religious leaders. The Chief Prelates of the different chapters are forerunners in this regard. The duty on the State and the Republic is to give a helping hand such as making an appropriate legal frame work to make the environment conducive for those religious leaders to take appropriate steps to ensure that the Buddha Sasana is given foremost place, protected and fostered in this country.",
