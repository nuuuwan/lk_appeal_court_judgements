"the following day. The Appellant is PW1’s mother’s sister’s husband."
"After dinner PW1 had slept with the daughter of the Appellant. The Appellant"
"had also slept among them. When the Appellant’s daughter was fast asleep,"
"the Appellant had touched PW1’s body, removed her clothes and inserted his"
"penis  into  her  vagina  for  about  five  minutes.  As  he  received  a  call,  the"
"Appellant  had  left  the  house  leaving  the  victim.  She  has  fallen  asleep  and"
"when  she  woke  in  the  morning,  she  had  seen  that  her  aunt  had  returned"
"home."
"Initially, she had told the incident to her father’s sister’s daughter PW3. PW3"
"had told the same to the victim’s mother but her mother had not acted upon"
"it. Thereafter, the incident has come to light when the victim wrote a letter"
"about the incident and put the same into a complaint box fixed at her school."
"She had written the letter on World Children’s Day. After about a week, her"
"statement had been recorded by the Tangalle Police. The victim was only 11"
"years old when she had encountered this bitter ordeal."
"PW3, Nadeera had confirmed the details in her evidence."
"PW4, JMO Seveviratne gave evidence upon the Medico Legal Report of the"
"victim. After obtaining the history verbally from PW1, the JMO had examined"
"the  victim’s  genital  area  and  stated  that  the  examination  revealed  some"
"findings which are seen in sexual manipulation of vulva."
"Now  I  consider  whether  the  evidence  given  by  the  prosecutrix  could  be"
"accepted without any corroboration to prove the charge of rape against the"
"Appellant."
