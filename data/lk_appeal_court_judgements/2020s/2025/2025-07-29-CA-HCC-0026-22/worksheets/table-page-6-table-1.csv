"Adopting this principle, we have sought to examine the evidence, and we are inclined to agree"
"with the learned counsel for the 2nd accused appellant that the failure to produce the dairy, in"

"the injuries to the doctor, and the doctor confirmed the injury. According to PW 04, while they"
"held her hands, they were trying to take medicine from her. The PW 05 has stated that when"
"she entered the room, both Accused were holding the witness’s hand. The first Accused has"
"admitted that the fourth witness has identified him as a police officer. The Learned High Court"
"has correctly come to the conclusion that they have prevented her from performing her official"
"duty."
