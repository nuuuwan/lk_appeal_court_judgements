"In  The  Law  of  Evidence, Volume  2,  Book  2,  page  653,  E.R.S.R.  Coomaraswamy  define"
"decoys and spies as follows:"
"“Decoys are not accomplices. Thus, the evidence of a police officer, who pretended to be an"
"accomplice, does not require corroboration as in the case of an accomplice. The rule does not"
"apply to persons who have joined in, or even provoked the crime as police spies, or the police,"
"who have assented thereto. Though there is no rule for corroboration of the evidence of a decoy,"
"it should be examined with caution, and it is desirable not to convict on the sole evidence of a"
"decoy.”"
"Beddewela v. Albert, 42 NLR 136 at page 139, Soertsz J held that;"
"I have examined most of these cases, and it seems clear that in nearly every one of them the"
"evidence of the decoy was rejected not merely because he was a decoy, but for some additional"
"reason, such as his bad character, his ill-will towards the accused, his unsatisfactory demeanour,"
"and things like that."
"For instance, in Coldera v. Pedrick, there was evidence to show that there was a special reason"
"and a special motive for the decoy wishing to implicate the accused. It is true, Garvin J. indeed"
"said,  ""  whether  there  was  such  a  motive  or  not,  there  is  the  fact  that  he  was  a  decoy"".  In"
"estimating the assistance that can be derived from that judgment, proper emphasis must be laid"
"on the words"" in this case "" in view of the fact that there was evidence of "" special motive""."
"Further, he held that in Almeida v. Adiriya, Akbar J. rejected the evidence of the decoy not only"
"because he was a decoy but also because there were strong reasons in that case for suspecting"
"the  bona  fides  of  the  prosecution.  Moreover,  he  found  that  the  decoy's  and  the  Inspector's"
"version  of  the  sale  was  unconvincing. All  he  said,  by  way  of  general  observation  on  the"
"evidence of decoys, was that their "" evidence should be examined with great care as interested"
"parties may on little inducement give the necessary touch to their evidence in order to secure a"
"conviction"". That is, if I may say so, an unexceptionable observation."
"This  concept  of  evidence  should  be  examined  with  great  care,  as  considered  by  Justice"
"Sameerawickrame J in the case of Ariyarantne v. Food and Price Control Inspector, Galle,"
"74 NLR 19 at page 21, stating that;"
"The  learned  magistrate  makes  no  mention  of  the  fact  that  Gunasekera  was  not  called  as  a"
"witness and states that the two prosecution witnesses, namely, Bamunuvitarane and the decoy,"
"corroborated one another and were consistent in their testimony. He has misdirected himself in"
