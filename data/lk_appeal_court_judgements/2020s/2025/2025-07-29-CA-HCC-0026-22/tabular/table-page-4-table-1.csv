"experience pain, followed by insertion of a capsule into the anus and additional medication to"
"relieve the pain."
"A
fter obtaining the signatures of PW 04 and PW 06, the first accused instructed PW 06 to leave"
"the room.  Then asked the witness to lie down and raise her skirt. Subsequently, he handed over"
"some tablets and handed her a glass of water. At that point, PW 04 revealed her Police identity."
"In the resulting  commotion, the first  accused bit PW 04's left  hand. When she attempted to"
"contact the team, the second accused snatched her phone. After PW 04 lost her grip, the first"
"accused managed to get all but one of the tablets. According to the evidence of PW 06, when"
"PW 04 screamed upon entering the room, she was seen holding onto both the first and second"
"accused."
"P
W 01 received a call summoning him to the Dematagoda premises, and found PW 04 with"
"bleeding  injuries,  along  with  5  tablets  from  PW  04  and  SI  Edirisinghe,  uncovered  marked"
"currency notes from the 1st Accused’s leather bag and seven additional tablets were recovered"
"from the building’s third floor."
"The main ground argued by the Accused was the absence of a search warrant in the possession"
"of PW 04 at the time of the incident, as the warrant was held by PW 03. Counsel for the Accused"
"contends that the Accused reacted out of fear upon the revelation of PW 04’s police identity,"
"citing  prevalent  concerns  about  the  impersonation  of  police  officers  during  robberies.  It  is"
"further submitted that the Accused did not exhibit any resistance towards PW 01, who entered"
"the premises in police uniform."
"Despite  conflicting  testimony  from  both  Accused  concerning  the  identity  card  that  was"
"revealed, the Learned High Court Judge ruled that the search warrant was not necessary in this"
"instance, as PW 04 was acting as a decoy. The Learned High Court Judge concluded that the"
"conduct of both accused, following the disclosure of PW 04’s identity, was executed with the"
"intent to inflict harm upon a public servant and untenable to convict them of the third charge,"
"which has proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
"The primary argument presented by the Counsel for the Accused was that the testimony of PW"
"04  lacked  corroboration  from  other  evidence.  This  raises  the  question:  Is  there  a  legal"
"requirement for corroborating a decoy’s testimony?"
