JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellants (herein after referred to as the 1st,2nd,3rd,5th Accused), along

with 4th (who died during the trial), 6th and 7th Accused, were indicted before the High

Court of Kaluthara on the following counts,

1. Being a member of an Unlawful Assembly along with the 4th Accused, which is

punishable under Section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. Committing the murder of Godage Hilarin Joseph Appuhamy while being a

member of an Unlawful Assembly along with the 4th Accused, which is punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code, read with Section 140 of the Penal Code.

3. Committing Grievous Hurt on Nihal Shelton Appuhamy (PW 01) while being

members of an Unlawful Assembly along with the 4th Accused, which is

punishable under Section 317 of the Penal Code, read with Section 140 of the Penal

Code.

4. Committing the murder of Godage Hilarin Joseph Appuhamy, along with the 4th

Accused, is punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

5. Committing Grievous Hurt on Nihal Shelton Appuhamy (PW 01) along with the

4th Accused, which is punishable under Section 317 of the Penal Code.

At the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through ten witnesses and marked

productions P1-P3 and thereafter closed its case. The 1st,2nd,3rd, 5th,6th and 7th Accused, in

their defence, made dock statements. Additionally, the 1st and 3rd Accused called 4

witnesses in their defence.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court delivered judgment on

11 September 2023. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th accused were found guilty on all five counts

of the indictment, and the 6th and 7th accused were acquitted of all counts. For the 1st

and the 3rd counts, each was sentenced to 2 years of rigorous imprisonment without a

fine. For the 2nd count, the sentence of death was imposed. Acting under section 306 of

Page 4 of 16

the Criminal Code of Procedure Act, no sentence or fine has been imposed for the 4th and

the 5th counts. The 2nd accused was ordered to pay compensation of Rs. 200,000 to PW 1

in default of 2 years rigorous imprisonment, and for the 1st,3rd and 5th accused, Rs.

50,000 of compensation was ordered in default of 12 months of rigorous imprisonment.

Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge, the Appellants filed an appeal before this Court. The principal ground

advanced by the defence was that the prosecution had failed to prove that the death was

caused by the act of the Accused. A material contradiction was highlighted between the

testimony of the eye witnesses and the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO).

According to PW 16, the JMO, the fatal injury was inflicted with a heavy blunt weapon.

In contrast, PW 1 and PW 2 testified that the first Accused assaulted the deceased with a

Manna Knife.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

On 02.01.1996, PW 1, Nihal Shelton Appuhamy, the brother of the deceased, went to

Payagala beach around 9.00 a.m. with PW 2 to collect shrimp. At that time, the 2nd

accused, along with others, came to attack the witness. The witness disclosed that, at the

alleged time, he and the Second Accused were not on speaking terms due to a transaction

over shrimps. The witness identified Prisil, 2nd Accused, Ajith, 1st Accused, Walle Ajith,

3rd Accused, Lal, 4th Accused, and Sagara, 5th Accused, among the group. He further

stated that although Bindu (6th Accused) and Roshan (7th Accused) were also present, he

did not know their names personally at the time.

After gathering the shrimp, PW 1 and PW 2 proceeded to PW 3’s house to weigh them. At

that time, they were confronted by the 2nd Accused and several other accused, armed

with poles and knives. The 1st Accused has threatened them by saying, “අද දදදෙන් එෙක්

ඉවර ෙරනවා” and had tried to attack the witness. The PW 3, together with his neighbours

and sons, intervened and rescued PW 1 by taking him inside his house. Subsequently, the

accused left the scene and proceeded towards Madina Kanda.

Following the incident, the deceased, one of PW 1’s elder brothers, arrived at PW 3’s

residence in a van accompanied by a driver. At that time, PW 1 and PW 2 were inside PW

3’s house, and PW 1 narrated the confrontation to the deceased. With the intention of

resolving the matter, stating “දේෙ දේරගනිමු”, the deceased took PW 1 and PW 2 in the

van towards Madina Kanda. They encountered the accused, namely Prisil, JVP Ajith,

Page 5 of 16

Sagara, Lal Roshan and Bindu, seated on a bridge along Madina Kanda road. The witness

pointed out the accused, stating that they were the individuals who had attacked them.

At that moment, the deceased alighted from the van and approached the accused. At that

moment, the 1st accused struck the deceased on the head with a Manna knife, and the

witness stated it as “ගැහුවා”.

Page 187 of the brief,

PW 1 then approached the accused and pleaded with them not to attack the deceased, and

after which the other accused attacked the deceased as he lay fallen. According to his

testimony, the Second Accused struck his right hand with a sword, while the Third

Accused attacked his left leg with a Manna knife. The Fourth Accused, armed with a pole,

assaulted him on the shoulder.

Page 6 of 16

Furthermore, the witness stated that the 5th, 6th, and 7th Accused also assaulted the

deceased with poles. Thereafter, PW 1 fled to a nearby house and concealed himself. The

1st Accused followed him there and demanded that he be sent out by attacking the

windows of the house. With the support of the residents of that house, PW 1 escaped

through the rear door and proceeded to the Payagala Police Station by three-wheeler,

where he was directed to the hospital. At the hospital, he learned that the deceased had

succumbed to his injuries on the fourth day in the hospital. The police had initially

recorded a short history from him while he was in the hospital, and following the death of

the deceased, PW 1 returned to the police and provided a statement.

During cross‑examination conducted by counsel for the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and

Sixth Accused, the witness stated that when the deceased arrived at PW 3’s house, he

disclosed the incident to the deceased. The witness further stated that although the

Fourth Accused’s house was located near PW 3’s residence, they did not go there. He added

that the deceased had instructed them to proceed and discuss the matter to settle the

dispute. The witness admitted the fact that they took 5 minutes to reach the Madina

Kanda bridge.

According to the witness, the deceased instructed him to remain in the van, stating that

he would go and settle the matter himself. Upon arriving at the place where the accused

were present, the witness pointed out the accused. It shows the fact that the witness knew

the accused who came to attack in the first incident. The witness further admitted that,

at the bridge, all of the accused were known to him. He stated that, following this, the

First Accused hit the deceased with a manna knife. The witness stated that Prisil and

Walle Ajith attacked with a sword, causing injuries to his right hand. Walle Ajith further

struck his left leg, while Lal assaulted him on the shoulder. Further confirmed that 10.00

a.m. at the time of the incident.

Additionally, the defence highlighted a contradiction in the witness testimony: while at

one point he had stated that two persons were involved, elsewhere he had asserted that

five unidentified individuals had attacked them at that time. The witness further stated

that the Fourth Accused struck him with a pole, while two other unknown individuals

attacked him later; he identified them as the 6th and the 7th accused. When the defence

suggested that the deceased had taken a weapon from the van and gone to attack the

accused, and that the witness was fabricating his account to conceal this fact, the witness

categorically denied the suggestion.

Page 7 of 16

The defence also suggested that a person named Charles had attacked the deceased and

that the witness had threatened the family of the Fifth Accused. The witness categorically

denied both suggestions. The witness testified that he did not proceed to the accused’s

residence, as the villagers had informed him that they had gone to Madina Kanda. The

defence then suggested that the Second Accused had lodged a complaint at the Payagala

Police Station around 10.45 a.m. The PW 2 has told the witness that the 2nd accused was

in the police station. The witness responded that he was unaware of such a complaint, but

later, PW 2 informed him of it while he was at the hospital.

PW 3, Benjamin Silva, testified that on 02.01.1996, he made a statement to the police. He

stated that he heard a quarrel taking place in front of his house between Shelton, who

lives in front of the house and Lokkaiya (PW 1) at around 12.00 p.m. It is noted that, in

this case, the individual in question is not an accused. Furthermore, the prosecution does

not regard this witness as an adverse witness.

PW 9, Dr Charles Chanaka Gunawardena, testified that he was serving at the Kalutara

Hospital at the relevant time. On 02.01.1996, PW 1 was admitted to the hospital, and he

examined the witness. According to the history provided, PW 1 stated that he had been

attacked on Payagala beach by Ajith, Lal, and Prisil. The doctor recorded six injuries in

total, identifying the first injury as grievous in nature.

PW 16, Judicial Medical Officer Dr Hadun Pathiranahalage Wijeratne, testified that the

post-mortem examination had been conducted by Dr B.P.P. Perera. When Dr Perera went

abroad, the reports were handed over to PW 16. He stated that the first injury was a fatal

injury, with a high probability of causing death, as it was inflicted on the head and

resulted in damage to the brain. He further explained that such an injury could have been

caused by a blunt weapon, such as a wooden pole.

Page 346 of the brief,

Page 8 of 16

The remaining injuries were classified as non-grievous.

During cross‑examination, the witness admitted that, apart from the first injury, there

was another wound on the neck, recorded as No. 14 in the post‑mortem report, which was

also classified as fatal. Furthermore, during examination‑in‑chief, the witness

acknowledged that there were no cutting injuries; however, he stated that such injuries

could have been caused by the blunt side of the sword.

PW 12, CI Amarakoon, was on duty on 02.01.1996 when Inoka, the sister was the second

accused informed him about a quarrel at the beach. Acting on this information, he

proceeded towards Mandina Kanda, where he found the deceased lying on the ground

near the Alabada Temple, where he was alive at that time. The deceased was thereafter

admitted to the Nagoda Hospital. Additionally, two bloodstains were observed in the

house of the first accused, which is situated in the vicinity.

PW 2, Rasika Nalaka Silva, testified that Prisil, the Second Accused, together with JVP

Ajith, Roshan, Bindu, Walle Ajith, Sagara, and Lal (now deceased), arrived and attempted

to attack PW 1. However, the sons of PW 3 intervened, settled the dispute, and escorted

PW 1 and PW 2 into the house. The witness stated that Prisil, the Second Accused, was

armed with a rod, while Roshan, the Seventh Accused, carried a knife. Initially, the others

did not possess any weapons. Subsequently, all the accused left the scene. Afterwards, the

deceased arrived and inquired about the incident. In an effort to resolve the matter, the

deceased took PW 1, PW 2, and the van driver to the Second Accused’s residence. Villagers

informed them that the accused had gone to Madina Kanda. Near the bridge at Madina

Kanda, all the accused were present. The van stopped near the bridge, and the deceased

instructed PW 1 to remain inside. The deceased then alighted and proceeded towards the

accused.

At that time, the witness, still inside the van, had seen that the First Accused was armed

with a Manna knife, while the Second Accused carried a sword. He confirmed with

certainty that the First Accused held a Manna knife and the Second Accused a sword,

while the remaining accused were armed with rods measuring approximately 2.5 to 3 feet

in length.

The deceased then approached the accused. At that moment, the First Accused struck the

deceased on the head with a Manna knife.

Page 10 of 16

Following this, the other accused also assaulted the deceased. When PW 1 alighted from

the van, the Second, Third, and Fourth Accused attacked him. The Second Accused struck

PW 1’s right elbow; the Fourth Accused assaulted his shoulder with a rod, and the Third

Accused attacked his left knee.

The witness stated that, at the time of the incident, he fled towards Galle Road, as he was

unfamiliar with any other escape route. He did not return to observe what transpired with

Page 11 of 16

the deceased or PW 1. Instead, he proceeded to the Payagala Police Station at

approximately 9:30 a.m. By that time, the police had informed the witness that they had

already arrived at the scene and subsequently went to the hospital at around 10:30 a.m.

Near the police station, the witness encountered PW 1, who was then taken to the hospital

for treatment.

Following this, the witness returned at approximately 1:00 p.m. to provide his statement.

When questioned, the witness stated that Lal and Prisil had attacked him and further

confirmed that Walle Ajith was also present.

Page 462 of the brief,

He further clarified that the deceased was his mother’s sister’s son, making him the

witness’s cousin. The defence suggested that the deceased was armed with a weapon when

he approached the accused after alighting from the van. The witness firmly denied this

suggestion. The witness stated that a police jeep arrived when they were near Meril’s

house, and the officers advised them to go home during the 1st incident. When the

deceased questioned the accused as to why they had assaulted his brother, the accused

immediately began to attack both the deceased and PW 1.

The witness asserted that Prisil, the Second Accused, Lal, the Fourth Accused, Walle Ajith,

and the Third Accused attacked PW 1. This line of cross‑examination was conducted by

counsel representing the First, Third, and Fifth Accused.

The following questions were asked by counsel for the 2nd Accused. The witness further

testified that when he was giving his police statement at around 1.30 p.m., the Second

Accused was present at the police station. The witness admitted that, together with

Officer Wagapitiya, he went to point out the houses of the accused. However, he stated

that he was familiar only with the residence of the Second Accused. It is noted that the

witness stated that the Second Accused was present at the police station.

It is observed that the sister of the Second Accused lodged a complaint with the police

concerning these witnesses. At that time, the Second Accused was not present in his house.

This indicates that the witness had gone in search of the Second Accused, who was also

identified as having participated in the first attack. The defence counsel suggested that

the Second Accused was not present at the time of the attack. The witness denied this

proposition and affirmed that the Second Accused had, in fact, assaulted both the

deceased and PW 1.

The witness consistently maintained that the deceased wished to meet with the accused

in order to settle the dispute, so that he could continue collecting shrimp along the beach.

Page 496 of the brief,

For the 6th and 7th accused, the defence marked an omission in the police statement on

02.01.1996, pointing out that the names of the 6th and the 7th accused were not

mentioned by the witness. Counsel established that the witness did not mention the Sixth

and Seventh Accused in connection with the attack. Further, another omission was

marked that the 6th and 7th accused were carrying rods.

Page 13 of 16

It should be noted that this witness failed to mention the names of the 6th and the 7th

accused in their police statements, and failed to describe their involvement in both attacks.

On that basis, they were acquitted by the Learned High Court Judge of all counts.

හඳුනා ගැනී ට ප්‍ර ාණවත් සාක්ි ඉදිරිපත් මනාවන මහයින් එකී 6 සහ 7 චුදිතයින් නිමදාස් මකාට නිසහස් කරමි.”

However, upon analysing the evidence of PW 2, it is observed that he remained consistent

in describing how the attack took place and in identifying the participation of the First,

Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Accused. It is acknowledged that the Second Accused

was present when the witness went to the police station. Nevertheless, the fact remains

that the incident occurred at approximately 10:00 a.m., and thereafter, efforts were made

to search the houses of the accused in order to locate him.

Upon conclusion of the prosecution, the defence was called, the First Accused stated that

he had not engaged in any quarrel on the day in question and didn't attack the deceased

or PW 1. He claimed that he had observed PW 1 and PW 2 fighting and had attempted to

intervene to resolve the dispute. After returning home, two groups of individuals allegedly

came to his residence and attacked the house. In response, he fled by jumping into the

lake situated behind his house. Thereafter, following a period of eighteen days, and with

the assistance of a lawyer, he went to the Payagala Police Station and made a statement.

But he has not stated any reason for the delay.

The Second Accused stated that on 29.12.1995, PW 1 and PW 2 had attacked the accused

with a boat paddle and thereafter, PW 3 intervened and resolved the matter. The accused

then returned to his house. Subsequently, the sister, Inoka, informed him that armed

individuals with swords had come to his residence. As a result, the accused left his house

and went to the Payagala Police Station at around 8:10 a.m. At that time, another group

of armed people arrived at the police station. The police confined him in a room for his

protection, where he remained in custody at the police station for two days. On 02 January

1996, a statement was recorded from him, after which he was produced before the courts.

According to the Third Accused, upon hearing that the police were searching for him, he

went to the police station 17 days later, where he received a notice from the police. He

further asserted that on the day in question, he was not in the area and was not involved

in the attack. During cross-examination, he stated that on 01.01.1996, he was at home

Page 14 of 16

when he got to know about the incident. He further testified that from 03.01.1996

onwards, he was in Marawila. He also admitted that he had failed to mention in his police

statement that he had gone to Marawila.

The Fifth Accused gave evidence in the witness box and stated that, upon the request of

the police, he had provided a statement. He further stated that he became aware of the

fight on the beach when he went there with the Third Accused to play cricket. After

returning home, a gang arrived and attacked the father of the deceased. Out of fear, he

left the house.

The principal objection advanced by the defence was that the deceased met his death as

a result of a blow from a blunt weapon to the head. According to the defence, PW 1 and

PW 2 alleged that the First Accused attacked the deceased with a Manna knife. The

defence contended that, had a manna knife been used, the deceased would have sustained

a cut injury. Significantly, both witnesses employed the word ගැහුවා. The medical evidence

clarified by the PW 16 is that such an injury could indeed have been inflicted by the blunt

side of a Manna knife. Both PW 1 and PW 2 consistently described how the First Accused

struck the deceased, causing him to fall to the ground, after which all of the other accused

joined in the assault. The testimony of PW 1 and PW 2 is consistent and mutually

corroborative.

We are mindful that soon after the incident, PW 2 ran to the police station, where he saw

the Second Accused. The police informed the witness that officers had already been

dispatched to the scene. This fact was confirmed by PW 12, C.A. Amarakoon. Thereafter,

PW 2 accompanied PW 1 and later returned to lodge a formal complaint with the police.

Upon analysing the evidence of PW 2, it is clear that his actions were spontaneous in

making the complaint. PW 2 correctly identified the incident, and his testimony was

corroborated by PW 1. Both witnesses stated that the deceased had gone to settle the

matter, as all parties were engaged in business at the beach. They further confirmed that

when the deceased alighted from the van, the First Accused attacked him with a manna

knife, and the other accused joined in the assault. PW 1, upon witnessing the attack, was

also assaulted. At that time, PW 2 remained inside the van, giving him a greater

opportunity to observe the attack than PW 1, who was himself under assault.

We note that there is no evidence to suggest that the deceased was armed with any

weapon. We are mindful that PW 12 observed two blood patches in front of the First

Accused’s house. According to PW 11, the only person arrested on that day was the Second

Page 15 of 16

Accused. The First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Accused surrendered to the court on

19.01.1996, eighteen days after the incident. The Sixth and Seventh Accused surrendered

on 18.03.1996. We note that the Learned High Court Judge correctly considered the

evidence presented by the accused.

There were three omissions in the witness’s statement regarding the Sixth and Seventh

Accused, as PW 2 did not mention their names. The Learned High Court Judge correctly

acquitted both of them on this basis. When we consider the evidence of PW 2, it is clear

that he was consistent and that there were no major discrepancies in his testimony. We

are mindful that PW 2 was an eyewitness to the incident that had seen the incident inside

the van, and that PW 1 was attacked by the accused and also observed the incident.

At the time of the incident, both witnesses observed what transpired, though their

positions were divergent. One witness directly saw the assault on the deceased, while PW

2 witnessed the incident from a different vantage point, as he was inside the van. These

differing perspectives were taken into account in the subsequent judgment.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753, wherein Indian Supreme

Court held as follows:

“By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo graphic memory and

to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the

mental screen.

Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The Witness could

not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The

mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to attuned to absorb the details.

The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice,

another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person’s

mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another.

Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of events

which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is liable to

get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on.”

It is true that certain discrepancies exist; however, they do not go to the root of the case.

We hold that both witnesses are credible, and the defence has not succeeded in shaking

their testimony during cross‑examination. Furthermore, we note the conduct of the First,

Page 16 of 16

Third, Fourth, and Fifth Accused in delaying their surrender to the police, which is a

matter to be considered. They have not provided any explanation as to why they were

hiding. The Learned High Court Judge considered this aspect correctly.

Upon careful consideration, we find that the prosecution established the case, beyond a

reasonable doubt, that the 1st, 2nd,3rd and 5th Appellants are guilty of all 5 counts in

the indictment.

In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the judgment together with the

sentencing order delivered by the Learned High Court Judge on 11.09.2023 and dismiss

the appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed.
