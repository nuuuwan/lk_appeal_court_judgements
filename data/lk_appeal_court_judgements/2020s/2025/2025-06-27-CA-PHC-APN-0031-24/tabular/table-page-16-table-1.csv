"48. In light of the matters discussed above it is the view of this Court that the"
"disputed order is untenable. The petitioner has successfully demonstrated"
"the existence of exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of"
"this  Court.  Therefore,  I  am  inclined  to  conclude  that  this  application  is"
"both appropriate and suitable for intervention."

"or authority to sign the affidavit submitted to Court alongside the instant"

"in the Anti-Corruption Act No. 9  of 2023,  particularly section 163(2)(h) of"
"the Act."
"50. Accordingly,  the  order  dated  May  19,  2023  of  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge of Colombo, is set aside as it cannot be allowed to stand."
"A
pplication is allowed."
"51. The  alleged  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  accused-respondent  is"
"hereby dismissed."
"52. The Learned High Court Judge is directed to revert the case back to the"
"trial roll of the Court, issue notice on the accused-respondent, read over"
