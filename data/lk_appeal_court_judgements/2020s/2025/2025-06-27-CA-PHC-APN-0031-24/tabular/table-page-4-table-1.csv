"6.  The  charges  in  the  indictment  states  that  the  accused-respondent"
"solicited and accepted money as a gratification from the person named"
"in  the  charges  to  prosecute  an  offender,  and  thereby,  committing"
"offences punishable under Sections 16 (b) and 19 (c) of the Bribery Act"
"No. 11 of 1954 as amended."
"7.  When the case before the High Court came up for trial on October 26,"
"2022,  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  accused-respondent  has  raised  a"
"preliminary  objection  regarding  the  sustainability  of  the  indictment"
"forwarded in that case."
"8.  The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has pronounced his order"
"on May 19, 2023, which is now being challenged before this Court."
"9.  The Learned High Court Judge has addressed the objection raised on"
"the  ground 
that  under 
the  provisions  of 
this  CIABOC  Act, 
the"
"Commission 
is 
required 
to 
investigate  allegations  of  Bribery  or"
"Corruption  communicated 
to 
it 
collectively.  Therefore,  since 
the"
"investigations  in  this  case  have  not  been  initiated  collectively,  the"
"indictment is rendered void ab initio."
"10. In  agreement  with  this  preliminary  objection,  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge has discharged the accused-respondent from the case, concluding"
"that  the  investigation  into  the  alleged  offences  have  not  been  initiated"
"collectively  by  the  Commission,  indicating  a  clear  lack  of  jurisdiction  in"
"this matter."
