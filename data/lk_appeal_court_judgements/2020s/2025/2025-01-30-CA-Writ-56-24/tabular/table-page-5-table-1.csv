"In Ariyarathne and others v Inspector General of Police and others (2019) 1 SLR 100, it"
"was stated that"
"“The doctrine of legitimate expectation envisages that a Court may, in appropriate"
"circumstances and where the public interest does not require otherwise, enforce a"
"""legitimate expectation""  (as  distinct  from  a  personal  or  proprietary  right)  of  a"
"person that a public authority will act as it has promised or held out. The doctrine"
"of legitimate expectation operates  where  an  aggrieved  person  does  not  have  a"
"proprietary  or  personal  right  stricto  sensu  which  gives  him  the  locus  standi  to"
"challenge a decision of a public authority under the other grounds recognised by"
"administrative law.”"
"It was further held that:"
"“A mere wish, a desire or a hope cannot found a legitimate expectation which will"
"be protected by the Court. The petitioners had at best a wish, a desire or a hope ..."
"That does not help the petitioners to establish the substantive legitimate expectation"
"they claim in this case.”"
