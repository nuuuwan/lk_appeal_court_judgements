"standi succeeds. In coming to this conclusion, this Court has considered the decisions in"
"Ariyarathne and others v Inspector General of Police and others (supra) where it was"
"stated that:"
"“With regard to locus standi, the doctrine of legitimate expectation operates where"
"an  aggrieved  person  does  not  have  a  proprietary  or  personal  right  stricto  sensu"
"which gives him the locus standi to challenge a decision of a public authority under"
"the other grounds recognized by administrative law. In such situations the doctrine"
"operates to confer locus standi to an aggrieved person to seek judicial review where"
"he only has a ‘legitimate expectation’ that a public authority will act in a particular"
"way. Thus in O’Reilly v Mackman, Lord Diplock said that in public law a person"
"who held a legitimate expectation had ‘sufficient interest’ to challenge the legality"
"of a public authority’s decision.”"
