"Commissioner, where the sender has stated that if the corpus is not marked for any other"
"project, to consider whether it can be given on lease to the Petitioner. This letter too has"
"not been addressed to the Petitioner. In the said circumstances it is observed that there is"
"no  direct  representation  made  to  the  Petitioner  pertaining  to  his  request  for  a  long-term"
"lease. Further, both letters do not state to grant the Petitioner with a long-term lease, while"
"the Land Commissioner’s letter makes a request to the Divisional Secretary to consider the"
"Petitioner’s  request,  the  said  letter  is  conditional  as  it  says  if  the  said  corpus  is  not"
"earmarked for any other project, the Divisional Secretary is to look into it. Even the District"
"Secretary’s letter only states to consider the request and take appropriate action. Hence, in"
"my view both these letters cannot generate a  legitimate expectation  in the  Petitioner, to"
"obtain a lease. The learned State Counsel in reply to these letters contended that the said"
"land is marked for village expansion and the said decision has been taken in the 1980s. As"
"there was a disturbance in the said area, the decision had not been implemented. However,"
"now they are in the process of implementing the said decision and for the said purposes the"
"Divisional Secretary had sent the quit notices to the unlawful occupants of the land."
