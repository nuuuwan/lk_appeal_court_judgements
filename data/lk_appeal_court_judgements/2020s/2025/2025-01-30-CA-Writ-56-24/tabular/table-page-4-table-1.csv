"Petitioner before this Court that this land is State land, this Court will not venture into the"
"said provision."
"In view of the said admission the parties are not on variance as to the Respondents’ position"
"that the land is a  State land. Hence, it is  an admitted fact. Petitioner contends that after"
"purchasing the said land by the document marked as P1, he had had employed people and"
"cultivated a mango cultivation, and the said cultivation had started yielding fruits in 2023."
"He further submits that once the quit notice was received, he had several correspondences"
"with state authorities to obtain a long lease for the said land in the extent of 8 Acres 2 Roods"
"36.67  Perches.  Petitioner  contends  that  he  had  been  sent  two  replies  from  the  District"
"Secretary and the Land Commissioner pertaining to his request for leasing of the corpus"
"and therefore, he contends that he had a legitimate expectation of entering into a lease with"
"the  State.  Let  me  first  analyze  the  Petitioner’s  contention  of  obtaining  a  lease  and  his"
"contention that he had a legitimate expectation of obtaining the same."
