"On  27.12.2017, 
the  Petitioner  had  been  present 
for  the 
inquiry  as"
"previously scheduled. However, no inquiry had been held on 27.12.2017"
"as scheduled. In the circumstances, on the very same date, the Petitioner"
"had submitted a letter [P35] requesting the 2nd Respondent to set aside"
"his  decision  dated  21.12.2017  [P33]  and  to  proceed  with  the 
inquiry"
"which was not concluded and postponed to 27.12.2017 as per Section 91"
"of the Agrarian Development Act."
"On 04.02.2018 [P38], the O.I.C. of the Ambalantota Police Station  again"
"directed  both 
the  Petitioner  and 
the  5th  Respondent 
to 
the  2nd"
"Respondent owing to a dispute that had arisen between them. The O.I.C."
"had noted that there is a previous directive from the 2nd Respondent to"
"the Petitioner not to interfere with the 5th Respondent’s cultivation rights"
"on the paddy land known as Julangahawattha, as indicated in letter P33."
"Additionally, there had been a letter informing the Petitioner to deposit"

land  called  Ambarangewattha  at  the  Agrarian"
"Development  Council  of  Lunama  until  the  landlord  is  clearly  identified."
"However, 
there  remains  a 
lack  of  clarity  regarding 
the  property

"question."
"Following the O.I.C.'s aforesaid communication and pursuant to extensive"
"discussions  with  the parties,  the  2nd  Respondent  had  concluded  that  no"
"further  directions  should  be  given  to  the  Police  and  that  the  decision"
"previously made would stand [P40]. Thereafter, on or about 30.04.2018,"
"the  officers  of  the  Ambalantota  Police  arrested  the  Petitioner  alleging"
"that 
the  Petitioner  had  acted 
in  violation  of 
the  order  of 
the  2nd"
"Respondent dated 21.12.2017 and had released the Petitioner on police"
"bail warning the Petitioner not to enter the paddy land belonging to the"
"5th Respondent. Afterwards, the 5th Respondent came into to possession"
"of the paddy land."
"In the instant application, the Petitioner challenges the decision of the 2nd"
