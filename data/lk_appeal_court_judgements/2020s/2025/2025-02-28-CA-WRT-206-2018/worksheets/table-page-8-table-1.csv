"02.11.2017, the inquiry had been held ex parte against the Petitioner, as"
"the Petitioner had been absent on the said date as well. The proceedings"
"[P32] provide that the notice served on the Petitioner by the Registered"
"Post  was  not 
returned.  However, 
the  Respondents  have 
failed 
to"
"substantiate  their  position  with  proof  of  dispatch  of  the  notice  on  the"
"Petitioner to the satisfaction of the Court."
"The decision to entertain another identical application while one inquiry"
"was  pending  for  the  same  purpose  is  questionable.  It  appears  that  if"
"there  had  been  any  genuine  necessity  or  urgency,  the  5th  Respondent"
"would have taken steps to expedite the inquiry which was already fixed"
"for inquiry. It is important to note that the time limit between the date of"
"the  inquiry  held  (02.11.2017)  and  the  date  of  the  inquiry  to  be  held"
"(27.12.2017) is also not so extensive."
"The Court observes that the second inquiry which was initiated based on"
"application  P29  made  by  the  5th  Respondent  has  also  been  given  the"
"same reference number i.e. HA/4/පරීක්ෂණ/2017/02 which was given to"
"the  previous 
(pending) 
inquiry  which  was  due 
to  be 
taken  up  on"
"27.12.2017.[  see  documents  marked  P30,  P31A  and  P33].  Such  action"
"specifically  shows  knowledge  of 
the  Assistant  Commissioner  of 
the"
"existing inquiry scheduled to be on 27.12.2017. Aforesaid conduct of the"
"inquiring officer shows the improper procedure adopted by the inquiring"
"officers with regard to the impugned inquiry."
"I am taken by surprise by the failure to disclose or take into consideration"
"the fact that there is a pending inquiry to be held on 27.12.2017 by the"
"Assistant Commissioner before making any order at the second inquiry. If"
"such  a  fact  had  been  taken 
into  account,  no  reasonable  or  sensible"
"person  would  have  decided 
to  hold  an 
inquiry 
in  advance  without"
"justifying  such  a  decision  to  hold  the 
inquiry 
in  advance.  No  reason"
"whatsoever  was  given 
in  order 
to 
justify 
the  actions  of 
the 
said"
"Respondents to expedite the inquiry while another inquiry was pending in"
"respect of the same matter."
"As  the  Petitioner  was  aware  that  the  initial  inquiry  was  scheduled  for"
"27.12.2017, he had a legitimate expectation to proceed with such inquiry"
"as scheduled. It is observed that the Petitioner had been deprived of such"
"opportunity to be heard as the matter had been concluded in advance by"
"an  order  dated  21.12.2017  marked  P33  without  the  knowledge  of  the"
"Petitioner. The application [P35] to set aside the order dated 21.12.2017"
