"purported  ex  parte 
inquiry  during 
the  meantime  and 
to  evict 
the"
"Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  further  states  that  the  decision  of  the  2nd"
"Respondent 
is 
illegal,  arbitrary,  unreasonable, 
irrational,  and 
is 
in"
"frustration of the Petitioner’s legitimate expectations."
"After  careful  perusal  of  proceedings  before  the  Assistant  Commissioner"
"of Agrarian Development, this Court observes that there had been three"
"applications 
[P16,  P24,  and  P29]  made  under  Section  90(1)  of 
the"
"Agrarian  Development  Act  to  determine  the  rightful 
landlord  of  the"
"paddy  land  in  issue.  The  application  (first)  made  by  the  Petitioner  by"
"letter P16, and the application (second) dated 28.04.2017 [P24] made by"
"the  5th  Respondent  were  taken  up  for  inquiry  together  on  03.05.2017"
"[see  the  annotation  made  on  P24].  Both  the  Petitioner  and  the  5th"
"Respondents  had  been  present  on  that  day.  However,  the  inquiry  had"
"been postponed to 31.05.2017, in order to facilitate the request of the 5th"
"Respondent  seeking  time  to  obtain  legal  assistance.  On  that  day,  the"
"matter 
had 
been 
called 
for 
inquiry 
under 
“Inquiry 
No."
"HA/4//පරීක්ෂණ/2017/02” 
and 
the 
same 
had 
been 
postponed 
to"
"27.09.2017 as the 5th Respondent was absent [P26].  On 27.09.2017, yet"
"again the matter had been postponed to 27.12.2017 in the presence of"
"both  parties 
[P28].  As  the 
inquiry  was 
fixed 
for  27.12.2017  by  the"
"Assistant Commissioner in the presence of all parties, the parties and the"
"Assistant  Commissioner  of  Agrarian  Development  are  estopped  from"
"denying  the  knowledge  of  the  fact  that  the  inquiry  was  fixed  for  such"
"date."
"It 
is  observed 
that  while 
the  above 
inquiry  was  pending, 
the  5th"
"Respondent had made another application [P29] seeking an order under"
"Section  90(1)  of 
the  Agrarian  Development  Act.  Under 
the 
said"
"application,  the  5th  Respondent  had  sought  the  same  relief  as  she  had"
"sought in her earlier application [P24], specifically an order to protect her"
"cultivation rights. The Court observes that on the face of document P29"
"for  an  unknown  reason  said  application  has  been  named  “urgent.”"
"However, the reasons for such urgency have not been specified therein"
"nor has it been substantiated with evidence."
"Thereafter, by the letter dated 17.10.2017, [P30] the Petitioner and the"
"5th  Respondent  had  been  noticed  to  appear  on  20.10.2017  for  inquiry."
"When  the  matter  was  taken  up  on  20.10.2017,  it  had  been  fixed  to  be"
"called  again  on  02.11.2017  as  the  Petitioner  was  absent 
[P31].  On"
