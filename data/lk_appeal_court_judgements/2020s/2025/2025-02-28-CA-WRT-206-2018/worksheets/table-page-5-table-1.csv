"Petitioner was referred to as the Respondent and the 5th Respondent was"
"referred to as the Complainant at the said inquiry. When the matter was"
"taken up for inquiry on 31.05.2017, the 5th Respondent had been absent,"
"and  the  matter  had  been  refixed  for  inquiry  on  27.09.2017.  As  per  the"
"proceedings  dated  31.05.2017[P26],  the 
inquiry  had  been  given  the"
"reference  number  HA/4/පරීක්ෂණ/2017/02.  Again  on  27.09.2017,  the"
"inquiry  had  been  postponed  to  27.12.  2017  as  the  5th  Respondent  had"
"sought further time to obtain legal assistance [P28]."
"As  the  matters  remained  as  such  and  knowingly  the  inquiry  is  fixed  for"
"27.12.2017,  the  5th  Respondent  had  submitted  another  request  dated"
"09.10.2017  [P29]  seeking  an  order  under  Section  90(1)  of  the  Agrarian"
"Development  Act  moving  that  her  cultivator  rights  are  not  disturbed."
"Thereafter,  the  3rd  Respondent  had  called  the  Petitioner  and  the  5th"
"Respondent  for  an  inquiry  on  20.10.  2017  by  letter  marked  P30  at  the"
"undated  request  of  the  5th  Respondent  under  Section  90(1)  of  the"
"Agrarian Development Act. However, it is important to note that the said"
"letter 
P30 
also 
specifies 
its 
reference 
number 
as 
“My 
No."
"HA/04/පරීක්ෂණ/2017/02” which is the same reference number given to"
"the existing inquiry [P28] before the 3rd Respondent. It is further apparent"
"that  the  matter  had  been  called  for  an  inquiry  on  three  dates  after  the"
"date of the letter marked P30. Petitioner claims that knowing the inquiry"
"was  already 
fixed 
for  27.12.2017  and  without  anticipating 
that 
the"
"Petitioner  would  be  summoned  for  an 
inquiry 
in  the  meantime,  the"
"Petitioner  was  at  his  daughter's  place  receiving  medical 
treatments"
"during such time where the inquiry in issue had been held without notice"
"to  the  Petitioner.  Consequently,  the  inquiry  which  had  been  fixed  for"
"20.10.2017  has  been  postponed  to  02.11.2017  in  the  absence  of  the"
"Petitioner  [P31]  and  a 
letter  with  an 
incomplete  date 
i.e.  …10.2017"
"[P31A] has been sent to the Petitioner requiring him to be present at the"
"inquiry  on  02.11.2017.  Furthermore,  it  is  observed  that  the  letter  P31A"
"also bears the above reference number “HA/04/පරීක්ෂණ/2017/02.”  The"
"Petitioner states that he received the letter P31A only a few dates after"
"02.11.2017. However, on 02.11.2017 inquiry had been held without the"
"participation of the Petitioner. Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent informed"
"his decision, in terms of Section 90(1) of the Agrarian Development Act to"
"the  Petitioner  and  directed  the  Petitioner  not  to 
interfere  with  the"
"cultivation  rights  of  the  5th  Respondent  by  the  letter  dated  21.12.2017"
