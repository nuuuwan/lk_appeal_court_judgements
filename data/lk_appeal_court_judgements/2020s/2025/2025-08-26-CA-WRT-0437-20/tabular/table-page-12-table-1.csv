"The  above principles governing  the  issue of  a  writ of Mandamus"
"were  also  discussed  at  length  in  P.K.  Benarji  v.  H.J.  Simonds."
"Whether the facts show the existence of any or all pre-requisites to"
"the  granting  of  the  writ  is  a  question  of  law  in  each  case  to  be"
"decided  not  in  any  rigid  or  technical  view  of  the  question,  but"
"according to a sound and reasonable interpretation. The court will"
"not  grant  a  Mandamus  to  enforce  a  right  not  of  a  legal  but  of  a"
"purely  equitable  nature  however  extreme  the  inconvenience  to"
"which the applicant might be put.‚Äù (emphasis added)."
