"With the above judgments, this Court can come to the conclusion that the Judge"
"has very wide powers of asking any question at any time, but the questions should"
"not prejudice the accused person who has not had the benefit of a fair trial."
"We are also mindful that our Courts have considered that there is a duty cast on"
"the Judge to clear any doubt. Further, questions put by him aim to discover proper"
"proof of relevant facts. The Judge has the power to intervene at any time by way"
"of questions if he thinks it necessary to clear any doubts and he might ask further"
"questions into the matters that he deems important. By putting a question, the"
"Judge can observe their demeanor and form an opinion on whether the evidence"
"is  truthful  in  their  testimony  on  the  vital  matters.  However,  that  intervention"
"should not be for one side. It should be fair to both sides. Further, the judge should"
"avoid repetition. The main purpose of questioning is to clear the doubts and make"
"up his mind where the truth lies."
"Generally, our courts have held that the questions put forward by the judge should"
"not be unfavorable to the Accused. At the end of the day, the Judge has to come to"
"a conclusion whether the evidence placed was sufficient to prove the case."
"In his written submission filed on 04.04.2025, the Accused has stated that the trial"
"Judge  himself  asked  a  series  of  questions  regarding  the  identification  of  the"
"Accused."
"When we peruse the evidence led on 19.09.2019, one of the questions asked by the"
"Court  is  that  (on  page  95  of  the  brief),  “මෙත්තය එො ගිහිල්ල  ෙම්බවුන නිලධාරියා කව්ෙ"
"කියල මතකෙ නම?”. We observe that, when this question was asked, the witness had"
"already  mentioned  the  name  of  the  Accused.  Further,  the  Judge  had  asked"
"questions about the place where the Accused and PW1 met. Another question was"
"asked regarding Denzil after the witness informed the Court about him."
"When we observe the questions asked by the Court, nothing new was revealed by"
"the  witness  by  answering  such  questions.  In  my  opinion,  those  questions  could"
"have been avoided as those did not have any impact on the prosecution witnesses."
"We are also mindful that there were no leading questions asked by the Learned"
