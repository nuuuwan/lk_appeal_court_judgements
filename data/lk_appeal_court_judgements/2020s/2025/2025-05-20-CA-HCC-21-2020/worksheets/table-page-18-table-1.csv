"Judge  favouring  the  Prosecution.  The  Counsel  for  the  accused  had  failed  to"
"establish that the questions asked by the Learned Trial Judge put the Accused in"
"an  unfavorable  position.  On  the  other  hand,  that  he  favours  the  prosecution  to"
"prove the guilt. I must say that most of the questions asked by the Learned Judge"
"were repetitive and those could have been avoided. I hold that the questions asked"
"by the Learned High Court Judge do not prejudice the Accused."
"We further hold that the line of questioning adopted by the Learned High Court"
"Judge  indicates  that  either  the  witness  had  misunderstood  the  question  put"
"forward by the Prosecution Counsel, or that he needed a clear picture to ascertain"
"the truth for him to come to a conclusion."
"We  hold  that  although  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  raised  several"
"questions, those questions do not create any doubt that the Accused was not given"
"a fair trial."
"We are mindful of Article 138 (1) of the Constitution, which reads as follows;"
