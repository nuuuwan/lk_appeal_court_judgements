"have evolved in this country, the judge sits to hear and determine the issues"
"raised  by  the  parties,  not  to  conduct  an  investigation  or  examination  on"
"behalf of society at large, as happens, we believe, in some foreign countries."
"Even  in  England,  however,  a  judge  is  not  a  mere  umpire  to  answer  the"
"question "" How's that?"" His object, above all, is to find out the truth, and to"
"do justice according to law; and in the daily pursuit of it the advocate plays"
"an honourable and necessary role. Was it not Lord Eldon L.C. who said in a"
"notable passage that ""truth is best discovered by powerful "" statements on"
"both sides of the question""?: see Ex parte Lloyd.  And Lord Greene M.R. who"
"explained that justice is best done by a judge who holds the balance between"
"the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations? If"
"a  judge,  said  Lord  Greene,  should  himself  conduct  the  examination  of"
"witnesses,      "" he, so to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have"
"his vision clouded by the dust of conflict"" see Yuill v. Yuill."
"Yes, he must keep his vision unclouded. It is all very well to paint justice"
"blind, but she does better without a bandage round her eyes. She should be"
"blind indeed to favour or prejudice, but clear to see which way lies the truth:"
"and the less dust there is about the better. Let the advocates one after the"
"other put the weights into the scales-the "" nicely calculated less or more ""-"
"but the judge at the end decides which way the balance tilts, be it ever so"
"slightly.  So  firmly  is  all  this  established  in  our  law  that  the  judge  is  not"
"allowed  in  a  civil  dispute  to  call  a  witness  whom  he  thinks  might  throw"
"some light on the facts. He must rest content with the witnesses called by"
"the  parties:  see  In  re  Enoch  &  Zaretzky,  Bock  &  Co.  So  also  it  is  for  the"
"advocates, each in his turn, to examine the witnesses, and not for the judge"
"to  take it  on himself  lest by  so doing  he appear  to  favour  one  side  or  the"
"other:  see  Rex  v.  Cain,  Rex  v.  Bateman,  and  Harris v.  Harris,  by  Birkett"
"L.J.  especially.  And  it  is  for  the  advocate  to  state  his  case  as  fairly  and"
"strongly  as  he  can,  without  undue  interruption,  lest  the  sequence  of  his"
"argument  be  lost:  see  Reg.  V.  Clewer.  The  judge's  part  in  all  this  is  to"
"hearken to the evidence, only himself asking questions of witnesses when it"
"is necessary to clear up any point that has been overlooked or left obscure;"
