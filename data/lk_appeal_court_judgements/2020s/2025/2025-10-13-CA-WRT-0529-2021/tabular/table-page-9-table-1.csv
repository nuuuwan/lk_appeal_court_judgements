"I need not labour any further on this issue that the preclusive clause in"
"Article  61A  prevents 
this  court 
from  considering 
the  validity  or"
"adjudicating upon the impugned transfer made by P-30."
"10. Mr.  Ganesharajan  strenuously  argued  that  he  is  entitled  to  maintain"
"this application against P-3, as he instituted this application prior to the"
"ratification  and  covering  approval  was  granted.  The 
fallacy  of  this"
"argument is that with the ratification of P-3 by the PSC, the decision to"
"transfer becomes one that is made by, or by the authority of, the PSC."
"The  action  being  instituted  at  an  anterior  point  of  time  makes  no"
"difference to the legal effect. Further thereto, in the context of the current"
"application,  the  petitioner  is  now  proceeding  on  the  second  amended"
"petition,  dated  31.08.2022.  This  amended  petition  is  well  after  the"
"ratification,  and  also, 
the  said  ratification  made  by  P-30 
is  also"
"challenged.  Prayers  (g),  (h),  (i),  and  (j)  are  all  in  respect  of  substantive"
"relief  by  way  of  certiorari  and  prohibition  as  well  as  interim  orders  in"
"respect  of  P-30.  That  being  so, 
the  argument  advanced  by  Mr."
"Ganesharajan  is  misconceived.  Once  an  application  for  amending  a"
"petition is made and allowed, thereonwards the matter will proceed on"
"the petition as amended. The petitioner has amended the petition after"
"the  issuance  of  P-30  and  added  the  said  document,  P-30,  and  is  now"
"seeking specific relief by way of writ against the same. In this context,"
"Article 61A is directly attracted, relevant, and applicable."
"11. In  the  above  circumstances, 
I  am  more  than  convinced  that  the"
"petitioners by this application, based on the second amended petition,"
"is  in  fact  and  in  effect  challenging  the  said  decision  P-30  of  the  PSC,"
"which this Court is well and truly precluded from considering. This is so"
"held by Justice Marsoof in Ratnasiri vs. Ellawala (supra), and the law"
"is  now  settled.  In  these  circumstances,  I  uphold  the  argument  of  the"
"learned  State  Counsel  and  find  that,  as  this  Court  is  precluded  from"
"taking  cognizance  of  this  application,  the  petitioner  cannot  have  and"
