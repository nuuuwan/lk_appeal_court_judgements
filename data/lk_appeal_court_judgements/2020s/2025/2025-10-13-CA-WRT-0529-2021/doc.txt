JUDGEMENT

K. M. G. H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioner is seeking to challenge his transfer effected by P-3, dated

09.08.2021. At the point of the impugned transfer, the petitioner had

been serving as the Divisional Secretary of Vakarai, Koralaipattu North.

He had been transferred to the Ministry of Public Administration,

Provincial Councils and Local Government with immediate effect. This

transfer had been effected by the Secretary of the Ministry, in

accordance with Regulation 222 (iii) of the Procedural Rules of the

Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as “the PSC”),

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1589/30 of 20.02.2009,

subject to the covering approval of the PSC.

WRT/0529/21

Page 4 of 10

2. Upon being so transferred, the petitioner instituted this application

initially, by petition dated 23.10.2021. Subsequently, the said petition

was amended by the amended petition dated 19.11.2021. That being

so, the matter was to be supported with direct notice to the

respondents, and the 1st – 5th respondents have, on 14.03.2022,

tendered a limited statement of objections objecting to the granting of

notices and the issue of interim relief. It is relevant to note that though

the Rules do not specifically provide for applications to file such limited

objections prior to support and issuing of formal notices, subject to the

discretion of court, it is sometimes allowed.

3. That being so, the respondents, with their limited objections, tendered

documents R-1 to R-5, of which R-4 was the covering approval (dated

07.12.2021) issued by the PSC, whereby the approval sought by P-3

had been granted. Then, the matter was set for support on 17.05.2022.

The petitioner sought to once again amend the petition to add the PSC

as a party to the same and has been refixed for support. On 02.08.2022,

the learned President’s Counsel appearing for the petitioner has moved

for further time to file the amended petition. Accordingly, the matter

was rescheduled to be supported on 07.10.2022. Accordingly, the

second amended petition had been filed, and the letter of covering

approval of the PSC, R-4, has also been annexed and marked P-30 to

the second amended petition, whilst naming the members of the PSC

as party respondents. Correspondingly, the petitioners had added

further prayers (g), (h), (i), and (j), seeking writs of certiorari, prohibition,

and interim relief against the said letter P-30. It is the application based

on this second amended petition that has been supported on

03.11.2022. At the point of supporting, the learned President’s Counsel,

Mr. Geoffrey Alagaratnam, has informed that “the petitioner is only

challenging the decision P-3, and the additional secretary had no

authority or power to take such a decision even subject to the approval

of the PSC.” The 1st – 6th respondents have filed their objections on

WRT/0529/21

Page 5 of 10

26.05.2023. The respondents have, inter alia, raised the objection based

on the ouster clause incorporated in Article 61A of the Constitution.

4. This matter was accordingly taken up for argument on 25.09.2025.

When it was so taken up for argument, the main argument of Mr.

Ganesharajan, the Senior Counsel for the petitioner, was that the

Secretary of the said Ministry did not have the power or authority to

issue the letter of transfer P-3, and also that there were no reasons

assigned on the face of it, except the reference to Regulation 222 (iii) of

the Procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission. It was his

argument that the ouster clause in Article 61A has no application

because the petitioner is challenging the procedure and the authority

of the Secretary to issue the said letter in that form. It is his position

that the purported covering approval had been sought almost 3 months

after the issue of letter P-3, and thus, the petitioner is entitled to

challenge the said letter P-3 in this Court, notwithstanding the ouster

clause. He also laid emphasis on the fact that this application was

initially instituted on 23.10.2021, well before the granting of the said

purported covering sanction by P-30.

5. On this issue of law, the argument advanced by State Counsel Mr.

Aluwihare is that issuing of letters of transfer subject to covering

approval of the PSC is regular and is a practice more often than not

resorted to and followed in the public service, especially when urgency

and expediency of the circumstances so demand. It was argued that

with the issuing of covering approval, the said letter of transfer and the

transfer so effected for all purposes becomes the act and deed of the

PSC, and the ouster clause thus comes into play. In support of this, he

relied on Ratnasiri and others vs. Ellawala and others [2004] 2 Sri

L.R 180. As this legal issue could determine this application, I would,

at the outset, consider the same.

6. The regularity of the secretary of the Ministry issuing P-3 and the

legality thereof were seriously assailed by Mr. Ganesharajan. However,

it is apparent that by virtue of PSC Circular No. 05 of 2011 (R-10), there

WRT/0529/21

Page 6 of 10

is a general delegation of powers for administrative purposes provided

for. The said Circular provides:

“රාජ්‍ය සසේවා ස ාමිෂන් සභාසේ නිශ්ේිත බලතල අවසේථාසවෝිත පරිදි අමාතයාාංශ් සේ ම්වරුන්ට සහ සෙපාර්තසම්න්ු ප්‍රධානීන්ට පවරනු ලැබ ඇති 2011 ස ාවැම්බර් 25 ොතමින් යුත් අාං : 1733/52 ෙරණ ගැසට් නිසේෙ යට ඔසේ අවධා ය සයාමු රනු ලැසේ.”

The power of transfer concerning the petitioner, who is an SLAAS

officer, comes within the PSC. By virtue of the aforesaid Circular No.

05/2011 dated 13.12.2011 and letter R-11 dated 15.07.2021, such

powers of transfer of the PSC had been transferred to an Additional

Secretary of the Ministry nominated by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Public Administration and approved by the PSC. Accordingly, the PSC

authorises certain Additional Secretaries to exercise such functions

accordingly. It is based on this power of authorisation that the

Additional Secretary had issued P-3, subject however to the covering

approval of the PSC. The PSC has granted the covering approval by R-

4, dated 07.12.2021. In these circumstances, the process and

procedure followed in effecting the transfer is lawful and legitimate.

7. The practice of making decisions subject to covering approval is

certainly not a novelty and is a practice often resorted to. In respect of

matters coming under the PSC, the said practice and procedure has

been legitimised and regularised by the aforesaid Circulars. The

legitimacy of this practice, generally adopted in the public service, was

considered by U. de Z. Gunawardana, J., in Gunaratne vs.

Chandrananda de Silva [1998] 3 Sri L R 265, where his Lordship, at

page 282, observed that:

“It is worth recalling the solitary argument put forward on behalf the respondent viz. that as the Public Service Commission had “granted its approval” to the decision made by the respondent by the date that the letter P1 was, in fact, served on the petitioner - the Public Service Commission must be deemed, if not, held to have ratified the impugned decision made by the respondent. At any rate, the Public Service Commission could not, in law, “grant

WRT/0529/21

Page 7 of 10

approval” and so ratify or impart validity and efficacy to the decision of the respondent, reasons being at least four-fold:

(i) it is an inflexible and deep-rooted principle of law, which is as elementary as it is well-known, that no act or decision which is void at its inception, as is the decision of the respondent, can ever be ratified vide Halsbury's Laws of England (4th edition, vol. 01), page 452. In Brook vs. Hook, Kelly C. B. said thus: ‘...that although a voidable act may be ratified by matter subsequent it is otherwise when an act is originally and in its inception void,’

(ii) another principle which is as basic as it is rudimentary is embedded in the maxim: delegatus non protest delegare which means that a statutory power must be exercised only by the body or officer in whom it has been reposed or confided-unless sub delegation of the power is authorized by express words or necessary implication. This principle has been recognized to some extent, if not wholly, in article 58(1) of our constitution in the following terms: ‘The Public Service Commission or any committee thereof may delegate to a public officer, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the cabinet of Ministers, its powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal or disciplinary control of any category of public officers.’”

8. According to the above, even when formal delegation and/or

authorisation may not be provided, subsequent ratification, either

principal authority vested with such power in appropriate

circumstances, may ratify an order made and action taken by such

other public officer. To that extent, the argument of Mr. Ganesharajan

does not appeal to me as being tenable. Further, I also observe that

Marsoof, P.C., J., P/CA (as he then was), in Ratnasiri vs. Ellawala

(supra), considered a similar matter and approved the aforesaid dicta

of Gunawardana, J.

9. The next argument is the effect and import of the preclusive clause

incorporated in Article 61A, which provides thus:

WRT/0529/21

Page 8 of 10

“61A. [Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126], no court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made by the Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under any other law.” For all purposes, with the issue of P-30, the transfer is one made by the

PSC. That is common ground. If that be so, this Court is precluded by

virtue of Article 61A from considering the vires or validity of a decision

made by the PSC. The remedy is to make an appeal to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal as provided for by Article 59. Once

again, Justice Marsoof, in Ratnasiri vs. Ellawala (supra), has

considered this very issue extensively and held thus:

“…while the Public Service Commission is empowered to delegate to a Committee or a public officer its powers of appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of specified categories of public officers, it is expressly provided that any public officer aggrieved by an order made by any such Committee or public officer may appeal first to the Public Service Commission and from there to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which is appointed by the Judicial Service Commission. All this is in addition to the beneficial jurisdiction created by Article 126 of the Constitution which is expressly retained by Article 61A of the Constitution. These are the many pillars on which the edifice of the Public Service rests” (at page 190). “While I am inclined to the view that the Public Service Commission as well as a Committee of the Commission or a public officer exercising delegated authority may in appropriate circumstances ratify an order made or action taken by a public officer without authority, I also consider in the context of the present case that there is nothing in the Constitution or any law to prevent the 4th respondent from making a decision in regard to a matter where some person or body of persons has previously made some decision without any authority to do so” (at page 206).

WRT/0529/21

Page 9 of 10

I need not labour any further on this issue that the preclusive clause in

Article 61A prevents this court from considering the validity or

adjudicating upon the impugned transfer made by P-30.

10. Mr. Ganesharajan strenuously argued that he is entitled to maintain

this application against P-3, as he instituted this application prior to the

ratification and covering approval was granted. The fallacy of this

argument is that with the ratification of P-3 by the PSC, the decision to

transfer becomes one that is made by, or by the authority of, the PSC.

The action being instituted at an anterior point of time makes no

difference to the legal effect. Further thereto, in the context of the current

application, the petitioner is now proceeding on the second amended

petition, dated 31.08.2022. This amended petition is well after the

ratification, and also, the said ratification made by P-30 is also

challenged. Prayers (g), (h), (i), and (j) are all in respect of substantive

relief by way of certiorari and prohibition as well as interim orders in

respect of P-30. That being so, the argument advanced by Mr.

Ganesharajan is misconceived. Once an application for amending a

petition is made and allowed, thereonwards the matter will proceed on

the petition as amended. The petitioner has amended the petition after

the issuance of P-30 and added the said document, P-30, and is now

seeking specific relief by way of writ against the same. In this context,

Article 61A is directly attracted, relevant, and applicable.

11. In the above circumstances, I am more than convinced that the

petitioners by this application, based on the second amended petition,

is in fact and in effect challenging the said decision P-30 of the PSC,

which this Court is well and truly precluded from considering. This is so

held by Justice Marsoof in Ratnasiri vs. Ellawala (supra), and the law

is now settled. In these circumstances, I uphold the argument of the

learned State Counsel and find that, as this Court is precluded from

taking cognizance of this application, the petitioner cannot have and

WRT/0529/21

Page 10 of 10

maintain this application as it is presently constituted, in view of the

provisions of Article 61A of the Constitution.

12. Accordingly, this application is rejected and dismissed. However, I make

no order as to costs.

Application dismissed.
