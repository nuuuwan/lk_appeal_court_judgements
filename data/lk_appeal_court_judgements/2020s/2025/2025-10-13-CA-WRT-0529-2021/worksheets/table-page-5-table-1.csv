"26.05.2023. The respondents have, inter alia, raised the objection based"
"on the ouster clause incorporated in Article 61A of the Constitution."
"4.  This  matter  was  accordingly  taken  up  for  argument  on  25.09.2025."
"When  it  was  so  taken  up  for  argument,  the  main  argument  of  Mr."
"Ganesharajan,  the  Senior  Counsel  for  the  petitioner,  was  that  the"
"Secretary  of  the  said  Ministry  did  not  have  the  power  or  authority  to"
"issue  the  letter  of  transfer  P-3,  and  also  that  there  were  no  reasons"
"assigned on the face of it, except the reference to Regulation 222 (iii) of"
"the  Procedural  Rules  of  the  Public  Service  Commission.  It  was  his"
"argument  that  the  ouster  clause  in  Article  61A  has  no  application"
"because the petitioner is challenging the procedure and the authority"
"of the Secretary to issue the said letter in that form. It is his position"
"that the purported covering approval had been sought almost 3 months"
"after  the  issue  of  letter  P-3,  and  thus,  the  petitioner  is  entitled  to"
"challenge the said letter P-3 in this Court, notwithstanding the ouster"

"initially instituted on 23.10.2021, well before the granting of the said"
"purported covering sanction by P-30."
"5.  On  this  issue  of  law,  the  argument  advanced  by  State  Counsel  Mr."
"Aluwihare  is  that  issuing  of  letters  of  transfer  subject  to  covering"
"approval  of  the  PSC  is  regular  and  is  a  practice  more  often  than  not"
"resorted to and followed in the public service, especially when urgency"
"and  expediency  of  the  circumstances  so  demand.  It  was  argued  that"
"with the issuing of covering approval, the said letter of transfer and the"
"transfer  so  effected  for  all  purposes  becomes  the  act  and  deed  of  the"
"PSC, and the ouster clause thus comes into play. In support of this, he"
"relied on Ratnasiri and others vs. Ellawala and others [2004] 2 Sri"
"L.R 180. As this legal issue could determine this application, I would,"
"at the outset, consider the same."
"6.  The  regularity  of  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  issuing  P-3  and  the"
"legality thereof were seriously assailed by Mr. Ganesharajan. However,"
