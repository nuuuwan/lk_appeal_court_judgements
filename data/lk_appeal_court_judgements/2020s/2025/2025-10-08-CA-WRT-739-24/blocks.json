The Petitioners further submit that the examination of the vehicles after the release of the same by Sri Lanka Customs is illegal. The Petitioners further challenge the impugned process of the inquiry on the premise that the Respondents cannot rely upon the findings of the Government Analyst, as the Government Analyst has no authority to decide upon the matters pertaining to HS Code classification.

The investigations thus far have established that these vehicles were not originally designed as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). It is the position of the Respondents that although the Petitioners had imported vehicles under HS Code 8705.90.11, classifying them as SPVs, such vehicles were detained by the RTF of Customs due to doubts as to whether these vehicles should be classified as dual-purpose vehicles under HS Codes 8704 and /or as SPVs under HS Code 8703. The Respondents submit that the matters pertaining to whether the Petitioners have duly complied with the applicable laws are yet to be determined, as the investigation into the aforesaid vehicles is still pending.",

There is a statutory duty lying upon the officers of Sri Lanka Customs to investigate the matter in issue and determine. However, before delivering the aforesaid order by the Inquiring Officer, the Petitioners had instituted the present application. The only remaining steps of the impugned process are for the Inquiring Officer to evaluate the evidence already presented, consider the representations made by the Petitioners, and make a final determination.",

However, if the interim reliefs and the substantive reliefs sought by the Petitioners under the instant application are granted, the Inquiring Officer will lose his opportunity to comply and pursue the above-mentioned remaining steps.

I am also mindful of the fact that the Petitioners have already filed papers showing cause in respect of the Charge Sheet X37. By such conduct of the Petitioners have acceded the decision of the Respondents to proceed with the impugned inquiry and have waived off their rights to challenge the Charge Sheet X37.
