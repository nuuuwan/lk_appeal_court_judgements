"these writs.’ [Dankoluwa Estates Co Ltd v. The Tea Controller 42 NLR"
"197]”"
"I
t is observed the said report consists of facts only, and there are no charges against the"
"Petitioner.  The  said  report  does  not  have  any  decisions  or  conclusions  against  the"
"Petitioner. As per the above definition, I am of the view that there cannot lie a Writ of"
"Certiorari to quash the facts that are reported to the Magistrates Court."
"T
he non-summary inquiry"
"I
t  is  also  observed  that  subsequent  to  the  B-report,  a  non-summary  inquiry  had"
"commenced. At the conclusion of the non-summary, the Petitioner had been committed"
"to stand trial before the High Court. As per the Order of the learned Magistrate he had"
"come  to  the  conclusion  that  as  per  the  available  evidence  against  the  accused  (the"
"Petitioner in this case) in the non-summary inquiry, the accused cannot be discharged"
"under Section 153 of the Code Criminal Procedure. Hereinafter the accused in the non-"
"summary inquiry will be called the Petitioner. Accordingly, the learned Magistrate had"
"inquired as to whether the Petitioner intends to call any witnesses. It is apparent that the"
"learned Magistrate had been satisfied that as per the available evidence that he cannot"
"act  under  Section  153  and  has  acted  pursuant  to  Section  154  and  committed  the"
"Petitioner to stand trial. By this order made pursuant to Section 154(1) it is obvious the"
"Magistrate had come to the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence to commit the"
"accused. In any event, when the learned Magistrate after hearing evidence comes to the"
"conclusion that there is sufficient evidence against the Petitioner to commit him to the"
"High Court, the Petitioner’s relief prayed in prayer (e) has to fail. It is also pertinent to"
"note that the  Petitioner has failed to establish any grounds for this  Court to interfere"
"with the reporting of initial facts to the Magistrates Court."
"A
s per the submissions of the Counsel, the Petitioner has taken part in the non-summary"
"inquiry and had been represented by an Attorney-at-Law. Although the Petitioner, by"
"prayers (f) and (g) has sought to quash the non-summary proceedings and the committal"
"order,  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  plead  any  grounds  to  challenge  the  non-summary"
"inquiry proceedings or the committal order. The learned Counsel failed to demonstrate"
"any error or procedural irregularity or the conduct of the inquiry. In my view, the learned"
"Counsel was silent in his submissions on any ground that would help him to impugn the"
"committal order or the inquiry proceedings.  Hence in my view, the Petitioner has failed"
"to demonstrate any ground to substantiate his relief prayed under prayer (f) and (g)."
