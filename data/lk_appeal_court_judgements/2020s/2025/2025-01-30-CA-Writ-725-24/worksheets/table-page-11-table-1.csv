"final decision on the question involved in the proceedings.”"
"B
y prayer (j) the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st to 7th and"
"10th  Respondents  to  discharge  the  Petitioner  from  all  allegations  in  relation  to  the"
"alleged incident of the non-summary inquiry and the B-report. It  is observed by this"
"Court  that  the  filing  of  the  B-report  stage  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  is  now  long"
"concluded and also the non-summary inquiry too has concluded and the Petitioner has"
"been committed to the High Court. Hence, seeking a Mandamus at this stage becomes"
"futile. It is also observed that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate any legal right that"
"is owed to him which has not been complied to obtain the said relief. It is also observed"
"that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate any ground for the issuance of a Writ of"
"Prohibition pertaining to prayer (k). For the above stated reasons this Court is of the"
"view that prayers (j) and (k) have to fail."
