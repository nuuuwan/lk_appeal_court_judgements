"“The Court will issue a writ only if (1) the major facts are not in dispute and the"
"legal result of the facts are not subject to controversy and (2) the function that is"
"to be compelled is a public duty with the power to perform such duty.”"
"I
t is also pertinent to note that even if this court is to assume that the Petitioner’s above"
"contention is correct, though the learned Magistrate who held the non-summary inquiry"
"had formed a different opinion, still the Petitioner can stand trial. In this instance, this"
"should be the correct remedy available to the Petitioner."
"D
r. Sunil Cooray in his book ‘Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka’ (supra)"
"states that:"
"“For Certiorari to issue, there must already be a determination of rights, and"
"not a mere decision on a question of law which may ultimately be the basis of"
"the later determination of rights.”"
"I
n  this  instance,  this  Court  observes  that  by  the  committal  to  the  High  Court  the"
"Petitioner's rights are not finally decided. It is pertinent to note that as stated above the"
"committal of the Magistrate can be quashed pursuant to the provision of the Code of"
"Criminal Procedure by the Attorney General, or even if the indictment is served still, he"
"can stand trial before the High Court."

"I
t is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner has failed to name the Virtual Complainant"
"(victim) in the Magistrates Court case a party to this Application. In the view of this"
"Court, the Orders sought by the Petitioner if granted would affect the said complainant."
"It is the Virtual Complainant (victim) who complained to the police pertaining to the"
"alleged rape. However, for the reason best known to the Petitioner, he has failed to name"
"the said Virtual Complainant (victim) as a party to this Application. It is my considered"
"view that the said Virtual Complainant (victim) should have been made a party to this"
"Application  and  hence,  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  add  necessary  parties  to  this"
"Application.  It  is  trite  law  that  the  failure  to  add  necessary  parties  is  fatal  to  a  Writ"
"Application."
