The petitioner’s application is based on the survey plan bearing No. ෙක"
"However,  P2 
is  a  plan  depicting  Lot  No.  09,  and  this  plan  merely  shows  that 
its  eastern"
"boundary  is  Lot.  No.  15  and  does  not  depict  the  extent,  roadways  or  the  boundaries  of  Lot"
"No.15. The Petitioner has annexed as P3 an enlarged sketch purported to show Lot No’s. 08, 09,"
"10, 11, 12 and 15. Although P3 appears to show the existing Sub Post Office building, the access"
"road and the parking area, there is no indication as to who has prepared this sketch or its scale."
"Further,  as  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  have  not  accepted  P3,  and  as  such,  no  reliance  can  be"
"placed  on  its  accuracy.  I  am  unable  to  consider  the  P3  sketch  in  support  of  the  Petitioner’s"

"The Petitioner does not claim ownership over Lot No.15. The Petitioner’s rights over Lot No.15"
"stems from the claim that at the time of purchasing her property the 1st Respondent assured"
"her  that  the  vacant  area  of  Lot  No.  15  will  be  considered  as  common  property  on  behalf  of"
"herself and her neighbors to be used for vehicular and pedestrian access to their properties and"
"would  also  be  available  for  parking.  The  Petitioner  states  that  this  assurance  was  one  of  the"
"reasons that motivated her to purchase the property (Lot No.09), and since the said purchase,"
"she has been making use of Lot No.15 for the aforesaid purposes. Under the circumstances, the"
"Petitioner  claims  a  legitimate  expectation  that  she  would  be  permitted  to  continue  to  avail"
