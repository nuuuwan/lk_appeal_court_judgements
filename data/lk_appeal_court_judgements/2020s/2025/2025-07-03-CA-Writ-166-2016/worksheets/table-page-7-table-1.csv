"The position of the 5th Respondent (the prospective purchaser of the disputed land) is that the"
"existing Sub Post Office is situated on Lot No.14 and not Lot No.15 as declared by the petitioner"
"and  the 
land  she 
is  attempting  to  purchase 
is  the  said  Lot  No.14.  As  proof  of,  the  5th"
"Respondent has submitted the letter dated 12th February 2023 (annexed to the objections as"
"5R4) of Colombo District Manager of NHDA, requesting to provide the 5th Respondent a survey"
"plan  of  Lot  No.14  as 
it 
is  decided  to  transfer  the  building  bearing  No.  95/4  to  the  5th"
"Respondent. The 5R4 letter and the plan issued by NHDA marked as 5R5 clearly shows that the"
"plot of land and the building the 5th Respondent is attempting to purchase is Lot No. 14 and not"
"Lot No. 15. The 5th respondent in her objections has categorically stated that she has no claim"
"regarding Lot No.15."
"In  addition  to  the  rights  claimed  by  the  Petitioner  arising  from  the  doctrine  of  legitimate"
"expectation,  the  Petitioner  further  contends  that  having  regard  to  the  purpose,  scope,  and"
"statutory 
framework  of  the  National  Housing  Development  Authority  Act,  the  purported"
"attempt by the Respondents to alienate or dispose of the disputed portion of land is ultra vires"
"and/or unlawful. However, the Petitioner has failed to specifically establish in what manner the"
"actions of the Respondents amount to a contravention of the express provisions of the said Act."
"The  Petitioner, 
in  her  written  submissions,  has  further  asserted  that  the  conduct  of  the"
"Respondents 
is  procedurally 
improper  and/or  unreasonable.  However,  other 
than 
the"
"allegation  that  the  3rd  Respondent  failed  to  respond  to  the  Petitioner,  no  material  has  been"
"submitted to substantiate any claim of unreasonableness or procedural impropriety on the part"
"of the Respondents. Moreover, it is pertinent to note that, at least subsequent to the filing of"
"this  application,  there  have  been  multiple  attempts  by  the  parties  to  resolve  the  matter"
"amicably.  In  the  circumstances,  it  cannot  be  reasonably  contended  that  the  Petitioner  was"
"deprived of an opportunity to be heard."
"The  position  of  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  throughout  has  been  that  they  intend  to  lawfully"
"hand over a block of land to the 5th respondent for the purpose of maintaining a post office, and"
"this land does not coincide with any part of the land that is lawfully owned by the petitioner."
"Further, the Respondents have submitted that the petitioner cannot institute legal proceedings"
"to compel the Respondents to sell state land to her and her neighbors."
