"The facts giving rise to this application are as follows: the 8th Respondent, a"
"customer of HNB, had previously obtained credit facilities in the name of the"
"12th Respondent company during the period 2008-2009. These facilities had"
"been 
secured  by  a  mortgage  over 
the  premises  bearing  No.  562/5,"
"Welikadawatte, Rajagiriya. When the Petitioner assumed duties as Manager"
"of  the  Borella  Branch  in  May  2010,  the  said  credit  facility  was  already  in"
"arrears. Consequently, the Head Office of HNB had scheduled the auction of"
"the mortgaged premises in or around December 2010 in order to recover the"
"outstanding sums."
"S
hortly prior to the scheduled auction, the 6th Respondent, who at the time"
"was unknown to the Petitioner, visited the Borella Branch in the company of"
"the  8th  Respondent  and  offered  to  settle  the  overdue  amounts,  requesting"
"that  the  auction  be  stayed.  Acting  in  accordance  with  standard  banking"
"procedure  and  under 
instructions 
from  the  Head  Office,  the  Petitioner"
"informed the 6th Respondent that the auction could only be stayed upon full"
"settlement of the arrears. On the following day, the 6th Respondent returned"
"with the 8th Respondent and deposited a sum of Rs. 6.25 million, which the"
"Petitioner handed over to the cashier, and which was thereafter credited to"
"the account of the 12th Respondent company."
"S
ubsequent to this transaction, the 7th Respondent, who was also previously"
"unknown  to  the  Petitioner,  appeared  at  the  Borella  Branch  and  claimed"
"ownership of the mortgaged premises. The Assistant Manager of the Branch"
"advised the 7th Respondent to raise his grievance with the Legal Department"
"of HNB, as title disputes were not within the operational purview of branch-"
"level officers. The Petitioner asserts that he was later informed of this visit and"
"was advised that a title search had previously been conducted by the Legal"
"Department prior to execution of the mortgage."
"O
n or about 20th January 2011, the 6th Respondent lodged a complaint with"
"the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), alleging that the 8th, 9th, and"
"10th Respondents had induced him to deposit the aforementioned sum of Rs."
"6.25 million under the promise that the scheduled auction would be stayed"
"and that the land would thereafter be transferred to him. It is further alleged"
"that these Respondents did so while knowing that the said property belonged"
"to a third party. As a result, investigations were initiated under Sections 389"
"(criminal breach of trust) and 400 (cheating) of the Penal Code."
"O
n  29th  June  2011,  the  8th  Respondent  was  named  as  a  suspect  and"
"produced 
before 
the  Magistrateâ€™s 
Court 
of 
Colombo 
in 
Case 
No."
"B/9872/02/11. On 21st February 2012, the Petitioner provided a statement"
"to  the  CID  (marked  P-15C),  wherein  he  described  the  sequence  of  events"
"leading  up  to  and  following  the  deposit  of  the  Rs.  6.25  million  by  the  6th"
"Respondent. In his statement, the Petitioner reiterated that he had acted in"
"compliance  with  banking  protocols  and 
that  no 
formal  complaint  or"
"documentation  had  been  addressed  to  him  regarding  any  dispute  over  the"
"ownership of the mortgaged property."
