"T
he Petitioner also challenges the lawfulness of the travel ban imposed on him"
"by the Learned Magistrate of Colombo on 19th August 2020, asserting that"
"the order was made in his absence and without proper service, at a time when"
"he  was  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  Sri  Lanka.  He  avers  that  the  consequent"
"issuance of a warrant by the Learned High Court Judge on 15th March 2022"
"was similarly flawed and in breach of natural justice."
"I
t is further submitted that the Petitioner first became aware of the High Court"
"indictment only in late 2022, when a CID officer visited the residence of his"
"ex-wife in Sri Lanka. Upon inquiry, he discovered that he had been named as"
"the  4th  Accused  in  High  Court  Case  No.  HC  1998/2020.  The  Petitioner"
"contends that the absence of timely notification or summons, the long delay"
"in  instituting  proceedings  against  him,  and  the  lack  of  fresh  or  credible"
"material render the indictment procedurally and substantively flawed."
"T
he  Petitioner  thus  contends  that  the  decision  of  the  Honourable  Attorney"
"General to indict him is unreasonable, arbitrary, ultra vires and in violation"
"of the principles of natural justice. He asserts that the  naming of him as a"
"suspect,  the  filing  of  charges,  and  the  issuance  of  consequential  orders"
"including the travel ban and arrest warrant are all legally unsustainable and"
"ought  to  be  quashed.  Accordingly,  he  seeks  the  reliefs  prayed  for  in  the"
"Petition."
