"T
he  1st  to  5th  Respondents  further  contend  that  the  6th  Respondent  was"
"induced to pay a sum of Rs. 6.25 million to the HNB Borella Branch, having"
"been  misled  by  the  8th,  9th,  and  10th  Respondents  into  believing  that  he"
"could purchase the property in question and thereby prevent its auction. It is"
"asserted that the said payment was made by the 6th Respondent under the"
"assurance that the property would be transferred to his name upon payment."
"According to the 6th Respondent, the 9th and 10th Respondents acted under"
"the directions and instructions of the Petitioner, thereby implicating him in"
"the alleged fraudulent scheme."
"T
he Respondents rely on the statement of the 7th Respondent, the claimed"
"lawful  owner  of  the  subject  property,  who  reportedly  visited  the  Borella"
"Branch  and  made  known  his  ownership  to  the  9th  Respondent  and  the"
"Assistant  Manager,  presenting  his  deeds.  It  is  contended  that  the  Bank’s"
"officials,  including  the  9th  Respondent,  failed  to  take  appropriate  action  to"
"escalate this ownership dispute to the Legal Department of HNB in a timely"
"manner, thereby facilitating the continued misrepresentation of the title."
"I
t is the position of the 1st to 5th Respondents that the Attorney General’s"
"prosecutorial discretion is a matter within the domain of executive authority"
"and  has  been  exercised  lawfully  in  this  instance.  They  submit  that  the"
"indictment of the Petitioner was based on credible investigative material and"
"is  not  amenable  to  judicial  review,  save  in  the  narrowest  of  circumstances"
"where illegality, irrationality, or mala fides is clearly demonstrated, none of"
"which, they argue, has been established by the Petitioner in the present case."
