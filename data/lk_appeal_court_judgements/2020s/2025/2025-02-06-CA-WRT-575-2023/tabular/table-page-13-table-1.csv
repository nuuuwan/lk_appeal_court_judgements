"Senior  State  Counsel  who  represented  the  Attorney  General  also  subscribed  to"
"the views expressed on behalf of the appellants.‚Äù"
"Therefore, taking into consideration the Sinhala version of Clause 3 of the Regulation"
"and the fact that the 2nd, 9th, 15th, 19th, 22nd and 29th Respondents had been present at"
"the Inquiry proceedings, this Court is of the view that, there is no violation of Clause"
"3 of the Regulation."
"Secondly,  the  learned  Counsel  appearing  for  the  Petitioner  argues  that  on  the  third"
"session  which  was  held  on  12.08.2023,  Dr  D.  S.  Samaraweera,  the  26th  Respondent"
"was not present but he was present before the first two sessions and the fourth session."
"Moreover,  the  Judicial  Accessor,  Hon.  Justice  Chandra  Ekanayake  was  not  present"
"before the fourth  session. Therefore, the  argument  of the learned Counsel appearing"
"for the Petitioner is that the Inquiry proceedings were conducted in contravention of"
"Clause  6,  7(1)  and  7(2)  of  the  Second  Schedule  to  the  Regulations  marked  as  P30."
"Hence  the  Inquiry  proceedings  are  void  ab  initio  and  the  Sentencing  Order  marked"
"P27 is ultra vires and erroneous in law on the face of the record. Clause 6, 7(1) and"
"7(2) of the second schedule to the Regulations reads thus,"
