"caused  to  the  Petitioner  and  there  is  no  violation  of  Clause  7(1)  and  7(2)  as  the"
"required quorum of members has been satisfied in the first two sessions."
"The  third  argument  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  Sentencing  Order  communicated  by"
"the Registrar of the 1st Respondent marked as P26 is a decision of the PCC and not a"
"decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  which  is  contrary  to  Regulations  20  and  21  of  the"
"Regulations marked as P30. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argued"
"that at the time the Sentencing Order was communicated to the Petitioner by way of a"
"letter marked as P26, the said Order was not approved by the 1st Respondent and to"
"enforce the Sentencing Order the PCC should submit it to the 1st Respondent and get"
"the 
approval.  The  Sentencing  Order  was 
communicated 
to 
the  Petitioner  on"
"11.09.2023  (P26)  and  it  was  approved  by  the  1st  Respondent  at  its  meeting  held  on"
"22.09.2023  (1R6).  Therefore, 
this 
is  contrary 
to  Regulations  20  and  21  of 
the"
"Regulations marked as P30. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further"
"argued 
that  enforcing 
the  decision  of 
the  PCC  without 
the  approval  of 
the  1st"
"Respondent  is  a  procedural  impropriety.  In  the  case  of  Council  of  Civil  Service"
"Unions  v.  Minister 
for 
the  Civil  Service2  Lord  Diplock  described  procedural"
"impropriety as one of the grounds for judicial review as follows;"
