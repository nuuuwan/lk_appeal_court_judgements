"states  that  in  case  of  any  inconsistency,  the  Sinhala  version  should  prevail.  The"
"language of the legislation is governed under Article 23 of the Constitution. Article 23"
"(2), reads as follows,"
"“All  Orders.  Proclamations,  rules,  by-laws,  regulations  and  notifications  made"
"or  issued under  any  written  law  other  than  by  a  Provincial  Council  or  a  local"
"authority,  and  the  Gazette  shall  be  published  in  Sinhala  and  Tamil  together"
"with a translation thereof in English.”"
"Under Section 72 of the Medical Ordinance, the Minister of Health has been given the"
"power to make regulations under the Medical Ordinance and the Regulations marked"
"as  P30  and  1R8  have  come  into  force  by  execution  of  such  powers  vested  with  the"
"Minister under Section 72 of the Medical Ordinance. It is evident from Article 23 that"
"when regulations are made under any written law, they should be published in Sinhala"
"and Tamil languages along with a translation in English. In terms of Article 18(1), the"
"official language of Sri Lanka is Sinhala. Therefore, it is clear that in terms of Article"
"23 of the Constitution, the Sinhala version of the Regulations (1R8) prevails over the"
"English version of the Regulations (P30) which is a translation of such regulation. In"
"the case of Attorney General v. Ayiduroos Abdul Rahim and Others1, where there was"
"an  inconsistency  in  the  English  and  the  Sinhala  version  of  Regulation  6  published"
"under  the  Gazette  Notification,  bearing  No.147/24  issued  under  the  Public  Security"
"Ordinance, Aluwihare PC. J., observed that,"
"“It is contended on behalf of the Appellants that in the event of an inconsistency"
"between  the  texts  of  a  statute  or  any  other  law,  that  it  is  the  Sinhala  text  that"
"would prevail and this court is inclined to accept the said argument. The learned"
