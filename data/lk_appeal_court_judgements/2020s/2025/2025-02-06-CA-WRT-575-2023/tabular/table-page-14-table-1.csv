"Committee  shall  be  constituted  and 
the 
inquiry  shall  commence 
from 
the"
"beginning before the Committee so constituted."
"The contention  of the learned Counsel  appearing for the 1st  Respondent  is  that even"
"though the 26th Respondent did not participate in the third session of the Inquiry, his"
"absence does not have any impact on the validity of the proceedings that took place in"
"the third session and the entire inquiry proceedings as the members present at the third"
"session satisfy the quorum of members required by Clause 3 of the Regulations. The"
"learned Counsel further argued that the Judicial Accessor is not a member of the PCC"
"and  does  not  constitute  a  part  of  the  PCC  and  therefore  the  absence  of  the  Judicial"

"concluded 
the  Inquiry  and 
the  order  of 
the  PCC  was  fixed 
to  be  delivered  on"
"12.08.2023 and therefore the Registrar of the 1st Respondent has asked the Petitioner"
"to submit an affidavit stating his position indicating the intention of the Petitioner to"
"withdraw his previous plea of not guilty. However, as the Petitioner had submitted an"
"affidavit  affirming  facts  inconsistent  with  the  facts  presented  by  his  Counsel  in  the"
"second  session,  the  PCC  has  directed  the  Petitioner  to  file  a  fresh  affidavit  on  that"

"not participate in the third session, he has signed the sentencing order. However, the"
"inquiry  has  been  duly  concluded  in  the  second  session  and  even  though  there  were"
"three sessions, in the third session the Petitioner has only been directed to hand over a"
"fresh  affidavit.  Therefore,  it  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  no  prejudice  has  been"
