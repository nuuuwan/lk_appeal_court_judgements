    "text": "If I am to summarize the Petitioners\u2019 contentions, the main relief the Petitioners sought is based on four main grounds. Which are firstly, the 8th Respondent has constructed a permenant structure in the turning circle without the permission of the 1st Respondent (Paragraph 17(a) of the Amended Petition). Secondly, it is argued that though the Municipal Council is charged with the general protection of the people, despite several complaints, the Municipal Council has failed to discharge its statutory duty (paragraph 18(a) of the Amended Petition). Thirdly, Urban Development Authority Law (herein referred to as \u201cUDA Law\u201d) provides for a mechanism to enforce the law, especially pertaining to unauthorized structures, which the 1st Respondent has failed to implement. Fourthly, the Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council\u2019s inaction or inability to take remedial action pursuant to the provisions of the law. Keeping the said grounds as it may, in the instant Application before me, the parties have conceded to the existence of the roadway depicted in Plan No. 1080 marked \u201cC\u201d and also of the existence of Lot 5, the turning circle. This plan has been submitted to the 1st Respondent and there is an endorsement to state that, subject to a specific development project being approved by the 1st Respondent, the Lots depicted in the said plan are permitted to be developed. The Petitioners contend that, as per this plan, Lot 5, which contains 9.05 Perches, is the turning circle for the 10ft wide roadway. The 8th Respondent, who occupies Lot 3, is alleged to have constructed an unauthorized structure (roller gate), thereby caused an obstruction and reduced the extent of the turning circle, which has rendered the entire turning circle useless and purposeless. The Petitioners\u2019 grievance is that, though complaints were made to the 1st Respondent, inquiries were held by both the 1st and 5th Respondents and decisions were made, none of the decisions have been implemented. I have carefully considered the objections filed by the 8th Respondent. In the said objections, I find that the 8th Respondent does not deny the construction within Lot 5. However, in paragraph 9 of the objections, the 8th Respondent had conceded that she had constructed the houses with the consent of the Petitioners. Applicability of UDA Laws. The 8th Respondent argues that 1st -7th Respondents have no power to act under the UDA Law. Especially in view of sections 23(5) and 28A, it appears that her main contention is that the land which the dispute arose is not within an Urban Development Area (herein referred to as \u201cdevelopment area\u201d) as contemplated under section 23 of the UDA Law. Section 23 of the UDA Law enables the Minister to declare development areas by an order published in the Gazette and it further empowers that any development plan and development project which is in conflict with the UDA law shall cease to operate in that area. Subsection 5 of section 23 allows the UDA to delegate any of its powers and duties",

It is the Respondents\u2019 contention that what is delegated is only \u201cplanning activities\u201d and the planning procedure. Hence, the argument that the 1st Respondent has no power to give notice under section 28A (1) under the UDA Law. Further, it was her contention that the person who received the notice therefore, is not bound to act pursuant to section 28A (3). This, argument cannot be maintained as under section 23 (5), the delegation of powers pertaining to planning includes the development activities. This is now settled law and in coming to this conclusion I am guided by the case of Rajalingam v. Colombo Municipal Council 2020 1 SLR 179, where the Supreme Court considered the varying case law and provided clarification on whether the UDA can delegate its powers under section 23(5) of the Law.

Indeed all the above new sections are found under Part II A-' Planning Procedure' introduced by Act No. 04 of 1982. Therefore, I have no hesitation to concur with the ratio decidendi of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Muniyandy Paneer Selvam's case that the provisions contained in section 28A(3) fall within the scope of the term \"planning\" and therefore the powers, duties and functions referred to therein could be delegated by the UDA to any officer of a local authority. For the above reasons, I am in full agreement with the interpretation given to section 23(5) of the UDA Law by their Lordships in the cases cited above namely E. R. M. Piyasena v. H. M. Wijesooriya; S. Sivapragasam and two others v. Robert Jayaseelan Perimpanayagam, Municipal Council Batticaloa and Saravanamuttu Navaneethan, Special Commissioner, Municipal Council Batticaloa and Palligoda Withanage Keerthi Wimal Withana (District Inspector Colombo Municipal Council) v. Muniyandy Paneer Selvam. Thus, I am of the view that the delegation of authority to the Respondent to institute the case bearing No. 9341/5 in the Magistrate's Court of Colombo has been correctly done in accordance with section 23(5) of the Urban Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978, as amended.\u201d In view of the above judgement, the 8th Respondent's objection based on the argument that the 1st Respondent has no power to act under the UDA law has to fail.

Hence, this Court comes to the conclusion that the disputed land area is situated in a development area within the meaning of sections 3 and 8F of the Law as amended. The parties were not at variance that, as per the UDA Regulations, any development project within a development area should be done with the approval of the UDA. Let me now consider whether there had been a construction in the disputed turning circle. The purported construction The Petitioners\u2019 main contention is that the 8th Respondent had constructed an unauthorized structure, thereby obstructing the turning circle depicted as Lot 5 in the document marked and produced as \u201cC\u201d. The said plan is approved by the 1st Respondent. It is further contended that the purpose of having this turning circle was due to the gradient of the narrow roadway, whereby when a vehicle that enters the roadway cannot turn and has to reverse onto the main Kotte Road down a steep incline, which the Petitioners state is one of the busiest main roads. The Petitioners submit that when they discovered that the 8th Respondent was constructing a permanent structure within the turning circle, they lodged a complaint to the UDA and to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, who are the 5th and the 1st Respondents in this Application, respectively. By the letter dated 24.06.2020, the 1st Respondent, upon receiving the complaint by the Petitioners, has called for a meeting with all parties. The said letter is marked as \u201cF\u201d. The said discussion was to be chaired by the Deputy Mayor of the 1st Respondent. The 5th Respondent also had replied to the complaint made by the Petitioner by letter dated 22.07.2020 marked as \u201cE\u201d, which states that the authority pertaining to dealing with the said complaint has been vested with the local authority. Subsequent to the letter sent by the 1st Respondent, there had been a meeting in the presence of the Petitioners and the 8th Respondent, and as per the minutes of the said meeting, which has been marked and tendered to this Court as \u201cG\u201d, the Petitioners and the 8th Respondent, among others, have participated and signed the minutes. In the said minutes, the 8th Respondent had accepted that she had constructed an unauthorized structure. The said minute reads as follows.",

The said plan, which is purported to be approved by the 1st Respondent, is a plan for the construction of a house. This Court will advert to the said plan elsewhere in this judgment.

It was argued that as the Petitioners did not receive any further response from the 1st and 5th Respondents, the Petitioners had lodged a complaint with the police pertaining to the obstruction of the roadway and the disturbances caused by the said unauthorized construction marked as \u201cL\u201d. Thereafter, the Petitioners submit that the 1st Respondent, for reasons unknown to them, had been reluctant to act according to the UDA Law but had issued a letter marked as \u201cM\u201d bearing the date 08.11.2025. The impugned letter whereby the 1st Respondent had informed the Petitioners as well as the 8th Respondent to resolve the issue pertaining to the unauthorized structure through civil litigation between the parties. The Petitioners vehemently contend that by this letter, the 1st Respondent had failed to act according to the powers vested with the 1st Respondent Council and also by asking the parties to resolve the issue through civil litigation has derelict and abdicated its powers. The learned State Counsel appearing for the 5th Respondent, in her submissions, submitted a complaint received by the 5th Respondent from the 1st Petitioner, whereby she has complained of the unauthorized structure. The letter bearing the date 01.07.2020 is marked as 5R1. The 5th Respondent, objecting to Writ Application on the grounds of delay further submitted that the 1st Petitioner had complained about the unauthorized construction only by the said letter. This Court is not inclined to accept the said submission in view of the letter marked as \u201cF\u201d by the Petitioners, which is issued by the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent had called a meeting to resolve the dispute between the parties on 30.06.2020. The letter inviting the parties to the meeting is dated 24.06.2020. The said letter predates the letter 5R1 and it is observed that for the 1st Respondent to send the letter on 24.06.2020, the Petitioners\u2019 complaint should have reached the 1st Respondent prior to June 2020. Further, I observe that even in the letter marked as 5R1, the Petitioners have mentioned about the inquiry that the Deputy Mayor of the 1st Respondent had conducted in June 2020. However, the 1st Respondent in its objections conceded that the 1st Respondent has undertaken two site inspections and observed that there is an unauthorized structure that obstructs the turning circle. Further, in view of the Development Circular No. 27 dated 04.12.2017 issued by the UDA the 1st Respondent admitted that the Authority is with the power to deal with unauthorized constructions. The 5th Respondent also tendered to this Court the field reports by their technical officers marked as 5R3 and 5R4. Let me now consider whether the 1st Respondent\u2019s act of dispatching the letter marked \u201cM\u201d is bad in law and whether the 1st Respondent had failed to act according to the powers vested with it.",

    "text": "Further action of the 1st Respondent. As discussed earlier in this judgment, the premises which the structure that is in dispute is situated within the UDA declared area under section 3 of the UDA Law. Thereby, it is mandatory that any development within the said development area requires the approval of the UDA. As observed earlier the UDA has delegated its power to the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent after two inspections had come to the conclusion that the 8th Respondent had constructed a structure that is unauthorized. At an inquiry, the 8th Respondent herself had admitted that she had constructed an unauthorized structure. Hence, in my view there is sufficient material for the 1st Respondent to act under the UDA Law pertaining to unauthorized constructions. Further, the 1st Respondent has exercised the delegated power by issuing the letters marked as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d, ordering the unauthorized structure to be removed within 14 and 7 days. However, the learned State Counsel for the 5th Respondent states that though the letters were sent in 2020, no legal action has been instituted. Let me now consider whether the 1st Respondent has the power for the removal of unauthorized structures. In terms of section 8J (1) of the UDA Law, it is stated that, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of any other law, no Government agency or any other person shall carry out or engage in any development activity in any development area or part thereof, except under the authority, and in accordance with the terms and conditions, of a permit issued in that behalf by the Authority.\u201d Hence, it is clear for a construction within a development area can be carried out only with the permissions of the UDA. Let me also consider whether the development activity, namely, the construction of the structure containing a roller gate falls within the meaning of a development activity. Development activity is defined in the UDA Law under section 29 as, \u201cdevelopment activity means the parcelling or sub-division of any land, the erection or re-erection of structures and the construction of works thereon, the carrying out of building, engineering and other operations on, over or under such land and any change in the use for which the land or any structure thereof is used, other than the use of any land for purposes of agriculture, horticulture and the use of any land within the curtilage of a dwelling house for any purpose incidental to the enjoyment of a dwelling house, not involving any building operation that would require the submission of a new building plan.\u201d (Emphasis added). In light of the above, it is apparent that the roller gate constructed by the 8th Respondent constitutes a development activity within the meaning of section 29 of the Law. Therefore, the construction of a roller gate could be carried out only with an approval namely, a construction permit issued by the 1st Respondent. If a permit has not been",

However, the 1st Respondent has not taken any further action for reasons best known to them and not disclosed to this Court. In view of the provisions of the above Law, if 8th Respondent had erected an unauthorized structure, the UDA has the power to institute action in the Magistrates Court requesting for an order authorizing the UDA to abolish the structure. It is not disputed and as I have stated above, the UDA has delegated it is power to the 1st Respondent. Hence, by issuing the letter marked \u201cM\u201d, the 1st Respondent had abdicated its powers and had attempted to allow the parties to litigate on their own. It is the duty of the 1st respondent to exercise the said powers in compliance with the law and not to delegate the said powers to 3rd parties. This, in my view, is a clear dereliction of the powers vested with the 1st Respondent. Accordingly, I am of the view, that the letter marked as \u201cM\u201d is bad in law for the reasons stated above. Has the 8th Respondent obtained approval for the construction? It is pertinent to observe that the learned Counsel appearing for the 8th Respondent submits that all the construction has the relevant approval. The 8th Respondent tendered the alleged development approval by way of a motion dated 20.02.2025. This Court observes that the said motion tendered by the 8th Respondent contained a plan for a proposed house within the 8th Respondent\u2019s premises. It does not disclose any construction within the turning circle. Nor does it depict the disputed roller gate. Hence, the said plan does not shed any light to substantiate the 8th Respondent\u2019s argument that she has obtained prior approval for the construction of the disputed construction. It is also pertinent to note that the learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent at the hearing as well as in the written submissions has stated that the plan that has been tendered to this Court by way of a motion is different from the plan tendered for approval of the 1st Respondent. As per its records, the 1st Respondent contended that even the building permit granted for the construction of the 8thRrespondent\u2019s house which is depicted in the plan has lapsed and that there is no material in the file maintained to reflect an extension has been sought or granted. Further, it was argued that certain changes and endorsements",

    "text": "that are found in the plan tendered to this Court by the 8th Respondent are not available in the plan which is in the custody of the 1st Respondent. In this context, the learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent very boldly stated that the plan submitted is not genuine and amounts to forgery. To exuberate the gravity of this, the 1st Respondent had attached a letter issued by the Chief Municipal Engineer of the 1st Respondent dated 06.05.2024 which clearly states that the alleged changes and amendments made to the plan are not reflected in the office copy of the plan which is in the custody of the 1st Respondent. Further, it is alleged that the signature of the Mayor placed in the purported plan of the 8th Respondent too, is not reflected in the office copy. As per this submission, it is a serious matter that warrants an investigation by the 1st Respondent. This Court observes that the 8th Respondent has failed to establish that she had submitted a plan to obtain approval for the construction of the roller gate nor any approval granted by the 1st Respondent for the construction of the same. Aggravating the situation further, through a motion dated 02.06.2025, the 1st Respondent has filed a document dated 07.04.2025, stating that even the purported construction of the house which is depicted in the disputed plan tendered by the 8th Respondent has not been issued with the Certificate of Conformity. Thereby, making the entire construction of the house an unauthorized structure. Before concluding, I will now consider the objections raised by the 1st \u2013 4th Respondents. Objections to the Application The 1st Respondent firstly objects, to this Application on the basis of delay and laches on the part of the Petitioners and contends that the Court should dismiss the Application. It was learned Counsel\u2019s contention that the grievance had arose in 2020. It was argued that the Petitioners had only invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in 2022. Thus, it is argued that the there is a delay of 2 years. In considering these objections I have perused the documents tendered to this Court. I have observed that the Petitioner had commenced her long list of complaints to the 1st Respondent in the year 2020. Subsequently there had been various correspondence between the parties and there had been various meetings throughout the year 2020 and thereafter the 1st Respondent had issued 2 notices for demolition in December 2020 giving time for the 8th Respondent to remove the unauthorized structure. As the unauthorized structures had not been removed, the 1st Respondent had dispatched a letter to the Petitioners and the 8th Respondent dated 08.11.2021, whereby the 1st Respondent had informed the parties to resolve the dispute through civil litigation. This letter is dated 08.11.2021. This letter is the letter impugned by the Petitioners. The Petitioners thereafter in January 2022 has filed the Petition which is only about 2 months from the date the impugned letter had been issued by the 1st Respondent. In my view, I cannot consider the period of two months as a delay. Especially in the light of the factual",

    "text": "circumstances describe above. Further, it is also pertinent to observe that the 1st Respondent who had received the complaint in 2020 had failed to take any meaningful action as prescribe by law until the year 2022. Hence in my view this objection is not tenable. The 1st Respondent also objected to this Writ Application and contended that the Petitioners have not exhausted the alternative remedies available to them. Namely, it is contended that the Petitioners should have recourse to civil litigation. In my view, this objection is not tenable as the Petitioners\u2019 grievance is pertaining to an unauthorized construction. Removing unauthorized construction within an urban development area, especially within an area which falls within section 3 is clearly with the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent has been given statutory power for this purpose. Hence, this objection has to fail. I have considered the judgments of M.A.D.A.K. Mallikarachchi v. Dr.P.V.N.P. Amarasinghe Director, Medical Research Institute and others CA Writ 474/2021 decided on 14.11.2023 and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited Vs Mr. B.K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi and Others CA Writ 243/2021 decided on 10.02.2022 and I find that the facts and circumstances of the said case is not relevant to the case before me. The 1st Respondent in its written submissions has attempted to address the issue before us as an issue of encroachment. However, it is pertinent to observe that the complaint was based on a complaint of unauthorized construction. The 1st Respondent\u2019s subsequent conduct of sending the technical officers and the inquiry held with the participation of all parties, too seems to be on an issue of unauthorized construction. As I have stated it is the 1st Respondent who is entrusted under the UDA Law to authorize constructions and to take steps pertaining to unauthorized constructions. In this context, I do not agree with the 1st Respondent\u2019s submission that they have at all times enforced the Municipal Council Regulations and taken action against the violations established. The objections taken by the 8th Respondent was on the basis that the construction does not fall within the UDA area. Hence, it was argued that the 1st Respondent has no legal authority to act under the UDA Law. In my judgement I have already discussed the applicability of the UDA Law pertaining to the corpus where the disputed construction is. Hence, the objections raised by the 8th Respondent has to fail. Conclusion Accordingly, as per the reasons stated above, when the UDA Law vests the power with the 1st Respondent to remove the unauthorized structure, issuing the impugned letter marked as \u201cM\u201d directing the parties to resolve their dispute pertaining to an unauthorized construction by resorting to civil action is bad in law. Hence, I proceed to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in document marked as \u201cM\u201d.",
