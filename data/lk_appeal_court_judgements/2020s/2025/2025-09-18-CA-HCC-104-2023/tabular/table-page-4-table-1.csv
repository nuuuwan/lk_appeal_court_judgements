"who  had  been  sleeping  unclothed,  awoke  to  find  the  Accused  beside  her,  touching  her"
"inappropriately. PW 01 testified that the Accused then raped her and threatened to kill"
"her if she disclosed the incident."
"PW  01  stated  that  following  her  grandmother’s  illness,  and  she  was  in  Colombo,  her"
"grandmother’s  house  was  closed,  and  she  remained  at  the  residence  of  her  maternal"

"removed  before  raping  her.  The  incident  lasted  approximately  10  to  15  minutes.  The"
"witness experienced physical pain, pleaded with the Accused to stop, and attempted to"
"escape,  but  was  unable  to  do  so  due  to  the  Accused’s  physical  strength.  The  witness"
"further testified that the Accused threatened to kill her during the incident if she disclosed"
"this to anyone."
