pon  consideration  of  the  testimony  of  PW  01,  it  is  evident  that  the  incident  occurred"
"when she was approximately 10 years of age, and her evidence was recorded after a lapse"
"of  11  years  at  the  trial.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  time,  her  testimony  remained"

"denied the charges, he admitted to having struck the victim, attributing his actions to her"
"alleged stubborn behaviour. However, it is pertinent to consider the testimony of PW-5,"
"who stated that, while she was present, the Accused struck the victim and made certain"
"utterances."
