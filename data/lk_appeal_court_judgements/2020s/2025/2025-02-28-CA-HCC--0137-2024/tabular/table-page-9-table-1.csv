"CA/HCC/137/24"
"Had the learned Trial Judge looked in to the evidence presented in its correct"
"perspective, he should have accepted the evidence adduced by the Appellant."
"Therefore, considering all the evidence presented in the trial, I conclude that"
"the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on"
"the prosecutionâ€™s case."
"As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable"
"doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High"
"Court Judge of Colombo dated 28/06/2023 on the Appellant. Therefore, he"
"is acquitted from this case."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
