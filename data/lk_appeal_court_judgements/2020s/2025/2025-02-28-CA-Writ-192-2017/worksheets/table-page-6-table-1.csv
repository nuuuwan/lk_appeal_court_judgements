"13. Considering the main relief prayed for by the Petitioner in prayer (d) it is clear that the"
"relief he is seeking is based on the fact that the impugned land cannot be categorized as"
"a  “paddy  land” under  the  definition  given  in  section  101  of  the  Agrarian  Development"
"Act No. 46 of 2000."
"The departure from the previous position taken by the Petitioner"
"14. The  Petitioner  has  submitted  P5  and  P6  on  the  acceptance  that  the  impugned  land  is"
"“paddy land” under the definition given in section 101 of the Agrarian Development Act"
"as  such  unless  the  Petitioner  can  give  an  explanation  acceptable  to  the  Court,  the"
"Petitioner is estopped from taking a contrary position in this application."
"15. It is the position the Petitioner that the Petitioner was “compelled to and/or ordered to"
"and/or  directed  to  and/or  misled”  [paragraph  18  of  the  Petition] 
into  making  the"
"applications P5 and P6 and as such, there was no admission or acceptance by him that"
"the impugned land is paddy land. It appears that the Petitioner is unable to clearly state"
"which  act  of  the  Respondents  prompted  him  to  take  a  false  position.  The  Petitioner"
"appears to be uncertain whether he was ordered to act in that manner or was misled in"
"to acting in that manner."
"16. The  Petitioner  has  filed  an  affidavit  from  Mr.  Lalith  Pathirana  who  participated  in  the"
"discussion with the 2nd Respondent. I have reproduced below averment in paragraph 14"
"of  Mr.  Lalith  Pathirana’s  Affidavit  [annexed  to  the  Petition  as  P7]  referring  to  this"
"allegation."
"14 
As stated above, the said Applications were made at the instance"
"of  the  said  officer  and  in  any  event,  the  said  applications  are"
"based on the fact that the said land is uncultivated paddy land."
"17. Mr. Lalith Pathirana’s Affidavit  P7 does not support the allegation that 3rd Respondent"
"or  any  other  Respondent  had  “compelled  to  and/or  ordered  to  and/or  directed  to"
"and/or misled” the Petitioner into admitting the impugned land is “paddy land”."
"18. On the above grounds, I reject the explanation of the Petitioner and conclude that the"
"Petitioner is estopped from taking a position that the impugned land is not paddy land."
