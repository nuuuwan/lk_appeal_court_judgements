"Availability of a writ of Mandamus"
"37. The main relief sought by the Petitioner is at prayer (d) of the Petition which is a request"
"for  a  writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the  Respondents  to  make  order  that  the  impugned"
"land  is not paddy  land.  Basically,  what  is  being asked  for  is  a  determination by  the  1st"
"Respondent"
"38. According  to  Section  101  of  the  Act,  the  Commissioner-General  can  determine  that"
"certain land not to be “paddy land”, which means it is possible for the 1st Respondent to"
"determine that the impugned land is not a  “paddy land” under the definition given by"
"Agrarian  Development  Act  No.  46  0f  2000.  The  Act  does  not  specify  the  process  by"
"which the Commissioner-General can arrive at this determination. However, it stands to"
"reason that there should be material before the Commissioner-General in order for him"
"to  arrive  at this  conclusion.  There  is nothing  in  the  Act  preventing  the Petitioner  from"
"submitting 
the  necessary  material 
to 
the  1st  Respondent  and 
requesting  him 
to"
"reconsider the previous decision."
"39. P24  letter  sent to the 2nd  Respondent  by the  attorney  of the Petitioner  merely  orders"
"the 2nd Respondent to inform the Petitioner in writing within five working days, that the"
"impugned  land  is  not  a  “paddy  land”.  This  letter  cannot  be  considered  a  request  to"
"reconsider  the  previous  decision.  There  is  no  indication  that  the  Petitioners  current"
"position  (contention  that  the 
impugned 
land  had  not  been  a  paddy 
land  and/or 
is"
"unsuitable 
for  paddy  cultivation)  or 
the 
supporting  material  had  been 
formally"
"submitted to the Respondents for consideration."
"40. Under 
the  provisions  of 
the  Agrarian  Development  Act  No.  46  0f  2000 
the  1st"
"Respondent  is  vested  with  discretion  to  determine  whether  a  land  is  a  paddy  land  or"
"not. 
In  Sri  Lankan 
jurisprudence, 
it 
is  a  well-established  principle 
that  a  writ  of"
"mandamus cannot be issued to compel the performance of acts or duties that involve"
"the  exercise  of  discretion  by  public  authorities.  This  principle  has  been  affirmed 
in"
"Selvamani  vs  Dr.  Kumaravelupillai,  2005  2  Sri  LR  99,  Rev.  Seruwila  Sarankithi  and"
"others  Vs  the  Attorney  General  and  others  2004  (1)  SLR  365  and  Dheerasena  v  Post"
"Master and Others, 2008 1 Sri LR 349."
"41. A  writ  might  lie  against  the  manner  in  which  the  Respondents  has  exercised  the  said"
"discretion, in the event such an application was made. However, in the instance case, no"
"application  has  been  made.  As  such  Respondents  cannot  be  compelled  to  decide  that"
"the impugned land is “paddy land” through a writ of Mandamus."
