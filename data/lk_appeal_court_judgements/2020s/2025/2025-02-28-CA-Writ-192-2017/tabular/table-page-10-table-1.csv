"","33. Although  no  formal  objection  appears  to  have  been  taken,  the  Court  has  varyingly"
"","considered this submission as a preliminary objection as well as a preliminary issue. The"
"","Petitioner  has  filed  two  separate  written  submissions  regarding  this  matter  and  one"
"","written submission has been filed on behalf of the Respondents. Afterwards, this matter"

"","compelling  reason  given  for  the  request  to  forward  this  Application  to  the  Provincial"
"","Court. It appears that an argument  had been developed  that the Provincial Court may"
"","be better  equipped  to handle  matters  of  this nature  because  of their proximity to  the"
"","issue. Considering the circumstances of this Application, I am of the view that there is no"
"such  necessity.  On  the  above  considerations","I  dismiss  the  request  to  forward  this"
"Application to the Provincial Court.",""
