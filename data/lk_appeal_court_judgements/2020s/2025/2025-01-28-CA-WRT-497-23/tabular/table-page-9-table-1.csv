"Learned Counsel for both parties restricted the argument to the following"
"question of law."
"When the capital to be recovered is less than Rs. Five million as at the date"
"of resolution, can the bank resort to prate execution?”"
"Before we part with this judgment, we are mindful of the sentiments expressed by His"
"Lordship Samayawardhena J with regard to the Recovery of Loans by Banks under the"
"Recovery of Loans by Banks Act in Bettans Group of Companies (Pvt) Ltd v. Lankaputhra"
"Development Bank and Others, CA/WRIT 230/2015, Decided on 10.07.2020 held that;"
"“Before  I part  with  this  Judgment let me  also add  the  following.  The Petitioner"
"cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court as of right. It is a discretionary"
"relief; an act of grace on the part of the Court. The fact that the loan was obtained"
"and the Petitioner is in default is undisputed. By this application, filed more than"
"five  years  ago,  the  Petitioner  has  prevented  the  Bank  from  recovering  its  dues"
"through parate  execution-a  quicker  and  faster  procedure  recognised  by  the  law."
"Banks are not charitable institutions; they are the cornerstones of economies. It"
"should be understood that similar to the Petitioner being engaged in a business,"
"granting  loans  with  the  expectation  of  timely  repayment  is  a  major  part  of  the"
"ordinary  course  of  business  of  a  Bank.  If  a  Bank  is  prevented  from  taking  such"
"measures as it is entitled in law to take to protect its interests, the economy of the"
"country would suffer. The Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act was"
"passed  to  assist  Banks  to  fast-track  the  procedure  of  debt  recovery.  There  is  no"
"place for high-flown technical objections under this Act.”"
