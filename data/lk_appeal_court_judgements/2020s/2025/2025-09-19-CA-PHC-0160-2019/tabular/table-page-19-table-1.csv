"0.1887  Hectares  (1 Rood,  34.60  Perches)  as  morefully,  shown  and  depicted  in"
"the Extract bearing No. 2016/42 made and prepared by A. H. K. Wijayathilake,"
"Surveyor attached to Land Commissioner’s Department as being a part of lot 1"
"of the plan bearing No. PPA1756 made and prepared by Surveyor-General."
"Hence, the Appellant’s argument that the land had not been properly identified"
"by  the  2nd  Respondent  being  the  competent  authority  cannot  sustain  at  least,"
"for  two  reasons;  one  being  that,  she  is  precluded  by  sections  9(1)  and  9(2)  of"
"the  Act  from  raising  such  a  contest  as  to  the  identity  of  the  land-the  subject"
"matter  of  the  application  made  to  Court  by  the  2nd  Respondent  being  the"
"competent  authority;  the  other  being  that  although  the  2nd  Respondent-being"
"the  competent  authority  does  not  have  any  burden  in  an  inquiry  before  the"
"Magistrate  so  to  do,  nevertheless,  the 
land 
in  dispute  had  been  properly"
"identified by the 2nd Respondent being the competent authority with reference"
"to a plan previously, made and prepared by the Surveyor-General and then, by"
"the  extract  made  and  prepared  by 
the  Surveyor  attached 
to 
the  Land"
"Commissioner’s Department."
"Conversely, 
the  Appellant  had  not  even  made  any  attempt  at 
least, 
to"
"superimpose  the  land  claimed  by  her  as  a  private  land  belonging  to  her  as"
"aforesaid on the State Land as morefully shown and depicted in those two plan"
"and the extract as enumerated above to establish her assertion that it was not"
"a 
State 
Land 
called 
“Thambilikotuwewatta” 
but, 
the 
land 
called"
"“Divulgahakumbura now, highland”."
"On  the  other  hand,  the  2nd  Respondent  being  the  competent  authority  had"
"already formed the opinion that the land-the subject matter of the application,"
"is  a  State  Land  and  that  the  Appellant 
is 
in  unauthorized  possession  or"
"occupation  therein.  However,  it  is  significant  to  observe  that,  not  an  iota  of"
"evidence  had  been  adduced  by  the  Appellant  to  establish  that  she 
is 
in"
"possession or occupation of the State Land upon a valid permit or other written"
"authority  of  the  State,  granted  in  accordance  with  any  written  law  and  that"
