"is  not  liable  to  be  ejected  from  the  land  belonging  to  her.  and  therefore,  it"
"should be dismissed."
"However,  the  learned  Additional  Magistrate  of  Kurunegala  in  his  order  dated"
"11.05.2018 had having rejected the showing cause of the Appellant, proceeded"
"to grant the application directing eviction of the Appellant from the State Land"
"by  inter-alia,  holding  that  the  Appellant  too,  who  had  maintained  that  the  2nd"
"Respondent  had  not  properly,    identified  the  State  Land,  had  not  properly,"
"identified  the 
land  claimed  by  her,  namely; 
‘Divulgahakumbura  presently,"
"highland’ by way of a plan prepared by a Surveyor."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order  of  the 
learned  Additional  Magistrate  of"
"Kurunegala  dated  11.05.2018,  the  Appellant  had  invoked  the  extra-ordinary"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of the North Central Province holden"
"in Kurunegala seeking to revise and set aside it. Learned High Court Judge of"
"the  North  Central  Province  holden 
in  Kurunegala  had  by  the  order  dated"
"04.10.2019,  dismissed  the  application  in  revision  by  holding  that  the  order"
"sought  to  be  revised  is  not  contrary  to  law.  Hence,  the  instant  appeal  arises"
"therefrom."
"The  principal    position  so  adverted  to  by  the  Appellant  before  the  Magistrate"
"Court of Kurunegala is that the land in question is not a state land as referred"
"to in the said application made to it by the 2nd Respondent under Section 5 of"
"the 
Act, 
namely; 
“Thambilikotuwewatta” 
but, 
a 
private 
land 
called"
"“Divulgahakumbura  now,  high  land”  as  referred  to  in  the  title  deeds  marked"
"(X6 and X7) and relied on by the Appellant which according to her, belongs to"
"her  in  terms  of  the  pedigree  pleaded  in  her  showing  cause  in  the  Magistrate"
"Court  of  Kurunegala,  and  in  the  circumstances,  the  2nd  Respondent  had  not"
"identified the land in question correctly, and as such the Appellant is not liable"
"to  be  ejected 
therefrom  and 
therefore, 
the  said  application  ought 
to  be"
"dismissed."
