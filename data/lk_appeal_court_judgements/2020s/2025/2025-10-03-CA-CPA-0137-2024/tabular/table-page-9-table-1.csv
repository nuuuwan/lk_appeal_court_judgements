"and 
to  deliver  procession 
thereof 
to 
the  Aggrieved  Party.  However, 
it 
is"
"significant  to  observe  that  the  Petitioner  had  not  opted  to  canvas  the  order  of"
"the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P8) before the Provincial High Court of"
"Southern Province holden at Hambantota."
"Hence, the third Eviction order so issued on the Petitioner (P6) by the Assistant"
"Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development  under  section  8(1)  of  the  Act"
"and the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota made under section 8(2)"
"of  the  Act 
in  pursuant  to  written  report  presented  to 
it  by  the  Assistant"
"Commissioner  General 
of  Agrarian  Development  directing 
the  Fiscal 
to"
"forthwith  evict  the  Petitioner  from  the  occupation  of  the  extent  of  paddy  land"
"and  to  deliver  possession  thereof  to  the  Aggrieved  Party,  too,  still  remain"
"unchallenged and uncontroverted."
"Besides, the Petitioner had in paragraphs 23 (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of his petition"
"tendered  to  the  High  Court  of  Hambantota  along  with  the  revision  application"
"bearing No. 19/24 filed before it by him, a certified copy of which was annexed"
"to  the  petition  filed  before  us  by  the  Petitioner  marked  as  P12,  clearly,  and"
"unequivocally, admitted the legal validity of all three Eviction orders issued by"
"the  Assistant  Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development  both  on  his"
"father  and  on  him 
(P1,  P2  and  P6),  and  the  order  made  by  the 
learned"
"Magistrate of Hambantota (P8) as enumerated above."
"It  is  thus,  abundantly,  clear  that  the  Petitioner  in  the  application  in  revision"
"filed by him before the High Court of Hambantota, had never sought to canvas"
"before it the legality and/or the validity  of the Eviction order so issued on the"
"Petitioner (P6) by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development"
"under section 8(1) of the Act or the principal order of the learned Magistrate of"
"Hambantota  made

"Assistant  Commissioner  General
