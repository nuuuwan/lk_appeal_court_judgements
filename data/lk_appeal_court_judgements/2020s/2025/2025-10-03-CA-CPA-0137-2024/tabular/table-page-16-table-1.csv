"section  8(1)  thereof  by  the  Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development"
"seeking an order for Eviction under section 8(2) of the Act, of the person from"
"the occupation of the extent of paddy land and to deliver possession thereof, to"
"the person specified in the written report presented to Court by him."
"In the result, I would hold that the contention as enumerated above cannot in"
"any manner, sustain both in fact and law and as such it ought to be dismissed"
"in-limine for the reasons stated above."
"Besides, it is a well established principle in law, that one who is decreed by a"
"Court  of  competent  jurisdiction  to  be  a  victor,  has  all  the  legitimate  rights  to"
"reap the fruits of his victory, forthwith and without any delay. Hence, there is"
"nothing 
in 
law  to  prevent  or  deprive  of  the  Aggrieved  Party  to  whom  the"
"possession  of  the  extent  of  the  paddy 
land  as  morefully  described 
in  the"
"schedule 
to 
the  written 
report 
(P7)  made 
to  Court  by 
the  Assistant"
"Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development,  had  been  directed  to  be"
"handed  over  by 
the  Fiscal  by 
forthwith  evicting 
the  Petitioner 
from 
the"
"occupation 
thereof, 
to  make  an  application 
to 
the  Magistrate  Court  of"
"Hambantota  seeking  immediate  execution  of  the  Eviction  order  already,  made"
"in her favour by Court against the Petitioner without any further delay for;  the"
"Aggrieved  Party  being  one  who  is  so  decreed  by  the  learned  Magistrate  of"
"Hambantota to be a victor, has all the legitimate rights to reap the fruits of his"
"victory, forthwith and without any delay."
"I  would  therefore,  hold  that  the  contention  so  advanced  by  the  Petitioner  as"
"enumerated above, is not entitled to succeed both in fact and law, and as such"
"it should be rejected on this ground too."
"In the light of the above, I would hold that the contention so advanced by the"
"Petitioner as enumerated above, ought to be rejected in-limine."
"b)  Both  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Hambantota  as  well  as  the"
"learned  Magistrate  of  Hambantota  had 
failed 
to  consider 
that 
the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development 
is 
the  authority 
to"
