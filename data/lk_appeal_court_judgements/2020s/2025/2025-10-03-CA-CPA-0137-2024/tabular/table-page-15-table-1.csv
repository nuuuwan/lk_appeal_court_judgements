"been made by the Aggrieved Party (P10), seeking to evict the Petitioner from the"
"possession of the entire extent of paddy land including the house and the high"
"land  and  to  deliver  possession  thereof  to  the  Aggrieved  Party  in  terms  of  the"
"section  101  of  the  Act;  and  that  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Hambantota  had"
"made order (P11) directing the Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the"
"occupation  of  the  extent  of  the  paddy  land  as  morefully,  described  in  the"
"schedule 
to 
the  written  report  presented  by 
the  Assistant  Commissioner"
"General of Agrarian Development to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota under"
"section  8(1)  of  the  Act  (P7)  and  to  deliver  possession  thereof,  to  the  person"
"specified therein, namely; the Aggrieved Party."
"Hence, it becomes manifestly, clear that what the Aggrieved Party did was that,"
"the  Aggrieved  Party  had  by  the  said  ex-parte  application  dated  30.09.2024,"
"urged 
the  order  of 
the 
learned  Magistrate  dated  26.08.2024 
(P8) 
to  be"
"forthwith,  executed  by  the  Fiscal  and  hence,  the  said  ex-parte  application"
"cannot in any manner, be construed in law, as an application made to Court by"
"the  Aggrieved  Party  under  section  8(1)  of  the  Act 
for;  such  an  order  had"
"already,  been  made  by  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Hambantota  under  section"
"8(2)  of  the  Act 
in  consequent  to  the  written  report 
filed  before 
it  by  the"
"Assistant  the  Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development  under  section"
"8(1) of the Act."
"It  thus,  clearly,  appears  to  me  that  such  a  contention  as  advanced  by  the"
"Petitioner 
as 
enumerated 
above,  had  been 
advanced  by  him 
in 
total"
"misapprehension and/or in total misconception of the nature of the application"
"made to the learned Magistrate of Hambantota by the Aggrieved Party in his ex-"
"parte application dated 30.09.2024 (P10), as well as of the precise nature of the"
"order  made  by  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Hambantota  (P11)  consequent  upon"
"the  said  application  (P10)  made  to  Court  by  the  Aggrieved  Party  in  that  the"
"Petitioner  had  totally,  mistaken  the  precise  nature  of  the  ex-parte  application"
"made  to  Court  by  the  Aggrieved  Party  seeking  execution  of  the  order  already,"
"made  by  Court  under  section  8(2)  of  the  Act  for  one  that  may  be  made  under"
