The instant application in revision arises from an order of the Learned High

Court Judge of the Southern Province holden at Hambantota dated

10.10.2024, a certified copy of which was annexed thereto marked as P13

(hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the order’) whereby, the learned High

Court Judge had dismissed the application in revision filed before it by the

Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the

Petitioner’) against the order of the Learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated

30.09.2024, a certified copy of which was annexed thereto marked as P11

whereby, the Learned Magistrate had upon an application made thereto by the

Aggrieved Party-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to as

‘the Aggrieved Party’) directed the Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner from

the Land and premises in extent of 04 Acres 02 Roods 22 Perches together with

the residential house standing thereon being the subject matter as morefully,

described in the schedule to the written report filed thereat under and in terms

of the provisions of section 8(1) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000

(as amended) (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the Act’) by the Applicant-

Aggrieved Party mentioned in the written report as the person to whom delivery

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 5 of 21

objections of his to the instant application in revision, while, the learned State

Counsel for the Applicant had submitted to Court that, the State was not

intending to file objections to the principle matter. (Vide-Minutes of Court

dated 11.03.2025)

This case has a chequered history. In terms of what has been averred by the

Petitioner in paragraphs 4 to 12 and 15 of his petition, a) the aggrieved party

had lodged a complaint under and in terms of the provisions of Section 18 (1)

and 26(1) of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 as amended by Act No.

04 of 1991 to the Commissioner of the Agricultural Services, Hambantota

complaining that Simon Appu Amarawickrama, the Petitioner's father, who was

said to be the tenant-cultivator of the said paddy land had defaulted in the

payment of the rent (ȝෙɩƝය ʏගකර ඇƯ බව.); that b) in pursuant to the

complaint lodged by the 1st Respondent, an inquiry bearing No ȝ/86/1129 was

commenced and at the conclusion of the said inquiry, it was determined that

Simon Appu Amarawickrama, the father of the Petitioner, has defaulted in the

payment of rent; that c) subsequent to the inquiry, Eviction Order dated

12.06.1996 a copy of which was annexed to the petition marked as P1, was

issued on Simon Appu Amarawickrama to evict him from the extent of paddy

land in extent of 04 Acres 02 Roods 22 Perches under and in terms of section

18 (2) (3) of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 as amended by Act No. 04

of 1991 for non-payment of rent; that d) subsequent to the death of his father

Simon Appu Amarawickrama, on 18.11.2013, the Petitioner was issued an

Eviction order under the provisions of section 08 of the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended to vacate the land on or before 19.12. 2013, a

copy of which was annexed to the petition marked as P2; that e) the Petitioner

had instituted a Writ Application seeking a writ of certiorari in the Provincial

High Court of Hambantota bearing case No. HCWA12/2013 challenging the

said Eviction Order (P2) and the learned High Court judge had by the order

(P3), dismissed the said Application and thereafter, the Petitioner had appealed

to the Court of Appeal challenging the said High Court Order and the Court of

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 6 of 21

Appeal by its order, (P4), dismissed the Appeal and thereafter, the Petitioner

had preferred a Special Leave to Appeal Application against the said Court of

Appeal Judgment and the Supreme Court had by its order P5, dismissed the

said Application; that f) consequent to the dismissal of the said Special Leave

to Appeal Application by the Supreme Court, the Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Development issued an Eviction Order dated 25.03.2024, a copy of

which was annexed to the petition marked as P6, against the Petitioner to

vacate the land on or before 10.04.2024, in terms of Section 8 of the Act; that

g) since the petitioner did not vacate the land as per the said Eviction Order,

the Assistant Commissioner for Agrarian Development had filed a written

report in the case bearing No. 4904/2024/S in the Magistrate's Court of

Hambantota-a copy of which was annexed to the petition marked as P7,

seeking to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the extent of the paddy land- in

extent of 04 Acres 02 Roods 22 Perches as morefully, described in the schedule

to the written report (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the extent of paddy

land’) and to deliver the possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party; that h) the

Learned Magistrate had having considered the written report (P7), made an

Order on 26.08.2024, a copy of which was annexed to the petition marked P8,

to evict the Petitioner from the extent of the paddy land-as morefully, described

in the schedule to the written report and to deliver possession thereof to the

Aggrieved Party; that i) consequent to the Order of the Learned Magistrate of

Hambantota (P8), the Fiscal of the Court who had proceeded to the extent of

paddy land on 10.09.2024 for execution of the eviction order as directed by

Court, had without evicting the Petitioner, submitted a report, a copy of which

was annexed to the petition marked as P9, stating that there is a large house

and other mixed cultivations in addition to the paddy cultivation in the extent

of paddy land and there is no reference in the written report to the house and

highland and thereby, seeking clarifications from the Court regarding the

inhabitants of the house and highland from the said report; that j) thereafter,

on 30.09.2024, an ex-parte application, a copy of which was annexed to the

petition marked as P10, had been made by the Aggrieved Party seeking to evict

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 7 of 21

the Petitioner from the possession of the entire extent of paddy land including

the house and the high land and to deliver possession thereof to the Aggrieved

Party in terms of the section 101 of the Act; that k) even though there had been

no application made of behalf of the Applicant upon an application made on

behalf of the Aggrieved Party, the learned Magistrate of Hambantota had by his

order dated 30.09.2024, a copy of which was annexed to the petition marked

as P11, directed to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the entire extent of paddy

land in the extent of 4 Acres 2 Roods and 22 Perches including the house and

to deliver possession thereof, to the Aggrieved Party. It is this order that the

Petitioner had in the application in revision bearing No. HCRA 19/24 preferred

by him to the Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden at

Hambantota, sought to revise and set aside. However, the learned High Court

Judge of Hambantota had proceeded to dismiss it by inter-alia holding that the

Petitioner has not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances for the Court to

interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P11).

It is significant to observe, that according to his own pleadings of the Petitioner,

three eviction orders had been issued by the Assistant Commissioner General

of Agrarian Development in respect of the same extent of paddy land as

morefully, described in the schedule to the written report filed by the Assistant

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development in the instant case filed in the

Magistrate Court of Hambantota (P6) on three different occasions, the first of

which was on the said Simon Appu Amarawickrama- father of the Petitioner of

the instant application as far back as on 12.06.1996, (P1) under the provisions

of the Agrarian Services Act as amended and the other two were on the

Petitioner himself (P2 and P6) under the provisions of 8(1) of the Agrarian

Development Act as amended.

It is important to observe that there was no material on the record to show that

the said Simon Appu Amarawickrama had canvassed before any Court the

eviction order so issued on him as far back as on 12.06.1996, (P1) until his

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 8 of 21

death and therefore, it remained unchallenged and uncontroverted until upto

his death.

However, the Petitioner had invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court of Southern Province holden at Hambantota in the case bearing No.

HCWA 12/2013 seeking a writ of certiorari quashing the second eviction order

dated 18.11.2013 issued by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development under section 8(1) of the Act on the Petitioner in the instant

application in revision subsequent to the death of his father, Simon Appu

Amarawickrama and the High Court of Hambantota had in its order (P3),

dismissed the same and the appeal preferred therefrom to the Court of Appeal

challenging the said order of the High Court was also dismissed by the Court of

Appeal by its order (P4) and the special leave to appeal application filed before

the Supreme Court seeking leave to appeal from the Order of the Court of

Appeal too, had been refused by the Supreme Court by its order (P5). Hence,

the second Eviction order so issued by the Assistant Commissioner General of

Agrarian Development (P2) still, remain valid and in force.

However, it is strange to observe that while, the second Eviction order so

issued on the Petitioner, by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development (P2) was still, in force and valid as enumerated above, he had

without taking steps to present to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota a

written report on the strength of the second Eviction order for eviction of the

Petitioner from the extent of paddy land, nevertheless proceeded to issue a

fresh Eviction order dated 25.03.2024 (P6) on the Petitioner under the

provisions of section 8(1) of the Act thereby, directing the Petitioner to vacate

the extent of paddy land on or before 10.04.2024, and since, the Petitioner did

not vacate the extent of paddy land as directed, the Assistant Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development had presented to the Magistrate Court of

Hambantota a written report under section 8(1) of the Act (P7) and the learned

Magistrate of Hambantota had by his order dated 26.08.2024 (P8), directed

Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner in occupation of the extent of paddy land

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 9 of 21

and to deliver procession thereof to the Aggrieved Party. However, it is

significant to observe that the Petitioner had not opted to canvas the order of

the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P8) before the Provincial High Court of

Southern Province holden at Hambantota.

Hence, the third Eviction order so issued on the Petitioner (P6) by the Assistant

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development under section 8(1) of the Act

and the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota made under section 8(2)

of the Act in pursuant to written report presented to it by the Assistant

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development directing the Fiscal to

forthwith evict the Petitioner from the occupation of the extent of paddy land

and to deliver possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party, too, still remain

unchallenged and uncontroverted.

Besides, the Petitioner had in paragraphs 23 (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of his petition

tendered to the High Court of Hambantota along with the revision application

bearing No. 19/24 filed before it by him, a certified copy of which was annexed

to the petition filed before us by the Petitioner marked as P12, clearly, and

unequivocally, admitted the legal validity of all three Eviction orders issued by

the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development both on his

father and on him (P1, P2 and P6), and the order made by the learned

Magistrate of Hambantota (P8) as enumerated above.

It is thus, abundantly, clear that the Petitioner in the application in revision

filed by him before the High Court of Hambantota, had never sought to canvas

before it the legality and/or the validity of the Eviction order so issued on the

Petitioner (P6) by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development

under section 8(1) of the Act or the principal order of the learned Magistrate of

Hambantota made in pursuant to written report presented to it by the

Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development (P8), but, a

consequential order made by the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P11)

directing Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the occupation of the

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 10 of 21

extent of paddy land and to deliver possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party

consequent upon an application made thereto by the Aggrieved Party (P10),

and the order made by the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota

(P13)dismissing the application in revision filed by the Petitioner against the

order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P11) made subsequent to his

principal order (P8) delivered under section 8(2) of the Act. [Emphasis is mine]

It is in this context, I would think it expedient at this juncture to examine the

facts and circumstances as averred in the petition filed by the Petitioner before

the High Court of Hambantota (P12) which according to him, led him to have

preferred the application in revision bearing No. HCRA 19/24 before it.

It may now, be examined.

Fiscal of the Court who had proceeded to the extent of paddy land on

10.09.2024 for execution of the eviction order as directed by Court, had

without evicting the Petitioner, submitted a report to Court, a copy of which

was annexed to the petition marked as P9, stating that there is a large house

and other mixed cultivations in addition to the paddy cultivation in the extent

of paddy land and there is no reference in the written report to the house and

highland and thereby, seeking clarifications from the Court regarding the

inhabitants of the house and highland from the said report. In the result, an

ex-parte application, a copy of which was annexed to the petition marked as

P10, had been made to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota, by the Aggrieved

Party on 30.09.2024, seeking to evict the Petitioner from the possession of the

entire extent of paddy land including the house and the high land and to

deliver possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party in terms of the section 101 of

the Act and consequent upon the application so made by the Aggrieved Party

(P10), the learned Magistrate of Hambantota had by his order dated

30.09.2024, a copy of which was annexed to the petition marked as P11,

directed to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the entire extent of paddy land in

the extent of 4 Acres 2 Roods and 22 Perches including the house and to

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 11 of 21

deliver possession thereof, to the Aggrieved Party. It is this order that the

Petitioner had in the application in revision bearing No. HCRA 19/24 preferred

by him to the Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden at

Hambantota, sought to revise and set aside. However, the learned High Court

Judge of Hambantota had proceeded to dismiss it by inter-alia holding that the

Petitioner had not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances for the Court

to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P11).

The Petitioner in the instant application in revision seeks to revise and set

aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota (P13) as well as

the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P11) on the following

grounds as morefully, enumerated in paragraph 22 (a) to (h) of the petition of

the Petitioner which according to him, constitute exceptional circumstances

warranting this Court to exercise its extra-ordinary revisionary jurisdiction

vested in it under Article 138 of the Constitution in revision of both of those

two orders, and they may be reproduced verbatim the same as follows;

“a. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the order of

the Learned Magistrate dated 30.09.2024 is contrary to the law;

b. The Learned Magistrate of Hambantota made an order in case bearing

number 4904/24/S on 30.09.2024 (P11) to evict the Petitioner from his

house considering the application made by the Aggrieved Party

Respondent-Respondent however the aggrieved party does not have such

authority to make such application which is bad in law;

c. The Learned Magistrate of Hambantota has not considered any

evidence and valid documents when make the order in case bearing

number 4904 /24/S on 30.09.2024 (P11) which is bad in law;

d. The Learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have failed

to consider that under the section 8 (1) and 8 (2) of the Agrarian

Development Act, the learned Magistrate has the power only to execute

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 12 of 21

the decision of the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development;

e. The Learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have failed

to consider that the Commissioner General is the authority to identified

the paddy land which is in dispute and without his opinion and or

clarification the learned Magistrate has no power to make eviction orders

contrary to the contents in the application filed by the Assistant

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development before the Magistrate

Court;

f. The Learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have failed

to consider that the section 8 of the Agrarian Development Act does not

provide for the Aggrieved Party to make request for an Eviction Order or

to make request to amend an Eviction Order requested by the

Commissioner General;

g. The Learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have failed

to consider that it is contrary to the law to decide without instructions

from the Commission General whether the Eviction Order dated

25.03.2024 was issued by the Assistant - Commissioner for the Agrarian

development, only for the paddy land or the house of the Petitioner where

the Petitioner had been residing for over 50 years and the agricultural

highland were included in the subject property;

h. The learned High Court judge has failed to consider that the learned

Magistrate when he made the order dated 30.09.2024 (P11) has relied on

the report of the Fiscal dated 10.09.2024 where it was stated that it can

be observed that the highland (ෙගʣඩ ඉඩම) is clearly a part and parcel of

the land named as a paddy land which is clearly violation of law as only

the Commissioner General can decide whether the dry land is a part of

the paddy land.”

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 13 of 21

Hence, the principal ground of attack of both of those two orders appears to be

two-fold, namely;

a) Both the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota as well as the learned

Magistrate of Hambantota had failed to consider that under the section

8(1) and (2) of the Act, the learned Magistrate has the power only to

execute the decision of the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development and hence, the order of the learned Magistrate of

Hambantota dated 30.09.2024 (P11) is bad in law inasmuch as the order

is based on an application made to Court (P10) by the Aggrieved Party

seeking eviction of the Petitioner from the occupation of the extent of the

paddy land and to deliver the possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party,

for; the Aggrieved Party has no authority to make an application as such

to Court, but, in terms of section 8(1) of the Act, it is the Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development who has lawful authority to make an

application to Court seeking eviction of a person from the occupation of

the extent of the paddy land and to deliver the possession thereof to the

person specified in the written report presented to Magistrate Court by

the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development under section 8(1) of

the Act;

b) Both the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota as well as the learned

Magistrate of Hambantota had failed to consider that the Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development is the authority to identify the paddy

land which is in dispute and without his opinion and/or clarification, the

learned Magistrate has no power to make Eviction order contrary to the

contents in the application filed by the Commissioner General of

Agrarian Development before the Magistrate Court under section 8(1) of

the Act.

The grounds of attack so enumerated above, would I think, call for separate

treatment.

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 14 of 21

a) Both the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota as well as the learned

Magistrate of Hambantota had failed to consider that under the section 8(1) and

(2) of the Act, the learned Magistrate has the power only to execute the decision

of the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development and hence, the order of

the learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated 30.09.2024 (P11) is bad in law

inasmuch as the order is based on an application made to Court (P10) by the

Aggrieved Party seeking eviction of the Petitioner from the occupation of the

extent of the paddy land and to deliver the possession thereof to the Aggrieved

Party, for; the Aggrieved Party has no authority to make an application as such

to Court, but, in terms of section 8(1) of the Act, it is the Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development who has lawful authority to make an

application to Court seeking eviction of a person from the occupation of the

extent of the paddy land and to deliver the possession thereof to the person

specified in the written report presented to Magistrate Court by the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development under section 8(1) of the Act;

It may now, be examined.

It is undisputed fact, that Eviction order dated 26.08.2024 had been made by

the learned Magistrate of Hambantota under section 8(2) of the Act directing

the Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the occupation of the extent of

the paddy land as morefully, described in the schedule to the written report

presented by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development to

the Magistrate Court of Hambantota under section 8(1) of the Act (P7) and to

deliver possession thereof, to the person specified therein, namely; the

Aggrieved Party; and that, the Fiscal of the Court who had proceeded to the

extent of paddy land on 10.09.2024 for execution of the eviction order as

directed by Court, had without evicting the Petitioner, submitted a report (P9),

stating that there is a large house and other mixed cultivations in addition to

the paddy cultivation in the extent of paddy land and there is no reference in

the written report to the house and highland and thereby, seeking clarifications

from the Court regarding the inhabitants of the house and highland from the

said report; and that thereafter, on 30.09.2024, an ex-parte application had

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 15 of 21

been made by the Aggrieved Party (P10), seeking to evict the Petitioner from the

possession of the entire extent of paddy land including the house and the high

land and to deliver possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party in terms of the

section 101 of the Act; and that the learned Magistrate of Hambantota had

made order (P11) directing the Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner from the

occupation of the extent of the paddy land as morefully, described in the

schedule to the written report presented by the Assistant Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota under

section 8(1) of the Act (P7) and to deliver possession thereof, to the person

specified therein, namely; the Aggrieved Party.

Hence, it becomes manifestly, clear that what the Aggrieved Party did was that,

the Aggrieved Party had by the said ex-parte application dated 30.09.2024,

urged the order of the learned Magistrate dated 26.08.2024 (P8) to be

forthwith, executed by the Fiscal and hence, the said ex-parte application

cannot in any manner, be construed in law, as an application made to Court by

the Aggrieved Party under section 8(1) of the Act for; such an order had

already, been made by the learned Magistrate of Hambantota under section

8(2) of the Act in consequent to the written report filed before it by the

Assistant the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development under section

8(1) of the Act.

It thus, clearly, appears to me that such a contention as advanced by the

Petitioner as enumerated above, had been advanced by him in total

misapprehension and/or in total misconception of the nature of the application

made to the learned Magistrate of Hambantota by the Aggrieved Party in his ex-

parte application dated 30.09.2024 (P10), as well as of the precise nature of the

order made by the learned Magistrate of Hambantota (P11) consequent upon

the said application (P10) made to Court by the Aggrieved Party in that the

Petitioner had totally, mistaken the precise nature of the ex-parte application

made to Court by the Aggrieved Party seeking execution of the order already,

made by Court under section 8(2) of the Act for one that may be made under

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 16 of 21

section 8(1) thereof by the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development

seeking an order for Eviction under section 8(2) of the Act, of the person from

the occupation of the extent of paddy land and to deliver possession thereof, to

the person specified in the written report presented to Court by him.

In the result, I would hold that the contention as enumerated above cannot in

any manner, sustain both in fact and law and as such it ought to be dismissed

in-limine for the reasons stated above.

Besides, it is a well established principle in law, that one who is decreed by a

Court of competent jurisdiction to be a victor, has all the legitimate rights to

reap the fruits of his victory, forthwith and without any delay. Hence, there is

nothing in law to prevent or deprive of the Aggrieved Party to whom the

possession of the extent of the paddy land as morefully described in the

schedule to the written report (P7) made to Court by the Assistant

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development, had been directed to be

handed over by the Fiscal by forthwith evicting the Petitioner from the

occupation thereof, to make an application to the Magistrate Court of

Hambantota seeking immediate execution of the Eviction order already, made

in her favour by Court against the Petitioner without any further delay for; the

Aggrieved Party being one who is so decreed by the learned Magistrate of

Hambantota to be a victor, has all the legitimate rights to reap the fruits of his

victory, forthwith and without any delay.

I would therefore, hold that the contention so advanced by the Petitioner as

enumerated above, is not entitled to succeed both in fact and law, and as such

it should be rejected on this ground too.

In the light of the above, I would hold that the contention so advanced by the

Petitioner as enumerated above, ought to be rejected in-limine.

b) Both the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota as well as the

learned Magistrate of Hambantota had failed to consider that the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development is the authority to

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 17 of 21

identify the paddy land which is in dispute and without his opinion

and/or clarification, the learned Magistrate has no power to make

Eviction order contrary to the contents in the application filed by the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development before the Magistrate

Court under section 8(1) of the Act.

It may now, be considered.

The Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development had in his

written report presented to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota (P7) seeking

eviction of the Petitioner from the extent of paddy land and to deliver

possession thereof to the person specified therein, namely; the Aggrieved Party,

specified and described the extent of the paddy land-the subject matter

pertaining to his application with precision and definiteness as follows;

“හȼබǦෙතʣට ǎස්Ƶúකෙɏ අȼබලǦෙතʣට ෙගʣɪජන ෙසʢවා බල ȝෙǊශෙɏ ʆයඹලාගසස්ɪල Ğාම ǧලධාɝ වසෙම ȘʏŹ, උƱරට - ෙලʣŸ 152 ඉඩමද නැෙගනʏර - ෙලʣŸ 153 ඉඩමද දýණට - ෙලʣŸ 157 ඉඩමද බස්නාʏරට - ෙලʣŸ 137 පාර හා ඇලද මාඉȼ ɬ පɢෙɢ බැරගම බැǊද ෙනʣෙහʣƮ අඹගහýɉර නැමැƯ අúකර 04 ɞƊ 2 පə. 22 ýɉɞ ඉඩම ෙɩ.” Hence, the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated 26.08.2024,

(P8) made under section 8(2) of the Act pertains to the extent of paddy land as

morefully, described in the schedule to the written report presented to Court by

the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development under section 8(1) of the

Act and it is this extent of paddy land as precisely, described in the schedule

thereto, occupation from which the order (P8) directs that the Petitioner be

forthwith evicted and the possession thereof be delivered to the Aggrieved

Party.

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 18 of 21

In the result, extent of paddy land to which the order (P8) pertains had

properly, been identified by the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Development as a land morefully, described in the schedule to the written

report presented to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota (P7).

Hence, it is obvious, that it is from this extent of paddy land as precisely,

described in the schedule to the written report presented to the Magistrate

Court of Hambantota by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development (P6) that the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated

30.09.2024 (P11) made consequent upon to the ex-parte application presented

to Court by the Aggrieved Party (P10) seeking only for execution of the said

order, had directed the Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner and to deliver the

possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party. [Emphasis is mine]

In the result, it clearly, appears to me that the question of identity of the extent

of the paddy land or the question of amendment of the Eviction order did not in

any manner, arise before the learned Magistrate of Hambantota when he had

in his order (P11), made consequent upon to the ex-parte application presented

to Court by the Aggrieved Party (P10) seeking only for execution of the said

order, directed the Fiscal to forthwith evict the Petitioner and to deliver the

possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party, for; the extent of the paddy land had

been precisely, identified by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development not only, in his Eviction order (P6) but also in the written report

presented to the Magistrate Court of Hambantota (P7). [Emphasis is mine]

As a matter of law, it is to be observed that, in terms of the definition of the

phrase “Paddy land” given in section 101 of the Act, it includes a portion of a

paddy land used for constructing his dwelling house of the cultivator as rightly,

observed by both the learned Magistrate of Hambantota in his order dated

30.05.2024 (P11) and the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota

10.10.2024 (P13) thereby, leaving no room for an argument that the portion

where high land and the dwelling house of the cultivator is situated, does not

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 19 of 21

form part of the paddy land as now contended by the Petitioner in the instant

application in revision before us.

Besides, it is significant to observe that the said Simon Appu Amarawickrama-

the Father of the Petitioner, had never raised a challenge to the Eviction order

issued on him by the Commissioner of Agrarian Services as far back as

12.06.1996, (P1) on the basis that, the portion where highland and residential

house is situated, does not form part of the land to which Eviction order relates

as now, contended by the Petitioner-the son of the said Simon Appu

Amarawickrama.

Furthermore, upon a careful scrutiny of the judgments respectively,

pronounced by the High Court of Hambantota exercising its writ jurisdiction

(P3), the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court exercising its appellate

jurisdiction by their respective decisions (P4 and P5) as aforesaid, it clearly,

shows that neither of the Court had so found in favour of the Petitioner that

the portion where highland and residential house is situated, does not form

part of the land to which Eviction order relates as now, sought to be contended

by the Petitioner-the son of the said Simon Appu Amarawickrama.

Moreover, it is significant to observe that the Petitioner had never sought to

challenge the Eviction order issued on him for the second time on 25.03.2024,

by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development (P6) nor, had

he sought so to do when the learned Magistrate of Hambantota had made order

under section 8(2) of the Act (P8) directing Fiscal to forthwith eject the

Petitioner from the occupation of the extent of paddy land as morefully

described in the schedule to the written report presented to Court by the

Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development under section 8(1) of

the Act and to deliver possession thereof to the Aggrieved Party on the basis

that the portion where highland and residential house is situated, does not

form part of the land to which Eviction order relates as now, sought to be

contended by the Petitioner-the son of the said Simon Appu Amarawickrama,

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 20 of 21

instead, in paragraph 23 (i),(ii),(iii) and (iv) of his petition filed in the High Court

of Hambantota in case bearing No. HCRA 19/24 (P12), the Petitioner clearly,

and unequivocally admitted the corpus from which he was directed to be

forthwith ejected and possession thereof to be delivered to the Aggrieved Party,

to be one as rightly, and correctly, described in the Eviction order dated

25.03.2024, by the Assistant Commissioner General of Agrarian Development

(P6).

Furthermore, no iota of evidence had been adduced by the Petitioner in the

Court below to prove his assertion that the portion where highland and

residential house is situated, does not form part of the land to which Eviction

order relates as now, sought to be contended by the Petitioner-the son of the

said Simon Appu Amarawickrama other than a mere statement so uttered by

him.

In view of the foregoing, I would hold that the next, contention so raised by the

Petitioner as enumerated above, too, is not entitled to succeed both in fact and

law and as such it too, should be rejected in-limine.

In the result, I would see no error both in fact and law in the order of the

learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated, 30.09.2024 (P11) as rightly, held by

the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota in his order dated, 10.10.2024

(P13) and therefore, the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota was entirely,

right in refusing to act in revision of the order complained of (P11) on the basis

that there exists no exceptional circumstances to interfere therewith.

In view of all the above circumstances, I would see no legal basis whatsoever,

to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated,

30.09.2024 (P11) and the order of the learned High Court Judge of

Hambantota dated, 10.10.2024 (P13).

Hence, I would hold that this is not a fit and proper case for us to exercise the

extra-ordinary revisionary jurisdiction vested in us in revision of both of those

two orders (P11 and P13).

CA/CPA/0137/2024 Page 21 of 21

In the result, I would refuse to act in revision of the order of the learned

Magistrate of Hambantota dated, 30.09.2024 (P11) and the order of the learned

High Court Judge of Hambantota dated, 10.10.2024 (P13).

I would thus, dismiss the instant application in revision with costs.
