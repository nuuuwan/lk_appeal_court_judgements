"CA/HCC/55/2023"
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel drew our attention that the Appellant was"
"only 19 years when this unfortunate incident had happened. This position"
"was conceded by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General. Although the"
"incident happened in the year 2005, this matter was concluded in the year"
"2023, after about 19 years."
"Hence, considering all the circumstances of this case, I set aside the sentence"
"imposed on the Appellant on the 4th and the 5th counts and substitute with"
"a  term  of  05  years  rigorous  imprisonment  for  the  4th  count  and  05  years"
"rigorous  imprisonment  for  the  5th  count.  I  order  the  sentences  to  run"
"concurrent  to  each  other.  The  fine  and  the  compensation  imposed  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge to remain same."
"As the Appellant is in prison since the date of conviction by the Learned High"
"Court Judge, I order the sentence imposed by this Court be operative from"
"the date conviction, i.e.  27/01/2023."
"Subject to the above variation the appeal is dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Hambantota along with the original case record."
