Judgment

1. The accused–appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the appellant”) was indicted

for the possession and trafficking of 2.24 grams of heroin, offences punishable

under Section 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance,

as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

2. The trial commenced in the High Court of Chilaw, and at the conclusion of the

proceedings, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty of the

charges. Consequently, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to life

imprisonment. It is against this conviction and sentence that the appellant has

lodged the present appeal. The following are the grounds of appeal advanced

by the appellant:

a.The prosecution has not proved the chain of productions;

b. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 lacks credibility;

c.The learned High Court Judge has not given adequate reasons for

rejecting the dock statement; and,

d. The sentence imposed on the appellant is excessive.

3. Onbehalf of the prosecution,three witnessestestified, namely, Lal

Amaratunga (PW1), Shirly Wijesingha (PW2), and the Assistant Government

Analyst, K. Ratnapala (PW12). After the close of the prosecution case, the

appellant made a dock statement.

4. PW2, Shirly Wijesingha, was the first to testify. According to PW2, the raid

was conducted based on information received from Excise Officer No. 698,

Indika. In his testimony, PW2 stated that fourteen officers participated in the

raid, all of whom were in civilian attire. They proceeded to the Chilaw area in

two vehicles, and later, a third vehicle belonging to one of the officers in the

raiding party joined them.

5. At approximately 5:30 p.m., near the Cargills supermarket in Chilaw, they

arrested three suspects: Sinnasamy Velu Ambalagan, Perayamage Pradeep

Kumara, and the driver of the three-wheeler in which they arrived. Heroin was

recovered from the possession of Velu Ambalagan.

6. Upon questioning the suspects, it was revealed that the heroin recovered from

Velu Ambalagan had been supplied by one Hasanthan Rajanathan, who is the

appellant in the present case. It was further disclosed that the appellant was

scheduled to meet the suspects at 6:30 p.m. in Chilaw to collect the proceeds

from the sale of the heroin he had supplied.

7. Accordingly, one of the suspects, Pradeep, who had been arrested near the

Cargills building, was instructed to call the appellant. Following this telephone

call, the appellant arrived at the location and was apprehended by the officers.

Upon conducting a search of the appellant, a small parcel of heroin concealed

under the hem of his undergarment was recovered by the witness.

8. Thereafter, the parcel was sealed, and the officers returned to Colombo with

the three suspects. Upon arrival at the Anti-Narcotic Section of their office, the

contents of the parcel were weighed and re-sealed, bearing the appellant’s

fingerprints. Subsequently, the appellant, along with the productions, was

produced before the Magistrate’s Court of Chilaw.

9. In drug-related cases, contradictions within the prosecution’s evidence, or

between the prosecution and the defense, can seriously undermine the

prosecution’s case and may even lead to an acquittal. While minor

inconsistencies are generally immaterial, major discrepancies can impair the

credibility of witnesses and create reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the

accused, particularly when they relate to material facts in issue.

10. Since it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the prosecution had failed

to establish the chain of custody, I shall first consider the evidence adduced by

the prosecution in that regard. In a case of this nature, one of the most

essential elements that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt is

the chain of custody. This refers to the chronological documentation of the

custody, transfer, and disposition of the substance recovered from the appellant.

It traces the movement of the seized drugs from the time of recovery until their

production in court as evidence. The chain of custody operates as a safeguard

against contamination, substitution, tampering, or loss of evidence, thereby

ensuring its reliability and authenticity.

11. According to the evidence of PW2, the parcel of heroin allegedly recovered

from the possession of the appellant was sealed temporarily before being

brought to Colombo. However, it is not clear whether PW2 or any member of

his team had taken any item for the purpose of sealing. When questioned by

the defense counsel, PW2 admitted that he had not made any notes regarding

the taking of any item used for sealing. This raid was conducted in 2012, and

PW2 testified in 2018, nearly six years after the incident. It was also not the

only raid conducted by PW2 and PW1.

12. Therefore, it cannot reasonably be expected of them to recall every significant

step taken during the raid without referring to their contemporaneous notes.

That is precisely why they are required to make notes pertaining to every

important step and event that occurred during the operation. The absence of

such notes relating to material events inevitably casts doubt on the credibility

of their testimony.

CA/HCC/0043/2024

5 | P a g e

13. PW 12 is the Assistant Government Analyst testified on behalf of the

prosecution. Disputing the chain of custody, the appellant laid great stress on

the failure of PW12 to mention the name of the Sectional Head of the

Government Analyst Department to whom the production was handed over by

one Chamali who accepted the production from PW1 at the Government

Analyst Department. According to PW12, Police had handed over the

production to an Assistant Government Analyst named Chamali at 2.30pm.

Chamali had handed over it to the Sectional Head of the Department but the

name of the said sectional head is not found in P13.

14. It is also pertinent to note that when the appellant was produced before the

Magistrate’s Court of Chilaw on 14.09.2012, PW2 did not hand over the

productions to court on the same day. Instead, he brought them back to their

station and kept them in his personal locker until 17.09.2012, when they were

produced before the Magistrate’s Court through PW1. According to PW2,

when they arrived at the Magistrate’s Court, Chilaw, on 14.09.2012, it was

around 3.00 p.m., and by that time the production room had been closed.

Therefore, he could not hand over the productions on the same day.

15. It is noteworthy that the learned High Court Judge, in her judgment, concluded

that the defense had admitted the chain of custody, despite the fact that it was

expressly challenged by the defense. In my view, this amounts to a clear

misdirection on the part of the learned High Court Judge. Having made such

an erroneous finding, the learned Judge has failed to analyze and evaluate the

evidence relating to the chain of custody. This omission has, in my opinion,

had a prejudicial impact on the sustainability of the judgment.

16. It is also worthy of mention that PW2 failed to make any entry regarding the

odometer reading of the vehicle at the time of leaving for Chilaw. Although

PW1 stated in his evidence that 14 officers took part in the raid, PW2

contradicted this and stated that only 11 officers participated. According to

PW2’s testimony, they travelled from Colombo in two vehicles, and later

another private vehicle belonging to an officer joined them.

CA/HCC/0043/2024

17. Nevertheless, no entry was made concerning the description of the other

vehicles, nor was sufficient information about them led in evidence. This

omission further casts doubt on the prosecution’s version of events. Moreover,

PW1 made no mention whatsoever of the third vehicle in his testimony.

18. Thus, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 contradicts each other regarding the

commencement of the raid, thereby weakening the very foundation of the

prosecution’s case.

19. The most significant discrepancy in the evidence of the present case concerns

the location from which the packet of heroin was allegedly recovered.

According to the evidence-in-chief of PW2, it was found beneath the hem of

the appellant’s undergarment. PW2 testified as follows:

20. However, PW1, in his evidence, stated that the packet of heroin was in the

hem of the appellant’s undergarment. PW1 testified as follows:

21. However, neither PW2 nor PW1 was able to provide a description of the

undergarment, not even its colour. Needless to say, when an accused is alleged

to have concealed an illegal substance in his undergarment, a clear and

specific description must be provided by the officers who detected it. The

credibility of their evidence depends not only on the accuracy of their notes

but also on the manner in which the raid was conducted, particularly the

believability and probability of their actions.

22. Therefore, in a case of this nature, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to

prove the most vital events beyond reasonable doubt. Furthermore, it is

pertinent to emphasize that witnesses in such cases enjoy the additional

advantage of giving evidence by referring to notes made during the raid, a

facility not available to ordinary lay witnesses in a typical criminal trial.

Hence, it is their duty to record such notes accurately, particularly in relation

to the important events that occurred during the raid. Failure to do so would

inevitably affect the credibility of their testimony, especially when they are

unable to clearly recount the events that actually took place.

23. According to PW2, the appellant was bodily searched while he remained

inside the three-wheeler, and the packet of heroin was allegedly detected in the

hem of his undergarment. The plausibility of this account is questionable,

given the limited space inside a three-wheeler. It is in evidence that three other

persons had already been arrested and taken to an isolated location, where they

were bodily searched prior to the appellant’s arrest. If that was the procedure,

it is unclear why PW2 could not have conducted a similar search of the

appellant in an isolated location rather than inside the vehicle. The assertion

that the appellant was searched inside the three-wheeler and that a small parcel

of heroin was discovered in the hem of his undergarment is inherently difficult

to accept, given the confined space available.

24. Although PW1 stated in his evidence that the appellant was seen near St. Jude

Church as they proceeded towards it, he did not make any notes to that effect.

Furthermore, PW1 did not record any notes regarding the seizure of mobile

phones from the appellant. In his testimony, PW1 maintained that he had never

CA/HCC/0043/2024

8 | P a g e

recorded in his notes the duties performed by the other officers. However,

during cross-examination, he contradicted himself by admitting that he had, in

fact, made notes concerning the questioning of other suspects by different

officers. PW1 testified as follows:

25. The aforementioned discrepancies in the evidence of PW1 and PW2, which go

to the very root of the prosecution’s case, appear to have escaped the attention

of the learned High Court Judge.

26. As stated earlier, official witnesses in a case of this nature are required to

maintain notes relevant to the performance of their duties and are entitled to

refer to them when giving evidence in order to refresh their memory.

Accordingly, where vital contradictions exist among their testimonies, the

CA/HCC/0043/2024

9 | P a g e

court cannot treat them lightly, nor can it apply the same standard as would be

applied to the testimony of a lay witness relying solely on memory.

27. In the present case, the discrepancies and inconsistencies apparent in the

evidence of PW1 and PW2 do not warrant a conviction of the appellant. To

elaborate, both PW1 and PW2 had the advantage of making notes in the

course of their duties and were entitled to refer to those notes when giving

evidence. Therefore, the presence of contradictions and discrepancies,

irrespective of their degree, when considered in totality, casts doubt on the

prosecution’s case.

28. As stated elsewhere in this judgment, minor contradictions in the testimony of

a lay witness in a criminal trial may be disregarded when assessing credibility,

as such witnesses testify from memory. However, this principle cannot be

extended to a case of the present nature, where the witnesses had the

opportunity to refer to their contemporaneous notes while testifying.

29. As admitted by this witness, the other two suspects—namely Pradeep and

Velu—who were arrested prior to the appellant, were subsequently acquitted

by the High Court. This was further confirmed by PW2 during cross-

examination. Thus, it appears that the evidence of the officers who conducted

the raid was disbelieved by the courts, which would certainly affect the

credibility of the evidence in the present case.

30. In the Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR 292

the court held that: “Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would

ordinarily affect the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well

established that the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the

inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the fact in

issue”

31. In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 it was held

that;

CA/HCC/0043/2024

10 | P a g e

a.“In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the

witness should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine

whether the witness is, an interested witness and to enquire whether the

story deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been shaken in

cross-examination. That is whether there is a ring of truth surrounding

his testimony.”

32. Hence,itisnotsafetoallow theconvictiontostand,giventhe

abovementioned discrepancies in the prosecution’s evidence. On this basis, I

set aside the conviction and sentence, and accordingly acquit the appellant of

all charges.

33. The appeal is allowed.
