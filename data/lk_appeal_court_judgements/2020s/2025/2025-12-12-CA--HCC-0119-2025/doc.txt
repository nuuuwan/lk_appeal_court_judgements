Appellant was in possession of 3.58 grams of heroin without a license or

permission from the Director, and offence punishable in terms Section 54

A (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance ,as amended

by Act No. 13 of 1984.

b. During the course of the same transaction, the Appellant was engaged in

2. At the trial, three witnesses, namely PW7, PW1, and the Registrar of the High Court,

testified. The Appellant made a dock statement, and at the conclusion of the trial, the

learned trial Judge found the Appellant guilty of both charges and accordingly

sentenced him to life imprisonment.

3. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Appellant has preferred the

instant appeal.

4. The grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant are as follows:

1. The learned trial Judge failed to exercise his judicial mind in determining

whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.

2. The learned trial Judge failed to properly analyze and give legal consideration

to the inherently improbable and contradictory evidence of the prosecution

witness.

3. The learned trial Judge failed to adequately assess the unreliable and

improbable evidence pertaining to the seizer and sealing of production and

procedural irregularities followed by the prosecution which undermined the

integrity of the chain of custody and cast serious doubt on the safety of the

conviction.

4. The learned trial Judge failed to properly and legally consider the totality had

the defence put forward by the Accused-Appellant resulting in misdirection

that occasioned a miscarriage of the justice and vitiated the conviction.

5. The first three grounds of appeal are interrelated, and therefore I shall consider them

together. It is significant to note that, at the trial, instead of the lead officer, it was

PW7 (WPC 11117 Sulochana Madhushani) who testified first. According to her

evidence, the raid was conducted on the instructions of PW1 Naleen Shriyantha on

27.09.2021. The team of officers left the Colombo North Crime Investigation Unit at

around 21.00 hours and proceeded to No. 47/K/14, Sumittpura, Mattakkuliya, where

the Appellant resided. The police vehicle was parked right in front of the Appellant’s

residence.

6. They entered the Appellant’s house and found the Appellant seated in the living room.

As instructed by PW1, PW7 took the Appellant into a room inside the house and

CA/HCC/0119/2025

4 | P a g e

conducted a physical search, during which she recovered a parcel from the right-side

pocket of the frock worn by the Appellant. PW7 thereafter handed the parcel over to

PW1, who sealed the production.

7. It is noteworthy that when questioned, PW7 was unable to recollect whether any other

persons were present at the Appellant’s house at the time of the raid. It is also

important to note that in her evidence-in-chief, PW7 stated that the police vehicle had

stopped right in front of the Appellant’s house. However, during cross-examination,

when questioned about the width of the road where the Appellant’s house is situated,

the witness admitted that it was a narrow lane. It was further suggested to the witness

that the width of the road leading to the Appellant’s house was only two feet, but the

witness failed to answer the question.

8. Thereafter, the witness admitted that the police vehicle had not stopped in front of the

Appellant’s house, as stated in her evidence-in-chief, but rather at the entrance of the

road leading to the Appellant’s residence. One of the most improbable aspects of

PW7’s evidence, as observed by this Court, is her assertion that the Appellant had

kept a heroin parcel in the front pocket of her frock until the police party arrived at

her residence and searched her. Hence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept that a

person would have kept a small parcel of heroin in the pocket of her frock while

remaining inside, waiting for the police to arrive and arrest her.

9. Furthermore, the witness admitted that she had not paid any attention to the sealing

process, despite the production being sealed at the Appellant’s house. Another

unusual aspect is that this witness certified the lead officer’s notes, which is not the

standard practice.

10. Furthermore, the witness admitted that she neither observed nor paid much attention

to the sealing process and had not made any notes in that regard. If that was the case,

it is difficult to understand how she could certify the lead officer’s notes as accurate.

No plausible explanation was provided by the witness on this issue. These

inconsistencies and procedural lapses cast serious doubt on the credibility and

reliability of PW7’s evidence.

11. In a detection of this nature, it is incumbent upon the officers to maintain accurate

notes detailing the important steps taken from the commencement of the raid until the

CA/HCC/0119/2025

5 | P a g e

production is handed over to the police reserve. Such notes should specifically include

the manner of detention, the place of detection, the location where the productions

were sealed, and the manner in which the productions were weighed and sealed, as

well as the procedure followed during the arrest of the Appellant.

12. However, upon perusal of PW7’s evidence, it appears to this Court that, although she

attended the raid as an officer subordinate to PW1, she did not make proper notes of

the proceedings.

13. The next most vital witness is PW1, Naleen Shriyantha, the chief investigating

officer. According to his evidence, the raid was conducted pursuant to information

received from his personal informant.

14. According to PW1, the vehicle used to reach the location where the Appellant was

arrested bore the number WPNE. PW1’s evidence, however, contradicted that of PW7

regarding the exact location where the police vehicle stopped upon reaching the

Appellant’s residence.

15. Furthermore, there was no evidence to suggest that the officers searched the

appellant’s house after his arrest. It is rather unusual that a team of police officers,

having arrested a person at his home for possession of Heroin, would fail to search the

house, especially given the nature of the information they had received which led to

the arrest.

16. It is to be noted that PW1 also recorded in his notes that the vehicle was stopped in

front of house No. 47/K/14, Summit Pura, Mattakkuliya, an assertion that was

admitted by both PW7 and PW1 to be incorrect, given the narrowness of the road.

These infirmities undoubtedly cast serious doubt on the prosecution’s evidence,

particularly regarding the probability and reliability of the prosecution’s version of

events.

17. The weighing and sealing of the substance allegedly recovered from the appellant are

vital steps in a raid of this nature. Nevertheless, PW7 had not made any note

regarding these procedures. The explanation offered by PW7, that she did not observe

the weighing and sealing because she focused her attention primarily on the appellant,

is unacceptable, as there were several other officers in the raiding party who could

have guarded the appellant.

18. The most critical piece of evidence that has escaped the attention of the learned High

Court Judge is the testimony of PW7 at page 72 of the appeal brief, where she stated

that she had signed the notes made by PW1 as correct, despite admitting that she had

not observed the weighing and sealing process. When questioned by the State Counsel

in examination-in-chief, PW7 merely stated that she signed the investigation notes

after reading them, but could not recollect their contents. It is also noteworthy that

PW7 was the corroborating witness, yet, for reasons best known to the prosecution,

she was called to testify before PW1.

19. The rule is that a witness, who is to be corroborated either by other evidence or, where

permissible, by his previous statement, should be called first, and the corroborative

evidence should be led thereafter. thus, the Indian courts have held that an approver

should be examined before the evidence in corroboration is produced. evidence or,

where permissible, by his previous statement. Ali Muhammad vs. Emperor A.I.R.

(1934) Lah.171, (Law of Evidence Vol.2 Book 2 by E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy).

20. The contradictory positions taken by PW1 and PW7 regarding the location where the

police vehicle was parked, the inherent improbabilities in the events that allegedly led

to the appellant’s arrest and the subsequent recovery of heroin from her possession,

the failure of PW7 to make notes on key steps such as weighing and sealing the

substance allegedly recovered, and, more importantly, PW7’s certification of the

notes made by PW1 without observing those crucial steps, when considered together

with the fact that PW7 was called to testify before PW1, collectively cast serious

doubt on the credibility of the prosecution case.

21. Moreover, PW1 categorically stated in cross-examination that he had never conducted

a raid or arrested anyone at the address 47/L/59. However, when a copy of the B

Report No. B/13900/21 was shown to him, PW1 admitted that he had, in fact, arrested

one Thuppahi Arachchilage Randev at that very address. Notably, he is the brother of

the appellant’s husband. It was also established that the appellant’s husband resided at

47/L/59, and therefore it can be reasonably inferred that the appellant was also

arrested at that same address, rather than at 47/K/14 as alleged by the prosecution.

During cross-examination, it was put to PW1 that the appellant was arrested at

47/L/59, but he denied this suggestion.

CA/HCC/0119/2025

22. In fact, in her dock statement, the appellant clearly stated that the raiding party had

come in search of her husband, but as he was not at home, she was instructed to call

him without disclosing the presence of the police. She further stated that when she

informed her husband that the police were there, she was immediately arrested. This

version, when considered alongside the evidence elicited from PW1 during cross-

examination, certainly creates a significant doubt regarding the prosecution’s case.

23. In Kathubdeen vs Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] (3) Sri L.R.107, it was observed:

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as evidence. It has

also been laid down that if the unsworn statement creates a reasonable doubt

in the prosecution case or if it is believed, then the accused should be given

the benefit of that doubt.

24. In Gunasiri and two others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SRI.L.R 39 it was

held that:

In evaluating a dock statement, the trial Judge must consider the following

principles: (1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon. (2) If the

dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the defence

must succeed.

25. In light of the foregoing legal principles and upon a careful analysis of the evidence, I

am of the considered view that it is unsafe to allow the conviction to stand. The

conviction and sentence are accordingly set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of

both counts. The appeal is therefore allowed.
