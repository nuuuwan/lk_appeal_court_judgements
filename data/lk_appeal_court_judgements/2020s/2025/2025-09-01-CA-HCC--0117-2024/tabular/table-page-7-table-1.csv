"nature and circumstances in each case, in deciding whether an accused is"
"entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden Provocation”"
"In Premalal v AG [2000] 2 SLR 403, the court held that:"
"“Each  case  must  depend  upon  its  own  facts  and  circumstances.  In  the"
"present case, my view is that, in judging the conduct of the accused, one"
"must  not  confine  himself  to  the  actual  moment  when  the  bow,  which"
"ultimately proved to be fatal, was struck, that is to say, one must not take"
"into consideration only the event which took place immediately before the"
"fatal  blow  was  struck.  We  must  take  into  consideration  the  previous"
"conduct  of  the  woman.  Her  evil  ways  were  the  common  scandal  of  the"
"village and must have been known to the husband, causing him extreme"
"mental agony, shame and humiliation.”"
"The evidence clearly shows that the deceased had provoked the Appellant by"
"spreading rumours. Being provoked, the Appellant had lost his self-control"
"and inflicted injuries to the deceased. Therefore, the learned High Court had"
"very correctly held the Appellant responsible under Section 297 of the Penal"
"Code."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  submitted  to  Court  that  although  the"
"learned High Court Judge had correctly held the Appellant responsible under"
"Section  297  of  the  Penal  Code,  she  had  failed  to  consider  the  mitigatory"
"factors in favour of the Appellant when she passed the sentence."
"The Appellant, had confessed after the incident to the prosecution witnesses"
"that  he  had  committed  the  offence  due  to  grave  and  sudden  provocation"
"without any pre-planning but on the spur of the moment. Further, he had"
"not absconded after the incident and had directly gone to the police station"
