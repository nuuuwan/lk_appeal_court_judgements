"Considering the facts of the case and the submissions made by both counsels"
"I  conclude  that  this  is  not  an  appropriate  case  in  which  to  order  a  long"
"custodial sentence against the Appellant."
"Therefore,  I  set  aside  the  sentence  of  14  years  rigorous  imprisonment"
"imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha and"
"substitute a sentence of four years rigorous imprisonment operative from the"
"date of sentence which is 05.01.2024. The fine imposed by the High Court"
"will remain unchanged. Considering all the circumstances of the case, I order"
"a  compensation  of  Rs.200,000/-  payable  to  the  deceased’s  family,  with  a"
"default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment."
"Subject to above variation, the appeal is hereby dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send the judgment to the High Court"
"of Gampaha along with the original case record."
