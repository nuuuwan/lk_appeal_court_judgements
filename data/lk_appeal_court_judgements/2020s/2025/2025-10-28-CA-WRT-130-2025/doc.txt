K. Priyantha Fernando, J. (CA)

The Petitioner has filed his Petition on 20.02.2025. This application is to

challenge the alleged arbitrary, ultra vires decision of the 3rd Respondent to

suspend the Petitioner’s industrial mining license. The Petitioner asserted that

the suspension, ordered based on an alleged land ownership dispute, was a

decision that surpassed the authority of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and was

factually incorrect.

4

The Petitioner filed this application to this Court to challenge and quash the

decision of the 3rd Respondent (Director General of the Geological Survey &

Mines Bureau) to suspend his industrial mining license by the letter dated

December 13, 2024 marked as P26.

THE POSITION OF THE PETITIONER:

The Petitioner had been running a quarry on the land with necessary approvals

since 2011, having obtained all required licenses from relevant institutes. The

Petitioner’s industrial mining license, bearing No. IML/C/MTL/0005/LR/03,

was arbitrarily suspended. In addition to the mining license, he held all other

necessary coexisting licenses since 2011, including approvals from the Urban

Development Authority, the Department of Archaeology, a permit for explosives,

an Environmental Protection License, and a trade license, to carry out his legal

business. (vide P18 to P22)

The Petitioner was the lessee of the land, having signed a renewed lease

agreement (P2) that was registered and valid from January 5, 2022, to January

4, 2032.

The lawful owner of the land was the Petitioner's legal wife, who acquired the

property by a deed of sale (P4) dated February 25, 2009. This deed and its

corresponding surveyor plan (P6) described the land as a divided portion with an

extent of two roods ten decimal two, third perches, and four clearly defined

boundaries. The Petitioner asserted that his wife and her predecessors possessed

the land as a divided portion for more than 30 years.

Furthermore, the Petitioner stated there was no documentary proof that anyone

had challenged his wife's title rights, nor had anyone filed a case to establish

conflicting rights and seek a restraining order to stop the mining license.

Despite operating smoothly with legal approvals, the Petitioner received a letter

from the 3rd Respondent in October 2024 (P23) informing him of the intention to

5

suspend all activities due to a dispute over land ownership. The 3rd Respondent

had requested a title report (P24), which the Petitioner furnished on October 23,

2024. Nevertheless, the 3rd Respondent sent the suspension letter on December

13, 2024 (P26), reasoning that the land was undivided and that the Petitioner

needed to execute an amicable deed of partition or file a partition case in a

relevant court to resolve the matter.

The Petitioner contended that this reason was preposterous, and the 3rd

Respondent acted blatantly ultra vires in issuing this order, as the Mines and

Mineral Act No. 33 of 1992 only listed specific conditions for refusing or

cancelling a license, none of which supported the current suspension based on

an alleged title dispute. Therefore, the Petitioner sought a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the arbitrary decision (P26) and a Writ of Mandamus to direct the

respondents to remove the temporary suspension over his mining license.

The POSITION OF THE 1st -9th RESPONDENTS:

The 1st to 9th Respondents have tried to justify the dismissal of the Petitioner's

application, contending that the Petitioner misconstrued facts and that the

application was void ab initio.

The Respondents argued that the Petitioner's Counsel misrepresented material

facts in documents "P23" and "P26." They asserted that the documents did not

constitute a temporary suspension or cancellation of the industrial mining

license but were merely an intimation of a decision to stop all mining and

other activities until a land ownership dispute was resolved. The

Respondents contended that the Petitioner failed to annex a document

demonstrating any steps taken by them to officially suspend or cancel the

license.

6

The Respondents' primary objection was that the application was void ab initio

because the license, "P17," had expired on December 19, 2024, and had thus

faced a "natural death".

It was contended that since the Petitioner had neither applied for a renewal nor

a new license under Section 36 of the Mines and Minerals Act after the expiry

date, there was no license to either cancel or temporarily suspend. Consequently,

the Petitioner held no legal right to seek the Writ jurisdiction of the Court on a

license that had ceased to exist, rendering the reliefs prayed for as futile. The

Respondents maintained that no Certiorari lie against "P.26" and no Mandamus

could be issued to perform a function that contravened the provisions of the Act.

In addition to the issue of license expiration, the Respondents contended that

the facts are in dispute, which barred the Petitioner from seeking a discretionary

remedy by way of a Writ. The Respondents stated that they received a written

complaint from an individual, "Dhanushka Lenawala," who, along with his

brother (the Petitioner), collectively owned an undivided one-third (1/3) portion

of the subject land.

Furthermore, they pointed out that the Petitioner’s own title report ("P24")

reflected that there were multiple owners with undivided shares to the land. The

Respondents explained that they clearly intimated to the Petitioner that such

disputes regarding an undivided share must be resolved through an appropriate

court of first instance.

The Respondents noted that according to Section 51 of the Act, a permit holder

must obtain the consent of the owner of the land, which the Petitioner failed to

rectify either through a District Court action or an affidavit of consent.

Finally, the Respondents argued that the Petitioner had not even complied with

their request to resolve the land dispute in primary courts and was thus barred

from seeking the Writ jurisdiction without exhausting the available alternative

remedies (Sections 39-40 of the Act). For the foregoing reasons, the Respondents

prayed that the Court dismiss the application in limine.

CONCLUSION:

The Petitioner had been operating a quarry since 2011 with all necessary

approvals, and his license (P17) was suspended but not cancelled, by the 3rd

Respondent on December 13, 2024, through the letter marked P26. This

suspension was imposed after the Petitioner submitted ownership records, with

the 3rd Respondent directing the Petitioner to either execute an amicable deed of

partition or file a partition action in the relevant court to resolve the matter of

the land's title.

The letter P26 specifically stated that the temporary suspension would continue

until the matter was resolved, and failure to comply would result in the

cancellation of the license. The 3rd Respondent acted in a manner that was

patently arbitrary manner by ordering him to file a partition case for a land that

was already divided and defined.

It is sufficiently proved that the land in question was a divided portion of two

roods and 10 2/3 perches, received by Pettioner’s wife via a deed (P 4) and

recorded in the relevant volume/folio (P 5 and P 3). The registered lease

agreement (P 2) held by the Petitioner, which stipulated a validity period until

2032, complying with Section 51 of the Mines and Minerals Act.

“51. The holder of a licence issued under this Act shall have the right to enter

and possess any area of land specified in such licence: Provided that where

the owner of any such area of land is in possession of such area of land,

the holder of the licence shall not exercise the rights conferred on him by this

section except with the consent of such owner.”

In the instant case, the holder of the licence is the Petitioner who possessed the

licence marked P17 and he has the right to possess any area of land specified

in P17 which is described as “AMBAGAHAMULLAHENA &

UDAGALKANDAHENA” with the extent of 2R 10.5P. The owner of the land is

8

Petitioner’s own wife who is having absolute title upon Deed of Sale No. 1200

dated 25.02.2009 marked as P4. There is no evidence adduced as to anyone

else is in possession of said divided portion.

According to the land registry document (P 3), obtained on October 21, 2024, the

land remained a divided portion, with neither a caveat nor any obstacle raised

by any individual.

According to the Plan No. 7490 (P06), the lot has been entrenched as a divided

and defined portion for more than 30 years since 1993, which was sufficient to

entrench prescriptive right under Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The complaint filed by one Danushka Lenawala seems baseless since he had no

demonstrable connection to the land. No legal action had been taken by this

individual either against the Petitioner or his wife. That fact itself shows the

fallacy of said claim. The direction given by the Bureau asking the Petitioner to

get amicable partition the land or to file a partition suit is manifestly wrong and

amounts to illegal order.

The leaned State Counsel argued that the Respondents have not taken a final

decision or to temporally suspend or to cancel the license P17. The Petitioner

countered the Respondents’ claim and rightly pointed out that since the 3rd

Respondent had suspended the license (P17) through documents P23 and P26,

and extended that suspension, the Petitioner is trapped and prevented from

applying for a renewal or an applying for a new license under the relevant

sections of the Mines and Minerals Act.

The Mines and Minerals Act does not contain any provisions regarding

suspension. It is seen that neither the P23 nor the P26 issued under any

provision in the Act. Issuing both P23 and P26 itself is patently illegal because

there is no provision for such temporary suspension when valid documentation

has been forwarded by the Petitioner before the 1st Respondent Bureau.

“36. A licence issued under this Act shall be renewed after the expiration of the

period specified in the licence on application made to the Bureau not less than

thirty days before the expiry thereof if (a) the Bureau is satisfied that the licensee

has observed the terms and conditions attached to such licence; and (b) the

licensee pays the prescribed fee for the renewal of the licence.”

“37. (1) The Bureau may cancel a licence issued under this Act, if it is satisfied

that the licensee (a) has contravened any term or condition attached to such

licence; (b) has not carried out any lawful direction given to him by the

Bureau; (c) carries on wasteful mining despite prior warning given in writing by

the Bureau against such mining; (d) has suspended, curtailed or ceased to carry

on any activity authorized by such licence for a period of over three months without

the permission of the Bureau; (e) has surrendered his licence subject to satisfaction

of the requirements of this Act; or (f) has been convicted of an offence under this

Act or of any regulation made thereunder. (2) The cancellation of a licence under

subsection (1) shall not take effect until the time for appealing against the

decision of the Bureau under section 39 has expired or if an appeal has

been made within time, unless and until the appeal has been disallowed.”

(the emphasis was added)

The Petitioner has satisfied this Court that the direction given by the Bureau is

prima facie not lawful one.

If the Bureau cancelled the licence under Section 39, said cancellation could

not have taken effect until time for appealing against the decision under section

39 has expired or if an appeal has been made within time, unless and until the

has been disallowed.

It is apparent that if the 1st respondent did cancel the license as per section 37

of the Act, the Petitioner could have pursued on the appellate procedure and

would have got relief as provided in Sections 39 and 40 of the Act. However, by

issuing P23 and P26 without based on any legal provision in the Act, viz. section

37, the Petitioner is aggrieved without any remedy of appealing.

10

From the date of issuing P23, which is dated 07.10.2025, the impugned license

was under suspension. Therefore, the petitioner was devoid of either renewal or

applying for a new license resulting from the arbitrary act of the 1st to 8th

respondents. Thus, I reject the argument of the learned State Counsel that since

the License has now expired, the Petitioner’s application is futile.

In these circumstances, it is clearly seen that invoking Writ jurisdiction is the

only remedy for the Petitioner to escape and emancipate himself from illegal acts

of the respondents.

The Petitioner has satisfied that there is a prima facie case/arguable matter

which should be gone into by this Court.

Accordingly, I am inclined to issue formal notices on the Respondents.
