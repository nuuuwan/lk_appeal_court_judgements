"is not entitled to any relief sought and has not disclosed material facts, making"
"the application frivolous and vexatious."
"9] In the objection, the Appellant Respondent states that he served the Petitioner"
"for over 31 years and retired as Deputy General Manager. He emphasizes that"
"the  Petitioner  is  majority-owned  by  the  Sri  Lankan  Government  and  thus"
"qualifies  as  a  public  authority  under  the  RTI  Act.  He  maintains  that  the"
"information  he  requested  falls  within  the  scope  of  the  Act  and  is  not  exempt"
"under  Sections  5(1)(a)  or  (g).  He  contends  that  the  RTI  Commission  correctly"
"determined  on  14  December  2022  that  the  requested  information  must  be"
"released and that the Petitionerâ€™s refusal lacked legal basis."
"10]  The  basic  argument  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  RTI  Commission  failed  to"
"properly consider the sensitive nature of the information sought, as it pertains"
"solely to disqualified candidates and does not contribute to ensuring the integrity"
"or  fairness  of  the  final  selection  process.  The  Petitioner  further  contends  that"
"disclosure of such personal data offers no public benefit, serves private interests,"
"and risks violating the privacy and reputational rights of the individuals involved,"
"contrary to Article 14A (2) of the Constitution and Sections 5(1)(a) and (g) of the"
"RTI Act."
"11]  I  now  consider  the  merits  of  this  appeal.  The  Petitioner  seeks  protection"
"under section 5(1)(a) and section 5(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, No. 12"
"of 2016. Those sections are reproduced below for clarity;"
