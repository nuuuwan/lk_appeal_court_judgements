"such circumstances justify a dismissal of the Petitioner‟s case? In my view, having called to"
"produce the evidence, if the Petitioner failed to do so only, the court should conclude that the"
"Petitioner is not ready for the trial, which may have warranted a dismissal."
"T
hough  it  is  contended  by  the  Petitioner  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  was  biased  in  her"
"conduct,  such  contention  lacks  any  material  proof.  As  pointed  out  by  His  Lordship  Dr."
"A.R.B. Amerasinghe in his book “Judicial Conduct Ethics and Responsibilities” (2002) pg"
"524."
"“Since  the  issue  is  not  whether  the  Judge  was  biased  but  whether  a  person  in  the"
"applicant’s position, and conversant with the facts, might reasonably apprehend that"
"the judge was biased……….”"
"F
urther, In the case of Rex V. Sussex Justices. Ex Parte Mccarthy [1923] 1 KB 256 Lord"
"Hewart C.J. held that;"
"“…….. a long line of cases shows that it is not merely of some importance but is of"
"fundamental  importance  that  justice  should  not  only  be  done,  but  should  manifestly"
"and undoubtedly be seen to be done.”"
"T
herefore, as I have observed above, it seems that the conduct of the learned trial Judge may"
"attract 
suspicion  of  bias 
in  a 
fair-minded  person,  and 
justice 
is  not  manifestly  and"
"undoubtedly seen to be done. Further, upon reviewing all the facts and materials presented to"
"this  court,  it  is  evident  that  the 
learned  District  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  provide  the"
"Petitioner  with  a  fair  hearing,  thereby  seeming  to  have  acted  injudiciously.  Moreover,  the"
"right to a fair hearing is a fundamental principle of natural justice, and it must be upheld."
"T
herefore, 
it 
is  my  considered  view 
that 
the 
learned  District  Court  Judge  has  acted"
"injudiciously by dismissing the claim of the Petitioner without any legal ground valid in law."
