"Ratnapura  and  Another  [1996]  2  SLR  70)  the  above  was  held  as"
"“A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the"
"issue of a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter"
"of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even"
"if  he  is  entitled  to  relief,  still  the  Court  has  a  discretion  to"
"deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches,"
"waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments"
"which stand against the grant of relief.”"
