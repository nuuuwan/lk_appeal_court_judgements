"in  Bisomenike  vs.  C.  R.  de  Alwis","(1982-1SLR-368),"
"Sharvananda, J., (as he then was) observed that;",""
"","“A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court."
"","It  cannot  be  held  to  be  a  Writ  of  right  or  one  issued  as  a"
"","matter of course. The exercise of this discretion by Court is"
"","governed  by  certain  well-accepted  principles.  The  Court  is"
"","bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the"
"","order  of  an  inferior  tribunal  except  in  cases  where  he  has"
"","disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his"
"","own conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay"
"","or waiver. The proposition that the Application for Writ must"
"","be  sought  as  soon  as  the  injury  is  caused  is  merely  an"
"Application  of 
the  equitable  doctrine","that  delay  defeats"
"","equity  and  the  longer  the  injured  person  sleeps  over  his"
"","rights  without  any  reasonable  excuse  the  chance  of  his"
"","success  in  Writ  Application  dwindles  and  the  Court  may"
"","reject a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay."
"","An Application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filled within"
"a reasonable time.”",""
