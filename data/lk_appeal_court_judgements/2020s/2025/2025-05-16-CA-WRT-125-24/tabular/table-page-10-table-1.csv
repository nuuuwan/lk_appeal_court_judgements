"","proceed on the premise that it was a restructure of the facility and the"
"","default after the settlement in the Commercial High Court constitutes"
"","a default of a new facility which thus requires a fresh resolution to be"

"23.  Rescheduling  primarily  adjusts  the  repayment  timeline,  whereas",""
"","restructuring changes the entire loan structure.  Rescheduling is no"
"","more than the modification of loan repayment terms but the principal"
"","terms and conditions of loan contract remain significantly unchanged."
"","Rescheduling normally will be to extend or lengthen the loan tenure"
"","and  may  be 
to 
revise 
the  payment 
instalments. 
In 
contrast,"
"","restructuring will involve the modification of the principal terms and"
"","conditions of the loan, which may be a change in the structure of the"
"","loan  or  other  significant  change 
to 
its 
terms  and  may 
involve"
"","restructuring or conversion of the type or nature of the facility,  i.e.,"
"","overdraft to term loan."

"","By the said terms of settlement, the petitioners and the 1st respondent"

"","due and payable. The settlement P-10 is no more than rescheduling"
"","and is certainly not restructuring. Thus, to my mind, it is lawful for"
"","the  respondent  bank  to  proceed  with  the  said  resolution  dated"
"","28.01.2019."
"25.  Then by paragraph 10 of the terms of settlement P-10 the petitioners",""
"","hold  out  that  the  Respondent  bank  is  entitled  to  proceed  with  the"
"","resolution  dated  28.01.2019,  to  recover  in  the  event  of  any  default"
"","(para  10).  This  term  of  settlement  clearly  is  an  acceptance  of  the"
"","continuous validity of the original resolution and the petitioners agree"
"","and then concede the respondent bankâ€™s right to proceed with the said"
