"Being  aggrieved  by  the  afore-mentioned  conviction  and  the  sentence,  the  Accused  has"
"preferred this appeal to this Court."
"The following grounds for appeal were set out in the written submission."
"1.  The trial  has  been  conducted  in  violation  of  the provisions  of Section 142 of  the"
"Evidence Ordinance, thereby occasioning a deprivation of a fair trial"
"2.  Evidence  of  the  prosecutrix  is  ambiguous  and  inconsistent  on  the  question  of"
"penetration"
"The facts and circumstances are that;"
"According to the testimony of PW 01, Nagarathnam Brintha, who was in grade 8 when"
"the offence was committed on 05.10.2016 and 16 years old at the time of giving evidence."
"The accused, who resided next door to the prosecutrix, called as ‘Priya’ and asked for a"
"water  bottle.  Responding  to  the  Accused's  request,  PW  01  brought  the  bottle  near  the"
"fence. He then asked her to come closer to see why he was calling her. Trusting him, she"
"walked toward the gate. When the PW 01 tried to shout, the Accused trapped the child’s"
"mouth and laid her down on the bed. After he had sexual intercourse with her, and asked"
"the child to leave."
"She has told this incident to her neighbour, witness no. 04. According to the witness No."
"04, namely Sasi kumar, he has seen the accused  taken  the child to the accused’s house."
"The  main  ground  urged  by  the  accused  was  that  the  state  counsel  had  asked  leading"
"questions  about  the  penetration,  which  is  a  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance."
"What is a leading question?"
"Section 141 of the Evidence Ordinance"
"“Any  question  suggesting  the  answer  which  the  person  putting  it  wishes  or  expects  to"
"receive is called a leading question.”"
