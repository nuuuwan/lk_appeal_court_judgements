"testimony  of  the  prosecutrix  is  consistent  and  credible,  with  no  compelling  grounds  to"
"disbelieve her account."
"We are  also  mindful  of  the  well-established principle  that  the  Court of  Appeal  will  not"
"readily interfere with the trial judgeâ€™s findings on the acceptance or rejection of witness"
"testimony, unless such findings are manifestly erroneous."
"In my considered opinion, the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt."
"For  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  find  no  justification  to  interfere  with  the  judgment  of  the"
"Learned High Court Judge."
"Accordingly, the conviction and sentence are affirmed."
"The appeal is hereby dismissed."
