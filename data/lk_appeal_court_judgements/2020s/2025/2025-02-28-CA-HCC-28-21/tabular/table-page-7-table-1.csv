"Thereafter, PW3 took PW1 home and later made a complaint to the Rathnapura Police on"
"the same day."
"When PW3 was cross-examined, he admitted the fact that PW1 came to his place only two"
"weeks  before.  During  the  cross-examination,  it  was  suggested  by  the  Counsel  for  the"
"defence that PW1 was brought to his place due to a love affair PW1 had with another man"
"which was continuously denied by PW3."
"Those portions were marked as contradictions by the defence."
"Further, he stated that PW1 was naked when he saw them and later, PW1 wore her clothe"
"which was in the bucket."
