"says that she has cried for help, but no one has heard her. She told the doctor that her"
"mouth was tied with the towel."
"We  observe  that  PW1  was  not  consistent  with  her  evidence.  Therefore,  we  find  the"
"evidence of PW1 untrustworthy."
"I am also mindful that as per the PW1, she cried for help when the Accused dragged her"
"to the manioc cultivation. At the same time, as divulged to the Court, the PW3 and his"
"wife came towards the stream in search of PW1. Further, PW1 has stated that she tried"
"to escape by fighting against the Accused."
"However,  no  one  has  heard  the  PW1’s  cry for help.  A  prudent man would  think  this  is"
"improbable  in  this  situation  where  PW3  was  looking  for  PW1  as  she  was  late  to  come"
"home.  The  PW3  or  his  wife  in  this  instance  would  have  been  cautious  and  have  heard"
"even a mild sound if there was a cry for help or if PW1 was trying to escape as claimed by"
"PW1. However, no such indication was made regarding this to the Court."
"The question is whether she raised her voice at the time of the incident. It creates doubts"
"about whether the incident claimed by the PW1 actually happened. The trial judge failed"
"to consider this evidence."
"We are mindful of how PW3 has known the place of the incident as it cannot be seen from"
"the outside as stated by the Police witness unless he knows the exact place. Also, we are"
"mindful  that  according  to  PW3,  there  was  a  bucket  with  clothes  at  the  scene  which"
"contradicts the evidence of PW1."
"When  we  consider  both  witnesses  together,  there  is  a  strong  doubt  created  due  to  the"
"discrepancy in the testimonies of the witnesses. We hold that there is a doubt created by"
"PW1  and  PW3  whether  the  incident  took  place  at  the  said  time.  This  fact  was  not"
"considered by the Learned High Court Judge."
"Therefore,  we  are  inclined  to  consider  whether  the  testimonies  of  PW1  and  PW3  are"
"improbable. It directly affects the credibility of those witnesses. If so, the Learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  test  of  probability  regarding  the  Prosecution’s"
"version. In the instant application, PW3 and his wife have not heard any sound or cry for"
"help of PW1."
