"The  Respondent's  assertion  of  lawful  occupation  under  Dedigama  Gold  Loan"
"Centre 
(Pvt)  Ltd. 
is 
fundamentally 
inconsistent  with  his  own  admission  of"
"initially  entering 
the  premises  under

license.  This  duality"
"undermines  his  credibility  and  invites  the  application  of  Section  116  of  the"
"Evidence Ordinance, which unequivocally estops a party from denying the title"
"of the individual under whom they were licensed to occupy."
"T

"the agreement under which he initially entered the property."
"The Petitioner has effectively demonstrated a strong prima facie case through"
"comprehensive documentary evidence, including valuation reports and detailed"
"police  complaints.  These  documents  not  only  substantiate  the  Petitioner's"
"claims  but  also  reveal  the  Respondent's  actions  as  inconsistent  and  lacking  in"
"good faith. The Respondent's refusal to formalize the management agreement,"
"despite ample opportunity, indicates a deliberate intent to exploit the informal"
"arrangement for his benefit, further emphasizing his lack of equitable standing."
