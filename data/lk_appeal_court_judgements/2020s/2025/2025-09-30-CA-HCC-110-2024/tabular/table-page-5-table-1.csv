"Accordingly,  we  conclude  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  valid  appeal,  this  Court  lacks  the"
"jurisdiction to convert the matter to a revision application."
"It is observed that the application seeking to invoke the Court’s revisionary jurisdiction"
"was made on 31.08.2025, approximately fourteen months after the appeal was initially"
"lodged on 21.12.2023. It is a well-established principle that a party seeking revision must"
"do so without undue delay. In the present matter, the delay remains unexplained. Our"
"Courts have consistently held that such inordinate and unjustified delay constitutes a bar"
"to the exercise of revisionary powers under Section 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
"This concept was considered by Justice Kulathilaka, J. in Rajapakse v. The State, 2001"
"(2) SLR 161 held that;"
"“The learned counsel for the accused-appellant also submitted that if this Court were to"
"hold that the petition of appeal is out of time it would not preclude him from inviting this"
"Court to exercise the revisionary powers in terms of Section 364 of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure  Act.  We  agree  that  the  powers  of  revision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  are  wide"
"enough to embrace a case where an appeal lay was not taken. However, an application in"
"revision should not be entertained save in exceptional circumstances."
"Further held that;"
"In addition, if this Court were to act in revision, the party must come before the Court"
"without  unreasonable  delay. In  the  instant  case, there  is  a  delay  of  13 months. In  this"
"regard,  vide  Justice  Ismail's  judgment  in Camillus Ignatious vs. OIC of Uhana Police"
