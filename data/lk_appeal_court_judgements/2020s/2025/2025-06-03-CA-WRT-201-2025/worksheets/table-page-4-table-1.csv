"The  Petitioner  avers  that  it  has  supplied  TPN  to  the  1st  Respondent  and"
"various public hospitals for several years without any substantiated product"
"quality  concerns.  However,  by  letter  dated  25th  September  2023,  the  3rd"
"Respondent  notified  the  Petitioner  that  one  batch  of  TNA  Peri  was  being"
"withheld  due  to  discolouration  observed 
in  two  units,  and  called 
for  a"
"response within 28 days. The corresponding laboratory report (NMQAL Report"
"No. NDLB/DU/T25/2023 dated 22nd September 2023) described the sample"
"as  light  brown  in  colour,  deviating  from  manufacturer  specifications.  The"
"Petitioner  contends  that  no  formal  quality  failure  determination  or  product"
"withdrawal  followed  and  that  the  NMRA  took  no  further  regulatory  action,"
"thus implying that the explanation had been accepted."
"T
he Petitioner avers that in or around February 2025, it was informally made"
"aware  that  the  1st  Respondent  intended  to  award  the  tender  to  the  6th"
"Respondent,  despite  the  Petitioner's  lower  price  and  continued  regulatory"
"compliance. The Petitioner further notes that the NMRA registration of the 6th"
"Respondent’s  product,  “Nutriflex  Omega  Peri”,  was  granted  only  on  28th"
"November  2024,  days  before  the  bid  closing,  raising  concerns  of  strategic"
"timing to influence the tender outcome."
"T
he instant Writ Application was filed on 19th March 2025, seeking interim"
"relief to prevent the award and/or implementation of the said tender in favour"
"of the 6th and 7th Respondents, alleging violations of the National Procurement"
"Guidelines (2006) and the Guidelines for Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and"
"Medical Devices of a Consumable Nature - 2022."
"I
n  response,  the  6th  and  7th  Respondents 
filed  a  Limited  Statement  of"
"Objections  dated  1st  April  2025  asserting,  inter  alia,  that  the  Petitioner’s"
"product  is  outdated,  non-compliant  with  the  required  third-generation  TPN"
"specifications, lacks Omega-3 fatty acids and nitrogen, and has a documented"
"history of defective supplies. They further allege that awarding the tender to"
"the  Petitioner  would  increase  costs  due  to  the  need  for  administering  two"
"packs per patient daily and expose patients to increased infection risks."
"U
pon the matter being supported, this Court issued a temporary interim order"
"maintaining the status quo, pending production of the Technical Evaluation"
"Committee  (TEC)  Report.  The  said  report  and  annexures  were  thereafter"
"produced by the Hon. Attorney General by motion dated 22nd April 2025, and"
"the  matter  was  accordingly  fixed  for  order  on  interim  relief,  with  parties"
"(Petitioner and the 6th and 7th Respondents) having filed written submissions."
