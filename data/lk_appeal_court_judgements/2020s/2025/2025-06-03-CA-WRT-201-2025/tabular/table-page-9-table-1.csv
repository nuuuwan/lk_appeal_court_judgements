"the Petitioner has disclosed a prima facie case warranting the grant of interim"
"relief."
"T
he  factual  matrix  placed  before  this  Court  reveals  that  the  Petitioner’s"
"product  “TNA  Peri”  is  registered  with  the  National  Medicines  Regulatory"
"Authority (NMRA) by way of a valid five-year certificate issued on 27th January"
"2022  (marked  ‘P3’),  and  has  been  regularly  supplied  to  both  the  SPC  and"
"public sector hospitals over the course of the past several years (marked ‘P11’–"
"‘P16’)."
"I
t is not disputed that the Petitioner submitted a bid offering a unit price of"
"LKR 8,995, amounting to a total bid value of LKR 215,880,000 (marked ‘P18’)."
"The only competing bid was submitted by the 6th Respondent at a unit price"
"of  USD  46,  amounting  to  approximately  LKR  321,668,000  based  on  the"
"prevailing exchange rate of LKR 291.67 per USD. Thus, the difference in price"
"between the two bids exceeds LKR 100 million."
"T
he  Respondents’  attempt  to  contend  that  the  Petitioner’s  product  would"
"necessitate  double  dosing  and  therefore  result  in  higher  expenditure  is  not"
"supported by the express tender specifications (marked ‘P17’) and appears to"
"constitute  a  post-hoc  rationalisation  rather 
than  a  conclusion  reached"
"through any recorded procurement evaluation. In any event, the Petitioner’s"
"product, being 1000ml in volume, falls within the specified range of 500ml to"
"2000ml and thus satisfies the volumetric and compositional requirements of"
"the tender."
"T
he  Respondents  seek  to  assert  that  the  Petitioner’s  product  is  a  “second-"
"generation” formulation and does not contain Omega-3 fatty acids. However,"
"the  tender  document  does  not  stipulate  that  the  presence  of  Omega-3  is"
"mandatory  or  that  only  third-generation 
formulations  would  be  deemed"
"responsive. The Petitioner’s bid was accepted at the bid opening stage, and"
"the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) has recorded that the Petitioner’s"
"bid was the “lowest evaluated substantially responsive bid”. At no stage was"
"the Petitioner notified that its bid was rejected on technical grounds. It is a"
"well-established principle that where a lower bid is rejected in the context of"
"a public procurement, the procuring authority bears the burden of assigning"
"reasons,  particularly  when  the  bid  has  not  been  expressly  declared  non-"
"responsive. The failure to provide any such reason or formal notice of rejection"
"constitutes  a 
violation 
of 
the  principles 
of  natural 
justice  and 
fair"
"administrative procedure."
"T
he Respondents further rely upon a previous incident in which a batch of"
"the  Petitioner’s  product  was  withheld  in  September  2023  by  the  NMRA"
"following a finding of discolouration in two units out of a total batch of 6,250"
"units.  However,  the  Petitioner  promptly  submitted  an  explanation  from  the"
"manufacturer  attributing  the  visual  deviation  to  minor  oxidative  changes"
"during  storage  or  transport,  which  was  asserted  to  have  no  bearing  on  the"
"pharmaceutical  efficacy  or  compliance  of  the  product.  The  NMRA  did  not"
"thereafter issue any decision, directive, or regulatory order declaring that the"
