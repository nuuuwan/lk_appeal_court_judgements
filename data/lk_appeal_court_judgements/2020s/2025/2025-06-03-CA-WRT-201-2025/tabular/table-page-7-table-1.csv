"The 6th and 7th Respondents, strongly oppose the grant of interim relief to the"
"Petitioner 
and 
assert 
that 
the 
Petitioner's 
application 
constitutes 
a"
"suppression  of  material  facts,  misrepresentation,  and  an  abuse  of  process,"
"warranting  dismissal  in  limine  without  issuance  of  notice.  They  emphasize"
"that  the  subject  tender  relates  to  the  procurement  of  Total  Parenteral"
"Nutrition (TPN), a life-saving intravenous therapy administered primarily to"
"critically ill ICU patients who are unable to intake nutrition through normal"
"digestive 
processes. 
The 
Respondents 
contend 
that 
the 
technical"
"specifications of the tender were framed by qualified medical experts to reflect"
"the  latest  clinical  advancements  in  TPN  formulation  and  explicitly  required"
"third-generation  TPN  products 
incorporating  Omega-3 
fatty  acids, 
or"
"alternatively, second-generation products only in the event third-generation"
"products were not submitted."
"T
he  Respondents  argue 
that 
their  product,  Nutriflex  Omega  Peri, 
fully"
"complies with the tender specifications as a third-generation TPN formulation"
"containing  Omega-3,  which  delivers  superior  clinical  outcomes  including"
"improved lipid metabolism, reduced inflammation, and lower infection risks."
"I
n contrast, they assert that the Petitioner's product, TNA Peri, is an outdated"
"second-generation formulation that does not contain Omega-3 or meet other"
"key  tender  specifications,  such  as  nitrogen  content,  and  therefore  does  not"
"qualify  as  a  ""responsive""  bid  within  the  meaning  of  public  procurement"
"principles. They further state that the Petitioner’s representation of being the"
"“lowest responsive bidder” is therefore false and misleading, as its bid is non-"
"compliant  in  material  respects  and  fails  to  meet  the  minimum  technical"
"threshold established by the tender."
"T
he Respondents place heavy reliance on an expert analysis issued by a panel"
"of 
independent  medical 
professionals 
associated  with 
the  Nutrition"
"Department of the Ministry of Health. This report, dated 27th December 2024"
"and annexed to the Hon. Attorney General’s Motion, concludes that Nutriflex"
"Omega Peri offers superior nutritional value and clinical safety compared to"
"TNA  Peri,  including  higher  caloric  content  (by  192  kcal),  more  protein  (10g"
"more),  better  lipid  profiles,  and  stronger  anti-inflammatory  properties.  The"
"report  also  states  that  the  need  to  administer  two  packs  of  TNA  Peri  per"
"patient per day to match the therapeutic efficacy of a single pack of Nutriflex"
"Omega Peri would incur higher costs, increase workload on clinical staff, and"
"heighten the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections, including sepsis."
"On this basis, the Respondents submit that selecting the Petitioner’s product"
"would not only compromise clinical care but also result in higher overall cost"
"to  the  State,  amounting  to  approximately  Rs.  109  million  more  than  the"
"Respondents' product despite the latter’s higher unit price."
"T
he  Respondents  also  contest  the  Petitioner's  claim  that  the  2023  batch"
"withholding  was  an 
isolated  or  minor 
issue, 
instead  arguing 
that 
the"
"Petitioner’s product had a demonstrable history of defective supply. They refer"
"to the Petitioner’s own letter of apology dated 23rd October 2023 addressed to"
"the Ministry of Health in which the manufacturer admits and apologizes for"
