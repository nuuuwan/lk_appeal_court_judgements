It was further contended that in gratitude she had allowed the said 7th Respondent to cultivate a portion of the land (paragraph 13 of the Petition). While admitting the transaction of money, the 7th Respondent contended that the said transaction had taken place not in 2005 but in the year 1999. It was their contention that the 1st Petitioner had transferred the disputed part of the corpus to the 7th and 8th Respondents for a sum of Rs 18,000. It is further contended that the said Respondents had been in possession of the corpus from the year 01.10.1999. In support of the said argument the 7th and 8th Respondents tendered the document marked as X1 which is signed by the 1st Petitioner and her late son. It appears the said document substantiates the 7th and 8th Respondents\u2019 contention. The Petitioners have not denied the execution of the said document. Pursuant to the said document the said Respondents had possessed the land and cultivated the land which is established by the documents X2(a). However, this Court observes that the 1st Petitioner being a signatory to the said X1 document has failed to disclose the existence of such a document, which in my view, is a serious suppression of material facts. Further, as per X2(a) and X2(b) it appears that the 7th Respondent had been in possession and cultivated the land from the year 2003, which contradicts the position of the Petitioners that they had allowed the said Respondent to cultivate the land in the year 2009. This in my view, is a misrepresentation of a material fact relevant to this case. It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioners tendered the document P5 and submitted that from 2009, the 7th and 8th Respondents had forcefully constructed a house in the premises in 2009. However, it is observed that if the 7th and 8th Respondents had constructed a house or were in illegal occupation of the premises, the compliant should have been lodged by the 1st Petitioner, who is the holder of the grant P2. There was no explanation offered by the Petitioners as to why the 1st Petitioner who was the grant holder did not see it fit to lodge a police complaint against the 7th and 8th Respondents.",
