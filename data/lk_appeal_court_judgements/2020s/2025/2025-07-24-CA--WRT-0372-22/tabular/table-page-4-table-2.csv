"as  a 
sympathetic  alternative,  despite  having 
sufficient 
grounds 
to"
"terminate them for misconduct."
"T
he  3rd  respondent  disputed  the  fact  referred  to  by  the  petitioner  in  the"
"petition.    The  3rd  respondent  took  up  several  preliminary  objections  to  the"
"petitioner’s  application. 
  The  3rd 
respondent  stated 
that 
initially, 
the"
"Commissioner of Labour, by letter dated 30-10-2013, marked P15, informed"
"the  3rd  respondent  that  the  complaint  regarding  the  payment  of  gratuity"
"should be resolved in the Labour Tribunal.  Then, the 3rd respondent filed a"
"Writ application, No. 33/2018, before the Court of Appeal, seeking to quash"
"the  decision  in  P15.    In  that  Writ  Application,  the  Learned  State  Counsel"
"appearing for the 1st and 2nd respondents stated to the Court on 26-07-2018,"
"that; “The Honourable Attorney General is agreeable not to proceed with the"
"order  of 
the  Commissioner  of  Labour  and  also  of 
the  view 
that 
the"
"Commissioner of Labour would be able to inquire into the issue of payment"
"of  gratuity  under 
inquiry  no.  PE/D11/05/123/2017.” 
 
In  view  of 
this"
"situation, 
the  petitioner 
(the  3rd  respondent 
in  the  present  application)"
"withdrew the application."
"T
he 
petitioner 
contended 
that 
the 
Attorney-General 
had 
given 
the"
"undertaking 
in 
the 
petitioner's 
absence. 
Therefore, 
the 
petitioner’s"
"contention is that he is not bound by the agreement reached between the 3rd"
"respondent and the Attorney-General, that the Commissioner would hold an"
"inquiry with regard to the issue of gratuity.  Further, the petitioner’s position"
"is 
that  by  agreement  of 
the  parties, 
the  Commissioner  will  not  get"
"jurisdiction 
to 
inquire 
into 
the 
issue  of  gratuity. 
It 
is  correct 
that  by"
"agreement  of 
the  parties, 
the  Commissioner  will  not  get 
jurisdiction."
"However,  the  Commissioner  has  the  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into  the  issues"
"regarding gratuity,  as set out by  the provisions of Section 8 of the Act. The"
"Attorney-General conceded that the Commissioner has the power to hold an"
"inquiry  regarding  the  issue  of  gratuity,  as  per  law.  In  these  circumstances,"
"the argument of the petitioner that the Commissioner had held an inquiry as"
"agreed  between 
the  3rd  respondent  and 
the  Commissioner 
in 
the  writ"
"application filed by the 3rd respondent, cannot be sustained."
