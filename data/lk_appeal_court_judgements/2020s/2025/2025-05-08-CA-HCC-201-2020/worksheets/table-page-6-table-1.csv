"8.  As stated above an eye witness may be able to establish the chain"
"of production. This is in effect proof by direct evidence. As proving"
"of any fact, it is also possible to be prove the chain of production"
"inferentially  by  circumstantial  evidence.  I  am  of  the  view  that"
"even the chain of productions may be proved by circumstantial"
"evidence.  One  such  instance  may  be  when  there  are  several"
"reserve  officers  who  have  had  custody  of  the  production  and  if"
"one such officer is not available the chain may be proved by the"
"evidence  of  other  witnesses  who  had  possession  prior  to  and"
"after, such officer, provided that both of previous and subsequent"
"officers clearly testify that the seals were intact. Then, may be if"
"the sealing officer confirms that the seals placed by him were duly"
"there  in  that  form, at  a  point  of  time  anterior  to  the  time  such"
"non available officer  handled the production. This is possible if"
"on the proved circumstances the only inference is that the seals"
"were intact, and there is no possible opportunity to tamper. The"
"whole requirement and necessity to prove the chain is to satisfy"
"court  that  the  very  production  that  was  recovered  from  the"
"appellant was forwarded to the Government Analyst in that form"
"and that there was no room for tampering. That being the legal"
"position,  reverting  back  to  the  facts  of  the  present  appeal,  the"
"issue is the absence of direct evidence as to the inward journey"
"of the chain during the time IP Amarajith had possession of the"
"same."
