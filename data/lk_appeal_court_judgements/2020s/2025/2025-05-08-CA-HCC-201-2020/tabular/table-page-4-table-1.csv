"the absence of IP Amarajith, the evidence of the chain of custody"
"as  well  as  the  main  raid  was  led  through  PW-2  and  PW-5. The"
"absence of main raiding officer will not  per se invalidate or will"
"not  make  the  proof  of  such  raid  inadmissible.  In  the  normal"
"course  of  events,  the  scheme  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  will"
"require the best evidence to be led. It  will be the evidence of IP"
"Amarajith. When this matter was taken up for trial, IP Amarajith"
"was  not  available.    In  these  circumstances,  if  there  be  other"
"witnesses  who  are  privy  and  has  witnessed  such  witness  are"
"competent to give evidence and such evidence if admitted will be"
"sufficient  to  prove  even  a  raid  of  this  nature.  Such  evidence  is"
"direct testimony of persons who have seen and perceived by their"
"own  senses  the  raid  and  recovery.  PW-2  and  PW-5  have  been"
"members  of  the  raiding  party.  They  have  been  present  with  IP"
"Amarajith from the very inception until the return and sealing of"
"the production. Therefore, these two witnesses are eye witnesses"
"to the events and happenings, the raid and recovery of this case."
"Such direct evidence is sufficient to prove the fact in issue of this"
