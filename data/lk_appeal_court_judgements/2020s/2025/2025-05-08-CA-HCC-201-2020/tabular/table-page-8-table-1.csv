"evidence. The appellant’s position is that he was apprehended at"
"his 
fish 
stall.  As 
for 
the  prosecution, 
the 
appellant  was"
"apprehended when he was walking towards the police party who"
"was waiting with the informant. It is common ground that a sum"
"of Rs. 61,000.00 was in the possession of the appellant. The police"
"party  had  handed  over  this  to  another.  This  item  of  evidence  is"
"significant 
in  considering 
the  probability  of 
the  prosecution"
"version  in  conjunction  with  the  defence  of  introduction.  If  the"
"appellant  was  apprehended  walking  along  a  road  and  a  large"
"quantity of heroin was recovered along with Rs. 61,000.00, isn’t it"
"normal and natural for the said money to taken as a production?"
"Isn’t it evidence of possible trafficking? In contrast the prosecution"
"position is that it was handed over to a person who was there. This"
"has the potential of leading to the inference that the appellant was"
"apprehended  on  suspicion  initially  but  the  recovery  was  made"
"later from another place. This is just the position suggested and"
"taken up by the defence. Considering the totality of the evidence,"
"this gives credence to the defence version and in the least a total"
"rejection of evidence of the defence would not be possible. This is"
"a  situation  where 
the  defence  evidence 
is  able 
to  create  a"
"reasonable  doubt  in  the  version  of  prosecution.  To  be  precise  a"
"doubt is created as to the mode of the detection and the manner"
"of recovery as narrated by the prosecution. The Trial Judge had"
"failed to appreciate this aspect which is in favour of the appellant."
"11. Similarly,  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  established  the  inward"
"journey of the chain of production. The learned Trial Judge has"
"failed to appreciate and consider these two aspects in that light. If"
"these two aspects were so considered, no reasonable Court could"
"have come to the findings of guilt as done by the Trial Judge. In"
"the above circumstances, it is not safe to allow the conviction to"
"stand. The learned Trial Judge has erred and misdirected himself"
