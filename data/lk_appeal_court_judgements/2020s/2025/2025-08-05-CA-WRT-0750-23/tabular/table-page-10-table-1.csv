the  petitioners  are  neither 
seeking 
to  quash 
the"
"","examination held in 2012, nor are they seeking a mandamus directing"
"","their  appointments  or  any  other  substantive  relief.  According  to  the"
"","learned Counsel for the petitioners, as the petitioners have been denied"
"","a fair hearing and an opportunity to participate at an inquiry before the"
"","PSC, they desire to pursue with this remedy to establish the denial of"
"","their said right. In short, what the petitioners are now seeking is a mere"
"","declaration, if at all, and no more. Substantive relief for their alleged"
"","grievance  has  been  already  addressed  and  granted  by  the  AAT  by  its"
"","Order dated 29.08.2023. The petitioners have now sat and participated"
"","in the subsequent examination exclusively held for them. The learned"
"","Counsel for the petitioner submitted that what the petitioners desire is"
"","setting aside of certain portions of P-36 and conceded that there is no"
"","substantive relief that they are seeking by way of a writ. Unfortunately,"
"","the jurisdiction of this Court is to issue writs and not declarations. In"
"","these  circumstances,  in  the  absence  of  any  substantive  and  effective"
"","relief sought or that could be granted, this application is now academic"
"and futile to that extent.",""
"Futility.",""
"","5.  The petitioners have been afforded the opportunity of sitting for a fresh"
"examination.  It","is  also  specifically  ordered  that 
if  any  one  of  the"
"","petitioners was successful at the said examination, their appointments"
"","be with effect from 23.06.2020 on a supernumerary basis until they are"
"","absorbed into the permanent cadre. Accordingly, the petitioners will not"
"","be in a lesser position to those who were successful and appointed upon"
"the","first  examination.  To  my  mind,  the  Order  P-36  by  itself,  has"
"","provided  everything  the  petitioners  required  to  rectify  the  alleged"
"","prejudice  that  may  have  been  caused  by  the  defective  examination."
