"perfected  papers  for  nomination  are  submitted,  such  owner  or  permit"
"holder is entitled to expect the same to be duly submitted for registration"
"and  registered  without  delay.  Correspondingly,  the  acceptance  of  the"
"duly completed nomination papers by the Divisional Secretary amounts"
"to a holding out that the same will be duly registered without delay. If"
"there be a lapse on the part of the Divisional Secretary or any other, the"
"owner’s intent and the nominee’s rights cannot be denied or prejudiced"
"thereby. In the circumstances of this application, especially in view of"
"the clear admission by the Divisional Secretary of his lapse and in the"
"absence of any other subsequent competing nomination or registration"
"of a subsequent nomination, I hold that upon the tendering of the papers"
"for  nomination,  it  ought  to  be  deemed  that  the  same  had  been  so"
"registered in due course. This will then be well before the date of death"
"of the owner in this application."
