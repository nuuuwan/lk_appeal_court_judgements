"respondent had defaulted on loan payments."
"8.  To avoid an auction, the 1st respondent requested the petitioner to pay"
"Rs. 1,700,000/- to cover the outstanding loan and retain the excess. The"
"petitioner 
subsequently 
transferred  Rs. 
1,057,500/- 
to 
the 
1st"
"respondent's account for Sampath Bank dues, paid Rs. 172,500/- to the"
"2nd  respondent,  and  received  the  property  keys.  Upon  executing  the"
"Deed of Transfer (No. 9378 dated November 5, 2012), the petitioner paid"
"an additional Rs. 270,000/- to the 2nd respondent and Rs. 60,000/- to"
"the  Notary  Public,  bringing 
the 
total  paid 
to  approximately  Rs."
"2,000,000/-. Crucially, the petitioner discovered that only one of the two"
"mortgage  bonds  had  been  released  by  Sampath  Bank.  Around  April"
"2013,  the  petitioner  took  possession  and  undertook  developments  on"
"the property."
"9.  Subsequently,  the  1st  respondent,  through  the  2nd  respondent,  filed"

"Board under Section 14 of the Ordinance to release the property. The"
"Board,  in  an  order  dated  October  4,  2023,  found  that  the  Deed  of"
"Transfer was merely a security for the amount owed to the petitioner,"
"not an outright transfer. The petitioner sought a review, which the Board"
"reaffirmed on May 8, 2024. The petitioner then objected, arguing that"
"the application could not be made through a Power of Attorney. Despite"
"the Board finding that the 1st respondent lacked locus standi to institute"
"proceedings via a Power of Attorney holder, it overruled the petitioner's"
"objections  on  October  30,  2024.  On  November  20,  2024,  the  Board"
"issued  a  certificate  under  section  32(2)  of  the  Act,  stating  that  the"
"petitioner  must  pay  an  additional  Rs.  1,200,000/-  and 
that 
the"
"respondents were debtors, not vendors. This certificate was sent to the"
"Kegalle Land Registry for registration on January 8, 2025."
