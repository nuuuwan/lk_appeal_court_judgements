"Acquisition Act. Subsequently, an order in respect of compensation had"
"been made. The petitioners then sought to amend and add the said order"
"to the said application. Samayawardhena, J., held as follows:"
"“The acquisition process ends with an award of compensation to"
"the persons whose lands have been acquired. Notwithstanding the"
"acquisition process and compensation process are interconnected"
"and  cannot  be  considered  in  watertight  compartments,  they  are"
"two different processes for which different principles apply. In my"
"view,  an  award  of  compensation  is  a  different  cause  of  action,"
"which has accrued, according to learned Counsel for the Petitioners"
"himself, after the filing of this application.”"
