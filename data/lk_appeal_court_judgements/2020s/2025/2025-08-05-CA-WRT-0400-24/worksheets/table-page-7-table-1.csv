"10. The petitioner alleges that the Board failed to consider key aspects of"
"Section 21A of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance, such as the petitioner's"
"possession  of 
the  property, 
the  Deed's  clear 
language  of  vacant"
"possession, the lack of an interest agreement, and the 1st respondent's"
"failure to prove the Deed was a mortgage. The petitioner claims the 1st"
"respondent  is  perpetrating  fraud  by  not  discharging  the  secondary"
"mortgage,  a  fact  discovered  when  attempting  to  obtain  a  loan  from"
"Commercial  Bank, 
and 
asserts  he 
is 
a 
bona 
fide 
purchaser."
"Furthermore, the petitioner contends that the Board's order of October"
"4, 2023, was invalid as it was signed by only two members, falling short"
"of 
the  required 
three-member  quorum  under  Section  3(2)  of 
the"
"Ordinance."
