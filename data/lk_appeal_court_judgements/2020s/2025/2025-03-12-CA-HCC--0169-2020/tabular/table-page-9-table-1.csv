"CA/HCC/0169/20"
"Circumstantial  evidence  is  generally  admissible  in  court,  but  it's  crucial"
"that the evidence is relevant to the case, has probative value and is reliable."
"As this case is hanging on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution should"
"prove  the  guilt  of  the  Appellant  through  circumstantial  evidence  which"
"must be conclusive in nature."
