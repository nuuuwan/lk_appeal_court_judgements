"is  to  the  effect  that  the  Magistrate  cannot  call  for  any  evidence  from  the"
"competent  authority 
in  support  of  the  application  under  section  5,  which"
"means  that  the  Magistrate  cannot  call  upon  the  competent  authority  to  prove"
"that  the  land  described  in  the  schedule  to  the  application  is  a  State  Land"
"(Section  5(1)(a)(ii))......The  structure  of  the  Act  would  also  make  it  appear  that"
"where  the  competent  authority  had  formed  the  opinion  that  any  land  is  state"
"land, even, the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion. Alternative"
"relief  is  given  by  section  12  which  empowers  any  person  claiming  to  be  the"
"owner  of  a  land  to  institute  action  against  state  for  the  vindication  of  his  title"
"within 6 months from the date of the order of ejectment and section 13 is to the"
"effect that where action is instituted by a person, if a decision is made in favour"
"of  that  person,  he  will  be  entitled  to  recover  reasonable  compensation  for  the"
"damage  sustained  by  the  reason  of  his  having  been  compelled  to  deliver"
"possession of such land...”."
"It  was 
this  Court 
in  CA/PHC/41/2010  decided  on 
inter-alia,  held  by"
"31.01.2017 that, “The party noticed is not entitled to challenge the opinion of"
"the  competent  authority  on  any  of  the  matters  stated  in  the  application....By"
"this amendment, the opinion of the competent authority in relation to the state"
"land was made unquestionable....”."
"It  was  inter-alia,  held  by  this  Court  in  CA  (PHC)  APN  29/2016-decided  on"
"09.07.2018  that,  “....He  cannot  contest  any  of  the  matters  stated 
in  the"
"application made under section 5 of the Act. One of the matters required to be"
"stated  in  the  application  is  that  the  land  described  in  the  schedule  to  the"
"application  is  in  the  opinion  of  the  competent  authority  state  land.  This  fact"
"cannot  be  contested  by  the  person  summoned....Hence,  a  dispute  on  the"
"identity  of  the  land  cannot  arise  for  consideration  of  the  learned  Magistrate."
"The 
identity  of  the 
land  can  arise 
for  consideration  only  to  the  extent  of"
"examining whether the valid permit or other written authority produced by the"
"party  summoned  is  in  relation  to  the  state  land  described  in  the  application."
