"Although  there  is  no  duty  as  such  cast  upon  a  competent  authority  by  the"
"provisions  of 
the  Act,  nonetheless, 
the  Respondent  being 
the  competent"
"authority had identified the State Land as being a part of lot 3458 in extent of 1"
"Rood, 12.84 Perches as morefully, shown and depicted in the Plan bearing No."
"w...mß 779  අ(cid:4059)ෙ(cid:4225)ක 21 (Final Village Plan 779-Supplementary 21) which is the"
"possession  of  Surveyor-General.(Vide-Schedule 
to 
the  application  made 
to"
"Court by the Respondent under section 5 of the Act)"
"Hence, the Appellant’s argument that the land is not a state land but, a private"
"land  claimed  by  him  by  virtue  of  the  pedigree  pleaded  in  his  showing  cause"
"filed  before  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Embilipitiya,  cannot  sustain  at  least,  for"
"two reasons; one being that, he is precluded by section 9(1) and 9(2) of the Act"
"from  raising  such  a  contest  on  the  land-the  subject  matter  of  the  application"
"made  to  Court  by  the  Respondent  being  the  competent  authority;  the  other"
"being  that  although,  the  Respondent-being  the  competent  authority  does  not"
"have any burden in an inquiry before the Magistrate so to do, nevertheless, the"
"land  in  dispute  had  been  properly,  identified  by  the  Respondent  being  the"
"competent authority with reference to a plan previously, made and prepared by"
"the Surveyor-General. [Emphasis is mine]"
"On the other hand, the Respondent being the competent authority had already,"
"formed  an  opinion  that  the  land-the  subject  matter  of  the  application,  is  a"
"State Land and that the Appellant is in unauthorized possession or occupation"
"therein.  However,  as  observed  by  me  elsewhere 
in 
this 
judgment, 
it 
is"
"significant  to  note  that,  not  an  iota  of  evidence  had  been  adduced  by  the"
"Appellant to establish that he is in possession or occupation of the State Land"
"upon  a  valid  permit  or  other  written  authority  of 
the  State,  granted 
in"
"accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force"
"and  not  revoked  or  otherwise  rendered  invalid  as  required  by  section  9  of  the"
"Act. Hence, the Appellant did not have semblance of such a permit or authority"
"as envisaged by section 9 of the Act."
