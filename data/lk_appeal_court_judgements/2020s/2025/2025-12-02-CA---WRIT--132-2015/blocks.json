An act by a public authority which lacks legal authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its illegality is established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will be regarded as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it will be regarded as incapable of ever having produced legal effects.\" (emphasis added) ............In fact, Wade and Forsyth (supra, page 305) state that the statement of Lord Denning in MacFoy v.

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295]. However, this presumption of validity exists pending a final decision by the court [Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 AC 143 at 156 and 161, and 173-4].\" In view of the rationale upheld in the above case, I opine that although the purported Order published in Gazette marked A4 had been made ultra vires by the 1st Respondent, the purported re-vesting does not become ab initio void automatically. Hence, I am not inclined to accept the stance of the Petitioner that the purported re-vesting Order published in the Gazette marked A4 is ab initio void. Until such re-vesting Order is set aside by a competent court, the validity of such Order will stand. Collateral Challenge However, the Petitioner in the instant application collaterally challenges the Gazette A4, in which the said re-vesting Order had been published. His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva, in Kelani Valley Plantations PLC case (Supra) has even referred to a judgement pronounced by His Lordship in the Court of Appeal in McCallum Brewing Company (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of Excise and Another [C.A. Writ 469/2008, C.A.M. 18.12.2019] where it was held (at page 5) that an ultra vires act can be challenged in two ways including by way of a collateral challenge. Nevertheless, finally, the Appeal Court, for the reasons given therein, rejected the contention of the Respondent that the validity of the order in issue can be impugned in those proceedings by way of collateral challenge.",

    "text": "The right of the Petitioner to hold the Penrith Estate emanate from the Indenture of Lease marked A3 entered into between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent. The Respondents submit that the above Indenture of Lease provides an arbitration clause for dispute settlement and therefore the Petitioner is not entitled to seek Writ jurisdiction of this Court. Nevertheless, the 2nd Respondent is not a party to Indenture of Lease marked A3. Further, Legality of an administrative action such as the issuance of the revesting Order published in the Gazette dated 03.10.03 marked A4 is not one which is capable of determination by arbitration. Such determination as to legality of an administrative act of the State or a State Agencies has to be exclusively determined by this Court exercising writ jurisdiction. As such, I am of the view that the Petitioner could not have obtained the reliefs prayed under the instant application before an Arbitral Tribunal. Thus, in the given instance, I do not view that the arbitration as agreed by the parties is an equally effective alternative remedy.",
