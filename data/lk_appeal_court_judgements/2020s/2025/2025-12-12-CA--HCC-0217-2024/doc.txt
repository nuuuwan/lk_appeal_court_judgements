Judgment

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the appellant”) has preferred the

instant appeal against the sentence imposed on him by the learned High Court Judge

of Tangalle. The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Tangalle on two

counts of grave sexual abuse.

2. As the appellant initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, the trial commenced on

27.05.2024. However, during the pendency of the trial, the appellant withdrew his

earlier plea and pleaded guilty to both counts. Accordingly, the learned High Court

Judge convicted the appellant on both counts and sentenced him as follows:

a) For the first count: Ten years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

5,000/-, carrying a default sentence of three months’ rigorous imprisonment.

b) For the second count: Twelve years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

5,000/-, carrying a default sentence of three months’ rigorous imprisonment.

c) Furthermore, the learned Trial Judge ordered the appellant to pay Rs.

400,000/- as compensation to the victim, carrying a default sentence of six

months’ simple imprisonment. These sentences were ordered to run

consecutively.

3. The learned Counsel for the appellant, at the hearing, confined his submissions solely

to the question of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the sole question for determination in this appeal is whether the sentence

imposed on the appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle is excessive in

the circumstances of the case.

Background to the appeal:

4. The victim was 16 years old at the time of the offence. On the day of the incident, he

was waiting at an isolated spot near a canal, having avoided a tuition class scheduled

for that day. It was at this point that the appellant approached him and assaulted him.

5. Thereafter, the appellant asked the victim to remove his clothes and proceeded to

sexually assault him by inserting his penis into the victim’s anus. The appellant also

compelled the victim to perform oral sex on him, which the victim did out of fear.

6. Subsequently, the appellant took Rs. 2,500 from the victim’s purse and threatened to

hand him over to the police. The appellant falsely represented himself as a police

officer. After the incident, the victim walked toward the town. On his way, a person in

a vehicle stopped and asked him why he was wet and why his clothes were muddy.

The victim then began to cry. This person took the victim to a nearby boutique and,

ultimately, he was handed over to his parents.

7. It can be observed that, following the conviction, both the prosecution and the defence

made submissions regarding the appropriate sentence. The learned High Court Judge

carefully considered the submissions made by both parties before imposing the

sentence.

8. In this case, the victim was a boy of 16 years of age, while the appellant was 22 years

old at the time of the offence. In determining the appropriateness of the sentence for

offences of this nature, the Court must consider several factors, including the age of

the victim, the age of the appellant, the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim,

the degree of violence used, the need for deterrence in society, and the past conduct of

the appellant.

CA/HCC/0217/2024

9. Usually, courts regard the young age of an offender as a mitigating factor in the

sentencing process. However, the young age of the victim cannot, by itself, be treated

as a mitigating consideration when dealing with an offence of this nature. If an

offender, due to youthfulness, is genuinely unable to comprehend the gravity or

consequences of the act, such immaturity may be considered in mitigation, provided

that no aggravating circumstances exist.

10. In the present case, after five witnesses had testified for the prosecution, the appellant

withdrew his earlier plea and pleaded guilty to both charges. Apart from the young

age of the appellant, no other mitigating factor was advanced by learned counsel

during submissions before the High Court. It must also be noted that the victim was

himself a young boy, and the offence was committed after the appellant instilled fear

in him by threatening to hand him over to the police. The victim was alone and in an

isolated location at the time the offence was committed.

11. Culpability will be increased where an offender deliberately targets a victim due to an

actual or perceived vulnerability. Likewise, culpability is further aggravated where the

victim’s vulnerability is created or exacerbated by the offender’s own actions.

12. In the instant case, the Medico-Legal Report reveals the gravity of the offence,

particularly the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim as a result of the acts

committed by the appellant. There is clear evidence of both anal and oral intercourse,

in addition to other physical injuries. In the Medico Legal Report, the JMO has

unequivocally stated that he observed anal tears and fresh bleeding on the victim.

Additionally, the victim had suffered a traumatic perforation of the eardrum, probably

as a result of the assault by the appellant. All these injuries undoubtedly constitute

aggravating factors warranting a lengthy and rigorous custodial sentence.

13. The manner in which the appellant exploited the vulnerability and tender age of the

victim, his threatening conduct, the assault on the victim, and the fact that he also took

the money in the victim’s possession, all dissuade this Court from extending any

clemency to the appellant. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the appellant

suffered from any emotional or mental imbalance or disturbance or was under any

external provocation while committing this offence.

14. The learned trial Judge has adequately and comprehensively analyzed the facts of the

case and has also taken into account the relevant case law in determining the

appropriate sentence. In this regard, the following authorities are also of considerable

relevance.

15. In Attorney General v Hewa Walimunige Gunasena CA/PHC/110/2012 (Decided on

12-02-2014) it was held:

After analyzing the submissions made by the Petitioner and the Accused-

Respondent I am of the opinion that the facts relating to this case warrants

that the accused should be severely dealt with. Therefore, a sentence of two

years rigorous imprisonment suspended for ten years on the accused for a

grave child abuse is a very lenient sentence considering the beastliness of the

crime. When an offence of child abuse is proved victims of tender age and

innocent behavior the sentence of imprisonment should be imposed severely.

Further I hold two years R.I suspended for tend years is not adequate for the

purpose of preventing the commission of further offences by the accused.

Cases of indecent touching, threats by an older man on a small girl seem to

attract custodial sentence.

16. In State of Andra Pradesh v. Bodem Sundara Rao, (1995) 6 SCC 230, AIR 1996 SC

530 it was held that:

These crimes are an affront to the human dignity of the society. Imposition of

grossly inadequate sentence and particularly against the mandate of the

Legislature not only is an injustice to the victim of the crime in particular and

the society as a whole in general but also at times encourages a criminal. The

Courts have an obligation while awarding punishment to impose appropriate

punishment so as to respond to the society's cry for justice against such

criminals. Public abhorrence of the crime needs a reflection through the

Courts verdict in the measure of punishment. The Courts must not only keep in

view the right of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of crime and the

society at large while considering imposition of the appropriate punishment.

17. In Archbold: Sentencing Guidelines (2019), Thomson Reuters, on page 274, under

the heading of applicability of guidelines on sexual offences, it is stated that;

“Starting points define the position within a category range from which to start

calculating the provisional sentence.

……… Once the starting point is established, the court should consider further

aggravating and mitigating factors and previous convictions so as to adjust

the sentence within the range. Starting points and ranges apply to all

offenders, whether they have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trial.”

18. Furthermore, it is necessary to accentuate that sexual violence victims often

experience a deep sense of shame, stigma and violation. Given the fact that sexual

violence is a degrading, humiliating and brutal invasion of the security of the person,

a victim is most often left with psychological injuries that are far more serious and

difficult to detect than physical injuries.

19. Furthermore, it is worthy to note that crimes of this nature are on the rise, and the

Legislature, in its wisdom, has prescribed stringent sentences in order to ensure

deterrence, particularly with a view to protecting children. Harsh sentences aim to

deter potential offenders and also prevent the convicted offender from reoffending.

Hence, society’s interest in preventing harm to children justifies adopting a

deterrence-based sentence approach.

20. In assessing the severity of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge, it

is necessary to consider the gravity of the offences committed. In the present case, the

appellant not only subjected the victim to repeated acts of grave sexual abuse but also

inflicted physical violence upon him. As set out in the Medico-Legal Report, the

victim sustained a ruptured eardrum, demonstrating the degree of force used during

the commission of the offences. Moreover, the presence of bleeding and tears in the

anal region further illustrates the brutality and inhumanity of the appellant’s conduct.

21. These factors undoubtedly constitute significant aggravating circumstances,

warranting the imposition of a deterrent and proportionate custodial sentence. The

learned High Court Judge, in my view, has correctly taken these circumstances into

account in determining an appropriate sentence. Thus, on balancing the mitigating and

CA/HCC/0217/2024

7 | P a g e

aggravating circumstances, it is apparent that aggravating circumstances far

outweighs the mitigating circumstance.

22. This Court is also mindful of the sentence stipulated in the Penal Code for this

offence. Section 365B (2)(b) of the Penal Code reads:

Whoever Commits grave sexual abuse on any person under eighteen years of

age, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than

seven years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be

ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person

in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such

person;

23. For the reasons comprehensively set out above, I see no basis upon which this Court

should extend any clemency to the appellant. The sentences imposed by the learned

High Court Judge are, in my view, lawful, proportionate, and amply justified by the

gravity of the offences and the aggravating circumstances surrounding their

commission.

24. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the sentences imposed by the learned High

Court Judge are hereby affirmed. The sentence shall run from the date of conviction.
