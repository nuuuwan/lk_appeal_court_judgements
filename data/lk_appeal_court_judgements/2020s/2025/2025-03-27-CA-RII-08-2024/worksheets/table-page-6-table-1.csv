"Colombo  has  granted  the  enjoining  orders  sought  which  were  effective  from  21st  of  June"
"2023 to 5th of July 2023. However, after the inquiry by written submission, the learned High"
"Court Judge has set aside the enjoining orders issued on 21st of June 2023 and the application"
"for the interim injunction has been dismissed with a cost. Being aggrieved by the said order"
"the  Petitioner  has  made  an  application  for  restituio  in  integrum  and  /  Revision  in  terms  of"
"Article 138 of the constitution."
"The impugned order dated 19th of January 2024 by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo"
"is  related  only  to  the  interim  relief  sought  by  the  Petitioner  and  the  main  matter  is  still"
"pending in the High Court."
"It is the contention of the Petitioner that the learned High Court Judge in his order dated 19th"
"of January 2024 has failed to consider the necessary provisions of law under the Intellectual"
"Property Act No 36 of 2003. However, since the application has been made by the Petitioner"
"against the dismissal of the Interim Relief and the enjoining order sought in the plaint, I will"
"be focusing on this aspect."
"The  initial  application  in  the  High  Court  was  instituted  by  the  Petitioners  to  protect  the"
"trademark and / trade name “Drools” to be not interrupted by the Respondents. Accordingly,"
"the Petitioner has sought the following  reliefs,"
