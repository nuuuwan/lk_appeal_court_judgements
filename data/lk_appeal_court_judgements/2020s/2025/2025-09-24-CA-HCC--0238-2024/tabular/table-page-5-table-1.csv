"but  in  that  case  all  communications  between  them  shall  cease  to  be"
"privileged."
"In view of the Section 81 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance 48"
"of  1939  (as  amended)  the  wife  or  husband  of  a  person  charged  with  an"
"offence specified in the First Schedule shall be a competent witness for the"
"prosecution."
"Therefore, the first ground advanced by the Appellant has no merit."
"In  the  second  ground  of  appeal  the  Learned  Counsel  contended  that  the"
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  evaluate  the  inter  se  and  per  se"
"contradictions  of  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  prosecution  witnesses  and"
"thereby had erroneously decided that the prosecution has proved the case"
"beyond a reasonable doubt."
"The  victim  had  given  evidence  without  any  contradictions  or  omissions."
"When the incident happened, she was only 11 years old. But her evidence"
"was quite consistent and clearly implicated the Appellant."
"PW2 had given evidence and reasonably explained why she was delayed in"
"going to the police. Although PW2 did not believe the victim, she had gone to"
"the police three days after the incident and lodged the complaint."
"As the evidence given by the victim is clear and quite consistent, the Learned"
"High Court Judge has accurately considered and accepted them in this case."
"Hence, this ground of appeal is devoid any merit."
"In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  failed  to  evaluate  the  evidence  adduced  on  behalf  of  the"
"Appellant."
"The Learned High Court Judge had accurately stated in his judgment that"
"the  stance  taken  by  the  Appellant  in  his  evidence  did  not  tally  with  his"
"defence taken during the trial. Further, the Learned High Court Judge had"
"commented that the Appellant had presented his defence as an afterthought."
