"According to the above, such Commission should be established as per"
"the  provisions  of  Constitution.  As  I  see,  the  Provincial  Co-operative"
"Employees’ Commission is established under the Provincial Statute No."
"5 of 2019. All that  the Constitution provides  for by item 17  of List I  is"
"that the Provincial Council is empowered to make statutes in respect of"
"the said subject matter, namely the Provincial Co-operative Employees’"
"Commission. The said Schedule to the Constitution does no more than"
"provide for and declare the authority of the relevant Provincial Council to"
"legislate 
in 
respect  of  such  matters.  This,  by  no  stretch  of 
the"
"imagination,  can  be  deemed, 
interpreted,  or  considered  as  being"
"provision  to  establish  such  Commission  by  the  Constitution.  What  is"
"contemplated  by 
the  said  Clause  1.13  of  the  Circular 
is  that  the"
"provisions  as  to  the  establishment  and  creation  of  such  Commission"
"should  be  provided  for  by  and  in  the  Constitution  in  that  form.  The"
"Constitution  merely  specifies 
the  authority  empowered 
to  make  or"
"promulgate enabling statutes to create and establish such a Commission."
"The statutory provisions as to the establishment and creation of the said"
"Commission are provided by the said Provincial Statute. For all purposes,"
"the  said  Commission,  namely  the  Provincial  Co-operative  Employees’"
"Commission, is established by the Co-operative Employees’ Commission"
"of 
the  Southern  Province,  Statute  No.  01/1998,  and  not  by 
the"
"Constitution. Accordingly, the decision made and conveyed by P-20, to"
"my mind, is correct and lawful."
