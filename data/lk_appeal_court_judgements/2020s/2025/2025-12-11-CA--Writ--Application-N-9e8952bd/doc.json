  "keywords": "The original grantee had passed away without nominating a successor; thus, his spouse became the life interest holder in terms of Section 48B of the Land Development Ordinance. She had nominated the 5th Respondent, who is the sibling of the Petitioner, as the successor, which was accepted and registered by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner challenged the said acceptance and registration of the 5th Respondent as the successor. Writ of Certiorari issued since the decision contravenes Section 48B. However, refused to issue a Writ of Mandamus to consider the Petitioner as the successor to the life interest holder since that question does not arise until her demise.",
