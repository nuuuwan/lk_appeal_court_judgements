"subdural hemorrhage that pre-existed in the deceased was precipitated by the sudden"
"movement of the brain. The JMO categorically stated that the contusion on the head had"
"no  connection  whatsoever  with  the  subdural  hemorrhage  observed  in  the  deceased."
"Thus, there is hardly any evidence to satisfy the criteria stipulated under the third limb"
"of Section 294 of the Penal Code."
