"","2.  The  trial  was  conducted  before  the  Judge  of  the  High  Court  without  a  jury.  Upon"
"","conclusion  of  the  trial,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  convicted  the  Appellant  and"
"","accordingly, imposed death sentence on him."
"","3.  Being  aggrieved by the  said  conviction  and sentence, the  appellant  has preferred the"
"","present appeal. The grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant are as follows:"
"","a.  The learned High Court Judge has not taken into account the inter-se"
"","contradictions of the prosecution evidence;"
"","b.  The learned High Court Judge has failed to pay due attention to the"
"","submissions made by the defense;"
"","c.  The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the weaknesses and want"
"","of credibility of the prosecution evidence; and"
"","d.  The judgment is contrary to the evidence led at the trial."
"4.","In the appeal, counsel for the Appellant primarily argued that the Learned High Court"
"","Judge failed to address the issue of mens rea and the accused's knowledge, particularly"
"","in light of the autopsy report, which does not support a finding of murder. It was further"
"","submitted that the death occurred three days after the alleged assault, and that it was the"
"","Appellant who took the deceased to the hospital. Based on these facts, it was argued that"
"","the Appellant’s subsequent conduct also demonstrates that he did not have a murderous"
"","intention at the time of the assault."
"","5.  Opposing the Appellant's argument, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that,"
"","even if the Appellant did not intend to cause the death, he cannot be exonerated from"
"","the charge of murder, as the injuries sustained by the deceased were sufficient, in  the"
"","ordinary course of nature, to cause death."
"","6.  The  Respondents  placed  much  reliance  in  Withana  and  Another  vs  The  Republic"
"","[2007] (1) SLR 169 and Gunasiri & Two Others vs Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] SLR"
"","39."
"7.","In view of the arguments advanced by both parties, the issue of paramount importance"
"","to be determined in the present appeal is whether the Appellant’s conviction for murder"
"","can  be  sustained,  given  the  extent  of  the  injuries  observed  on  the  deceased  and  the"
"","manner in which the Appellant acted. It is also pertinent to examine whether the blows"
"","inflicted by the Appellant directly contributed to the death of the deceased, or whether"
