"r","eferring to the postmortem report, the JMO  testified and explained the extent of the",""
"injuries observed on the deceased and the cause of death.","",""
"","22. According to the postmortem report, the external injuries are described as follows:",""
"","1.  2 x 1.5 cm contusion on the front of left side of forehead upper area it is 6 cm",""
"away from the midline and 5 cm above to the left eyebrow.","",""
"2.  3.5 cm x 0.3 mm abrasion on back of left elbow.","",""
"3.  0.5 x 0.5 cm abrasion front of right knee 36 cm above to the heel.","",""
"","23. What is apparent from the above evidence is that it was not the contusion that caused",""
"","the subdural hemorrhage, but rather a sudden movement of the brain that damaged the",""
"blood vessels and resulted in the hemorrhage.","",""
"","24. The above opinion was further confirmed by Prosecution Witness No. 2, who stated in",""
"","her testimony that the appellant aggressively pushed the deceased, causing her to fall to",""
"","the ground. Thus, it is most probable that the act of pushing the deceased, causing her",""
"","to  fall  to  the  floor,  resulted  in  an  acute  subdural  hemorrhage  placed  over  a  chronic",""
"subdural hemorrhage, which ultimately led to her death.","",""
"","25. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that the appellant acted with any murderous intention",""
"","when pushing the deceased. More importantly, as the JMO clearly stated that, apart from",""
"","two abrasions and one contusion, no other injuries were observed on the body of  the",""
"","deceased, there is insufficient evidence to infer a murderous intention on the part of the",""
"appellant.","",""
"","26. Furthermore, according to the JMO’s findings, there was no skull fracture or fracture of",""
"","the neck bones. Similarly, there was no evidence of fractures in any other bones. The",""
"","cause  of  death,  as  stated  in  the  report,  was  an  acute-on-chronic  right-sided  subdural",""

"","27. It  is  clear  that  the  immediate  cause  of  death—namely,  acute-on-chronic  right-sided",""

"","whether a conviction for murder can be justified on the basis of the evidence presented",""
