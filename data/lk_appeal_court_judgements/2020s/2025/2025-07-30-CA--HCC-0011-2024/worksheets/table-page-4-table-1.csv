"15. In State of Maharashtra v Arun Savalaram 1989 - CR LJ 191, Indian Court observed"
"""For the application of this clause it must be first established that an injury is"
"caused, next it must be established objectively what the nature of that injury in"
"the ordinary course of nature is. If the injury is found to be sufficient to cause"
"death one test is satisfied. Then it must be proved that there was an intention to"
"inflict that very injury and not some other injury and that it was not accidental"
"or unintentional. If this is also held against the offender the offence of murder is"
"established.”"
