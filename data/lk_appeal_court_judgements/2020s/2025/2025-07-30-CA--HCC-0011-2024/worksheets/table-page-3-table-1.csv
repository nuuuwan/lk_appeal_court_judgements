"","the death occurred as a result of a supervening factor arising from the injuries inflicted"
"","by the Appellant."
"8.  Section 294 of the Penal Code reads:",""
"Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder-",""
"","Firstly    - if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing"
"","death; or"
"","Secondly - If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender"
"","knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused;"
"","or"
"","Thirdly   - If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the"
"","bodily  injury  intended  to  be  inflicted  is  sufficient  in  the  ordinary  course  of"
"","nature to cause death; or"
"","Fourthly - If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that"
"","it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause"
"","death,  and  commits  such  act  without  any  excuse  for  incurring  the  risk  of"
"","causing death or such injury as aforesaid."
"9.","It is clear that the intention contemplated under the first limb of Section 294 of the Penal"
"","Code is the intention to cause death, commonly referred to as murderous intention. In"
"","contrast, the intention under the third limb of Section 294 refers to the intention to cause"
"","bodily  injury  not  necessarily  death.  However,  the  bodily  injury  inflicted  must  be"
"","sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature, to cause death. The emphasis under the third"
"","limb is therefore on the sufficiency of the injury to cause death in the ordinary course of"
"","nature, rather than on the intention to cause death itself."
"","10. At  the  trial,  the  prosecution  evidence  revealed  that  the  assault  occurred  when  the"
"","Appellant  insisted  that  the  deceased  take  her  meals,  which  she  refused.  It  was  also"
"","established that, following the assault, the Appellant himself sponged the bruised areas"
"","of  the  deceased  with  hot  water  and  accompanied  her  to  the  hospital.  These  actions"
"","indicate that the Appellant did not act with any murderous intention."
"","11. Therefore, the culpability of the Appellant in the present case must be assessed under"
"","the third limb of Section 294, namely, whether the bodily injury intended and inflicted"
