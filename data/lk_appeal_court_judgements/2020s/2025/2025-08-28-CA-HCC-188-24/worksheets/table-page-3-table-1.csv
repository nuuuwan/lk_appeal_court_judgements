"Being  aggrieved  by  the  afore-mentioned  conviction  and  the  sentence,  the  Accused  has"
"preferred this appeal to this Court. The following are the grounds of appeal as pleaded by"
"the Accused."
"1.  The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the inherent improbable and"
"contradictory nature of the Prosecution’s case;"
"2.  The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the glaring contradictions"
"and  the  omissions  in the  evidence  of  the  alleged  eyewitness,  PW  03,  Wijjapathi"
"Muththalage  Sarath  Chandradasa,  which  raises  serious  concerns  about  the"
"authenticity of the Prosecution’s case;"
"3.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  Inter se  and  per se"
"contradictions between the material Prosecution witnesses;"
"4.  The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of PW 01"
"is not corroborated from any independent source, and her evidence does not inspire"
"confidence;"
"When the  matter  was supported on 28.07.2025,  the  Counsel for  the  Accused  Appellant"
"informed the Court that he only challenged the sentence imposed and sought a mitigation"
"in the sentence."
"At the inquiry before sentencing, the Accused tendered the following in mitigation."
"1.  The Accused has no prior convictions"
"2.  At this time, the Accused is approximately 60 years old."
"3.  The Accused’s wife is in poor health, and he takes her to medical clinics."
"4.  The Accused actively attended court proceedings related to this case both in the"
"Magistrate and High Courts, for over nine years."
"5.  The Accused is also responsible for the care and upbringing of his daughter’s two"
"children, who are currently living under his custody."
"Further, the following aggravating factors were indicated by the learned State Counsel:"
"1.  The offence was committed by the Accused when the victim was around 14 years"
"old and the Accused was 51 years old."
"2.  The  Accused,  being  a  close  relative  to  the  victim,  is  a  person  with  a  social"
"responsibility to provide care to the victim."
