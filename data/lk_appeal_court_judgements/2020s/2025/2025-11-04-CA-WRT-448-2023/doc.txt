ORDER REGARDING AMENDMENT TO THE PETITION

This application was filed on 07.08.2023 challenging the validity of the F.L.04

liquor license (for the sale of liquor not to be consumed in the premises) issued

to the 6th Respondent-Cargills Food Company Pvt Ltd in Weligama by the 1st

Respondent-the Commissioner General of Excise.

The main basis for challenge is that the issue of the liquor license is in violation

of rule 20(c) of the Excise Notification 902 marked as P3 viz., that the operative

sales outlet at No. 454, Matara Road, Weligama is within 100 meters to a place

of public religious place of worship in violation of the rule 20(c).

The Petitioner has filed a motion dated 05.02.2025 moving to amend the Petition

by adding a prayer and interim relief that,

“to issue by way of an interim relief, an Order suspending the validity/the

operation of the liquor license issued to the 6th respondent by the 1st to 3rd

4

respondents under the Excise Ordinance and the Regulations promulgated under

the same to the Liquor Sale Outlet at the premises No. 454, Matara Road,

Weligama of the 6th Respondent until the final determination of this

Application”

On behalf of the 6th Respondent, preliminary objections to the maintainability of

the application to amend pleadings were raised:

1. Application to amend the petition only contained in motion dated

05.02.2025 but no amended petition presented to Court.

2. No affidavit accompanying the application and that no material deposed

to the satisfaction of Court.

3. The petitioner is guilty of grave laches.

4. Application to amend pleadings is mala fide and dishonest.

BACKGROUND

The Petitioner has made an application to intervene in CA Writ 152/2020 which

was rejected. Then he has filed this application on the premise that 6th

Respondent’s liquor outlet was less than 100 meters from a place of religious

worship. At such time, the Petitioner was in possession of a Survey Plan No.

1144 dated 24th September 2022, which (the Petitioner contends) establishes the

‘distance rule’ violation.

5

In this application, no interim relief was sought to cancel or suspend the

liquor license. The matter was then fixed for argument on 22nd February 2024

at the behest of the Petitioner. The 6th Respondent in the meantime was directed

to file its objections on 24th October 2023.

The Petitioner thereafter by motion dated 23rd August 2023, sought to support

the interim relief which it had sought in its Petition.

The 6th Respondent thereafter filed its Statement of Objections on 22.01.2024

and raised multiple preliminary objections in respect of the maintainability of

the application.

Pursuant to the motion filed by the Petitioner, case was mentioned on 13th March

2024 on which date, the 4th Respondent informed that it would, on its own

motion conduct a survey to ascertain the distance between the relevant outlet

and the place of public religious place. This request was allowed on the basis

that the same would be conducted by the 4th Respondent on its own volition and

not pursuant to an order of Court, and the condition that such survey would be

conducted without prejudice to the legal positions of the parties.

After conducting the said survey, the report was submitted to the Court by the

4th Respondent on 8th January 2025.

The Petitioner, by motion dated 05th February 2025, sought to introduce new

reliefs by amending the Petition contending that the amendment was

required by reason of the findings of the survey. The 6th Respondent filed

6

objections on 20th August 2025, and oral submissions were made on 26th

September 2025.

IS THE PETITIONER GUILTY OF LACHES?

It was the Petitioner’s position from the beginning that the liquor outlet was

situated less than 100 meters from the place of religious worship. By paragraphs

5 and 6 of the original Petition dated 7th August 2023, it was specifically pleaded

that he caused Survey Plan No. 1144 dated 24.09.2022 (P2) to be drawn by

which the Petitioner claims he was able to determine that the liquor license had

been granted in violation of Rule 20 (c) of the Excise Notification No. 902.

In the previous Writ application No. CA/Writ/152/2020, by prayer ‘k’ the

Petitioner has sought the same relief which he is now seeking to introduce into

the Petition by way of an amendment. By the order dated 17th May 2023, the

Court has dismissed the application to intervene made by the Petitioner.

Subsequently, the Petitioner has instituted present application on the same

ground on 7th August 2023.

It is thus manifest that the same position was taken by the Petitioner as

early as September 2022 which is the date of Survey No. 1144. Therefore, it

is evident that the Petitioner had taken position that there was distance rule

violation by the 6th Respondent from 24th September 2022 but did not institute

present application until almost a year after becoming aware of it.

It was stressed by the learned President Counsel for the 6th Respondent that

despite having premised this petition on such alleged violation, the Petitioner

7

still opted to not seek interim relief which he is now attempting to introduce by

way of an amendment.

THE POSITION OF THE PETITIONER:

It was submitted that this application is not yet supported for leave and still at

its initial stage. No prejudice is caused to the 6th Respondent by this prayer. If

at all the 6th Respondent could only object to the Interim Relief been granted on

the same at the stage of supporting. Prejudice will be caused only if the Interim

Relief on the said prayer granted by this Court.

It was submitted that when this matter was fixed for inquiry, 6th Respondent

took a few dates to file written submissions. The dates given for filing written

submissions on 01.08.2025 (for the 6th Respondent) and 25.08.2025 (for the

Petitioner) and fixed for inquiry on 09.09.2025. However, by motion dated

01.08.2025, the 6th Respondent moved for further 3 weeks’ time till 21.08.2025

to file his written submissions.

It was further submitted that liquor licenses are issued for a period of one year

ending 31st of each year. The 6th Respondent by moving for extended periods for

his written submissions is attempting to keep on postponing or delaying the

Court from issuing notices on the Respondents and interim relief till the end of

the year.

CONCLUSION:

The main issue that arisen for determination in relation to this matter, viz.,

whether to amend the petition by including a prayer for interim relief, based on

the Survey Plan bearing No. MR/DSO/2024/175 dated 07.10.2024 which is

filed of record by the motion dated 08.01.2025 filed by 1st to 5th Respondents.

As per the said Plan and report ‘clarifying and ascertaining the actual distance’

from Dharmavijayarama Temple to the liquor sales outlet at No. 454, Matara

Road, Weligama, is only 79.08 meters.

Furthermore, it is revealed that the 6th Respondent has demarcated a separate

portion of premises No. 454, Matara Road, Weligama, supposed to be in, which

area the said liquor sales outlet/counter is located and got the distance surveyed

showing the distance as 101.68 meters.

At the preliminary stage, before supporting for leave as per proceedings dated

13.03.2024, the learned State Counsel has informed the Court that if a direction

is made by court to conduct a further survey to ascertain the distance between

two places, it could be complied with by the Surveyor General (SG). Then, the

learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner has informed that if the SG and

the Excise Commissioner are willing to do it from their own without any

direction, he has no objection but, if they want a direction from Court, may the

learned President’s Counsel to record his application. At that point, learned

President’s Counsel for the 6th Respondent had informed Court that they have

9

no objection regarding resurvey done by the Surveyor General but not as a

direction from this Court.

The President’s Counsel for the Petitioner has informed court as a settlement, if

the distance is more than 100 meters, he is willing to withdraw the petition.

Consequently, the court has recorded that, “Considering the circumstances of the

case, as the Petitioner is willing to withdraw the case if the distance is

more than 100 meters, Court is of the view that the Survey General can do the

resurvey on expenses incurred by the Petitioner and the report should be tendered

to this Court on the next date”.

Thus, it is clearly seen that to facilitate settlement only, the Court has allowed

the application of the Respondents. The 6th Respondent has objected to the

resurvey to be done as a direction of the Court.

It is pertinent to note that by paragraphs 5 and 6 of the original petition dated

7th August 2023, it is clearly averred that the Petitioner obtained the services of

a Licensed Surveyor and had a survey done to ascertain the distance and the

Survey Plan is annexed marked as P2; on the said Plan (P2), it is clear that the

distance is only 79.2 which is a blatant violation of regulation 20(c), under which

FL 4 Licenses are issued. It was specifically pleaded that he caused Survey Plan

No. 1144 dated 24.09.2022 (P2) to be drawn by which the Petitioner claims he

was able to determine that the liquor license had been granted in violation of

Rule 20 (c) of the Excise Notification No. 902.

10

Despite having premised this petition on such alleged violation, the

Petitioner has still opted to not seek interim relief on 7th August 2023. This

amounts to laches and it is the view of this Court that such amendment

should not be allowed at this stage. Furthermore, there is no irreparable

damage caused by not allowing the amendment leading to interim relief since

the final relief of quashing the FL 4 License is will not be nugatory by not allowing

the amendment. On the contrary, if this amendment is allowed it can lead to

granting of interim relief, which carries the effect of the final relief.

For the aforesaid reasons, the amendment to the petition is disallowed. No costs.
