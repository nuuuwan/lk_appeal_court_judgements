"","16. According  to  the  evidence  of  PW3,  Priyantha  Kumara  Jayakodi,  he  saw  only  the"

"","informed PW3 that the deceased had been shot by the appellant."
"","17. PW2, Roshan, was the other person who sustained gunshot injuries. According to his"
"","evidence,  he  saw  and  heard the  appellant  fire  a  shot  and  also observed  the  deceased"
"","fall.  The  appellant  then  shot  PW2,  who  was  subsequently  taken  to  the  hospital  in  a"
"","three-wheeler. It is established that the deceased died as a result of injuries caused by"
"","a  firearm,  and  the  evidence  of  the  JMO  in  this  regard  remains  uncontradicted.  It  is"
"","also established that PW2 sustained gunshot injuries. Accordingly, in my opinion, the"
"","failure to recover the firearm does not affect the strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case."
