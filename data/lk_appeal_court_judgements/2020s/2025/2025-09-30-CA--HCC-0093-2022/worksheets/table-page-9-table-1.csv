"CA/HCC/0093/2022"
"inconsistency  between  PW1  and  PW2,  particularly  given  the  considerable  time  gap"
"between the  incident and the trial. Furthermore,  it is  significant to note that whether"
"PW2  attended  the  funeral  with  PW1  and  the  deceased  or on  his  brother’s  bicycle  is"
"not a contradiction that goes to the root of the matter."
"34. What  the  Court  is  required  to  determine  is  whether  the  evidence  adduced  by  the"
"prosecution  witnesses,  particularly  regarding  the  identification  of  the  appellant  and"
"the  specific  act  committed  by  him, 
is  free  from  material  contradictions  and  can"
"therefore be relied upon safely to secure a conviction. If there exist contradictions or"
"inconsistencies among the testimonies concerning the  manner  in which the appellant"
"allegedly shot the deceased and PW2, or regarding the identification of the appellant,"
"such discrepancies would inevitably weaken the prosecution’s case."
"35. However, minor  inconsistencies are not necessarily  fatal to a witness’s credibility. It"
"is  common 
for  witnesses 
to  make  such  minor  errors  or 
forget  certain  details,"
"especially if the events occurred a long time ago."
"36. As noted earlier, the incident giving rise to this appeal occurred in January 2006. PW1"
"and  PW3  testified  in  October  2017,  while  PW2  testified  in  April  2018,  more  than"
"twelve years after the incident. It cannot reasonably be expected that they would recall"
"events with photographic accuracy. While lapses due to faulty memory may occur, so"
"long  as  there  is  no  indication  of  deliberate  falsehood  or  fabrication,  the  Court  may"
"safely  rely  on  their  evidence  to  secure  a  conviction.  In  doing  so,  the  Court  must"
"distinguish  between  genuine 
lapses 
in  memory  and  contradictions 
that  suggest"
"fabrication or distortion of the truth."
"37. In the present case, the contradictions highlighted by the defence are insignificant  in"
"nature and do not indicate any deliberate falsehood or fabrication."
"38. Upon a perusal of the impugned judgment, this Court observes that the learned High"
"Court Judge has carefully examined the contradictions, assessed them in their proper"
"perspective,  and  clearly  explained  why  they  were  not of  material  significance  to the"
"credibility of the prosecution evidence."
"39. The learned High Court Judge has also explained why the defence evidence could not"
"be relied upon. Therefore, the grounds advanced by the appellant are devoid of merit"
