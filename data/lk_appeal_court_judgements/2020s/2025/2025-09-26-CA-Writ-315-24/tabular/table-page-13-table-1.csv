"clearly, the law that would be applicable to the registration of the Petitionerâ€™s vehicle"
"should be the law applicable as at the time he tenders the application for registration"
"pursuant to sections 7 and 8 of the Motor Traffic Act."
"I
t was not disputed by the parties that upon an application being received pursuant to"
"section 9, the Commissioner General would assign a number and register the person as"
"the registered owner and specifically enter in the register any requirements of the Motor"
"Traffic Act or any other Act which is complied with, and, thereafter, issue the certificate"
"of registration in the prescribed form."
"T
he Petitioner also contended that since his importation of the vehicles were in the year"
"2019, the applicable Gazette stated by the 1st Respondent is published in 2022, the said"
"Gazette should not have a retrospective effect. It was his contention that the law should"
"be prospective and should not be retrospective. In this instance he submitted the cases"
"of Leechman and Company v. Rangalla Consolidated Limited 1981 2 SLR 373 and"
"Bandadranayake v Weeraratne (1978-79) 2 SLR 419. I have considered the said case"
"law and I find the facts and circumstances are different from the case before me. In this"
"instance as I have stated above the application of P14 pertaining to the vehicles does"
"not have a retrospective effect due to the fact that the applicable regime would be only"
"subsequent to an application for vehicle registration being tendered. In this instance, the"
"Petitioner has tendered for the first time to register his vehicle subsequent to P14 coming"
"into effect in 2023. Hence, the argument that P14 cannot have a retrospective effect, has"
"to fail."
"I
t  is  also  pertinent  to  note  in  this  instant  case  before  me,  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"tender  the  application  for  registration  of  the  vehicles  even  after  the  said  vehicle  had"
"been released from the Customs. As per his own admission, the Petitioner contends that"
"he needed to send the vehicles for repairs before it could be sent for registration. Hence,"
"there  is  a  further  lapse  of  time  from  the  time  the  vehicles  were  released  from  the"
"Customs and the Petitioner making the application to the 1st Respondent."
"T
he prayers in the Petition"
"L
et  me  now  consider  the  prayers  of  the  Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  by  prayer  (b)  is"
"seeking a Writ of Mandamus to direct the 1st Respondent to register the two vehicles in"
"question according to the provisions contained in a Gazette which is no longer in force"
"as the said Gazette had been amended by the Gazette marked as P14. In my view, the"
"said prayer has to fail as the Petitioner cannot derive any legal right from a provision"
"13"
