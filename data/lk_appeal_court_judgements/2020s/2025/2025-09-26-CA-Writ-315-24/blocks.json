In the said letter, the Petitioner has proposed and sought approval for the release of the vehicles upon tendering a bank guarantee pending the ruling by the Nomenclature and Classification Committee (herein referred to as \u201cNC Committee\u201d). The said letter contains several minutes of officers of the Respondents. In the first minute, the Director of Customs with a seal bearing Director of Customs notes that he has no objection for the release of the vehicles under suitable security.

This Court observes with dismay the time taken by the NC Committee to finally come to a conclusion regarding the HS Code of the vehicles. The NC committee had taken an abnormally long time. Finally, the NC Committee after a long delay had come to the conclusion that the HS Code in the Cusdecs was correct. However, the process had taken four years. During this time, the process of registration had been amended. However, the Court observed the Petitioner had not challenge the detention of the two vehicles nor the long period taken for them to come to the conclusion.
