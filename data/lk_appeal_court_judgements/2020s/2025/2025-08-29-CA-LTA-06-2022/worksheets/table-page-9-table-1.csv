"application for leave to appeal is filed against the said order, seeking appellate review of"
"the Tribunalâ€™s determination on jurisdiction."
"Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the basis, inter alia, of several substantial"
"questions of law arising from the impugned order of the Wakfs Tribunal. The Petitioner"
"contends  that:  (a)  the  Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to  appreciate  that  the  N.D.H.  Abdul"
"Gaffoor Trust does not qualify as a Muslim Charitable Trust within the meaning of the"
"relevant  statute;  (b)  the  Tribunal  failed  to  recognize  that  the  Trust  is  not,  in  fact,  a"
"charitable  trust  at  all;  (c)  the  proceedings  before  the  Tribunal  were  tainted  by  bias,"
"rendering its order illegal; (d) the Tribunal improperly engaged in a speculative inquiry,"
"amounting  to  a  voyage  of  discovery  beyond  the  scope  of  its  mandate;  (e)  the  Tribunal"
"erroneously applied the doctrine of estoppel in circumstances where it was inapplicable;"
"(f) the Tribunal incorrectly held that its jurisdiction over the matter was a settled issue;"
"and (g) the Tribunal misrepresented material facts in its order, thereby undermining the"
"integrity of its findings."
