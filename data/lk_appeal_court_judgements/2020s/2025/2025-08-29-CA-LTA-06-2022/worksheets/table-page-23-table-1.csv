"1.  Public  waqfs-  designated  masalih-al-‘ aamma-  for  example,  the  building  of  a"
"mosque or school;"
"2.  Quasi public waqfs- a trust  created primarily for a pious purpose and partly for"
"the benefit of a particular persons or embers of the family of the settlor,"
"3.  Private waqfs-primary object of which is to benefit individuals, including members"
"of the settlor’s family.”"
"Although the Muslim Law provides for family trust according to Muslim Law in Sri Lanka"
"by  Dr. H.W. Tambiah Q.C. Ph.D. and Mohammado Markhani AAL  at page 76 it states"
"thus,"
"“The  Muslim  Law  governing  private  trusts  is  no  part  of  our  law.  Muslim  law"
"provides for family trusts by a written instrument creating a trust, in the English"
"sense,  in  which  event  the  Trusts  Ordinance  (Cap.  87)  will  apply,  and  if  this"
"Ordinance is silent, then resort is had to English law.”"
"In my respectful view, the Settlor’s principal objective in executing the Deed appears to"
"have  been  the  preservation  of  the  estate  within  the  family,  ensuring  that  its  benefits"
"remained  under  familial  control.  The  reference  to  Arabic  education  and  the  support  of"
"Muslim  boys  at  the  Arabic  Language  School—an  institution  that  existed  prior  to  the"
"Deed—seems to have been a secondary consideration. Moreover, the Settlor’s decision to"
"apply English law appears to have been driven by this underlying intent, rather than by"
"any genuine aim to create a charitable trust in the strict legal sense."
"T
he Settlor clearly stipulated that the Deed would be governed by English law, thereby"
"intentionally  refraining  from  invoking  Muslim  law.  This  deliberate  choice  reflects  his"
"intention  to  establish an express  private  trust—an  arrangement  that  is  not  recognized"
"under traditional Muslim legal principles."
"A
ccordingly,  Case  No.  WT  268/2019,  presently  pending  before  the  Wakfs  Tribunal,  is"
"hereby dismissed on the ground that the Trust Deed in question is governed by English"
