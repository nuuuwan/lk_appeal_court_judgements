"Tribunal."
"At the hearing before the tribunal, Learned Counsel for the Petitioners raised preliminary"
"objections regarding the maintainability of the action. It was contended that the trust in"
"question does not qualify as a Charitable Muslim Trust within the meaning of the relevant"
"statute. Consequently, Counsel argued that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear and"
"determine the dispute brought forward by the Respondent, as the said Trust does not fall"
"within the scope of the provisions of the governing Act."
