"HCC/0077/2023"
"Judgment"
"1.  The  accused-appellant  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  appellant)  has  filed  the  instant"
"appeal  against  the  judgment  dated  09.10.2020  delivered  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge of Vavuniya. Although several  grounds of appeal were initially urged, learned"
"Counsel  for  the  appellant,  at  the  hearing,  confined  her  submissions  solely  to  the"
"question of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge."
"2.  The relief is sought in terms of section 333 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No"
"15 of 1979 as amended by the Act No 25 of 2024. The appellant further prays that this"
"Court be pleased to order that the prison sentence take effect from the date of conviction"
"3.  By the said amendment, a proviso to section 333(5) was added, which reads:"
"Provided that, the Court of Appeal may, in appropriate cases, order that the time spent"
"by an appellant in custody pending the determination of his appeal and any time spent"
"in custody prior to the conviction, such time not having been considered as part of his"
"sentence passed at the time of his conviction by the court of first instance, be considered"
"as part of his sentence ordered at the conclusion of his appeal."
"4.  This Act empowers the Court of Appeal to treat the period an accused person has spent"
"in  custody  before  their  conviction  as  part  of  the  sentence  ultimately  imposed.  In"
"practice, this means that if a person has been held on remand for a significant length of"
"time while awaiting trial or judgment, that period will be credited towards their final"
"sentence."
"5.  The principle underlying this provision is that pre-conviction detention is not a neutral"
"period of time; it is, in effect, a curtailment of liberty that carries the same hardships"
"and  stigma  as  imprisonment  after  conviction.  To  ignore  such  a  period  would  be  to"
"disregard a real and tangible deprivation experienced by the accused."
"6.  The amendment to the Act seeks to ensure that no individual is punished twice over:"
"first  through  lengthy  detention  while  awaiting  trial,  and  then  again  through  the  full"
"imposition of a custodial sentence without credit for that prior confinement. In many"
