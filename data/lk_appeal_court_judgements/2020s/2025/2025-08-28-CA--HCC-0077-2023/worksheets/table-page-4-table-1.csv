"12. The sentence imposed on the appellant is 12 years. Having considered the period he"
"had already spent in remand, I consider it is appropriate to deduct that period from the"
"sentence as it meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, it appears that the appellant has no"
"previous  convictions.  Hence,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  it  does  not  cause  any"
"injustice  to  anyone  if  the  sentence  is  ordered  to  take  effect  from  the  date  of  the"
"conviction."
