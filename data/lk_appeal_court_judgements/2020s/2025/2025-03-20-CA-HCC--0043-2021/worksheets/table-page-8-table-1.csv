"The learned Counsel contended that the learned High Court Judge had failed"
"to take into consideration the material contradictions in the evidence of PW3"
"who was called to give evidence in order to corroborate the evidence of the"

"he had failed to tell the Police about the incident as witnessed by him. Hence,"

"contradiction certainly attacks the root of the matter and provides a strong"
"challenge to the prosecution version."
