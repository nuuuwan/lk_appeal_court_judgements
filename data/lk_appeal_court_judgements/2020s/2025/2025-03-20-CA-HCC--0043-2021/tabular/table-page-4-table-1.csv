"Appellant  at  that  time.  Thereafter,  PW1  had  first  told  the  incident  to  her"
"grandmother  Seelawathi.  A  maid  namely  Ranjani  was  employed  at  the"
"victim’s  house.  Even  though  Ranjani  was  the  first  person  to  lodge  the"
"complaint with the police, she was not called to give evidence at the trial."
"According to PW3, the brother of the victim, he himself had witnessed the"
"Appellant lying on top of her sister’s body and committing intercrural sex."
"Further,  when  he  shouted,  the  victim  had  run  up  to  PW2  Ranjani  and"
"recounted the incident to her."
"The  JMO  had  examined  the  victim  on  11/05/2013  at  the  Base  Hospital,"
"Mawanella. In the history, the victim had stated that a known person had"
"attempted to touch her inappropriately and had removed her clothes while"
"she was home. The victim had not revealed any vaginal, or oral penetration."
"The Medico legal Report, except the history, was admitted under Section 420"
"of the Code of Criminal Procedure act No.15 of 1979 by the defence."
"As  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Appellant  are  interconnected,  all"
"grounds will be considered together in this appeal."
"In the indictment filed by the prosecution, it had only referred to the act of"
"intercrural  sex  committed  on  the  victim  by  the  Appellant.  But  when  the"
"victim was giving evidence before the High Court, she restricted her evidence"
"to the act of the Appellant rubbing his penis on her vagina. Further, in the"
"history to the doctor the victim had not revealed any sexual act committed"
"by the Appellant."
"In  a  case  of  this  nature,  the  testimonial  trustworthiness  and  credibility  of"
"PW1,  mainly  the  probability  should  be  assessed  with  utmost  care  and"
"caution by the Trial Judge. The learned Trial Judge has to satisfy and accept"
"the  evidence  of  a  child  witness  after  assessing  his/her  competence  and"
"credibility as a witness."
