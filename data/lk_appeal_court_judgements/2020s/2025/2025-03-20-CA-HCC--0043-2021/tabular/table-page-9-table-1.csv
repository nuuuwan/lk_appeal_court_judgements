"CA/HCC/0043/21"
"In this case PW1, and PW3 are the key witnesses. Their evidence is not clear"
"and  not  matched  on  material  points  discussed  above.  Their  evidence  is"
"tainted  with  much  ambiguity  and  uncertainty  which  definitely  affects  the"
"root  of  the  case.  This  has  aggravated  more  due  to  not  calling  an  essential"
"witness PW2."
"Taking into consideration, all these circumstances, I am of the view that the"
"conviction  of  the  Appellant  cannot  be  allowed  to  stand  as  the  prosecution"
"had failed its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. I set aside"
"the  conviction  and  sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of"
"Kegalle dated 05/04/2021 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted from"
"this case."
"Therefore, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Kegalle along with the original case record."
