"misleading and fraudulent conduct of the Respondents."
"e)  The Learned Trial Judge has totally failed and ignored to consider the"
"vital legal matters raised by the Petitioner to the extent of denying audi"

"f)  The  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  failed  to  properly  evaluate  the  material"
"facts and evidence placed before him and thereby denied the legitimate"
"expectation  and  economic  rights  of  the  Petitioner  whilst  allowing  the"

"conduct."
"T
he petitioner took up the position that the Learned Trial Judge entered the"
"order without duly analysing and considering the legal provisions relating to"
"the  Act  No.1  of  2023.  However, 
the  petitioner  has 
failed  to  specify  or"
"elaborate  on  the  provisions  of  Act  No.  1  of  2023,  which  were  allegedly"
"violated by the order of the District Judge.  The grounds relied upon by the"

"I
n  the  case  of  Wimalawathi  and  others  vs  Thotamuna  and  others  (1998)  3"
"SLR 01, Ranaraja J held as follows;"
"Where  a  defendant  seeks  to  have  an  ex-parte  decree  entered  against"
"him  set  aside,  the  burden  of  proof  that  no  summons  was  served,  lies"
