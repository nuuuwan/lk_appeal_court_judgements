"Judgment Delivered"
"27-08-2025"
"on:"
"D.Thotawatte, J."
"This  appeal  arises  from  the  order  of  the  High  Court  of  the  Province  of  Uva  holden  at"
"Monaragala  dated  6th  August  2021,  whereby  the  Appellant’s  application  under  Section"
"24  of  the  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disabilities  Act  No.  28  of  1996,  as"
"amended by Act No. 33 of 2003."
"The  Petitioner-Appellant  Wellakke  Liyanage  Rasika  Niroshana  Liyanage 
(Hereinafter"
"referred to as “Appellant”) claims he had suffered from a disability since about 1993 due"
"to an accident; however, he also claims he had done his BA and MA between 2003 and"
"2011 and had been employed at the Social Services Department from 2006 to 2020."
"In  2004/2005,  under  Minute  on 
the  Sri  Lanka  Administrative  Service  published 
in"
"Extraordinary Gazette No. 1419/3 dated 14th November 2005, the Appellant had sat for a"
"competitive 
examination 
in  order 
to  obtain 
an 
appointment 
to 
the 
Sri 
Lanka"
"Administrative Service and had obtained 135 marks."
"Although  the  Appellant  has  annexed  the  result  sheet  to  the  petition  submitted  to  the"
"High  Court  (averment  10  of  the  petition)  in  order  to  establish  that  he  had  passed  the"
"examination, that fact is not borne out by the result sheet. However, nothing regarding"
"this  matter  has  been  mentioned  in  the  petition  of  appeal  filed  in  this  Court,  and  the"
"Counsel appearing for the Appellant in his oral submissions informed the court that the"
"135  marks 
received  by 
the  Appellant  are  below 
the  cut-off  marks 
for 
the 
said"
"examination. It appears that the Petitioner had attempted to mislead the High Court."
"The  instant  appeal  is  completely  based  on  a  public  Administration  circular  issued  to  all"
"Secretaries  of  Ministries,  Heads  of  Departments  and  Chairmen  of  Corporations  in  1988"
"bearing  No.  27/88  ordering  that 
in  recruiting  persons  to  government  service  or  to"
