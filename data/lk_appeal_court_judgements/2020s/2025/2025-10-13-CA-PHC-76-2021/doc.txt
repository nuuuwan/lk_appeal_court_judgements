JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) is

the registered owner of the vehicle bearing registration number 226-

1186. He has employed a driver and hired the vehicle for transporting

building material, paddy and other goods.

2. On May 10, 2019, the driver has requested permission to use the

vehicle to transport some building material to the site where the

driver’s house was under construction. The petitioner has granted his

permission for the intended purpose.

3. However, the driver has not returned by 4.00 p.m. on that day.

Concerned about his employee’s prolonged absence, the petitioner has

begun making inquiries with the driver’s household. During these

inquiries, the petitioner has learned that the Medirigiriya Police has

arrested the driver for allegedly transporting timber without a valid

permit.

4. In terms of section 26, read with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance

No.16 of 1907 (as amended), the Medirigiriya Police has also seized the

said vehicle bearing registration number 226-1186 which had been

used to transport the timber.

5. Thereafter, the officer in charge of the Medirigiriya Police has filed

action in the Hingurakgoda Magistrate Court against the driver for

transporting timber without a valid permit, an offence punishable in

terms of section 26 read with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

6. The driver (the accused) upon pleading guilty to the charge has been

convicted of the same and sentenced.

7. Subsequently, a confiscation inquiry has been held regarding the

vehicle bearing registration number 226-1186. At the conclusion of

the inquiry, by Order dated June 30, 2020, the learned Magistrate

had ordered the confiscation of the said vehicle.

8. Aggrieved by the Order, the appellant had filed an application in

revision [ප්‍රති/67/2020] in the High Court of Polonnaruwa.

9. The learned High Court Judge by his Order dated November 17, 2021,

had dismissed the revision application and affirmed the Order of the

learned Magistrate dated June 30, 2020.

10. The appellant also being aggrieved by the Order of the leaned High

Court Judge of Polonnaruwa dated November 17, 2021, has preferred

the instant appeal to this court.

11. The facts of this appeal are not disputed. It is common ground that

the officer-in-charge of the Medirigirya Police Station had instituted

proceedings against the driver i.e. Janaka Bandara for transporting

Teak and Burutha timber valued at Rs. 100,880.92 on May 10, 2019,

without a permit and thereby committing an offence punishable under

section 26 read with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No.16 of 1907

(as amended).

12. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 (as amended)

provides;

“(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence –

(a) All timber of forest produce which is not the property of

the State in respect of which such offence has been

committed; and

Page 5 of 10

(b) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines

used in committing such offence,

Shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools,

vehicles, implements, and machines used in the

commission of such offence, is a third party, no Order of

Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions

to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the

commission of the offence.

(2) Any property forfeited to the State under subsection (1) shall-

(a) if no appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal

against the relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the

State with effect from the date on which the period

prescribed for preferring an appeal against such

conviction expires;

(b) if an appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal

against the relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the

State with effect from the date on which such conviction

is affirmed on appeal.

In this subsection, “relevant conviction” means the conviction in

consequence of which any property is forfeited to the State

under subsection (1)”.

Page 6 of 10

13. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance states that upon a conviction, all

timber and forest produce that have been a subject matter of the

offence and vehicles used for the commission of such offence would

confiscated. If the owner of a vehicle himself was the accused in the

preceding case then the issue before a court in a confiscation inquiry

will not be complicated. However, if the owner is a third party, it

would be necessary for a court to ascertain whether the offence has

been committed by a particular accused with the connivance of the

owner of such vehicle used for the commission of the forest offence.

14. The proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance states that if a

vehicle seized for being used in the commission of a forest offence, and

the vehicle’s owner is a third party, who is not an accused individual

charged with that offence, no Order of confiscation shall be made if

the third party owner can demonstrate to a court that he took all

precautions to prevent the vehicle from being used in the commission

of the forest offence.

15. The owner of the vehicle will have to establish such fact on a balance

of probability. In Adambarage Kelum Thushantha Alwis vs. The

Attorney General [CA (PHC) 211/2019] decided on 07.02.2023,

Iddawela J. has stated,

“However, it is more appropriate to note that corroboration of

evidence is not imperative where there is irrefutable evidence at

face value provided by the appellant to satisfy the court on a

balance of probability that necessary precautionary measures

have been taken as a reasonable owner of the vehicle to prevent

the commission of offences by using the vehicle.”

16. When considering the precautions that an owner must take, it is

important to recognize that these measures can be highly subjective

and may not apply universally to all situations. Each context will be

Page 7 of 10

unique, influenced by factors such as the nature of the vehicle, the

specific risks involved, and the owner’s personal circumstances.

17. Nevertheless, any precautions taken should be thorough rather than

superficial. A superficial approach might involve merely checking off

boxes or implementing changes that appear to address the problem

without truly engaging with it.

18. In contrast, thorough precautions involve a thoughtful, comprehensive

evaluation of potential misuse. Such evaluation should not only

identify vulnerabilities but also explore various deterrent options and

implementing a layered deterrent strategy.

19. The learned Counsel for the appellant contends that the learned

Magistrate has failed to evaluate the testimony of the appellant

presented during the confiscation inquiry in a judicially sound

manner.

20. It is asserted that both the learned Magistrate and the learned High

Court Judge have approached the issue with a preconceived notion

that the appellant should have been aware that the vehicle seized

would be used for illegal purposes by the accused named in the

charge sheet.

21. In light of these circumstances, it is argued that the learned

Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge have misdirected

themselves in law regarding the imperative stipulations outlined in the

proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance.

22. The appellant as the sole witness called to give evidence on behalf of

the owner has declared that he was the registered owner of the vehicle

in question. That he had provided instructions to the driver regarding

the use of the vehicle to ensure it is not involved in any unlawful

Page 8 of 10

activities. Specifically, that he has instructed the driver to refrain from

using the vehicle to commit any offences.

23. Upon reviewing the testimony provided by the appellant, it is evident

that his involvement in the attempt in taking all precautions to

prevent the use of the relevant vehicle in the commission of an offence

has been largely superficial.

Page 9 of 10

24. He has simply instructed/warned the accused individual named in

the charge sheet to refrain from using the vehicle for unlawful

activities. This approach lacks depth and fails to adequately address

the broader context in which the vehicle was employed.

25. A genuine preventive strategy would have required a comprehensive

assessment of the environment surrounding the vehicle’s use. The

appellant’s testimony does not reflect any consideration of the various

measures that could have been implemented to deter the vehicle’s use

in committing the offence.

26. In order to effectively mitigate the risk of the vehicle being misused, a

thorough evaluation of the potential threats and vulnerabilities

associated with its operation would have been essential. This would

have included regular monitoring or clear guidelines for the

authorized use of the vehicle.

27. By neglecting to address these critical elements, the appellant’s

strategy appears insufficient and ultimately ineffective in preventing

the commission of the offence involving the vehicle. Effective crime

prevention necessitates a proactive, well informed approach rather

than superficial directives.

28. In the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva [CA (PHC) 86/97]

Sisira De Abrew, J. has stated that,

"For these reasons I hold that giving mere instructions is not

sufficient to discharge the said burden. She must establish

that genuine instructions were in fact given and that she took

every endeavor to implement the instructions... "

Page 10 of 10

29. As a consequence, the learned High Court Judge has not misdirected

himself and affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate dated June

30, 2020.

30. In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the

disputed Orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court

Judge dated June 30, 2020, and November 17, 2021, respectively and

dismiss the instant appeal.

I make no order regarding costs

31. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment

to the Magistrate Court of Hingurakgoda for compliance.

Appeal dismissed.
