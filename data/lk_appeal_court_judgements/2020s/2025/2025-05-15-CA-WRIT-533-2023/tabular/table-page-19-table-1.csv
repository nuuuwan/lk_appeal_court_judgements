"are statutory provisions for the recovery of same. As already discussed, I have expressed the"
"view  that  the  Commissioner’s  finding  that  the  Petitioners  were  required  to  “earn  wages”"
"during 
their  period  of  compulsory 
leave 
is  contrary 
to 
law  and  based  on 
irrelevant"
"considerations."
"In  light  of  this  position,  the  next  issue  to  consider  is  whether  there  is  a  live  dispute  that"
"warrants  a  reference  to  arbitration.  It  is  the  Petitioners’  contention  that  the  contract  of"
"employment, salary particulars, imposition of compulsory no-pay leave by the 4th Respondent,"
"the period of compulsory no-pay leave, cessation or termination of employment and the non-"
"payment  of  salaries  and  statutory  duties  since  April  2020,  which  are  the  material  facts  to"
"determine the Petitioners’ entitlement and liability of the 4th Respondent under the Wages"
"Boards  Ordinance,  have  all  been  admitted  by  the  4th  Respondent  and  are  not  in  dispute."
"Hence,  they  argue  that  such  material  was  available  at  the 
inquiry  held  by  the  Labour"
"Department, and, as such, there is no necessity for an arbitrator to inquire afresh into such"
"matters. According to the Petitioners, such an inquiry is also likely to cause further delay and"
"prejudice.  In  the  absence  of  a  plausible  response  on  the  part  of  the  Respondents  on  such"
"issue, I am inclined to agree with the position taken up by the Petitioners."
"Furthermore, I am of the view that in the availability of procedures addressing defaults by"
"employers  in  the  Wages  Boards  Ordinance,  which  can  be  considered  as  the  lex  specialis"
"relating to the regulation of wages and other emoluments of persons employed in trades, it"
"would neither be rational or reasonable to have recourse to the provisions of the Industrial"
"Disputes Act, which is relatively a more lex generalis dealing with “industrial disputes.” It is re-"
"iterated  that  the  Commissioner  has  also  not  adduced  any  compelling  reasons  for  such  a"
"choice.  Since  the  Petitioners  have  specifically  objected  to  reference  to  arbitration  in  the"
"instant application, it would have been incumbent upon the 1st Respondent to offer a specific"
"explanation  on  the  issue,  and  I  was  unable  to  find  the  same  either  in  the  statement  of"
"objections  or 
in  the  submissions  made  at  the  hearing.  Hence,  the  decision  of  the  1st"
"Respondent also appears to be at variance with the well-established legal maxim relating to"
"statutory interpretation generalia specialibus non derogant to the effect that “things general"
"do not restrict or detract from things special.”15 Such reasoning seems to be fortified by the"
"provisions of section 65 of the Wages Boards Ordinance itself which provide as follows;"
