"The Petitioners have also referred to Jayamaha v. Provincial Public Service Commission and"
"others,22 wherein the necessity to exhaust alternative remedies was considered by this Court"
"(per Janak de Silva J.) in the following terms;"
"“The question then is whether a Court can refuse to exercise powers of judicial review"
"in these circumstances. The general principle is that an individual should normally use"
"alternative  remedies  where  available  rather  than 
judicial  review 
[R. 
(Davies)  v."
"Financial Services Authority (2004) 1 W.L.R. 185; R. (G) Immigration Appeal Tribunal"
"(2005)  1  W.L.R.  1445].  Our  Courts  have  held  that  where  a  party  fails  to 
invoke"
"alternative remedies judicial review can be refused. [Rodrigo v. Municipal Council Galle"
"(49 N.L.R. 89); Gunasekera v. Weerakoon (73 N.L.R. 262); Obeysekera v. Albert & others"
"(1978-79)  2  Sri  L.R.  220);  Rev.  Maussagolle  Dharmarakkitha  Thera  and  another  v."
"Registrar of Lands and others (2005) 3 Sri L.R. 113]. The general principle is applicable"
"even where the alternative remedy is an administrative procedure, such as in this case"
"and  Courts  will  require  the  party  seeking 
judicial  review  first  to  exhaust  such"
"administrative procedure before invoking the discretionary power of judicial review [R"
"(Cowl) v. Plymouth City Council (2002) 1 W.L.R. 803; R. v. Barking and Dagenham LBC"
"Ex. P. Lloyd (2001) L.G.R. 421; R. (Carnell) v. Regents Park College and Conference of"
"Colleges Appeal Tribunal (2008) E.L.R. 739]."
"However, as it is a general principle, Courts have recognized several qualifications in its"
"application. There may be situations where the alternative remedy is not adequate and"
"efficacious in which event judicial review is available [E.S. Fernando v. United Workers"
"Union and another (1989) 2 Sri L.R. 199]. It maybe that judicial review is capable of"
"providing immediate means of resolving the dispute in which case it may be the more"
"appropriate procedure. There may also be a need to obtain interim relief which may"
"not be possible under the alternative procedure. This is not an exhaustive list and there"
"are  certainly  other  instances  where  judicial  review  may  be  granted  even  though  an"
"alternative administrative procedure exists.”"
