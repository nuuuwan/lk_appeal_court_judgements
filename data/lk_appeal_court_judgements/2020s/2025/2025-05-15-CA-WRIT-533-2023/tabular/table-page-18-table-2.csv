"(e) in any such suit instituted in the name of a trade union, such union may be"
"represented by any of its officers."
"Thus,  it  is  observed  that,  excluding  Part  II,  the  Wages  Boards  Ordinance  provides  for  the"
"recovery of payments due to workmen by the Commissioner by two principal means; either"
"by instituting proceedings in the appropriate Magistrates’ Court by recovering the sum due as"
"a fine (section 3D) or by instituting a civil suit for the recovery of the sum due in a court of"
"competent  jurisdiction  (section  56).  It  is  further  observed  that  the  Ordinance  vests  the"
"Commissioner with the discretion regarding the choice of procedure to be adopted, and, if"
"the Commissioner to institute proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court, section 3D(2) requires"
"the Commissioner to form an opinion that that recovery under any other provisions under the"
"Ordinance is “impractical or inexpedient.” I am of the view that the aforementioned statutory"
"provisions cast a statutory duty upon the Commissioner to recover payments due to workmen"
"under  the  Ordinance  from  defaulting  employers.  However,  it  is  also  evident  that  the  1st"
"Respondent does not appear to have considered such provisions in recovering the payments"
"due to the Petitioners in the instant case."
