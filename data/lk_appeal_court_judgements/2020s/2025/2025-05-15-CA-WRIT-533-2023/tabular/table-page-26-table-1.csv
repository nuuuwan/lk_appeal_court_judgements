"of the Commissioner General of Labour, who is the 1st Respondent. The officers referred to"
"above  are  subordinate  officers  of  the  1st  Respondent  in  the  Labour  Department  and  the"
"proceedings  of  the  inquiry  marked  P38(b),  which  document  the  actions  taken  by  the  said"
"officers,  have  been  annexed to  the  petition.  Hence,  I  no prejudice  has been  caused to  the"
"Respondents  by  the  failure  to  cite  the  said  officers  as parties,  and  I  overrule  the objection"
"raised by the 4th Respondent."
"3.  Contractual Dispute"
"In its statement of objections, the 4th Respondent states that the instant dispute deals purely"
"with rights and obligations arising from a private employment contract. Whilst the Petitioners"
"were employed by the 4th Respondent under a contract of employment, the orders and action"
"impugned in the instant application are those of the Commissioner in the exercise of statutory"
"functions.  Furthermore, 
the 
reliefs 
sought  by 
the  Petitioners  arise  out  of 
statutory"
"entitlements under the Wages Boards Ordinance, the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and"
"the  Employees’  Trust  Fund  (ETF).  In  fact,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  employment  in  the"
"employment contract marked ‘P3’ itself make specific reference to EPF, ETF and the Payment"
"of Gratuity Acts."
"I  have  also  carefully  considered  the  authorities  cited  by  the  4th  Respondent  in  its  written"
"submissions, namely, Ratnayake v. C. D. Perera,26 Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited v. Board"
"of Investment of Sri Lanka,27 Jayawardena v. People’s Bank,28 Meragala v. People’s Bank and"
"others,29 M. S. S. Salahudeen v. Sri Lankan Airlines Limited,30 Perera v. Municipal Council of"
"Colombo and others31 and Mendis v. Seema Sahitha Panadura Janatha Santhaka Pravahana"
"Sevaya.32 It is observed that all such cases related to a contractual relationship between the"
"Petitioner  and  the  public  authority  (except 
in  Ratnayake’s  case  where  the  contractual"
"relationship was between a member and elected committee of a trade union) and the decision"
"impugned was a decision made by the public authority  or state enterprise as a contractual"
"partner. I am compelled to observe that the factual matrix in the instant case is substantially"
"different  to  such  cases 
in  several  aspects:  firstly,  the 
impugned  decision 
is  not  of  the"
"contractual  partner  (the  4th  Respondent)  but  of  the  Commissioner,  who  is  a  third  party;"
"secondly,  the 
impugned  decision  relates  to  the  exercise  of  a  statutory  function  by  the"
"Commissioner; 
thirdly, 
the 
reliefs 
sought 
in 
the 
instant  application  are 
secured  and"
"enforceable  by  statute.  Hence, 
in  my  view  such  decisions  do  not  constitute  binding  or"
"persuasive authority to the facts and circumstances arising in the instant case. Accordingly, I"
"overrule the preliminary objection raised by the 4th Respondent on this matter."
