"and equally efficacious. However, as I have discussed above, the offer of the Commissioner to"
"refer the dispute between the Petitioners and the 4th Respondent for arbitration and the other"
"alternative  remedies  cited  by  the  4th  Respondent  do  not  offer  an  adequate  or  equally"
"efficacious  remedy  to  the  Petitioners,  in  comparison  to  the  reliefs  sought  in  the  instant"
"application, considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case. Hence, I overrule the"
"legal objection raised by the Respondents relating to the exhaustion of alternative remedies."
"In  their  written  submissions,  the  Petitioners  have  further  alleged  that  the  reference  to"
"arbitration is an attempt by the Commissioner to further prejudice the Petitioner and drag"
"and delay justice by several more years, especially in view of the fact that the 4th Respondent"
"is also a State Enterprise (vide paragraph 116). Whilst further delay and potential prejudice by"
"submission  to  arbitration  is  foreseeable,  such  a  fact  would  not  necessarily  imply  that  the"
"action of the Commissioner was intended to benefit the 4th Respondent which was a State"
"Enterprise. As the party making such an assertion, the onus of establishing the same would"
"lie with the Petitioners. Apart from mere conjecture, the Petitioners have not been able to"
"provide any affirmative evidence that the 1st and 3rd Respondents were acting in collusion with"
"the 4th Respondent or under dictation by any State agency or any other evidence."
