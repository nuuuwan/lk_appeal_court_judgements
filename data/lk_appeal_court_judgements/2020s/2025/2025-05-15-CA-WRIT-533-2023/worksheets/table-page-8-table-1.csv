"Education and others.4 However, the dicta cited by the 4th Respondent from these cases itself"
"unequivocally indicate that decisions made by a public authority in excess of its powers are"
"amenable  to  review.  In  the  instant  application,  the  basis  upon  which  the  Petitioners  have"
"challenged the decision of the Commission marked  ‘P35’ and ‘P37’ is that the decision has"
"been ultra vires. Hence, I am satisfied that this Court possesses jurisdiction to inquire into the"
"instant application."
