"As mentioned previously wages are a natural right of the worker that flows from the"
"contract of employment. The employer may in certain circumstances (as adverted to"
"previously) decide not to provide work to the worker and prohibit him from attending"
"to work. Yet the employer’s duty to pay wages remains. In this instance the employee"
"was merely receiving his contractual dues. The fact that he had received other wages"
"during his suspension from a 3rd party is beside the point (emphasis added).”"
