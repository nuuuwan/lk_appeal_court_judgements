"has  been  considered  and  departed  from  in  several  subsequent  decisions  by  the  Supreme"
"Court including in E. S. Fernando v. United Workers Union and another,18 where the Court"
"held as follows (per G. P. S. de Silva J. (as he then was));"
"“It would therefore appear that, assuming that the repudiation of an award in terms"
"of  section  20  is  a  “remedy"",  yet  it  is  not  an  adequate  and  an  effectual  remedy.  To"
"disentitle the petitioner-appellant to the remedy by way of certiorari, the “alternative"
"remedy"" must be an adequate and an effectual remedy. In Obeysekera vs. Albert and"
"others  (supra)  the  Court  of  Appeal  does  not  seem  to  have  sufficiently  addressed  its"
"mind to the question of the adequacy and efficacy of the “remedy"" provided in section"
"20 of the Industrial Disputes Act. In this view of the matter, as at present advised, I am"
"of the view that the case of Obeysekera vs. Albert and others (supra) has been wrongly"
"decided.”"
