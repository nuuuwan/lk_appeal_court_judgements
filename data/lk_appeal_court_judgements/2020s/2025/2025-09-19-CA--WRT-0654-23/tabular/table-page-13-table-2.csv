"to Section 19(2) of the IDA, and it was opined thus:"
"“It is obvious that when an award is made, the terms of the award"
"becomes implied terms attached to the contract of employment. So,"
"there should be an existing contract of employment for the"

"end of the arbitration. This section presupposes the existence of"
"a valid contract between the employee and the employer.”"
