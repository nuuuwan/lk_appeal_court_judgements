"14,  is  cited  in  Wade  &  Forsyth  on  Administrative  Law  (9th  Edition,  at"
"page 215) as follows:"
"“On a challenge to the commission’s jurisdiction to undertake the"
"investigation the House of Lords held that the ‘clear cut approach"
"[as described in the preceding pages] cannot be applied to every"
"case, for the criterion so established may itself be so imprecise that"
"different  decision-makers,  each  acting  rationally,  might  reach"
"differing conclusions when applying it to the facts of a given case."
"In  such  a  case  the  court  is  entitled  to  substitute  its  own"
"opinion for that of the person to whom the decision has been"
"entrusted only if the decision is so aberrant that it cannot"
"be classed as rational.” [emphasis added.]"
