"20. Applying  the  aforesaid  tests,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  arbitrator  has"
"acted without jurisdiction, that there is a patent lack of jurisdiction, and"
"that  the  award  so  made  is  a  nullity.  Objections  of  this  nature  can  be"
"taken  up  at  any  time,  and  when  so  declared,  the  process  and  the"
"decision will be a nullity. To that extent, I hold that the impugned award"
"is a nullity, and the petitioner is entitled to a writ of certiorari as prayed."
