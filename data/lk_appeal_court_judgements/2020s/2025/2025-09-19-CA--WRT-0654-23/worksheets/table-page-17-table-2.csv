"material  by  way  of  affidavit  may  be  sufficient.  In  Hilaire  Barnett’s"
"Constitutional & Administrative Law (9th Ed., at page 615) it is opined"
"as follows:"
"“Where  there  exists  no  right  to  an  oral  hearing,  the  question"
"becomes one of the extent to which  – and means by which – the"
"view of the individual can be put to the decision making authority."
"It  may  well  be  the  case  that  the  opportunity  to  make  written"
"submissions will satisfy the requirements for justice and fairness."
"For  example, 
in  Lloyd  v.  McMahon 
(1987), 
local  government"
"councillors were in breach of their statutory duty to set the level of"
"local rates. When the district auditor came to determine the issue,"
"the  applicants  claimed  the  right  to  an  oral  hearing,  and  that  the"
"absence  of  such  a  hearing  amounted  to  a  breach  of  the  rules  of"
"natural 
justice  and  was,  accordingly,  ultra  vires.  The  court"
"disagreed, holding that, since the auditor had given notice of the"
"case 
against 
them 
and 
had 
considered 
written"
"representations 
from 
them,  he  had  acted 
fairly  and,"
"accordingly, lawfully.” [emphasis added.]"
