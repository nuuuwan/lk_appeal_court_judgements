"As I see, on a consideration of a totality of these provisions, there is a"
"clear scheme laid down by the IDA as amended. Firstly, by Section 31B"
"(1), the labour tribunal is conferred with the jurisdiction to entertain and"
"take  cognisance  of  matters  pertaining  to  termination  of  employment."
"Section  31B  (7)  provides  that  a  person  is  required  to  invoke  such"
"jurisdiction within six months of the alleged termination.  Having been"
"so  established  and  vested  with  the  said  jurisdiction,  the  statute  also"
"provides for the Minister to make a reference under Section 4(1), subject"
"to the limitation of minor disputes, by which the legislature has clearly"
"intended that certain disputes neither be referred to nor adjudicated by"
"an arbitrator."
