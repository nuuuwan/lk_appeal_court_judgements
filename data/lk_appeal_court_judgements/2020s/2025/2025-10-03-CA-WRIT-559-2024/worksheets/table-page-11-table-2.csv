"Asoka Sarath Amarasinghe,5 and the Supreme Court opined as follows (per Priyantha Jayewardena,"
"Principles of natural justice are applicable to every tribunal or body of persons vested with"
"authority to adjudicate upon matters involving rights of individuals. It is likewise applicable to"
"the  exercise  of  judicial  powers  too.  Every  judicial  and  quasi  â€“  judicial  act  is  subject  to  the"
"procedure required by natural justice. The breach of any one of the said rules would violate"
"the principles of natural justice. In the case of Ridge v. Baldwin (1964) A.C. 40 Lord Denning"
"held that a breach of the principles of natural justice renders the decision voidable and not"
"null and void ab initio."
