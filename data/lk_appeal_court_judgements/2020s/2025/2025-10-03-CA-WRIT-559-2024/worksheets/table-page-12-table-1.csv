"L
ord Diplock in the case of O'Reilly v. and Others v. Mackman and Others (1983) 2 AC 237 at"
"276  held  that  the  right  of  a  man  to  be  given  a  fair  opportunity  of  hearing  what  is  alleged"
"against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that"
"it is to be presumed that Parliament intended that a failure to observe it should render null"
"and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement."
"A
 tribunal exercising quasi-judicial functions is not bound to adopt a particular procedure in"
"the absence of statutory provision. In some situations, the tribunals have to act within certain"

"T
he need to follow the principles of natural justice is an accepted norm in Sri Lankan courts"
"and tribunals as well as in the world over for several decades. I am of the opinion that the"
"need to follow principles of natural justice has now become part of the Sri Lankan law. Hence,"
"in  the  absence  of  special  provisions  as  to  how  the  court  or  tribunal  is  to  proceed,  the  law"
"requires that the principles of natural justice to be followed."
"A
 tribunal must do its best to act justly and to reach just ends by just means. It must give the"

"statement made to his prejudice. The party against whom the charge is made, after he has"
"notice of the charges, is entitled to be heard."
"W

"procedures which the inquiry is held, the circumstances, the nature of the right infringed, the"
"occasion for the exercise of authority by the tribunal and the effect of the decision on a person."
"T
he  question  whether  the  requirements  of  natural  justice  have  been  met  by  the  procedure"
"adopted in any given case depends to a greater extent on the facts and circumstances of the"
"case in point. Tucker L.J. held in the case of Russell v. Duke of Norfolk and Others (1949) 1 All"
"E.R. 109 “There are no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and"
"every  kind  of  domestic  tribunal.  The  requirements  of  natural  justice  must  depend  on  the"
"circumstances  of  the  case,  the  nature  of  the  inquiry,  the  rules  under  which  the  tribunal  is"
"acting, the subject matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.”6 (emphasis added)"
