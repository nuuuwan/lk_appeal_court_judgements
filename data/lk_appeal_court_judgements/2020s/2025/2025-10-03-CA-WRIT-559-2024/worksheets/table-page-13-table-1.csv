"In Splendour Media (Pvt.) Limited v. Commissioner General of Labour and others,7 after discussing"
"several authorities on the issue, this Court expressed a similar view on the nature and scope of the"
"hearing to be accorded (per Obeyesekere, J.);"
"This Court reiterates its view that while the nature of the hearing can be left to the discretion"
"of the administrative body, it is fundamental that an Inquiry Officer follow the principles of"
"natural  justice  and  affords  both  parties  a  proper  hearing,  including  an  opportunity  to  the"
"employer  to  present  his  side  of  the  story.  It  must  however  be  emphasised  that  in  ensuring"
"procedural fairness and the adherence with the principles of natural justice, Courts will not"
"impose requirements that make it impossible for administrative bodies to arrive at decisions"
"in an expeditious manner or impose unnecessary shackles on their ability to take decisions."
"That  being  said,  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  a  conclusion  reached  in  violation  of  the"
"fundamental principles of natural justice should not be allowed to standâ€¦8"
