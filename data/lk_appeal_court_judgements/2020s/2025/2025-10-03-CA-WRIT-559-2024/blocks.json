    "text": "(hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Pirivena\u201d) contained in the letter dated 27.02.2024 marked \u2018X9\u2019. Accordingly, the Petitioners have sought writs of Certiorari to quash the said decision marked \u2018X9\u2019 as well as the \u201c\u2019show cause\u201d letters issued by the 1st Respondent marked \u2018X3\u2019, \u2018X6a\u2019 and \u2018X6b\u2019. The Petitioners have also sought a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent and/or the Pirivena Education Board to take steps to re-register or grant registration to the said Pirivena. Additionally, a writ of Mandamus has been sought to direct the 1st Respondent to take steps to allow the 1st Petitioner to work as a pirivena teacher and to pay his salary, to provide books and uniforms to students and other allowances to the Pirivena. When the application was taken up for support, the learned State Counsel on behalf of the Respondents objected to the issuance of formal notice. Although parties moved to file a synopsis of their submissions within 01 week thereafter, no such synopses were received. Factual Background According to the petition, the Sri Devarakshitha Pirivena is located in the Sri Sudharshanarama Temple and the 1st Petitioner is the Viharadhipathi of the Temple and the Principal of the Pirivena. The Pirivena had been established in the year 2005 and had been registered as a \u201cMulika Pirivena\u201d under Regulation 3(6) of the Pirivena Education Regulations No. 01 of 1980 with effect from 01.01.2006 (\u2018P2f\u2019). As a \u201cMulika Pirivena,\u201d the Pirivena conducted classes from Pirivena Grade I to Grade V. The petition also discloses that there were 08 teachers, 08 residential bhikkhus and 47 registered pupils, although only 12 were \u201cactively\u201d engaged in studies.1 Central to the events that unfolded and culminated in the cancellation of the registration of the Pirivena was an inspection conducted by a team of officers from the Pirivena Education Division of the Ministry of Education, including the 2nd Respondent. Although the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X4\u2019) and the 1st Respondent\u2019s letter dated 11.08.2023 (\u2018X6a\u2019) refer to the date of such inspection as 07.07.2020, the log entry lodged by the 2nd Respondent regarding the inspection (\u2018P6d\u2019) in the Log Book maintained by the Pirivena marked \u2018P6\u2019, which can be considered as the most contemporaneous account available to this Court, clearly establishes that such inspection was in fact conducted on 04.09.2020. Such date is also confirmed in the 1st Respondent\u2019s letter dated 03.05.2021 whereby the initial cancellation of the registration was communicated (\u2018P12\u2019). The log entry made by the 2nd Respondent relating to such inspection (\u2018P6d\u2019), inter alia, indicates that the special inspection had been conducted on the directions of the 1st Respondent and contains detailed observations on various shortcomings in the Pirivena. It further records that a report thereon will be submitted to the 1st Respondent. Although the 1st Petitioner\u2019s had complained that he was",

Consequent to the issuance of \u2018P11\u2019, another inspection had been conducted on 02.02.2021 and the log entry thereon (\u2018P6f\u2019) reveals that a discussion on the current status of the Pirivena and future action had taken place with the 1st Petitioner and that certain documents mentioned therein had been inspected. Subsequently, the Petitioners had been informed by letter dated 03.05.2021 under the signature of the 1st Respondent (\u2018P12\u2019) that the registration of the said Pirivena has been cancelled in terms Regulation 10(2)(d) of the Pirivena Education Regulations No. 01 of 1980 enacted under the Pirivena Education Act, No 64 of 1979 with effect from 06.05.2021. The letter refers to the fact that the Pirivena Education Board at the 187th meeting had decided to grant a probationary period of 03 months for the Pirivena to rectify shortcomings, after the cancellation of registration on 22.10.2020. However, since the report of the inspection conducted on 02.02.2021 had indicated that the Pirivena was in the same condition, the Pirivena Education Board at its 188th meeting held on 09.02.2021 had taken the decision to cancel its registration with effect from 06.05.2021. The said letter also states that steps should be taken to either retire the 1st Petitioner from service as a teacher or transfer him to another pirivena. The payment of the 1st Petitioner\u2019s salary was also subsequently stopped (\u2018P14c\u2019).",

The 1st Respondent had reverted to the 2nd Respondent by letter dated 11.08.2023 (\u2018X6a\u2019), pointing out that the show cause notice had been addressed to the 2nd Respondent, and, as such, he alone should respond to it, as the Manager of the Pirivena. The 1st Respondent had also stated that \u2018X4\u2019 appeared to have been submitted by the 1st Petitioner against whom accusations had been made in the notice, and that the signature of the 2nd Respondent therein appeared to be a forgery. After a further reminder (\u2018X6b\u2019) and by letter dated 13.09.2023 (\u2018X7\u2019), the 2nd Petitioner had submitted his reply to the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice. It is observed that the \u2018X7\u2019, which contains detailed responses to the 13 matters referred to in the said notice, appears to be a virtual reproduction of \u2018X4\u2019 under the signature of the 2nd Petitioner. The log entry (\u2018X5\u2019) also shows that another inspection by officers of the Pirivena Education Division had been conducted on 04.07.2023. The log entry discloses that certain instructions had been issued and contains the notation \u201cmatters were satisfactory\u201d (\u0d9a\u0da7\u0dba\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dd4\u0da7\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dba\u0dd2). However, the Pirivena Education Board, at its 200th meeting held on 08.02.2024, had determined that the responses submitted by the 2nd Petitioner to the show cause notice were not acceptable and had therefore decided to once again cancel the registration of the Pirivena. Such decision had been communicated by the 1st Respondent to the 2nd Petitioner by letter dated 22.02.2024 (\u2018X9\u2019). The Petitioners have filed the instant application, being aggrieved by the said decision to cancel the registration of the Pirivena. Legal Framework on Registration and Cancellation of Registration of Pirivenas The Pirivena Education Act, No. 64 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d) (\u2018P15a\u2019), inter alia, contains provisions relating to the registration, maintenance and administration of pirivenas. In this context, it is observed that extensive powers relating to the administration of the Act has been conferred on the Director-General of Pirivena Education in section 18 of the Act as follows;",

Regulation 10 prescribes the procedure to be followed in considering the cancellation of registration of a pirivena and also stipulates several important substantive and procedural safeguards in exercising the powers conferred thereunder. In this context, I also wish to state that the principal benefit conferred by registration under the Pirivena Education Act to a pirivena is the entitlement to receive financial assistance from the State. Consequently, such a pirivena becomes subject to the regulatory regime established under the Act, and, in fact, section 31 thereof expressly provides as follows;",

Thus, there is also a statutory duty cast upon the Respondents to ensure that registration is conferred and maintained only in respect of pirivenas that comply with the provisions of the Pirivena Education Act and the regulations made thereunder, particularly since public funds are expended for the maintenance of such pirivenas. Grounds of Review and Analysis When the application was taken up for support, the grounds relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner were that the decision to cancel the registration of the Pirivena (\u2018X9\u2019) was tainted with mala fides and that the Petitioners had not been afforded a fair hearing. In support of his contentions, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner adverted to several matters. He drew the attention of the Court to \u2018X9\u2019, which refers to an \u201cinspection\u201d (\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dbb\u0dca-\u0dc1\u0db1\u0dba), where the date of such inspection had not been indicated therein. He further submitted that, although the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X3\u2019) and 1st Respondent\u2019s letter \u2018X6a\u2019 refer to an inspection conducted on 07.07.2020, no inspection was in fact carried out on the said date. The response of the learned State Counsel was that the Petitioners had not specifically taken up the position that an inspection had not been conducted on 07.07.2020 in their responses to the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X4\u2019 and \u2018X7\u2019). In this context, as set out in the factual narrative above, the inspection by officers of the Pirivena Education Division referred to in the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice appeared to have been conducted on",

    "text": "04.09.2020 and not on 07.07.2020. This is clearly borne out by the contemporaneous log entry \u2018P6d\u2019 made on the said date regarding such inspection. Furthermore, the said log entry sets out in detail the observations made at the inspection and they correspond to the matters referred to in the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X3\u2019). Hence, it is incumbent upon this Court to consider whether any material prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners by such error. Considering the detailed responses submitted by the Petitioners in respect of each charge in the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice by \u2018X4\u2019 and \u2018X7\u2019, it appears that the Petitioners were fully aware of the inspection referred to in the said notice. Moreover, since the Petitioners were in possession of the Log Book (\u2018P6\u2019) and had access to the log entry (\u2018P6d\u2019), they could have ascertained without much difficulty the inspection referred to in the show cause notice. In such circumstances, I am inclined to the view that no prejudice was caused to the Petitioners by the error in the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice with regard to the date of the inspection. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that no fresh inspection was conducted after the revocation of the initial cancellation of the registration and prior to the issuance of the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X3\u2019). The response of the learned State Counsel on this issue was that the initial cancellation of the registration was revoked by the Respondents for the reason that the Petitioners had not been permitted to show cause, as required by Regulation 10, and that, by later providing the Petitioners an opportunity to do so by the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice in \u2018X3\u2019, the requirements of Regulation 10 were satisfied. She further submitted that there was no statutory impediment for the Respondents to rely on the inspection conducted on 04.09.2020, and, that, the said inspection disclosed acts of misconduct and weaknesses in administration that remained unanswered by the Petitioners. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner also submitted that the Respondents had failed to take account of the inspection conducted by officers of the Pirivena Education Board on 04.07.2023 and in particular the notation made in the log entry (\u2018X5\u2019) that \u201cmatters were satisfactory\u201d (\u0d9a\u0da7\u0dba\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dd4\u0da7\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dba\u0dd2). However, it was submitted by learned State Counsel although the said log entry discloses that official records had been inspected and certain instructions on relocation of classes and maintenance of official records had been issued, it does not offer any justification for the notation that \u201cmatters were satisfactory.\u201d Hence, I am not convinced that the log entry (\u2018X5\u2019) can be considered as conclusive evidence that the shortcomings referred to in the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X3\u2019) had been rectified or that satisfactory progress had been made in the administration of affairs of the Pirivena. The fact that no steps were taken by the Respondents to withdraw the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice after the aforementioned inspection too support my conclusion. In addition, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the allegations of assault against the 1st Petitioner in the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice were devoid of any merit and were maliciously made, and that no criminal charges had been instituted against him. In this context, I wish to observe that",

    "text": "it would not be possible in an application for judicial review to inquire into and determine the merits of such allegation. However, I am inclined to agree with the position taken up by the learned State Counsel that the charge against the 1st Petitioner was of a serious nature considering his status as Principal of the Pirivena, and that the Respondents were entitled to raise such a matter, in view of the observations made in the log entry (\u2018P6d\u2019). Consequent to the aforementioned positions taken up by the parties, the legal issue that arises for determination by this Court is whether the Petitioners have been accorded a fair hearing by the Respondents, considering the facts and circumstances. The requirement to have a fair hearing before such a decision is made to a party whose rights or interests may be adversely affected by a quasi-judicial or administrative decision is well entrenched in our law. The requirement of a fair hearing and the scope of such a hearing have been discussed extensively in Ranjith Flavian Wijeratne v. Asoka Sarath Amarasinghe,5 and the Supreme Court opined as follows (per Priyantha Jayewardena, J.);",

It is likewise applicable to the exercise of judicial powers too. Every judicial and quasi \u2013 judicial act is subject to the procedure required by natural justice. The breach of any one of the said rules would violate the principles of natural justice. In the case of Ridge v. Baldwin (1964) A.C. 40 Lord Denning held that a breach of the principles of natural justice renders the decision voidable and not null and void ab initio. An administrative official or tribunal exercising a quasi - judicial power is bound to comply with the principles of natural justice. i.e. to comply with the rules of audi altera partem and nemo judex in causa sua. A quasi-judicial decision may involve finding of facts and it affects the rights of a person. Sometimes such decisions involve matters of law and facts or even purely matters of law. In Russell v. Duke of Norfolk and Others (1949) 1 All E.R. 109 Tucker LJ. observed that one essential requirement in regard to the exercise of judicial and quasi - judicial powers is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case.

    "text": "tribunal should act according to the principles of natural justice except in cases where such right is excluded, either by express words or by necessary implication, by the legislature. Lord Diplock in the case of O'Reilly v. and Others v. Mackman and Others (1983) 2 AC 237 at 276 held that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that Parliament intended that a failure to observe it should render null and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement. A tribunal exercising quasi-judicial functions is not bound to adopt a particular procedure in the absence of statutory provision. In some situations, the tribunals have to act within certain limits. However, it needs to observe certain minimum standards of natural justice and fairness when discharging its functions. The need to follow the principles of natural justice is an accepted norm in Sri Lankan courts and tribunals as well as in the world over for several decades. I am of the opinion that the need to follow principles of natural justice has now become part of the Sri Lankan law. Hence, in the absence of special provisions as to how the court or tribunal is to proceed, the law requires that the principles of natural justice to be followed. A tribunal must do its best to act justly and to reach just ends by just means. It must give the parties notice of what was charged against them and allow them to make representations in answer. A fair opportunity should be given to a party to correct or contradict any relevant statement made to his prejudice. The party against whom the charge is made, after he has notice of the charges, is entitled to be heard. Whether an oral hearing is necessary or desirable depends on the relevant laws and rules or procedures which the inquiry is held, the circumstances, the nature of the right infringed, the occasion for the exercise of authority by the tribunal and the effect of the decision on a person. The question whether the requirements of natural justice have been met by the procedure adopted in any given case depends to a greater extent on the facts and circumstances of the case in point. Tucker L.J. held in the case of Russell v. Duke of Norfolk and Others (1949) 1 All E.R. 109 \u201cThere are no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of domestic tribunal. The requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.\u201d6 (emphasis added)",

It must however be emphasised that in ensuring procedural fairness and the adherence with the principles of natural justice, Courts will not impose requirements that make it impossible for administrative bodies to arrive at decisions in an expeditious manner or impose unnecessary shackles on their ability to take decisions. That being said, this Court is of the view that a conclusion reached in violation of the fundamental principles of natural justice should not be allowed to stand\u20268 In relation to the instant case, the procedure to be followed in cancelling the registration of a pirivena (or imposing any other measures referred to in Regulation 10(2)) has been prescribed in Regulation 10 of the Pirivena Education Regulations. Regulation 10 stipulates several important substantive and procedural safeguards in exercising the powers conferred thereunder and I will now examine whether they have been complied with in the instant case. In the first instance, it appears that the 1st Respondent has satisfied himself that the conduct of affairs of the Pirivena was unsatisfactory by means of the inspection conducted on 04.09.2020. Thereafter, he had proceeded to issue the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice (\u2018X3\u2019) on the 2nd Petitioner. As evidenced by the responses \u2018X4\u2019 and \u2018X7\u2019, the Petitioners appear to have availed themselves of responding to such \u201cshow cause\u201d notice. The 1st Respondent had also sought to make observations on the Petitioners\u2019 response \u2018X4\u2019 by the document \u2018X6a\u2019. Thereafter, the 1st Respondent has informed the 2nd Petitioner that the responses submitted to the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice were not satisfactory and therefore a decision had been made to cancel the registration of the Pirivena by letter dated 22.02.2024 (\u2018X9\u2019). It is observed that cancellation of registration is one of the four courses of action available under Regulation 10(2) where the conduct of affairs of a pirivena has been found to be unsatisfactory. The said letter (\u2018X9\u2019) also indicates that the decision to cancel the registration of the Pirivena has been made at the 200th meeting of the Pirivena Education Board held on 08.02.2024 after considering the responses to the \u201cshow cause\u201d notice and not being satisfied thereof. It is observed that the Pirivena Education Board consists of the 1st Respondent and the members specified in section 4(1) of the Pirivena Education Act. I am therefore of the view that the Respondents have acted in accordance with the procedure set out in Regulation 10 of the Pirivena Education Regulations",

Although reference has been made to an animosity of a teacher named Nuwan Danushka towards the 1st Petitioner in the petition,10 the Petitioners have not provided any evidence to demonstrate that the said person had any link to or influence in the decision-making process that culminated in the cancellation of registration. Hence, I am compelled to conclude that the allegations of malice made by the Petitioners remain unfounded and should be rejected. The necessity to expressly plead and properly enumerate in detail allegations of mala fides in judicial review applications is well established and has been articulated in by this Court in Bandaranayake v.

    "text": "Apart from the aforementioned grounds of review urged by learned Counsel when the application was taken up for support, there are several other grounds referred to in paragraph 42 of the petition, including that the decision to cancel the registration of the Pirivena was ultra vires, illegal, unreasonable, irrational and an abuse of power. For the sake of completeness, I will endeavour to address such grounds, albeit briefly, due to the paucity of material to substantiate such grounds in the petition. Since the decision to cancel the registration (\u2018X9\u2019) has been made in accordance with the powers conferred by Regulation 10 of the Pirivena Education Regulations and adhering to the procedure prescribed therein, the said decision cannot be considered as being illegal or ultra vires or arbitrary or an abuse of power. Since cancellation of registration was one of the four courses of action prescribed in Regulation 10(2) where the conduct of affairs of a pirivena was found to be unsatisfactory, the adoption of such a course of action cannot be considered as being unreasonable or irrational. In any event, the Petitioners have not adduced any evidence to even indicate otherwise. In the said paragraph, the Petitioners have also stated that the Respondents owe \u201ca public and a statutory duty.\u201d Whilst it has been demonstrated that the Respondents have acted in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 10 in cancelling the registration, the Petitioners have been unable to indicate any other public or statutory duty owed to them by the Respondents that has remained unfulfilled. Although the Petitioners have also contended therein that their legitimate expectation had been adversely affected, they have not established any basis to sustain such a contention, and, in any event, the findings made by me do not support the view that any rights or expectations of the Petitioners have been unlawfully interfered with. In addition, the Petitioners have taken up the position that there was no alternative remedy that they could resort to except invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court. I do not agree; Regulation 10(3) provides a statutory right of appeal to the Secretary, and the petition does not disclose that the Petitioners have availed of the same. In view of the aforementioned findings on the merits of this application, I do not think it is necessary to consider the preliminary legal objections raised by the learned State Counsel relating to lack of uberrima fides, futility and other matters.",
