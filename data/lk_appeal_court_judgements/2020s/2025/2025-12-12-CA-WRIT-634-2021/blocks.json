Sanjeewa Dasanayake with Naamiq Nafath and Akash Rafeek instructed by Athula de Silva for the 15D Respondent.

Introduction In the instant application, the Petitioner, who is an officer in Class III Grade III of the Combined Service in the Sports Field of the Central Provincial Council, has impugned the decision made by the 1st Respondent (Governor of the Central Province) to appoint the 15th Respondent as the Provincial Director of Sports of the Central Province contained in the letter dated 23.11.2021 (\u2018P56\u2019). The Petitioner has sought a writ of Certiorari to quash the said appointment of the 15th Respondent, and the appointments of the 15A, 15B, 15C and 15D Respondents, who replaced the 15th Respondent successively in the said post, during the pendency of this application. The said 15, 15A, 15B, 15C and 15D Respondents are all officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. In addition, the Petitioner has sought writs of Mandamus directing the 1st to 10th Respondents to appoint the Provincial Director of Sports in terms of the procedure and criteria laid down in the Service Minute (\u2018P9\u2019) or, in the alternative, to appoint the Petitioner to the said post. The 1st to 14th Respondents and the 15D Respondent have objected to the reliefs sought by the Petitioner and moved for the dismissal of the instant application. In addition, the 1st to 14th Respondents have also raised several legal objections. Since the said legal objections are",

Accordingly, the application was taken up for argument, and the parties were also afforded an opportunity to file post-hearing written submissions. Factual Background In the first instance, I propose to set out a brief narrative of the factual background extracted from the pleadings and submissions of the parties, which will be helpful in examining the grounds of review in their proper context. The Petitioner, who had been involved in sports in the capacity of an athlete later as a trainer and official, had joined the Ministry of Sports of the Central Provincial Council in the post of a Sports Officer with effect from 15.09.1992 (\u2018P4\u2019). Thereafter, he had been appointed to the post of Coach in Class IV Grade I of the Combined Service in the Sports Field of the Central Provincial Council (\u201cCombined Service in the Sports Field\u201d) by the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Central Provincial Council (\u201cProvincial Public Service Commission\u201d) with effect from 01.01.2008 and to the post of District Sports Officer in Class III Grade III of the said Service with effect from 01.09.2014 (\u2018P6\u2019). The Petitioner had been appointed by the Governor at the time to act in the post of Provincial Director of Sports on 20.01.2017 (\u2018P10\u2019), and according to the Petitioner, such appointment was granted as he was the most senior officer in Class III Grade III of the said Combined Service in the Sports Field.1 In terms of the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field, 1999 (\u2018P9\u2019) the post of Provincial Director of Sports is designated as a post in Class III-Grade II of the said Service and requires 5 years of satisfactory service in Class III-Grade III in order to be eligible to be substantively appointed to such post. The method of promotion specified in the said Service Minute contemplate applications being called internally from officers in the Department of Sports of the Central Provincial Council and the selection being made according to the order of merit at an interview. Since the Petitioner had completed 5 years\u2019 service in Class III-Grade III on 01.09.2019, he had made a request to the Governor that he be appointed to the post of Provincial Director of Sports on permanent basis by letter dated 04.11.2019 (\u2018P11\u2019). The Secretary to the Chief Ministry and the Ministry of Education and Sports of the Province had recommended such request by letter dated 19.11.2019 (\u2018P12\u2019). However, the Petitioner had been informed by the Secretary to the Governor by letter dated 16.09.2020 (\u2018P15\u2019), inter alia, that, according to the cadre approved by the Department of Management Services, the post of Provincial Director",

Although the Petitioner had submitted an appeal on 05.10.2020 (\u2018P16\u2019), it appears that such position has not changed. Thereafter, the 1st Respondent Governor had proceeded to appoint the 15th Respondent, who was an officer Grade II of the SLAS, to the post of Provincial Director of Sports by letter dated 23.11.2021 (\u2018P56\u2019/\u20191R1\u2019).

    "text": "Analysis of the Grounds of Review and Submissions of the Parties In this segment of the Judgement, I wish to address the key issues arising from the aforementioned grounds of review and the submissions made by the parties. In the first instance, it is observed that the provisions of the Sports Statute of the Central Provincial Council and the declaration made under the Provincial Councils Pensions Act cited by the Petitioner clearly establish that the post of Provincial Director of Sports has been duly established as a pensionable post in the provincial public service of the Central Provincial Council. Further, the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field, 1999 (\u2018P9\u2019) has also been enacted by the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Central Provincial Council and approved by the Hon. Governor in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Provincial Councils Act. Thus, the principal issue of contention between the parties that this Court must determine is whether the post of Director of Sports has been transformed into a cadre post of the SLAS, as contended by the Respondents. Such transformation appears to have commenced with the establishment of the DMS in 1999 and the review and approval of the cadre and salaries of the Provincial Department of Sports in 2012 (\u2018P21\u2019 and \u2018P22\u2019/ \u20181R6\u2019 and \u20181R6a\u2019/ \u20183R6\u2019 and \u20183R6a\u2019). Although the approval of cadre and salaries was for a period of three years, such period of validity had been indefinitely extended by the DMS on 22.11.2021 until the next cadre review for Provincial Councils is conducted (\u2018P55\u2019/ \u20181R10\u2019/ \u20183R10\u2019). The Petitioner took up the position that the DMS has no power to dictate terms to the Provincial Councils in respect of their cadre. Thus, it is incumbent upon this Court to examine the validity or otherwise of the conduct of the DMS in this instance. All parties rely on the Circular No. DMS/E1/99 dated 05.05.1999 (\u2018P36\u2019/ \u20181R11\u2019/ \u20183R11\u2019) relating to the establishment of the DMS, and as such, I too intend to be guided by the said Circular in identifying its mandate and functions. I wish to observe that the said Circular is not addressed to Provincial Councils and further, the only reference to Provincial Councils therein is in item 15 of Annex A, which states that the DMS can provide consultancy services to Provincial Councils and Local",

By virtue of the extension of the validity period of such approval, the approvals and directions contained therein continue in force, to date. Of particular significance to the instant case is the fact that the post of Provincial Director of Sports has been designated therein as a post reserved for the SLAS.",

The letter addressed by the Chief Secretary to the Hon.

Notwithstanding such matter, it appears that the Governor\u2019s letter is based on the information and request contained in the Chief Secretary\u2019s letter dated 20.02.2006, and, in fact, attached such letter as an annexure.

    "text": "is not among the posts recommended in the Chief Secretary\u2019s letter to be included in the SLAS Service Minute. If so, it may also indicate that Provincial Director of Sports was not a post held or reserved for SLAS officers, at least up to such time. Thus, I am of the view that the aforementioned Governor\u2019s letter cannot per se be accepted as granting approval for the inclusion of the post of Provincial Director of Sports as a post reserved for the SLAS. On the other hand, the Petitioner has submitted information obtained through a series of requests made under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 (RTI requests) to several agencies, including the DMS, the Governor, Chief Secretary and other provincial authorities. Of particular significance is the response received from the Secretary to the Governor dated 08.03.2021 (\u2018P43\u2019) to RTI request dated 25.01.2021 (\u2018P25\u2019). In the said letter (\u2018P43\u2019), it has been stated, inter alia, that there was no order issued by the Governor to either abolish or suppress the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field in the subject file, and, similarly there was no record of any letter of consent or concurrence issued by the Governor to the DMS or to any other official in the Treasury for the designation of the post of Provincial Director of Sports as a post approved for the SLAS. I observe that, since any request should have been made or approval granted to designate such post as a post in the SLAS or to abolish a Service Minute could only have been lawfully made by the Governor in his capacity of the head of the provincial public service, evidence of such matters should necessarily reside and be available in the official records maintained in the Governor\u2019s Secretariat. Hence, the only reasonable conclusion that could be drawn from the response to the Petitioner\u2019s right to information request (\u2018P43\u2019) is that no request has been made or approval granted to either abolish the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field or to designate the post of Provincial Director of Sports as a post reserved for the SLAS. The response of the Chief Secretary dated 23.02.2021 (\u2018P38\u2019) to a further RTI request (\u2018P29\u2019) resulted in the disclosure of the recommendations made by the Chief Secretary to the DMS for the cadre review conducted in 2012 (\u2018P39\u2019). In relation to the Sports Department, such recommendations specifically state that the post of Provincial Director of Sports should be a post in the Combined Service in the Sports Field and that the said post is also included in the Sports Statute. Thus, it would appear that, at the time of the cadre review in 2012, a specific request had been made to retain the post of Provincial Director of Sports as a post in the Combined Service in the Sports Field, and, that the DMS acted contrary to such request. Consequently, I will proceed to consider whether the DMS is legally empowered to unilaterally designate posts in the provincial public service as posts reserved for the SLAS. In so far as its status is concerned, the DMS is a Government Department within the Ministry of Finance. It is re-iterated that its mandate in terms of the Circular marked \u2018P36\u2019 relating to Provincial Councils is limited to the provision of consultancy services. Neither the Respondents nor the Petitioner has submitted to this Court that the DMS is vested with any other statutory powers. Hence, I hold that the DMS is not empowered to unilaterally designate posts in the provincial",

Therefore, I categorically reject the contention of the 15D Respondent that the cadre approval of the DMS supersedes the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field (\u2018P9\u2019).10 Representations to this Court was made to say that the Public Service Commission (PSC), which is the appointing authority in respect of the SLAS, had amended the Service Minute of the SLAS including the post of \u201cDirector\u201d in Provincial Departments in the Schedule of Posts of the SLAS (\u2018P66\u2019), thereby enabling an SLAS officer to be appointed to the post of Provincial Director of Sports. Furthermore, the 1st to 14th Respondents have raised a legal objection in their written submissions based on Article 61A of the Constitution that this Court has no jurisdiction to inquire into a decision of the PSC. Whilst I will address the said legal objection elsewhere, I wish to observe herein that neither has the PSC been made a party to this application nor has any relief been sought against it in the petition by the Petitioner. In its reply written submissions, the Petitioner has expressly declared that he is not directly or indirectly impugning the Service Minute (\u2018P66\u2019). Keeping such position in mind, I intend to confine myself to a few observations on the issue, as the Respondents have sought to rely on the said SLAS Service Minute to justify the appointment of SLAS officers to the post concerned. Firstly, the material before this Court does not indicate any request or justification for the post of Director of Sports in the Central Provincial Council, at least to be declared as a scheduled post of the SLAS in the said Service Minute. In such circumstances, at the very least, the inclusion of such post in the SLAS Service Minute would appear to raise serious questions regarding compliance with Article 55(4) of the Constitution, as pointed out by the Petitioner. The final issue to be addressed relates to the scheme of recruitment applicable to the post of Provincial Director of Sports. The position of the Petitioner is that the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field (\u2018P9\u2019) remains in force. The Respondents contend that such Service Minute has been abolished, and, as such, only an officer of the SLAS could be appointed on a permanent basis to such post, as provided for in the SLAS Service Minute (\u2018P66\u2019).",

    "text": "The Petitioner\u2019s response to such position of the Respondents is that, although separate schemes of recruitment have been formulated for the posts of District Sports Officer, Trainer and Sports Officer, which are lower posts, no separate scheme of recruitment has been formulated for the post of Provincial Director of Sports, and, as such, appointment to the said post continues to be governed by the Service Minute.12 I am inclined to accept the aforementioned position taken up by the Petitioner, that the appointment to the post of Provincial Director of Sports continues to be governed by the Service Minute (\u2018P9\u2019) for several reasons. Firstly, it is a well-established principle in the public service that there should be a scheme of recruitment for every post13 and that any amendment/alteration should be expressly incorporated into the said scheme of recruitment.14 It is also well established that a scheme of recruitment should not be changed to meet transitionary problems and that prior approval should be obtained for any deviations.15 There is no evidence that any attempt has been made to amend the Service Minute (\u2018P9\u2019) by the authorities which formulated it. Secondly, the position taken by the Respondent presupposes that a scheme of recruitment may be amended or abolished by implication. Not only is such a practice unknown to the aforementioned existing legal provisions governing the public service, but it would also lead to uncertainty and abuse. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, the purported change to the scheme of recruitment envisaged under \u2018P9\u2019, by changing the designation of the post from a post in the provincial public service to a SLAS post, has been effected by the DMS, which had no lawful authority to do so, and as such, the purported change itself is illegal. Upon consideration of the aforementioned matters, I am of the view that the 1st to 14th Respondents were in error in concluding that the post of Provincial Director of Sports was not a post in the provincial public services and that it was a post designated or reserved for the SLAS. Consequently, I hold that the decision of the 1st Respondent to appoint the 15th Respondent (\u2018P56\u2019) and thereafter the 15A - 15D Respondents to the post of Provincial Director of Sports, upon the basis that only SLAS officers were entitled to be appointed to that post on permanent basis, and the decision not to consider the Petitioner for such post (\u2018P15\u2019) is bad in law. In arriving at such decisions, the 1st Respondent has not only acted ultra vires the provisions of the Provincial Councils Act, the Sports Statute of the Central Provincial Council and the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field (\u2018P9\u2019) but has also abdicated and fettered the discretion conferred thereunder.",

    "text": "As cited by the Petitioner, in Ranjani Priyalatha v. Provincial Public Service Commission,16 this Court (per Sriskandarajah, J.) considered the provisions of the Service Minute of the Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Medical Service and the Ayurvedic Statute No. 18 of 1990 of the Central Provincial Council. The Court held that provisions of the Service Minute that are inconsistent with the Provincial Statute will be inoperative within the Central Province so long as the Statute is in force. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the power or authority to appoint the Provincial Commissioner of Ayurveda is vested in the Governor and/or the Provincial Public Commission and not the Public Service Commission, which was the appointing authority in terms of the Service Minute. I am of the view that the reasoning in the aforementioned case should be followed in determining the application of the SLAS Service Minute (\u2018P66\u2019), insofar as the appointment to the post of Provincial Director of Sports of the Central Provincial Council is concerned. The Petitioner has also contended that his legitimate expectation has been defeated by the conduct of the 1st Respondent in not considering him for appointment to the post of Provincial Director of Sports despite having fulfilled the requisite eligibility criteria set out in the Service Minute of the Combined Service in the Sports Field (\u2018P9\u2019). The doctrine of legitimate expectation, in both its substantive and procedural form, is well entrenched in our law and has been given effect to by the Superior Courts in the exercise of the fundamental rights17 and writ18 jurisdictions. It is observed that the fact that the Petitioner had fulfilled the eligibility set out in clause 8(iii) of the Service Minute (\u2018P9\u2019) (page 6), has not been expressly denied by the Respondents. Furthermore, the Petitioner was also appointed to act in the said post by the 1st Respondent (\u2018P10\u2019/ \u20181R9\u2019/ \u20183R9\u2019) and his appeal to have such acting appointment made permanent had been recommended by the 3rd Respondent. I am of the view that the aforementioned factors demonstrate that the Petitioner could have lawfully and reasonably entertained a legitimate expectation to be considered for appointment to the post of Provincial Director of Sports. The Petitioner has further alleged that the 2nd, 3rd, 11th, 12th, and 13th Respondents, who are officers of the SLAS, are biased against the Petitioner and are acting with an ulterior motive. The Petitioner has attached the Seniority List of Special Grade Officers of the SLAS as at 02.01.2023 (\u2018P67\u2019) in support of his contention. However, whilst such Seniority List only",

Hence, the Respondents allege that the Petitioner is indirectly seeking to challenge a decision of the Public Service Commission, contrary to the legal maxim \"quando liquid prohibetur ex directo, prohibetur et per obliquum\" (what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly). They have submitted several authorities in support of the aforementioned constitutional ouster clause Article 61A20 and the legal maxim.21 In his reply written submissions, the Petitioner has stated that the impugned appointment has been made by the 1st Respondent and not by the PSC.22 He has further expressly stated that he is not directly or indirectly impugning the Service Minute (\u2018P66\u2019). In addition, he has pointed out that such objection had been raised belatedly after the pleadings had closed and should not be entertained. I wish to observe that, as pointed out by the Petitioners, the appointment that has been impugned in this application (\u2018P56\u2019) is an appointment which has been made by the 1st Respondent Governor. The letter (\u2018P56\u2019) expressly declares that the said appointment has been made in the exercise of the powers vested in the Governor under section 32(1) of the Provincial Councils Act. Such an appointment is fully amenable to review by this Court and is not protected by Article 61A of the Constitution. Further, the Petitioner has not impugned the SLAS Service Minute or sought any relief against the PSC in the instant application. Hence, I",

In any event, whilst re-iterating my observations above, I am of the view that it is not necessary for the Petitioner to impugn \u2018P66\u2019 in order to obtain the reliefs sought in the instant application. Hence, this objection raised by the 15D Respondent is rejected. (b) Lack of Uberrima Fides Once again in their written submissions, the 1st to 14th Respondents have taken up the position that the Petitioner had suppressed information about complaints of irregularities made against him and a preliminary investigation conducted in respect same, and, as such, he lacked uberrima fides and had suppressed and misrepresented facts to this Court.24 The material upon which such objection is based, namely, a report of a preliminary investigation dated 28.12.2022 and a charge sheet issued against the Petitioner dated 24.04.2024, has been tendered to this Court by the said Respondents by way of a motion dated 16.07.2025, after the hearing into the application was concluded. I find the manner in which such objection has been raised and the supporting material tendered to this Court highly irregular. In this context, I also wish to observe that the aforementioned preliminary investigation appears to have been completed by the time objections were filed by the Respondents in this application. Hence, if they wished the Court to take cognizance of such matter, reference could have been made and documents tendered through their objections. They failed to do so. However, by raising such matter after the hearing has been concluded, the Respondents have effectively prevented the Petitioner from responding to the allegations made and explaining his conduct.",
