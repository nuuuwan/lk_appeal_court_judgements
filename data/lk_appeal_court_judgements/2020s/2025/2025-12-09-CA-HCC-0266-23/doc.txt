JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “appellant”) has

been indicted in the High Court of Kaluthara in High Court case number

HCC 895/14.

2. The charges in the indictment are as follows;

Charge 01

That on or about July 10, 2011, at Palatota, in the district of

Kaluthara, within the jurisdiction of this Court, the appellant did

commit murder by causing the death of one Dayawathi

Kaluarrachchi, an offence punishable under section 296 of the

Penal Code.

Page 3 of 13

Charge 02

That at the same time, place and during the same course of

transaction as mentioned in the first charge, the appellant

committed the offence or robbery by robbing a gold ring from the

possession of one Dayawathi Kaluarrachchi, an offence punishable

under section 380 of the Penal Code.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the first charge and acquitted him of the

second charge. The appellant upon being convicted of the first charge

has been sentenced to death.

4. The appellant aggrieved by the conviction, disputed judgment together

with the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. The appellant is the deceased’s son. They have resided in the same house

until the incident referred to in the first charge. PW01, the deceased’s

niece, has lived in a nearby house. The deceased has had confided in

PW01 about the harassment she was experiencing at the hands of the

appellant. She has also revealed to PW01 that she feared for her life due

to this harassment.

6. On the date of the incident, PW01 has observed that lights of the

deceased’s house were unlit. Concerned, PW01 accompanied by PW02,

have proceeded to the house of the deceased to investigate. Upon finding

Page 4 of 13

the front door unlocked, they have entered the house. Inside, they

discovered the deceased lying on the kitchen floor, having sustained

visible injuries to her head and face.

7. PW01 has questioned the deceased, who then has identified the

appellant as her assailant [Kelum hit me]. The deceased, has been

hospitalized following this disclosure and later died while receiving

treatment.

8. Dr. S. S. H. De. Silva (PW08), the Additional Judicial Medical Officer,

Kaluthara has conducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased.

During the examination, Dr. De Silva has documented five injuries to the

deceased’s head and face, along with internal bleeding on the right side

of the brain, consistent with the external injuries. He has opined that the

cause of death was intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from blunt

trauma. The post-mortem report authored by Dr. De Silva has been

submitted as evidence and marked as පැ-01.

Case of the appellant

9. The appellant has asserted that on the day in question, the deceased

provided him with a ring to pawn, requesting that he use the proceeds to

purchase medicine for her. The appellant has complied. When he

returned home with the medicine, he has found a crowd that had

gathered and has been informed that the deceased had been taken to the

hospital. He also maintained that he was subsequently detained by the

police.

Grounds of appeal

10. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for

the appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal;

i. Has the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the

prosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable

doubt based on circumstantial evidence?

ii. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the dying

declaration in its correct perspective.

iii. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the

defence’s case.

11. The legal principles of dying declarations have originated in English

common law based on the maxim “nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri”

(a man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth) and is applied

today as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, though with specific

conditions in different legal systems.

12. The concept of trustworthiness is rooted in the belief that a person at the

point of death with no hope of recovery has a profound spiritual incentive

to tell the truth, similar to being under oath. The rational for admitting

this type of evidence (despite it being hearsay and not subject to cross

examination) is necessity. Often, the victim is the only eye-witness to the

crime and excluding his or her declaration might allow a perpetrator to

escape justice.

Page 6 of 13

13. The admissibility conditions remain. They are as follows;

(a) The person who made the declaration must be unavailable as a

witness because he is the deceased.

(b) The declaration must have been made when the declarant

believed his death was imminent and had abandoned all hope

of recovery.

(c) The contents of the declaration must relate to the cause or

circumstances of what the declarant believed to be his

impending death.

14. In Sri Lanka, Section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance No.14 of 1895

stipulates conditions under which a declaration made by a deceased

individual can be considered relevant in legal proceedings, particularly

when it pertains to the cause of death. This provision acknowledges that

certain declarations made by a person who is no longer alive can hold

significant weight in determining the circumstances surrounding his

demise.

15. Section 32(1) of the evidence ordinance is as follows;

“32. Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a

person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has

become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance

cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense

which, under the circumstances of the case, appears to the

court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the

following cases:-

Page 7 of 13

(1) When the statement is made by a person as to the

cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of

the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in

which the cause of that person’s death comes into

question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made

them was or was not, at the time when they were made,

under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature

of the proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into

question.”

16. According to section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance a declaration

regarding a relevant fact made by a deceased person is admissible, if it

directly relates to the cause of death. This provision also plays a crucial

role in ensuring that valuable information is not lost due to absence of

the declarant, thereby facilitating the pursuit of justice and truth in

cases involving death.

17. Absence of cross examination, physical and mental state of the

declarant, potential for bias or motive to lie, risk of imagination or

suggestions, incomplete or inconsistent statements by the declarant are

some of the inherent weaknesses of a dying declaration.

18. In Ranasinghe vs. AG, [2007] 1 SLR 218 at page 221, Sisira De Abrew, J,

has discussed the above as follows;

“As there are inherent weaknesses in a dying

declaration which I have stated above, the trial Judge or the

jury as the case may be must be satisfied beyond reasonable

Page 8 of 13

doubt on the following matters. (a) Whether the deceased, in

fact, made such a statement. (b) Whether the statement made

by the deceased was true and accurate. (c) Whether the

statement made by the deceased person could be accepted

beyond reasonable doubt. (d) Whether the evidence of the

witness who testifies about the dying declaration could be

accepted beyond reasonable doubt. (e) Whether witness is

telling the truth. (f) Whether the deceased was able to speak

at the time the alleged declaration was made.”

19. PW01 has testified that when she entered the deceased’s house, PW01

has observed the deceased lying on the floor of the kitchen with injuries.

PW01 has inquired for the deceased as to who caused the injuries to her.

The deceased has uttered “Kelum hit me”. Consequently, the deceased

has been admitted to the hospital for treatment and she has passed away

while receiving treatment while at the hospital.

20. It is contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant, that the

deceased’s capacity to speech would have been significantly impaired by

the time PW01 discovered her lying on the floor making it highly

improbable that the declaration attributed to the deceased could have

been made.

21. It has been established that the deceased possessed literacy and suffered

from no known speech impediment. The appellant has identified a

Kalum, it’s the son of the deceased and they have resided together in the

same household.

Page 9 of 13

Further, the postmortem examination’s findings are critical. The nature

of the deceased’s injuries precluded neither an instantaneous loss of

consciousness nor immediate impairment of her speech capabilities. The

attending medical officer has concluded that the deceased would have

retained the ability to speak at the time she was confronted by PW01.

Furthermore, the deceased’s capacity to identify her assailant is not in

dispute, owing to her intimate familiarity with the appellant. This context

renders it exceptionally improbable that a mother would, in her final

moments, deliberately make a false declaration implicating her own son.

Under those circumstances, the relevant contention of the Counsel for

the appellant must fail.

22. PW08, Dr. De Silva, has testified that the corresponding internal injury,

specifically bleeding on the right side of the brain, was, in the ordinary

course of nature sufficient to cause the death of the deceased.

Furthermore, in King vs. Thajudeen, 6 NLR 16 at page 19, Bonser, J, has

held that, “when people cause injuries to another man their intent must

be judged by the result of their action”.

“But it was urged that they did not intend to break the

man’s rib and therefore they could not be convicted of

grievous hurt. No doubt they had not in their mind at the time

they struck him their baton and with their fists any definite

idea that they were going to break his ribs or any particular

rib; but when people cause injuries to a man, their intent must

be judged by the result of their action. They must be deemed

in law to have intended what they did”.

[vide King vs. Thajudeen 6 NLR 16]

Page 10 of 13

23. In light of medical evidence and legal precedent, it can be inferred that

the appellant intended to inflict the injury upon the deceased which was,

in the ordinary course of nature, sufficient to cause her death.

24. While the learned High Court Judge has not explicitly stated this

conclusion in so many words, he has thoroughly referred to the injuries

inflicted on the deceased. He has also meticulously examined the

medical evidence elicited at the trial and established a clear connection

between the injuries and the deceased’s death. Consequently, it can be

understood that the learned High Court Judge has implicitly concluded

that the appellant has committed murder under the third limb of section

294 of the Penal Code.

25. The learned Counsel for the appellant has also submitted that the

learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the facts,

specifically in concluding that the appellant attempted to flee upon being

accosted by PW03, after the deceased was hospitalized. It has been

contended that the testimony merely demonstrates that the appellant

turned away, rather than evidencing an attempt to flee.

26. In convicting the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has not relied

solely on the solitary circumstance earlier referred to. Rather the learned

High Court Judge has assessed the totality of the evidence on record and

found the deceased’s declaration to PW01 was consistent with other

independent circumstances. Taken together those circumstances have

Page 11 of 13

lent assurance to the reliability of the deceased’s declaration and

justified the Court’s reliance on it.

27. Having considered the matters discussed above, the Court concludes

that neither the omission nor the misdirection has occasioned a failure of

justice.

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 (as

amended) provides,

“Subject to the provisions herein before contained any

judgment passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall not

be reversed or altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has

occasioned a failure of justice.

28. Further, the deceased’s injuries have been confined solely to her face and

head. Notably, no injuries have been observed on her limbs or hip. It is a

recognized observation that falls commonly result in injuries to a

person’s limbs and/or, hip area. Therefore, the absence of such typical

fall related trauma to the limbs and hip, coupled with exclusive facial

and head injuries allows a Court to infer that the deceased’s injuries

were not sustained as a result of a fall.

Page 12 of 13

29. In his dock statement, the appellant has asserted that he was not at

home at the time of the incident in question but rather was in town.

However, it is noteworthy that the appellant has not raised such plea of

alibi after the indictment was served with notice to the Attorney General

at any time prior to fourteen days of the commencement of the trial [vide

section 126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act] nor has he raised

this alibi during the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses.

These omissions raise significant questions about the reliability of his

claim. Furthermore, the appellant has failed to provide any explanation

regarding his activities in town, for the four hour period surrounding the

incident, leaving a gap in his narrative that could cast doubt on his

credibility.

30. In Gunasiri and Two Others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SLR 39,

Sisira De Abrew, J, has held that,

“It is rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross

examination, it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue

ought to be accepted. The failure to suggest the defense of alibi to

the prosecution witness, who implicated the accused, indicates that

it was a false one.”

31. The learned High Court Judge has given particular attention to these

discrepancies when evaluating the appellant’s dock statement. The

learned High Court Judge has considered the statement in a holistic

manner taking into account not only the contents of the appellant’s case,

but also the context, and its implications. He has integrated the alibi

alongside the prosecution’s testimonies and evidence. However, despite

Page 13 of 13

the appellant’s assertions, the learned High Court Judge has found the

provided explanation unsatisfactory and lacking in substantiation.

32. Ultimately because of these concerns, regarding the appellant’s

credibility and the implausibility of his alibi, the learned High Court

Judge has not been inclined to give weight to his narrative. The learned

High Court Judge has therefore chosen not to act upon the appellant’s

statement, reflecting a judicial assessment of the evidence presented.

33. In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the conviction

and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order.

34. Accordingly, I affirm the conviction, the disputed judgment together with

the sentencing order and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.

I make no order regarding costs.

35. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Kaluthara for compliance.
