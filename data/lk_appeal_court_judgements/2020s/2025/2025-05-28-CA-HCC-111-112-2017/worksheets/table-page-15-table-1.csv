"a  disturbance  of  the  equanimity  of  his  mind.  It  may  be  caused  by  any"
"method which would produce any one of the above results-by mere words"
"which may not amount to abuse or by words of abuse, by a blow with hands"
"or stick or club or by a pelting of stones or by any other more serious method"
"of doing personal violence."
"The next requisite is that the provocation must be such as to bring it within"
"the  category  termed  sudden,  that  is  to  say,  that  there  should  be  a  close"
"proximation  in  time  between  the  acts  of  provocation  and  of  retaliation-"
"which  is  a  question  of  fact.  This  element  is  of  importance  in  reaching  a"
"decision  as  to  whether  the  time  that  elapsed  between  the  giving  of"
"provocation and the committing of the retaliatory act was such as to have"
"afforded and did in fact afford the assailant an opportunity of regaining his"
"normal composure, in other words, whether there had been a "" cooling "" of"
"his temper."
"The  third  element  is  that  the  provocation  should  be  grave.  That  is  the"
"element with which we are concerned particularly in this case. Provocation"
"would be grave where an ordinary or average man of the class to which this"
"accused belongs would feel annoyed or irritated by the provocation given to"
"the extent that he would, smarting under the provocation given, resent the"
"act of provocation or retaliate it. It is entirely dependent upon the act of the"
"provoker  and  cannot  be  said  to  be  based  upon  the  nature  or  mode  of"
"resentment  adopted  by  the  person  provoked  in  giving  expression  to  his"
"resentment.‚Äù"
