"the act of stabbing. In this regard it is pertinent to refer to the observations"
"of Agha Haidar, J. (Broadway, J. agreeing) in Jan Muhammad vs. Emperor"
"(supra)"
"""Each  case  must  depend  upon  its  own  facts  and  circumstances.  In  the"
"present  case  my  view  is  that,  in  judging  the  conduct  of  the  accused,  one"
"must  not  confine  himself  to  the  actual  moment  when  the  blow,  which"
"ultimately proved to be fatal, was struck, that is to say, one must not take"
"into consideration only the event which took place immediately before the"
"fatal blow was struck. We must take into consideration the previous conduct"
"of the woman. Her evil ways were the common scandal of the village and"
"must have been known to the husband, causing him extreme mental agony,"
"shame and humiliation""."
