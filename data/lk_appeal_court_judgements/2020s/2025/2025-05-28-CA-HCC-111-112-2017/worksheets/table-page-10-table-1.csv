"nevertheless the provocation must still be grave. It must have some element"
"of gravity. The merest idle word or gesture. . . is not sufficient. "" However,"
"the  proper  construction  of  the  word  'grave'  has  been  the  subject  of  acute"
"controversy in Ceylon."
"Several  different  interpretations  of  ""gravity""  have  been  suggested  in  the"
"cases:"
"(a)  Provocation  is  grave  when  a  reasonable  man  would  be  prompted  to"
"retaliate against it;"
"(b) Gravity of provocation requires that the provocation offered should be"
"such as to result in loss of self-control in the person provoked;"
"(c) The element of gravity of provocation is satisfied in circumstances where"
"the reasonable man would resent deeply the provocation offered;"
"(d) Provocation is grave only where the reasonable man is likely to lose his"
"self-control in consequence of the provocation.‚Äù"
