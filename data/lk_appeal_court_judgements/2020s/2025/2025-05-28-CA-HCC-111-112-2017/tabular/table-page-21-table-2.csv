"In King vs. Widanalage Lanty, 42 NLR 317, His Lordship Moseley SPJ held that"
"â€œThe remaining ground of appeal is that the jury were not directed properly"
"on the matter of a fight before the deceased was stabbed. That is to say, that"
"it was not brought to the notice of the jury that there was some evidence"
"upon which, if they believed it, it was open to them to find that the appellant"
"was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as provided by"
"exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code. The learned Judge did in fact"
"put it to the jury that, if they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt by"
"the  evidence  for  the  prosecution,  it  was  clearly  their  duty  to  find  the"
"appellant guilty of murder, but that, if they believed the defence, they would"
"not hesitate to acquit him. No question of culpable homicide not amounting"
"to murder, he said, arose on his defence. It is a fact that no such defence"
