"which took away from the person doing it all control over his actions, but"
"that that feeling had an adequate cause. It has, therefore, been held in a"
"series of cases that the commission of adultery by a wife within the sight of"

"inflicted."
"Information received from a reliable person and believed to be credible as"

"neighbourhood and the existence of which is instantaneously verified, can"
"be said to be provocation given by the person committing that act just as"
"much as if the person provoked had seen it in the first place with his own"
"eyes."
"""It must not however be understood that any trivial provocation, which in"
"point of law amounts to an assault, or even a blow, will of course reduce the"
"crime  of  the  party  killing  to  manslaughter...  For  where  the  punishment"
"inflicted  for  a  slight  transgression  of  any  sort  is  outrageous  in  its  nature"
"either in the manner or the continuance of it, and beyond all proportion to"
"the  offence,  it  is  rather  to  be  considered  as  the  effect  of  a  brutal  and"
"diabolical malignity than Of human frailty: it is one of the true symptoms"
"of what the law denominates malice; and therefore the crime will amount"
"to murder, notwithstanding such provocation.‚Äù"
