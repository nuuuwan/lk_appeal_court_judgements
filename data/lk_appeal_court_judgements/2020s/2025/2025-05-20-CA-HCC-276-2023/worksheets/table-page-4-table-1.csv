"remarked  thus:  “In  order  to  base  a  conviction  on  circumstantial  evidence"
"the Jury must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt"
"of  the  accused  and  inconsistent  with  any  reasonable  hypothesis  of  this"
"innocence.”"
"In  King  v.  Appuhamy  46  NLR  128  Kueneman  J  held  thus:  “  in  order  to"
"justify  the  inference  of  guilt  from  purely  circumstantial  evidence,  the"
"inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused"
"and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable-hypothesis the that"
"of his guilt.”"
"In Podisingho v. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J remarked thus: “That in a case of"
"circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to tell the Jury that"
"such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused"
"and must only be consistent with his guilt.”"
"Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I"
"hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to"
"be  drawn,  such  an  inference  must  be  the  one  and  only  irresistible  and"
"inescapably conclusion that the accused committed the offence. When the"
"evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and"
"inescapable conclusion that  can be arrived at is that the accused committed"
"the murder of Prema Jayawardwene.”"
