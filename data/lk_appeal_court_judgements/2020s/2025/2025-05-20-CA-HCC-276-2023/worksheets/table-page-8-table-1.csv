"I am of the opinion that if the learned Trial Judge had treated these unsatisfactory"
"features in the evidence led in the case in his correct perspective, he would never"
"have found the Accused guilty of the charge leveled against him."
"For the reasons stated above, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed"
"on the Accused Appellant and acquit the Accused Appellant."
"Appeal allowed."
