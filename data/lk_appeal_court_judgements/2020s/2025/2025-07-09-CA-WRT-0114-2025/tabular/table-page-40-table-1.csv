"Besides,  an 
“on-site”  visit  of  office  premises  of  all 
five  substantially"
"responsive  bidders,  would  in  my  opinion,  probably,  be  the  best  method  in"
"evaluating a bid for; it would certainly, demonstrate the real situation of the"
"capabilities and abilities  of a  bidder  to  execute  the  contract  if  awarded  for;"
"like  in  this  instance,  the  TEC  had  found  upon  its  “on-site”  visit  of  office"
"premises of all five substantially responsive bidders, that the Petitioner, had"
"failed to demonstrate a fully functional office set up necessary for the proper"
"and  timely,  execution  of  the  contract  if  awarded  to  it  for;  the  Petitioner"
"company  was  operating  from  a  location  still,  under  construction  and  that"
"that,  the  TEC  was  informed  by  the  remaining  staff  of  the  Petitioner  that"
"many  employees  were  working  from  home,  which  findings  of  facts  and  or"
"observations 
of 
the 
TEC 
would 
still 
remain, 
unchallenged 
and"
"uncontroverted by the Petitioner for; neither in the Petition of the Petitioner"
"nor in the counter affidavit nor in the comprehensive written submission of"
"the Petitioner, had the Petitioner ever, sought to refute it and or controvert it"
"and  or  challenge  it  by  proof  on  the  contrary  which  would  no  doubt,  raise"
"serious  concerns  about  the  Petitioner’s  Operational  Stability  as  rightly,"
"observed  by 
the  TEC  on 
its 
“on-site” 
visit.  This  alone,  clearly,  and"
"unequivocally  shows  that,  although  it  being  the  Substantially  Responsive"
"Lowest  Bidder,  the  Petitioner 
is  not 
in  any  manner,  a  responsible  and"
"trustworthy  bidder 
to  be  awarded 
the 
tender 
in  question  as 
rightly,"
"determined by the TEC and the Procuring Entity."
"Hence, I would hold that, the bids of all five substantially responsive bidders"
"had  been  evaluated  by  the  TEC  strictly,  in  accordance  with  the  manner"
"stipulated  in  the  Clause  10.7  of  the  Bidding  Document  (X6)  and  therefore,"
"the  evaluation  of  the  bids  of  all  five  substantially  responsive  bidders  are"
"entirely,  consistent with  the  method,  terms and  conditions disclosed  in  the"
"Clauses 10.7.2, 10.7.3, 10.7.5 (a),(d) and (e) the Bidding Document (X6) and"
"as  required  by  Clauses  7.9.1  (a)  and  (b)  of  the  Government  Procurement"
"Guidelines  (X11)  and  as  such  the  fact  that,  the  evaluation  process  was"
"conducted by the TEC by way of an “on-site” visit of office premises of all five"
"substantially 
responsive  bidders,  does  not
