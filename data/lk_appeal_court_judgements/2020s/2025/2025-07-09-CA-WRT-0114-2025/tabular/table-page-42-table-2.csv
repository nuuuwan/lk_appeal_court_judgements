"of necessary parties;"
"1.  The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for"
"a writ of certiorari is that the person or authority whose decision"
"or  exercise  of  power  is  sought  to  be  quashed  should  be  made  a"
"respondent to the application. If the act sought to be impugned had"
"been done by one party on a direction given by another party who has"
"power granted by law to give such direction, the party who had given"
"the direction is also a necessary party and the failure to make such"
"party  a  respondent  is  fatal  to  the  validity  of  the  application."
