"In the circumstances, the pivotal question that arose before the High Court for"
"its adjudication was as to whether or not a writ a Mandamus should be issued"
"as  prayed  for  by  the  Petitioner  compelling  the  1st  respondent  to  demolish  the"
"parapet wall admittedly, constructed by the 2nd Respondent on the said right of"
"way  (lot  13  of  the  said  plan-fm3)  and  not  the  question  whether  or  not  the  2nd"
"Respondent had acquired prescriptive title to the said right of way (lot 13 of the"
"for; 
it 
is  a  matter 
to  be  adjudicated  upon  by  a  Court  of 
said  plan-fm3)"
"competent civil jurisdiction and not a matter to be adjudicated upon by a High"
"Court in the matter of an application for  a writ of Mandamus."
"I would therefore, find myself unable to agree with the contention advanced by"
"both  the  1st  Respondent  as  well  as  the  2nd  Respondent  in  appeal  that,  it  is  a"
"matter  to  be  adjudicated  upon  by  a  Court  of  competent  civil  jurisdiction  and"
"not  a  matter  to  be  adjudicated  upon  by  a  High  Court  in  the  matter  of  an"
"application for a writ of Mandamus and therefore, the action of the Petitioner is"
"misconceived  in  law  and  therefore,  it  should  have  been  dismissed  in-limine by"
"the  High  Court.  Hence,  it  should  be  rejected  in-limine  for;  it  cannot  sustain"
"both in fact and in law."
"It  was  the  uncontroverted  and  unchallenged  findings  the  learned  Provincial"
"High  Court  Judge  of  the  Western  Province  sitting  in  Gampaha  that  the  said"
"parapet  wall  was  an  unauthorized  construction  admittedly,  built  by  the  2nd"
"Respondent without any lawful authority granted to him by the 1st Respondent"
"or  otherwise  and  therefore,  in  total  contravention  of  the  laws  and  regulations"
"prevalent in this regard."
"Nature  of  an  unauthorized  construction 
is  of 
its  perpetuity  until, 
it 
is"
"demolished by a competent authority vested with the power of demolition of the"
"same.  Hence,  an  unauthorized  construction  has  a  state  or  quality  of  lasting"
"forever until, it is demolished by a competent authority, and therefore, a cause"
