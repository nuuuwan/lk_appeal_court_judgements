"Court  of  Appeal  would  have  the  benefit  of  the  recorded  evidence  which  has"
"been subjected to cross examination and the benefit of the findings of the judge"

"serving  and  convenient  averments  in  the  affidavits  to  contradict  and  vary  the"
"record or to purge a default committed before the Court of first instance. In the"
"courts  of  first  instance  I  have  respectfully  followed  such  prudent  observations"
"made  by  judges  with  considerable  experience  in  the  actual  working  of  the"
"Magistrate and of the District Courts. In the circumstances this Court refuses"
"to  take  into  consideration  the  self-serving  and  convenient  oral  assertions  on"
"the facts made by the learned counsel for the Appellant for the first time at the"
"hearing  of  this  appeal.  These  matters  ought  to  have  been  placed  before  the"
"inquiring Officer to enable him to conduct a proper investigation or inquiry into"
"the matters which are now sought to be adduced for the first time in appeal.”"

"that it is not open to a petitioner to file a convenient and self-serving affidavit"
"for  the  first  time  before  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  thereby  seek  to  contradict  a"
"judicial or a quasi-judicial record and that if a litigant wishes to contradict the"
"record, he ought to file the necessary papers before the court or tribunal of first"

instance  and 
thereafter 
raise

it  to  make  an  appropriate"
