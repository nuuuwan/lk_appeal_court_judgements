"(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,"
"“Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect"
"the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that"
"the Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency"
"or  contradiction  and  whether  they  are  material  to  the  facts  in  issue."
"Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the"
"basic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance."
"Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies"
"and  omissions.  When  contradictions  are  marked,  the  Judge  should"
"direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness"
"should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter.”"
