"h) 
Issue an interim order directing the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents or their successors to"
"immediately appoint the Petitioner as a Drama and Theatre teacher with effect from"
"the date of approval in ‘P29’."
"13. The Petitioner does not dispute the fact that he was overage for the post of a teacher of Drama"
"and Theatre when he faced the interview on 22nd November 2016, or the fact that it was this"
"reason  that  prevented  his  recruitment.  The  Petitioner's  perception  that  an  injustice  was"
"caused to him stems from;"
"I. 
The  delay 
in  the  degree  program,  which  extended  to  seven  years  despite  being"
"structured as a four-year course"
"II. 
The absence of any recruitment for the said post until two years after his graduation"
"14. It is the Petitioner's contention that if the degree program had been concluded in a timely"
"manner and the recruitments had been made expeditiously, he would have been significantly"
"younger at the point of recruitment. As such, the inaction of the 1st and 2nd Respondents to"
"remedy this situation is extremely unfair, discriminatory and prejudicial."
"15. The  above  contention  cannot  be  sustained.  The  argument 
is  based  upon  a  speculative"
"assumption that no unforeseeable circumstances would arise to delay the academic program"
"and that the recruitment process would follow immediately upon graduation. To base one’s"
"career prospects on such uncertainties, and on matters beyond one's direct control, is neither"
"reasonable nor rational. Furthermore, had the Petitioner acquired the requisite qualifications"
"at an earlier stage, rather than waiting until the age of 27, the present grievance might not"
"have arisen."
"16. The  Petitioner  had  not  established  that  there  was  any  involvement  of  the  Respondents"
"regarding his decision to apply for a SLTS post or the subsequent delays in the degree program."
"The  petitioner  has  not  even  established  that  the  respondents  deliberately  or  negligently"
"delayed the recruitment process, although there were vacancies. The only grievance of the"
"Petitioner  appears  to  be  being  rejected  without  being  given  special  consideration  by  the"
"Respondents, disregarding the rules of eligibility. Clearly, at this stage, the Petitioner had no"
"legal right to demand that he be appointed, and the Respondents had no legal obligation to"
"appoint him in contravention of the recruitment criteria."
"17. It is the letter marked P28 written by the 2nd Respondent requesting the PSC to approve the"
"recruitment of the Petitioner to the relevant post on the grounds that an injustice has been"
"caused to him, that has given weight to the Petitioner's claim."
