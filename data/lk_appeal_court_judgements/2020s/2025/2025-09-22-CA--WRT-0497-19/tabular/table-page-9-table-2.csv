"15. Thus, the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary does not have any power"
"to  cancel  a  grant  in  the  guise  of  cancelling  the  registration  of  the"
"succession.  Accordingly,  I  hold  that  the  cancellation  effected  by  the"
"subsequent  registration,  as  depicted  in  P-4,  the  entry  by  which  the"
"registration of the ownership of the petitioner is purported to have been"
"cancelled and entered by the Registrar on 30.09.2004, is null and void."
"Further, I find that the consequential entry by which the 5th respondent"
"R. M. D. Piyasena, has been registered as the succeeding owner, entered"
"by the Registrar of Lands on 04.03.2005, is also without jurisdiction and"
"therefore ultra vires and void."
