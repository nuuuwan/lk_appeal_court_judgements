"thereof, such nominee acquires the status of the owner of the holding."
"The said owner of the holding will be in respect of the land alienated on"
"the  grant.  The  status  thus  amounts  to  that  of  a  grantee.  Upon  such"
"acquisition and the conferring of such status, such person will have all"
"the  attributes,  benefits,  entitlements,  and  protection  qua  owner.  That"
"being so, a cancellation of such registration or the reversal of the process"
"of registering the successor of a grant, in fact and in law, will amount to"
"a cancellation of such grant. By virtue of the provisions of Section 104"
"of the LDO, as the law was, and as well as after the amendment made"
"by Act No. 11 of 2022, the statutory power to cancel a grant is conferred"
"exclusively  upon  the  President  and  no  other.  Accordingly,  such  grant"
"cannot  be  cancelled  or  reversed  by  any  process  which  results  in  the"
"cancellation except in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII of"
"the  LDO,  by  the  President.  To  that  extent,  the  purported  decision"
"intimated by P-6 to reverse the process and to invalidate and cancel the"
"registration in P-4 is contrary to law, ultra vires, and is a nullity. This"
"decision  had  been  made  without  affording  a  hearing  to  the  petitioner"
"and in violation of the rules of natural justice. The decision clearly affects"
"the  proprietary  rights  and  interests  of  the  petitioner  and  causes  great"
"prejudice, depriving him of the property rights held by him."
