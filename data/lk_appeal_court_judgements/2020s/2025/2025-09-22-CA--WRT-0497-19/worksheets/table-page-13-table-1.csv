"and is a nullity, the delay would not defeat this application."
"Conclusion."
"20. The substantive relief sought by the petitioner in this application are by"
"prayers  (b)  and  (c).  Prayer  (b)  seeks  “a  writ  of  certiorari  to  quash  the"
"purported decision of the 1st and the 3rd respondents to transfer the said"
"high land in the name of the 5th respondent which is reflected in the extract"
"marked P-4.” As held above, the action by the 1st respondent to cancel"
"the  registration  of  the  succeeding  ownership  of  the  petitioner  is  ultra"
"vires and void ab initio."
"21. Accordingly,  writs  of  certiorari  are  issued  quashing  the  said  decision"
"and thereby quashing"
"- 
the entry appearing in folio 5/1/3/131 of the Register of Permits and"
"Grants made by the Registrar on 30.09.2004; and"
"- 
the entry appearing in folio 5/1/3/131 of the Register of Permits and"
"Grants made by the Registrar on 04.03.2005 (both depicted in P-4)."
"22. Now  to  consider  the  relief  prayed  for  by  prayer  (c).  The  petitioner  is"
"seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to hold an inquiry"
"in  terms  of  the  LDO  and  the  regulations.  P-8  confirms  that  upon  the"
"filing of this application, an inquiry was held as directed by this Court."
"The  report  P-8  is  the  outcome  of  the  said  inquiry.  Accordingly,  the"
"consideration of relief as per prayer (c) is now not required."
"23. In consequence of the writs so issued, the 1st respondent is directed to"
"take  necessary  steps  to  have  the  said  quashing  given  effect  to  and"
"registered, and the Register be rectified by making a suitable application"
"to the Registrar of Lands."
