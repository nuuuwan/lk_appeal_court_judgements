JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'the Accused'), was indicted before the

High Court of Kandy on two counts of Rape and one count of Grave Sexual Abuse on a

date between a time period of 01.01.2018 and 06.12.2018 to one Saumya Madushani

Jayathunga punishable under Section 364 A (3) and Section 365B (2)(b) of the Penal Code

as amended by Act no. 22 of 1995.

At the trial, the prosecution led evidence through 4 witnesses and marking productions

P1-P3, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in his defence, gave evidence in the

witness box and called one witness.

After the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by a judgment dated

23.01.2024, found the accused guilty on all three counts. Accordingly, for the first count

and second count, the Learned High Court judge imposed 20 years of rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 15,000/-, with a default sentence of 6 months rigorous

imprisonment and sentences to be run concurrently. For the 3rd count, 10 years of rigorous

imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 15,000, with a default sentence of 2 months simple

imprisonment. Furthermore, a compensation in sum of Rs. 1 million carries in default

term of 02 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused has

preferred this appeal to this Court. The following grounds for appeal were set out in the

written submission.

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the fact that the Appellant

had neither any opportunity nor any access to the Victim (PW 01) in committing

the alleged offences during the said time period specified in the indictment;

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the material inter-se

contradictions between the Prosecution Witnesses, which significantly affects the

credibility, consistency and probability of the Prosecution Version;

3. The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by failing to consider that PW 01

(Victim) was neither Cogent nor Credible, and that her testimony, in the absence

of material corroboration, ought not to have been acted upon;

4. The learned High Court Judge erred in failing to consider that there was no

substantive evidence on record to support the 02nd and the 03rd counts mentioned

in the indictment;

5. The conviction on the 01 Count mentioned in the indictment is bad in law, as the

Appellant was deprived of effective legal representation during the trial, thereby

violating the Appellants right to a fair trial;

6. The learned High Court Judge has failed to expressly reject or properly address

the version of the defence, and the judgement is not in compliance with the

requirements of Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act;

7. The investigation into the alleged offences was neither fair nor impartial, thereby

violating the Appellant's right to a fair investigation, as guaranteed under

the Constitution;

Page 4 of 9

8. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to draw an inference in

favour of the Appellant under Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance, due to the

Prosecution's failure to call material witnesses to give evidence;

9. The Appellant has been deprived of a Fair Trial as envisaged under Article 13(3)

of the Constitution;

During the argument stage, Learned Additional Solicitor General Deleepa Peries PC has

informed the court that he is not supporting the conviction of the 2nd and 3rd counts on the

basis that the prosecution has failed to call material witnesses to prove both counts.

Therefore, this court has to consider whether the prosecution has proved 1st charge

against the Accused. It is pertinent to refer to the 1st count of the indictment,

“වර්ෂ 2018 ක් වූ ජනවාරි මස 1 වන දින සහ වර්ෂ 2018 ක් වූ දෙසැම්බර් මස

The facts of this case and the background to the incident may be set out briefly as follows;

According to the testimony of PW 01, Saumya Madushani Jayathunga, the victim who is

the niece of the Accused—was 14 years old when she gave her evidence. At the time

relevant to the case, she and her brother were living at their grandmother’s residence,

while their parents stayed at ‘Uda Gedara’ due to limited space. The grandmother’s home

was also shared by her sister, the victim’s paternal uncle and his wife, and the Accused,

who is the younger brother of the victim’s father. During the period of the alleged incident,

the victim was a Grade 5 student.

Page 5 of 9

According to the testimony of PW 01, on the day of the incident, she was sleeping alongside

her grandmother’s sister. In the morning, while the grandmother’s sister had gone to

prepare the Buddha Pooja, the accused entered the premises and sexually assaulted her.

It is relevant to reproduce that portion of her testimony.

උ : චුටි බාප්පාචූටි බාප්පා ඇග උඩ නැගලා දූෂණය කළා

Then the court has asked the following questions,

අධිකරණමයන්

During the examination, she has described how the sexual intercourse took place.

The witness stated that during the incident, she was positioned face down on the bed in

the room. She further testified that the accused engaged in non-consensual sexual

intercourse by penetrating her vaginally.

The witness further stated that she experienced pain when the accused inserted his male

organ into her vagina.

Page 88 of the brief,

ප්‍ර : චුටි බාප්පාමේ චු කරන එමකන් ත න්මේ චු කරන එකට ම ාකද්ද කමේ ?

When asked if she had any further trouble after this incident, she replied that she did not

remember and remained silent and did not answer. Next, she stated that two other

incidents had occurred. She also said that it was in the morning on the porch of her

grandmother's house that the Accused had inserted his finger into the witness’s vagina.

The witness testified that she told the grade 5 teacher about the incident and that the

principal informed the police in 2018. Then the police informed about this incident to the

witness’s family.

During the cross-examination, when questioned by the defence about alleged physical

abuse by her stepmother, she responded by denying it. When the witness was questioned

regarding a dispute that arose between the Accused and the PW 02 regarding plucking

tea leaves in the accused’s land, the witness indicated that she was unaware of such an

incident. She further stated that this incident was reported to the witness’s school teacher,

called Kamani. PW 1 rejected the defence’s suggestion that any incident had occurred at

her Uda Gedara, and the witness denied it. The defence suggested that she should have

informed about this incident in the first place to PW 02 and the witness has remained

silent. PW 01 denied the proposition that the Accused had not committed rape against

her, and that it had been committed by someone else.

Upon analysis of the evidence, it was evident that the witness remained resolute in her

assertion that the incident occurred at her grandmother’s residence. It is acknowledged

that her testimony was provided four years after the event, and that many of the questions

Page 7 of 9

posed by the defence were unrelated to the core incident. Evaluating her testimony in its

entirety, she maintained consistency throughout, and the defence did not highlight any

contradictions in her account. The primary defence advanced by the accused was that the

allegation was a fabrication by PW 2, stemming from an ongoing land dispute.

According to the testimony of PW 06, Judicial Medical Officer Dr Danushka Thilina

Bandara, he examined PW 01 on 07.12.2018. Upon examination, the witness observed

medical evidence consistent with chronic anal penetration and signs of repeated vaginal

penetration. He noted positive anal dilation and confirmed that the clinical findings

aligned with the brief history given by the witness. He further opined that PW 01 had

been subjected to sexual abuse on multiple occasions over an extended period. This

medical evidence supported the evidence of the prosecutrix about the penetration.

During her testimony, PW 2, Edirisinghe Gedara Leelawathi, who is the stepmother of

PW 1, stated that she could not recall the exact month in which the incident occurred. She

recounted that, on one occasion, while walking toward the kitchen, she observed the

Accused placing his genitalia between the legs of the witness. She confronted the Accused

about the incident and subsequently informed family members; however, her disclosure

was met with indifference

During cross-examination, the witness firmly denied any hostility toward the Accused

and rejected the defence's allegation that she had verbally abused PW 01. She affirmed

that she witnessed the incident on 22 August 2015. In 2018, she received a letter from the

police requesting her presence at the station, where she was informed that PW 01 had

allegedly been abused by the Accused. The complaint had been filed by the witness’s

school principal. However, she noted that the police did not proceed with further

investigations or summon the PW 01 for inquiry. Approximately a week later, the victim

complained of nausea and dizziness, prompting the witness to take her to the hospital.

She categorically denied having any relationship with the victim’s school principal or

having influenced him to file a false complaint against the Accused.

According to the accused, a dispute had arisen with PW2 over the alleged plucking of tea

leaves from his land. He further claimed that, on one occasion, PW2 attempted to poison

him. It is noted that the defence did not cross-examine the relevant witness on these

assertions. Additionally, it was alleged that PW2 assaulted PW1. The accused also stated

that his statement to the police was obtained under duress, with officers allegedly

pointing a firearm at his head during the process

Page 8 of 9

The defence witness, P.G. Agalin, mother of the accused, testified that the dispute

originated when PW2 allegedly entered the accused’s land and plucked tea leaves. She

further stated that, on the day in question, PW2 shouted without any valid provocation

and accused PW2 of stealing from the accused’s residence. It is noted that the defence did

not question this aspect during the cross-examination of PW 02.

We are mindful of the observation made by Justice Takar J in Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V.

State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753, which held that;

“By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo graphic memory

and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the

mental screen. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time plan. A

witness is liable to get or mixed up when interrogated later on”.

Therefore, it cannot be reasonably expected from a person in the prosecutrix's

circumstances to recall the horrendous turn of events she experienced as a child with

absolute precision. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for a victim of an unfortunate event

to feel diminished and remain silent rather than be vocal about it. It is also noted that the

victim was 10 years old at the time of the incident and 14 years old when she gave her

testimony.

Further, we note that although there was a fight between the accused and PW 2, the

incident was reported to the police by the school principal, based on the victim’s disclosure

to the school teacher. Therefore, we observe that PW 2 is not deliberately providing

evidence to implicate the accused for this offence.

We note that the prosecution failed to call material witnesses in support of the second and

third counts, failing to establish both counts beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the

conviction and sentence on 2nd and 3rd counts are set aside. In my considered opinion, the

prosecution has proved the 1st count beyond a reasonable doubt.

For the foregoing reasons, I find no justification to interfere with the sentence imposed by

the Learned High Court Judge on the first count—namely, 20 years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 15,000/-, with a default sentence of six months' rigorous

imprisonment and the compensation in sum of Rs. 1 million carries in default term of 02

years rigorous imprisonment.
