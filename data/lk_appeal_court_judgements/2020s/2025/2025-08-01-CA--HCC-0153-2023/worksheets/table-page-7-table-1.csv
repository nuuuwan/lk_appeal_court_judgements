"26. In Walimunige John vs The State 76 NLR 488, it was held inter alia that:"
"The  question  of  a  presumption  arises  only  where  a  witness  whose  evidence  is"
"necessary to unfold the narrative is withheld by the ' prosecution and the failure"
"to call such witness constitutes a vital missing link in the prosecution case and"
"where the reasonable inference to be drawn from the omission to call the witness"
"is that he would, if called, not have supported the prosecution. But where one"
"witness's evidence is cumulative of the other and would be a mere repetition of"
"the narrative, it would  be wrong to  direct  a jury that the failure to  call such"
"witness  gives  rise  to  a  presumption  under  section  114  (f)  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance."""
