"5.","I shall first consider the second ground of appeal, namely whether the learned High"
"","Court Judge failed to apply the test of probability and to evaluate the evidence of PW1"
"","in a judicial manner perspective."
"6.","According to the prosecution, the appellant, a pastor, routinely visited the children's"
"","home for inspections and had a practice of meeting children in a room. The procedure"
"","involved calling two children at a time. When the victim was called by the pastor, she"
"","entered the room accompanied by one Ruby another inmate of the home, whereupon"
"","she was sexually abused by the appellant."
"7.","In her testimony, PW1 described the incident and stated that the appellant committed"
"","the  alleged  offence  while  another  inmate,  namely  Ruby,  was  present  in  the  same"
"","room. According to her evidence, the appellant first asked her to remove her brassiere,"
"","but she refused. Thereafter, the appellant forcibly removed her brassiere and sucked"
"","her  breasts.  He  then  removed  her  dress  and  inserted  his  finger  into  her  vagina."
"","Following  this,  the  victim  ran  out  of  the  room  and  reported  the  incident  to  Mary"
"","(PW7), who told her to go to her (Maryâ€™s) room, lock the door, and sleep. PW1 further"
"","stated that Mary instructed her not to tell anyone about the incident."
"8.","It is interesting to note that when PW1 entered the room, no one else was present, and"
"","it was  the appellant  who asked PW1 to  bring another inmate into the room. If the"
"","appellant  had  intended  to  sexually  abuse  PW1,  why  would  he  ask  PW1  to  bring"
"","someone else? Would it not have been easier for him to commit the alleged act when"
"","he was alone with PW1, rather than asking the victim to bring another child?"
"9.","It's also in evidence that the room door was remained open during the alleged sexual"
"","abuse by the appellant, which casts further doubt on the victim's version of events."
"","The  prosecution's  detailed  account,  wherein 
the  appellant  summoned 
two  girls"
"","concurrently, requested the victim to  bring an additional  girl  to the location of the"
"","alleged offense, then proceeded to remove the victim's clothing and sexually abuse"
"","her in the presence of the other girl, all while the room entrance door remained ajar,"
"","presents  a  composite  scenario  of  extreme  unlikelihood, 
rendering 
it  excitedly"
"","difficult, if not impossible, to accept as credible."
