"shall be recorded in form of question and answer. Such record shall be shown"
"or read to such person or if he does not understand the language in which it is"
"written, it shall be interpreted to him in a language he understands and he shall"
"be at liberty to explain or add to his statement."
"16. The above section is clear and unambiguous. Once a statement is recorded, it must be"
"shown  or  read  to  the  person  who  made  it.  If  the  person  does  not  understand  the"
"language in which the statement is written, it must be translated into a language he"
"understands. Furthermore, the individual must be given the opportunity to clarify or"
"supplement the statement."
"17. In the instant case, the testimony of the defense witness, Ruby, was recorded in the"
"High  Court  with  the  assistance  of  a  Tamil/Sinhala  interpreter,  indicating  that  the"
"witness  is  not  conversant  in  Sinhala.  However,  her  statement  to  the  police  was"
"recorded in Sinhala. In her evidence, the witness clearly stated that although she can"
"speak Sinhala, she cannot read or write in the language. In such circumstances, the"
"authorities should have provided a Tamil/Sinhala interpreter to assist her. Regrettably,"
"the officers of the National Child Protection Authority—the main body established to"
"safeguard the rights of children—paid little or no attention to this vital requirement"
"and showed a concerning lack of diligence when recording Ruby’s statement."
"18. Clearly, this amounts to a blatant violation of Section 110(1) of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure Act No. 10 of 1979, as well as a denial of the witness’s constitutional rights."
"19. It is noteworthy that the learned High Court Judge applied the presumption contained"
"in illustration (d) of Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance and presumed that the"
"recording of Ruby’s statement was properly done. Consequently, the Judge concluded"
"that the failure to provide a Tamil/Sinhala interpreter did not affect the validity of her"
"statement.  However,  I  respectfully  disagree  with  this  conclusion  for  the  following"
"reasons."
"20. The requirement to provide an interpreter exists to safeguard the rights guaranteed"
"under the Constitution. Admittedly, the witness in question was a 12-year-old Tamil-"
"speaking girl at the time her statement was recorded. It is evident that the statement"
"was recorded by an officer who was not conversant in Tamil, and no evidence was"
"led to show that an interpreter was present during the recording. Therefore, it was not"
