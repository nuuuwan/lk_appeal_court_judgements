"of Gampaha is stayed for six weeks from today.”"
"In  the  circumstances;  for  the  reasons  adumbrated  above,  it  is  my  view  that  this  Court  should"
"grant reliefs, partly  as prayed for in prayer (a) of the Petition dated 18th October 2018, without"
"any costs; and we grant relief accordingly."
"Further, judgement of this Appeal should not affect the employees or any statutory authorities in"
