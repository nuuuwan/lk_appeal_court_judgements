"sheet; therefore, he argued that the 1st Respondent could not have instituted proceedings before"
"the Magistrate’s Court of Gampaha by merely filing a charge sheet which  is at page 487 of the"
"brief."
"In addition to that Mr. Fernando P.C. having drawn the attention of the Court to different dates of"
"proceedings, argued  that  the entire proceedings that took place before the learned Magistrate is"
"flawed. Thus, the order made by the learned Magistrate dated 25th November 2011 is erroneous."
"As  such,  the  learned  President  Counsel  contended  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  having"
"accepted the position of the Appellant, held that he  was only liable to pay Rs. 10,680,611 (Ten"
"million six hundred eighty thousand six hundred and eleven) and erred in dismissing application"
"bearing number PHC/GAMPAHA 12/13."
"Therefore, he submitted that as one part of the said order was  favourable  to the Appellant, and"
"the other part of the order, which is unfavourable to him, should be set aside."
"However, Mr. Silva S.D.S.G. on the other hand, argued that if this Appeal is allowed, the rights"
"of  the  employees  who  had  been  retrenched,  and  had  lost  their  employment  would  be  affected"
"adversely  and  the  1st  Respondent  would  not  be  able  to  make  orders  under  any  other  statutory"
"provision."
"Mr.  Silva  further  argued  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  justified  in  dismissing  the"
"application  since  the  learned  Magistrate’s  Court’s  proceedings  had  not  been  concluded  and  is"
"still alive. As in such circumstances, the relief sought by the Appellant can still be sought in the"
"Magistrate’s Court."
"Learned President’s Counsel Mr. Fernando submitted that he is satisfied if the erroneous part of"
"the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 08th October 2018 is set aside in the impugned"
"order of the learned Magistrate dated 25th November 2011."
