"Before  dealing  with  the  legality  or  illegality  of  the  impugned  order  of  the  learned  High  Court"
"judge dated 08th October 2018, this Court wishes to advert to the facts that led to the application"
"to revise the order of the learned Magistrate dated 25th November 2011."
"Common ground"
"It  is  common  ground  that  the  Appellant  had  been  running  a  garment  factory  in  the  District  of"
"Gampaha,  having  employed  a  number  of  employees.  It  is  also  common  ground  that  the  said"
"garment factory was closed in 1990 resulting in retrenchment of all  its employees; thus,  losing"
"their  employment.  It  is  also  conceeded  that  the  1st  Respondent  as  the  Commissioner  of  Labour"
"had  initiated  proceedings  in  terms  of  Sections  7  and  8  of  the  Termination  of  Employment"
"Workmen (Special Provision) Act, No. 45 of 1971 (as amended)."
"The Magistrate Courtâ€™s proceedings"
"It must also be noted that, except for the said charge sheet other than the list of witnesses, which"
"is also a part of the said charge sheet annexed to the same; neither any notice of any order of the"
"1st Respondent nor any certificate reflecting any order or certificate has been filed along with the"
"said charge sheet, in terms of Sections 6, 7 or 8 of the Termination of Employment of Workmen"
"(Special Provision) Act No. 45 of 1971. Therefore, it is not clear how the Commissioner arrived"
"at  the  decision  to  order  the  payment  of  back  wages;  or  whether  he,  in  fact,  inquired  into  the"
"matter;  or  whether  in  fact  he  had  made  any  order  or  sent  any  notice  thereof  to  the  parties,  as"
"required by Section 6 of the Termination of Employment of  Workmen (Special Provision) Act,"
"No. 45 of 1971. Therefore, as argued by Mr. Fernando, the very institution of the proceedings is"
"flawed. Now, for the purpose of the record, I wish to reproduce the Section 6 of the Termination"
"of Employment of Workmen (Special Provision) Act, No. 45 of 1971."
