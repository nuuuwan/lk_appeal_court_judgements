  "keywords": "Two Ayurveda doctors attached to the Department of Ayurveda challenged the appointment of the 12th Respondent - When the former Provincial Director retired, applications were called for to fill up the vacancy; however, the applications and interviews were cancelled due to technical difficulties. For the interim, the 12th Respondent was appointed to cover-up the appointment of the Provincial Director. Held \u2013 there is a slight difference between a \u2018cover-up appointment\u2019 and \u2018acting appointment\u2019; a covering up appointment is only until a new person is appointed. Thus, no writ lies",
