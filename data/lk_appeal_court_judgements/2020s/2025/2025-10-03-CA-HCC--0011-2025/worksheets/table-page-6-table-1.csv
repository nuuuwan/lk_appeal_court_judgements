"together with PW11 had committed the murder without any evidence. (vide"
"pages 658 and 660 of the brief)."
"The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the Learned Trial Judge"
"misdirected himself by concluding that the Appellant along with the principal"
"witness as an accomplice committed the murder of the deceased  and that"
"PW11’s testimony consisted of visible improbabilities."
"In the evidence provided by PW11, she had been raped by the deceased just"
"before he died at the Appellant’s house while the room door had been kept"
"open. It was the position of   PW11 that the deceased had met the Appellant"
"at the house. It was highly doubtful whether the deceased would have raped"
"PW11 in an open room in the house of the Appellant. This position clearly"
"supports the stand taken by the Appellant that he was not at home when the"
"incident had taken place."
"According to PW11, she too had consumed the tea which had made both of"
"them feel faintish. But in her evidence, she had said that after drinking tea"
"both had had some rice and the Appellant had smoked a Cannabis cigar. As"
"correctly contended, it is highly improbable to believe that PW11 was moving"
"and observing the events that had taken place after she felt faintish."
"The Learned High Court Judge, after considering the evidence given by PW11"
"and PW2, had accurately held that that their evidence is untrustworthy and"
"cannot be believed completely. The relevant portion is re-produced below:"
"Page 641 of the brief."
