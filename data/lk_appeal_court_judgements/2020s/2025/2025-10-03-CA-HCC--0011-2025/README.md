JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the murder

of Jagodage Indika Rangajeeva on 18/06/2010 which is an offence

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the Appellant

guilty as charged and had sentenced him to death on 20/11/2024.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence. However, at

the time of argument, as the Appellant was receiving treatment at the Prison

Hospital, he was not connected via Zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge arrived at an erroneous conclusion that

the Appellant with PW11 had committed the murder without any

evidence. (vide pages 658 and 660 of the brief).

2. Consideration of the evidence led under Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance regarding the recovery of the dead body is wrong in law.

3. The defence had been rejected on unreasonable grounds.

CA/HCC/0011/25

4 | P a g e

In this case, PW11, Jagodage Chaturika was arrested along with the

Appellant. After a non-summary inquiry, on 09/01/2012, the Learned

Magistrate of Embilipitiya had committed the case against the Appellant and

PW11 to the High Court.

The Hon. Attorney General acting under Section 401 and the power vested

on him under Section 396 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979 and by his letter dated 18/05/2015, had quashed the committal

against PW11 and had named her as PW11 in the indictment.

Background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW11, Deepani, the deceased is her maternal uncle and he had

raped her when she was 10 years old. No complaint had been lodged at that

time due to the familial bond that existed and due to the threats advanced

by the deceased. As such, the deceased had continued to rape her till his

death. The deceased had had a land dispute with PW11’s parents and her

father had disappeared in the year of 2006. Following his disappearance,

when she attempted to lodge a complaint with the police, the deceased had

threatened her stating that he killed her father and the same fate would be

fallen on her as well should she proceed to go to the Police.

This witness had had a close relationship with the daughter of the Appellant.

As such, she had been a frequent visitor at the Appellant’s house and she

said that she knew where the key to the Appellant’s house was kept when

the family left the house.

As she could not bear the sexual assault perpetrated by the deceased on her,

she had sought help from the Appellant. Upon the instructions of the

Appellant, PW11 had called the deceased to the Appellant’s house on that

fateful day so that the Appellant may advice the deceased. When the

deceased arrived, the Appellant was at home. After the arrival of the

deceased, PW11 had made tea for them. After drinking tea, both the deceased

CA/HCC/0011/25

5 | P a g e

and PW11 had felt faintish. When she was leaving the house, she had heard

the deceased shouting and pleading not to assault him. After about 10

minutes, when she re-entered the Appellant’s house, she had seen the

deceased’s body lying on the floor. Thereafter, she had requested the

Appellant to drop her at the bus stand.

After about five days of the incident, she divulged this incident to her mother

who is PW2 in this case. Thereafter, PW2 had informed the incident to PW3,

the sister of the deceased. In the evidence of PW11, it is revealed that the

deceased and the Appellant’s were not in good terms. Importantly, the mobile

phone of the deceased was recovered from PW11 by the police.

In her evidence, PW1 had told police that she had come to know where the

dead body was buried from PW2 and PW11.

According to PW12, the JMO, who held the post mortem examination had

noted three injuries on the deceased’s body. One injury is compatible with

manual strangulation and the injury number two is compatible with an

injury caused by a blunt weapon. The JMO had opined that the death of the

deceased had been caused due to the application of pressure on the neck,

associated with gagging.

According to the investigating officer, the dead body, an axe and a motor bike

belonging to the deceased had been recovered upon the statement made by

the Appellant.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant gave evidence from the witness box. According to him, when he

was not at home, PW11 had called him to come home. When he came home

PW11 had told him “ wkak ?g lrkav ´ke jefâ wms l<d' talg lrk fohla lrkav'

udj .syska odkakhs lsõjd nia tlg”.

Under the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the learned

High Court Judge arrived at an erroneous conclusion that the Appellant

CA/HCC/0011/25

6 | P a g e

together with PW11 had committed the murder without any evidence. (vide

pages 658 and 660 of the brief).

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the Learned Trial Judge

misdirected himself by concluding that the Appellant along with the principal

witness as an accomplice committed the murder of the deceased and that

PW11’s testimony consisted of visible improbabilities.

In the evidence provided by PW11, she had been raped by the deceased just

before he died at the Appellant’s house while the room door had been kept

open. It was the position of PW11 that the deceased had met the Appellant

at the house. It was highly doubtful whether the deceased would have raped

PW11 in an open room in the house of the Appellant. This position clearly

supports the stand taken by the Appellant that he was not at home when the

incident had taken place.

According to PW11, she too had consumed the tea which had made both of

them feel faintish. But in her evidence, she had said that after drinking tea

both had had some rice and the Appellant had smoked a Cannabis cigar. As

correctly contended, it is highly improbable to believe that PW11 was moving

and observing the events that had taken place after she felt faintish.

The Learned High Court Judge, after considering the evidence given by PW11

and PW2, had accurately held that that their evidence is untrustworthy and

cannot be believed completely. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Later, the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 658-659 re-

assessing the evidence giving by PW11 and PW2, come to the conclusion that

PW11 is an accomplice in this case. The relevant portion is re-produced

According to Section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance an accomplice shall be

a competent witness against an accused person and a conviction is not illegal

merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an

accomplice.

According to Section 114 (b) of the Evidence Ordinance, accomplice is

unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars.

In the case of De Saram v. The Republic of Sri Lanka 2002 [1]SLR 296 the

Honorable Judge states that Section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance is an

absolute rule of evidence while Section 114 (b) is a rule of guidance.

Additionally, in the aforementioned case it is stated that in order to take a

witness in light of Section 114(b) and Section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance,

the court should first clarify whether the said witness can be considered as

an Accomplice.

In the case of King v. Peiris Appuhamy 43 NLR 412 it is was held that:

“Even assuming that after the murder had been committed the witness

had assisted in removing the body to the pit and that he could have been

charged with concealment of the body under S.198 of the Penal Code

that was an offence perfectly independent of the murder and the

witness could not rightly be held to be either a guilty associate with the

accused in the crime of murder or liable to be indicted with him jointly.

CA/HCC/0011/25

9 | P a g e

The witness was therefore not an accomplice and the rule of practice as

to be corroborated had no application to the case.”

Similarly, in Queen v E.H Ariyawantha 59 NLR 241 it was stated that,

“burden of proving a witness to be an accomplice for the purpose of

inducing jury to presume that he is unworthy of credit unless

corroborated in material particulars, is upon the party alleging it”.

According to E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in his book titled “The Law of

Evidence Vol. II, Book I at page 364, it is stated with approval the following

passage from Wharton on Criminal Evidence 11th Ed. Vol. II at page 1229 –

“An accomplice is a person who knowingly, voluntarily and with

common intent with the principal offender unites in the commission

of a crime. The term cannot be used in a loose or popular sense so as

to embrace one who has guilty knowledge or is morally delinquent or

who was an admitted participant in a related but distinct offence. To

constitute one an accomplice, he must perform some act or take some

part in the commission of the crime, or owe some duty to the person

in danger that makes it incumbent on him to prevent its commission.”

In this case as the Learned High Court Judge already held that PW11 is an

unreliable witness, her evidence needs to be corroborated in material

particulars. The Learned High Court Judge placed his reliance on the

evidence given by the investigating officer with regard to the recovery done

under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

From here onwards, the second ground of appeal also considered along with

the first ground of appeal. According to the evidence given by PW1, she had

gotten to know the place where the dead body was buried from PW11 and

PW2. Thereafter, PW1 had lodged the first complaint with the police.

Although, PW13, the investigating officer had given evidence that the dead

CA/HCC/0011/25

10 | P a g e

body was recovered upon the statement made by the Appellant, the fact had

already been known to the police via PW1’s statement.

The Learned High Court Judge had wrongly concluded that the recovery of

the dead body was made as a result of the statement made by the Appellant

and it is admissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

Page 648 of the brief.

Therefore, the only evidence available against the Appellant is the other

recoveries made upon the statement of the Appellant. According to the

investigating officer, a motor bike and documents belonging to the deceased

had been recovered upon the statement made by the Appellant.

In Heen Banda v. The Queen 75 NLR 54, the court held that:

“Where part of a statement of an accused person is put in evidence

under section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance, it is the duty of the Trial

Judge to explain to the Jury that such a statement is only evidence of

the fact that the accused knew where the article discovered could be

found, and nothing more.”

CA/HCC/0011/25

11 | P a g e

In Ranasinghe v. Attorney General (2007) 1 Sri L.R 218, it was held that:

“…discovery in consequence of a section 27 statement only leads to the

conclusion that the accused had the knowledge as to the weapon being

kept at the place from which it was detected.”

The Learned High Court Judge had arrived at the wrong conclusion that the

Appellant is guilty of the charge acting only under Section 27(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance.

Although, PW11 had stated that she did not have any intention to kill the

deceased, the contradictions marked from her police statement clearly show

that she had a very strong motive to do so. The relevant portions of PW11’s

evidence is re-produced below:

Further, PW11 had stated that her relations forced her to implicate the

Appellant to the crime. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Hence, her evidence is tainted with improbabilities and with visible

ambiguity. Therefore, acting on PW11’s evidence will certainly prejudice the

Appellant’s rights.

In this case, the Learned Trial Judge has initially disbelieved the evidence

given by PW11 and PW2 but later misdirected himself by placing total

reliability on the most unreliable witness PW11 who had displayed a

complete lack of creditworthiness especially when the defense counsel

proceeded to highlight several material contradictions.

The importance of contradictions in criminal trials has been discussed in

several judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our country. It is

pertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned contradictions have any

adverse effect on the evidence given by PW11 in this case.

CA/HCC/0011/25

14 | P a g e

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 it was held that,

“Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the

basic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance”.

Considering the totality of evidence provided by PW11 the contradictions

highlighted by the Counsel for the Appellant certainly go to the root of the

prosecution’s case. Further, PW11 had admitted that she implicated the

Appellant upon the instructions given by her relations.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

Judge misdirected himself while analysing the evidence by completely failing

to consider the defence evidence and thereby failed to afford substance of a

fair trial and adhere to established Legal principles when arriving at the

conclusion of convicting the Appellant. The Learned Counsel for the

Appellant argued that this has caused miscarriage of justice and thereby the

conviction is unsafe and bad in Law.

The Learned High Court Judge, although arriving at the conclusion that the

prosecution witnesses No.11 and No.02 are unreliable witnesses and should

be considered with great caution, had completely disregarded this

conclusion, and had admitted the evidence given by PW11 as reliable and

convicted the Appellant solely on that evidence. This has caused not only a

great prejudice but also denied a fair trial to the Appellant.

For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that there is merit in the

grounds of appeal urged by the counsel for the Appellant.

CA/HCC/0011/25

15 | P a g e

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Embilipitiya dated 20/11/2024 on the Appellant. Therefore,

he is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Embilipitiya along with the original case record.
