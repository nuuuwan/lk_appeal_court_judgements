"Sri  Lanka  Principals’  Services  published  in  the  Gazette  Extraordinary  No.  1885/31"
"dated  22.10.2014  marked  as  P9.  The  Petitioners  state  that  in  terms  of  P9,  teachers"
"belonging to the Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service who possess the requisite qualifications"
"and  have  been  duly  confirmed  in  the  service  are  eligible  to  sit  for  the  Limited"
"Competitive  Examination.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioners  submitted  their  applications"
"(P10(a) to P10(g)). After successfully passing the Limited Competitive Examination,"
"the Petitioners were called for general and structured interviews by the Secretary to the"
"Ministry of Education, the 2nd Respondent, by the letters marked as P11(a) to P11(f). In"
"terms  of  the  letters  calling  for  interviews,  only  those  officers  who  satisfy  the  basic"
"qualifications at the general interview are to be called for the structured interviews. The"
"Petitioners, having faced the general interview, were thereafter not permitted to appear"
"for the structured interview on the ground that Pirivena teachers do not belong to the"
"Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service and therefore they are not eligible to apply for the post."
"Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioners invoked the Writ jurisdiction of"
"this Court seeking the following substantive relief, inter alia,"
