"the letters marked as P3(a) to P7(g), the Petitioners have not provided any document to"
"establish that the Pirivena teachers have been absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers’"
"Service. In the absence of such clear evidence, it is the view of this Court that neither"
"the letter marked as P2 nor letters marked as P3(a) to P7(g) support the position that the"
"Petitioners were, in fact, absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service."
"Nevertheless, this Court will now proceed to consider whether the Petitioners fall within"

"this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners"
"argued that in terms of Section 2(b) of the Pirivena Education Act, No. 64 of 1979, the"
"objective is to provide educational facilities in a Buddhist environment. In addition to"
"the  general  qualifications  required  for  a  teacher,  Pirivena  teachers  must  possess  the"
"suitable  qualifications  necessary  to  provide  education  in  a  Buddhist  environment."
"Accordingly, the appointments of Pirivena teachers are made by the Secretary to the"
"Ministry of Education on the recommendation of the “Kruthyadhikari”, as evident from"
"the appointment letters marked as P1(a) to P1(d)."
"The argument of the learned DSG appearing for the Respondents is that the teachers"
"governed by the Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service marked R1, are"
"public  officers  who  discharge  the  functions  stipulated  in  Section  6.1  of  the  Service"
"Minutes marked as R1. In terms of Section 6.1 of R1, the duties of the teachers serve"
"in all grades are as follows,"
