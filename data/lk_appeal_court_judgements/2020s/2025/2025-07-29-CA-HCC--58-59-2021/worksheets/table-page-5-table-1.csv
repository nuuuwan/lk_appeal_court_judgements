the  court  should  be"
"established”."
"The Appellants take up the position that there is a significant discrepancy"
"between the weight of Heroin said to have been recovered from the Appellants"
"and the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for the Appellants contend"
"that  the  learned  Trial  Judge  misdirected  himself  by  failing  to  analyse  the"
"discrepancy  of  the  weight  of  the  substance  allegedly  recovered  from  the"
"Appellants  which  disturbs  the  production  chain.  He  further  submits  that"
"this  is  a  substantial  fact,  which  the  prosecution  has  to  prove  beyond  a"
"reasonable doubt."
"This ground of appeal directly relates to the evidence given by PW1 and PW4."
"According to PW1, the recovered substance was weighed at the Wattala Police"
"Station  in  front  of  the  Appellants.    According  to  both  PW1  and  PW4  the"
"substance  was  weighed  using  a  scale  obtained  from  the  police.  The  gross"
"aggregate weight of the substance was 16.100 grams."
"When the productions were taken to the Government Analyst Department, a"
"notable difference had been noted in the parcel. According to the Government"
"Analyst Report the weight of the parcel was mentioned as 8.64 grams. This"
"is 8.46 grams less than the original weight recorded by the police. Hence the"
"Appellant  argues  that  the  weight  difference  creates  a  serious  doubt  in  the"
"prosecution case as the weight difference is quite significant."
"When this Court invited the Respondent to explain the discrepancy regarding"
"the  weight  of  the  productions  which  transpired  from  the  evidence,  the"
"learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  following  the  best  traditions  and  highest"
"standard  of 
the  Attorney  General’s  Department  admitted 
the  weight"
"discrepancy  in  the  production  and  further  added  that  she  is  unable  to"
"explain the reason."
