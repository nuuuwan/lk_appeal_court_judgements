Q.N.1.

Q.N.2.

Q.N.3.

A3. In the case stated dated 19.05.2022 following questions

were raised for the opinion of the Court of Appeal:

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

purporting to hold that the Appellant Company is

receiving only 'commission' income, thus the

Appellant is not entitled to claim the exemption on

the income received by the Appellant as

'Transshipment Agency Fees', amounting to Rs.

102,708,711/- in terms of Section 13(ddd) of the

Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006?

Did the Tax Appeals Commission erred by observing

that in terms of the Front-Line Office Agreement

dated 01.02.1998, entered between APL CO. PTE

LTD and the Appellant, the Appellant only receives

a commission based income by referring only to

Articles 3 and 4 of the Front Line Agreement, and

fell into grave error by the non-consideration of

other Articles contained in the said Agreement,

especially, Article 6, read with the Schedule,

contained in the same?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

failing to duly appreciate that in terms of the

Front-Line Office Agreement dated 01.02. 1998,

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 4|33

entered between APL CO. PTE LTD and the

Appellant, the Appellant's income :-

a) Principally consists of (i.e., Commission on

Outward Freight, Commission on Inward

Freight, Transshipment Agency Fees, and

Commission etc., in terms of Article 3, 4 and 6

of the said Agreement;

b) what is important is the consideration for

transshipment service is paid as a fixed

monetary consideration for each container

transferred, as oppose to a set percentage of

the value involved, which is a variable figure

(i.e., different freight rate from different

country to country), which is the intrinsic

characteristic of a 'commission';

c) In terms of Article 6 of the said Front-Line

Office Agreement, read with Schedule I and II,

Transshipment Agency Fee is paid in terms of a

fixed monetary value per container transferred

as approved and published by the Ceylon

Association of Ships' Agent's, which clearly

establishes the fact that the transshipment

agency fee is a fixed fee per container and NOT

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 5|33

Q.N.4.

Q.N.5.

a commission on account of being calculated

by reference not to a percentage;

d) Thus, the income generated from

transshipment agency fee is a fixed monetary

consideration for each container transferred

and not a commission;

Given the specific facts and circumstances

enumerated in the immediately preceding question

of law, whether the Tax Appeals Commission fell

into grievous error by failing to appreciate that the

Appellant has duly satisfied all the conditions, as

expressly contemplated by Section 13(ddd) of the

Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006, and thereby, the

Appellant is accordingly, duly eligible to claim the

profits and income of Rs. 102,708,711, exempted

from tax under section 13(ddd) of the Act, as set

out in the return of income submitted for the year

of assessment 2013/2014?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission failed to

appreciate that;

a) The Appellant did not claim the exemption for

the transshipment Agency fee, in terms of

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 6|33

Q.N.6.

Section 13(ddd), in the year of Assessment

2012/2013, as the foreign currency was not

remitted back, via bank accounts which is an

indispensable criteria set out in Section

13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act in order to

become eligible to the exemption set out

therein;

b) In any event, having considered the fact that

the transshipment agency fee is a fixed

monetary consideration for each container

transferred and not a commission, it is

legitimate to recognize the same as a "fee" and

not as a "commission" in the year of

Assessment 2013/2014?

c) The intrinsic nature and characteristics of a

"commission" and opposed to the

"transshipment agency fees" payable, under

the Agreement, along with the nature of the

operations engaged by the Appellant;

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission grievously

erred in law, by failing to appreciate that the term

"fee" or "commission" is not defined in the Inland

Revenue Act No.10 of 2006, thus in terms of the

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 7|33

Q.N.7.

Q.N.8.

Q.N.9.

rules of interpretation of statute, where no

definition is provided, the ordinary dictionary

meaning should be used in the interpretation of

the term "Commission"?

Whether the tax appeal commission erred in law,

by misconstruing the Section 13(ddd) of the Inland

Revenue Act No 10 of 2006, as amended, by

overlooking the fact that the said section was

introduced with the specific objective of granting

/concessions, to business undertakings, in order to

encourage and/or boost, foreign currency income

earnings coming into the country?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission subverted

and/or distorted and/or altered and/or undermined

the plain meaning and effect of Section 13(ddd) of

the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006, and

PURPORTED TO GIVE A RIGID AND NARROW

INTERPRETATION/ WORDS/ TERMS INTO THE

SAME, thereby, wrongfully and/or unjustifiably

disentitled the Appellant from the benefit of the

aforesaid exemption?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission failed to

appreciate that, reference to the Appellant's

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 8|33

Q.N.10.

Q.N.11.

Q.N.12.

Company financial controller's letter dated on or

around 24.04.2015 which states as "the company

does not have sales invoice since Appellant is

receiving their income as commission income only"

cannot be construed as conclusive evidence that

the company receives only commission income,

without duly resorting to the terms and conditions

of the Front line Agreement and also examining

the true nature of the transaction and the method

of calculation of the said income?

In any event, strictly without prejudice to all of

foregoing, whether the Tax Appeals Commission

erred by failing to appreciate the ingredients in

section 13(ddd) of Act No.10 of 2006, as amended?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

purporting to hold that the Appellant Company is

an Associated Company and also a subsidiary

company of a group of companies, The Appellant is

not entitled to the concessionary rate of income

tax, set out in Section 59B of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006.

Did the Tax Appeals Commission fall into serious

error by concluding that the Appellant is a

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 9|33

Q.N.13.

Q.N.14.

subsidiary of APL CO. without considering the

express definitions contained in both Companies

Act No. 07 of 2007 and Inland Revenue Act No. 10

of 2006?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission failed to

appreciate that the terms 'holding company' and

'subsidiary company' as interpreted in Part B(d)(B)

of the Second Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act,

it states that "for the purpose of item (B) of

paragraph (b), paragraph (c) and paragraph (d), the

expressions "holding company", "subsidiary

company", and "group of companies" shall have the

same respective meanings which they have in the

Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and thus, include a

holding company or a subsidiary of any company

incorporated or registered outside Sri Lanka, and

according to the interpretation in both Companies

Act No. 07 of 2007 and Inland Revenue Act No. 10

of 2006, the Appellant company does not fall

under any category of holding company, a

subsidiary company, or an associate company of a

group of company?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

holding that the Appellant failed to prove with

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 10|33

Q.N.15.

Q.N.16.

Q.N.17.

relevant documentation, that the purported

undeclared income of Rs. 179, 693,387/- was a

reimbursement expense which does not clearly

falls within the definition of revenue?

Whether the Tax Appeal commission failed to

appreciate that the Agreement dated 1.08.2001,

entered into between APL Logistics Ltd and the

Appellant, clearly establishes the Inter Company

Operations expenses Re-imbursement, which read

in conjunction with the Bank statements justifies

the categorization of the said sum of Rs. 179,

693,387/-, as a reimbursement expenses and not a

revenue?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

departing from well-established norms of

interpretation, as postulated by judicial dicta,

when purporting to interpret the aforesaid fiscal

statute and the gazette in question?

If the aforesaid question of law is answered in the

affirmative, whether the Appellant is therefore,

duly entitled, to the exemption from income tax,

as provided for by Section 13(ddd) of the Inland

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 11|33

Q.N.18.

Revenue Act and also, whether the Appellant is

also entitled to the concessionary rate provided

for, under and in terms of Section 59B of the

Inland Revenue Act?

In the totality of the said legal and factual

positions enumerated and as will be more fully

detailed at the hearing of this case stated, the

Order of the Tax Appeals Commission dated

08/03/2022, cannot stand in law.

A4. In this appeal following matters are to be decided:

a) Whether the appellant is eligible to claim the profit and

income of Rs.102,708,711 as exempt for tax under Section

13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act no. 10 of 2006

(Hereinafter sometimes referred to as IRA)

b) Appellant Company is qualified to apply the rates of income

tax applicable to the profit and income as per the

appropriate rate specified in the fifth schedule in the Act

In this appeal, the Respondent, Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, entered appearance through Additional Solicitor General,

DEFAULT

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 24/2022 Page 12|33

N. Perera, on the 17th June 2022. But the Respondent failed to

submit appointment of Attorney-at-Law in writing, commonly

known as Proxy at that time or thereafter. Counsels from the

Attorney General’s Department appeared for the Respondent

throughout without the authority in writing. On 3rd June 2025,

both parties agreed to conclude the argument by written

submissions and thus argument concluded. When glanced the

record, it is found that the Appellant has furnished written

submissions dated 31.08.2023 but the Respondent hasn’t

furnished the written submissions. This judgment is drawn on the

available materials in the record.

C.

When glancing the brief, it is noted that in the determination of the

CGIR, the commissioner of the Inland Revenue N. T. A. Dissanayake

has determined that the above appeal by confirming the

assessment issued for the year of assessment 2012/2013. But

the appeal presented to the CGIR is in respect of the assessment

year 2013/ 2014. When one take the determination intoto, it can be

said that the year of assessment is 2013/2014. This court

concludes the said indication of the year in the determination is a

misnomer/ mistake.

(a) Should be profit and income.

(b) Should be in foreign currency.

(c) Should be a resident company.

(d) Service should be rendered in or outside Sri Lanka.

(e) Should be a person or partnership outside Sri Lanka.

and income other than commission discount or similar receipt.

Some of the income received by APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited are

transshipment agency fees, which can be considered as similar

receipts to commission. Therefore, that income as transshipment

agency fee can be excluded for tax exemptions.

D11. Department of Inland Revenue (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as IRD) sought clarification from the tax payer and call for

documentary materials to show that they have received

transshipment agency fees. The tax payer by the letter of the

financial controller of the APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited dated

24/04/2015 informed that they have no invoices as they are

receiving commission only.

D12. The tax payer has no documentary materials to show that

they have received different categories of profit and income other

than the commission. (This is at the Inland Revenue level)

Guillain Vs Commissioner of Income Tax 51 NLR 241

This case clearly states that the burden of proof of an

assesse to prove that the assessment is incorrect is on

the assesse. Section 140(5) of the Income Tax Act of 2000

states this clearly, the said case states that the assesse

“took grave responsibility in not producing (like this

instant Appellant) materials which would undoubtedly

have been of great value for the purpose of forming the

assessor’s opinion. In the circumstances the assessor was

not bound by the strict rules of evidence and was entitled

to make an assessment according to his judgment.”

Short of materials also press the Inland Revenue to decide

negatively.

Therefore, the conclusion that the tax payer is not entitled to

the tax exemption is correct.

D13. Questions of law No.11, 12, and 13 are all in respect of status

of the company, section 59 (B) of IRA. Therefore, all these questions

are taken together for analysis and the analysis as follows;

D13(a).

Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 reads as

follows;

59(B)(1) – The profits and income of any person (not being the

holding company, a subsidiary company, or an associate

company of a group of companies) for any year of assessment

in the fifth schedule to this Act.

(b) The turnover of such undertaking (other than

from the sale of any capital asset) for that year

April 1, 2011 but prior to April 1, 2013, does not

exceed three hundred million rupees;

(ii) being any year of assessment commencing on or after

April 1, 2013, does not exceed five hundred million

D13(b).

The companies Act as defined companies in several categories.

company’s holding company if an only other company is its

subsidiary.

I. controls the compositions of its board of directors

IV. Is entitle to receive more than half of every dividend paid on

shares issued by the company, other than shares that carry

no right to participate beyond the specified amount in a

distribution of profit or capital.

Associates Company is a company over which an investing

company has a significant influence and which neither a subsidiary

of the investing company no is a joint venture of which the investing

company is a partner.

D13(c).

The second point is that what is the status of the APL Lanka (Pvt)

Limited? It has been admitted that APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited has

declared that they own 40% of the APL Singapore. A company that

has significant interest is an associate company. In the financial

statements, APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited is identified as investor of APL

Logistics. The Appellant failed to produce material to show their

eligibility to claim appropriate rates.

Therefore, it is clear that the APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited is an

associates company and not entitled for appropriate rates

under section 59(B) of IRA.

D14. Questions of law 14, 15, 16, and 17 are all in respect of

undeclared income. Therefore, all these questions are taken

together for analysis and the analysis as follows;

The TAC has held that the tax payer has failed to declare certain

income amount to Rs. 179,693,387/-. The contention of the tax

payer is that those are operation expenses. But the position of the

TAC is that the tax payer failed to furnished materials to prove their

claim before the CGIR. Accordingly, the said amount has been

considered as undeclared income.

D15.
