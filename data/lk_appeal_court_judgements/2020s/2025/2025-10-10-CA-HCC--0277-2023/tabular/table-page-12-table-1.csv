"Taking all these circumstances into consideration, I am of the view that the"
"conviction  of  the  Appellant  cannot  be  allowed  to  stand  as  the  prosecution"
"had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, I"
"set  aside  the  conviction  and  sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge of Vavuniya dated 12th July 2023 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is"
"acquitted from this case."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Vavuniya along with the original case record."
