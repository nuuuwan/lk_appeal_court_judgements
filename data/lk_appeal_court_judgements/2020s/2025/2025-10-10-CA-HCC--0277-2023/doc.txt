JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Vavuniya under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for being in

possession of and for the trafficking of 1,135 grams of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) on the 09th of November 2017.

After the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the learned

High Court Judge of Vavuniya has sentenced him to death for each count on

12th of July 2023.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he has been connected via Zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. A raid was not conducted.

2. Improbability of the story presented by the Prosecution.

3. Chain of production had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case, the raid was conducted upon the receipt of specific information

by PW1. The raid was conducted by a team of police officers from the District

Police Narcotics Bureau, Vavuniya headed by PW1. All members of the team

had been named as witnesses in the indictment including the Government

Analyst. The prosecution had called PW1, PW2, PW3, PW4, PW5 and PW6,

the Government Analyst and closed the case. The prosecution had marked

productions P1 to 23 and X-1 during the trial.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a dock statement and

closed the case.

According to PW1, IP/Rajapaksha, when he was serving at the Vavuniya

Police Station, on 09th November 2017, he had received an information from

his personal informant that a person dressed in a white short-sleeve shirt

and grey colour trousers carrying a travelling bag branded “NIKE” at the

Vavuniya old bus stand is carrying Heroin. When he received this

information, he was engaged in crime prevention duty in the area under the

Vavuniya Police and had been travelling from Tekkawatte to Vavuniya in a

cab. Immediately after receiving this information, PW1 had alerted his

subordinate officers who were with him at that time. Within 10-15 minutes

he and the other police officers had arrived at the bus stand, arrested the

Appellant, and recovered a bag from him. From inside the bag, a parcel

suspected to be containing Heroin was recovered. Thereafter, he and his

team had gone to the Police Welfare Shop to weigh the production. The parcel

had weighed 2.266 Kilograms. The production was entered in the production

CA/HCC/0277/2023

4 | P a g e

register under PR No.2037/17 and had been handed over to the reserve

police officer.

PW2, SI/Abeyratne had given evidence to corroborate the evidence of PW1.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden

never shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his innocence

unless he pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

“…the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required

in a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree

is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree

of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof

beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the

community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of

justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a

remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the

sentence, “of course it is possible, but not in the least probable,” the case

is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice”.

As the first and second grounds of the appeal are interconnected, the said

grounds will be considered together in this appeal. Under the first ground of

appeal the Appellant contends that the learned High Court Judge erred in

law by failing to consider that both inter se and per se contradictions between

the evidence provided by PW1 and PW2 which creates a reasonable doubt

and thereby the conviction is unsafe and that under the second ground he

further contends that the learned Trial Judge has failed to analyse the

improbability of the prosecution version of the case and thereby the

conviction is unsafe.

According to PW1, the information which led to the raid was received while

he was engaging in crime prevention duty and was travelling from

Tekkawatte to Vavuniya. After receiving the information all officers had gone

to the bus stand for the raid. The relevant portion of the evidence is re-

produced below:

These inter se and per se contradictions are a clear demonstration that the

prosecution story is not reliable.

The above highlighted portions of evidence of PW1 and PW2 cannot be

considered as trivial contradictions. The inter se and per se contradictions

highlighted pose a strong challenge to the prosecution version. They certainly

attack the root of the matter in this case.

In the book Sarkar on Evidence, 15th Edition at page 112 states:

“Minor discrepancies are possible, even in the version of truthful

witnesses and such minor discrepancies only add to the truthfulness of

their evidence. [Sidhan v. State of Kerela [1986] Cri LJ 470,

473(Kerala)]. But discrepancies in the statements of witnesses on

material points should not be passed over, as they seriously affect the

value of their testimony (Brijlal v.Kunwar, 36A 187: 18CWN 649:

A1914PC38).The main thing to be seen in whether the inconsistencies

go to the root of the matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof. In

the former case, the defence may be justified in seeking advantage of the

incongruities obtaining in the evidence. In the latter, however, no such

CA/HCC/0277/2023

9 | P a g e

benefit will be available to it. (Krishna Pillai Sree Kumar v. State of

Kerala A [1981] SC 1237,1239).”

In The Attorney General v.Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

“Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are true material to the facts in issue”.

In all drug detection cases the police detectives are expected to maintain

impeccable records of all activities that which transpires concerning the

case. When they are called upon by the prosecution to testify in court, they

are allowed to use their notes to refresh their memory. Hence, their evidence

cannot consist of any inter se or per se contradictions as they give systematic

evidence regarding the particular incident as clearly recorded by themselves.

If their evidence consists of inter se or per se contradictions which affects the

root of the case, their credibility become questionable.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment held that the evidence given

by PW1 and PW2 does not contain any contradictions. This is a clear

indication that the learned High Court had not considered and analysed the

evidence given by PW1 and PW2 in a proper manner.

The probability test is a prerequisite in a criminal trial to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case the conduct of PW1 is highly

questionable which certainly does not pass the probability test.

In this case PW1and PW2 are the key witnesses who are also experienced

police officers. Their evidence is not clear and not matched on material points

as discussed above. Their evidence is tainted with such ambiguity and

CA/HCC/0277/2023

10 | P a g e

uncertainty which definitely affects the root of the case. Hence, the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

According to PW1, the substance found in the possession of the Appellant

was weighed using a scale used in the Police Welfare Shop. The parcel was

weighed at 2,266 grams at first. Secondly, he had weighed the same from the

Vavuniya Base Hospital. At that time the parcel had weighed about 2008

grams.

However, when the productions had been taken to the Government Analyst

Department a notable difference had been noted in the weight of the parcel.

According to the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as X1

in the High Court Trial, the weight of Heroin had been noted as 1,982 grams.

This is 284 grams less than the original weight. Hence the Appellant argues

that the weight difference could create a serious doubt in the prosecution

case.

It is noted that the Heroin parcel was in the personal custody of PW1 until it

reached the Government Analyst Department after it was entered in the PR

Register.

In Mahasarukkalige Chandani v. Attorney General CA/213/2009 decided

on 30/06/2016 His Lordship Justice Malalgoda held that:

“As observed by this court the inward journey of a production in a case

where the charges are mainly based on the identity and the quantity of

productions recovered from the custody of the suspect, the prosecution has

a responsibility to establish this aspect of the case without leaving any

gaps before the trial court. In this regard the seals said to have been placed

on the production at the time the production was handed over to the reserve

has a significance. The said seals have to be intact at every point of time

the custody is changed and finally it should be observed by the person

CA/HCC/0277/2023

11 | P a g e

who breaks such seals in order to commence his investigation. If it can be

established at least, that the said seals were observed by the receiving

officer and the removing officer who removed the production from the police

station as intact and by the Government Analyst that he observed the

same seal intact, when parcel was opened, that could have been

considered as sufficient for this court to conclude that the prosecution has

established the inward journey to the satisfaction of court”.

In the case of Koushappis v. The State of WA [2007] WASCA 26; (2007) 168

A Crim R 51 at para 85 the court held:

“Whilst the safe custody of critical exhibits such as these ought to be

readily proved by clear and specific evidence rather than being left to

inference, having regard to the way the case was conducted on both sides,

the evidence here was such in my view, as to allow the jury to be satisfied

beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs that were analysed… were in fact

those seized by police from the appellant’s house”;

The judgments cited above clearly demonstrate how important the evidence

relating to the chain of custody is in a drug related offence. Further, it

provides clear directions as to how that evidence should be presented to the

satisfaction of the trial court. Every piece of evidence needs a proper analysis

to decide without any doubt where it came from and who had access to it

without any deviation in routine practice.

At this stage the learned Additional Solicitor General in keeping with the

highest tradition of the Attorney General’s Department, conceded that the

contradictions and the weight discrepancy would certainly affect the

outcome of the case.

CA/HCC/0277/2023

12 | P a g e

Taking all these circumstances into consideration, I am of the view that the

conviction of the Appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution

had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, I

set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court

Judge of Vavuniya dated 12th July 2023 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is

acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Vavuniya along with the original case record.

I agree.
