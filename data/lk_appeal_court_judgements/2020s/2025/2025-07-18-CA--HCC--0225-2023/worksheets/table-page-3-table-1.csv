"","relevant Medico-Legal Report, dated 28.06.2008, was marked in evidence as P3. The"
"","history recorded by the Judicial Medical Officer is as follows:"
"","“
අම්මාගේ තුන්ගෙනියා.   මල්ලි බාප්පා ග ාවිතැන් කරන්ගන්. අම්මා ඉඳලා හිටලා අක්කලා"
"","ග දර යනො.  මම ග දර ඉන්ගන් නංගිලාත් ඒක්ක. අවුරුදු 2ක් විතර රෑට බාප්පා මම ළ ට"
"","ඒනො.  කටින් අත පපුෙ අල්ලලනො.  මූන ඉඹිනො.  යටින් ඒයා චූෙ දාලා කරනො.  පුරුෂ ිං ය"
"","මගේ  ඒකට  ඇතුල්කරනවා  කෑ   හන්න  ගදන්  නෑ.    සුදු  පාට   ෑගෙනො.    විනාඩි  5ක්  විතර"

"","8.  However, during the cross-examination of the prosecutrix, the defense did not challenge"
"","her version of events, specifically her claim that it was the Appellant who raped her."
"","More significantly, defense counsel made no reference to the history recorded by the"
"","Judicial Medical Officer when questioning the prosecutrix. It is noteworthy that, during"
"","the  cross-examination  of  the  prosecutrix,  the  defense  did  not  highlight  any  material"
"","contradictions in her testimony."
"9.","In his testimony, the Judicial Medical Officer stated that the hymen of the prosecutrix"
"","was ruptured and that healed tears were observed at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions."
"","Furthermore, according to the JMO’s opinion, there was evidence of repetitive vaginal"
"","penetration. Notably, the JMO opined that the hymenal tears he observed had occurred"
"","at least three months prior to the date of examination. More importantly, he also noted"
"","depressive  features  in  the  prosecutrix  and,  as  a  result,  referred  her  to  a  consultant"
"","psychiatrist."
"","10. It is to be noted that the prosecutrix consistently stated in her evidence that her step-"
"","father, the Appellant, was the one who raped her over a period of two years. Although"
"","the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) recorded the history provided by the prosecutrix as"
"","“අම්මාගේ තුන්ගෙනියා.”  this does not weaken the credibility of her testimony for the"
"","following reasons."
"","11. In the history provided to the JMO, the prosecutrix clearly stated that her stepfather had"
"","been raping her at night for the past two years.  Significantly, the Medico-Legal Report"
"","contains the phrase ""අම්මාගේ තුන්ගෙනියා."" This phrase does not imply the prosecutrix's"
"","mother's third brother. Instead, its meaning becomes clear when considering the cross-"
"","examination of the prosecutrix's mother. When the defense counsel proposed that the"
"","Appellant was her third husband, she confirmed it. This testimony directly supports the"
