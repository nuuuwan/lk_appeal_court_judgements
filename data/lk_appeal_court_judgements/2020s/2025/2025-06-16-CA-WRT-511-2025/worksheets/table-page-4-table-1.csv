"3.  To finalise the list of properties and/or assets belonging to the Mosque"
"4.  To draw up a constitution based on past practices"
"5.  To conduct the election according to the past practice within their term"
"Having  scrutinised  the  Order  made  by  the  Wakf  Board;  it  is  abundantly  clear"
"that  the  special  trustees  have  been  appointed  for  a  short  period  in  order  to"
"regularise the affairs of the Mosque. In these circumstances, it appears to this"
"Court that there is no necessity to quash the decision of the Wakf Board dated"
"18.02.2025.  If  the 
impugned  decision  of  the  Wakf  Board 
is  quashed,  the"
"Mosque would be left without a functioning administrative body and would be"
"unable to carry out its duties. Furthermore, the Petitioners, who are the former"
"trustees  of  the  Mosque,  have  no  legitimate  right  to  continue  managing  the"
"affairs  of  the  Mosque,  as  their  tenure  has  come  to  an  end.  In  terms  of  the"
"provisions of the Muslim  Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act No. 51"
"of  1956  (as  amended),  the  Wakf  Board  is  vested  with  the  power  to  appoint"
"trustees to administer Mosques within the purview of the said Act."
"Having examined the documents and the impugned Order of the Wakf Board, it"
"is manifestly clear that the special trustees have been appointed in the interest"
"of the Mosque and for the benefit of the members of the jama’ath."
"Be that as it may, it is trite law that when an alternative remedy is provided by"
"statute, parties are generally required to exhaust such remedy before invoking"
"the  writ 
jurisdiction  of 
this  Court.  The  writ 
jurisdiction,  particularly 
the"
"issuance of prerogative writs such as certiorari or mandamus, and prohibition is"
"a discretionary remedy. It is not conferred as of right but is to be exercised by"
"courts  with  caution,  circumspection,  and  only  when  no  efficacious  alternative"
"mechanism  is  available  to  address  the  alleged  grievance.  Alternative  remedies"
"are  statutory  mechanisms  provided  by 
the 
legislature  such  as  appeals,"
"revisions,  reviews,  or  representations 
to  higher  administrative  authorities,"
"which offer aggrieved parties a structured process to ventilate and redress their"
"grievances."
"It is pertinent to note that the principle requiring parties to exhaust alternative"
"remedies  before  invoking  the  writ  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  is  not  a  mere"
"procedural  formality,  but  one  deeply  rooted  in  the  common  law  tradition.  The"
"origins  of  this  doctrine  can  be  traced  back  to  the  jurisprudence  of  the  King’s"
"Bench 
in  England,  where 
the  prerogative  writs,  such  as  habeas  corpus,"
"certiorari,  mandamus,  and  prohibition,  were  historically  issued  in  exceptional"
"circumstances to check administrative excess or illegality. As governance grew"
"more  complex  and  specialized  administrative  bodies  emerged,  English  courts"
