"began to recognize the practical necessity of requiring litigants to first resort to"
"the remedies provided within the statutory or administrative frameworks."
"As  early  as  the  18th  century,  in  R  v.  Morley  (1760)1,  the  English  courts"
"signaled  the 
importance  of  pursuing  available  statutory  recourse  prior  to"
"seeking prerogative writs. This approach was more definitively articulated in R"
"v.  Middlesex  Justices 
(1840)2,  where  the  court  refused  to 
intervene  via"
"habeas  corpus  on  the  ground  that  an  adequate  statutory  appeal  process"
"existed.  Over 
the  passage  of 
time, 
this  principle 
evolved 
to  become  a"
"cornerstone  of  administrative 
law,  emphasizing  both 
judicial  restraint  and"
"respect 
for  the 
institutional  autonomy  of  administrative  and  quasi-judicial"
"bodies."
"The  decision  in  R  v.  Commissioner  of  Police  of  the  Metropolis,  ex  parte"
"Blackburn [1968]3 crystallized the modern form of the doctrine in the United"
"Kingdom.  Therein,  the  Court  reaffirmed  the  discretionary  nature  of  writs  and"
"emphasized that their issuance may justifiably be declined  when an adequate"
"alternative  remedy  exists.  This  principle  has  since  been  consistently  followed,"
"notably in R (G) v. Governors of X School [2011]4 and R (O) v. Secretary of"
"State for the Home Department [2016]5, where the UK Supreme Court held"
"that  the  petitioners,  respectively  a  suspended  teacher  and  an  asylum  seeker,"
"ought  to  have  availed  themselves  of  internal  appeal  procedures  and  statutory"
"appellate mechanisms before turning to the courts for relief."
"The doctrine is similarly entrenched in American jurisprudence under what is"
"known as the ""exhaustion doctrine."" Early decisions such as United States v."
"Sing Tuck (1904)6 and Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Railway (1908)7 laid down"
"the  principle  that  judicial  recourse  must  be  preceded  by  the  exhaustion  of"
"administrative  procedures. 
In  Myers  v.  Bethlehem  Shipbuilding  Corp."
"(1938)8,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  reiterated  that  courts  must  defer  to  the"
"administrative  process  where  statutory  remedies  are  provided.  This  principle"
"was ultimately codified in the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, which"
"made exhaustion of remedies a statutory prerequisite to judicial intervention."
