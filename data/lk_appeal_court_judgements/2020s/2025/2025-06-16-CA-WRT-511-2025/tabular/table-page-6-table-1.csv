"The  overarching  rationale  across  these  jurisdictions  is  clear,  to  preserve  the"
"extraordinary  nature  of 
judicial  review, 
to  avoid  premature  disruption  of"
"specialized 
administrative  processes 
and 
to  prevent 
the 
judiciary 
from"
"becoming  a  forum  of  first  instance  in  matters  that  fall  within  the  purview  of"
"designated statutory authorities"
"This principle was lucidly explained by the Indian Supreme Court in Whirlpool"
"Corporation  v.  Registrar  of  Trademarks,  Mumbai9,  where  it  was  held  that"
"although  Article  226  jurisdiction  is  wide,  courts  would  not  entertain  writs"
"where  an 
effective  and 
efficacious  alternative 
remedy 
exists, 
except 
in"
"exceptional  cases,  such  as  where  there  is  a  breach  of  natural  justice,  lack  of"
"jurisdiction, or a constitutional challenge."
"“Under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution,  the  High  Court,  having  regard  to"
"the  facts  of  the  case,  has  the  discretion  to  entertain  or  not  to  entertain  a"
"writ  petition.  But 
the  High  Court  has 
imposed  upon 
itself 
certain"
"restrictions  one  of  which  is  that  if  an  effective  and  efficacious  remedy  is"
"available,  the High  Court  would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But"
"the  alternative  remedy  has  been  consistently  held  by  this  Court  not  to"
"operate  as  a  bar  in  at  least  three  contingencies,  namely,  where  the  writ"
"petition  has  been  filed  for  the  enforcement  of  any  of  the  Fundamental"
"Rights or where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice"
"or  where  the  order  or  proceedings  are  wholly  without  jurisdiction  or  the"
"vires of an Act is challenged.”"
"Further,  in  the  case  of  Harbanslal  Sahnia  v  Indian  Oil  Corpn.  Ltd10,  the"
"Supreme Court of India held that;"
"“In  an  appropriate  case, 
in  spite  of  the  availability  of  the  alternative"
"remedy,  the  High  Court  may  still  exercise  its  writ  jurisdiction  in  at  least"
"three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of"
"the fundamental rights; (ii) where there is a failure of principles of natural"
"justice;  or 
(iii)  where 
the  orders  or  proceedings  are  wholly  without"
"jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.”"
"Our 
own 
jurisprudence 
has 
echoed 
this 
restraint. 
In 
the 
case 
of"
"Somasunderam  Vanniasingham  Vs.  Forbes  and  others11 
the  Supreme"
"Court observed that;"
