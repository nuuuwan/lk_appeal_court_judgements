Judgment

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted in the

High Court of Embilipitiya for committing grave sexual abuse on two occasions on a

child of under 16 of age. These offences are punishable under sections 365B(2)(b) of

the Penal Code, as amended by Acts No. 22 of 1995, No. 29 of 1998, and No. 16 of

2006.

2. At the trial, 5 witnesses testified for the prosecution. At the end of the prosecution

case, the appellant made a dock statement. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned

High Court Judge found the appellant guilty of the first count and convicted him. The

appellant was acquitted from the 2nd charge. For the first count, the appellant was

sentenced for 10 years rigorous imprisonment and also was imposed a fine of Rs

10000.00 carrying a default sentence of 12 months simple imprisonment.

Additionally, the appellant was ordered to pay Rs 50000.00 to the victim with a

default sentence of 12 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant has preferred

the instant appeal.

3. Following are the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant.

a. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider probability

and also failed to evaluate the testimony of PW2;

b. Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance was not considered;

c. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate medical evidence; and

d. The procedure adopted by the High Court Judge and prosecutor to remove

evidence of PW9, a lay witness, from the proceedings is wrong in law.

CA/HCC/0059/2023

Background to the appeal:

4. The prosecution story was that PW1 the victim when going home riding his bicycle

was halted by the appellant and pulled the victim to the side of the road and removed

his trouser and inserted the appellant’s penis twice into his anus.

5. I will first consider whether the learned trial Judge had failed to evaluate the

testimony of PW1 in particular the probability of his story. According to PW1, when

he was riding a bicycle, the appellant blocked him and made him to fall. Thereafter,

the appellant removed the victim’s trouser and inserted his penis to the victim’s

rectum. At that time a person called Priyankara PW9 came and questioned the

appellant. Thereafter, the victim went home crying and informed the incident to his

mother PW1.

6. According to the victim, the alleged offence was committed at the side of the road and

it was a sandy place. The victim was laying on his stomach when the alleged offence

was being committed by the appellant. ‍

7. The offences of this nature are normally committed in discreet places where no eye

witnesses are found. Therefore, court has to rely on the evidence of the victim and if

available on medical evidence. Very rarely, an eye witness could be found in this kind

of offences.

8. PW2 clearly stated that while he was being subjected to the alleged offence, PW9

arrived at the scene and questioned the appellant about his actions. According to PW2,

when PW9 came there, the appellant was positioned on top of him. If that was indeed

the case, PW9 would have been able to witness the incident firsthand, providing the

prosecution with a valuable opportunity to corroborate the testimony of PW2 by

calling PW9 to testify. PW2 testified as follows:

Vide page 70 9. However, without any apparent justification, the prosecution failed to call PW9 as a

witness, despite having listed him during the trial.

10. Regrettably, the evidence of the PW6 the Medical Officer who examined the victim is

not convincing at all. According to the Medico Legal Report (MLR) the victim was

examined by PW6 on 23.01.2010 at 10.50 am. The alleged offence was committed on

22.01.2010.

11. According to PW6 he observed no injuries on the body of the victim expect redness

around the anus. It could be observed in the MLR, when PW6 recorded the injuries,

he had written that there was no evidence of anal penetration but cut it off and later

wrote on the Report that there is medical evidence of recent penetration. It is

significant to note that PW6 when stated his opinion on the MLR did not even

describe it as anal penetration but recent penetration.

12. Furthermore, it is significant to note that there were two Medico-Legal Reports

prepared by the same doctor in respect of the victim, marked as X1 and X2. Report

X1, dated 03.08.2012, states that there was medical evidence of recent penetration.

However, Report X2, dated 10.05.2022, states that there was no evidence of anal

penetration. The same report further confirms that there was no medical evidence of

vaginal or anal penetration. No satisfactory explanation was provided by the doctor

for these conflicting conclusions.

13. More importantly, when he was being cross-examined, he gave some conflicting

opinions as follows:

Vide page 143 and 144

14. When the evidence of the Medical Officer who examined the victim is uncertain and

inconsistent, it would be dangerous to rely upon such evidence to corroborate the

testimony of PW2.

15. It is also important to note that PW2 when testifying clearly stated that he was placed

on his stomach when the appellant was allegedly committing the offence of grave

sexual abuse. According to MLR, the victim was examined by PW6 on the following

day. In his evidence, the victim stated that he was fallen when the bicycle was stopped

by the appellant. Furthermore, he stated that his hands were held behind his back by

the appellant and that he was forced to lie on the road while being sexually abused by

him. If this evidence is true, there should be injuries on his body. But PW6 observed

no injuries on the victim. He testified as follows:

ප්රl : න‍ වඔ‍ ව ටඔ‍ නට ම‍ුන න්‍? උ : නඑව‍ ේුව‍ අ එ‍බයාදු යංකන්‍වට්ඔවඑ‍ගත් එ.

උ : න ේ‍ ලිසන‍ග් වේවඑ.

Vide Page 51

16. Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept that the victim sustained no injuries, as

reflected in the Medico-Legal Report, if the alleged offence was indeed committed

upon him by the appellant, as per his evidence.

17. In view of the unconvincing medical evidence, and particularly when the victim’s

narrative remains uncorroborated by such evidence, it was incumbent upon the

prosecution to call PW9, an eyewitness to the alleged incident. However, for reasons

best known to the prosecution, PW9 was not summoned to testify.

18. In these circumstances, the presumption under Section 114 illustration (f) of the

Evidence Ordinance becomes applicable, whereby the Court may presume that

evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavorable to

the prosecution. The failure to call PW9, who was in a position to materially support

or contradict the version of PW2, casts a serious doubt on the reliability of the

prosecution’s case. The Court cannot lightly disregard the non-production of such a

crucial witness, particularly when his testimony would have provided direct evidence

of the alleged incident. In this regard, the following authorities would be of much

relevance.

19. In Walimunige John v. The State 76 NLR 488, it was held:

“that the prosecution is not bound to call all the witnesses whose names

appear on the back of the indictment or to tender them for cross-

examination. Further, it is not incumbent on the trial Judge to direct the jury,

save in exceptional circumstances, that they may draw a presumption under

section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance adverse to the prosecution from its

failure to call one or more of its witnesses at the trial‍ without calling all.

" The question of a presumption arises only where a witness whose evidence is

necessary to unfold the narrative is withheld by the ' prosecution and the

CA/HCC/0059/2023

7 | P a g e

failure to call such witness constitutes a vital missing link in the prosecution

case and where the reasonable inference to be drawn from the omission to call

the witness is that he would, if called, not have supported the prosecution. But

where one witness's evidence is cumulative of the other and would be a mere

repetition of the narrative, it would be wrong to direct a jury that the failure to

call such witness gives rise to a presumption under section 114 (f) of the

Evidence Ordinance."

20. Similarly, the case of Kumara De Silva and Two Others vs. Attorney General [2010]

(2) SLR 169 reinforced the principle that an adverse presumption under Section

114(f) can be drawn when a witness's evidence is willfully withheld by the

prosecution and constitutes a vital missing link in the case.

21. In R vs. Stephen Seneviratne 38 NLR 208, the Privy Council held that the

prosecution must call witnesses whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the

narrative of the case. It was further held inter alia that: The prosecution is not bound

to call witnesses irrespective of considerations of number and of reliability. Witnesses

essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based must be

called by the prosecution, whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or

against the case for the prosecution.

22. In the present case, there was no justifiable reason for the prosecution to refrain from

calling PW9, who, according to the testimony of PW2, was an eyewitness to the

incident. Furthermore, a careful examination of the High Court proceedings reveals

that the learned Judge had permitted the expunging of PW9’s evidence after the same

had been recorded. In my view, this action has gravely impaired the appellant’s right

to a fair trial.

23. What then was the nature of PW9’s evidence? Why was it expunged? Was it because

such evidence was unfavorable to the prosecution’s case? No satisfactory explanation

emerges from the record, nor is any reasonable justification discernible.

24. Moreover, the location where the alleged incident took place further casts doubt on

the prosecution story. According to PW1, the offence was committed by the appellant

on a roadside, which is not a secluded place, and PW3 also purportedly witnessed it.

CA/HCC/0059/2023

8 | P a g e

When the medical evidence fails to support the prosecution’s version, the probability

of the prosecution story is further called into question.

25. The aforesaid discrepancies and inconsistencies discernible in the prosecution

evidence appear to have escaped the attention of the learned High Court Judge.

Moreover, the learned trial Judge has failed to properly appreciate the inconsistent

nature of the medical evidence, particularly the fact that the Medical Officer based his

findings predominantly on the history provided by the victim rather than on any

definitive clinical observations of his own.

26. It is also pertinent to highlight that the victim’s testimony is not corroborated by the

medical evidence due to its inconsistent nature, and therefore, the evidence of the

other eyewitness, PW9, would have been of immense assistance in ascertaining the

truth of the case had he been called. Furthermore, upon a perusal of the proceedings

of the High Court, it appears that the learned High Court Judge has erred in

concluding that the failure to call PW9 had no impact on the prosecution case.

27. In these circumstances, when the independent medical evidence does not support the

version of the victim, and when the failure to call a material eye witness remains

unexplained, the benefit of the doubt must necessarily be extended to the appellant. It

is a well-established principle of criminal jurisprudence that where doubt arises with

respect to the prosecution’s narrative, such doubt must operate in favour of the

accused.

28. Upon a consideration of the totality of the evidence placed before this Court, it

becomes evident that the prosecution has failed to establish the charge beyond

reasonable doubt. The learned High Court Judge, with respect, has erred in failing to

properly evaluate the material inconsistencies and contradictions in the prosecution

evidence, particularly the uncertainty arising from the medical opinion which

undermines the victim’s testimony, as well as the unexplained exclusion of the

testimony of PW9, an alleged eyewitness whose evidence would have been of

substantial relevance.

29. In the circumstances, I am compelled to hold that the conviction entered against the

appellant is unsafe and cannot be permitted to stand. The shortcomings in the medical

evidence, the failure to call PW9 whose testimony was material, and the misdirection

CA/HCC/0059/2023

9 | P a g e

in evaluating the reliability of the prosecution witnesses cumulatively give rise to a

reasonable doubt which must necessarily accrue to the benefit of the appellant.

30. On the above premise, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed upon the

appellant by the learned High Court Judge.

31. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
