"Relevancy of the documents"
"According to the Respondent, the Petitioner is seeking to adduce certain documents in evidence in"
"the District Court that were exchanged between two parties; namely, a judicial officer who is under"
"the JSC, and the JSC. Therefore, if those documents are relevant to any case before any court, the"
"Petitioner must establish their relevancy in that court. Then, if necessary, the learned Judge of the"
"said  court  will  make  a  ruling  directing  the  Secretary  to  produce  the  documents.  Therefore,  the"
"Petitioner  is  first  under  a  duty  to  establish  the  relevancy  of  the  said  documents.  Even  if  the"
"documents are obtained from the JSC, if they are not deemed relevant to the case before the court,"
"the learned District Judge may overrule them."
"The other matter raised by Ms. Jayasekara was that, if at all the Petitioner needs to adduce such a"
"document as part of evidence that she seeks in any litigation, she can still adduce the copy of the"
"document currently in her possession. However, when the other party objects only, she has to call"
"upon  the  Secretary  of  the  JSC  to  establish  the  authenticity  of  the  document.      Therefore,  such"
"alternative legal provisions are also available to the Petitioner."
"When the documents fall within the RTI Act"
"Additionally,  the  Petitionerâ€™s  complaint  to  this  Court  is  based  on  the  need  to  obtain  certain"
"documents received by the JSC, which are maintained as part of the record. When the Petitioner"
"sought the said document to be released by the Secretary to the JSC, he has not complied with the"
"said  request.  As  such,  the  Petitioner  herself  has  stated  that  she  is  entitled  to  obtain  the  said"
"document, or information related to the said document in terms of the RTI Act. However, if the"
"JSC  Secretary  has  a  duty  under  the  RTI  Act  to  divulge  or  to  release  the  information  that  the"
"Petitioner needs relating to certain record maintained in the JSC Secretariate, the Petitioner should"
"have  first  gone  to  the  Right  to  Information  Commission  and  taken  steps  under  the  RTI  Act."
