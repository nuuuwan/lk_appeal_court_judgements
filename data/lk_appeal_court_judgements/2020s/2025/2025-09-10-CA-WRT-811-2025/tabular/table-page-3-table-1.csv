"Arguments",""
"The thrust of the submission advanced by Ms. Azeez is that the Petitioner is seeking to obtain a",""
"Writ of Mandamus, compelling the Secretary of the JSC to issue certain certified copies which are",""
"relevant to be produced as evidence in several cases.",""
"However,  upon  questioning,  it  was  her  position  that  her  client  the  Petitioner  did  not  make  any",""
"application under the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016 (herein after referred to as “RTI",""

"something confidential.",""
"On the other hand, Ms. Jayasekara, having vehemently objected to the issuance of notice, brought",""
"to our attention that when there are alternative remedies provided by the statutory law, a Writ of",""
"Mandamus will not lie. Having referred to paragraph 5.6 of the Petition, Ms. Jayasekara contended",""
"that in view of the Petitioner’s own showing, she is not entitled to any relief sought.",""
"The  next  argument  advanced  by  Ms.  Jayasekara  is  that  having  referred  to  paragraph  2.1  of  the",""
"Petition, the Petitioner has sought to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court against the JSC in",""
"terms of Articles 111D and 111H of the Constitution, which is totally irrelevant to the complaint",""
"made by the Petitioner in this Court.",""
"Further,  she  contended  that  if  those  documents","that  are  not  available  to  the  Petitioner  are"
"confidential in nature, and if they are vital for her case, she should have summoned the Secretary",""
"of the JSC to produce those documents. Additionally, she argued that some of the documents that",""
"the Petitioner is seeking to rely upon to produce evidence in Courts, are irrelevant to her  claim",""
"since they are documents exchanged between other parties.",""
