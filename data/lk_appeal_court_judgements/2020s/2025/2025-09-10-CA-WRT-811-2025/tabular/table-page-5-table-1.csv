"However, upon questioning, the Counsel for the Petitionerâ€™s contention was that her client does"
"not want any other party to know or come to know about the said document. Therefore, it is very"
"clear  as  argued  by  Ms.  Jayasekara,  that  the  Petitioner  should  have  first  initiated  an  application"
"under Sections 3 and 4, read with Section 5 of the RTI Act. As such, the Petitioner cannot invoke"
"the writ jurisdiction of this Court without resorting to proper legal proceedings."
"Conclusion"
"Therefore,  it  is  my  view  that  no  Writ  of  Mandamus  can  be  granted  in  this  case,  based  on  the"
"application  made  by  Petitioner.  As  such,  I  am  not  inclined  to  issue  formal  notice,  and  the"
"application is dismissed in limine without costs."
