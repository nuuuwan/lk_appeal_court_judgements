"inconsistencies cast doubt on the reliability of his testimony and raise legitimate"
"concerns as to whether the Court can safely rely upon it. The Learned High Court"
"Judge failed to adequately address and assess these contradictions in the victim’s"
"evidence. I am of the view that this contradiction strikes at the very root of the"
"case and materially affects the credibility of the prosecution’s evidence."
"Accordingly,  we  find  that  the  testimony  of  PW  01  does  not  provide  a  sufficient"
"basis  to  establish  the  guilt  of  the  Accused.  The Prosecution  has  failed  to  prove,"
"beyond  a  reasonable doubt,  that  a  sexual act  was  committed against the  victim"
"solely on the strength of PW 01’s evidence."
"In light of the foregoing, the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High"
"Court Judge are hereby set aside. The Accused is acquitted of the charge on which"
"he was convicted."
"Appeal Allowed."
