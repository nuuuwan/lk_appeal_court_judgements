"10. In such circumstances, the Presiding Officer, in the least, is statutorily"
"required to indicate and give reasons as to why he finds the charges to"
"be proved. In the current application, the prosecution has led evidence"
"to  establish  that  the  substance  was  found  in  the  possession  of  the"
"accused. As opposed to that, the accused has denied being in possession"
"and also suggested that this may be an introduction. What is important"
"is that a person entrusted with the trying of the accused, both on facts"
"and  law,  should  advert  and  consider  the  evidence  and  formulate  his"
"opinion. In the present context, these also entailed the evaluation of the"
"position put forward by the accused person. According to item 06(n) of"
"the Sri Lanka Navy Order 0501, reasons should be indicated. Indicating"
"the reasons will mean the manifesting of such reasons, which should be"
"available  along  with  the  finding,  and  therefore,  the  reasons  for  the"
"finding should be provided. The Presiding Officer had clearly failed and"
"not provided any reasons, even in basic summary form. Therefore, the"
"failure to give reasons does amount to the violation of the rules of natural"
"justice."
