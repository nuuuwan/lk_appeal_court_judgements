The respondent had failed to tender lis pendens until 14-07-2014. After that, the respondent failed to take the steps required under section 12(2) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, as amended. After several days, the Attorney-at-law for the respondent, on 31-03-2015, informed the court that he had no instruction from the plaintiff.

The Attorneys-at-law for the defendants sought time to inform the court whether they would prosecute the action. Thereafter, on 02-09-2019, the Attorney-at-law for the defendants informed the court that they were not willing to prosecute the case.

However, in terms of the provisions under section 70 of the Partition Law, the Learned District Judge should have made it clear by ordering that the action be dismissed and also to cancel the lis pendens and inform the relevant land registry to register the cancellation of the lis pendens. On 20-11-2019, the Attorney-at-Law for the plaintiff filed a motion seeking that the case be called on 26-11-2019. On 26-11-2019, it was recorded that the case had been terminated for non-prosecution by the plaintiff and the defendant. The Attorney-at-law for the plaintiff moved for time to make a formal application. Once the proceedings were terminated on 02-09-2019, the case could not be revived by any application. After that, the case was called on several dates, and no application was made. However, any step taken after the dismissal of the action becomes null and void. Even assuming that the action is still active, the respondent has not taken steps to survey the land or to deposit survey fees. The Plaintiff-respondent has not been prosecuting the case with due diligence. In the above circumstances, the plaintiff-petitioner-respondent has no prima facie case against the petitioner.

As the injunction is an equitable relief granted in the discretion of the Court do the conduct and dealings of the parties justify grant of the injunction. The petitioner pointed out that the land was originally owned by the mother of the petitioner, the respondent, and some of the defendants. The original owner, G.H. Charlet Nona, had partitioned the land into several blocks by plan bearing no. 2767 dated 29-11-1990, prepared by Peter Fernando, Licensed Surveyor. Petitioner states that the said Charlet Nona had amalgamated Lot No. 1 and 2 of Plan No. 2767 and subdivided the same into three lots as depicted in Plan No. 3020 prepared by M.D.N. Fernando, Licensed Surveyor. The petitioner further states that the said Charlet Nona gifted Lot 3 of the said sub-division plan No. 3020 to one of her daughters, Amarasinghe Arachchige Dona Iranganie Amarasinghe, and to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner became the owner of the divided and defined portion of the said larger land. Petitioner further stated that the petitioner\u2019s mother initially gifted three other allotments bearing no. 3, 5 and 6 of the plan no. 2767 to the petitioners\u2019 sisters, namely Malini Amarasinghe, Wasanthi Amarasinghe and Indrani Amarasinghe, by way of deeds of gift-bearing no. 2304, 2306 and 2307 attested by P H Jinapriya, Notary Public. Petitioner further states that the petitioner\u2019s mother had gifted another divided portion of the said larger land, namely Lot 4 of plan 2767, to the plaintiff-petitioner-respondent by way of the deed of gift bearing no. 2305 attested by P H Jinapriya, Notary Public. The petitioner has tendered copies of the abovementioned deeds and two plans. Prima facie, the plaintiff-petitioner-respondent has suppressed several material facts from the court and obtained an injunction against the petitioner. The respondent has not filed the complete copy of deed no. 2305. She has filed the first page and the last page of that deed. The schedule was not available to the Judge. If the Judge had looked at the schedule of deed no. 2305, she would have found that the schedule was referred to as a divided and defined portion of land and not undivided land. This is really a misrepresentation.",

    "text": "Furthermore, the aforesaid Charlet Nona gifted a divided and defined 25 perches to the 2nd defendant by deed no. 2304 attested by P. Jinapriya Notary Public on 20-08-1992. The said Charlet Nona gifted another divided and defined 25 perches of land to the 3rd defendant by deed no. 2306 on the same day attested by the same Notary. The said Charlet Nona gifted another divided and defined 25 perches of land to the 18th defendant who was not a party to the original plaint, later added herself as 18th defendant by deed no. 2307 on the same day attested by the same Notary. In the circumstances, it is obvious that the land sought to be partitioned by the respondent is not a co-owned land. Since the plaintiff-petitioner-respondent\u2019s partition action was dismissed on 02-09-2019, the Learned District Judge cannot revive the case back. The land sought to be partitioned has already been partitioned by the original owner, and several lots have been disposed of. If there were any blocks of land which were not disposed of during the lifetime of the original owner, Charlet Nona, only such blocks would become co-owned land. In the above circumstances, the order of the Learned District Judge dated 12-07-2024 was obtained by the plaintiff-petitioner-respondent, suppressing several material facts. In Alphonso Appuhamy v Hettiarachchi 77 NLR 131 the Supreme Court held as follows; The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the Court when an application for a writ or injunction is made and the process of the Court is invoked is laid down in the case of The King v. The General Commissioners for the Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington\u2014Ex-parte Princess Edmond de Poignac \u2014 (1917)1 Kings Bench Division 486. Although this case deals with a writ of prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit, and therefore, it was justified in refusing a writ of prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination.",

    "text": "As the Plaintiff-respondent has not made out a prima-facie case, and the injunction against the petitioner was obtained by suppressing material facts, this court decides to set aside the order of the Learned District Judge dated 12-07-2024. By the order dated 02-09-2019, the District Judge stated as follows: \u201c\u0d92 \u0d85\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0db1\u0da9\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0d85\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dd2 \u201d. After such dismissal of the partition action, the District Judge could not have revived the action. Furthermore, the petitioner has submitted relevant documents and has proved that the subject matter of the action is not co-owned land. Therefore, the order of the District Judge dated 20-11-2019 is set aside. In the above circumstances, the application of the petitioner is allowed. The Learned District Judge of Moratuwa is directed to dismiss the partition action163/\u0db6\u0db6\u0daf\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca and to cancel the lis pendens. The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward a copy of this judgment to the District Court of Moratuwa.",
