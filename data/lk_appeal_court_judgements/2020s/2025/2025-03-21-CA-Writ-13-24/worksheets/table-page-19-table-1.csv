"the Petitioner being a senior officer was aware of the seriousness of being absent without"
"leave  and  the  discipline  that  is  expected  of  the  officers  of  the  forces.  Accordingly,  this"
"Court finds that for that expectation to be legitimate there should be strict compliance with"
"discipline and the Petitioner should have demonstrated that he falls within Regulations 8"
"and 10 which the Petitioner himself has placed reliance. Specially, in view of the fact that"
"there is a wide discretion to the appointing authority to take a decision that is in the best"
"interest of the Navy, and also due consideration should be given to the Petitioner’s past"
"record. Considering all the facts submitted this court cannot agree with the contention that"
"the Petitioner’s expectation is legitimate."
