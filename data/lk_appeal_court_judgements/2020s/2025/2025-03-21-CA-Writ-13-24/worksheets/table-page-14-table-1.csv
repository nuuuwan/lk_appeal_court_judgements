"The Petitioner’s relief"
"T
he Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the adverse decisions in relation to"
"the Petitioner in document marked as P11. However, as stated above in this judgement,"
"P11  is  the  document  that  recommends  the  Petitioner  for  his  promotion.  The  document"
"marked  as  P11  does  not  contain  any  adverse  decisions  pertaining  to  the  Petitioner  and"
"recommends the Petitioner to the rank of Rear Admiral. Even the said document does not"
"contain  any  adverse  decisions  against  the  Petitioner.  In  the  said  document,  paragraph  5"
"gives the history of the Petitioner’s AWOL charge and in paragraph 6 the Promotion Board"
"has commented that they have learnt that the officers found guilty of AWOL previously"
"have  not  been  considered  for  promotions.  Yet  in  their  recommendations  the  Promotion"
"Board has recommended the Petitioner but subject to the instructions or directives of the"
"Ministry of Defence pertaining to the promotions of officers found guilty of AWOL. In"
"view of Regulations 8 and 10 this Court does not find any procedural irregularity to quash"
"the said letter. Thus, the Court is not inclined to grant the relief prayed in the prayer (c) of"
"the Petition."
