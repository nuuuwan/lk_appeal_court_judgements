"The  importance  of  strict  discipline  was  discussed  by  Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill  in  the"
"House of Lords case R v. Boyd Etc. [2002] UKHL 31.  Lord Bingham states;"
"“3. The effectiveness of such forces has been recognised to depend on their being"
"disciplined forces: that is, forces in which lawful orders will be obeyed, the law will"
"be observed, and appropriate standards of self-control and conduct will be shown."
"4. While disciplinary rules and procedures will inevitably vary from state to state,"
"three principles would now, I think, command acceptance in any liberal democracy"
"governed by the rule of law….  Secondly, the maintenance of the discipline essential"
"to the effectiveness of a fighting force is as necessary in peacetime as in wartime: a"
"force which cannot display the qualities mentioned above in time of peace cannot"
"hope to withstand the much more testing strains and temptations of war.”"
