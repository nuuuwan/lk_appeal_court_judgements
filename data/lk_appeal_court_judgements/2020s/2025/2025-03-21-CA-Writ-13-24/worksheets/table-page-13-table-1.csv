"efficiency, discipline, exigencies of service etc. The Court cannot interfere with the"
"appointment  or  promotion  unless 
the 
first  respondent  has  acted  unlawfully,"
"arbitrarily,  or  guided  by  ulterior  considerations  which  are  discriminatory  or"
"unfair.‚Äù"
"I
n considering all the material before this Court, it is our view that the Petitioner has failed"
"to establish that the Respondents have acted unlawfully, arbitrarily or guided by ulterior"
"considerations which are discriminatory or unfair."
"I
n this instance, it was argued that when the promotion was due upon a vacancy arisen, the"
"Respondents  had  appointed 
the  Promotion  Board  and 
the  Promotion  Board  after"
"scrutinising the applicants had nevertheless recommended the Petitioner. It is also argued"
"that  as  per  the  normal  procedure,  the  recommendation  had  been  tendered  through  the"
"Ministry of Defence to His Excellency the President. The Petitioner did not contest the said"
"procedure nor is he complaining of not sending his name to the President."
"I
n answering the question of double jeopardy, the Court agrees with the Respondents that"
"the Petitioner has not been punished twice. The Petitioner has been recommended by the"
"Promotion Board to the post of Temporary Rear Admiral, but the Promotion Board had"
"thought it prudent to draw the attention to the guilty plea of the AWOL charge and to the"
"zero tolerance policy towards officers with AWOL charges. In any event the appointment"
"is made by the His Excellency the President and in these circumstances, we cannot agree"
"with the contention of the Petitioner that there is double jeopardy and that the Petitioner"
"has been punished twice for the same offence."
"F
urther, this Court would like to make the observation that as per the submissions of the"
"Respondents it appears that the decision not to promote the Petitioner to the rank of Rear"
"Admiral  was  an  administrative  decision  taken  by  the  appointing  authority.  Although"
"administrative  decisions  are  subjected  to  Writ  applications,  this  Court  finds  no  grounds"
"established by the Petitioner to invoke the discretionary remedy of this Court and also when"
"the appointing authority is not made a party."
