JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted for committing the murder of Rajakaruna

Mudiyanselage Chaminda Bandara alias Gamini on 30/11/2005, which is

an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the Appellant

guilty of the charge and sentenced him to death on 15/11/2021.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for the matter to be argued in his absence. Also, at the

time of argument the Appellant was connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant only one Ground of Appeal is raised. According to

the counsel for the Appellant, evidence led at the trial warrants the

consideration of the plea of cumulative provocation, which had not been

adequately dealt with by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment.

CA/HCC/0007/2022

Background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW10 Ajith Sampath Kumara, a cousin of the deceased, the

deceased was a worker attached to a factory named “Lanka Cables” situated

in the Nittambuwa Investment Zone. As the deceased was not from the area,

this witness along with the deceased and some others had been renting a

house in Yatiyana, Wathupitiwala. This witness, the deceased and PW11 had

gone to bed around 9.30-10.00 p.m. on the night in question. He had shared

the bed with the deceased.

This witness had woken up around mid-night hearing a ‘Chuk Chuk’ sound.

The room was dark and the witness had seen a person standing beside the

deceased with a Kinfe. Reacting immediately, this witness had kicked the

person holding the knife but the intruder had run through the main Parlor

of the house. Although PW10 had given chase after the intruder, he had been

unable to apprehend the person but he had identified him as the Appellant.

According to PW9, on the night of the incident, the Appellant was on duty at

the said “Lanka Cables”. He had observed that the Appellant was in a sad

mood. Upon inquiry, the Appellant had told him that his wife was having a

clandestine affair with the deceased. Due to this the Appellant had told him

that he was not in a good mood to work. Therefore, PW9 had advised him to

sleep inside the working place. When he got to know about the deceased’s

murder, he had searched for the Appellant inside the factory but had been

unable to find him at that time.

According to the JMO who held the post mortem on the deceased’s body,

there had been 06 cut injuries in the neck area of the body. According to the

JMO, the death had been caused due to bleeding from the neck, caused by

a sharp cutting weapon.

The Counsel for the Appellant takes up the position that the case against the

Appellant should have been considered under the plea of cumulative

CA/HCC/0007/2022

4 | P a g e

provocation and that he should have been convicted not for murder but for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder under 297 of the Penal Code.

According to exception 1 of Section 294 of the Penal Code;

“Culpable Homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the

power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death

of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other

person by mistake or accident”

The explanation under this exception read as that’

“Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the

offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact”.

Although the counsel for the Appellant seeks relief lessening the culpability

by application of the plea of cumulative provocation, on perusal of the

evidence led before the High Court no evidence of provocation was elicited

either from the evidence of the prosecution nor was the same suggested

during the cross examination. According to Section 105 of the Evidence

Ordinance, it is the responsibility of the Appellant to prove the existence of

a general or special exception during the trial on a balance of probabilities.

In the absence of such proof, the Learned Trial Judge should direct his mind

to the circumstances and the fact that the Appellant is entitled to have the

benefit of the lesser verdict.

In The King v Bellana Vithanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:

"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the

evidence on record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon

by the accused”.

CA/HCC/0007/2022

It is very important at this stage to discuss the development of law regarding

the acceptance of cumulative provocation as a special exception to a murder

charge in our jurisdiction.

In Premalal v Attorney General [2000] 2 SLR 403 Kulatilaka, J held that:

“Until the judgment of Chief Justice H.N.G Fernando in Samithamby v

Queen (1) (de Krester,J-dissenting) our court followed a strict view in

applying Exception (1) set out in Section 294 of the Penal Code. Our judges

following their counterparts in England interpreted the phrase “sudden

provocation” to mean that provocation should consist of a single act which

occurred immediately before killing so that there was no time for the anger

to cool and the act must have been such that it would have made a

reasonable man to react in the manner as the accused did. Our Courts

were reluctant to take into consideration any special circumstances which

manifested in the particular offender’s case”.

Kulatilaka, J. further held that:

“Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where Courts and

juries have taken a more pragmatic view of the mitigatory plea of

provocation. In a series of cases in applying the mitigatory plea of

provocation Courts took into consideration the prior course of relationship

between the accused and his victim”.

In W. A. Gamini v Attorney General CA/142/2009 the court held that:

“the chain of stressful events in the troubled relationship of the accused

and the deceased culminating in the aforesaid unfortunate incident, are

probable reasonably sufficient to entertain a plea of continuing or

cumulative provocation because the accused retaliated at the spur of the

CA/HCC/0007/2022

6 | P a g e

moment and that he could reasonably show that he was deprived of his

self-control”.

Citing the above two judgments His Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya C. J. in

R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General

SC/Appeal/32/2015 decided on 17/07/2020 held that:

“Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in considering the plea

of grave and sudden provocation an accused is entitled to rely upon a

series of prior events that ultimately led to the incident at which the death

was caused. A court should not restrict its focus to an isolated incident

that resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden

provocation. The aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the scope of

this plea by expanding the limitations recognized in its statutory form.

Thereby, the concept of “Continuing or Cumulative” provocation has been

recognized as a plea coming within the purview of the plea of grave and

sudden provocation recognized under Exception-1, section 294 of the Penal

Code. Therefore, the proximity of time between the “actus reus” of the

accused and the “provocative act” of the victim should be considered in the

context of the nature and circumstances in each case, in deciding whether

an accused is entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden

Provocation”.

Further His Lordship in R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney

General (Supra) has cited an Indian Judgment to explain how the concept

of ‘Sustained Provocation’ has been recognised and developed by the

Superior Courts of India.

CA/HCC/0007/2022

7 | P a g e

In Poovammal v State 2012 (2) MLJ (Crl.) 482 the court held:

“30. Under the English Criminal Law, the provocation must be grave and

also sudden. But, by way of judicial thinking, the Indian Criminal Law has

gone ahead. (K. M. NANAVATHI Vs STATE OF MAHARASTRA [A.I.R.) 1962

S.C. 605). In our system, there is the concept of “Sustained Provocation”. It

is concerned with the duration of the provocation. There may be

incidents/occurrences, which are such that they may not make the

offender suddenly to make his outburst by his overt act. However, it may

be lingering in his mind for quite some time, torment continuously and at

one point of time erupt, make him to lose his self-control, make his mind to

go astray, the mind may not be under his control/command and results in

the offender committing the offence. The sustained provocation/frustration

nurtured in the mind of the accused reached the end of breaking point,

under that accused causes the murder of the deceased.”

…………….

“34. In SUYAMBUKKANI Vs STATE OF TAMIL NADU [1989 LW (Crl.) 86], it

is held as under: - “Though there has been here and there attempts in those

decisions to bring the sustained provocation under Exception-1 to Section

300, I.P.C., there is a cardinal difference between provocation as defined

under Exception-1 and sustained provocation. The only word which is

common is ‘provocation’. What Exception-1 contemplates is a grave and

sudden provocation, whereas the ingredient of sustained provocation is a

series of acts more or less grave spread over a certain period of time, the

last of which acting as the last straw breaking the camel’s back may even

be a very trifling one. We are, therefore, far from grave and sudden

provocation contemplated under Exception-1 to Section 300, I.P.C.

Sustained provocation is undoubtedly an addition by Courts, as

anticipated by the architects of the Indian Penal Code”.

CA/HCC/0007/2022

8 | P a g e

Considering the above cited judgments and the background of this case, I

`now consider whether this is an appropriate case in which the plea of

cumulative provocation under Exception-1 to Section 294 of Penal Code

should be considered.

In this case the Appellant was away from home due to his employment. He

was suffering mentally due to the fact that his wife was having an illicit affair

with the deceased. PW9 had noted that the Appellant was in a troubled mood

at the time of this incident. Further, due to this affair, the Appellant was

deprived of the love and care of his wife.

Further depriving the love, care and trust of a wife is an unbearable mental

agony, especially to the husband. This will cause trauma and affect him

psychologically and may cause him to remain in the phases of denial and

anger of the loss for extended periods of time.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General in keeping with the highest tradition

of the Attorney General’s Department informed that she is in agreement with

the Counsel for the Appellant and that this is an appropriate case in which

the first exception to Section 294 of the Penal Code should be considered.

Analysing the evidence presented in this case it clearly demonstrates that

the stressful events and the strained relationship of the Appellant and the

deceased had resulted in the unfortunate incident. Although the Learned

High Court Judge had briefly discussed the concept of cumulative

provocation, he had not awarded the benefit to the Appellant under the said

mitigatory plea.

Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that

this is an appropriate case in which the first exception under Section 294 of

the Penal Code being the mitigatory plea of cumulative provocation should

be considered for the Appellant’s benefit.

Hence, I hereby set aside the death sentence and convict the Appellant for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal

CA/HCC/0007/2022

9 | P a g e

Code. I sentence the Appellant for 10 years rigorous imprisonment

commencing from the date of conviction namely 15/11/2021. Additionally, I

order a fine of Rs.10,000/- with a default sentence of one-year simple

imprisonment. The Appellant is further directed to pay a compensation of

Rs.250,000/- to the deceased’s family. If he does not pay the compensation,

he has to serve a default sentence of one-year simple imprisonment.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to High Court of Gampaha

along with the original case record.
