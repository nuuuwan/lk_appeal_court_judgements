"Two cardinal rules of logic which governs the use of circumstantial evidence"
"in the criminal trial. (1) The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent"
"with all the approved facts. If it does not, then the inference cannot be drawn."
"(2)  The  proof  of  facts  should  be  such  that  they  exclude  every  reasonable"
"inference  from  them,  save  the  one  to  be  drawn.  If  they  had  not  excluded  the"
"other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the inference"
"sought to be drawn is correct."
