"","sought to be drawn is correct."
"22. In Don Sunny v Attorney General [1988] 2Sri LR 1, it was held:",""
"i.","When  a  charge  is  sought  to  be  proved  by  circumstantial  evidence  the"
"","proved 
items  of 
circumstantial 
evidence  when 
taken 
together  must"
"","irresistibly  point  towards  the  only  inference  that  the  appellant  committed"
"","the offence. On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that"
"","can be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the appellant only."
"ii.","If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference"
"","can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the appellant, then"
"","one  cannot  say  that  the  charges  have  been  proved  beyond  reasonable"
"","doubt."
"iii.","If  upon  a  consideration  of  the  proved  items  of  circumstantial  evidence  if"
"","the  only  evidence  that  can  be  drawn  is  that  the  appellant  committed  the"
"","offence then they can be found guilty."
"iv.","The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the appellant had"
"","the  opportunity  of  committing  the  offence.  The  appellant  can  be  found"
"","guilty only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with"
"","their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence."
