"Pradeep Hettiarachchi, J",""
"","JUDGMENT"
"","1.  The only question to be determined in this appeal is whether the conviction for murder"
"","can be reduced to a culpable homicide not amounting to murder, in light of the evidence"
"","adduced at the trial."
"Background to the appeal:",""
"","2.  The appellant was indicted for committing the murder of his wife Usliyanage Piyaseeli"
"","on  or  about  15.04.2008,  an  offence  punishable  under  section  296  of  the  Penal  Code."
"","When  the  indictment  was  read  out  to  the  accused,  he  pleaded  not  guilty.  The  trial"
"","commenced  before  the  Judge  of  the  High  Court  of  Gampaha.  For  the  prosecution,  5"
"","witnesses testified. The accused made a dock statement and a daughter of the deceased"
"","testified for the defense."
"","3.  At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the accused guilty of"
"","the charge. Accordingly, the accused was convicted and sentenced to death. This appeal"
"","is preferred against the said conviction and sentence."
"","4.  Although there were several grounds of appeal, during the argument, the counsel for the"
"","accused  informed  that  he  would  only  contest  the  conviction  for  murder  as  there  was"
"","sufficient evidence to reduce the charge to culpable homicide not amounting to murder"
"","committed under grave and sudden provocation."
"5.","It  must  be  noted  that  in  his  dock  statement,  the  accused  admitted  the  cutting  of  the"
"","deceased  neck  by  using  a  bread  knife,  but  stated  that  it  was  done  under  grave  and"
"","sudden  provocation  as  the  deceased  was  with  her  paramour  when  the  accused  came"
"","home."
"","6.  Hence,  the  issue  of  paramount  importance  to  be  determined  in  the  present  appeal  is"
"","whether  the  circumstances  under  which  the  accused  causing  injuries  to  the  deceased"
"","would be sufficient to infer that it was done under grave and sudden provocation."
