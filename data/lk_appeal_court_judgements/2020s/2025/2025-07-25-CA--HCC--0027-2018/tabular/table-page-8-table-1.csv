"","to lose self-control. The court emphasized that the provocation must be so severe that it"
"temporarily  deprives 
the  person  of 
their  self-control, 
leading 
them","to  commit  an"
"unlawful act resulting in death.",""
"","30. As  stated  earlier,  this  appeal  was  argued  on  a  limited  ground,  namely,  whether  the"
"","offence of murder could be reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, on"
"the basis that the appellant acted under sudden and grave provocation.",""
"","31. Once  the  prosecution  has  proved  the  charges  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the  burden"
"","shifts  to  the  accused  to  establish  any  exceptions  upon  which  he  relies.  In  the  present"
"","case,  it  was  argued  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"failed to properly evaluate the appellantâ€™s dock statement and erred in rejecting it.",""
"","32. In  the  judgment  dated  02.02.2018,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  duly  considered"
"","the dock statement and clearly explained why it was devoid of truth. Furthermore, the"
"","learned Judge concluded that no sufficient evidence had been presented to establish that"
"the offence was committed under grave and sudden provocation.",""
"","33. In  K.M.  Nanavati  v.  State  of  Maharashtra,  AIR  1962  SC  605,  the  Supreme  Court"
"","discussed the elements to be considered when grave and sudden provocation is pleaded."
"","The  provocation  must  be  both  grave  and  sudden.  The  accused  must  have  acted"
"","immediately upon receiving the provocation, before regaining self-control. There must"
"be  a  genuine 
loss  of  self-control,  and 
the  response  must  be  proportionate 
to","the"
"provocation. If the reaction is excessive or brutal, the court may reject the defence.",""
"34. In 
the 
instant  case,  a  careful  examination  of 
the  evidence  adduced  by  both","the"
"","prosecution  and  the  defence  reveals  that  none  of  the  essential  elements  of  grave  and"
"sudden provocation articulated in the aforesaid authorities have been proved.",""
"","35. The  extent  of  the  injury,  the  brutality  evident  in  the  act,  the  absence  of  evidence"
"","supporting grave and sudden provocation, and, more importantly, the falsity of the dock"
"","statement,  do  not  persuade  me  to  accept  the  arguments  advanced  on  behalf  of  the"
"appellant.",""
"","36. Based  on  the  foregoing  analysis,  the  appellant's  conviction  under  Section  296  of  the"
"","Penal Code and the death sentence imposed by the High Court are found to be justified."
"","There  are  absolutely  no  grounds  for  interference.  Hence,  we  affirm  the  judgment  and"
"sentence of the learned Judge of the High Court of Gampaha.",""
