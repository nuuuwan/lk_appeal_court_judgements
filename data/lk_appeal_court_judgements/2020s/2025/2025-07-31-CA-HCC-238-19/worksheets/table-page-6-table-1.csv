"Palitha Fernando former AG , PC (Former Attorney-General) in his book Selected Essays"
"on Criminal Law of Sri Lanka, page 311 states that:"
"â€œAs stated previously, any provocation will not entitle the offender to the protection"
"of the mitigatory plea. It has to be a degree of provocation that would result in a"
"reasonable  person  loosing  his  self  control.  In  deciding  whether  the  provocation"
"measures up to that degree, court would have to examine the provocatory words"
"objectively.  Even  mere  verbal  abuse,  if  sufficiently  provocative,  will  attract  the"
"protection of the mitigatory plea. However in considering whether the provocation"
"given satisfies the requirement necessary to bring it within the exception, court"
"should necessarily consider the education and social standing of the offender. Thus"
"the test used for the purpose is the test of a reasonable average man of the same"
"social  back  ground  and  education  of  the  offender.  Therefore,  in  my  view,  the"
"provocatory statement alleged to have been made should necessarily be considered"
"by court in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused would be entitled to the"
"mitigatory defence of provocation. It is necessary that court considers whether the"
"statement  attributed  to  the  victim  was  sufficiently  provocative  to  provide  the"
"accused of the mitigatory defence so that the offence of murder could be reduced to"
"culpable homicide not amounting to murder."
