"upon the nature or mode of resentment adopted by the person provoked in giving"
"expression to his resentment.‚Äù"
"Based on the aforementioned authority, I now turn to the question of whether there is"
"any evidence of provocation. The postmortem report indicates that the deceased sustained"
"severe  injuries,  particularly  to  the  head  and  neck.  The  medical  officer  confirmed  that"
"these injuries were consistent with the use of a weapon. Notably, the evidence does not"
"demonstrate any abusive or provocative behavior on the part of PW 01 or the deceased at"
"the  time  of  the  incident.  Furthermore,  the  accused  has  not  claimed  that  his  actions"
"resulted from any provocation by either the deceased or PW 01 that led him to lose self-"
"control. It is also significant that the weapon used by the accused was brought with him"
"to the scene and was not picked up from the location."
"Given the above facts, it is evident that the accused cannot rely on the defence of sudden"
"provocation.  The evidence  does  not  indicate  any  provocative conduct on the  part  of  the"
"deceased  or  PW  01  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  Moreover,  there  is  no  suggestion  of  a"
"continued or sustained alteration between the parties prior to the fatal act. Therefore, the"
"accused is not entitled to raise the defence of loss of self-control due to provocation."
"In view of all the findings discussed both herein and earlier, there is no basis to interfere"
"with  the  decision  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge.  The  conclusion  reached  is  well"
"supported by the available evidence and legal principles, leaving no grounds for appellate"
"intervention."
