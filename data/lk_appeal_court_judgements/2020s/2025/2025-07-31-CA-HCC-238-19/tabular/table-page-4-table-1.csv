"Roshantha  Samarasekara,  arrested  the  Appellant  on  14.09.2012  and  recorded  his"
"statement. According to PW 10’s testimony, a cleaver was recovered that night based on"
"information provided by the Appellant. However, PW 01 contradicted this account, stating"
"that  the  cleaver  had  been  found  near  a  banana  tree  and  was  handed  over  to  her  by  a"
"neighbouring woman employed at a garment factory."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  excluded  PW  10’s  evidence  on  that  specific  matter."
"However, the Judge found PW 01’s narrative of the stabbing incident to be consistent and"
"credible, deeming it sufficient to support the conviction of the accused."
