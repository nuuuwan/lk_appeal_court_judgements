"disclosed  information  concerning  item  (1)  and  (4)  and  the  item  (2)  and  (3)  has  not  been"
"disclosed on the basis that it is related to personal information exempted under section 5(1) of"
"the RTI Act. However, it should be noted that Petitioner has not abided by section 31 of RTI"
"Act as the designated officer has not issued a receipt on the acceptance of the appeal and the"
"decision  regarding  the  appeal  was  not  communicated  to  the  1st  Respondent  within  three"
"weeks  as  prescribed  under  section  31(3).  Moreover,  the  decision  of  the  appeal  was  only"
"communicated to the 1st Respondent on 15th of April 2020, which is more than two months as"
"oppose to the three week period prescribed under section 31(3).  Therefore, it is apparent that"
"the Petitioner himself has not  adhered to  the time restrictions in  the Act  and therefore now"
"cannot challenge the decision of the commission on the same ground as the Petitioner has not"
"come to this court with “clean hands”."
