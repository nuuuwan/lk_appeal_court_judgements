"n  the  case  of  Chamara  Samapath  V.  SL  Parliament  (2021)  RTIC  Appeal  No.719/2018,"
"Sampath B Abayakoon, J held;"
"“I am of the view that providing the list of names of the Members of Parliament who"
"have  tendered  their  declaration  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  required  by  law  is  not"
"disclosing  the  information  they  have  provided  in  the  declarations.  I  find  that  the"
"argument advanced on that basis had also been an attempt to frustrate the purposes"
"of the RTI Act."
"Members of Parliament are persons who are elected by the people and maintained by"
"the  people.  They  are  expected  to  abide  by  the  laws  of  the  country  at  all  time  and"
"provide examples for others to follow……"
"….. It is therefore important  for the public to know whether the relevant  authorities"
"have acted as required by law or not. The only way to obtain that information would"
"be by seeking the list of the name of the Members of Parliament who have provided"
"their declarations under the RTI Act.”"
