JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as "the 1st Accused and the 2nd

Accused"), who are brothers, were charged on indictment with the murder of

Wijesekara Pathiranage Sarath on 31st October 2004 at Gatamanne.

At the trial, the prosecution led evidence through 10 witnesses and marked

productions P1-P2, and thereafter closed its case. In defence, the first accused

testified from the witness box, while the second accused made a dock statement

and called three witnesses. Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court

Judge acquitted both Accused on the first and second counts, but found them guilty

on the third count of the indictment and imposed the death sentence on 07.03.2024.

It should be noted that the 1st and 2nd count deals with the unlawful assembly with

a common object, and the 3rd count involves the common intention.

Aggrieved by the aforementioned conviction and sentence, both Accused preferred

this appeal before this Court. The grounds of appeal advanced by the Accused are

as follows:

1. The learned trial judge failed to analyse the defence evidence in accordance

with the criteria established by the apex courts and failed to provide reasons

for rejecting the defence evidence.

2. The learned trial judge failed to consider the alleged doubt regarding the

identification of the 1st Appellant by the deceased.

3. The learned trial judge failed to properly evaluate the circumstantial

evidence in accordance with established legal principles.

Page 4 of 21

4. The learned trial judge failed to adequately assess the existence of a

common intention between the Appellants.

5. The learned trial judge failed to consider the possibility of a third party

committing the offence, as alleged by the Appellants.

6. The judgment and sentence are inconsistent with the evidence presented at

trial, and the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable

doubt.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW1, Samantha Deepika Gamage, the wife of the deceased, passed away on

01.02.2013 prior to the commencement of the trial before the High Court. Her

testimony recorded during the non-summary inquiry was admitted in evidence

pursuant to Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

According to her testimony on 31st October 2004, the deceased returned home

around 7:45 PM and then went to a nearby boutique. At that time, PW1, her

children, and PW2, her mother, were watching the television, and the witness

heard a sound resembling firecrackers coming from outside. PW1 stepped out and

saw the deceased collapse to the ground and uttering, “බුදු සමන්ති ිලක් මට වෙඩි ිබ්බා”

(dying declaration). In the non-summary inquiry, the witness stated that she was

the cousin of Thilak, who is the son of the witness's mother's sister. The deceased

then requested a vehicle, upon which PW2 left to arrange one. At approximately

the same time, PW3, the deceased's uncle and a nearby resident, also arrived at

the scene.

She further stated that after PW2 left the premises, two unidentified individuals

arrived at the house, disconnected the electricity supply, and attempted to shoot

the deceased again. Unable to recognize the assailants, she intervenes by grabbing

the barrel of the gun. The deceased fled toward the front of the house, and she

heard another gunshot, which struck the deceased in the leg. PW1 then brought

the injured person inside and locked the door. Shortly afterwards, PW2 returned

and informed her that both accused had obstructed her from bringing the vehicle.

The police later arrived and transported the deceased to the hospital. She also

Page 5 of 21

mentioned a rumour circulating in the village about an alleged extramarital affair

between the deceased and the accused's sister.

During cross-examination, the witness testified that she was unable to identify

the individual who shot the deceased due to the darkness at the time of the

incident. She further disclosed that the deceased had been in remand for nearly a

year in connection with a robbery, and that multiple cases had been filed against

him in the Magistrate Courts.

When we peruse the evidence of the PW6, the police officer who conducted the

investigation stated that this witness, PW1, had provided a statement during the

investigation, in which she identified several individuals in connection with the

incident. Notably, she named two women as the main suspects in the case.

Therefore, it is pertinent to refer to the evidence given by PW6.

However, PW1 has failed to offer any justification for implicating the individuals

she named in connection with the crime. Her testimony raises serious doubts

about its credibility and prompts concern over whether she is being truthful before

the court or has named the accused and others under dubious circumstances. In

my considered view, by listing multiple individuals as suspects, she appears to

have sought to implicate the accused's family without any legitimate basis.

PW2, Mahanama Gunawardana Amarawati, the mother-in-law of the deceased,

was at the deceased’s residence on 31st October 2004. She stated that the deceased

had left the house at approximately 6:30 p.m. Later, while watching the news

around 8:10 p.m., they heard a sound resembling firecrackers. The deceased then

approached from the direction of the boutique, saying, “සමන්ති මට ිලක් වෙඩි ිබ්බා”

and collapsed near the doorway and asked to get a vehicle. PW2 then went to

Bandarawatta in search of one. On her way, she noticed the first accused near the

boutique with the crowd. Unable to find a vehicle, she returned home, where PW1

informed her that the deceased had died. PW1 also mentioned that during PW2’s

absence, the power had gone out, and the deceased had been shot again by two

unknown people. Later, the police arrived and took the deceased to the hospital.

The witness also stated that the second accused, known as ‘Chandi’, was with the

first accused near the boutique. While she was on her way to find a vehicle, the

second accused told her they would not allow her to bring one. The witness then

questioned the first accused, asking why he had shot the deceased. In response,

he stated, 'ඔවහ් දන්තනෙද වමතැන්ත වෙච්ච සිද්ිය’. She confirmed that the first accused

was known as Thilak, and the second accused was his younger brother.

During cross-examination, the defence asserted that the deceased had been

implicated in multiple criminal cases, including robbery and murder, and cited

specific case numbers to support their claim. In response, the witness

acknowledged that there were several cases filed against the deceased but stated

she had no personal knowledge of the details of those cases. The defence argued

that, due to the numerous cases filed against the deceased, he had many

enemies—a point the witness conceded.

The defence also proposed that there was no lighting in the area where the

shooting occurred. She admitted that the surroundings were dark and that she

was unable to identify anyone. The witness admitted that PW 1 didn't mention the

name of the person who came to shoot in the second instance. When asked by the

defence counsel whether she was aware that there were 5 individuals named

Thilak in the village, she responded that she was not from that area.

PW3, Wijesekara Pathiranage Ariyasena, the uncle of the deceased, was residing

in the neighbouring house and on 31st October 2004, around 8:00 PM, he heard

the sound of a gunshot followed by screaming. He immediately went to the

deceased’s house and saw the deceased lying on the ground in front of the house.

The witness then left to find a vehicle to take the deceased to the hospital. Upon

locating a three-wheeler at Beliatta Park, which belonged to Nande, he was

prevented from using it by the second accused. As a result, the witness attempted

to find another vehicle but was unsuccessful. Then he contacted the police and,

along with PW1 and PW2, transported the deceased to the hospital.

During cross-examination, the witness stated that the shot had happened near the

boutique. Although Nande was reportedly driving the three-wheeler obstructed by

the second accused, he was not called as a witness, and the witness affirmed that

he was alive during the trial. The defence highlighted a contradiction in the

witness’s police statement, where he had claimed to have heard the deceased tell

PW1 that Thilak shot him. The witness also admitted that the place where the

shooting incident had taken place was dark and that there were several

individuals named Thilak living in the village.

PW 04, Jayawardana Pathiranage Babyhami, testified that while she was closing

her boutique at approximately 7:30 p.m., she heard the sound of a firecracker. She

further stated that a bulb inside her boutique was lit, as well as the bulb on the

nearby lamp post. During cross-examination, she stated that she heard the sound

while she was asleep. She observed that the deceased's house was about 90 feet

from her boutique, and the land on either side of the road leading to the house was

in darkness. She also testified that several individuals in the village were known

by the name Thilak.

PW6, Ciryl Ranaweera, Police Officer, stated that on 31st October 2004, he

received information regarding a shooting incident. He then proceeded to the scene

in a private three-wheeler, accompanied by three other officers. The witness then

took steps to have the deceased admitted to the hospital. The witness admitted

that there was no electricity at the time they arrived at the scene of the incident

Page 10 of 21

during the night. He has inspected the crime scene and found 5 parts of a bullet

in Tharunaseva Road and in the corridor of the house.

During cross-examination, the witness stated that he was unable to conduct a

proper investigation at the scene due to poor lighting conditions. He also confirmed

that, at the time, two suspects had been arrested and four others, including both

accused, had surrendered to the Magistrate’s Court. According to him, when he

questioned the PW1, the wife of the deceased person had indicated in her

statement with regard to the six individuals, along with both accused.

PW05, Maximun Fernando, the doctor who conducted the post-mortem

examination on 02.11.2004, identified a total of 16 injuries. Injury No. 01 was

located in the abdominal region, while the remaining injuries were confined to the

left arm and left leg. Based on the nature of the wounds, the doctor opined that

they were caused by distant firing from a smoothbore firearm. PW05 further

testified that Injury No. 01 was necessarily fatal, whereas the other injuries were

not considered to be fatal.

The first accused denied committing the crime and later surrendered to the

Magistrate's Court. It was noted that the deceased had multiple cases filed against

him in the village. The accused also stated that the crime scene lacked lighting.

During cross-examination, he revealed that the deceased was his brother-in-law

and had been involved in an affair with the accused's sister. He further explained

Page 11 of 21

that he had evaded the police out of fear. The second accused stated that, at the

time the offence was taking place, he was in Ambalanthota and denied all the

allegations against him.

In the present case, we note that there is no direct evidence implicating both

accused. The prosecution's case rests entirely on circumstantial evidence.

Therefore, it is essential to examine the legal principles governing the

admissibility and evaluation of circumstantial evidence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Page 25:

“In Sri Lanka, the rule that in order to justify the inference of guilt from

purely circumstantial evidence, the incriminating facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation

on any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt, has been

repeatedly emphasized and applied by our courts. Thus, in a case based

entirely on circumstantial evidence, the fact that the deceased was last seen

alive in the company of the deceased would not of itself justify a conviction,

where the exact time of death is not established, nor would the fact that the

accused subsequently attempted to dispose of a weapon which might have

caused the injuries on the deceased. Again, where the only evidence against

two accused, indicted for murder, was that they had the opportunity of

committing the offence either jointly or individually and that after the

discovery of the body, they absconded and were not apprehended for three

years, the verdict of guilty was held to be unreasonable.”

Emperor v. Browning, 1917 CLJ Volume 18, page 482 at page 483,

DonaldJohnstone, KT, CJ held that;

“In a case like this, in which there is no direct evidence against the prisoner,

but only the kind of evidence that is called circumstantial, you have a two-

fold task: you must first make up your minds as to what portions of the

circumstantial evidence have been established, and then when you have got

that quite clear, you must ask yourselves: Is this sufficient proof? Do the

Page 12 of 21

facts proved exclude the possibility that the deed was done by some other

person? It is not sufficient to say, "If accused is notthe murderer, I know of

no one who is. There is some evidence against him, and none against any

one else. Therefore, I will find him guilty." Such a line of reasoning as this

is unsound, for experience shows that crimes are often committed by

persons unknown who have succeeded in wholly covering their tracks. I

repeat that you must be satisfied that it is impossible that the deceased's

own servant did the deed, and that is impossible it could have been done by

some unknow person, who has vanished and left no clue. This view is, I

think, more in accordance with the authorities and more in accordance with

the traditions of English Law, than that put forward by the learned

Government Advocate which I took to be that you should convict if you think

accused's guilt probable.’

In B.R.R.A. Jagath Pramawansha v. The Attorney General, CA Appeal No.

173/2005, decided on 19.03.2009, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew held that;

“The case for the prosecution depended on circumstantial evidence.

Therefore it is necessary to consider the principles governing cases of

circumstantial evidence. In King v. Abeywicrama, 44 NLR 254 , Soertsz J

remarked thus: “In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence

the Jury must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt

of the accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of this

innocence.”

In King v. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 Kueneman J held thus: “’ in order to

justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence, the

inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused

and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable- hypothesis the

that of his guilt.”

In Podisingho v. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J remarked thus: “That in a case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to tell the Jury that

Page 13 of 21

such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused

and must only be consistent with his guilt.”

Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I

hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to

be drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapably conclusion that the accused committed the offence. When the

evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that can be arrived at is that the accused committed

the murder of Prema Jayawardwene.”

His Lordship Justice Aluwihare, PC, in Junaideen Mohamed Haaris v. Attorney

General, SC Appeal 118/17, Decided on 09.11.2018, held that:

“Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this

appeal, it should be borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on

circumstantial evidence to establish the charges, for the reason that there

were no eyewitnesses to substantiate any of the charges against the

Accused- Appellant. Thus, it was incumbent on the prosecution to establish

that the ‘circumstances’ the prosecution relied on, are consistent only with

the guilt of the accused appellant and not with any other hypothesis.

Regard should be had to a set of principles and rules of prudence, developed

in a series of English decisions, which are now regarded as settled law by

our courts. The two basic principles are ,

i. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved

facts, if it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn.

ii. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable

inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude other

reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the inference

sought to be drawn is correct (per Wa termeyer J. in R vs. Blom 1939 A.D.

188)”

Page 14 of 21

In view of the aforementioned judicial pronouncements, it is clear that the

evidence presented must be both credible and consistent. The circumstances

established should form an unbroken chain of events leading to only one logical

and compelling conclusion: the guilt of the accused. No alternative hypothesis

should reasonably explain the facts. The Court must be satisfied that the

cumulative circumstances are such that they eliminate any reasonable possibility

of the accused's innocence.

In the present case, the prosecution primarily relied on the testimonies of PW1

and PW2. According to both witnesses, the deceased made a dying declaration

stating Thilak as the person who shot him. Before analyzing the evidence

presented before the trial court concerning dying declarations, it is essential to

first examine how our courts have treated such declarations as admissible

evidence.

We are mindful of the opinion expressed by His Lordship H.N.G. Fernando S.P.J.

regarding dying declarations in Queen vs. Anthonypillai 69 NLR 34 on 38 (also

reported in 68 CLW 57)

“Apart from the medical evidence, the second important factor was the

statement made to the Police by the deceased woman. With regard to this

statement the learned Judge gave the following directions:-

" This statement is evidence. The law permits you to take into consideration

this piece of evidence. Usually a witness's evidence is tested by cross-

examination and in this case the deponent is dead. In spite of the fact that

there is no cross- examination because she is dead, still the law permits you

to examine that evidence. It is in the nature of a dying declaration. Examine

that evidence and if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, accept what

has been stated there. Do not forget that there was no other witness to the

incident and the deponent herself is not before you, the law regards her

statement as evidence in regard to the cause of death, and the

circumstances which led to her death.”

Page 15 of 21

In our opinion this direction only instructed the Jury that they could act

upon the deceased's statement. But there was no caution as to the risk of

acting upon the statement of a person who is not a witness at the trial, and

as to the need to consider with special care the question whether the

statement could be accepted as true and accurate.”

This dictum was considered by His Lordship Sisira de Abrew J in Gamini

Mahaarachchi vs. The Attorney General, CA 106/2002, Decided On 22.08.2007,

held that:

“When a dying declaration is sought to be produced as an item of evidence

against an accused person in a criminal trial. the Trial Judge or the jury as

a case may be, must bear in mind on the following weakness;

1. Statement of the deceased person was not made under oath.

2. Statement of the deceased person has not been tested by cross-

examination.vide King vs. Asirivadan Nadar 51 NLR 322 and Justin

Pala vs. Queen 66 NLR 409/

3. That the person who made the dying declaration is not a witness

at the trial.

As there are inherent weaknesses in a dying declaration, which I have

stated above, the trial Judge or the jury, as the case may be, must be

satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the following matters;

A. Whether the deceased in fact made such a statement

B. Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and accurate

C. Whether the statement made by the deceased person could be

accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

D. Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying

declaration can be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

E. Whether the witness is telling the truth.

Page 16 of 21

F. Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged

declaration was made.

G. Whether the deceased was able to identify the assailant.”

(Emphasis added)

We note that it is not necessary to determine whether the deceased was able to

identify the assailant or how he did so, as he cannot be questioned. The key point

is that the deceased has stated that Thilak shot him in his dying declaration.

However, this raises the question: Who is Thilak? Was the deceased referring to

the first accused? If so, how can the Court be certain that the Thilak mentioned in

the dying declaration is indeed the first accused? No evidence led with regard.

Thus Thilak, the name referred to by the deceased, is referred to the 1st accused

was not established by any other witnesses. Thus, the identification of the 1st

accused has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt.

Soon after, the deceased stated that Thilak had shot him, and PW2 went to get a

three-wheeler. At that location, she saw both the first accused, Thilak, and the

second accused present. Upon returning, PW1 informed that two unknown

individuals had come and shot the deceased again. This raises a critical question:

who were these individuals? PW2 had seen both accused among the crowd at the

time of the second shooting. Was it the first accused who returned and fired again,

or were these entirely different individuals? This is a serious and unresolved issue,

which the Learned High Court Judge failed to adequately consider. It is pertinent

to refer to the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.

Page 442 of the brief,

“පැමිණිල්වල් සාක්ි අනුෙ වදෙන ෙරටද මරණකරුට වෙඩි තැබීවමන්ත අනතුරුෙ පළමු හා

This piece of evidence was not led by any of the witnesses.

It is now pertinent to examine the credibility of the evidence given by PW1, who

has stated that the deceased made a dying declaration. According to PW 1, the

deceased stated that "Thilak shot me," and PW2 was present at that time. She

Page 17 of 21

initially claimed that the deceased told her only that Thilak shot him, without

providing further details. However, she later stated that two unknown individuals

came and shot the deceased again.

The second incident reportedly took place inside her residence, where she initially

asserted that she was unable to identify any of the individuals present. However,

she subsequently named six people, including both of the accused. This

contradiction raises significant concerns regarding the reliability of her testimony.

If she truly could not identify anyone, why did she implicate so many individuals?

Moreover, she claimed that despite the darkness, she managed to grasp the barrel

of the firearm—yet she failed to recognize the person wielding it. These

inconsistencies undermine the credibility of her account and merit a thorough

judicial examination. Her decision to name multiple individuals as suspects,

despite her stated inability to identify them, calls her credibility into question.

My understanding is that when the PW 2 went out to bring the vehicle, the 1st

and second accused had stopped her. That would have created a suspicion over the

two accused concerning the killing of the deceased. The learned High Court Judge

erred in failing to recognize that PW1 did not identify any individual during the

second incident, nor did the Court adequately consider the reasons behind PW1's

implication of multiple persons. We note that the Learned High Court Judge has

failed to adequately analyse the evidence of PW 1. In my considered view, the

testimonial trustworthiness of this witness casts serious doubt on whether the

deceased in fact made a dying declaration.

According to PW1, she was familiar with the first accused, who is her cousin.

However, PW1 also stated that she was unable to identify the person involved.

This raises a critical point: if she could not see clearly in the dark, how was she

able to hold the barrel of the gun? This inconsistency warrants further scrutiny.

‘වෙඩි ියන්තන හැදුවව් කව්ද කියා දැක්වක් නැහැ. මම තුෙක්කුවව් බටවේ එල්ලුනා.ඒ

Furthermore, the Learned Judge observed that both accused were present near

the location of the deceased, amidst the crowd, and had obstructed efforts to

transport the deceased to the hospital. Based on this observation, the Judge

concluded that the second accused was involved in the shooting incident.

It is noted that the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the legal principle

of common intention.

Section 32 of the Penal Code refers to the common intention reads as follows,

‘When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the

same manner as if it were done by him alone.’

The applicable principles for common intention are clearly laid down in Raju and

Others v Attorney General (2003) 3 Sri L.R. 116, where it is stated that;

"In the case of King v Assappu 50 N.L.R. 324 Dias, J. sitting with Nagalingam,

J. and Gratiaen, J. held that in a case where the question of common intention

arises the Jury must be directed that –

Page 19 of 21

1. The case of each accused must be considered separately.

2. The accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the act at the time the offence was committed.

3. Common intention must not be confused with same or similar intention

entertained independently of each other.

4. There must be evidence either direct or circumstantial of pre-

arrangement or some other evidence of common intention.

5. The mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offence is

not necessarily evidence of common intention.

Justice Sirimanne in the case of Punchi Banda v The Queen 74 N.L.R.494

refers to the legal principle laid down in King v Assappu (supra) that a common

murderous intention must be shared before a person can be convicted of murder

on an application of section 32 of the Penal Code”

In the case of Somarathne v. The Attorney General, 1986 (1) SLR 217 at page 221,

Moonemalle, J held that;

‘it is necessary for the prosecution to prove two essential ingredients,

namely, a sharing of a common intention by the accused and participation

of the accused in the commission of those offences. It was necessary for the

trial Judge to apply the rule of common intention to the facts of the case.

Where the evidence before the trial Judge was circumstantial, then it was

his duty to pay heed to the principle that the inference of common intention

should not be reached unless it is a necessary inference, an only inference,

an inference from which there is no escape. The learned trial Judge has

been silent on all these important factors relating to the rule of common

intention. He should have considered them along with the evidence in the

case which he should have carefully analysed before coming to any finding

on the question whether the 2nd accused acted in furtherance of a common

intention with the other accused to commit the offences of house breaking

and theft’

Page 20 of 21

This judgement is considered in Athige Don Preeman Melat Silva v The Attorney

General CA/HCC/ 192/2018, decided on 20.06.2022.

The concept of common intention presupposes a premeditated plan, requiring

active participation by all involved at the time of the incident. Mere presence at

the scene does not suffice to establish culpability. In the present case of murder,

the second accused is alleged to have shared the intent to kill alongside the

principal offender. Evidence presented before the trial court indicates that the

second accused obstructed PW2 from using a vehicle to transport the victim to the

hospital. However, the Learned High Court Judge erroneously concluded that both

accused were present at the victim’s residence during the second shooting. This

misapprehension has led to the inference that the second accused’s involvement

confirms his shared murderous intent. It is therefore essential to examine the

relevant portion of the judgment in question.

The trial court was not presented with any evidence indicating that the deceased

had named the second accused in connection with the shooting involving Thilak,

nor was there any testimony placing the second accused at the victim’s residence

during the second shooting. Even assuming he attempted to restrain PW2, that

act alone does not suffice to establish that he shared a common intention to

murder the deceased

I hold that the evidence presented against the second accused, under Section 32 of

the Penal Code for the offence of murder, has not been proven beyond a reasonable

doubt by the prosecution.

Page 21 of 21

There exists reasonable doubt concerning the name 'Thilak' mentioned by the

deceased as referring to the 1st Accused. The prosecution has failed to

substantiate this claim. Consequently, the identification of the 1st Accused has

not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.

We are mindful that in a case of circumstances, evidence of an inference if guilt is

to be drawn, such an inference must be the only irresistible and inescapable

conclusion that the 1st accused committed the offence. In the instant case, we hold

that the prosecution has failed to adduce evidence to establish that the one and

only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that can be arrived at is that the 1st

accused committed the murder of Wijesekara Pathiranage Sarath.

For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed, I set aside the conviction and

sentence imposed on both accused Appellants and acquit them.

Appeal Allowed.
