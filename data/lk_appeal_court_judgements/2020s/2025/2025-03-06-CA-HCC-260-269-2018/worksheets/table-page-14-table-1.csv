"14. Though the 3rd Judge has allowed the evidence of the deceased PW3 given at"
"the High Court of Tangalle as well as the deposition given in the Magistrate Court"
"to be led in evidence, the 4th Judge when delivering the disputed judgment has"
"only referred to/given thought to the evidence given by the deceased PW3 in"
"the High Court of Tangalle and not to the deposition given by such witness in the"
"Magistrate Court. The 4th Judge therefore has acted in total contravention of the"
"order  made  by  the  3rd  Judge,  as  reproduced  above.  Further,  the  prosecution"
"witness no.4 has been recalled and cross-examined by the appellants and the"
"others named as accused subsequent to such witness being examined on behalf"
"of  the  prosecution,  for  the  second  time  after  being  resummoned  to  give"
"evidence  at  the  trial.  The  4th  Judge  delivering  the  disputed  judgment  has"
"therefore come to an erroneous conclusion that the said witness has not been"
"cross-examined  on  behalf  of  the  3rd,  5th,  12th  and  the  15th  accused.  Such"
"circumstances are indicative of the fact that the 4th Judge has failed to evaluate"
"the  evidence  in  total.  Thereby,  causing  serious  prejudice  to  the  accused-"
"appellants."
