Q.N.1.

Q.N.2.

Q.N.3.

A3. In the case stated dated 31.05.2022 following questions

were raised for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

Did the Tax Appeals Commission fall into serious

error, by holding that in terms of the Front-Line

Office Agreement, dated 01.02.1998, entered into

by and between APL CO. PTE LTD and the

Appellant, that the Appellant only receives a

commission-based income, by referring merely to

Articles 3 and 4 of the Front-Line Agreement?

Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in holding

that the Appellant had several sources of income

and that its income was not confined to

Commission income?

More specifically, did the Tax Appeals

Commission err, by failing to duly appreciate

that, in terms of the Front-Line Office Agreement

dated 01.02. 1998, entered between APL CO. PTE

LTD and the Appellant: -

a) the Appellant's income principally consists of

(i) Commission on Outward Freight; (ii)

Commission on Inward Freight (iii)

Transshipment Agency Fees, and (iv) Services

fee, in terms of Article 3, 4 and 6 of the said

Agreement;

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 4|32

Q.N.4.

Q.N.5.

Q.N.6.

Q.N.7.

Without prejudice to the immediately foregoing,

did the Tax Appeals Commission grievously err

by overlooking the important fact that a

substantial portion of the Appellant's income was

transshipment agency fee income?

Whether Did the Tax Appeals Commission fall

into grave error by the non-consideration of

other relevant and important Articles contained

in the said Agreement, especially, Article 6

thereof, read with the Schedule thereto, and by

its failure to construct the said agreement,

compositely and holistically?

By erroneously holding that the Appellant

Company received only 'commission' income, did

the Tax Appeals Commission grievously err by

denying the Appellant, the benefit of the due

application of Section 13(ddd) of the Inland

Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 in respect of the

return of income submitted for the years of

assessment 2014/2015?

Should the Appellant be duly entitled to claim

the exemption on the income received by the

Appellant as 'Transshipment Agency Fees',

amounting to Rs. 112,929,661/-, in as much as

in law, the aforesaid section 13(ddd), excludes

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 5|32

Q.N.8.

Q.N.9.

only "any commission, discount or similar

receipt for any such service rendered in Sri

Lanka and does not?

Did the Commission fail to appreciate the true

nature of the agreement and the schedule

thereto, as well as the transactions, together

with the calculation methodology referred to by

CASA, where it is stated that an agency fee is

fixed rated, as opposed to a commission which

is a variable figure (i.e., different freight rate

from different country to country), which is the

intrinsic characteristic of a 'commission'?

More specifically, did the Commission fail to

appreciate that in terms of Article 6 of the said

Front-Line Office Agreement, read with Schedule

I and II, that governs the relationship between

the parties, it is expressly stipulated that the

Transshipment Agency Fee is paid in terms of a

fixed monetary value per container transferred

as approved and in terms of the rates

determined and published by the Ceylon

Association of Ships' Agent's, which in turn,

clearly establishes the fact that the

transshipment agency fee is a fixed fee per

container and NOT a commission on account of

being calculated by reference to a percentage?;

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 6|32

Q.N.10.

Q.N.11.

Q.N.12.

Did the Tax Appeals Commission fail to

appreciate that the consideration for

transshipment service was paid as a fixed

monetary figure, calculated based on each

container transferred, as opposed to a set

percentage of the value involved, which is a

variable figure, the latter being the intrinsic

characteristic of a 'commission'?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission failed to

appreciate;

a) the transshipment agency fee is a fixed

monetary consideration for each container

transferred and not a "commission", and

therefore, it is legitimate to recognize the

same as a "fee" and not as a "commission"

in the year of Assessment 2014/2015?

b) the intrinsic nature and characteristics of

a "commission" as opposed to the

"transshipment agency fees" payable,

under the Agreement, along with the

nature of the operations engaged by the

Appellant?;

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission grievously

erred in law, by failing to appreciate that the

term "fee" or "commission" is not defined in the

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 7|32

Q.N.13.

Q.N.14.

Q.N.15.

Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006, and thus in

terms ( of the rules of interpretation of statute,

where no definition is provided, the ordinary

dictionary meaning should be used in the

interpretation of the term "Commission"?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission subverted

and/or distorted and/or altered and/or

undermined the plain meaning of the word

"commission" as contained in Section 13(ddd) of

the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006?

Whether the tax appeal commission erred in

law, by misconstruing the provisions of Section

13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act No 10 of 2006,

as amended, by overlooking the fact that the

said section was introduced with the specific

objective of granting tax exemptions/

concessions, to business undertakings, in order

to encourage stimulate the influx of foreign

currency income earnings into the country?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission failed to

appreciate that, the reference to the Appellant's

Company financial controller's letter dated on or

around 24.04.2015, which states as "the

company does not have sales invoice since

Appellant is receiving their income as

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 8|32

Q.N.16.

Q.N.17.

Q.N.18.

commission income only" as well as the

notations contained in the financial statements

of year 2012/2013, cannot be construed as

conclusive evidence that the company receives

only commission income, without holistically

scrutinizing the terms and conditions of the

Front line Agreement and also examining the

actual and true nature and characteristics of

the payment transactions and the method of

calculation of the said income?

Whether If the true and real nature of the

payment transactions were agency fees and not

commissions, can this crucial nature, be

subjugated, obliterated and ignored, by mere, in

vacuo reference to the aforesaid letter only?

In any event, strictly without prejudice to all of

the foregoing, whether the Tax Appeals

Commission erred by failing to appreciate the

entirety of the ingredients in section 13(ddd) of

Act No.10 of 2006, as amended?

If the aforesaid question of law is answered in

the affirmative, whether the Appellant is

therefore, duly entitled, to the exemption from

income tax, as provided for by Section 13(ddd)

of the Inland Revenue Act?

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 9|32

Q.N.20.

Q.N.21.

Q.N.22.

Q.N.19. In the alternative, in the event the aforesaid

question of law is answered in the negative,

whether the Appellant is entitled to claim the

concessionary rate provided for, under and in

terms of Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act?

Did the Tax Appeals Commission err by failing

to consider that the specific shareholding of the

Appellant constituted as; A) 60% local

individual partners; and 40% APL Company (Pte)

Ltd, in the light of the specific definitions for

the terms "subsidiary" and "Associate company"

in Companies No. 07 of 2007?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

purporting to hold that the Appellant Company

is an Associated Company and also a subsidiary

company of a group of companies, and that

hence, the Appellant is not entitled to the

concessionary rate of income tax, set out in

Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of

2006?

Did the Tax Appeals Commission fall into

serious error by concluding that the Appellant

is a subsidiary of APL CO. PTE LTD, without

considering the express definitions contained in

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 10|32

Q.N.23.

Q.N.24.

Q.N.25.

both the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission failed to

appreciate that the terms 'holding company'

and 'subsidiary company', as defined in Part

B(d)(B) of the Second Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act, which states that "for the purpose

of item (B) of paragraph (b), paragraph (c) and

paragraph (d), the expressions "holding

company", "subsidiary company", and "group of

companies" shall have the same respective

meanings which they have in the Companies Act

No. 07 of 2007, and according to the

interpretations in both Companies Act No. 07 of

2007 and Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006,

the Appellant company does not fall under any

category of holding company, a subsidiary

company, or an associate company, of a group

of company?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

holding that the Appellant Company is not

entitled to claim the concessionary rate set out

under Section 59(1) of the Inland Revenue Act?

Whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred by

holding that the Appellant failed to prove with

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 11|32

Q.N.27.

Q.N.26.

relevant documentation, that the purported

undeclared income of Rs.46,500,174/= was a

reimbursement expense and a non-revenue

transaction, which does not clearly fall within

the definition of revenue?

Whether the Tax Appeal commission failed to

appreciate that the Agreement dated 1.08.2001,

entered into between APL Logistics Ltd and the

Appellant, which clearly establishes that the

Inter Company Operations expenses, is a Re-

imbursement, which read in conjunction with

the Bank statements, justifies the

categorization of the said sum of Rs.

46,500,174/- as a reimbursement expense and

not a revenue?

In the totality of the said legal and factual

positions enumerated and as will be morefully

detailed at the hearing of this case stated, can

the Order of the Tax Appeals Commission dated

08/03/2022, stand in law?

A4. In this appeal following matters to be decided:

a) The appellant is eligible to claim the profit and

income of Rs.112,929,661/- as exempt for tax

under Section 13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act no.

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 12|32

10 of 2006 (Herein after sometimes referred to as

b) Appellant Company is qualified to apply the roots of

income tax applicable to the profit and income as

per the appropriate rates specified in the fifth

schedule in the Act under section 59B of the IRA

c) Undeclared income of Rs. 46,500,174/-

In this appeal, the Respondent, Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, entered appearance through a State Counsel, on the 8th

Proxy at that time. Thereafter on 14.11.2022 only, the

appointment is tendered on behalf of the Respondent. On 3rd

June 2025, both parties agreed to conclude the argument by

written submissions and thus argument concluded. When

glanced the record, it is found that the Appellant has furnished

written submissions on 31.08.2023. The Respondent has

furnished the written submissions on 28.03.2024.

claimed that as it is an independent undertaking eligible to apply

for appropriate rate under section 59B of the IRA. This claim was

rejected by the Assessor and the return is not accepted and

issued an assessment.

C2.Having aggrieved by the said Assessment, the tax payer made

an appeal to the CGIR. The appellant made the same agitation

before the CGIR. CGIR by his determination dated 19.06.2018

determined the appeal by confirming the assessment.

C3. The tax payer having not satisfied with the determination of

the CGIR, made an appeal to the TAC. In the appeal before the

TAC the appellant raised the same issues. TAC by its

determination dated 15. 03. 2022 affirmed the determination of

the CGIR and dismissed the appeal.

C4. In the determination of the TAC, the commission has

concluded that the APL LANKA (Pvt) Limited only receiving

commission as its profit and income as per the agreement

marked as annexure 1. The TAC has accepted the several

materials shown by the CGIR to the effect that the tax payer only

receiving commission income.

C5. In respect of the qualification to claim tax exemption under

section 59 B of IRA, the TAC has accepted the CGIR’s position

ownership of shares and etc.

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 14|32

C6. Questions of law no.1, 2, 3 (a), 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11(a), 11(b),

12, 13, 14, 15,16, 17,and 18 are all in respect of profits and

income, commission and Section 13 (ddd) of IRA. Therefore, all

these questions are taken together for analysis and the analysis

as follows;

C7. The Tax payer submits its return for the assessment year

2014/ 2015 and claim tax exemption of Rs. 112,929,661/- under

section 13 (ddd) of IRA, appropriate rates of tax under section 59

(B) of the IRA. In the return profits and income of the tax payer

are identified as

I. Commission on outward freight

II. Commission on inward freight, and

III. Transshipment agency fee

But it is noted that, when the tax payer submits its return

for 2012/2013, had identified, its profits and income as

commission only.

C8

his principal, the ports authority may retain or arrest

the vessel until these charges are paid, in terms of

section 40 of the SLPA Act no. 51 of 1979.

Article 6 speaks about the remuneration. In consideration of the

services rendered by the APL, the principal pays remuneration as

provided in Schedule 1, 2 of the agreement. According to the

clause 1 of Schedule 1, the remuneration is tariff of agency fees

/commissions for vessels.

Above wording and the pattern of the words in the agreement

or partnership outside Sri Lanka, other than any

commission, discount or similar receipt for any such

service rendered in Sri Lanka, if such profits and

income (less such amount, if any, expended outside Sri

Lanka as is considered by the Commissioner-General to

be reasonable expenses) are remitted to Sri Lanka

through a bank”

SECTION 13 (ddd) OF IRA

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 26|32

C9(b).Further, section 13 (ddd) of IRA grant exemptions to the

profit and income other than commission discount or similar

receipt. Some of the income received by APL (Lanka) PVT are

agency fees which can be considered as similar receipts to

commission. Therefore, that income as agency fee can be

excluded for tax exemptions.

C9(c).Department of Inland Revenue (Herein after sometimes

referred to as IRD) sought clarification from the tax payer and

call for documentary evidence to prove that they have received

agency fees/ transshipment fees. The tax payer by the letter of

the financial controller of the APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited dated

24/04/2015 informed that they have no invoices as they are

receiving commission only.

C9(d).The tax payer has no documentary evidence to show that

they have received different categories of profit and income other

than the commission. (This is at the Inland Revenue level)

Guillain Vs Commissioner of Income Tax 51 NLR 241

This case clearly states that the burden of proof of an

assesse to prove that the assessment is incorrect is on

the assesse. Section 140(5) of the Income Tax Act of

2000 states this clearly, the said case states that the

assesse “took grave responsibility in not producing

(like this instant Appellant) materials which would

undoubtedly have been of great value for the purpose of

forming the assessor’s opinion. In the circumstances

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 27|32

the assessor was not bound by the strict rules of

evidence and was entitled to make an assessment

according to his judgment.”

Short of materials also press the Inland Revenue to decide

negatively.

Therefore, the conclusion that the tax payer is not entitled

to the tax exemption is correct.

C10. Questions of law No.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 are all in

respect of status of the company, section 59 (B) of IRA. Therefore,

all these questions are taken together for analysis and the

analysis as follows;

C10(a).

Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 reads as

follows;

59(B)(1) – The profits and income of any person (not being

the holding company, a subsidiary company, or an

associate company of a group of companies) for any year of

assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2011, from any

undertaking referred to in subsection (2) shall, not

withstanding anything to the contrary in any other

provisions of this Act, be chargeable with income tax at the

appropriate rate specified in the fifth schedule to this Act.

SECTION 59 (B) OF IRA

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 28|32

59(B)(2) – For the purpose of this section “undertaking” in

relation to any year of assessment means any undertaking-

(a) Engaged in the manufacture of any article or

in the provision of any service and

(b) The turnover of such undertaking (other than

from the sale of any capital asset) for that

year of assessment-

(i) being any year of assessment commencing on or

after April 1, 2011 but prior to April 1, 2013, does

not exceed three hundred million rupees;

(ii) being any year of assessment commencing on or

after April 1, 2013, does not exceed five hundred

million rupees;

C10(b).

The companies Act as defined companies in several categories.

Holding company is defined as a company deemed to be another

company’s holding company if an only other company is its

subsidiary.

Subsidiary is defined if the other companies either

I. controls the compositions of its board of directors

DEFINITION

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 29|32

II. Is in a position to exercise or control the exercise of more

than half the maximum number of votes that can be

exercised at a meeting of the company.

III. Hold more than half of the issued shares of the company

other than shares that carry no right to participate

beyond a specified amount in a distribution of profit or

capital

IV. Is entitle to receive more than half of every dividend paid

on shares issued by the company, other than shares that

carry no right to participate beyond the specified amount

in a distribution of profit or capital.

Associates Company is a company over which an investing

company has a significant influence and which neither a

subsidiary of the investing company no is a joint venture of which

the investing company is a partner.

C10(c).

The second point is that what is the status of the APL Lanka (Pvt)

Limited? It has been admitted that APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited has

declared that they own 40% of the APL Singapore. A company

that has significant interest is an associate company. In the

financial statements, APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited is identified as

investor of APL Logistics. The Appellant failed to produce

material to show their eligibility to claim appropriate rates.

APPROPRIATE RATE

__________________________________________________________________________________ Judgment CA Tax No. 29/2022 Page 30|32

Therefore, it is clear that the APL Lanka (Pvt) Limited is an

associates company and not entitled for appropriate rates

under section 59(B) of IRA.

C11. Questions of law 25, 26, and 27 are all in respect of

undeclared income. Therefore, all these questions are taken

together for analysis and the analysis as follows;

C11 (a).

The TAC has held that the tax payer has failed to declare certain

income amount to Rs. 46,500, 174/-. The contention of the tax

payer is that those are operation expenses. But the position of

the TAC is that the tax payer failed to furnished materials to

prove their claim before the CGIR. Accordingly, the said amount

has been considered as undeclared income.

D.

For the reasons adumbrated above, the questions of law are

answered as follows;

1. No.

2. No.

3. (a) No.

4. No.

5. No.

6. No.

7. No.
