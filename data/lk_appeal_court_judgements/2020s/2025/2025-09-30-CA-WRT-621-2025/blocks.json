However, I take the view that facts involving such jurisdictional and other objections, which relate to the maintainability of the application, could be determined after giving due consideration to the relevant laws, Statutes, Gazettes, the provisions of the Constitution of the 3rd Respondent, and the other circumstances of this case based on the affidavits, at a final hearing and not based on the statements of limited objections.
