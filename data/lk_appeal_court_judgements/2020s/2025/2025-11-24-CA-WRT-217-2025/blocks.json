As per the submissions of the Petitioner and the Respondents, it transpires that the bone of contention between the parties is that, the determination with regard to the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of Gaviscon and its effect on at which price the said product could be marketed in Sri Lanka. The Petitioner has contended that maximum retail price is not a critical aspect of renewal of registration. The Respondents have advanced the counter argument that, it is in fact an essential aspect which should be taken into consideration by the NMRA at the point of consideration of renewal. In order to resolve this issue, it would be useful to consider the relevant provisions of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act No. 05 of 2015.

I am of the view that the Court of Appeal of this country would not have intended such a consequence arising from the interim order in issue which may have had disastrous consequences vis-\u00e0-vis the health sector of Sri Lanka. If medicines are not registered, import licences also could not be issued which means these medicines cannot be imported to the country. In my view such a situation would defeat the very objects of the NMRA as adumbrated in Sec 3 (a) of the NMRA Act which specifically state that the said Authority should ensure the availability of efficacious, safe and good quality medicine to the general public at affordable prices.",

Although the said application is dated 24th June 2024, it was submitted to the NMRA in July of the same year. Even by the date of filing the instant writ application, NMRA had not communicated to the Petitioner any information pertaining to the stay order in CA/WRT/793/2023. This is in spite of the fact that the Petitioner has also submitted two reminders to NMRA marked P26 and P27 for which no response was received nor was the Petitioner ever informed as to whether the renewal application was approved or rejected. No reasons have been given by the Respondents for such failure to communicate. As alluded to elsewhere in this judgment, the legislature has stipulated in the NMRA Act No 5 of 2015, that any refusal to register medicine should be communicated to the applicant with reasons. Such refusal must also be published in the Government Gazette. Although there\u2019s no similar provision with regard to refusal for renewal of registration, I am of the view that even with regard to renewals; any refusal must be communicated to the applicant with reasons.
