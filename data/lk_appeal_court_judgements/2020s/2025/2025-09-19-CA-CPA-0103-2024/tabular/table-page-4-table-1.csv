"9)  As 
stated","in  Vanik 
Incorporation  Ltd  vs.  Jayasekare 
[1997]  2  Sri  LR  365,"
"","revisionary  powers  should  be  exercised  where  a  miscarriage  of  justice  has  occurred"
"","due to  fundamental  rule  of  procedure  being  violated,  but only  when  a  strong  case  is"
"","made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice."
"","10) In Cadermenpulle vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd [2001] 3Sri LR 112, it was held that:"
"","The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre condition for the exercise"
"","of  the  powers  of  revision;  and  absence  of  exceptional  circumstances  in  any"
"","given situation results in refusal of remedies."
"","11) In Dharmarathne & Another vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. & Others [2003] 3 Sri"
"LR  34,  Gamini  Amaratunga","J.  emphasised 
the 
importance  of  establishing 
the"
"","existence of exceptional circumstances as follows:"
"","a.  Existence  of  exceptional  circumstances  is  the  process  by  which  the  court"
"","selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification"
"","should  be  adopted. 
If  such  a  selection  process 
is  not 
there  revisionary"
"","jurisdiction  of  the  court  will  become  a  gateway  of  every  litigant  to  make  a"
"","second  appeal  in  the  garb  of  revision  application  or  to  make  an  appeal  in"
"","situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal."
"","b.  The practice of court is to insist on the existence of exceptional circumstances"
"","for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has"
"","got hardened into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed"
"","12) It is with these legal principles in mind, I shall now consider the present application."
"","13) The exceptional circumstances urged by the Petitioner are as follows:"
"(a)  The","learned  High  Court  Judge  and 
the 
learned  Magistrate  has 
failed 
to"
"","consider  the  Judgments 
in  cases  bearing  No.  SC/SPL/LA  176/2016  dated"
"","27.10.2016  and 
the  Judgment  bearing  No,  CA/86/2009  dated  15.11.2011"
"","where  it was  held that a State cost can  be  imposed  instead of the  fine  and/or"
"","the same can be done even when there is a finding of guilt;"
