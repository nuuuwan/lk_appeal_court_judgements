"and 16.04.2024 of the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla in the case No 84237, and the"
"order No HCRA 11/2024, dated 27.06.2024 of the learned Judge of the High Court of"
"Tangalle to set aside or revised."
"2)  The Petitioner was charged before the Magistrate Court of Walasmulla for possessing"
"10 grams of Cannabis Sativa, which  is an offence punishable under Section 78(5) of"
"the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance."
"3)  When 
the  charge  was  read  out  to  the  Petitioner  on  08.04.2024,  he 
tendered  an"
"unconditional  plea  of  guilty  to the  charge  at the very  first  instance. Accordingly,  the"
"learned  Magistrate  convicted  him  and  imposed  a  fine  of  Rs  8000.00  with  a  default"
"sentence of two-month imprisonment."
"4)  Subsequently,  on  16.04.2024,  an  application  was  made  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner,"
"seeking  to  convert  the  fine  to  a  State  cost  as  the  Petitioner  is  an  army  corporal"
"attached to Sri Lanka Army. But the learned Magistrate was not inclined to allow the"
"application as she had already imposed the fine and the matter was concluded."
"5)  Thereafter,  the  Petitioner  made  an  application 
in  revision 
to  the  High  Court  of"
"Tangalle  seeking  to  have  the  learned  Magistrate’s  Order  set  aside  and  a  State  cost"
"ordered in lieu of the fine, which application was also dismissed by the learned High"
"Court Judge."
"6)  Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge of Tangalle,  the"
"Petitioner  has  filed  the  instant revision  application  seeking  to  have  the  orders of  the"
"High Court of Tangalle and Magistrate court of Walasmulla revised."
"7)  The 
law 
relating 
to 
revision  applications 
is  well  established.  Revision  being  a"
"discretionary 
remedy 
is  available  only  on  proving 
the  existence  of  exceptional"
"circumstances which shocks the conscience of the court."
"8) 
In Wijesingha v. Tharmarathnam Sri Skantha Law Rep. Vol IV page 47 it was held:"
"‘Revision 
is  a  discretionary  remedy  and  will  not  be  available  unless 
the"
"application discloses exceptional circumstances which shock the conscience of"
"the court."
