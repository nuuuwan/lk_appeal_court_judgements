JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) has

been indicted in the High Court in Matara in High Court case number

CRI 142/2017.

The charges in the indictment are as follows;

i. That on or about December 13, 2013, in Matara, within

the jurisdiction of this Court, the appellant procured

Kidalampitiyage Deepthi Chandrika to become a prostitute

within Sri Lanka, and have thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 360A(1) of the Penal Code as

amended by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of

1995 and 16 of 2006.

ii. That on the same date, place, time and in the same

course of transaction as in the first charge, the appellant

procured Arachchige Ganga Kumari to become a prostitute

within Sri Lanka, and have thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 360A(1) of the Penal Code as

Page 3 of 8

amended by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of

1995 and 16 of 2006.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the first charge and acquitted him of the

second. Thereafter, sentenced the appellant as follows; seven years

rigorous imprisonment together with the fine of Rs. 25,000 with a

term of six months rigorous imprisonment, in default.

3. Further, the appellant has been directed to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000

as compensation to PW01 with a term of six months rigorous

imprisonment, in default.

4. The appellant aggrieved by the conviction, disputed judgment together

with the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. PW01 and PW02 had known each other for sometime. On the day in

question, they have been making their way back after attending an

alms-giving ceremony.

6. While they were in transit in Matara, PW02 has informed PW01 about

a potential opportunity to earn an extra income. PW02 has mentioned

that there was a hotel in the Fort in Matara where they could engage

in sexual activity with two men who would be present, for payment.

7. This has implied that they could participate in prostitution to earn

money at the hotel. PW01 has agreed to the idea and thereafter, both

have proceeded to the hotel.

8. The appellant has been managing the hotel as its owner. When PW01

and PW02 arrived at the hotel, PW02 has engaged in a conversation

with the appellant. The appellant has offered them a meal which

PW01 and PW02 have accepted.

9. Following this, the appellant had allegedly informed PW01 and PW02

that two men would arrive at the hotel and that PW01 and PW02

could engage in sexual activity with these men for payment, allowing

them to leave the hotel after the transaction has completed.

10. Sometime later, the appellant had informed PW01 about the arrival of

the men, introduced PW01 to one of them and suggested that she go

into a room with him. PW01 has agreed to engage in sexual activity

with the man for payment.

11. Once they entered the room, the man has revealed that he was an

officer of a raiding party and proceeded to arrest PW01. Subsequently,

both PW02 and the appellant have also been arrested.

Case of the appellant

12. The appellant has maintained that he was familiar with PW02, as she

had previously visited the hotel with male companions and had rented

rooms on multiple occasions. He further maintains that on the day in

question, PW02 had contacted him by phone to inform him that she

was coming to the hotel with another. Upon their arrival, the appellant

has served lunch to both PW01 and PW02.

13. Subsequently, two men have entered the hotel expressing a desire to

rent a room. However, as they were unable to provide valid

identification, the appellant had declined their request.

14. In response to this refusal, the men have identified themselves as

police officers, part of a raiding party, and proceeded to arrest the

appellant. The appellant has vehemently denied the charges brought

against him.

Grounds of appeal

15. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Counsel for the

appellant urged the following grounds of appeal:

i) The versions of PW01, PW02 and PW03 are entirely

contradictory and the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the reasonable doubt which arises in the

prosecution version.

ii) The evidence of PW03 should be considered and evaluated as

evidence of a decoy. However, the learned Trial Judge has

failed to consider the applicable legal principles.

iii) The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that evidence

given by the appellant from the witness box creates a

“reasonable doubt” in the prosecution case.

iv) Without prejudice to the above grounds of appeal and

without conceding that the conviction against the appellant

is lawful, it is respectfully urged that the punishment

imposed on the appellant is excessive.

16. The term “procure” refers to the act of obtaining something, often

through careful effort or by employing specific means.

Page 6 of 8

17. In the context of law, particularly under section 360A of the Penal

Code, procurement carries significant implications, especially when it

involves the exploitation of individuals for the purpose of prostitution.

18. To establish an offence that falls under 360A, the prosecution bears

the responsibility of presenting compelling evidence that demonstrates

the offender’s actions in securing a person’s involvement in

prostitution – whether or not the victim consented to such

involvement. The prosecution must prove both the intent and the

actions of the accused.

19. The prosecution’s narrative suggests that PW02 has proposed to

PW01 the idea of visiting a hotel located in the Fort in Matara. The

purpose of this visit has been to engage in sexual activity with two

men who would be present in the hotel for payment (financial

compensation).

20. Although PW01 has not raised any questions regarding PW02’s

suggestion, she has agreed to accompany her to the hotel without

hesitation.

21. In this context, it is essential to recognize that the primary motivation

for both PW01 and PW02 to go to the particular hotel was the

prospect of engaging in sexual activity with two men for payment. This

arrangement essentially amounts to prostitution.

22. It is also important to note that PW01 and PW02 have arrived at the

specific hotel independently, motivated by prior arrangement or

anticipation of meeting their clients.

23. This decision to engage in sexual activity for payment has been made

solely by PW01 and PW02, reflecting their own actions in the

situation.

Page 7 of 8

24. It is crucial to emphasize that the actions of PW01 and PW02 were not

managed by the appellant. Their arrival at the hotel was a result of

their own planning and initiative, indicating that they were not

pressurized or manipulated into these circumstances. The

expectations they held regarding their clients suggests a voluntary

engagement rather than one imposed upon them.

25. In the circumstances outlined, the appellant has not had the

opportunity to secure the PW01’s and PW02’s involvement in

prostitution.

26. Further, in the case of Rosemary Judy Perera vs Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka [SC APPEAL 154/14] decided on 14.12.2020.

Aluvihara J. stated that,

“As decided in the case of R Vs. Ubolcharoen (Phanda) and

Thonarin (Bhuppa) (2008) [2009] EWCA Crim. 3263 referred to

earlier, a section 52(1) offence (Sexual Offences Act 2003 [UK])

which is similar to that of section 360A(1), cannot be committed

if the complainant (the person) has already been involved in

prostitution, either home or abroad.

I am of the view that the same interpretation as above, is

applicable in the Sri Lankan context as well. In the Penal Code

(Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996, section 360A(1) is placed

under the heading ‘Of kidnapping and abduction’. This

classification also supports the meaning which can be derived

from a plain reading of section 360A(1); that the offence of

procuration is committed where a person who is not a prostitute

is employed anew in prostitution rather than a person who is

already a prostitute.”

27. In light of the matters discussed, the evidence presented by the

prosecution is wholly inadequate to support a conviction of the

appellant of the charges outlined in the indictment.

28. Furthermore, the Court concludes that, given the merit of the

aforementioned ground of appeal, there is no need to consider the

other grounds of appeal.

29. Accordingly, as I am inclined to interfere with the conviction, the

disputed judgment together with the sentencing order, I set aside the

same and acquit the appellant of the charge convicted of.

I make no order regarding costs.

Appeal allowed.
