"aforesaid Section 10(1)(a) compels the purchase and official affixation of a"
"‘security  stamp’  and  prevents  the  relevant  products  from  being  sold  or"
"supplied without a ‘security stamp,’ failing to comply with such Direction"
"shall constitute an offence and entail penalties under the Act. As such, the"
"requirement 
to  purchase  a 
‘security  stamp’  cannot  be 
regarded  as"
"optional  or  voluntary,  but  compulsory.  Accordingly,  the  Court  is  of  the"
"view that the compulsory nature of the above-requirement to purchase a"
"“security  stamp”  takes  the  nature  of  a  tax  or  a 
levy.  However, 
it 
is"
"observed  that  imposition  of  such  requirement  in  the  nature  of  a  tax  or"
"levy  was  not  contemplated  under  Section  10(1)(a)  of  the  Act. 
It 
is"
"observed that Section 10(1)(a) of the Act permits the issuance of general"
"directions 
to  manufacturers  or 
traders 
in 
respect  of 
labelling  and"
"packeting of any goods. However, the aforesaid requirement of affixing a"
"“Security Stamp” as required under Direction P6 cannot be considered as"
"directions 
to  manufacturers  or 
traders 
in 
respect  of 
labelling  and"
"packeting. Because Section 10(1)(a) of the Act does not specifically permit"
"the  Authority  to  make  directions  setting  a  fee  to  be  paid  to  a  service"
"provider  for  the 
issuance  of  such 
'security  stamp’.  However,  even 
if"
"assuming without conceding that said ‘security stamp’ is considered as a"
"mode of labelling under Section 10(1)(a),it is observed that the Authority"
"is not empowered to make directions setting a fee for a service provider"
"for such 'security stamp’ under Section 10 of the Act."
"Further, under Section 10(1)(a) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, the"
"Authority  is  authorised  to  issue  general  directions  to  manufacturers  or"
"traders. 
In  contrast,  Section  10(1)(b)  specifies 
the  authority  on 
the"
"issuance  of  special  directions  which  may  be 
issued 
to  any  class  of"
"manufacturers or traders."
"The impugned Direction P6 has been issued under Section 10(1)(a) of the"
"Act.  The  general  directions  issued  under  such  Section  will  apply  to  all"
"manufacturers  or  traders,  not  to  any  specific  class  of  manufacturers  or"
"traders.  However,  Direction  P6  is  only  applicable  to  a  certain  class  of"
"manufacturers or traders, those who manufacture or import the articles"
"specified in  the Schedule to Direction  P6, i.e. Soft Drinks,  Bottled Water"
"/Bottled Mineral Water, Branded Edible Oil, Toothpaste, All types of Soup,"
