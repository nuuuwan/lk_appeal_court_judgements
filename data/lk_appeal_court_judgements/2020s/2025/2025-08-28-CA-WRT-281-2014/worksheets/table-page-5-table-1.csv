"Respondents. At the meeting held on 13th May 2014, the 3rd Respondent"
"had  informed the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce that the said Direction"
"P6  will  not  be  enforced,  and  compliance  with  such  will  be  voluntary."
"However,  the  Petitioners  claim  that  in  the  absence  of  the withdrawal  of"
"the said Direction P6, there is an imminent risk of its enforcement by the"
"officers  of  the  1st  Respondent  and/or  by  the  public  health  inspectors."
"Further, the Petitioners state that the implementation of the Direction P6"
"is  illegal,  null  and  void  and  of  no  force  or  avail  in  law  for  the  reasons"
"specified 
in  the  Petition.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioners  seek  a  Writ  of"
"Certiorari quashing Direction No. 49 dated 24th February 2014, published"
"in the Gazette Extraordinary bearing No. 1851/1 marked as P6 and a Writ"
"of  Prohibition  prohibiting  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  from  acting 
in"
"pursuance of the aforesaid Direction No. 49."
"When this matter came up for arguments on the 10th of February 2025,"
"both parties concluded their oral submissions. Although the Respondents"
"initially  opposed 
the  application  of 
the  Petitioners,  at 
the  stage  of"
"argument, the State Counsel who appeared for the Respondents took up"
"a neutral stance."
"It  was  revealed  that  a  foreign  company  registered  with  the  Board  of"
"Investment,  called  ‘SICPA,’  had  been  entrusted  to  supply  the  aforesaid"
"security stamps as a service provider as required under Direction P6. The"
"service  provider  ‘SICPA’  had  made  an  application  for  intervention  in  the"
"instant  application  and  subsequently  had  withdrawn 
it.  It  was  further"
"revealed that the said service provider ‘SICPA’ had initiated an arbitration"
"subsequent  to  the  withdrawal  of  the  above 
intervention  application,"
"claiming 
liquidated  damages  against  the  1st  Respondent.  Further,  the"
"award  in  the  aforesaid  arbitration  had  been  issued  in  favour  of  the  said"
"service  provider.  It  was  further  revealed  that  at  present,  the  matter  for"
"enforcement  of 
the  aforesaid  arbitral  award 
is  pending  before 
the"
"Supreme  Court. 
It 
is  observed 
that  under  such  circumstances, 
the"
"Respondents  have  deviated  from  its  original  stance  and  had  taken  up  a"
"neutral stance at the argument stage of the instant matter."
"As  per  Direction  P6,  a  direction  has  been  issued  to  all  manufacturers,"
"distributors,  traders  and  importers  of  the  relevant  products  to  comply"
