"The Petitioners assert that the scheme for implementing the affixation of"
"a  mandatory 
'security  stamp'  as  outlined 
in  Direction  P6 
lacked  the"
"express legislative authority and was enacted without due authority and"
"thus should be considered as ultra vires."
"It  was 
further  submitted  on  behalf  of 
the  Petitioners 
that  such  a"
"compulsory  obligation  to  purchase  the 
‘security  stamp’,  as  mandated"
"under  Direction  P6,  would  have  the  effect  of  indirectly  imposing  a  levy"
