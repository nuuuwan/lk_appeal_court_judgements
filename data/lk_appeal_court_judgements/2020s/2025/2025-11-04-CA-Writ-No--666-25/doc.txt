K. Priyantha Fernando, J. (CA)

The Petitioner, a Grade 1 Principal of Sri Sangamiththa Balika Vidyalaya,

Colombo 10, by the Petition dated 17.06.2025, challenged her sudden transfer

to the Western Province Education Department.

THE POSITION OF THE PETITIONER:

On 09.06.2025, she was informed verbally, and later by letters (P5 and P6), that

she had been transferred pending a preliminary investigation. She had never

been served with a charge sheet, informed of allegations, or called for inquiry,

rendering the process ex parte and contrary to natural justice.

6

She submitted that the 1st Respondent (Zonal Director) had no disciplinary

authority over her and acted ultra vires. The 2nd Respondent, relying on those

unlawful recommendations, issued P5, which merely “assigned” her to the

Provincial Education Department without a post—a step unknown to law and

contrary to the Establishments Code. As a Grade 1 Principal she could only have

been transferred to an equivalent post.

She emphasized that no preliminary investigation had begun, no allegations had

been revealed, and there was no guarantee one would take place. She sought the

investigation report under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2006 (P7, P8).

Appeals were also made to the Governor, the Chief Secretary, and the Provincial

Public Service Commission (P9–P12), but no response had been received.

The Petitioner therefore prayed for writs of certiorari quashing the impugned

letters P5 and P6 and quashing the recommendations of the 1st Respondent,

together with interim relief suspending the transfer and handover until final

determination. She invoked Article 140 of the Constitution, stating that the

decisions were illegal, arbitrary, mala fide, and without jurisdiction.

The Petitioner reiterated that P5 was unlawful. She stressed that she was a Class

1 Principal of the Sri Lanka Principals’ Service, which was an all-island service

7

under the Public Service Commission, and not a Provincial service officer. Her

appointment letters (X4, X5, X6) confirmed this, and the Service Minute of the

Sri Lanka Principals’ Service (X1) required her to serve only as a school Principal.

The Secretary to the Provincial Ministry of Education, she contended, had no

power to transfer her; Gazette No. 1950/47 of 21.01.2016 cited by the

Respondents did not confer transfer powers over the Principals’ Service.

On the merits, she highlighted that the inquiry report (X2) concerned Grade 1

school admissions and explicitly found that admissions were in line with the

relevant circulars. Thus, she should have been exonerated. Instead, the

committee illegally recommended further inquiry and removal. She was never

informed of allegations, never given a charge sheet, and her statement was not

recorded. Thus, it’s a clear violation of natural justice.

The later references in the report to financial and administrative irregularities

(මෙෙ පරීක්ෂණය අතරතුර අනාවරණය වූ කරුණු …) were, she argued, irrelevant and

unsupported by any formal complaint; they had been fabricated to justify her

removal. Report X2, she said, contained no reasoning as to why her continued

presence would obstruct an investigation.

She relied on Section 263 of the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules,

which allowed transfers only under specific circumstances. None applied here,

8

as no disciplinary order had been made and no obstruction had been shown.

Accordingly, she asserted that a strong prima facie case existed and prayed for

notice on the Respondents and a continuation of the status quo order until final

determination.

THE POSITION OF THE RESPONDENTS:

The Respondents argued that the Petitioner’s challenge to P5 and P6 was

misconceived. As a Principal of a Provincial school, she fell under Provincial

authority. They cited Section 03 of the Provincial Council List (9th Schedule to

the Thirteenth Amendment), Appendix III, and Section 32(1)– (2) of the Provincial

Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987 (as amended by Act No. 28 of 1990). They relied on

Gazette No. 2046/8 of 26.03.2018 and Gazette No. 2082/7 of 31.07.2018 (X1),

which, they said, delegated powers over the Principals’ Service to the Secretary

to the Provincial Ministry of Education, thereby giving the 2nd Respondent

authority to issue P5.

They further relied on the Petitioner’s own promotion letter (X5), which, in their

view, acknowledged that she was subject to Provincial administration and

disciplinary control.

They emphasized that P5 had been based on an investigation report (X2) which

found irregularities in student admissions and other malpractices at the school,

9

and which recommended a preliminary inquiry and removal of the Petitioner

from post to prevent obstruction.

They also cited Rule 246(III) of the Western Provincial Council Procedural Rules

(Gazette No. 2364/32 dated 29.12.2023, X3), which permitted removal where

retention might obstruct a preliminary investigation. Thus, the reassignment

was said to have been only a preliminary step, not a disciplinary punishment.

Finally, the Respondents contended that the Petition was premature, as no

formal disciplinary action had yet been taken. Granting interim relief would

obstruct the lawful inquiry process and cause grave administrative

inconvenience. Therefore, they argued, the Petitioner had no prima facie case,

and the application ought to be dismissed in limine.

CONCLUSION:

This Court must decide whether letter P5 is illegal and liable to be quashed. P5

contains the decision by the 2nd respondent-Secretary, Provincial Ministry of

Education and Sports of Western Province, to temporarily assign the Petitioner

to the Western Province Education Department until a preliminary investigation

is concluded.

It is common ground that the Petitioner is in the Principal Service and is serving

as principal in a school which is a provincial school falling under the purview of

the Western Provincial Council.

10

In terms of Item 3 of the Provincial Council List in the 9th Schedule of the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution provides that Education and Educational

Services to the extent set out in Appendix III in which said powers are vested

with the Provincial Council.

Appendix III of the 9th Schedule of the 13th Amendment provides as follows:

“The transfer and disciplinary control of all educational personnel, i.e. Teachers,

Principals and Education Officers belonging to a National Service but serving the

Provincial Authority on secondment will have the right of appeal to the Public

Service Commission. Officers belonging to the Provincial Public Service will have a

right of appeal to the Public Service Commission against dismissal.”

Thus, it is apparent that the Petitioner’s disciplinary control during her service

in the Provincial Council is vested with the Provincial Authorities.

Furthermore, Section 32(1) and 32(2) of the Provincial Council’s Act No. 42 of

1987 as amended provides as follows:

Section 32(1) Subject to the provisions of any other law, the appointment, transfer,

dismissal, and disciplinary control of the provincial public service of each Province

is hereby vested in the Governor of that Province.

Section 32(2) The Governor of a Province may, from time to time, delegate his

powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal, and disciplinary control of office of

the provincial public service of each Province is hereby vested in the Governor of

that Province. (the emphasis was added)

11

The above provision is amended in the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No.

28 of 1990, Section 4 which reads as follows:

“(2A) The Provincial Public Service Commission of a province may, subject to such

conditions as may be prescribed by the Government of that Province, delegate to

the Chief Secretary or any officer of the provincial public service of that Province,

its powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal, and disciplinary control of

officers of the provincial public service. (the emphasis was added)

(2B) Any officer of the provincial public service of a Province aggrieved by any order

made by the Chief Secretary or any officer of the provincial public service of that

Province, to whom the Provincial Public service of that Province has delegated its

powers under the preceding subsection shall have a right of appeal to such

Provincial Public Service Commission”.

The extra ordinary gazette No. 2082/7 published on 31.07.2018 marked as X1

which contains “Order pertaining of powers of the Western Provincial Public

Service under Section 32(2a) of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987 as

amended by the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 28 of 1990”.

At page 5A of the said gazette, under SCHEDULE No. 04, power of transfer

regarding officers of Sri Lanka Principals’ Service are delegated to the

Secretary to the Provincial Ministry of Education.

The impugned letter P5 has been signed by the Secretary to the Provincial

Ministry of Education. Thus, the author of P5 has not acted illegally or in ultra

vires but acted within the powers vested on her.

12

WHETHER THE TRANSFER IS AGAINST THE FINDINGS OF THE

RESPONDENTS:

The learned State Counsel has tendered the alleged report marked as X2, where

the committee has found that School admissions pertaining to year 2025 has

been conducted in accordance with the applicable circulars. It was argued that

if the committee was appointed to investigate a complaint regarding Grade 1

School Admissions, and the committee concludes that school admissions have

been conducted in accordance with the applicable circular, then the petitioner

must be exonerated. However, it has been revealed during the course of the

investigations that the continued retention of the petitioner can obstruct

preliminary investigation of regarding revealed facts.

WHETHER THERE IS VIOLATION OF NTAURAL JUSTICE?

It has been revealed that until the committee report marked X2 tendered to the

Court, the Petitioner has never been informed of any allegation against her. In

fact, X2 itself demonstrate that although the committee has recorded statements

from various persons, no statement has been recorded from the petitioner.

The letter of temporary assigning marked P5 which is the impugned document

also does not reveal any reason or allegation against the petitioner and simply

refers to a preliminary investigation being conducted. However, the complaint

against the petitioner is revealed by X2, viz. regarding irregularities of school

admissions. It is argued that whether a preliminary investigation can be held

with respect to irregularities of school admissions as the committee has already

13

made a contrary finding. However, further matters have been revealed regarding

previous years admissions during the course of the preliminary investigation and

the committee has thus recommended temporary removal of petitioner from her

post since further investigations need to be carried out without possible

obstructions.

It was contended that a formal disciplinary action has been recommended only

for the purpose of transferring the petitioner. No complaints ex facie has been

made by any person regarding the allegations in X2. The complaint that the

committee was tasked was inquiring into alleged illegal school admissions made

by the petitioner.

Section 263 of the PSC Procedural Rules contains rules regarding transferring a

public officer on disciplinary grounds.

Section 263 is reproduced as follows:

“The Disciplinary Authority or the authority with delegated power may

transfer a public officer on disciplinary grounds in the following instances

even without prior notice.

i. Where a disciplinary order has been made with a transfer as punishment

consequent upon the formal disciplinary inquiry held against the officer

concerned.

ii. Although the findings of a preliminary investigation do not warrant the

interdiction of the officer but require that he should not be allowed to

serve in his present duty station.

14

iii. Where it is found on matters revealed either before the beginning, or

in the course of a preliminary investigation or on existing

circumstances that the continued retention of a public officer in service in

his post or at his present duty station may obstruct the conduct of a

preliminary investigation”. (the emphasis was added)

The above third instance was relied upon by the report X2 under

recommendations. It states that considering the revelations, because of the fact

that the petitioner has served as the principal of the school since

24.11.2011, background is created for financial irregularities, and therefore, it

is recommended that, formal preliminary investigation be conducted against the

officer; during such investigation, it is recommended to temporarily remove from

the post of principal as there can be tampering with witnesses and there can be

refusal of parents and teachers giving information and evidence with respect to

the investigation.

Thus, in the above circumstances, it is clear to this Court that the 2nd respondent

has acted within her powers. It has been found during the course of the

preliminary investigation that the continued retention of the petitioner in service

in her post may obstruct the preliminary investigation. Under these

circumstances, it seems that the Respondents have acted reasonably since the

Petitioner is only temporarily assigned to the Department of Education of the

Western Province as retaining her at present duty station which she has

15

Functioned for 14 long years can most probably obstruct the conduct of further

preliminary investigation on new matters elicited during the investigations.

For all the above reasons, the Petitioner has not established a potential arguable

case and accordingly this Court refuse to issue formal notice. The application is

dismissed without costs.
