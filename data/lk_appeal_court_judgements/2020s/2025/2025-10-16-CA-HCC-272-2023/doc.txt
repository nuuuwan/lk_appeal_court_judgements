JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused), along with another,

was indicted before the High Court of Vavuniya on the following counts,

1. On or about 2012.01.19, within the jurisdiction of the Court, the Accused,

using a deadly weapon and committed the offence of Robbery in respect of gold

jewellery in the possession of Kanthiah Muttiah, punishable under Section 383

of the Penal Code, read with Section 32.

2. In the course of the same transaction, on the same date and place, the

Accused, using a deadly weapon and committed the offence of Robbery in

respect of gold jewellery in the possession of Muttiah Parameshwari,

punishable under Section 383 of the Penal Code, read with Section 32.

3. In the course of the same transaction, on the same date and place, the

Accused caused the death of Kanthiah Muttiah and thereby committed the

offence of Murder punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code, read with

Section 32.

Page 3 of 12

4. In the course of the same transaction, on the same date and place, the

Accused caused the death of Muttiah Parameshwari and thereby committed

the offence of Murder punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code, read

with Section 32.

The Prosecution led the evidence through eleven witnesses and marking productions

from P1 to P19, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in their defence, made a

dock statement.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by judgment dated

01.12.2022, found the 1st Accused guilty on all counts. Accordingly, the Court

imposed a sentence of ten years of rigorous imprisonment for each of the 1st and 2nd

counts, and the death penalty for each of the 3rd and 4th counts. The 2nd Accused

was acquitted of all charges.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the 1st Accused

has preferred this appeal to this Court. The following are the grounds of appeal as

pleaded by the Accused;

1. Learned trial judge has seriously flawed with regard to the principles

governing Sec. 27 recoveries;

2. Learned trial judge has erred in law by shifting the burden of proof to the

Appellant;

3. Items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to support the

conviction;

4. Learned trial judge failed to apply the principles governing the evaluation

of circumstantial evidence cases.

The facts and circumstances of the case are as follows,

According to PW 01, Pooranalingam Chandrakala, the daughter of both deceased

persons, they owned and cultivated an agricultural land in Pandari Kulam, where

they also resided. The witness testified that she has two elder brothers and a younger

sister, all of whom are living abroad, while she resides separately with her husband.

It was her evidence that her father, deceased, used a mobile phone registered in the

name of her younger sister, Sasikala.

According to the witness, approximately one month prior to the incident, the 1st and

2nd Accused had been working on the land belonging to the deceased. She further

testified that on the morning of 20.01.2019, a relative informed her that her mother

had been murdered and her father was missing. Upon rushing to her parents’

residence, she found her mother lying on the floor, deceased. Her father’s body was

subsequently discovered on her uncle’s land.

The witness further stated that her father had been wearing three rings, while her

mother possessed four rings, a pair of earrings, a pair of bangles, and a necklace. She

testified that she identified all the aforementioned jewellery at the police station.

During the testimony, PW 14, Nagarasa Chandradevi, the sister-in-law of the

deceased Muttiah Parameshwari, stated that she visited the deceased’s residence

daily. She and the deceased would regularly go to a nearby kovil to light a lamp. On

20.01.2019, when the deceased failed to appear at the kovil as usual, the witness

proceeded to her residence. There, she found the deceased lying on the floor, already

dead, with visible injuries on her body and her jewellery removed by cutting the

middle finger.

According to the witness, the deceased Kandiah Muthaiah was not present at the

scene, and his body was later discovered on a neighbouring property. The Accused

was identified as the individual who had been working at the residence of the

deceased.

Page 5 of 12

PW 06, Buddika Dayal, who served as the Officer-in-Charge of the Omanthai Police

Station at the time of the incident, was the chief investigating officer in this case. He

testified that he received the initial information on 20.01.2019 and proceeded to the

scene, which was the residence of the deceased. Upon arrival, he observed the female

deceased lying on the floor near the kitchen, already deceased. The body of Kandiah

Muthaiah was subsequently recovered from a neighbouring property. He further

noted that the ring fingers of both hands had been severed, and the detached fingers

were found near the body.

He further testified that one Sellaiah Markandu, the father of the deceased woman,

informed him about the two Accused. According to the information provided, on the

day of the incident, the deceased Kandiah Muthaiah had received a phone call from

a Accused and left the house, stating that he was going pig hunting. As both Accused

had previously worked with the deceased, they were arrested on suspicion.an

According to the witness, the call history of the Accused’s mobile phone was examined

through the relevant service provider, and it was revealed that on the day of the

incident, at 5:51 p.m., an outgoing call had been made from the Accused’s mobile to

the phone of the deceased, Kandiah Muthaiah. The witness testified that, pursuant

to the statement made by the Accused, the following items were recovered: three

gents’ rings, four ladies’ rings, two bangles, one necklace, a pair of earrings, two

mobile phones, and an axe.

PW 13, Jeevana Sampath Wijerathna, an officer representing the mobile service

provider, testified that on the day of the incident, at 7:11 p.m., the deceased received

an incoming call from a different mobile number, with a duration of 485 seconds. He

further stated that this call occurred approximately one hour and twenty minutes

after the call allegedly made from the mobile number attributed to the Accused.

According to the Accused, the police initially searched for him at his residence and

found him near a tank while fishing. During the interrogation, he was asked whether

he had committed a murder and was subjected to physical assault, which he denied.

Page 6 of 12

He stated that the police did not take him to any location thereafter and further

claimed that no formal statements were recorded from him, although his signature

was obtained. The Accused asserted that the police did not take him or the others to

recover any productions, nor did they handle or possess any such items themselves.

Further, the Accused denied any involvement in the alleged murder.

In this case, there is no direct evidence against the Accused. This case is solely based

on circumstantial evidence.

Thus, it is pertinent to consider the rules governing the cases of circumstantial

evidence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Page 25:

“In Sri Lanka, the rule that in order to justify the inference of guilt from purely

circumstantial evidence, the incriminating facts must be incompatible with the

innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation on any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt, has been repeatedly emphasized and applied

by our courts. Thus, in a case based entirely on circumstantial evidence, the

fact that the deceased was last seen alive in the company of the deceased would

not of itself justify a conviction, where the exact time of death is not

established, nor would the fact that the accused subsequently attempted to

dispose of a weapon which might have caused the injuries on the deceased.

Again, where the only evidence against two accused, indicted for murder, was

that they had the opportunity of committing the offence either jointly or

individually and that after the discovery of the body, they absconded and were

not apprehended for three years, the verdict of guilty was held to be

unreasonable.”

In B.R.R.A. Jagath Pramawansha v. The Attorney General, CA Appeal No. 173/2005,

decided on 19.03.2009, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew held that;

“The case for the prosecution depended on circumstantial evidence. Therefore

it is necessary to consider the principles governing cases of circumstantial

Page 7 of 12

evidence. In King v. Abeywicrama, 44 NLR 254, Soertsz J remarked thus: “In

order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must be satisfied

that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent

with any reasonable hypothesis of this innocence.”

In King v. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 Kueneman J held thus: “’in order to justify

the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence, the inculpatory facts

must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of

explanation upon any other reasonable-hypothesis the that of his guilt.”

In Podisingho v. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J remarked thus: “That in a case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to tell the Jury that

such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused

and must only be consistent with his guilt.”

Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold

that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be drawn,

such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapably

conclusion that the accused committed the offence. When the evidence adduced

at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and inescapable

conclusion that can be arrived at is that the accused committed the murder of

Prema Jayawardwene.”

His Lordship Justice Aluwihare, PC, in Junaideen Mohamed Haaris v. Attorney

General, SC Appeal 118/17, Decided on 09.11.2018, held that:

“Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this appeal,

it should be borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on

circumstantial evidence to establish the charges, for the reason that there were

no eyewitnesses to substantiate any of the charges against the Accused-

Appellant. Thus, it was incumbent on the prosecution to establish that the

Page 8 of 12

‘circumstances’ the prosecution relied on, are consistent only with the guilt of

the accused appellant and not with any other hypothesis.

Regard should be had to a set of principles and rules of prudence, developed in

a series of English decisions, which are now regarded as settled law by our

courts. The two basic principles are,

i. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the

proved facts, if it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn.

ii. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable

inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude

other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the

inference sought to be drawn is correct (per Watermeyer J. in R vs. Blom

1939 A.D. 188)”

In light of the above judicial pronouncements, what I understand is that the available

evidence should be reliable and the said evidence and the circumstances so proved

must form a chain of events from which the only irresistible and inescapable inference

that the Court can arrive at is about the guilt of the accused that can be said to be

drawn and no other hypothesis against the guilt is possible. The Court must satisfy

itself that various circumstances in the chain of events must be such as to rule out

reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the Accused. We are also mindful that there

is always a duty cast on the Prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

That means, in the words of Lord Denning in Miller vs. Minister of Pensions, 1947

All England Law Reports, p. 372, “Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof

beyond the shadow of doubt. The Law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice.”

Page 9 of 12

By doing so, the Court will be mindful not to let vague or suspicious circumstances

unfairly strengthen the Prosecution’s case.

In the present case, the prosecution primarily relied on the evidence of a telephone

call initiated by the Accused to the deceased, as well as material recovered pursuant

to Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance, given that there were no eyewitnesses

directly implicating the Accused in the death of the deceased.

I am mindful that the deceased had informed one Sellaiah Markandu that the

accused had called him to come to the place. This evidence remained unchallenged

by the Accused.

Since no contradiction was offered, the evidence remains unchallenged and is treated

as uncontradicted evidence.

This concept was considered by Justice H.N.J. Fernando CJ in L.Edrick De Silva v.

L. Chandrdasa de Silva, 40 NLR 169:

“Where the petitioner has led evidence sufficient in law to prove his status, I.E, a

factum probandum, the failure of the respondent to adduce evidence which

contradicts it adds a new factor in favour of the petitioner. There is then an additional

“matter before the Court” which the definition in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance

requires the court to take into account, namely that the evidence led by the petitioner

is uncontradicted. The failure to take account of these circumstances is a non-

direction amounting to a misdirection in law.”

This was corroborated by the call details retrieved from the Accused’s mobile phone.

I hold that this is evidence that the accused called the deceased to come to his place,

similar to the last seen theory. That material point that the Accused called the

deceased to come to the land is not challenged in the cross-examination.

The next piece of evidence comprises jewellery recovered following the Accused’s

statement. These items were identified by PW 01, and further noted that one of the

deceased’s fingers had been severed to remove a ring.

Page 10 of 12

Our courts have considered the impact of Section 27 of the recovery.

Ariyasinghe and Others V Attorney General, 2004 (2) SLR 357, Gamini Amaratunga,

J. Held That;

“The facts discovered by the portions of statements of the accused persons and

their acts of pointing out the places where G/66 notes were found were that the

accused had knowledge that G/66 notes were in the places described and

pointed out by them. How did they know that G/66 notes were in those places?

In order to find out the answer to this question the learned trial Judge has

considered the ways in which the accused could have gained such Knowledge.

According to the analysis, there were three ways in which the accused persons

could have acquired their knowledge about the places where G/66 notes were

found. The following are the three ways.

I. The accused himself concealed those G/66 notes found in the place

where they were found.

II. The accused saw another person concealing the notes in that

place.

III. A person who had seen another person concealing those notes in

that place has told the accused about it.”

Applying the above dictum, the evidence demonstrates that the jewellery belonging

to the deceased was discovered from the accused's statement. The Accused, who had

been employed by the deceased for cultivation work, had contacted the deceased by

telephone and requested him to come. This fact was not denied by the Accused.

Moreover, he failed to challenge this material evidence or offer any explanation in

response.

Page 11 of 12

We also note that the deceased’s fingers had been severed, suggesting that the rings

were removed by cutting them off. This supports the inference that the Accused

concealed the jewellery himself at the location from which it was later recovered.

Our courts have consistently held that when an accused is shown to have knowledge

of items belonging to the deceased—particularly when a witness confirms that the

deceased was wearing the jewellery in question prior to death—the court may

reasonably infer a connection between the accused and the said items. This inference

places a burden on the accused to provide an explanation for his conduct or any

suspicious circumstances surrounding him.

In the present case, the accused’s dock statement merely asserts that he was fishing

when the police arrived, took him to the station, assaulted him, and questioned him.

This account, however, fails to raise any reasonable doubt or offer a credible

explanation for the incriminating circumstances.

I am mindful of the judgment of the Indian case of Saundraraj v. The State of Madya

Pradesh (1954) 55 Cr. L.J.257, it has been held that in cases where murder and

robbery were shown to be part of the same transaction, recent and unexplained

possession of stolen articles, in the absence of circumstances tending to show that the

accused was only a receiver, would not only be presumptive evidence on the charge of

robbery but also on the charge of murder.

The above said case was referred by Sampath B. Abayakoon, J. in HCC/262/16

Kumarasinghe Arachchilage Samantha v. Attorney General.

With the above incriminating evidence, we hold that the inference of guilt must be

the one and only irresistible and inescapably conclusion that can be arrived at is that

the accused committed the murders of Kanthiah Muttiah, and Muttiah

Parameshwari dropped the jewellery which was mentioned in the indictment.

Page 12 of 12

In my opinion, the prosecution has proved the case beyond a Reasonable doubt. For

the above-mentioned reasons, I am not inclined to interfere with the judgment of the

Learned High Court Judge.

Therefore, I'm upholding the judgment, conviction and sentence of the Learned trial

judge dated 01.12.2022.

Appeal dismissed.
