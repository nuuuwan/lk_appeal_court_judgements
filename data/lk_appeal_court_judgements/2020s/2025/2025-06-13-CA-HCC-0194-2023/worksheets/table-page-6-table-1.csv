"10.  The  Learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  has  argued  that  the"
"matters  presented  before  this  Court  by  the 
learned  Presidentâ€™s"
"Counsel  for the appellant were not brought to the  attention of the"
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  during 
the  mitigation  of  sentence."
"Consequently, the Learned High Court Judge was not aware of the"
"arguments now being raised when issuing the disputed sentencing"
"order. That it is important to note that the Learned High Court Judge"
"has 
imposed 
the  mandatory 
sentence  prescribed  by 
statute,"
"therefore  the  sentences  handed  down  are  not  excessive  in  nature,"
"should  this  Court  consider  intervening  in  the  disputed  sentencing"
"order based solely on facts that were only introduced at this stage"
"there  is  a  risk  of  unfair  consequences  for  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge. This could undermine the integrity of the judicial process and"
"set a concerning precedent, suggesting that Appellate Courts might"
"be compelled to reconsider a sentencing order based on information"
"not previously available to the original sentencing court."
