"from the facts and circumstances of each case."
"In The Queen v. Mahatun 61 NLR 540 the court held that:"
"“Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed"
"by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,"
"each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done"
"by him alone. If each of several persons commits a different criminal act"
"each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them"
"is liable for each such as if it were done by him alone."
"To  establish  the  existence  of  a  common  intention  it  is  not  essential  to"
"prove  that  the  criminal  act  was  done  in  concert  pursuant  to  a  pre-"
"arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence without pre-"
"arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the moment”."
