Judgment

1. The accused–appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the appellant”) was indicted before

the High Court of Colombo for possession and trafficking of 3.5 grams of Heroin. At

the trial, eight witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution. The appellant made a

dock statement, and two witnesses also testified in support of the defence.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Judge found the appellant guilty of the

charges and accordingly convicted him. The appellant was thereafter sentenced to life

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred this

appeal.

3. Following are the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant.

a. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider infirmities which cast

doubt on the prosecution case;

b. The learned High Court Judge accepted the evidence of PW1 and PW2 before

considering the defense evidence;

c. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the that the prosecution

could not provide the evidence of custody of productions from 08.02.2017 to

21.03.2017; and

d. The learned High Court Judge failed to apply the same yardstick that he

applied to the prosecution to the defense evidence.

4. According to the prosecution, the raid that led to the arrest of the appellant was

conducted based on information received by PW1 while he was on routine patrol duty

with several police officers, including PW2 to PW10.

5. They left the station on 07.02.2017 at 9.00 a.m. in the Jeep bearing No. 64-1065,

driven by PC 40878 Rewatha. At around 1.20 p.m., they arrested a suspect in

possession of cannabis and handed him over to the Keselwatta Police. According to

PW1, at approximately 6.45 p.m., he received the information that ultimately led to

the arrest of the appellant. The information received was that a person named Oliver,

residing at Aduruppu Veediya, Kadireshan Road, was proceeding towards Jampatah

Street to deliver Heroin to a customer.

6. Around 1.20 p.m., they arrested a suspect in possession of cannabis and handed him

over to the Keselwatta Police. According to PW1, at approximately 6.45 p.m., he

received the information that led to the arrest of the appellant. The information

received was that a person named Oliver, residing at Aduruppu Veediya, Kadireshan

Road, was proceeding towards Jampatah Street to deliver Heroin to a customer.

7. The officers were waiting on Kadireshan Road near the Vellakkani Church when they

observed a person approaching from the opposite direction. Upon stopping and

searching him, they discovered a parcel of heroin concealed beneath his sarong. After

questioning the appellant, they proceeded to search his residence, though nothing

illegal was found therein. Thereafter, the officers, along with the appellant, proceeded

to Sew Gunasekara Pawning Center at Maradana to weigh the substance.

Subsequently, the productions were sealed, and the officers returned to the Aduruppu

Weediya Police Station, where the appellant and the productions were handed over.

8. Subsequently, the appellant together with the productions was produced before the

learned Magistrate of Maligakanda. Upon an application made to the Magistrate, the

productions were referred to the Government Analyst for examination and report.

Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the infirmities which

cast doubt on the prosecution case?

CA/HCC/0214/2019

9. During the cross-examination of PW1, it was revealed that the officers were equipped

with a scale and sealing instruments when they departed on routine patrol. However,

according to PW1, after the arrest of the appellant, they proceeded to Sew Gunasekara

Pawning Shop to weigh the substance, this too occurred at approximately 10.30 p.m.

If the officers had indeed been in possession of a scale, it remains unclear why there

was a need to resort to a pawning shop at that hour merely for weighing the

production. No plausible explanation was forthcoming in this regard.

10. It was also established in evidence that the odometer reading of the vehicle used by

the police team was not recorded by PW1. PW1 stated that the odometer had been out

of order. If that were the case, he should have at least made a contemporaneous note

to that effect. However, the evidence demonstrates that no such entry was made by

PW1, or by any other officer who participated in the raid.

11. It is also evident that prior to the arrest of the appellant, the officers had arrested

another suspect in the Keselwatta area and handed him over to the Keselwatta Police.

It is significant to note that PW1 had not made any entry or note concerning that

arrest. According to PW1, the team left on routine patrol at 9.00 a.m. The arrest in the

Keselwatta area was made at 13.00 hours, and the appellant was subsequently arrested

at 20.00 hours. However, no record or note was made regarding the time at which the

information concerning the appellant was received. There are certain inconsistencies

and discrepancies as to the time spent by the raiding party during that period.

12. In a raid of this nature, it is of paramount importance to maintain notes pertaining to

the important events which led to the arrest. In the present case, there is a significant

time gap between the first arrest and the arrest of the appellant. The prosecution

version is that they were patrolling the area and had communication with their

informants. In the absence of the odometer reading of the vehicle in which they

travelled and accurate notes it is difficult to ascertain the truth of the prosecution

version.

13. The other important fact to be noted is that the raiding party never searched any of the

occupants present at the appellant’s residence. According to the evidence, subsequent

to the arrest they proceeded to the appellant’s residence and conducted a search, but

nothing illegal was found. Strangely, none of the occupants were subjected to a

CA/HCC/0214/2019

5 | P a g e

search. Furthermore, no notes were made with regard to the time at which the

appellant’s residence was searched.

14. This omission further exacerbate the deficiencies in the prosecution’s narrative. In a

proper and diligent search following a narcotics arrest, it is standard procedure to

search not only the suspect's residence but also any individuals present therein, as

they too may be in possession of contraband or may have knowledge of its

whereabouts. The failure to do so, coupled with the absence of any record of the time

at which the appellant’s residence was searched, weakens the reliability of the

investigation and casts further doubt on the integrity of the prosecution’s version of

events.

15. It is also noteworthy that there exists a significant omission in the chain of custody of

the productions. According to the prosecution, the productions were handed over to

the Magistrate’s Court by PC 55637 Balasuriya and were accepted by a production

clerk named T. L. Kosala. However, Kosala did not testify at the trial. Instead, another

production clerk, Konagama (PW15), gave evidence by referring to the production

register maintained during the relevant period. According to PW15, there was no

indication as to whether the seal was intact. Moreover, PW15 was not present when

the productions were handed over to PC Balasuriya, nor was he present when they

were handed over to the court. Thus, the prosecution was unable to establish the

custody of the productions for the period between 08.02.2017 and 21.03.2017.

Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge has erroneously stated that all officers

who handled the productions had testified.

16. The importance of proving the inward journey of the chain of productions was

considered in Witharana Doli Nona vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (CA 19/19), Sisira De

Abrew J., observed that:

“It is a recognized principle that in drug-related cases the prosecution must

prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this principle is

to establish that the productions have not been tampered with. The prosecution

must prove that the productions taken from the accused appellant were

examined by the government analyst. To prove this, the prosecution must prove

CA/HCC/0214/2019

6 | P a g e

all the links of the chain from the time it was taken from the accused-appellant

to the Government Analyst's department.”

17. J.A.N de Silva J., (as he then was) in Perera vs. AG [1998] 1 SLR 378 opined that;

“It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must

prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from proper

custody, without allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no

opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production till they reach the

Analyst. Therefore, it is correct to state that the most important journey is the

inward journey because the final analyst report will depend on that. The

outward journey does not attract the same importance.”

18. In light of the foregoing, the cumulative effect of the procedural irregularities,

omissions, and contradictions in the prosecution evidence creates a serious doubt as to

the credibility of the alleged recovery and the circumstances surrounding the arrest of

the appellant. The lack of contemporaneous notes, the unexplained failure to record

the odometer readings, the conflicting accounts between PW1 and PW2, the decision

to weigh the production at an external location despite allegedly carrying a scale, and

the omission to search the occupants at the appellant’s residence collectively diminish

the reliability of the prosecution’s case. In these circumstances, it would be unsafe to

base a conviction solely on such compromised evidence, and any lingering doubt

must necessarily operate in favour of the appellant.

19. In the case of Anthony Michael Morril vs. Attorney General CA 26/06, decided on

25.05.2010, Sarath De Abrew, J, has stated,

“…In assessing the testimonial trustworthiness of this witness, the learned trial

judge had failed to employ the yardstick of the test of Probability and

Improbability which is a sine qua non in assessing the evidence of a trained

police witness, which teat if it had been property used, would have created

serious doubts as to the credibility of the said police witness. It is a cardinal

rule in our criminal law that every person charged with an offence is entitled

to a fair trial and shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. This

presumption of innocence should be operative until the learned trial judge had

perused and analyzed the entirety of the evidence led in the case, that of the

CA/HCC/0214/2019

7 | P a g e

prosecution as well as that of the defense. Before arriving at a conclusion

whether the chargers are proved beyond reasonable doubt, there is sacred duty

cast on each trial judge to examine the defense evidence, and come to a

conclusion whether a reasonable doubt is generated by the defense, the benefit

of which should necessarily accrue to the accused person. There is an

imperative duty cast on every trial judge to impose separate sentence on each

charge an accused person is found guilty of.

20. It is also significant to note that the learned trial Judge, having analyzed the

prosecution evidence, concluded that a strong case had been established against the

appellant in respect of the two charges set out in the indictment. In my view, however,

this approach is not the most appropriate. The learned trial Judge ought to have

undertaken a holistic analysis, evaluating both the prosecution and defense evidence

together, rather than compartmentalizing the prosecution evidence in isolation.

21. In James Silva vs Republic [1980] (2) Sri L.R., it was held that:

There is a serious misdirection in law. It is a grave error for a trial judge to

direct himself that he must examine the tenability and truthfulness of the

evidence of the accused in the light of the evidence led by the prosecution. To

examine the evidence of the accused in the light of the prosecution witnesses is

to reverse the presumption of innocence.

22. Furthermore, this Court cannot lightly overlook the basis upon which the learned trial

Judge rejected the defence evidence. The observations made by the learned trial Judge

at page 40 of the impugned judgment indicate that he had pre-judged the case even

before analysing the defence evidence. It can also be observed that the testimony of

the defence witnesses, although subjected to cross-examination, does not reveal any

significant inter-se contradictions. While it is true that they are family members of the

appellant, that fact alone should not serve as a ground to reject their testimony unless

there exist inherent improbabilities on the face of their evidence.

23. The appellant’s dock statement was corroborated by the defence witnesses. During

cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, it was put to them that the appellant

had been arrested at his residence and not at Kadireshan Street as alleged by the

CA/HCC/0214/2019

8 | P a g e

prosecution. In the circumstances, the infirmities in the prosecution evidence, when

considered alongside the defence version, undoubtedly cast a reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case. Accordingly, such doubt must be resolved in favour of the appellant.

24. Considering the totality of the evidence, the defence version gains credibility, and at

the very least, a complete rejection of the defence evidence would not be justified.

This is a situation where the defence has successfully created a reasonable doubt in

the prosecution’s version. Specifically, a doubt arises as to the mode of detection and

the manner of recovery as narrated by the prosecution. The Trial Judge failed to

properly appreciate this aspect, which operates in favour of the appellant.

25. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the learned High Court Judge himself

reached the conclusion that the dock statement and the evidence of the defence

witnesses were deliberately designed by the appellant to create doubt with regard to

the prosecution’s case, and hence, the defence version could not be accepted.

26. During the trial, both PW1 and PW6 stated that, while on patrol, they arrested a

suspect with narcotics and handed him over to the Keselwatta Police. However, both

witnesses failed to corroborate that assertion, as no notes or records were made in that

regard. The defence, in cross-examination, emphasized this omission, as it clearly

calls into question the credibility of the testimonies of PW1 and PW6.

27. Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge disregarded this point and concluded that

it had no relevance to the present case, further suggesting that the burden lay upon the

defence to prove the contrary if the arrest was disputed. In my respectful view, this

approach is erroneous in law. When the prosecution asserts a fact but fails to establish

it through credible evidence, the defence cannot be burdened with proving a negative.

The obligation lies upon the prosecution to prove what they allege, and not upon the

accused to disprove what has not been sufficiently established.

28. For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to

establish the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The conviction

entered and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge cannot therefore

CA/HCC/0214/2019

stand. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence are hereby set

aside, and the appellant is acquitted of all charges.
