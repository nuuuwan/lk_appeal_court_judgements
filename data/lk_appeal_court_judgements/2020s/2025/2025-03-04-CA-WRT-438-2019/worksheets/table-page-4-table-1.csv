"The 2nd and the 3rd Respondents state that the amendment inserting the"
"name of the Petitioner reflected in P1 is ab initio void, a nullity and of no"
"force  or  avail 
in 
law.  Upon  a  request  made  by  the  mother  of  the"
"Petitioner, 
to 
the  Divisional 
Secretary  of  Kahatagasdigiliya, 
the  1st"
"Respondent  had  held  an  inquiry  on  13.06.2016,  attended  by  all  parties,"
"and resolved the matter by deciding to divide the subject land among the"
"Petitioner,  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  Respondent  with  the  agreement  of  all"
"parties. Said decision has been notified to the Petitioner, the 2nd and the"
"3rd Respondents by the 1st Respondent by letter dated 01.11.2016 marked"
"P5.  Aggrieved  by  the  said  decision  of  the  1st  Respondent,  the Petitioner"
"had  instituted  the  action  in  the  District  Court  of  Anuradhapura  bearing"
"no.  28421/L  seeking  a  declaration  that  the  Petitioner  be  declared  legal"
"permit holder of the permit marked P1 and letter dated 01.11.2016 [P5]"
"is  issued  against  the  law.  The  learned  District  judge  has  dismissed  the"
"action based on a preliminary objection raised by the 1st Respondent with"
"regard to the maintainability of an action before a primary court against"
"the  administrative  action  of  a  public  officer.  The  Respondents  state  that"
"the Petitioner himself consented to the above division reflected in P5 and"
"belatedly  withdrew  his  consent  based  on  the 
influence  of  his  family"
"members."
"The Respondents state that the Petitioner is guilty of laches, suppression"
"of  material  facts  and  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  come before  the  Court"
"with clean hands, and the application is misconceived of law."
"Alleged Violation of the Condition of the Permit P1"
"It is on the common grounds that the permit bearing no. 433/6/37A had"
"been  issued  to  K.L.A.  Swarnaseeli,  the  mother  of  the  Petitioner,  the  2nd"
"and 3rd Respondents by the District Secretary. As per the entry/annotation"
"dated 01.01.2004 that appears on permit P1, the name of the holder has"
"been  amended  by 
inserting 
the  Petitionerâ€™s  name.  The  2nd  and  3rd"
"Respondents argue that such insertion is illegal and of no force or avail in"
"law.  However, 
it 
is  observed  that  such  an  entry/annotation  has  been"
"signed and stamped by the Additional Divisional Secretary and the permit"
"fees had been paid until 2012 without any impediment. It appears that no"
"one has taken up any objection with regard to such amendment until the"
"institution  of  the  instant  action.  No  acceptable  reason  whatsoever  has"
