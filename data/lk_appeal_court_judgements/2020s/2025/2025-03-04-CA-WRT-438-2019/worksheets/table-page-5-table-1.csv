"been  advanced  by 
the  Respondent  challenging 
the 
legality  of  such"
"insertion."
"The  Divisional  Secretary  has  acknowledged  such  insertion  by  his  letter"
"dated  01.11.2016  marked  P5  and  letter  dated  05.04.2011  marked  P9."
"Hence,  the  1st  Respondent 
is  estopped  from  denying  the 
legality  or"
"existence  of  such 
insertion.  The  1st  Respondent  submits  that  such  an"
"insertion is irregular as the Petitioner has acted in violation of conditions"
"7 and 8 of the permit P1. Said conditions stipulate that any construction,"
"permanent  plantation  or  damage  to  the  trees  in  the  land  could  not  be"
"done  without  prior  written  approval  of  the  Anuradhapura  Divisional"
"Secretary. It is apparent that the annual permit P1 is subject to the terms"
"and conditions therein. Although the said permit may be cancelled upon"
"violation of conditions therein, there are no materials placed before this"
"Court  to  conclude  that  the  conditions  under  the  aforesaid  permit  have"
"been violated or that on such premises the permit P1 has been cancelled."
"It is also observed that the Petitioner has not been informed of any such"
"cancellation  of  permit  P1  owing  to  the  violation  of  conditions  therein"
"while such permit was valid."
"The  Divisional  Secretary  has  observed  violation  of  certain  conditions  of"
"the permit P1 by his letter P5 in the year 2016, long after the expiration of"
"the permit. However, the conditions so violated have not been specified"
"in  the  said 
letter  P5.  The  1st  Respondent  claims  that  the  Petitioner"
"constructed  and  developed  structures  on  the  subject  land  without  prior"
"approval.  However,  upon  perusing  the  documents  marked  P4,  dated"
"09.01.2013,  and  P9,  dated  05.04.2011,  it  is  apparent  that  the  Divisional"
"Secretary  has  consented  to  renting  out  such  structures.  If  the  Divisional"
"Secretary  was  of 
the  opinion 
that 
the  alleged  constructions  were"
"unauthorized,  the  Divisional  Secretary  should  have  taken  appropriate"
"steps to hold an inquiry and cancel the permit at such an instance instead"
"of approving the Petitionerâ€™s request for renting out the building. As such,"
"I am of the view that the Respondents have failed to satisfy this Court that"
"necessary steps have been taken by the Divisional Secretary in view of the"
"alleged  violation  of  the  conditions  of  the  Permit  P1  by  the  Petitioner."
"Accordingly, this Court is not inclined to accept the premise advanced by"
"the  Respondents  that  the  permit 
in  subject  was  cancelled  based  on"
"violation  of  the  conditions  therein. 
It 
is  noted  that  neither  has  the"
"competent  authority  taken  any  steps  to  cancel  the  permit  owing  to"
