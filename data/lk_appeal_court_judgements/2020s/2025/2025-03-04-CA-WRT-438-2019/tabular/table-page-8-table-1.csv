"among the Petitioner, the 2nd and the 3rd Respondent by letter marked P5."
"However,  the  Petitioner  in  his  plaint  of  the  aforesaid  District  Court  case"
"[vide  paragraph  06  of  X2] 
indicates  that  he  withdrew  such  consent"
"granted at a later stage. However, I am of the view that such a withdrawal"
"cannot  be  accepted  without  any  acceptable 
justification.  Hence 
the"
"Petitioner is not entitled to claim relief based on legitimate expectation as"
"averred in the Petition."
"The Divisional Secretary has inquired into the matter after the expiration"
"of the validity of the annual permit in 2012. By such time the Petitioner"
"was  not  the  lawful  permit  holder.  The  request  for  the  division  of  the"
"subject  land  made  by  the  original  permit  holder,  i.e.  the  mother  of  the"
"Petitioner,  had  been  considered  and  determined  by  the  1st  Respondent"
"with the agreement of all necessary parties within authority. Accordingly, I"
"see  no 
illegality, 
irrationality  or  arbitrary  act  on  the  part  of  the  1st"
"Respondent to divide the rights over the subject land among the siblings."
"Suppression of material facts."
"It  is  observed  that  the  Petitioner  has  suppressed  the  fact  that  he  has"
"consented  to  division  of  the  subject  land  on  his mother’s  request  as  far"
"back  as 
in  2013  and  withdrew  the  same 
later  until  the  Respondents"
"disclosed the same. The Petitioner failed to disclose the outcome of the"
"above  District  Court  case  to  this  Court.  The  petitioner  has  failed  to"
"disclose  that  the  decision  in  letter  P5  had  been  reached  pursuant  to  an"
"inquiry that included the participation of all relevant parties. In my view,"
"those are  very material facts  in determining the instant application.  It is"
"settled law that the party who is seeking prerogative relief should come"
"to court with clean hands. It is the duty of such person to disclose all the"
"material  facts  before  the  Court  at  the  very  outset.  Material  facts  are"
"essential for the Judge to consider in evaluating the application. The Court"
"alone  determines  what  constitutes  material  and  this  assessment  is  not"
"based on the opinions of the applicant or their legal advisers."
"In Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi (1973) 77 NLR 131 at 135 stressed"
"on the necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be"
"placed  before  the  Court  when  an  application  for  a  writ  of  injunction  is"
"made.  At  page  136  it  was  held  that  “In  other  words,  so  rigorous  is  the"
"necessity for a full and fair disclosure of all material facts that the Court"
