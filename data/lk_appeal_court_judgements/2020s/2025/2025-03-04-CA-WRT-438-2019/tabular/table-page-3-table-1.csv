"subject 
land  by  constructing  a  commercial  building  and  enjoying  the"
"undisturbed  and  uninterrupted  possession  over  10  years.  The  Petitioner"
"had  paid  permit  renewal  fees,  rates  and  other  charges  concerning  the"
"subject land since 01.01.2004. In 2013, the 1st Respondent informed the"
"Petitioner  to  obtain  a 
long-term  commercial  permit 
for  the 
land 
in"
"dispute.  The  Petitioner  continued  to  possess  and  develop  the  land  in"
"good 
faith,  believing  a 
long-term  permit  would  be  granted 
for 
the"
"disputed land. However, despite the Petitioner's legitimate expectations,"
"the  1st  Respondent  had  informed  the  Petitioner  by  letter  dated  01.11."
"2016 [P5] that the permit for the land in dispute will be granted to the 2nd"
"and  the  3rd  Respondents  as  well.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  states  that"
"the decision reflected in document P5 is illegal, unfair, unreasonable and"
"capricious.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioner 
invokes  the 
jurisdiction  of  this"
"Court by way of Writ application seeking inter alia in the nature of Writ of"
"Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to issue the permit"
"to the 2nd and the 3rd Respondents as reflected in the document marked"
"P5  and  Writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st  Respondent  to 
issue  the"
"permit to the Petitioner."
"The  1st  Respondent  states  that  the  change  of  the  permit  holder's  name"
"appearing  on  the  permit  [P1]  is  irregular  as  there  are  violations  of  the"
"conditions  attached  to  the  permit,  specifically  conditions  7  and  8.  It  is"
"claimed that the Petitioner has failed to substantiate  with  evidence, the"
"fact 
that 
the 
Petitioner 
has 
obtained 
relevant 
approval 
for 
the"
"constructions made on the subject land. Accordingly, the 1st Respondent"
"submits that such constructions are unauthorized and the permit is liable"
"to be cancelled owing to violation of any condition therein. The Petitioner"
"has only paid the permit renewal fees until 2012. Hence, it is claimed that"
"there has been no renewal of the permit thereafter. The 1st Respondent"
"further  states  that  the  annual  permit  was  cancelled  by  letter  P5  due  to"
"violation  of permit conditions. Accordingly,  the 1st Respondent advances"
"the  position  that  the  long-term  possession  of  the  subject  land  does  not"
"give rise to a right to the Petitioner for a long-term permit. It has further"
"been  submitted  that  an  inquiry  had  been  held  in  2013  when  the  initial"
"permit  holder,  the  Petitioner’s  mother,  was  alive.  The  1st  Respondent"
"states that the subject land was divided between the three male siblings,"
"i.e. the Petitioner, the 2nd and the 3rd Respondents, in agreement with the"
"parties and as per the wish of the Petitioner’s mother and all the siblings."
