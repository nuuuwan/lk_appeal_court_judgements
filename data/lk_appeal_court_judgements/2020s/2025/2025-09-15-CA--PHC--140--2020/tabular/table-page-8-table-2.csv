"settlement  entered 
into  on  25.07.2018  at 
the  Fore  Shore  Police  Station  between"
"Gunawardana  Bandara, 
the  General  Manager  of 
the  Cooperative  Society,  and"
"Appellant, the learned High Court Judge, upon analysing the facts, observed:"
"“It  could  be  observed  that  the  said  settlement does not refer to a particular"
"part of the building, but covers the entire premises. Had the petitioner been in"
"possession  of  part  A  of  the  building  as  alleged  in  the  affidavit,  he  could  not"
"have  consented for  the  said  settlement. The  above  fact  alone  is  sufficient  to"
"infer that the Petitioner although stated that he had purchased the building in"
"dispute  by  deed  No  4212  on  19.07.2018,  he  was  never  in  possession  of  the"
"same.  Hence, 
it 
is  evident  that  the  Petitioner  was  not  handed  over  the"
"possession of the property by the vendor of deed No 4212.”"
