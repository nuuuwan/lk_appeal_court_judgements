"D. Thotawatte, J."
"This is an appeal from a judgment of the Provincial High Court holden at Colombo in the"
"exercise  of  its  revisionary  jurisdiction  under  Article  154  P  (3) (b) of the  Constitution.  By"
"the 
impugned 
judgment,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  dismissed  the  revision"
"application filed against an order of the learned Additional Magistrate of Colombo made"
"in terms of section 68 of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"The  Officer-in-Charge  of  Police  Station  Foreshore  had  filed  information  on  13th  August"
"2018 in terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979"
"(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “PCPA”)  in the Magistrate’s Court of Colombo,"
"reporting  a  dispute  between  the  1st  Party-Petitioner-Appellant  (hereinafter  sometimes"
"referred  to  as  the  “Appellant”)  and  the  2nd  Party-Respondent-Respondent  (hereinafter"
"sometimes  referred  to  as  the  “Respondent”)  regarding  the  possession  of  premises"
"No.145  Jampettah,  street  Colombo  13  (a  commercial  building  which  appear  to  have"
"consisted of two parts and for reasons not quite clear has sometimes been described as"
"“A  Pradeshikaya”  and  “B  Pradeshikaya”.    However,  for  reasons  of  clarity,  I  will  refer  to"
"them respectively as part A and part B under case bearing No. 97974/2018."
"At  the  conclusion  of  the 
inquiry  conducted  under  the  PCPA,  the 
learned  Magistrate"
"delivered  her  order  on  the  3rd  April  2019,  concluding  that  the  Respondent  had  been"
"dispossessed  by  the  Appellant  from  the  relevant  part  (part  A)  of  the  disputed  premises"
"and therefore ordered that the Respondent be restored to possession under section 68(3)"
"of the Primary Courts Act."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  learned  Magistrate's  order,  the  Appellant  preferred  a  revision"
"application  to  the  provincial  High  Court  of  the  Western  Province  holden  in  Colombo"
"under  HCRA  67/2019.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  delivering  his  Judgement  on  30th"
"September 2020 had dismissed the application, deciding that it was not a fit and proper"
"case in which the court should exercise its revisionary powers."
"Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellant has"
"appealed to the Court of Appeal, challenging the said judgments of the High Court and"
"the Magistrate's Court."
