"The version of events according to the Appellant is that by deed No 4212 dated 19-07-"
"2018,  he  purchased  the  disputed  premises,  which  comprised  two  sections,  designated"
"part  A  and  part  B,  from  a  person  named  Jayantha  Rodrigo.  The  appellant  has  further"
"stated  that  although  he  has  received  vacant  possession  from  Jayantha  Rodrigo,  it  was"
"known  that  previously  the  Respondent  had  been  operating  a  retail  shop  called  Co-op"
"Shop in part “B” of the premises, while Jayantha Rodrigo was in possession of the rest of"
"the building, which is mentioned as part “A”."
"Appellant claims that on 22-07-2018, the Respondent entered part “B” with some others"
"and  attempted 
to  carry  out  some  construction  activities.  Although  he 
(Appellant)"
"prevented  this,  the  Respondent  and  three  others  continued  to 
illegally  occupy  this"
"section.  Further,  the  complaint  made  by  the  Respondent  dated  10-08-2018  that  the"
"Respondent was dispossessed by him is completely false."
"Analysis of the relative positions"
"On perusal of the nature of evidence presented at the Magistrate Court, it appears that"
"the  Respondent  has  produced  overwhelming  evidence  to  establish  that  he  was 
in"
"possession of not only part A of the premises but the entirety of the premises."
