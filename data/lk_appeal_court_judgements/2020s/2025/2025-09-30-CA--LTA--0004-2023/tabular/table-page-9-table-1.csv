"under the Muslim law governing the sect to which the parties belong, the procedure laid down in"
"the Third Schedule shall be followed,”"
"Khula is another form of divorce where the wife initiates the divorce and offers to return the Mahr"
"or the dowry that was provided to the wife by the husband in exchange for her release from the"
"marriage. Mubarah refers to divorce by mutual consent of both parties. These two forms of divorce"
"fall within the ambit of Section 28(2) of the MMDA as reproduced below;"
"“28. (2) Where a wife desires to effect a divorce from her husband on any ground not referred to"
"in  subsection  (1),  being  a  divorce  of  any  description  permitted  to  a  wife  by  the  Muslim  law"
"governing the sect to which the parties belong, the procedure laid down in the Third Schedule shall"
"be followed so far as the nature of the divorce claimed in each case renders it possible or necessary"
"to follow that procedure.”"
"The issue before the Quazi"
"In this  case,  the only question  before  the Quazi  is  whether the wife (Respondent) is  entitled to"
"obtain a Fasah divorce, instead of a Mubarah divorce, which she has never sought from the very"
"inception of the proceedings that she has initiated as way back as in the year 2019. However, from"
"the beginning, the husband never wanted a divorce, and in fact wanted to reconcile with the wife,"
"which is reflected in his original letter referred to as Y6, and thereafter in the affidavit filed as Y8,"
"where he has consented to a Mubarah divorce instead of a Fasah divorce. Therefore, the question"
"arises whether the wife is entitled to a Fasah divorce, instead of a Mubarah divorce, although both"
"can be obtained by the wife."
"I will discuss the reasons as to why Fasah divorce is important for the wife in this case. In addition"
"to that, I will also advert on as to why the wife is entitled to a Fasah divorce instead of a Mubarah"
"divorce, and the importance thereof."
