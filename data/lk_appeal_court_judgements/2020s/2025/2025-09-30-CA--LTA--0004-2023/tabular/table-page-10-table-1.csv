"In addition to that, I further discuss whether she is entitled to maintain an application for a Fasah"
"divorce. Subsequently, the next question arises whether the original Quazi who granted a Mubarah"
"divorce instead of a Fasah divorce has erred in fact and in law. Consequently, requiring this Court"
"to decide whether the Board of Quazi is right or erred in fact and in law, when they decided to set"
"aside the Mubarah divorce granted to the wife instead of the Fasah divorce and send the case back"
"to the Quazi to reconsider the evidence on the basis for a Fasah divorce."
"Fasah divorce"
"Fasah divorce is a religious divorce which an innocent wife can obtain against a husband, who is"
"guilty of cruelty and negligent of his duties as a husband. The sanctity attached to a Fasah divorce"
"is much higher than the sanctity attached to a Mubarah divorce, since only an innocent wife can"
"obtain a Fasah divorce against a guilty husband. The burden proof of a  Fasah divorce is solely"
"and entirely on the wife. In addition to that, the gravity of the Fasah divorce is further underscored"
"by the fact that to establish the existence of a right to have a Fasah divorce, an innocent wife has"
"to call at least two witnesses, apart from her own evidence; this is something that has gone beyond"
"the  parameters  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance 4,  where  to  establish  a  certain  fact,  one  witness  is"
"sufficient."
"Therefore, it is very clear that the sanctity attached to the Fasah divorce as opposed to the Mubarah"
"divorce is much higher, and the gravity of a Fasah divorce against the husband is also greater than"
"a  Mubarah  divorce.  A  Mubarah  divorce  can  only  be  obtained  by  the  wife  with  consent  of  the"
"husband. Therefore, the guilt of the husband need not be established vis-a-vis the innocence of the"
"wife need not be established in obtaining a Mubarah divorce as the mere consent of the parties is"
