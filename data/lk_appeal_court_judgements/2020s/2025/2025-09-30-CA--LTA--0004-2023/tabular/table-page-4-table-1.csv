"the order granting the Mubarah divorce in favour of the wife (the Respondent), the Respondent"
"went to the Board of Quazi to revise the said order by way of a revision application."
"By the impugned order of the Board of Quazi marked P9, dated 11th February 2023, the Board of"
"Quazi set aside the Mubarah divorce granted in favour of the wife (the Respondent), and sent the"
"case back to the Quazi to consider relevant evidence and then make an order on the application for"
"a Fasah divorce sought by the wife (the Respondent)."
"Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant appealed to this Court. The matter was argued"
"before me and my learned brother on 22nd June 2025 and resumed on 1st September 2025, during"
"which the following arguments were advanced."
"However, in addition to the written submissions filed in terms of the rules, the counsel filed post-"
"argument submissions as well, wherein the counsel for the Appellant took up two points which I"
"will refer to in the course of my judgment. In addition, Mr. Nadvi Bahaudeen also replied to the"
"said two points in his submissions filed subsequent to the oral submissions made at the hearing on"
"the said date."
"Arguments"
"The first contention of Mr. Shabry is that, on a perusal of the application marked as P1, along with"
"the Petition, the original Applicant has made the application not in terms of Section 28(1) but under"
"Section 28(2) of the MMDA. The divorce obtainable under Section 28(1) of the MMDA is a Fasah"
"divorce, whilst Section 28(2) of the MMDA provides for Khula and Mubarah divorces. Therefore,"
"there is no question of converting a Fasah divorce into a Mubarah divorce, as the Applicant made"
"a  general,  undifferentiated  application  to  obtain  a  divorce,  without  expressly  seeking  a  Fasah"
"divorce in terms of Section 28(1) of the MMDA."
