"attempted  to  move  for  a  Mubarah  divorce  without  properly  adducing  evidence  or  properly"
"contesting the application of the Respondent (the wife)."
"As such, it is my view that the Board of Quazi is justified in making the impugned order. However,"
"in this application  at the argument stage, two new  matters were raised for and on behalf of  the"
"Appellant;  the  first  matter  was  whether  the  proceedings  before  the  Quazi  was  inquisitorial  or"
"adversarial.  In  support  of  his  argument,  he  relied  upon  certain  reports  prepared  by  Justice"
"Dehideniya for and on behalf of the Human Rights Commission. With all due respect to Justice"
"Dehideniya I hold that I am not bound by such reports or opinions, unless Justice Dehideniya has"
"made such observations or judicial expression."
"Secondly,  I  do  not  need  to  go  that  far  to  decide  whether  the  proceedings  are  adversarial  or"
"inquisitorial,  because  the  Respondent  (the  wife)  who  sought  a  divorce  has  right  throughout"
"maintained that she seeks a Fasah divorce, and not a Mubarah divorce. It is also to be noted that"
"her application has been made in that behalf, in terms of Section 28(1) and the rules of the Third"
"Schedule in the MMDA, which the Quazi in this case has failed to follow."
"The second matter the Appellant raised is whether the Respondent (the wife) is entitled to revision"
"before the Board of Quazi. For the reasons mentioned above, the Board of Quazi is justified in"
"revising the impugned order of the Quazi granting a Mubarah divorce."
