"To buttress his argument, he relied upon the documents marked Y5 and Y6 as those documents"
"have  been  submitted  based  on  Mubarah  divorces.  Further,  Mr.  Shabry  argued  that  there  is  no"
"answer to the application made before the Quazi Court, under Section 27 of the MMDA by the"
"husband, and Section 28 of the MMDA by the wife."
"In addition to that, he contended that no formal pleadings are required to be filed in the proceedings"
"before the learned Quazi; and also, no evidence is taken which is subject to cross-examination by"
"the opposing counsel at  the inquiry. The role played by the  learned Quazi is of  an inquisitorial"
"nature, and he takes down the statements made by the parties or the evidence submitted by them"
"in the normal course and not in the form of formal evidence as in a court of law. Therefore, the"
"concept of adversarial systems followed under the Civil Procedure Code or the Criminal Procedure"
"Code is not followed under the MMDA when parties apply for a divorce."
"Further he contended that, what is reflected in Y10 or P2 is the proceedings of the inquiry on the"
"last date, and having inquired into the matter with the assistance of the three assessors, who formed"
"their opinion and expressed their view on the matter, the learned Quazi granted a Mubarah divorce"
"in favour of the Applicant. Therefore, she cannot be heard to complain against such."
"The next contention of Mr. Shabry is that, on the application of the Applicant, directing the Quazi"
"to hold an inquiry again by the Board of Quazis is erroneous and not tenable in law; and therefore,"
"this appeal should be allowed."
"Finally, he contended that the Applicant obtained the divorce against the husband with the consent"
"of the Respondent, and then ten individuals signed the decree of divorce granted by the  learned"
"Quazi, as evidenced in P10. Therefore, the Applicant cannot now resile from what was mutually"
"agreed upon. Accordingly, the Board of Quazis should not have entertained the appeal made."
