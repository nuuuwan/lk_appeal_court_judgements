"However,  on  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Bahaudeen  contended  that  although  there  is  no  distinction  in"
"making the application, and upon perusal of the application to the learned Quazi, P1, in clear and"
"unequivocal terms, she has sought a Fasah divorce which falls within the ambit of Section 28(1)"
"of the MMDA."
"The  next  contention  of  Mr.  Bahaudeen  is  that,  although  the  counsel  for  the  Appellant  argued"
"(having  referred  to  certain  documents  filed  by  him)  that  the  Respondent  consented  to  grant  a"
"Mubarah divorce instead of a Fasah divorce, and the learned Quazi never considered that fact."
"Further, the learned Quazi never embarked upon an inquiry as required by Rules 7, 11, and 12 of"

"In addition to that, he argued that the assessors were appointed on the very same day, and their"
"opinions  and  views  are  not  reflected,  except  for  the  family  counselâ€™s  view.  Therefore,  acting"
"without evidence itself is biased, and not allowing the adducing of evidence is also biased. As such,"
"he contended that the Quazi is prejudiced against the applicant and biased towards the Respondent."
