"Conclusion"
"For the reasons adumbrated by me, it is my view that there is no merit in this appeal, and I move"
"to dismiss this appeal. Since it seems to be a frivolous appeal, I order Rs. 105,000 (One Hundred"
"and Five Thousand Rupees) as costs of this appeal payable by the Appellant to the Respondent."
