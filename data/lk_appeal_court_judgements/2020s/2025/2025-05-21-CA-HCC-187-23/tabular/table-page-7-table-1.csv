"But in the instant case, the victim has stated two versions with regard to the sexual"
"act. The question is whether this Court can rely on his evidence. The evidence of PW1"
"was not convincing and not consistent."
"The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the inconsistency of the victim."
"We hold that the evidence of the victim is not sufficient to come to a conclusion with"
"regard  to  the  guilt  of  the  Accused.  The  Prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  beyond"
"reasonable doubt the act of sexual act performed on the victim with the evidence of"
"PW1."
"I therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentences and acquit the Accused on the"
"charge with which he was convicted."
"Appeal allowed."
