"(cross-examinations of Chandralal at Pages 522 – 523 of P15)"
"H
ence, the above piece of evidence shows that there is an inconsistency"
"in  evidence  given  by 
the  witnesses  Ariyarathna 
and 
Sandanayake"
"concerning  the  time  of  the  Petitioner 
leaving  the  premises  after  the"
"function.  Accordingly, 
the  credibility  of 
the  defence  witnesses 
is 
in"
"dispute.  Therefore, 
I  view  that  the  credibility  of  prosecution  witness"
"Niroshan's 
evidence 
cannot 
be 
undermined 
by 
the 
evidence 
of"
"Ariyarathna  and  Chandimal  in  favour  of  the  defence  of  alibi  claimed  by"
"the Petitioner."
"Evidence in Rebuttal"
"The  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  Court  Martial  acted  ultra  vires  by"
"allowing  the  Prosecution  to  call  evidence  in  rebuttal.  After  closing  the"
"defence  case,  the  Respondent  had  been  allowed  to  call  evidence 
in"
"rebuttal.  Consequently, 
the  Prosecution  had  called 
the  evidence  of"
"Commodore  Nanayakkara 
in  rebuttal.  The  Petitioner  claims  that  the"
"evidence in rebuttal could be allowed only when the Prosecution is taken"
"aback  by  surprise.  Section  134  of  the  Navy  Act  (as  amended)  provides"
"that,  subject  to  other  provisions  of  this  part,  the  rules  of  evidence  to  be"
"adopted in proceedings before a court martial shall be the same as those"
"followed 
in  the  civil  courts 
in  Sri  Lanka.  Hence, 
it 
is  viewed  that  the"
"Evidence  Ordinance  applies  to  a  Court  Martial.  The  Petitioner  relies  on"
"the  Law  of  Evidence  by  E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy  and  the  Supreme  Court"
"decision in K.S. Sediris v. The Queen 74 NLR 224."
"“Evidence  in  rebuttal  should  not  be  permitted  except  in  a  case  where"
"matter has arisen ex improviso, or the evidence was not admissible before"
"the 
prosecution 
case  was 
closed” 
(Law 
of 
Evidence 
by 
E.R.S.R."
