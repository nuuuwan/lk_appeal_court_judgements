"correctly 
addressed 
the  members 
of 
the 
Court  Martial 
on 
the"
"aforementioned  principles.  Accordingly,  I  hold  that  no  prejudice  would"
"have been caused to the Petitioner owing to the summing up of evidence"
"in respect of the defence of alibi."
"The 
Petitioner 
states 
in  his  written 
submission 
that  Commodore"
"Nanayakkara  was  senior 
in  rank 
to  Commander  Ariyarathna  and  Lt."
"Commander  Chandralal, 
and 
in 
the  military, 
rank 
always  matters."
"Therefore,  the  suggestion  of  contradictions  between  officers  of  senior"
"rank  and  junior  rank  would  generally  lead  to  belief  in  the  officer  of  the"
"senior  rank  over  an  officer 
in 
junior  rank.  Accordingly, 
it 
is 
further"
"submitted 
that 
the  summation  of 
the 
Judge  Advocate  would  have"
"undoubtedly 
led 
the  members 
of 
the 
Court  Martial 
to 
believe"
"Commodore 
Nanayakkara 
over 
Commander 
Ariyarathna 
and 
Lt."
"Commander  Chandralal  on 
the 
incorrect  premises 
that 
they  were"
"contradictory  as 
incorrectly  portrayed  by  the 
Judge  Advocate 
in  his"
"summation.    Anyhow,  the  Judge  Advocate  in  his  summation  addressed"
"this point. He summed up that just because Commodore Nanayakka is a"
"senior officer, his evidence could not be accepted above the others."
