"Whether the facts not disclosed are of sufficient materiality to justify or require"
"the  immediate  discharge  of  the  order  without  consideration  of  the  merits,"
"depends on the importance of the facts to the issues, which are to be decided"
"by the Court”"
"Further, in Athula Rathnayake v. Jayasinghe (1975) 78 NLR 35 at 39-40 the"
"exacting  standards  of  disclosure  were 
laid  down  by  Sirimanne  J.  who"
"when referring to the Petition filed by the Petitioner held as follows:"
"“His  petition  though  it  refers  to  documents  (A)  to  (J)  filed  with  the  petition"
"makes  no  reference  whatever  to  the  summing  up  also  being  filed. 
  If  any"
"documents are  filed  with  the  petition  they  must be  referred  to  in  the  petition"
"itself  as  this  Court  would  be  led by  the  contents of  the petition  and  affidavit."
"On  reading  the  papers 
filed 
I  myself  was  under  the 
impression  that  the"
"summing up had not been supplied to the petitioner at all.  This type of non-"
"disclosure 
in  the  petition  and  the  filing  of  the  document  without 
it  being"
"referred  to  in  the  petition  tends  to  create  in  the  mind  of  the  Court  a  wrong"
"impression and at the same time affords the petitioner, when his bona fides are"
"questioned, to point out as an excuse that the document was in fact filed with"
"the petition…  This type of action must be viewed with strong disapproval and"
"one hopes that it would not be followed in future.”"
"Accordingly,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  acted  with"
"uberrima fides and is guilty of suppression of material facts."
"Futility"
"As  per  the  documents  marked  R8  and  R9  the  recommendations  of  the"
"Court  Martial  have  been  ratified  by,  His  Excellency  the  President.  The"
"decision  of  His  Excellency 
the  President 
is  not  amenable 
to  writ"
"jurisdiction. 
In  Major  P.  P.  G.  Siriwardena  v.  Cyril  Herath  and  Others"
"CA/Writ/Application  No.  754/2005,  decided  on  11.10.2010    it  was  held"
"that,"
"“The petitioner in this application has sought a wit of Certiorari to quash  the"
"decision of Her Excellency and the Order published in the Gazette. This decision"
"was made by Her Excellency. The President in her capacity as President and as"
"the  commander  in  chief  of  the  Armed  forces  in  terms  of  Article  30(1)  of  the"
"Constitution read with Section 10 of the Army Act. In view of the provisions in"
"section 35(1) of the Constitution, the decision of the Excellency the President is"
"not amenable to the jurisdiction.”"
