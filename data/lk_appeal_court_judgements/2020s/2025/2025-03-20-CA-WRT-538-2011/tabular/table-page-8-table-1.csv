"and 
K.S.N.  Whella,  whose 
statements  were 
recorded 
during 
the"
"proceedings  before  the  Board  of  Investigation  P1  too,  were  yet  again"
"recorded 
in  the  Summary  of  Evidence  marked  P5  as  well.  The  said"
"witnesses  have  been  subjected  to  cross-examination  by  the  Petitioner."
"Accordingly, it could be observed that a fair hearing had been given to the"
"Petitioner."
"The Petitioner avers that after the relevant Charge Sheet was issued and"
"the  Court  Martial  was  appointed,  a  Summary  of  Evidence  from  three"
"additional witnesses had been recorded for the third time. The Petitioner"
"had been served with an additional list of witnesses and documents. The"
"Petitioner  further  asserts  that  he  was  not  provided  with  a  copy  of  the"
"Summary  of  Evidence  concerning  Lieutenant  Commander  A.M.D.M."
"Abeysinghe  and  that  the  same  violates  regulations  10  and  30  of  the  Sri"
"Lanka Navy Orders 0512 [P4]. It is asserted that the failure to adhere to"
"the  said  procedural  steps  violates  principles  of  natural  justice  rendering"
"the final order a nullity."
"As  per 
the  document  marked  P5, 
the  Summary  of  Evidence  had"
"commenced  on  12.11.2009.  Documents  P6  and  P7 
show 
that 
the"
"aforesaid Charge Sheet was served on the Petitioner on 03.05.2010. The"
"Petitioner complains that the  recording of  the Summary of Evidence for"
"the  third  time  from  the  witnesses  namely  S.B.  Kaluarachchi,  B.G.C.S."
"Lakmal and M.H. Kosala is contrary to the due procedure of recording the"
"Summary  of  Evidence  as  stipulated  in  Sri  Lanka  Navy  Orders  0512  [P4]."
"Nevertheless, 
the  proceedings  of 
the  Court  Martial  commenced  on"
"23.06.2010. The third Summary of Evidence of the above three witnesses"
"was recorded from 11.02.2010 to 25.02.2010 before the commencement"
"of the Court Martial. In terms of Section 31 of the P4, if it appears to the"
"Commanding  Officer  or  Convening  Authority  that  additional  evidence  is"
"required, additional evidence may be obtained by recording an additional"
"Summary of Evidence.  Furthermore, it is observed that the Charge Sheet"
"[P7] was not amended subsequent to the third Summary of Evidence."
"Although the Petitioner states that he was not provided with a copy of the"
"said 
Summary  of  Evidence 
containing 
the  evidence  of 
Lieutenant"
"Commander A.M.D.M. Abeysinghe, as per the document marked P5/R2 it"
"is  evident  that  a  copy  of  the  above  Summary  of  Evidence  of  A.M.D.M."
