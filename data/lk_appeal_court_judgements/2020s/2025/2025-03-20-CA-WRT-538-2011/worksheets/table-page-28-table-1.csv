"Suppression of Material Facts"
"The instant application has been filed on 04.08.2011.  The Petitioner has"
"submitted  an  appeal  dated  14.01.2011  to  His  Excellency  the  President"
"against the conviction and sentence imposed on him by the Court Martial."
"It 
is  stated 
in  the  Petition  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  received  any"
"response 
thereon.  However, 
the 
Respondents 
submitted 
that  His"
"Excellency  the  President  has  ratified  the  recommendation  made  by  the"
"Commander  of  the  Army 
in  respect  of  the  sentence  passed  on  the"
"Petitioner  by  letter  dated  08.03.2011  marked  R8  and  turned  down  the"
"appeal submitted by the Petitioner by letter dated 23.03.2011 marked R9."
"The  Respondent  contends  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  disclose  the"
"purported decisions of His Excellency the President, and such deliberate"
"or convenient ignorance of material facts amounts to the suppression of"
"material facts."
"The Petitioner argues that because of the letters labelled R8 and R9 were"
"not  addressed  to  him  or  copied  to  him,  he  could  not  have  included  the"
"same  in  the  Petition.  However,  it  is  noted  that  the  Petitioner  has  not"
"claimed 
ignorance  of 
the  decision  of  His  Excellency 
the  President."
"Furthermore, 
the  document  dated  March  23,  2011,  marked  R12,"
"indicates that the Petitioner was informed of this decision."
"The  Petitioner  further  asserts  that  the  rejection  of  the  appeal  is  not  a"
"material fact to the application. However, it is the duty of the Petitioner to"
"place all the relevant facts before the Court to enable the Court to reach a"
"fair  conclusion.  It  is  for  the  Court  to  decide  the  materiality  of  the  facts"
"produced  before  it.  In  Fonseka  v.  Lt.General  Jagath  Jayasuriya  and  Five"
"Others [2011] 2 SRI L.R. 373 it was held that a Petitioner who seeks relief"
"by way of  writ which is an extraordinary remedy must in fairness to the"
"Court, bear every material fact so that the discretion of the Court is not"
"wrongly  invoked  or  exercised…..If  there  is  anything  like  deception,  the"
"Court ought not to go into the merits, but simply say “We will not listen to"
"your application because of what you have done.” Further, Abdus Salam J."
"observed that:"
"“Material facts are those which are material for  the Judge to know in dealing"
