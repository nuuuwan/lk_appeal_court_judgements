"commission of the offence, no different decision could have been reached"
"by the members of the Court of Martial with the overwhelming evidence"
"against  the  Petitioner.  Accordingly,  even  though  the  point  raised  by  the"
"Petitioner  might  be  decided  in  favour  of  the  Petitioner  no  prejudice  or"
"miscarriage of justice has actually caused. In this connection, I would like"
"to refer to the following decisions in our jurisdiction."
"M.H.M.Lafeer  v.  The  Queen  74  NLR246  at  p248,  “There  was  thus  both"
"misdirection  and  non-direction  on  matters  concern 
in  the  standard  of"
"proof.  Nevertheless,  we  are  of  the  opinion  having  regard  to  the  cogent"
"and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not have"
"reasonably  returned  a  more  favourable  verdict.  We  therefore  affirm  the"
"conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.”"
"In Lurdu Nelson Fernando and Others v. The Attorney General (1998)2 Sri LR"
"329 
it  was  held,  that  even  though  the  points  raised  on  behalf  of  the"
"appellants might be decided in their favour, yet no miscarriage of justice"
"has actually occurred; hence the appeal should be dismissed."
"Lenient Sentence Imposed by the Court Martial"
"Additionally, it is submitted that despite the serious nature of the charges"
"raised  against 
the  Petitioner, 
the  Court  Martial 
imposed  a 
lenient"
"sentence  of  “dismissal  without  disgrace”  without  providing 
justifiable"
"reasons. The Petitioner contends that the fair assumption which could be"
"arrived  at  as  a 
reason 
for 
sentencing 
the  Petitioner  with 
lenient"
"punishment was that the Court Martial had doubts regarding the guilt of"
"the  Petitioner.  Thus,  despite  these  doubts,  rather  than  acquitting  the"
"Petitioner, 
the  Court  Martial  opted 
to 
impose  a 
lighter 
sentence."
"However,  I am  unable  to agree with the  above  submission made by the"
"Petitioner as the Court Martial has justified its decision by giving reasons."
"It is observed that  the Court Martial has  given due  consideration to the"
"Petitioner’s satisfactory past service records and the previous character of"
"the officer before the sentence was imposed on the Petitioner."
"Considering  the  circumstances  and  reasons  outlined  above,  I  am  of  the"
"view  that  there  are  no  compelling  cogent  reasons,  such  as 
illegality,"
"irrationality, or procedural impropriety, for this Court to interfere with the"
"decision of the Court Martial."
