"Abeysinghe  had  been  served  on  the  Petitioner  and  the  same  has  been"
"formally accepted by the Petitioner placing his signature."
"Under 
such 
circumstances, 
the 
Petitioner's 
assertion 
that 
the"
"Respondents  have 
failed 
to  adhere 
to 
the  due  procedural  steps  as"
"stipulated in P2 and P4 cannot be accepted. As such, I am of the view that"
"no prejudice or miscarriage of justice had been caused to the Petitioner."
"The Admissibility of the Testimony of Prosecution Witnesses"
"Credibility of witness"
"The Petitioner challenges the evidence placed before the Court Martial in"
"various  aspects.  The  Petitioner  states  that  the  prosecution  witnesses"
"Padmakumar  and  Rajapaksa  are  admitted  accomplices  and  criminals"
"unworthy of any credit. Therefore, it is claimed that said witnesses were"
"not 
independent  witnesses 
and  had 
to 
testify  on  behalf  of 
the"
"prosecution to satisfy the Naval Authorities to safeguard their respective"
"positions in the Navy. It is claimed that the Naval Authorities allowed the"
"said  witnesses  to  remain  in  their  positions  and  handle  stores  despite,"
"their  own  admissions  of  theft,  in  order  to  elicit  the  required  evidence"
"from them to implicate the Petitioner by inducing them."
"Nevertheless,  by  the  times  of  the  Court  Martial,  the  said  witnesses  had"
"not been tried for the alleged offences they had committed. However, by"
"that  time,  Sri  Lanka  Navy  had 
lodged  a  complaint  with  the  Criminal"
"Investigation Department regarding an alleged large-scale fraud involving"
"lubricating  oil  and  kerosene  against  said  Rajapaksha  and  the  Petitioner."
"Accordingly, the said witness Rajapaksa had been arrested by the Criminal"
"Investigation 
Department. 
The 
Respondents 
submit 
that  witness"
"Pathmakumara  was  summarily  tried  by  his  Commanding  Officer  for  the"
"offence  he  had  committed.  Furthermore,  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"convincingly show how the alleged criminal backgrounds of the witnesses"
"had negatively affected his case or the credibility of witnesses. Therefore,"
"the  argument  that  these  witnesses  were  not 
independent  cannot  be"
"accepted merely on a simple assertion."
"Further,  the  petitioner  asserts  that  Niroshan  was  an  accomplice  along"
"with  witnesses  Rajapaksha,  Padmakumara,  Wehella 
and  Rathnasiri."
"Accordingly,  he  is  an  unreliable  witness.  Who 
is  an  accomplice? 
  â€œAn"
"accomplice is one who is a guilty associate in a crime or who sustains such"
