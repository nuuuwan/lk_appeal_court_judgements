"Perera and Others - CA (Writ) Application No. 689/2011, decided on: 14th"
"February  2019  on 
similar 
circumstances  His  Lordship 
Justice  Arjuna"
"Obeyesekere observed that:"
"â€œThe question that arises from the second argument of the learned Counsel for"
"the  Petitioner  is  whether  an  accomplice  is  a  competent  witness.  In  terms  of"
"Section  133  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  'an  accomplice  shall  be  a  competent"
"witness  against  an  accused  person,  and  the  conviction  is  not  illegal  merely"
"because  it  proceeds  upon  the  uncorroborated  testimony  of  an  accomplice.'"
"Section  133  should  be  considered  with  Section  114 
illustration  (b)  of  the"
"Evidence  Ordinance,  which  reads  as  follows:  ""The  Court""  may  presume  an"

"that 
they  have  committed, 
thereby  making 
the  evidence  of  accomplices"
"essential for the prosecution."
"This Court observes that the Petitioner, as a senior Commissioned Officer of the"
"Sri  Lanka  Navy  was  required  to  act  with  utmost  honesty  and  adhere  to  high"
"standards of discipline required of a Commissioned Officer. Any breach thereof"
"has to be taken serious note of. Thus, in order to establish its case and ensure"
"that  any  breach  of  discipline  is  dealt  with,  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the"
"prosecution  was  entitled  to  lead  the  evidence  of  the  three  storekeepers  and"
