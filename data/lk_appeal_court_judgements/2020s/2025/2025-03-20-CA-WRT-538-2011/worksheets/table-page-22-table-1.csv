"Jayatissa  v.  Hon  Attorney  General  [2010]  1  SRI  L.R.279,  it  was  held  that"
"when  the  defence  set  up  an  alibi,  the  Prosecution  is  entitled  to  lead"
"evidence in rebuttal. Hence, in the instant application, since the Petitioner"
"has taken up his physical impossibility of being present at the scene of the"
"crime at the relevant time as a defence (alibi) for the first time in the dock"
"statement, 
taken  by 
surprise, 
the  Prosecution  was  entitled 
to  call"
"evidence in rebuttal. Hence, I am not inclined to accept the submission of"
"the  Petitioner  that  the  Prosecution  was  not  taken  by  surprise  of  the"
"defence of alibi taken up by the Petitioner at the dock statement made in"
"the Court Martial. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Court Martial has"
"not acted ultra vires in allowing the evidence in rebuttal."
"Further,  when 
the  Prosecution 
informed 
the  Court  Martial  of 
the"
"intention of calling evidence in rebuttal and on the day of calling witness"
"Commodore  Nanayakkara 
to  give  evidence 
in 
rebuttal, 
the  defence"
"(Petitioner) 
failed 
to  object 
to 
such.  Accordingly, 
the  Petitioner 
is"
"estopped  from  challenging  the  decision  of  the  Court  Martial  at  this"
"juncture on such basis."
"Alleged Defective Summing up of Evidence in Respect of the Defence of Alibi"
"It 
is  stated  that  the  summation  of  evidence  by  the  Judge  Advocate"
"contains  material  misdirections 
and 
non-directions. 
The 
Petitioner"
"brought 
the  notice  of 
this  Court 
to 
the 
following  citations 
in 
the"
"summation of the Judge Advocate."
