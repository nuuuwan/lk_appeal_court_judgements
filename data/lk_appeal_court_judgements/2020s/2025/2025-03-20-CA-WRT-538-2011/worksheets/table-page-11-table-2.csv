"The  combined  effect  of  sections  133  and  114  illustration  (b)  is  that  it  is  not"
"illegal to convict on uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, even though it"
"may be dangerous and unsafe to do so.”"
"In P. Sivasambu, Inspector of Police vs Nugawela 41 NLR 363 at 368, it was"
"held that “under section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance, a conviction is not"
"illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of"
"an accomplice. But, it is necessary that the Magistrate should have clearly"
"before  his  mind  the  fact  that  he 
is  dealing  with  the  evidence  of  an"
"accomplice, and he must give clear and satisfactory reasons for convicting"
"in the absence of corroboration.”"
"However, 
in 
the 
instant  application 
the  witnesses,  Rajapaksha  and"
"Padhmakumara, called by the Prosecution, have identified the Petitioner,"
"who  was  present  at 
the  scene,  and  well  known 
to 
them.  Alleged"
"accomplice Niroshan’s testimony had been corroborated by the evidence"
"of the above witnesses."
"The  Petitioner  states  that  according  to  the  Summary  of  Evidence  of"
"Lieutenant Rupasinghe, he had seen Niroshan conversing with Rajapaksha"
"and  Padhmakumara,  who  were  seated  at  a  table  in  the  Kerosene  stores"
"and Niroshan himself admitted in evidence before the Court Martial that"
"he used to speak to Rajapaksha and Padhmakumara at the stores. Hence,"
"Niroshan  was 
a 
close 
friend 
of 
Rajapaksha 
and 
Padhmakumara."
"Consequently,  the  Petitioner  contends  that  Niroshan  has 
intentionally"
"altered  his  evidence  and  provided 
false  testimony  to  align  with  the"
"narrative  given  by  his  friends.  Anyhow,  the  Summary  of  Evidence  is  not"
"evidence  before 
the  Court  Martial. 
Furthermore,  merely 
because"
"witnesses  sit 
in  such  a  manner  or  speak  with  each  other  does  not"
"necessarily mean that they were close friends, and it does not seem as a"
"reason  for  Niroshan  to  give  evidence  in  agreement  with  the  testimony"
"given by the other two. As such, I view that there is no rationale behind"
"such an allegation."
"The Petitioner states that the witness Niroshan, who was the driver of the"
"Petitioner’s official car, has uttered deliberate falsehood before the Court"
"Martial  and  it  was  refuted  by  the  testimony  of  Commander  Ariyaratne"
"and  Commander  Chandralal  called  as  witnesses  by  the  Petitioner  at  the"
