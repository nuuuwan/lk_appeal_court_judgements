"benefit  or 
inducement 
from 
the  said 
transaction.  Furthermore, 
the"
"evidence  does  not  show  that  Niroshan  even  stepped  out  of  the  vehicle"
"during  the  time  relevant  to  the  incident.  Hence,  although  Niroshan  was"
"seen  speaking  with  witnesses  Rajapaksha  and  Padhmakumara 
in  the"
"store, this does not necessarily prove his involvement in the offence. The"
"circumstances  and  legal  principles  outlined  above  do  not  support  the"
"Petitioner's claim that Niroshan is an accomplice."
"The  Petitioner  further  states  that  witness  Niroshan  is  a  person  with  a"
"criminal  background.  However, 
it 
is  observed 
that  at 
the 
time 
the"
"Petitioner was convicted, the Niroshan had not been a convicted criminal."
"Hence the credibility of Niroshan could not be impeached in the instant"
"application based on his alleged criminal liability subsequent to the Court"
"Martial.  The  Petitioner  contends  that  failure  to  maintain  and  submit  a"
"running chart for April 2009 shows that Niroshan had knowingly used the"
"official  vehicle  for  an  unauthorized  purpose  and  deliberately  concealed"
"such use from the Petitioner and the Supplies Department. Nevertheless,"
"Niroshan's explanation in his testimony was that he was unable to submit"
"the  running  charts  for  April  2009  before  the  month's  end  due  to  being"
"taken to Navy Headquarters is acceptable."
"Failure of the Prosecution to Call Wehella as a Prosecution Witness"
"The  Petitioner  submits  that  although  the  Bowser  Driver  Wehella  was  a"
"material  witness 
listed  by  the  Prosecution  at  the  Court  Martial,  the"
"prosecution  failed  to  call  him  as  a  prosecution  witness.  The  Petitioner"
"relies on the presumption under Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance"
"which provides that evidence which could have been produced and is not"
"produced, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. It"
"is submitted by the Respondents that the Prosecution had decided not to"
"call  said  Wehella  as  a  witness  since  the  prosecution  was  of  the  opinion"
"that  the  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  Martial  was  sufficient  to"
"substantiate the charges against the accused (Petitioner). Section 134 of"
"the Evidence Ordinance provides that no number of witnesses shall in any"
"case be required for the proof of an act."
"There may be multiple reasons as to why a certain party may decide not"
"to  call  a  certain  witness.  One  such  reason  would  be  the  fact  that  the"
"witness in question if called to submit evidence, would give evidence that"
"is adverse to the party in question. However, that is not the sole reason"
