"submit  that  the  said  regulations  contained  in  P2  have  no  application  to"
"the  Board  of  Investigation,  and  it  only  applies  to  the  Board  of  Inquiry"
"appointed  by  the  Commander  of  the  Navy.    The  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"encounter  the  above  submission  which  is  averted  in  the  statements  of"
"objections of the Respondents.  In any event, no material or evidentiary"
"proof has been placed before this Court by either party for this Court to"
"arrive  at  a  proper  conclusion  as  to  whether  the  instant  inquiry  was  a"
"board of investigation or a board of inquiry. Owing to the condition that"
"the  Petitioner  has 
failed 
to  deny 
the 
stance  put 
forward  by 
the"
"Respondent that the instant is a Board of Investigation and not a Board of"
"Inquiry  and  terminology  referred  to 
in  P1  and  P2, 
I  am 
inclined  to"
"conclude that Regulation 13 of P2 has no application to the recording of"
"evidence specified in P1 by the Board of Investigation."
"Nevertheless, 
it 
is  observed 
that 
the  Petitioner  has  been  given  an"
"opportunity  to  make  a  statement  and  give  evidence  by  the  aforesaid"
"Board. 
It 
is  further  observed  that  as  per  the  said  Regulation  13,  an"
"opportunity  as  referred  therein  could  be  given  to  any  person  if  he  so"
"wishes  and 
if  he 
thinks 
that 
the 
inquiry  affects  his 
character  or"
"professional  reputation  only.  There  is  no  material  before  this  Court  to"
"conclude  that  the  Petitioner  had  made  such  requests  as  such  to  the"
"Board.  Hence,  the  argument  advanced  by  the  Petitioner  that  he  was"
"denied  of  the  opportunity  to  be  present  throughout  the 
inquiry  and"
"cross-examine 
the  witnesses  at  the  proceedings  as  contained 
in  P1"
"(alleged denial of the right to a fair hearing) as per the above Regulation"
"No.13 cannot sustain."
"The  Respondents  submit  that  the  appointment  of  a  Board  of  Inquiry  by"
"the Commander of the Navy under the Regulations contained P2 is not a"
"mandatory  requirement  to  be  fulfilled  prior  to  the  commencement  of"
"Court Martial proceedings. It is on common ground that the Court Martial"
"was  convened  based  on  the  evidence  recorded 
in  the  Summary  of"
"Evidence  which 
is  an  essential  pre-condition  to  be  satisfied  prior  to"
"summoning  a  Court  Martial  as  per  the  Sri  Lanka  Navy  Order  No.  0512"
"marked P4. It is observed that Section 2 of Order P4 stipulates that one of"
"the  objects  of  a  Summary  of  Evidence 
is 
to 
inform 
the  convening"
"Authority of the nature of the case and to enable him to decide whether"
"the case should be tried by the Court Martial. The evidence of the above-"
"mentioned  three  witnesses,  namely  M.K.E.  Padmakumara,  N.Rathnasiri"
