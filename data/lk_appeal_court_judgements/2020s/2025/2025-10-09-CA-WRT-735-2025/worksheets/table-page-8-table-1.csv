"of the LA Act, and the same decision has been published by Gazette No. 67/16 dated 21.12.1979,"
"annexed as R15 and R16 marked by the Respondents with their limited objections."
"The Section 5 notice is thereafter issued; accordingly, the land has been identified and published"
"in  Gazette  No.  949/19,  dated  14.11.1996  (R3  marked  by  the  Respondents  with  their  limited"
"objections). In addition to that, the Section 7 notice was also published by Gazette No. 1072/9,"
"dated 25.03.1999 (same is marked as R6 by the Respondents), calling for claims in respect of the"
"lands so taken possession, and the relevant information so given with the covering letter is marked"
"as P27 annexed to the Petition. The relevant plots of land claimed by the Petitioner is depicted in"
"the  Plans  bearing  No.  98/SLLRDC  dated  27.10.2012,  and  No.107/SLLRDC  dated  07.05.2013,"
"both prepared by Mr. P.A.S Fernando,  and the  information  thereof was given by the Sri  Lanka"
"Land  Development  Corporation  to  the  Petitioner  (the  3rd  Respondent).  The  relevant  plans  are"
"annexed to the Petition along with the document marked as P30."
"However,  since  the  parcels  of  land  has  now  been  given  to  a  private  party,  the  Petitioner  has"
"requested to divest the lands by P34 in terms of Section 39A of the LA Act. It is also established"
"by  the  Petitioner  that  the  land  has  been  given  to  a  private  party  to  store  certain  pre-prepared"
"concrete beams and columns, as established by the relevant correspondence between the Petitioner"
"and the relevant government departments. The said documents are marked as P5 to P13, and P15"
"annexed to the Petition. The Respondents have not disputed the fact that the parcels of land are in"
"possession of a private party."
"It is an undisputed fact that first, the Section 2 notice has been issued as way back as in 1979, and"
"the immediate forcible possession has taken place in the same year. Thereafter, the parcels of land"
"had  not  been  utilised  for  the  public  purpose  for  which  it  was  acquired.  In  addition  to  the  said"
"abandonment, the land had not been utilised, or no improvement has been effected on the land so"
