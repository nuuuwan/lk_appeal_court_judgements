"Acquisition"
"It is an undisputed fact that the same parcels of land had been acquired under the LA Act by the"
"Respondents for a public purpose. The said acquisition had commenced as way back as in 1979,"
"as borne out by the document marked as P27. However, the Petitioner later found that the public"
"purpose for which the land was acquired is abandoned. Therefore, the Petitioner moves this Court"
"to  obtain  the  reliefs  as  prayed  for  in  the  Petition,  seeking  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the"
"Respondents to divest the land in terms of Section 39A of the LA Act on three grounds: One is"
"that the land has not been utilized for which it was acquired for 45 years ago. Second matter is that"
"no compensation has been paid to the Petitioner as the owner of the said land, and the third matter"
"is that the Government has leased it out to a private party without effecting any improvements on"
"the lands. Accordingly, the Petitioner has sought a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents"
"to divest the same in terms of Section 39A of the LA Act."
"Now I will consider whether the Petitioner is entitled to have a divesting order in relation to the"
"above-mentioned grounds. As mentioned above, the Petitioner is the owner of the land as depicted"
"in document marked as P1 to the Petition. The chain of title is also indicated in P2, a title report"
"given  by  a  lawyer  for  the  Petitioner.  The  said  land  and  its  relevant  deeds  have  been  registered"
"according to the document marked as P3."
"Since the Petitioner is unaware of the notices published in terms of the LA Act, he has written to"
"the relevant ministry to obtain information under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016"
"(RTI Act). Accordingly, 3rd Respondent has responded to the said request and given the relevant"
"information. According to the relevant information, the notice under Section 2 had been published"
"on 11th February 1979. Thereafter, the possession of the land had been taken over by the Minister,"
"who has given directions to the acquiring officer to take immediate possession under Section 38(a)"
