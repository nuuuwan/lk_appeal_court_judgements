"No improvements effected"
"Thirdly, the said land acquired by the Government in 1979 has now been leased out to a private"
"entity for commercial purpose. Therefore, a land acquired for the particular public purpose cannot"
"be  utilized  for  a  commercial  purpose  by  the  acquiring  authority,  which  is  totally  irrational."
"Accordingly, on the third ground as well, the Petitioner is entitled to obtain a Writ of Mandamus"
"for a divestiture."
"Accordingly, it is clear that after taking immediate possession under Section 38(a) of the LA Act,"
"the three parcels of land have been left without utilising it for any public purpose. In addition to"
"that, it is common ground that no improvement has been made to date from the time the immediate"
"possession took place in 1979, and presently, the land has apparently been given to a private party"
"on  a  contract  for  a  private  venture,  entered  into  with  the  3rd  Respondent  and  the  private  party."
"Accordingly,  though it is stated  in the course of the argument that it had been  acquired for  the"
"purpose for utilising the three parcels of land for the Railway Department, nothing has happened"
"so far, without even utilising it  at least as a source  for a junk yard of the Railway Department."
"Thus, it is my view that all three conditions required for a divestiture set out in Section 39A of the"
"LA Act are satisfied."
