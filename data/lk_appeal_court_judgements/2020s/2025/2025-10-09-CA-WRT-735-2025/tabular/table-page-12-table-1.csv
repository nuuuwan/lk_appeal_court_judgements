"Therefore,  it  is  very  clear  that  all  the  ingredients  set  out  in  Section  39A  of  the  LA  Act  for  the"
"issuance of a divestiture is established and satisfied."
"Thus,  the  Petitioner  has  requested  the  Minister,  by  document  marked  as  P35,  for  a  divestiture,"
"which the Minister appears to have been dilly-dallying on, having correspondence between him"
"and various departments, including several Respondents cited in this case."
"Conclusion"
"Thus,  it  is  my  view  that  the  Writ  of  Mandamus  sought  by  the  Petitioner  compelling  the  1st"
"Respondent to issue a divesting order lies in this case, and accordingly, I grant the same. In addition"
"to that, I wish to grant certain costs since the Respondents ventured to challenge these proceedings"
"without painting the true picture to conclude on the Petitionerâ€™s right to a divestiture. Therefore, I"
"wish to grant Rs. 52,500/- (Fifty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Rupees) as cost of litigation in this"
"application."
