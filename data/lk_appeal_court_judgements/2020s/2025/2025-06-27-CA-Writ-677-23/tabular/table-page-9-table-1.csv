"The Respondents also submitted that in coming to the decision to call for new tenders"
"they  have  considered  the  need  to  have  a  healthy  transport  service  with  buses  in  a"
"mechanically perfect condition. As per the documents marked as 3R1, P15 and P16, it"
"is evident that though there are 13 buses plying from Matugama to Aluthgama, there"
"are only 11 buses from Aluthgama to Matugama. Thus, there is an imbalance. Further,"
"it  is  argued  that  since  the  buses  are  carrying  passengers,  the  said  buses  should  be"
"regularly maintained and there should be regular mechanical inspections. It was also"
"submitted  that  the  drivers  for  the  buses  should  be  given  adequate  rest.  It  was  also"
"contended  by  the  Respondents  that  they  expect  the  Petitioners  to  carry  out  regular"
"maintenance  of  the  buses  and  provide  a  rest  day  for  the  crew.  However,  though  the"
"Muthugama end has 2 buses on standby every week it is not so on the Althugama end"
"as there are only 11 buses. The said buses have to operate on all 7 days of the week."
"Which  the  Respondents  contended  is  not  a  healthy  situation  as  there  are  no  dates"
"available  for  the  said  buses  to  be  sent  in  for  maintenance.  Hence,  they  argued  that"
"tenders were called to add two new buses to make the number of buses from Aluthgama"
"end to the Matugama end becomes equal. It is their contention that then an undisrupted"
"transport service can be maintained as  there  will be 2 buses on standby and the said"
"standby buses can be subjected to a mechanical inspection at least once a week. It was"
"also argued that in the absence of such standby buses, if there is a sudden emergency or"
"breakdown there is no replacement bus to operate on the Aluthgama end. Hence, the"
"transport  timetable  will  be  disrupted  and  the  greater  public  will  have  to  undergo"
"numerous difficulties. In my view, this is what is attempted to be avoided by inserting"
"6(1)(à¶…)  in  the  Provincial  Statute.  It  is  also  observed  that  considering  the  documents"
"marked 3R1, 3R2 3R3, P15 and P16 this Court is inclined to accept the submissions of"
"the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents."
