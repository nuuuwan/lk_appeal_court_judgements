he  facts  of  the  case  briefly  are  as  follows.  The  Petitioners  allege  that  they  have"
"obtained permits from the 1st Respondent to operate passenger services from Aluthgama"
"to Matugama on Route No. 441. A new time schedule had been introduced in 2023 by"
"the 3rd Respondent, resulting in  a surplus of  buses on  the said route. The Petitioners"

"fairness."
