"that the Respondents have never carried out a survey. In any event, whether a survey"
"was carried out or not becomes a disputed fact. When facts are in dispute a Writ Court"
"is reluctant to use its discretionary powers of Writ jurisdiction. In the case of Thajudeen"
"v. Sri Lanka Tea Board & another (1981) SLR 471, it was held"
"“where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts is subject"
"to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a"
"suit where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so"
"that the Court would be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will"
"not issue.”"
