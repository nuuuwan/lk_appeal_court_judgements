"The Petitioners submit that such authority to accept, charge fees for and"
"to  process  building  applications  and 
issue  and  extend  Development"
"Permits in respect of constructions including constructions that are over"
"four floors and 4000 sq. ft. and premises in extent over 40 perches had"
"been withdrawn from the 1st Respondent with effect from 01.02.2017 by"
"the  UDA  as  per 
the  communication  dated  23.01.2017 
(A10).  The"
"Petitioners  contend  that  as  per  the  building  application 
(A12),  such"
"application  had  been 
submitted 
to 
the  1st  Respondent  by 
the  3rd"
"Respondent  on  01.02.2017  and  the  approval  for  the  same  had  been"
"granted  on  28.12.2017.  Furthermore, 
the  payment 
relating 
to 
the"
"building  application  had  been  made  on  01.02.2017.  The  Development"
"Permit (A3) was issued by the 1st Respondent on 28.12.2017 pursuant to"
"a  meeting  of  the  planning  committee  held  on  21.12.2017.    Accordingly,"
"the Petitioners argued that the issuance of the Development Permit (A3)"
"is ultra vires as it was issued after the withdrawal of authority delegated"
"to the 1st Respondent by the UDA."
"However, the aforesaid withdrawal of the delegated authority by the UDA"
"by  its  communication  dated  23.01.2017(A10)  applies  with  effect  from"
"01.02.2017. As revealed by the Petitioner, the facts and matters relating"
"to the instant application are almost identical to that of the facts involved"
"in  Court  of  Appeal  Case  No.  CA  (Writ)  194/2017.  I  had  the  benefit  of"
"delivering  the  judgement  in  the  said  matter  as  well.  In  determining  the"
"matters  related  to  said  Case  No.  CA  (Writ)  194/2017,  it  was  brought  to"
"my attention that the UDA had issued the further communication dated"
"22.02.2017  (marked  as  3R2d  by  the  Respondents 
in  the  above  case)"
"whereby UDA has authorised the 1st and the 2nd Respondents to process"
"the applications that had been received by the 1st and the 2nd Respondent"
"prior to 01.02.2017. I see no legal impediment to taking judicial notice of"
"the  said  communication  which  forms  part  and  parcel  of  case  No.  CA"
"(Writ) 194/2017, in view of the facts and circumstances in relation to this"
"matter  are  almost  identical  to  that  of  case  no.  CA  (Writ)  194/2017.  In"
"view of the said communication dated 22.02.2017 issued by UDA, the 1st"
"and the 2nd Respondents were authorized to process the applications that"
"had  been 
received  by 
the  1st  and 
the  2nd  Respondents  prior 
to"
"01.02.2017. Accordingly, the stance taken up by the Petitioners that the"
"building  applications  received  prior  to  01.02.2017  cannot  be  processed"
"by the 1st Respondent cannot sustain."
