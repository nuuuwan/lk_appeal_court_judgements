"from 01.02.2017. However, such withdrawal applied only to the building"

"Respondent  claim 
that 
it  continued

the  above  building"
"application 1R1 which was received on 30.01.2017."
"The  aforesaid  building  application  1R1  had  been  considered  by  the"
"planning committee of the 1st Respondent Council at their meeting held"
"on  21.12.2017  and  decided  to  grant  a  Development  Permit  to  the  3rd"
"Respondent  based  on  such  application.  The  Development  Permit  has"
"been  made  in  four  copies  and  each  of  the  said  copies  has  distinct  and"
"consecutive

such 
copy 
is 
released

the"
"developer, i.e. 3rd Respondent, another copy is sent to the UDA and the"
"third  copy  is  sent  to  the  Assessorâ€™s  Department  of  the  1st  Respondent"
"Council  and  the  fourth  copy  is  retained  by  the  City  Planning  Division  of"
"the 1st Respondent Council. The documents marked A3 and A13 are one"
"of  each  such  copies  issued  in  respect  of  premises  at  No.  15  A,  Layards"

"as 
the  date  on  which 
the  application  was  handed  over 
to 
the  1st"
"Respondent, 
is 
a 
typographical 
error  made  when 
preparing 
the"
"Development  Permit  which  was  subsequently  corrected.  Hence, 
it 
is"
"claimed that the typographical error in A3 and the different numbers in"
"A3(16789)  and  A13  (16791) 
is  not  a  consequence  of  any  fraudulent"
"activity.  Accordingly,  the  Respondents  move  that  the  application  of  the"
"Petitioners be dismissed."
"On  16.11.2023  all  parties  agreed  to  dispose  this  application  by  way  of"
"written submissions. Although the parties initially agreed to abide by the"
"judgement  to  be  delivered  in  the  case  bearing  no.  CA(Writ)  194/2017,"
"subsequently the parties requested for a separate judgement."
