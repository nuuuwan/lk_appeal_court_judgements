"the  permit  A3  claiming  that  such  document  (A13)  is  the  Development"
"Permit  issued  to  the  3rd  Respondent.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioners  claim"
"that 
the  purported  Development  Permit  A3 
is 
invalid,  void 
in 
law,"
"arbitrary, fraudulent and is ultra vires."
"While  Permit  A3  bears  the  no.  16789  and  sets  out  the  date  of  the  3rd"
"Respondentâ€™s  building  application 
(A12)  as  01.02.2017, 
the  Permit"
"marked  A13  bears  a  different  and  subsequent  no. 
i.e.  16791  and  a"
"different date as the date of the building application i.e.30.01.2017. It is"
"submitted  that  such  contention  of  the  Respondents  gives  rise  to  a"
"legitimate  suspicion  in  relation  to  the  authenticity  and  reliability  of  the"
"document 
and 
the  bona 
fide 
intentions  of 
the  1st 
and 
the  2nd"
"Respondents."
"The  Petitioners  further  state  that  the  1st  Respondent  claims  that  the"
"purported  Development  Permit  A3  has  been  issued  under  the  power"
"delegated  to  the  1st  Respondent  by  the  Urban  Development  Authority"
"(UDA) in terms of Section 23(5) of the Urban Development Authority Law"
"(UDA  Law).  However,  it  is  submitted  that  the  1st  Respondent  did  not  in"
"the  first  instance  have  any  authority  or  power  whatsoever  to  issue  the"
"said Development Permit A3 as per the communication dated 23.01.2017"
"(A10)  by  which  the  UDA  recalled  the  authority  delegated  to  the  1st"
"Respondent  with  effect  from  01.02.2017.  The  building  application  A12"
"has  been  submitted  to  the  1st  Respondent  only  on  01.02.2017.  The"
"necessary  charges/fees  in  respect  of  the  said  building  application  have"
"been  paid  on  01.02.2017. 
It 
is  submitted  that  even 
if 
the  building"
"application A12 was physically submitted to the 1st Respondent prior to"
"01.02.2017  as  per  the  communication  A10,  the  1st  Respondent  had  no"
"authority 
to 
charge 
fees 
in 
respect  of  building 
application  A12."
"Consequently,  the  Petitioners  argued  that  the  Development  Permit  A13"
"too is invalid, void in law, arbitrary, fraudulent and is ultra vires."
"Accordingly, 
in  the 
instant  application,  the  Petitioners  seek 
inter  alia"
"Writs of Certiorari quashing the purported Development Permits A3 and"
"A13  and 
the  Writ  of  Prohibition  prohibiting 
the  1st  and 
the  2nd"
"Respondents from accepting any building applications and/or processing"
"such applications and /or issuing any building permit/approval."
"The  1st  and  the  2nd  Respondents  state  that  the  1st  Respondent  received"
"the building application dated 23.01.2017 (1R1) from the 3rd Respondent"
