"This  Court  is  in  agreement  with  the  view  of  his  Lordship  Janak  De  Silva  in  D.S."
"Ubeysinghe v. H.M. Gamini Seneviratne and Others (supra). Therefore, following the"
"cases of Kingsley Fernando v. Dayaratne and Others (Supra) and Urban Development"
"Authority  v.  Abeyratne  and  Others  (supra),  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus does not lie to compel the Minister to issue a vesting order exercising his"
"discretionary powers in terms of Section 39A of the Act."
"The  Petitioners  state  that  their  mother  acquired  Lots  A  and  B  of  the  land  called"
"‘Berawakanda’  depicted  in  plan  marked  P1  by  virtue  of  a  Deed  of  Transfer  dated"
"29.01.1983 marked as P8 in terms of a settlement entered in the Testamentary action"
"bearing No. 24906/T in the District Court of Colombo. Thereafter, by way of P9, P10,"

"Perches (101.8 Perches). The Petitioners have received 124.6 Perches in total by P9,"
"P10,  P20,  P32  and  P39.  According  to  the  Petitioners,  the  above-mentioned  124.6"
"Perches is part of Lot A (2 Roods and 17 1/3 Perches) and Lot B (1 Roods and 8 2/3"
