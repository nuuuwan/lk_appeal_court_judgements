"“... the divesting has to relate to the entire extent covered by the vesting Order."
"This view is further supported by section 39A (4)(a) which provides that upon a"
"divesting Order that land shall be deemed never to have vested in the State by"
"virtue of the vesting Order. Hence what is contemplated is a complete reversal"
"of the status quo ante and not a piece-meal divesting of particular portions of a"
"land that is vested. The Petitioner has sought in this application only a divesting"
"of a particular portion of the land that was vested. Therefore his application for"
"a Writ of Mandamus cannot, in any event, succeed.”"
