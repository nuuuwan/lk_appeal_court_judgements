"Tribunal issued a notice, marked as ‘X20’, summoning the Petitioners to appear"
"before it. As stated in document ‘X20’, the Director had informed the Tribunal via"
"a letter dated 19.08.2020 that the Old Boys’ Association of the relevant school had"
"lodged  a  complaint.  They  alleged  that  the  Petitioners,  acting  as  trustees,  had"
"withheld financial assistance intended for the management of the Arabic College"
"and  Hostel.  Furthermore,  the  Association  requested  the  formation  of  a  new"
"management committee to oversee the school and hostel. In response, the Wakfs"
"Tribunal directed the Petitioners to appear before it on 13.02.2021."
"In  response  to  the  said  reference,  the  Petitioners  have  invoked  the  jurisdiction  of  this"
"Court.  The  core  of  their  grievance  is  that  the  1st  Respondent  failed  to  adhere  to  the"
"procedural requirements prescribed under the Mosque and Muslim Charitable Trust or"
"Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956, as amended (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""). As stated in"
"paragraph 30 of the petition, the Petitioners assert that upon applying for and obtaining"
"the case records pertaining to Wakfs Tribunal Case No. 273/2020, they discovered that"
"the reference made by the 1st Respondent to initiate proceedings before the Tribunal was"
"marked as ‘X21’."
"The  Petitioners  contend  that  the  reference  made  by  the  1st  Respondent  was  not  in"
"accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  law.  Consequently,  they  assert  that  the  said"
"reference is unlawful, procedurally flawed, and legally untenable, and therefore ought to"
"be quashed."
"Therefore, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant section in the Act. Section 9E(2) and (3)"
"of the Act are hereby reproduced verbatim the same."
