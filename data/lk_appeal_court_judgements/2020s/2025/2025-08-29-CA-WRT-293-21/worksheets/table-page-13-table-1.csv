"without  first  obtaining  the  board’s  consent.  Consequently,  he  has  not  adhered  to  the"
"procedural requirements prescribed by the statute."
"Therefore, it is evident that for the Wakfs Tribunal to validly assume jurisdiction, strict"
"compliance with Section 9E(3) is imperative. In particular, the director must obtain prior"
"approval 
from  the  Wakfs  Board 
in  accordance  with  Section  9E(2).  This  approval"
"constitutes a mandatory condition precedent, without which the Tribunal cannot lawfully"
"exercise its jurisdiction."
"“
(3)  No application, other than an application made by the Director, shall be"
"entertained  by  the  Tribunal  under  this  section  unless  the  application  is"
"accompanied by a certificate under the hand of the Director that the application"
"has been approved by the Board.”"
"Therefore, we hold that failure to file the certificate is fatal and bad in law."
"There  is  no  indication  in  the  referenced  document  marked  as  ‘X21’  that  the"
"Director  obtained  approval  from  the  Wakfs  Board.  In  fact,  under  the  relevant"
"provisions, 
the  Wakfs  Tribunal 
is  expressly  barred 
from  entertaining  any"
"application unless it has been duly approved by the Board. In other words, for the"
"Director to invoke the jurisdiction of the Wakfs Tribunal, prior approval from the"
"Board is a mandatory prerequisite."
"In  the  present  case,  the  Director  has  failed  to  secure  such  approval,  thereby"
"neglecting to comply with the procedural requirements outlined in Section 9E(2)"
"and  (3)  of  the  Act.  This  non-compliance  with  a  statutory  condition  precedent"
"results in a fundamental lack of jurisdiction. Consequently, any order issued by"
"the Tribunal in this matter is void ab initio."
"Maxwell  on  Interpretation  of  Statutes,  12th  edition,  Pg.  328,  referring  to  'conditions"
"precedent to jurisdiction' states that,"
"“
 Where an act or thing required by statute is a condition precedent to the"
"j
urisdiction of a tribunal compliance cannot be dispensed with and, if it be"
"i
mpossible, the jurisdiction fails. It would not be competent to a court to dispense"
