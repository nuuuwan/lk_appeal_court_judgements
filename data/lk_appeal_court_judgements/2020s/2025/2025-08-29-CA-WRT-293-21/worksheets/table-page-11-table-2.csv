"Sheriff and Others v. Jamaldeen, 2000 (2) SLR  190 at page 192, Weerasuriya, J held that;"
"“Further, Section 29(7) as amended prohibits any application to the Wakfs"
"Tribunal other than by the Director to be entertained unless the same is"
"accompanied by a certificate under the hand of the Director that the"
"application has been approved by the Board. Thus, one is justified in"
"asserting that these provisions have no relevance to the instant case."
"Learned Counsel for the plaintiff-appellants contended that plaintiff-"
"appellants base their case in terms of Section 9J and that a certificate from"
"the Director is totally unnecessary. However, it is to be observed that"
"Section 9J provides the Wakfs tribunal to have exclusive jurisdiction to"
"i
nquire into matters relating to Muslim Charitable Trust or Wakfs as"
"provided for by Section 9E(1). Nevertheless, one has to be mindful that"
"Section 9E(1) encompasses an inclusive provision."
"It is convenient at this stage to consider the position the Director is placed"
"w

"Wakfs Tribunal."
