"In  light  of  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  proceedings  in  WT/273/2020  are  deemed  void  ab"
"initio and of no legal effect. Accordingly, the documents marked ‘X20’ and ‘X21’ are hereby"
"quashed."
"It is pertinent to note that, as per our determination in Case No. CA/LTA/0006/22, the"
"deed bearing No. 2125 does not constitute a Muslim Charitable Trust. Accordingly, there"
"is  no  necessity  to  revisit  or  adjudicate  that  issue  within  the  scope  of  the  present"
"application."
"Consequently,  the  Wakfs  Tribunal lacks  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  the  issue concerning"
"the alleged trust. Hence, the application stands allowed."
"Accordingly, the relief sought in the petition dated 11 June 2021 is hereby granted. A Writ"
"of Certiorari is issued, thereby quashing the purported reference dated 19 August 2020,"
"marked ‘X 21’, as well as the purported notice dated 22 January 2021, marked ‘X 20’."
