"The  issue  before  this  Court  is  whether  the  Wakfs  Board  had  issued  a  directive  in  the"
"matter, and whether, at the time the 1st Respondent–Director submitted his application"
"to the Tribunal, he furnished a certificate evidencing that the application had received"
"prior approval from the Board."
"Pursuant  to  Section  9E(3)  of  the  Act,  the  Tribunal  lacks  jurisdiction  to  entertain  any"
"application  unless  it  is accompanied  by  a certificate  issued  by  the Director.  Upon  close"
"scrutiny,  there  is  no  indication  of  when  the  1st  Respondent  referred  the  matter  to  the"
"Tribunal. Specifically, as  of  19.08.2020,  there is  no  evidence  to  suggest that the  Wakfs"
"Board  had  approved  the  reference,  nor  that  a  certificate  was  filed  along  with  the"
"application. It is therefore relevant to reproduce the document marked as ‘X21’, which is"
"the original in Tamil, and ‘X21(a)’, its corresponding English translation."
