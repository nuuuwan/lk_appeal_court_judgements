"invasion  of  the  privacy  of  the  individual  would  fall  within  the"
"exempted  category, unless the authority concerned is satisfied that  the"
"larger  public  interest  justifies  the  disclosure  of  such  information.  It  is,"
"therefore, to be understood clearly that it is a statutory exemption"
"which must operate as a rule and only in exceptional cases would"
"disclosure  be  permitted,  that  too, 
for  reasons  to  be  recorded"
"demonstrating satisfaction to the test of larger public interest. It will"
"not be in consonance with the spirit of these provisions, if in a mechanical"
"manner,  directions  are  passed  by  the  appropriate  authority  to  disclose"
"information  which  may  be  protected  in  terms  of  the  above  provisions.  All"

"all its exceptions so as to justify denial of a statutory exemption in terms of"
"the Act. In its common parlance, the expression ‘public interest’, like ‘public"
"purpose’, is not capable of any precise definition. It does not have a rigid"
"meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the statute in which it"
"occurs, the concept varying with time and state of society and its"
"needs.  [State  of  Bihar  v.  Kameshwar  Singh (AIR  1952  SC  252)].  It  also"
