"relevant to such office.” [Emphasis is added]"
"32] Thus, the well-being of society in combating corruption is the spirit of the"
"Right to Information Act, and it cannot be suppressed in any manner. The RTI"
"Act  prioritizes  the  disclosure  of  information  held  by  public  authorities.  Thus,"
"legal fees are a cost incurred by the public authority, and therefore, are generally"
"considered  disclosable  information. I  cannot  say  that  this  would  cause  an"
"unwarranted  invasion  of  privacy,  commercial  confidences,  or  information,  or"
"that 
it 
is 
legally  protected 
from  disclosure. As  noted  above,  even 
if  such"
"information  falls  under  an  exemption,  the  RTI  Act  allows  for  disclosure  if  the"
"larger public interest justifies it. It should be noted that the RTI Commission, in"
"its impugned decision, has emphasized that the primary aim of the Act is the"
"maximum disclosure of information, subject to narrowly drawn exemptions, and"
"in the case in hand, the exemption cannot be attracted."
"33]  Moreover,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  requested  information  concerns  legal"
"costs  paid  from  public  funds  and  does not  qualify  as  personal  information  or"
"information  protected  by  privilege  under  written  law.  The  Petitioner  in  the"
"written  submission  has  acknowledged 
that 
the  aggregate 
legal 
fees  were"
"published in the annual report. If so, why cannot the breakdown of legal fees be"
"disclosed?  This  court  strongly  holds  that  transparency  in  the  use  of  public"
"funds,  especially 
in 
legal  expenditures  by  public 
institutions,  cannot  be"
"considered  confidential.  The  disclosure  of  such  information  does  not  violate"
"constitutional protections under Article 14A (2) or 28(e), nor does it infringe on"
"privacy or reputational rights, as held in D.Sarathchandra v. People’s Bank"
"CA  Case  No:  RTI/09/2023,  Decided  On:  26.11.2024.  Therefore,  there  is  no"
"legitimate ground for the Petitioner to withhold the requested information from"
"the Appellant-Respondent."

In  the  above  case 
(D.  Sarathchandra  vs  People’s  Bank) 
(supra)His"
"Lordship  M.C.B.S.  Morais  J.  held 
firmly  that  the  transparency  should  be"
"maintained for the use of public funds is as;"
