"It  is  important  to  recognize  that  both  shops  were  located  adjacent  to  one  another.  The"
"Accused, in his evidence, stated that the prosecution witness had initially been inside the"
"adjoining  shop,  and  that  he  subsequently  emerged  with  her  before  both  entered  the"
"jewellery shop. Notably, the adjoining shop was found to contain a small room at its rear."
"The police, accompanied by Kanniamma, visited the site on three separate occasions. The"
"Accused did not contest the claim that the witness had entered the jewellery shop. In fact,"
"the witness herself stated that she had first entered the jewellery shop, following which"
"the Accused came out with her and then led her back inside."
"Moreover, it is relevant to note that the witness had entered the shop seeking refuge from"
"two individuals who had been following her. At the time she gave her police statement,"
"she was a 14-year-old girl."
"While there may be discrepancies in the description of the exact location  such as referring"
"to the premises as a “toy shop” versus a jewellery shop the fact remains that the adjoining"
"premises  contained  a  small  room.  It  is  well  established  in our  jurisprudence  that  even"
"truthful  witnesses  may  differ  in  minor,  incidental  details  due  to  varying  powers  of"
"observation and the passage of time."
"It  is  acknowledged  that  the  particular  jewellery  shop  did  not  have  a  room  at  its  rear."
"However,  this  inconsistency  does  not  strike  at  the  root  of  the  prosecution’s  case.  Our"
"Courts have consistently held that contradictions will only render evidence unreliable if"
"they materially affect the prosecution's case."
"I am  mindful of the  observation made by Lord  Roche in Bhojraj v. Sita Ram, 1936 AIR,"
"page 60 where he held that;"
"“Evidence substantially true not infrequently assumes too perfect a form and witnesses"
"such as children not infrequently get a story by heart which is none the less a true story."
"The real tests are : how consistent the story is with itself, how it stands the test of cross-"
"examination and how far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of"
"the case.”"
