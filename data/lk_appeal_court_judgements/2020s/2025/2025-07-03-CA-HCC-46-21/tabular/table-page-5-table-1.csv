"Sisira De Abrew, J. in CA/129/2002, decided on  28.06.2007, Appellate Court Judgments"
"(Unreported) 2007 Volume I, and held that"
"“Court  can,  however  act  on  uncorroborated  testimony  of  a  prosecutrix  if  her"
"evidence  appears  to  the  Court  to  be  completely,  satisfactory  and  there  are"
"attending circumstances which make it safe for the Court to act upon her evidence"
"without  corroboration.  If  I  may  put  it  in  another  way  that  is  if  her  evidence  is"
"capable of convincing the Court that she is speaking the truth, Court can act on"
"such testimony without corroboration. In this regard, I am guided by the judgment"
"of  Justice  Alles  with  whom  Justice  Weeramanthry  and  Justice  Thamodaram"
"agreed  in  Premasiri  vs.  Queen  77  NLR  page  86.  Justice  Alles  stated  thus:  In  a"
"charge of rape it is proper for a jury to convict on an uncorroborated evidence of"
"the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as to convince the"
"jury that she is speaking the truth.”"
