"PW1  experienced  marked  physical  discomfort.  Thereafter,  the  Accused  directed  her  to"
"dress and leave the room."
"PW1 then returned to the front area of the shop where she had been previously seated."
"She  subsequently  proceeded  to  a  nearby  wade  shop  and  sat  down.  While  there,  she"
"recalled  that  she  had  left  her  umbrella  at  the  jewellery  shop  and  returned  briefly  to"
"retrieve it. She remained at the wade shop for approximately one hour."
"Later, a person by the name of Narayana arrived. PW1 informed him that she was feeling"
"unwell and requested to be taken to the residence of Pushparani. Narayana complied and"
"escorted her to Pushparani’s house."
"On the following day, PW1’s brother arrived and took her to his residence. Initially, PW1"
"did not disclose the incident to her sister-in-law; however, she recounted the events the"
"next  day.  PW1  stated  that  she  had  been  visibly  distressed—crying,  feeling  faint,  and"
"experiencing  headaches.  When  her  sister-in-law  inquired  about  her  condition,  PW1"
"narrated the sequence of events that had taken place at the Accused’s shop."
"Thereafter, the sister-in-law informed PW1’s brother, and both accompanied her to the"
"Kalawana  Police  Station  on  7th  August  2025.  A  formal  police  entry  was  made,  and  a"
"statement was recorded from PW1."
"Following  the  lodging  of  the  complaint,  PW1  was  escorted  by  police  officers  to  the"
"Kalawana  Hospital  for  a  medical  examination.  She  was  subsequently  referred  to  the"
"Ratnapura Hospital for further medical examination."
"During  cross-examination, it  emerged  that, in her police statement dated  22nd  August"
"2005, PW1 had described the location of the incident as a ""jewellery  shop."" However, she"
"also indicated that the incident occurred inside a room within the gold jewellery shop. The"
"learned Counsel for the Accused emphasized this inconsistency, asserting that there was"
"a  significant  discrepancy  regarding  the  exact  location  where  the  alleged  incident  took"
"place."
"According to the testimony of the witness, the incident took place in a rear section of the"
"jewellery  shop,  which  was  said  to  contain  a  room.  However,  when  police  officers  later"
"visited the location, no such room was found at the rear of the gold jewellery shop. It was"
"noted, however, that there was a room adjoining the shop."
