"In whole, upon the plain reading of P3, it is observed that by the sale of the said division"
"of the Petitioner and forcibly transferring the work force without their consent to the"
"buyer  the  Petitioner  has  in  fact  effected  a  closure  of  the  division  of  business  that"
"employed the Respondents in as much as the Petitioner is concerned."
"T
he Petitioner has also cited that the Petitioner has the right to reorganize their business"
"and  also  cited  on  retrenchment,  the  case  of  Kumara  Ferando  v.  Commissioner  of"
"Labour  (2007)  1  SLR  124.  However,  this  Court  observes  that  the  facts  of  this  case"
"defer. As per the Petitioner’s own submissions there is no retrenchment of workmen."
"The Petitioner also cited the case of The Caledonian Estate v. Hillman 79 NLR 421"
"and Superintendent v. Ceylon Estates Staff Union 73 NLR 574. The said cases have"
"also been considered by the Court and find that the facts of the said cases differ from"
"the case before me. The case of Paradigm Clothing (Pvt) Ltd v. Chandramadu and"
"others [2019] 1 SLR 494, pertains to the Respondents’ failure to mitigate their loss."
"However, the facts of the said case differ from the facts of the case before me."
"H
as the Petitioner sought to quash the findings and the decision of the inquiring"
"officer?"
"The Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order/determination marked"
"as  P3.  The  learned  ASG  strenuously  contended  that  the  document  marked  as  P3  is"
"neither  an  Order  nor  a  determination.  Hence,  it  is  his  contention  that  quashing  the"
"document marked as P3 is futile."
"I
t is further contended that the Petition is defective, in so much as the Petitioner has"
"failed to quash the decision of the inquiring officer. It is also his contention that P3 is"
"only  the  communication  and  not  the  decision.  What  the  Petitioner  is  seeking  by"
"quashing P3 is to quash the communication of the decision to the Petitioner company."
"The said inquiry and the decision of the inquiring officer has been marked as 1R1 by"
"the Respondents. I have considered the said findings marked as 1R1 where the inquiring"
"officer has analyzed the evidence and given reasons for her conclusions. Keep it as it"
"may, I may now consider the next argument raised as to the payment of compensation"
"to the Respondent employees."
"I
s the 5th to 22nd Respondents entitled to compensation?"
"The Petitioner Company put forth an argument that the Respondent employees are not"
"entitled  to  any  compensation  because  the  purpose  of  awarding  compensation  is  to"
"alleviate the “consequences of unavoidable employment”.  It was their contention that"
"the Respondents would not have suffered financial loss if they had accepted the letters"
"17"
