"A
 
nil Goonaratne J. in Institute of Technological Studies v. Commissioner of Labour"
"and others  [2009]  2  SLR  130  acknowledges  that  the  TEWA  does  not  provide  for  a"
"definition of a closure of a business and discusses at length the definition of a closure"
"of a business in terms of TEWA."
"T
he facts of the case draw parallels to the Application before me."
"I
n  the  above  case  the  three  employees  were  employed  as  security  personnel  by  the"
"Petitioner.  Due  to  their  unsatisfactory  conduct,  the  Petitioner  employed  an  external"
"company to provide complete security. The  three employees (the Respondents) were"
"offered  continued  employment  with  the  company  providing  security  under  the  same"
"terms  and  conditions  as  they  were  employed  by  Petitioner  with  recognition  of  their"
"previous services. The employees refused and complained to the Commissioner General"
"of Labour under TEWA. One of the main arguments by the Petitioner against the Order"
"of the Commissioner was that there was no closure of the business. His Lordship stated"
"that:"
"“It must also be noted that the unilateral discontinuation of the 3 workmen in the"
"security  division  would  constitute  a  constructive  closure  of  the  type  of  work"
"carried out by these workman in a branch or section within the whole business"
"activity of the Petitioner.”"
"I
t  is  observed  that  in  the  instant  case  before  me  too  the  division  the  5th  to  22nd"
"Respondents worked had come to an end with the Petitioner Company."
"I
n reality as far as the Respondent employees are concerned, their employment with the"
"Petitioner was terminated due to the sale of their place of employment to another entity."
"In my view, the document marked as P3 has considered this aspect and has come to the"
"conclusion  that  by  the  sale  of  the  Integration  Business  Solution  Division  of  the"
"Petitioner they have terminated the services of the employee Respondents and it further"
"states as per section 2 of TEWA this had been done without obtaining the consent of"
"the  employees  or  the  Commissioner  General  of  Labour.  As  there  is  no  Integrated"
"Business  Solution  Division  in  operation,  the  Commissioner  has  concluded  that  there"
"cannot  be  reinstatement.  Hence,  in  my  view,  for  the  aforementioned  reasons,  the"
"Commissioner has come to a conclusion that there is a closure when the business was"
"sold."
