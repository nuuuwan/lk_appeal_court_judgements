"The  Petitioner  contended  that  the  date  of  termination  in  P3  is  incorrect.  Hence  the"
"argument P3 is bad in law. The Court finds the said ground is not pleaded as a ground"
"impugning P3 in the Petition. However, for completeness let me consider this argument."
"D
ate of termination"
"The Petitioner also contended that the communication of the Order is wrong in as much"
"as the compensation is computed as in the said Order the inquiring officer has come to"
"the  conclusion  that  the  termination  has  commenced  from  05.04.2018.  However,  the"
"Petitioner in their arguments argued that they have issued the cessation of employment"
"letter  to  be  effective  only  from  01.05.2018.  Hence  the  argument  that  the  employees"
"work has been terminated on 01.05.2018. This submission at its face value establishes"
"that  whether  it  is  on  05.04.2018  or  on  01.05.2018,  there  is  a  termination  of  the"
"employment of the employer. Be it as it may, this Court has considered the decision of"
"the inquiring officer in 1R1. In the said decision the inquiring officer has come to the"
"finding that the employees have been asked to report to the new employer from the letter"
"dated  05.04.2018.  Hence,  the  inquiring  officer  has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the"
"termination of employees had occurred from 05.04.2018 which was the date the letter"
"of appointment was communicated to the employee Respondents."
"T
he Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the findings of the inquiring officer to"
"be  erroneous.  There  was  no  evidence  tendered  to  the  Commissioner  or  to  Court  to"
"establish that the employees have worked or been paid all their dues from 05.04.2018."
"I  find  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  this  contention.    Further,  this  Court"
"observes that the letter of appointment sent to the 13th Respondent by Fintek, which is"
"reflected on page 801 of the brief, is dated 01.04.2018, which has been communicated"
"to the Respondent by the letter dated 05.04.2018 (page 799 of the brief). In my view,"
"these  two  documents  buttress  the  findings  of  the  inquiring  officer  in  coming  to  the"
"conclusion of the date of termination."

"It is observed that the decision of the inquiring officer dated 28.12.2020 is marked as"
"1R1.  The  impugned  document  P3  is  dated  21.1.2021.  The  Petitioner  has  filed  this"
"Application  only  on  22.07.2021  which  is  after  a  lapse  of  six  months.  However,  this"
"Court observes that the Petitioner has not explained the delay in filing this Application"
"although in their Petition they state that due to the â€œexigent circumstances under which"
"the Application was filed and the COVID-19 situation which prevailed in the country,"
