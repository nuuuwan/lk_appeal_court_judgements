"Petitioner. As stated, this has been held in Hassan v. Fairline Garments (supra) where","",""
"the Court, referring to the contract of employment, held that:","",""
"“………the","letter  of  appointment,  shows 
that","the  appellant’s  contract  of"
"","employment  was  with  the  Company.  He  was  recruited  and  employed  by  the",""
"","Company.  He  in  turn  agreed  to  serve  the  Company.  He  undertook  and  was",""
"","obliged to work for the Company, for which he was paid by the Company. His",""
"","hours  of  work  and  the  power  of  control  over  his  work  were  laid  down  and",""
"","exercised  by  the  Company.  But  there  is  nothing  in  the  contract  which  would",""
"","enable  or  empower  the  Company  to  transfer,  unilaterally,  the  right  to  or  the",""
"","benefit  of  his  services  to  another  legal  person  or  entity.  The  Court  of  Appeal",""
"","seems to have placed some reliance on clauses 4 of A1 to justify the transfer of",""
"","the appellant. This clause, no doubt, expressly provided that the appellant should",""
"","carry out all duties entrusted to him by the Company. But there is no agreement",""
"","(expressed or implied) that he should obey orders or carry out duties of another",""
"","company.  A  workman  has  an  inalienable  right  to  choose  for  himself  the",""
"","employer he will serve. Once the contract of employment between himself and",""
"the  employer","is  established  the  employer  cannot  transfer  his  services","to"
"","another without his consent or against his will.”  (emphasis added).",""
