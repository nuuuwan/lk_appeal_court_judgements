"In  support  of  arriving  at  this  conclusion,  this  Court  relies  on  the  case  of  Sascons"
"Knitting Company (Pvt) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Labour (Supra) where it was held"
"that"
"“Hence, as discussed earlier, a transfer of employees from Sascon Knitting to"
"another company cannot take place in terms of the contract. The employees are"
"not liable to be transferred as contemplated  by the 1st question of  law raised"
"before this Court. Thus, the transfer of employees from Sascon Knitting to San"
"Fashions  without  the  consent  of  the  employees,  in  my  view,  amounts  to  an"
"implied  termination  of  its  employment  with  Sascon  Knitting.  If  such  implied"
"termination is permitted, it would amount to termination of employment without"
"any  terminal  benefits  being  paid  to  the  employees  and  would,  offend  and  go"
"against the gravamen of the Act itself.”"
