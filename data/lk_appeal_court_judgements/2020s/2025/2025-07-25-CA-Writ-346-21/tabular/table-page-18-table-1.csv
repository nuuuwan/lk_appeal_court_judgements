"of appointment given by Fintek. This Court has considered the Petitioner’s argument."
"However, as stated elsewhere in this judgement by the Petitioner’s act of divesting the"
"Integrated  Business  Solutions  Division  amounts  to  implied  termination.  Although"
"alternative employment was provided by Fintek, which is a separate legal entity to that"
"of the Petitioner, it is an employee’s inalienable right to choose who their employer is."
"If  I  am  to  accede  to  the  Petitioner’s  above  contention,  it  would  result  in  a  position"
"whereby an employer is allowed to forcefully impose on the employee, a new employer,"
"and the first employer with whom they had a contract of employment can absolve itself"
"from liability. When the Respondent  employees received their letters of cessation of"
"employment,  it  amounted  to  a  termination.  The  parties  were  not  at  dispute  that  the"
"division the employees were employed at is no longer in operation with the Petitioner."
"The inquiring officer has considered the above in the decision marked as 1R1 and has"
"awarded the compensation under section 6A of TEWA. In the above circumstances, the"
"Court finds that the Petitioner’s argument that the Respondents through their acts have"
"disentitled themselves from compensation is not tenable."
