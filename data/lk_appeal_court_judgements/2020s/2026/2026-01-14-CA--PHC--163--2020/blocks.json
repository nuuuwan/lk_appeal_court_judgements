By order dated 10 May 2018, the learned Magistrate held that the court was precluded from examining the objections or the correctness of the certificate and directed recovery of the amount stated therein as a fine, with imprisonment in default. Aggrieved by this order, the Appellant invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Colombo, which ultimately dismissed the revision, endorsing the binding effect of the certificate. The Appellant thereafter invoked the appellate and, in certain instances, revisionary (CA CPA 127/19) jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, seeking to impugn both the Magistrate\u2019s order and the determination of the Provincial High Court on the basis that it was not the defaulter, that the inquiry before the Commissioner of Labour was vitiated by breaches of natural justice, and that the courts below had erred in treating the certificate as conclusive in the absence of proof of the foundational employer\u2013employee relationship.",
