It needs to be reminded that it is for the very purpose that the legislature by its wisdom has enacted and introduced Article 14A by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic, where right to access to information has been enshrined as a fundamental right. I am of the view that when interpreting the provisions of the RTI Act, it is in this spirit of the intentions of the legislature, the relevant Act or Acts should be interpreted by the relevant authority and not to take cover in order to avoid providing the information asked for, unless such information can be denied in terms of section 5 of the RTI Act. Even in instances where the RTI Act provides for the denial of access to information, it has been stated that if the public interest in disclosing the information outweighs the harm that would result in its disclosure, such information should be released. The petitioner further contended that the suspense account contains third-party information. The RTIC specifically requested from the petitioner whether the petitioner could sever any third-party information, if any, and provide the remaining information requested by the 2nd respondent. The RTIC in their order specifically mentioned that the commission at the hearing directed the Public Authority to respond whether only the information related to the information requested of the 2nd respondent can be released, under and in terms of Section 6 of the RTIC Act. In the order of the commission, it has been observed as follows: \u201cAs the record demonstrates, though repeatedly called upon by the commission to establish as to why/how the requisite information in item no. 3 cannot be severed under Section 6 of the RTIC Act, in terms of extracting only",

    "text": "the information relevant to the appellant and provided to him, the Public Authority has been unable to justify/explain as to why this cannot be done.\u201d Section 6 of the RTIC Act is as follows: \u201cWhere a request for information is refused on any of the grounds referred to in section 5, access shall nevertheless be given to that part of any record or document which contains any information that is not exempted from being disclosed under that section, and which can reasonably be severed from any part that contains information exempted from being disclosed.\u201d If the petitioner\u2019s position is that the information of 3rd parties contained in those documents cannot reasonably be severed, such an explanation should have been given at the inquiry before the RTIC, especially when the RTIC specifically asked the petitioner whether the petitioner can act under section 6 of the RTI Act. The presumption is that the legislature inserted this section for a purpose, and the legislative intention is that every part of the statute should have effect. The legislature does not waste words or say anything in vain or for no purpose. A construction which leads to the redundancy of a portion of the statute cannot be accepted. In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and another v. State of U.P. - AIR 1953 SC 394 at page 397, it was held that, \"It is incumbent on the court to avoid a construction, if reasonably permissible on the language, which would render a part of the statute devoid of any meaning or application\". The 2nd respondent does not seek to have information with regard to a 3rd party. Basically, the 2nd respondent is seeking information with regard to the account of the partnership in which the 2nd respondent is the Managing Partner. The audit report that the 2nd respondent seeks is not the petitioner\u2019s annual audit report or a similar document. The 2nd respondent seeks to have only the report on the audit or inquiry carried out in regard to his complaint regarding the partnership account. In regard to the suspense account, the 2nd respondent is not seeking any third-party information. He is seeking only the details in regard to the account of the partnership in which he is the Managing Partner. As noted above, if there is any third-party information, the petitioner may redact details relating to any third party.",
