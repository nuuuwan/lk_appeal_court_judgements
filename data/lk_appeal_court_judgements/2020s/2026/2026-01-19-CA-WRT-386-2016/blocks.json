The 1st Respondent, at paragraph 14 of the Objections, has stated that the Assessments marked X (1) to X (8) were issued to the Petitioner based on the aforesaid proviso. The proviso grants the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner the liberty to formulate an opinion as to the conduct of the Assessee. If the Assessee intends to challenge these allegations, the appropriate remedy is stipulated under Section 165 of the Inland Revenue Act. Accordingly, an appeal has already been lodged by the Petitioner and is pending before the 1st Respondent at the time of filing this application. Therefore, I view that it is premature to conclude that the Assessments marked X (1) to X (8) are time-barred at this stage. Unmeritorious Conduct of the Petitioner",
