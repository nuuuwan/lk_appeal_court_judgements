JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) with 2nd Accused were indicted in the High Court of Gampaha

under Section 296 of the Penal Code for committing the murder of

Liyanadura Richard Patrick Fernando on or about 18.12. 2001.

CA/HCC/0057/24

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Gampaha. As the

Appellant absconded the court and after leading evidence under Section

241(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, fixed his case

in absentia of the Appellant. As per the request of the 2nd Accused, the non-

jury trial commenced against him. After the conclusion of the prosecution

case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence and the 2nd

Accused had given evidence from the witness box and closed his case. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced him to death

on 03/08/2023.

The 2nd Accused was acquitted from this case.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. Also, at the time of

argument the Appellant was connected via the Zoom platform from prison.

At the very outset, the learned Deputy Solicitor General brought to the notice

of this case that this appeal is out of time about 11 years.

In this case, the judgement was pronounced on 10.05.2012. The Appellant

was arrested and produced in court on 16.06.2023. Since the Appellant was

not represented, a Counsel was assigned on 23.06.2023. An inquiry under

Section 241(3) was held by the learned High Court Judge. On the very first

day of the inquiry, the learned Assigned Counsel had made a lengthy

submission to justify his absence to the Court. The Appellant also gave

evidence under oath on 18.07.2023 and he was subjected to a lengthy cross

examination by the State.

The learned High Court Judge, pronounced his order on 03.08.2023, and

arrived at the conclusion that the Appellant had wilfully absconded the

CA/HCC/0057/24

Court, and therefore activated the death sentence already pronounced

against the Appellant on 10.05.2012.

The Appellant now appealed against the sentence imposed on 10.05.2012,

after 11 years. It is very clear from his Petition of Appeal, that he appealed

against the sentence not against the order delivered on 03.08.2023 after the

241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 by the learned

High Court Judge.

In Sri Lanka, the period of time taken for a criminal appeal would depend on

the court the original case was heard in and the court the appeal is being

made to. The general time limits for the respective Courts are as follows:

• From a Magistrate's Court to the High Court: The appeal must be filed

within 14 days of the date of judgment.

• From a High Court exercising original criminal jurisdiction to the

Court of Appeal: The appeal must be filed within 14 days of the date

of conviction/judgment.

• Appeals by the Attorney-General: The time limit is generally longer,

such as 28 days for appeals from the Magistrate's Court or High

Court.

In Rajapaksha v The State [2001] 2 SLR 161 the court held that:

(1) The journal entries indicate that the accused - appellant did not give

any reasons for his absence from court and it was only then that the

trial Judge had proceeded to enforce the sentence imposed on him on

22.7.98 to be operative from 2.9.99.

In terms of S. 241 (3) the accused person if he appears before Court and

satisfies court that his absence at the trial was bona fide, the court shall

set aside the conviction/sentence/order and the trial then would be

fixed de - novo.

(ii) The essence of a judgment consists in the reason for conviction of

acquittal of an accused person. The judgment in this case is a well-

reasoned out judgment.

(iii) The period of time within which an appeal should be preferred must

be calculated from the date on which the reasons are given. The

conviction/sentence was given on 22.7.98. The Petition of Appeal was

lodged on 17.9.1999. The appeal is therefore out of time.

(iv) An application in Revision should not be entertained save in

exceptional circumstances. When considering this issue court must

necessarily have regard to the contumacious conduct of the accused in

jumping bail and thereafter his conduct in a manner to circumvent and

subvert the process of the law and judicial institutions. In addition, the

party should come before Court without unreasonable delay.

In the case of Padmasiri v Attorney General 2012(1) SLR 24, it was held:

“….if we are to allow this application it would amount to condescending or,

the court lending its hands to a person who is guilty of contumacious

conduct and thereby assisting him. Therefore, we hold that the petition of

appeal is not properly constituted and is out of time.”

In this case as stated earlier, the Appellant lodged an appeal against the

judgment. Considering the provisions of law, his appeal is out of time. He

could not succeed in the inquiry held under Section 241(3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. Had he been successful in the inquiry he could have

had the benefit of a trial in de-novo.

In this case, the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. She has properly analyzed

the evidence given by both sides in her judgment.

Therefore, I dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant as it is out of time.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgement to the High Court of

Gampaha along with the original case record.
