Judgment

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) in this case along

with 6 other accused were indicted in the High Court of Kalutara for committing

following offences:

I. On or about 11.02.1995, within the jurisdiction of this court, being

members of an unlawful assembly with the common object of causing

hurt to Suppaiah Sodaladaman and thereby committing an offence

punishable under Section 140 of the Penal Code

II. While being members of the aforesaid unlawful assembly causing the

death of Suppaiah Sodaladaman by one or few members of the said

unlawful assembly and thereby committing an offence punishable under

Section 296 read together with Section 146 of the Penal Code

III. Causing the death of Suppaiah Sodaladaman and thereby committing an

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code

IV. While being members of the aforesaid unlawful assembly causing

mischief by destroying Thosse Suppaiah’s residence by one or few

members of the said unlawful assembly and thereby committing an

offence punishable under Section 410 read with Section 146 of the Penal

Code

V. Causing mischief by destroying Thosse Suppaiah' residence and thereby

committing an offence punishable under Section 420 read together with

Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. The trial was conducted by the learned High Court Judge sitting without a jury.

During the trial, two eyewitnesses, namely PW3 and PW4, as well as official

witnesses PW11, PW12, PW10, PW8, and the Interpreter of the High Court,

testified for the prosecution. All the accused thereafter made dock statements and

closed their case.

CA/HCC/0181/2020

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Judge convicted the appellant (the 6th

Accused) for the third count in the indictment and accordingly sentenced him to

death. The 1st to 5th and 7th accused were acquitted from all counts. It is against the

said conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred this appeal.

4. In the petition of appeal, four grounds were urged by the appellant. However, in the

written submissions dated 20.04.2022, the appellant confined his grounds of appeal

to two grounds, namely,

a. Has the Learned trial Judge failed to comply with the provisions of Section

195(cc) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act which denied the appellant

a Constitutional right resulting a denial of justice?

b. Has the learned trial Judge considered any evidence favorable to the

appellant when he found that the prosecution has proved their case beyond

reasonable doubt?

5. Nevertheless, during the course of argument, learned counsel for the appellant

principally contended that the alleged incident occurred in the course of a sudden

fight and, therefore, the appellant could not properly have been convicted of murder,

but only of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

6. It was his position that the conviction should have been in terms of exception 4 of

section 294 of the Penal Code on the basis of an act committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel.

7. It can be observed that during the trial, no such Exception was pleaded by the

appellant. However, our Superior Courts have consistently held that even if no such

exception has been pleaded by an accused person during a trial, it is the duty of a

trial Judge to consider whether such circumstances do exist. Following authorities

have emphasized this position.

8. In the case of King Vs. Bellana Withanage Eddin 41 NLR 345, a Court of Criminal

Appeal held thus;

“In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury, the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to

CA/HCC/0181/2020

4 | P a g e

murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the evidence of Page 8 of

14 record, although such defence was not raiser nor relied upon by the

accused.”

9. In The King Vs. Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505, it was held,

“Failure on the part of a prisoner or his counsel to take up a certain line

of defence does not relieve the judge of the responsibility of putting the jury

such defence if it arises on the evidence.”

10. In the case of The King Vs. Withanalage Lanty 42 NLR 317, the Court of Criminal

Appeal, observed the following;

“There was evidence in this case upon which it was open to the jury to say

that it came within exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code and that

the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

However, no such plea was put forward on his behalf. In the course of his

charge to the jury, the presiding judge preferred to this evidence as part of

the defence story but not as evidence upon which a lesser verdict possibly

be based. It was the duty of the presiding judge to have so directed the jury

and that in the circumstances, the appellant was entitled to have the benefit

of the lesser verdict.”

11. The above line of authorities further establishes that for a trial Judge to consider

whether there was provocation, which reduce the offence of murder to that of a

lesser culpability, there must be evidence available in the trial.

12. Since the counsel for the appellant primarily contended that the alleged incident

occurred during a fight, I shall first consider whether the evidence led at the trial is

sufficient to support the inference that the fatal injury to the deceased was caused

in the course of a sudden fight, without any premeditation.

Relevant Law:

CA/HCC/0181/2020

5 | P a g e

13. Section 294 of the Penal Code defines the offence of murder. However, the section

contains five Exceptions which operate to reduce the offence of murder to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder. In the present appeal, the appellant seeks to

bring his case within Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code, which reads:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a

sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender

having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation- It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or

commits the first assault.

14. In the case of Gamini vs. The Attorney General (2011) 1 SLR 236, it was held,

1. Though the accused-appellant in his defence did not take up the defence

of grave and sudden provocation, the trial Judge must consider such a

plea in favour of the accused-appellant if it emanates from the evidence

of the prosecution.

2. Failure on the part of the petitioner or his Counsel to take up a certain

line of defence does not relive a Judge of the responsibility of putting to

the jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.”

15. In Bandara v. The Attorney-General [2011] 2 Sri L.R. 55, the Supreme Court has

re-emphasised that an accused who seeks to avail himself of the benefit of reduced

culpability on the basis of a sudden fight, in terms of Exception 4, bears the burden

of satisfying the Court that the requisite conditions of that exception are fulfilled.

Accordingly, in the present appeal, it is incumbent upon the appellant to establish,

on a balance of probabilities, that the incident occurred during a sudden fight within

the meaning of Exception 4 to Section 294, if he is to obtain the benefit of the lesser

degree of culpability contemplated therein.

16. The question whether the appellant has sufficiently discharged his evidentiary

burden before the trial court in respect of all the requisite elements can be answered

only upon a careful consideration of the evidence placed before that court. The

CA/HCC/0181/2020

6 | P a g e

narrative of the prosecution witnesses, particularly that of the two eyewitnesses to

the incident, does not support a finding that the incident occurred during a sudden

fight within the meaning of Exception 4. Likewise, the evidence of the appellant,

presented by way of a statement from the dock, also fails to establish the existence

of such a sudden fight.

17. The Supreme Court of India, in its judgment of Bhagwan Munjaji Pawade v State

of Maharastra AIR 1979 SC 133, dealt with a similar situation. In that case, the

deceased, who had just returned home, upon observing that his mother was engaged

in a heated argument with the appellant, inquired of the appellant as to the reason

for the altercation. Thereupon, the appellant attacked the deceased three times on

the head with an axe, twice with the blunt side and once with the sharp edge. In the

appeal, the Supreme Court held that a

“ ‘[F]ight’ postulates a bilateral transaction in which blows are exchanged.

The deceased was unarmed. He did not cause any injury to the appellant or

his companions. Furthermore, not less than three fatal injuries were

inflicted by the appellant with an axe, which is a formidable weapon on the

unarmed victim. Appellant, is therefore, not entitled to the benefit of

Exception 4, either”.

18. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Indian Supreme Court in the judgment of

State Of Orissa vs Khageswar Naik & Others (2013) SCC 649, in order to set aside

the conviction already entered against the accused for the offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of a sudden fight, and in order to

alter the same into a conviction for murder. The Court considered the evidence and

decided to interfere with the conviction entered erroneously by the lower Court for

the lessor offence on the footing that there was no ‘fight’ between the accused and

the deceased, since the evidence indicated that it was only a one-sided attack. The

Court stated

“[I]n the case in hand, the convicts had entered the room of the daughter of

the deceased in midnight, molested her and the poor father, perhaps

because of his age, could not do anything other than to abuse the convicts.

He gave choicest abuses but did not fight with the convicts. Verbal abuses

CA/HCC/0181/2020

7 | P a g e

are not ‘fight’ as it is well settled that at least two persons are needed to

fight.

19. In Pappu vs State of M.P. (2006) 7SCC 391, the Supreme Court of India held:

The help of Exception 4 can be invoked only if death is caused

a. Without premeditation;

b. In a sudden fight;

c. Without the offenders having taken undue advantage or acted in a

cruel or unusual manner; and,

d. The fight must have been with the person killed.

To bring a case within Exception 4, all the ingredients mentioned in it must be

found. It is to be noted that the ‘fight’ occurring in Exception to Section 300 of IPC

is not defined in the IPC. It takes two make a fight. Heat of passion requires that

there must be no time for the passion to cool down and in this case, the parties have

worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning.

A fight is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without

weapons, it is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed

to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or

not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case.

20. The first witness to testify for the prosecution was PW3, Suppaiah Subramanium, a

brother of the deceased. According to his evidence, the deceased and other family

members were residing in line rooms at the Panthiya Estate. While PW3 lived in a

line room with his parents and sisters, the deceased occupied a line room situated

at the corner. He further testified that on the day of the incident, at around 12.00

noon, the 7th accused had quarreled with his wife over an incident in which the 7th

accused had struck their goats.

21. Thereafter, at around 7.30 p.m., the appellant came to their line rooms and

attempted to assault PW3’s father. The witness intervened and led his father inside

a line room. At that moment, the deceased emerged, and the appellant (6th accused)

stabbed him.

CA/HCC/0181/2020

8 | P a g e

22. According to the witness, after stabbing the deceased, all the accused fled the scene.

The witness categorically stated that it was the appellant who stabbed the deceased

in the chest with a pointed knife. PW3 further testified that three kerosene lamps

were burning, one inside the house and two outside, providing sufficient light to

identify the appellant. Moreover, the appellant was a known person to the witness,

and therefore, there could have been no difficulty in identifying him. The witness

also stated that he could not take the deceased to the hospital until the police arrived.

23. T. Suppiah, PW4, was another eyewitness who testified for the prosecution. He was

the father of the deceased. According to his evidence, the incident that led to the

death of the deceased occurred inside line room No. 05, where PW4 resided. The

witness identified the appellant as the person who stabbed the deceased. According

to PW4, the stabbing took place at around 9.00 p.m.

24. PW11, M.M. Weerakoon, was a Sub-Inspector of Police during the relevant period.

Upon receiving information, he, along with a team of officers, proceeded to the

scene of the crime and transported the deceased to the hospital in a police vehicle.

The medical officer who examined the deceased pronounced him dead. Thereafter,

PW11 returned to the crime scene and made his observations.

25. His observations corroborated the evidence of PW4, who stated that when the

accused came to their line room, they pelted stones and caused damage to the

property. It is also pertinent to note that human blood was detected by the

Government Analyst on the sarong recovered from the possession of the appellant,

and this evidence remains unchallenged. No plausible explanation was offered by

the appellant in this regard.

26. While certain discrepancies are discernible in the testimony of PW4, the evidence

of PW3 does not contain any material contradictions or omissions that go to the root

of the case. The incident occurred in February 1995, and the trial commenced only

in March 2016. It is therefore unreasonable to expect witnesses to recall every detail

without any discrepancy after a lapse of 21 years. What is crucial is that the

discrepancies identified are not of such a nature as to undermine the credibility of

the prosecution’s evidence.

CA/HCC/0181/2020

9 | P a g e

27. PW3 clearly testified that the stabbing occurred inside the line room, and PW14,

relying on observations made at the scene, corroborated this account. The appellant

was well known to the witnesses, having resided in the same area for a considerable

period. It was also undisputed that the line room was illuminated by kerosene lamps

at the time of the incident. Given that the appellant frequently visited a nearby

boutique and was familiar to the witnesses, his identity was never in dispute or

question.

28. Accordingly, the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that the 6th

appellant stabbed the deceased, who subsequently succumbed to his injuries.

Medical evidence confirms that the fatal injury was inflicted by a double-edged

sharp cutting weapon, with the stab penetrating the right side of the chest and

piercing the upper part of the right lung. The doctor opined that the injury was

sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.

29. Since counsel for the appellant contended that the incident occurred during a sudden

fight without premeditation, it is necessary to examine whether the evidence

adduced at the trial would justify the Court in arriving at such an inference.

30. The evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the commencement and

continuation of the attack on the deceased revealed that he did not even once attack

the appellant, who launched a surprise attack when he came near him. It was clearly

a one side attack, which left no room at all for the unsuspecting and unarmed

deceased even to run away from his assailant.

31. What is important to note from the above description and analysis of the evidence

is the fact that there was no ‘fight’ between the deceased and the seven accused,

though the stabbing on the deceased seemed to be a sudden one.

32. The evidence made available to the trial Court clearly suggests that this was not a

single incident where the appellant has stabbed the deceased, but an incident which

has taken place over an incident happened several days prior to the main incident

and also triggered by an incident happened around 12.00 noon on the day of the

incident.

CA/HCC/0181/2020

10 | P a g e

33. As noted earlier, there is no evidence to suggest that the deceased had ever engaged

in any quarrel with the appellant. Clearly, the deceased was unarmed and had not

exhibited any conduct indicating an intention to attack or confront the appellant. He

was merely walking out carrying some rotties when he was stabbed by the appellant.

34. As discernible from the evidence, it was the appellant, accompanied by others, who

went to the line room where the deceased and his family resided. They initially

assaulted PW4, following which PW3 led PW4 into the line room. There is no

evidence to suggest that any member of the deceased’s family had engaged with the

appellant or with any of the other accused who accompanied him. The stabbing of

the deceased appears to have been wholly unprovoked, as the deceased had done

nothing to provoke the appellant. He was merely coming out holding some rotties

in his hands when the stabbing occurred. In view of these facts, the applicability of

the exception relating to a sudden fight is clearly ruled out.

35. Furthermore, PW3 testified that the accused prevented the injured from being taken

to the hospital. Although the defence suggested that this fact was not mentioned in

the statement made by PW3 to the police and therefore amounted to an omission,

no such omission was subsequently proved through the relevant police witnesses.

It is evident from the record that the deceased remained at the scene of the crime

until the police arrived, and it was PW11 who ultimately transported the deceased

to the hospital in a police vehicle. Had the deceased not been prevented from being

taken to hospital, his relatives would not reasonably have kept him at the scene

despite the stab injury to the chest and profuse bleeding.

36. This circumstance lends corroboration to the testimony of PW3 that the accused

obstructed the removal of the deceased to hospital. Moreover, the medical evidence

establishes that an injury of this nature required immediate medical attention and

that, if treatment was not administered within two to three hours, the injured person

would likely succumb to the injuries.

37. The aforesaid conduct of the accused in preventing the deceased from being taken

to the hospital further demonstrates that the stabbing was not the result of a sudden

fight, but rather a consequence of a premeditated attack. Such conduct is wholly

CA/HCC/0181/2020

11 | P a g e

inconsistent with the requirements of Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code

and, accordingly, precludes the act from being brought within its ambit.

38. Therefore, it is the view of this Court that this incident would not fall under

exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code. Thus, I am strongly convinced and

inclined to accept the validity of the reasoning adopted by the Indian Supreme Court

in the aforementioned judgments in relation to the instant appeal, as the underlying

principle that had been enunciated upon the factual considerations contained therein

are very similar, if not, almost identical, with the evidence presented before the trial

Court on this particular aspect.

39. In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs, I am of the firm

view that there was no sudden fight, in terms of Exception 4 of Section 294 of the

Penal Code, between the appellant and the deceased. Nor was there any evidence to

infer that the deceased was engaged or at least attempted to engage with the

appellant. The deceased was unarmed and was bringing some rotties when the

alleged stabbing took place. It is true that PW4 was assaulted shortly before the

stabbing took place but no evidence was forthcoming to evince that the deceased

had ever taken part in that incident or even tried to prevent the appellant from

attacking PW4.

40. Thus it is evident that there was no ‘fight’ between the deceased and the appellant,

though the stabbing on him seemed to be a sudden one. It was for the appellant to

satisfy the trial Court that there was a sudden fight and it is not for the prosecution

to establish there was none. In the present case, the appellant has manifestly failed

to establish that the stabbing occurred in the course of a sudden fight.

41. The manner in which the appellant, along with several others, arrived at the line

rooms armed with a pointed knife, the fact that the deceased and his family were

residing there, the unprovoked nature of the attack, the nature and location of the

fatal injury inflicted on the deceased, and the subsequent conduct of the appellant,

when considered cumulatively, do not persuade this Court to bring the case within

the ambit of Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

CA/HCC/0181/2020

12 | P a g e

42. Thus, the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is devoid of merit and

cannot be sustained. In the circumstances, I find no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
