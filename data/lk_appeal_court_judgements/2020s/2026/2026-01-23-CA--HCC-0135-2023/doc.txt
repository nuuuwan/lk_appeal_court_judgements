Judgement

1. In this matter, the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the appellant”) was

indicted before the High Court of Homagama on a charge of grave sexual abuse, an

offence punishable under section 365B(1)(b) of the Penal Code. Upon the conclusion

of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty of the said charge

and convicted him accordingly.

2. The appellant was sentenced to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment and was further

ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 100,000.00, with a default sentence of three months’ simple

imprisonment. The Court also directed the appellant to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000.00 as

compensation, with a default sentence of one year’s simple imprisonment. Being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred the present

appeal.

3. During the period relevant to the alleged offence, the victim was an Advanced Level

student at Mahinda Rajapaksha College, Homagama. He was keen on practising music

and, with a view to improving the quality of his voice, was directed by one of his music

teachers to a person by the name of Lakmal Kasthurirathna. Upon contacting the said

Lakmal over the telephone, Lakmal provided the victim with the telephone number of

the appellant.

4. Subsequently, the victim made an appointment with the appellant and, on 19.12.2013,

visited the appellant’s residence.

5. At the trial before the High Court, six witnesses testified for the prosecution, and the

appellant made a dock statement. PW1 was the victim. According to his evidence, when

he arrived at the appellant’s house, the appellant’s wife was present and requested him

to wait outside, as the appellant was conducting a music class at the time. After the

class had concluded, the appellant came downstairs and handed the victim an

application form. Upon completing the form, the victim returned it to the appellant

together with a sum of Rs. 1,500.00.

6. Thereafter, the appellant asked the victim to sit on the floor and suggested that he shave

his armpits and groin area, which suggestion was objected to by the victim. At that

point, the appellant is alleged to have suddenly taken out a canister and sprayed a

substance onto the victim’s nose, causing him to feel faint. The appellant then led the

victim to a nearby room, opened the zipper of the victim’s trousers, lowered his

underwear, and performed oral sex on him.

7. The victim further stated that the alleged act continued for approximately two to three

minutes, after which he managed to push the appellant aside and escape. He also

testified that the appellant ejaculated during the said act and thereafter wiped the

victim’s genital area with a piece of cloth.

8. Thereafter, the victim boarded a bus bound for Awissawella and, while on his way,

contacted his mother by telephone, informing her that he was facing a problem, though

he did not disclose the full details of the incident. He further requested his mother to

inform his father. Upon reaching Awissawella, his parents and brother were present,

and he then narrated the entire incident to them.

9. Subsequently, they proceeded to the Awissawella Police Station and were directed to

the Nawagamuwa Police Station, where a complaint was lodged. The police thereafter

referred the victim for a medical examination. At a later stage, the police visited the

appellant’s residence with the victim, inspected the premises, and arrested the appellant.

Following are the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant.

1. Has the prosecution proved the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable

doubt?

2. Does the prosecution case fail on the test of probability?

3. Has the learned High Court Judge not considered the matters favorable to the

appellant and thereby was the appellant deprived of the fair trial?

4. Has the learned trial Judge misdirected himself when analyzing the evidence?

5. Has the learned trial Judge misdirected himself as regards to the evaluation of the

dock statement?

10. Additionally, it was submitted that, in the absence of a proper investigation conducted

by the police, the prosecution could not have given rise to a valid charge. The first four

grounds of appeal are interrelated and, accordingly, I shall consider them together.

11. It is evident that the alleged offence is said to have been committed by the appellant on

the very first day he met the victim. At the time of the alleged incident, the victim was

a 17-year-old male student. The evidence further discloses that there were other

students present upstairs during the relevant time. According to the testimony of the

victim, he was seated on the floor when the appellant allegedly sprayed a substance

onto his face.

12. In his evidence, the victim stated that the appellant used a canister to spray a substance

onto his face, which allegedly caused him to feel weak. However, although the victim

was examined by a doctor on the very same day, no traces or effects of any such

substance were detected. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the police questioned

the appellant in this regard, nor was any such canister or substance recovered from the

appellant’s residence, despite a search having been conducted. The only item produced

by the police was a broom, which had no evidentiary value or corroborative effect in

relation to the prosecution case.

CA/HCC/0135/2023

5 | P a g e

13. The evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer, Dr. Prabhath Abeysingha, does not

indicate the detection of any substance, or even traces thereof, on the victim that could

have caused the alleged weakening effect when sprayed on his face. Dr. Abeysingha

further confirmed that, had the victim informed the doctor who attended to him at the

time of admission that a substance had been sprayed on his face resulting in weakness,

such information ought to have been recorded contemporaneously in the admission

notes. He also stated that, in the ordinary course, hospitals forward relevant specimens

to the Government Analyst; however, in view of the history presented in this case, no

such step had been taken.

14. More importantly, it was the evidence of the victim that the appellant used a broom to

wipe semen that had fallen on the floor after the alleged incident, and when the broom

was shown to him at the trial, he identified it as the very broom allegedly used by the

appellant. If that were so, the police could have easily forwarded the said broom to the

Government Analyst for examination. However, no such step was taken.

15. This omission casts serious doubt on the prosecution narrative and further demonstrates

the failure of the police to conduct a proper and effective investigation. While a

defective investigation per se does not automatically vitiate a prosecution, where such

defects relate to material aspects of the case and give rise to reasonable doubt, the Court

is duty bound to extend the benefit of doubt to the accused.

16. In the present case, the omission to subject the broom alleged to be directly connected

with the commission of the offence to forensic examination not only weakens the

corroborative value of the prosecution evidence but also seriously undermines the

credibility of the prosecution narrative. This lapse clearly demonstrates the failure of

the police to conduct a proper and effective investigation and renders the conviction

unsafe.

17. In the present case, the victim was 17 years of age at the time of the alleged incident.

According to the evidence of PW1, when the appellant suggested that he remove hair

from his armpits and groin area, he objected and informed the appellant that it was

inappropriate to make such a suggestion to a student. PW1 further stated that the alleged

incident occurred on the very first day he met the appellant.

CA/HCC/0135/2023

18. At that stage, the appellant had no knowledge of the victim’s family background,

personal conduct, or disposition. In these circumstances, it appears highly improbable

that the appellant would have made such an inappropriate suggestion to the victim on

their very first meeting. It is also significant to note that, having regard to the victim’s

age and physical capacity, he could have easily left the premises had he in fact been

subjected to any improper approach by the appellant.

19. It is noteworthy that, during cross-examination, when the victim was questioned as to

why he did not resist or raise an alarm at the time the alleged offence was being

committed, he stated that he feared for his life. However, the conduct of the victim

following the alleged incident, as revealed in his examination-in-chief, does not support

the existence of such fear when he left the appellant’s premises. The victim testified as

follows:

ප්‍ර : ඔය වේලාවේ තමුන් කිේවා තමුන් යනවකාට සර් අතු ගානවා දැක්කා කියලා

වන්ද?

20. This inconsistency once again casts serious doubt on the credibility of the victim’s

testimony. The disparity between the explanation offered for his inaction during the

alleged incident and his calm and composed conduct thereafter materially undermines

the reliability of this aspect of the prosecution case.

21. According to the testimony of the victim, he first contacted the husband of a music

teacher who had taught him while he was schooling in Dehiwala, and it was this person

CA/HCC/0135/2023

7 | P a g e

who provided him with the telephone number of Lakmal. Upon contacting Lakmal, the

latter instructed the victim to contact the appellant and provided him with the

appellant’s telephone number. It is noteworthy that, subsequent to the alleged incident,

neither the victim nor his father informed Lakmal of the alleged occurrence. This

omission is a relevant circumstance which the Court is entitled to take into account in

assessing the credibility of the prosecution case, particularly where the testimony of the

victim is otherwise marked by material inconsistencies and improbabilities.

22. Moreover, the victim’s assertion that he felt weak after the appellant allegedly sprayed

a substance onto his face remains wholly unsubstantiated by medical evidence, thereby

further undermining the credibility of this aspect of the prosecution case.

23. Where the evidence of the victim is riddled with improbabilities and material

inconsistencies, it is unsafe to found a conviction thereon. The learned trial Judge has

manifestly failed to give due consideration to the aforesaid improbabilities apparent in

the testimony of the victim, which, in my view, amounts to a serious misdirection

directly affecting the findings of the learned Judge.

24. According to the victim, he was introduced to the appellant by one Lakmal

Kasthurirathne. In his dock statement, the appellant stated that the said Lakmal was not

on good terms with him due to a dispute relating to the copyright of a song. If that were

so, it raises a legitimate question as to what prompted Lakmal to introduce the victim

to the appellant. It also gives rise to the possibility that Lakmal may have had a motive

to place the appellant in difficulty.

25. Having regard to the sequence of events in the present case, the dock statement of the

appellant cannot be disregarded in its entirety, particularly in a situation where the

prosecution version itself is marred by material improbabilities.

26. Although the learned trial Judge has referred to the dock statement of the appellant, it

has not been considered in its proper perspective. In my view, the dock statement ought

to have been evaluated in the context of the material improbabilities apparent in the

prosecution case, and the failure to do so has resulted in a misdirection affecting the

findings of the learned trial Judge.

CA/HCC/0135/2023

27. It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as evidence. It has also been

laid down that if the unsworn statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution

case or if it is believed, then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 Sri L.R.107

28. If the Accused’s evidence creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, the

Accused is entitled to be acquitted. In Queen Vs. Kularatne 71 NLR 529, the Supreme

Court observed the following rules with regard to a dock statement of an Accused:

1. If the dock statement of the Accused is believed it must be acted upon.

2. If the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed.

29. Similar view was expressed in Gunasiri and two others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka

[2009] 1 SRI. L.R.39 as follows:

(1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

(2) If the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the

defence must succeed.

30. When the material improbabilities apparent in the testimony of the victim are

considered in conjunction with the dock statement of the appellant, it cannot reasonably

be held that the prosecution has established its case beyond reasonable doubt. For the

aforesaid reasons, it is unsafe to allow the conviction to stand.

31. Had the learned trial Judge properly taken into account the aforesaid infirmities

apparent in the testimony of the victim, particularly the material improbabilities in the

prosecution version, it would not have been possible to arrive at a conclusion of guilt

against the appellant.
