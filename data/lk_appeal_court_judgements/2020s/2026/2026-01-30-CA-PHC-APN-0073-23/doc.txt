JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam,J.

The Accused-Petitioner (Hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) is the

Accused named in the High Court cases mentioned in the Caption of

the Application. In all the cases mentioned above, the Hon. Attorney

General filed three charges under the Public Property Act No. 12 of

1982 as amended. The Petitioner had pleaded guilty to the charges at

very outset. Hence, he was sentenced as follows:

CA(PHC)APN / 73-2023

3 | P a g e

HC/102/2017

18 months concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine

of Rs.237,000/- on 1st count, 195,000/- for the 2nd count and

180,000/- for the 3rd count. In default, two years rigorous

imprisonment was imposed on each count.

HC/103/2017

2 years concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine of

Rs.164,000/- on 1st count, a fine of Rs. 186,000/- for the 2nd count and

a fine of Rs. 119,700/- for the 3rd count. In default, 01-year rigorous

imprisonment was imposed on each count.

HC/104/2017

07 years concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine of

Rs.93,000/- on the 1st count, a fine of Rs. 180,000/- for the 2nd count

and a fine of Rs. 121,000/- for the 3rd count.

HC/105/2017

02 years concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine of

Rs.127,700/- on 1st count, a fine of Rs. 185,000/- for the 2nd count and

a fine of Rs. 129,000/- for the 3rd count. In default, two years rigorous

imprisonment was imposed on each count.

HC/106/2017

10 years concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine of

Rs.92,700/- on 1st count, a fine of Rs. 94,800/- for the 2nd count and a

fine of Rs. 96,000/- for the 3rd count. In default, 01-year rigorous

imprisonment was imposed on each count.

HC/107/2017

10 years concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine of

Rs.120,000/- on 1st count, a fine of Rs. 147,000/- for the 2nd count and

CA(PHC)APN / 73-2023

4 | P a g e

a fine of Rs. 128,000/- for the 3rd count. In default, two years rigorous

imprisonment was imposed on each count.

HC/109/2017

18 months concurrent rigorous imprisonment on each count with a fine

of Rs.28,500/- on 1st count, a fine of Rs. 60,000/- for the 2nd count and

a fine of Rs. 93,000/- for the 3rd count.

HC/124/2017

03 years rigorous imprisonment imposed on count one with a fine of

Rs.195,000/-. In default, two years rigorous imprisonment was

imposed.

In three more cases too, the Petitioner had pleaded guilty and was

sentenced accordingly. Against the said three cases, three Revision

Applications made under case Nos. CPA/89/2021, CPA/90/2021 and

CPA/281/2018 had been filed earlier and matters had been already

adjudicated by this court.

Now the learned President’s Counsel, appearing on behalf of the

Petitioner makes an application that, as the aggregated sentence

imposed on all the cases mentioned above is 37 years, he moves this

court to consider ordering that the sentences imposed on all the cases

run concurrently, where each would be operative from the date of the

respective conviction. In which event, the Petitioner would serve a term

of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in all.

The learned President’s Counsel submitted that the Petitioner is

presently 60 years old and has a wife and five children. The Petitioner’s

wife is infirmed and is 56 years of age whilst his children are aged

37,36,32,30 and 24 respectively. Hence, the learned President’s

Counsel moves this court to consider the above-mentioned family issue

as an exceptional circumstance which warrants the exercise of the

revisionary jurisdiction.

In the High Court cases mentioned above, the learned High Court

Judge, applying Section 16 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979 (Hereinafter referred to as the CPC), very correctly sentenced

the Petitioner considering the existing circumstances of each case.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge cannot be faulted.

In consideration of the application made in this revision application, it

is important to discuss Section 300 of CPC. The section sates:

When a person actually undergoing imprisonment is sentenced to

imprisonment such imprisonment shall commence at the

expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been previously

sentenced.

In Weerawarnakula v The Republic of Sri Lanka [2002] 3 SLR 2013

His Lordship Amaratunga, J. considering the Sri Lankan law and

Indian pertaining to this issue held that:

Section 300 is applicable to a different situation than that

contemplated by section 16 of the Code. It applies to a situation

where a person actually undergoing imprisonment is in some other

case again sentenced to imprisonment. According to the section the

latter imprisonment shall commence to operate at the expiration of

the imprisonment to which he has been previously sentenced. This

is an exception to the general rule that a sentence begins to operate

from the time it is pronounced. Section 300 is couched in imperative

terms and in view of the wording of the section no court has the

power or discretion to order that a sentence of imprisonment

ordered by it shall run concurrently with a sentence of

imprisonment ordered in a previous case which the accused is

serving when he is sentenced in the 2nd case. In Godagama v.

Mathes 2 Wood Renton, J. stressing the imperative nature of

section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 (which was

identical with present section 300 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act) said that "[I] t is not competent for a Magistrate to

CA(PHC)APN / 73-2023

6 | P a g e

order that a sentence passed on an offender who is already

sentenced for another offence shall run concurrently with the

previous sentence."

The Indian counterpart of section 300 was section 397 of the

Indian Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 and presently it is section

427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 2 of 1974. The

present Indian section is similar to section 397 of the earlier Code.

Under section 397 no discretion was available to court to make the

later sentence of imprisonment concurrent with a previous sentence

of imprisonment ordered in an earlier case. Emperor v. Bhikki and

Others 3. By an amendment to the Indian Criminal Procedure Code

in 1923 the words "unless the court directs that the subsequent

sentence shall run concurrently with the previous sentence" were

added to section 397 and in view of this the courts now have a

discretion to order that a subsequent sentence of imprisonment

shall run concurrently with a previous sentence of imprisonment.

But there are no similar words in section 300 of our law.

Even if there is no discretion available to court, if the phrase

"actually undergoing imprisonment" is interpreted in the way

suggested by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant it is

possible to argue that the learned High Court Judge had the power

to order the sentences of imprisonment ordered in case No. 998/93

to run concurrently with the sentence of imprisonment ordered in

case No. 997/93. According to the learned counsel's argument a

person can be said to be actually undergoing imprisonment only

when he is taken to prison and accepted and admitted as an

inmate of the prison. This argument is contrary to the general

principle that a sentence takes effect from the time it is

pronounced. In criminal courts we every day see this general

principle given effect to.

CA(PHC)APN / 73-2023

7 | P a g e

In the case of Bandage Sumindra Jayanthi Vs. Attorney General

(2015) 1 SLR 20, it was held that:

“As Section 16 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act stands, it

enacts both a rule and an exception. The rule is that if there are

more than one count in one indictment, the separate sentences

ordered on each count shall run consecutively. But the exception to

the rule as found in the said section is that if the High Court judge

chooses to do so, she/he is empowered to order the separate

sentences to run concurrently, in fact Section 16 (1) is a neutral

provision which applies to both trials in the High Court and the

Magistrate’s Court.

Thus Section 16 of the Code is limited in scope to multiple counts in

one trial and the power of ordering concurrent sentences does not

extend to other indictments against the same accused as they

would constitute separate and distinct trials.

Therefore, Section 300 of the Code would not permit the imposition

of concurrent sentences for the different indictments.”

Furthermore, it is desirable to emphasise that this being an application

for revision, it is the duty of the Petitioner to establish the existence of

exceptional circumstances which shock the conscience of Court.

In Caderamanpulle v Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd (2001) 3 SLR 112, it

was held that:

“The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for

the exercise of the powers of revision; and absence of exceptional

circumstances in any given situation results in refusal of

remedies.”

However, in the present application, the Petitioner has failed to plead

any such exceptional circumstances.

CA(PHC)APN / 73-2023

8 | P a g e

Considering the circumstances of the cases referred to above and where

the law stands as at today; this Court is not inclined to entertain the

request made by the learned President’s Counsel directing the

sentences imposed in case numbers referred in the revision application

to run concurrently with each other. Hence, this application is

dismissed. No cost ordered.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo for information.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

R. P. Hettiarachchi, J.

I agree.
