However, the said Vasanthapragash is alleged to have informed the officers that the said land is not state land but private land. Further, it was submitted that the said Vasanthapragash had proceeded with clearing the land, which resulted in the 1st Respondent serving a quit notice and subsequently filing action in the Magistrate\u2019s Court under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act against the said Vasanthapragash. It was the contention of the Petitioners that the 1st Respondent had disputed the Petitioners\u2019 title and had come to the conclusion that the corpus is state land and also that it is part of a dense forest.

As per the submissions, it appears that the Petitioners\u2019 title is derived from a Deed of Gift bearing No. 6227, which does not recite the title of the donor but states that the Deed of Gift is executed in favour of the donor's daughter-in-law. Among the lands gifted in the Schedule to the deed, an undivided 1/3rd share of the corpus containing 450 Acres is given to the donee and the said deed is executed on 09.01.1946. This Court observes that the next deed the Petitioners rely on to demonstrate the title is executed on 01.09.2014 and the Schedule bears the corpus in the extent of an undivided 1/3rd share of the corpus in the extent of 450 Acres. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioners did not disclose to this Court as to whether the predecessor to the Petitioners\u2019 title has declared the said land under the Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972 as amended (herein referred to as \u2018LRC Law\u2019) coming into operation and whether the title devolved as 1/3rd of the total extent was subject to the LRC Law. Hence, whether the said land was vested with the LRC was not disclosed by the Petitioners.",
