Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

1] This dispute involves a property in Kurunegala originally owned by the

Defendant-Petitioner (Biyanwilage Padmini Amerasekera). The Plaintiff-

Respondent (Badurali Arachchige Ariyaratne) claims ownership via Deed of

Transfer No. 83 dated 07/09/2017, attested by Dinesh Manikpura, Notary

Public, asserting it was an outright sale. However, the Defendant contends that

this deed was never intended as a sale but was actually executed as security for

a loan of Rs. 3,500,000 obtained to help her son find work abroad. She contends

that because the matter was pending before the Debt Conciliation Board, the

original District Court action should not have been maintained. This goes on to

mean that Before the District Court case began, the matter was referred to the

Debt Conciliation Board; the Defendant argues that because this application

was pending, the Plaintiff was legally barred from maintaining the District Court

action under section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance.

2] Now, the Petitioner prays for the following reliefs;

a. Issue Notice of this application of Restitutio In Integrum on the Plaintiff

Respondent

b. Set aside the Settlement and Order dated 2021.02.10 entered in this action

and to fix this action again for trial

c. For Judgement by Your Lordships Court to allow the Defendant Petitioner to

contest this action

Page 4 of 9

d. Stay the operation of the settlement entered in D.C. Kurunegala Case No.

8747/L, on 2021.02.10 until this application is finally determined by Your

Lordships Court

e. For costs

f. For such other further relief as Your Lordships shall seem

3] A critical turning point occurred on 10/02/2021, when a settlement was

entered in open court requiring the Defendant to pay Rs. 5,500,000 to the

Plaintiff to retain the land. The Defendant failed to pay and was subsequently

evicted by a writ of execution in July 2022. She now seeks to overturn this

settlement, alleging it was signed under extreme duress. Specifically, she claims

that the Plaintiff’s son-in-law threatened to kill her two grandsons if she did not

agree to the settlement, and that she was further prevented from seeking legal

remedy at the time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, she asserts

that the terms of the settlement and the consequences of a "writ of execution"

were never fully explained to her by the court or her counsel. Her subsequent

attempts to appeal or revise the decision through the High Court were dismissed,

often due to her ill health and inability to provide instructions to her lawyers.

She is now appealing to the higher court’s jurisdiction, arguing that the land is

worth over Rs. 10,000,000 (100 Lakhs) and that the settlement was a grave

injustice that must be overturned.

4] It is seen that the Petitioner has sought redress from the Civil Appellate High

Court to vacate the said settlement. However, it was refused by the order dated

30/10/2023 of HCCA/LA/Kuru Application 23/2023/LA.

5] To the said refusal, the Petitioner has filed an application for leave to appeal

to the Supreme Court. The Petitioner argued that the High Court erred by

dismissing her case for "non-prosecution" when her lawyer’s requests for

postponements due to her ill health were rejected. She asked the Supreme Court

to review whether the initial settlement is void due to fraud and malice, and

Page 5 of 9

whether the legal proceedings were fundamentally flawed because of the

concurrent proceedings before the Debt Conciliation Board. When the

application was supported in the Supreme Court, by order dated 15/07/2025

of S.C.(HC) CA.LA No. 503/2023, the leave was refused and petition was

dismissed without costs.

6] Thereafter, within two weeks of the above dismissal, the Petitioner filed this

application on 30/07/2025.

7] In the objections, the Respondent highlights that the Petitioner previously

challenged this same settlement in the Civil Appellate High Court and the

Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, both of which dismissed her claims; the matter is

now Res Judicata (already judged), and the Court of Appeal lacks the jurisdiction

to hear the case again.

8] The Respondent further says that the Petitioner has acted in bad faith, noting

she failed to honour the original settlement, leading to writ executions and even

contempt of court proceedings. The objections state that the application lacks

merit, fails to show "exceptional circumstances," and is an abuse of the court

process. The Respondent pleads for dismissal of this application.

9] I now consider the merits of this application. According to the journal entry

No.13 dated 10/02/2021, it is seen that the terms were fully explained to the

Petitioner, who signed the case record in the presence of the judge. It says;

"දෙපාර් ශවය අතර සමාොන සම්පුර් න සහ අවසන් සමථයක් ඇති බව ෙන්වා ද ාන්දේසි වාර් ථා

රයි.

අෙ දින වීවත අධි රණදේදී එළබී සමථ ද ාන්දේසි කියවා දේරුම්ප ර දීදමන් පසුව එය දේරුම්ප

දෙන නඩු වාරථාව අේසන් තැබීම සඳහා නියම රමි. (ස/බ ) එකී සමථය ප්‍ර ාර සමථ තීන්ු

ප්‍ර ාශයක් ඇතුලේ රන්න."

Page 6 of 9

10] It is seen that the Petitioner was represented by Mr. N. Samaraweera,

Attorney at Law. Thus, I hold that her claim of "duress" is legally unfounded and

barred by the principle of estoppel.

11] It seems to me that the Petitioner has exhausted all legal avenues, as this

settlement was previously challenged in the Civil Appellate High Court and the

Supreme Court.

12] On the other hand, the core of the argument is that at the time the civil

action was initiated on 13/12/2018, an application regarding the same

debt/property was already pending before the Debt Conciliation Board (filed on

04/10/2018), which should have legally barred the court from proceeding.

13] It is clear that Section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance, which explicitly

states that no civil court shall entertain any action in respect of a matter pending

before the Board. It says;

“No civil court shall entertain-

(a) any action in respect of-

(i) any matter pending before the Board; or

(ii) the validity of any procedure before the Board or the

legality of any settlement;

(b) any application to execute a decree, the execution of which is

suspended under section 55.”

14] With regard to this question in Baby v. Banda and Others [1999] 3 Sri

L.R.419, His Lordship Kulatilleka, J. concluded as follows;

“As regards section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance there is no such

condition precedent attached to it and there is an absolute bar to

jurisdiction. It reads as follows: "No Civil court shall entertain any action

in respect of any matter pending before the Board."

Page 7 of 9

Hence, we are of the considered view the want of jurisdiction is

patent and objection to jurisdiction may be taken up at any time.

Vide the decision in Fernando v. Fernando 74 NLR 57).

In that case Samerawickrema, J. further observed: "In such a case it is,

in fact, the duty of court itself ex mere motu to raise the point even

if the parties fail to do so.” [Emphasis is added]

15] Further, in Hilda Perera v. Lawrence Perera 67 NLR 186, His Lordship

Tambiah J held that,

“the date from which an application for relief under the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance is regarded as pending before the Board is the date when the

application is received by the Board and not the date when it is entertained

by the Board under Section 19 of the Ordinance.”

His Lordship further held;

“The Debt Conciliation Ordinance was enacted to provide for the

establishment of a debt conciliation Board and other matters connected with

the purposes for which it was established. It was clearly a piece of

legislation intended to give relief to debtors. The language of Section 56 of

the Ordinance is plain. It states that “no civil court shall entertain any action

in respect of any matter pending before the Board.” By the word “matter”,

is meant the particulars in the application. In my view, the moment the

application is received by the Board, the matters stated in the application

are pending before the Board. Thereafter, it is for the Board to decide as to

whether they wish to entertain the application or not.”

16] Thus, it is clear, there is a clear bar to entertain the original application by

the District Judge as prevented by section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Board

Ordinance, but our hands are tight that we could not go above the recent

judgement of Supreme Court, W.T.S. Nilantha Fernando vs P.M.S. Nilanthi

Page 8 of 9

Perera, SC/APPEAL/65/2025, Decided on: 10.10.2025. In that His Lordship

Samayawardhena, J. clearly ousted the jurisdiction of this court, held as follows;

“Hence, I hold that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction, whether by way

of final appeal, revision, or restitutio in integrum, to review the judgments

or orders of the Provincial High Court, whether in the exercise of its appellate

jurisdiction under Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006,

or in the exercise of its original jurisdiction under Act No. 10 of 1996. Such

jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.”

17] I do admit that the District Court lacks the jurisdiction; thus, the

proceedings are ab initio void. However, this point should have been agitated

before the competent courts. It is seen that the Petitioner (As the Defendant)

filed the answer dated 05/11/2019 and in paragraph 02 as a preliminary

objection, the jurisdictional matter was raised. It is unclear why the Defendant

agreed to a settlement despite a clear-cut case/objection. However, this court

lacks jurisdiction since the High Court has concurrent jurisdiction; if we revise

or set aside the Civil Appeal High Court Judgement, it will amount to quashing

its own order/judgment, as both courts have concurrent jurisdiction. On the

other hand, leave was refused by the Supreme Court; it is unclear whether a

jurisdictional matter was agitated before the Supreme Court. However, if the

lack of jurisdiction is patent, the result renders all proceedings invalid. Thus, it

is a matter for the competent court to decide whether all orders made by the

court are valid and have legal force, not for this court.

18] If we allow this application, it will have a direct impact on the Supreme Court

decision, agitate on same facts. I think, if the Supreme Court held against the

Petitioner, there can be no room for any court. It is my considered view that

there should be an end to litigation once you have exhausted all avenues; once

you have achieved the last triumph, you cannot agitate the jurisdiction of this

court under restitution in integrum.

19] For the aforesaid reasons, we dismissed the application for restitution-in-

integrum, with costs.
