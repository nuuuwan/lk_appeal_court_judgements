Introduction

On or about 31.12.2014, a motor vehicle (truck) bearing registration No. 227-4183, of which the Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the“Appellant”) was the registered owner, was seized, following the arrest of thedriver for having transported Pathuru Mara timber worth Rs. 7085.71 without apermit, in contravention of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Ordinance,as amended (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Forest Ordinance”). Theaccused driver of the vehicle had been fined Rs. 10,000/- upon him pleadingguilty to the charge, and the timber concerned had been ordered to beconfiscated. As the Appellant had not been an accused in the proceedings but athird-party owner, an inquiry had been conducted by the learned Magistrateunder the proviso to Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance to determine herentitlement to relief. Upon the conclusion of that inquiry, confiscation of thevehicle had been directed by order dated 06.11.2015.

Being dissatisfied with the learned Magistrate’s order, the Appellant had invokedthe revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of the Central Province holden atKandy, challenging the legality of the said order. Upon consideration, thelearned High Court Judge, by order dated 30.06.2016, had dismissed therevision application, holding that no grounds had been disclosed warrantinginterference with the Magistrate’s determination.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Judge of the High Court, theAppellant has preferred this instant appeal to this court challenging the learnedMagistrate’s order dated 06.11.2015, and the order of the honorable Judge ofthe High Court dated 30.06.2016.

4

The Appellant has challenged the impugned orders primarily on the followinggrounds;

1. The confiscation proceedings were legally flawed on the grounds that

correct provisions of the Forest Conservation Ordinance were not properlyapplied, section 40(1) was said to be repealed or inoperative, and nospecific charge relating to confiscation had been framed.

2. The inquiry into the Appellant’s claim as a third-party owner was unfair

and incomplete, as the Appellant’s lack of knowledge of the offence andotherrelevantmitigatingfactors,includingtheproportionalityofconfiscation, were not properly considered.

Issues for Determination

The appeal raises three principal issues:

1. Whether alleged defects in the charge sheet or references to earlier

amendments invalidate the confiscation proceedings.

2. Whether the Petitioner–Appellant satisfied the statutory burden imposed

by the proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance.

3. Whether the courts below erred in law so as to warrant appellate

interference.

Section 40 after Forest (Amendment) Act, No. 65 of 2009

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, as substituted by Act No. 65 of 2009,represents a deliberate legislative departure from earlier court-moderatedconfiscation, exemplified by cases such as Manawadu v. Attorney-General1

and similar pre-2009 authorities. The section now establishes:

That forfeiture follows as a legal consequence of a conviction for a forestoffence; and

1 (1987) 2 SLR 30

5

A statutory escape, available only if the owner proves that all precautionswere taken to prevent the offence.

Lack of knowledge has been referred to by some post 2009 judgements, but notas an independent statutory defence to confiscation. Lack of knowledge istreated as supporting evidence relevant to whether precautions were taken, notas a substitute for them.

Further, by introducing sections 40A and 40B, Parliament expressly excludedthe application of Sections 306 and 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,thereby removing general property-return mechanisms from the confiscationprocess.

Alleged Defects in the Charge Sheet

The Petitioner–Appellant contended that since the charge sheet referred only toearlier amendments and failed to expressly cite Act No. 65 of 2009, suchomission vitiated the conviction of the Accused (the driver of the vehicle), andthat the consequential order for confiscation of the vehicle is thereforeunsustainable in law.

Although the confiscation inquiry under section 40 is consequential uponconviction, the accused had pleaded guilty to an offence under the ForestConservation Ordinance. As such, the conviction has attained finality and athird-party claimant appearing under the proviso to section 40 cannot mount acollateral attack on the charge or the conviction and cannot re-litigate thecriminal charge. To permit such a course would undermine finality in criminalproceedings and frustrate the statutory confiscation regime.

Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Mawathagama6, where it was held that the

inquiry under Section 40 is confined to the statutory conditions governingrelease of the vehicle and does not reopen the validity of the conviction.

The Statutory Burden: “All Precautions”

The central question is whether the Petitioner–Appellant discharged the burdenimposed by the proviso to section 40(1).

The burden is one of proof and evidence. It is not enough for an owner to merelyassert a lack of knowledge. The statute requires proof, on a balance ofprobabilities, that effective and reasonable precautions were taken.

The evidence placed before the Magistrate revealed no system of supervision,control, or verification regarding the use of the vehicle. No corroborative materialwas tendered. The learned Magistrate was therefore entitled to conclude thatthe statutory threshold had not been met.

It has been consistently held by the Court of Appeal that, in an inquiry underSection 40 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance, mere verbal instructions,passive ownership, or bare assertions of innocence do not satisfy the statutoryrequirement.Theprovisodemandsproofofeffectiveandaffirmativeprecautionary measures, established on a balance of probabilities, failing whichconfiscation must follow. This principle was reiterated in H. G. Sujith Priyantha

v. Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Poddala7, where it was emphasized that

Proportionality

Reliance has been placed on by the Appellant on Atapattu Mudiyanselage

Sadi Banda v. Officer-in-Charge, Norton Bridge8 to argue that confiscation

was disproportionate. However, this authority does not assist the Petitioner–Appellant. Sadi Banda was decided on a clear factual finding that the owner hadestablished a lack of knowledge and reasonable precautions. Proportionalitywas considered after the statutory burden had been discharged. This fact hasbeen clearly emphasized in Hewa Pathirana Jayawickrama v. Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Mawathagama and others9

In the present case, the threshold requirement under Section 40 was never met.Proportionality cannot be invoked to override an express legislative commandwhere the statutory preconditions for relief have failed.

Scope of Appellate Interference

It is well settled that this Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, willnot interfere with findings of fact and law made by the learned Magistrate andaffirmed by the High Court, save where such findings are shown to be vitiatedby illegality, material misdirection, procedural impropriety, or a manifest failureof justice. Appellate intervention is therefore warranted only where a clear erroraffecting the legality or integrity of the decision-making process is established.In the present case, no such illegality, misdirection, or failure of justice has beendemonstrated so as to justify interference by this Court.

Conclusion

This appeal discloses no basis for disturbing the confiscation ordered undersection 40 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance. The Appellant failed todischarge the burden imposed by law, and the confiscation reflects thelegislative policy of strict deterrence against forest offences.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds no basis to interfere with theimpugned orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court.Accordingly, the order of confiscation made by the learned Magistrate andaffirmed by the Provincial High Court is confirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.We make no order as to costs.
