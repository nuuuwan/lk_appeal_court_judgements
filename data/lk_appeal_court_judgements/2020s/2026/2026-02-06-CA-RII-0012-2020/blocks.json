    "text": "Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned District Judge delivered the judgment on 15-10-2002, allowing the partition of the land. The 12th defendant was not a party to the original plaint, and the plaintiff has not shown any rights in favour of such a person. After the judgment was entered, the 12A defendant filed an application in the District Court stating that she was unable to be present on the date of trial because she had mistakenly believed the trial was scheduled for15-11-2002. However, the trial was held on 15-10-2002. Accordingly, she sought to set aside the judgment and to have the case fixed for trial de novo. Application of the 12A defendant was fixed for inquiry on 07-06-2005. However, on that date, the 12A defendant was absent and unrepresented. The Learned District Judge dismissed the application of the 12A defendant on 07-06-2005. Thereafter, 12A defendant filed another similar application dated 30-01-2008. That application was fixed for inquiry on 19-02-2009. On that date, the 12A defendant was absent and had informed the court that she was unwell. Accordingly, the Inquiry was postponed to another date. On 19-11-2009, which was the 3rd date given for the inquiry the court was informed that the 12A defendant had died. Thereafter, the present 12AA defendant was substituted as the legal representative of the 12th defendant. The 12AA defendant-petitioner was present in court on 02-08-2017. However, the 12AA defendant did not proceed with the application made by the 12A defendant. Final decree was entered on 22-11-2017. 12AA defendant-petitioner in this application seeks the same relief he previously sought in the District Court without pursuing the application made by the 12th defendant. The 12AA defendant is only a legal representative of the deceased 12th defendant. The 12th, 12A, and 12AA defendants have not acted diligently in the District Court.",
