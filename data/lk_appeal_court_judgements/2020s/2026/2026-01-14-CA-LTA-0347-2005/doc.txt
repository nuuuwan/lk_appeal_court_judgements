K. M. S. DISSANAYAKE, J.

This is an appeal with leave to appeal being granted by this Court on 25.03.2011

against an order of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha dated

29.08.2025 (P8), made by him in respect of three applications made to it by the

11th, 16th and 17th Defendant-Petitioners-Petitioners (hereinafter called and

referred to as ‘the 11th, 16th and 17th Defendants) and the 19th Defendant-

Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the 19th Defendant)

and the 24th and 25th Defendant-Petitioners-Petitioners (hereinafter called and

referred to as ‘the 24th and 25th Defendants’) under and in terms of section 48(4)

of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 (as amended) (hereinafter called and referred

to as ‘the Act’) in a partition action bearing No. 31879/P instituted by the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the

Plaintiff’) in the District Court of Gampaha seeking partition of the land

morefully, described in the schedule to the plaint filed in Court in terms of the

chain of title recited therein by way of a pedigree appended thereto as per the

scheme of share distribution set out therein among the Plaintiff and the 1st to

21st Defendants named in the caption to the plaint with 36/1920 share being

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 11 of 22

left unallotted, whereby, the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha had

rejected all three applications so made to it with costs. It is this order that the

11th, 16th,17th, 19th, 24th and 25th Defendants now, seeks to impugn before us in

this joint appeal on the grounds of appeal urged by them in paragraph 17(a) to

(e) of the petition of appeal among any other grounds of appeal that may be urged

by learned Counsel at the hearing of the instant appeal and they may be re-

produced verbatim the same as follows;

“a. The said order is contrary to Law and the facts of this case;

b. The learned District judge has correctly accepted the evidence of the

11th Defendant that the summons could not have been served on him as

he was away from Sri Lanka at that time and that there is no proof of

summons been served on the 16th and 17th Defendants. Despite that

acceptance, the learned judge had concluded that there had been

Defendants to this action who were siblings of 11,16 and 17 Defendants,

they should have been aware of this pending action and therefore they

could have participate at the action to claim for their rights to the corpus.

On that basis, the application of the 11,16,17 Defendants under section

48(4) had been disallowed.

The learned judge has failed to consider that serving of summons is

mandatory and therefore, non serving of summons to a party to a partition

action is a sufficient ground which warrants an application under 48(4)

and therefore erroneously had disallowed the said application;

c. The learned judge has erroneously decided that the 19th Defendant too

had claimed before the surveyor and therefore ought to have known about

the action;

d. The learned judge has erroneously concluded that the 24th and 25th

Defendants who had been claimants before the Surveyor ought to have

known about this action and contested it. However the learned judge has

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 12 of 22

failed to consider that it's a mandatory requirement to sent notices to such

disclosed parties by registered post under section 20 of the Partition Law.

Further it is to be observed that despite the issuance of notices as aforesaid

and in the absence of any minute to say such notices have been tendered

by Plaintiff or have been issued by Court, the said 24, 25 Defendants have

been added as parties to this action in their absence and they being un-

represented.

e. It is to be observed that from a very early point of time of this action, the

8th Defendant had been deceased and no steps what so ever had been

taken by the Plaintiff to effect substitution. The trial had been concluded

and the judgment too had been entered when the 8th Defendant was

deceased and no person had been substituted in his room until and after

the judgment is delivered. Even after the final Plan is prepared, the

substitution has been affected for deceased 8th Defendant on 24.1.2000,

subsequent to an application by the 11th Defendant himself. In the said

circumstances, the judgment delivered have been delivered against a

defendant who is deceased and not been properly substituted, and

therefore in null and void.”

When this matter came on before us on 25.07.2025 for judgement of this appeal,

it was observed by Court that notices had not been served on some of the parties

to the instant appeal and therefore, the Appellant was directed to furnish

forthwith to Court the requisite notices to be issued on those parties under

registered cover which had been the cause for delay in delivering the judgement

of this appeal on the day originally fixed for the same.

The pivotal basis for the respective applications made to Court under and in

terms of section 48(4) of the Act by the 11th, 16th and 17th Defendants as well as

the 19th Defendant being non-service of the summons on each of them of the

said partition action and in consequence, the right, title, or interest of them to

or in the land sought to be partitioned which formed the subject matter of the

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 13 of 22

interlocutory decree entered by Court in the said partition action had been

extinguished or they had been otherwise, prejudiced by the interlocutory decree

entered by Court.

On the other hand, the basis for the application made to Court by the 24th and

25th Defendants under and in terms of section 48(4) of the Act was that each of

them being made parties to the partition action without them being given notice

of the partition action as being claimant before the Surveyor at the preliminary

survey as required by section 20(1)(a) of the Act and in consequence, the right,

title, or interest of them to or in the land sought to be partitioned which formed

the subject matter of the interlocutory decree entered by Court in the said

partition action had been extinguished or they had been otherwise, prejudiced

by the interlocutory decree entered by Court.

However, it is to be observed that, the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha, had having correctly, come to a definite finding on the evidence

adduced by the 11th Defendant at the inquiry into the said applications that

summons had not been served on the 11th, 16th and 17th Defendants,

nevertheless, proceeded to dismiss the application made to Court by them by

holding that despite the fact that summons had not been served on each of them,

they ought to have been aware of the partition action by reason of the fact that

some of the parties to the partition action being siblings and thus, they could

have been able to establish their entitlement to the land sought to be partitioned

had they really, so endeavoured. It is the legality and or the proprietary of these

findings of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha which led him to

have dismissed the application so preferred to Court by the 11th, 16th and 17th

Defendants, the learned President’s Counsel now, seeks to canvas before us in

the instant appeal

Hence, the pertinent question that would arise for our consideration in this

appeal is whether; these findings can sustain in law as contended by the learned

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 14 of 22

President’s Counsel for the 11th, 16th, 17th, 19th, 24th and 25th Defendants at the

hearing before us.

It may now, be examined.

The Plaintiff had instituted the said partition action in the District Court of

Gampaha seeking partition of the land morefully, described in the schedule to

the plaint filed in Court in terms of the chain of title recited therein by way of a

pedigree appended thereto as per the scheme of share distribution set out therein

between the Plaintiff and the 1st to 21st Defendants named in the caption to the

plaint with 36/1920 share being left unallotted, and the learned District Judge

of Gampaha had entered an interlocutory decree in terms of the judgement

delivered by him thereby allotting shares to the Plaintiff and the 1st to 21st

Defendants with certain amount of shares being left unallotted and the scheme

of final partition too, had also been submitted to the Court by the Court

Commissioner in terms of the commission issued to him by Court. It was at this

stage that those three applications had been made to Court by the said

Defendants.

The instant partition action is governed by the provisions of the Act. In terms of

section 13(1) of the Act, the Court shall order summons to be issued on the

Defendants thereto and section 14 thereof provides that the provisions of the

Civil Procedure Code relating to the service of summons shall apply to the service

of summons in a partition action. Section 19(1) of the Act provides that, on or

before the date specified in the summons issued in a partition action or on or

before such later date as the Court may fix for the purpose, any Defendant in

the action may file or cause to be filed in Court a statement of claim setting out

the nature and extend of his right, share or interest to or in the land to which

the action relates and shall, if he disputes any averment in the plaint relating to

the devolution of title, file or caused to be filed in Court together with his

statement of claim a pedigree showing the devolution of title.

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 15 of 22

A careful analysis of sections 13(1), 14 and 19(1) of the Act makes it abundantly,

clear that the requirement that the defendant should have notice of the action

either by personal service or substituted service of summons is a condition

precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction against the defendant in a partition

action like in any other civil action for; failure to serve summons is a failure

which goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the

action against the defendant and that it is only by service of summons on the

defendant that the Court gets jurisdiction over the defendant and that if a

defendant is not served with summons or otherwise notified of the proceedings

against him, the judgment entered against him in those circumstances is a

nullity.

It was emphatically, laid down by Court in Ittepana v. Hemawathie 1981[1]

SLR 476 that,

“The principles of natural justice are the basis of our laws of procedure.

The requirement that the defendant should have notice of the action either

by personal service or substituted service of summons is a condition

precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction against the defendant.

'Jurisdiction' may be defined to be the power of a court to hear and

determine a cause, to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power in relation

to it. When the jurisdiction of a Court is challenged the Court is competent

to determine the question of jurisdiction. An inquiry whether the Court

has jurisdiction in a particular case is not an exercise of jurisdiction over

the case itself. It is really an investigation as to whether the conditions of

cognizance are satisfied. Therefore, a Court is always clothed with

jurisdiction to see whether it has jurisdiction to try the cause submitted

to it. Failure to serve summons is a failure which goes to the root of the

jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the action against the

defendant. It is only by service of summons on the defendant that the

Court gets jurisdiction over the defendant. If a defendant is not served with

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 16 of 22

summons or otherwise notified of the proceedings against him, the

judgment entered against him in those circumstances is a nullity. The

proceedings being void, the person affected by them can apply to have

them set aside ex debito justitiae in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction

of the court which is saved by S. 839 of the Civil Procedure Code. Hence

the District Judge acted within his jurisdiction in inquiring into the

question of non-service of summons.”

The Act in its section 48(4)(a)(i) provides a special remedy for a party to a partition

action, whose right, title or interest in and over the land sought to be partitioned

had been extinguished or such party had been otherwise, prejudiced by the

interlocutory decree in consequence of him being not served with summons,

thereby conferring statutory recognition upon the well-established requirement

that the defendant should have notice of the action either by personal service or

substituted service of summons, is a condition precedent to the assumption of

jurisdiction against the defendant wherein it inter-alia, enacts that whenever a

party to a partition action has not been served with summons, and in

consequence thereof the right, title or interest of such party to or in the land

which forms the subject-matter of the interlocutory decree entered in such action

has been extinguished or such party has been otherwise prejudiced by the

interlocutory decree, such party may, on or before the date fixed for the

consideration of the scheme of partition under section 35 or at any time not later

than thirty days after the return of the person responsible for the sale under

section 42 is received by court, apply to the court for special leave to establish

the right, title or interest of such party to or in the said land notwithstanding the

interlocutory decree already entered.

It is under these provisions of the Act, the 11th, 16th, 17th, 19th, 24th, and 25th

Defendants had made an application to the District Court of Gampaha seeking

special leave to establish the right, title or interest of them to or in the land

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 17 of 22

sought to be partitioned in the instant partition action notwithstanding the

interlocutory decree already entered therein based on the said premise.

Upon a careful perusal of the journal kept by Court in the said partition action,

it becomes abundantly, clear that in view of journal entries No. 6 of 09.10.1989,

No. 7 of 16.10.1989 and No. 8 of 05.03.1990, summons had never been

furnished to Court by the Plaintiff to be served on the 16th and 17th defendants

notwithstanding the order of Court to issue summons on each of them upon

furnishing the same to Court by the Plaintiff thus, clearly, manifesting that

summons had never been served on the 16th and 17th defendants as rightly,

found by the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha in the impugned

order (P8).

Hence, the said findings of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha so

arrived at by him on the evidence adduced before him at the said inquiry,

namely; summons had never been served on the 16th and 17th defendants, had

been well supported and fortified by the contents of the journal entries No. 6 of

09.10.1989, No. 7 of 16.10.1989 and No. 8 of 05.03.1990.

However, it is rather unfortunate to observe that, the learned Additional District

Judge of Gampaha, had having correctly, come to a definite finding on the

evidence adduced by the 11th Defendant at the inquiry into the said applications

which was well supported by the contents of the journal entries No. 6 of

09.10.1989, No. 7 of 16.10.1989 and No. 8 of 05.03.1990 that summons had not

been served on the 16th and 17th Defendants, nevertheless, proceeded to dismiss

the application made to Court by them by holding that despite the fact that

summons had not been served on each of them, they ought to have been aware

of the partition action by reason of the fact that some of the parties to the

partition action being siblings and thus, they could have been able to establish

their entitlement to the land sought to be partitioned had they really, so

endeavoured, which is in total contravention of the clear provisions contained in

sections 13(1), 14 and 19(1) of the Act read in conjunction with the well-

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 18 of 22

established principle of law as enumerated above, namely; Failure to serve

summons is a failure which goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the Court to

hear and determine the action against the defendant and that it is only by service

of summons on the defendant that the Court gets jurisdiction over the defendant

and that if a defendant is not served with summons or otherwise notified of the

proceedings against him, the judgment entered against him in those

circumstances is a nullity.

In the circumstances, I would hold that the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha had been in grave error in dismissing the application made to it by the

16th and 17th Defendants without granting special leave under and in terms of

section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act seeking special leave to establish the right, title or

interest of them to or in the land sought to be partitioned notwithstanding the

interlocutory decree had already been entered by erroneously, holding so.

I would therefore, hold that the order (P8) cannot in any manner, sustain both

in fact and law and as such it ought to be set aside.

Hence, I would proceed to grant special leave under section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act

as prayed for by the 16th and 17th Defendants in their joint application made to

the District Court of Gampaha.

Furthermore, the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha had come to

similar findings with regard to the application made to Court by the 11th

Defendant too, that he too, had not been served with summons in view of the

fact that he had been away from the country during all the time material to the

service of summons on him.

However, it is regretful to observe that the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha had having so found, nevertheless proceeded to reject his application

too, on the same premise as enumerated above, in total contravention of the

clear provisions contained in sections 13(1), 14 and 19(1) of the Act read in

conjunction with the well-established principle of law as enumerated above,

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 19 of 22

namely; Failure to serve summons is a failure which goes to the root of the

jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the action against the defendant

and that it is only by service of summons on the defendant that the Court gets

jurisdiction over the defendant and that if a defendant is not served with

summons or otherwise notified of the proceedings against him, the judgment

entered against him in those circumstances is a nullity.

In the circumstances, I would hold that the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha had been in grave error in dismissing the application made to it by the

11th Defendant under and in terms of section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act seeking special

leave to establish the right, title or interest of them to or in the land sought to be

partitioned notwithstanding the interlocutory decree had already been entered

by erroneously, holding so.

I would therefore, hold that the order (P8) cannot in any manner, sustain both

in fact and law and as such it ought to be set aside.

Hence, I would proceed to grant special leave under section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act

as prayed for by the 11th Defendants in the joint application made to the District

Court of Gampaha.

I would now, propose to deal with the application made to the District Court of

Gampaha under section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act by the 19th Defendant seeking

special leave thereunder, and the order made therein by the learned Additional

District Judge of Gampaha.

The point to be noted here is that Fiscal in his affidavit submitted to Court (P4)

affirms to the fact that summons had been duly, served on the 19th Defendant

by way of personal service and in view of the presumption of regularity arising

out of illustration ‘d’ of the section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance, namely; the

Judicial and Official acts have been regularly, performed, it is presumed that

summons had been duly, served upon the 19th Defendant and if he asserts on

the contrary, the sole burden of proof will have to be undertaken by him to rebut

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 20 of 22

the presumption so attached to the service of summons on him, by proof on the

contrary as required by sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Ordinance.

However, it is interesting to observe that the 19th Defendant had not even opted

to give evidence in Court in order to rebut the presumption of due service of

summons on him as enumerated above, arising out of the Fiscal report (P4) and

contents therein at the inquiry into his application.

Hence, I would hold that, the 19th Defendant had not in any manner, been able

to rebut the presumption of regularity arising out of illustration ‘d’ of the section

114 of the Evidence Ordinance that summons had been duly, served on him as

reported to Court by the Fiscal in his affidavit (P4) as rightly, found by the

learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha,

There is a further point, which vehemently, supports and fortifies the findings of

the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha that summons had been duly,

served on the 19th Defendant and this arises out of his own admission made by

the 19th Defendant in paragraph 12 of the petition of appeal filed before this

Court that he had been in Court on 16.10.1989 and he is thus, presumed to

have been in Court on that day in response to the summons duly served upon

him by Fiscal as reported to Court in his affidavit (P4) by him.

In the circumstances, I would see no reason to interfere with the decision of the

learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha dismissing the application made

to it by the 19th defendant under section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act.

Hence, I would affirm the decision of the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha dismissing the application made to it by the 19th defendant under

section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act.

I would next, deal with the application made to it by the 24th and 25th defendants

under and in terms of section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act seeking special leave to

establish their right, title or interest in or over the land sought to be partitioned

in the instant partition action on the basis that, their right, title or interest

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 21 of 22

therein, had been extinguished or they have been otherwise, prejudiced by the

interlocutory decree entered in the said partition action in view of the fact that

they being claimant before the Surveyor at the preliminary survey had been

added as parties to the instant partition action without notices being issued on

them as required by section 20 (1)(a) of the Act to be read with section 20(2)(a)

thereof and their addition as parties to the instant partition action has therefore,

been illegal and unlawful thereby making them totally, unaware of the partition

action to assert their lawful rights to the land sought to be partitioned.

It is common ground that, the 24th and 25th defendants had been claimant before

the Surveyor at the preliminary survey and according to the report to the

preliminary plan, notice of the action had been served by the surveyor on them

as required by section 16(3) of the Act. However, there had been nothing on

record to show that notices as required by section 20(1)(a) of the Act had been

issued on the 24th and 25th defendants nor, had any of them made an application

under section 20(3) of the Act to add them as parties to the instant partition

action. However, the learned District Judge of Gampaha had in total

contravention of the express provision contained in section 20(3) of the Act,

proceeded to add 24th and 25th defendants as parties to the instant partition

action ex mero motu without an application being made thereto, by them as

manifest from the journal entry 17 of 12.08.1991 so that the addition of both of

them as the 24th and 25th defendants to the instant partition action was totally,

unwarranted and therefore, in total contravention of the express provision

contained in section 20(3) of the Act and the inevitable legal consequence that

would derive therefrom is that, neither of them can in any manner, be regarded

as a party to the instant partition action.

In the result, neither of them being parties to the instant partition action, can

invoke the provisions of section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act to seek special leave to

establish their alleged right, title or interest in or over the land sought to be

CA/LTA/0347/2005

Page 22 of 22

partitioned in the instant partition action for; only a party to a partition action

can invoke the provisions of section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act.

I would therefore, hold that the application made to Court by the 24th and 25th

defendants is misconceived in law and as such it cannot sustain in law and

therefore, it ought to have been rejected in-limine by the learned Additional

District Judge of Gampaha on this ground alone and not on the ground adduced

by him for dismissal of the same.

I would therefore, proceed to affirm the order of the learned Additional District

Judge of Gampaha dismissing the application made to Court by the 24th and

25th defendants under section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Act seeking special leave as

aforesaid for the reasons adduced therefor, by me in this judgement and not on

the reasons adduced therefor, by the learned District Judge of Gampaha.

In view of the above, I would direct the learned District Judge of Gampaha to

hold an inquiry into the joint application made to Court by the 11th, 16th and

17th defendants strictly in terms of the law as provided for by section 48(4)(c), (d)

and (e) of the Act and conclude it as expeditiously, as possible.

In the circumstances, I would allow the appeal only of the 11th, 16th and 17th

defendants however, without costs, and dismiss the appeal of the 19th, 24th and

25th defendants with costs.

I would, accordingly, vary the order (P8). Subject to the aforesaid variation, I

would affirm the order (P8).
