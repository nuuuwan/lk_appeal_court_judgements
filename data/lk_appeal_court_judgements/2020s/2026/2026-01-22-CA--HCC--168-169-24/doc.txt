JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and the 2nd Appellant) were

indicted before the High Court of Embilipitiya on the charge of committing the offence of

robbery on or about 29.09.2012, punishable under Section 383 read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

At the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through ten witnesses and marking

productions P1-P6 and thereafter closed its case. Both Appellants, in their defence, made

dock statements.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court delivered judgment on

02.04.2024. Both Appellants were found guilty on the charge of robbery and were imposed

a sentence of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/- and 12 months

of simple imprisonment in default. And for the 2nd Appellant imposed a sentence of 5 years

Page 3 of 11

of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/- and 12 months of simple imprisonment

in default. Further, compensation of Rs. 500,000/- was ordered to be paid to the victim.

Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge, the Appellants preferred an appeal before this Court, articulating the

following grounds in support of their challenge.

The 1st Appellanst’s grounds are as follows,

a. The Learned High Court Judge of Ambilipitiya has failed to apply his judicial

mind in considering the substantial delay in holding the Identification Parade.

b. The Learned High Court Judge has not taken into account material

contradictions and Omissions made by the Prosecution Witnesses.

c. The Learned High Court Judge has not given due weightage to the accused Dock

Statements

d. The Prosecution has failed to establish the necessary elements in which the

offence of Robbery must be proved under the Penal Code.

The 2nd Appellant’s grounds of appeal are as follows,

1. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the factual and legal

issues;

2. That the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the objections raised by the

2nd accused appellant during the identification parade and failed to take into

consideration the time period;

3. That the learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the way in which the

accused was arrested, and failed to analyze the evidence against the accused.

4. That the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the contradictions emerged

in the evidence given by PW1, PW2 and failed to appreciate the inconsistencies

which were material to the accused;

5. That the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself with regard to the

consistencies and probabilities of the Prosecution evidence in giving the judgment;

6. That the learned High Court Judge failed to relate the facts and circumstances

that emerged from facts and evidence transpired in this case and thereby failing

to give protection to the accused appellant under justice;

Page 4 of 11

7. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that some of the

evidence given by the prosecution witness were mere assumptions and not legally

sustainable evidence;

8. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that the

investigations in this case was inadequately conducted and no productions were

recovered in the possession of the 2nd accused- appellant;

9. That the Learned High Court Judge convicted the 2nd accused appellant without

giving reasonable consideration to the dock statement provided by the 2nd accused

appellant.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW 01 K.Sisira Kumara on the day of the incident, his wife and two children were at home

with a plan to go to Rathnapura. At approximately 5:50 a.m., he went to fill water into his

lorry and observed both Appellants passing by his house. After filling the lorry with water,

he noticed the two Appellants standing at his gate. They inquired whether he knew a

person named Dammika, who had allegedly deserted the Army, to which he replied in the

negative. After conversing with the Appellants, who identified themselves as Army

officers, and along with the witness, they entered through the gate. Upon hearing them,

PW 2 came out of the house. The second Appellant requested a glass of water, which PW

2 provided. PW2 then inquired whether they possessed Army identity cards, where the

second Appellant was presented. At that time, PW 1’s son was present in the living room.

At one point, the second accused placed his hand in his pocket, and a bullet fell out,

causing them to panic.

Suddenly, the 1st accused entered the house holding a firearm. The 1st accused

threatened to kill his son and ordered the family to come inside. Upon entering, the 1st

accused struck him with the gun. gun. The 2nd accused remained at the door with his

wife and daughter. Subsequently, all four family members were taken into a room.

One of the accused tore a bedsheet and forced it into the victim's mouth, while also binding

his hands behind his back. His wife's mouth was similarly covered with the bedsheet. The

1st accused then pointed the firearm at them, while the 2nd Appellant searched the house.

The Appellants seized money and jewellery. Both possessed firearms and threatened the

family. After collecting the valuables, the 2nd accused took the key to the family's

motorcycle and left it in the bike.

Page 5 of 11

His son's hands had not been tied, and he subsequently untied him. They observed chili

flakes scattered across the house. They screamed, and their neighbors gathered. He was

then taken to Godakawela Hospital. Someone had called 119, and the police arrived at

the hospital to record his statement. Later, he identified the two accused at an

identification parade conducted in court. He noted that the firearm carried by the accused

resembled a pistol, although he could not recall it in detail.

During cross-examination, counsel for the 1st accused suggested that the Hakmana police

had shown the Appellant to the witness with a photograph prior to the identification

parade. The witness denied this suggestion and affirmed that he identified the 1st accused

during the parade itself. Counsel further suggested that the victim had informed the

police that the accused had taken jewellery from the Almira. The witness clarified that

the jewellery had been placed on the table, and it was the money that the accused had

taken from the Almira. The defence counsel also suggested that the witness had not

informed the police about the scar on the 1st accused’s forehead, and the prosecution

counsel drew the court’s attention to the fact that this was recorded in the official notes.

Finally, defence counsel suggested that the victim was falsely accusing the 1st accused of

robbery. The witness rejected this suggestion, stating that he was able to clearly identify

the accused, as they were not wearing masks at the time of the incident.

During cross-examination, counsel for the 2nd accused questioned the witness about

whether he possessed any receipts for the items or held a license to pawn them in

exchange for money. The witness replied that he had only given a small amount of money

and therefore did not have any receipts for the items. With regard to the 2nd accused,

counsel suggested that during the identification parade, it was noted that the 2nd accused

had taken the motorcycle while the 1st accused rode on the back. The witness, however,

clarified that he had not directly observed this, as he was inside the house at the time,

and only heard the sound of the accused leaving.

The objections taken by the 1st Appellant regarding the identification parade were that,

following his arrest at the Hakmana Police Station, the Embilipitiya Police had shown

him to five women and two men prior to the parade. The 2nd Appellant stated that the

police had also shown him to the witnesses and taken photographs of him.

PW2, Sandya Kumari, testified that on the alleged day, she overheard her husband

speaking with someone and went to investigate. She observed PW1 conversing with two

men, who informed her that they were Army officers searching for an individual who had

Page 6 of 11

deserted the Army. PW1 mentioned that he would invite them in for tea and proceeded to

open the gate. During this exchange, she heard the men refer to a person named

Dammika. After changing her clothes, the witness stepped outside, at which point the 2nd

accused requested a glass of water. Upon returning with it, she saw the 1st Appellant

seated on a chair in the living room, while the 2nd accused remained standing near the

main door. She handed the water to him and asked about their identities, requesting to

see their Army identity cards. The 2nd accused produced a card from a distance but did

not hand it over, prompting her to take it directly from his hand.

At that moment, the 1st accused suddenly pointed a gun at her son and issued threats.

PW1 then entered the house. The witness, who was holding their daughter, stood beside

the 2nd accused. The 2nd accused ordered her to go inside. Upon entering, she observed

PW1 bleeding from the head, while her son pleaded with the 1st accused not to harm his

father. The 2nd accused proceeded to tie them up, as the 1st Appellant continued to aim

the firearm at them. Meanwhile, the 2nd accused searched the house. She further stated

that three bags were placed on the table containing approximately Rs. 125,000 along with

several items of jewellery that belonged to their family, while others were items they had

accepted as pawns.

She was subsequently taken out of the room and asked to indicate where the motorcycle

key was kept. At that moment, she observed that the bags which had been on the dining

table were no longer there. She further stated that the 2nd accused continued to search

the house and removed money from the Almira. The 2nd accused then instructed the 1st

accused to take the necklace worn by her daughter; however, the 1st accused refused,

remarking that he too had a daughter of the same age. Before departing, both accused

threatened the family not to inform the police. She then heard them close the door and

leave on the motorcycle.

Afterwards, she instructed her son to bring a knife. Since her hands had not been tied,

she managed to untie her legs and subsequently freed PW1. Upon leaving the room, they

noticed chili flakes scattered across the floor. They immediately ran outside, shouting for

help. Neighbors gathered at the scene, and after contacting the emergency number 119,

PW1 was taken to the hospital.

During cross-examination, the witness stated that she had been informed of the suspects’

arrest by the Godakawela Police. Counsel for the 1st Appellant suggested that she and

PW1 had visited the Hakmana Police Station, where the police allegedly showed them the

Page 7 of 11

1st Appellant. The witness denied this suggestion and maintained that she identified the

accused during an identification parade conducted at the Embilipitiya Magistrate’s Court.

She further testified that none of the stolen jewellery or money was returned by the police.

PW7, IPS Sepala Pushpakumara, testified that he became aware of the robbery on

29.09.2020 due to a complaint to 119 and thereafter proceeded to PW1’s residence. At the

scene, he observed traces of blood as well as chilli powder inside the house. He further

stated that armed individuals had entered the premises, tied the PW 1’s and PW 2’s

hands, and committed the robbery. According to the witnesses, they would be able to

identify the perpetrators if they saw them again.

During cross-examination, the defence contended that when the appellants were arrested

at the Hakmana Police Station, the witness had provided their photographs to the other

witnesses and thereby assisted them in identifying the appellants during the

identification parade. The witness denied this allegation. The defence further suggested

that the investigation had not been conducted properly and that the complaint itself was

false.

PW7(a), OIC Chandana Wijesekara, testified that on 02.11.2012, he received information

concerning the transportation of illegal ganja and weapons. Acting on this tip, at a

roadblock, four individuals were apprehended. Among those arrested was the 1st

Appellant, who was found in possession of a firearm and five bullets.

During cross-examination, the defence suggested that, following the arrest, the witness

had introduced the 1st Appellant to the other witnesses. The witness denied this

allegation. The defence further contended that the witness had shown photographs of the

appellants to the witnesses beforehand, thereby influencing their identification during

the identification parade.

Upon the conclusion of the prosecution, the defence was called. The 1st Appellant stated

that he had been arrested along with four others and that nine cases had been filed

against him. He further claimed that he was detained at the Hakmana Police Station for

nine days, during which the police showed him to numerous people and took photographs

of him. According to the Appellant, the police instructed those individuals to remember

his scar if they forgot his appearance. He also alleged that, prior to the identification

parade, the witnesses in this case had spoken with the Godakawela Police while he was

being held in the Ambilipitiya fiscal cell.

Page 8 of 11

In the dock statement, the 2nd Appellant stated that he had previously engaged in a fight

with Police Officer Wickremasinghe, after which the officer threatened him again while

he was in the village. He further claimed that, upon the request of the police, the Navy

handed him over police to give a statement on allegations of possessing firearms. The

Appellant alleged that, during open court proceedings, he was shown to the witnesses and

photographs of him were taken. He maintained that he had no involvement in the matter

and asserted that the complaint was fabricated by the officer due to personal animosity.

During the argument stage, the principal objection raised by counsel was that both

witnesses had been shown photographs of the Appellants by the police prior to the

identification parade. In considering this objection, I am mindful of the following

judgments relating to the conduct and evidentiary value of identification parades.

Pallawa Lekamlage Gayan Sanjeewa alias Asanka Wellawela and 2 Others v. Attorney

General, CA 246/2009, Decided On 01.09.2015, Vijith K. Malalgoda PC. J (P/CA) held

that;

“In the land mark case on identification Regina V. Turnbull and another 1977 (1)

QB 224 at 228 the question of visual identification in Criminal cases was discussed

as follows; ............. Secondly the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the

circumstances in which the identification by each witness came to be made. How

long did the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In

what light? Was the observation impeded in anyway, as for example by passing

traffic or a press of people? Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How

often? If only occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the

accused.”

Opatha Widanapathiranege Wasantha and 3 Others v. Attorney General (2010. V. II

Unreported), CA 179/2006 , Decided on 29.04.2010, W.L. Ranjith Silva, J

“ The Learned Trial Judge ought to have followed the standard guidelines with

regard to his directions to the jury. On the issue of identification evidence, the

judges must give accurate directions regarding the identification evidence and

direct the jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the

accused was correctly identified and give the benefit of any doubt to the accused.

The Jury must be directedas to the possibility of a mistaken identify even by

Page 9 of 11

honest witnesses and if they cannot make up their minds as to whether the

witnesses were lying or mistaken the accused must be given the benefit of the

doubt and should be acquitted. The trial judge must direct the jury to examine

closely the circumstances under which the identification came to be made and the

means of identification. The trial judge should direct the jury on the rules laid

down in Rex v. Turnbull.”

It is noted that neither of the Appellants claimed that they were wrongly identified. Their

position, rather, was that prior to the identification parade, they had been shown to the

witnesses. Under Section 9 of the Evidence Ordinance, the identification of any person at

such a parade, where the identity of that person is relevant, is recognized as a relevant

fact.

With regard to visual identification, our courts have consistently held that a witness must

demonstrate that there was sufficient opportunity to observe the person concerned at the

time of the incident. The witness should thereafter be able to identify that individual

when giving evidence and be able to narrate how he was able to identify the person before

the court. The rationale behind this principle is that, if an innocent person is wrongly

identified, he could be convicted solely on the basis of the identification made at the

parade.

I am mindful of the guidelines which were laid down in R v Turnbull (C.A.), [1977] 1 Q.B.

224 at page 228.

“Secondly, the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in

which the identification by each witness came to be made. How long did the witness

have the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was the

observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of

people? Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How often? If only

occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused? How long

elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the

police? Was there any material discrepancy between the description of the accused

given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his actual

appearance? If in any case, whether it is being dealt with summarily or on

indictment, the prosecution have reason to believe that there is such a material

discrepancy they should supply the accused or his legal advisers with particulars

of the description the police were first given. In all cases if the accused asks to be

Page 10 of 11

given particulars of such descriptions, the prosecution should supply them.

Finally, he should remind the jury of any specific weaknesses which had appeared

in the identification evidence.”

In the instant case, both PW1 and PW2 remained consistent from the very beginning,

starting with their statements at the police station.

When considering the evidence of PW1 and PW2, it is clear that both witnesses had ample

opportunity to identify the Appellants. At the identification parade, they explained the

basis upon which they recognized the Appellants, and they reiterated the same

explanation during the trial. Counsel for the Appellants was unable to establish any

contradictions in their testimony. It is further noted that the faces of the Appellants were

not covered at the time of the incident, and both had conversed with the witnesses. We

observe that PW1 and PW2 had sufficient time to have a close look at both Appellants. In

addition, PW1 testified that the 1st Appellant bore a scar on his forehead.

For the said reasons, we reject the defence version that they were shown before the parade

to the witnesses. We hold that both witnesses correctly identified both Appellants.

Therefore, having considered the evidence adduced before this Court, we find no reason

to reject the identification parade at which both witnesses identified the Appellants.

Page 11 of 11

Considering all of the above, this court is of the opinion that the evidence of PW 1 and PW

2 has clearly established without a doubt the identity of both Accused. Therefore, the

learned trial judges conclude that the witness’s evidence, which identifies both the

Appellants, can be believed.

In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the judgment delivered by the

Learned High Court Judge together with the sentencing order and dismiss the appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed.
