However, there is a divergence in the approach of the Supreme Court to this issue. In De Silva v. Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Another [(1993) 1 Sri.L.R. 283] Fernando J. held that a writ of mandamus will issue directing the Minister to divest land acquired by the State if the four conditions in section 39A of the Act are fulfilled. This was quoted with approval and followed by the Supreme Court in Rashid v. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Lands and Others [(2004) 1 Sri.L.R. 312] and Mahinda Katugaha v.

Similar line of thinking is found in Wijewardena v. Minister of Lands and Others [S.C.

It is pertinent to note that it is common ground that part of the land has been used for water retention and the rest which is within the water basin for public purpose. Hence, the land acquired has been used for the public purpose and the Petitioner\u2019s prayer (b) has to fail. In any event, this Court observes that the land was acquired in the year 17.09.2011 (P3). The Petitioner is attempting to quash the said acquisition by this Writ Application filed in the year 2022, i.e., 11 years after the land was acquired. The Petitioner has failed to explain this delay to challenge this acquisition. It is trite law that unexplained delay defeats the reliefs sought by a party in a Writ Application. The",

In my judgment above, I have discussed why a Writ of Mandamus will not lie in this instance. The Petitioner has also sought a Writ of Mandamus, directing the 2nd Respondent and any one or more of Respondents to pay the Petitioner compensation. It is observed that the Petitioner is seeking compensation only in respect of 9 perches of land. However, as I have observed above, and as the learned State Counsel has demonstrated, compensation for the land in its entirety has been awarded and it is the Petitioner who has failed to claim the said compensation. In the absence of the Petitioner claiming the compensation awarded to her, the Petitioner in the given circumstances has failed to establish that the Respondents have failed to perform a public duty owed towards the Petitioner. I find that there is no refusal by the Respondents to pay compensation. Hence, as per the material submitted, the Petitioner has failed to establish that the Respondents have refused to exercise the powers to perform the duty that is owed to her. Hence, prayers (c) and (d) have to fail.",

However, it is pertinent to observe that under alternative remedies the Petitioner has prayed for a Writ of Prohibition to prevent the Respondents from transferring and/or conveying the said land to any said person other than the Petitioner. The Petitioner has failed to adduce any material to substantiate this argument. Hence, I find the Petitioner has failed to establish that the Respondents are in the process of engaging in an illegal act of acting ultra vires their powers. It is also pertinent to note that in the Petition or even at the hearing, the Counsel failed to bring to the attention of the Court to any ground demonstrating that the Respondents were intending to alienate any portion of this land to a third party.",
