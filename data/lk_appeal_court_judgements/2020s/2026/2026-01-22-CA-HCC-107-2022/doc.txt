JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) has

been indicted in the High Court of Kandy in High Court case number HC

101/2019.

The charges in the indictment are as follows:

Charge 01

That on or about, June 15, 2018, at Pujapitiya, in the district of Kandy,

within the jurisdiction of this Court, the appellant did possess 6.352

grams of Diacetyl Morphine, an offence punishable in terms of section

54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

During the course of the same transaction, the appellant did traffic 6.352

grams of Diacetyl Morphine, an offence punishable in terms of section

Page 3 of 11

54A(d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Act No.13 of 1984.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the first charge and acquitted him of the

second charge. Upon the conviction of the first charge, has proceeded to

impose the death sentence on the appellant.

3. The appellant aggrieved by the conviction, disputed judgment together

with the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. During the relevant period, PW01 and PW02 have been assigned to the

police narcotics bureau subunit in Kandy. On June 15, 2018, PW01 has

received a tip from an informant regarding the trafficking of a quantity of

heroin by an individual in the Pujapitiya area of Kandy. PW01 has

subsequently decided to conduct a raid to apprehend the person

identified by the informant.

5. At approximately 15.40 hours, PW01, PW02 and the other officers named

in the testimony have departed from their assigned unit. They have been

dressed in civilian attire and have arrived in Pujapitiya around 16.30

hours. PW01 has met his informant near the “Food City” super market in

Pujapitiya to discuss the specifics of the planned raid.

6. Thereafter, the officers have moved to a location near a temple on

Ankumbura road. Each officer has positioned himself as described in the

testimony. As at approximately 16.55 hours, the informant has alerted

PW01 to the named individual’s movements. Anticipating the arrival, the

Page 4 of 11

officers have stopped the three wheel scooter described by the informant

as it approached their position.

7. PW01 has identified its driver as the individual named in the information

i.e. the appellant, thereafter has detained and searched him. Upon

inspection, PW01 has retrieved a parcel wrapped in a piece of a pink

cellophane bag, from the appellant’s right front trouser pocket. PW01 has

determined that the contents of the parcel to be heroin.

8. Subsequently, the appellant has been questioned extensively regarding

the source of the narcotic substance. The officers and the appellant have

departed the scene of arrest at approximately 18.35 hours, arriving at

the Pujapitiya Police Station around 18.50 hours. PW01 has then

proceeded to weigh the heroin and seal the parcel for production as

evidence in subsequent legal proceedings. The sealed parcel has been

registered under police property receipt 298/2018.

9. PC 21460 Siriwardana has, as directed by PW01, recorded a statement of

the appellant beginning 19.40 hours. At approximately 20.30 hours, the

sealed parcel along with the appellant has been handed over to the

Officer-in-Charge of the reserve at the Pujapitiya Police Station.

10. The sealed parcel has thereafter been sent to the Government Analyst

Department for analysis. The report from the analyst designated as

exhibit පැ15 has been presented as evidence.

Case of the appellant

11. The appellant has asserted the parcel containing heroin was not

recovered from his possession. He has contended that the discovery of

Page 5 of 11

the parcel was a fabrication or an act of planting, effectively meaning it

was introduced, to implicate him falsely.

Grounds of appeal

12. When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the

appellant urged the following grounds of appeal:

i. The learned High Court Judge has not evaluated the prosecution

evidence in total with the dock statement.

ii. Has the inward journey of the production been established by the

prosecution?

13. The Counsel for the appellant has maintained that the prosecution has

not discharged its burden of proof because it neglected to present

testimony from all witnesses identified on the back of the indictment. The

Counsel has contended that this deliberate omission leaves gaps in the

evidence presented, raising a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt

and prevented the prosecution from establishing its case with the

cogency required by law.

14. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 14 of 1895 reads as follows:

No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the

proof of any fact.

15. The primary implication of section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance is the

adoption of the principle that “evidence must not be counted but

weighed”. This has several key consequences in the Sri Lankan legal

system. A court can convict an accused or determine a case solely on the

Page 6 of 11

uncorroborated evidence of a single witness provided that the judge finds

that the witness to be cogent, credible, trustworthy and impressive.

16. The law does not require corroboration of witness’s testimony as an

essential condition for a conviction. The trial Judge has the discretion to

rely on the testimony if satisfied with its veracity after careful probing.

The emphasis is shifted from a mere head count of witnesses to a careful

judicial analysis and evaluation of the witness’s demeanor, consistency,

and overall trustworthiness of his testimony.

17. This principle applies across various cases including charges like drug

related offences based on police detections. In essence, section 134 of the

Evidence Ordinance ensures that justice is not hindered by technical

requirements for a minimum number of witnesses.

18. In Sumanasena v Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 137, Jayasuriya J. has

held as follows:

“Evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single

solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court of

law.”

19. In the present case, the prosecution has presented essential witness

testimony to establish its case. The testimony covers the entire chain of

events, commencing with the initial information received regarding the

offence. It details the subsequent execution of the raid, the detention,

search of the appellant and the recovery of the parcel of heroin.

20. Furthermore, witnesses have testified about the appellant’s arrest, the

weighing and sealing of the heroin containing parcel and its subsequent

transfer to proper custody. The prosecution’s evidence also traces the

Page 7 of 11

inward journey of this sealed parcel until it was retrieved to be taken for

analysis at the Government Analyst Department.

21. Crucially, the appellant has not disputed that the securely sealed parcel

was handed over to the Government Analyst Department nor has the

appellant contested that its contents were the subject of the analysis.

This lack of dispute has been recorded as an admission by the trial

Court. The government analysis report designated as exhibit පැ15

confirms that the contents in the parcel consisted of 6.352 grams of pure

heroin.

22. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is my considered view that the

prosecution has successfully led the testimony of witness who were

indispensable in establishing all material elements of its case.

23. In Sri Lanka, the making of notes by police officers is a professional duty

and a critical part of the investigative process. The requirement for notes

to be made at the time or as soon as practicable afterwards, is

paramount. Notes made while the event is fresh in the officer’s mind are

considered a more accurate record than memory alone, which is fallible

over time.

24. As cases may go to trial, months or years after an incident, officers can

rely on their notes to refresh their memory and provide accurate

testimony in courts. It is crucial for police officers to include significant

details in their notes for accuracy of evidence and legal purposes. But it

is about relevant details and not about every trivial thing.

25. In essence, the notes should be clear, factual, and objective record of

what happened, supporting the officer’s memory and the integrity of the

case rather than a word to word transcript of every passing incident.

26. The learned Counsel for the appellant with reference to pages 90 and 91

of the brief has argued that PW01 has acknowledged the omission of

critical details from his notes. These critical details pertaining to the

precise location on the appellant’s clothing from which the parcel of

heroin was retrieved and the method by which PW01 secured it, were not

recorded.

[vide page 91 of the brief]

27. This failure to document these essential particulars, the learned Counsel

has argued created a reasonable doubt as to whether the parcel of heroin

was in fact recovered from the possession of the appellant.

28. As previously discussed, the primary purpose for a police officer making

a note is to refresh the officer’s memory and ensure accurate testimony.

To achieve this, it is crucial that the officer includes sufficient details

ensuring both accuracy and legal compliance. While the relevance is key,

not every trivial fact requires inclusion.

29. In this specific instance, the relevant facts that warrant inclusion are the

recovery of the parcel of heroin from the appellant’s possession and the

subsequent unbroken chain of custody maintained by PW01 until the

Page 9 of 11

officers accompanied by the appellant reach the Pujapitiya Police Station.

These facts being directly pertinent to the legality and execution of the

raid have been accurately documented in PW01’s notes. Therefore, any

arguments suggesting that PW01’s notes is deficient of crucial details, is

without merit.

30. The appellant has also been thoroughly question about where he

obtained the parcel of heroin that has been found in his possession.

Such circumstances have not enabled PW01 to make a note at the scene

of arrest.

31. A dock statement should not be considered in isolation but should be

evaluated by a judge within the context of all the evidence presented in

the case. The trier of fact must consider the entire prosecution’s case and

the accused’s narrative holistically. The statement must be considered to

see if it creates a reasonable doubt regarding the prosecution’s case. If

the trier believes the statement or if it raises a reasonable doubt, the

defence must succeed.

32. In the case of The Queen v D. G. De S. Kularatne, 71 NLR 529, it was held

that:

“….when an unsworn statement is made by the accused from the dock,

the jurors must be informed that such statement must be looked upon as

evidence, subject however to the infirmity that the accused had

deliberately refrained from giving sworn testimony. But the jury must also

be directed that (a) if they believe the unsworn statement it must be acted

upon, (b) if it raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for

the prosecution, the defence must succeed, and (c) that it should not be

used against another accused.”

Page 10 of 11

33. In the judgment under dispute, the learned High Court Judge has

meticulously reproduced the appellant’s dock statement. The court has

then proceeded to analyze the contents of the statement against the

backdrop of the prosecution’s evidence.

34. The ultimate finding has been that the appellant’s dock statement did

not succeed in casting a reasonable doubt upon the prosecution’s case

concerning the first charge set out in the indictment. This conclusion has

been arrived at through a holistic review, wherein the dock statement

has been considered as an integral part of the entire evidentiary record,

rather than in isolation. Consequently, the dock statement has been

evaluated within its appropriate evidentiary context.

35. Further, the officers serving at the Pujapitiya Police Station Reserve,

during the relevant period the sealed heroin parcel was kept there, have

testified regarding their diligent efforts in tracing the inward journey of

the sealed parcel containing heroin. This parcel recovered from the

appellant’s possession has been subsequently transferred to the

Government Analyst Department for examination.

36. Officers have maintained detailed notes documenting their reporting to

duty at the reserve and the meticulous process of taking charge of all

items present in the reserve including the sealed parcel of heroin. While

this specific inclusion has not been explicitly articulated in their notes,

the appellant has not challenged the fact that the securely sealed heroin

parcel was delivered to the Government Analyst Department for analysis

nor the subsequent analysis of its content. Therefore, based on these

established facts, the second ground of appeal is without merit.

37. Due to the matters discussed above, I am not inclined to interfere with

the conviction, disputed judgment and the sentencing order and proceed

to affirm the same. I dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

I make no order regarding costs.

38. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court in Kandy for compliance.
