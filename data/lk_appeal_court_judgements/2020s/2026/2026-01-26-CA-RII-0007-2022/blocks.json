Court held inter alia\u201cIt was not the function of the Supreme Court, in the exercise of jurisdiction now invoked, to relieve parties of consequences of their own folly, negligence or laches. The maxim vigilantibus, non-dormientibus jura subveniunt provided a sufficient answer to the petitioner\u2019s application....\u201d In Kotte Hewa Swarnamali Thilinka Deshabandu vs Ranatunga arachchige Harsha Deva and another SC/Appeal/130/2025 decided on 18-12-2025 Justice Samayawardhena held as follows: \u201cWhere a settlement is recorded in Open Court by the District Judge in the presence of the parties and their Attorneys-at-Law, and the parties are in the record signifying their consent to its terms, such settlement is final and binding. It constitutes a contract entered into among parties and once so entered, a party cannot thereafter resile from it merely because he later forms the view that the settlement is unfavourable to him. The only recognised grounds upon which such a settlement may be set aside are those applicable to rescission of a contract, mainly illegality, fraud, mistake, misrepresentation, coercion, undue influence or other similar vitiating factors. Such instances are rare.\u201d In the same case Justice Samayawardhena cited the case of Lameer vs Senaratne [1995] 2 Sri LR 13, \u201cthis is an application for Restitution before the Court of Appeal.\u201d Justice Ranaraja held that \u201cwhen an Attorney-at-Law has been given several authorities to settle or compromise a case, as was admittedly done in the instant case, a client cannot seek to set aside a settlement so entered by way of Restitution more so where the client himself has signed the record accepting the terms of settlement.\u201d In the case of Silva vs Fonseka 23 NLR 447, it was held that \u201cwhere a proctor has by his proxy general authority to settle and compromise a case without consulting his client, the client is not entitled to relief by way of Restitutio-in-Integrum if the proctor settles the case without his consent. But where the settlement has been made contrary to the express instructions of the client, relief by way of Restitutio-in-Integrum is available.\u201d In the same case, Bertram CJ held that \u201cWe have never done so unless some departure from express instruction is shown.\u201d",
