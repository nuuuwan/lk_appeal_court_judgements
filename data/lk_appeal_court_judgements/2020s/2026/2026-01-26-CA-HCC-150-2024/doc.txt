JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) has

been indicted in the High Court of Kandy in High Court case number

HC 158/2018.

2. The charge in the indictment is as follows;

That on or about, July 26, 2014, the appellant did commit the

offence of rape on a woman, an offence punishable under section

364(1) of the Penal Code (Amendment Act, No.22 of 1995).

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant has been convicted of the

offence in the charge and sentenced as followed;

A term of 20 years rigorous imprisonment along with a fine

of Rs.15,000. A term of 6 months’ simple imprisonment has

been imposed in default of the payment of the fine.

Further, the appellant has been ordered to pay a sum of

Rs. 1,000,000 as compensation to PW01 with a term of 24

months’ rigorous imprisonment imposed in default.

4. Being aggrieved by the conviction, the disputed judgment and

sentencing order, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court. When the matter was taken up for argument the learned Counsel

for the appellant informed Court that he intended to limit the ground of

appeal to the following;

i. The sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is

disproportionate and excessive. Therefore, the sentence is

contrary to sentencing policy.

5. The learned Counsel for the appellant has contended the sentence

imposed on the appellant was extreme and the sentence of 20 years’

rigorous imprisonment imposed in respect of the charge is the

maximum sentence imposed by statute.

Additionally, the learned Counsel for the appellant has contended that

the following circumstances be taken into consideration and a variation

of the sentence be made in favour of the appellant. The learned Counsel

for the appellant has set out the following occurrences in mitigation;

i. The appellant was thirty-five years old at the time of the

occurrence.

ii. That the appellant had no previous convictions or pending

cases.

iii. That the appellant was a first-time offender.

iv. That the appellant was married and a father of two children.

v. That the second child was very young and attending

preschool.

vi. That the trial has concluded nine years after its

commencement.

vii. That the appellant has demonstrated remorse while

refraining from challenging the conviction and instead

limiting the appeal to the sentencing order.

6. The learned Additional Solicitor General has contended that the

appellant has deceived PW01 and her parents by falsely presenting

himself as capable of performing acts connected with black magic, when

in fact he served as a labourer at a government institution and had no

such ability.

It is argued that by making these representations the appellant has

induced PW01 and her family to place trust in him, and then betrayed

that trust.

Further, the learned Additional Solicitor General has submitted that the

incident was not accidental or spontaneous, but was pre-planned.

According to the prosecution, the appellant has deliberately exploited

the vulnerable circumstances of PW01 and her family; taking advantage

of their beliefs, fears and dependence on his supposed “powers” to

further his own ends.

In doing so, he is said to have manipulated the situation to create an

opportunity to commit the offence. The learned Additional Solicitor

General has also emphasised the seriousness of the offence, submitting

the offence for which the appellant stands convicted is grave in nature.

7. To begin with, it is reasonable to consider the sentence described by

law for the offence stated in the charge set out in the indictment.

Section 364(1) of the Penal Code (Amendment Act, No.22 of 1995) is as

follows;

(1) Whoever commits rape shall, except, in the cases provided

for in sub-sections (2) and (3), be punished with rigorous

imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and not

exceeding twenty years and with fine, and shall in addition

be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined

by Court, to the person in respect of whom the offence was

committed for the injuries caused to such person.

8. PW01 has been twenty years old when the appellant committed the

offence on her. The best interests of women are in jeopardy due to the

rise in sexual offences, a trend that does not bode well for future

generations.

Sri Lankan cultural values are also at risk as communities lose their

sense of safety and trust. Beyond the immediate harm, many young

lives are broken or deeply disturbed, with their future diverted off

course. Therefore, the psychological consequences for victims and the

long-term effects on families and society must be treated as a

paramount concern in this instance.

9. Further, in determining the appropriate punishment, the Court is

required to consider the same from the point of view of the convict as

well as the public.

10. In Attorney General vs. H. N. de Silva 57 NLR 121, Basnayake, ACJ,

explaining the matters that should be taken into consideration in

determining the sentence has stated as follows;

“In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an

offender, a Judge should consider the matter of sentence both

from the point of view of the public and the offender, Judges are

too often prone to look at the question only from the angle of the

offender. A Judge should, in determining the proper sentence,

first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the

nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the

offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be

effective. If the offender held a position of trust or belonged to a

service which enjoys the public confidence that must be taken

into account in assessing the punishment. The incident of crimes

of the nature of which the offender has been found to be guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should

receive due consideration. The reformation of the criminal,

though no doubt an important consideration is subordinate to the

others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare

of the State (which are synonymous) outweighs the previous

good character, antecedents and age of the offender, public

interest must prevail.”

11. Convictions for rape carry significant implications not just for the victim

but for the society as a whole ensuring that individuals convicted of

grave offences are dealt with appropriately. It is also crucial for justice

and further deterrence of future offences that the legal consequences

imposed on individuals convicted of rape are designed to reflect the

seriousness of the crime.

Page 7 of 9

12. S. N. Silva, J, as he was then, in assessing the aggravating

circumstances as regards to the offence of rape has stated as follows in

Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe [1993] 2 SLR 81,

“It is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the

Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal of England, with regard

to the sentence to be imposed for an offence of rape. In the case

of Roberts (4) at page 244. It was observed as follows;

“Rape is always a serious crime. Other than in wholly

exceptional circumstances, it calls for an immediate custodial

sentence. This was certainly so in the present case. A custodial

sentence is necessary for a variety of reasons. First of all to mark

the gravity of the offence. Secondly to emphasise public

disapproval. Thirdly to serve as a warning to others. Fourthly to

punish the offender, and last but by no means least, to protect

women. The length of the sentence will depend on all the

circumstances. That is a trite observation, but these, in cases of

rape vary widely from case to case.

In the case of, Keith Billiam [5] the Lord Chief Justice

repeated the foregoing observations and stated that in a

contested case of rape a figure of five years imprisonment should

be taken as the starting point of the sentence, subject to any

aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as

follows:-

The crime should in any event be treated as aggravated by

any of the following factors : (1) violence is used over and above

the force necessary to commit the rape; (2) a weapon is used to

frighten or wound the victim; (3) the rape is repeated; (4) the rape

has been carefully planned; (5) the defendant has previous

Page 8 of 9

convictions for rape or other serious offences of a violent or sexual

kind; (6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities or

perversions; (7) the victim is either very old or very young: (8) the

effect upon the victim, whether physical or mental, is of special

seriousness. Where any one or more of these aggravating

features are present, the sentence should be substantially higher

than the figure suggested as the starting point.””

13. It is seen that the appellant has been thirty-five years old at the time he

committed the offence in the charge and the rape pre-planned.

However, I also take into consideration the fact that the rape has not

been repeated on the victim and also that the appellant does not have

previous convictions or pending cases.

14. Accordingly, taking the above matters into consideration, I am of the

view that the ends of justice would be satisfied if a lesser sentence be

imposed.

15. Therefore, I set aside the sentence of 20 years rigorous imprisonment

imposed in respect of the offence stated in the charge and, sentence the

appellant to a term of 15 years rigorous imprisonment in respect of such

offence.

The fine imposed in respect of the offence and the sum ordered to be

paid as compensation together with the terms of imprisonment imposed

in default of the payment of the same, shall remain unchanged. The

substantive term of 15 years rigorous imprisonment shall commence

from the date of conviction i.e. December 11,2023.

16. Subject to the above variation, the appeal is partly allowed.

Appeal partly allowed.

I make no order regarding costs.

17. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to

the High Court of Kandy for compliance.
