JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The first Accused Appellant (herein after referred to as the Appellant) has filed this appeal

against the judgment delivered on 11.08.2017. It should be noted that originally the Accused

Appellant, along with 3 other Accused, namely Meera Sahib Mohammad Riyath,

Zaimulabdeen Nizfer, Sally Mohammad Alimudeen, had been indicted for committing the

murder of Mohammad Mohammadu Musthapa Thaskhan on or about 8th September 2006

at Kalamuni, which is punishable under section 296 and read along with section 32 of the

Penal Code.

After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge delivered judgment on 10.07.2012, acquitted

Zaimulabdeen Nizfer and convicted the other three Accused. Against the said judgment, the

Appellant, along with the other 2 accused, referred an appeal to the Court of Appeal. By

judgment dated 01.08.2014, the case for retrial was ordered on the basis that the Accused

party had not been afforded a proper and fair trial.

Thereafter, the 1st accused Appellant, along with the other 2 accused, namely Mohammad

Riyath, Sally Mohammad Alimudeen (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd and the 3rd Accused),

were charged for the murder of Mohammadu Musthapa Thaskhan. Later, Honourable

Attorney General amended the indictment by inserting all three accused, along with an

unknown person, to the prosecution caused the death of Mohammadu Musthapa Thaskhan.

The said trial was commenced on 31st May 2016, and the prosecution led the evidence of PW

01, Mohamadu Ismail Nazeer, PW 3, Mohamadu Ismail Bazeer, PW 5, Ibralebbe Najeem,

PW 4, Mohamadu Mustaq Muhamadu Rizly, PW 6, Abdul Cader Faizal, PW 7, Dr Arjuna

Thilakaratne, PW 8, Police Sergeant Abubaker Anzar, PW 09, Retired Sub Inspector - Nimal

Karunaratne, PW 10, Chief Inspector Jemeel, PW 11, Dr Mohammad Thambi Mohamed

Marsuk, and closed the case.

Thereafter, the defence was called, the Appellant gave evidence from the evidence box, and

the other 2 gave dock statements. On behalf of the 2nd accused, two defence witnesses were

called. After the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the Appellant

Page 4 of 16

guilty and acquitted the 2nd and 3rd accused. Against the said judgment, the Appellant has

preferred this appeal.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced the following grounds:

1. Not having a Jury brings an injustice to the accused

2. The evidence of the prosecution shows the vital conviction

3. There is no eyewitness to prove that the Accused had committed the crime

4. The prosecution's evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW-01, Mohamadu Ismail Nazeer, stated that he received information that the Appellant

and his associates were assaulting the deceased. He thereafter proceeded to the scene and

subsequently went to Ashraf Memorial Hospital. The Learned High Court Judge, however,

treated this witness's evidence as inadmissible on the basis that he had not personally

witnessed the assault.

PW-3, Mohamadu Ismail Bazeer, testified that he received a call from PW-5 informing him

that the Appellant and his associates were assaulting the deceased in front of the Appellant’s

boutique. Upon arriving at the scene, he observed Nayeem, Faizer, Rizly, and Faizal present

who are the friends of the Appellant. He then saw the deceased with bleeding injuries and

noted a stone lodged in the leg of the deceased. During the trial, PW-3 further stated that he

had seen the Appellant together with Saleem, Riyal, Fazeel, Farook, and Nisfer (who had

already been acquitted) at the scene, but that they left upon noticing his presence.

During cross-examination, PW-3 admitted that he had not stated in his police statement that

he received a phone call from PW-5 informing him that the 1st Accused and his associates

were assaulting the deceased. He further acknowledged that he had not mentioned the names

of the 2nd and 3rd Accused in his statement, and also conceded that he had not seen the 3rd

Accused at the scene. PW-3 ultimately stated that the names he provided were taken from

the statement given by the deceased to the police.

Page 5 of 16

According to his testimony, although the witness had known the 3rd Accused for five years,

he failed to mention the 3rd Accused by name. Significantly, his evidence was recorded at the

hospital on the 19th. Yet, in that statement, he did not record that the Appellant and his

associates were attacking the deceased. This omission was duly marked, further casting

doubt on the reliability and completeness of his evidence.

PW-5, Ibralebbe Najeem, corroborated the testimony of PW-3. He stated that PW 4 informed

him that the Appellant, together with his associates, was assaulting the deceased. At that

time, Faisal, PW 6, was with him, and the three of them had proceeded to the scene. There,

PW-5 observed the Appellant striking the deceased, while Riyath (2nd Accused) and Aleem

(3rd Accused) were also present. He later testified that all three Accused were attacking the

deceased with their hands. As a result of these blows, the deceased fell to the ground (vide

page 272 of the brief). We note that on the alleged day of the incident, he did not give evidence

to the police.

During the cross-examination, the defence brought to notice that in his statement to the

police, he had stated the following. (vide page 304)

“Further, beef stall Farook had a wooden pole, grandson of lodge keeper Baseel had

an iron rod, and Mason Nazeer had a wooden pole -his name is Aleem, were assaulting.

Further, Azeem from Thaikka Road, who has a quarry, was kicking Dhaskhan”.

Page 6 of 16

It should be noted that on 25th September 2006, the witness provided a statement to the

police, which was recorded by IP Jameel, PW 10, the same officer who had recorded the

deceased’s dying declaration. In his statement, the witness asserted that he had seen the 3rd

Accused attacking the deceased with a stick.

Page 334 of the brief,

Q : I put it to you on behalf of the 3rd accused that the 3rd accused must have been one

among the onlookers but he had not attacked or hit the injured person.

A : No. he did assault.

Q : Who assaulted?

A : Alim

Q : How did he assault?

A : He hit him with a stick.

Q : I put to you that you never mentioned about the 3rd accused hitting the injured

person, during the Examination in Chief.

A : He did not ask about hitting with a stick. Hence, I did not say so but I told that he

assaulted him.

Page 336 of the brief,

Q : You said that the 3rd accused assaulted the injured person.

Page 7 of 16

A : Yes.

Q : Did he assault him with both his hands or with one hand?

A : I did not see whether he and his friends assaulted with one hand or both hands or

with how many hands.

Q : Didn’t you see him whether he hit with one or both hands?

A : No.

Q : I put it to you that therefore you did not see anything.

A : I did see.

Page 347 of the brief,

Q : Witness, during the Cross Examination did you say that all the friends of Jeskhan

were assaulting?

A : Yes.

Q : When you said “all”, who were the people that you were referring to?

A : All those who had been mentioned in the complaint in the Police.

Q : If so, do you remember those who were mentioned in the Police complaint can you

mention their names?

A : Jeskhan, Basheer, Farook, Faseel, Nazaar, Riyath and Saleem

Page 351 of the brief,

Q : Witness, you said that the 3rd accused had been assaulting the Dhaskhan when

you saw.

A : Yes

Q : Who were those who had been in that place?

A : Jeskhan and his friends

Page 8 of 16

The Learned High Court Judge did not take this portion of evidence into account in his

judgment.

PW-4, Mohammadu Mustaq Muhamadu Rizly, who has seen the incident from the beginning

has testified that while he was waiting near a shop at the Pura Dudu junction due to rain,

the deceased arrived there. Shortly thereafter, a three-wheeler arrived carrying the

Appellant and a person called Azim, who immediately began assaulting the deceased. He

further stated that both individuals struck the deceased on the head during the attack.

Page 373 of the brief,

Q : If so, where were you when this incident took place?

A : While I was in that place, two people came in a three-wheeler. They attacked

Dhaskhan on his head and took him away in the three-wheeler

Page 374 of the brief,

Q : You said that two people who came to that place attacked deceased Dhaskhan in

this case and took him in a three-wheeler. Can you say who those people were?

A : Yes.

Q : Who were they?

A : Azeem and Jeskhan.

Q : Are the two people whom you mentioned now, here in this Court?

A : Yes

Q : Where are they?

A : Jeskhan is standing as the 1st person in the dock. The person Azeem is not in the

Court at that moment.

Thereafter, the witness stated that he followed the three-wheeler and observed both the

Appellant and Azim taking the deceased from the vehicle to Thaikka Road, where other

friends of the Appellant continued to attack him. Following this, the witness went and

Page 9 of 16

informed PW-5. Upon returning, he saw the deceased lying on the ground, but he was unable

to identify who had struck him at that stage. On 25th September, the witness made a

statement to the police regarding these events.

During the cross-examination defence has marked an omission.

Page 415 of the brief,

Q : Did you, in your statement to the police say as follows:-

“Grandson of lodge keeper from Kalmuni OPD Road. Faisal and Farook who has a

meat shop in Cassim Road and Aseem from Thaikka Road and mason Naser’s brother

Aleem and the boy working in Jeskhan’s shop were assaulting with iron rods on the

head and legs indiscriminatingly”

Did you say so to the Police?

A : I don’t remember

The witnesses denied having identified several individuals as being involved in the assault

on the deceased, which demonstrates inconsistencies in their testimony.

PW-6, Abdul Cader Faizal, testified that while he was working with PW-5, PW-4 approached

and informed them that the Appellant and his friends were attacking the deceased. They

immediately rushed to the scene, where PW-6 observed the deceased lying on the ground

with injuries. At that point, he saw the Appellant holding a club, while the others present

did not possess any weapons. Thereafter, with the assistance of others, the deceased was

admitted to the hospital.

PW-7, Dr. Arjuna Thilakaratne, who conducted the post-mortem examination, testified that

he identified twenty-six injuries on the body of the deceased. He further stated that the cause

of death was twofold: firstly, an abscess on the left kidney, and secondly, multiple injuries

inflicted by blunt trauma. These injuries facilitated the onset of infection, which ultimately

resulted in septicemia.

Page 10 of 16

According to the evidence of PW 10, Chief Inspector Jemeel, he has recorded the statement

from the deceased and in his statement, he has identified a number of people who assaulted

him. The prosecution marked the dying declaration as P5 and marked as P5 a,b as portions

of the declaration.

During cross-examination, the defence contended that the deceased did not have his left-

hand thumb prior to the incident. The Learned High Court Judge correctly concluded that

the prosecution had failed to dispel the doubt raised by the defence. On this basis, the

Learned Judge declined to accept the purported dying declaration as reliable evidence.

Upon analyzing the evidence presented before the Learned High Court Judge, it becomes

apparent that the following material facts were not taken into consideration.

1. PW-4 testified that the Appellant, together with one Azim, assaulted the deceased.

He further stated that Azim, along with the Appellant, took the deceased to Thaikka

Road and attacked him there. Despite Azim being identified in the initial incident

and implicated in the assault, the investigators failed to question him in connection

with the murder. The evidence indicates that Azim also attacked the deceased.

However, the Learned High Court Judge did not consider this issue, and the

prosecution has offered no explanation as to why Azim was excluded from the

investigation.

2. There is evidence implicating the 2nd and 3rd Accused in the assault on the deceased.

PW-5 categorically testified that he identified all three Accused actively attacking the

deceased. Despite this direct evidence, the Learned High Court Judge acquitted the

2nd and 3rd Accused on the basis that there was no evidence against them.

Page 272 of the brief,

Q : While they were assaulting him, how did they assault him?

A : they hit him with their hands

Q : You said while he was being assaulted, he was screaming. What was he

telling while screaming?

Page 11 of 16

A : He collapsed after he screamed

The Learned High Court Judge made the following observation after evaluating the evidence.

Page 794 of the brief,

“PW - 5 Najeem also has seen the 1st accused hitting the deceased at the

Thaikka Road. However he in his evidence has stated that 2nd accused and 3rd

accused were just standing there and only 1st accused Jeskhan was hitting

the deceased.”

Counsel for the defence brought to the attention of the court that the concept of

divisibility of the credibility dictum refferd by G. P. S. De Silva, J. (as he was then)

in Siriwardena And Another V. The Attorney General 1998, 2 SLR,222 at page 226

as follows,

“Mr. Rohan Jayetilake, senior state counsel, submitted that the verdict of the

jury is not unreasonable because the jury may have found that the "alibi" put

forward by the 4th accused credible whereas, the "alibi" of the appellants

unacceptable. Even so, it seems to me that the moment the jury had a

reasonable doubt as to the truth of Mahipala's evidence implicating the 4th

accused, the jury could not have on the very same evidence acted with

confidence as against the appellants. The doubt in regard to the veracity of

Mahipala's evidence, created by the alibi of the 4th accused, must necessarily

have an impact on the rest of Mahipala's evidence. The principle is that the

testimony of a witness which is identical and which is exactly of the same

weight as against two or more accused persons, cannot be found to be

Page 12 of 16

unacceptable against one accused and acceptable as against the: others. In this

context, the view of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, expressed in

Baksh v. the Queen(1), as regards the indivisibility of the credibility of a witness

is very relevant:

"Their credibility cannot be treated as divisible and accepted against one and

rejected against the other. Their honesty having been shown to be open to

question, it cannot be right to accept their verdict against one and reopen it in

the case of the other. Their Lordships are accordingly of opinion that a new

trial should have been ordered in both cases."

Another case that is relevant is R v. Margulas(2), where the alleged

eyewitnesses claimed to have identified two accused jointly committing the

offence of burglary. The jury convicted the 1st accused and acquitted the 2nd

accused. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction of the 1st

accused on the ground that the evidence against him cannot be considered

sufficient if those against the man whom the jury acquitted "was exactly of the

same weight". As in the present case, in Margulas's case too, no complaint was

made of the summing-up. On the other hand, Mr. Rohan Jayetilake strongly

relied on the case of Francis Appuhamy v. The Queen (3) in an effort to support

the convictions. Senior state counsel referred to that part of the judgment

where T. S. Fernando, J., discussed Baksh v. the Queen (Supra) and the

principle of the indivisibility of the credibility of a witness. Counsel relied

particularly on the following dicta:

"The remark that credibility of witnesses could not be treated as divisible came

to be made in the circumstances related above. We do not think this remark

can be the foundation for a principle that the evidence of a witness must be

accepted completely or not at all. Certainly in this country it is not an

uncommon experience

to find in criminal cases witnesses who, in addition to implicating a person

actually seen by them committing a crime, seek to implicate others who are

Page 13 of 16

either members of the family of that person or enemies of such witnesses. In

that situation, the judge or jurors have to decide for themselves whether that

part of the testimony which is found to be false taints the whole or whether the

false can safely be separated from the true (at page 443)."

In this case, the Crown relied on the evidence of a single eyewitness named

Irene Rodrigo. It was a case of shooting by night and hence the possibility of

mistaken identity could not be discounted. Having referred to Baksh's case, T.

S. Fernando, J. proceeded to state in the course of his judgment:

"In the instant case, in the light of the directions given by the trial judge, it is,

in our opinion, not permissible to infer that the jury considered Irene's evidence

in respect of her identification of the 5th accused to be false. The high

probability is that they concluded she was merely mistaken in regard to the

identity of the fifth man, the man with the pistol . . . References were made

also to the case of Harry Margulas (17 Cr. A.R. 3) and cases which have

purported to follow it. In all those cases, however, the jury on evidence of the

same weight had in the case of one or more of the accused persons returned a

verdict of guilty while acquitting another or others. Such a result would, of

course, be unreasonable: but that is not the position in the instant case where

the distinction drawn by the jury can be shown to be based on sufficient

reason." (The emphasis is mine.)

Thus, it is manifest the learned judge was there dealing with a case where the

facts were entirely different from the facts of the instant case. It is equally

clear that Francis Appuhamy's case has not departed from the principle laid

down in Margulas's case (Supra).

Accordingly, I am of the opinion that Mr. A. A. de Silva's submission that the

verdict of the jury is unreasonable, is entitled to succeed. The appeals of the

2nd and 3rd accused-appellants are allowed, their convictions and sentences

are quashed, and they are acquitted”

Page 14 of 16

In the instant case, we are mindful that the deceased had died due to septicemia due to

multiple injuries caused to him. JMO further testified that the deceased had a septicemia

condition mainly due to fractures and laceration caused to his body, but not due to abrasions

caused to his body. There were several injuries to the body of the deceased. We observe that

JMO has stated that internal contusions could be caused by kicking the abdominal region.

Further, he has stated that there is a fracture in the skull, but he did not observe any such

damage to the arteries that supply blood to the brain of the deceased, and accordingly, the

skull fracture described above could not be a threat to the life of the deceased.

The JMO opined that the death of the deceased was caused by two factors: firstly, an abscess

on the left kidney, and secondly, multiple injuries sustained on his body due to blunt trauma,

which led to the spread of infection and ultimately resulted in septicemia. According to the

testimony of PW‑4, he witnessed the Appellant together with Azim attacking the head of the

deceased. PW‑5, however, did not specify the part of the body where the deceased was

assaulted. PW‑3 stated that the Appellant, along with two others, were hitting the deceased.

Nevertheless, none of the witnesses testified to having seen the deceased being struck in the

abdominal region. This fact was conceded by the prosecution during the argument stage.

In the present case, the Learned High Court Judge accepted the evidence of PW-4 and

concluded that the Appellant was involved in the incident. The evidence establishes that the

Appellant, together with another individual named Azim, assaulted the deceased,

transported him in a three-wheeler, and continued the assault thereafter. At no stage did

PW-4 indicate that the 2nd or 3rd Accused participated in the attack; instead, he specifically

identified Azim as the other assailant. The issue that arises for determination is whether the

conduct of the Appellant , as established by the evidence, falls within the third limb of Section

294 of the Penal Code.

It is relevant to consider the 3d limb of Section 294, which reads as follows:-

Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder

"Firstly - (omitted)

"Secondly - (omitted)

Page 15 of 16

"Thirdly -if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and

the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature

to cause death; "

It is relevant in this case to consider illustration "C" under Section 294. It reads as follows:-

"A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a

man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder,

although he may not have intended to cause Z's death"

According to the evidence presented before the Learned High Court Judge, there is no

indication that the injuries attributed to the Appellant were fatal. The manner in which the

evidence was placed does not clearly establish how the Appellant inflicted the injuries, nor

does it demonstrate that such injuries were intended to cause the death of Mohammadu

Musthapa Thaskhan.

It is acknowledged that the death was caused by septicemia resulting from multiple injuries.

The deceased passed away ten days after being admitted to the hospital. The post-mortem

examination revealed several injuries on the body of the deceased. While the evidence refers

to a head injury inflicted by the Appellant, it is clear that the deceased did not die as a result

of that injury. Moreover, there is no evidence establishing that the injuries attributed to the

Appellant directly caused the death of the deceased.

I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the

Appellant shared the common intention with an unknown person to commit the death of

Mohammadu Musthapa Thaskhan. As I mentioned earlier, the evidence of PW 4 speaks

about a person called Azeem also participated in the attack. But he has not been named as

an accused in this case.

In light of the foregoing evidence, it is my considered view that the Appellant should be

acquitted of the charge of murder. The evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt

that the injuries attributed to the deceased were fatal or intended to cause death. However,

the evidence does demonstrate that the Appellant inflicted grievous injuries upon the

deceased. Accordingly, the Appellant ought to be convicted for the offence of grievous hurt by

attacking with a club, punishable under Section 317 of the Penal Code.

Page 16 of 16

Accordingly, I convict the Appellant under Section 317 of the Penal Code and sentence him

to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000. In addition, I order the

Appellant to pay compensation of Rs. 1,000,000.00 to the deceased.

The substantive term of imprisonment shall commence from 11.08.2017. In default of

payment of the fine, the Appellant shall undergo 1 year of rigorous imprisonment, and in

default of payment of compensation, the Appellant shall undergo 2 years of rigorous

imprisonment, which shall operate from today’s date.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this Judgment to the High Court of

Kalmunai for compliance.

Appeal partly allowed.
