JUDGMENT

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is an application for revision and/or restitution in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the

Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read together with section 753

of the code of Civil Procedure.

The Petition dated 18th of March 2022, was filed by the 8th Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner

(hereinafter will be referred to as the Petitioner) to set aside the judgment dated 28th of

February 1995 by the learned District Court of Matara and the interlocutory decree dated 28th

of February 1995 and the Final Decree dated 21st of February 2000. However, the application

was dismissed by the judgment dated 13th of December 2022 without issuing notice, on the

basis that there was a previous application for appeal preferred with regard to the same

matter, which was subsequently dismissed due to an undue delay of nearly twenty years. By

the initial Petition, the Petitioner has prayed for the following,

“ Issue notices on the Respondents;

Call and examine the record of District Court Matara case No:13865/P;

Grant interim relief restraining the 20 Respondent constructing and using the land

allotted to him until termination of the case;

Grant interim relief restraining DC Matara case13865/P and any allotment allotted to

any Respondent until the termination of this case;

Order trial de Novo;

Act in Revision and or Restitutio in integrum, setting aside the impugned judgement

dated 28/02/1995 the inerlocutory decree dated 21/02/2000 final decree dated

21/02/2000;

Make order that the purported transfer of the allotments by the 24th to 26th

Respondents are void ab initio,

Among other reliefs.

Subsequently the Petitioner has filed another Petition dated 3rd of February 2023, for revision

and/or restitution in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read together with section 753 of the code of Civil Procedure,

to set aside the judgment dated 13th December 2022 of the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the

Petitioner has prayed for the following,

Page 11 of 15

“ To set aside the judgment dated 13.12.2022 revising Your Lordships decision

and may this application be relisted:

fix this matter for objections from the Respondents and counter affidavits of

the 8th Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner and thereafter fix this matter for

argument,

Among other reliefs.”

Having heard the application, this court has revoked the dismissal of the Petitioner’s

application dated 18th of March 2022 and issued notices to the Respondents by the order

dated 27th of June 2023.

Now I will venture into the merits of this application.

The remedy of Restitutio-in-Integrum is an extraordinary remedy granted by the Appellate

Courts under exceptional circumstances when prejudice has been caused to the requesting

party or when a failure of justice has occurred.

The Article 138 of the Constitution by which the jurisdiction for the reliefs of Restitutio in

Integrum and revision reads as follows;

“ (1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in

fact or in law which shall be [committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its

appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance], tribunal or other

institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and

restitution in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

[of which such High Court, Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution may

have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied

on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.(emphasis added)”

N S Bindra, in ‘Interpretation of Statutes’ page 306, explains that,

“A proviso to a section is not independent of the section calling for independent

consideration or construction detached from the construction to be placed on the

Page 12 of 15

main section as it is merely subsidiary to the main section and is to be construed in

the light of the section itself.”

Accordingly, to invoke this extraordinary jurisdiction, it is a sine qua non that either the

rights of a party be prejudiced or there being a failure of justice. As in our law, the

extraordinary circumstances under which the Restitutio application can be entertained is

clearly established in the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd V. Shanmugam and

Others [1995] 1 Sri LR 55;

“Superior courts of this country have held that relief by way of Restitutio in Integrum

in respect of judgments of original courts may be sought where

(a) the judgments have been obtained by fraud, by the production of false evidence. or

nondisclosure of material facts, or where judgment has been obtained by force or

fraud,

(b) Where fresh evidence has cropped up since judgment which was unknown earlier

to the parties relying on it, and fresh evidence which no reasonable diligence could

have helped to disclose earlier,

(c) Where judgments have been pronounced by mistake and decrees entered thereon,

provided of course that it is an error which connotes a reasonable or excusable error.

The remedy could therefore be availed of where an Attorney-at-Law has by mistake

consented to judgment contrary to express instructions of his client, for in such cases

it could be said that there was in reality no consent, but not where the Attorney-at-

Law has been given a general authority to settle or compromise a case.”

Therefore, it is evident that Article 138 can be exercised in the above circumstances or similar

circumstances, where it has caused prejudice to the party seeking the relief or occasioned a

failure of justice. Furthermore, an application in terms of Restituio in integrum under Article

138 of the Constitution, can only be addressed in exceptional circumstances where no other

alternative remedy is available to seek justice.

In Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. V. Shanmugam and Another (1994) 1 SLR 55,

Ranaraja J. held as follows:

“Restitutio in integrum being an extraordinary remedy, it is not to be given for the

mere asking or where there is some other remedy available. It is a remedy which is

Page 13 of 15

granted under exceptional circumstances and the power of court should be most

cautiously and sparingly exercised.”

Hence, it needs to be noted that the remedy of revision and restitutio in integrum can only be

granted in considering the circumstances of the case. With the above in mind, let us look at

the facts and circumstances of the present case.

The plaint dated 14th of July 1987 was filed by the Plaintiffs against the Respondents with

respect to the land described in the plaint named “Ungiammawatta”. The Plaintiffs have

named Petitioner as the 8th Defendant. Therein, the 8th and 9th Defendant together with 1st-7th

Intervening Petitioners have filed their statement of claim dated 10th of September 1989, by

which the 8th and 9th Defendants together with 1st-6th intervening Petitioners claim a share of

2/9 of the entire corpus.

Looking into the statement of claim of the 8th Defendant, it does not move for a dismissal of

the action but rather to partition the land according to their pedigree. Where by, the 8th and 9th

Defendants together with the 1st to 6th intervening Petitioner’s claim 2/9 of the entire Corpus.

Furthermore, there is no dispute over the title or the corpus. As for the pedigree submitted

along with the said statement of claim, there seems to be a dispute on whether the original

owner is “Dionis” or his father. However, it is apparent that the evidence of the Substituted-

Plaintiff was led before the trial Judge on 28th of February 1995 and the 8th Defendant,

presently the Petitioner has not raised any dispute or contest. Therefore, having taken up for

trial without any issues, the trial was concluded.

Consequently, the learned District Court Judge of Matara has pronounced his judgment dated

28th of February 1995, to partition the land amongst the parties, as for the proved pedigree.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 8th Defendant has made an appeal dated 10th of

August 2001, after a lapse of more than 6 years to the Court of Appeal. However, the appeal

was dismissed in 2005.

It is the limited contentions of the Petitioner that the matter has proceeded without the issues

being properly framed, and that the judgment does not contain findings on the dispute they

raised in their Statement of Claim. It must be observed, even though the Petitioner was not in

agreement with the Plaintiffs on certain matters, at the hearing none of those matters were

contested or framed as issues to be determined by the Court. Therefore, it is evident that a

judgment delivered under such circumstances is not required to contain determinations on

Page 14 of 15

issues that were never raised. Accordingly, the contentions of the Petitioner cannot be

sustained.

Furthermore, the section 48(1) of the Partition Act No. 21 of 1977 (as amended) reads as

follows;

“48.(1) Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory decree

entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered under section 36

shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may be preferred therefrom, and in

the case of an interlocutory decree, subject also to the provisions of subsection (4) of

this section, be good and sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right,

share or interest awarded therein to him and be final and conclusive for all purposes

against all persons whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest they have, or claim to

have, to or in the land to which such decree relates and notwithstanding any

omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of title adduced before the court or

the fact that all persons concerned are not parties to the partition action; and the

right, share or interest awarded by any such decree shall be free from all

encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in that decree. ”

Therefore, even as for the Partition Act, the Interlocutory decrees should stand final

notwithstanding any omission or any defects in the procedure.

However, when considering the facts of the case, while the Petitioner’s personal claim

amounts to 2/72, the 8th (Petitioner’s) and the 9th Defendant together with 1st-6th intervening

Petitioners, collectively claim shares amounting to 2/9 of the corpus.

According to the Final Decree dated 28th of February 1995, entered by the learned District

Court Judge of Matara, the corpus has been partitioned in the following manner and the 1st to

6th Intervening Petitioners who are added as 10th to 15th Defendants subsequently.

• 8th Defendant (Petitioner) – 1/24

• 9th Defendant – 1/24

• 10th Defendant (1st Intervening Petitioner) – 1/24

• 11th Defendant (2nd Intervening Petitioner) – 1/24

Page 15 of 15

• 12th Defendant (3rd Intervening Petitioner) – 1/24

• 13th Defendant (4th Intervening Petitioner) – 1/24

• 14th Defendant (5th Intervening Petitioner) – 3/24

• 15th Defendant (6th Intervening Petitioner) – 1/24

Pursuant to the Interlocutory Decree, which was subsequently confirmed by the Final Decree

on 21st of February 2000, the Petitioner has been allotted a one-twenty-fourth (3/72) share of

the entire corpus, while the 8th and 9th Petitioners with 1st-6th intervening Petitioners together

given a share of 30/72. It is clearly evident that the Petitioner has been granted a share

exceeding her claim. Therefore, I do not see that the rights of the 8th Defendant Petitioner is

prejudiced or it has occasioned a failure of justice to her.

After a careful and thorough consideration of all relevant facts presented by the parties, it is

amply evident that the Petitioner has not suffered any prejudice as a result of the partition

process or the subsequent decree.

Moreover, the Petitioner has chosen to pursue this extraordinary legal remedy only after an

undue delay of approximately 29 years from the date of the Judgement. Such a significant

lapse of time undermines the validity of the claim for relief, as it is contrary to principles of

Restitutio in integrum and Revision under Article 138. Therefore, I see no reason to exercise

the extraordinary remedy provided under Article 138 of the Constitution.

Hence, the interim order dated 22nd of September 2023 is vacated and this application for

Restitutio in Integrum is dismissed with a cost of Rs. 25,000 to the 23rd Respondent and

Rs. 25,000 to the original Plaintiff payable by the Petitioner.
