Judgment

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has preferred the

present appeal against the judgment and sentence of the learned High Court Judge

of Polonnaruwa. The appellant was indicted for the murder of K. A. Amila

Samantha (hereinafter referred to as “the deceased”), an offence punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code.

2. The trial against the appellant was conducted before the High Court Judge without

a jury. Seven witnesses testified for the prosecution, while the appellant gave a dock

statement and two witnesses testified for the defence. At the conclusion of the trial,

the learned Judge found the appellant guilty of murder and, accordingly, imposed

the death sentence.

3. The grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant are as follows:

a. The learned High Court Judge has erred in concluding that PW1 and PW2

are eye witnesses of the fact in issue of the instant case;

CA/HCC/0125/2024

3 | P a g e

b. The learned High Court Judge has failed to accurately evaluate the dock

statement of the appellant; and,

c. The learned High Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the

applicability of the special exception of grave and sudden provocation to the

facts of the case.

4. In view of the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant and the defence taken

up by him at the trial, the sole question that arises for determination in this appeal

is whether, on the evidence led at the trial, the appellant ought to have been

convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

5. PW2, Sarath Dissanayake, was the first witness to testify for the prosecution. On

the day of the incident, while he was in his paddy field, he heard a noise resembling

someone shouting. He immediately went in that direction and observed two persons

engaged in a scuffle, identifying one of them as Janaka (PW1). He also saw that the

deceased had fallen on the paddy field. At that moment, Janaka informed him that

a knife was involved and asked him to throw it away, which he did. Thereafter, an

uncle of the deceased arrived at the scene, and the deceased was taken to the hospital

in a three-wheeler.

6. The most vital witness for the prosecution is PW1, Janaka. According to his

evidence, on the day of the incident, while he and the deceased were waiting at a

junction known as “Palama Gava,” the appellant approached them and inquired

about directions to Buddhayaya. They directed the appellant to proceed forward and

followed him for approximately 300 metres. Thereafter, the deceased requested the

appellant to produce his identity card, which the appellant handed over. The

deceased then questioned him further, whereupon the appellant stated that he was

attached to the Sri Lanka Army. The deceased subsequently asked for the appellant’s

leave chit, which was also produced. At that time, both the appellant and the

deceased were standing at the edge of a nearby canal.

7. According to PW1, the appellant suddenly pulled a knife from his bag, causing the

witness to fall into the canal. Thereafter, the appellant chased after the deceased.

When PW1 managed to climb out of the canal, he observed the appellant positioned

CA/HCC/0125/2024

4 | P a g e

over the deceased, pointing the knife at him and warning him not to come closer.

Despite this, PW1 approached the appellant and engaged in a scuffle with him.

8. In the meantime, a person named Sarath arrived at the scene and was able to seize

the knife and throw it away. Thereafter, the deceased was taken to hospital. The

appellant was apprehended and assaulted by those present, following which the

police arrived at the scene and took the appellant into custody.

9. According to the testimony of the Judicial Medical Officer, two stab injuries were

observed on the body of the deceased at the post-mortem examination. Injury No.

1 had penetrated the right ventricle of the heart and was categorised as a necessarily

fatal injury. Injury No. 2 had penetrated the soft tissues and muscles and extended

up to a vertebra.

10. PW9 was the police officer who accompanied Inspector of Police (I.P.) Tilakarathne

to the scene of the crime. Since I.P. Tilakarathne had passed away, PW9 testified

by referring to the notes the Inspector had made. On their way to the scene, they

encountered a group of people escorting the appellant. They arrested the appellant

and then proceeded to the crime scene.

11. According to the evidence, the incident occurred in a paddy field. Officers found a

single-edge knife and recovered a wooden club. Additionally, a black bag was

recovered at the scene; it contained a bottle of weedicide, a passbook, a telephone

charger, a photograph of a woman, Rs. 3,070.00 in cash, and a toothbrush. The

appellant’s service identity card was also handed over to the police by a person at

the scene.

12. At the time the appellant was handed over to the police, the officers observed

swelling on his face and lips, as well as bleeding from two fingers. The appellant

was subsequently admitted to Hingurakkgoda Hospital before being transferred to

Polonnaruwa Hospital, where his statement was recorded.

13. In his dock statement, the appellant stated that after alighting from the bus at

Buddhayaya Junction, he was confronted and questioned by two youths. When he

attempted to walk away, they approached from behind, blocked his path, and

demanded his identity card. The appellant also produced his leave chit upon their

CA/HCC/0125/2024

5 | P a g e

request. When the appellant questioned their identity, the youths assaulted him, and

one of them struck him with a club.

14. When the appellant asked for the return of his leave chit, he was pushed into a

nearby paddy field, where a scuffle ensued with one of the individuals. During the

struggle, his bag was thrown aside, and a knife inside the bag fell out. As the

appellant attempted to grab the knife, the other person also reached for it; in the

ensuing struggle, the appellant’s hand was cut. The appellant maintained that his

actions were committed in self-defense and in an effort to recover his identity card

and leave chit. He further stated that he had no intention to kill anyone.

15. In view of the evidence adduced by both the prosecution and the defence, the

question that needs to be determined by this Court is that whether the incident

amounts to murder, punishable in terms of Section 296 of the Penal Code as

determined by the learned High Court Judge and supported by the learned ASG, or

whether the incident amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder in

terms of Section 294 exception 4 of the Penal Code, punishable in terms of section

297 of the Penal Code.

16. In other words, the point falling for consideration is whether the conviction of the

appellants under Section 294 of the Penal Code is sustainable.

Exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

“Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a

sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender

having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel and unusual manner.

Explanation: It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or

commit the first assault.”

17. When involving the sudden fight exception, certain elements needs to be

established;

i. Sudden fight: the incident must be unexpected and arise suddenly,

without any prior planning.

ii. Absence of pre-meditation: the offender must not have deliberated

or planned the homicide beforehand, the action should occur in the

heat of the moment,

CA/HCC/0125/2024

6 | P a g e

iii. No undue advantage: the offender should not exploit the situation

or have an unfair advantage over the victim, ensuring a degree of

evenness in the confrontation or, iv. The offender should not act in a

cruel or unusual manner.

18. The following authorities provide valuable guidance on the approach to be adopted

by courts in determining the question of culpable homicide.

19. What is provocation is considered by His Lordship Nagalingam S.P.J in K.D.J.

Perera v. The King, 53 NLR 193, at page 201, as follows:

“Under our law, what has to be established by a prisoner who claims the

benefit of exception 1 to section 294 of the Penal Code is : (1) that he was

given provocation, (2) that the provocation was sudden, (3) that the

provocation was grave, (4) that as a result of the provocation given he lost

his powers of self-control, (5) that whilst deprived of the power of self-

control he committed the act that resulted in the death of the victim.”

Further held that: “In the first place, it would be necessary to ascertain

what is meant by provocation. Provocation, according to the dictionary,

would be any annoyance or irritation, and for our purpose it must be defined

as anything that ruffles the temper of a man or incites passion or anger in

him or causes a disturbance of the equanimity of his mind. It may be caused

by any method which would produce any one of the above results-by mere

words which may not amount to abuse or by words of abuse, by a blow with

hands or stick or club or by a pelting of stones or by any other more serious

method of doing personal violence.

20. The Privy Council in Attorney-General v John Perera (54 NLR 265) observed that

“The defence of provocation may arise where a person does intend to kill or inflict

grievous bodily harm but his intention to do so arises from sudden passion involving

loss of self control by reason of provocation” (ibid at p 269). The Privy Council in

the same judgment further held that “In order to reduce the crime from murder to

manslaughter the offender must show first that he was deprived of self control and

CA/HCC/0125/2024

7 | P a g e

secondly that that deprivation was caused by provocation which in the opinion of

the jury was both grave and sudden”. (ibid at p 269).

21. In Muthu Banda v. The Queen, 56 NLR 217, at page 218, it was held that:

“The direction criticized in this appeal is that which expresses the

proposition that in considering whether a particular episode contains the

elements of grave and sudden provocation the jury must apply an objective

test, i.e. whether in the particular case under consideration a reasonable or

average man with the same background and in the same circumstance of

life as the accused would have been provoked into serious retaliation.”

Further held that; “The argument, as I understood it, for the appellant was

that the jury, in considering the reaction of the hypothetical reasonable

man" to the acts of provocation, must not only place him in the

circumstances in which, the accused was placed, but must also invest him

with the personal physical peculiarities of the accused. Learned counsel,

who argued the case for the appellant with great ability, did not, I think,

venture to say that he should be invested with mental or temperamental

qualities which distinguished him from the reasonable man ; for this would

have been directly in conflict with the passage from the recent decision of

this House in Mancini's case which I have cited.”

22. In Samithamby v. The Queen, 75 NLR 49, at page 50, His Lordship H.N.G.

Fernando, C.J. held that;

“In these circumstances, the majority of us considered that in terms of

Exception (1) set out in s. 294 of the Code the attention of the Jury should

have been drawn to the question whether the act of stabbing took place

whilst the accused was deprived of the power of self-control. There was no

doubt an interval of time between the giving of the provocation and the time

of the stabbing, but the provocation given was sudden, in the sense that the

accused must have been taken aback when he realised that his wife wished

him to be dead. The evidence concerning the subsequent period made it

quite probable that in fact the accused all the time suffered under a loss of

self-control. Had this aspect of the matter been presented to the Jury, they

CA/HCC/0125/2024

8 | P a g e

should, in the opinion of the majority of us, have returned the lesser

verdict.”

23. In King vs. Widanalage Lanty, 42 NLR 317, His Lordship Moseley SPJ held that

“The remaining ground of appeal is that the jury were not directed properly

on the matter of a fight before the deceased was stabbed. That is to say, that

it was not brought to the notice of the jury that there was some evidence

upon which, if they believed it, it was open to them to find that the appellant

was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as provided by

exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code. The learned Judge did in fact

put it to the jury that, if they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt by

the evidence for the prosecution, it was clearly their duty to find the

appellant guilty of murder, but that, if they believed the defence, they would

not hesitate to acquit him. No question of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder, he said, arose on his defence. It is a fact that no such defence

was put forward by him or on his behalf. In William Hopper ' the defence,

as in this case, was that of accident. In that case, however, Counsel for the

defence indicated that, if that defence failed, he should hope for a verdict of

manslaughter only. But the Court expressed its view that, even if Counsel

had not contended for a verdict of manslaughter, the Judge was not relieved

of the necessity of giving the jury the opportunity of finding that verdict.

24. In The King v. Bellana Vitanage Eddin Howard C.J. in referring to a defence that

had not been raised nor relied upon at the trial, said that that fact was not in itself

sufficient to relieve the Judge of the duty of putting this alternative to the jury " if

there was any basis for such a finding in the evidence on the record".

25. In Premlal v Attorney-General [2000] 2 SLR 403, the Court of Appeal cited with

approval the following passage from the judgment of Lahore High Court in Jan

Muhammed v Emperor, AIR 1929 – Lahore 861 at page 862 –

“Each case must depend upon its own facts and circumstances. In the

present case, my view is that, in judging the conduct of the accused, one

must not confine himself to the actual moment when the blow, which

ultimately proved to be fatal, was struck, that is to say, one must not take

CA/HCC/0125/2024

9 | P a g e

into consideration only the event which took place immediately before the

fatal blow was struck. We must take into consideration the previous conduct

of the woman. Her evil ways were the common scandal of the village and

must have been known to the husband, causing him extreme mental agony,

shame and humiliation”.

26. In Premalal v Attorney General [2000] 2 SLR 403 Kulatilaka, J held that: “Until the

judgment of Chief Justice H.N.G Fernando in Samithamby v Queen (1) (de Krester,J-

dissenting) our court followed a strict view in applying Exception (1) set out in Section

294 of the Penal Code. Our judges following their counterparts in England interpreted

the phrase “sudden provocation” to mean that provocation should consist of a single act

which occurred immediately before killing so that there was no time for the anger to

cool and the act must have been such that it would have made a reasonable man to react

in the manner as the accused did. Our Courts were reluctant to take into consideration

any special circumstances which manifested in the particular offender’s case”.

Kulatilaka, J. further held that: “Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions

where Courts and juries have taken a more pragmatic view of the mitigatory plea of

provocation. In a series of cases in applying the mitigatory plea of provocation Courts

took into consideration the prior course of relationship between the accused and his

victim”

27. The Indian Supreme Court has laid down in Prabhakar Vithal Gholve v/s The State of

Maharashtra reported in AIR 2016 SC 2292 that if the assault on the deceased could

be said to be on account of the sudden fight without pre-meditation, in heat of passion

and upon a sudden quarrel, conviction of the appellant cannot be sustained under Section

302 and altered to under Section 304 Part-I of IPC. (Sections 302 and 304 of the Indian

Penal Code are in terms similar if not identical to Sections 296 and 293 of the Ceylon

Penal Code.)

28. The Indian Supreme Court has laid down in Prabhakar Vithal Gholve v/s The State of

Maharashtra reported in AIR 2016 SC 2292 that:

if the assault on the deceased could be said to be on account of the sudden

fight without pre-meditation, in heat of passion and upon a sudden quarrel,

conviction of the appellant cannot be sustained under Section 302 and

CA/HCC/0125/2024

10 | P a g e

altered to under Section 304 Part-I of IPC. The help of Exception 4 can be

invoked if death is caused (a) without premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight;

(c) without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel

or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have been with the person killed.

To bring a case within Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must

be found.

29. In Punchi Hewage Samantha alias Mahathun vs AG. S.C. Appeal No. 168/2018

S.C./SPL/LA No.192/2017 decided on 25.07.2025, Justice A. Wengappuli J.

observed:

“In my view, the phrase “… in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

a sudden quarrel”, of the Exception 4 of Section 294 clearly envisages a

situation, which started off perhaps with a mere verbal disagreement or an

argument between rival parties which then takes a violent turn with sudden

escalation of that ‘quarrel’ into a ‘fight’ during which exchange of physical

blows or use of weapons occurs between them, resulting in the fatality in

question. The start of the quarrel and its escalation into a fight must happen

within a short duration of time. The emphasis placed by the Section on the

progressive but sudden escalation of the intensity of the degree of passion

with which the opposing parties acts in a quarrel culminating with the act

or acts that results in the fatality could easily be discerned from the phrase

“… in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. That

seems to be the sequence events that envisaged by the Legislature in

enacting Exception 4 in that form.”

30. In the present case, the evidence discloses that both the deceased and PW1 were

intoxicated at the time of the incident. It was they who stopped the appellant and

questioned him. The evidence further reveals that the deceased took possession of

the appellant’s identity card as well as the leave chit issued to him by the Sri Lanka

Army.

31. PW1 did not witness the act of stabbing. Having fallen into the canal, by the time

he emerged and ran towards the place where the deceased was, the stabbing had

already occurred.

CA/HCC/0125/2024

11 | P a g e

32. The police witness’s testimony establishes that a wooden club was recovered from

the scene. In his dock statement, the appellant stated that he was assaulted with a

club by the deceased. Furthermore, the fact that the appellant’s identity card and

leave chit were taken by the deceased was confirmed by PW1.

33. More importantly, PW1 admitted that he had grabbed the appellant by his shirt

collar when the latter refused to produce his identity card. He also noted that when

the deceased demanded the appellant's leave chit, a heated argument ensued

between them. Moreover, PW1 admitted that it was the deceased who initiated the

fight. He testified as follows:

ප්‍ර : උසාවියට ගියාට පසේ්සේ ඔ්ෙන් සාක්ෂියක්ෂ ගත්තා්න් යම්කිසි ්ෙලාෙක?

…..

Page 87,88

34. Evidently, no prior animosity existed between the deceased and the appellant. The

appellant was a stranger to the village, and it was the deceased who initiated the

encounter by stopping the appellant and demanding his identity card and,

subsequently, his leave chit.

35. It is undisputed that a scuffle occurred during which the deceased sustained injuries.

It is also in evidence that the appellant suffered cut injuries to his fingers. This

CA/HCC/0125/2024

12 | P a g e

circumstance lends support to the defence version that both the deceased and the

appellant were struggling to gain control of the knife.

36. Furthermore, the doctor called by the defence confirmed that the appellant had

sustained cut injuries on his fingers and had also been subjected to an assault. As

evidenced by the testimony of PW1, the deceased had taken possession of the

appellant’s identity card and leave chit when questioning him. In his dock

statement, the appellant stated that he engaged in a scuffle with the deceased in

order to retrieve his identity card and leave chit, as he could not return to the army

camp without them and would have faced punishment for doing so.

37. Nowhere in the evidence of PW1 is it stated that the deceased returned the leave

chit and identity card to the appellant. Accordingly, even if it is presumed that the

appellant was pursuing the deceased up to the paddy field, a reasonable doubt arises

as to whether the purpose of the pursuit was genuinely to recover the identity card

and leave chit, rather than to intentionally stab the deceased.

38. It must be emphasized that the subjective state of mind of an accused at the time of

inflicting a fatal injury is not ordinarily capable of direct proof and can ordinarily

only be inferred from all the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the act.

39. In the present case, the evidence shows that the appellant had no intention of

engaging in any scuffle or confrontation with the deceased and PW1 when he

alighted from the bus at the junction. As admitted by PW1, it was the deceased who

initiated the sequence of events that ultimately led to the stabbing. It is further in

evidence that the appellant attempted to disengage and leave, but was followed by

the deceased and PW1, who demanded his identity card and leave chit.

40. Although the learned trial Judge concluded that the taking of the appellant’s identity

card and leave chit could not, by themselves, be regarded as grave enough to amount

to provocation, such conduct must be assessed in the light of the attendant

circumstances of the case. As stated by the appellant, there was a real likelihood

CA/HCC/0125/2024

13 | P a g e

that he would have been subjected to disciplinary action upon reporting back to

camp without his identity card and leave chit.

41. It was through no fault of the appellant that he was stopped by the deceased and

compelled to produce his identity card and leave chit. As admitted by PW1, both

PW1 and the deceased were intoxicated at the relevant time, and it would therefore

be unrealistic to infer that the questioning of the appellant was carried out in a calm

or restrained manner. PW1 further admitted that it was they who initiated the

confrontation by stopping a person who was merely proceeding along the road.

He testified as follows:

ප්‍ර : ඔෙලා ්ම්ක පා්ර් ගමන් කරන පුද්ගල්යක්ෂ නතර කරලා ඔහු සමඟ

උ : ඔේ සේොමීනී.

Page 93

42. It is also observed that the learned trial Judge’s evaluation of the dock statement

was not carried out in the correct perspective. The learned Judge appears to have

rejected the dock statement solely on the basis of the testimonies of PW1 and PW2,

on the premise that they were eye witnesses to the incident. However, PW1

unequivocally admitted that he did not witness the deceased being stabbed, as the

stabbing had already occurred by the time he emerged from the canal.

Vide page 78

43. PW2 only observed that PW1 was engaged in a scuffle with the appellant but did

not witness how the deceased sustained the fatal injury. Nor did he see the deceased

being chased by the appellant. PW1 admitted that he had held the deceased by the

shirt collar when the latter was reluctant to hand over the identity card and leave

chit.

44. The learned trial Judge refused to accept that a scuffle occurred between the

deceased and the appellant, relying on the evidence of the two eyewitnesses.

However, as demonstrated above, this conclusion is incorrect. Both the testimony

of PW1 and PW2, when properly considered, indicates that a scuffle took place, and

the learned Judge erred in disregarding this crucial aspect of the defence case. In

the impugned judgment it is stated:

විත්තිකරු විත්ති කූඩු්ේ සිට ප්‍රකාශයක්ෂ කරමින් සඳහන් කර සිටි්ේ මරණකරු තමන්්ේ

Vide page 197

45. As noted earlier, the cut injuries sustained by the appellant on his fingers, although

not conclusively established as having been caused during the struggle for the knife,

were corroborated by the evidence of the doctor who testified for the defence. The

doctor stated that such injuries could have been inflicted while the appellant was

attempting to defend himself. This evidence lends support to the appellant’s dock

statement to a certain extent and, in doing so, casts doubt on the credibility of the

evidence of PW1.

46. In Gunasiri and two others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SRI.L.R.39, it was

held inter alia, that:

In evaluating a dock statement the trial Judge must consider the following

principles: (1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon. (2) If the dock

statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the defence must

succeed.

47. Considering the question of evaluation of a dock statement made by an Accused,

Sisira De Abrew, J. in Priyantha Lal Ramanayake vs. Hon. Attorney General [SC

Appeal No. 31/211], (SC Minutes dated 27/01/2020), cited with approval the case

of Queen vs. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, where it was held; 1. If they believe

the unsworn statement, it must be acted upon. 2. If it raises a reasonable doubt in

their minds about the case for the prosecution the defence must succeed. In the

afore-stated case, His Lordship made the following guidelines as to how the

evidence given by an Accused person should be evaluated; 1. If the evidence of the

Accused is believed by court it must be acted upon. 2. If the evidence of the Accused

raises a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, the defence of the Accused must

succeed. 3. If the Court neither rejects nor accepts the evidence of the Accused, the

defence of the Accused must succeed. (Emphasis is mine)

48. The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not suggest that the appellant

intended to, or premeditated, any injury to the deceased. Evidently, the scuffle arose

as a result of the conduct of the deceased and PW1, who admitted that they had

initiated the confrontation. When these facts are considered in their entirety, a

reasonable inference arises that the appellant acted under grave and sudden

provocation.

49. In view of the foregoing analysis, especially when the attendant circumstances of

the prosecution case are considered, it is clear that the appellant did not act with

premeditation or an intention to cause death. The evidence establishes that the

scuffle was initiated by the deceased and PW1, and that the appellant’s actions were

reactionary, arising from grave and sudden provocation and the pressing need to

recover his identity card and leave chit. In these circumstances, the learned trial

Judge erred in convicting the appellant under section 296 of the Penal Code for

murder.

50. Hence, I hereby set aside the death sentence and convict the Appellant for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal Code. I sentence

the Appellant for 10 years rigorous imprisonment commencing from the date of

conviction namely 26.03.2024.

51. Additionally, the appellant is ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000/- with a default

sentence of one year’s simple imprisonment in the event of non-payment. The

appellant is further directed to pay compensation of Rs. 300,000/- to the family of

the deceased. In the event that the compensation is not paid, the appellant shall serve

a default sentence of one year’s simple imprisonment.
