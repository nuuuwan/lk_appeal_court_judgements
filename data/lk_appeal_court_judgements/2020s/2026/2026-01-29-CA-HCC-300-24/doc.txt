JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant), along with two others,

was indicted before the High Court of Ampara for inflicting injuries on Galappaththilage

Buddika Rukmal with a sword on or before 16th November 2008 and thereby committing

the offence of attempted murder punishable under Section 300 read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

It should be noted that at the beginning of the trial, the 2nd and the 3rd Accused pleaded

guilty to the charge and were convicted and imposed 2 years of Rigorous imprisonment

suspended for 10 years and fined Rs. 10,000, with a default sentence of six months’

rigorous imprisonment. Additionally, compensation was ordered to be paid to the victim

of Rs. 100,000 with a default sentence of 1 year's simple imprisonment.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the indictment, and at the trial, the prosecution

presented evidence through 3 witnesses and marked production as P1 and thereafter

closed its case. The Appellant, in his defence, made a dock statement.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by judgment dated

29.10.2024, found the Appellant guilty of the charge and imposed a sentence of 5 years of

rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- and 6 months of rigorous imprisonment

in default. Further, a compensation of Rs. 1,000,000/- was ordered to be paid to the victim;

in default, a term of 2 years of simple imprisonment is imposed.

Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge, the Appellant has preferred an appeal before this Court, articulating the

following grounds in support of their challenge.

1. The learned Trial Judge has failed to properly evaluate the credibility of PW1

and has failed to appreciate that he is unreliable as a witness.

2. The learned Trial Judge has misinterpreted the application of illustration (f) of

section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance pertaining to withholding the evidence of

PW2 by the prosecution, and has failed to grant its benefit to the accused.

3. The learned Trial Judge has failed to properly evaluate the dock statement of

the accused and has rejected the same unduly.

Page 4 of 16

4. The learned Trial Judge has failed to duly consider and the alternative defense

of right of private defence.

5. The sentence imposed on the appellant is excessive and unreasonable

The facts and circumstances of this case are as follows,

PW‑1, Galappaththilage Buddika Rukmal, the victim in this case, stated that on

16.11.2018, at approximately 3.30 p.m., he was returning home with his brother after

consuming beer at a nearby friend’s house. The witness encountered the Appellant, who

was riding a scooter, and according to the witness, he said, “පසේ්සේ බලාගමු.” The witness

testified that the Appellant had known him since childhood. The witness says that a little

later, the Appellant came to his house in a car with the 2nd and 3rd Accused, called PW1

to come out. As the witness opened the door of the house, the Appellant launched a

repeated assault on him with a sword. The witness stated that the Appellant inflicted

injuries on both of his hands, as well as other bodily injuries. Then the witness had fallen

to the ground and further stated that he unsuccessfully tried to defend himself with a

piece of an iron pipe, but received several injuries until he lost consciousness, which he

regained only at the hospital.

During cross-examination, the witness admitted that there had been a dispute between

the Appellant and his aunt, in which he had also become involved. He further stated that

on the alleged day, he questioned the Appellant as to why he had come to his house

seeking him. The witness further stated that the pipe he used for defence was positioned

near the door of his house. The witness also testified that when the Appellant was

shouting from outside the house, he did not step out with the pipe, and that when the

Appellant began attacking, he took hold of the pipe that was near the door.

We note that the majority of the defence’s questions focused on whether the witness was

intoxicated and whether he was the one who initiated the fight by attacking the Appellant.

The Judicial Medical Officer, PW8, Dr Sandaruwan Dul Shri Appuhamy, confirmed that

the victim sustained 17 injuries in total, of which four were classified as grievous hurt.

He clarified that Injury No. 01, a stab wound to the rib cage, was sufficient in the ordinary

course of nature to cause death. The remaining three grievous injuries were defensive cut

wounds on the right hand, resulting in fractures. He further opined that a sharp weapon

may have inflicted the injuries.

During cross-examination, the defence questioned whether the original medical record

indicated that the victim was intoxicated. The witness confirmed this and proceeded to

state as follows.

The witness further stated that while recording the victim’s statement, the victim

mentioned having consumed one strong beer can.

During re-examination, the witness expressed the opinion that the injuries sustained

involved cuts and lacerations extending to internal tissues and even reaching the bones.

He stated that such injuries were caused by the application of considerable force, and

opined that the weapon used must have been a heavy, though not excessively heavy, object

possessing some mass.

PW 3 testified that he was informed of the incident through a 119 call. Together with

other officers, he proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, he questioned the bystanders and

was told that three individuals had attacked the victim. He observed bloodstains in the

Page 6 of 16

front area, a pole approximately two feet in length, and a pair of slippers. The condition

of the ground indicated that a fight had taken place. Subsequently, PC 6247 Balasuriya

recorded the statements of PW 1 and PW 2.

During cross-examination, the witness testified that on 16.11.2018, Officer PC 6247

Balasuriya attempted to obtain a statement from the victim but was unable to do so, as

the officer recorded that the victim was intoxicated.

Upon the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecution, in the Dock statement, the

Appellant stated that while riding his scooter bicycle, he encountered PW1 and PW1’s

brother in front of PW1’s house. He alleged that both were in a highly intoxicated state

and initiated an altercation with him, using obscene language, arising out of a prior

dispute concerning PW1’s aunt. The Appellant further claimed that PW1 then entered the

house, returned with an iron rod, and attempted to assault him, with PW1’s wife following

behind. He stated that he managed to grasp the iron rod to ward off the blow, and while

he and PW1 were struggling over it, PW1’s brother began striking him with a knife. After

being engaged in a brawl with both of them for some time, the Appellant asserted that he

eventually released the iron rod and fled the scene in order to save himself from their

continued attacks with the iron rod and knife.

The main argument advanced by the defence counsel is that the learned High Court Judge

failed to properly consider the contradictions and omissions in the testimony of PW1, as

well as the plea of private defence raised by the Appellant. It is acknowledged that several

contradictions and omissions were, in fact, marked by the defence. Jurisprudence has

established that where such contradictions and omissions go to the root of the case and

relate to material facts, the Court must exercise caution in evaluating the evidence and

be mindful of its impact on the credibility of the witness. On the other hand, witnesses

should not be disbelieved merely on the basis of trivial discrepancies or minor omissions.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to examine such discrepancies in conjunction with the

other material relied upon by the learned counsel for the Appellant.

The following contradictions and omissions were brought to the attention of the Court.

Before I consider the contradictions and omissions, I am mindful of the dictum of D. A.

Desai J in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K. Anthony, reported in Supreme Court

Journal 1984 (2) page 498,

“While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, draw-

backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to

Page 10 of 16

find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness

and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it

unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of

the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or

there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed

by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily

permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the witness

gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of

evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will

have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and

unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject

the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial

details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some details unrelated

to the main incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction

differ with individuals.”

Bandaranaike v. Jagathsena and Others, SC Appeal 58/82, Decided On 12.12.1984, Colin

Thome, J held that;

“When versions of two witnesses do not agree the trial judge has to consider

whether the discrepancy is due to dishonesty or to defective memory or whether

the witness' powers of observation were limited. In weighing the evidence the trial

judge must take into consideration the demeanour of the witness in the witness

box. Was she trying to the best of her ability to speak the truth? The learned

Magistrate had to bear in mind that Kamala was giving evidence eight and a half

months after the incident. Could she be expected to remember every detail of the

incident? She was unable to remember how many papers were taken from the bag.

She made these entries at night. Can she be expected to remember precisely

several months later what shade of blue ink she used? According to her recollection

she used a black coloured (ink) ballpoint pen which was clearly an error. The

learned Magistrate considered all these circumstances and held that Kamala made

a mistake about the number of pens she used as all her attention was focused on

recording the words of the song and not on the implements used for recording it.

This mistake was trivial and did not detract from the fact that Kamala Ranatunga

had recorded the words on P2 and P2A contemporaneously with the singing.”

Page 11 of 16

The above two judgements were considered by His Lordship P. Padman Surasena J (as

he was then) in Agampodi Wijepala de Soyza v OIC Police Station, Ahungalla, SC Appeal

159/2018, Decided On 07.07.2021, he held that,

“In the light of the above conclusions it is my view that the learned High Court

Judge was right when he concluded that the so called discrepancies has not

affected the credibility of the virtual complaint or that the said purported

discrepancies have not created any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

Therefore, I answer all of the aforementioned questions of law in the negative”

Additionally, I am mindful of the following judgements.

Samaraweera V. The Attorney General 1990 (1) SLR, 256 at page 260, P.R.D. Perera, J,

held that

“Where however the maxim set out above is applicable it must be borne in mind

that all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of

skill in observation upon any point or points, exaggeration or mere embroidery or

embellishment must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood. Nor does it apply

to cases of testimony on the same point between different witnesses. (Vide The

Queen v. Julis (1) C. C. A.).”

Veerasamy Sivathasan v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 208/2012, Decided On 15.12.2021,

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J held that;

“one cannot reasonably expect them to provide a picture perfect narrative complete

with all details of what actually happened. Further, it is quite possible that IP

Welagedera did not see the exact manner in which WSI Gamage conducted herself,

particularly as he would have been concentrating on relieving himself from the

grip of the 1st Accused and on preventing the 1st Accused from evading arrest and

fleeing from the scene along with the polysack bag. When ‘participant-witnesses’

as opposed to ‘passive-observer-witnesses’ give evidence regarding an incident that

occurred quite suddenly, it is not humanly possible for their testimonies to mirror

each other.”

Page 12 of 16

I now turn to the contradictions highlighted by the defence. It must be noted that the

evidence was presented after a lapse of 16 years; the incident occurred in 2008, while the

testimony was led in 2024. Most of the contradictions raised by the defence do not strike

at the core of the case. For instance, the first and second contradictions concern whether

beer or liquor was consumed; the third relates to the statement 'ඔහ ොමද යහකෝ බයිසිකහේ

ඵලවන්හන්'; the fourth to 'ඇයි මොව හ ොයන් ආහේ'; and so forth.

I am mindful that on the alleged day, the witness was under the influence of alcohol, and

he himself admitted to having quarreled with the Appellant. The contradictions noted

may well be attributable to defective memory, given that the evidence was led after a

lapse of 18 years. In my view, the Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded that

these discrepancies neither undermine the credibility of PW1 nor cast any doubt upon the

prosecution’s case. It is noted that the witness is a layperson, yet his testimony has been

consistent. We find no basis to discredit his evidence, and the minor discrepancies do not

affect the overall credibility of his evidence.

The next question is whether there is evidence available to consider the action of the

Appellant, where he relied on the plea of private defence, would fall under the general

exception as stated in section 301 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows,

“Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and under such

circumstances, that if he by that act caused death he would be guilty of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to three years or with fine, or with both;

and if hurt is caused to any person by such act, shall be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or

with fine, or with both.

Illustration

A, on grave and sudden provocation, fires a pistol at Z, under such circumstances

that if he thereby caused death he would be guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. A has committed the offence defined in this section.”

According to Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance ‘When a person is accused of any

offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any

of general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso

Page 13 of 16

contained in any part of the same Code,….is upon him, and the court shall presume the

absence of such circumstances’ (emphasis added)

It was admitted that before the incident, PW 1 had met the Appellant, had questioned

him, and there was an altercation between them. At that point, nothing has happened.

Later, Appellant, along with two other people, came in a car and called him out and

attacked him. Was this a sudden fight? PW 1 admitted that prevent the attack, he used

the iron pipe. According to the evidence of JMO, PW 8, the victim has received a number

of injuries, and it has occurred due to a forceful impact.

The question is whether the Appellant was provoked. According to his evidence, the

injuries were not caused by him. It should be noted that he has not received any injuries

from the fight. I am mindful of the dictum of Arjith Pasayat, J, in Subramani v. State of

Tamil Nadu, 2005 AIR SC, Page 1983,

“Only question which needs to be considered is the alleged exercise of right of

private defence. Section 96, IPC provides that nothing is an offence which is done

in the exercise of the right of private defence. The Section does not define the

expression `right of private defence'. It merely indicates that nothing is an offence

which is done in the exercise of such right. Whether in a particular set of

circumstances, a person legitimately acted in the exercise of the right of private

defence is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstances of

each case. No test in the abstract for determining such a question can be laid down.

In determining this question of fact, the Court must consider all the surrounding

circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words that

he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that the right of private defence

was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to consider such a plea. In a

given case the Court can consider it even if the accused has not taken it, if the

same is available to be considered from the material on record. Under Section

105 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short `the Evidence Act'), the burden of

proof is on the accused, who sets up the plea of self-defence, and, in the absence of

proof, it is not possible for the Court to presume the truth of the plea of self-defence.

The Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances. It is for the accused

to place necessary material on record either by himself adducing positive evidence

or by eliciting necessary facts from the witnesses examined for the prosecution. An

accused taking the plea of the right of private defence is not necessarily required

to call evidence; he can establish his plea by reference to circumstances transpiring

Page 14 of 16

from the prosecution evidence itself. The question in such a case would be a

question of assessing the true effect of the prosecution evidence, and not a question

of the accused discharging any burden. Where the right of private defence is

pleaded, the defence must be a reasonable and probable version satisfying the

Court that the harm caused by the accused was necessary for either warding off

the attack or for forestalling the further reasonable apprehension from the side of

the accused. The burden of establishing the plea of self-defence is on the accused

and the burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in

favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record. (See Munshi Ram and

Ors. v. Delhi Administration, AIR (1968) SC 702), State of Gujarat v. Bai Fatima,

AIR (1975) SC 1478, State of U.P. v. Mohd. Musheer Khan, AIR (1977) SC 2226

and Mohinder Pal Jolly v. State of Punjab, AIR (1979) SC 577. Sections

100 to 101 define the extent of the right of private defence of body. If a person has

a right of private defence of body under Section 97, that right extends

under Section 100 to causing death if there is reasonable apprehension that death

or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the assault. The oft quoted

observation of this Court in Salim Zia v. State of U.P., AIR (1979) SC 391), runs as

follows:

"It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self-defence

is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that, while the

prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the accused need

not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a mere

preponderance of probabilities either by laying basis for that plea in the cross-

examination of the prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence evidence...."

The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence beyond

reasonable doubt. It is enough for him to show as in a civil case that the

preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea.”

This concept was further discussed by her Ladyship Chief Justice Dr. Shirani A.

Bandaranayake, in Bandara v. The Attorney General, 2011 (2) SLR 55 at page 61, held

that;

“The necessary requisites that should be satisfied by a person who intends to come

within the Exception 4 were clearly discussed with reference to several decided

cases (Surinder Kumar v. Union Territory Chandigarh (AIR (1989) SC 1094),

Page 15 of 16

Kikar Singh v. State of Rajasthan (AIR (1993) SC 2426) by Ratanlal and Dhirajlal,

(Law of Crimes, 24th Edition, 1998, page 1339) on the basis of Section 300 of the

Indian Penal Code, which section and the Exceptions are identical to section 294

of our Penal Code. Accordingly, in terms of the said section of the Indian Penal

Code, the following requisites must be satisfied:

1. it was a sudden fight;

2. there was no premeditation;

3. the act was committed in a heat of passion; and

4. the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel

manner.

However, as clearly held in Bhagwan Munjaji Pawade (AIR (1979) SC 133) and

State of Himachal Pradesh v. Wazir Chend and Others (AIR (197) SC 315), all the

above conditions must exist in order to invoke this exception.”

Therefore, we have to consider whether there is evidence to show that the injured person

has provoked the Appellant. In the instant case, there was an alteration between the

victim and the Appellant. But later, Appellant came with two other people with a sword

and called the victim to come out and attacked him. The JMO, PW 8, has observed several

injuries on the victim. Those injuries were severe, and they were caused by a pointed

weapon. Out of those injuries the witness classified the Injury No. 01, a stab wound to the

rib cage, as sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

This indicates that the Appellant acted with premeditation in attacking the victim, and

the nature of the injuries demonstrates his cruelty. In our considered view, the Appellant

cannot avail himself of the Exception of provocation.

Other grounds urged by the Appellant were that the sentence imposed by the learned

High Court Judge was severe and excessive. It is true that the other two accused were

given suspended sentences, but they had pleaded guilty at the beginning of the trial. On

the other hand, Appellant has gone to the trial where the Learned High Court judge heard

the evidence and came to the conclusion of how the Appellant attacked the victim.

We are mindful of Section 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, which

reads as follows,

Page 16 of 16

“The High Court may impose any sentence or other penalty prescribed by written

law”

In the instant case, the said sentence or penalty prescribed by written law is found in

Section 300 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows,

“Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and under such

circumstances that if he by that act caused death he would be guilty of murder,

shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any

person by such act, the offender shall be liable to imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable

to fine.”

We hold that the Learned High Court Judge has rightly concluded to impose the sentence

after hearing both parties. We are mindful that the victim sustained fatal injuries.

Therefore, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the sentence imposed by the Learned

High Court Judge.

For the above-mentioned reasons, we are satisfied that the Learned High Court Judge

has correctly come to the conclusion that the prosecution has proven the case beyond a

reasonable doubt.

In this context, we affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed upon the Appellant.

Appeal dismissed.
