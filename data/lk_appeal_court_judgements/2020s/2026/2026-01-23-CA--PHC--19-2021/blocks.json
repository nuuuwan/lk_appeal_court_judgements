The Appellant also complained that claims of long user exceeding thirty years were accepted without cogent corroboration, notwithstanding the fact that the Appellant had acquired the land only in March 2018 and that the alleged obstruction arose thereafter. In addition, it was contended that the Primary Court misapplied evidentiary principles by relying on material said to be irrelevant or insufficiently probative even for a prima facie determination, failed to appreciate that the Respondents had not established prima facie entitlement to a right of access by prescription, necessity, or otherwise, and inadequately considered evidence relating to the existence of an alternative access.",
