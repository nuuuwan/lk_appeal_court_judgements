K. M. S. DISSANAYAKE, J.

The instant appeal arises from an order of the learned High Court Judge of the

Central Province holden at Kandy dated 15.07.2020 made by him in the case

bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT (hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the order’)

wherein, the learned High Court Judge of Kandy had refused to entertain a writ

application preferred to it by the Petitioners-Appellants (hereinafter called and

referred to as ‘the Appellants) praying for a mandate in the nature of writ of

mandamus against the Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter called and referred

to as ‘the Respondents’) directing them to place the Appellants in the salary scale

of MN 7(2006)A in terms of the directions given by the Hon. Governor of the

Central Province.

The facts and circumstances which according to the Appellants, led to the

institution of the writ application bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT in the High Court

of the Central Province holden at Kandy as averred by the Appellants in

paragraph 4 (a) to (i) of their petition of appeal may be set out as follows;

“The Appellants are provincial public servant of the Central Province

governed by the code of Combined Provincial Public Graduate Administrative

CA(PHC)0146/2020

Page 14 of 17

Assistants service of the central Province (constitution for recruitment) approved

by the Governor of the Central Province; that they were not promoted to the Class

1 in terms of the Code of Combined Provincial Public Graduate Administrative

Assistants service of the central Province despite all qualifications in terms of the

said recruitment constitution; that ultimately they were compelled to go for

litigation to obtain their duly entitled promotion and they were promoted to the

class 1 in terms of the code of Combine Provincial Public Graduate

Administrative Assistant Service by the Order of the Case bearing No Writ

33/2012; that in the said case bearing No Writ 33/2012, it has not been prayed

for a salary increments since there was no specific salary scale for the 1st class

officers at the time of filing of the said case; that even though the Appellants were

promoted to the Class 1 in terms of the Combined Provincial Public Graduate

Administrative Assistants service of the central Province, there was no specific

salary scale of the said constitution (constitution for recruitment) at the time of

the Order was given by the Learned High Court in case No Writ 33/2012; that

however, there were instances where some employee of the public service of the

Central Province get higher salary than the Appellants and the said facts were

brought to the notice of the Honorable Governors of the Central Province; that

as a result, all Governors of the Central Province directed to place the Appellants

in MN 07 (2006) A salary scale in terms of the documents marked as P-11, P-12,

P12(1), P-13, P-14; that however, the Public Service Commission of the Central

Province has maliciously neglected to place the Appellants in MN 07 (2006)A

salary scale despite the direction given by Honorable Governors of the Central

Province; that the Appellants further informed Court that the Respondents are

duty bound to give effect to the said directions in terms of section 32(3) of the

Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987.

Hence, the pivotal basis of the writ application bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT, as is

discernible from the matters so averred by the Appellants in their petition of

appeal filed before this Court, as well as in paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17,

18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the petition filed before the High Court of

CA(PHC)0146/2020

Page 15 of 17

Kandy and prayer ‘ආ’ thereto and documents annexed thereto marked as පෙ10,

පෙ10(1), පෙ10(2), පෙ11, පෙ12, පෙ12(1), පෙ13 and පෙ14 being that even though, the

Appellants had been promoted to the Class 1 in terms of the Combined Provincial

Public Graduate Administrative Assistants Service of the Central Province, by

virtue of the order of the High Court of the Central Province holden at Kandy

made in the case bearing No. Writ 33/2012, there was no specific salary scale

for the 1st Class officers stipulated in the Code of Combined Provincial Public

Graduate Administrative Assistants Service of the Central Province (Constitution

for Recruitment) approved by the Governor of the Central Province at the time of

the filing of the said writ application, namely; Writ 33/2012, and in consequence,

Governor of the Central Province had by the letters marked P11, P12, P12(1),

P13 and P14, directed the Public Service Commission of the Central Province to

place the Appellants in the salary scale of MN 07(2006)A but, however, the Public

Service Commission of the Central Province had maliciously, neglected to place

them in the said salary scale despite the direction of the Hon. Governor of the

Central Province notwithstanding Respondents are duty bound to give effect to

said the direction of the Hon. Governor of the Central Province in terms of section

32(3) of the Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987 and in the circumstances, the

Appellants in the writ application bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT are entitled to a

writ of mandamus to compel the Respondents to place them in the said salary

scale applicable to Class 1 of the said service as per the direction of the Hon.

Governor of the Central Province.

On the other hand, the principle relief sought in the said writ application bearing

No. Writ 33/2012 (පෙ6) by the Appellants against the Respondents thereof being

a writ of mandamus directing the Respondent to promote the Petitioners to the

Class 1 in terms of the Combined Provincial Public Graduate Administrative

Assistants Service of the Central Province (Constitution for recruitment) only, as

clearly, manifest upon a careful reading of the order dated 11.09.2015 made by

the learned High Court Judge of Kandy and not to compel the Respondents to

CA(PHC)0146/2020

Page 16 of 17

place them in the said salary scale applicable to Class 1 of the said service as

per the direction of the Hon. Governor of the Central Province .

Hence, the relief sought by the Appellants against the Respondents in the writ

application bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT is totally, different to that of the one

sought by the Appellants against the Respondents in the writ application bearing

No. WRIT 33/2012 and therefore, it cannot in any manner, be said that the same

relief as sought in writ application bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT, namely; a writ of

mandamus to compel the Respondents to place them in the said salary scale

applicable to Class 1 of the said service, had been sought by the Appellants

against the Respondents in the former writ application bearing No. WRIT

33/2012 too, as erroneously, held by the learned High Court Judge of Kandy in

the latter writ application bearing No. 06/2020 WRIT which led him to have

refused to entertain the same.

Hence, it clearly, appears that the learned High Court Judge of Kandy had

proceeded to refuse to entertain the latter writ application bearing No. 06/2020

WRIT due to his total failure to appreciate the real distinction between the former

writ application and the latter with regard to the nature and the scope thereof,

and therefore, on a total misapprehension and/or total misconception that in

the event if the Respondents failed to comply with the order given in the former

writ application bearing No. WRIT 33/2012, that order could be executed against

the Respondents by way of contempt of court, and not by way of a fresh writ

application being instituted before the High Court of Kandy as done by the

Appellants in the instant writ application.

In view of the foregoing, I would hold that the order of the learned High Court

Judge of Kandy which is the subject of the instant appeal, cannot sustain both

in fact and law and as such, it ought not to be permitted to stand both in fact

and law and therefore, it ought to be set aside in limine.

In the result, I would proceed to set aside the order under appeal.

CA(PHC)0146/2020

Page 17 of 17

I would thus, direct the learned High Court Judge of the Central Province holden

at Kandy to hear and determine afresh and anew, the threshold issue, namely;

as to whether notice of the instant application should be granted or not on its

merits, and conclude it as expeditiously, as possible and then, proceed any

further if the circumstances do warrant such a cause, in accordance with the

law.

In the circumstances, I would allow the appeal subject however, without costs

taking into my consideration all the facts and circumstances of the instant

appeal.
