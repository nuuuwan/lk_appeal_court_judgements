As the Grama Niladhari was not present, there was an accusation before the Board seeking further time to call the Grama Niladhari. Proceedings of that date is marked P6. From those proceedings, it is manifest that the petitioner had the knowledge that there was an inquiry before the Board with regard to the possession of the land. Thereafter, the petitioner did not appear before the Board. On 16-05-2017, the Board decided that the debtor in that application was in possession of the land and, therefore, the application could proceed under section 19(A)(1a) of the Ordinance. Thereafter, the 5th respondent gave evidence before the Board, and the Board held that, although on its face it is a transfer, the impugned deed was in reality a mortgage. In that order, the Board has noted that notices under Sections 19A (2) and 19B (1) and (2) were sent to the creditor, and the creditor has not responded. Thereafter, the Board acted under Section 25(1) of the Ordinance. As the creditor did not appear or provide information to the Board, the Board, on 18-09-2018, directed the issuance of a certificate to the debtor under Section 29 of the Ordinance. The Grama Niladhari of the Nawagamuwa South Division reported to the Board that the petitioner had refused to accept the notices and therefore had pasted them on the front door of the petitioner\u2019s house. Since the petitioner had failed to show cause against the grant of a certificate in terms of the Board, the Board issued a certificate. The petitioner made an application under Section 54 of the Ordinance to review the decision of the Board to issue a certificate to the creditor on 15-10-2021.
