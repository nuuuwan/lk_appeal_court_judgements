However, in or around 2005, the officers at Kalmunai Divisional Secretariat used the said land to construct an apartment complex for displaced tsunami victims. It is alleged that on 10.04.2012, the Petitioner filed a complaint at the Kalmunai Divisional Secretariat, and the Divisional Secretary, by letter dated 30.12.2014, recommended the predecessor of the 3rd Respondent to grant an alternative land to the Petitioner.",

Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent identified an alternative land in Thiraimadu in the Divisional Secretariat area of the 1st Respondent, and directed the 1st Respondent to identify a land of 1 acre to be granted to the Petitioner.

It is alleged that his father who was a gramasevake was killed and he himself was shot and wounded in Colombo in the year 2005. As per the submissions it is clear that, at the time of the Petitioner being shot and wounded, he was not residing in the said land. It is also contended that thereafter the Petitioner had been hospitalised and in September 2005 in fear of his life he had migrated to Switzerland. The Petitioner does not disclose whether the permit is an annual permit or long-term permit granted under the LDO. However, it is the contention of the Respondents that the permit had been an annual permit and it had been cancelled. This Court observes that none of the parties have tendered a copy of the permit to this Court. Thus, the Court is not in a position to identify the permit that had been issued to the Petitioner. Further, though the Respondents contend that the said permit had been cancelled, no documents were tendered to establish the said cancellation, nor any material placed to demonstrate that there had been an inquiry before the decision to cancel the said permit.",

At the second meeting held on 14.7.2021, the Respondents had agreed to ask the Petitioner to nominate a close relative to alienate the land and had limited the extent to 20P, subject to a maximum of \u00bdA. The Petitioner states that this decision has been taken on the premise that the Petitioner is not a citizen of this country and hence, is not entitled to obtain state land and also it is contended that the extent has been reduced to 20P. It is his contention that before this decision was taken, he should have been given a hearing. Thus, it is his contention that the said decision is bad in law. For a better understanding, I will now reproduce the said decision contained in P19. Which reads as follows;",

Hence, the said objection is not tenable. The Respondents also raised an objection on the basis that the Petitioner had only an annual permit but had not disclosed the same. I would agree with first part of the objection that the Petitioner has not specified whether the permit he had was an annual permit or a long-term permit. However, in the absence of both parties not tendering a copy of the permit this Court is not in a position to consider whether the said permit is an annual permit or a long-term permit, hence I am not inclined to accept the said objection.

The Respondents contended that when they took the decision depicted in documents marked as P3, P4, P6(a), P6(b), P8, P9 they were unaware of the fact that the Petitioner is a foreign national. However, it is pertinent to note that there is no material submitted to Court as to the exact date the Petitioner became a foreign national or obtained the citizenship of another country. Neither party has addressed this issue with supportive documentary evidence. In my view, if the Respondents were aware of the date that the Petitioner had become a citizen of a foreign country and if it was subsequent to taking the decisions reflected in the above marked documents, then the Respondents should have tendered the said evidence to this Court which they have failed to do. Further, this Court observes that the Petitioner in paragraph 36 has pleaded that he became a Swiss national in the year 2020. However, the above-mentioned documents are dated prior to 2020. Hence, the Respondents\u2019 argument that they would not have taken the decision reflected in the above-mentioned marked documents if they knew the Petitioner to be a foreign national has to fail as all those documents are dated prior to 2020. Further, even the document P12 has been prepared in January 2020 while the Petitioner according to his pleadings admits he became a citizen of Switzerland only in December 2020. Hence, in my view, there is no hindrance for the Respondents to give effect to the decisions taken in P12 as at that time, the Petitioner was a Sri Lanken citizen.",

Further, I observe that P7(a) had been copied to the Petitioner. There was no evidence presented to this Court that he had objected to the proposition of offering him an alternate land in the extent of 20P. Further, the Petitioner had not denied the receipt of P7(a) but had relied on the said document by marking it as a \u201cP\u201d document. Further, it is observed that the document P12 does not contemplate the extent of land the Petitioner should be given. In fact, what the said document states is to make a valuation pertaining to the land that had been given to the Petitioner as per the year 2005 and to offer an alternate piece of land which should correspond with the said value subject to the land parcel not exceeding \u00bdA. In my view, the said decision reflects the extent of land to be tied to the value of the Petitioner\u2019s original land which he possessed by a permit as per the year 2005. Hence, it could be 10P, 20P subject to a maximum of \u00bdA which would correspond to the said value. Hence, as contended by the State Counsel, the Respondents have not refused to comply with the said decision.",

It is also pertinent to note that by P16 and P17 the Commissioner General of Land has not taken a decision or given an order to take disciplinary action against the 1st Respondent. The letter states that the Commissioner General may have to take steps if a party is not willing to comply with the Land Commissioner General\u2019s advice. Further, the said P16 and P17 are communications between the Commissioner General of Land and the 1st Respondent. In my view, the Petitioner has failed to establish the legal right that has been accrued to him to implement the document P16. The document P17 cannot be implemented in view of the decision reflected in P19 as the Land Commissioner himself had been present at the said meeting and had jointly taken the decision reflected in P19. Hence, in my view, the decision to implement P17 within the stipulated time has been vitiated by a committee where the Land Commissioner himself was present.
