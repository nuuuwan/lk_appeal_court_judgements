    "text": "When it comes to judicial review, Court will consider the legality of the impugned decision and whether the respondents have followed the proper procedure laid down by law. The CID sought a warrant against the petitioner and her husband in terms of Section 63 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. An officer has given evidence on oath, and some of the facts stated by the CID are admitted by the petitioner in this application. The petitioner cannot argue that the evidence was false. On the strength of the evidence led before the Learned Magistrate, it was not illegal for the Magistrate to issue a warrant against the petitioner. Therefore, it cannot be argued that the respondents failed to follow the proper procedure or acted arbitrarily. In Jeyasingham v. Jeyasingham [1984] 2SriLR 132, Court stated as follows; There remains for consideration the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that the failure of the learned Judge to record his reasons in writing before the issue of the warrant renders it invalid. He stated that the provisions of the section must be strictly complied with. He also submitted that the failure to record the reasons has deprived this Court of the opportunity of scrutinising the reasons for the issue of the warrant and of ascertaining whether the learned Judge did exercise his discretion properly. No doubt it is necessary that the Court must specify its reasons for the issue of a warrant of arrest against any person, as required by law. But in my view, this will only amount to an irregularity in the exercise of a power which is vested in Court. It is not a jurisdictional defect which would vitiate the subsequent proceedings in Court. The petitioner\u2019s husband was arrested upon arrival in Sri Lanka on 25-07-2022, produced before the Magistrate\u2019s Court, and granted bail on 29-07-2022. Further, he was allowed to travel abroad.",
