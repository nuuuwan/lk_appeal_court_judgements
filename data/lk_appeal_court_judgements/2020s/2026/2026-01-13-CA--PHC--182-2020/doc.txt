Thotawatte, J.

This appeal is against the order dated 27 November 2020 pronounced in favourof the 02nd Party Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to asthe “Respondent”) by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Courtof Uva holden at Monaragala, exercising revisionary jurisdiction under Article154P(3)(b) of the Constitution, whereby the said court affirmed the order dated25 November 2019 delivered by the learned Magistrate of the Magistrate’s Courtof Wellawaya acting as the Primary Court Judge under the provisions of thePrimary Courts’ Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter sometimes referredto as the “PCP Act”).

The proceedings in the Magistrate Court of Wellawaya was initiated by the filingof information dated 27 March 2019 under the PCP Act by the, Officer-In-Charge of the Police Station of Buttala regarding a dispute between the 01st

Party-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Appellant”)and the Respondent over the possession of a land forming a part of an extent ofstate land (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “subject land”) commonlyreferred to as “100 Acres,” situated at Mahagodayaya in Buttala.

The Appellant claims that the subject land was initially possessed, without aformal state permit, by the Respondent and her husband, who allegedlytransferred possession for consideration to a person named Charu Vimukthi in2013. Thereafter, by an agreement dated 04-01-2018, the Appellant claims tohave purchased the land for Rs. 4.5 million and entered into possession. TheAppellant further claims that thereafter the Respondent had forcibly entered theland and started building a house on the subject land, prompting him to make acomplaint to the police.

The Respondent asserts that the subject land was openly and peacefullypossessed and cultivated by her father from about 1981 until 2009, whereupon,following her marriage in 2009, possession devolved to her, and that she hassince remained in continuous and uninterrupted physical possession, cultivatingthe land, residing thereon, and erecting a dwelling house, with such possessionbeing supported by affidavits from neighboring landholders. She further allegesthat it was only from around 2018 that the Appellant began to interfere with herpeaceful possession, culminating in damage being caused to her house on thenight of 24-03-2019, which led her to lodge a police complaint on 25-03-2019.

Learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired into thematter, had come to a finding that the Respondent was in actual, physicalpossession of the land at the time of filing of the information and that theAppellant had failed to establish that he had been dispossessed from thesubject land within the two month period immediately prior to the filing of theinformation, and as such has held that the Respondent should be allowed toremain in possession of the land pending a final determination of rights by acourt of competent jurisdiction.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 25-11-2019, the Appellant invoked therevisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Uva Province holden inMonaragala. By order dated 27-11-2020, the learned High Court Judge declinedto interfere with the impugned order of the learned Magistrate, holding that theAppellant had failed to demonstrate the existence of exceptional groundswarranting the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary jurisdiction in this matter.

Being dissatisfied with the said order of the learned High Court Judge, theAppellant had preferred this instant appeal to this Court seeking to have thesaid orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge setaside.

The order of the learned High Court Judge has been challenged inter alia on theground of failure of the Provincial High Court to properly exercise revisionaryjurisdiction by dismissing the revision application without adequately addressingapparent errors and misdirection in the Magistrate’s order and thereby failing toexercise its supervisory jurisdiction in accordance with law.

It had been submitted by the Appellant that the same Attorney-at-Law whoattested the Respondent’s affidavit as a Commissioner for Oaths subsequentlymarked appearance as counsel in the very same proceedings in which thataffidavit was tendered, and as such an objection had been advanced on thebasis that such conduct contravened the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance, No.9 of 1895 (as amended), and this violation renders the affidavit invalid.

The said affidavit has been submitted as evidence in support of the positiontaken by the Respondent in the primary court (Magistrate Court Wellawaya). Itappears that the learned Magistrate acting as the Judge of the Primary Courthad relied upon the contents of the affidavit in arriving at a determination, thushaving a material impact on the proceedings, favorable to the Respondent.

According to the Learned High Court Judge, the objection was essentiallytechnical in nature and did not warrant intervention. The Judge observed thatSection 66 of the PCP Act operates as a summary and preventive jurisdiction,intended to avert breaches of the peace arising from land related disputes. Inthe High Court Judge’s view, the legislative intention is to maintain stability ofpossession and preserve public order, and should not permit procedural flawsto obstruct that purpose. Therefore, allowing minor technical defects such asirregularities in the attestation of affidavits to hinder the proceedings wouldcontradict the object of the Act and impede its preventive function.

The learned Judge of the High Court has further stated that, in Don AsokaDayarathnev.A.G.Wijerathnaandothers1,theSupremeCourthasdisregarded such technical issues as it is wasting time of court and it is purelyan attempt to study the law and not to provide any solution to parties.

In Don Asoka Dayarathne v. A.G. Wijerathna and others2, the irregularityreferred to was an objection that the Notice of Appeal was invalid, as it had notbeen addressed to the District Court (the original court), but instead appeared tobe addressed to the Civil Appellate High Court, and therefore did not complywith Sections 754(3), 754(4) and 755(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In allowing the appeal in “Don Asoka Dayarathne”, the Supreme Courtproceeded on the basis that the failure to correctly address a Notice of Appeal isa procedural irregularity and not a jurisdictional defect. Where the notice is dulylodged, and the intention to appeal by the party is clear, an appeal should notbe defeated by technicalities that do not cause material disadvantage to theRespondent.

Although the learned Judge of the High Court appears to have relied heavily on“Don Asoka Dayarathne”, the instant matter is regarding the violation of Section12 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance No. 9 of 1895 (as amended) and notwith regard to provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.

Section 12 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance is as follows:

12(1)The Minister of Justice may from time to time appointfit and proper persons to be Commissioners for Oaths.

(2)A Commissioner for Oaths appointed under this Ordinancemay administer any oath or affirmation or take any affidavitfor the purpose of any legal proceedings or otherwise in allcases in which a Justice of the Peace is authorized by law soto do, and in all cases in which an oath, affirmation, oraffidavit is commonly administered or taken before a Justiceof the Peace; and any oath or affirmation or affidavitadministered or taken by a Commissioner for Oaths shall inall legal proceedings and for all other purposes have thesame effect as an oath, affirmation, or affidavit administeredor taken before a Justice of the Peace ; and all enactmentsrelating to oaths, affirmations, and affidavits administered ortaken before a Justice of the Peace shall, with the necessarymodifications, apply thereto:

Provided that a Commissioner for Oaths shall notexercise the powers given by this section in anyproceeding or matter in which he is attorney-at-lawto any of the parties, or in which he is otherwiseinterested.

(3)Every Commissioner before whom any oath or affirmation isadministered, or before whom any affidavit is taken underthis Ordinance, shall state truly in the jurat or attestationat what place and on what date the same was administeredor taken, and shall initial all alterations, erasures, andinterlineations appearing on the face thereof and madebefore the same was so administered or taken.

(emphasis is mine)

Section 12(2) expressly prohibits a Commissioner for Oaths from exercising thatfunction in a proceeding where he or she is:

i) the attorney-at-law for a party, orii) otherwise interested.

This is a mandatory disqualification provision, and in the instant case, there is nodispute as to the fact that the attorney at law who attested the Respondentsaffidavit in her capacity as a commissioner for oaths has appeared in the samecase as the attorney at law for the same party. This strikes at the integrity of theaffidavit and the fairness of the proceeding. In such circumstances, the issuecan rise to the level of a substantive illegality, not a trivial procedural defect.

The learned Judge of the High Court appears to have misdirected himself inconcluding that the alleged irregularity did not constitute an “exceptionalcircumstance” capable of invoking the High Court’s revisionary jurisdiction, orthat it did not invalidate the affidavit relied upon in the inquiry.

Accordingly, this Court holds that the manner in which the learned High CourtJudge dealt with the objection under section 12(2) of the Oaths and AffirmationsOrdinance amounts to a material misdirection in law, thereby bringing thetrustworthiness of the affidavit into question. The commissioner for oaths, ineffect, has become both certifier and advocate. Once statutory disqualificationis established, the attestation is a nullity, and an affidavit founded on a nullitycannot constitute lawful evidentiary material. In proceedings under Section 66 ofthePCPAct,irregularitiesaffectingtheadmissibilityoftheevidentiaryfoundation are not to be treated as inconsequential where they bear upon thevalidity of the affidavit material placed before the Primary Court. The relianceplacedbythelearnedMagistrateuponirregularaffidavitevidencehasundermined the integrity of the adjudicative process and invalidated theresulting order.

The appeal is therefore allowed. The order dated 27-11-2020 of the learned HighCourt Judge of Monaragala, and the order of the learned Primary Court Judge ofWellawaya dated 25-11-2019, are hereby set aside.

Having regard to the preventive character of Section 66 proceedings, and thatthe absence of a valid judicial order may create conditions conducive to a

8

breach of the peace, this Court directs the learned Magistrate of Wellawaya tore-hear the matter afresh upon the filing of valid affidavits by both parties, and toproceed in accordance with law.
