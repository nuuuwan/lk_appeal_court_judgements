It is alleged that the Petitioner\u2019s father thereafter had encroached into lot 41, the adjoining lot and had cultivated the same. On the demise of the father the Petitioner\u2019s mother is alleged to have succeeded to grant P1 and subsequently succeeded by the Petitioner. It is further alleged that the Petitioner\u2019s mother and thereafter the Petitioner too had continued with unauthorized cultivation of the said lot 41. Thereafter, the Petitioner has managed to obtain a permit under section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018LDO\u2019) to a part of lot 41 to the extent of 1A 1R (P7). However, curiously the said permit does not disclose a date. It is alleged that subsequently the 8th Respondent had also been informed to get a further 1.5A of lot 41 (P16). The lot 41 is in the extent of 4A. The receipt of the letter marked as P16 caused the Petitioner to file this writ application.",

Further, as submitted by the Counsel the 8th Respondent had been cultivating a part of lot 41 from the year 2002. This is established by the same farmers organization that has issued document marked by the Petitioner as P9, when they issued a letter marked and tendered as 8R4 to the 8th Respondent confirming his possession and cultivation of 1.5A of land from lot 41. Further, the said letter also states that while the Petitioners mother was alive, she had obtained the manure and given a part to the 8th Respondent for cultivation till her demise. This practice ceased upon the demise of the Petitioner\u2019s mother, after which the Petitioner had discontinued providing manure to the 8th Respondent, which resulted in the 8th Respondent seeking and obtaining fertilizer separately from the same farmer organization. This revelation creates a doubt as to who is in possession of the rest of lot 41 and makes the possession and cultivation of the said lot, a disputed fact. The Petitioner has failed to disclose this material fact for reasons best known to her. In my view, this nondisclosure amounts to a serious suppression of facts and also creates a doubt on the Petitioner\u2019s uberrima fides. It is trite law that when a Petitioner is seeking the prerogative discretionary remedies of writ jurisdiction it is incumbent on the Petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of this court with clean hands. In my view, the Petitioner has failed to do so and I hold, the Petitioner has misrepresented and suppressed material facts from this Court as elaborated above, which disentitles her from obtaining the remedies sought. In coming to this conclusion, I have considered the case of Namunukula Plantations Limited v. Minister of Lands and others (2012) 1 SLR 376 it was, inter alia, held that:",
