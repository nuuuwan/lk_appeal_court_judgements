"unable to comprehend that such an additional condition had been included in"
"the settlement as he was blind. The Petitioner states that the Respondents were"
"aware that the Attorney – at – Law for the Petitioner was making a mistake as"
"that  additional  condition  was  not  a  part  of  the  agreement  reached  by  the"
"parties."
"In the case of Cornelius Perera vs. Leo Perera 62 NLR   413, Basnayake CJ held"
"that on the ground of mistake, a consent order and the judgement based on it"
"can  be  set  aside.  Sansoni  J  held  that  the  proper  remedy 
is  by  way  of  an"
"application for restitutio in integrum. In the case of Halib Abdul Cader Ameer"
"vs. Danny Perera 1998 (2) SLR 321, G.P.S. De Silva CJ held that the District Court"
"has no jurisdiction to set aside a decree entered by consent of parties on the"
"basis of “Justus error” committed by a party in consenting to the terms of the"
"settlements. However, restitutio in integrum can be claimed on the ground of"
"“Justus error” which constitutes reasonable or excusable error. It was also held"
"that the remedy by way of restitutio in integrum is an extra ordinary remedy and"
"is given only under very exceptional circumstances."
"The Petitioner has taken up the position that the settlement pertaining to the"
"additional condition recorded  is  not  in compliance with  the provisions  of  the"
"section 408 of the civil procedure code."
"Section 408 of the civil procedure code reads as follows;"
"408.  If  an  action  be  adjusted  wholly  or  in  part  by  any  lawful  agreement  or"
"compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole or"
"any  part  of 
the  matter  of 
the  action,  such  agreement,  compromise,  or"
"satisfaction shall be notified to the court by motion made in presence of, or on"
"notice  to,  all  the  parties  concerned,  and  the  court  shall  pass  a  decree 
in"
"accordance therewith, so far as it relates to the action, and such decree shall be"
"final, so far as relates to so much of the subject matter of the action as is dealt"
"with by the agreement, compromise, or satisfaction."
"Section 91 of the civil procedure code reads as follows;"
"91. Every application made to the court in the course of an action, incidental"
"thereto, and not a step in the regular procedure, shall be made by motion by the"
"applicant in person or his advocate or proctor, and a memorandum in writing"
"of such motion shall be at the same time delivered to the court."
