"Section  408  of  the  civil  procedure  code  requires  the  parties  to  notify  the"
"agreement,  or  compromise  to  court  by  motion  and  section  91  of  the  code"
"requires that a memorandum in writing of every motion should be delivered to"
"court at the time it is made. The procedure adopted in this case in the District"
"Court at the time the settlement was recorded does not satisfy the requirements"
"of section 408. In his order the learned District Judge has stated as follows;"
"“සෙථ මකාන්මේසි ඇතුළත්ත සෙථ තීන්ු ප්‍රකාශෙක් මෙෝසෙකින් මගානු කළ යුතුයි.”"
"That shows that the written terms of settlement were not before court at the"
"time the settlement was recorded and the parties had not tendered to court a"
"memorandum in writing containing the terms of settlement. Therefore, even if"
"the  consent  given  by  the  counsel  for  the  Plaintiff  Petitioner  to  include  the"
"disputed additional condition into the terms of settlement had not been vitiated"
"by a mistake of fact the consent decree entered in terms of that arrangement"
"will not attract the finality given to the decree passed under section 408 of the"
"code. As stated by Basnayake CJ in Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera 62 NLR 413"
"“Where  a  statute  provides  special  machinery  which  if  resorted  to  renders  a"
"decree final, the finality prescribed in the Act does not attach to a decree unless"
"there is a clear manifestation of a conscious intension of the parties to resort to"
"that machinery with a knowledge of the consequences it involves and there has"
"been a strict compliance with the requirements of the statute.” Parties to this"
"case had not complied with the imperative requirements of section 408 of the"
"civil procedure code and therefore the consent decree entered in the District"
"Court will not attract the finality given to decrees passed under the section 408"
"of the civil procedure code. Therefore, this settlement can be set aside on that"
"ground alone."
"The Roman Dutch Law enables a person to avoid an agreement or settlement"
"for mistake on his part when the mistake is an essential and reasonable one. In"
"the case of Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera cited above Sansoni J states thus “it"
"must be essential in the sense that there was a mistake as to the person with"
"whom he was dealing (error in persona) or as to the nature or subject matter of"
"the  transaction  (error  in  negotio,  error  in  corpore).  A  mistake  is  regard  to"
"incidental matters is not enough. The test of reasonableness is satisfied if the"
"person shows either (1) that the error was induced by the fraudulent or innocent"
"misrepresentation  of  the  other  party,  or  (2)  that  the  other  party  knew,  or  a"
"reasonable person should have known, that a mistake was being made, or (3)"
"that the mistake was, in all the circumstances, excusable (Justus et probabilis"
