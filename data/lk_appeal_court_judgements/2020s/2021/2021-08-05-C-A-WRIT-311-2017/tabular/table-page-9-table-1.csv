"When  considering  all  the  above,  the  decision  of  the  arbitrator  to  pay  the  festival-advance-"
"payments  and  disaster-advance-payments  to  the  2nd  respondent  is  unreasonable.  It  should  not"
"have been ordered to pay. Therefore, we issue a writ of certiorari to quash a part of the award of"
"the 1st respondent. The connected Extra Ordinary Gazette No. 2024/52 dated 23.06.2017 should"
"be amended accordingly by deleting the following words in one before the last paragraph, of the"
"said Gazette as he is not entitled for them."
