"(1),  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case  and  his  reference  dated  15th  April  1968  to  the"
"Labour Tribunal (V) for settlement by arbitration cannot be questioned by the Court, and"
"is a valid decision.”"
"Considering the above-mentioned authority, I decide that the minister's decision under section"
"4 (1), of the Industrial Dispute Act cannot be questioned by this Court, if the arbitrator had acted"
"without violating the rules of natural justice."
"The judgment of the case No. 39933 was delivered on 09.12.2009 acquitting and discharging the"
"2nd  respondent  for  the  reasons  stated  in  the  said  judgment.  The  SLTB  directed  the  inquirer  to"
"restart  the  domestic  inquiry  by  its  letter  dated  15.02.2010.  The  domestic-inquiry-report  was"
"delivered on 21.06.2010."
"The  1st  respondent  has  stated 
in  his  award,  “most  delayed  domestic 
inquiries  commenced"
"thereafter”."
"“ඊට  පසුව  ලංකා  ගමනා  ගමන  මණ්ඩලය  සිදුකර 
ත්තේ  යල්  පැනගිය  විනය  පරීක්ෂණය"
"පැවැත්වීමයි.”"
"The  petitioner’s  grievance  is  that  the  1st  respondent  has  failed  to  consider  the  reason  for  the"
"delay to commence the domestic inquiry. It was due to the pending cases filed by the police. The"
"petitioner  was  unable  to  conduct  the  inquiry  as  per  clause  4.3  of  the  disciplinary  code.  The"
"petitioner  stated  that  the  1st  respondent  had  failed  to  consider  that  while  a  criminal  case  is"
"instituted,  the  general  practice  of  the  Labour  Tribunal 
is  to 
lay  by  the  case  until  the  final"
"determination of the case of the Magistrate’s Court. Clause 4.3 itself permits to hold disciplinary"
"inquiries, if police investigations or court cases are in progress against the employee."
"The  petitioner  further  states  that  this  conclusion  is  baseless  and  incorrect.  Page  No.3  of  the"
"proceedings of 19.03.2015, does not indicate such admission by the witness. The delay in issuing"
"the  charge  sheet  for  two  years  and  four  months  was  due  to  case  B/2808/4    of    Magistrate’s"
"Court, which was instituted by the police during that period. The 1st respondent had ignored and"
"not considered this vital documentary evidence. The 1st respondent had only considered case No."
"39933 in the Magistrate’s Court, in which the 2nd respondent was acquitted and discharged. The"
"1st  respondent  had  wrongly  come  to  the  conclusion  that  SLTB  also  should  discharge  the  2nd"
"respondent from the charges framed against him."
"The  petitioner  argues  that  the  1st  respondent  has  failed  to  consider  the  very  reasons  for  the"
"discharge of the 2nd respondent in both occasions were, purely based on technical grounds and"
"not on any merits. The 1st respondent has failed and ignored to consider that the criminal case"
"B/2808/4 was discharged due to non-filing of the charges by the police and in case No. 39933,"
"the accused was acquitted and discharged due to the failure of the police to prove charges of the"
"Penal Code by not producing essential witnesses."
