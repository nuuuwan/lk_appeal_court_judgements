"accordance  with  any  written  law,  and  includes  possession  or  occupation  by"
"encroachment upon State land.”"
"I
n Namunukula Plantations PLC v. Nimal Punchihewa2, this Court held that:"
"“A  competent  authority  can  have  recourse  to  the  [State  Lands  (Recovery  of"
"Possession)]  Act  to  evict  any  person  who 
is 
in  unauthorized  possession  or"
"occupation  of  State  land  including  possession  or  occupation  by  encroachment"
"upon state land. Any possession or occupation without ‘a valid permit or other"
"written  authority  of  the  State  granted  in  accordance  with  any  written  law’  is"
"unauthorized possession”."
"R
eferring  to  the  definition  of  ‘Unauthorized  possession  or  occupation’,  S.N.  Silva,  J"
"(as  he  was  then)  said 
in 
Ihalapathirana  vs  Urban  Development  Authority  and"
"Others3 that:"
"‘This  definition  is  couched  in  wide  terms  so  that,  in  every  situation  where  a"
"person 
is 
in  possession  or  occupation  of  State 
Land, 
the  possession  or"
"occupation is considered as unauthorised unless such possession or occupation"
"is warranted by a permit or other written authority granted in accordance with"
"any written law.’"
"T
he 
lease  agreement 
‘P26’ 
(and 
‘P32’)  between  the  1st  Petitioner  and  the  1st"
"Respondent expired on 31st December 2017. The 1st Petitioner has not been issued"
"with  a  permit  or  other  written  authority 
in  accordance  with  any  written 
law 
in"
"respect  of  the  said  State 
land, 
for  any  period 
thereafter.  The  possession  and"
"occupation of the said State land by the 1st Petitioner and those claiming under her is"
"therefore  clearly  unauthorised. 
In  the  written  submission  filed  on  behalf  of  the"
"Petitioners, it has been submitted that ‘P32’ is dated 23rd July 2015 and that the five"
"year period would end only on 22nd July 2020. This position is clearly not correct as"
"both  ‘P26’  and  ‘P32’  clearly  provide  that  the  lease  shall  expire  on  31st  December"
"2017. The practice adopted in ‘R4’ and followed in ‘P2’, ‘P26’ and ‘P32’ has been to"
"back date the  starting date of the lease period, at the time of the  execution of the"
