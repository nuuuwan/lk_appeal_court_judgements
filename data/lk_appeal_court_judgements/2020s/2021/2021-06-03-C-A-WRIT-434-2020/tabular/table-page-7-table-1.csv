"held  “where  the  major  facts  are  in  dispute  and  the  legal  result  of  the  facts  is  subject  to"
"controversy  and  it  is  necessary  that  the  questions  should  be  canvassed  in  a  suit  where"
"parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would"
"be better able to judge which version is correct.  Writ will not issue.”"
