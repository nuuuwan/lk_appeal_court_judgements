"the  High -voltage  is defined  as  “High  Voltage  means  a  nominal  voltage  exceeding  33,000"
"Volts”."
"Throughout the submissions of the Counsel for the Petitioner and even in the petition, this"
"Court was informed that the purported line to be drawn is a high-tension electricity line. In"
"the prayer of the petition it is pleaded inter alia “to grant and issue a mandate in the nature"
"of  Writ  of  Certiorari  quashing  the  decision  made  by  the  8th  Respondent  approving  the"
"wayleave for high- tension electrical supply over and or on the Petitioner’s land”."
"Accordingly,  the  objections  taken  on  behalf  of  2nd,  3rd  and  10th  Respondents  pertaining  to"
"suppression of material facts and Uberrima Fides succeeds. As decided in the case of Alponso"
"Appuhamy vs Hettiarachchi 77NLR 131, where the Court held that,"
"“When an application for a prerogative Writ or an injunction is made, it is the duty of the"
"Petitioner to place before the Court, before it issues notice in the first instance, a full and"
"truthful disclosure of all the material facts: the Petitioner must act with uberrima fides”"
"The Petitioner’s 2nd Complaint to this Court was that before the 4th Respondent had given a"
"decision pertaining to the Petitioner’s appeal marked P14 and the 8th Respondent’s letter P15"
"the drawing of the electricity line should not be completed.  However, as per the document"
"marked 1R8 and 1R9 the 4th Respondent has given a decision confirming the 8th Respondent’s"
"decision to draw the electricity lines. The Court observes that the said two letters are copied"
"to the Petitioner. Therefore, the 2nd ground urged by the Petitioner before this Court also fails."
"In  view  of  the  above  two  letters  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  judgment    Ariyadasa"
"Bandarigoda Vs. Ceylon Electricity Board and others bearing case no CA WRIT Application"
"444/11 cited by the Petitioner’s Counsel has no application to the instant case. This Court also"
"observes that as per P5 the way leave notice, the proposed electricity line is to be drawn along"
"the boundary of the road and what has been approved is the said proposal, with a minimum"
"damage to the Petitioner’s Land.  This Court also has considered the Documents 1R2 – 1R3e"
"which shows the Northern Boundary of the Petitioner."
