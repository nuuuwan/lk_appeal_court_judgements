"Therefore, considering the evidence  adduced before Court,  there"
"is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  evidence  of  PW1  who  identified  the"
"accused at the identification parade should be disbelieved. It is also not"
"established that she has seen either the accused or his photograph prior"
"to the identification parade as suggested by the counsel for the accused."
"Considering all of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the"
"evidence of  PW 01 has clearly established without a doubt, the identity"
"of the accused. Therefore, the learned trial judges’ conclusion that the"
"witness’  evidence that she identified the accused can be believed, even"
"though the identification parade was held almost an year later after the"
"alleged incident. Thus, the argument of the learned President’s Counsel"
"that the accused was not identified by the witness is not tenable."
"With  regard  to  the  cause  of  death  the  argument  for  the  defense"
"was  on  the  basis  that  the  cause  of  death  should  be  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt and as per the evidence of PW 7 Dr Jayasena in page"
"82  of  the  brief,  the  medical  evidence  refers  to  two  possible  causes  of"
"death as the deceased was suffering from a heart ailment and thus, a"
"doubt is created whether a charge of murder could be sustained."
"It is correct that PW 7 has mentioned bleeding which would have"
"been  caused  by  injury  by  a  weapon  with  a  sharp  edge  and  that  the"
"weakness  of  the  heart  and  lung  along  with  excessive  bleeding  could"
"have contributed to the death."
