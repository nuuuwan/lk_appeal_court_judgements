"Sabha.  However, in the answer, he had not pleaded regarding rent being paid. Therefore,"
"the learned District Judge's observation that Defendant took several causes of actions that"
"are not compatible with one another can be accepted."
"Perusing the document marked [P4] indicate that entire land [Lot 1 and 2] was transferred"
"to Sayed Shibdeen in 1981.  Therefore, the pedigree shown by Plaintiff runs uninterrupted."
"Even  though  Defendant  claims  the  property  on  deed  V1  Defendant  failed  to  prove  the"
"continuity of title., there is a vacuum in the pedigree. It was the duty of Defendant to prove"
"that Meera Lebee died without executing deed P4. However, in perusing the document, it is"
"evident that Seyed Aaaas had no title to transfer when signing V1. He should prove that"
"Abbas had a clear title to transfer at the time of executing V1. Therefore the question of"
"prior registration need not be discussed."
"The learned Judge observed that Meera Lebbe had enjoyed lots 1and 2 described in case"
"No: 5365|p when making P4 the perchers 33 was not separately described but shown as one"
"land. Therefore, the observations of the learned District Judge need not be disturbed."
"The last ground of appeal of Defendant is that Plaintiff acts as a Power of Attorney holder."
"Therefore the Plaint is bad in law Plaintiff should file the case as an attorney and not as the"
"owner.  If  this  was  not  an  afterthought  as  a  ground  of  appeal,  the  fact  Plaintiff  had  no"
"statuesque to file the Plaint should have been an issue at the district court."
"For reasons given above, I affirm the judgment entered in this case by the learned District"
"Judge. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed subject to taxed costs."
