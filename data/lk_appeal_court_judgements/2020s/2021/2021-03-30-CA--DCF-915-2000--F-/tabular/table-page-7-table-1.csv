"Appellants that they have acquired prescriptive title to the said land."
"The Appellants stated that the Learned Trial Judge has not properly evaluated and considered"
"these  items  of  evidence  when  arriving  at  his  findings.  In  the  above  circumstances,  it  was"

"recitals in the deeds, the Plaintiff has discharged his evidentiary burden."
"Further,  the  Plaintiff  has  led  the  evidence  of  the  previous  owner  of  the  land  who  in  no"
"uncertain terms testified that;"
