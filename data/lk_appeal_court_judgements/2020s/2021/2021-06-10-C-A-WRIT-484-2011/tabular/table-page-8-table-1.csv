"named in the said application to appear and to show cause as to why he should not"
"be ejected from the land as prayed for in the application for ejectment."
"T
he scope of the Inquiry that is held by the Magistrate is narrow. While Section 9(2)"
"precludes the Magistrate from calling any evidence from the competent authority in"
"support of his application under Section 5,  the defences that could be taken up by a"
"person against whom an application has been filed for ejectment are limited to those"
"set out in Section 9(1) of the Act, namely that he is in possession or occupation of the"
"land  upon  a  valid  permit  or  other  written  authority  of 
the  State  granted 
in"
"accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not"
"revoked  or  otherwise 
rendered 
invalid.  A  person  against  whom  an  Order  of"
"ejectment  has  been 
issued,  has  an  opportunity  to  vindicate  his/her  title  under"
"Section 12 of the Act."
"T
herefore, it is clear that the process which is triggered by the Competent Authority’s"
"opinion, 
leading 
to 
the 
issuance  of 
the  quit  notice 
can  have 
far 
reaching"
"consequences on one's proprietary rights and therefore must be placed under strict"
"scrutiny of Courts.6"
"I
 shall now consider the two principal arguments of the learned President’s Counsel"
"for the Petitioner."
"T
he first argument relates to the quit notice ‘X8’. In terms of Section 3(4), every quit"
"notice  shall  be 
in  accordance  with  Form 
‘A’  of  the  Act, 
in  terms  of  which  the"
"Competent Authority is required to describe the land and state the situation of the"
"land in a schedule to the said quit notice."
"T
he schedule to ‘X8’ reads as follows:"
"“uOHu  m,df;a  kqjrt<sh  osia;%slAlfha  j,mfka  m%dfoaYsh  wdodhus  ks<Odrs  fldgsGdYfha"
