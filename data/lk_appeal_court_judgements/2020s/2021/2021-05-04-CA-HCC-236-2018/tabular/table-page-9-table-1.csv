"The first to three grounds of appeal above focuses on the failure of the learned"
"judge to consider that there is no evidence elicited from Hashima   by the prosecution"
"regarding her alleged introduction  of  the appellant to the complainant and her direct"
"involvement which culminated  in this action."
"The learned  President’s Counsel appearing for the appellant contended  that as"
"the prosecution  failed to lead the evidence of witness Hashima (PW 5) to elicit evidence"
"on  the  conversation    she  is  alleged  to  have  had  with  the  complainant,  it  is  hearsay"
"evidence and not admissible."
"I
t  was  contended  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the  evidence  pertaining  to"
"Hashima’ s alleged conversation with the complainant was allowed by the learned trial"
"judge after it was informed that she was a witness. Thereafter a large volume of evidence"
"that  would  not  have  been  admissible  if  Hashima  was  not  a  witness  had  been  led."
"However PW 5 has not been questioned on the conversation she was alleged to have"
"had  with  the complainant and as a result prejudice was caused  to the appellant  and"
"that the learned trial Judge failed to  consider that issue."
"T
he evidence elicited from PW 1 transpires that PW 5 has played an important"
"role in the entire transaction. Even on the date of the raid she is said to have  been in"
"contact with  PW  1  passing on  messages  about  the arrival  of  the  appellant    and  with"
"regard to the payment of money."
"F
or whatever reason this evidence was not elicited from PW 5 to corroborate the"
"evidence of PW 1. It stands to reason therefore, as the learned DSG has admitted, that"
"the evidence of PW 1, on what was communicated by   PW 5  was hearsay evidence."
"Nevertheless, it appears that PW 1 on what he perceived from the said communication"
"had taken action to inform the Bribery Commission and pursued with the information"
"he gathered, which evidence is admissible."
