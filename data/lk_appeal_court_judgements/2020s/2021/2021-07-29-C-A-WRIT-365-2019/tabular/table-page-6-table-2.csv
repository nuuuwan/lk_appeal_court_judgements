"question  and  has  completely  misdirected  itself  on  that  point  and"
"made that the basis of its decision, provided that the error appears"
"on the face of the award.’’(at page 261)"
"On  the  other  hand,  if  the  said  decision  that  is  reflected  in  the  letter"
"marked P16 is not being considered as a mistake of law, the same could"
"be considered as an arbitrary decision since the Respondents have failed"
"to  provide  sufficient  reasons  to 
justify  their  decision.  In  the  cases  of"
"Rathnayake Vs. Commissioner General of Excise and Others 2004 (1) SLR"
"115  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  held  that  the  arbitrary,  capricious  and"
"unreasonable nature of an administrative decision is a ground for judicial"
"review."
"In  view  of  the  above-mentioned  grounds, 
I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"decision 
reflected 
in 
the  document  marked  P16 
is  ultra  vires  and"
"therefore, that the Petitioners are entitled to the reliefs as prayed for in"
"the paragraphs (g) and (h) of the prayer of the Petition dated 06.03.2020."
"The  other  grievance  of  the  Petitioners 
is  that  the  Respondents  have"
"refrained  from  issuing  an  application  form  to  the  1st  Petitioner  to  apply"
"for a FL-4 liquor license. By a letter dated 06.11.2019 marked as  P27,  a"
"claim on behalf of the 1st Petitioner has been made to the 1st Respondent"
"for 
issuance  of  such  an  application 
form.  The 
receipt  of 
the  said"
"document  P27  has  been  admitted  by  the  1st 
to  4th  and  7th 
to  9th"
"Respondents.  However,  the  Respondents  have  failed  to  respond  to  the"
"said demand marked P27."
