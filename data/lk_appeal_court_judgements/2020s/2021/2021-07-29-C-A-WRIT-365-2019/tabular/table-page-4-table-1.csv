"In consequent to the change of Government in the year 2001, by a letter"
"dated  08.02.2002,  the  1st  Petitioner  had  made  an  appeal  to  the  then"
"Secretary  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  requesting  for  a  liquor  license  to"
"operate the said Danovita Wine Stores. However, no meaningful step had"
"been  taken  to  facilitate  the  appeal  of  the  1st  Petitioner.  Thereafter,  the"
"Attorney-at-Law of the 1st Petitioner by the letter dated 12.08.2008, has"
"made  a  request 
to 
the  1st  Respondent  requesting  him 
to 
issue  an"
"application  to  the  1st  Petitioner  in  order  to  obtain  a  FL-4  liquor  license."
"However, the said request has not been accommodated. Nevertheless, it"
"is observed that the Petitioner has failed to produce before this Court the"
"said  letters  dated  12.08.2008  and  03.02.2008  referred  to  as  P8(a)and"
"P8(b) in the Petition dated 06.03.2020."
"Subsequently  a 
request  was  made  by 
the  1st  Petitioner 
to 
the  5th"
"Respondent  pertaining 
to  his  deprivation  of 
the 
liquor 
license  and"
"accordings 
the  5th  Respondent  had  directed 
the  1st  Respondent 
to"
"forward  a 
report 
in 
that 
regard.  Upon  holding  an 
inquiry, 
the  1st"
"Respondent  by  his  letter  dated  31.08.2018  (P16)  had  informed  the  1st"
"Petitioner that in view of the existing provisions of the Excise Regulations"
"and  the policy decisions  applicable,  the  FL-4  liquor  license pertaining  to"
"the Danovita Wine Stores cannot be issued to the 1st Petitioner as 5 years"
"have lapsed  since  the  last  renewal  of  the  liquor  license  in  issue.  The  1st"
"Petitioner states that he has still failed to find out any regulation or policy"
"decision  as  referred  to 
in  P16.  Despite,  several  strenuous  attempts"
"(including an application made under the Right to Information Act to the"
"Line  Ministry  to  the  Excise  Department)  made  to  ascertain  the  relevant"
"Excise  Regulation  or  the  policy  decision 
that 
is  alleged 
in  P16,  the"
"Petitioner states that he was reliably informed that there  exists no such"
"regulation or rule in force under the provisions of the Excise Ordinance or"
"any lawful policy decision which prohibits the renewal or re-issuance of a"
"liquor license where 5 years had lapsed since the last renewal of a liquor"
"license.  Therefore,  the  Petitioner’s  contention  is  that  1st  Respondent’s"
"aforementioned  decision 
is  a 
clear  unreasonable  deprivation  of  a"
"proprietary  right  of  the  1st  Petitioner’s  entitlement  to  obtain  the  liquor"
"license."
"Thereafter  the  1st  Petitioner  had  made  a  claim  to  the  1st  Respondent"
"demanding for an application form in order to obtain a fresh FL-4 liquor"
"license by his letter dated 06.11.2019 to which the 1st Respondent failed"
"to respond. In view of the above  circumstances, the Petitioners by their"
