"both parties presented their case. At the inquiry, Attorneys-at-Law had represented both parties"
"and evidence had been let and  cross-examined the witnesses. After a full  inquiry, the three"
"members of the board had pronounced their order with reasons. To which the Petitioner had"
"sought to file an application to reconsider."
"A
fter  considering,  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board  members  had  decided  that  since  they  have"
"already  considered  and  reasoned  out,  there  is  no  reason  to  reconsider.  Even  though  the"
"petitioner argues for setting aside these orders, he failed to reason out any valid reason why"
"that should be done. Unless the petitioner can satisfy this court as to any fault of the members"
"of the Debt Conciliation Board or any reasons to believe that an injustice had happened to the"
"Petitioner, this  court should not  disturb a decision taken after  a lengthy inquiry where both"
"parties had been represented by Attorneys-at-Law."
"T
he Petitioner set out that he had tried to amend his petition, which the Board rejected. Once"
"the Petitioner abandons his application to amend and face the inquiry, he has no legal status to"
"seek a retrial on the abandoned amended application. When rejecting the so-called application"
"to amend, the petitioner should have asked for the writ he is asking for now."
"A
s the Petitioner had been sleeping  and not  been vigilant  on his case, this  court is  not in  a"
"position to make any order regarding the petitioner's application. On these grounds, I reject the"
"petition of the Petitioner."
