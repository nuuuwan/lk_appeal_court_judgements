act  in  the  police  statement.  Further,  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  says  that  the"
"appellant had given false evidence from the beginning and had not proved her"
"innocence  (3rd  paragraph  of  Page  37  of  the  judgment).  All  these  observations"
"are  made  with  regard 
to 
the  appellant's  evidence  and  not  regarding 
the"
"evidence of the prosecution."
"T
he  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  completely  misdirected  regarding  the  burden  of"
"proof in a criminal case."
"T
he  burden  of  proof 
in  a  criminal  case 
is  described 
in  Law  of  Evidence"
"Woodroffe and Amir Ali 20th edition Vol 3.  Page 3292 and 3294 are as follows:"
"'
It is well settled that the onus is on the prosecution to prove its case to the hilt"
"and it is not necessary for the defence to prove its case with the same rigour as"
"the  prosecution  is  required  to  prove  its  case.    It  is  sufficient  if  the  defence"
"succeeds  in  throwing  a  reasonable  doubt  on  the  prosecution  case,  that  is"
"sufficient  to  enable  a  court  to  reject  prosecution  version.    In  that  case,  the"
"accused  persons  are  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  doubt.    It  is  a  well  settled"
"principle  of 
law 
that 
the  accused  persons  are  under  no  obligation 
to"
"substantiate their defence version."
"I
t is the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that when an accused"
"is  put  up  for  trial,  the  burden  to  prove  the  offence  to  the  hilt  by  legal  and"
"cogent  evidence  remains  on 
the  prosecution  which  never  shifts.  Only 
in"
"exceptional cases where a special defence or plea is raised by the accused, the"
"burden 
is 
to  be  discharged  by  him 
either  by 
leading 
evidence  or  by"
"demonstrating from the record that such special defence is made out."
