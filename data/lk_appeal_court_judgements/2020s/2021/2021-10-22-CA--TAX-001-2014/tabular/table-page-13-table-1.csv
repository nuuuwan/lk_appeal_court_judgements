"The  principle  as  decided  by 
the  Court  of  Justice  of 
the  European"
"Communities, that where a trader supplies goods for a stated consideration,"
"but  under  a  sales  promotion  arrangement  was  obliged  to  pay  an  amount"
"away to the ultimate consumer or to an intermediary in the chain of supply,"
"the consideration on which the trader should finally be liable to VAT was"
"to be reduced by the amount so paid away, is applicable to the instant case."
"It is true that what was paid out was in the form of a coupon rather than"
"money, but that did not change the result in Elida Gibbs."
"Under the principle of neutrality, a trader should not be charged VAT on"
"an amount greater than the true proceeds to him of the supply transaction,"
"or  an  amount  greater  than  the  true  cost  of  the  supply  to  the  ultimate"
"customer. If the terms of the supply provide for circumstances where the"
"trader, having received a consideration for it in the first instance, was later"
"obliged 
to  part  with  an  amount  related 
in  some  way 
to 
the  supply"
"transaction, the true proceeds of the supply must be determined after taking"
"account of what the trader had to part with."
"It  must  be  noted  that  unlike  the  laws  applicable  to  Elida  Gibbs  (where"
"Article 11 (A) (1) (a) read with Article 11 (C) (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC"
"of the Council of the European Communities makes express provision for"
"the reduction of the taxable value of supply, after the time of supply), the"
"Sri Lankan VAT Act does not make such express provision. However, the"
"principle of neutrality has general applicability, and has been given effect"
"by this very Court through the aforementioned judgement of His Lordship"
"Sriskandarajah J. in Oriflame."
"The facts of Oriflame, in so far as they are relevant to the present appeal,"
"are as follows. Oriflame products were not sold on the wholesale or retail"
"market. Those products could only be purchased from persons identified"
"as  ‘beauty  consultants’.  They  collected  orders  from  their  customers  and"
"placed their order with Oriflame each month. Oriflame sold its products to"
"these  beauty  consultants  at  a  price  30%  below 
the  catalogue  price,"
"constituting  the  first  discount  (comparable  to  the  trade  discount  in  the"
"instant  appeal).  Other  than  this  discount  granted  at  the  time  of  sale,  the"
"beauty consultants were also given a performance discount based on the"
"quantity  of  purchases  made  in  a  particular  month,  which  constituted  the"
"second  discount.  An  important  distinction  to  be  made  with  the  instant"
"appeal 
is 
that  Oriflame 
issued 
invoices  only  when  both  applicable"
"discounts had been determined."
