"However,  there  is  no  evidence  before  this  Court  (nor  was  any  such"
"evidence lead before either the CGIR or the TAC) to establish that such a"
"benefit was not granted to the final consumer. It is the role of the Assessors"
"to pursue this reduction in VAT at subsequent stages of the VAT chain,"
"and to bring to the attention of the DIR any irregularities that arise due to"
"any parties not adjusting their VAT liability in order to reflect the initial"
"reduction.  This  Court  cannot  deny  the  Appellant  its  VAT  credit  merely"
"because certain parties may abuse the process at subsequent stages of its"
"VAT chain."
"Since the matter in issue concerns the adjustment of input and output taxes"
"of  the  Appellant  and  its  immediate  customers,  the  basis  on  which  the"
"Appellant’s  customers  made  their  sales  have  no  relevance  to  the  open"
"market value of the particular transaction."
"I therefore answer the seventh question of law in the affirmative and the"
"eighth question of law in the negative."
"9.  Did the Commission misdirect itself in law in failing to apply or consider"
"the interpretation of Section 25(1) of the VAT Act by the Department of"
"Inland Revenue itself in the “Manual of Value Added Tax Law (Revised"
"Edition – 2007)”?"
