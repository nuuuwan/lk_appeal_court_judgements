"Senior State Counsel advocates, the Legislature would have to have used"
"the  word  ‘each’  in  the  proviso  to  subsection  (1),  in  order  to  introduce  a"
"requirement of exclusivity, so that it reads:"
"‘Provided however, the adjustment in respect of input tax under"
"claimed on an each original tax invoice shall be made in respect"
"of a tax debit note or a tax credit note issued not later than six"
"months after the issue of the original tax invoice, to which the"
"tax  debit  note  or  the  tax  credit  note  relates  (original  struck-"
"through, alteration in bold).’."
