"on a technicality whereby Form 8 of the VAT Rules had a specific field"
"under which discounts had to be mentioned at the time of sale, which the"
"Court interpreted restrictively to hold that where such discounts had not"
"been mentioned in the invoice, they were to be disallowed:"
"“Explanation specifically clarifies that any discount on the price allowed"
"in respect of any sale if shown separately has to be excluded."
"(…)"
"In  other  words  the  meaning  and  scope  of  provisions  before  and  after"
"amendment are that no dealer is entitled to deduction of discount unless it"
"is separately shown in the tax invoice and the price collected is net of the"
"discount (emphasis added).”.13"
"It  is  clear  that  the  Court  has  placed  emphasis  on  the  clause  “if  shown"
"separately” to mean that where it was not so shown, discounts could not"
"be allowed. Neither our VAT Act nor the 2007 VAT Manual has such a"
"provision to show discounts at the time of sale."
"Secondly, this Indian precedent was set aside in the subsequent Supreme"
"Court decision in the conjoined cases of M/s IFB Industries Ltd. v. State of"
"Kerala  and  India  Cements  Ltd.  v.  The  Assistant  Commissioner  and"
"Others,14 where it was held that post-sale discounts were indeed deductible"
"from the taxable turnover, and that therefore, the above restrictive reading"
"of the law by the Kerala High Court could not be allowed to stand."
"Finally, it is important to note that the Supreme Court of India decided as"
"above  even  though  on  a  strict  reading  of  the  law,  the  provision  that"
"expressly  allowed  discounts  at  the  time  of  sale  could  be  interpreted  to"
"exclude performance-based post-sale discounts. In my view, not even on"
"such a strict interpretation could post-sale discounts be disallowed under"
"the  provisions  of  the  Sri  Lankan  VAT  Act,  since  there  is  no  specific"
"allowance for discounts at the time of sale (which could then be interpreted"
"strictly to exclude post-sale discounts), and the Assessor has still allowed"
"them. Having so allowed trade discounts without any express provision for"
"them, the State cannot rely on the above decision of the Kerala High Court"
"to then deny post-sale discounts."
