"going days. The 01st accused had come to his house as well. Chaminda had gone to school"
"with  the  03rd  accused.  He  had  known the  03rd  accused  from his  childhood  days  as  he  had"
"been from the adjoining village."
"He had seen the 01st accused being armed with a 3 feet long gun. Chaminda had not seen"
"the 03rd accused being armed with any weapon. The 01st accused had been aiming the gun"
"at  the  house.  Chaminda  had  managed  to  identify  the  01st  and  the  03rd  accused  very  well"
"with the help of the front sidelights that he had switched on upon hearing the gunshots. He"
"had asked everyone at home not to step out of the house and informed them that he would"
"go and lodge a complaint to the police. Chaminda had stepped out of the house from the"
"rear  door.  He  had  heard  another  gunshot  being  fired.  The  sound  had  come  from  the  rear"
"side of his house. Thereafter he had gone up to the front door and had informed everyone"
"at  home  that  he  is  not  in  a  position  to  go  out  as  the  entire  house  is  surrounded  by  the"
"intruders. A short while later the lights had gone off. This had been followed by the sound of"
"someone trying to remove the grills."
"Chaminda had heard the sound of footsteps coming from the top of the roof. The intruder"
"had  in  the  said  process  broken  a  roof  tile  in  one  of  the  rooms.  Then  he  had  heard  the"
"intruder break  the  roof tile  in  another  room  thereafter.  This had  been followed  by a  loud"
"noise. The house had been filled with smoke. His father had thereafter  screamed saying ""I"
"got hit"". This had happened in the rear room adjacent to the sitting room."
"He  had  testified  to  the  effect  that  he  knew  that  a  bomb  had  exploded  and  also  that  his"
"father  got 
injured.  Chaminda  had  seen  his  father  fall.  This  had  been  followed  by  the"
"intruders pushing the rear door to open it. Chaminda had pushed the rear door to prevent it"
"from being opened. However, he had found it difficult to continue to keep the door pushed"
"and he  had  accordingly let  go  of  it.  Three persons  had  stepped  into  the  house.  There  had"
"been no lights in the kitchen at that time. The learned State Counsel had specifically queried"
"from the witness as to how he recognized the intruders. The witness had in response replied"
"by saying that he had managed to identify the intruders with the help of the torchlight. The"
"intruders  had  possessed  torches.  They  had  lit  the  torches  when  they  stepped  into  the"
"house. There had been more than one torch in their possession."
"Chaminda  had 
identified  the  three  persons  to  be  Jagath  the  01st  accused,  his  younger"
"brother Chutta the 02nd accused and Dayawansha the 05th accused. Jagath the 01st accused"
"had stepped into the house first. Chaminda had known the 01st accused Jagath and the 02nd"
"accused Chutta from his childhood days. He had known the 05th accused Dayawansha since"
"1995.  The  witness  had  received  a  blow  to  his  head  soon  after  he  had  seen  the  three"
"accused. He had started to bleed as a result of a blow. The witness had thereafter gone to"
"the sitting room. When he went to the sitting room, he had observed the trip switch having"
"been removed. Thereafter he had gone to the front room and had leaned against the wall."
"This had been followed by some of the intruders walking into the room."
"They  had flashed the  torchlight  inside  the  house  and  the room.  He  had  heard  one person"
"saying ""there is no one here"". Then another person had said, â€œthere is one under the bed""."
"Thereafter they pulled the person who had been hiding under the bed and that person had"
"said: ""don't aiye"". This had been followed by one person saying ""attack him"". He had heard"
