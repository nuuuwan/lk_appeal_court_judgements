"seen Chaminda falling holding on to his body. Chaminda had requested him to bend down."
"He  had  whilst  bending  down  looked  around  to  see  whether  there  was  anyone.  He  had"
"however not managed to see anyone. He had stood upon hearing a gunshot being fired. PW"
"1 Nelson, Chaminda and Chaminda's father had thereafter stepped out of the house from"
"the rear side. This had been followed by another gunshot being fired. The shot had struck a"
"barrel that had been there."
"Nelson had walked back into the house. He had thereafter peeped from the windows to see"
"who  was  outside.  He  had  at  that  point  seen  2-3  persons  armed  with  weapons  walking"
"around the house. Out of three persons he had managed to identify the 02nd accused. The"
"02nd  accused  had  been  armed  with  a  fish  cutting  knife  in  his  hand.  He  had  been  seen  to"
"circulate the house with the fish cutting knife. Chaminda had thereafter informed him that"
"someone is hiding behind the concrete stones. Chaminda had requested Nelson not to step"
"out of the house. There had been lights in the house at that time. They had switched off the"
"lights because of the intruders and had waited inside the rooms. The electricity had gone off"
"a little later."
"Nelson  had  seen  torch  lights  flashed  into  the  house  from  the  outside.  He  had  accordingly"
"come to know that there were some persons outside. He had felt as if around 7-8 persons"
"were running outside the house. There had been a ladder close to a room adjacent to the"
"sitting room and one of the intruders had used  it to climb onto the roof of the house. The"
"intruder had thereafter broken a few of the roof tiles. Both his eldest sister's daughter and"
"mother who had been inside the room with the door being closed had stepped out of the"
"room  on  hearing  the  sound  of  the  roof  tiles  being  broken.  This  had  been  followed  by the"
"sound of a loud explosion coming from the dining room. Nelson and his son in law had been"
"near the door at that time. Nelson’s son in law had inquired as to whether Nelson had got"
"injured. His son in law got injured thereafter."
"Nelson had walked up to the rear door together with Chaminda and Chaminda's father. The"
"01st and the 02nd accused had broken into the house from the rear door flashing torch lights."
"The  01st  accused  Jagath  Rohana  had  said  “cut  everyone  without  sparing  a  single  person""."
"Nelson had seen the 01st accused at his younger brother's house. He had known him for 5-6"
"years. The 02nd accused had entered the house first. The 01st accused had been armed with"
"a  long  weapon  like  a  gun  at  that  time.  Nelson  had  seen  several  others  behind  the  01st"
"accused.  He  had  not  remained  near  the  rear  door  thereafter  and  had  seen  his  son  in  law"
"falling near the door."
"Nelson had gone to the Godakawela  Police. It had been between 12.00 am and 01.00 am."
"He had narrated to the police as to what had happened and had gone home in the police"
"jeep having remained in the police station for 45 minutes. He had bumped into Chaminda"
"when  he  was  on  his  way  home  in  the  police  jeep.  Chaminda  had  been  bleeding  from  his"
"head at that time. They had taken Chaminda into the jeep and had taken him to the hospital"
"and had gone home thereafter."
"When he returned home with the police, he had seen Indunil lying dead in the front room."
"He had seen Dayananda lying dead in the room located on the rear side of the sitting room."
