"According  to  medical  evidence,  there  were  10  injuries.  The  1st  and  the  2nd  injuries  to  the"
"head were necessarily fatal. It had been caused by a blunt weapon. The learned counsel for"
"the 1st accused-appellant argues that there was no evidence to prove that Priyantha caused"
"these injuries or he was involved in committing the said offence. But at the same time, it is"
"important to note that there was no evidence to say that Priyantha actively participated to"
"stop  Sudantha  from  attacking  the  deceased  three-wheeler  driver.  It 
is  my  view  that 
if"
"Priyantha  wanted  to  rescue  the  deceased  three-wheeler  driver  he  should  have  done"
"something positive to stop attacking the deceased."
"The  learned  counsel for the  1st  accused-appellant  says  that  the  14th witness  named  in the"
"indictment Krishnan Jayanthi Nelson Mallika was important."
"Had  he  given  evidence,  PW  01  Manamperi's  credibility  could  have  been  tested.  The"
"deceased three-wheeler driver Sirisena’s wife Podi Menike testified that Mallika was having"
"an 
illicit  affair  with  the  deceased.  The  deceased  had 
left  Podi  Menike  on  07.10.1999."
"Thereafter his whereabouts were not known. It is not clear from the evidence, whether the"
"deceased  was  living  with  Mallika  or  elsewhere  at  the  time  of  this  incident.  It  was  Mallika"
"who informed Podi Menike about Sirisena’s death."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  2nd  accused-appellant  argued  that  only  2  civilian"
"witnesses had given evidence for the prosecution other than the police witnesses. The said"
"2 witnesses were Nihal Prabth Manamperi (PW 01) and the wife of the deceased Subadra"
"Podi Menike (PW 02). The only eyewitness who had given evidence about the incident was"
"PW 01. Subadra Podimenike  had given evidence only about the identification of the body."
"Evidence of PW 01 had not been corroborated by any other witness. There are a series of"
"decided  cases  by  the  apex  court  how the evidence  of  an  accomplice  should be  taken  into"
"account  by  the  Trial  Judge  when  arriving  at  a  decision.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"submits that it is not safe to arrive at a conviction upon the uncorroborated evidence of the"
"accomplice as set out in the following judgements;"
"In Queen vs. G.K.  Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314, Sansoni CJ had held that;"
