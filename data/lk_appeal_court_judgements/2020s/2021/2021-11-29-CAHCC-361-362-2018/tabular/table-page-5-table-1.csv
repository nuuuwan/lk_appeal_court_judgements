"dealing  of  a  blow.  Immediately  they  saw  that  the  deceased  had  fallen  on  the"
"ground.  The  second  accused  was  carrying  a  Palmyrah  stalk,  and  the  first"
"accused  was  carrying  a  helmet.  Only  the  two  accused  were  there  near  the"
"deceased. Then the three witnesses ran towards the deceased. The two accused"
"had run away.  Even after leaving aside the evidence of PW1, the evidence against"
"the second accused is sufficient to support the conviction. According to PW4 and"
"PW5,  there  was  nobody  who  could  have  dealt  the  blow  on  the  deceased  other"
"than the two accused.  The second accused was there carrying a palmyrah stalk;"
"there was only one grievous injury. The injury could have been caused by a club."
"The first accused had only carried a helmet, and the injury was not compatible"
"with one dealt by a helmet."
"PW1 stated that he saw the second accused had dealt a blow on the deceased by"
"a Palmyrah stalk and the first accused was also carrying a Palmyrah stalk.  One"
"of  the  arguments  by  the  appellants  was  that  PW1  was  not  a  reliable  witness."
"PW2, PW3, PW4, and PW5 had not seen him there. However, the appellants had"
"not challenged the evidence of PW 4 and 5 before this court. PW4, PW5 and PW6"
"were just fifteen meters ahead of the deceased when PW4 heard the sound of the"
"blow. He turned and saw the deceased had fallen and the second accused near"
"him was carrying a Palmyrah stalk. The first accused also was there carrying a"
"helmet. PW4, PW5 and PW6 were just 15 meters away from the deceased. When"
"they  approached  the  deceased  immediately  upon  hearing  the  blow,  the  two"
"accused had run away."
"The evidence of PW5 was almost the same; he too had seen the second accused."
"Both  these  witnesses  had  categorically  stated  that  only  the  two  accused  was"
"there at that place. PW2, PW4 and PW5 had immediately taken the deceased to"
"the Puthukkudiyiruppu hospital. Even if the evidence of PW1 is considered as"
"unreliable evidence, the evidence of PW4 and PW5 is sufficient to infer that the"
"second accused dealt the fatal blow on the accused."
