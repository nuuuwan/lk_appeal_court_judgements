"definition. This gives the term ‘taxable activity’ a very broad definition;"
"one under which the sale of trees by the Appellant falls quite comfortably."
"Incidentally, I observe that the definition of ‘taxable activity’ according to"
"Section 83 includes anything done in cessation of any activity. Therefore,"
"even  if  it  is  assumed  that  the  disposal  of  rubber  trees  which  no  longer"
"produce latex is not a supply of goods, it is an act done in connection with"
"the cessation of the taxable activity; supply of latex. Therefore, even if the"
"argument of the Appellant that the sale of rubber trees is not an activity"
"carried on as a trade is entertained, the sale is in any way caught up under"
"item (c) of the interpretation of taxable activity."
"On the above analysis I am of the view that the sale of rubber trees by the"
"Appellant is a supply of goods by a registered person in the course of the"
"carrying out of a taxable activity, which is liable for VAT under Section 2"
"(1) (a) of the VAT Act."
"The next important matter to be determined is whether the live trees sold"
"by the Appellant, which constitute the subject matter of this appeal, can be"
"held to be ‘unprocessed agricultural products’ within the meaning of item"
"(b) (xxiii) of Part II of the First Schedule of the VAT Act. This Court does"
"not deem it necessary to scrutinise whether live trees are ‘unprocessed’, as"
"this is apparent given the ordinary meaning of the term."
"Scrutiny must be placed on the word ‘agricultural’. Regarding the meaning"
"of the same words in the same statute, Bindra states that:25"
"‘It  is  an  ordinary  canon  of  interpretation  that  a  word  keeps  the  same"
"meaning at least throughout in any Act,26 and, as far as possible, the same"
"meaning ought to be given to that expression.27 It is well established that"
"in order to interpret a term in a particular legislation its use in the same"
"legislation in another provision is the best clue for interpretation.’"
"It appears to me that the word ‘agricultural’ has been used in a wide sense"
"in the VAT Act. The word agricultural has even been used as an adjective"
