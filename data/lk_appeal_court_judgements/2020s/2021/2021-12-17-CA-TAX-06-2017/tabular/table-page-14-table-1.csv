"2,998,047/= on settlement of the VAT covering  the entire years of 2008"
"and  2009.  The  Appellant  relied  on  Section  37  of  the  VAT  Act  and"
"submitted that the Assessor, in terms of the law, cannot reopen a concluded"
"matter."
"It is common ground that the Appellant has not preferred an appeal against"
"the assessment made by the Assessor, Mr. A. M. Nafeel. Hence, it appears"
"the assessment should be final and conclusive for all purposes in terms of"
"Section 37 of the Act. However, the proviso to the same section provides"
"that  nothing  in  Section  37  shall  prevent  an  Assessor  from  making  an"
"assessment or additional assessment for any taxable period if it does not"
"involve  reopening  any  matter which has been  determined  on appeal  for"
"that  taxable  period.  The  assessment  made  by  the  Assessor,  Mr.  A.  M."
"Nafeel has not been determined on appeal. Therefore, on a plain reading of"
"Section 37 itself, it is clear that the Assessor, Mr. J. M. U. N. B. Jayamaha"

"the taxable period of January 2009."

"The penultimate argument submitted by the Appellant on the procedural"

"Assessor who has written the intimation letter is not the same Assessor who"
"has  made  the  assessment.  In  fact,  what  the  Appellant  means  is  that  the"
"Assessor who has written the intimation letter is not the same Assessor who"
"has signed the assessment notices. There is no evidence before this Court"
"to show that the Assessor, Mr. J. M. U. N. B. Jayamaha (who signed the"
"intimation letter) did not make the assessment himself, as the assessment"
"had already been made by the time the intimation letter was sent. What the"
"Appellant  relies  on  is  the  fact  that  the  Senior  Assessor,  Mrs.  S.  M."
"Wickramarachchi has signed the assessment notices issued on 12th March"
"2012. The latter fact does not prove that Mr. Jayamaha did not make the"
"assessment."
"Nevertheless, I shall consider this point of law. Section 31 (1) reads:"
