"the weapon used and had identified the coconut husking crowbar marked as"
"P-03 as the possible weapon used."
"The  JMO  has  found  several  cut  injuries  and  abrasions  among  the  other"
"injuries.  He  was  of  the  view  that  injuries  09,  12,13  and  14  are  abrasions"
"that can happen as a result of dragging the victim while she was fallen face"
"up  on  the  ground.  It  was  also  his  view  that  the  stab  injuries  have  been"
"caused  while  the  deceased  was  on  the  ground  as  no  person  can  withstand"
"such number of injuries when standing. Apart from the injuries described in"
"detail,  the  JMO  has  also  found  contusions  on  the  upper  and  lower  inside"
"lips of the victim."
"The  evidence  of 
the  main 
investigation  officer  was 
that  he  received  a"
"complaint 
from  the  accused  that  his  wife’s  mother  died  as  a  result  of"
"injuries  she  suffered  from  falling  onto  a  coconut  husking  crowbar.  He  has"
"found  the  complaint  questionable  as  the  victim  has  been  taken  to  the"

"where  a  coconut  husking  crowbar  was placed.  He  has  observed  that  it  has"
"been  removed  from  the  place  where  it  was  and  on  the  ground.  He  has"
