"be determined by an expression in the statute itself of the result that shall"
"follow the non-compliance with the provision....”"
"[72] In the present case, the duty to make the determination within the time limit"
"specified in Section 10 is statutorily entrusted to the members of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission in terms of the provisions of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No."
"23 of 2011 as amended, and the parties had no control whatsoever, over the Tax"
"Appeals Commission. As Lord Sir Arther Channell put it correctly, it would cause"
"the greatest injustice to both parties who had no control over those entrusted with"
"the duty of making the determination, if we hold that neglect to observe the time"
"limit specified in Section 10 of the statute renders the determination made by the"
"Commission ipso facto null and void."
"[73] In my view, every limitation period within which an act must be done, is not"
"necessarily  a  prescription  of  the  period  of  limitation  with  painful  and  drastic"
"consequences  and  the  parties  who  have  no  control  of  those  entrusted  with  a"
"statutory duty and no fault of them should not be  made to suffer and lose their"
"rights for the failure to adhere to the time limitation specified in a provision."
"[74] In Visuvalingam v. Liyanage [(1985) 1 Sri LR 203], the Supreme Court was"
"called upon to consider the question whether the time limit of two months set out"
"in Article 126 (5) of the Constitution is mandatory or directory. The Supreme Court"
"by a majority decision held that the provisions of Article 126 (5) of the Constitution"
"are  merely  directory  and  not  mandatory.  Samarakoon,  C.J  stated  at  page  226"
"that:"
"“An examination of the relevant provisions of the Constitution indicates that"
"the  provision  is merely  directory......These  provisions  confer a  right  on  the"
"citizen and a duty on the Court. If that right was intended to be lost because"
"the  Court  fails  in  its  duty,  the  Constitution  would  have  so  provided.  It  has"
"provided no sanction of any kind in case of such failure. To my mind it was"
"only an injunction to be respected and obeyed, but fell short of punishment if"
"disobeyed.  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  the  provisions  of  Article  126  (5)  are"
"directory and not mandatory. Any other construction would deprive a citizen"
"of  his 
fundamental  right 
for  no 
fault  of  his.  While 
I  can  read 
into 
the"
"Constitution a duty of the Supreme Court to act in a particular way I cannot"
"read 
into 
to 
it  any  deprivation  of  a  citizen’s  guaranteed 
right  due"
"circumstances beyond his control”"
"[
75]  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  sought  to  distinguish  the  decision  of  Samarakoon,  C.J  in"
"Visuvalingam  v.  Liyanage  (supra) 
from 
the  present  case  on 
the  basis 
that"
"Visuvalingam  v.  Liyanage  was  only  a  case  of  infringement  of  the  fundamental"
"rights of the citizen, whereas this case involves the deprivation of a right of the"
"taxpayer.  Although  the  case  decided  by  Samarakoon  C.J.  in  Visuvalingam  v."
"Liyanage  (supra)  related  to  a  violation  of  a  fundamental  right,  in  my  view,  the"
"rationale of the statement of Samarakoon C.J. equally applies to the facts of the"
"present  case. 
If  we  are 
to  hold 
that 
the  proposition  of 
law 
laid  down  by"
