in  Walker  Sons  &  Co.  (U.K.)  Ltd.  v."
"Gunatilake  (1978-79-80)  1  Sri  L.R.  231,  stated  that  the  binding  effect  of  the"
"decisions  of  the  highest  Court  or  the  Court  of  last  resort  on  Courts  exercising"
"subordinate  jurisdiction  has  been  recognized  and  accepted  long  enough  by  our"
"Courts even to acquire the force of custom (p. 261)."
"[25]  In  the  present  case,  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  is  inviting  us  to  regard  the  above"
"statement made by Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. The Commissioner-General of"
"Inland Revenue (supra) as ratio, which, he argued, is the essence of the doctrine"
"of stare decisis and thus, it is a binding precedent of this Court, as it was decided"
"prior 
to  all 
three 
judgments  delivered  by  His  Lordship  Janak  de  Silva  J. 
In"
"ascertaining  the  ratio  decidendi  in  Mohideen  v.  The  Commissioner-General  of"
"Inland Revenue (supra), as far as time bar is concerned, we have to  distinguish"
"ratio decidendi from the obiter dicta having regard to the facts of the case decided"
"by  His  Lordship  Gooneratne  J.    and  then,  identify  the  principle  upon  which  the"

in  Mohideen  v.  The"

"[
26]  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  submitted  that  Section 10  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended, stipulates that the Commission  shall make its"
"determination  within 
two  hundred  and  seventy  days 
from 
the  date  of 
the"
"commencement of its sittings for the hearing of the appeal and therefore, the time"
"bar  indicated  in  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act  was  clearly  intended  to  be  a"
"mandatory provision of law and required strict compliance. He submitted that the"
"acceptance of that legal requirement by His Lordship Gooneratne J. in Mohideen"
"v.  The  Commissioner-General  of 
Inland  Revenue  (supra),  operates  as  ratio"
"decidendi to be followed by this Court as a binding precedent."
"[27] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Act stipulates that the Tax Appeals Commission"
"shall make its determination within 270 days from the date of the commencement"
"of  its  sittings  for  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.  Superficially,  the  effects  of  non-"
"compliance  of  a  provision  are  dealt  with  in  terms  of  the  mandatory-directory"
"classification. Generally, in case of a mandatory provision, the act done in breach"
"thereof is void, whereas, in case of a directory provision, the act does not become"
"void, although some other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation"
"of Statutes, First Ed, 2008422)."
