the  question  arose","for"

"","income received from the property and such income shall be treated as income"
"","from  the  house  property  and  not  income  from  a  business  (paragraph  3). The"
"","Court based its decision in the context of the main objective of the company and"
"","took the view that letting out of the property was not the object of the company"
