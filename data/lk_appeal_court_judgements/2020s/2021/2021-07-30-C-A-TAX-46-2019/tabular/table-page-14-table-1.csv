"on the intent of the legislature and not upon its language, irrespective of the fact"
"that  Section  10  is  couched  in  language  which  refers  to  the  word  “shall”.  The"
"intention of the legislature must be ascertained not only from the phraseology of"
"Section 10, but also by considering its purpose, its design and more importantly,"
"the consequences which would follow from construing it one way of another."
"[40] Now the question is, what is the consequence of the failure to adhere to the"
"time limit specified by Section 10 that has been intended by the legislature to be"
"categorised as mandatory or directory. That is how I would approach this question,"
"which is ultimately a question of statutory construction of Section 10 of the Tax"
"Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended.  Accordingly, one has to"
"identify the tests to be applied in deciding whether a provision that is disregarded"
"is mandatory or directory, and then apply them to the statute which stipulates the"
"determination shall be made within the time limit specified therein, but makes no"
"reference to any penal consequences."
"Consequence of non-compliance with a statutory provision"
"Purpose of the section in the context of the statute"
"[41] In considering a procedural requirement from this angle, a court is likely to"
"construe it as mandatory if it seems to be of particular importance in the context"
"of the enactment, or if it is one of a series of detailed steps, perhaps in legislation"
"which has created a novel jurisdiction, (Warwick v. White (1722) Bunb. 106; 145"
"E.R. 612) or if non-compliance might have entailed penal consequences for one"
"of the parties (State of Jammu and Kashmir  v. Abdul Ghani (1979) Ker LJ 46)."
"Where the disobedience of a provision is made penal, it can safely be said that"
"such provision was intended by the legislature to be mandatory (Seth Banarsi Das"
"v. The Cane Commissioner & Another, AIR 1955 All 86)."
"[42] As noted, the fact that no penal consequence is stated in a statute however,"
"is only one factor to be considered towards a directory construction and there are"
"other factors to be considered in determining whether a provision of a Statute is"
"mandatory or not. One of the factors in determining whether the consequence of"
"non-compliance  provision  was  intended  by  the  legislature  to  be  mandatory  or"
"directory  is  to  consider  the  broad  purpose  and  object  of  the  statute  as  Lord"
