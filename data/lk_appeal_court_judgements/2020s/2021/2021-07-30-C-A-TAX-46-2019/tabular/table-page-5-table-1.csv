"Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission, and the Commission"
"shall  notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  any  other  written  law  make  its"
"determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on"
"which  the  Commission  shall  commence  its  sittings  for  the  hearing  of  each"
"such appeal”."
"[
12] At the hearing, Dr. Shivaji Felix submitted that Section 10 of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as last amended by the Tax Appeals Commission"
"(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013, stipulates that the Tax Appeals Commission"
"shall make its determination within two hundred and seventy days from the date"
"of  the  Commission  commencing  its  sittings  for  the  hearing  of  each  appeal.  He"
"submitted that the amendment of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act,"
"No.  23  of  2011  with  retrospective  effect  on 
two  occasions  and  having  an"
"avoidance  of  doubt  clause 
in  Section  15  of 
the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No.  20  of  2013  makes  it  very  clear  that  the  intention  of"
"Parliament is that Section 10 as amended, is a mandatory provision of law which"
"requires strict compliance."
"[13] He further submitted that though the first date of hearing of the appeal as per"
"the Tax Appeals Commission proceedings was 24.05.2018, the determination of"
"the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  was  made  on  24.09.2019  and 
thus, 
the"
"determination has been made more than one year and 4 months after the date of"
"the  first  hearing.    His  contention  was  that  the  determination  made  by  the  Tax"
"Appeals  Commission  is  time  barred  by  operation  of  law  and  thus,  it  must  be"
"deemed to have been allowed on the basis that the Tax Appeals Commission had"
"no jurisdiction to hear the appeal after the time limit specified in Section 10 lapsed."
"[14]  He  drew  our  attention  to  the  following  statement  made  by  His  Lordship"
"Gooneratne  J.  in  Mohideen  v.  Commissioner  -General  of  Inland  Revenue  (CA"
"2/2007 (20-15) Vol. XXI. BASL Law Journal, page  171 decided on 16.01.2014,"
"referring to the statutory time bar applicable to the Board of Review in making its"
"determination under the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 at p."
"176:"
"“If specific time limits are to be laid down, the legislature need to say so in"
"very clear and unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in"
"various  ways.  To  give  a 
restricted 
interpretation  would  be 
to 
impose"
"unnecessary  sanctions  on  the  Board  of  Review.  It  would  be  different  or"
"invalid  if  the  time  period  exceeded  two  years  from  the  date  of  oral"
"hearing. If that be so, it is time barred.” [emphasis added]"
"[15] Dr. Shivaji Felix submitted that the judgments of the Court of Appeal in A.H."
"Mohideen  v.  Commissioner  -General  of  Inland  Revenue  (supra)  is  a  binding"
"precedent as the statement of Gooneratne J. was part of the ratio of the judgment"
"and to consider it by His Lordship Janak de Silva J. as constituting an obiter dicta"
