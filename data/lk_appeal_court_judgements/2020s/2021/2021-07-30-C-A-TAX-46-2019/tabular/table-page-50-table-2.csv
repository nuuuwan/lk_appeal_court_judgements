"practically  all  things.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  say  that  a  particular"
"activity is business because it is concerned with an asset with which trade is"
"commonly carried on. We find nothing in the cases referred, to support the"
"proposition that certain assets are commercial assets in their very nature""."
"[167] Dr. Shivaji Felix is correct in saying that the ownership of land or lease is"
"not the sole criteria in deciding whether the rent received from warehouses is"
"business income or rental income as observed by the Indian Supreme Court in"
"Karanpura Development Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal"
"(supra) and Sultan Brothers (P) Ltd. v. CIT (supra). But I am not inclined to agree"
"with his view, as noted previously, that all that the Appellant has to satisfy is that"
"he was merely engaged in providing warehouse facilities to be eligible for tax"
"concession  under  Item  31  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act.    The  absence  of  any"
"reference in the business registration certificate to the renting out the Appellant’s"
"properties may not be the sole test, but it is one of the factors to be considered"
"in  identifying  the  nature  of  business  activity  of  the  Appellant  and  deciding"
"whether the Appellant was carrying on a business or trade for the operation and"
"maintenance of facilities for storage as an undertaking."
"[
168] While  the  objects  of  the  business  must  be  kept  in  mind  in  deciding  the"
"factors, the nature of the activity and the nature of the operations of the taxpayer"
"in  relation  to  them  are  the  vital  factors  in  deciding  whether  the  income  from"
"warehouses  could  become  a  rental  income  or  business  income  (Karanpura"
"Development  Co.  Ltd.  v.  Commissioner of  Income  Tax, West Bengal  (supra)."
"The Indian judgments have given a demarcation line by providing a proposition"
"that where the main object of the company is to acquire and hold properties and"
"to  let  out  those  properties,  then  the  rental  income  may  be  treated  as  income"
"from business and not as income from house property. The question whether an"
"income of an individual is to be treated as income from business or mere rental"
"income depends upon the particular circumstances of each case as held in"
"Karanpura Development Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal'"
"(supra) and Sultan Brothers (P) Ltd. v.  CIT (supra)."
"[169] In the light of above judicial pronouncements, it is significant to consider"
"the facts and circumstances of the present case and examine first, whether the"
"nature  and  the  activity  of  the  Appellant  was  such  that  he  was  carrying  on"
"‘business of operating and maintaining facilities for storage and second, if so,"
"whether the income derived from leasing out his warehouses could be treated"
"as business income of the Appellant in the course of his business of operating"
"and maintaining facilities for storage."
