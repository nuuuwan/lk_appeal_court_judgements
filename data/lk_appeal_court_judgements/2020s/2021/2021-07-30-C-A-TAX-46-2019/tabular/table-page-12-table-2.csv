"“The  difference  between  mandatory and  directory  statutes  is  one  of  effect"
"only.  The  question  generally  arises  in  a  case  involving  a  determination  of"
"rights  as  affected  by  the  violation  of,  or  omission  to  adhere  to  statutory"
"directions.  This  determination  involves  a  decision  of  whether  or  not  the"
"violation or omission is such as to render invalid Acts or proceedings to the"
"statute,  or rights,  powers,  privileges  claimed  thereunder. If  the  violation or"
"omission is invalidating, the statute is mandatory, if not, it is directory”."
