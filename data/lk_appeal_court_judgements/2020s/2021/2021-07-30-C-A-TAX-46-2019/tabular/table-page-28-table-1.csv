"Indian Supreme Court stated at paragraph 18 that “The ratio of any decision must"
"be understood in the background of the facts of that case. It has been said long"
"time ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides and not what"
"logically follows from it”. Bindra in “Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edition at page"
"869 states:"
"“In order to understand and appreciate the binding force of a decision, it is"
"always necessary to see what were the facts of the case and what was the"
"point which had to be decided...”."
"[86] Bindra,  referring  to  the  techniques  of  distinguishing  the facts of  a previous"
"decision from the facts, a case, a Judge is called upon to decide in order to treat"
"a former decision as a binding judicial precedent quotes the following statement"
"from Salmond, Jurisprudence, 11th Ed. pp 223-24, at page 869:"
"“A precedent is a judicial decision which contains in itself a principle. The"
"underlying principle which thus forms its authoritarian elements is often the"
"ratio decidendi. The concrete decision is binding between the parties to it,"
"but  it  is the  abstract  ratio  decidendi which  alone  has  the  force  of  law  as"
"regards the world at large. ‘The only use of authorities or decided cases’,"
"says Sir George Jessel ‘is the establishment of some principle, which the"
"judge can follow out in deciding the case before him’. ‘The only thing’, says"
"the same distinguished judge in another case, ‘in a judge’s decision binding"
"as an authority upon a subsequent judge is the principle upon which the"
"case was decided’. The only judicial principles which are authoritative are"
"those  which  are  thus  relevant  in  their  subject  matter  and  limited  in  their"
"scope. All others, at the best are distinguished from them, under the name"
"of dicta or obiter dicta, things said by the way. The prerogative of judges is"
"not 
to  make 
law  by 
formulating  and  declaring 
it-this  pertains 
to 
the"
"legislature-but 
to  make 
law 
by 
applying 
it. 
Judicial 
declaration,"
"unaccompanied by judicial application is not of binding authority” [emphasis"
"added]."
"[87]  Bindra, 
referring 
to 
the 
judicial  authorities 
that  used 
techniques  of"
"distinguishing facts of a previous decision from the facts, a case, a Judge is called"
"upon to decide further states at page 871:"
"“Any  judgment  of  any  court  is  considered  to  have  been  necessary to  the"
"decision  of  the  actual  issue  between  the  litigants.  It  is  for  the  court,  of"
"whatever  degree,  which 
is  called  upon 
to  consider 
the  precedent, 
to"
"determine what the true ratio decidendi was. It is the reason and spirit of"
"cases that make the law, not the letter of particular precedents. It may be"
"laid down as a general rule that that part alone of a court of law is binding"
"upon courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction and inferior court which the question"
"before the court has really been determined. This underlying principle which"
"forms the only authoritative element of a precedent is often termed the ratio"
"decidendi”."
