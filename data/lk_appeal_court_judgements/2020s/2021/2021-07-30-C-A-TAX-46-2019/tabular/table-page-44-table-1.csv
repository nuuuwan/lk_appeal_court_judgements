"maintenance of facilities (activities) in respect of three main purposes namely,"
"storage, development of software or supply of labour."
"[145] The legislature advisedly used the words ""for operation and maintenance"
"of  facilities  for  storage”  because  the  intention  of  the  legislature  in  granting"
"concessionary tax rate was to encourage any undertaking to carry on business"
"for  operation  and  maintenance  of  facilities  for  storages  or  development  of"
"software  or  supply  of  labour  as  a  source  of  income  for  such  undertaking  for"
"meeting operating and maintaining costs of such warehouses."
"[146] If it was the intention of the legislature to extend the benefit to profits and"
"income derived by mere letting or renting or leasing out warehouses irrespective"
"of whether, it was involved in operating and maintaining facilities for storage, it"
"would  not  have  used  the  words  “the  rate  of  income  tax  applicable  to  any"
"undertaking  carried  on 
in  Sri  Lanka 
for  operation  and  maintenance  of"
"facilities  for  storage….”.  It  could  have  easily  used  the  words  “The  rate  of"
"income tax applicable to any undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for storage….”."
"[
147] The key words are “for operation and maintenance of facilities for storage”,"
"which refer to the operation and maintenance of facilities for whole storage and"
"not that the undertaking shall also use the storage individually by itself either to"
"store  goods  or  provide  services  therefrom.  I  do  not  think  that  the  words  “for"
"operation and maintenance of facilities for storage” used in Item 31 prevent a"
"taxpayer from renting or leasing out his warehouses to others and making an"
"income  or profit  as  submitted  by  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix.  I  am  not  impressed  by  the"
"argument  that  it  would  not  be  possible  for  the  Appellant  to  derive  a  profit  or"
"income by renting out his warehouses to others when the taxpayer is engaged"
"in the business of operating and maintaining facilities for storage as referred to"
"in Item 31 of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[148]  All  what  is  intended  by  the  legislature  is  that  the  undertaking  must  be"
"engaged in the business or trading activity of operating and maintaining facilities"
"for  storage  and  Item  31  does  not  in  any  way,  prevent  such  undertaking  from"
"deriving  profits  or  income  by  letting  or  renting  or  leasing  out  warehouses  to"
"others while operating and maintaining facilities for storage."
"[149]  If the  argument advanced  by  Dr. Shivaji  Felix  holds  water,  the  words  in"
"Item  31  “for  operation  and  maintenance  of  facilities  for  storage”  will  be"
"meaningless. What will happen, if the benefit is extended to “mere provision of"
"storage without fulfilling the condition of “operation and maintenance of facilities"
"for storage”, referred to in Item 31?  If the words ""operation and maintenance of"
"facilities  for  storage”,  are  not  given  their  natural  meaning,  it  will  defeat  the"
"legislative  intent  and enlarge  the  legislative  intent  by  disregarding  a  condition"
"precedent to the operation of the concessionary tax rate in Item 31."
"[150] In my view, the legislative intent was to encourage a taxpayer to carry on"
"the  business  of  operating  and  maintaining 
facilities 
for  storage  as  an"
"undertaking,  and  derive  business  income  from  such  storage  facilities  in  the"
