"[180] In Griffiths v. Jakson (supra), Vinelott J. quoted with approval the following",""
"dictum of Lord Greene MR in Croft (Inspector of Taxes) v. Sywell Airdrome Ltd",""
"(1942) 1 K.B. 317 at 329 when drawing the distinction between income derived",""
"from the exploitation of property rights and income derived from the carrying on",""
"of a trade:",""
"","“…why  and  on  what  principle  is  a  person  who,  for  example,  sets  up  a"
"","refreshment stall on his land and provides services for people admitted to his"
"","land, not exhaustively taxed under Schedule A or B (as the case may be) in"
"","respect of or occupation save in the sense and to the limited extent that he"
"must  own  or  occupy","the 
land  before  he  can  erect  and  carry  on 
the"
"","refreshment stall or perform the services. The profits earned in such a case"
"","are referable, not to the exercise of the rights of property or of occupation"
"","since  the  customers  come  on  to  the  land  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining"
"","refreshment or procuring the benefit of the services. If on the other hand, the"
"","owner of land having (let me suppose) a remarkable view or some historic"
"","monument merely allows the public to come on to the land in return for an"
"","admission fee, I cannot myself see why it should be said that his profits are"
"","not covered by the Schedule A assessment since all that he is doing is to"
"","exploit his right of property by grating licences to come upon the land. The"
"","fact that he keeps the paths in order or the monument in repair in order to"
"","make a visit more attractive to the public again appears to me to make no"
"","difference,  any  more  than  does  the  action  of  the  landlord  of  a  house  in"
"keeping it in repair.”",""
"[181]  Having  considered","the  relevant  authorities,  Vinelott  J.  concluded  as"
"follows:",""
"","“When the income derived by the owner from letting furnished, whether for"
"","a short or a long term and whether in small or large units and whether in self"
"","-contained units or to tenants who share a bathroom or kitchen or the like,"
"","is not income derived from carrying on a trade but is still taxable under Sch."
"","A or, in the case of para. 4, under Case VI of Sch. D.  Of course, if the owner"
"","provides services and the services are separately charged or the receipts"
"","can  be  otherwise  apportioned  in  part to  the  provision  of  the  services  any"
"","profit derived from the provision of the services will be taxable as the profits"
"of a trade.”",""
"[182]  The  Appellant  has  not  placed  any  credible  material  to  satisfy  that  the",""
"nature  of  the  leasing  out  his  premises  is  an  integral  part  of  the  business  or",""
"trading operation of the Appellant who is engaged in operating and maintaining",""
"facilities for storage and not enjoyment of property as the land owner by merely",""
"leasing out his premises to others. The mere fact that the Appellant has leased",""
"out his premises to his lessees and derived a rental income from warehouses",""
"cannot, for that sole reason be treated, as carrying on a trade or business as an",""
"undertaking  referred  to  in  Item  31.  The  facts  and  the  circumstances  clearly",""
"indicate that it is a case of a leasing out the property owned by the Appellant",""
"and deriving rental income from the subject premises simplicitor as indicated in",""
