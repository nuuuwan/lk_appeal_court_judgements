"[111] The Tax Appeals Commission, in its determination dated 21.09.2016 stated"
"that the Appellant is not eligible for the concessionary rate of tax set out in Item"
"31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act for the following reasons:"
"1.  The term “undertaking” means a kind of a business and the term “business”"
"has been defined in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act, which restricts"
"the letting or leasing of any premises to a company and not to an individual;"
"2.  The letting or leasing out  premises is treated as a business only, if such"
"activities  carried  out  by  a  company  and  in  case  of  an  individual,  income"
"from letting or leasing of properties falls under Section 3 (g) and liable to"
"income tax under Section 6 of the Inland Revenue Act, where the rates and"
"the 25% allowance for repairs and maintenance can be deducted;"
"3.  The Appellant is not involved in the business of operating and maintaining"
"facilities for storage within the meaning of Item 31 of the Inland Revenue"
"Act,  but  only  rents  out  his  premises  to  persons  to  be  used  for  storage"
"facilities and office work as seen from the Business Registration Certificate"
"and the lease agreements;"
"4.  The Appellant’s activity of renting out his premises cannot be treated as an"
"undertaking or as a business and that the Appellant’s activity of renting out"
"premises falls within the scope of Section 3 (g) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[
112] In view of the rival submissions made by both Counsel, this Court is invited"
"to determine the following four issues:"
"1.  Whether the concessionary tax rate of 10% under and in terms of Item 31"
"of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act applies only to the business"
"income  of  a  company  in  view  of  the  definition  of  the  term  “business”  in"
"Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act;"
"2.  Even if Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule applies to an individual, whether the"
"Appellant constitutes an undertaking carried on the business of operating"
"and maintaining facilities for storage within the meaning of Item 31 of the"
"Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act;"
"3.  On the facts and circumstances of this case, whether the income received"
"by the Appellant from leasing out his property is to be treated as business"
"income or rental income from his property;"
"4.  On  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  whether  the  Appellant  is"
"entitled to a concessionary tax rate under Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to"
"the Inland Revenue Act."
