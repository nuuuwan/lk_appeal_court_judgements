"compliance  of  the  time  limit  specified  in  Section  10.  In  my  view,  they  are  not"
"intended to make the parties suffer for the failure of the Commission to make the"
"determination  within  the  time  limit  specified  in  Section  10  of  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission Act."
"[60] Any procedural retrospective operation of a provision, in my view, cannot take"
"away the rights of parties who have no control over those entrusted with the duty"
"of  making  determination  within 
the 
time 
limit  specified 
in  Section  10.  The"
"retrospective operation of Section 10 without any penal or other consequence of"
"non-compliance,  by  itself,  cannot  be  treated  as  a  factor  in  determining  that  the"
"legislature intended that the failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section"
"10 is mandatory."
"Avoidance of doubt clause"
"[61] Dr. Shivaji Felix further relied on the avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15"
"of the Tax Appeals Commission Act to argue that Section 15 would be rendered"
"nugatory if the provisions of Section 10 are considered to be directory. A perusal"
"of Section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013"
"reveals that it relates to appeals that have been transferred to the Commission"
"from the Board of Review, and provides that the Tax Appeals Commission shall"
"have the power to make a determination in respect thereof, beyond twelve months"
"granted for its determination of appeals by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act"
"No. 23 of 2011."
"[62] It seems to me that the avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15 applies to"
"appeals transferred from the Board of Review and not to new appeals directly filed"
"before  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission.  On  the  other  hand,  the  intention  of  the"
"legislature  in  Section  15  is  to  empower  the  Commission  to  hear  an  appeal"
"transferred 
to 
it  by 
the  Board  of  Review  under  Section  10  of 
the  Act,"
"notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve months granted for its determination by"
"the Tax Appeals (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012. It seems to me that Section 15"
"manifests that the legislature never intended that the time period specified in the"
"general scheme of the Tax Appeals Commission Act to be mandatory and holding"
"otherwise,  would  not promote  the main  object of the  legislature  reflected  in  the"
"Act."
"Consequences of non-compliance of statute by those entrusted with public"
"duty"
"[63]  One  of  the  important  factors  that  is  necessary  for  determining  whether  a"
"provision  is  mandatory  or  directory  is  to  find  as  to  who  breached  the  time  limit"
"specified in Section 10-whether it was breached by one of the parties to the action"
"or by those entrusted with the performance of a public duty. Also coming under"
