"""We think each case has to be looked at from a businessman's point of view"
"to find out whether the letting was the doing of a business or the exploitation"
"of his property by an owner. We do not further think that a thing can by its"
"very nature be a commercial asset. A commercial asset is only an asset used"
"in  a  business  and  nothing  else,  and  business  may  be  carried  on  with"
"practically  all  things.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  say  that  a  particular"
"activity is business because it is concerned with an asset with which trade is"
"commonly carried on. We find nothing in the cases referred, to support the"
"proposition that certain assets are commercial assets in their very nature""."
