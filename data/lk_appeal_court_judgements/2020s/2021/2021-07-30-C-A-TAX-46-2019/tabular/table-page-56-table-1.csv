"[191] The concession specified in Section 59B in relation to any  undertaking"
"engaged in the manufacture of any article or in the provision of any service has"
"to  be  understood  in  the  context  in  which  the  term  “undertaking”  is  to  be"
"understood (Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner-General"
"of Inland Revenue) (supra). The term “undertaking” has to be understood as an"
"economically independent and self-sustaining entity taken as a whole and in the"
"context 
in  which 
it  occurs  and 
thus, 
it  must  be  understood 
first,  as  any"
"undertaking as a whole and then, such undertaking must be engaged in the"
"manufacture of any article or provision of services (supra)."
"[192]  This  Court  held 
in  Polycrome  Electrical 
Industries 
(Pvt) 
Ltd 
v."
"Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) that one has to consider the"
"object  of  granting  tax  concessions  to  an  undertaking  under  Section  59B  and"
"thus, the said expression “undertaking” will have to be construed liberally in a"
"broader commercial or business/trade sense, keeping its object and context in"
"mind."
"[193]  The  Appellant  is  claiming  the  total  rental  income  under  Section  59B  as"
"expenses  incurred  in  the  provision  of  services  when  calculating  the  service"
"income of the Appellant, despite the fact that Appellant had agreed to take the"
"10% of the total service fee, as a profit of service sector. The relevant parts of"
"the 
reasons 
for 
the  determination  of 
the  Appeal  made  by 
the  Senior"
"Commissioner at pages 16-17 of the TAC brief are as follows:"
"“The expenses incurred relevant to the particular ancillary services can be"
"allowed  as  expenditure  when  calculating  the  service  income.  But  other"
"expenses which do not relevant to such service income cannot be allowed."
"Furthermore,  at 
the 
interview  held  on  05.08.2016  before  me, 
the"
"Authorised  Representative  agreed 
to 
take  10%  of 
total  service 
fee"
"received as a profit of service sector”."
"[194] The question is, in addition to providing ancillary services referred to in the"
"lease agreements, whether the Appellant is engaged in providing other specific"
"services as an integral part of his business or trading activity in the nature of an"
"undertaking  referred  to  in  Section  59B  to  be  regarded  as  a  separate  service"
"income,  rather  than  mere  activity  of  renting  out  his  premises  to  tenants  for"
"storage."
"[195] A closer reading of the lease agreement at page 119 of the brief reveals"
"that apart from the consideration of Rs. 450,000/- and the aggregate lease rental"
"of Rs. 840,000/- (for the entire term) and monthly rental of Rs. 35,000/- plus 15%"
"VAT and any other prevailing taxes to be paid, no service charge is set out in"
"the  said  Agreement.  The  service  charge  of  10%  referred  to  in  other  lease"
"agreements  can  only  be  regarded  as  ancillary  services,  which  constitute  an"
"insignificant portion of the whole rental income. There is nothing to indicate that"
