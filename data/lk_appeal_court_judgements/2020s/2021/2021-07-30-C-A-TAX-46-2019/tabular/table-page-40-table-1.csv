"[129] In my view, the concept of “undertaking” referred to in Item 31 is wider than"
"the mere term “business” referred to in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act. It"
"is not limited to the activities carried out by a company as incorrectly found by the"
"Tax  Appeals Commission.  It applies both  to an  individual and  a  company  and"
"profits and income earned by an individual or company, as long as such individual"
"or  company  in  the  nature  of  an  undertaking  carried  on  business  or  trading"
"activities as a whole, from which profits and income arise for the purpose and"
"activity referred to in Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act."
"Rental income vs. business income"
"[130] But, the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission did not rest there."
"The  Tax  Appeals  Commission  has  proceeded 
to  consider 
the  next  crucial"
"question  whether  the  Appellant 
is 
involved 
in 
the  activity  of  operating  and"
"maintaining  facilities  for  storage.    On  facts,  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  has"
"decided that the Appellant is not engaged in operating and maintaining facilities"
"for storage as required by Item 31, but the income received by the Appellant by"
"leasing  out  his  premises  for  storage  constitutes  only  a  rental  income  under"
"Section 3 (g) and not a business income. For the said reasons, the Tax Appeals"
"Commission disallowed the tax concession sought by the Appellant under Item"
"31 of the Fifth Schedule to  the Inland Revenue Act. The last paragraph of the"
"determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission at page 7 of the TAC brief"
"confirms this position."
"[131] The next question is whether the rental income received by the Appellant"
"can be considered as a business income for the purpose of Item 31 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, irrespective of the fact that the concession in Item 31 applies to an"
"individual or a company, and profits or income of an undertaking. The question"
"whether the rental income falls into the category of business income  within the"
"meaning of Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act, depends on"
"the type of the activity that is carried on by an undertaking in Sri Lanka and the"
"purpose referred to in Item 31 of the Act."
"[132] At the hearing Dr. Shivaji Felix submitted that the Tax Appeals Commission"
"was  wrong  in  holding  that  the  taxpayer  must  be  engaged  in  the  activity  of"
"operating and maintaining a facility for storage to be eligible for the concessionary"
"tax 
rate  of  10%.  He  submitted 
that 
the  premises 
in  question  have  been"
"constructed for the purpose of warehouses and that they are used for the purpose"
"of storage facility other than a small part of the premises, which is used as office"
"space.  His  contention  was 
that 
the  warehouses 
in  question  are  dedicated"
"warehouses and therefore, the Appellant is engaged in providing almost 90% of"
"warehouse facilities to others for which rent was charged."
