"4.The instant appeal was taken up for an oral hearing only on 17.02.2006"
"which is almost 6 ½ years since it was filed. It is submitted that the definition"
"of the word “hearing” as used in the second proviso to section 140 (10) must"
"be  interpreted  having  regard  to  the  legislative  intention  of  disposing  of"
"matters  before  the  Board  of  Review  speedily.  It  would  be  contrary  to  the"
"legislative intention (and the Board of Review would be at liberty to make"
"even twenty-five years before orally hearing as appeal) if the operation date"
"for the commencement of the time bar was construed to be the date of the"
"oral hearing....”"
"[93]  Based  on  the  said  written  submissions,  His  Lordship  Gooneratne  J.  has"
"identified and referred to the Appellant’s main point for the determination of the"
"Court at page 177 of the judgment as follows:"
"“The  Appellant’s  view  is  that  commencement  of  the  time  bar  will  operate"
"from the date on which he submitted to the jurisdiction of the Board. That"
"would be according to the Appellant on receipt of the Petition of Appeal by"
"the Board and not from the date of the oral hearing. Emphasis on this point"
"is by reference to 140 (10) of Act No. 38 of 2000. As such Appellant submits"
"it is the intention of the legislature that all of it should be concluded in 2 years"
"and in the instant case it took 6 ½ years since filing the petition.” [emphasis"
"added]"
"[94]  It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  State  Counsel  before  His  Lordship"
"Gooneratne J. as indicated at page 177 that “legislative intention by the use of the"
"word “hearing” in section 140 (10) means an “oral hearing” and no more”. His reply"
"submissions  as  reproduced  by  His  Lordship  Gooneratne  J.  in  summary  is  as"
"follows:"
"“Based on Section 140 of the Act, No. 38 of 2000, legislative intended the"
"word ‘hearing’ to mean an oral hearing; ........."
"S
ection 140 (10) provides that the Board shall confirm, reduce, increase or"
"annul  the  assessment  ‘after  the  hearing’  of  the  Appeal.  It  is  therefore"
"patently evident that the word “hearing” used consistently in Section 140 of"
"Act No. 38 of 2000 means an “oral hearing” and no more”."
"[95]  It  is  manifest that  the main argument  advanced  by  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  before"
"Gooneratne J. was that as the legislative intention was to dispose of both appeals"
"within  a  total  period  of  four  years  and  the  time  limit  of  2  years  will  begin  to"
"operate from the date on which the Petition of Appeal is received by the Board"
"of Review and not from the date of the oral hearing. It is crystal clear that the"
"issue before His Lordship Gooneratne J. was whether the legislature intended that"
"the hearing used in the second proviso to Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act,  No.  38  of  2000  as  amended,  for  the  calculation  of  a  two-year  time  period"
"commences from the date of the oral hearing as contended by the State or from"
"the date of the Petition of Appeal received by the Board of Review as contended"
"by  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix.  His  Lordship  Gooneratne  J.  answered  this  question  at  pp."
