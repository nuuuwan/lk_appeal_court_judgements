"Statutes 31 (2014) by focusing on the legislative process, taking into account the"
"problem  that  the  legislature  was  trying  to  solve  (Henry  M.  Hart,  Jr.  &  Albert M."
"Sacks, “The legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law”"
"1182  (William N.  Eskridge,  Jr. &  Phillip P.  Frickey  Eds.,  (1994). We  must  thus,"
"ascertain what the legislature was trying to achieve by amending the Tax Appeals"
"Commission Act twice as far as the time bar is concerned."
"[44] Dr. Shivaji Felix strenuously contended that, given the tax law context, a strict"
"approach to construction of Section 10 of the TAC statute should be adopted as"
"the amendment of the Tax Appeals Commission Act with retrospective operation"
"twice  would  reflect  the  legislative  intent  that  the  compliance  with  Section  10  is"
"mandatory. He argued that if the time bar stipulated in Section 10 was intended"
"to be directory, the amendment of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act,"
"No. 23 of 2011 with retrospective effect on two occasions and the avoidance of"
"doubt clause found in Section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment)"
"Act, No. 20 of 2013 would have been superfluous."
"[45] Will the amendment of Section 10 with retrospective operation twice manifest"
"the intention of the legislature that the failure of the Tax Appeals Commission to"
"make its determination within the time limit specified in Section 10 is mandatory?"
"From Section 15, it is manifest that the legislature intended Section 10 to operate"
"retrospectively, so that the date of the commencement of Section 10 is earlier than"
"the date of that amendment."
"[46] A legislative intention to amend Section 10 with retrospective operation does"
"not necessarily or conclusively mean that the failure to make the determination of"
"the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  within  the  time  limit  specified  in  Section  10  is"
"mandatory. If such drastic consequence was really intended by the legislature, it"
"would  have  made  appropriate  provisions  in  express  terms  in  Section  10  to  the"
"effect  that  “the  appeal  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  allowed  where  the  Tax"
"Appeals Commission fails to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 of the"
"TAC Act”."
"[47] There are guidelines in tax statutes which stipulate that the failure to observe"
"any time limit provision would render the appeal null and void or that the appeal"
"shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  allowed.  For  example,  Section  165  (14)  of  the"
"Inland  Revenue  Act,  No.  10  of  2006  as  amended,  provides  that  “an  appeal"
"preferred to the Commissioner-General shall be agreed to or determined by the"
"Commissioner-General within a period of two years from the date on which such"
"petition  of  appeal  is  received...”.  The  same  section  specifically  stipulates  that"
"“where such appeal is not agreed to or determined within such period, the appeal"
"shall be deemed to have been allowed and tax charged accordingly”."
