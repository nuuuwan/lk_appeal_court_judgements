"will have to inquire whether the Petitioner or the Respondent has acted in breach"
"of the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement. Furthermore, the court will"
"have  to  take  into  consideration  the  alleged  contractual  relationship  between"
"parties. However,  in the case of  Podinona  Urban Council Horana 1981 (1) SLR"
"141,  it  was  held  that  in  as  much  as  the  relationship  between  the  parties  was"
"contractual the Petitioner was not entitled to the remedy by way of Certiorari.  In"
"the case of Ariyaratne vs. the National Insurance Corporation and Others (2003"
"2 Sri Lr 212) it was held as follows;"
"“The  fact  that  the  authority  has  failed  or  refused  to  fulfil  certain  terms"
"contained in that contract does not give rise either to public law rights or"
"to any statutory obligations under which court can assume jurisdiction to"
"issue a writ.”"
"Accordingly, depending on the relationship between parties I am of the view that"
"the Petitioner is not entitled for a remedy under prerogative powers of this Court."
"Despite  the  Petitioner’s  failure  to  submit  the  relevant  Lease  Agreement,  the"
"Respondent  has  submitted  a  copy  of  the  said  Agreement  (R4)  entered  into"
"between the Petitioner and the Respondent with his Statement of Objections."
"The  Petitioner  has  not  denied  the  authenticity  of  the  said  agreement  R4.  The"
"Petitioner has conceded the fact that the subject house and the premises has"
"been granted to him by the Food Commissioner upon a Lease Agreement.  The"
"said  agreement  R4  specifies  that  the  subject  house  and  the  premises  are"
"Government Quarters in terms of Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession)"
"Act.  Hence  the  Petitioner  is  stopped  from  denying  the  same.  On  the  above-"
"premise, the applicability of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession)"
"Act in respect of the impugned house and premises cannot be disputed."
"The  Section  7(3)  of  the  Government  Quarter’s  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act"
"provides the remedies available for such person who claims that they have been"
"unlawfully ejected from Government Quarters. Therefore, if at all the Petitioner"
"claims  that  he  has  been  unlawfully  ejected  from  Government  Quarters,  the"
"Petitioner may resort to the alternative remedy available and institute an action"
"for damages or other reliefs in terms of the above section."
"In terms of section 4 of the Government Quarter’s (Recovery of Possession) Act"
"where a quit notice has been served on the occupier of any Government Quarters"
"neither such occupier nor any dependent of  such occupier shall be entitled to"
"occupy  such  quarters  after  the  expiry  of the  period  of  within such  occupier  is"
