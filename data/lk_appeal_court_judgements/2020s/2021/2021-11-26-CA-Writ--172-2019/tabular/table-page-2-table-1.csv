"Dhammika Ganepola, J."
"The Petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Writ of"
"Certiorari  to  quash  the  quit  notice  dated  18.02.2019  issued  in  terms  of  the"
"Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969, marked as P8"
"to  the  Petition.  Both  parties  agreed  to  get  the  argument  disposed  by  way  of"
"written  submissions.  Anyhow  none  of 
the  parties  have 
filed 
the  written"
"submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together"
"with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different."
"The Petitioner states that he is an Inspector of Police. The house and premises at"
"G-18,  Daanyagama Housing Scheme in Trincomalee, has been  provided to the"
"Petitioner upon a Lease Agreement entered into between the Petitioner and the"
"Food Commissioner. Despite, the Petitioner’s failure to submit a copy of the said"
"Lease  Agreement  along  with  his  Petition,  the  Petitioner  claims  that  he  has"
"complied  with  all  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  said  Lease  Agreement."
"Petitioner 
states 
that 
the  Respondent  had 
instituted  actions  against 
the"
"Petitioner before the Magistrate Court of Trincomalee against the Petitioner in"
"order to recover possession of the said premises. Nevertheless, said action has"
"been  later  withdrawn  by  the  Food  Commissioner.  Thereafter,  the  Respondent"
"has issued the purported quit notice (P8) dated 18.02.2019 against the Petitioner"
"demanding  the  Petitioner  to  hand  over  the  vacant  possession  of  the  said"
"premises alleging that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the Lease Agreement."
"In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application moving"
"for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  quit  notice  marked  P8  stating  that  the"
"purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below."
"i. 
no valid reason has been given and the reasons stated in the said notice"
"are vague"
"ii. 
the  Respondent  has  procured  a  violation  of  the  Lease  Agreement  by"
"refusing to accept the rental payment."
"Although  the  Petitioner  denies  the  allegation  of  violation  of  any  term  or"
"condition  of  the  said  Lease  Agreement  as  referred  in  the  quit  notice  P8,  it  is"
"observed  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  present  before  this  Court  the  most"
"substantial  document 
i.e.,  the  Lease  Agreement  upon  which  the  Petitioner"
"intends  to  base  his  case  upon.  Even  so  the  Petitioner’s  stance 
is  that  the"
"Respondent has violated the Lease Agreement."
"Apart from the above findings, in order to decide as to whether the impugned"
"quit notice is bad in law based on the reasons alleged by the Petitioner, this Court"
