"country  by  individual  ministries.  It  cannot  be  supposed  that  this  regulation"
"meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind  to the"
"matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers"
"are  normally  exercised  under  the  authority  of  the  ministers  by  responsible"
"officials  of  the  department.  Public  business  could  not  be  carried  on  if  that"
"were  not  the  case.  Constitutionally,  the  decision  of  such  an  official  is,  of"

"must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under"

"[28] It is to be noticed that in Carltona Ltd. v. Commr. of Works, the question arose"
"with  reference  to  the  validity of  an  order  passed  by  the  Assistant  Secretary  to  the"
"Commissioner 
for  Works 
requisitioning 
some  premises,  under 
the  Defence"
"Regulations,  which  authorised 
the  requisition  ""if 
it  appears 
to 
the  competent"
"authority  to  be  necessary  so  to  do""  for  certain  specified  purposes.  The  Carltona"
"doctrine thus, applies where a statute has conferred a power on a Minister, and it is"
"practically impossible for the Minister to exercise such power personally, he may,"
"in general, act through a duly authorised officer of his department without having a"
"formal  delegation  to  do  so.  It  recognises  the  principle  that  the  functions  of  a"
"Minister are so multifarious that the business of government could not be carried on"
"if he were required to exercise all his powers personally. Thus, the official is treated"
"as the minister’s alter ego, and to that extent, his decision is regarded as those of the"
"Minister."

same  principle  was 
applied 
in  Kuruppu 
v.  Keerthir  Rajapakse,"
"Conservator of Forests (supra). The question arose inter alia, as to whether it was"
"competent  for  the  Conservator  of  Forests  to  specify  the  area  within  into or  out  of"
"which  no  timber  of  any  species  could  be  transported  without  a  permit  from  an"
"authorised officer. Rodrigo, J. who quoted the following  passage from De Smith’s"
"Judicial  Review  of  Admistrative  Action,  2nd  Ed.  Pp.  290  &  291  at  pages  168  and"
"169:"
"“Special considerations arise where a statutory power vested in a Minister or"
"a department of State is exercised by a departmental official. The official is the"
"alter ego of the Minister or the Department and since he is subject of as to the"
"fullest control by his superior he is not usually spoken of as a delegate…..The"
