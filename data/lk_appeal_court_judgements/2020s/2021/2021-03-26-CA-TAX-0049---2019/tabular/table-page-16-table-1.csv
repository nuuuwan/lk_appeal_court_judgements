"[43]  As  noted, 
the  appeal  has  been  made  on  12.09.2014  and 
it  has  been"
"acknowledged  on  18.09.2014  and  thus,  the  date  of  the  time  bar  as  stated  in  the"
"acknowledgement 
is  17.09.2016.  A  perusal  of 
the  determination  made  by 
the"
"Respondent  at  pages  68/164  of 
the  brief 
reveals 
that 
it  has  been  made  on"
"02.09.2016 and the said determination has been communicated to the Appellant on"
"14.09.2016 (vide-page 69 of the brief). On the face of the record, it is patently clear"
"that the determination  has  been made within  a period of 2  years from the date  on"
"which the petition of appeal was received by the Commissioner-General."
"[44]  The  contention  of  Mr.  Goonewardena  was,  however,  that  the  date  of  the"
"determination should have been taken as 14.09.2016. His argument is based on the"
"premise that the determination is not completed or made until it is communicated to"
"the person to be affected by the determination. I am not inclined to agree with Mr."
"Goonewardenaâ€™s contention. All what is required under section 165 (14) is that the"
"determination  of  the  Commissioner-General  shall  be  made  within  a  period  of  2"
"years 
from 
the  date  on  which 
such  petition  of  appeal 
is 
received  by 
the"
"Commissioner-General. 
It 
is 
not 
envisaged 
in 
section 
165 
(14) 
that 
the"
"determination  shall  also  be  communicated  to  the  Appellant  within  a  period  of  2"
"years  from  the  date  on  which  such  petition  of  appeal  is  received  If  it  was  the"
"legislative intent, it shall be stated in unequivocal language in section 165 (14)."
"[45]  There 
is  a  clear  distinction  between  a  determination  of 
the  appeal  and"
"communication  of  appeal  and  they  are two different things  or  steps  at  different"
"stages.  The former is the determination of the confirmation, reduction, increase or"
"annulment  of  the  assessment  made  by  the  Respondent  and  the  latter  is  the  formal"
"intimation to the Appellant of the fact that such a determination has been made."
"[46] I am of the view  that the date  of the determination could not be taken as the"
"date of the communication as communication presupposes determination of a thing"
"to  be  communicated  to  the  Appellant.  This  Court  in    Stafford  Motor  Company"
"(Pvt) Limited v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue, CA Tax 17/17 decided"
"on  15.03.2018  considered  a  similar  point.  In 
that  case, 
the  Court  considered"
"whether a lawfully valid assessment can be made without serving a valid notice of"
"assessment  or  whether  there  is  a  requirement  to  give  notice  of  assessment  before"
"making an assessment. The Court held that there is no requirement to give notice of"
"assessment  before  making  an  assessment  as  practically  it  cannot  be  done  as  the"
"assessment  must  first  be  made  followed  by  a  notice  of  assessment.  His  Lordship"
