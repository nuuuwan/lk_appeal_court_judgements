"and  staff,  their  disciplinary  control,  their  conduct  in  and  of  the  business,  are  all"
"matters  that  are  part  and  parcel  of  running  the  business  and  therefore  touch  the"
"business....”.  The 
term  ‘business’  can 
thus  be  understood  as  having  a  broad"
"meaning and the scope of the term extends to a trade, profession, vocation, or any"
"such arrangement having the characteristics of a business transaction."
"[67]  The  Court’s  general  approach  to  whether  a  given  entity  is  an  undertaking"
"within the meaning of the tax rules focuses on the types of composite business or"
"trade  activities  engaged  in  by  such  entity  as  a  whole  from  which  profits  and"
"income 
arise 
rather 
than 
individual 
business 
or 
trading 
activity 
or 
the"
"characteristics  of  the  actors  who  perform  it.  Thus,  the  concept  of  undertaking"
"refers to the collective reference to a number of business or trading activities as a"
"whole,  undertaken  by  an  economically 
independent  and 
self-sustaining  one"
"indivisible  business  entity 
rather 
than  a 
single  business  activity  under  one"
"undertaking."
"[68] The word “undertaking” therefore, should be understood to have been used in"
"Section 54B in a wide sense and must be understood as one taking in its fold all"
"collective 
business 
or 
trading 
activities 
a 
person  may 
undertake 
as 
one"
"economically independent and self-sustaining indivisible business entity. As long"
"as  this  test  is  satisfied,  it  is  immaterial  whether  the  undertaking  carries  out  the"
"same  business  or  different  business  or  trading  activities  and  even  if  in  law  that"
"business  entity  consists  of  several  persons,  natural  or  legal  and  separate  activity"
"within such entity."
"[69]  Applying  the  above  legal  principles,  I  desire  to  state  that  the  expression"
"“undertaking” is of wide import and is capable of covering not only the activity of"
"manufacture, but also activity of sale of imported items undertaken by a person or"
"company earning profits and income from such business or trading activities as a"
"whole  so 
long  as 
it 
is  an  economically 
independent  and  self-sustaining  one"
"indivisible business entity."
"Is the business activity of manufacture an  “undertaking” for the purpose of"
"section 54B (2) of the Inland Revenue Act?"
"[70] Mr. Goonewardena took a great pain, defining the term “undertaking” which,"
"goes  to  show  that  the  manufacture  of  electrical  items  by  the  Appellant  can  be"
"considered  as  one  separate  undertaking  for  the  purpose  of  tax  benefits  under"
"section 59B of the Act. The contention of Mr. Goonewardena was that every single"
"business activity constitutes a single ""undertaking"" and thus, the term undertaking"
"shall be  treated separately as the business activity engaged in the  manufacture  of"
