"for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  time  bar  making  an  assessment.  Court"
"determines that the date of making the assessment is the relevant date for the"
"purpose of determining the time bar.”"
"[47] It is true that the Appellant’s statutory obligation to file an appeal to the Tax"
"Appeals  Commission    against  the  determination  cannot  be  set  in  motion  until  the"
"determination  is  communicated  to  him  and  hence,  the  determination  has  to  be"
"communicated to the Appellant who is affected by such determination. In my view,"
"this does mean that, until a determination is communicated, a  valid determination"
"under  section  165  (14)  is  not  made  at  all.  An  order  to  be  communicated,  must"
"presuppose the existence of a  determination and the existence of a determination is"
"only possible when the Respondent has made the determination."
"[48]  The  Respondent  has  discharged 
the 
statutory 
function  of  making 
the"
"determination  within  a  period  of  2  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  petition  of"
"appeal  was  received  by  the  Commissioner-General  on  12.09.2014.  The  Inland"
"Revenue Act does not say that the determination must also be communicated to the"
"Appellant  within  2  years  from  the  date  on  which  such  petition  of  appeal  was"
"received by the Commissioner-General. I, therefore, cannot accept the contention of"
"Mr. Goonewardena that the date of communication of the determination is the date"
"of the determination for the purpose of section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[49] 
In 
the  present  case, 
the  appeal  was  made  on  12.09.2014  and 
it  was"
"acknowledged  within  30  days  of  its  receipt  viz.  18.09.2014.  The  appeal  has  been"
"determined within a period of 2 years from the date on which the petition of appeal"
"was received by the Commissioner-General viz. 02.09.2016, as required by section"
"165 (14) of the Act. For the reasons stated above, the answer to the question of law"
"No. 1 should be made in the negative and against the Appellant."
