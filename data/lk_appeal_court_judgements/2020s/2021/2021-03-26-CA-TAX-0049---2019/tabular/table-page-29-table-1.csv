"rendered  services  and  provided  facilities  of  the  organisation  were  not  divided  to"
"serve the local and the foreign clients separately."
"[87] The legislative intent is clearly reflected in the section 59B (2) (b) in using the"
"words “the turnover of such undertaking” and thus, it is easily discernible, that the"
"legislature  wanted  to  add  the  total  turnover  received  by  the  whole  undertaking."
"Section 59B (2) cannot be formed by splitting up of the turnover of each business"
"activity of an undertaking when the words used in the section refers to the turnover"
"of  “undertaking”  and  not  the  turnover  of  “any  single  business  activity”  to  fall"
"within the term “undertaking”. The primary legislative intent as reflected in section"
"59B  appears  to  be  to  provide  tax  concessions  specified  in  the  fifth  schedule  in"
"terms  of  section  59B  to  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (SMEs)  and  encourage"
"their  economic  activities,  whose  total  turnover  from  any  undertaking  as  a  whole"
"consisting of all business activities within one indivisible business or trading entity"
"does not exceed Rs. 300 Million."
