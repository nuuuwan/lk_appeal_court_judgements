"[54] On the other hand, Mrs. Nammuni vehemently relying on section 59B of the"
"Inland  Revenue  Act  contended  that  the  assessee  is  very  much  engaged  in  several"
"business activities, namely, manufacturing, sale and import of  goods and the word"
"“undertaking” in section 59B is a collective reference to all the business activities"
"of  a  company  or  person.  Mrs.  Nammuni  contended  that  the  word  “undertaking”"
"used in section 59B refers to “business” and since the Appellant’s business consists"
"of several business activities and the entire turnover of undertaking from all of the"
"business  activities  exceed  Rs.  300  Million,  the  Appellant  is  not  eligible  for  a"
"concessionary rate of 10% and accordingly, the concession under Section 59B was"
"rightly denied by the assessor."
"[55] Now the first question is whether the term “undertaking” used in section 59B"
"of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  10  of  2006  as  amended  by  the  Inland  Revenue"
"(Amendment)  Act  No.  22  of  2011,  for  the  purpose  of  tax  concession  means  any"
"particular  business  activity  (a  single  business  activity  of  a  company  or  person)  or"
"whether  the  expression  is  a  collective  reference  to  all  the  business  activities    of  a"
"company  or  person  as  an  independent  business  entity  of  which  the  turnover  does"
"not exceed Rs. 300 Million for that year of assessment."
