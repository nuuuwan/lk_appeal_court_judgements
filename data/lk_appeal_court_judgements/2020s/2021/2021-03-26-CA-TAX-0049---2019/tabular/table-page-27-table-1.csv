"effect to the intention of the Legislature as that intention is to be gathered from"
"the language employed having regard to the context in connection with which"
"it is employed. The Court must no doubt ascertain the subject matter to which"
"the particular tax is by the statute intended to be applied, but when once that"
"is  ascertained,  it  is  not  open  to  the  Court  to  narrow  or  whittle  down  the"
"operation  of  the  Act  by  seeming  considerations  of  hardship  or  of  business"
"convenience or the like. Courts have to give effect to what the Legislature has"

"[81] In short, taxes are imposed by the letter  of the law and not the spirit and the"
"Court’s duty is to give effect to the intention of the Legislature as that intention is to"
"be gathered from the language employed having regard to the context in which it is"
"applied.  On  a  plain  reading,  it  transpires  that  under  section  59B  (2),  an  assessee"
"becomes  entitled  to  10%  tax  concession  of  the  profits  and  income  where  the"
"“undertaking” is mainly engaged in the business of manufacture of goods or in the"
"provision  of  service  and  where  the  total  turnover  of  such  undertaking  does  not"
"exceed  Rs.  300  Million.  In  my  view,  the  emphasis  is  on  the  turnover  of  the"
"undertaking  consisting  of  all  business  or  trading  activities  as  an  economically"
"independent and self-sustaining one indivisible business or trading entity."

turn 
to 
the  decision  of 
the  Supreme  Court 
in  Rodrigo  v."
"Commisssioner-General of Inland Revenue (2002) 1 Sri LR 384, which was relied"
"on  by  Mrs.  Nammuni  in  support  of  the  contention that  the  manufacturing  activity"
"cannot be treated as one undertaking.  The asseseee in that case was an accounting"
"firm and earned profits  in local and foreign currency by carrying out professional"
"services  as  a  single 
indivisible  business  organisation  under 
the  control  of 
the"
"partners.  The  income  earned  in  foreign  currency  were  exempted  from  the  income"
"tax.    Her  Ladyship  Bandaranayake  J.  (as  she  then  was)  held  that  although  the"
"Appellant provided services to both local and foreign clients, and earned income in"
"foreign  currency, 
the  Appellant’s 
firm  was  only  one  business  and  not 
two"
"businesses as it carried on the professional practice as a single indivisible business"
"organisation under the control of the partners. Bandaranayake J. stated at page 388:"
"“The partnership to which the appellant’s belonged to carried on or exercised"
"a  professional  practice  in  Sri  Lanka  dealing  with  local  as  well  as  foreign"
"clients.  From  its  inception,  the  appellant’s  firm  carried  on  or  exercised  the"
"said professional practice as a single indivisible business organisation under"
"the control of the partners. A core staff of the  specialists supported the firm in"
"rendering  the  relevant  professional  service.  The  partners  as  well  as  the  staff"
"and  the  physical  assets  of  the  organization  were  not  divided  to  serve  local"
"clients  and  foreign  clients  separately.  Accordingly,  the  firm  has  only  one"
"indivisible  business,  the  common  exercise  of  it  being  providing  services  to"
