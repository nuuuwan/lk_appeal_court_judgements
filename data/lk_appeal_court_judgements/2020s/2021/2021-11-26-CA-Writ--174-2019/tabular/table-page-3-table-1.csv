"between the Petitioner and the Respondent with  his Statement of Objections."
"The  Petitioner  has  not  denied  the  authenticity  of  the  said  agreement  R1.  It"
"appears  that  the  Petitioner  has  taken  the  possession  of  the  premises  in  issue"
"upon a Lease Agreement marked R1 to the Petition. The said Lease Agreement,"
"in terms of its clause (iv), becomes inoperative with effluxion of the time or upon"
"the  Petitioner  ceasing  to  hold  employment  at  the  Prima  Ceylon  Ltd.  The  said"
"Lease Agreement is applicable only for period from 29.09.2014 to 28.09.2015 and"
"therefore,  the  agreement  expires  on  the  28.09.2015.  No  evidence  has  been"
"produced  before  this  Court  to  the  effect  that  the  Lease  Agreement  has  been"
"extended  beyond  28.09.2015.  Further  to  that,  the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner"
"conceded  the  fact  that  the  Petitioner  has  already  retired  from  the  service  at"
"Prima Ceylon Ltd. Hence, this Court observes that there is no Lease Agreement"
"in existence as to this date."
"Apart from the above findings, in order to decide as to whether the impugned"
"quit notice is bad in law based on the reasons alleged by the Petitioner, this Court"
"will have to inquire into the fact whether the Petitioner or the Respondent has"
"acted 
in  breach  of 
the 
terms  and  conditions  of 
the 
Lease  Agreement."
"Furthermore, 
the  court  will  have 
to 
take 
into  consideration 
the  alleged"
"contractual  relationship  between  parties.  However,  in  the  case  of  Podinona"
"Urban  Council  Horana  1981  (1)  SLR  141,  it  was  held  that  in  as  much  as  the"
"relationship between the parties was contractual the Petitioner was not entitled"
"to  the  remedy  by  way  of  Certiorari.  In  the  case  of  Ariyaratne  vs.  the  National"
"Insurance Corporation and Others (2003 2 SLR 212) it was held as follows;"
