"The Petitioner states that the Petitioners application for Leave must be dealt with on its own"
"merits, independently of the 1st Contributory Respondent's application in Revision and the Final"
"Appeal. The defects or impediments of one application should not be construed as constituting"
"part and parcel of the other. The Petitions Leave to appeal application cannot be prejudiced by"
"the  fact  that  the  1st  Contributory  who  has,  acting  on  independent  advice,  filed  a  Revision"
"application and a Final Appeal."
"The Contributory Petitioner in April 1998 made an application to the District Court of Colombo"
"to wind up the affairs of Imperial Medical Stores Limited, under and in terms of section 255 (c)"
"and (f) of the Companies Act 17 of 1982."
"The  1st  Contributory  Respondent  filed  objections  to  the  application to  wind  up  the  company."
"Subsequent to an inquiry into the application to wind up the said company the District Court, by"
"Order dated 10/09/1998 sanctioned the winding up on the said company. This was an application"
"made by a Contributory. It is not an application made by a Creditor. In fact, the company sought"
"to be wound up did not owe any monies to any entity."
"The Contributory Petitioner states that her Attorney-at-Law informed the Liquidator not to sell"
"the property by way of Public Offer, but to do so only by Public Auction, and further not to sell"
"the  same  to  Ram  Brothers  (Pvt)  Ltd,  namely  the  Intervenient  Petitioner.  Despite  the  said"
"instructions the Liquidator by letter dated 10/05/2004 informed the Contributory Petitioner's"
"Attorneys at Law that he would be taking all steps to sell the property by public offer."
"At this point, the liquidators should have taken note of the fact that the duty is owed (in the"
"absence of any creditors) to the Contributories. The Petitioner on or about 31/03/2005 made an"
"application  to  the  District  Court  of  Colombo  seeking  an  order  to  prevent  the  sale  of  the  said"
"property  and  further  an  Order  of  Court  directing  the  Liquidator  Petitioner  to  act  in  terms  of"
"Article 56 of the Memorandum and Articles of the said Company and distribute the assets of the"
"company amongst the shareholders thereof."
"Articles 56;"
