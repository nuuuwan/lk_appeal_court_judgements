"I
f the Petitioners, while holding the official designation of ‘teacher’ were to be paid"
"the salary scale that they were entitled to as ETAs, which admittedly was higher than"
"the  basic salary of a  teacher, and the  academic allowance as  well,  that would have"
"led to an anomaly, with the Petitioners receiving a gross salary higher than what they"
"would be entitled to in their official designation of teacher. Hence, the rationale for"
"not  paying  the  academic  allowance  to  the  Petitioners.  This  is  a  reflection  of  the"
"underlying principle that their take home salary cannot be less than what they would"
"have enjoyed as ETAs."
