"Commission  Act,  No.  23  of  2011empowers  the  Commission  to  summon  any"
"official of the bank or obtain written confirmation of such overdraft interest."
"[91] This appeal to the Court of Appeal against  the determination by the Tax"
"Appeals Commission is by way of case stated and relates only to a point of law."
"In general, further evidence could not be admissible on the appeal, but, there"
"is little doubt that the new evidence would be admitted on appeal to the Court"
"of  Appeal  on  the  fulfilment  of  certain  conditions  (Ladd  v.  Marshall  [1954]  1"
"W.L.R. 1489). According to  ""Ladd v. Marshall”  test, to justify the reception of"
"fresh evidence or a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled: (a) it must be"
"shown 
that  the  evidence  could  not,  with  reasonable  diligence  have  been"
"obtained for use at the trial; (b) the evidence must be such that, if given, it would"
"probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need"
"not be decisive; (c) the evidence must be such as presumably to be believed,"
"or,  in  other  words,  it  must  be  apparently  credible,  though  it  need  not  be"
"incontrovertible."
"[92] To admit fresh evidence by way of written confirmation of overdraft interest"
"said to have been paid by the Appellant to Sampath Bank, some good reason"
"must  be  shown  why 
the  Appellant 
in 
the 
first 
instance,  with  reasonable"
"diligence,  could  not  have  produced,  the  written  confirmation  of  the  Sampath"
"Bank  either  before 
the  assessor  or 
the  Commissioner  General  of 
Inland"
"Revenue.  The  Appellant  has  failed  to  satisfy  this  first  condition  laid  down  in"
"""Ladd v. Marshall”."
"[93] The application to remit the case to the Tax Appeals Commission with a"
"direction  to  call  for  the  confirmation  of  the  interest  paid  on  overdrafts  is  a"
"question  of  fact.  Where  an  Appellant  has  failed  to  place  sufficient  evidence"
"before the assessor or the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue to obtain"
"a finding in her favour on a question of fact, he cannot ask the Court to remit"
"the case to the Tax Appeals Commission to give her an opportunity to produce"
"further evidence of the same fact (McLaish v. CIR 38 TC 1)."
"[94] In addition to the “Ladd v. Marshall “test, there are other factors upon which"
"the Court is entitled to remit a case to the Commission with a direction to revise"
"the  assessment  in  accordance  with  the  opinion  of  the  Court. Where  there  is"
"evidence  of 
 
fraud,  or  conspiracy,  or  deception,  or  misdirection  and  any"
"judgment was procured by any party  in his favour by fraud (Meek v. Fleming"
"[1961] 2 Q.B. 366 , p. 379), it would be wrong to allow him to retain the judgment"
"unfairly procured."
"[95] The justification for remitting the case for Commissioners would include (i)"
"misdirection  on  the  part  of 
the  Commissioners  and 
the  Commission  was"
"deliberately misled by the parties in a material particular (John Anthony Brady"
