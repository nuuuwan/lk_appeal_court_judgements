"concessionary tax rate of 10%. He submitted that the premises in question have",""
"been constructed for the purpose of warehouses and that they are used for the",""
"sole purpose of storage facility by the Appellant. His contention was that the",""
"warehouses in question are dedicated warehouses and therefore, the Appellant",""
"is  engaged  in  providing  warehouse  facilities  to  others  for  which  rent  was",""
"charged.  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  submitted","that 
if 
the 
taxpayer 
is  operating 
the"
"warehouse  facility,  she  has  to  use  the  storage  facility  for herself  and  thus,  it",""
"would not be a source of profit or income to her, but a cost to the person using",""
"the facility.",""
"[33] The learned Senior State Counsel, however, submitted that in terms of Item",""
"31,  the  concessionary  rate  of  10%  can  only  be  granted  if  the  Appellant  is",""
"operating and maintaining a facility for storage, but merely providing a storage",""
"facility to others and collecting a rent is insufficient for the eligibility under Item",""
"31 of the Fifth Schedule. She referred to the lease agreements in question and",""
"disputed  the  position  of  the  Appellant  that  the  warehouses  in  question  are",""
"dedicated warehouses as claimed by the Appellant.",""
"[34] She further submitted that the lease agreements had imposed the liability",""
"of getting the respective premises and the goods insured on the lessees and",""
"obtaining the fire insurance policies and installing the firefighting equipment at",""
"their  own  cost.  She  submitted  that  no  evidence  has  been  placed  by  the",""
"Appellant  to  establish  that  she  was  operating  and  maintaining  facilities  for",""
"storage and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to 10% concessionary rate",""
"of tax as correctly determined by the Tax Appeals Commission.",""
"Whether the Appellant is operating and maintaining facilities for storage",""
"[35] In order to earn the benefit under Item 31, the following conditions must be",""
"satisfied by the Appellant, namely,",""
"(i)","the Appellant is an undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka."
"(ii)","the Appellant being an undertaking, must have derived profits or income"
"","from storage facilities (warehouses); and"
"(iii)","the Appellant being an undertaking, must have carried on in Sri Lanka"
"","for  operation  and  maintenance  of 
facilities 
for 
(a)  storage, 
(b)"
"","development of software; or (c) supply of labour."
