"[86] Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance deals with “Burden of proof” and it"
"“Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or"
"liability depends on the existence of facts which, he asserts, must"
"prove that those facts exist."
"When a person is bounded to prove the existence of any fact, it is said"
"that the burden of proof lies on that person.”"
