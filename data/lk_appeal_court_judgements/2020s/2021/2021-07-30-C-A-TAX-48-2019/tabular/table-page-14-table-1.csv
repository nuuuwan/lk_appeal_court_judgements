"concession  does  not  make  violence  to  the  plain  meaning  of  such  provision,"
"impair the legislative requirement and the spirit of the provision."
"[41] A construction of such a provision depends, inter alia, upon the purpose"
"for which the concession is sought to be granted and upon the fulfilment of such"
"conditions as may be specified therein. It is well-settled that in order to claim"
"the  benefit  of  a  tax  concession,  a  party  who  seeks  such  concession  must"
"comply with all the conditions of a provision and the benefit is not conferred, by"
"stretching  or  adding  words  to  the  provision.  In  State  Level  Committee  v."
"Morgardshammar India Ltd AIR 1966 SC 524, the Indian Supreme Court held"
"that:"
"“..... It must be remembered that no unit has a right to claim exemption from"
"tax as a matter of right. His right is only insofar as it is provided.... While"
"providing 
for  exemption, 
the  Legislature  has  hedged 
it  with  certain"
"conditions. It is not open to the Court to ignore these conditions and extend"
"the exemption.”"
"[42]  It  will  appear from  the  scheme  used  in  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  that  the"
"legislature  has  granted 
tax  concessions  under 
Item  31,  with  a  view 
to"
"encouraging an undertaking carried on business in Sri Lanka for operation and"
"maintenance of facilities (activities) in respect of three main purposes namely,"
"storage, development of software or supply of labour."
"[43] The legislature advisedly used the words ""for operation and maintenance"
"of  facilities  for  storage”  because  the  intention  of  the  legislature  in  granting"
"concessionary tax rate was to encourage any undertaking to carry on business"
"for  operation  and  maintenance  of  facilities  for  storages  or  development  of"
"software  or  supply  of  labour  as  a  source  of  income  for  such  undertaking  for"
"meeting operating and maintaining costs of such warehouses."
"[
44] If it was the intention of the legislature to extend the benefit to profits and"
"income  derived  by  mere 
letting  or 
renting  or 
leasing  out  warehouses"
"irrespective of whether, it was involved in operating and maintaining  facilities"
"for storage, it would not have used the words “the rate of income tax applicable"
"to any undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for operation and maintenance of"
"facilities  for  storage….”.  It  could  have  easily  used  the  words  “The  rate  of"
"income tax applicable to any undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for storage….”."
"[
45] The key words are “for operation and maintenance of facilities for storage”,"
"which refer to the operation and maintenance of facilities for whole storage and"
"not that the undertaking shall also use the storage individually by itself either to"
"store  goods  or  provide  services  therefrom.  I  do  not  think  that  the  words  “for"
"operation and maintenance of facilities for storage” used in Item 31 prevent a"
"taxpayer from renting or leasing out his warehouses to others and making an"
