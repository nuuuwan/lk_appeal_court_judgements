to  be 
that 
the  expression  ""for 
37]  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix’s  argument  appears"
"operation and maintenance of facilities for storage....” must not be understood"
"in their strict dictionary sense, because that would defeat the very purpose of"
"encouraging  persons  to  build  warehouses  for  the  purpose  of  storage.  His"
"argument is that such a strict application would result in imposing an obligation"
"on the Appellant to use the facility for himself-not rent it out to others as a source"
"of profit or income to her, but only a cost. According to him, the tax concession"
"for operating storage facility was given to facilitate trade and trade activities and"
"the expression ""for operation and maintenance for facilities for storage "" must"
"take colour from the purposes for which they are expected to be rented, one of"
"them  being 
facilitating 
the 
trade  and 
if 
the  concession 
is 
limited 
to  an"
"undertaking,  which 
is  engaged 
in  operating  and  maintaining 
facilities 
for"
"storage, it would be impossible for the taxpayer to earn profit or income from"
"renting such storage."

"income and business income must be understood in the context of the scheme,"

"Revenue  Act.  A  business  income can  include  income  from any  business  or"
"trade  activity  carried  out  by  a 
taxpayer 
for  profit  or  with  a 
reasonable"
"expectation  of  profit,  which  may 
include  a  profession,  vocation, 
trade,"
"manufacturing endeavour, an undertaking of any kind, as well as a venture or"
"concern in the nature of trade."
