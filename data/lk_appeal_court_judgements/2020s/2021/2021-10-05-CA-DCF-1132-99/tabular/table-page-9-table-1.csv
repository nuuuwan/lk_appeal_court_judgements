"When a co-owner claims prescriptive title against other co-owners,"
"proof  of  undisturbed,  uninterrupted,  adverse,  or 
independent"
"possession for more than ten years explicitly adverted to in section"
"3 of the Prescription Ordinance itself is not sufficient. In a co-owned"
"property, every co-owner does not need to enjoy the property to have"
"the co-ownership intact. The possession of one co-owner is  in law"
"the  possession  of  other  co-owners. 
‘Nothing  short  of  ouster  or"
"something equivalent to ouster by an overt act as opposed to a covert"
"act is absolutely necessary to make possession adverse and end co-"
"ownership’  (vide CA/549/2000/F, CA Minutes of  04.12.2018  –  per"
"Samayawardhena, J)."
"When  a  co-owner  claims  prescriptive  title  to  the  entirety  of  the"
"subject matter against the other co-owners  such as in the instant"
"case, there is an onus cast on them to establish the fact that they"
"had prescribed to the entire corpus by adverse possession against"
"other  co-owners  for  at  least  ten  years  from  the  date  of  ouster  or"
"something equivalent to ouster."
"It is salient to note that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Appellants relied upon"
"the  title  deed  marked  1V9/P6,  wherein  their  predecessor  in  title,"
"Wedikkara Dayawansa Silva had purchased undivided rights from"
"the corpus in 1960. Hence, the position took up by these Appellants"
"(Point of contest No. 05. Vide p. 132 of the Appeal brief) stating that"
"Wedikkara  Dayawansa  Silva  was  in  exclusive  possession  of  the"
"entirety of the subject matter from 1960 is devoid of merits.  Since"
"the predecessor in title of the Appellants had purchased undivided"
"rights from the corpus, the Appellants are precluded from claiming"
"prescriptive title to the entirety of the subject matter in the absence"
"the  other  co-owners.  Vide 
of  expressed 
intention  of  ouster  of"
"Wickramaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera (supra)."
"It 
is  pertinent 
to  be  noted 
that 
the  2nd  Appellant 
in  cross-"
"examination  had  categorically  admitted  the  fact  that  they  claim"
