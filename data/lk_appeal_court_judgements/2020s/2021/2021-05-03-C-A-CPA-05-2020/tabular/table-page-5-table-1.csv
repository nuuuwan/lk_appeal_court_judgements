"under section 66 (1) (b) of the Act after two months from the date of dispossession. The"
"learned High Court Judge has concluded that the Company is not entitled to any relief"
"under and in terms of section 68 of the Act for the reason of that delay. The Company"
"has  alleged that the  dispossession  had taken place  on 07.01.2019. The learned High"
"Court Judge has considered that the proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court have been"
"initiated on 21.03.2019. According to the facts stated in the first two paragraphs in the"
"order  dated  21.08.2019.  of  the  learned  Magistrate,  it  is  clear  that  the  information  in"
"terms of section 66(1)(b) has been filed in the Magistrate’s Court on 27.02.2019. and"
"the case  has been  called in  open Court  on 21.03.2019. to  support  for notices on the"
"respondent. Therefore, it is clear that the affidavit information under section 66 (1) (b)"
"has been filed in Court on 28.02.2019. and not on the 21.03.2019. as observed by the"
"learned High Court Judge. Therefore,  the Court can come to  the conclusion that the"
"learned High Court Judge has made an error on a fact which is vital in making a decision"
"under section 68 of the Act."
