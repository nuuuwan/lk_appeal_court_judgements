"It was argued by the Plaintiff Respondent that, the said Dharmakeerthi Perera has performed"
"the same thing, on behalf of the Plaintiff in this case. Witness Perera has testified under oath"
"that he does have reasonable knowledge of the matters related to the pedigree of the Plaintiff"
"The witness of the Plaintiff has testified to the manner in which the Plaintiff came to be the"
"owner of the property in question and furthermore regards the metes and boundaries of the"
"property as well from his personal knowledge and knowledge gathered from the documents"
"made available to him and facts which he verily believes to be true. It shows that the Plaintiff"
"has discharged its burden of proof. Thus, the contention of the 1A, 2nd, 17th to 20th Defendants"
"is devoid of any merit and does not warrant any serious consideration."
"The  26th  Defendant,  has  corroborated  the  evidence of  the Plaintiff  whilst  establishing  her"
"title  to  the  portion  of  the  property  which  she  came  to  be  the  owner  of  and  has  been  in"
"possession of for in excess of 30 years. She has testified from her personal knowledge being"
"a resident since her birth."
"The Plaintiff has through cogent evidence proven its title and pedigree."
"It is my view that on account of the totality of evidence, the finding of the Learned Trial Judge"
"is the only finding any judge could have arrived at, in considering the evidence given by the"
"parties."
