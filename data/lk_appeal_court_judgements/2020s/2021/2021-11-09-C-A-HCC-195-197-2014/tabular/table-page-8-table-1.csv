"In this matter in question, medical evidence alone is sufficient to establish the requisite mens rea"
"pertaining  to  the  offences,  murder  and  attempted  murder  given  the  site  of  the  injuries,  the"
"weapons used to inflict the same and injuries indicated in the post-mortem and other medical"
"reports. The murderous intention of the accused could not have been deduced in any effective"
"way owing to the evidence given by PW 10. It was explained that the deceased had sustained"
"eighteen ghastly injuries, including the very first, which resulted the head of the deceased to be"
"severed from the rest of his body. It was observed that all injuries were inflicted, on vital parts of"
"the body, mainly by cutting and stabbing and the wounds were gravely deep that some of the"
"internal  organs  had  popped  out  of  the  body  of  the  deceased.  There  were  wounds  that  had,"
"entered the chest cavity and blows that had pierced the skull of the deceased."
"Section  300  of  the  Penal  Code  indicates  the  following  with  regard  to  constituting  attempt  to"
"murder."
"“Whoever, does any act with such intention or knowledge and under such circumstances"
"that if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder…”"
"The  Court  of  Appeal  in  England  in  R  vs.  Mohan  [1975]  All  ER  193  CA  defines  mens  rea  in"
"attempting any offence as;"
"“a decision to bring about, in so far as it lies within the accused’s power… (the relevant"
"consequence) whether the accused desired the consequence or not.”"
"PW 10 in his evidence had further stated that PW 1 and PW 2 had sustained deep cut and stab"
"injuries respectively with  serious wounds on the stomach which, under natural circumstances"
"would have caused death. Therefore, a reasonable person can objectively draw an inference that,"
"the accused when inflicting those wounds, at least had knowledge that death would have been"
"virtually certain and had they died he would have been guilty of murder."
"The question then to be considered is whether the 1st accused-appellant together with the other"
"accused-appellants  shared,  the  common  murderous  intention  and  in  relation  to  attempt  to"
"murder, the common specific intention. The applicable law to establish common intention under"
"section 32 of the Penal Code states thus:"
"‘When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention"
"of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by"
"him alone.’"
"The developments of the law relating to section 32 of the Penal code was essayed in the case of"
"W.M.M.  Kumarihami  vs  Galagamage  Indrawansa  Kumarasiri  and  3  Others  S.C.  TAB  Appeal"
"No.02/2012 and the following guidelines were listed."
