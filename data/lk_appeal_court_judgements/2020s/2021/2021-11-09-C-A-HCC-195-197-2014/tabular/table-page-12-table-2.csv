"Testimony of PW1 had been to a great extent consistent within itself and with the rest of the"
"eye-witness accounts and other circumstantial evidence in relation to causing the death of"
"the deceased and causing hurt to PW1 and PW2 which were without any doubt crucial facts"
"that determined the guilt of the accused-appellants and seemed to have stood the test of"
"cross-examination with regard to the same crucial facts. Nothing in his evidence suggested"
"that he was insincere or unwilling to speak the truth."
"In the light of the gruesome nature and the gravity of the offences committed nothing had"
"been brought before the learned High Court Judge by the defence that hints at the issue of"
"false implications prior to giving statements from the dock apart from blanket denials at the"
"commencement of the trial. Therefore, at this stage stressing over trivial contradictions that"
"do not bend the basis upon which the prosecution had formed its case is futile."
"For  the  reasons  aforesaid,  having  regard  to  the  facts  of  the  present  case  and  relevant"
"principles  of  law  upon  which  the  above  convictions  had  been  based,  there  is  no  error"
"committed by the learned High Court Judge and therefore, the convictions and the sentences"
"are affirmed."
"Appeal dismissed."
