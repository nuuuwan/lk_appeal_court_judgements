"“Any  error  in  stating  either  the  offence  or the particulars  required to  be  stated  in the"
"charge and any omission to state the charge or those particulars shall not be regarded at"
"any stage of the case as material, unless the accused were misled by the error or omission.”"
"The accused were present in Court, when the indictment had been read to and understood by"
"the accused at the commencement of the trial and throughout the proceedings during which the"
"prosecution extensively led evidence in relation to the charges aforementioned. With reference"
"to the provision stated above, there is little to no room for the accused to be misled in any which"
"way  in  raising  their  defence  for  the  offences  committed  by  being  members  of  an  unlawful"
"assembly despite the omission of the phrase ‘with those unknown to the prosecution."
"The American case, Hagner vs. United States of America (1931) 76 Law Ed 861: (285 US 427) held"
"that the necessary facts must be set out in the charge in order to give the accused,"
"“notice of the matter in which he is charged’ and the true test of sufficiency of indictment"
"is whether ‘it contains the elements of the offence intended to be charged and sufficiently"
"apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.”"
"In Berger vs. United States of America (1934) 79 Law Ed 1314: (295 US 78) it was observed that;"
"“the accused shall be definitely informed as to the charges against him so that he may be"
"enabled to present his defence and not be taken by surprise by the evidence offered at"
"the trial.”"
