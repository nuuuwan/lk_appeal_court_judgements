"more than five people excluding the 4th accused and including the three accused-appellants, the"
"5th accused, one Chuti Suji and others were present at the scene when the incident in question"

"To ascertain whether a person was a member of an unlawful assembly section 139 of the Penal"
"Code provides the following;"
"“Whoever,  being  aware  of  the  facts  which  render  any  assembly  an  unlawful  assembly,"
