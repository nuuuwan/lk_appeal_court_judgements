"Kirinaide cannot be considered. Baby Nona was granted a Permit for reasons best known to the"
"authorities, and she became the Permit holder."
"S
ection 48A of the Land Development Ordinance reads as follows: -"
"(1)  Upon the death of a  Permit holder who at the time of his or her death was required to pay"
"any annual instalments by virtue of provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 19, notwithstanding"
"default in the payment of such instalments, the spouse of that Permit holder whether he or she"
"has or has not been nominated as successor by that Permit holder, shall be entitled to succeed"
"to the land alienated to that Permit holder on the permit and the terms and conditions of that"
"permit shall be applicable to that spouse."
"T
he argument of the 1st, 2nd and the 5th Respondents was based on the above Section.  Since the"
"Section speaks that the spouse is entitled to get the permit in her name subject to conditions that"
"Baby Nona had only the life interest, if that argument is to be accepted, it should appear in the"
"grant marked as [P1A].  [P1A] is not a Permit.  It is a Grant without any encumbrances."
"A
rguments of the Respondents were that a nomination need not be registered.  Well, in that"
"case, the grant should specify conditions.  Since no conditions are stipulated in the grant, the"
"court will accept that Baby Nona owns Lot 342 in Final Village Plan No.172.  She died without"
"nominating a successor.  Therefore, Malani cannot be nominated as a successor to the said land."
"T
he  requirement  further  strengthens  that  registration  of  lands  in  land  registry  is  to  carry  a"
"pedigree of a land. Anyone may peruse and be satisfied with the owner and how he became the"
"owner of any encumbrances attached to the land."
"T
herefore, since no endorsement is available, the conclusion that one can reach on perusal of"
"the Land Registry is that Baby Nona is the owner of the said Lot. Even if Kirinaide nominated"
"Malani as his successor with his death without registering the permit and leaving no Last will,"
"Malani's nomination gets cancelled.  Section 58(1) specify that such nomination of life holder"
"will not be valid unless and until the Registrar of Lands has registered it."
