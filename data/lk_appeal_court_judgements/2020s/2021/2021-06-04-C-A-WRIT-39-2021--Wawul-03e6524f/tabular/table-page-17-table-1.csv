"t is in that context that Chief Justice G.P.S. De Silva held as follows:",""
"","“Mr.  H.L.  De  Silva,  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  words  “as  a  holding"
"","operation”  in  Section  2(3)  of  the  Statute  were  designedly  used  as  a  limiting"
"","factor  on  the  power  of  suspension;  that  those  words  envisage  a  crisis  or  an"
"","emergency  in  the  administration  of  the  Council.  On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  L.C."
"Seneviratne 
for 
the 
respondent,  strenuously  contended 
that  on","the  plain"
"","meaning of  the words, the  construction sought to be  placed by  Mr.  De  Silva is"
"","untenable; that there is nothing in the statute which warrants the restriction of"
"the  making  of  an  order  of  suspension  to  a  “crisis”  or  “emergency”","in  the"
"","administration  of  the  Council.  Mr.  Seneviratne  argued  that  the  words  “as  a"
"","holding operation” mean no more than suspension pending inquiry as a matter"
"of good administration.",""
