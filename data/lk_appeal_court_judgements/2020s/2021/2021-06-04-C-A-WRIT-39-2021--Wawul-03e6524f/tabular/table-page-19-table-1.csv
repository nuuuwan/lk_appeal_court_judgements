"provides  a  mechanism  by  way  of  Section  185 
to  address 
incompetence,"
"mismanagement,  misconduct  and  abuse  of  power  and  thereby  ensure  good"
"governance by empowering the Minister to suspend and/or remove a member,"
"Chairman or dissolve even an entire local council."
"T
he legislature however has been conscious that the powers of suspension and"
"removal  of  a  member,  conferred  on 
the  Minister  by  Section  185  of 
the"
"Pradeshiya Sabha Act can be abused. The provisions in Section 185(1)-(3) of the"
"Act  seeks  to strike  a balance  between  the  powers  of  the Minister  to deal with"
"mismanagement  and  abuse  of  power  on  the  one  hand  and  the  rights  of  the"
"Chairman  to  protect  himself  from  any  arbitrary  exercise  of  that  power  by  the"
"Minister, on the other. As part of this process, several checks and balances have"
"been set out in Section 185 of the Act."
"T
he Act specifies that a suspension can be effected only once an Inquiry Officer"
"has been appointed. The Act requires the Minister to appoint a retired Judicial"
"Officer  to  inquire  into  such  mismanagement,  inefficiency  and  abuse  of  power,"
"thereby  demonstrating 
the 
seriousness  with  which 
the 
inquiry  must  be"
"conducted and the credibility that is attached to the inquiry. In keeping with the"
"principles  of  administrative  law,  the  Inquiry  Officer  is  required  to  provide  both"
"parties an opportunity to lead the necessary oral and documentary evidence to"
"substantiate  the  charges  as  well  as  rebut  the  charges,  thus  ensuring  that  the"
"principles  of  a  fair  hearing  are  adhered  to  at  all  times  during  the  inquiry.  The"
"Inquiry Officer is required to submit a report within a period of three months of"
"being  appointed,  to  enable  the  Minister  to  satisfy  himself  with  regard  to  the"
"allegations against the Chairman, the member or the Council itself. As held by"
"the Supreme Court in Sarath Dharma Siri Bandara vs. Sarath Ekanayake17, the"
"Minister cannot remove the Chairman on his own accord and the report of the"
"Inquiry Officer is necessary for the Minister to take a decision. The entire process"
"outlined  above  must  therefore  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  is  fair  by  all"
