"I
  agree  that  a  suspension  must  not  be 
imposed  as  a  means  of  punishment  or"
"expulsion,  and  that  the 
inquiry  must  be  conducted  expeditiously  with  the  co-"
"operation  of  both  parties.  In  this  instance,  the  inquiry  has  not  even  commenced  in"
"view  of  the  undertaking  given  that  the  parties  will  await  the  outcome  of  this"
"application. Once the inquiry is commenced by the 5th Respondent and in the event"
"an  extension  of  time 
is  sought  at  the  end  of  the  three  month  period,  the  1st"
"Respondent must ascertain the necessity for such an extension and why the inquiry"
"could  not  be  concluded  within  three  months,  and  thereafter  consider  whether  the"
"suspension of the Petitioner must continue, prior to arriving at a decision."
