"to  the  correct  findings  of  fact  and  had  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  1st  Respondent  was"
"dispossessed by the 1st Appellant on the date the dispute arose among the parties."
"I
n this instance, Court observes that the documents 2ව14-2ව28 submitted by the 1st Appellant"
"are the letters obtained from various people to establish that the 1st Appellant had been running"
"a Three-wheeler repairing garage at the disputed premises. Since it was established that the 1st"
"Appellant had not been carrying on a business, running a Three-wheeler repairing garage, it is"
"seen that there is no evidentiary value of those letters 2ව14-2ව28."
"T
hus, it seems that those letters were obtained by the 1st Appellant for the sake of getting an"
"advantage in the instant Case in his favour."
"A
pparently, upon the evidence placed before the Primary Court Judge, it is patently clear that"
"the facts of the instant case are properly evaluated in the correct perspective thus the Order of"
"the Primary Court Judge is well-founded."
"A
s such, it is not necessary to interfere with the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge,"
"who affirmed the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge."
"I
n view of the aforesaid factual and legal matrix, I uphold the impugned Orders of the learned"
"Primary Court Judge dated 27.04.2011 and the learned High Court Judge dated 04.10.2013."
"Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed with costs."
