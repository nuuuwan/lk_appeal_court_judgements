"to the 1st Appellant. Nevertheless it was transferred to his sister the said Respondent Ariyawathi"

"Appellant  attempted  to  dig  the  ground  and  put-up  poles  to  build  a  Garage  to  repair  three-"
"wheelers on 23.11.2010. Thus, it is apparent that the possession of the land in dispute was with"
"the said Piyadasa Munasinghe and the 1st Respondent Ariyawathi Munasinghe until the dispute"
"arose on 21.11.2010."
"T
he  said  position  was  clearly  established  by  the  observation  notes  dated  21.11.2010  of  the"

"a bare land, 1 Perch in extent and the 1st Appellant [සජී] was engaged in a construction, digging"
"the ground and setting up poles."
