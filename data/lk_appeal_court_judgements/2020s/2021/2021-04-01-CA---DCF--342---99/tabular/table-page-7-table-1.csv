"The learned District Judge, in terms of the oral and documentary evidence"
"adduced, has allotted shares of the subject matter to the co-owners2."
"I  shall  now  consider  the  grounds  of  appeal  advanced  by  the  foregoing"
"Defendants against the impugned judgment."
"The appeal filed by the  12th Defendant (Appeal No.  CA/DCF/340/99):"
"The  12th  Defendant h as  been allotted  224/3840  shares in  the impugned"
"judgment. The contention of the  12th Defendant was that she is entitled to"
"an undivid ed  352/3840 shares ."
"Although 
the  12th  Defendant  claims  352/3840  shares,  she 
failed 
to"
"buttress  that  claim  with  satisfactory  evidence.  The  written  submissions"
"and  the  Petition  of  Appeal  of  the  12th  Defendant  do  not  disclose 
the"
"manner in wh ich she is en titled to  352/3840 shares."
"According  to  the  evidence  adduced,  it  is  we ll  established  that  the  12th"
"Defendant  is  entitled 
to  224/3840  shares  by  virtue  of  the  title  Deeds"
"marked  12V2  and  12V3  (rights  of Hathankira).  Thus ,  the  appeal  of the"
"12th  Defendant is not sustainable."
"The 
appeal 
filed 
by 
the 
65 th 
Defendant 
(Appeal 
No."
"CA/DCF /342/99):"
"Admittedly,  the 65th  Defendant was not a  co-owner to  the subject matter"
"at  the  time  of  the  institution  of  this  case.  During  the  pendency  of  the"
"instant  partition  action,  after  a 
long  period  of  time,  34  years  from 
the"
"institution  of the  said  action,  the 65th  Defendant  h as purchased  certain"
"rights from the 27th Defendant by Deed bearing No.  579 dated 08.12 .1 994."
"Now,  it is settled law tha t  in partion actions,  those who  purchased rights"
"after  the  registration  of  the 
lis-pendent are  not  entitled  to  be  added  as"
"parties to a  partition action ."
