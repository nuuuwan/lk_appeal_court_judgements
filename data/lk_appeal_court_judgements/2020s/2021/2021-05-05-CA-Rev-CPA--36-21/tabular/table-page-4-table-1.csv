"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  observed  that  the  order  regarding  the"
"arbitration award made on 14.5.12, which declared that the said award was"
"not  a  forgery  had  been  made  by  a  civil  court  and  the  criminal  court  is  not"
"bound by the said order. But the position of the petitioner is that since the"
"Supreme  Court  has  dismissed  the  leave  to  appeal  application,  the  learned"
"High Court Judge is bound by the same."
"The Counsel appearing for the respondents raised two preliminary objections"
"on issuing notices, they are,"
"1) The petitioner had not added the parties to the caption of the petitioner"
"referred to in the petition,"
"2)  The  petitioner  had  filed  an  appeal  against  the  instant  impugned  order"
"therefore the instant application for revision is redundant."
"Upon perusal of the petition the petitioner has made references to the Board"
"of Investments but the same had not been added as a party. But this court"
"observes the petitioner had not sought any relief from the BOI."
"Secondly  the  petitioner  concedes  that  he  has  filed  an  appeal  against  the"
"impugned judgment, therefore this court has to consider whether a party can"
"file  a  revision  and  an  appeal  simultaneously.  Hence  at  this  point  this  court"
"would very briefly state the difference between an appeal and a revision. It is"
"trite  law  that  revision  is  a  discretionary  power  of  court  and  an  appeal  is  a"
"statutory right of a party. Therefore when the right of appeal is provided by"
"statute the question is, can  a party file a revision application as well. It has"
"been held in ,K.W.Ranjith Samarasinghe  vs.  K.W. Wilbert CA (PHC) 127/99"
"by  Abrew  J.  that  â€œit  is  well  established  principle  that  a  party  who  has  an"
"alternative  remedy  can  invoke  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  a  superior  court"
