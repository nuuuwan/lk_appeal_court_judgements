"only upon establishment of exceptional circumstances.‚Äù The same has been"
"held in Rustom vs. Hapangama 78-79 NLR 225."
"Therefore 
it 
is  very  clear  that  when  a  right  of  appeal 
lies 
if  a  revision"
"application 
is 
filed 
the  petitioner  has 
to 
satisfy  court 
that 
there  are"
"exceptional  circumstances.  The  exceptionality 
in  the 
instant  matter,  the"
"petitioner  urges  is  that  the  document  upon  which  the  entire  prosecution"
"case 
lies  has  been  held 
to  be  a  genuine  document  by  a  parallel  civil"
"jurisdiction,  and  the  relevant  leave  to  appeal  application  by  the  Supreme"
"Court has been dismissed and therefore the learned High Court Judge had no"
"jurisdiction to hear and determine the case."
"The learned High Court Judge has very correctly held that the criminal court"
"is not bound by an order of a civil court , and also the dismissal of the leave"
"to  appeal  application in  the  Supreme  Court has  been  based    based  only  on"
"the  appealable  time  period  pertaining  to  the  Arbitration  Act  no  11  of  1995"
"and had not gone in to the validity of the document referred to in the instant"
"matter,  hence  this  court 
is  unable  to  agree  with  the  submissions  of  the"
"learned  Presidents  Counsel 
that 
the 
learned  High  Court 
Judge  had  no"
"jurisdiction to hear and determine the trial in the instant case."
"Therefore upon consideration of the above submissions of the petitioner and"
"the respondents on the preliminary objection, this court decides not to issue"
"notices in the instant application."
"Therefore the instant application is dismissed."
