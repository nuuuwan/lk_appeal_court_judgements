"Corporation,  AIR  1953  Cal.  581  and  Parraju  v.  General  Manager  B.N.  Rly.  AIR  1952"
"Cal. 610.‚Äù."
"Therefore, this court takes the view that the questions raised by the Petitioners can be"
"easily  and  effectively  canvassed  at  the  inquiry  which  is  to  be  held  at  the  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs. Even if the court decides to issue notice in this matter the court will have to"
"determine  the  legality  of  the  relevant  decisions  only  upon  the  averments  contained  in"
"the Petition. However, the facts disclosed in the averments of the Petition are in dispute"
"and  those  facts  are  going  to  be  investigated  by  another  forum/tribunal.  This  court  is"
"unable  to  decide  the  legality  of  those  decisions  without  going  into  questions  of  fact"
"involved  in  this  case.  Accordingly,  the  Petitioners  have  made  a  premature  application"
"before this court and have failed to establish a prima facie case."
"In the circumstances, we refuse to issue notice and dismiss this application."
