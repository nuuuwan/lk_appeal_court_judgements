"Provided  further  that  if  such  mortgagee  or  person  aforesaid  claims  under  an"
"instrument executed more than fifteen years prior to the institution of the action, he shall"
"not be a necessary party to such action, unless he has registered an address for service of"
"legal documents in terms of the aforesaid provisions of the Mortgage Act within a period"
"of ten years prior to the date of institution of the action.‚Äù"
"Therefore, in the case of a mortgage, the plaintiff should make the mortgagee or any other"
"person who claims any interest under the mortgage, a party to the action only if an address"
"is registered for service of legal documents in terms of the provisos to the section 5 of the"
"Partition Law."
"In  terms  of  section  6  (1)  of  the  Mortgage  Act,  No.  6  of  1949  (the  Mortgage  Act)"
"application for the registration of an address for the service of legal documents should be"
"made substantially in the form set out in the First Schedule to the Mortgage Act and in"
"terms of section 6 (2) of the Mortgage Act, the address for service should be registered in"
"or in continuation of the folio in which is registered the mortgage of the land in respect of"
"which the applicant has an interest."
"The  folios  of  the  Land  Registry  in  which  the  transactions  over  the  land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned in the instant case are registered were tendered to the Court marked as P9, P9a"
"and P9b. Nevertheless, it cannot be observed that in those folios the address/addresses of"
"the mortgagee or the Petitioners were registered as the address/addresses which the legal"
"documents could be served on them in terms of section 6 of the Mortgage Act. Under such"
"circumstances, it is quite clear that the mortgagee or the Petitioners had failed to act in"
"terms of section 6 of the Mortgage Act and therefore, in terms of section 5 of the Partition"
"Law, they cannot be considered as necessary parties to the partition action."
"For the reasons mentioned above, the Court cannot agree with the argument of the learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioners that non-inclusion of the Petitioners as parties to the partition"
"action is a violation of the provisions of section 12 (1) of the Partition Law, which makes"
"the entire proceedings, judgement and the interlocutory decree a nullity."
