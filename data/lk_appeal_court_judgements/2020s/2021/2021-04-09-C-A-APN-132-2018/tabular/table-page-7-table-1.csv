"respectively  to  the  22.03.2015, the day on  which both  parties  allege that  they  had been"
"dispossessed by the opposing party and when the police intervened  and restored the 2nd"
"Respondent back in possession on that day, he had been restored in possession exclusively"
"in the hotel ejecting the 1st Respondent from the possession of the hotel. Therefore, I hold"
"that the 1st Respondent is entitled to the possession of the hotel and the 2nd Respondent is"
"entitled to the possession of a room of the hotel."
"The wisdom of the legislature by enacting the provisions in Part VII of the Act is preventing"
"the breaches of peace arising from land disputes. Therefore, if the Court holds that the 2nd"
"Respondent is entitled to possess a room in the hotel which the 1st Respondent is entitled"
"to possess, there would be practical difficulties in exercising their rights and the threat to"
"the maintenance of peace between the parties would continue. Therefore, it is appropriate"
"to conclude that the party who has the title to the property is entitled to possess the property."

"and the 1st Respondent has produced his title deeds of the property (marked as X and X1)"
"and the Certificate of Business Registration of the hotel (marked as X2) issued in his name"
"under the Companies Act."
"After considering all the above stated facts, I hold that the determination of the learned"
"Magistrate that the 1st Respondent is entitled to possess the property in dispute, Lihiniya"
"Beach Hotel and the order made by the learned High Court Judge refusing to issue notices"
"on the revision application on the 1st Respondent are according to the facts of the case and"
"the law. Even though, the manner which this Court has analysed the evidence of the case"
"is different in the manner which the learned Magistrate has analysed the evidence, there is"
"no difference between the conclusions of both Courts. Therefore, no prejudice has been"
"caused to the parties in the manner which the evidence has been analysed by the learned"
"Magistrate. Considering all the above stated facts, I hold that the impugned order dated"
