"on the date of filing the information under section 66. When the dispute relates to right of"
"possession of a property, if the primary court judge is satisfied that the person who had"
"been in possession of the property has been dispossessed within a period of two months"
"prior to the information was filed, in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Act, he should decide"
"as to which party is entitled to the possession of the property."
"In the instant action the respective parties are not at variance, that the 2nd Respondent was"
"in possession of the hotel on the date of filling the information in Court on 20.05.2015. The"
"position of the 1st Respondent is that the 2nd Respondent had occupied a room in the hotel"
"since January 2015 and even though, he was accompanied and dropped him to a nearby"
"hotel  with  his  consent  on  22.03.2015.  by  the  1st Respondent,  on  the  same  day  with  the"
"assistance  of  police  the  2nd  Respondent  forcibly  reentered  into  the  hotel  in  dispute  and"
"acquired  possession  of  the  hotel  ejecting  the  1st  Respondent.  The  position  of  the  2nd"
"Respondent is that after executing the document marked as “2 පා 5” on 10.02.2015, the 1st"

"forcibly  dispossessed  by  the  1st  Respondent  on  22.03.2015.  he  was  in  the  exclusive"
"possession  of  the  hotel.  Accordingly,  both  parties  claim  that  they  have  independently"

"information has been filed on 20.05.2015. and the position of both parties has been that"
"they lost the possession on 23.05.2015, the learned Magistrate has correctly held that the"
"Court should make a determination under Section 68 (3) of the Act."
"The  parties  do  not  dispute  the  fact  that  on  the  date  of  filing  the  information,  the  2nd"
"Respondent was in possession of the hotel. The 1st Respondent claims inter alia, that he"
"was in possession of the hotel, the 2nd Respondent had occupied a room in the hotel as a"
"guest  and  after  the  2nd  Respondent  had  defaulted  to  pay  the  hotel  charges  the  he  had"
