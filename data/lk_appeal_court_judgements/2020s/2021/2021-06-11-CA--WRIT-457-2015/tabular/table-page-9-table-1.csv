"The  13
Amendment to  the Constitution refers to State Land and Land in  two"
"different and distinct places. In my view the entirety of State Land is referred to"
"in List II (Reserved List) and it is only from this germinal origin that the Republic"
"could  assign  to  the  Provincial  Councils  land  for  whatever  purposes  which  are"
"deemed  appropriate.  It 
is  therefore  axiomatic  that  the  greater 
includes  the"
"lesser (Omne majus continent in se minus) and having regard to the fact that in"
"a unitary  state  of  government no cession  of  dominium takes place, the  Centre"
"has not ceded its dominium over State Lands to the Provincial Councils except in"
"some limited circumstances as would appear later in the judgment."

"State can make grants absolutely and more often it does so provisionally with"
"conditions  attached  or  by  way  of  leases,  permits,  licenses  as  per  provisions"
"governing  disposition  of  state  lands.  Such  conveyances  can  be  made  by  the"
"State  to  any  person/organization  entitled  to  hold  land  including  Provincial"
"Councils.  All  this  partakes  of  the  dominium  that  the  State  enjoys 
in  having"
"ownership  and 
its  attendant 
incidents  of  ownership  such  as 
its  use  and"
"consistent  with 
these 
characteristics 
it 
is  pertinent 
to  observe 
that 
the"
"Constitution  unequivocally  in  List  II  and  in  Appendix  II  has  placed  State  Lands"
"with the Centre, “Except to extent specified in item 18 of List I” [quoted from List"
"II]. Thus the Constitution as far as State Land is concerned traverses from List II"
"via List I to final destination Appendix II."
