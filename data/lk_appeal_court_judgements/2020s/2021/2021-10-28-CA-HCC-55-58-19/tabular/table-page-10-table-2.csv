"has come to such a favourable finding in favour of witness Nandasena as"
"regards to his testimonial trustworthiness and credibility.‚Äù"
"I do not find any basis to conclude that PW-03 was not an independent witness"
"as claimed. It is very much clear from her evidence that she has spoken about"
"what  she  has  seen  on  that  fateful  day. She  has  testified  that  she  rejected  the"
"advances made by the 1st appellant to marry her daughter, but it is abundantly"
"clear in the way she has given her evidence, she was not a partisan witness. On"
"the  contrary,  I  find  that  it  may  be  the  very  reason  for  the  1st  appellant  and"
"others to attack her house and use foul language on her, although their initial"
"dispute was with someone else."
"The  evidence  of  PW-03  has  been  corroborated  by  the  evidence  of  the  JMO,"
"which confirms her evidence as to the injuries sustained by the deceased. The"
"Police  evidence  as  to  the  observations  of  the  crime  scene  are  also  clearly"
"corroborative as to the truthfulness and credibility of the evidence of PW-03."
"For  the  reasons  as  discussed  above,  I  find  no  basis  in  the  ground  of  appeal"
"urged on behalf of the 1st and the 2nd appellant."
"Grounds of appeal of the 3rd and the 4th appellants: -"
"The  trial  of  this  case  has  commenced  on  14-03-2012  and  the  evidence  of  the"
"two main witnesses, namely, PW-03 and PW-05 has been concluded. However,"
"when the case resumed for further trial on 11-06-2012, there had been no legal"
"representation for the 3rd appellant, which has resulted in the appointment of"
"an assigned counsel through the state expense on his behalf. It is correct that"
"the  assigned  counsel  has  not  been  given  time  to  get  ready  before  leading"
"further  evidence  on  that  day,  nor  has  it  been  requested.  However,  I  find  that"
"this  irregularity  has  not  caused  any  material  prejudice  to  the  3rd  appellant,"
