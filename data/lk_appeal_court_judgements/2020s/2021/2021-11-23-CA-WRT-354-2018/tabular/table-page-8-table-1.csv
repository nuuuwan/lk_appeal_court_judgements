"Therefore, the award of the arbitrator is arbitrary and ultra vires."
"In the case of Hatton National Bank Limited Vs Kiran Atapattu and another S.C"
"Appeal No. 38-39/06 decided on 25.06.2013, Saleem Marsoof J held thus:-"
"“secondly, where there is a valid agreement to refer the dispute for arbitration, but"
"the arbitrators in making their award exceed the scope of the dispute so referred"
"for arbitration, that is, where the resulting award relates to differences beyond the"
"ambit  of  the  mandate  of  the  arbitrators,  the  award  may  be  set  aside  or 
its"
"enforcement may be refused for want of jurisdiction”."
"Therefore, a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari has to be issued to quash"
"the  Government  Gazette 
(Extraordinary)  bearing  No.  2047/20  dated  28th"
"November  2017  containing  the  award  of  the  arbitrator  and  the  government"
"Gazette No. 2087/78 dated 6th September 2018 contains the amended award after"
"the interpretation of the original award."
"In view of the above conclusion, it will only be an academic exercise to go into the"
"question whether the reference to the arbitrator for an interpretation of the award"
"was out of time and the one month period specified in the Act is mandatory."
"For the abovementioned reasons, we issue a mandate in the nature of  a writ of"
"certiorari quashing the Government Gazette (Extraordinary) bearing No. 2047/20"
"dated 28th November 2017 and the Government Gazette (Extraordinary) bearing"
"No. 2087/78 dated 6th September 2018."
