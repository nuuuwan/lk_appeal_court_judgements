"the 3rd Respondent Commissioner of Labour had sought for an interpretation from"
"the arbitrator with regard to the amount awarded to the 6th Respondent for her"
"pecuniary loss. At the aforesaid inquiry before the 5th Respondent, the Attorney-"
"at-Law  for  the  Petitioner  had  objected  to  the  procedure  on  the  basis  that  the"
"reference for the interpretation was out of time as an interpretation shall be sought"
"within  1  month  of  the  award  in  terms  of  Section  15  of  the  Industrial  Disputes"
"(Hearing and Determination of Proceedings) (Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 2003"
"and the 3rd Respondent had sought for the interpretation after a lapse of more than"
"7 months from the award."
"The 5th Respondent had given his interpretation on 27.07.2018 awarding the 6th"
"Respondent the amount mentioned in her Written Submissions."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the one month"
"time  period  stipulated 
in  Section  15  of  the 
Industrial  Disputes  (Hearing  and"
"Determination  of  Proceedings) 
(Special  Provisions)  Act  No.  13  of  2003 
is"
"mandatory."
"Section 15 of the said Act reads as follows:-"
"15  “A  reference  under  section  34  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act  relating  to  the"
"interpretation of any award or order made by an arbitrator, Labour Tribunal or the"
"Industrial Court as the case may be, may be made within one month of the date of"
"making of such award or order and it shall be the duty  of the arbitrator, Labour"
"Tribunal or Industrial Court as the case may be, to which such reference is being"
"made,  to  hear  and  determine  such  reference  within  one  month  of  the  date  of"
"receipt of such reference.”"
"It is the submission of the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner that even"
"though in that section it is stated that a reference relating to interpretation “may"
"be” made within one month of the date of the award, the words “may be” are used"
"because 
seeking 
an 
interpretation 
is 
optional. 
Therefore, 
the 
learned"
"President’sCounsel submitted that even though an interpretation “may be” sought"
"if  necessary,such  reference  shall  be  made  within  one  month  of  the  date  of  the"
"award. He further submitted that even though the other time periods specified in"
"the  said  Act  may  not  be  mandatory,  when  a  time  period  is  stipulated  to  take  a"
"certain step such as seeking an interpretation within one month from the date of"
"the award, such time periods are mandatory."
