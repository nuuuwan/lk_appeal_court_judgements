"provisions  when  the  Privy  Council  stated  that  the  general  deduction"
"provisions in Section 10 (1) read with the prohibition of deduction in Section"
"12 (1) (b) did not negative or fetter or take away the deduction which has"
"been expressly provided by Section 10 (1) (f)."
"[70] The learned Senior State Counsel, however, sought to argue that the"
"provision in Section 10 (1) (f) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Trinidad and"
"Tobago is not identical to Section 25 (1) (k) of the present case and thus, the"
"judgment 
in  Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income Tax,"
"Trinidad & Tobago  (supra)  can  be  distinguished  from  the  facts  of  the"
"present case."
"[71] It is true that the specific deduction provision in Section 10 (1) (f), which"
"relates  to  the  deduction  of  annuities  or  other  annual  payments  is  not"
"identical to Section 25 (1) (k) of our Inland Revenue Act. But, Section 26 (2)"
"of our Act  is similar to Section 12 (1)  (b) of the Income  Tax Ordinance of"
"Trinidad and Tobago.  It is not disputed, however, that Section 10 (1) of the"
"Income  Tax  Ordinance  of  Trinidad  and  Tobago 
is 
identical 
to 
the"
"corresponding Section 25 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka, which"
"specifies the general deduction rule."
"[72] The Privy Council however dismissed the appeal on different grounds."
"The  Privy  Council  was  of  the  view  that  the  payments  to  the  trust  for  the"
"maintenance  and  benefits  of  a 
taxpayerâ€™s 
children  are  within 
the"
"prohibition  of  Section  12  (1)  (b)  which  prohibits  any  disbursements  or"
"expenses not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for"
"the purpose of acquiring the income."
"[73] It is not in dispute that Section 12 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of"
"Trinidad  and  Tobago  relates  to  the 
limitation  to  a  general  deduction"
"provision in Section 10 (1), which prohibits deductions spelled out in Section"
"10 (1). The principle emanating from this analysis is that while the general"
"deduction  rule 
is  restricted  by  the  prohibition  of  deduction  rule,  any"
"deduction provision which has been expressly provided by any statute is"
"not taken away by the general prohibition of deduction."
