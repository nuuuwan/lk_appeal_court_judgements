"the production of profits or income the section specifically mentions"
"other outgoings. The word “outgoings” in this context, must be"
"construed as outgoings other than those specifically mentioned. ....”"
"[23] Apart from the outgoings as deductions, a taxpayer can also rely on"
"the  expenses 
incurred 
in  the  production  of 
income  to  be  claimed  as"
"deductions,  which  are  all  outgoings  but  all  outgoings  are  not  expenses"
"incurred in the production of the profits or income. Based on the reasoning"
"of Basnayake, C.J. in Hayley and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland"
"Revenue  (supra),  stated  that  the  term  “outgoing”  is  wider  than  the  term"
"“expense” and while the word “expense” is limited by the words “incurred"
"in  the  production  of  the  profits  or  income”,  the  word  “outgoing”  is  not"
"limited by those words."
"[24] On the analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case, Basnayake,"
"C.J.,  held  that  while  the  loss  suffered  by  burglary  was  not  an  expense"
"incurred in producing the profits of the business, the loss was an outgoing"
"deductible  under  Section  9 
(1) 
in  ascertaining  the  profits  or 
income."
"Sinnetamby, J. in the same case, while agreeing that the word “outgoing” is"
"wider  than  the  term  “expense”,  stated  that 
it  must  not  be 
limited  to"
"voluntary payments, but would also include involuntary outgoings such as"
"petty theft by subordinates  (p. 177). Sinnetamby, J.  stated however,  that"
"the  “outgoings”  must  be  of  such  a  nature  as  would  come  within  the"
"meaning of the expression “incurred in the production of profits” (supra)."
"Sinnetamby, J. held that the loss suffered by the assessee must be regarded"
