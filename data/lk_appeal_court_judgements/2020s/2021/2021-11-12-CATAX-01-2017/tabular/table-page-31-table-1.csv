"rental  in  respect  of  vehicles  under  certain  circumstances.  This  enabled  a"
"taxpayer or a person in his employment to include rental or other rental"
"payment in respect of such vehicles under proviso (i) if the rental of vehicles"
"was  included  in  the  remuneration  of  the  employees,  PAYE  tax  had  been"
"deducted and remitted to the Inland Revenue Department."
"[82]  By  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act  No.  9  of  2008,  the  above-"
"mentioned paragraph (v) of section 25 (1) (k) was repealed, containing the"
"word  “lease  rental  or  other  rental” 
in  the  said  proviso.  The  effect  of"
"repealing  rental  or  other  rental  payment  from  the  said  proviso  was  to"
"obliterate rental from the proviso as if it had never existed. The legislature"
"appears to have removed rental or other rental payment in respect of such"
"vehicle or the cost of acquisition of such vehicle to avoid any conflict with"
"Section 26 (2)  so that rental or  annual payment in respect of any vehicle"
"referred  to 
in  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  Section  26  (2)  will  only  be"
"governed by Section 26 (2). As the year of assessment in the present case"
"related to 2009/2010, the parties will be now governed by the proviso to"
"Section 25 (1) (k), without any reference to rental or other rental payment"
"in respect of such vehicle or the cost of acquisition of such vehicle."
