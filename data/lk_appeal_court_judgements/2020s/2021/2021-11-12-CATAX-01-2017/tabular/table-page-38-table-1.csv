"[107] I hold that the judgment in CEI Plastic Limited v. Commissioner of"
"Income  Tax  (supra)  is  not  a  judicial  precedent  to  be  followed  in  the"
"present case as the legal principles upon which that case was decided are"
"not  the  identical  legal  principles  raised  in  the  present  case  except  the"
"meaning of “including” considered in that judgment. As noted, it cannot"
"be  said 
in  the  context  of  the 
legislative 
intention 
indicated 
in  sub-"
"paragraph (i) of the proviso to Section 25 (1) (k) that the word “including”"
"in Section 25 (1) will be equivalent to “mean and include” and thus, Section"
"25 (1) (k) is restricted by the general prohibition deduction rule in Section"
"26 (2) as submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel."
"[108] The Tax Appeals Commission neither considered the principle laid"
"down in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad"
"&
 
Tobago (supra) nor drew attention to the effect of the inclusive clause-"
"word “including”, in Section 25 (1) taking the context in which it is used in"
"the statute. It has totally failed to consider the relationship between the"
"general provision and the specific provision, and construe its meaning as"
"occurring in the body of the statute either to be extensive or exhaustive"
"(mean and include)."
"[109] Articulated in this broad analysis, and read in its proper context, the"
"word “including” at the end of Section 25 (1) is a term of extension and"
"not  a  restrictive  definition. 
In  other  words, 
the  specific  dedication"
"specified in Section 25 (1) (k) is wider than the general deduction formula"
"in the body of Section 25 (1) in the sense, it is not subject to the restrictions"
"on deductibility in Section 26 (2). In other words, Section 26(2) does not"
"neutralise or negate the specific deduction provision in Section 25 (1) (k)"
"unless  a  contrary  intention  is  indicated  in  the  provisions  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act."
"Are restrictions on Section 25 (1) (k) imposed by Section 26 or other"
"provisions of the Act?"
"[110] The rule that when the legislature has provided a specific deduction"
"rule, it is not subject to the restrictions on deductibility will not, however,"
"apply if any, contrary legislative intention is indicated in the Act, such as"
"the use of the expression “notwithstanding anything contained in the Act”"
"or any word that neutralises the effect of any specific deduction rule."
