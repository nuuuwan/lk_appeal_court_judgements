"Trinidad & Tobago (supra) was merely referred to, but the applicability of"
"the ratio in that case was not decided by the Court of Appeal."
"[104] On the other hand,  the Privy Council in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v."
"Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago  (supra)  specifically"
"considered identical issues that arose in the present case. Although the"
"judgment of the Privy Council in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner"
"for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago  (supra)  was  cited  by  both  parties"
"before the Tax Appeals Commission, it has not considered the validity of"
"the  principle  enunciated  by  the  Privy  Council,  which 
is  relevant  and"
"applies  in  interpreting  the  general  and  specific  deduction  rules  in  the"
"present case."
"[105] The scheme of the Act clearly suggests that the word “including” in"
"Section  25  (1)  was  intended  by  the  legislature  to  extend  to  the  specific"
"deduction in Section 25 (1) (k), in addition to all legitimate deductions of"
"expenses 
incurred 
in 
the  production  of 
income.  But 
the  general"
"prohibition of deduction in Section 26 (2) does not neutralise or negate"
"the  specific  deduction  provision 
in  section  25(1)(k)  unless  a  contrary"
"intention is indicated very clearly. In the light of  the discussion above, I"
"come  to  the  irrefutable  conclusion  that  ""including""  in  Section  25  (1)  is"
"extensive and expansive and not restrictive in nature."
"Doctrine of stare decisis"
"[106] The doctrine of stare decisis emanating from in CEI Plastic Limited"
"v
.
 
Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) was raised by the learned Senior"
"State  Counsel.  A  ratio  decidendi  is  the  rule  of  law  on  which  a  judicial"
"decision is based and it is based on the principle that like cases should be"
"decided alike (Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Le Rififi Ltd (1995)"
"STC 103).  The doctrine of stare decisis only involves this, that when a case"
"has been decided in a court, it is only the legal principle or principles upon"
"which that court has so decided that bind courts of concurrent or lower"
"jurisdictions and require them to follow and adopt them when they are"
"relevant  to  the  decision 
in 
later  cases  before  those  courts 
(Ashvlle"
