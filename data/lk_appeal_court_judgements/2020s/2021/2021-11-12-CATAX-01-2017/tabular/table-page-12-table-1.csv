"No. 28  of  1979,  which are identical to  Section 25 (1)  and  26 (1) (g)  of the"
"Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, was of the view that:"
"“Sections 23 (1) and 24 of the Act have to be read together as both"
"provisions apply to the deductibility from the income.  While section 23"
"spells out the permissible expenses, section 24 expressly disallows the"
"whole of part of certain expenses, which if not so prohibited, would be"
"a
l
l
owable. The combined effect of sections 23 and 24 therefore is to"
"d
i
v
i
de all outgoings and expenses into two categories: outgoing"
"expenses which are deductible and not deductible”."
