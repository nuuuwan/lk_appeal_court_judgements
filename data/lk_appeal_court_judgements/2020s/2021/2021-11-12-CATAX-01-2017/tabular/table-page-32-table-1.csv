"General of Inland Revenue (supra):"
"“Sections 23 (1) and 24 of the Act have to be read together as both"
"provisions apply to the deductible from the income. While section 23"
"spells out the permissible expenses, section 24 expressly disallows the"
"whole or part of certain expenses, which, if not so prohibited, would be"
"a

owable deductions. The combined effect of sections 23 and 24"
"therefore is to divide all outgoings and expenses into two categories;"
"outgoing expenses which are deductible and not deductible”."
