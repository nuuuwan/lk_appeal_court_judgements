"the liquidation of a company is not incurred in the production of profits"

"specifically deducted by Section 25 (1) (I)."
"[115]  A  similar  analysis  applies  to  any  expenditure

"formation  of  a  company,  which 
is  one  of  capital  nature,  which

"prohibited  to  be  deducted  under  Section  26  (1)  (h).  The  special  rule  of"
"deduction  in  Section  25  (1)  (l)  however,  permits  such  expenditure  of  a"
"capital nature for the formation of a company despite it being a capital"
"expenditure."
"[116] If the legislature intended to deduct all expenses of a capital nature"
"as  general  deductions  under  Section  26,  there  was  no  need  for  the"
"legislature to specifically deduct other capital expenses in Section 25 (1)"
"(l), unless it is provided in the Act that notwithstanding anything contained"
"in Section 25 (1) (l), the provisions of Section 26 (1) (h) would apply. These"
"examples clearly demonstrate the intention of the legislature that Section"
"26 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act does not prohibit the specific deductions"
"allowed  to  be  deducted  under  the  aforesaid  sub-sections  unless  it  is"
"referred to and restricted by Section 26 (1) or other provisions of the Act."

"of the deduction contained in Section 25 (1) (k) and therefore, it cannot be"

"Nature and Character of Expenses incurred by the Appellant"
"[118] The contention of the learned Senior State Counsel at the hearing"
"was  that  after  the  rental  and  other  rental  payment  were  completely"
"repealed from the scope of the proviso to Section 25 (1) (k) by the Inland"
"Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 9 of 2008, the deduction of rental is now"
"governed by Section 26 (2), which prohibited rental expenses claimed by"
"the Appellant."
"[119] It is now necessary to consider whether the expenses incurred and"
"claimed  by  the  Appellant  fall  within  the  ambit  of  the  deduction  under"
"Section 25 (1) (k) or under the prohibition of deduction under Section 26"
