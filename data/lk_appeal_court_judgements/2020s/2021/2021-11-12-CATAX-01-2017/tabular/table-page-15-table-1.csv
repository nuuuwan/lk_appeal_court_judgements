"not  mean  that  the  text  is  to  be  construed  merely  as  a  piece  of  prose,"
"without  reference  to  its  nature  or  purpose  and  therefore,  as  Holmes  J."
"stated in Lenigh Valley Coal Co. v. Yensavage (218 FR 547, 553), “statutes"
"should  be  construed,  not  as 
theorems  of  Euclid,  but  with  some"
"imagination  of  the  purposes  which 
lie  behind  them”.  The  question"
"whether  the  legislature  intended  to  treat  a  section  to  be  a  general  or"
"special provision has to be discovered by the Court having regard to the"
"context,  purpose  or  object  underlying  the  Act  as  a  whole  rather  than"
"seeking to find express words in a section."
"[40]  In  addition  to  the  general  deductions  (outgoings  and  expenses)"
"specified in Section 25 (1), it has several other sub-sections, referring to"
"several outgoings or expenses that are permitted to be deducted, which"
"the Appellant has described them as “special items of deductions”. Those"
"paragraphs, i.e. (a) to (w), which contain specific items of deductions are"
"all outgoings or expenses within the interpretation adopted by Basnayake"
"C.J.  (p.  175)  and  Sinnetamby,  J.  (p.  177) in Hayley and Company Ltd v."
