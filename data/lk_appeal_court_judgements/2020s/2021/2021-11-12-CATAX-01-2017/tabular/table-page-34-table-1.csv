"Appeals Commission from considering the distinction between the specific"
"deduction in Section 25 (1) (k) and the prohibition of deduction in Section"
"26 (2)."
"[93] However, the Supreme Court in Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of"
"I
n
l
and Revenue (supra) was not invited to consider the interpretation of the"
"Privy  Council  decision 
in  Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for"
"I
ncome Tax, Trinidad & Tobago  (supra)  or  the  relationship  between  any"
"specific  deduction  provision  such  as  Section  25  (1)  (k)  and  the  general"
"prohibition on deduction provision such as Section 26 (2) in the present"
"case."
"[94] 
In  the  present  case,  however,  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  was"
"specifically 
invited  to  consider  whether  Section  25  (1)  (k) 
is  a  specific"
"deduction provision and if so, its relationship and effect with Section 26 (2)."
"In  other  words,  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  was  specifically  invited  to"
"consider whether the general deduction rule is intended to interfere with"
"the  special  deduction  provision  unless  it  manifests  any  other  legislative"
"intent very clearly."
