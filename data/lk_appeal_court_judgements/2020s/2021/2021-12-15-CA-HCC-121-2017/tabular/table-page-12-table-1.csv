"(
1) A criminal charge must be established beyond all reasonable doubt.  In this"
"respect, there is a great difference between civil and criminal cases, because a"
"civil issue has to be proved only by a preponderance of evidence. In a criminal"
"case,  a  Judge  has  not  merely  to  decide  whether  the  prosecution  story  is  the"
"more  probable,  but  whether  or  not  there  has  been  definite  and  convincing"
"proof.    But  neither  in  civil  nor  in  criminal  matters  can  a  Court  act  on  remote"
"probabilities."
