aughter's husband were there. What the appellant says is more probable than"
"the prosecution story in this regard."
"As  per  the  prosecution,  Rs.6,800/-  was  on  the  table  in  the  living  area.    The"
"police  searched  the  house,  all  the  cupboards,  and  drawers.  The  appellant's"
"counsel  suggested  to  PW1  that  the  money  was  taken  from  a  drawer  of  her"
"almirah. What is the necessity for the appellant to keep the money on the table"
"in the living area at 6.45 in the morning? I think the defense position is more"
"probable in this regard. As per the prosecution, there were forty packets on the"
"table  together  with  another  eighty  packets  in  a  bag,  which  was  also  on  the"
"table.    When  it  was  weighed,  the  paper  was  3,000mg,  and  with  the  heroin,  it"
"was  9,000mg.    The  quantity  of  the  heroin  is  6,000mg.  Can  these  all  round"
"figures be co-incidents."
"According to the prosecution, they had weighed the production at a place called"
"Matara Jewellery at Piliyandala.  After weighing, all the 120 packets, they were"
"sealed  in  the  jewellery  shop.  It  could  have  taken  a  considerable  time.  They"
"arrested  the  appellant's  son  at  8.30am  and  handed  over  the  productions  and"
"the  accused,  after  weighing  and  resealing  the  production  at  9.30am,  to  the"
"Piliyandala police station. Their position is that the two suspects were taken to"
"the  jewellery  shop  separately  on  two  occasions,  and  the  productions  were"
"sealed separately. No statement was taken from the manager of that place. At"
"least the name of the manager of the jewellery shop was not in the notes. The"
"time was also inadequate for weighing all the productions, especially if the two"
"suspects  were  taken  to  the  shop  separately.  When  comparing  this  evidence"
"with  the  appellant's  evidence  that  they  had  not  gone  to  a  jewellary  shop,  the"
"appellant's position is probable."
"The  gross  weight  of  the  production  with  the  wrapping  as  per  the  government"
"analysis was 9,380mg.  The weight difference was only 380mg, compared to"
