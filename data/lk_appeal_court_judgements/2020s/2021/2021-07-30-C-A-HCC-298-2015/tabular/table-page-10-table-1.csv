"This  ground  of  appeal  also  fails  as  the  Learned  High  Court  judge  very"
"correctly acted on the overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution."
"Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, we conclude that the"
"prosecution  has  proved  the  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  We  further"
"conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the"
"decision  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Colombo  dated  19/06/2015."
"Hence, we dismiss this appeal."
"Appeal is dismissed."
