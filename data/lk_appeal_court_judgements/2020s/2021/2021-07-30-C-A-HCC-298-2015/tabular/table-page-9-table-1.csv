"Bureau at around 6.50am and reached Kotikawatta at around 7.45am. The"
"informant  had  arrived  there  at  8.30am  and  re-confirmed  the  trafficking  of"
"Heroin  by  the  Appellant.  At  around  13:15  hours  the  informant  had  called"
"PW02 and asked them to  meet him  near Cargills Food City on Gothatuwa"
"Road. The police team came there in five minutes time and PW01 and PW02"
"had  met  the  informant  at  13:25  hours.  The  informant  told  them  that  the"
"Appellant was coming from his house for the business and asked them to be"
"at Galkotuwa Road junction. While waiting there, the informant had shown"
"a  person  coming 
towards  Galkotuwa 
junction  as 
the  Appellant.  After"
"establishing their identity, the Appellant was searched by PW01 and PW02"
"who  found the substance in his possession. He was arrested at 13:50 hours"
"and brought up to their vehicle in a three-wheeler and taken to his house"
"which is situated off Galkotuwa Road for further investigations."
"Learned 
counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  drawing 
our  attention 
to  pages"
"76,77,78,109,112,115,117,118  of  the  brief  argues  that  above  mentioned"
"evidence is not probable and cannot be believed. He further submitted that"
"the  Appellant  was  not  arrested  at  Galkotuwa  Road  junction  but  he  was"
"arrested at his residence. Although the information was specific the raiding"
"team had obtained the address from the Appellant after his arrest. Hence the"
"counsel for the Appellant argues no such incident happened as claimed by"
"the prosecution."
"In  this  case  the  investigating  officers  had  received  information  that  the"
"Appellant  was 
leaving  his  house  with  Heroin.  No  specific 
time  was"
"mentioned.  But  the  police  team  had  waited  almost  six  hours  to  complete"
"their  task.  Considering  their  evidence  there 
is  no 
improbable  evidence"
"considered during the trial.  Their evidence pertaining to the raid was clear,"
"cogent and was devoid of any contradiction or ambiguity. Their evidence is"
"not challenged at all. Considering all the circumstances their action cannot"
"be faulted at any stage of the raid."
