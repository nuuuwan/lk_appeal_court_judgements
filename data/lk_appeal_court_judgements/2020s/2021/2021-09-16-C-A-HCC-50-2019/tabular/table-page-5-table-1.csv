"9.","The said PC 49687 Jayasuriya also has been called to testify by the defence."
"","On receiving the said message, he had gone to Cader’s house to find that the"
"","officers from the Narcotics Bureau had come to Cader’s house. He had gone"
"","to the extent of checking the identity card of an officer to confirm that they"
"","were from Narcotics Bureau. Although the two independent police officers"
"","called  by  the  defence  were  cross  examined  by  the  state  counsel  for  the"
"","prosecution, their testimony was unchallenged. Thus, it is clear that officers"
"","of the Narcotics Bureau had gone to Cader’s house in the morning by 11.30"
"","am, although PW1 and PW2 denied any officer from the Bureau going there"
"","in the morning. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment has said that"
"","the defence witnesses had failed to state whether Cader was there when DW"
"","2  Jayasuriya  went  to  Cader’s  house.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"","failed  to  consider  the  defence  evidence  in  the  right  perspective.  The  fact"
"","remains  that  the  officers  from  the  Narcotics  Bureau  had  gone  to  Cader’s"
"","house although PW1 and PW2 both denied they went there in the morning."
"","Therefore, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 cannot be considered credible and"
"","it is unsafe to convict the appellant on their evidence."
