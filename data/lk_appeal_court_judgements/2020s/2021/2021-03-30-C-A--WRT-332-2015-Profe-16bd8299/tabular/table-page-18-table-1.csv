"Section 2.1 of Circular No. 869"
"I
 have already referred to the fact that applications for the said post are assessed in"
"terms of the marking scheme, method of evaluation and method of selection set out"
"in Circular No. 869 issued by the UGC. I have also set out that the marking scheme"
"consisted  of  three  principal  sections  numbered  as  1,  2  and  3,  with  each  section"
"divided into several sub-sections."
"T
he  purported  mistake  relates  to  Section  2.1.1  which  had  been  divided  into  three"
"sub-sections,  numbered  as  2.1.1,  2.1.2  and  2.1.3.  In  terms  of  Sub-section  2.1.1,  an"
"applicant  was  entitled  upto  3  points  for  each  Research  paper  published  in  full  in  a"
"refereed journal. The applicant was entitled to an additional 02 points if that paper"
"had been published in an indexed journal, and to an additional 1 point if that paper"
"had been published in a journal which has at least three issues a year.  There was no"
"limit to the maximum marks that could be allotted under this category."
"S
ection  2.1.2  provided  for  marks  to  be  allotted  for  peer  reviewed  presentations  at"
"National or International conferences, with one mark being allotted where the paper"
"has been published in full, subject to a maximum of 15 marks, and half a mark where"
"the paper had been published in abstract form, subject to a maximum of 10 marks."
"I
n his self-assessed application,3 the Petitioner had listed under a separate category,"
"seven  abstracts  of  papers  presented  by  him  and  published  in  indexed  journals  as  a"
"supplement with the journal4 and claimed one mark for each of the said abstracts.5"
"The complaint of  the 1st Respondent is  that the  marking  scheme  set out in  Circular"
"No.  869  does  not  provide  for  marks  to  be  claimed  for  such  abstracts,  and  that  the"
"Petitioner had surreptitiously claimed the above seven marks."
"T
he  bone  of  contention  therefore  arises  from  the  self  assessed  application  of  the"
"Petitioner,  where,  having  listed  the  Research  papers  published  in  full  in  a  refereed"
"journal under Sub Section 2.1.1, the Petitioner had listed separately, seven abstracts"
"that had been published in refereed journals."
"3 Vide document marked ‘G3’ annexed to the petition in CA (Writ) Application No. 398/2015."
"4 Vide document marked ‘G1’ annexed to the petition in CA (Writ) Application No. 398/2015."
"5 Vide the said documents marked ‘G1’ and ‘G3’."
