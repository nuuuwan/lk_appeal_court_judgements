"Thus, it is clear that the creation of the post of Professor of Surgery (Co-Chair) had"
"been  approved  by  the  UGC,  and  to  that  extent,  both  the  UGC  and  the  195th"
"Respondent have acted in terms of the law."
"I
ssues raised by the Petitioner relating to the approval by UGC"
"T
his  brings  me  to  three  issues  that  have  been  raised  by  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel for the Petitioner with regard to the above process. In sequence of time, the"
"first issue is that when applications for the post of Professor of Surgery were called"
"by  paper  advertisement  dated  11th  September  2007, 
it  was  for  a  single  post  of"
"Professor of Surgery. The second is that the 1st Respondent was appointed Co-Chair"
"to the post of Professor of Surgery on 14th July 2015 with effect from 10th July 2008."
"The third is that the 1st Respondent was issued with the letter of appointment on 14th"
"July 2015, prior to receiving the approval of the UGC."
"I
  must  at  the  outset  state  and  acknowledge  that  the  process  which 
led  to  the"
"decision by which the 1st Respondent was appointed Professor of Surgery (Co-Chair)"
"was not the best, and that the 195th Respondent should certainly exercise more care"
"and diligence in how such matters are dealt with in the future. However, given the"
"present  facts  and  circumstances,  and  most  importantly  the  time  that  has  already"
"lapsed since the appointment of the 1st Respondent, I am of the view that the issues"
"in procedure highlighted by the Petitioner, are not significant enough to justify this"
"Court exercising its discretion in favour of the Petitioner and must be viewed relative"
"to the administrative chaos and inconvenience that may be caused by upsetting the"
"apple cart on those grounds."
"I
 shall first deal with the third issue. The UGC, in response to an appeal made to it by"
"the 1st Respondent, had informed the 193rd Respondent by its letter dated 23rd June"
"2015 that the  entity empowered  to carry out directives  in terms of  Section 29(l) of"
"the  Universities  Act  is  the  Council.35  The  Memorandum  of  the  193rd  Respondent"
"recommending  the  appointment  of  the  1st  Respondent  –  vide 
‘P27’  –  and  the"
"decision of the  Council of the 195th Respondent to appoint the 1st Respondent as a"
"Co-Chair  at 
its  496th  meeting  held  on  9th  July  2015  was  taken  only  thereafter,"
"followed by ‘195R6’. The approval of the UGC was sought on 14th July 2015. While it"
"35 Vide Annex 1 to ‘P27’."
