"not  belong  to  or  was  in  the  possession  of  the  informant.  It  is  also  a  probable"
"situation if someone queried, as they were Police officers in civil clothes, they"
"could have easily identified themselves. In the above circumstances it cannot be"
"considered as an improbability."
"It  is  also  submitted  that  there  was  no  explanation  given  as  to  why  the"
"production was kept for two days without being handed over to CI Rajakaruna."
"PW 1 had explained that it was in his personal locker which is permitted by the"
"authority."
"According to  the evidence given  on behalf of the appellant from the OIC"
"PNB CI Kevin Christopher,  PW 1 had left for a raid with another team at 18.15"
"hours and returned at 22.05 hours on 23.03.2013. It is the position of the defence"
"that it is an improbability based on the evidence of PW 1, where he has stated that"
"the sealing of the production  has commenced after returning to the PNB at 16"
"hours,  and his testimony in page 108 of the brief that he entered notes at 18.20"
"hours at the PNB. Therefore, according to the defence it is  improbable for PW 1"
"to have taken part in two raids which the trial judge has failed to consider."
"A
ccording to officer Christopher’s evidence in page 210 of the brief the"
"officers who have left for the raid at 18.15 has been led by one SI Lionel. At page"
"211 of the brief, SI Udara’s name together with the names of the  other constables"
"who took part in the raid are entered. It is also in evidence that SI Udara (PW 01)"
"has left for a raid at 14.20 hours and that the appellant who was arrested in that"
"raid has been handed over at 17 hours. The issue to be considered here is when"
"PW1 says his entry notes are at 18.20 hours , whether he could have participated"
"in the other raid where the officers left the PNB at 18.15 hours."
