"and  Emalin  who  are  the  children  of  Punchi  Ridi  marked  X2  and  X1"
"respectively. It is pertinent to be noted that in X1 and X2, K.M. Kira"
"has not been indicated as the father of the 3rd Respondent and Emalin."
"Moreover, it appears to this Court that there is no evidence adduced by"
"the  Respondents  to  substantiate  the  purported  fact  that  there  was  a"
"valid  marriage  between  Kira  and  Punchi  Ridi  by  cohabitation  and"
"repute."
"I agree with the decisions of Apex Courts cited by the learned Senior"
"Deputy Solicitor General in the written submissions filed on behalf of"
"the 1st and 2nd Respondents stating that the marriage by cohabitation"
"and  repute  should  be  considered  when  dealing  with  the  question  of"
"succession under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance."
"However, in the instant case, the claim of marriage by cohabitation and"
"repute between Kira and Punchi Ridi has not been established to the"
"satisfaction of this Court. Vide Sarathchandra vs. Attorney General3."
"In the circumstances, I am of the considered view that the position took"
"up  by  the  Respondents  in  their  Statement  of  Objection  is  devoid  of"
"merits."
"Having scrutinised the documents and the affidavits tendered by the"
"parties it is abundantly clear that the 1st and 2nd Respondents failed to"
"hold a fair and reasonable inquiry in terms of the provisions of the Land"
"Development  Ordinance  to  determine  the  successor  of  the  original"
"grantee, Kira."
"Under section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance, the eldest son"
"of the Permit/Grant holder is the lawful successor in the absence of a"
"nomination  of  a  successor  and/  or  the  spouse  of  the  Permit/Grant"
"holder is demised, which reads thus:"
