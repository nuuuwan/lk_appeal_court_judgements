"The Contention of the Respondents"
"The Respondents are not disputing the pedigree of the said Kira which"
"is set out in the Petition. However, in a nutshell, the Respondents took"
"up the position that the marriage between Kira and Punchi Ridi was a"
"valid marriage by cohabitation and repute. Thus, on the demise of Kira"
"the surviving spouse, Punchi Ridi succeeded to the subject matter. On"
"the  demise  of  the  said  Punchi  Ridi,  the  second  son  of  Kira,  the  4th"
"Respondent is entitled to succeed as the eldest son, Martin died before"
"the  demise  of  Punchi  Ridi.  In  the  circumstances,  the  transfer  of  the"
"subject matter to the 4th Respondent by P9 and the subsequent deed"
"of transfer executed in favour of the 3rd Respondent are lawful and valid"
"in terms of the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance."
"The fact in issue"
"The central issue to be considered in this case is as to whether there"
"was  a  valid  marriage  between  Kira  and  Punchi  Ridi  by  cohabitation"
"and  repute,  that  fact  has  to  be  established  by  the  respondents  with"
"strong and cogent evidence."
"The attention of this Cout is drawn to the Birth Certificate of David (P1)"
"who is the son of Punchi Ridi wherein the particulars of his father are"
"not stated. It is well established by P1 that Punchi Ridi was not married"
"to Kira as well. The 3rd and 4th Respondents along with their Statement"
"of Objections have submitted the Birth Certificates of 3rd Respondent"
