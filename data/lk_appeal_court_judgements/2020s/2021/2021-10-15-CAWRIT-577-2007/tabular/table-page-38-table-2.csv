"Justinian - R. W. Lee in his work on the Elements of Roman Law (4th Edition page 35) states"
"as follows with regard to the division of Roman Law to branches as Public Law and Private"
"""This is the division which the Roman Lawyers take as the primary line of cleavage in"
"the legal system. Public Law has regard to the Constitution of the Roman State. Private"
"Law is concerned with the interest of individuals. The classification is intelligible and"
"convenient,  though  there  are  points  at  which  the  two  overlap.  The  first  included"
"constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law and procedure and the jus sacrum."
"The second comprises those branches of law which regulate the relations of citizens"
"to  one  another,  family  law,  property,  obligations  and  succession.  The  institute  is"
"mainly  concerned  with  private  law.  It  ends  with  one  Title  on  criminal  law.  which"
"belongs to the jus publicum."""
