"It is incorrect to say that the Petitioner has not been given an opportunity to be heard and"
"produce evidence and that the principles of natural justice had been violated. The Petitioner"
"was  fully  given  the  opportunity  to  be  represented  before  the 
Inquiring  Officer  of  the"
"Condominium  Management  Authority  (03rd  Respondent).  All  parties  were  free  to  place"
"evidence  before  the  Inquiring  Officer  of  the  Condominium  Management  Authority,  as  is"
"demonstrated by the proceedings before the Inquiring Officer. The Petitioner placed both oral"
"evidence  as  well  as  written  evidence  and  filed  comprehensive  Written  Submissions  with"
"annexures before the Inquiring Officer of the Condominium Management Authority. No party"
"was allowed to cross-examine at the said inquiry and this was not the procedure adopted at"
"the inquiry before the Inquiring Officer of the Condominium Management Authority."
"On  a  perusal  of  the  documents  authenticated  and 
furnished  by  the  01st  to  the  03rd"
"Respondents, no stretch of imagination could it be said that the principles of natural justice"
"have  been  violated.  It  is  true  that  it  is  the  Petitioner  who  developed  the  condominium"
"property. Once the condominium property is prepared and the Deed of Declaration is effected"
"and the Condominium Plan is effected, the Petitioner ceases to be a developer and becomes"
"the owner of the various unsold apartments."
"The Petitioner as a developer was only entitled to any benefit or any right or entitlement as a"
"developer until such time, the Deed of Declaration and Condominium Plan was effected. Once"
"the Condominium Plan is affected and the Deed of Declaration is effected, the Petitioner who"
"the  developer  ceases  to  exist 
in 
law  as  a  developer  and  therefore,  has  no 
legitimate"
"expectation as a developer. The character of the Petitioner as a developer ceases to exist and"
"the character of the Petitioner as owner of the unsold apartment units, comes in to being."
"Therefore, the Petitioner becomes an owner of the unsold apartment units."
"Thus, the Petitioner has only a legitimate expectation or rights as an owner of condominium"
"apartment units after the creation of the Condominium Plan and the Condominium Deed of"
"Declaration. The Petitioner as an owner of the apartment units once the Deed of Declaration"
"and  Condominium  Plan  are  prepared  has  the  same  legitimate  expectation  as  that  of  the"
"owners of the various other condominium apartment units. The Petitioner cannot have any"
"other  entitlement  or  benefit  as  an  owner  of  condominium  apartment  units  which  is  not"
"conferred on the other apartment owners."
"In  the  circumstance,  the  Petitioner  has  no  legitimate  expectation  as  a  developer  and  the"
"Petitioner has only a legitimate expectation as an owner of condominium apartment units"
"and this legitimate expectation is equal and in par with the legitimate expectation of the other"
"owners of the apartment units. Therefore, the Petitioner's claim on the basis of legitimate"
"expectation is also baseless."
"It  was  decided  in the  case  of  K.  A.  Gunasekera vs T.  B.  Weerakoon  73 NLR 262  that  if the"
"petitioner has an alternative remedy which he has sought, a Writ of Certiorari should not be"
"issued."
