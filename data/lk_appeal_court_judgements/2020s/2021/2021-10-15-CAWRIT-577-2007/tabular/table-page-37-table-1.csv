"All  the  questions  raised  in  this  petition  could  be  resolved  in  my  view  by  considering  the"
"availability of the writ of Certiorari and Mandamus to the Petitioner. The learned counsel for"
"the Respondent submitted that a writ of Certiorari and Mandamus being a public law remedy"
"is  not  available  to  the  Petitioner.  The  reason  to  this  is  found  in  the  following  passage  in"
"Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol (1), 4th Edition (Administrative Law) paragraph 132;"
"""An order of Certiorari and Mandamus will be granted ordering to stop or an act to be"
"done which a statute requires to be done and for this rule to apply it is not necessary"
"that  the  party  or  corporation  on  whom  the  statutory  duty  is  imposed  should  be  a"
"public official or an official body."""
"The  judicial  control  over  the  fast-expanding  maze  of  bodies  affecting  rights  of  the  people"
"should  not  be  put  into  water  tight  compartments.  It  should  remain  flexible  to  meet  the"
"requirements of variable circumstances."
"There  is  rich  and  profuse  case  law  on  Certiorari  and  Mandamus  on  the  conditions  to  be"
"satisfied by the Petitioner. Some of the conditionâ€™s precedent to the issue of Certiorari and"
"Mandamus appear to be:"
"(a)  The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties"
"against whom the Mandamus is sought. (R. V. Barnstaple Justices (1937) 54 TLR 36)"
"(b) The foundation of Mandamus is the existence of a legal right (Napier ex parte 1852 18"
"QB, 692 at 695)"
"(c)  The right to be enforced must be a ""Public Right"" and the duty sought to be enforced"
"must be of a public nature. (Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs Messrs Jafferjee"
"& Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd. 2005 (1) SLR 89)"
"(d) The legal right to compel must reside in the Applicant himself (R. V. Lewishan Union"
"(1897) I QBD 498)"
