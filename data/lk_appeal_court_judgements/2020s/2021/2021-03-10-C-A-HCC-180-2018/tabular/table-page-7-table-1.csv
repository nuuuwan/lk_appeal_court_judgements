"the brief  V1 and V 2 contradictions have been marked to the effect that"
"in the statement to the police PW 15 has referred to a “ආයුධය” and not a"
"club,  (that  was  stated  in  evidence)    that  was  in  the  hand  of  the  1st"
"accused.  However,  PW  15  has  sufficiently  and  clearly  explained  that"
"when Kiniwita came out of the three wheeler he saw him carrying what"
"he  thought  was  a  “ආයුධය”,  but  when  the  deceased  was  assaulted  he"
"clearly saw that it was a club. This explanation can be considered as a"
"reasonable  explanation.  The  learned  trial  judge  has  considered  this"
"alleged contradiction and has arrived at a justifiable conclusion."
