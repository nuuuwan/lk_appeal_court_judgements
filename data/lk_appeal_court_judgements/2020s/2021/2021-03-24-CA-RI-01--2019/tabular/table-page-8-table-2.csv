"improbable that the Plaintiff Petitioner would have agreed to accept the additional"
"condition  incorporated  into the settlement. Therefore on  a balance  of probability"
"of the  evidence  one  can  accept  the  version  of the  Plaintiff  Petitioner  that  the"
"Attorney -
at -
Law  who represented  him  had  acted  contrarily to authority as  the"
"additional  condition  was  not a  part  of the  agreement  entered  into  between  the"
"parties and  that the Attorney -
at -
Law  for the  Plaintiff Petitioner had  consented"
"to this additional condition  purely by  mistake.  When  one examines the content of"
"the proceedings on 13.03.2018 it is apparent that the additional condition had  been"
"incorporated  into  the  settlement subsequently.  It  was  not  a  part  of the  original"
"settlement. After the terms of the original settlement were recorded the Attorney"
"- at - Law for the Defendants has made an  attempt to incorporate these additional"
"terms into the settlements as an additional condition. That clearly shows that it was"
"not  a  part  of  the  original  settlement.  The 
learned  counsel 
for  the  Defendant"
"Respondents has conceded  in this court that the disputed additional condition was"
"not  in  the  original  agreement.  Therefore  one  can  come  to  the  conclusion  on  a"
"balance  of probabilities  that  the  Defendants  Respondents  new,  or  a  reasonable"
"person  should  have  known,  that  a  mistake  was  being  made.  That  mistake  was"
"excusable  even  where 
there  was  absence  of  knowledge  on 
the  part  of  the"
"Respondents.  Therefore  the  disputed  additional  condition  incorporated  into  the"
"settlement can  be  set aside on  these grounds."
"For the aforesaid  reasons  we set aside the settlement/ Compromise  pertaining to"
"the  disputed  additional  condition  and  direct the  learned  District Judge  to amend"
