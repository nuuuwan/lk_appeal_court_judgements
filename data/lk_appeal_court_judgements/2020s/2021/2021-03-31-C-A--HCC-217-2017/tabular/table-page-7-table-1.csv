"about  15  minutes  to  go  to  the  place  where  the  vehicle  was  stopped."
"According to PW5 Samanlatha, after the vehicle was stopped at a certain"
"place, it had taken about 14 or 15 minutes to reach the accused’s house"
"by foot."
"According  to  PW2,  distance 
from  Dikhethepma 
junction  to  the"
"accused’s house is about 400 or 500 meters.   However, PW1 says"
"it took 15 minutes to go to that place by the vehicle.    If it took 15"
"minutes  as  described  by  PW1,  speed  of  the  vehicle  would  be  two"
"kilometers  per  an  hour.  The 
inconsistency  and  unacceptable"
"nature  of  this  evidence  was  not  considered  by  the  learned  Trial"
"Judge."
"When  the  police  called  out  the  inmates  of  the  house  at  midnight,"
"the  accused  woman  was 
sleeping  with  her 
young 
children."
"Immediately,  she  took  a  bag  of  heroin  and  went  to  the  rear  door"
"and opened it with a sound that could be heard by the police and"
"while  she  was  opening  the  door,  she  was  carrying  the  bag  in  her"
"right hand.  This part of testimony is also highly improbable."
"In  Punkody  vs  AGCA  11/2005,  the  test  of  probability  has  been"
"discussed  at  length.  Salam  J  considering  a  similar  situation  said,"
"“The  manner 
in  which  the  raid  had  taken  place  and  under  the"
"circumstances  under  which  the  accused  has  been  arrested  red-"
"handed  as  claimed  by 
the  prosecution,  while 
the  accused 
lady"
"walking  into  a  trap  knowing  very  well  that  she  was  to  be  trapped,"
"demonstrate 
the  absence 
of  prima-facie 
case 
for  an 
offence"
"particularly 
under 
section 
54(D) 
of 
the 
Poisons,  Opium 
and"
"Dangerous  Drugs  Act.    It  is  common  knowledge  person  extensively"
"dealing  with  such  prohibited  items  for  financial  gain  knowing  very"
"well  the  consequences  would  never  have  acted  in  the  manner  the"
"prosecution claimed that she did act.”"
