"In Babysingho v The Queen 75NLR 451, Sirimanne J stated as follows:"
"""A  statement  made  by  a  witness  outside  Court  may  always  be  used  for  the"
"purposes  of  contradicting  his  evidence.  Under  section  157  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance, such a statement made at or about the time when an incident took"
"place  can  be  used,  within  the  limits  (now  authoritatively  defined)  in  order  to"
"show  consistency,  and  thus  corroborate  the  witness's  evidence.  The  most"
"common example of this is the "" First Information"" on which investigations by"
"the police were initiated."
