"It 
is 
the  position  of 
the  defence 
that 
from 
the  beginning 
that  PW5"
"Samanlatha had  not  been  a  member of the police  team  that came  to  her"
"house."
"Initial  outward  entry  of  PW 1  does  not  contain 
the  PW5  Samanlatha's"
"name.  After  making the entry,  PWI  has  signed  the entry. 
In  that entry,"
"even  the  reading  of  the  odometer  was  recorded.  To  read  the  odometer,"
"one  should come to  the vehicle. 
It is the position of the prosecution that"
"the  PNB  is  at  3 rd  floor  of that  bUilding.  Once  they  come  to  the  garage,"
"they do  not go  back to  the  PNB  to  make  any entry  regarding the  vehicle."
