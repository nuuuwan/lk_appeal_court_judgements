"","was  right  along  in  the  vehicle  with  Sudantha"".  This  was  marked  as  ""1  වි  3"".  His"
"","evidence  cannot  be  relied upon  and  is  not  credible.  Priyantha  was  never  in  the"
"","scene, he was falsely implicated."
"(iii)","When he was cross-examined by the 2nd accused PW 01 admitted that he didn't"
"","make a complaint to any police station for nearly 10 months. It was suggested by"
"","the 2nd accused that he didn't make a complaint because he aided in committing"
"","the said offence. He had given 4 addresses to avoid people coming to his house."
"(iv)","If they had spent about 1.5 hours at the restaurant in Peradeniya having dinner,"
"","PW 01 would have known what the accused were talking about and planning. If"
"","he did not want to take part in the said offence, he would have avoided and gone"
"","away  without  being  noticed  by  anyone.  Although  he  had  ample  opportunity  to"
"","get  away,  he  did  not  do  so.  He  even  had  the  opportunity  to  go  to  Peradeniya"
"","Police  Station 
in  a  three-wheeler.  According  to  him,  both  the  accused  were"
"","drunk. This gives the inference that PW 01 had been a party to it."
"(v)","PW 01 in the police complaint had stated that "" he didn't ask Sudantha why he"
"","put the driver inside the van"". In his evidence in the High Court, he came out for"
"","the first time  stating that ""he asked why... "" which was marked as an  omission."
"","Sudantha  had  stated  that  his  family  had  a  problem  with  the  driver.  Because  of"
"","that, he wanted to beat him 2-3 times and leave him off."
"(vi)","In the  High Court, giving evidence PW 01 stated that  Sudantha kept a pistol on"
"","his  head  and  threatened  him.  In  the  Magistrate’s  Court,  he  had  answered  the"
"","same  in  the  negative.  He  admitted  in  the  High  Court  that,  he  was  coming  out"
"","with the truth. He could have driven straight to Kegalle Police Station."
"(vii)","In the High Court, giving evidence for the first time he broke out the fact that he"
"","had  stated:  ""Innocent  man,  why  are  you  beating  him?""  In  his  statement  to  the"
"","police, he had failed to state so."
"(viii)","He stated in the High Court, giving evidence for the first time that the driver was"
"","beaten with a wheel brace and they had driven with the inside lights on. In the"
"","police complaint, he had not mentioned it. Thus, the fact that the small light was"
"","on, is highly improbable."
