"person on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice."
"The judgement in Rex v Baskerville 2KB 658 and (1916 â€” 17) AER 38 it was held that;"
"""We  hold  that  evidence  in  corroboration  must  be  independent  testimony  which"
"affects  the  accused  by  connecting  or  tending  to  connect  him  with  the  crime.  In"
"other  words,  it  must  be  evidence  that  implicates  him,  that  is  which  confirms  in"
"some material particular not only the evidence that the crime had been committed"
"but  also  that  the  prisoner  committed 
it.  The  nature  of  the  corroboration  will"
"necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It"
"would  be  in  high  degree  dangerous  to  attempt  to  formulate  the  kind  of  evidence"
"which  would  be  regarded  as  corroboration,  except  to  say 
that  corroborative"
"evidence is evidence that shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice"
"that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime had been"
"committed, but that it was committed by the accused."""
