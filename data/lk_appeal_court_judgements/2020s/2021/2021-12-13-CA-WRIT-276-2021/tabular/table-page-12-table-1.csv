"වුවත් බදු ඔප්පුව ඉදරියට වසරක්  නැත.)to my mind said annotation itself indicates the"
"reason for such decision. Therefore, I am of the view that the Interview Board is"
"not required to give any further reason for its decision."
"As  observed  by  Chief  Justice  Sarath  N.  Silva  in  Haputhantirige  and  Others  Vs."
"Attorney General (2007)1 SLR 101, a Circular containing the scheme of admission"
"is to be deem the ‘’Law ‘’ governing  the admission of children to government"
"schools  as  it  is  a  binding  process  of  regulation  pertaining  to  the  admission  of"
"children to government school. I see no deviation from the said Circular P1 on"

"that a person or authority is said to be bound to fulfil. Professor Wade discusses"
