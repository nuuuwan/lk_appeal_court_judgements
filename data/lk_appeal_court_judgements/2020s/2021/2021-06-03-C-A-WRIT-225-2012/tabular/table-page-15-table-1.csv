"The decision to interdict the Petitioner has been taken by the Board of Trustees – vide"
"‘R53’. Furthermore, in terms of  the Manual ‘P1’, the decision to conduct a disciplinary"
"inquiry must be taken by the Board of Trustees. This too has been complied with – vide"
"the decision of the Board of Trustees marked ‘R53’."
"T
he learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the draft charge sheet has been"
"prepared by the 18th Respondent who conducted the preliminary investigation, and not"
"by  the  Director  (Administration).  This  position  is  correct.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the judgment of the Supreme Court"
"in University of Ruhuna and others vs Dr. Dharshana Wickremasinghe4 it was held that"
"in terms of the Universities Act, the duty to prepare the charge sheet is with the Council"
"of  the  University 
itself  and  that 
it  would  not  suffice 
if  the  charge  sheet 
is  merely"
"approved by the Council."
"H
owever,  in  this  instance,  the  failure  on  the  part  of  the  Director  (Administration)  to"
"prepare the charge sheet is not fatal, for two reasons. The first is that the preparation of"
"the 
charge 
sheet 
can  also  be  done  by  a  person  nominated  by 
the  Director"
"(Administration), which therefore shows that it is not mandatory that the charge sheet"
"should  be  prepared  by 
the  Director 
(Administration).  The  second  and 
the  more"
"important  reason 
is  that  while  the  requirement 
is  that  the  charge  sheet  must  be"
"approved by the Director General, in this instance, the charge sheet has been approved"
"not only by the Director General but by the Board of Trustees. I therefore do not see any"
"merit in the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner."
"I
n  these  circumstances,  I  am  satisfied  that  there  has  been  no  illegality  or  procedural"
"impropriety in the process that culminated in the interdiction of the Petitioner and the"
"issuance  of  the  charge  sheet.  Therefore,  I  do  not  see  any 
legal  basis  to  grant  the"
"Petitioner the relief prayed for."
"T
he  necessary  consequence  of  the  above  decision  is  that  the  disciplinary  inquiry  must"
"proceed against the Petitioner. However, such a course of action is not possible in view"
