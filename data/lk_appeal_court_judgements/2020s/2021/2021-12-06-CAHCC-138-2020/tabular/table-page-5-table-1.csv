"In this Appeal it is appropriate to consider both appeal grounds together."
"F
irstly,  the  Appellants  jointly  contend  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge"
"has erred in his judgement that the 2nd Appellant exceeded the limits of the"
"power vested in him as a police officer which led to the death of the deceased."
"S
econdly, they contend that in the circumstances of this case, since this was"
"an act committed in the course of carrying out their duties by the Appellants,"
"the Learned High Court Judge ought not to have come to a finding of guilt"
