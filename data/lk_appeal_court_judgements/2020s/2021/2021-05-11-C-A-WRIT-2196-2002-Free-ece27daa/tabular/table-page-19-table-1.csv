"a)","The 1st Petitioner is an importer of wines, spirits and essences to Sri Lanka, and"
"","is engaged in  the  sale  and  distribution  of liquor including  Beehive  Brandy  and"
"","the export of liquor to India and Maldives. The 1st Petitioner was also engaged"
"","in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages."
"b
)","The 2nd Petitioner in his evidence has explained the manner in which he met the"
"","representatives  of 
the 
supplier,  M/s  Adet 
Seward,  and  negotiated 
the"
"","arrangement  between  the  two  Companies  to  manufacture  Beehive  Brandy  in"
"","Sri  Lanka. 
It 
is  thereafter  that  the  1st  Petitioner  obtained  the  franchise  to"
"","manufacture  Beehive  Brandy.  Such  an  arrangement  could  not  have  been"
"","agreed upon in ignorance of what it entails."
"c
)","The  1st  Petitioner  was 
the  entity  that  was  engaged  right  throughout 
the"
"","manufacturing process as confirmed by Sri Lanka Distilleries Limited by its letter"
"","marked  ‘2R1’.  Therefore,  the  1st  Petitioner  would  obviously  know  the  specific"
"","qualities of the item that it was importing, if not for any other reason, simply to"
"","engage 
in 
the  manufacturing  process  and 
in  order 
to 
source 
the  other"
"","necessary raw materials and thereafter to price the product."
"d
)","Above  all,  there  can  be  no  ambiguity  that  HS  Code  No.  2106  is  a  residual"
"","classification, and specifically excludes products having more than 0.5% alcohol."
