"opinion, but with his assistance, is able to conclude that the writing"
"is a forgery;"
"2.  The    Judges    of  our   Courts    as    well  as    of  the    Indian    Courts,"
"have  made  it  clear  that  it  is  the  function  of  the  Court,    with  the"
"assistance of an expert, to decide on the similarity of handwriting,"
"and that it is not proper to act solely on the opinion of the expert;"
"3.  Where  a  handwriting  expert 
testifies  of 
forgery,  his 
testimony"
"should be accepted only if there is some other evidence, direct or"
"circumstantial, which tends to show that the conclusion reached by"
"the expert is correct;"
"4.  A handwriting expert should draw the attention of the Judge to the"
"details which influence him in reaching his decision, and the Judge"
"must  not  accept  the  expert’s  opinion  without  making  an  attempt"
"himself 
to  decide  whether 
the  grounds  on  which 
the  expert’s"
"opinion is formed are satisfactory;"
