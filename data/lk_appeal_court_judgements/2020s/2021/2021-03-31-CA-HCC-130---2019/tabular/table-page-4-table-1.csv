"8.","All 
four  grounds  of appeal  will  be  discussed  together  as 
they  relate 
to 
the"
"","evidence."
"9.","It is  the  contention  of the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the  learned"
"","High  Court  Judge  has 
failed 
to  consider 
the  delay  by  PWI 
to  make 
the"
"","complaint  to  the  police  in  the  proper  perspective.  In  that,  it  is  submitted  that"
"","PW I  initially did not tell  her husband as  the sexual intercourse was consensual."
"","She  was  compelled  to  complain  to  the  husband  as  the 
injuries  she  received"
"","were  seen  by  the  husband.  Counsel  further  submitted  that  according  to 
the"
"","evidence  of the  medical  officer  who  examined  PWI,  the 
injuries  PWI  had"
"","received  could  have  happened  while  she  was  having  consensual  sex  on  a"
"","unevenly  tiled  floor.  It is  further  submitted  that  if PWI  protested or screamed"
"","as  she  testified,  her  mother-in-law  who 
lived  just  10  feet  away  would  have"
"","heard the noise."
"10.","Learned  Deputy Solicitor General  appearing  for  the  respondent  submitted  that"
"","the  medical  officer  who  examined  PW I  had  opined  that  the  history  given  by"
"","PWI 
is  compatible  with  the 
injuries  received  by  PWI.  Learned  High  Court"
"","Judge has considered all  the evidence recorded and the  dock statement made by"
"","the appellant in arriving at his conclusion,  it is  submitted."
"II.","I  bear  in  mind  that  in  sexual  offences,  like  in  other offences,  no  corroboration"
"","of  the  evidence  of  the  prosecutrix 
is 
required 
to 
find  an  accused  guilty,"
"","provided that the Court finds the prosecutrix is  credible and trustworthy."
"12.","It  is  now a well  settled principle of law that a conviction can  be founded  on  the"
"","testimony  of the  prosecutrix  alone,  unless 
there  are  compelling  reasons  for"
"","seeking  corroboration.  Courts 
should 
find 
no  difficulty 
in 
acting  on 
the"
"","testimony  of a  victim  of sexual  assault  alone  to  convict  an  accused  where  her"
"","testimony  inspires  confidence  and  is  found  to  be  reliable  (State  of Himachal"
"","Pradesh  V.  Aslta Ram AIR {2006j SC 381: (2006j SCC(Cri)296)."
"13.","In  the instant case, PW I  has  made the complaint to the police after a delay of 4"
"","days.  She  had  not  even  told  her  husband  for  four  days.  Delay  in  making  the"
"","complaint can be justified  if it is  explained to  the  satisfaction of the Court.  The"
"","reason  for 
the  delay 
in  making  a  complaint  to 
the  police  or  informing  her"
"","husband  according to  PW I  was  that she  feared  the  appellant  doing  some harm"
"","to  her husband.  According to  PWI, later she decided to  tell  her husband after 4"
"","days,  as  she thought that the appellant would come again."
