"In  the case  of Somawathi Vs.  Madawala and  others 1983  (2)  SLR"
"15 also a petitioner who was  not a party to a partition action had  moved the Court"
"of Appeal  in  revision  and  the Supreme Court held  that the  intervention  should  be"
"allowed.  Soza  J held as  follows;"
"'The  court  will  not hesitate  to  use  its  revisionary  powers  to  give  relief  where  a"
"miscarriage  of justice has  occurred .
.
. Indeed the facts  of this case cry aloud for"
"the intervention of this court to prevent what otherwise would be a miscarriage"
"ofiustice""."
"Therefore th is court can  intervene in the exercise of its revi sionary"
"powers to set aside the jud gement and  interlocutory decree entered in this case to"
"avert 
the  miscarriage  of 
justice  caused 
to 
the  petitioners  and 
exceptional"
"circumstances  have  arisen  in  this  case  for this  court to exercise  its  extra  ordinary"
"revisionary jurisdiction."
"But  in  the circumstances  of this  case  it is  not necessary"
"to  set  aside 
the  entire  proceedings 
in 
the  District  Court  which  would  cause"
"unnecessary hardship to the parties. There is  no  pedigree dispute in  this case.  The"
"petitioners are not challenging the pedigree and they are not claim ing for undivid ed"
"rights 
in 
the  corpus.  The  dispute 
relates 
to  the 
identification  of  the  corpus."
"Therefore  we  set  aside  th e  findings  of the  learned  District Judge  relating  to  the"
"learned  District  Judge  to  permit  the 
identification  of the  corpus  and  direct  the"
"petitioners  to  intervene  in 
the  partition  action  as  added  defendants,  to  permit"
"them to file a statement of claim  and  participate at the trial.  We direct the learn ed"
"District  Judge 
to  amend 
the 
interlocutory  decree  accordingly  after  holding  an"
"inquiry regarding the identification of the corpus."
