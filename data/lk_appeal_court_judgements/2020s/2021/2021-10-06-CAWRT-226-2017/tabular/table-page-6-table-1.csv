"When all parties had agreed on the sum to be paid, there remains no question that"
"the money should be paid. In this instance, the Petitioner himself has acknowledged"
"receiving a sum of LKR 1,179,937,389.57. It was argued that if a part is paid, it is"
"the  duty  to  pay  the  balance.  The  part  payment  was  made  after  filling  this  case."
"Therefore, the balance should also be paid. The Respondents have not denied the"
"responsibility of the payment, or the amount awarded."
"Therefore, I am of the view that the writ of mandamus compelling the 1st and, 3rd"
"to 5th Respondents to pay the Petitioner bank a sum of LKR 966,477,849.93. should"
"be issued."
"Accordingly,  this  Court  issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  against  the  1st  and,  3rd  to  5th"
"Respondents to pay the Petitioner bank (limiting to) a sum of LKR 966,477,849.93."
"Application allowed."
