"obtained  from  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  prior  to  the  commencement  of"
"the proposed project.”"
"I
t was the submission of the Petitioners that the 3rd Respondent has failed to obtain"
"an EPL and therefore, continuing with the construction is illegal. The permit ‘P6’ has"
"been issued  for the  construction  of  the  anchorage  and  the  breakwaters. Once  they"
"are  erected,  the  3rd  Respondent  must  operate  the  said  anchorage.  It 
is  for  the"
"operation of the anchorage that the EPL is required from the Central Environmental"
"Authority,  to  ensure  that  all  environmental  requirements  during  the  operation  are"
"complied with. To say that an EPL is required for the construction of the anchorage"
"and  the  breakwaters  is  not  correct.  The  regulatory  authority  for  all  constructions"
"within  the  coastal  zone 
is  the  Department  of  Coast  Conservation  and  Coastal"
"Resource Management. As I have already referred to, in terms of the Act, it is the 1st"
"Respondent, in his capacity as the Director General of the said Department who has"
"been conferred with the power to approve an IEE or EIA. The CEA is not involved with"
"granting  approval  to  carry  out  development  activity  within  the  coastal  zone  unless"
"the 1st Respondent consults the CEA. Hence, the question of  obtaining an EPL from"
"the CEA to carry out any development activity does not arise."
"T
his  brings  me  to  the  final  argument  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioners. He submitted that the Petitioners apprehend that the anchorage is being"
"constructed  for  use  by  operators  of  multi  day  boats,  which 
is  contrary  to  the"
"recommendation  in  the  IEE.  Soon  after  this  matter  was  taken  up  for  support,  the"
"learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners,  without  prejudice  to  the  above"
"arguments, submitted  that the Petitioners have no objection to the construction of"
"the  anchorage if  multi day boat operators are  not permitted  to  use  the  anchorage."
"Although  the  Respondents  were  agreeable  to  the  said  resolution,  the  parties  could"
"not agree on the exact scope of a settlement."
"I
 have already adverted  to  the  fact that the  construction of  the  anchorage and  the"
"two  breakwaters  is  being  carried  out  to  achieve  two  primary  goals.  The  first  is  to"
"provide inter alia a safe landing site for small boats. The second is to prevent further"
"sea erosion. Whether multi day boats could also be permitted to use the anchorage"
"has  been 
considered 
in 
the 
IEE. 
In  my 
view, 
the 
following 
conclusion  and"
"recommendations in ‘P5’ are critical:"
"16"
