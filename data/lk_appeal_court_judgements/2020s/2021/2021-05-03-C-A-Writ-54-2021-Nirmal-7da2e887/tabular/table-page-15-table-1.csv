"Taking  into  consideration  all  of  the  above circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  to 
limit  the  review  of  the  construction  of  the"
"anchorage  and  the  breakwaters to  an  IEE is within  his powers  and is  neither illegal"
"nor unreasonable."
"T
he  third  argument  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  was  that"
"there  are  serious  flaws  with  the  IEE,  in  that  those  who  carried  out  the  IEE  have"
"copied  certain  materials  from  the  Feasibility  Study  conducted  by  Lanka  Hydraulics"
"Institute  Limited.  It  was  the  position  of  the  Petitioners  that  the 
location  of  the"
"anchorage and the breakwaters in terms of the Feasibility Study conducted by Lanka"
"Hydraulics Institute Limited is different to the location of the said structures given in"
"the IEE, and for that reason, the failure on the part of those who conducted the IEE"
"to study the behavior of the wave patterns and sand migration amounts to a serious"
"flaw in the IEE. The learned Additional Solicitor General has however submitted that"
"the offshore breakwaters were analysed and studied in ‘P5’ and that soil erosion due"
"to the construction of the offshore breakwaters have been considered in ‘P5’. While"
"it  is  correct  that  those  who  did  the  IEE  have  taken  material  from  the  Feasibility"
"Study,10  which  in  fact  has  been  acknowledged,  the  fact  remains  that  the  overall"
"quality of the IEE is not affected by this. In these circumstances, I am of the view that"
"this is not a ground on which the IEE can be struck down."
"T
he fourth argument of the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners revolves"
"around the development permit ‘P6’.  It was pointed out that ‘P6’ had been issued"
"on 17th December 2019 and was valid for a period of one year. The argument of the"
"Petitioners was that even  though the  permit  expired on  17th December 2020, work"
"on  the  anchorage  continued  in  the  absence  of  a  valid  permit.  It  is  correct  that  the"
"permit  expired  on  17th  December  2020.  However,  on  17th  February  2021  the  1st"
"Respondent  has  extended  the  validity  period  of  the  license  for  a  further  year  with"
"effect  from  17th  December  2020  including  the  period  when  the  construction  took"
"place. There is now in existence a permit valid until 17th December 2021 – vide ‘IP26’."
"T
he learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner thereafter referred to Clause 2.6"
"of  ‘P6’  which  reads  as  follows  -  “The  Environmental  Protection  License  should  be"
"10 Vide Annex II of ‘P5’."
"15"
