"approval  by  the  Parliament,  unless  and  until  such  Order  is  rescinded.  The  Supreme"
"Court held that:"
"“Of  course,  I  must  advert  to  the  fact  that  there  is  absolutely  no  evidence  that"
"the order made by the Minister was ever placed before Parliament, and there is"
"no certificate under the hand of the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister in"
"charge of the subject of Foreign Affairs (currently External Affairs) which would"
"have  been  in  terms  of  section  6  of  the  Diplomatic  Privileges  Act  which  would"
"have  amounted  to  conclusive  proof  of  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  enjoyed"
"diplomatic  immunity.  However, in my  opinion,  the order  under section  4(1) of"
"the Act, if made validly, would come into force when published in the Gazette,"
"and  would  remain  in  force  until  and  unless  it  is  disapproved  by  Parliament."
"The  failure  to  place  the  order  before  Parliament  does  not  affect  its  coming"
"into force. It is also my opinion that a certificate under section 6, which would"
"have facilitated proof of immunity, is not indispensable to proving the existence"
"of  immunity,  if  it  can  be  established  by  other  evidence,  as  the  Appellant  has"
"succeeded in doing in this appeal.”"
