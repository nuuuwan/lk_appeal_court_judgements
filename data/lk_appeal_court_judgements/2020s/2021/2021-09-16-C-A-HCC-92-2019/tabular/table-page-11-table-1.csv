"statement  that  he 
left  the  gun

"afterthought in order to counter the evidence of PW-06."
"The  appellant’s  own  son  PW-02  has  given  evidence  as  to  the  relationship  the"
"appellant  had  with  his  wife,  although  he  has  made  an  attempt  to  show  that"
"everything was fine between them. The son’s evidence had not been counted in"
"any  acceptable  manner,  and  when  taken  together  with  other  circumstantial"
"evidence,  although  it  is  not  necessary  to  prove  the  motive,  I 
find  enough"
"motivation for the appellant to remove his wife from his life."
"Although it was the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the"
"learned  trial  judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  circumstantial  evidence  in  its"
"correct 
perspective 
and 
the 
judgment  has 
been 
based 
on 
suspicious"
"circumstance, 
I  am  unable  to  agree. 
It 
is  very  much  apparent 
from  the"
"judgment 
that 
the 
learned 
trial 
judge  was  mindful  of 
the  relevant 
legal"
"principles emphasized before. There is no basis to consider that the verdict has"
"been reached based on suspicious circumstances as the learned trial judge was"
"mindful  that  such  circumstances  do  not  establish  guilt.  I  am  of  the  view  that"
"this  is  a  case  where  all  the  circumstantial  evidence  when  taken  cumulatively"
"points  directly  towards  the  culpability  of  the  appellant 
for  the  crime  and"
"nothing else."
"It  is  well  settled  law  that  in  such  a  scenario,  an  accused  person  only  has  to"
"create  a  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the  evidence  against  him,  or  at  least  offer  a"
"reasonable explanation, since there is no duty cast on an accused in a criminal"
"trial,  and  it  was  the  prosecution  who  must  prove  its  case  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt."
"I do not find any basis to consider that there was any doubt as to the evidence"
"led  in  this  action  or  any  reasonable  explanation  given  as  to  the  incriminating"
"circumstantial available evidence against the appellant."
