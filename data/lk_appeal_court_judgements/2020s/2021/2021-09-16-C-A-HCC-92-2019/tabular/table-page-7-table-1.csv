"his  wife  has  met  with  an  issue  and  his  house  has  been  burgled,  seeking  her"
"help. She has refused to come out of the house since it was night time and has"
"been informed subsequently that the wife of the appellant has been shot dead."
"It appears that the stand taken throughout the trial by the appellant was that"
"someone shot his wife from outside the house and he has nothing to do with it."
"However,  the  learned  High  Court  judge  has  found  that  his  stand  has  not"
"created  any  doubt  on  the  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution  as  to  his"
"culpability  to  the  crime.  Based  on  the  circumstantial  evidence,  the  appellant"
"was found guilty as charged by the learned High Court judge."
