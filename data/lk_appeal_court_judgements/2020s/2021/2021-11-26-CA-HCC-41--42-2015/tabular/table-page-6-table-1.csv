"C.A.) in which it was held thus;"
"""Testimonial evidence can raise veracity and accuracy concerns. The former relates"
"to  the  witness's  sincerity,  that  is,  his  or  her  willingness  to  speak  the  truth  as  the"
"witness  believes  it  to  be.  The  latter  concerns  relate  to  the  actual  accuracy  of  the"
"witness's testimony. The accuracy of a witness's testimony involves considerations of"
"the  witness's  ability  to  accurately  observe,  recall  and  recount  the  events  in  issue."
"When  one 
is  concerned  with  a  witness's  veracity,  one  speaks  of  the  witness's"
"credibility. When one is concerned with the accuracy of a witness's testimony, one"
"speaks of the reliability of that testimony. A witness whose evidence on a point is not"
"credible cannot give reliable evidence on that point..."""
"The contention of the learned counsel for the 1st accused-appellant was that there was no"
"evidence  of  any  pardon  given  to  PW  01,  on  record.  The  brief  does  not  contain  the  non-"
"summery proceedings. This confession had not been produced at the trial nor listed in the"
"indictment as a document relied upon by the prosecution."
"A  dead  body  was  found  face  down 
in  the  bus  stand  adjoining  the  rubber  estate  on"
"28.09.2000 at 5.10 am. The police officer who visited the scene described it as a ""very dark"
"and lonely place"". A bus conductor who saw the dead body informed the police."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  1st  accused-appellant  says  that  PW  01  had  cases  in  Negombo"
"Magistrate’s  Court  and Warakapola  Magistrate’s  Court. Therefore,  he was  hiding from  the"
"police.  He  had  some  animosity  with  the  2nd  accused  appellant  which  was  not  disclosed"
"during the trial."
"Further, it was revealed that in the Magistrate's Court, while giving evidence, PW 01 stated"
"that he ""waited till 2 o clock till Sudantha came""."
"In  his  evidence  in  the  High  Court,  he  had  stated  that  ""he  waited  till  9  in  the  night  till"
"Sudantha  came"". 
It  was  argued  by 
the  1st  accused-appellant 
that 
this 
is  a  material"
"contradiction. It was marked as ""1 වි 1"". If Sudantha came at 2 o'clock he would have taken"
"his  money  or  else  without  his  money  PW  01  could  have  left.  The  whole  incident  revolves"
"around  him  going  in  the  van  with  Sudantha,  having  dinner  and  meeting  Priyantha,  which"
"was an afterthought. According to his evidence, he had not seen Priyantha before this. It is"
"my view that there was no reason for PW 01 to falsely implicate Priyantha for this crime."
"The learned counsel for the  1st accused-appellant argued about the contradictions marked"
"by the 1st accused and credibility of PW 01 in the following manner;"
"(i) 
PW  1  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  evidence  had  stated:  ""After  that,  we  came  to"
"Kegalle Galigamuwa direction. That time the person who drove was Sudantha""."
"But  later  in  the  High  Court  trial,  he  stated:  ""Up  to  Galigamuwa  it  was  I  who"
"drove"". this was marked as ""1 වි 2"". His evidence had failed the test of credibility."
"(ii) 
In the Magistrate’s Court as evidence, PW 01 stated that ""Priyantha got into the"
"vehicle at Kegalle Molagoda area"". In the High Court, he testified that ""Priyantha"
