"technicalities  and  must be  concluded under  such  rules  as will  protect  the  innocent"
"and punish the guilty."""
"The learned counsel for the 1st accused-appellant argued further that if PW 01 Manamperi"
"was  not  arrested,  the  story  of  the  prosecution  would  have  been  a  different  one.  His"
"evidence came by chance to the prosecution case. The learned Trial Judge did not consider"
"this  aspect.  It  is  my  view  that  PW  01  Manamperi  was  arrested  and  therefore  justice  was"
"done for the deceased three-wheeler driver."
"It was only after the arrest of Manamperi (PW 01) that the roots of a tragic crime that could"
"have been buried in the sands of time were discovered. Being able to bring the perpetrators"
"of that crime to justice and punish them properly can be considered as doing justice to the"
"murdered three-wheeler driver."
"In light of the reasons aforesaid, having regard to the facts and legal principles involved in"
"the present matter in question, this appeal had failed to hold any merit."
"Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal."
"Appeal dismissed."
