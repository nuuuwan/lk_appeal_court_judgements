"Appellant had left the scene. As per the evidence of PW4 and PW5 mentioned above, the"
"Appellant had confessed to both of them that he had shot two people. The first deceased was"
"found dead and the second deceased ( Rohana Ekanayake ) had succumbed to his injuries"
"while in hospital."
"Subsequent  to  the  conclusion  of  the  case  of  the  prosecution,  the  Appellant  in  his  dock"
"statement  did  not  deny  his  complicity  in  commission  of  the  offence  stating  that  the  two"
"deceased persons assaulted him with a T56 gun which discharged accidently during the fight."
"The defence called no further witnesses."
"The first contention by the Counsel for the Appellant is that the Appellant has been denied of"
"a fair trial as the judgement of the Learned Trial Judge was delivered immediately after the"
"conclusion of the oral submissions demonstrating that due judicial consideration has not been"
"given in arriving at the final verdict. The Counsel for the Appellant further contends that the"
"evidence of the prosecution was led before the predecessors and the Learned Trial Judge who"
"delivered the judgement only had the privilege of hearing the dock statement of the Appellant"
"stating that the evidence of the trial was not fresh in the mind of the Learned Trial Judge who"
"subsequently delivered the judgement."
"The  Indian  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Zahira  Habibullah  Sheikh  and  Others  V.  State  of"
"Gujarat [ Appeal (crl.)446-449 of 2004] held that “Fair trial obviously would mean a trial before"
"an impartial judge, a fair prosecutor and atmosphere of judicial calm. Fair trial means a trial"
"in which bias and prejudice for or against the accused, the witnesses or the cause which is"
"being tried is eliminated.”"
"An allegation on violation of principles of fair trial requires substantial evidence that challenge"
"the  independence,  impartiality  and  the  competence  of  a  trial  judge.  In  this  instance  the"
"Counsel for the Appellant by failing to do so has unnecessarily stressed over the technicalities"
"of delivering a verdict."
"In the case of Rajesh Gupta V The State of Bihar [ Criminal Appeal (SJ) No.308 of 2011; Criminal"
"Appeal (SJ) No 247 of 2011] it was held that “…the object of the trial is to meet out justice and"
"to convict the guilty and protect the innocent, the trial should be a research for the truth and"
"not  a bout  over technicalities  and  must  be  concluded  under  such  rules as  will  protect the"
"innocent and punish the guilty.”"
"The  second  contention  by  the  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  is  that  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  is"
"depleted of sufficient judicial evaluation. Citing R V R.E.M (2008 SCC 51) the Counsel further"
"stated that an acceptable judgement must indicate the judge’s absorption of the narrative of"
"events, his evaluation of evidence with reasons thereon and his application of the law and"
"legal  principles.  It  was  argued  that  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  wrongly  analysed  the  dock"
"statement of the Appellant prior to analysing the evidence lead by the prosecution thereby"
"causing prejudice to the case of the Appellant. These observations would essentially be on"
