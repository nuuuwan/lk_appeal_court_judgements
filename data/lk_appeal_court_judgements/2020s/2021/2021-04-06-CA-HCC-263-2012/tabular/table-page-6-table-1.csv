"â€œIt  is  rare  that  a  decision  of  a  Judge  so  express,  so  explicit  upon  a  point  of  fact  purely  is"
"overruled  by  a  Court  of  Appeal,  because  the  Courts  of  Appeals  recognize  the  priceless"
"advantage which a Judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any"
"Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or from narrative of those who"
"were present. It is very rare that, in questions of veracity so direct and so specific as these, a"
"Court of Appeal will over rule a judge of first instance."
"I find there is no material before this court to support the Defence proposition."
"For  the  reasons  set  out  in  my  judgment  I  affirm  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  dated"
"02.11.2012 by the learned trial Judge and dismiss the appeal."
"Appeal dismissed."
