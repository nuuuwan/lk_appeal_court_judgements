"The position of PW1 was that the appellant hit him on the mouth with his fist"
"and  as  a  result,  three  of  his  teeth  shook.  However,  considering  the  medical"
"evidence,  the Learned Trial Judge came  to the conclusion that the mobility of"
"the teeth was not due to the shot with the fist, but PW1 is suffering from a gum"
"disease known as ""Periodontitis."""
"It is to be noted that the loosened teeth were not in one place. There were three"
"loose teeth on the right upper jaw and two on the left lower jaw. The evidence of"
"PW1  is  that  he  already  had  lost  some  teeth  before  the  incident  happened.  He"
"also stated that  the  relevant three  teeth  were in good condition before he was"
"hit.  After  consideration  of  the  medical  evidence, 
the  Learned  Trial  Judge"
"decided  that  the  mobility  of  teeth  was  not  a  result  of  the  hit.  There  were  no"
"external injuries at all. Also, there were no injuries to the outer or inner lip."
