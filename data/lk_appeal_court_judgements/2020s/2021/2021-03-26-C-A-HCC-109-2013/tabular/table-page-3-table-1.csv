"Chandrasekaran (PW 09) states in his evidence that the deceased was his brother-in-law and that"
"both the appellant and the deceased were not in good terms and they both would quarrel very"
"often,  after  getting drunk.  Further, he  states that  on the  date  of  the  incident  too  he  saw the"
"appellant assaulting the deceased."
"L
earned Counsel for the appellant says that it transpires from the afore-named witness who was"
"the brother-in-law of the deceased that the appellant and the deceased would engage in constant"
"petty quarrels daily after consuming liquor and on the day in question around 6.30 - 7.00 p.m. He"
"had seen the appellant assaulting the deceased on the road which had prompted him to slap the"
"appellant  at  which  point  the  latter  had  gone  towards  the  direction  of  his  house.  Witness  has"
"further testified that 45 minutes after the fracas, he had received a message with regard to the"
"incident of murder. He further testified that at the time of the fight they were both drunk and"
"has further reiterated that it was a daily occurrence for them to drink and fight."
"T
he  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (PW18)  in  his  evidence  has  stated  that,  he  observed  20  external"
"injuries and the majority of which were cut injuries. He had further observed that there were 07"
"deep cut injuries and opined that extensive bleeding due to multiple-extensive cut injuries as the"
"cause of death. This clearly indicates the intention of the appellant to ensure that the deceased"
"should not have a chance of survival. It clearly demonstrates that the appellant had been acting"
"with the clear intention and purpose to commit the murder of the deceased."
"L
earned Counsel for the Appellant indicated when this matter was argued on the 01-03-2021 that"
"she will not rely on the evidence led at the trial which warrants the plea of voluntary intoxication"
"within the ambit of sec. 79 of the penal code.  Her main argument was based on the fact that"
"items of evidence favorable to the appellant have not been considered by the trial Judge, which"
"incidentally  would  have  played  a  decisive  role  in  determining  the  culpability.  Although  it  was"
"argued that, the difference between Section 293 and 294 of the Penal Code was not  properly"
"considered by the learned trial Judge, considering the circumstances of this case I am unable to"
"agree with that proposition."
"I
n the case of Bandara v Attorney General 2006 (2) SLR 1, the accused by throwing acid on to the"
"deceased had intended to cause the injuries actually caused. The injuries caused were sufficient"
"in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  to  cause  death.  The  injuries  were  said  to  be  fatal  and  the"
"deceased succumbed to the injuries within 24 hours. This would mean that the probability of"
"death occurring was very high. The fact that the accused intended to cause only bodily harm and"
"not death is therefore immaterial."
"S
ection 294 amply demonstrates this position. Although the High Court Judge found the accused"
"guilty of murder under the second limb of section 294, it should be considered as the third limb"
"of section 294. It was held further, that it is quite immaterial that the death caused, was that of"
"a  man  other  than  whose  death  was  intended.  Where  the  accused  has  the  intention  to  kill"
"someone, and if with the intention, he kills somebody else, he is guilty of committing murder. As"
"harm was intended on someone, the accused has no escape from liability of the injuries caused"
"to the other person either."
