"Vs  Jinasekere  46  NLR  in  page  246,    have  been  referred  to  by  the  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant to justify his proposition."
"It is unfortunate that the position of the defence regarding the continuous land"
"disputes  between  the  deceased  and  the  enmity  of  the  appellant  was  not  put  to  the"
"prosecution witnesses."
"However, we are of the opinion that the following facts ought to be considered"
"from the evidence  that was elicited; the appellant bringing a sword and a knife to the"
"place of incident; the utterance ‘either you or me”; the previous complaints to the police"
"and  the  admitted  enmity  between  the  parties;  the  deceased  cutting  or  more  aptly"
"destroying the banana bushes for no apparent reason in the backdrop of existing disputes"
"regarding the ownership of the land; the deceased having in possession  a half empty,"
"quarter  bottle  of  liquor  and  the  medical  evidence  that  the  deceased  was    under  the"
"influence  of  liquor  to  some  mild  degree;  the  amount  of  injuries  on  the  body  of  the"
"deceased."
"The bone of contention seems to be the ownership of the land. Thus, the deceased"
"felling  the  banana  bushes  would  have  definitely  angered  and  upset  the  appellant."
"Although the appellant has stated that the act of the deceased cutting the banana bushes"
"did not make him angry, it is hard to believe that to a prudent person, considering the"
"past behaviour of the appellant where the land matters were concerned."
"In such circumstances any prudent man could accept that the appellant has acted"
"on cumulative provocation."
