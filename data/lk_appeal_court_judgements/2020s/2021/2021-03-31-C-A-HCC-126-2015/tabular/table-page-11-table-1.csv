"Therefore, it is our considered view that on the evidence that transpired in this"
"case, it is the duty of the Court to consider whether the appellant is entitled to have the"
"benefit of the lesser culpability."
"It is on record that even at a late stage while the evidence of the accused appellant"
"was in progress the Counsel has made such an application to Court to consider lesser"
"culpability. It is obvious that the learned trial judge has  either not  given his mind or"
"considered the application in the background of the afore stated evidence."
"In consideration of the totality of the evidence in this case, that the appellant is"
"guilty  of  the  offence  of  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder  on  the  basis  of"
"sudden fight on cumulative provocation."
"We  therefore,  set  aside  the  finding  and  conviction  for  the  offence  of  murder"
"imposed by the trial judge and we find the appellant guilty of the offence of culpable"
"homicide not amounting to murder an offence punishable under section 297 of the Penal"
"Code. We set aside the sentence of death imposed by the trial judge."
"We impose a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment on the accused and a"
"fine of Rs 5000/=  and in default of which we order a further term of one year simple"
"imprisonment."
"Having regard to the fact that the accused appellant is incarcerated from the date"
"of  conviction,  we  further  make  order  that  the  10  year  rigorous  imprisonment  should"
"operate from 10.07.2015, namely the date of conviction."
