"E.R.S.R. Coomaraswami in his treatise “ Law of Evidence” Vol 2 book 2 at page"
"658 has stated as follows referring to child witnesses:"
"“There  is  no  requirement  in  English  law,  that  the  sworn    evidence  of  a  child"
"witness needs to be corroborated as a matter of law. But the jury should be warned, not"
"to look for corroboration, but of the risks involved in acting on the  sole evidence  of"
"young girls or boys, though they may do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence……"
"This requirement is based on the susceptibility of children to the influence of others and"
"to the surrender to their imaginations.”"
"At page 659 it states, “As regards the sworn testimony of children, there is no"
"requirement  as  in  England  to  warn  of  the  risks  involved  in  acting  on  their  sole"
"testimony, though it may be desirable to issue such a warning, though the failure to do"
"so will generally not affect the conviction.”"
"It was stated in Panchchi vs the State of U.P (1998) 7 SCC 177, that evidence of"
"a  child  witness  must  be  evaluated  more  carefully  and  with  greater  circumspection"
"because a child can be easily swayed by what others tell him and thus a child witness is"
"an easy prey to tutoring."
"M.Ajith Kumara alias Ajith Vs. Attorney General in CA No 2018/2012, decided"
"on 26.09.2014 is a case where a small child when he was about 5/6 years old at the time"
"of the incident had witnessed his own mother, grandmother and the grandfather, being"
"murdered. His evidence had been led when he was about 15 years of age and the trial"
"judge who observed the demeanor and deportment of the child witness had considered"
"him to be a truthful witness. Gooneratne J, had held that there was no basis to intervene"
"and interfere in the reasoning of the trial judge and further went on to state that the “"
"defence  had  not  succeeded  in  making  any  breakthrough  in  the  evidence  of  the  child"
"witness to favour the defence case.’"
