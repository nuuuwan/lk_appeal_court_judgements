"The suggestion by the prosecution that the deceased was his uncle’s son (bappa’s"
"son)  was  denied  by  him  (page  249).  However,  it  is  noted  that  both  have  the  same"
"surname.  On  a  closer  reading  of  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  there  are  obvious"
"contradictory evidence which the appellant has not been able to explain. He has been"
"constantly changing his stance."
"It  is  noted  that  the  learned  trial  judge  while  the  accused  was  being  cross"
"examined in page 267 of the brief, had observed the strange behaviour of the appellant"
"and had referred him to obtain a psychiatric report from the Angoda Hospital. The report"
"from the consultant psychiatrist Dr Neil Fernando has recommended that he is fit to"
"plead and stand trial and that the appellant is not suffering from any mental disorder."
"Some unusual and strange steps have been taken thereafter. After the report was"
"filed in court on 30.01.2015, an application has been made by the assigned counsel to"
"conclude the matter adopting a short cut and to plead for a lesser offence of culpable"
"homicide not amounting to murder on exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code."
"On the following trial day being on 26.02.2015, the assigned Counsel Mr. Thilak"
"Amaratunga had moved Court to discharge him from being the assigned Counsel on"
"personal grounds. The learned trial judge in page 273 of the brief had made a comment"
"that it was unusual for a Counsel to make such a request at the tail end of a case but"
"nonetheless, as it was on personal grounds, his application had been considered and he"
"had been discharged from being the assigned counsel for the appellant."
"On the request of the appellant and with his consent, attorney at law, Mr A.G"
"Amerasinghe has been appointed as the new assigned counsel for the appellant."
