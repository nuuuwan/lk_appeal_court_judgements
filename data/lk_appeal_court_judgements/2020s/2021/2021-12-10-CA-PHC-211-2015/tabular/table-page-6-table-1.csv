"vested to the Janatha Estate Development (JEDB) and the Janatha Estate Development"
"(JEDB) had no control or function over Talduwa Estate."
"Furthermore, it was submitted by the Appellant that Malwatte Valley Plantation Limited was"
"incorporated under the Companied Act No 17 of 1982, under the provisions of conversions of"
"Public Corporations or Government Owned Business undertakings into Public Companies."
"Therefore, it is governed by the Companies act."
"Hence, the Respondent cannot act as a competent authority of the Talduwa Estate and has no"
"lawful power or authority to make an application under the State Lands (Recovery of"
"Possession) Act to the Magistrates Court to obtain an Order to evict the Appellant. Thus, it"
"was contended that the Learned Magistrate has no jurisdiction to act upon the application of"
"the Respondent for ejectment of the Appellant from the disputed premises."
"On the contrary, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that Section 3 of the"
"conversion of public corporations or government owned business undertaking in to public"
"companies Act No 23 of 1987 has enacted that the properties of the corporation are vested"
"with the companies."
"As a matter of fact, thus the companies have been granted lease for a period of 53 years. The"
"Gazette No. 720/2 dated 22.06.19992 as referred by the Appellant even does not state that"
"immovable properties were vested with the companies. Accordingly, the ownership of the"
"land is remained with the state, Janatha Estate Development (JEDB)."
