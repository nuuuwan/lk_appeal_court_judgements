"subsequent  incidents  demonstrate  that  the  information  received  is"
"correct."
"W
hen considering the aforesaid discrepancies, it is apparent that all of"
"these  discrepancies  are  related 
to 
the 
information  received.  The"
"argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  was  that  these"
"discrepancies regarding the information occurred because they did not"
"receive information about the appellant and the raiding team went to"
"arrest  “Renuka.”  If  these  police  officers  went  to  arrest  ‘’Renuka’’  but"
"instead  arrested  the  appellant,  Renuka's  son,  because  she  was  not"
"there, and wanted to pretend that they arrested the appellant based on"
"information  received,  the  police  officers  attached  to  the  same  police"
"station could make entries to that effect and give evidence without any"
"discrepancy. Therefore, it is difficult to agree with the contention that"
"these discrepancies occurred as there was no such information."
"I
n the case of Sunil vs. The Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri LR 191, it"
"was observed that “the Court must not be unmindful of the fact that"
"they  are  human  witnesses  and  it  is  a  hallmark  of  human  testimony"
"that  such  evidence 
is 
replete  with  mistakes, 
inaccuracies,  and"
"misstatements. Also, it is stated in this judgment that the court has to"
"be  equally  mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  evidence  tendered  by  human"
"testimony will suffer from certain deficiencies and defects. It is in this"
"light that Justice Cannon in Attorney General v. Visuavalingam – (47"
"NLR 286) emphasized that no prudent and wise Judge would disregard"
"testimony  for  the  mere  proof  a  contradiction  but  that  a  wise  Judge"
"should critically assess and evaluate the contradiction. He emphasized"
"the  Judge  must  give  his  mind  to  the  issues  what  contradictions  are"
"material in discrediting the testimony of a witness”."
"I
n considering the facts and circumstances of the instant action with"
"the  substance  of  the  aforesaid  judicial  authority,  I  agree  with  the"
"contention  of  the 
learned  SDSG  that  the  aforesaid  discrepancies"
