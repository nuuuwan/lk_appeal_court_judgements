"The 6th Defendant-Appellant argues that the order in  case No:11922 was  to  divide the land"
"among 24 co-owners. The interlocutory decree does not hold an order to sell; it only speaks of"
"a partition of the corpus among co-owners. The idea of a sale was introduced after entering the"
"interlocutory decree, which came into the case much later, on 19th June 1928. It was on 19. 06."
"1928 an order was made to sell the land in blocks according to Plan No.5495.  As the law does"
"not allow for amending the decree in a partition case, the decree to sale becomes null and void."
