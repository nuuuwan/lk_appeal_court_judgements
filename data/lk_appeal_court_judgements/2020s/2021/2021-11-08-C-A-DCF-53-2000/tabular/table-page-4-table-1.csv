"However, that was not the main point on which the learned District Judge rejected Plaintiff's"
"evidence.  When considering the whole judgment, the learned District Judge had considered"
"that Plaintiff is not a credible witness.  He had violated the elections Law of Sri Lanka.   He"
"had tried to admit his children to Royal college on false documents. Now Plaintiff is trying to"
"obtain what belongs to the National Housing Development Authority wrongfully. In evidence,"
"it had come to light that the premises in question belong to the National Housing Development"
"Authority."
"The No. 17 of 1979 National Housing Development Authority Act has stipulated conditions"
"on how a person may come into  the occupation of a house governed under the Act.  Even"
"though the learned District Judge had not considered all these factors, once it has revealed that"
"the property is a property of State Judge can do nothing but reject the plea of the Plaintiff. The"
"Judge cannot make an illegal order. The learned District Judge had enough reasons when he"
"decided not to give credit to Plaintiff. The learned District Judge had rejected the version of"
"Plaintiff and that of Defendant giving reasons.   By the judgment, the learned District Judge"
"had not held in anyone's favour."
"I see no reason to disturb the judgment of the learned District Judge, as Plaintiff had failed to"
"come with clean hands."
"I make no order for cost.  I dismiss the Appeal and direct the Registrar of this Court to remit"
"the case record back to the District Court of Colombo with a copy of this judgment."
