"JUDGMENT"
"The Plaintiff-Appellant had filed this Appeal to set aside judgment entered in case No 17039/L"
"on 10. 02. 2000 of the District Court of Colombo."
"Plaintiff filed the case in District Court seeking ejectment of the Defendant and all holding"
"under him from the premises described in the schedule and other reliefs. Defendant, in his"
"Answer, pleaded that he had acquired prescriptive title and sought dismissal of Plaintiff's case."
"However, he had not pleaded for a judgment to declare him as the owner. Issues were raised"
"and proceeded to trial. After the trial, judgment was pronounced on   10.02. 2000. The learned"
"District Judge answered all the issues and held against the Plaintiff. Aggrieved by the said"
"judgment, the Appellant pleads to set aside the judgment.  Both parties agreed to abide by a"
"judgment on the written submissions filed. Plaintiff contended that the learned District Judge"
"had  failed  to  consider  Plaintiff's  evidence  and  witnesses  and  had  not  adequately  evaluated"
"Plaintiff's evidence and his witness Nanadawathi."
"When  considering  the  evidence  and  the  Plaint,  it  is  clear  that  Defendant  had  entered  the"
"premises in this lawsuit with the leave and licence of the husband of Nandawathi.  Plaintiff is"
"the brother of Nandawathi.  Both parties agreed on this point.  Defendant clearly states that he"
"was  an  employee  of  the  late  husband  of  Nandawathi  and  on  his  leave  and  licence  that"
"Defendant entered the premises."
"The learned District Judge had on this point rejected the stand taken by Defendant that he had"
"acquired on prescription. He had also rejected the version of  Plaintiff. That Plaintiff had given"
"leave for Defendant to continue occupation in the premises. Plaintiff had given evidence that"
"he  was  resident  in  two  addresses,  one  in  Pannipitiya  and  the  other  premises,  which  is  the"
"subject  matter.    The  learned  District  Judge  had  considered  that  a  person  could  not  hold"
"residence in two places simultaneously.  For many reasons, this can be done, but every citizen"
"of this country can have his name in one electoral register only."
"When evaluating the evidence, the learned Judge must consider the credibility of a witness"
"when Plaintiff gives evidence that he had violated the law of the land by inserting his name in"
"two electoral registers. What is the weight a Judge can give to his evidence?  Again, he had"
"stated that he did so because he wanted to admit his children to Royal College.  How can the"
"Judge evaluate evidence of a witness who says that he cheated for the gain of his children?"
