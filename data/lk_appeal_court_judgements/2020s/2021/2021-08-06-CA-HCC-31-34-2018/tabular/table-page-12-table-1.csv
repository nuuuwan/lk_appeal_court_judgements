"The learned Deputy Solicitor General conceded that the conviction could not be"
"supported  considering  the  Trial  Judge's  misdirection  and  non-direction  to  the"
"jury. He also pointed out that there was no direction with regard to ‘gang rape’"
"in the charge to the jury.  No evidence had been led to show that the second,"
"third and fourth accused had abetted or had a common intention with the first"
"accused  to  do  the  alleged  rape.    They  were  nowhere  near  the  place  where  the"
"alleged  rape  was  committed.  Therefore,  the  second,  third  and  fourth  accused"
"could not have been convicted for gang-rape charges."
