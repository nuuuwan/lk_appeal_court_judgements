"[30] This proposition is also consistent with the observations made by Privy"
"Council in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad"
"&
 Tobago (supra). The Privy Council considered the question whether the"
"conception  of 
“the  production  of 
income”  used 
in  Section  10 
(1) 
is"
"appropriate to the specific deduction under Section 10 (1) (f) of the Act.  The"
"Privy Council stated as all the sub-paragraphs in Section 10 (1) (a) -(k) are"
"not  directly  aimed  at  what  may  broadly  be  called  trade,  business  or"
"profession, the language of Section 10 (1) (f) is not necessarily related to a"
"business, the conception of the “production of income” is not intended to"
"apply to the specific deduction in Section 10 (1) (f)."
"[31] The cumulative effect of the views expressed by Basnayake, C.J. and"
"Bandaranayake, J.  is that while the word “expenses” is limited by the words"
"“incurred in the production of profits or income”, “outgoings” incurred by a"
"person  carrying  out  a  profession  could  include  a  wide  variety  of  items,"
"which would not come within the meaning of “expenses”."
"Deductions  not  allowed  in  ascertaining  profits  and  income-General"
"Prohibition of Deduction Rule-S.26"
"[32]  Next,  I  will  turn  to  deductions  prohibited  in  ascertaining  profits  and"
"income of any person in terms of the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act."
"While  Section  25  (1)  refers  to  general  deductions  allowed  in  ascertaining"
"profits  or 
income,  Section  26  deals  with  deductions  not  allowed 
in"
"ascertaining  profits  and 
income 
(general  prohibition  of  deduction). 
In"
"essence, Section 26 of the Act prescribes a negative test of deductibility and"
"prohibits  deductions  in  respect  of  all  outgoings  or  expenses  specified  in"
"Section 26 of the Act. This means that even if they fall within Section 25 (1),"
"we will still need to consider whether they would be excluded under Section"
"26  for  the  purpose  of  the  general  deductibility  or  general  limitations  on"
"deductibility."
"[33] In order to decide the question whether general deductions permitted"
"under Section 25 (1) are prohibited under Section 26 (2), Sections 25 (1) and"
"26  (2)  have  to  be  read  together  as  both  Sections  apply  to  the  general"
"deductibility of outgoings or expenses.  It was not disputed by the parties"
"at the hearing that Section 25 (1) and Section 26 must be read together in"
