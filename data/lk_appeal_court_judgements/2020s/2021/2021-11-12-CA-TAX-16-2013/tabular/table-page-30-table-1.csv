"[77] It is true that the specific deduction provision in Section 10 (1) (f), which"
"relates  to  the  deduction  of  annuities  or  other  annual  payments  is  not"
"identical to Section 25 (1) (k) of our Inland Revenue Act, but Section 26 (2)"
"of our Act  is similar to Section 12 (1)  (b) of the Income  Tax Ordinance of"
"Trinidad and Tobago.  It is not disputed, however, that Section 10 (1) of the"
"Income  Tax  Ordinance  of  Trinidad  and  Tobago 
is 
identical 
to 
the"
"corresponding Section 25 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka, which"
"specifies the general deduction rule."
"[78] The Privy Council, however dismissed the appeal on different grounds."
"The  Privy  Council  was  of  the  view  that  the  payments  to  the  trust  for  the"
"maintenance  and  benefits  of  a 
taxpayer’s 
children  are  within 
the"
"prohibition  of  Section  12  (1)  (b),  which  prohibits  any  disbursements  or"
"expenses not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for"
"the purpose of acquiring the income."
"[79] It is not in dispute that Section 12 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of"
"Trinidad  and  Tobago  relates  to  the 
limitation  to  a  general  deduction"
"provision in Section 10 (1), which prohibits deductions spelled out in Section"
"10 (1). The principle emanating from this analysis is that while the general"
"deduction  rule 
is  restricted  by  the  prohibition  of  deduction  rule,  any"
"deduction provision which has been specifically provided by any statute"
"is  not  taken  away  by  the  general  prohibition  of  deduction  unless  it  is"
"expressly prohibited by the provisions of the statute."
"[80] 
In  my  view, 
the  above  principle 
in  Patrick  Alfred  Reynolds  v."
"Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) is relevant and"
"applies in interpreting similarly structured general deduction rule in Section"
"25  (1)  and  the  prohibition  of  deduction  in  Section  26  when  a  specific"
"deduction formula has been expressly provided by a tax statute, unless the"
"effect of such specific provision has been limited by the provisions of the"
"same statute indicating any contrary legislative intention in the Act."
"Scheme of Section 25 (1) (k) and Section 26"
"[81] Now the question is whether the word “including” in Section 25 (1) (k)"
"was  intended  to  embrace  the  deductions  specified  in  sub-section  (k)  of"
