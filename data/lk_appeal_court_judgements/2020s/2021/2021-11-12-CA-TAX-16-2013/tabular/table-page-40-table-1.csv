"context  of  the  legislative  intention  indicated  in  sub-paragraph  (i)  of  the"
"proviso to Section 25 (1) (k) that the word “including” in Section 25 (1) will"
"be equivalent to “mean and include” and thus, Section 25 (1) (k) is restricted"
"by the general prohibition of deduction rule in Section 26 (2) as submitted"
"by the learned Senior State Counsel."
"[115]  The  Tax  Appeals  Commission  neither  considered  the  principle  laid"
"down in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad"
"&
 Tobago (supra) nor drew attention to the effect of the inclusive clause-"
"word “including”, in Section 25 (1) taking the context in which it is used in"
"the  statute.  It  has  totally  failed  to  consider  the  relationship  between  the"
"general provision and the specific provision, and construe its meaning as"
"occurring  in  the  body  of  the  statute  either  to  be  extensive  or  exhaustive"
"(mean and include)."
"[116] Articulated in this broad analysis, and read in its proper context, the"
"word “including” at the end of Section 25 (1) is a term of extension and not"
"a restrictive definition. In other words, the specific dedication specified in"
"Section 25 (1) (k) is wider than the general deduction formula in the body"
"of  Section  25  (1) 
in  the  sense, 
it 
is  not  subject  to  the  restrictions  on"
"deductibility  in  Section  26  (2).  In  other  words,  Section  26  (2)  does  not"
"neutralise  or  negate  the  specific  deduction  provision  in  Section  25  (1)  (k)"
"unless  a  contrary  intention  is  indicated  in  the  provisions  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act."
"Are restrictions  on  Section 25 (1) (k)  imposed  by  Section 26 or other"
"provisions of the Act?"
"[117] The rule that when the legislature has provided a specific deduction"
"rule, it is not subject to the restrictions on deductibility will not, however,"
"apply if any, contrary legislative intention is indicated in the Act, such as the"
"use of the expression “notwithstanding anything  contained in the Act” or"
"any word that neutralises the effect of any specific deduction rule."
"[118]  The 
legislature  has  provided  specific  deductions 
in  several  sub-"
"sections  of  Section  25  (1)  notwithstanding  the  prohibition  of  deductions"
"under  Section  26  (1).  Section  26  (1)  (h)  prohibits  from  deduction  any"
"expenditure of a capital nature  or  any loss of capital incurred by such"
