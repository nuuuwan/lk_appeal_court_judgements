"[8]  Being  dissatisfied  with  the  said  determination  of  the  Tax  Appeals",""
"Commission,","the  Appellant  appealed 
to 
the  Court  of  Appeal  and"
"formulated  the  following  questions  of","law 
in  the  case  stated  for  the"
"opinion of the Court of Appeal.",""
"(i)","Did the Commission err in law/misdirect itself in law, in its refusal to"
"","apply the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant in the context"
"","of two conflicting provisions involved in the present case, namely,"
"","Section 25 (1) (k) and Section 26 (2)?"
"(ii)","Did the Commission err in law by expecting an express stipulation"
"","in the section itself, as to whether it is a general provision, whereas,"
"","whether  a  section  is  a  special  or  a  general  provision  has  to  be"
"","discovered by the reader himself on a consideration of the intrinsic"
"","terms of the Section itself?"
"(iii)","Did  the  Commission  err  in  law  in  its  interpretation  of  Section  25"
"","(1)(k)  and  Section  26  (2)  which  interpretation  renders  Section  25"
"","(1)(k)  nugatory

"","proviso (1) to Section 25 (1)(k)?"

"","Tobago,  which  is  a  decision  of  highest  persuasive  authority  and"
"","which considered sections 10 and 12 of the Income Tax Ordinance"
"","of Trinidad and Tobago which sections are structurally identical with"
"","Sections 25 and 26 of the Inland Revenue Act, though the individual"
"","items of expenditure provided for the sections may be different?"
"(v)","Did  the  Commission  err  in  law/misdirect  itself  in  law  by  allowing"
"","itself to be guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case"
"","of P. D. Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue which"
"","case, has no relevance to the present case as regards the facts of"
