"purposes of such employees fall within the ambit of Section 25 (1) (k) read"
"with proviso (i) of that Section."
"[148] On the facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the"
"expenses 
incurred  by  the  Appellant  for  the  use  of  business  vehicles"
"provided  by  employees  and  others  who  owned  or  possessed  them 
in"
"connection  with  its  business  and  private  use  of  employees  would  attract"
"the rental within the ambit of the prohibition of deduction in Section 26 (2)"
"of the Act."
"[149] I hold that the general prohibition of deduction in Section 26 (2) which,"
"read together with Section 25 (1), does not take away that which has been"
"expressed provided by Section 25 (1) (k) read with proviso (i) of the Inland"
"Revenue  Act  and  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  has  erred  in  holding  that"
"Section 25 (1)(k) is restricted by Section 26 (2) and thus, expenses claimed"
"under Section 25 (1)(k) cannot be deducted."
