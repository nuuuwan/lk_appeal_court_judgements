"person,  but,  notwithstanding  such  prohibition,  a  specific  deduction  of  a"
"capital  nature  is  also  contained  in  Section  25  (1)  (b)  (i)  of  the  Act.  This"
"provision, irrespective of it being a capital nature, specifically deducts “any"
"sum  equal  to  one 
fourth  of  any  payment  made  by  such  person  as"
"consideration  for  obtaining  a  license  in  his  favour  of  any  manufacturing"
"process used by such person in any trade or business by such person."
"[119]  Another  example  is  Section  25  (1)  (b)  (ii).  Irrespective  of  whether"
"Section 26 (1) (h) prohibits from deduction any expenditure of a capital"
"nature, the specific deduction of capital nature is also contained in Section"
"25  (1)  (b)  (ii)  of  the  Act.    This  provision,  irrespective  of  it  being  a  capital"
"nature,  specifically  deducts  “a  sum  equal  to  one  tenth  of  the  cost  of"
"acquisition of any intangible asset, other than goodwill, acquired by such"
"person, subject to the proviso contained therein."
"[120] 
In 
these 
two  examples, 
the 
legislature  has 
intended 
that  any"
"expenditure  of  a  capital  nature  which 
is  generally  not  allowed  to  be"
"deducted under Section 26 (1) (h) is to be deducted as specific deductions"
"under Section 25 (1)  (b) (i) and (ii),  despite such deductions are of capital"
"expenditures. If the legislature intended to deduct all expenses of a capital"
"nature as general deductions under Section 26 (1), there was no need for"
"the 
legislature  to  specifically  deduct  certain  other  capital  expenses 
in"
"section  25 
(1) 
(b) 
(i)  and 
(ii),  unless 
it 
is  provided 
in 
the  Act 
that"
"notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  Section  25  (1)  (b)  (i)  and  (ii),  the"
"provisions of Section 26 (1) (h) would apply."
"[121] There is another example in Section 26 (1) (g) and Section 25 (1) (l)."
"Section 26 (1) (g) prohibits from general deduction any disbursements or"
"expenses of such person, not being money expended for the purpose of"
"producing such profits or income. Despite such prohibition from deduction,"
"the legislature has permitted a specific deduction in Section 25 (1) (I), which"
"specifically  deducts  any  expenditure 
incurred  by  a  company 
in 
the"
"liquidation, which is not incurred in the production of profits or income of"
"a company. Despite the fact that the expenditure incurred in the liquidation"
"of  a  company  is  not  incurred  in  the  production  of  profits  or  income,  the"
"legislature intended that such expenses would be specifically deducted by"
"Section 25 (1) (I)."
