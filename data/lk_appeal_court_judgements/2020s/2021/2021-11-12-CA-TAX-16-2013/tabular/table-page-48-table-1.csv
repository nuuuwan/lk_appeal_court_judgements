"[144]  The 
legislature 
intended 
that 
the  prohibition  of  deduction 
in"
"paragraph  (a)  and  paragraph  (b)  to  be  applicable  to  types  of  vehicles  on"
"which  depreciation  and  renewal  of  any  capital  asset  employed  by  such"
"person.  The  prohibition  of  deduction  under  Section  26  (2),  will  apply  in"
"respect of such vehicles used either for travelling referred to in Section 26"
"(2) (a) or rental referred to in Section 26 (2)(b). Articulated by this analysis"
"and having regard to the legislative intention, purpose and the context in"
"which  the  language  is  used  in  Section  26  (2),  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"legislature did not intend the prohibition to be applicable to other types of"
"vehicles not referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 26 (2)."
"[145]  On  the  other  hand,  the 
legislature  has  limited  the  scope  of  the"
"deduction allowed under Section 25 (1) (k) and singled out certain special"
"category of persons, vehicles and the approved method of payment to be"
"eligible for deduction. The legislature, by enacting the sub-paragraph (i) of"
"the proviso to Section 25 (1) (k), first, disallowed the deduction, if the vehicle"
"is used partly for trade or business and partly for private purpose of the"
"employee. The legislature then restricted such prohibition and allowed the"
"deduction if the value of the benefit has been included in the remuneration"
"of  such  employees  for  the  purpose  of  deduction  of  income  tax  under"
"Chapter XIV of the Act."
"[146]  The  actual  travelling  expenses  incurred  by  an  employer  for  using"
"vehicles  partly  for  the  purposes  of  his  trade,  business,  profession  or"
"vocation and partly for the domestic or  private purposes of an executive"
"officer employed by him or a non-executive director of such organisation"
"are intended by the legislature to be deducted in Section 25 (1) (k) where"
"the  value  of  the  benefit  has  been  included  in  the  remuneration  of  such"
"employees for the purpose  of deduction of tax under  Chapter  XIV of the"
"Act."
"[147] On the other hand, no such concept is envisaged by the legislature in"
"Section  26  (2)  in  prohibiting  deductions  in  respect  of  vehicle  used  for"
"travelling  or  rental  in  connection  with  the  employerâ€™s  trade  or  business"
"activities  referred  to 
in  that  Section.  For  those  reasons,  the  travelling"
"expenses  incurred  by  the  Appellant  for  the  use  of  the  vehicles  from  the"
"employees and others in connection with its business activities and private"
