"Dhammika Ganepola, J."
"The Petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Writ"
"of Certiorari to quash the quit notice issued in terms of the Government"
"Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969, marked as P11 to the"
"Petition.  Both  parties  agreed  to  get  the  argument  disposed  by  way  of"
"written  submissions.  Anyhow  none  of  the  parties  have  filed  the  written"
"submissions.  There  are  several  connected  matters  that  were  taken  up"
"together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to"
"each are different. The Petitioner states that he was an employee of the"
"Prima Ceylon Ltd since 24.07.2003. While he was serving at Prima Ceylon"
"Ltd., he had been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises at F-16 in"
"Daanyagama  Housing  Scheme,  China  Bay,  Trincomalee.  On  29.09.2014,"
"upon a Lease Agreement (marked as P4) has been entered into between"
"the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner for a period of one year based"
"on its annual renewal. However, the Petitioner is no more an employee at"
"the  Prima  Ceylon  Ltd  and  is  currently  employed  at  the  National  Water"
"Supply  and  Drainage  Board  with  effect  from  11.04.2018.  Despite  being"
"employed at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, the Petitioner"
"still  remains  in  the  possession  of  the  said  premises.  Petitioner  further"
"states that when he attempted to pay his monthly rental, the said rentals"
"were rejected by the then Food Commissioner. Later on, the Petitioner has"
"been  served  with  a  quit  notice 
in  term  of  the  Government  Quarters"
"(Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  No.03  of  1971,  dated  18th  February  2019"
"(P11)  demanding  him  to  hand  over  the  vacant  possession  of  the  said"
"premises alleging that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the terms of"
"the said Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner"
"has made this application moving for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit"
"notice marked P11 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for"
"the reasons mentioned below."
"i. 
no valid reason has been given and the reasons stated in the said"
"notice are vague"
"ii. 
the Respondent has procured a violation of the Lease Agreement by"
"refusing to accept the rental payment."
"The Petitioner conceded the fact that the subject house and the premises"
"has  been  granted  to  him  by  the  Food  Commissioner  upon  a  Lease"
"Agreement p4 and the applicability of the Government Quarters (Recovery"
"of Possession) Act to the subject house and premises is also not disputed."
"The Petitioner denies the allegation of violation of any term or condition"
