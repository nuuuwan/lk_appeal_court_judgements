"the Defendant is not in a position to raise an issue before the appellate Court,"
"pertaining to the identification of the corpus, where the corpus was admitted"
"by him before the trial judge, and when there was no issue before the trial"
"judge, in respect of the identification of the corpus, it cannot be taken up in"
"appeal as an issue."
"The corpus in this case is morefully described in schedule B of the plaint"
"which is in extent of Five acres (5A-0R-0P). For the purpose of this action,"
"Mr. K. Retnarajah, Licensed Surveyor has made a plan marked P1 and the"
"report of the Commissioner is produced as P1a. Having superimposed the"
"title plans, the Commissioner has properly identified the subject matter as"
"lots 2, 3, 4 and 5 in plan P1 which is the land described in schedule B."
"It  is  pertinent  to  note  that,  although  the  respondents  had  taken  up  the"
"position in their answer that the subject matter was not properly identified,"
"they  failed  to  frame  an  issue  in  this  regard.    In  the  case  of  Hanafi  vs."
"Nallamma2 the Supreme Court held that “…..Once issues are framed the"
"case which the court has to hear and determine becomes crystallised in the"
"issues and the pleadings recede to the background……”"
"In the circumstances, it is clear that the question of the identification of the"
"subject  matter  in  this  case  was  not  put  in  issue  before  the  trial  Judge."
"Hence,  the  respondents  are  precluded  from  taking  up  such  an  issue  in"
"appeal."
"Title of the plaintiff to the subject matter:"
"It is settled law that, in revindicatio actions the onus of proof of title to the"
"subject matter is always with the plaintiff. In the event of failure on the part"
"of the plaintiff to establish his title, his action is liable to be dismissed."
