"cause before the Court, after giving an opportunity to the appellant to show cause, by order"
"dated 10.06.2011. the learned Additional Magistrate issued the ‘writ of possession’. Being"
"aggrieved by the said order the appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of"
"Colombo. The learned High Court Judge, by the order dated 10.11.2017, affirmed the order"
"of the learned Additional Magistrate. The appellant seeks to set aside the said orders of the"
"learned Additional Magistrate and the High Court Judge by this appeal. The main argument"
"of  the  appellant  before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  has  been  that  the  respondent  is  not  the"
"competent authority to make an application under and in terms of the Act to recover the"
"possession  of  the  quarters.  Refusing  to  accept  that  argument,  the  learned  Additional"
"Magistrate  issued  the  writ  of  possession.  In  revision,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"affirming  the  order  of  the  Additional  Magistrate,  held  that  the  appellant  has  failed  to"
"establish the exceptional circumstances to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of the High"
"Court."
