"there is no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to prove that the penetration that"
"had occurred into the vagina of  the victim  had been  penile. There  is no  other"
"evidence,  for  example  semen,  to show  that  there had been  penile penetration."
"Hence,  the  Senior  State  Counsel  conceded  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to"
"prove the offence of Rape. In the above premise I find, for want of evidence on"
"the main element of penile penetration, the prosecution has failed to prove the"
"charge  of  Rape  and  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  erred  when  she"
"convicted the accused for rape. Hence, the conviction of the appellant for rape"
"is set aside."
