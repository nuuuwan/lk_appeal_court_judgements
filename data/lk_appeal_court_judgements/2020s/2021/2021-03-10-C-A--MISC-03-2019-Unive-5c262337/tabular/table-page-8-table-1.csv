"the 14 day period would expire on a Monday namely 22 nd April 2019. There is no averment"
"in the Petition of Appeal that was received by the Court of Appeal to the effect that the"
"office of the Court of Appeal was closed on 22 nd April 2019. I have observed in an anterior"
"part of this judgment that the Appellant has dated its Petition of Appeal  on  23rd April"
"2019.  There  is  no  averment  anywhere  in  the  Petition  of  Appeal 
that  the  office  of  the"
"Registry of the Court of Appeal was closed on 23rd April 2019, which was in fact the lS'h"
"day from  09.04.2019. 
It is  apparent from  the date stamp on  the Petition of Appeal that"
"the Petition of Appeal was not filed even on 23rd April 2019-the lS'h day. The date stamp"
"clearly indicates that that the appeal was filed only on the 16th day namely 24th April 2019."
