"H
aving investigated the title under section 23 of the Partition Act no. 21 of 1977, it is my view that the"
"claim of prescription by the 01st 2nd and 18th defendants had not been established for the whole of Lot 4,"
"before the learned trial Judge. Therefore, the claim to the entirety of Lot 4 of the Preliminary Plan by the"
"01st, 2nd and 18th defendant-appellants and their request for the said lots should be excluded from the"
"corpus cannot be accepted. They are entitled only for the 26 Perches which was given to them by John"
"Singho on deed No.1014 dated 1971.02.03 and entitled for prescriptive rights, for the following buildings"
"and soil covered by the said buildings only. Considering the long stay, permitted to have the possession"
"of building numbers 17, 18, 19 & 20 in schedule 1 of the X 1 report."
"When a land is gifted or transfer by a deed, it creates a co-ownership, as far as paper title is concerned,"
"there cannot be any dispute on equal shares between the parties. The question is as regards prescriptive"
"title in the manner claimed by the defendant. The 18th defendant had not prescribed to the entire lot 4 in"
"plan X. Before examining these competing claims, let me turn to the law relating to prescription among"
"co-owners."
"The substantive principle of law regarding this matter was authoritatively laid down in the case of Corea"
"v.  Iseris  Appuhamy  15  NLR  65,  in  which  it  is  stated  that  the  possession  of  one  co-owner  is  in  law  the"
"possession of the other co-owners. It was also laid down in that case that it was not possible for one co-"
"owner to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in his mind and that nothing short of an"
"ouster or something equivalent could bring about that result."
"The principle of substantial law laid down in that case, was refined in the case of Tillekeratne v. Bastian 21"
"NLR 12, by the application from the field of the law of evidence, a presumption, that it was open to court"
"from the lapse of time, in conjunction with other circumstances of a case, to presume that possession"
"originally that of a co-owner, had since become adverse."
"In Simon Perera Vs. Jayatunge 71 NLR 339, it was decided that there was sufficient evidence of ouster and"
"that B had acquired as against the other co-owners, prescriptive title from the time of ouster in respect"
"of the lot which she possessed exclusively in pursuance of the amicable division. In this case Thambiah J."
"said that ""the question whether a co-owner has acquired prescriptive title to a divided lot as against the"
"other co-owners is one of fact and has to be determined by the circumstances of each case.”"
"It would be essential to keep in mind that the law relating to co-ownership and “Ouster” to be entitled for"
"the defendant to claim the entire corpus, as against the other co-owners. The contention of the 1st 2nd"
"and 18A defendants seems to be that the 1st, 2nd and 18A defendants have prescribed to the entire lot 4"
"by long possession adverse to the plaintiff. But it was not proved."
"In Seetiya Vs. Ukku 1986 (1) SLR 225, it was decided that nothing short of ouster or something equivalent"
"to ouster is necessary to make possession adverse and end co-ownership. Although it is open to a court"
"from lapse of time in conjunction with other circumstances of a case to presume that possession originally"
"that of a co-owner had later become adverse, the fact of co-owners possessing different lots, fencing them"
"and planting them with a plantation of coconut which is a common plantation in the area cannot make"
"such possession adverse."
"The  substituted  plaintiff  giving  evidence  at  the  trial  mentioned  that  her  grandfather  did  not  take"
"possession  of  the  land  and  allowed  the  18th  defendant  to  be  in  possession  of  same.  It  was  her  oral"
"testimony to such effect and there was iota of evidence although the 1st, 2nd and 18A defendant-appellants"
"have vehemently denied such leave and licensee of Arnolis Perera from 1941. The substituted plaintiff"
