"states  that  the  plantation  was  also  enjoyed  by  her  predecessors  in  title  and  it  was  a  reasonable  oral"
"testimony to prove such fact."
"The substituted plaintiff denied that the 2nd defendant had obtained a share of 26 Perches by deed already"
"marked as ‘පැ 12’ and later marked as ‘2වි1’. It is evident that ‘පැ 12’ was a transfer deed and the 2nd"
"defendant was given 26 Perches of land as a settlement on 03.02.1971 in Panadura District Court Case"
"No. 12349/P.  The dispute appears to have started in 1970, when the 18th defendant and the 2nd defendant"
"were attempting to put up a house on the disputed land. The plaintiffs in case No. 12349/P were Arnolis"
"and Chilbert and they were having life interest in the said disputed property. They filed case No. 12349/P"
"seeking an injunction restraining the 18th defendant in the present case (Themis) and his son 2th defendant"
"in the present case (Albert), for erecting a house on the disputed land. Although the substituted plaintiff"
"denied that the 2nd defendant had obtained a share of 26 Perches by a deed already marked as ‘පැ 12’ and"
"later marked as ‘2වි1’, the 2nd defendant was given the said deed for 26 Perches of land on deed No. 1014"
"dated 03.02.1971. Thus, the substituted plaintiff’s denial has no merit in this issue."
"After  the  plaintiff  closed  her  case  marking  in  evidence  up to  ‘පැ  18’  the  2nd  defendant  started to  give"
"evidence.  The 2nd defendant vehemently denied that his father, 18th defendant was a leave and licensee"
"of Arnolis Perera (grandfather of the Substituted plaintiff-respondent)."
"It was argued by the 1st, 2nd and 18A defendant-appellants that the learned District Judge had failed to"
"consider the fact that they have prescribed to Lot 4 after 1941, in the absence of any leave and licensee"
"of the 18th defendant.  Accordingly, all the issues raised by the said defendant-appellants were answered"
"in the negative."
"1st, 2nd and 18A defendant-appellants says that the learned District Judge has failed to appreciate, the 18th"
"defendant, had started to possess the land as of his own, against the ownership of Arnolis Perera after"
"the Fiscal’s Conveyance was executed in the year 1941, which phenomenon is interpreted as ‘Adverse"
"Possession” thereafter."
"In the case of Government Agent Western Province Vs. Perera 11 NLR 337, the usufructuary mortgagees"
"of a land purchased the land at a sale by the Fiscal under a subsequent mortgage, and claimed to set off"
"the amount due on their mortgage against the purchase money.  The usufructuary mortgagees did not"
"obtain any Fiscal’s transfer, but possessed the land for over ten years.  A Bench of three Judges of the"
"Supreme court held that the usufructuary mortgagees had acquired title by prescription to the land, in as"
"much as, after their purchases at the Fiscal’s sale, the character of their possession changed and thereafter"
"they did not possess the land."
"In Alwis Vs. Perera 21 NLR 321, a person transferred his lands to certain relatives, but continued to be in"
"possession  of  same  for  sixty  years  until  the  date  of  action.    The  Supreme  Court  held  that,  in  the"
"circumstances of the case, the possession was not permissive and it was decided to have become adverse."
"1st, 2nd and 18A defendant-appellants further say that in the present case they and their mother had been"
"in exclusive possession of Lot 4 of Preliminary Plan which lot is separately fenced off from the rest of the"
"land, until this action was instituted in 1977. The substituted plaintiff had tried to prove to Court that after"
"1941, the 18th  defendant was  in a permissive  possession.  It was only  her oral testimony and no other"
"witnesses were called to corroborate such evidence. In fact, when she gave evidence in this action, she"
"was 40 years at that time, which denoted that she was born during 1950’s."
"The 2nd defendant-appellant himself gave evidence that they were in possession of Lot 4 from 1941 for"
"nearly 37 years without any leave and license of any person.  In their statement of claim filed by the 18th"
