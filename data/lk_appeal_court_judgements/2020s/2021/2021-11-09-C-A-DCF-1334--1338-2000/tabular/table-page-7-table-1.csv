"At the trial 58 issues were raised. The learned counsel for the 15th defendant-appellant says that the issues"
"which concern the  15th  defendant  are 39 to 53. All these issues were  answered ""Yes"" by the learned"
"District  Judge.  However,  these  issues  were  not  discussed  in  the  judgement  clearly  to  permit  a  proper"
"decree be entered and some of the issues although decided in favour of the 15th defendant, were wrongly"
"decided.  Further,  she  says  that  being  aggrieved  by  the  judgement  to  this  extent  the  15th  defendant-"
"appellant decided to appeal from the said judgement to have the issues so answered correctly, confirmed"
"and included in the interlocutory decree and the issues wrongly assessed be corrected."
"Issues 39 — 42 do not arise because these issues are covered by the settlement entered in the case."
"It was argued by the 15th defendant-appellant that learned District Judge has held in the course of the"
"judgement  that  Punchi  Appu  died  leaving  6  children.  The  evidence  in  the  case  is  that  he  died  leaving"
"several children, 5 according to some and 6 according to others, but there was an agreement that only 3"
"children, Joronis, Silunduhamy and Peiris lived to inherit rights."
"Peiris by deed 1903 in year 1895 (marked as 15වි10) gave 1/12 share to Appusingho. The learned District"
"Judge  has  correctly  answered  issue 42.  By  issue 57  the  learned District  Judge has  held that  this share"
"devolved according to the 15th defendant's statement of claim but the correct position should be that it"
"devolved according to the evidence led."
"It was further argued by the 15th defendant-appellant that the learned District Judge has correctly held,"
"by deed 6162 (Marked 15වි2) Joronis gave 1/8 to Kahawalage Arnolis. Issue 44 was correctly answered"
"but he has answered issue 49 according to the judgement. It is not clear how Arnolis' rights devolved."
"Arnolis' rights devolved on Dandiris and his rights devolved by Deed 6820 (Marked as 15වි9) on Ekmon"
"and Maggie. The devolution should be, as set out in the evidence of the 15th defendant. There was no"
"serious challenge to this evidence. The learned Trial Judge has answered issue 45 as “yes”. Although the"
"issue  was  raised  by  the  15th  defendant,  he  abandoned  the  position  that  Silunduhamy  married  Arnolis"
"Perera.  His position was abandoned when he gave  his evidence.  This was because  the 5th  defendant"
"proved that Silunduhamy married Velun."
"It  was  argued  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  15th  defendant-appellant  that,  the  15th  defendant  only"
"claims the rights of Appusingho as a child of Silunduhamy. The rights of Appusingho were obtained by"
"deed  1903  (marked  as  15වි10).  The  15th  defendant-appellant  concedes  that  issues  45,  46,  47  were"
"answered wrong. Issue 48 was answered wrong because Dandiris was not a child of Silunduhamy and a"
"brother of Appusingho. The learned District Judge has answered issues 52 and 53 correctly and the said"
"evidence was discussed in the judgement."
"The 16th defendant and his son, the 19th defendant-appellant moved to have lot 1 in the X plan excluded"
"on the ground that they and their predecessors in title had prescribed to to the said lot 1. The pedigree"
"they set out in their statements of claim says that they were not co-owners along with the other parties"
"to the land sought to be partitioned. The 16th defendant died during the pendency of this action. His son,"
"the 19th defendant was, substituted in that place."
"The surveyor in his report marked X1 stated that only the 16th defendant claimed the plantations and the"
"buildings  on  lot  1.  The  plaintiff  and  the  other  contesting  defendants  conceded  that  only  the  16th"
"defendant possessed lot 1. The 16th defendant also produced the deed marked 1901. In that deed, Lot 1"
"is  described  as  a  defined  and  separate  land  with  distinct  boundaries.    The  learned  District  Judge  in"
"answering the issues holds that the 16th and 19th defendants have not proved that they have prescribed"
"to Lot 1. Being aggrieved by the said judgement the 19th defendant-appellant appealed to this court on"
"the following grounds."
