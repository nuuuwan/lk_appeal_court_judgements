"(f) 
In fiscal deed 3571 of 1895 marked 5වි2, it was alleged that the rights of Punchinona,"
"the widow of Joronis, were purchased. It may be stated that on this deed and the"
"following deeds 5වි11 and 5වි12, no rights passed to Punchinona since she had died"
"before 1875, vide deed 5වි10. Therefore, the balance rights of Joronis had devolved"
"on their 2 children Meinona and Gamage Arnolis."
"It  is  my  view  that  the  learned  Trial  Judge  had  erred  in  not  considering  the  above  documents  in  his"
"Judgment  and  had  erroneously  accepted  the  devolution  set  up  by  the  15th  defendant  and  erred  in"
"answering the Issues pertaining to the said devolution in favor of the 15th defendant."
"It was argued by the 5B & 27 defendant-appellants that Joronis who was entitled to 1/6 share had married"
"in community of property and after executing deed 5වි10, his balance 1/12 had devolved on his 2 children"
"Meinona and Gamage Arnolis Perera, each of whom becoming entitled to 1/24 shares. The devolution of"
"Meinona’s 1/24 on deeds 5වි14, 5වි15, 5වි16 and 5වි17 was to Gamage Arnolis Perera who was the father"
"of the 5th defendant and the brother of Meinona. All those deeds deal with a 1/24 share. Similarly, the"
"1/24 share, which the other child of Joronis who was Gamage Arnolis Perera had inherited devolved on"
"his wife Isabella Perera on deeds 5වි19 and 5වි20. These deeds too correctly deal with 1/24 share.  The"
"learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the said documents."
"When this case had come up for further hearing on 03.12.1992 three further issues had been raised. Those"
"were issues 59, 60, and 61 which had been accepted by Court. (vide pages 585 and 586 of the brief). The"
"learned Trial Judge has not answered these issues in his judgment."
