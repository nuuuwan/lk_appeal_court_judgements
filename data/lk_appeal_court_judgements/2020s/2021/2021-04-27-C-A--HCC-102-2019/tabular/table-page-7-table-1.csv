"that  in  the  statement,  the  deceased  has  only  described  how  he  saw  the  knife"
"carried  by 
the  appellant  saying 
that  due 
to 
the  available  moonlight,  he"
"managed to see that the appellant was carrying a white-coloured pointed knife."
"In  explaining  his 
injuries, 
the  deceased  person  has  given  an  accurate"
"description,  which  was  in  line  with  the  evidence  of  the  JMO  and  has  stated"
"that he fell unconscious after receiving the injuries. This explains very well the"
"reason  why  the  person  who  came  to  the  scene  of  the  incident  subsequently,"
"and  who  took  the  deceased  to  the  hospital,  namely,  PW-01  Ranjith  Lowe’s,"
"failure to ask the deceased about the incident as the deceased would not have"
"been in his proper senses."
"PW-01  in  his  evidence  has  identified  the  paramour  of  the  deceased  who  was"
"with  him  when  he  reached  the  scene  of  the  incident  as  one  ‘Baby’,  but  has"
"identified her as the wife of the appellant Nimal Anthony. The deceased in his"
"statement  has  named  his  paramour  as  Hettige  Dushanthi  De  Silva  and  has"
"stated  that  she  is  the  legal  wife  of  Nimal.  It  is  therefore  clear  that  the  female"
"referred by PW-01 as Baby and by the deceased as Dushanthi refers to one and"
"the same person, namely, the paramour of the deceased."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the relevant legal"
"principles  before  coming  to  his  finding  that  PW-05  was  telling  the  truth  as  to"
"the recording of the statement of the deceased and he has recorded the same"
"accurately. After deciding so, the learned trial judge has proceeded to consider"
"the  statement  and  the  other  circumstantial  evidence  to  test  the  accuracy  and"
"the truthfulness of the statement and has come to a firm finding that it relates"
"to the cause of the death of the deceased and the circumstances that led to the"
"death,  in  deciding  to  accept  the  same  as  relevant  under  section  32(1)  of  the"
"Evidence Ordinance, for which I find no reasons to disagree."
"I  am  unable  to  agree  with  the  contention  of  the 
learned  counsel 
for  the"
"appellant that not calling the male nurse who was in charge of the ICU at the"
"time  the  statement  was  recorded  by  PW-05  as  a  witness  relevant,  as  the"
"7"
