"with regard to his evidence. There was no ground or legal barrier set forth by the"
"defence for Court to disregard the evidence of PW 6."
"The counsel for the appellant unsuccessfully attempted to show that PW 6"
"was giving evidence against the accused appellant, as PW 6’s uncle “Sumith”"
"was not in good terms with the appellant. PW 6 has clearly answered that he did"
"not  know  of  any  known  animosity  existed  between  his  uncle  Sumith  and  the"
"appellant. This evidence was unchallenged and believable."
"I
n the overall perusal of the evidence of PW 6 it is quite clear, coherent,"
"cogent, without any reservation and believable which has not been challenged in"
"cross examination. Therefore, the trial judge’s conclusion is justifiable."
"After  the  conclusion  of  the  argument  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant  has"
"submitted to this Court many authorities in support of the grounds that were raised"
"on behalf of the accused appellant. It is very salutary of the counsel to assist court"
"in that respect."
"I  have  closely  perused  the  evidence,  the  submissions  and  the  relevant"
"authorities pertaining to the issues raised in this case."
"I have also considered the following issue."
"It is trite law that the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond"
"reasonable  doubt.  This  being  a  case  that  has  rested  mainly  on  circumstantial"
"evidence from which the inference of guilt is drawn must be cogently established;"
"it must also be established that the crime was committed by no one else but by"
"the accused; the evidence should only be consistent with the guilt of the accused"
"and inconsistent with his innocence."
