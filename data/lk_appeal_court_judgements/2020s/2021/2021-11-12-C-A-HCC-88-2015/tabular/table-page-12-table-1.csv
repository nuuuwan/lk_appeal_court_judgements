"In State of UP. v Krishna Master AIR 2010 SC 3071 it was held;"
"“This Court is of the firm opinion that it would be doing injustice to"
"a child witness possessing sharp memory to say that it is inconceivable for"
"him to recapitulate facts in his memory witnessed by him long ago. A child"
"of tender age is always receptive to abnormal events which take place in its"
"life and would never forget those events for the rest of his life. The child"
"would be able to recapitulate correctly and exactly when asked about the"
"same in future.”"
