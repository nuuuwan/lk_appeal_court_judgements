"Section 5 had thereafter been annexed as ‘1R6’. What has been annexed as ‘1R6’ is"
"the signed declaration made by the then  Minister of Lands and  Land Development,"
"supported by an affidavit of the said Minister of Lands who had signed ‘1R6’. While"
"the Section 5(1) notice had not been published in the Gazette, the Section 5 notice"
"referred  to  by  the  State  was  available  for  the  Petitioner  to  see.  Therefore,  it  was"
"open to the Petitioner to take any objection with regard to the legality or validity of"
"the said notice, which the Petitioner did not do."
