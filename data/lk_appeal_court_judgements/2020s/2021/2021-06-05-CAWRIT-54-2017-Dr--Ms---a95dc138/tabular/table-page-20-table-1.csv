"Commission who is the 27th Respondent an opportunity of placing before this Court"
"any material to rebut the said argument, including the fact that the marking scheme"
"does not form part of the Scheme of Recruitment. I am therefore of the view that the"
"Petitioner is estopped from raising that argument at this belated stage."
"I
 shall now consider the several objections raised by the learned Senior State Counsel"
"and the learned Counsel for the 37th Respondent."
"T
he first is that the Petitioner has not sought a Writ of Mandamus to appoint her as"
"Senior Lecturer (Grade II) nor has she prayed for a Writ of Mandamus directing the"
"1st  Respondent  to  re-advertise  the  post  or  conduct  fresh  interviews.  Furthermore,"
"even though the Petitioner is complaining of the allocation of 30% of the total marks"
"for  the  presentation  and 
interview,  she  has  not  sought  an  order  directing  the"
"marking scheme to be amended. The failure to seek the said relief has prompted the"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  37th  Respondent  to  argue  that  it  would  be  futile  for  this"
"Court to proceed with this application."
"W
hile  on  the  face  of  it,  it  appears  that  the  above  submission  has  merit,  on  a  close"
"consideration, 
I  am  of  the  view  that  had 
it  been  established  that  the  process"
"followed by the 1st Respondent was illegal, improper or irrational, I would certainly"
"have  considered 
issuing  the  Writ  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  said  appointment."
"Although such a decision would have affected the 37th Respondent who took up this"
"appointment having relinquished his previous appointment, this Court cannot ignore"
"any  illegality  in  the  name  of  futility.  The  consequence  of  such  a  decision  would  be"
"that  the  1st  Respondent  would  have  to  re-advertise  the  post,  thus  affording  the"
"Petitioner, the 37th Respondent and any suitably qualified person to apply."
"T
his  brings  me  to  the  question  of  laches,  which  is  the  next  objection  raised  by  the"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  37th  Respondent.  The  final  interview  had  been  held  on  1st"
"November  2016.  By  letter  dated  10th  November  2016  marked  ‘P17’,  the  Petitioner"
"wrote  to  the  2nd  Respondent,  the  Vice  Chancellor  raising  concerns  regarding  the"
"marks awarded for Undergraduate performance, and that comparing marks obtained"
"at  the  Undergraduate  level  is  not  proper.  Thus,  it  is  clear  that  by  10th  November"
"2016,  the  Petitioner  was  aware  of  what  the  Final  Interview  Panel  had  decided  on"
"Section One."
"20"
