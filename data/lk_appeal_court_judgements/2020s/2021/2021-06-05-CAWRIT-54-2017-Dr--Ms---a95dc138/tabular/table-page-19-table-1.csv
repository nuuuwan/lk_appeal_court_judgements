"The Petitioner has stated in her petition that, ‘a proper selection need not necessarily"
"incorporate a marking scheme but if the selection is to be on the basis of marks, then"
"the  scheme  must  be  clear,  fair  and  uniform’.  Having  said  so,  the  Petitioner  is  now"
"claiming that allocation of marks at an interview is subjective and can lead to abuse."
"It is common knowledge that an interview while having a structure cannot be limited"
"to  that  structure.  To  do  so  would  unnecessarily  fetter  the  ability  of  the  Selection"
"Committee to apply their expertise and select the best candidate. If the argument of"
"the Petitioner is to be accepted, an interview might as well be replaced by a written"
"questionnaire to be filled by a candidate."
