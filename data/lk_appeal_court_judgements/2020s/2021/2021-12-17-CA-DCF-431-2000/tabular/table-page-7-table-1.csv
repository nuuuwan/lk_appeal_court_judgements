"Therefore,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  of  evidence,  one  can  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the land shown as Lots 1 and 2 in the Preliminary Plan is the"
"corpus in this case."
"The Commissioner in cross-examination had admitted that he had shown the"
"land Tikittadeniya at 3 places in the Preliminary Plan as an adjoining land. He"
"had shown Tikittadeniya to the North, North West and West. The Commissioner"
"had shown මල ඇල as a boundary in the West, and North West and the Land"
"Tikittadeniya  is  shown  on  the  other  side  of  මල  ඇල  and  according  to  the"
"schedule to the Plaint, මල ඇල is the western boundary of the corpus. But the"
"Commissioner had shown Tikittadeniyahena as the Northern boundary of the"
"corpus.  According  to  the  Preliminary  Plan  marked  ‘X’  the  Commissioner  has"
"shown මල ඇල going round the corpus except on the southern boundary where"
"there is a road. Therefore, he had shown මල ඇල along  the Eastern, Western"
"and Northern boundaries of the land surveyed. The Commissioner admitted that"
"in cross-examination. But the western boundary of the corpus is described in the"
"schedule  to  the  Plaint  as  the  “Mala  Ela”  which  separates  this 
land  from"
"Gonnagahamulanahena  and  it  is  only  in  the  western  boundary  that  Mala  Ela"
"separates 
the 
corpus 
from 
the 
adjoining 
land  Gonnagahamulanahena."
"Therefore, nothing flows out of this cross examination."
"‘Mala 
Ela’  which 
separates 
the 
corpus 
from 
the 
land 
to 
the  west,"
"Gonnagahamulanahena  is  a  prominent  physical  demarcation  of  the  western"
"boundary which helps to identify the corpus. Even in the Partition Plan No. 3310"
"marked 5වි5, the Final Plan in case No. 39076 prepared as far back as 1933, this"
"මල  ඇල 
is 
shown 
as 
a 
boundary 
between 
Tikittadeniyahena 
and"
"Gonnagahamulanahena and according to the description of lands contained in"
"the final decree marked 5වි4, the southern boundary of Lot A of Tikittadeniya is"
"Mala Ela. The land to the south and south west of Lot A of Tikittadeniyahena is"
"Lot  A  of  Gonnagahamula  hena.  That  shows  that  Mala  Ela  was  the  common"
"boundary 
between 
Lot 
A 
of 
Tikittadeniyahena 
and 
Lot 
A 
of"
"Gonnagahamulanahena.  Even 
in  Plan  marked  5වි6  relied  upon  by  the  5th"
"Defendant-Appellant, ‘Mala Ela’ is shown as the western boundary of the land"
"in dispute and on the other side of ‘Mala Ela’ is Gonnagahamula hena."
"In Preliminary Plan marked ‘X’  the Commissioner had shown Gonnagahamula"
"hena as the land to the west of the land surveyed and the ‘Mala Ela’ separates"
"Gonnagahamula hena from the land surveyed."
