"The Commissioner had reported that the 1st Defendant is in possession of the"
"high land and the paddy field. According to the Surveyor’s Report, there are 2"
"houses, a kitchen and a toilet in the land and the Surveyor had reported that the"
"2nd and 3rd Defendants who are the sons of the 1st Defendant are living in the"
"land.  Therefore,  one  can  come  to  the  conclusion  that  after  the  purchase  of"
"undivided rights in the corpus in 1977, the 1st Defendant with her sons had been"
"in possession of this land. The 1st Defendant had cultivated the high land and the"
"paddy field attached to it and her sons had been residing in the land. Prior to"
"1977, the 1st Defendant’s husband had been in possession of the land and he"
"had cultivated the land on an informal lease. Thereafter, the 1st Defendant had"
"purchased  rights  from  the  owners  of  Tikittadeniyahena  on  the  basis  that  the"
"land is Tikittadeniyahena. That shows that the deeds produced by the Plaintiff"
"(was) were acted upon and the 1st Defendant and her predecessors in title had"
"possessed  this 
land  as  Tikittadeniyahena.  On  the  other  hand,  there 
is  no"
"evidence 
to 
show 
that 
the  5th  Defendant  had  possessed 
this 
land  as"
"Gonnagahamulanahena, other than the bare statement of her husband."
"For the aforementioned reasons, on a balance of probabilities of evidence, one"
"can  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the 
land  shown  as  Lots  1  and  2 
in  the"
"Preliminary Plan No. 1105 marked ‘X’ at the trial is the corpus in this case and"
"the learned District Judge has come to a correct conclusion in respect of that"
"matter. Although the learned District Judge had failed to evaluate the evidence"
"in  a  satisfactory  manner  and  to  reason  out  the  findings,  I  am  satisfied  that"
"ultimately he had come to a correct conclusion which can be  justified for the"
"reasons I have setout above. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with the"
"findings of the learned District Judge.  We affirm the judgment of the learned"
"District Judge dated 20.06.2000 and  dismiss the appeal of the 5th Defendant-"
"Appellant.  The  5th  Defendant-Appellant  shall  pay  the  Plaintiff-Respondent  Rs."
"15,000/- as the costs of this Appeal. The 5th Defendant-Appellant also shall pay"
"Rs.  15,000/-  as  the  cost  of  this  Appeal  to  the  1st,  2nd,  3rd  and  4th  Defendant-"
"Respondents."
