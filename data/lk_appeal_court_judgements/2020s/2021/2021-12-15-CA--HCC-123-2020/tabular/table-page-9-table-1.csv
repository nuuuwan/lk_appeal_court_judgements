"PW 2 tried to correct himself when he was confronted with the actual damages that were"
"visible  in  the  production  at  the  High  Court  premises  but  again,  he  stated  that  there  was"
"damage near the headlight area."
"Despite these contradictions in the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses, the learned trial"
"judge has not considered all that but stated there are no contradictions between testimonies"
"of the witnesses.  In the case of Sinnaiya Kalidasa vs. The Hon. Attorney General CA 128 / 2005"

"Dealing with how police evidence in bribery cases should be considered; ""In a great"
"many cases, the police are, as a rule, unreliable witnesses. It is always in their interests"
"to secure a conviction in the hope of getting a reward. Such evidence ought, therefore,"
"to be received with great caution and should be closely scrutinized."""
"Ranjith Silva J states; ""By the same token the same principles should apply and guide"
"the  Judges  in  the  assessment  of  the  evidence  of  excise  officers  in  narcotics  cases."
"Judges must not rely on a non - existent presumption of truthfulness and regularity as"

"The learned counsel for  the accused-appellant argued that  the learned trial  judge has  not"
"given due prominence to the defence evidence. It was stated that there is a contradiction"
"about  the  damages  caused  to  the  car  by  the  tipper  accident  and  the  defence  version"
"throughout  the  trial  was  that  such  a  tipper  accident  never  happened  and  it  was  a  mere"
"fabrication of the Prosecution witnesses."
"It is, even more, strengthened by the fact that such an accident was never reported to the"
"police by anyone or by the PW 1 himself. In the dock statement the appellant stated that he"
"was on the way to his mother's house to inform that his child fell ill and was admitted to Castle"
"hospital and on the way, he hit the side mirror of the Police Van and he panicked and fled as"
"he didn't have any license or insurance with him. He denied the fact that his car got hit by"
"such a tipper and the allegation that there was heroin in his possession. He admitted the fact"
"that the police found money but not from his car but his house when they went to search his"
"house."
