"car and took him outside. Then the officers questioned him and put him in the back seat of"
"his car. They drove his car to the left side of Borella junction towards Narahenpita and stopped"
"near the bus stop and searched the appellant and his car. They found heroin in a pink colour"
"bag in his pocket and also a sum of Rs. 372,000 was found inside the car. Then they took him"
"to his house and searched for more drugs but couldn't find anything. Then they went to a"
"pawning center to weigh the heroin. Thereafter they brought the accused-appellants to the"
"police station."
"When  Inspector  Wasantha  Kumara  (PW  1)  had  noticed  a  car  overtaking  the  van  at  an"
"excessive speed from the left side of the road the officers had been travelling in the van. The"
"speed that the car had been travelling and overtaking of the vehicle from the wrong side of"
"the road had caught the attention of Inspector Wasantha Kumara who had been in service for"
"more than 20 years by that time. The curiosity of the police officers who had been in the van"
"had aroused further when they had noticed the car proceeding hastily after knocking against"
"the rear portion of a tipper truck that was stationed on the left side of the road."
"The abnormal behaviour of driving the car had prompted the Police Officers to follow the car"
"and when the car had stopped at the Borella junction near the traffic lights, the police officers"
"had approached the driver and had taken steps to take control of the car to search it. Since"
"the apprehension had been done on the middle of the road near the colour lights, the officers"
"had taken steps to park the car that the accused-appellant had been travelling after turning"
"the car towards the direction of Narahenpita."
"Upon searching the accused-appellant Inspector Wasantha Kumara had managed to recover"
"a polythene bag from the right-hand side of the trouser pocket that the  accused-appellant"
"had been wearing at the time of his apprehension. When the officers were conducting further"
"investigations, it has come to light that the polythene bag that the Accused had possessed"
"contained heroin. Further, a sum of Rs. 372,000/- had been recovered from another bag that"
"had been hidden and kept on the rear seat of the car."
"Inspector Wasantha Kumara had observed that the car that the accused-appellant had been"
"driving had sustained damages as a result of being knocked against the tipper truck that was"
"stationed on the left side of the road. The accused-appellant has made an admission about"
"the said damages. The money that had been recovered from the parcel that was found on the"
"rear seat of the  car has  been marked  by the  prosecution as a  production in  the case. The"
"vehicle had been listed as a production."
"It was argued by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant that the prosecution story"
"cannot be true. In reply to that argument the learned counsel for the respondent submitted"
"that  there  is  nothing  improbable  in  the  prosecution  story.  The  finding  of  a  cash  bundle"
"containing Rs 372,000/- and listing  the same as  an item of evidence negate the ground of"
"appeal  raised  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.  As  per  the  evidence  of  PW  1 he  had  observed  a"
"vehicle proceeding towards Borella junction driven negligently. One cannot comment about"
"the speed of a vehicle. But according to the witness he has observed a car overtaking the van"
"that he was travelling in a rash and negligent manner at a considerable speed. The manner"
"the vehicle was driven has caught the attention of witness number 1."
