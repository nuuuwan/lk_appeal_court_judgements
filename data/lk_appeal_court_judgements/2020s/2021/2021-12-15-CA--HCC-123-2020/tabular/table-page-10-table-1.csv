"The accused-appellant has said that was the rent money he got from his tenets. The learned"
"trial judge stated that the defence has admitted the damages caused to the car at the trial as"
"an  admission.  Appellant's  position  in  the  dock  statement  was  that  he  hit  the  side  mirror"
"cannot be accepted.  The learned trial judge misdirected himself in stating that the defence"
"admitted  the  damages  which  were  in  the  car  when  it  was  produced  to  the  courts.  It  is"
"impossible for the learned counsel who appeared for the defence, to deny the visible damages"
"in a production at the trial."
"The learned trial Judge has pointed out one question asked by the defence about the damages"
"in the car which was produced to courts and stated it shows that the defence admitted the"
"damages. The said question was asked by the defence to contradict the Prosecution's version"
"and not for any other reason. Just by one question asked by the defence the learned trial"
"judge cannot conclude that the defence admitted the damages at the time of the accident to"
"be the same as of now."
"Throughout  the  trial,  the  defence  position  was  that  the  damages  were  caused  to  the  side"
"mirror of the Van and such a tipper accident never happened. PW 1 at one instance admitted"
"the fact that their side mirror was damaged by the appellant."
