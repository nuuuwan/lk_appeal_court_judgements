"No one can predict the outcome of a motor car accident. The damage that could sustain to a"
"vehicle depends on numerous factors. PW 1 in his evidence has specifically explained why he"
"didn't report the accident he witnesses to the area police station. It is the contention of the"
"witness that such incidents should be investigated by the local police of the area and in this"
"instance, it is the police officers of Borella Police Station who had to investigate the accident."
"PW 1 in his evidence specifically states that he made inquiries from the local police about the"
"accident he witnessed and upon making inquiries he got to know that no complaint had been"
"lodged by the driver of the tipper truck. The owner of the tipper truck has not come forward"
"to lodge an entry. PW 1 has not pursued the matter any further. The arrest of the accused-"
"appellant had been done only after police officers discovered that the accused-appellant is"
"possessing an illegal substance. Even though the appellant in their submission has been taken"
"up the position that he was arrested even before the alleged recovery of illegal substance"
"from his possession."
"The said contention is inaccurate. There is a difference between the ""apprehension"" and a"
"formal  ""arrest"".  Initially,  the  accused-appellant  was  apprehended  due  to  his  suspicious"
"behaviour and later on  upon recovering the  productions from his possession  he  had been"
"formally  arrested  for  possession  of  heroin.  The  contention  of  the  appellant  that  he  was"
"arrested even before any contraband item was recovered from his possession doesn't hold"
"water."
"According to the Prosecution witnesses, the appellant's car drove at a very high speed and hit"
"a tipper which was parked on the left side of the road and continued to drive at a high speed"
"towards  Borella  junction.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  argued  that  this"
"version  is  highly  improbable  as  there  were  only  a  fractured  windscreen  and  a  damaged"
"bonnet sustained to his car but no other damage.  The appellant had driven a Toyota Passo"
"car which is a small size car and it came at a very high speed and hit the tipper and continued"
"to drive towards Borella. The accused-appellants version was that the car would have been"
"sustained severe damages in such a case."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  submits  that  the  trial  Judge  has  come  to  a"
"wrong  conclusion  in  his  judgment.  The  appellant's  car  would  not  have  sustained  severe"
"damages as it was hit not by a tipper that was driving towards him and hit from behind but"
"on  a  tipper  that  was  parked  on  the  side  of  the  road.  He  further  says  that  this  is  a  wrong"
"conclusion because if a small car like a Passo came at a very high speed and hit a tipper, there"
"should be severe damages to the car more than a fractured windscreen and also, after the"
"car hit on the tipper it would have thrown away because of the impact and he won't be able"
"to drive anymore."
"The learned counsel for the accused-appellant says that the accident was never reported to"
"any police. The defence in many instances questioned the Prosecuting witnesses why they"
"didn't report the tipper accident to police. Accused-Appellant argues that the witnesses have"
"given unacceptable and unreasonable answers in all instances. PW 1 stated at one point that"
"he called the Borella police and informed them but the tipper driver has not reported it. The"
