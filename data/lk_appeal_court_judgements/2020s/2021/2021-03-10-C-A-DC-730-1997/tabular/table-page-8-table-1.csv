"This second limb had not been considered by the learned district judge even though"
"the 5th defendant had petitioned this fact at the inquiry."
"Furthermore,  the  learned  district  judge  had  been  in  a  hurry  to  dispense  justice,"
"forgetting the fact that “hurried justice may cause to injustice” as in this case."
"Partition judgment being a judgement in ream a judge should be cautious and must"
"carefully study the entire evidence and documents produced before him. It is the duty"
"of  the  judge  to  study  and  analyse  all  deeds  marked  and  be  satisfied  that  evidence"
"tallies with the documents even in an uncontested case. In fact, in Caroline Perera and"
"another Vs. Martine Perera and another [(2002) 2 SLR 1], it is clearly stated that the"
"court should satisfy the right of the parties, and any agreements by parties contrary to"
"documentary  evidence  by  some  parties  will  not  be  conclusive  proof  of  the  title.  In"
"Falee Vs Argeen[2004 1 SLR 48] this position is further discussed in this judgment."
"Even if all the parties agree on facts, it is the duty of the judge to evaluate evidence"
"and carefully study the title before pronouncing the judgement. Considering all these"
"above facts of the circumstances and the law, it is my view that the order dated 25th"
"June 1997 should be set aside and allow the 5th defendant-appellant to contest the"
"case."
"I set aside the judgement entered on 22nd August 1995 and allow the appal with cost."
"Considering the delay that this case had taken, we order the present district judge to"
"take this matter up and expedite giving priority to the case and to hold a fresh trial."
"In order to felicitate this, we set aside all orders regarding the interlocutory decree"
"and the survey."
"Further, we order the registrar of this court to take steps to send the judgement and"
"the original case record to Matara District Court."
