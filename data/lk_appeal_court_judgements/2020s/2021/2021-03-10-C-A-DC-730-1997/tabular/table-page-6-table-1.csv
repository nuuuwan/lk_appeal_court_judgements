"Further  in  the  statement  of  claim,  the  5th  and  11th  defendants  have  categorically"
"denied the schedule of shares and the pedigree of the plaintiff."
"In  the  original  plaint,  two  plaintiffs  had  given  the  5th  defendant  66/192  shares."
"However, 
in  evidence,  no  shares  were  given  to  the  5th  defendant  even 
in  the"
"judgement, this had not been conceded. Thereby the 5th defendant had got no shares"
"at all."
"Facts  of  the  case  being  thus 
itâ€™s  time  to  consider  the  appeal 
lodged  by  the  5th"
"defendant.  The  learned  judge  had  taken  the  trial  on  the  22nd  August  1995.  At  the"
"outset,  without  cancelling  the  points  of  the  contest  already  recorded.  The  learned"
"judge  had  raised  two  new  points  of  contests  to  add  one  admission.  As  there  were"
"privies points of contest accepted by court still exits, it is not clear what would happen"
"to the points of the contest already raised."
"On  the  same  day  of  recording  evidence,  the

"At  this  point,  the  5th  defendant  had  filed  papers  to  intervene  and  to  set  aside  the"
"judgement delivered on 22nd August 1995. This application was made on 19th April"
"1996. On 23rd April 1997, the inquiry was held. At the inquiry, the 5th defendant gave"
"evidence and stated that he missed the court date due o his wedding preparations."
"Further, he had stated he was given a share in the plaint but not considered at the"
"time of giving evidence by the husband of the plaintiff or in the judgement."
"The learned judge who delivered the order to purge the defendant had considered sec"
"48 of the partition law to the strictest interpretation. The learned judge had further"
"pointed  out  that  the  wedding 
is  not  an 
inevitable  occasion.  Therefore,  the  5th"
"defendant could have taken steps to change the date of the case, but the judge had"
"failed to discuss the very important stand taken by the 5th defendant regarding not"
"allocating shares to him, which the plaintiff had given in the plaint."
"It is true that there are lapses in the hands of the 5th defendant, but those lapses are"
"not such a grievance as the lapses in the entire case processing."
"In the petition to set aside the judgement dated 22nd August 1995, the 5th defendant"
"petitioner  had  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  court  that  apart  from  the  fact  of  his"
