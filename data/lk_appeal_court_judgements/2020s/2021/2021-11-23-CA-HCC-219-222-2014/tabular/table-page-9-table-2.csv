"Paul  L.  Kirk  the  Author of  Crime  Investigation, offers  a  vivid  interpretation  of  this  principle  in the"
"following manner;"
"â€œWherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve"
"as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints but his hair, the"
"fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches,"
"the blood or semen lie deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against"
"him.  This  is  evidence  that  does  not  forget.  It  is  not  confused  by  the  excitement  of  the"
"moment.  It  is  not  absent  because  human  witnesses  are.  It  is  factual  evidence.  Physical"
"evidence Cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself; it cannot be wholly absent."""
