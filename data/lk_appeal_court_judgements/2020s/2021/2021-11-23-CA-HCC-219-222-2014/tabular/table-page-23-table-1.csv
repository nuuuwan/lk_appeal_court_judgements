"The learned President's Counsel and Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the respondent"
"argued that notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence, the 02nd accused-appellant has chosen to"
"contest his conviction and sentence, utilizing precious judicial time. It was further submitted that this"
"is  an  appropriate  case  for  the  Appellant's  sentence  to  run  from  the  date  of  affirmation  of  the"
"conviction and the sentence by this Court. Because of Appellant committing heinous crimes, this is"
"not a fit case for any discretion to be used relating to the operation of the sentence."
"It  is  my  view  that  even  though  the  discretion  is  vested  in  the  Trial  Judge  to  award  a  legal  and"
"appropriate sentence there cannot be such a serious disparity in the sentencing of different accused"
"persons for the same offence."
"It was held in The Police Officer, Dondra, v. Baban 25 NLR 156 that, an accused, who pleads not guilty"
"and claims to be tried, is not to be punished when found guilty more severely on that account, than"
"a co-accused who has pleaded guilty."
"In the above-mentioned case, those who pleaded guilty to the offence in 1923 were fined Rs. 3/-. The"
"appellant who pleaded not guilty and went for trial had been found guilty and fined Rs. 6/- for the"
"same offence, because he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The learned Magistrate gave"
"reason for the conviction and the sentence has indicated as follows;"
""" Counsel for the defence, however, questions my right to impose varying sentences in the"
"case of the same offence. My only answer to that is that it is a practice universally followed,"
"and I think, very rightly followed for a judge to regard a frank and open plea of guilt, when"
"not made boastfully as a justification for treating the accused with somewhat less severity. A"
"man who aggravates his original offence by putting forward a vexatious and frivolous defence"
"cannot, I think, claim as a right from the Court the same sentence as has been imposed on"
"those who admitted their guilt."""
"There is a great deal of truth and force in what the Magistrate says, but the practice has often been"
"condemned, and, if I may say so, rightly condemned by this Court. It holds out a strong temptation"
"to innocent persons to plead guilty."
"In  the  case  of  Beliatta  vs  Don  Lewis  (1907)  1  Aserwathamâ€™s  Report  page  2,  Wendt  J  made  the"
"following observation;"
"""Again, it is not an offence to plead not guilty when one is guilty, and a person doing so cannot"
"be punished more heavily than one who fully admits the charge or vice versa."""
"Thus, a person who appealed against the conviction cannot be punished more heavily than one who"
"has not appealed or one who has withdrawn his appeal."
"In Sumanasena v. AG 1999 (3) SLR 137  Court held that the evidence of a single solitary witness if"
"cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court of Law. Evidence should not be counted but"
"weighed."
