"It is the view of the learned ASG who appeared for the respondent that in the instant case evidence"
"was forthcoming not only from the circumstantial evidence but also from direct evidence. A judge"
"does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished."
"A judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the other and"
"both are public duties which the judge has to perform."
"There is no reason for me to ignore the said argument raised by the learned ASG. Because of the"
"overwhelming evidence, the conviction entered and the sentences pronounced on the 02nd accused-"
"appellant should necessarily be affirmed."
"For the reasons aforesaid, having regard to the facts of the present case and relevant principles of"
"law upon which the above convictions had been based, there is no error committed by the learned"
"High Court Judge and therefore, the convictions and the sentences are affirmed."
"Thus, we affirm the convictions and the sentences pronounced on the 02nd accused-appellant."
"The 01st, 03rd and 04th accused-appellants, appeals were withdrawn on 13.03.2019 and thereafter,"
"the sentences were backdated to 18.07.2014 to run concurrently."
"Considering the circumstances of the case we decide that the imprisonment against the 02nd accused-"
"appellant should also be backdated to 18.07.2014 to run concurrently."
"Appeal dismissed."
