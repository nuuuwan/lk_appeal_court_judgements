"irrespective of the alleged lapses in extending the bid bonds of both parties. The other reason",""
"for me to take that view is due to the fact that both the Petitioners and the 10th Respondent",""
"complying with the instructions of the bid document  had submitted the ‘bid offer’ and the",""
"‘bid  guarantee’  which  were  duly  valid  during  the  required  period.  In  that  context,  I  agree",""
"with  the contents of the specific passage referred to by the Petitioners in the case of Sunway",""
"International  (Pvt)  Ltd1  which  classifies  the  requirements  in  a  tender  notice.  Accordingly,  I",""

"the 
strict 
literal  compliance  of 
the  bid  conditions","in  appropriate  cases,  when 
such"

"In view of the aforementioned reasons, I hold that there is no viable reason for the TEC to",""

"alleged non-extension of the bid guarantee during a particular period. Therefore, in my view",""
"the Respondent's decision to proceed with the tender process by accepting the extension of",""
"the bid offer and bid guarantees is lawful.",""
"I  now  proceed  to  analyze  the  applicability  of  the  three  main","judgments  cited  by  the"

"Sierra  Construction  Limited  case2.  In  that,  the  validity  period  of  the  disputed  bid  bond  is",""
"shorter than the required bid validity period as per the bid document. Whereas in the instant",""
"case  both  the  Petitioners  and  the  10th  Respondent  had  tendered  a  bid  bond  valid  for  150",""
"days,  which  is  the  requirement  in  the  relevant  bid  document.  Secondly,  in  the  case  of",""
"Pamkayu  (M)  Snd  Bhd3  which  has  been  referred  to  by  the  Petitioners,  the  issue  is  also",""
"identical  to  the  Sierra  Construction  Limited  case.  The  other  case  referred  to  is  SmithKline",""
"Beecham case4 in which the main issue was that the selected bidder had not been registered",""
"under the Public Contracts Act. Therefore, I am of the view that the dicta of the above cases",""
"will not defeat my above findings.",""
