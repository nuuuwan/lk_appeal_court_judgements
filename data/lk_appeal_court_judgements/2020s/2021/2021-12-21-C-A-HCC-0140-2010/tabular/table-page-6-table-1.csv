"It has been the evidence of PW-01 that when he came out of the urinal after the"
"sexual assault, the 1st appellant who was there assaulted him using his hands"
"and told him to take the bicycle and run. When the 4th appellant said that he"
"wanted  to  see  the  size  of  his  male  organ,  the  1st  appellant  has  assaulted  him"
"too.  Upon  questioning,  he  has  stated  that  the  3rd  and  the  4th  appellants"
"appeared  to  be  drunk  at  that  time,  but  has  not  stated  so  about  the  1st"
"appellant. The evidence of that day clearly appears that the witness had  been"
"repeatedly asked by the prosecuting State Counsel as to what the 1st appellant"
"did to him, but the witness has maintained the same stand with regard to the"
"1st appellant. As for the 2nd appellant, it has been his evidence that he saw him"
"outside after the incident and he was with the others and he too scolded him."
"In a nutshell, it has been the position of PW-01 that it was only the 3rd and the"
"4th appellants who were involved in the offence of sexual assault on him."
"However,  when  continuing  his  evidence  in  chief  on  the  next  day  of  the  trial,"
"namely,  on  17-11-2009,  in  complete  contrast  to  the  first  dayâ€™s  evidence  as  to"
"the 1st appellant, he has stated that after the sexual acts by the 3rd appellant,"
"the 1st appellant too performed the same acts as the 3rd  appellant  did  on him"
"and  only  thereafter,  he  was  asked  to  go.  He  has  stated  that  when  this  was"
"happening two persons who were brothers of his friend came and asked the 1st"
"appellant to release him."
"PW-02 was the father of PW-01, who was not an eyewitness to the incident, but"
"his  evidence  establishes  the  emotional  and  mental  trauma  his  son  had  to"
"undergo because of what happened to him."
"PW-04, M. Ameer Riyas appears to be one of the persons whom the PW01 says"
"that came to the scene of the incident. It was his evidence that when he came"
"to the school playground that day, he saw the 3rd appellant who was a student"
"at  the  same  school,  fighting  with  a  small  boy  near  the  entrance  of  the  play"
"ground  and  the  2nd  appellant  was  sleeping  drunk  near  the  gate.  He  has  seen"
