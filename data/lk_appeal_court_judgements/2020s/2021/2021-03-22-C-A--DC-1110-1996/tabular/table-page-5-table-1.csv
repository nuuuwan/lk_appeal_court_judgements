"subscribed to the said  second deed had  been  advised  by the Notary to come with the original of"
"the deed to cancel the same and to handover the money had to be considered in the said context"
"as  it is a very probable and  a plausible explanation."
"Therefore,  by 
the 
time 
the  Plaintiff  had 
instituted  action, 
the  Defendant  had  acquired  a"
"prescriptive titled to the land in  suit and the Plaintiff's right to sue  also  had  been  prescribed  and"
"the  Plaintiff could  not have  had  and  maintained  his  action.  The  said  aspect  had  totally evaded"
"the consideration  of the  Learned  Trial Judge  as  the  issues  raised  with the said  regard  had  been"
"answered in the negative by the Learned Trial Judge  without a proper assessment and  appraisal"
"of the facts and circumstances as  well as the law in the proper perspective.  Hence the judgment"
"of the Learned Trial Judge  is  erroneous and  bad  in  law and  has  no force  of avail  in  law.  It is very"
"clear that the  Learned  Trial  Judge  had  also  erred  both  in  law as  well  as  in  fact  in  answering the"
"issues in favor of the Plaintiff and  granting relief to the Plaintiff."
"The  Defendant  in  giving  evidence  had  very  clearly  stated  that  he  had  gone  to  the  Notary  to"
"redeem the property and executed another deed in  respect of the same shares of the same lands"
"in  the year 1976 before the expiration  of the 3-year period.  The  reason  for executing the next"
"deed was that he did not have the money required at that time and he was compelled to give the"
"land to one Soma  Alahakoon and  realize the money. 
It is very important to note that at the time"
"when  the  said  deed  was  executed,  the  Plaintiff's father  who  is  the  Substituted  Plaintiff in  this"
"appeal had  been  present and he had been a subscribing witness to the said deed. 
It was also the"
"uncontroverted  evidence  of the  Defendant that  he  did  not  have  any  other  rights  in  the  lands"
"apart from the  rights transferred to the  Plaintiff in  1973 and  although the  land  was  transferred"
"in the name of the Plaintiff in  1973, the father was the person  who advanced  the money to the"
"said  transaction."
"The  Learned  Trial Judge  had  also  placed  a heavy reliance  upon the fact that the defendant had"
"stated  that  he  had  paid  only  a sum  of Rs.  1,400/-
to the  Plaintiff's  father.  This  is  also  a clear"
"misdirection as  it will be  observed that the Defendant had  been very constant in'his evidence as"
"to the  amount tendered  to be  Rs.  1,650/-
right  throughout  his  evidence  and  the  only  instance"
"where  the  said  sum  is  mentioned  is  under  re- examination  where  the  said  sum  is  mentioned."
"That is  also with regard  to the capital  due on the deed and  the Learned Trial Judge  had  failed to"
"appreciate the fact that the extra  Rs.2S0/- was only the interests due on the capital."
"The  Plaintiff argued  that the  Learned  District Judge  observed  that D1  is  a photocopy and  it was"
"not even certified. Most importantly to prove this vital fact that Notary was not called but keeping"
"an open mind, states that, the Notary according to the Evidence was dead at the time of the trial.,"
"but holds on the matter as  adverted to earlier, that he  cannot accept D1."
"The  father  of the  Plaintiff has  given  Evidence,  and  he  specially  states  that,  on  07.05.1976  no"
"money was  given to him. One  of the issu es of the Defendant was that, the transaction was  with"
"the  Plaintiff's father.  The  Plaintiff argued  that the  Learned  District Judge  had  the advantage  of"
"listening, seeking the parties when they gave  Evidence and  he believed when he  stated that no"
"money was given to him. Further it was stated that because of the inconsistent position taken  up"
"by the  Defendant,  the trial Judge  does  not believe  him  or rely  on  his  Evidence.  Looking  at the"
"totality  of the  Evidence  the  Court  states,  that  Court  cannot  accept  the  Defendants  position."
