"Therefore it is important to ascertain as to whether the 1st Respondent has the authority to"
"withhold the EPF money that is legally entitled to the 3rd Respondent, by holding over the"
"said  cheque  drawn  in  favour  of  the  3rd  Respondent.  In  paragraph  (c)  of  the  prayer  of  the"
"Petition of the Petitioner, a writ of prohibition is also sought to prevent the 1st Respondent"
"from taking any steps that would compel the Petitioner to pay the 3rd Respondent the said"
"sum of Rs. 2,774,293.45 until the hearing and the determination of the  said District Court"
"case."
"The  payment  of  EPF  to  the  Petitioner  bank  is  governed  under  a  fund  called  ""National"
"Savings Bank Provident Fund"", which is regulated by certain rules adopted by the said bank."
"The  relevant  documents  are  marked  as  P13A  and  P13B.  The  said  special  fund  has  been"
"established under and in terms of the provisions of the Employee's Provident Fund Act, No."
"15 of 1958, as amended (""EPF Act"").  The 1st Respondent has made the order in P11 under"
"Section 27 (12) of the said EPF Act. The court by perusing the available documents observes"
"that the 1st Respondent has ordered the Petitioner to submit the aforesaid cheque in view of"
"handing over the same in return to the 3rd Respondent. The 1st Respondent has no duty, as"
"required under EPF Act, to deposit the EPF money of the employees of the Petitioner bank"
"in any special account."
"The  scheme  of 
the 
Industrial  Disputes  Act  and 
the  EPF  Act  does  not  provide 
for"
"withholding or forfeiture of EPF that an employee is entitled for. Furthermore, it is noted"
"that  no  provision 
in 
the  National  Savings  Bank  Provident  Fund  Rules  at 
(P13B), 
to"
"withhold or forfeit EPF, except for the provisions in its clause 29, provides for bank's rights"
"to reduce contribution. However, only in the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983, as"
"amended,  provides  a  mechanism 
for 
forfeiture  of  gratuity 
subject 
to 
the  conditions"
"mentioned therein. In terms of Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, a gratuity entitled"
"for  any  workman  can  be  forfeited  if  such  workman's  services  have  been  terminated  for"
"reasons of fraud, misappropriation of funds of the employer, willful damage to the property"
"of the employer or causing the loss of goods, articles or property of the employer. Therefore,"
"the  law  provides  no  excuse  to  withhold  or  forfeit  the  EPF  that  is  entitled  by  an  employee"
"with  his  consent  despite  even  the  fact  that  such  employee  has  caused  misappropriation  of"
"funds of the employer or willful damage, etc. to the property of the employer."
