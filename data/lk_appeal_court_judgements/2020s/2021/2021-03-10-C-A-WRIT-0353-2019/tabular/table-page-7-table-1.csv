"Respondent by drawing a cheque to the value of the exact amount which is due to the 3rd"
"Respondent.  Petitioner  has  admitted  the  liability  although  her  has  defaulted  subsequently"
"the payment of EPF to the 3rd Respondent by taking steps to stop the payment of the said"
"cheque."
"Therefore, in view of the above grounds this court is of the opinion that the 1st Respondent"
"has  no  duty  or  authority  whatsoever  to  withhold  the  payment  of  EPF  claim  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent.  This court is satisfied that the 1st Respondent has issued the letters at P17 and"
"P19 after an inquiry and we take the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish grounds"
"for ultra vires in regard to the issuance of those two letters."
"Furthermore,  the  3rd  Respondent  has  not  extended  his  consent  to  refer  any  dispute  for"
"settlement by arbitration and also there exists no industrial dispute for the Minister to refer"
"for settlement by arbitration."
"In the circumstances, this court takes the view that the final relief prayed for in the Petition"
"of  the  Petitioner  is  nugatory.  This  court  is  of  the  view  that  there  is  no  merit  in  this"
"application and we refuse notice accordingly."
