"“Thus  the  existence  of  exceptional  circumstances  is  the  process  by  which  the  Court"

"The practice of Court to insist on the exsistance of exceptional circumstances for the"
"exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has got hardened"
"into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed”"
"Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and Others. [2004] 1 Sri LR 284 at Page 287"
