"According to the said investigation notes, the Officer observed expired and perished groceries at"
"the shop. Since there were cobwebs, it appeared that the premises was closed for some time and"
"no one had occupied the same until 22.05.1994."
"As such, it is hard to believe that the Appellant had been carrying out a business at the said premises"
"during the period of 29.09.1993 to 22.05.1994."
"On the other hand, according to the said observation notes, the Investigating Officer had observed"
"that there were only 25 cases of Fanta, Coca-Cola, Sprite and Pepsi bottles. If one case contains"
"24 bottles, then 25 cases would be 600 bottles. Thus therein no indication of 8400 bottles."
"When the premises was inspected on 22.05.1994 on this day there were only approximately 600"
"bottles, nevertheless, on 31.05.1994 there were 8400 bottles more. Thus it is apparent that those"
"8400 bottles were stored after the inspection on 22.05.1994."
"The court draws the attention to the complaint made on 22.05.1994 by the Respondent which states"
"that,"
"“අද දින උගද් 8ට පමණ මා ගපාලීසියට ඒමට පැමිණියා. එවිට මම දැක්කා එම ගවළඳ සැලට දමා තිබූ ඉබ්බා"
"කඩා ඔවුන්ගේ ඉබ්බන් ගදාරට දමා ගවළඳ සැල වසා තිගබනවා. මට අයත් රු. ලක්ෂ ගදකක් පමණ වටිනා"
"පාරිගභෝගික විකුනුේ බඩු ගවළඳ සැල තුල තිගබනවා”."
