"In view of the said contents of the complaint of the Respondent, since the Appellant broke opened"
"the padlocks and changed the same, it clearly shows that even after the inspection on 22.05.1994"
"the keys of the padlocks were with the Appellant thus the Appellant had the opportunity of storing"
"8400  bottles  during  the  period  of  22.05.1994  to  31.05.1994.  Hence,  the  Appellant  had  not"
"established  that  he  was  in  possession  of  the  shop  premises  from  29.09.1993  to  21.05.1994."
"Therefore, the Court can come to a reasonable conclusion that until 21.05.1994, the possession of"
"the shop premises was with the Respondent and his possession was interrupted by the Appellant"
"on 21.05.1994."
