"Order. Apparently, the Learned High Court Judge by Order dated 6th November 2000 dismissed"
"the Application of the Petitioner, affirming the Order of the Learned Primary Court Judge."
"Consequently, the party of the 2nd part Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as"
"the Appellant] made an Application bearing No. CA (PHC) APN 77/2000 to the Court of Appeal"
"challenging the said Orders of the High Court as well as the Primary Court. It appears that the"
"Court of Appeal set  aside the impugned Order of the  Learned High Court, since it is a nullity,"
"because no reasons were assigned to the conclusion reached by the High Court Judge and  thus"
"directed the Registrar to send the Case forthwith to the relevant High Court to make an Order on"
"the merits of the Case."
"Consequently, the learned High Court Judge made an Order dated 15th October 2015, once more"
"dismissing the Application of the Appellant. Subsequently, the Appellant has preferred this Appeal"
"against the said Order of the High Court."
"The Appellant alleged that the said Order, once  more failed to give proper consideration to the"
"merits of the Case and to adduce proper reasons thereto, and is therefore, contrary to the express"
"direction given by the Court of Appeal by its Order dated 19th November 2008."
"It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge, in the course of his"
"Order  stated  that  upon  the  documentary  proof  available,  the  premises  in  dispute  was  in  the"
"Respondentâ€™s control (Constructive Possession) during the period in question."
