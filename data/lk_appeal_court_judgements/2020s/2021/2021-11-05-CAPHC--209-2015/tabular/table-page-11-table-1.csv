"entered into a contract with the Electricity Board. Subsequently, the Electricity supply was given"
"on 21.03.1994."
"It is to be noted that the Appellant has paid Rs. 10, 000/- on 27.05.1994 by 2ව2 and the Respondent"
"entered into a contract with the Electricity Board on 11.03.1994. Since the information was filed"
"on 23.05.1994 the Appellant has paid Rs. 10, 000/- in view of the Electricity bills after the filing"
"of the information."
"It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  since  the  information  was  filed  on  23.05.1994,  the  Respondent  had"
"entered into  a contract  with  the Electricity Board and  paid  Rs. 2000/-  as part of the arrears on"
"11.03.1994 and had got the Electricity Supply on 21.03.1994, thus it appears that the Respondent"
"got the Electricity Supply prior to the filing of the information. Nevertheless, the Appellant has"
"paid  Rs.  10,  000/-  as  part  payment  of  the  Electricity  bills  on  27.05.1994  just  after  filing  of"
"information."
"In view of the said position, a serious doubt is created in accepting the contents of the Affidavit of"
"the Appellant and the letter (2ව2) by the Grama Niladhari."
"As such, the pertinent question that has to be determined under Section 66 of the Primary Court"
"Procedure  Act,  is  whether  the  Respondent  was  dispossessed  by  the  Appellant  or  whether  the"
"possession was handed over to the Appellant amicably by the Respondent. Apparently, in terms"
"of Section 68(3) of the said Act, Court has to determine who was in possession of the premises in"
"dispute two months prior to the date of filing the information."
