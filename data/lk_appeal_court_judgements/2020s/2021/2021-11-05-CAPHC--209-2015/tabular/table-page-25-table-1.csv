"duty  to  consider  and  grant  relief  to  the  1st  Respondent  by  restoration  of  his  Possession  to  the"
"disputed premises under see 68(3) of the Act."
"In  view  of  the  foregoing  reasons,  it  clearly  manifests  that  although  the  1st  Respondent  was"
"dispossessed by the Appellant on 21.05.1994, the Appellant had not substantiated his possession"
"to the premises in dispute during the period of 29.09.1993 to 21.05.1994. Thus, the Appellant had"
"failed to prove that he was in possession of the premises in question two months prior to the date"
"of filing of the information under Section 66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act on 23.05.1994."
"Hence, the Order made by the learned Primary Court Judge on 27.12.1996, which determined that"
"the 1st Respondent was entitled to the Possession of the premises is well-founded. Thus, we see no"
"reason for us to interfere with the said Order of the learned Primary Court Judge, as well as the"
"Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 15.10.2015."
"As such, we affirm the said Orders of the  learned Primary Court Judge and the learned"
"High Court Judge and Dismiss the Appeal with cost fixed at Rs. 50,000/-."
