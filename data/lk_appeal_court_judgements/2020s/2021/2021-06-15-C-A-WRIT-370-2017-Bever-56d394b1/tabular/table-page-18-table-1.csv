The  Conference 
shall  make  provision 
for 
the  determination  by  an"
"administrative tribunal of disputes relating to the conditions and terms of"
"appointment of members of the staff.”"
"I
t  must  be  noted  here  that  the  legal  obligation  on  member  states  to  accord  to  the"
"FAO,  all  immunities  and  facilities  which  it  accords  to  diplomatic  missions,  is  only"
"insofar  as  it  is  consistent  with  its  Constitutional  provisions.  This  further  buttresses"
"the fact that immunity to the FAO cannot, under any circumstance, be implied in the"
"absence of the constitutionally mandated mechanism provided for in the Act."
"T
he Agreement between the FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka"
"E
ven  where 
States 
have 
signed 
the 
international 
instruments 
establishing"
"international organisations, “while those agreements are of a multilateral character,"
"it  has  often  been  found  necessary  to  conclude  a  bilateral  agreement  with  the  host"
"state  in  whose  territory  the  headquarters  or  other  offices  of  the  organisations  are"
"maintained.”21"
"T
he Ministry of Foreign Affairs has referred to an Agreement between the FAO and"
"the Government of Sri Lanka in ‘2R1’ and therefore ‘P7’ refers to such an Agreement"
"dated 1st December 1978. However, it must be noted  that the said Agreement was"
"not produced before this Court. The learned Senior State Counsel has annexed with"
"her written submissions dated 11th January 2019, a letter dated 13th December 2018"
"issued  by  the  Ministry of Foreign  Affairs in  response  to certain  clarifications sought"
"by  the 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel  on  the 
inconsistent  positions  taken  by  the"
"Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs 
in  respect  of  the 
jurisdictional 
immunity  purportedly"
"granted to the FAO. This letter appears to contain the final position of the Ministry of"
"Foreign  Affairs  with  regard  to  the 
issue  on 
immunity.  Although  the  Ministry  of"
"Foreign  Affairs  had  stated  that  the  said  Agreement  dated  1st  December  1978  has"
"been marked ‘Annex I’ the document marked ‘Annex I’ was an incomplete document"
"dated  18th  September  1978, 
issued  by  the  Director-General  of  the  FAO  to  the"
"Minister of Agriculture and Lands, providing certain proposals on the “Appointment"
"of  an  FAO  Representative  in  Sri  Lanka”  which  was  due  to  constitute  an  Agreement"
"upon 
its  acceptance  by  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka.  The 
letter  of  acceptance"
