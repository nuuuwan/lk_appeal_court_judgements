"domestic  legal  order.  The  most  striking  formulation  of  this  principle  can  be"

"as  a  matter  of  English  law  owes  its  existence  to  the  Order  in  Council.  That  is"
"what created the ITC in domestic law..”7 In the United Kingdom, the adoption of"
"an  Order  in  Council  conferring  upon  international  organisations  to  which  that"
"state  becomes  a  member  the  “legal  capacities  of  a  body  corporate,”8  or  the"
"enactment of a specific piece of legislation in respect to a given organisation are"
"the two ways in which the juridical personality of international organisations is"
"given effect in that country’s legal order.”9"
