"The  second  Respondent,  Attorney  General  by  way  of  his  motion  dated  27.09.2021  has"
"drawn the attention of this court to two documents marked as ‘X1’ and ‘X2’. By letter dated"
"14.07.2021 (X1) the second Respondent has advised the third Respondent to conduct further"
"investigations  against 
the  Petitioner  on  matters  mentioned 
in 
that 
letter.  The 
third"
"Respondent by his letter dated 26.07.2021 (X2) has intimated to the second Respondent that"
"a  question  had  arisen  as  to  whether  further  investigation  could  be  continued  as  a  result  of"
"the stay order issued by this Court on 08.06.2020. However, the second Respondent has not"
"responded  to  the  said 
letter  X2.  When  this  matter  was  mentioned  on  13.10.2021  for"
"clarifications, 
the 
learned  Deputy  solicitor  General 
tendered  a  copy  of  a  very  recent"
"communication addressed to the second Respondent by the third Respondent. According, to"
"the said letter dated 27.09.2021 which is filed of record now, the third Respondent reiterates"
"the  fact  that  there  are  no  grounds  to  frame  charges  or  to  report  to  the  Magistrate’s  Court"
"against 
the  Petitioner.  Furthermore, 
the 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the 
third"
"Respondent  submitted 
to  Court  on  13.10.2021 
that 
the  statement  made  by 
the 
third"
"Respondent  in  X2  on  the  stay  order  of  this  court  is  only  in  respect  to  the  investigations"
"against 
the  1st 
suspect  of 
the  Magistrate’s  Court  case  and  not  with 
regard 
to  any"
"investigations against the 2nd suspect."
"The  second  Respondent  in  his  motion  dated  27.09.2021  has  expressly  not  objected  to  the"
"application  made  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  to  discharge  the  Petitioner  from  the"
"Magistrate’s  Court  proceedings  and 
instead  has  requested 
this  Court 
to  consider 
the"
"contents of the said motion in taking a decision on the application made by the Petitioner."
"Even on 13.10.2021 the  second Respondent tendered only the said letter dated 27.09.2021"
"of the third Respondent and has not raised any objections."
"The  below  mentioned  passage 
in 
the  article 
titled  “The grounds for Certiorari and"
"Prohibition” by D.C.M. Yardley oxford in ‘Canadian Bar Review XXXVII’ is in my view"
"apt  here.“Where  a 
jurisdiction  depends  upon  a  contingency  which  has  been 
fulfilled,  then  the"
"jurisdiction  is  as  good  as  if  it  had  existed  ab  initio,  but  there  are  occasions  when  the  contingent"
"jurisdiction rests upon acquiescence. Thus, where a summons to a defendant to appear before a county"
"court was issued on 3rd January, 1850, but was based on an order made by the county court judge on"
"30th October, 1847, which had given the plaintiff leave to issue a summons, there was some doubt as to"
