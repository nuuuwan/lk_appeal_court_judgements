"Learned High Court Judge discusses this matter at length. (CA (PHC) APN"
"147/2017)  But the Learned High Court Judge has considered the matters urged"
"before him and has concluded that according to the judgment cited by him the"
"matters urged before him are not exceptional."
"This court especially takes in to consideration the following paragraph of the"
"judgment cited by the Learned High Court Judge (CA (PHC) APN147/2017) which"
"says as,"
"“According to the decisions cited above, our law does not consider the period of"
"remand as an exceptional circumstance. It is well settled law that the principles"
"governing bail under the poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act are manifestly"
"different from general principles of bail under the Bail Act. As it was pointed out in"
"the case of Labukola Anga Wisin Gedara Ashani Dhanushshika(supra) and in"
"the case of W.R.Wickramasinghe (supra), the intention of the Legislature can be"
"construed as to keep suspects and accused under the poisons, Opium and"
"Dangerous Drugs Act in remand until the conclusion of the case”"
"Hence upon perusal of the said order it is the considered view of this court that in"
"the impugned order this court finds no illegality or an exceptional circumstance"
"which shocks the conscious of this court. This Court also takes into consideration"
"the fact that since the indictment has already been filed the trial can be expedited"
"if the parties urge before the High Court to do so."
"Therefore the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed."
