"spent once and for all and income expenditure is a thing which is going to"
"recur every year and no doubt this is often a material consideration”"
"As Lord Cave had observed in the Atherton case the criteria suggested in"
"the  Vallambrosa  case  is  not  and  was  obviously  not 
intended  by  Lord"
"Dunedin to be, a decisive one in every case, for it is easy to imagine many"
"cases  in  which  a  payment,  though  made  “once  and  for  all”  would  be"
"properly chargeable against the receipt for the year. For an example, if a"
"gratuity is paid to an employee on his retirement, which was the subject of"
"the decision in Smith v Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (1914) 3 KB"
"674, it is attributable to the revenue expenditure although it is a once and"
"for all payment."
"For  obvious  reasons  Lord  Cave  in  the  Atherton’s  case  had  widened  the"
"scope of the interpretation of “capital expenditure.” The words “not only"
"once  and  for  all”  in  Lord  Cave’s  description  quoted  above  show  that  in"
"addition to the requirement of a once and for all payment Lord Cave had"
"introduced two more requirements namely,"
"2) The Expenditure is made with a view to bringing into existence an asset"
"or advantage."
"3) For the enduring benefit of the trade."
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant argued that the aforesaid all three"
"requirements are lacking in this case."
"Before  applying

"Atherton’s case to the facts of the case before us, it is important to bear in"
"mind  the  following  observations  of  Viscount  Radcliffe 
in  the  case  of"
"Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper mines Ltd (1964)"
"1 All.E.R 208,"
"“Nevertheless,  it  has  to  be  remembered  that  all  these  phrases,  as,  for"
"instance ‘enduring benefit’ or ‘capital structure’ are essentially descriptive"
"rather than definitive, and, as each new case arises for adjudication and it"
"is  sought  to  reason  by  analogy  from  its  facts  to  those  of  one  previously"
"decided, a Court’s primary duty is to inquire how far a description that was"
