"certain  rates  and  taxes.  They  failed  to  do  so.  The  Appellant  Company,"
"though in no way legally or morally bound to do so, paid for these repairs"
"and paid those rates and taxes. They did so, not as a matter of charity, but"
"of commercial expediency in order to avoid the loss of their tenants and"
"consequently the loss of the market for their beer, which they had acquired"
"those  houses  for  the  purpose  of  affording.  It  was  held  that,  though  the"
"Appellant  Company  were  not  legally  or  morally  bound  to  make  those"
"payments, yet they were in estimating the balance of the profits and gains"
"of their business for the purpose of assessment of Income Tax entitled to"
"deduct all the sums so paid by them as expenses necessarily incurred for"
"the purpose of their business."
"The Tax Appeals Commission has come to the conclusion that the payment"
"made  by  the  Appellant  is  not  an  outgoing  or  expense  incurred 
in  the"
"production of its income. In the case of Smith Potato Estates v Boland (30"
"TC 267) Lord Simmonds in taking into consideration the relevant rules has"
"stated as follows. “In computing the amounts of the profits or gains to be"
"charged,  no  sum  shall  be  deducted  in  respect  of  any  disbursements  or"
"expenses, not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for"
"the  purpose  of  the  trade,  profession,  employment  or  vocation”.  Those"
"words  contained  in  the  English  rules  are  even  stronger  than  the  words"
"contained in Section 26(1)(g) of the Inland Revenue Act  No. 10 of  2006."
"According to those words, the expense should be wholly and exclusively"
"incurred  for  the  purpose  of  producing  the  profit  and 
income  of  the"
"business or trade. According to the words contained in Section 26(1)(g) of"
"the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, any disbursements or expenses not"
"being  money  expended  for  the  purpose  of  producing  such  profits  or"
"income shall not be allowed for deduction. The words contained in Section"
"26(1)(g) are wider in scope than the words in the English rule. But in both"
"provisions, there has to be a nexus between the expense or disbursement"
"and the production of profits or income."
"There are similarities and dissimilarities between the facts in this case and"
"the  facts 
in  Usher’s  case.  In  both  these  cases  the  tax  payer 
incurred"
"expenses  of  its  customers.  The  tax  payer  paid/reimbursed  the  statutory"
"dues  of  its  customers.  The  tax  payer  was  not  legally  bound  to  bear  the"
