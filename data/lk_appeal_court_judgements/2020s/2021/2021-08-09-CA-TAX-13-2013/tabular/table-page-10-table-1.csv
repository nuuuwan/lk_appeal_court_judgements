"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submits  that  in  “substance”  the"
"effect  was  same  on  the  retailers.  In  substance  the  reimbursement 
in"
"January 2007 is the same in effect as the price adjustment for all months"
"from February 2007. Therefore, it is the submission of the learned Counsel"
"for the Appellant that in substance it is not a once and for all payment and"
"in reality, the sum  is incurred by the Appellant on a recurring basis. To"
"come  to  the  conclusion  that  in  substance  it  is  not  a  once  and  for  all"
"payment there have to be subsequent payments. In this case there are no"
"subsequent payments made after January 2007. Price reduction is not a"
"payment  made  to  the  retailers.  It  is  not  an  expenditure  incurred  by  the"
"Appellant. Reduction of prices will no doubt cause a loss to the Appellant"
"but  that 
loss  cannot  be  accounted 
for  an  expense 
incurred  by  the"
"Appellant.  Hence  there  is  no  recurring  expenditure  after  January  2007."
"Therefore,  one  cannot  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  reimbursement"
"made for the month of January 2007 was not a once and for all payment."
"I will now consider the second ingredient of “capital expenditure”….with a"
"view  to  bringing 
into  existence  an  asset  or  advantage.  To  be  capital"
"expenditure it must be made with a view to bringing into existence an asset"
"or  advantage.  Here  there 
is  no  asset  brought 
into  existence  by  this"
"reimbursement,  but  there  is  an  advantage  to  the  Appellant.  That  is  the"
"enhancement of good will. The Appellant Company had already created a"
"good will from their customers and by this reimbursement that good will"
"was enhanced. It only enhanced the good will which was already existing"
"and this reimbursement did not bring into existence good will. Therefore,"
"by  this  act  of  reimbursement  the  Appellant  Company  did  not  bring  into"
"existence  “good  will”  and  therefore, 
it  cannot  be  treated  as  capital"
"expenditure."
"The third ingredient is the “enduring benefit”. To be capital expenditure it"
"must be made with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage"
"for the enduring benefit of the trade. In this case no asset or advantage"
"had been brought into existence by this reimbursement and therefore, the"
"question of enduring benefit of the trade will not arise for consideration."
"Here there is no asset or advantage which had been brought into existence"
"to consider whether it is for the enduring benefit of the trade. In any event,"
