"learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the facts of this application fall entirely within"
"the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cassim."
"I
n  Council  of  Civil  Service  Unions  vs  Minister  for  the  Civil  Service,26  Lord  Diplock"
"identified 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety' as being the grounds"
"upon  which  administrative  action  is  subject  to  control  by  judicial  review.  He  then"
"went onto describe illegality in the following manner."
"“
By  'illegality'  as  a  ground  for  judicial  review  I  mean  that  the  decision  maker"
"must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and"
"must  give  effect  to  it.  Whether  he  has  or  not  is  par  excellence  a  justiciable"
"question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by"
"whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable.”"
"T
he  complaint  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  Board  of  Review  acted  illegally  when  it"
"arrived  at  its  determination  that  the  right  of  the  tenant  ceased  with  his  death  and"
"that  there  cannot  be  any  substitution 
in  place  of  the  deceased  tenant. 
I  have"
"examined  the  Order  of  the  Board  of  Review,  ‘X15’,  and  observe  that  the  Board  of"
"Review has blindly followed the judgment in Leelawathie v Ratnayake. There has not"
"been a consideration of:"
"a
) 
the facts of this application vis-à-vis the facts in Leelawathie;"
"b
) 
the reasons that led the Supreme Court to arrive at its decision in Leelawathie;"
"c
) 
the legal principles laid down in Leelawathie."
"T
he Board of Review has not even considered the judgment of the Supreme Court in"
"Cassim  v  Weerawardena,  which,  for  the  reasons  that 
I  have  already  discussed,"
"reflect the correct legal position that is applicable to this application."
"I
n  the  aforementioned  circumstances,  I  hold  that  where  a  vesting  order  has  been"
"made in terms of Section 17(1), a tenant who has made an application under Section"
"13 to purchase a house could be substituted in the event of his or her death."
