"“Strictly speaking an “Obiter dictum” is a remark made or opinion expressed by a Judge,"
"in his decision upon a cause, ‘by the way’ – that is, incidentally or collaterally, and not directly"
"upon the question before the Court; or it is any statement of Law enunciated by the Judge or"
"Court merely by way of illustration, argument, analogy or suggestion… In the common speech"
"of Lawyers, all such extrajudicial expressions of legal opinion are referred to as ‘dicta’ or"
"‘Obiter dicta’ these two terms being used interchangeably”."
