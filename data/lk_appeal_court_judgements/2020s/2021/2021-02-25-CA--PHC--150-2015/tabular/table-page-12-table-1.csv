"As such, His Lordship that dicta in Somaratne’s case (supra) amounts to Judicial dicta –"
"and further held that the Judicial dicta in Somaratne’s case (supra) and held that to be intra vires"

"on the Minister, particularly since under Section 58 (3) provides the period within which an"
"appeal may be filed can be prescribed by the rules.”"
"In terms of the said Rule 49 (xii) (a) and (b), a person appealing against an award of an"
"Arbitrator is mandated to deposit an amount of Rs. 50 or 10% of the Arbitrator’s award,"
"whichever is higher. In Fernando’s Case, it was emphasized by Kulatunge J. agreeing with"
"Fernando J. that, this rule may discourage and even prevent appeals made bona fide and upon"
"good grounds solely because an Appellant does not have the means of making the required"

"basis that the Appellant has failed to deposit 10% of the value of the award of the Arbitrator"
"under Rule 49 (xii) (b) of the Co-operative rules, made under Section 72 (2) of the Co-operative"
"Statutes of the Central Provincial Council No. 10 of 1990, as amended by statute No. 04 of 1993,"
"which is not ultra vires."
