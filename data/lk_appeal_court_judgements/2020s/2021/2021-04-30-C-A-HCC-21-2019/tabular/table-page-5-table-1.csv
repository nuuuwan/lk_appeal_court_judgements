"06-2002,  the  productions  have  been  handed  over  by  PW-10  to  Excise  Guard"
"774 Ashoka at 7.05 am. to be taken to Wattala Magistrate Court."
"With the above relevant facts in mind, I now proceed to consider the grounds of"
"appeal urged by the learned counsel for the appellant."
"(a) Break  in  the  chain  of  productions  being  sent  to  the  Government"
"Analyst:"
"In  the  written  submissions  the  learned  counsel  has  urged  two  grounds  to"
"formulate his argument that the production chain was not proved, namely;"
"(1) The  officer  who  handed  over  the  productions  to  the  Analyst  is  dead"
"and as such his evidence was not available."
"(2) The  productions  were  in  PW-02â€™s  personal  custody  and  he  had  the"
"free access to the productions."
"The  Excise  Guard  774  Ashoka  (PW-07  named  in  the  indictment)  was  dead  at"
"the time the  case was taken up for  trial. However, during the trial,  on 07-11-"
"2017  (at  page  283  of  the  brief)  and  again  on  07-09-2018  (at  page  308  of  the"
"brief)  the  defence  has  specifically  admitted  the  following  facts  under  section"
"420 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
"(i) 
 The  handing  over  of  the  productions  by  PW-10  to  Excise  Guard  774"
"Ashoka to be handed over to the Magistrate Court of Wattala and that it"
"was properly handed over."
"(ii)  The fact that from there, the productions were taken to the Government"
"Analyst  department,  and  after  the  analysis,  the  same  productions  were"
"brought back to the Wattala Magistrate Court,"
"It is very much apparent that because of the above admissions, there had been"
"no  necessity  for  the  prosecution  to  act  under  section  32(2)  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance  in  producing  the  relevant  notes  kept 
in  his  ordinary  course  of"
"professional duty by Excise Guard 774 Ashoka."
