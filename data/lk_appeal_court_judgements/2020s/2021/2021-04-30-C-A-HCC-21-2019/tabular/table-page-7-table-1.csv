"could  succeed  if  they  could  establish  unbroken  custody  from  the  time  of"
"detection up to the time of analysis by the Government Analyst.”"
"When it comes to the argument that PW-02 had free access to the productions"
"as  it  was  his  personal  custody,  I  find  that  the  productions  have  been  in  the"
"personal custody of PW-02 from the moment the detection was made on 22-05-"
"2002 and up until the morning of 23-05-2002 where he handed over the same"
"to his OIC PW-10."
"What is important here is whether the PW-02 had any opportunity to tamper"
"with  the  productions  during  the  said  period.  It  was  his  evidence  that  after"
"taking into his custody the brown colour substance from the possession of the"
"appellant,  he  temporarily  sealed  the  productions  by  putting  the  same  in  an"
"envelope.  PW-02  has  done  so  by  placing  the  left  thumb  impression  of  the"
"appellant  and  his  personal  seal  on  the  sealed  envelope  and  also  by  writing"
"down  the  appellant's  name  and  word  Oliyamulla.  (the  production  marked  P-"
"12A at the trial)."
"The contention of the defence is that PW-02’s admitted failure to mention in his"
"pocket  notebook  that  he  is  carrying  sealing  equipment  with  him  and  his  not"
"placing the signature of the appellant on the envelope used to temporarily seal"
"the substance (P-12A) amounts to a  failure  to  prove beyond reasonable doubt"
"the unbroken production chain."
"Although  PW-02  has  not  noted  in  his  pocket  notebook  that  he  is  carrying"
"sealing  equipment  with  him,  it  is  clear  from  the  envelope  used  by  PW-02  to"
"temporarily seal the productions until it was taken to the Excise Station for the"
"purpose of weighing, that in fact, he had the sealing equipment with him. The"
"trial  Court  has  observed  the  left  thumb  impressions  of  the  appellant  and  the"
"personal  seal  of  PW-02  on  the  envelope  marked  P-12A,  which  was  clearly  a"
"temporary  measure  taken  by  PW-02  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  productions"
