"The  third  argument  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  was  that  the  charge"
"sheet  issued  to  the  Petitioner  had  not  been  approved  by  the  Council.  The  learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in University"
"of  Ruhuna  and  Others  vs  Dr.  Dharshana  Wickremasinghe4  where  it  was  held  that"
"the charge sheet issued to a teacher must be approved by the Council. This argument"
"too  has  not  been  taken  up  at  the  hearing  before  the  USAB,  thus  making  the"
"opportunity  of  preferring  an  appeal  to  the  USAB  an  exercise  in  vain.  The  learned"
"State Counsel submitted that the Petitioner is not a teacher or officer. He submitted"
"that disciplinary control in respect of any person who is not a teacher or officer can"
"be delegated by the Council to the Vice Chancellor and that the charge sheet ‘P5’ has"
"been  signed  by  the  Vice  Chancellor.  Periodic  reports  of  the  Inquiry  relating  to  the"
"Petitioner  have  been  placed  before  the  Council.5  Thus,  it  is  clear  that  the  above"
"judgment has no application to the facts of this application, and that there has been"
"compliance with the provisions of the Universities Act. In the above circumstances, I"
"do not see any merit in the third argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner."
"T
he  final  argument  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  was  that  the  Inquiry"
"Officer was a member of the Council that took the decision to terminate the services"
"of the Petitioner. This too has not been raised at the hearing before the USAB. It is"
"indeed ironical that the Petitioner is complaining of a conflict of interest on the part"
"of the Inquiry Officer. Be that as it may, the learned State Counsel, while admitting"
"that the Inquiry Officer was a member of the Council having been nominated by the"
"Senate, submitted that the Inquiry Officer did not participate in the decision making"
