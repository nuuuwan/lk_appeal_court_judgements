"No  contradiction  or  omission  has  been  marked  in  the  evidence  of  the"
"prosecutrix.   Now, it is too late to point out contradictions or omissions"
"which  were  not  marked  or  not  drawn  the  attention  of  the  Trial  Court."
"Therefore,  the  credibility  of  the  prosecutrix  now  cannot  be  assailed  by"
"comparing her statement to the police."
