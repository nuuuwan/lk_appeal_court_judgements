"I
n  this  case,  no  contradiction  or  omission  had  been  marked 
in  the"
"evidence of the prosecutrix.  There was no animosity between the family"
"of  the  prosecutrix  and  the  appellant. 
  And  there  was  no  motive  to"
"implicate  the  appellant  or  to  concoct  a  story  against  him.    Even  in  the"
"evidence  of  the  appellant,  nothing  has  come  out  as  a  reason  for  false"
"implication.  Learned High Court Judge has also considered the evidence"
"of  the  appellant.      He  has  observed  that  the  alleged  assault  on  the"
"appellant  was  not  informed  to  the  Doctor  or  to  the  Magistrate.    The"
"appellant stated in his evidence that he had informed his lawyer that the"
"police had assaulted him. The learned High Court Judge observed that if"
"this evidence is correct, his lawyer would have brought it to the attention"
"of  the  Magistrate.    The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  and"
"evaluated  the  evidence  of  the  appellant.    Therefore,  the  ground  that  the"
"evidence of the appellant was wrongly rejected has no merit."
