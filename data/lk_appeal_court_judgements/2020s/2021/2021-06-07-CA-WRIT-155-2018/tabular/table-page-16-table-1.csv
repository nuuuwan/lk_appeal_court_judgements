"SLAF has conducted what the SLAF itself calls a comprehensive study – vide Exhibit ‘A’ to"
"the  analysis  carried  out  in  June  2017  relating  to  the  future  sustainability  of  the  Fund,"
"marked ‘R2’."
"T
he scheme contemplated that all Officers serving in the SLAF will join the scheme and"
"contribute  towards  the  Fund. However,  it  is not  all  those who joined  the  scheme  that"
"would receive the ultimate benefit of Rs. 1m for the reason that some officers may leave"
"the service prior to the completion of the mandatory period that they need to serve in"
"order  to  receive  the  benefit.  Such  officers  would  only  receive  their  contribution  with"
"interest  at  5%  per  annum.  While  the  membership  fee  that  was  to  be  charged  was  to"
"bring  in  Rs.  704m  per  annum,  the  number  of  retirees  in  the  first  three  years  was  an"
"average of  675,  with  over  90% of  the  retirees being non  commissioned  Officers. Thus,"
"the moneys that were to be generated through the membership fee were sufficient to"
"pay those retiring in the first three years, at the marked down rate."
"T
he Report ‘R2’ has identified that the study in 2014 proposed  a monthly contribution"
"from  Volunteers  which  was  Rs.  500 
less  than  Officers  of  the  Regular  Force  whilst"
"offering the same retirement benefits to the Officers of the Volunteer Force under the"
"Scheme. The reason for doing so is that the study had assumed that the Volunteer Force"
"Fund (the VAF) would merge with the Fund from the beginning of the scheme, bringing"
"in  the  capital  of  the  VAF  to  the  Fund.  The  merger,  which  should  have  brought 
in"
"approximately Rs. 382m, however had not taken place."
"T
he  study  in  2014  had  also  estimated  an  annual  income  of  Rs.  704m.  However,  what"
"was received was Rs. 80m less due to the distribution of a portion of the savings from"
"the  Fund  to  the  VAF,  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  500  per  officer  of  the  Volunteer  Force  every"
"month.  The  primary  cause  in  the  drop  of  revenue  was  the  failure  to  have  the  Regular"
"Force and the Volunteer Force make the same monthly contribution and the failure to"
"merge with the VAF. The drop in the total income had therefore been Rs. 165m.17"
