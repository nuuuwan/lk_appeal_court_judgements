"“The power of revision is an extraordinary  power which is quite independent"
"of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its object is the due"
"administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes committed by"
"this  Court  itself,  in  order  to  avoid  miscarriages  of  justice.  It  is  exercised  in"
"some cases by a Judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved person who may"
"not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that unless the power is"
"exercised injustice will result”."
