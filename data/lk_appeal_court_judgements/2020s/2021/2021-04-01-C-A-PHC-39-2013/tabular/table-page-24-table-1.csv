"premises either by himself or through one of his agents or servants as confirmed by"
"Muslih Abdul Cader in his affidavit marked 2V10."
"[52] The document marked 2V20 (a) is a Seizure Notice dated 05.08.2009 issued by"
"the Colombo Municipal Council for non-payment of rates in a sum of Rs. 29,468.57"
"and this letter had been addressed to the Owner or Occupier at premises bearing No."
"88/12. A perusal of the Receipt issued by the Colombo Municipal Council marked"
"2V20  (b)  reveals  that  the  Appellant,  on  31.12.2009  had  paid  the  said  sum  to  the"
"Colombo  Municipality 
to  avoid 
the  premises  being 
seized  by 
the  Colombo"
"Municipal Council. No evidence was adduced by the  1st Respondent to prove that"
"he was in possession of the premises in question or that he received the said notice"
"or paid the arrears of assessment rates in respect of the premises in question. It was"
"only the Appellant who had paid the arrears of assessment rates and thus, unless the"
"Appellant was in possession of the premises either by himself or through his agents,"
"he  could 
  not  have 
received 
the  said  notice  and  paid 
the  said 
rates 
to 
the"
"Municipality."
"[53] The documents issued by the Licensed Surveyor marked 2V9 (a) and 2V9 (b)"
"reveal that the said property was surveyed on 28.12.2009 and 09.01.2010 according"
"to the Plan No. 176A at  the request of the Appellant and at that time, there was no"
"boundary dispute in the premises in dispute. The Surveyor could not have entered"
"the  premises  and  done  such  a  survey  in  the  premises  unless  the  Appellant  was  in"
"possession of the said premises as no person had objected to any such survey being"
"carried out on the premises in dispute."
"[54]  One  Nasheeth  Abdul  Cader  has 
further  stated 
in  his  Affidavit 
that 
the"
"Appellant 
commenced 
repairs 
and 
renovations 
through 
a 
contractor  named"
"Sirajudeen  who  employed  around  4-6  workers  (2V23  (a).  The  said  Abdul  Majeed"
"Sirajudden  in  his  Affidavit  marked  2V13  has  confirmed  this  position  and  stated"
"inter alia, that he entered into a contract with the Appellant for a  contract sum of"
"Rs.  1,390,000/-and  carried  out 
renovations  on 
the  premises 
in  dispute 
from"
"04.01.2010 to 25.02.2010. He has further stated that one of his co-workers told him"
"on  26.02.2010 
that  around  7-8  persons  entered 
the  premises 
in  dispute  on"
"26.02.2010,  forcibly  took  them  in  a  Van  and  dropped  them  warning  them  not  to"
"return back to the premises and thus, he informed the incident to his engineer Mr."
"Hafeel."
"[55]  The  Appellant  has  adduced  credible  evidence 
to  establish 
that  after  he"
"purchased the premises in dispute, he surveyed the land, paid utility bills, arrears of"
"assessment rates,  employed a contractor and workers and carried out renovations to"
"the  premises  in  question  and  therefore,  he  was  in  possession  of  the  premises  in"
"question until 26.02.2010."
