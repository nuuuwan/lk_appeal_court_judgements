"High  Court  Judge  has  heavily  relied  on  the  date  of  the  dispute  referred  to  in  the"
"complaint, viz, 08.01.2010 and the date of the information filed by the Police, viz."
"20.04.2010  and  held  that  the  Intervenient-Respondent  was  in  possession  of  the"
"premises in dispute on the date of the filing of the information."
"[
60] It is settled law that a Judge of the Primary Court in an inquiry under section"
"68 (1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act should confine himself to the question"
"of  actual  possession  on  the  date  of  filing  information  except  in  a  case  where  a"
"person  who  had  been  in  possession  of  the  land  had  been  dispossessed  within  a"
"period  of  2  months  immediately  preceding  filing  of  information  (Ramalingam  v."
"Thangarajah (Supra). The position of the Appellant was that he was dispossessed"
"by  a  group  of  persons  on  26.02.2010  and  thereafter,  the  Intervenient-Respondent"
"was in unlawful possession of the premises in dispute after 26.02.2010."
"[
61]  The  first  question  that  arises  is  whether  the  Intervenient-Respondent  took"
"control of the possession of the premises in dispute on 25.01.2010 as claimed by the"
"1st  Respondent 
and 
the 
Intervenient-Respondent 
in 
their  Affidavits. 
The"
"Intervenient-Respondent  has  filed  the  documents  marked  3V1-3V17  in  support  of"
"his position that after he entered into the informal agreement dated 25.01.2010, he"
"took control of the premises in question on 25.01.2010."
"[
62] The document marked 3V1 is the deed of gift,  the document marked 3V2 is a"
"power  of  attorney  and  the  document  marked  3V3  is  an  informal  agreement  dated"
"25.01.2010.  These  documents  do  not  support  the  position  of  the  Intervenient-"
"Respondent in respect of the premises in question. The documents dated 17.05.2010"
"marked  3V4,  3V5  and  3V6  only  relate 
to 
the  registration  of  ownership  and"
"assessment  payment  made  on  17.05.2010  and  thus,  they  had  been  issued  after  the"
"information was filed by the Police on 20.04.2010."
"[63]  The  undated  photographs  marked  3V11-3V18  only  establish 
the  existing"
"position of the house, with sand stored in the premises and a security person being"
"put  on  guard  and  nothing  else.  They  do  not  support 
the  possession  of 
the"
"Intervenient-Respondent between the crucial period from 25.01.2010 to 26.02.2010."
"The  only  other  documents  that  have  been  filed  in  support  of  the  Intervenient-"
"Respondent’s  possession  are  the  Affidavit  given  by  one  Ukwatta  Liyanage  Ajith"
"marked 3V10 and the receipts marked 3V7-3V9 issued by Amila Lime Stores. The"
"said Ukwatta Liyanage Ajith in his Affidavit has stated that he acted as the Mason"
"for  the  Intervenient-Respondent  from  25.01.2010  and  that  all  the  items  including"
"cement and sand were supplied by the Intervenient-Respondent."
"[
64]  The 
Intervenient-Respondent’s  own  documents  marked  3V7-3V9  clearly"
"contradict  the  Affidavit  of  the  said  Ukwatta  Liyanage  Ajith.  The  Intervenient-"
"Respondent  has  not  produced  a  single  receipt  to  prove  that  he  purchased  building"
"materials  from  25.01.2010  to  26.02.2010  as  claimed  by  his  Mason,  who  in  his"
