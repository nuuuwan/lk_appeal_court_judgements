"necessity  and  suitability  at  this  stage,  and  due  deference  must  be  shown  to  the"
"conclusive nature of a written declaration made in terms of Section 5(1). In doing so,"
"I am mindful of the fact that  the necessity and suitability of the said land has been"
"determined in terms of an inquiry held in accordance with the provisions of Section"
"4, and that the order in terms of proviso (a) to Section 38 was made only thereafter.8"
"I  therefore  cannot  agree  with  the  second  argument  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner."
