"provisions  of  the  UGC  Circular  No.  723,  which  was  the  precursor  to  Circular  869."
"Having considered the provisions of the said circular, this Court held as follows:"
"â€œThe  Petitioner's  complaint  is  that  the  Selection  Committee  does  not  have  the"
"power to adjust  or alter the  marks given  by  the External Experts or the Panel."
"What then is the role of the Selection Committee? Circular No. 723 sets out that"
"the  'final  selection  shall  be  made  by  the  Selection  Committee  based  on  the"
"evaluation reports  and in conformity  with the procedure  of  appointment'. This"
"Court is of the view that the Selection Committee cannot merely rubber stamp"
"the marks given by the External Experts and the Panel and that the Selection"
"Committee must have the power to examine the marks given by each of the"
"experts and the panel, and where necessary make adjustments. However, this"
"Court is mindful that granting the Selection Committee the power to make any"
"adjustment  it  wishes  would  render  nugatory  the  object  that  is  sought  to  be"
"achieved  by  having  experts  to  review  an  application  for  Professor.  Either  way,"
"this Court is of the view that Circular No. 723 does not contemplate a complete"
"re-assessment of Sections 2 and 3.1, as in the instant case."
