"(2)","Section  29(1)  of  the  Universities  Act  of  No.  16  of  1978,  as  amended"
"","thereafter,  does  not  restrict  the  number  of  Chairs  in  a  given  discipline  to"
"","one.  Historically,  the  Colombo  Medical  School  has  had  Co-Professors  in"
"","some  Clinical  Disciplines 
including  Surgery.  So 
there 
is  precedent 
for"
"","appointing  Professor  Wijeyaratne  to  the  Chair  of  Surgery  on  an  equal"
"","footing with Professor Samarasekera."
"(
3)","Considerations of justice demand that both Professors of Surgery should be"
"","entitled  to  equal  rights.  Accordingly,  we  recommend  that  Professor  S.M."
"","Wijeyaratne  should  be  appointed  as  the  Head  of  the  Department  of"
"","Surgery for a period equal to the period Professor D.N. Samarasekera has"
"","functioned in that capacity."
"(
4)","If  any  single  event 
led  to  this  regrettable  state  of  affairs 
it  was  the"
"","arbitrary  allocation  of  7  extra  marks 
to  one  candidate  outside 
the"
"","provisions  of  Circular  No.  869,  and  therefore  future  expert  evaluators"
"","should be firmly instructed to strictly eschew arbitrariness in assessment.‚Äù"
