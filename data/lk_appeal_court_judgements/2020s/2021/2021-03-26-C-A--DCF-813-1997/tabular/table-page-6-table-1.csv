"[Tenancy,  licensee  superior  title]  judgment  to  be  entered  in  favour  of"
"the  Plaintiff.  In  the  re-vindicatio  action,  if  the  title  of  the  Plaintiff  is"
"admitted by the Defendant, the Defendant should begin the case.”"
"In Sirinivasam Prasanth vs. Nadaraja Devaraja7, recently the Supreme"
"Court has reiterated the above position as follows:"
"per Mahinda Samayawardena, J."
"“In  a vindicatory  action,  the  initial burden is on  the Plaintiff  to prove"
"title to the property. If he fails to prove title, the Plaintiff’s action shall"
"fail no matter how weak the case of the Defendant is. However, once"
"the paper title to the property is accepted by the Defendant or proved"
"by  the Plaintiff,  the  burden shifts  to  the  Defendant  to prove  on  what"
"right he is in possession of the property."
"Let  me  add  this  for  clarity.  The  right  to  possession  and  the  right  to"
"recover possession are essential attributes of ownership of immovable"
"property. The owner is entitled to these as of right. The law does not"
"require that the owner must possess his property. That is his choice."
"He  can  either  possess  it  or  leave  it  as  it  is.  In  simple  terms,  merely"
"because  the  owner  does  not  possess  the  property,  he  does  not  lose"
"ownership of the property.”8"
"Having  framed  the  issues  No.  16  and  17,  the  Defendant  took  up  the"
"position  that  one  Palihenage  Mudiyanse  had  obtained  a  prescriptive  title"
"to  the  subject  matter,  and  thereupon  by  Deed  bearing  No.  15  dated"
"24.11.1975  attested  by  D.H.  Seniviratne,  Notary  Public  marked  V1,  the"
"said  Palihenage Mudiyanse conveyed his rights to the Defendant."
"Therefore,  there  is  a  burden  cast  upon  the  Defendant  to  establish  the"
"purported  prescriptive  title  of  his  predecessor  in  title,  namely  Palihenage"
"Mudiyanse,  with  strong  and  cogent  evidence  as  required  in  Section  3  of"
"the  Prescription  Ordinance.  It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  Defendant"
