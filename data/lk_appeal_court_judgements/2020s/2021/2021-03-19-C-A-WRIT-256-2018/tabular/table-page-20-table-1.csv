"Having  considered  ‘P24’,  it  is  clear  to  me  that  the  decision  of  the  Administrative"
"Appeals Tribunal not to pay the salary and allowances for the period under which the"
"Petitioner  was  under  the  VOP  Order  has  been  taken  as  the  Administrative  Appeals"
"Tribunal was of the view that the Petitioner ought to have complied and complained."
"In other  words, in  the view of  the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal,  it is paramount"
"that discipline is maintained at all times by Public Servants. The situation may have"
"been  different  had  the  Petitioner  complied.  The  thinking  of  the  Administrative"
"Appeals Tribunal is that a Public Servant who has not complied and complained of an"
"order  served  on  him/her  cannot  be  compared  with  a  Public  Servant  who  has"
"complied and then complained."
