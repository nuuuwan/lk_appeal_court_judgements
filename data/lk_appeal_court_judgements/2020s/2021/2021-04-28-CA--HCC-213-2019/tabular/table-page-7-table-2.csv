"The said dictum as quoted by E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy in his book THE LAW"
"OF EVIDENCE Vol-01 page 21 reads as follows;"
"“No  person  accused  of  a  crime  is  bound  to  offer  any  explanation  of  his"
"conduct  or  of  circumstances  of  suspicion  which  is  attached  to  him;  but"
"nevertheless if he refuses to do so, where a strong prima facie case has"
"been made out, and when it is in his own power to offer evidence if such"
"exist, in explanation of such suspicious appearances which would show"
"him to be fallacious and explicable consistently with his innocence, it is"
"reasonable and justifiable conclusion that he refrains from doing so only"
"from  the  conviction  that  the  evidence  so  suppressed  or  adduced  would"
"operate adversely to his interest.” – Rex Vs. Lord Cochrane and Others"
"(1814) Gurney’s Report 479-"
