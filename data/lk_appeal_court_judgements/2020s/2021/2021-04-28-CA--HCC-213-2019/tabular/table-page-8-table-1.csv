"fabrication by Wills; and that the views expressed by Lord Ellenborough is"
"not a part of the law of Sri Lanka.”"
"When  it  comes  to  the  facts  of  the  instant  action,  the  appellant  has  failed  to"
"offer  any  explanation  as  to  the  incriminating  circumstantial  evidence  against"
"him.  Other  than  cross  examining  the  material  witnesses  as  to  the  time  of  the"
"incident  and  as  to  what  they  heard  just  before  they  saw  the  appellant  with  a"
"knife. The circumstantial evidence that links the appellant directly to the crime"
"has  not  been  disputed  at  any  point.  When  called  for  a  defence,  the  appellant"
"has  remained  silent.  The  trial  judge  has  taken  into  consideration  all  these"
"factors  in  his  judgment  with  clear  reasoning.  Therefore,  I  find  no  reasons  to"
"disagree  with  the  learned  High  Court  Judge’s  evaluation  of  the  evidence  and"
"his  finding  that  the  charge  against  the  appellant  has  been  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt."
"For the reasons stated above, I dismiss the appeal as it is devoid of merit, and"
"the conviction and the sentence imposed is affirmed."
