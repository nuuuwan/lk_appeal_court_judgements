"In Mendis v. Paramaswami 62 NLR 302 held that:"
"“Now  section  32  is  the  only  section  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  which"
"permits  the  proof  of  relevant  facts  contained  in  statements  made  by"
"'deceased  persons.  The  type  of  evidence  permitted  by  the  section  is"
"known  as  hearsay  evidence.  A  statement  of  relevant  facts  cannot  be"
"admitted  under  the  section  unless  the  statement  consists  of  the  very"
"words of the deceased person”"
