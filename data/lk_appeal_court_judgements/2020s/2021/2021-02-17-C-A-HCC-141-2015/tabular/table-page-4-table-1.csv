"Accused-Appellant  had  given  evidence  from  the  dock.  However,  the  Accused-Appellant  had"
"given evidence from the witness’s box and cross examined by the State Counsel.   The learned"
"High Court Judge weighed the Accused-Appellant’s evidence as unsworn evidence.    This is a"
"serious misdirection on the part of the trial Judge."
"T
he High Court Judge had stated in the Judgment that “Court suspects whether one shot only be"
"fired when a person opens fire for his self-defence. It means that the Court does not accept it as"
"true”"
"T
he view of the Trial Judge in this regard cannot be accepted.  The accused has not exceeded the"
"right of self-defence.    In the case of James Chandrasekera 44 NLR page 97, it was held that the"
"onus  is  not  a  heavy  one.  The  burden  is  no  higher  than  that  which  rests  upon  a  party  to  civil"
"proceedings."
"T
he Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent conceded the fact that the Judgment"
"cannot be supported in view of the serious misdirection on the part of the trial Judge. We are of"
"the  view  that  the  Accused-Appellant  has  proved  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  had"
"exercised the right of private defence."
"T
he  police  have  found  a  live  hand  grenade  in  the  shorts  of  the  deceased.    In  view  of  that"
"evidence,  it  is  probable  that  the  deceased  had  attempted  to  grab  hold  of  the  gun  that  was  in"
"possession of the Accused – Appellant.  It is also probable that the deceased attempted to use the"
"grenade he was carrying."
"T
here was no evidence to show that the deceased was a known person to the Appellant. At the"
"time of the incident the accused being a public servant who was entrusted with the task of giving"
"security to that area during the peak of the war, against the LTTE."
"T
he learned High Court  Judge  seems  to  have taken the view that  the grenade  could  have been"
"introduced because it dropped when the body  was lifted.  There is  no evidence to  support this"
"view; it is purely a conjecture.  But the witness No. 2 said it was taken out from the shorts of the"
"4"
