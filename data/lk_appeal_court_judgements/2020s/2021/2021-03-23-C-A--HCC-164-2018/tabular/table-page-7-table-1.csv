"]12]","Having  considered  the  appeal  grounds  01  and  02  of  the  Appellant,  it  is"
"","crystal  clear  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  establish  the  identity  of  the"
"","Appellant  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  Hence,  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,"
"","certainly be accrued to the Appellant in this case."
"[13]","As  the  appeal  grounds  01  and  02  have  merits  and  greatly  affect  the"
"","findings of the trial court, it is not necessary for this court to consider the"
"","other  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Learned  Counsel  on  behalf  of  the"
"","Appellant."
"[14]","For  the  reasons  stated  above,  we  set  aside  the  conviction  and  sentence"
"","imposed  on  the  Appellant  by  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Galle  on"
"","02.07.2018."
"[15]","The appeal is accordingly allowed."
"[16]","The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High Court of"
"","Galle along with the original case record."
