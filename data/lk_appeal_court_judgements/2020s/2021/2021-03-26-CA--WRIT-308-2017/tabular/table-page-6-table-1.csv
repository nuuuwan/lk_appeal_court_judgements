"Visa Numbers, BOI/17/175/000001, based on which Resident Visa was previously issued"
"on account of the Agreements with the Board of Investment."
"F
urther it is the contention of the Petitioner, that he is in no way responsible for the same"
"and  that  the  Petitioner  should  not  suffer  and  be  prejudiced,  in  view  of  the  purported"
"actions  of  the  1st  and  the  2nd  Respondents  and  their  servants  and  agents.  Thus,  the"
"Petitioner states that it is clearly evident, that it is in order to conceal their own mistake"
"the Petitioner’s Resident Visa, which was originally extended until 07/08/2018, was most"
"abruptly, precipitously, arbitrarily, unfairly, capriciously and vexatious revoked, without a"
"due and a proper hearing or explanations being called for as contemplated in law."
"As  opposed  to  the  aforesaid  submissions  of  the  Petitioner,  it  is  the  contention  of  the"
"Respondents that the Petitioner applied for an extension of the Residence Visa under the"
"Category of a pending court case. The case, which was pending in the Magistrate’s Court"
"of Nuwara-Eliya, was a legal action filed against the Petitioner by the Divisional Secretary"
"of Nuwara-Eliya, on the allegation of obstruction to carry out official duties."

"embodied  in  P14  &  R3  was  taken  by  the  Controller  of  Immigration  to  cancel  the  Visa."
"Thereafter, the Minister by acting under section 28(2) (b) could direct the removal of such"

"The Respondents argue that the Controller of Immigration has no legal obligation to wait"
"till the expiry date of the said Residence Visa without resorting to revoke the Residence"
