"4th Defendants points of contests have been raised about the identity of the land, the Plaintiffs"
"have  failed  to  call  the  Surveyor  who  prepared  the  preliminary  plan  marked  as  X  to  give"
"evidence to establish the identity of the land."
"In paragraph 5 of the report marked as X1, the Surveyor has reported that in his opinion, the"
"land he had surveyed is substantially same as the land sought to be partitioned as described in"
"the schedule to the amended plaint. In terms of section 18 (2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of"
"1977,  the  facts  stated  in  the  Surveyor  plan  and  the  report  can  be  used  as  evidence  without"
"further proof. Therefore, since the facts stated in a surveyor report can be used as prima facie"
"evidence, in the instant action the burden of displacing facts stated in the surveyor report by"
"calling the Surveyor or offering further evidence of an inconsistent or contradictory nature had"
"been on the 2nd to 4th Defendants. Nevertheless, they have failed to make any application from"
"Court to summon the Surveyor to examine him or to adduce any inconsistent or contradictory"
"evidence. Therefore, the Court can come to the conclusion that the Plaintiff has discharged his"
"onus to prove that the land sought to be partitioned is lot 1 in the preliminary plan marked as"
"X. Even though, the Surveyor has stated in the paragraph 9 of his report marked as X1 that the"
"land  he  had  surveyed  is  a  portion  of  the  land  shown  in  plan  marked  as  2-වි-1,  he  has  not"
"superimposed  2-වි-1  on  the  preliminary  plan  marked  as  X.  The  Court  cannot  believe  that  a"
"surveyor would be able to make such a conclusion without preparing a superimposition plan."
"Under the above stated circumstances, the Court can conclude that it has been proved that the"
"subject matter of the action is lot 1 in the preliminary plan marked as X."
"The learned Counsel for the 2nd - 4th Defendants further argue that even though, the land sought"
"to be partition is one Amuna in paddy sowing extent, the plan X does not show a land in the"
"extent of one Amuna. That argument is based on the fact that according to the Sinhalese method"
"of measuring the lands, in Kegalle District the extent of one Amuna should be equivalent to"
"approximately 5 Acres according to the English measurement. The extent of the land depicted"
"in plan X is only 1 Acre 2 Roods and 30 Perches. The Sinhalese land measures are computed"
"according to the extent of land require to sow either paddy or kurakkan. The number of seed"
"requires to sow in a particular extent of land would depend on varies factors like quality and"
"the size of the seeds, fertility of the soil, etc. Therefore, the land area which require to sow the"
"same number of seeds would vary from district to district or even in the same district and cannot"
"be considered as an accurate and standard method of measuring land.  When identifying the"
"corpus in a partition action, the Court should consider the boundaries of the land as mentioned"
"in the title deeds with the boundaries according to the Surveyor plans."
