in  coming  to  the  conclusion,  that  the"
"prosecution has proved their case ""beyond reasonable doubt"". In reply to the contention of the"
"02nd defence witness appellant, the complainant-respondent argued that the learned High Court"
"Judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses."
"The  Attorney  General  vs  Sandanam  Pitchi  Mary  Theresa  S.C.  Appeal  79/2008  decided  on"

"""Appellate  Courts  are  generally  slow  to  interfere  with  the  decisions  of  inferior  courts"
"question of fact or oral testimony. The Privy Council has stated that appellate court should"
"not ordinarily interfere with the trial court's opinion as to the credibility of a witness as the"
"trial  judge  alone  know  the  demeanour  of  witness;  he  alone  can  appreciate  how  the"
"questions are answered, whether with honest candour or with doubtful plausibility and"
"whether after careful thought or with reckless glibness; and he alone can form a reliable"
"opinion as to whether the witness has emerged with credit from cross-examination.‚Äù"
"The learned counsel for the complainant-respondent says that the Learned Trial Judge accurately"
"noted in his judgement that during cross-examination, she firmly held the position that she had"
"not  had  any  telephone  conversation  or  any  other  connection  whatsoever  with  the  accused-"
"appellant after his arrest. She also maintained that she did not know the mobile number of the"
"Accused-Appellant and she had further failed to disclose her mobile number on being questioned"
"about the number that she is using."
"The prosecution calling evidence in rebuttal brought cogent evidence to the fact that there was"
"telephone correspondence between 0755971047, the mobile number used by the  02nd defence"
"witness appellant and 0770624787, the mobile number used by the accused-appellant more than"

"appellant  a  short  while  before  giving  evidence 
in  Court  and  while  the  trial  was  ongoing."
"Accordingly, the learned counsel for the complainant-respondent argued that it is apparent that"
"the witness had given false evidence and that she tried to conceal the telephone communications"
"with  the  accused-appellant.  Hence,  it  was  submitted  that  there  was  a  glaring  case  of  perjury"
"warranting the learned High Court Judge to proceed under Section 449 (1) of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure Act."
