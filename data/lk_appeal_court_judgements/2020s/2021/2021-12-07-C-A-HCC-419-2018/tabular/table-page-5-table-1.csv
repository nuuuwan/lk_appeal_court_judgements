"and noticed the accused being held by several people with one handcuffed. She immediately ran"
"out of the room to the OIC and informed him and never returned to the previous room."
"The learned counsel for the 02nd defence witness appellant submitted that she got to know the"
"identity of the officers only when one of them said to the OIC that ""they are from bribery"". She"
"was only in the corridor when she saw through the glass panel of the room that one officer lifting"
"something from the waste paper box announcing aloud that they found ""it"". Though she heard"
"that through the wire mesh on top of the glass panel, the other conversations which were not so"
"loud were inaudible to her. It was argued that according to this clear explanation of what exactly"
"the witness saw and heard during the incident, it is difficult to presume that she could during that"
"time, ascertain to which incident this arrest related to, and should not be expected to protest,"
"complain or even make a note, without knowing the exact incident."
"What the witness right throughout has maintained was that she did not see or hear the accused"
"receiving money or discussing the same with the complainant. She explains that she was engaged"
"in work at her table and was not paying attention to who was at the desk of the accused or to"
"what  they  were  discussing  and  therefore  did  not  hear  anything  or  see  anything  until  the"
"movements of the steel table of the accused caught her attention, which caused her to look up to"
"see the accused being partly handcuffed."
"The learned counsel for the 02nd defence witness appellant says that there is no reason to accuse"
"that  this  type  of  evidence  of  the  witness  amounts  to  evidence  ""falsely  given  to  show  that  the"
"accused did not solicit or accept money"". It is unreasonable for the witness to have been accused"
"as in allegation 1, based on a few selected questions and answers, having ignored other plausible"
"explanations in her lengthy evidence."
"It  is  my  view that the  evidence of the  02nd  defence  witness  appellant  concerning the  incident,"
"though  disbelieved  by  the  learned  trial  judge,  does  not  amount  to  deliberately  giving  false"
"evidence and such finding of the learned trial judge is against the weight of evidence adduced in"
"this  matter.  Therefore,  allegation  1  upon  which  the  witness  was  punished  does  not  hold  firm"
"ground. Allegation number 2 is not about a material point of the main case but relates only as to"
"the denying of the witness of any telephone conversation and SMS with the accused. This factor"
"should not be allowed to overshadow or prejudice the other evidence of the witness."
"The learned  trial  Judge has  erred  in  law  in  neglecting the need for a  glaring  case  of  perjury  to"
"proceed  under  section  449(1)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act.  The  proceedings  and"
"punishment under section 449(1) for perjury requires a high degree of proof that the witness has"
"deliberately  given  false  evidence  to  mislead  the  court  and  should  not  be  applied  to  instances"
"where the court should only disregard her evidence as untrue."
"AG Vs. Silvan Silva (1981) 1 SLR 364 it was observed; ""A witness should not be dealt with under s."
"161(2)  of  the  Administration  of  Justice  Law  (substantially  same  as  sec.  440  (1)  of  Criminal"
"Procedure code of 1898 and sec. 449 (1) of the present Code of Criminal Procedure Act) unless"
"the  evidence  is  inherently  or  palpably  false.  The  question  of  perjury  must  be  determined  on"
"certainties."""
