"In the judgement dated 16.11.2018 of the learned trial judge in the main case, nowhere has he"
"concluded that the said witness has given false evidence as to her presence at the time of the"
"arrest of the accused. The wordings of the 1st allegation levelled against the 02nd defence witness"
"appellant in the inquiry under Section 449(1) also indicated that her evidence on her presence at"
"the time of arrest was a major part of the allegation. A part of the evidence alleged to be false at"
"the said inquiry is not based on a determination or finding of the main case, and thus it invalidates"
"the inquiry under section 449(1) as such determination or finding is an essential prerequisite to"
"an inquiry under section 449(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"The grounds to form the conclusion against the 02nd defence witness appellant, the learned trial"
"judge has ignored the weightage of the evidence which is adverse such a conclusion. Telephone"
"calls  and  SMS  While  conceding  that  the  defence  has  admitted  the  32  items  of  calls  and  SMS"
"between the said mobile phone numbers of the accused and the witness as depicted in a report"
"marked as X4 by the prosecution, the finding of the learned trial judge that the said items related"
"to the ""time closer to that of giving evidence by the witness"" are wrong. The period of the relevant"
"telephone  records  marked  X4  and  tendered  by  the  prosecution  as  evidence  in  rebuttal  is  only"
"relevant to the period from 20.02.2017 to 22.11.2017. The period of such items listed separately"
"and considered by the learned trial Judge is 05-09-2017 to 18-10-2017."
"It is important to note that none of these items relates to the date of the evidence of the  02nd"
"defence  witness  appellant  who  commenced  and  concluded  her  evidence  on  02-03-2018."
"Therefore, the above records are insufficient to conclude that the witness was ""coached by the"
"accused"" before giving evidence."
"The  Counsel  for  the  prosecution  had  initially  cross-examined  the  witness  on  her  telephone"
"connections. Without asking whether the witness has any other telephone numbers, the Counsel"
"has  straightaway proceeded to  question the  number used  by the  husband of the  witness.  It  is"
"natural  for  a  witness  to  mention  the  most  frequently  used  number  when  asked  ""What  is  the"
"telephone used by you""? While conceding that the witness has failed to explain why the other"
"number was not mentioned in her answer to the very first question put to her, according to the"
"sequence of questions and answers in the said pages it is not fair to conclude that the witness has"
"deliberately tried to conceal the telephone number in question."
"The learned trial judge has ignored the evidence in which the witness has explained how certain"
"items happened to be in her memory."
"The learned counsel for the 02nd defence witness appellant says that she remembered the exact"
"date of the incident because she had checked it up in a RIB at the police station after receiving"
"summons from court, and keeping in mind the court date of the traffic offence. Not only that she"
"remembered  having  lunch  at  1.00  pm  as  she  has  her  lunch  at  that  time  every  day.  She  has"
"explained on several occasions that since this incident was the very first experience to her, she"
"remembered certain things even after 10 years."
"It is evident that reason for not protesting, complaining and entering notes the witness has very"
"clearly stated that being in her low rank, she was not in a position to protest or complain against"
"the  arrest  of  the  accused  and  the  only  thing  she  could  do  was  to  leave  the  formalities  to  her"
"superiors. She also maintains that she would have commented if a statement was recorded from"
"her. The witness has clearly explained that after taking notes at the desk of the accused she moved"
"to another desk in front of him and was engaged in pasting the notes when she sensed a struggle"
