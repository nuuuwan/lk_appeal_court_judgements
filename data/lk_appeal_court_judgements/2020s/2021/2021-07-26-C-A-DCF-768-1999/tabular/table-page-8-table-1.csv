"the parties, however, can give no authority or jurisdiction to a court, to"
"deviate from the substantial law or an imperative procedural step. It is"
"a fundamental principle that no consent can confer a court the authority"
"to  exercise  its power  in  a particular  way,  when  the Law  expects  the"
"Court  to  do  it  in  a  different  manner.  Therefore,  the  decision  of  the"
"learned District Judge to treat Lot A and C depicted in the second plan"
"as the corpus, lacks any legal bar."
"The Court has a duty to identify the corpus without causing damages"
"to third parties by dragging their lands into the corpus. One of the ways"
"in which it could be achieved is by having recourse to a legally prepared"
"preliminary plan and a report. In the absence of such a plan and report"
"court may unconsciously extend a helping hand to collusion against the"
"rest of the world which can take away the sanctity attached to a final"
"decree. Hence, it is totally unsafe to decide on the corpus with the help"
"of a plan and report prepared outside the Legislative guidance shown"
"under Section 16 and 18.‚Äù"
