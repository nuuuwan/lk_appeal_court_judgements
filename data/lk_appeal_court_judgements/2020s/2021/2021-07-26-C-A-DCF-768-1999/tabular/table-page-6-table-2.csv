"No. 6617 prepared by surveyor Seniviratne be accepted as the preliminary"
"plan. Dr. Ranarajah, J. observed that,"
"“Section 18 of the Partition Law provides for parties dissatisfied with"
"the preliminary plan prepared on commission issued by court to make"
"an application for a commission to issue on the Surveyor General. The"
"petitioner  has  not  availed  himself  of  this  provision  of  law.  Similarly,"
"there is provision, in that section for a party to have a surveyor who"
"conducted the survey to be summoned to court and examined on any"
"matter arising from the preliminary plan and report filed in court. The"
"petitioner  has  not  had  recourse  to  that  provision.  Instead,  he  had"
"sought  a  fresh  commission  on  another  surveyor  to  conduct  a  second"
"preliminary survey which is not permitted by law. There is no error in"
"the order made by court.”"
