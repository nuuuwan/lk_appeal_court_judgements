"When considering the totality of the evidence, it appears that the"
"learned  trial  judge  has  failed  to  evaluate  the  evidence  in  the  correct"
"perspective and has disregarded the principles governing the reception"
"and evaluation of circumstantial evidence."
"When an overall view of the evidence is taken, the only conclusion"
"that  this  Court  can  arrive  at  is,  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to"
"establish the case beyond reasonable doubt."
"Accordingly, I set  aside the conviction and sentence imposed by"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Panadura  and  acquit  the  accused"
"appellant. The appeal is therefore, allowed. The registrar is directed to"
"send a copy of this order with the original case record to the High Court"
"of Panadura."
