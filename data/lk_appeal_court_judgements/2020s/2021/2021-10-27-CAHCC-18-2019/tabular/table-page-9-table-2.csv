"In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Potta Naufer and others (2007) 2"
"SLR 144 at page 184, it was held:"
"“Motive has been defined as ‘that which moves or influence the mind’. An"
"action  without  a  motive  has  been  considered  to  be  an  effect  without  a"
"cause.  It  has  been  defined  in  Gangaram  Vs.  Emperor  62  IC  545,  as"
"something  so  operating  upon  the  mind  as  to  induce  or  to  tend  towards"
"inducing a particular act or course of conduct."
"With  respect  to  the  relevance  of  motive  to  a  criminal  case,  it  has  been"
"stated with clarity that the existence of a motive is not a wholly essential"
"ingredient in the prosecution case. There is no requirement therefore for the"
"prosecution to prove a motive in order to prove a charge. The motive which"
"induces  a  man  to  do  a  particular  act  is  known  to  him  and  him  alone."
