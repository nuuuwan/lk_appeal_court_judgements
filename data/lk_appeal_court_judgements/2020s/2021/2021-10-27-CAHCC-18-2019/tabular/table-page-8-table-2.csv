"perhaps  it  is  a sort  of a psychological  defense mechanism  activated on"
"the spur of the moment."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  mentioned  inconsistencies  and  infirmities  of  the"
"two  witnesses,  namely,  PW-02  and  PW-03  are  too  trivial  in  nature  to  be"
"considered as relevant. Although there is an omission in the evidence of PW-"
"03  as  to  who  was  assaulted  first  by  the  appellant,  her  evidence  has  been"
"consistent  as  to  the  events  that  took  place  thereafter.  Even  as  to  the  fact"
"whether  the  appellant  was  holding  the  knife  or  whether  he  had  it  in  his"
"waist  when  the  initial  assault  took  place  cannot  be  considered  material"
"omissions. When taken as a whole, it is obvious that she has forgotten some"
"of the events that took place on that fateful day due to the passage of time."
"The evidence clearly shows that when PW-02 was dragged by the appellant"
"by  holding  her  from  her  hair,  she  had  no  way  of  looking  up  as  she  was"
"facing  downwards  due  to  the  grip  of  the  appellant.  That  may  be  the  very"
"reason why she did not speak about the first stabbing on to the back of her"
"mother  and  even  the  stabbing  to  the  head.  It  was  the  PW-03  who  was"
"observing  from  a  little  distance  away  who  has  clearly  seen  the  stabbing,"
"which  is  highly  probable,  given  the  circumstances  of  the  incident.  I  am"
"unable to agree with the contention that the evidence as to how the stabbing"
"took  place  was  improbable  as  it  has  no  basis.  I  find  that  the  testimonial"
"trustworthiness  of  the  evidence  of  the  witnesses  have  not  been  dented  in"
