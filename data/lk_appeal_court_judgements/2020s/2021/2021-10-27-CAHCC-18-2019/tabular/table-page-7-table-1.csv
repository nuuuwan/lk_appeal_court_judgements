"At  this  stage 
it 
is  appropriate  to  refer  to  the 
Indian  case  of  Bhoginbhai"
"Hitijibhai Vs State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758)  very often"
"cited in our courts. It was held:"
"1)  By  and  large  a  witness  cannot  be  expected  to  possess  a  photographic"
"memory  and  to  recall  the  details  of  an  incident.  It  is  not  as  if  a  video"
"tape is replayed on the mental screen."
"2)  Ordinarily,  so  happens  that  a  witness 
is  overtaken  by  events.  The"
"witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an"
"element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to"
"be attuned to absorb the details."
"3)  The  powers  of  observation  differ from  person  to  person.  What  one  may"
"notice, and the other may not. An object or movement might emboss its"
"image on one personâ€™s mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part"
"another."
"4)  By  and 
large  people  cannot  accurately 
recall  a  conversation  and"
"reproduce  the  very  words  used  by  them  or  heard  by  them.  They  can"
"only  recall  the  main  purpose  of  the  conversation.  It  is  unrealistic  to"
"expect a witness to be a human tape recorder."
"5) 
In  regard 
to  exact 
time  of  an 
incident,  or 
the 
time  duration  of  an"
"occurrence,  usually  people  make  their  estimates  by  guesswork  on  the"
"spur of  the moment  at  the  time of  interrogation. And one cannot expect"
"people to make very precise or reliable estimates of such matters. Again,"
"it depends on the time-sense of individuals which varies from person to"
"person."
"6)  Ordinarily  a  witness 
cannot  be  expected 
to 
recall  accurately 
the"
"sequence  of  events  which  take  place  in  rapid  succession  or  in  a  short"
"time  span.  A  witness 
is 
liable 
to  get  confused  or  mixed  up  when"
"interrogated later on."
