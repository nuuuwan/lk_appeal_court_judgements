"However, when an information is filed by a Party to the dispute under Section 66 (1) (b) it is"
"left to the Judge to satisfy himself that there is a dispute affecting land owing to which a"
"breach of the peace is threatened or likely."
"Since the Appellant was not provided any evidence as to the dispossession of the premises"
"and the land in dispute, the Appellant is not entitled to relief in terms of prayer (à¶‡) of the"
"Plaint."
"It was held in Kayas Vs. Nazeer and others, [2004 (3) S.L.R 202], Section 68 (3) mandates"
"the Primary Court Judge directing restoration, if he is satisfied that any person who had been"
"in possession has been forcibly dispossessed within two months immediately preceding the"
"date of filing the information."
"In the instant case, there is no forceful dispossession proved by the Appellant within two"
"months immediately before the date of filing the information. Thus, the learned Primary"
"Court Judge has not made a direction to restoration of possession."
"As such, it is seen that the learned Magistrate, acting as a Primary Court Judge has correctly"
"dismissed the action of the Plaintiff-Petitioner-Appellant and also directed the Parties to"
"resolve their dispute pertaining to the subject land by a Competent Jurisdiction of a Civil"
"Court."
"In view of the foregoing reasons, it is apparent that the Appellant has no exceptional"
"circumstances to invoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the"
"Central Province against the Order of the learned Magistrate."
"Hence, we are not inclined to interfere with the Order dated 03.09.2013 by the learned"
"Magistrate and the Order dated 06.10.2015 by the learned High Court Judge."
