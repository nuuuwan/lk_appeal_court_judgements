"The  plaintiff-respondent-respondent-respondent  (herein  after"
"referred  to  as  the  plaintiff)  had  instituted  this  partition  action  to  partition  the"
"corpus in this case namely “Lot 04 of Lot 08 of Maanagoda Kurunduwatta” which is"
"morefully described in the schedule to the plaint. It is common ground that it is a"
"sub  division  of  a  larger  land  which  was  partitioned  in  an  earlier  partition  action"
"bearing no. 30701P in DC Kalutara. In the final plan marked X3 it is shown as Lot 04."
"In the earlier partition action this lot had been allotted to the predecessors of the"
"plaintiff and the defendant and the adjoining Lot no. 03 had been allotted to the"
"01st petitioner."
"The  corpus  in  this  case  is  depicted  as  lots  no.  01,02,03  in  the"
"preliminary plan no. 2133 prepared by surveyor Jayasuriya. The judgement in this"
"case  was  pronounced  on  13.09.2006  and  the  interlocutory  decree  was  entered"
"accordingly.  Thereafter  the  surveyor  had  surveyed  the  land  to  prepare  the  final"
"scheme of partition. The petitioners state that the plaintiff attempted to show the"
"boundaries of the corpus within Lot 03 claimed by the petitioners. There after the"
"petitioners had made an application to the District Court under section 839 of the"
"civil  procedure  code  seeking  relief  and  the  court  after  holding  an  inquiry  had"
"dismissed this application on 27.01.2017."
"The learned counsel for the defendant respondent submitted that"
"there  is  a  long  delay  on  the  part  of  the  petitioners  which  is  not  explained.  He"
"submitted that the preliminary plan had been prepared in 1993 and the judgement"
"had  been  entered  on  13.09.2006.  The  learned  District  Judge  had  refused  the"
"application  of  the  petitioners  on  27.01.2017.  But  the  petitioners  had  made  this"
"application to this court on 20.03.2018. The Petitioners have explained the delay."
"The petitioners say that the surveyor did not erect or identified any boundaries at"
"the preliminary survey. Therefore the petitioners could not have come to know that"
"a portion of their land had come into the corpus in this case and the petitioners had"
"no cause to complain at the stage. It is only at the final survey that the petitioners"
"came  to  know  that  a  portion  of  their  land  had  been  included  into  the  corpus."
"Therefore the delay is explained up to that point. There after the petitioners had"
"made  an  attempt  to  intervene  into  the  partition  action  which  was  refused.  The"
"leave to appeal application which was filed against that order in the Provincial High"
"Court was withdrawn on 05.03.2018."
