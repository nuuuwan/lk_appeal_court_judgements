"there  is  some  merit  in  what  the  petitioners  say  and  they  should  be  given  an"
"opportunity to establish their case. The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent"
"and  the  defendant  respondent  submitted  that  the  petitioners  had  not  satisfied"
"court that there is an encroachment and there is no evidence to show that there is"
"an  encroachment.  Further 
the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  plaintiff 
respondent"
"submitted 
that 
the  petitioners  did  not  complain 
to 
the  surveyor  about  an"
"encroachment at the time of the preliminary survey. It is the case of the petitioners"
"that  the  surveyor  did  not  demarcate  the  common  boundary  at  the  preliminary"
"survey. Therefore the petitioners could not have known at that stage that there is"
"an encroachment. As the petitioners were not parties to the partition action they"
"did not have an opportunity to show the encroachment in a plan. Had the surveyor"
"demarcated  the  boundary  at  the  preliminary  survey  the  petitioners  could  have"
"intervened 
at 
the  preliminary 
survey 
as  new 
claimants 
and 
shown 
the"
"encroachment in the preliminary plan. The petitioners had lost that opportunity. A"
"copy of the plaint is annexed to the commission for the preliminary survey. In the"
"schedule to the plaint the corpus is described as a sub division of lot no. 4 of the"
"final plan no. 283. Although a copy of the commission is not before us for perusal"
"the  commissioner  in  his  report  had  mentioned  that  the  plan  referred  to  in  the"
"schedule to the plaint was not given to him by the plaintiff or the defendant. That"
"shows that the commissioner was conscious about his duty to identify the corpus"
"according to the earlier plan and depict in the preliminary plan the land described"
"in  the  schedule  to  the  plaint  which  is  described  with  reference  to  the  earlier"
"partition plan. In such a situation the commissioner should have informed that fact"
"to  court  and  sought 
further 
instructions 
from  court  before  proceedings 
to"
