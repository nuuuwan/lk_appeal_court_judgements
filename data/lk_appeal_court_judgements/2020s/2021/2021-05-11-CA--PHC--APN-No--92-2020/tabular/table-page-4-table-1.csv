"before this court the following grounds upon which this petitioner should be enlarged"
"on bail."
"1. The petitioner had been in remand since 2018,"
"2. The petitioner being a foreign national is facing difficult situation inside the prison,"
"3. The discrepancies in the investigations,"
"4. The petitioner volunteering to produce two, Sri Lankan nationals as sureties."
"It is very clear under the provisions of the act under which the petitioner was arrested"
"that if a suspect taken in to custody under the above mentioned act the said person"
"has 
to  urge  exceptional  circumstances 
to  obtain  bail. 
In 
the  case  of  CA 
(PHC)"
"APN147/2017 
it  has  been  decided  very  clearly  that  “facts  of  the  case’  do  not"
"constitute  exceptional  circumstances  and  those  need  to  be  addressed  at  trial  stage,"
"time  period  of  remand  also  has  been  considered  in  the  same  order  and  it  has  been"
"decided that it cannot be considered as exceptional, and the said order has gone on to"
"consider case law pertaining to the same issue."
"When  an  application  of  this  nature  has  been  filed  what  this  court  must  consider"
"according  to  the  provisions  of  the  CPC  as  stated  above,  the 
illegalities  and  the"
"irregularities  of  the 
impugned  order  and  non-compliance  of  the  same  warrants"
"dismissal, which makes it very clear that the ground analysis should be as with regard"
"to the situation at the time of the impugned order and not in the present context."
"Anyhow  the  provisions  of  the  Act  under  which  the  petitioner  had  been  taken  in  to"
"custody it is very clear that a suspect should be kept in remand until the conclusion of"
"the  trial  except  in  exceptional  circumstances  which  shocks  the  conscious  of  court  in"
"the impugned order."
