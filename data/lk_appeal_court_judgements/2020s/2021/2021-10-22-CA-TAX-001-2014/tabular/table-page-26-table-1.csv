"The  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  has  submitted  (paras.  39-51)  that  the"
"phrase ‘an incorrect amount of tax’ found in Section 25 of the VAT Act"
"ought to be interpreted to mean an amount of tax that has been mentioned"
"on an invoice by either mistake or error. She has argued that out of the 4"
"instances mentioned in the 2007 VAT Manual, items 1), 2), and 4) refer to"
"infrequent occurrences in practice, and that in interpreting item 3) which is"
"the  item  the  Appellant  contends  is  applicable  to  the  adjustment  of  tax"
"owing to post-sale discounts, this Court should hold that the said item was"
"not  intended  to  be  used  to  accommodate  a  regular  practice  of  post-sale"
"adjustment. She has thus argued for item 3) to also be used only in case of"
"unforeseen circumstances, to make “one-off” adjustments (para. 151)."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  has  countered  these  submissions"
"made on behalf of the Respondent by submitting (para. 65) that the term"
"‘incorrect’  ought  not  to  be  limited  to  ‘error/mistake’  alone.  I  find  this"
"argument to be convincing, particularly upon considering that none of the"
"four instances listed in the 2007 VAT Manual arise owing to clerical error,"
"and the fact that the said Manual has been published by the Respondent"
"itself. Furthermore, I accept the Appellant’s argument that all four of the"
"above-said instances arise post-sale, and thus do not reflect mistakes made"
"at the time of sale."
"In my view, it does not matter exactly how the amount of tax mentioned"
"on an invoice happens to be incorrect, so long as on the reflection of facts,"
"it is incorrect. I am not prepared to read such considerations as frequency"
"or error into the concise phrasing of Section 25, particularly where they"
"appear  indefensible  given  the  Respondent’s  own  interpretation  of  the"
"section in the 2007 VAT Manual."
"I therefore conclude that the term ‘incorrect’ in Section 25 of the VAT Act"
"can be interpreted to include tax adjustments necessitated through the offer"
"of post-sale volume discounts. I dismiss the learned Senior State Counsel’s"
"submission (para. 68) that it is the fault of the Appellant that they are unable"
"to include the correct value of supply on its invoices. There is a genuine"
"practical inability to do so in the present case."
"I am mindful of the fact that this Court is not bound by the guidelines issued"
"by the DIR in the 2007 VAT Manual, unless they are given statutory force"
"through a specific provision in the VAT Act. Yet, Assessors and the CGIR"
"are bound to follow these guidelines in arriving at their decisions, and thus,"
