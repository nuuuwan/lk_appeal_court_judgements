"set out in the tax credit note, would be offset by the increase in the VAT"
"payable by its VAT-registered customers at the next step of the VAT chain."
"According  to  the  Appellant,  the  actual  consideration  it  receives  for  the"
"supply of livestock feed is the nett amount once both trade discounts and"
"volume discounts have been applied. As such, the Appellant submitted its"
"VAT returns based on the actual consideration received after accounting"
"for both discounts."
"The Respondent’s contention is that the Appellant should not be allowed"
"to adjust the value of a taxable supply, for the purpose of calculating VAT,"
"owing to a contingent/volume discount granted to its customers subsequent"
"to the time of supply. In other words, the Respondent has submitted that"
"the adjustment of VAT owing to post-sale discounts is not allowable under"
"the provisions of the VAT Act."
"I will now move on to consider the questions of law set out above in this"
"judgment.  In  considering  these  questions,  whether  they  make  specific"
"reference to the facts of the case or otherwise, it is obvious that the Court"
"would  have  to  scrutinise  the  facts  so  far  as  they  are  relevant  to  a  given"
"question of law, unless a question involves a matter of pure interpretation."
"It  is  trite  law  that  the  consideration  of  whether  the  available  facts  are"
"sufficient to arrive at a conclusion constitutes a question of law.1"
"In the volume titled Income Tax In Sri Lanka, Gooneratne states that:2"
"‘The principle is well established that where a tribunal arrives at a finding"
"which is not supported by evidence the finding though stated in the form of"
"a finding of fact is a finding which involves a question of law. The question"
"of law is whether there was evidence to support the finding, apart from the"
"adequacy of the evidence. The Court will interfere if the finding has been"
"reached without any evidence or upon a view of facts which could not be"
"reasonably entertained. The evidence can be examined to see whether the"
"Board  [being  the  Board  of  Review;  the  predecessor  to  the  TAC]  being"
"properly appraised of what they had to do could reasonably have arrived"
"at the conclusion they did.’"
