"Having considered the above, I answer the first, fifth, sixth, fifteenth, and"
"twentieth questions of law in the affirmative, noting that in the case of the"
"fifth question of law, it was the Assessor that allowed the trade discounts,"
"which were not in issue before the TAC. I answer the tenth question of law"
"in the negative, with the qualification that in the case of adjustments arising"
"from post-sale discounts (which is the subject matter of this appeal), any"
"such adjustments may only be done in accordance with terms known to all"
"customers at the point of sale, so as not to be contrary to the concept of an"
"open market value."
"2.  Did the Commission misdirect itself in law at page 6 of the determination"
"in concluding that customers take “independent decisions” to purchase"
"livestock  feeds  “based  on  the  ‘price  lists’  published  by  the  Appellant"
"Company”  without  any  evidence  before  the  Commission  in  support  of"
"such conclusions?"
"The prices of the Appellant’s products were published and were subject to"
"change without prior notice (vide eighteen price lists marked as “A2”). On"
"a  perusal  of  these  price  lists,  it  appears  that  the  prices  have  regularly"
"changed  monthly  and  sometimes  within  the  month  itself.  Hence,  it  is"
"obvious that the customers would have made their purchases based on self-"
"made decisions."
"I  cannot  therefore  hold  that  the  TAC  had  misdirected  itself  in  law  in"
"arriving  at 
this  particular  conclusion.  I 
therefore  answer 
the  second"
"question of law in the negative."
"3.  Did the Commission misdirect itself in law by concluding at page 7 of the"
"determination 
that 
there 
is  a  (sic)  “‘open  market  price’  commonly"
"applicable 
to  all 
customers  on 
that  particular  day” 
in 
complete"
"contradiction  to  its  own  finding  in  the  preceding  page  6  that  “open"
"market price of any commodity may vary” even on an “hourly” basis (in"
"addition to varying daily, weekly etc.)?"
"The ‘open market value’ is not an abstract concept, within its definition in"
"the VAT Act. Admittedly, discounts may vary within the percentage range,"
"depending on the volume of goods purchased within the month (vide page"
"1 of reasons for the determination of the CGIR marked ‘X3’). The open"
"market value applicable to the instant appeal is a value that contemplates"
"the application of the full volume discount, as the terms of this discount are"
"known to all customers at the point of sale. Section 5 (1) (a) of the VAT"
