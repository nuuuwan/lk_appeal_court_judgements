"1958 relating thereto. The intention behind the recognition of conditional transfers is"
"set out in the following paragraph:"
"â€œThe Supreme Court decisions hitherto point to the conclusion that the law does"
"not  warrant  the  construction  that  a  conditional  transfer  is  the  equivalent  of  a"
"mortgage. So that, today the Debt Conciliation Board is empowered to deal only"
"with mortgages and it has no right to entertain applications for relief in the case"
"of conditional transfers. It is therefore to provide this much needed relief in the"
"case  of  conditional  transfers  that  this  Amendment  is  brought  to  the  existing"
"Ordinance."
