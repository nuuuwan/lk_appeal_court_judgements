"According  to  exception  1  of  Section  294  of  the  Penal  Code  “Culpable"
"Homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender  whilst  deprived  of  the  power  of  self-"
"control  by  grave  and  sudden  provocation,  causes  the  death  of  the  person"
"who  gave  the  provocation,  or  causes  the  death  of  any  other  person  by"
"mistake or accident”"
"The explanation under this exception read as that “Whether the provocation"
"was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from  amounting  to"
"murder is a question of fact”."
"Although the counsel for the Appellant seeks relief for lesser culpability on"
"the  plea  of  cumulative  provocation,  on  perusal  of  the  evidence  led  before"
"the High Court no evidence of sudden fight elicited either from the evidence"
"of  the  prosecution  nor  was  the  same  suggested  in  the  cross  examination."
"According to Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance it is the responsibility"
"of  the  Appellant  to  prove  the  existence  of  a  general  or  special  exception"
"during  the  trial  on  a  balance  of  probability.    In  the  absence  the  Learned"
"trial  Judge  should  direct  his  mind  to  the  circumstances  and  the  fact  that"
"the Appellant is entitled to have the benefit of the lesser verdict."
