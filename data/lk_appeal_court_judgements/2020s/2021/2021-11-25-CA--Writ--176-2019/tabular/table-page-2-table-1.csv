"Dhammika Ganepola, J."
"The Petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Writ of"
"Certiorari to quash the quit notice issued in terms of the Government Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969, marked as P4 to the Petition. Both"
"parties  agreed  to  get  the  argument  disposed  by  way  of  written  submissions."
"Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several"
"connected  matters  that  were  taken  up  together  with  this  matter.  The  court"
"observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that"
"he  was  an  employee  of  the  Prima  Ceylon  Ltd  and  while  he  was  serving  in"
"Trincomalee, he had been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises at B-15"
"in  Daanyagama  Housing  Scheme,  China  Bay,  Trincomalee  upon  a 
Lease"
"Agreement P2 entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner."
"The Petitioner states that he has fully complied with terms and conditions of the"
"said  agreement.  Later  on,  the  Respondent  had  taken  steps  to  recover  the"
"possession of the said house and accordingly, proceedings had been instituted"
"before the Magistrate’s Court of Trincomalee against the Petitioner in order to"
"recover the possession of the house in issue in terms of the Government Quarters"
"(Recovery  of  Possession)  Act.  Nevertheless,  the  said  action  has  been 
later"
"withdrawn  by  the  Food  Commissioner. Thereafter,  the  Respondent  has  issued"
"the  purported  quit  notice  dated  18.02.2019 
(P4)  against 
the  Petitioner"
"demanding him to hand over the vacant possession of the premises alleging that"
"the  Petitioner  has  acted  in  breach  of  the  Lease  Agreement.  In  spite  of  such"
"circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application to this Court moving for"
"a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice marked P4 stating that the purported"
"quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below."
"i. 
no valid reason has been given and the reasons stated in the said notice"
"are vague"
"ii. 
the  Respondent  has  procured  a  violation  of  the  Lease  Agreement  by"
"refusing to accept the rental payment."
"The Petitioner denies the allegation of violation of terms and conditions of the"
"Lease Agreement referred to in the quit notice. The Petitioner.’s contention is"
"that the Respondent has violated the Lease Agreement."
"It appears that the Petitioner has taken the possession of the premises in issue"
"upon  a  Lease  Agreement marked  P2  to  the  Petition.  The  Lease  Agreement,  in"
"terms  of 
it’s  clause  (iv),  becomes  inoperative  with  effluxion  of  the  time  or"
