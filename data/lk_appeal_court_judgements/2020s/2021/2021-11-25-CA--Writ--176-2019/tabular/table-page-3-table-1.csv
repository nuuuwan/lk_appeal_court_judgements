"petitioner ceased to hold the employment at Prima Ceylon Ltd. The alleged lease"
"period is form 29.09.2014 to 28.09.2015.  There is no evidence of extending the"
"Lease  Agreement  beyond  28.09.2015  or  that  there  is  any  other  valid  Lease"
"Agreement in existence..  Perusal of the Petition of the Petitioner suggests that"
"the  Petitioner  is  no  longer  an  employee  of  Prima  Ceylon  Ltd.  Accordingly,  it"
"appears  that  the  Petitioner  is  solely  basing  his  case  upon  an  expired  Lease"
"Agreement."
"Apart from the above findings, in order to decide as to whether the impugned"
"quit notice is bad in law based on the reasons alleged by the Petitioner, this Court"
"will have to inquire into the fact whether the Petitioner or the Respondent has"
"acted 
in  breach  of 
the 
terms  and  conditions  of 
the 
Lease  Agreement."
"Furthermore, 
the  court  will  have 
to 
take 
into  consideration 
the  alleged"
"contractual  relationship  between  parties.  However,  in  the  case  of  Podinona"
"Urban  Council  Horana  1981  (1)  SLR  141,  it  was  held  that  in  as  much  as  the"
"relationship between the parties was contractual the Petitioner was not entitled"
"to the remedy by way of  Certiorari.  In the case of Ariyaratne vs. the National"
"Insurance Corporation and Others (2003 2 Sri Lr 212) it was held as follows."
