"What is meant by credibility of a witness had been closely examined by the Court of Appeal in"
"Ontario, Canada, in R Vs. Morrissey; (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514, 80 O.A.C. 161 (Ont. C.A.) in which"
"it was held thus;"
"“Testimonial evidence can raise veracity and accuracy concerns. The former relates to"
"the witness’s sincerity, that is, his or her willingness to speak the truth as the witness"
"believes  it  to  be.  The  latter  concerns  relate  to  the  actual  accuracy  of  the  witness’s"
"testimony.  The  accuracy  of  a  witness’s 
testimony 
involves  considerations  of 
the"
"witness’s ability to accurately observe, recall and recount the events in issue. When one"
"is concerned with a witness’s veracity, one speaks of the witness’s credibility. When one"
"is concerned with the accuracy of a witness’s testimony, one speaks of the reliability of"
"that testimony. Obviously, a witness whose evidence on a point is not credible cannot"
"give reliable evidence on that point...”"
"The evidence of PW1 as to the death of the deceased had been consistent with itself during the"
"examination-in-chief  and  cross-examination  and  had  managed  to  fit  in  with  the  versions  of"
"PW6 and PW5. In a similar vein to the above, the evidence of PW5 and PW6 had established"
"the active involvement of the accused-appellants. PW5 testified to the fact that the accused-"
"appellants  together  with  the  first  accused  had  arrived  in  a  three-wheeler  to  the  place  where"
"the offence had been committed and had assaulted him and the deceased. Evidence PW6 had"
"sailed  along  with  the  evidence  of  PW5  in  stating  the  arrival  of  the  accused-appellants  to  the"
"crime  scene  and  their 
involvement 
in  harassing  PW5  and  the  deceased.  Nothing 
in  the"
"testimony of any of the witnesses had indicated insincerity or any reluctance to testify on their"
"part."
"Learned counsel for the respondent in his submission stated that the learned Judge of the High"
"Court had acquitted all four accused on the second charge. It had been observed that PW5 had"
"neither  produced  a  medical  report  nor  had  he  produced  any  evidence  with  regard  to  the"
"injuries  sustained  by  him.  Counsel  for  the  respondent  argued  stating  that,  although  the"
"evidence of PW5 had not contributed in proving the second charge, the law does not prohibit"
"the adoption of his testimony with regard to proof of other material facts."
"In support of the above premise, the reasoning given by the Privy Council in Vadivelu Thevar"
"Vs. The State of Madras, A.I.R. (1957) S.C. 614 can be considered."
"“Generally  speaking,  oral 
testimony 
in 
this  context  may  be  classified 
into 
three"
"categories namely”,"
