"“…fair  trial  obviously  would  mean  a  trial  before  an  impartial  Judge,  a  fair  prosecutor"
"and atmosphere of judicial calm. Fair trial means a trial in which bias or prejudice for or"
"against the accused, the witnesses, or the cause which is being tried is eliminated.”"
"Needless to say, that this right of an accused person to a fair hearing is now being recognized"
"universally by almost every criminal justice system in the world and international instruments"
"starting  with  Magna  Carta 
in  1215  to  other  conventions  and  treaties  such  as  Universal"
"Declaration  on  Human  Rights  since  1948,  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  since  1956"
"and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since 1976."
"With regard to the present matter in question, on perusal of the transcripts of the proceedings"
"in  the  High  Court,  it  is  apparent  that  the  third  accused-appellant  had  been  tried  in  absentia"
"since he had been absconding trial without making any acceptable representation by a counsel."
"The third accused-appellant had failed to state his name in the letter of authorization which is"
"the bare minimum he could have done to represent himself in Court. The learned Judge of the"
"High  Court  had  on  a  subsequent  occasion  had  offered  an  opportunity  for  the  third  accused-"
"appellant  to  prove  the  authenticity  of  the  above  letter,  which  had  not  been  made  avail  of."
"Thereafter, the learned Judge of the High Court had further reinforced his stance after giving"
"reasons for doing so."
"It must be noted that this right of an accused person to defend himself in person or through"
"legal assistance is not absolute and can be waivered by the accused or restricted by Court. It"
"had been held by the European Court of Human Rights through a number of authorities that a"
"waiver  can  be  made  good  provided  that  it  amounts  to  a  ‘knowing  and  intelligent  waiver’;"
"Ibrahim and Others Vs. United Kingdom (Applications no 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and"
"40351/09)."
"In  the  case  of  the  third  accused-appellant, 
it 
is  evident  that  he  had  been  spending  time"
"overseas  absconding  trial  and  had  failed  to  give  adequate 
instructions  to  his  counsel  to"
"represent  him  at  the  trial.  Such  actions  tantamount  to  knowing  and  intelligent  waiver  of  his"
"rights.  Therefore,  no  error  had  been  committed  by  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  in"
"rejecting  a  letter  of  authorization  having  regard  to  the  overall  fairness  of  the  hearing,  which"
"had failed to provide clear representation of the third accused-appellant."
"On  this  question  relating  to  the  right  of  an  accused  to  a  fair  trial,  words  of  Siva  Selliah  J  in"
"Sudharman De Silva and Another Vs. Attorney General 1985 (2) SLR 12 is worth mentioning."
"“It 
is  my  considered  view 
that  rights  cannot  exist 
in  a  watertight  compartment"
"independently  of  duties  which  are  enjoined  by  the  law.  In  construing  rights  this  court"
"cannot throw into jeopardy the entire fabric and administration of law and justice, nor"
"can it condone or encourage accused persons who choose to be fugitives from justice"
"seeking to invoke the law only when it suits their advantage. Fundamental concepts and"
"duties  must  be  preserved  at  all  costs  and  one  such  fundamental  concept  is  that  the"
"appellant  must  submit  to  the  law  and  the  courts  and  not  abscond  from  them.  Rights"
"cannot  be  separated  from  duties  enjoined  by  the  law  as  to  do  so  would  lead  to  a"
"disruption of the Rule of Law and the Administration of Justice.”"
