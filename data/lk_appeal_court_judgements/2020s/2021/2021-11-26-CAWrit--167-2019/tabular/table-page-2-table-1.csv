"The Petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Writ of"
"Certiorari to quash the quit notice issued in terms of the Government Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969, marked as P4 to the Petition. Both"
"parties  agreed  to  get  the  argument  disposed  by  way  of  written  submissions."
"Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several"
"connected  matters  that  were  taken  up  together  with  this  matter.  The  court"
"observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that"
"he was an employee of the Prima Ceylon Ltd and that he retired from his service"
"eight months ago. The Petitioner states that he has been granted a tenancy in"
"respect  of  the  premises  at  B-43  in  Daanyagama  Housing  Scheme,  China  Bay,"
"Trincomalee  upon  a  Lease  Agreement  has  been  entered 
into  between  the"
"Petitioner and the Food Commissioner. Nevertheless, only a copy of a renewal"
"rent agreement (marked as P3) of the said agreement entered into between the"
"Petitioner  and  the  Food  Commissioner  has  been  tendered  along  with  the"
"Petition. Although the Petitioner has failed to produce the copy of the original"
"Lease Agreement referred to in said P3, he states that he has fully complied with"
"terms  and  conditions  of  the  said  agreement 
including  the  payment  of  the"
"monthly  rental.  The  Petitioner 
further  states  that  there  had  been  several"
"attempts to recover the possession of the premises by the Respondent.  Later on,"
"the  Petitioner  has  been  served  with  a  quit  notice  in  term  of  the  Government"
"Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.03 of 1971, dated 18th February 2019"
"(P4) against the Petitioner demanding him to hand over  the premises  alleging"
"that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the terms of the said Lease Agreement."
"In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application moving"
"for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  quit  notice  marked  P4  stating  that  the"
"purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below."
