"Judge had considered all the material evidence that had been led before him at the trial by both"
"parties."
"A
 Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the finding of a trial Judge with regard to the acceptance"
"or rejection of testimony of a witness unless it is manifestly wrong. The Privy Council in Fradd V."
"Brown & Company Ltd. 20 N.L.R, at page 282 held as follows: -"
"â€œIt is rare that a decision of a judge so express, so explicit upon a point of fact purely is over"
"ruled  by  a  Court  of  Appeal,  because  the  Courts  of  Appeals  recognize  the  priceless"
"advantage which a judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with"
"any judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or from narrative of those"
"who were present. It is very rare that, in questions of veracity so direct and so specific as"
"these, a Court of Appeal will over-rule a judge of first instance."""
"In  conclusion, for those reasons  stated  above,  I hold that the  accused-appellant  had  failed to"
"satisfy this court on any ground urged on his behalf that a miscarriage of justice had occurred."
"T
herefore, I dismiss the appeal of the accused-appellant and affirm the conviction and sentence"
"dated 07-08-2013. by the High Court Judge of Badulla."
