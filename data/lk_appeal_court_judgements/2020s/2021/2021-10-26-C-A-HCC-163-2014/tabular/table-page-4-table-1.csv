"neighbour  of  the  two  deceased.    The  appellant  and  the  deceased  had  a"
"land  dispute.    The  appellant  had  taken  up  the  defence  of  alibi  that  he"
"was at Gampola at the time of the incident.   In the evening of the 3rd of"
"May  2006,  both  deceased  were  killed.  The  son  and  daughter  of  the"
"deceased, PW1 and PW2, respectively, are eyewitnesses to the murder of"
"their mother. PW1  was 11 years old,  and PW2  was 15 years old at that"
"time.  PW1 and PW2 had given their statements to the police within three"
"or four hours after the incident that same evening."
"In 
the  appeal, 
the  main  ground  advanced  by 
the  counsel 
for 
the"
"appellant  is  that  the  Trial  Judge  had  violated  the  rules  governing  the"
"calling of fresh witnesses after the case for the defense had been closed,"
"which  was  prejudicial  to  the  appellant  and  amounts  to  a  miscarriage  of"
"justice."
"The  next  argument  is  that  there  was  no  sufficient  light  at  the  time  and"
"the  place  of  the  incident,  and  the  evidence  of  PW1  and  PW2  cannot  be"
"relied upon."
"PW1  is  an  eyewitness  to  the  murder  of  the  female  deceased.    He  had"
"given evidence that the appellant had attacked his mother and fled from"
"the  scene.    PW1  had  given  a  statement  to  the  police  within  few  hours"
"after 
the 
incident. 
  He  was  only  11  years  old  at 
that 
time.  No"
"contradiction had been marked.  The only point marked as an omission"
"is  that  a  person  known  as  “Chathu  Akka”  informed  his  mother  or  his"
"sister.  However,  the  fact  that  “Chathu  Akka”  told  that  his  father  had"
"been attacked was an unshaken fact that led them to run towards where"
"the male deceased was attacked.  PW1 and PW2 had stated that the bulb"
"at  their  main  door  was  switched  on,  and  there  was  sufficient  light  near"
"the gate to identify the assailant.  PW1 had stood by what he had stated"
"to the police on the day of the incident.  He was an eleven-year-old boy,"
"and his mother and father were murdered three or four hours before, so"
