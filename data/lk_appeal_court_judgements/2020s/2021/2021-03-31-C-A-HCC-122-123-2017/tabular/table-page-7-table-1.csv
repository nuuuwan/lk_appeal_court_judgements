"The prosecutrixâ€™s position was that she was unconscious when she reached"
"near  the  bunt  and  unable  to  say  how  she  had  come  to  the  hospital.  The"
"police officer who first met the prosecutrix near the bunt had categorically"
"said  that  he  had  spoken  to  her  at  that  time  and  after  inquiry  he  had  got"
"down her husband and handed her over to him to be sent to the hospital."
"Further  the  officer  had  said  when  he  first  saw  the  prosecutrix  she  was"
"wearing  a  red  coloured  blouse  without  buttons  and  a  black  coloured"
"underskirt."
"As PW04, the husband of the prosecutrix had passed away before the High"
"Court trial, his evidence given in the non-summary inquiry was marked as"
"P4  under  Section  33  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance.  In  his  evidence  he  had"
"said that when he saw his wife no clothes were found on her body except a"
"blue coloured clothe that had been put over her body. His evidence is fully"
"corroborated by PW03 the son of the prosecutrix."
"PW03 in his evidence said that he could speak to his mother only after two"
"days of the incident. In his evidence nowhere he mentioned that his mother"
"had told him about rape committed by the Appellants on her. According to"
"him  the  prosecutrix  had  only  told  him  that  the  Appellants  had  abducted"
"her,  kept  on  a  rock  in  the  Wilpattu  jungle  and  she  escaped  from  their"
"custody when the Appellants had fallen asleep. In his evidence, marked as"
"P04, the husband of the prosecutrix too had not mentioned about the rape"
"incident."
"The  appeal  grounds  2nd  and  4th  are  considered 
together  as 
they  are"
"connected to medical evidence. In those grounds the Appellants contented"
"that the learned trial judge has failed to consider that the testimony of the"
"doctor  who 
is  an 
independent  witness  contradicts  the  evidence  of  the"
"prosecutrix  and  has  failed  to  consider  the  medical  evidence  in  the  correct"
"perspective."
