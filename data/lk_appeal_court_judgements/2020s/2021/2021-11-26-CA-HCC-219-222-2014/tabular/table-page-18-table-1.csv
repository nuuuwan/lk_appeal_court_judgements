"According to the evidence of the eyewitness Basil it is manifest that the accused persons who have"
"been convicted by the learned trial judge, in this case, had committed the criminal acts together."
"They had committed those in furtherance of the common intention of all. Unlike the rest, the  05th"
"accused who stood the trial had tried to stop and prevent the others from committing further crimes."
