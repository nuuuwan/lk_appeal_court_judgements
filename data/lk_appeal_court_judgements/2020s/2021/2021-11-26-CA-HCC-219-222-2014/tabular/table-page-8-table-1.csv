"what witness Dilrukshi had seen. It might therefore be a possibility for Khuram to have moved away"
"from the poolside to the grass level and this corroborates the observation by witness Dilrukshi."
"Witness Basil observed Victoria wailing over her boyfriend fallen on the ground face downwards. At"
"that  point,  she  was  subjected to  assault  by one of  the  accused persons  in  a  beastly  manner.  The"
"Appellant had joined within seconds with a burning piece of firewood and attacked the back of the"
"chest  of  Victoria  until  the  piece  of  firewood  burnt  out  completely.  The  eyewitnesses  Dilrukshi,"
"Victoria  and  Basil had testified,  there  had  been a  bonfire  in the  front  area.  The drag  mark  of the"
"firewood from the point of the bonfire up to the place where Victoria had been with Khuram, was"
"observed by the SOCO officer. It was above 35 meters."
"There had been a large patch of blood on the grass in the area where the chalets were situated. From"
"the same point, the SOCO officer also recovered the remnants of burnt firewood. The testimony of"
"witness Basil that the appellant used a burning piece of firewood to assault Victoria mercilessly is"
"corroborated  by  the  drag  mark  observed  by  SOCO  officer  and  by  witness  SI  Jayasinghe  who  took"
"charge of a burnt piece of firewood, a little away from the entrance to the hotel. This burnt piece of"
"firewood had been 15.5 inches long and 8.5 inches wide, marked as 'X 16'."
"It is evident that the gruesome acts of the accused persons could no longer be watched by Basil and"
"he, therefore, moved away from the location to his room. Basil had been shocked by what he had"
"seen, according to his testimony. It was also the position of Basil that with the state of mind he had,"
"he could not stay in the room for long and therefore he went towards the car park which was about"
"50 -60 meters away from his room. At that moment he became a witness to the vandalism of hotel"
"property including the vehicles in the car park."
"A waiter who came up to Basil had pleaded saying “බුදු මහත්තපෙෝ සුද්ද ඉවරයි. සුදු මහත්තො ඉවරයි. අපි"
"එොව ඉකමෙට පහාසපපිටල් එකට අරන ෙමු.”"
"As Basil did not have the vehicle key, he had gone to his room to collect it. He had taken about 2 -3"
"minutes to return with the key."
"However, he had been unable to take the vehicle out as a van with its engine running was parked in"
"front of the entrance to the lobby area had blocked the way. He had seen some of the members of"
"the unlawful assembly damaging a trishaw parked near that van. A man clads in a white sarong and"
"a shirt standing near the van, had ordered those accused to “සුද්දිව ඇදල ගනින. ඕක ෙතර කරල.”  At"
"the Identification Parade when Basil’s memory was fresh, he had given a descriptive account of the"
"reason to have identified the accused person."
