 am of the view that the decision of the 4th Respondent to proceed on the basis of a"
"vacancy  in  the  office  of  Chairman  of  the  1st  Respondent  is  in  terms  of  the  law.  As"
"provided  by  Section  19(6)  of  the  Ordinance,  where  there  is  a  vacancy,  the  Vice-"
"Chairman  may  exercise,  discharge  and  perform  the  same  powers,  functions  and"

"initiated by him in terms of Section 66G of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance"
"to fill such vacancy."
