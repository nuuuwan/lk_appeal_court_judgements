"he Supreme Court held as follows:"
"“I am content to hold that the requirements of Rule 46 must be complied with,"
"but that strict or absolute compliance  is not essential;  it  is sufficient if  there is"
"compliance  which  is  “substantial”  -  this  being  judged  in  the  light  of  the  object"
"and purpose of the Rule. It is not to be mechanically applied, as in the case now"
"before us; the Court should first have determined whether the default had been"
"satisfactorily explained, or cured subsequently without unreasonable delay, and"
"then have exercised a judicial discretion either to excuse the non-compliance, or"
"to impose a sanction; dismissal was not the only sanction. That discretion should"
"have been exercised primarily by reference to the purpose of the Rules, and not"
"as a means of punishing the defaulter.”25"
