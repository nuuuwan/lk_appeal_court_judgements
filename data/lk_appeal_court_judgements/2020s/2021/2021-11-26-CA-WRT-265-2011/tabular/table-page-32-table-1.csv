"explained further clarifications were sought from Professor A. H.  Sheriff Deen, Professor Anoja"
"Fernando and Dr. L. Panangala."
"If  the  decision  to  dissolve  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  was  to  be  considered  at  the  Faculty"
"Board  meeting  the  aggrieved  parties  should  have  been  given  appropriate  notice  to  defend"
"themselves 
in  respect  of  unfounded  allegations  which  has  serious  repercussions  on  their"
"competence and integrity. The Petitioner states that the failure to do so violates the rules of"
"natural justice."
"The Petitioner states that the University of Kelaniya is an institution where medical research is"
"conducted  by  academic  staff  members  who  are  mostly  Medical  Practitioners.  Therefore,  if"
"acceptable research is to be conducted, it is a sine qua non that an Ethics Review Committee"
"should be in existence and ethical clearance be obtained. To satisfy this requirement an Ethics"
"Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kelaniya was set up in terms"
"of Section 48(3) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. The Conduct of the Doctors in Sri Lanka"
"is regulated by the Medical Ordinance of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and to ensure that the"
"Medical  Practitioners  adhere  to  the  law,  the  Sri  Lanka  Medical  Council  has  been  set  up  by"
"Statute. The Medical Council has formulated guidelines as to how research should be done by"
"doctors using human subjects."
"Concerns about the ethics of the practice of medicine have a long history. But until the middle"
"of  this  century,  they  were  mostly  centred  around  the  practice  of  therapeutic  medicine,  not"
"research medicine. In 1946, there were 23 Nazi Physicians who went on trial at Nuremberg for"
"crimes  committed  against  prisoners  of  war.  These  crimes  included  exposure  of  humans  to"
"extremes of temperature, the performance of mutilating surgery, and deliberate infection with"
"a variety of lethal pathogens. During the trial, fundamental ethical standards for the conduct of"
"research 
involving  humans  were  codified 
into  the  Nuremberg  Code,  which  set  forth  10"
"conditions  that  must  be  met  to 
justify  research 
involving  human  subjects.  The  two  most"
"important 
conditions  were 
the  need 
for  voluntary 
informed 
consent  of 
subjects  and"
"scientifically valid research designs that could produce fruitful results for the good of society."
"The  World  Health  Organization  recognized  a  need  for  guidelines  that  were  broader  in  scope"
"than the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki. Recommendations Guiding Medical"
"Doctors in Biomedical Research involving Human Subjects was adopted by the World Medical"
"Association in 1964. These guidelines have been revised several times, most recently in 1989,"
"and currently are in use throughout. the world."
"Thus, there arose the necessity while researching for the development of medicine also to take"
"into  consideration the  safety  and well-being  of the human  beings  subjected to  research.  The"
"mechanism of balancing these two countervailing policy considerations was the establishment"
"of  Ethics  Review  Committees 
in  all 
institutions  doing  research  using  human  subjects  and"
"making  it  compulsory  to  obtain  ethical  clearance  from  such  committees.  The  importance  of"
"these  Ethics  Review  Committees  cannot  be  underestimated.  Because  for  the  sake  of  money"
"given by Pharmaceutical Companies the safety of the vulnerable section of the society who are"
"used  for  research  projects  would  be  at  stake.  They  are  the  voiceless  persons  from  whom"
"sometimes informed consent for using them in research is not properly obtained."
