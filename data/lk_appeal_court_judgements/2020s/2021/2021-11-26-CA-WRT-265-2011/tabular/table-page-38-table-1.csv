"Supreme court of India held in State of Madhya Pradesh vs G. C. Mandawar 1955 SCR 158 that"
"the  applicant  must  have  a  legal  right  to  compel  the  performance  of  some  duty  cast  on  the"
"opponent by The Constitution or any other statute. And the duty must possess three qualities;"
"1)  Duty must be of Public Nature"
"2)  Must not be a discretionary one"
"3)  And  duty  if  discretionary  then  the  power  must  have  been  conferred  by  the  authority"
"and statutory provisions are made for it."
"It is important to note that a Writ of Mandamus will not lie against a private individual or any"
"private company"
"In the case of Pragya Tools Corporation v C.A. Immanuel 1969 SCR (3) 773, Justice Shelat held"
"that an application for mandamus will not lie for an order of reinstatement to an office which is"
"essential  of  a  private  character,  nor  can  such  an  application  be  maintained 
to  secure"
"performance of an obligation owed by a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956"
"towards its workmen or to resolve any private dispute."
"Court  held  that  if  a  writ  of  mandamus  could  not  lie  against  a  company  which  is  neither  a"
"statutory  company  nor  one  having  public  duties  or  responsibilities 
imposed  upon 
it  by  a"
"statute, no relief could also be given by granting a declaration on the court of the agreement"
"between the company and its workman being illegal."
"For issuance of a writ of mandamus, one of the essential requirements is that there must be a"
"demand  by  the  person  seeking  relief  and  the  same  demand  must  have  been  refused  by  the"
"concerned authority."
"In “Halsbury’s Law of England” it is stated that;"
"As a general rule party seeking a writ of mandamus must know that what was the actual"
"requirement, for considering whether or not he should comply, and it must be proved"
"by evidence that the demand was distinct by the part and that demand is met with a"
"refusal,  therefore,  the  prerequisite  for  mandamus 
is  the  acknowledgement  of  the"
"person seeking mandamus is must, about what he was required to do."
"The writ of mandamus is not a writ of right and a person invoking the special jurisdiction of the"
"court, for the extraordinary remedy by way of a writ was required to be diligent. Therefore, it"
"was held in Kamini Kumar Das Chaudhary v State of West Bengal 1973 SCR (1) 718 that the writ"
"of mandamus is a discretionary writ and the charges against the petitioner was such that even"
"if he shows any technical flaw then also one would refuse to interfere."
"Mendis V Seema Sahitha Panadura Janatha Santhaka Pravahana Sevaya 1995 (2) SLR 284, held"
"that it is in this context that the view has been firmly held that relationships that are based on"
"contract, without anti statutory underpinning and actions of companies and private individuals"
"and bodies, are not subject to judicial review by way of the Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition."
"In the case of Weligama Multipurpose Co-operative Society Ltd. v.Chandradasa Daluwatta 1984"
"(1)  SLR  195,  where  the  petitioner-respondent,  the  Manager  of  the  appellant  society,  was"
"interdicted  and  served  with  a  charge  sheet,  sought  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  to  compel  the"
"appellant society to pay him half a month's salary after the sixth month of interdiction in terms"
