"(
f)  At the meeting held on 18.01.2011, Dr. Nirmala Wijekoon, who was the Secretary of"
"the said Ethics Review Committee, had resigned from the said post and Committee."
"As  of 18.01.2011,  four members of the  Ethics Review  Committee  had resigned  from  the  said"
"Committee chaired by the petitioner. They were Dr. Nirmala Wijekoon, Prof. Arjuna De Silva,"
"Dr.  R.  Hasan  and  Prof.  Hewavisenthi.  The  said  Committee  was  dissolved  because  of  the"
"complaints that were received of how the said committee was functioning and because of the"
"spate of resignations that occurred."
"On  20.01.2011,  the  Management  Committee  and petitioner  were  apprised of  the  decision  to"
"dissolve the said Committee and the reasons for doing so and of the appointment of the new"
"Committee.  The  Faculty  Board  was 
informed  of  the  said  decision  and  that  decision  was"
"approved by the Faculty Board. The Ethics Review Committee had approved the said proposed"
"research  subject  to  the  observations  made 
in  that  regard,  following  the  Guidelines.  Such"
"research  projects  have  received  approval 
from  regulatory  authorities  and  Ethics  Review"
"Committees in many countries including the USA, UK and European countries. The Guidelines"
"are based on the Guidelines introduced in the aforementioned countries."
"These  Respondents  state  that  they  have  acted 
in  good  faith  and 
in  compliance  with  the"
"relevant provisions contained in the Universities Act and Ethics Review Committee Guidelines."
"The application of the Petitioner seeking Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is misconceived in"
"law  and  ought  to  be  dismissed  and  in  any  event,  the  Petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  the  relief"
"prayed therein."
"The  Petitioner  has  gone  through  the  objections  filed  by  all  the  Respondents  and  decided  to"
"reply  by  filling  a  counter  objection  by  an  affidavit  on  30.03.2012.  She  has  denied  all  and"
"singular the  several  averments  contained therein,  except  those that  are specifically  admitted"
"by  her.    The  main  contention  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  Statements  of  Objections  filed  on"
"behalf  of  the  04th,  06th,  07th,  09th,  10th,  11th,  13th,  15th,  16th,  18th,  19th  to  23rd,  25th,  28th,31st,"
"32nd, 33rd, 36th to 43rd, 45th, 46th, 47th, 49th to 53rd, 54th, 55th, 60th,61st, 63rd Respondents were"
"not supported by Affidavits and therefore not by the Supreme Court Rules and Therefore the"
"objections filed by those Respondents should be rejected in limine."
"The Petitioner states that the Statement of Objections filed on behalf of the 59th Respondent"
"was not supported by an Affidavit when the said Objections were tendered to this Court but"
"subsequently  on  14.03.2012  the  59th  Respondent  submitted  an  affidavit  to  this  Court  and"
"therefore the statement of objections, is not in compliance with the Supreme Court Rules and"
"should be rejected. Not only that, when this application was mentioned on 21.02.2012 in this"
"Court, the counsel appearing for the 18th, 24th, 26th and 31st Respondents stated that they will"
"be filing their Objections on or before 28.02.2012. But contrary to the undertaking given to this"
"Court and without permission from this Court the said Respondents have filed their Objections"
