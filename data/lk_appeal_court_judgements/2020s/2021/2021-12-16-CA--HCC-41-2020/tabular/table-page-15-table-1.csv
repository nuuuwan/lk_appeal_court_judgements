"analysis of evidence, the appellant has placed confidence in the whimsical verbal evidence of"
"the present manager of the company, who testified about the existence of a second contract"
"between the company in question and the 5th accused. However, no copy of this contract has"
"been submitted to Court, reducing the evidentiary value of the appellant's case even further."
"Thus, it was further argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that the appellant had"
"not put forward the best evidence to support his case. Therefore, he cannot now be heard to"
"say that he has given ""acceptable evidence"" at the vehicle inquiry. He has failed to surmount"
"even the low evidentiary threshold of ""beyond reasonable doubt""."
"In Piyadasa Prathapasinghe vs Attorney General & Others [CA(PHC) 154/2013] it was held that"
"the failure to call a material witness was to be fatal to the case of the Claimant:"
"""The  appellant  has  failed  to  call  Laksman  as  a  witness.  Apart  from  the  appellant,"
"Lakshman  would  have  been  the  best  person  to  testify  about  the  precautions  the"
"appellant had taken. The burden is on the appellant to satisfy Court that he took all"
"necessary  precautions  to  prevent  the  commission  of  the  offence, 
I  am  of  the"
"considered view that the learned High Court Judge was correct when he found that"
"the  appellant  had  failed  to  prove  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court  that  he  took"
"necessary  precautions  to  prevent  the  commission  of  the  offence  on  the  day 
in"
"question and that the order of the learned Magistrate should be affirmed."""
"In Segu Alawdeen Mohamadu Riyaldeen vs Attorney General & Others [CA (PHC) 164/ 2026],"
"it was decided that the failure to call the driver and another material corroborating witness"
"has been fatal to the application of the claimant."
"Learned counsel for the respondent citing the above-mentioned authority says that in this"
"instance the appellant has failed to call the driver to give evidence, although the  appellant"
"later said that his wife inspected the vehicle, he had failed to call the wife  on his behalf to"
"establish  the  same.  The  appellant  has  failed  to  discharge  the  burden  cast  upon  him."
"Therefore,  by  not  placing  the  best  evidence  to  confirm  and  corroborate  his  version,  the"
"appellant has virtually initiated the ""self-destruction"" of his case."
"It was argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that the appellant has not discharged"
"his  burden  of  proving  either  “lack  of  knowledge  of  the  offence”  or  that  “he  indeed  took"
"necessary precautions to prevent his vehicle being used for an illegal act” by the 5th accused."
"The  failure  of  the  appellant  to  discharge  this  burden  has  to  be  analysed  considering  the"
"following authorities."
"In A.H. Mithrasena Vs OIC - Police Station, Hettipola CA/PHC/15/2016, it was held that mere"
"instructions given to a tractor driver not to use the vehicle for unlawful activities was deemed"
"insufficient by the Court of Appeal, as having fulfilled the above burden."
"It  was  held 
in  Mary  Matilda  Silva  Vs  P.H.  De  Silva  CA  /PHC/86/97,  that  giving  ""mere"
"instructions"" is not sufficient to discharge the said burden."
"The  same  position 
is 
taken  up 
in  Saman  Kumara  and  another  Vs  Attorney  General"
"CA/PHC/157/12,  where  it  was  held  that  mere  verbal  instructions  were  not  sufficient  to"
"discharge the burden."
