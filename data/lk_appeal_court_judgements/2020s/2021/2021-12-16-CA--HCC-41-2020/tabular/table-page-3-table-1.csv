"proper naming of the respondents should involve all concerned parties including"
"the 5 accused who stood trial and pleaded to the indictment in the original case."
"I
t was argued that this is quite apparent when considering a proper petition as the one that"
"was  filed  in  A.H.  Mithrasena  Vs  OIC  Hettipola  and  Others  CA/PHC/15/2016  decided  on"
"20.10.2020, in which case, quite correctly, the relevant accused was named as a respondent"
"to the petition."
"Similarly, in this case, since the contention of the appellant is mainly against the 5th accused"
"and the fact that the 5th accused did not use the said vehicle by the instructions and the wishes"
"of the appellant, it is imperative that at least the 5th accused should have been named as a"
"party to this instant appeal. The learned counsel for the respondent further says that without"
"fulfilling these grounds: naming the proper and most essential respondents, it may be seen"
"that the petition is once more deficient. This is especially so, since the Attorney General being"
"the only named respondent, has no personal knowledge nor claim whatsoever regarding any"
"of the averments concerning the use of the impugned vehicle by the 5th accused and any of"
"the other accused during the incident concerning the indictment of the High Court and since"
"the 5th accused and other accused have been left out of the evidentiary process at the trial in"
"the High Court."
