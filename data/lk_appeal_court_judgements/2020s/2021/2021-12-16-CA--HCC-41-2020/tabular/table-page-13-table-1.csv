"(iii.)","The learned Provincial High Court Judge erred in law and fact to confiscate the"
"","vehicle when he had given acceptable evidence to prove that he had taken all"
"","pragmatic  precautions  to  prevent  the  commission  of  the  offence  using  the"
"","vehicle."
"(iv.)","Confiscating the vehicle is not reasonable, just and equitable and it is a violation"
"","of his human rights."
"The respondent proceeded to reply to the said four matters highlighted from (i) to (iv) above,",""
"and says that confiscating the vehicle is bad in law where there is no charge or evidence to",""
"show that the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence. The respondent states",""
"that  there","is  prima-facia  material  to  show  that  the  vehicle  was  taken 
into  custody 
in"
"connection with the offence. It is apparent that during investigations the impugned vehicle",""
"was taken into custody by police regarding this offence,",""
"The impugned vehicle is listed as a production at the back of the Indictment to which the 5th",""
"accused pleaded. The appellant has not at any point contested this position during evidence",""
"at the vehicle inquiry in the High Court. The appellant has not provided an explanation of how",""
"his  vehicle  suddenly  went  missing  after  it  was  rented  to  the  company  in  question  until  a",""
"vehicle inquiry was initiated at the High Court by the appellant himself in a case of possession",""
"and trafficking of cannabis.",""
"The  appellant  denies  having  any  knowledge  that  the  impugned  vehicle  was  used  for  the",""
"commission of the offence and says that confiscating the vehicle is bad in law and fact when",""
"there  is  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  knowledge  of  the  crime  and  he  has  given",""
"reasonable and acceptable explanations as to the fact that he did not have any knowledge",""
"about this culpable act.",""
"It is important to note that confiscating the vehicle is entirely in keeping with the legislation",""
"and fact, as that legislature verily intended. The legislation states that the Court shall order",""
"forfeiture. Section 79 (as amended) of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance,",""
"No. 13 of 1984 states that:",""
"","""Where any person is convicted of an offence against this Ordinance or any regulation"
"","made thereunder the court shall order that all or any articles in respect of which the"
"","offence  was  committed  and  any  boat,  vessel,  vehicle,  aircraft  or  airborne  craft  or"
"","equipment which has been used for the conveyance of such article shall, by reason of"
"","such conviction, be forfeited to the State"""
"Therefore, it is contended that irrespective of an inquiry, the position of the law on forfeiture",""
"was automatic. The instant law does not even provide for the holding of an inquiry as opposed",""
"to, for example, the Forest Ordinance which provides for an application being made by a 3rd",""
"party for a vehicle. This then was the prima-facia express intent of the legislature until the",""
"case of ""Manawadu vs AG 1987 [2] SLR 3O"" was decided.",""
"It was argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that, there is no onus in law for the",""
"prosecution to prove that the owner had sufficient knowledge of the use of his vehicle in the",""
"crime at a vehicle inquiry. It is only incumbent on the  appellant, that too at his option, for",""
"want of redeeming the vehicle, to prove, albeit to the ""balance of probability"", that he had",""
"no  knowledge  that  his  vehicle  had  been  used  to  commit  the  offence  in  question.  This",""
