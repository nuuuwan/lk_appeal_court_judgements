"prove that the appellant had taken all pragmatic precautions to prevent the commission of"
"the offence using the vehicle."
"Therefore, it is my view that confiscating the vehicle bearing registration number WP KD-9832"
"is not reasonable, just and equitable and it is a violation of his right."
"For the reasons set out above, I conclude that the learned High Court Judge had misdirected"
"himself by failing to evaluate the said material in favour of the petitioner. I, therefore, decide"
"to set aside the order by the High Court Judge of Monaragala, dated 24.04.2020, and released"
"the said vehicle to the Petitioner."
"Appeal allowed."
