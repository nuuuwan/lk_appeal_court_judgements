"vehicle is bad in law when the appellant has given reasonable and acceptable explanations as"
"to that he did not have any knowledge about this culpable act."
"Section 103 of the Evidence Ordinance stipulates that ""the burden of proof as to any particular"
"fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence unless it is provided"
"by any law that the proof of the fact shall lie on any particular person"". In terms of Section"
"103, since the respondent has raised issues disputing that the appellant knew this culpable"
"act,  the  respondent  who  wishes  the  court  to  believe  the  existence  of  that  fact  hence  the"
"burden of proof lies on the respondent to prove that the appellant had the knowledge that"
"the vehicle had been used for the commission of the offence with his knowledge. The learned"
"State  Counsel  has  not  even  suggested  to  any  of  the  witnesses,  at  the  inquiry  that  the"
"commission of the crime was committed with the knowledge of the appellant."
"The appellant stated giving evidence that he and the driver, Kelum Darshana who was the 5th"
"accused of the original case are not acquainted and therefore he inquired about him because"
"it  came  to  his  knowledge  that  the  vehicle  is  going  to  be  handed  over  to  the  said  Kelum"
"Dharshana. The police have not investigated whether the  appellant had any connection or"
"knowledge regarding the said allegation which was committed by the accused. The appellant"
"was not indicted before the Provincial High Court of Monaragala about the said allegation or"
"even for abatement."
"If the evidence of the appellant which had been led before the Provincial High Court was duly"
"considered it would be apparent that the vehicle has been used for the commission of the"
"offence without his knowledge."
