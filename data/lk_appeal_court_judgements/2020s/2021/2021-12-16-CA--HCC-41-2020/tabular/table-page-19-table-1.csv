"In the case of Sarwan Singh vs. State of Punjab 2002 AIR SC iii at 3652 Indian Supreme Court"
"held thus;"
"""It  is  a  rule  of  essential  justice  that  whenever  the  opponent  has  declined  to  avail"
"himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination it must follow that the"
"evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted."""
"This judgment was cited with approval in Bobby Mathew vs. State of Karnataka 2004 Cr. LJ"
"3003."
"“Applying  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  above  judicial  decision  may  express  the"
"following view. Failure to suggest the defence of alibi to the prosecution witnesses"
"who implicated the accused indicates that it was a false one.”"
"The learned Trial Judge has not given reasons for the aforementioned finding in confiscating"
"the vehicle and as submitted that the indirect finding of the learned Judge to the effect that"
"the said crime was committed with the knowledge of the appellant, cannot stand in law and"
"fact."
"The vehicle cannot be confiscated firstly; hence there was no evidence before Court to show"
"that the vehicle was used for the commission of the offence, secondly; even if one was to"
"assume that there was such evidence, as there was clear evidence to show the commission"
"of  the  offence  committed  without  the  knowledge  of  the  appellant.  Thus,  it  is  argued  that"
"there was no need for the appellant, according to law to establish a balance of probability to"
"show that he took steps reasonably to prevent the commission of an offence using the vehicle."
"The monitoring of the vehicle for 24 hours on all 7 days after the renting out lies beyond the"
"sphere of responsibility of the owner of the vehicle and also frequently inquiring about the"
"vehicle which is lent on a rent basis is not practical. It is submitted while trying to define the"
"law that no one should and can expect such control over a vehicle; in that event, it would"
"become impossible for anyone to rent or lease a vehicle."
"It is not practical to rent a vehicle solely on the conditions of the vehicle owner due to the"
"lack of bargaining power of the owner of the vehicle. In the instant case, the appellant had"
"given evidence and had stated that the contract that was signed was a formal contract that"
"was used by Ashan Enterprises. It is unfair to accept a person like the appellant who owns one"
