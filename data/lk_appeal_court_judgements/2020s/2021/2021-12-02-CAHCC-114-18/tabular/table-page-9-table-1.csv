"In  Edrick  De  Silva  Vs  Chandradasa  De  Silva  70  NLR  at  170  Justice"
"H.N.G. Fernando observed that when there is ample opportunity to contradict the"
"evidence  of a witness but is  not impugned or assailed in cross examination that"
"is a special fact and feature in the case, it is a matter falling within the definition"
"of the word “proof” in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance and a trial judge or"
"court  must  necessarily  take  fact  in  to  consideration  in  adjudication  the  issue"
"before it."
