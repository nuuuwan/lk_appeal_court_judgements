"A
s stated in Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka:20"
"“
To perform a merely ministerial act is not “to determine questions” affecting a"
"party, and certiorari does not issue to quash a mere ministerial act."
"T
he  phrase  “to  determine  questions”  earlier  meant  “to  exercise  power”  by"
"changing the legal position or legal relations of parties; from more recently, that"
"phrase also means, “by otherwise adversely affecting them” by coming to adverse"
"findings of fact or expressing adverse opinions. It is important to emphasise that"
"the phrase does not include any ministerial act because a ministerial act contains"
"no “determination” affecting anyone.”"
"I
 am therefore of the view that a distinction can be drawn between situations where"
"the  public  authority  is  required  to  make  a  judgment  as  opposed  to  merely  being"
"obedient to instructions."
"A
pplication of the Ministerial duty"
"I
t is clear that the above argument of the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General"
"involves  the  consideration  of  three  provisions  of 
law,  namely  Article  89(d)  read"
"together with Article 91(1)(a), Article 66(d) and Section 64(1)(c) of the Act."
"I
t is also clear that the above three provisions involve two tiers of action or two stages"
"in one process, namely:"
"(
a) 
A  determination  by  the  Secretary  General  that  an  event  has  occurred  that"
"triggers the disqualification set out in Article 89(d); and"
"(
b)  
The  communication  of  such  determination  by  the  Secretary  General  to  the"
"Election Commission."
