"Petitioner and the Food Commissioner in 1989. However, the Petitioner claims"
"that  she  does  not  hold  a  copy  of  the  said  agreement.  In  lieu  of  the  same  the"

"Petition and has claimed that conditions included in the said agreement P2 are"
"identical to that of the agreement entered into by the Petitioner in 1989. Despite,"
"Petitioner’s failure to produce before this Court a copy of the said agreement,"
"the Petitioner states that he has complied with all terms and conditions of the"
"said  agreement.  There  had  been  several  attempts  on  the  part  of  the  Food"
