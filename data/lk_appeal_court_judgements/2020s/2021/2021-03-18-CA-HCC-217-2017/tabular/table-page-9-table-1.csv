"At  this  point,  the  Trial  Judge  had  stopped  further  questioning  on"
"the  same point.  Although  this is not a  significant contradiction,  the"
"learned Trial Judge should have allowed  the defence  to  ask why he"
"had said so in examination in chief."
"When  PW2  and  the  Informant  went  to  the  accused's  house,  there"
"were no lights on and there was no  sign that anyone was inside the"
"house.  When the police  team went there at midnight,  position was"
"the same.  According  to  PW2,  the Informant had said  that the doors"
"were  closed  and  lights  were  off,  and  he  believed  that  the  relevant"
"woman  may  be  sleeping inside  the  house.  This  cannot be  treated"
"as ""information"" .  The  position  of PW1  and  PW2  was  that  the  PW2"
"had left  the  Informant near the  house of the  accused  to  be vigilant"
"and 
inform 
the  PW2 
if  she  comes  home; 
there  was  no 
such"
"""information"".  It  is  very  difficult  to  believe  this  story. 
The  police"
"team  had  been  waiting  for  more  than  four  hours  to  receive  the"
"above ""information"" from  the  'Informant'."
