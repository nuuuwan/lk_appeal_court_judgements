"Therefore,  I  hold  that  the  impugned  judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"affirming the Order of the learned Magistrate is according to law. I affirm the impugned"
"judgment of the learned High Court Judge and dismiss the appeal. 1st Accused should"
"pay Rs. 30,000/- to the Applicant as costs of this appeal."
"It is important to draw the attention to the following provisions of the ICCPR Act and"
"the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant). Sub-section 2"
"of section 4 of the ICCPR Act is based on the Article 41 of the Covenant. Article 41.5"
"of the Covenant states thus;"
"‘Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being"
"reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law’ (emphasis added)."
"Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  appealable  right  of  a  person  is  guaranteed  by  the"
"Convention subject to the law of the land in the particular country. If the statute under"
"which a person is convicted and sentenced does not provide appealable rights, he has"
"no right to appeal against his conviction and the sentence. Nevertheless, when drafting"
"the ICCPR Act, the words ‘according to law’ has been omitted and as a result, even"
"though,  the  appealable  rights  have  not  been  given  by  the  statute  an  appeal  could  be"
"preferred under sub-section 2 of section 4 of the ICCPR Act against a conviction and a"
"sentence."
