"I
n paragraph 2 of the document marked as P5 with the Petition clearly indicates that the"
"1st Respondent after conducting a proper investigation about the amendment done to"
"the Agricultural Land Register dated 25-05-1998 by the Agrarian Services Committee had"
"correctly taken the decision to remove the name of the Petitioner from the Agricultural"
"Land Register."
"A
s  the  Petitioner  had  stated  in  her  petition,  her  father  Sasira  died  in  2004  and  the"
"inclusion  of  Sasira’s  name  as  the  tenant  cultivator  was  done  by the  3rd  Respondent  in"
"September  2009.  Under  Section  lD  (l)  of the new  Agrarian  Development  Act No. 46  of"
"2000 where the tenant cultivator is dead his tenant rights are devolved on his surviving"
"spouse and in the event the spouse is no longer surviving then the rights are devolved on"
"one of his children."
"T
he  said  section  lD  (l)  of  the  new  Agrarian  Development  Act  N0.  46  of  2000  states  as"
"follows;"
"The rights of a tenant cultivator under the principal enactment in respect of an"
"extent of paddy land shall in the event of the death or permanent disability of such"
"tenant cultivator, devolve on the surviving spouse of such tenant cultivator and"
"failing such spouse, on only one of the children of such tenant cultivator."
"Provided further,  if  there  is  more  than  one  child,  whose  sale  means  of living  is"
"cultivation, the oldest from amongst such children shall be preferred to the others."
"Therefore,  without  having  made  an  application  under  Section  lD  (l)  of  the  Agrarian"
"Development Act No. 46 of 2000 requesting to include the Petitioner’s name as the tenant"
"cultivator, the Petitioner straight away had come before this Court. After Sasira’s name"
"was included as the tenant cultivator again in the Agrarian land register in 2009 and as"
"the  Petitioner  had  not  make  any  application  under  Section  1D  (l)  of  the  Agrarian"
"Development Act No. 46 of 2000 the 4th Respondent had transferred the said paddy land"
"to 4A Respondent and his other four daughters in 2009."
"It could be noted that since 2009 the 4A Respondent cultivates the paddy land to date with"
"the consent of the other four co-owners of the paddy land who are her sisters. And therefore"
"the 4A Respondent had been substituted in the room of the deceased 4th Respondent."
"`      It is also pertinent to note that there are three grounds of review of an administrative decision"
"of a public officer or public body as recognized in the case of DESMOND PERERA AND OTHERS"
