"its conclusion. It is in the third category of cases, that the court has to be circumspect"
"and has to look for corroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or"
"circumstantial.”"
"Owing to the above reasoning, the learned Judge of the High Court had not erred in adopting"
"the  evidence  of  PW5  in  order  to  fortify  the  evidence  of  PW1  in  establishing  the  first  charge"
"since his evidence had been corroborated by the evidence of PW6."
"Having  stated  the  above,  it  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  number  of  witnesses  does  not"
"decide the strength of the case of the prosecution."
"In Laxmibai and another Vs. Bhagwantbuva and others (2013) 4 SCC 97; it was observed by the"
"Supreme Court of India that,"
"“…in  the  matter  of  appreciation  of  evidence  of  witnesses,  it  is  not  the  number  of"
"witnesses but quality of their evidence which is important, as there is no requirement in"
"law of evidence that any particular number of witnesses are to be examined to prove or"
"disprove a fact. It is a time-honored principle, that evidence must be weighed and not"
"counted.  The  test  is  whether  the  evidence  has  a  ring  of  truth,  is  cogent,  credible  and"
"trustworthy or otherwise. The legal system has laid emphasis on value provided by each"
"witness, rather than the multiplicity or plurality of witnesses…”"
"Therefore, on this premise, the conviction on causing the death of the deceased can be secured"
"solely  on  the  evidence  of  PW1  even 
if  the  evidence  of  PW5  were  to  be  brushed  aside"
"completely."
"Learned  counsel  for  the  second  accused-appellant  submitted  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the"
"High  Court  had  not  come  to  a  conclusion  that  the  second  accused-appellant  had  acted  with"
"common  murderous 
intention.  Similarly, 
learned  counsel 
for  the  third  accused-appellant"
"expressed  the  view  that  hence  there  was  some  doubt  as  to  whether  the  third  accused-"
"appellant  had  come  together  with  the  other  accused-appellants, 
it  would  have  created  a"
"serious doubt as to whether the third accused-appellant entertained a common intention with"
"the others to cause death of the deceased."
"Whether  the  second  and  third  accused-appellants  had  entertained  the  common  murderous"
"intention 
in  causing 
the  death  of  deceased  can  only  be 
inferred 
from 
the 
facts  and"
"circumstances of this case. The law relating to the concept of common intention is set out in"
"section 32 of the Penal Code."
"“When  a  criminal  act 
is  done  by  several  persons 
in  furtherance  of  the  common"
"intention  of  all,  each  of  such  persons  is  liable  for  that  act  in  the  same  manner  as  if  it"
"were done by him alone.”"
"An  update  on  the  law  relating  to  section  32  of  the  Penal  code  was  spelt  out  in  Galagamage"
"Indrawansa  Kumarasiri  and  3  others  vs  Attorney  General,  S.C.  TAB  Appeal  No.02/2012  and  the"
"following guidelines had been arrayed."
