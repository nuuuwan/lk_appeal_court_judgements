"","To deceive is to cause to believe whether is it an indispensable element of the"

"It is quite clear that on a charge of obtaining goods or money by false pretences, no conviction",""
"is possible unless it is shown that the mind of the prosecutor was misled by the false pretence",""
"and that he was thereby induced to part with this money or good.",""
"A conviction of cheating is necessarily vitiated if the complainant is shown to have had an",""
"independent opportunity of verifying the truth of the accused's representation. The issue is",""
"whether, in a situation of this kind, the complainant should be treated as having accepted the",""
"risk that the accused’s representation turns out to be false. By what means must the accused",""
