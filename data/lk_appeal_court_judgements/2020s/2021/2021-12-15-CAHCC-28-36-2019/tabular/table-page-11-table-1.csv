"24. Witness Leelawathi has testified in support of the alibi of the 1st appellant"
"claiming  that  he  was  at  her  home  in  Dankotuwa  on  the  alleged  day  of  the"
"incident, recovering from the injuries he suffered from a vehicle accident."
"25. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the learned High Court judge who"
"wrote  the  judgment  only  had  the  benefit  of  listening  to  the  evidence  of  the"
"defence as all the other evidence had been led before her predecessors."
"Submissions on behalf of the Attorney General: -"
"26. In  his  submissions  to  this  Court,  the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  (SSC)"
"conceded  that  there  was  a  clear  misdirection  in  the  judgment  as  to  the"
"applicable  law  when  the  learned  High  Court  judge  shifted  the  burden  of"
"proving the alibi to the appellants. He accepted that the procedure adopted"
"in leading section 27 evidence was wrong. Commenting on the consideration"
"of the evidence of bad character in the judgment, it was his view that what is"
"necessary  to  consider  is  that  whether  it  had  caused  any  prejudice  to  the"
"relevant appellant."
"27. However, it was his contention that although the defence has taken up the"
"position  that  all  the  defendants  pleaded  the  defence  of  alibi  at  the  trial,  in"
"fact, only the plea of the 1st  appellant can be considered a valid plea of an"
"alibi.  Pointing  to  the  evidence  and  the  dock  statements  of  the  appellants"
"themselves, it was his argument that all the other appellants admittedly had"
"been in the vicinity of the incident and somewhat connected to it. It was his"
"view that their denial of any involvement in the incident where the deceased"
"suffered his injuries, would not amount to a plea of alibi."
"28. It was also his argument that even though the learned High Court judge had"
"not  followed  the  conventional  approach  in  analyzing  the  evidence  of  the"
"prosecution,  the  prosecution  evidence,  in  fact  had  been  analyzed  by  the"
"learned  High  Court  judge  while  summarizing  the  evidence,  contrary  to  the"
"argument that the prosecution evidence had not been analyzed.  He went on"
"to point out several instances in the judgment to support his contention."
