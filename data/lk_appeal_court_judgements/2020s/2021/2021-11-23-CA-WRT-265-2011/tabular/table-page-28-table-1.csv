"followed  by  the  members  of  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  before  this.  When  her  Research"
"proposals  were  being  considered  the  Petitioner  too 
left  the  meeting  enabling  the  other"
"members of the Ethics Review Committee to make an independent decision whether to grant"
"ethical clearance to her research proposals or not. But Dr. Nirmala Wijekoon participated in the"
"Ethics Review Committee meeting on 13.01.2011, where the ethical issues of the said clinical"
"trials  were  considered.  When  members  of 
the  Ethics  Review  Committee 
including 
the"
"Petitioner  expressed  certain  reservations  regarding  Dr.  Nirmala  Wijekoonâ€™s  participation  as"
"there  was  a  conflict  of  interest  in  her  participation,  having  deliberated  on  the  situation,  the"
"legal officer who is the 57th Respondent stated that Dr. Nirmala Wijekoon can participate in the"
"meeting to attend to secretarial functions as the Secretary of the Ethics Review Committee, but"
"should not deliberate in the proceedings on the proposals on the five clinical trials as there was"
"a conflict of interest."
"On  13.01.2011  after  the  said  meeting  Dr.  Nirmala  Wijekoon  telephoned  the  Petitioner  and"
"expressed her dissatisfaction in remaining on the committee and I requested her to be on the"
"Ethics  Review  Committee  as  suggested  by  the  57th  Respondent.  At  the  next  meeting  held  on"
"18.01.2011 notwithstanding her desire to resign, Dr. Nirmala Wijekoon came and participated"
"in  the  meeting.  The  Petitioner  appraised  the  committee  what  transpired  whereupon  Dr."
"Nirmala Wijekoon reiterated her desire to resign."
"Although Dr. Nirmala Wijekoon is alleged to have written a letter of resignation on 14.01.2011,"
"where she has stated that she will resign with effect from 31st January, it was not tabled at the"
"meeting  of  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  which  was  held  on  18.01.2011  nor  did  the  1s1"
"Respondent  forward  to  the  Petitioner  such  a  letter  before  18.01.2011  thereby  depriving  the"
"opportunity of explaining the factual situation."
"The Petitioner stated that Dr. R. Hassan who was a member of the Ethics Review Committee"
"had attended  only the first two meetings held in August and September 2010, whereas Prof."
"Hewawisanthi  had  stated  in  her  letter  of  resignation  that  she  was  resigning  from  the  Ethics"
"Review  Committee  as  she  was  unable  to  devote  the  time  required  to  carry  out  duties"
"satisfactorily as a member of the Ethics Review Committee. Therefore, I state that the letters of"
"resignation  have  been  orchestrated  and  has  been  obtained  to 
facilitate  the  granting  of"
"approval to the five  clinical  trials  even though there were  serious  ethical  issues  and before  a"
"proper appraisal of the ethical issues were considered."
"The  Petitioner  believe  that  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  was  dissolved  to  enable  the  clinical"
"trials  to  proceed  as  the  1'  Respondent  was  also  a  member  of  the  Clinical  Trials  Unit  through"
"which these proposals were submitted. The Petitioner specifically states that even before the"
"decision of the 1st Respondent was ratified by the Faculty Board, the newly appointed Ethics"
"Review Committee had met on 26.01.2011 and granted approval to the five clinical trials."
"The Petitioner further states that before the Ethics Review Committee was dissolved, she was"
"not  given  an  opportunity  of  explaining  matters. She  also  stated that  before this decision was"
"conveyed to the Faculty Board, at a meeting of the Management Committee of the Faculty of"
"Medicine  University  of  Kelaniya  held  on  20.01.2011,  the  01st  Respondent  informed  the  said"
"Management  Committee  that  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  of  the  Faculty  of  Medicine  had"
"been dissolved and a new committee had been appointed. Although he gave certain reasons,"
