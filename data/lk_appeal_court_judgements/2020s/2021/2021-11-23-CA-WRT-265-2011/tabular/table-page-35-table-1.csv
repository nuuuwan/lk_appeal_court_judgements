"Therefore, by reviewing this case it is clear that want of jurisdiction may arise from the nature"
"of the subject matter of the proceeding and the court can't decide some of its parts and let the"
"other  be  untouched.  Enquiry  of  the  whole  case  should  be  conducted  together.  Similarly,  in"
"cases where the inferior courts have wrongfully denied to exercise jurisdiction vested in it, writ"
"of  certiorari  may  be  issued  to  quash  the  decision  of  the  inferior  court  and  decide  the  case"
"falling within their jurisdiction."
"In  cases  of  conditional  powers,  there  are  certain  powers  vested  in  the  court  that  can  be"
"exercised only when certain jurisdictional facts exist otherwise if the court or tribunal exercised"
"those  powers  without  the  availability  of  those  jurisdictional  facts,  even  the  assumption  of"
"jurisdiction by the court that such facts exist would not be supported and can be removed by a"
"writ of certiorari."
"In the case of Express newspaper Ltd. v Workers and Staff 1963 SCR (3) 540,  the question on"
"which  the  jurisdiction  industrial  tribunal  decided  was  whether  the  dispute  is  an  industrial"
"dispute or a non-industrial one? The Supreme Court held that if the industrial tribunal assumes"
"to have jurisdiction over a non-industrial dispute, then it can be challenged before Court and"
"the Court has the power to issue a writ of certiorari for the same question. Power to issue an"
"appropriate Writ by Court is not subject to any question."
"If it is a violation of procedure or disregard of the principle of natural justice, a writ of certiorari"
"can be issued. To set aside any decision given in violation of the principle of natural justice, a"
"writ of certiorari will always be issued."
"There are two principles of natural justice recognised by law;"
