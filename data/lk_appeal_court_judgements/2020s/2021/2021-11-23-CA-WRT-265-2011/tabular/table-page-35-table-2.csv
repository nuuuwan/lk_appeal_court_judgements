"writ of certiorari will always be issued."
"There are two principles of natural justice recognised by law;"
"1)  Audi alteram partem (hear the other side) means that both sides must be given equal"
"opportunity  of  hearing.    Both  sides  should  be  given  a  full  and  fair  chance  to  present"
"their  side  of  the  case.  Every  judicial  or  quasi-judicial  body  must  give  an  equal  and"
"reasonable opportunity to the parties to make their representation. In other words, it"
"can be said that the party whose civil rights are affected in any proceeding before the"
"court  must  have  reasonable  notice  of  the  case  he  has  to  meet  with  and  be  given  an"
"opportunity of stating his case. This rule commands the authority deciding the case to"
"give both the parties to the case an equal opportunity for presenting their case and to"
"correct and contradict any relevant statement."
