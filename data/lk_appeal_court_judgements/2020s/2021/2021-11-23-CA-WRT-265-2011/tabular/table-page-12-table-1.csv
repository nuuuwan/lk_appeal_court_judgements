"(Vice-Chancellor) to look into this matter and grant relief and ensure that proper procedure is"
"followed.  But  the  54th  Respondent  (Vice-Chancellor)  failed  and  neglected  to  look  into  the"
"matter."
"The  Petitioner  states  that  non-compliance  with  strict  guidelines  applicable  to  granting  of"
"ethical clearance in respect of research projects wherein human subjects are used, can cause"
"serious risks to lives and limbs of the said human subjects and the authorities concerned have a"
"public and constitutional duty to ensure that research using human subjects is properly carried"
"out. The 01st to 54th Respondents who have a public duty as aforesaid has failed and neglected"
"to  ensure  that  due  compliance 
is  made 
in  respect  of  this  Statutory  and  Public  duty.  The"
"Petitioner states that the Senate of the University of Kelaniya has a statutory right to control"
"the  research  that 
is  being  done  at  the  university  and  with  that 
in  view  to  ensure  duly"
"constituted  Ethics  Review  Committee  is  functional  and  also  that  the  proper  procedures  in"
"granting ethical clearance is observed."
"The Petitioner further argues that she has always acted by the guidelines issued by the FERCSL"
"and the Sri Lanka Medical Council in discharging her duties as the Member and the Chairperson"
"of the Ethics Review Committee. The dissolution of the Ethics Review Committee presided by"
"her  causeâ€™s  grave  repercussions  as  far  as  her  integrity  and  her  career  in  the  University  is"
"concerned and therefore, she seeks mandates like Writs of Certiorari to quash the decisions of"
"the  01st  Respondent,  dated  20.01.2011  and  the  decisions  of  the  Faculty Board  consisting  the"
"01st 
to  53rd  Respondents,  dated  03.02.2011.  The  Petitioner 
further 
states 
that 
in 
the"
"circumstances this is a fit and proper case where this Court should issue mandates like Writs of"
"Certiorari quashing the decisions of the 01st Respondent dated 20.01.2011 dissolving the Ethics"
"Review  Committee  and  appointing  a  new  Ethics  Review  Committee  and  the  decisions  of  the"
"Faculty Board consisting the 01st to 53rd Respondents of the Medical faculty of the University of"
"Kelaniya dated 03.02.2011 dissolving the said Ethics Review Committee and appointing a new"
"Ethics Review Committee."
"The Petitioner states that the dissolved Ethics Review Committee prepared Standard Operating"
"Procedures  for  the  functioning  of  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  of  the  Faculty  of  Medicine"
"University of Kelaniya and presented it to the Faculty Board for approval on 15.12.2010. This is"
"a  fit  and  proper  case  where  this  Court  should 
issue  mandates 
in  the  nature  of  Writs  of"
"Mandamus  directing  the  members  of  the  Faculty  Board  to  take  steps  to  approve  the  said"
"Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  to  direct  the  Vice-Chancellor  and  the  members  of  the"
"Faculty Board of the Faculty of Medicine, the University of Kelaniya to take steps to appoint a"
"new Ethics Review Committee by the law."
"The Petitioner states that all her endeavours to ensure that the University of Kelaniya adhered"
"to  the  proper  procedures  especially  in  granting  approvals  to  international  multi-centre  drug"
"trials  had  fallen  on  deaf  ears.  The  authorities  in  the  Faculty  of  Medicine  in  the  University  of"
"Kelaniya  have  failed  to  ensure  that  medical  research  and  drug  trials  are  conducted  under"
"applicable laws, rules and guidelines as set out above and they have neglected to perform their"
"public  duty.  Therefore,  the  Petitioner  was  compelled  to  seek  relief  from  this  Court  in  her"
"capacity as well as in the Public Interest."
