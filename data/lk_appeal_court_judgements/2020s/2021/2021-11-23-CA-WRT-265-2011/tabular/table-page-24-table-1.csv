"(b) In  doing  so,  an  Ethics  Review  Committee  is  required  to  review  and  evaluate  such"
"proposed research based on social value, scientific validity, fair participant selection,"
"favourable risk and benefit ratio etc..."
"(
c)  To engage in any biomedical research involving human participants, tissue & data or"
"animals, it is essential to seek and obtain prior ethical clearance."
"(
d) Such proposed research is considered justified and valid only when the design of the"
"research  is  scientifically  sound  and  the  method  to  be  used  is  appropriate  to  the"
"objectives of the research and the field of study and includes a thorough knowledge"
"of scientific literature and other relevant sources of information, which ought to be"
"reflected in the application submitted in that regard seeking ethical clearance."
"(
e)  In reviewing and evaluating such research proposals, an Ethics Review Committee is"
"required  to  provide 
independent,  competent  and  timely  reviews  and  are  also"
"required  and  expected  to  ensure  that  all  applications  submitted  seeking  ethical"
"clearance are reviewed in a systematic manner."
"(
f)  The  Ethics  Review  Committee  is  also  required  to  review  and  evaluate  all  research"
"proposals submitted for ethical clearance and review including those submitted by"
"students. 
If  there 
is  an 
inordinate  delay 
in  approving  research  proposals,  the"
"purpose of having an Ethics Review Committee would be defeated."
"Answering  the  averments  contained 
in  paragraphs  23,  29  and  30  of  the  petition,  these"
"Respondents state that;"
"(a)  The  proposed  research  had  been  designed  to  assess  the  superiority  of  intra-clot"
"injection  of  plasmin  compared  to  plasminogen-activator  and  'no  treatment'  about"
"clots in the leg following clot formation in Artery or Bypass Graft. In Sri Lanka, due"
"to  lack  of  facilities,  the  current  standard  of  care  for  such  patients  is  conservative"
"management with lifestyle changes and anti-platelet therapy."
"(b) This 
is  not  the 
internationally-accepted 
'best'  therapy  and  does  not  produce  a"
"significant benefit to most patients thus requiring surgical bypass grafting. Occlusion"
"of  the  bypass  graft  may  result  in  amputation.  Plasmin  (human),  a  substance  that"
"dissolves clots, has the potential to have a lower major bleeding event profile than"
"currently  used  thrombolytics  (clot  busters).  Thus,  plasmin  delivered  via  catheter"
"directly 
into  a  thrombus  (clot) 
is  not  expected  to 
induce 
internal  bleeding  as"
"observed with currently available plasminogen activators."
"(c)  The main investigators who submitted the aforementioned proposed research were"
"Dr.Ruwan Fonseka (Vascular Surgeon) and Dr.Asitha de Silva."
"(
d) Two  Reviewers  had  approved  the  research  proposal  submitted  in  that  regard  and"
"deny the remaining averments contained therein."
