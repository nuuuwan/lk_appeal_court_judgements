"An umbrella organization named Forum of Ethics Review Committees of Sri Lanka (FERCSL) has"
"also  been  formed  consisting of  all the  Ethics  Review  Committees  of  all  the  institutions  which"
"conduct  human  research.  They  too  have  adopted  guidelines  as  to  how  the  Ethics  Review"
"Committees  should  function.  Thus,  a  carefully designed  legal  mechanism  is  set  up  to balance"
"the  countervailing  policy  considerations.  The  proper  and  unbiased  functioning  of  the  Ethics"
"Review  Committees 
is  essential 
to 
carry  out 
these  principles.  Therefore,  unless 
strict"
"parameters  are  not  set  out  when  issues  arise  severe  difficulties  would  arise  to  unsuspecting"
"Citizens and patients during the drug trials."
"The  Reconstituted  Ethics  Review  Committee  of  the  Faculty  of  Medicine  of  the  University  of"
"Kelaniya  for  the  period under  consideration had  been appointed by the Faculty Board  of  the"
"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya. The Petitioner was a member of that committee."
"The  said  appointment  was  conveyed  to  her  by 
letter  dated  27.08  2010.  Thereafter  the"
"members  of  the  said  Committee  elected  the  Petitioner  as  the  Chairperson  of  the  said"
"Committee. The Petitioner says that she has considerable experience as being a member of the"
"Ethics  Review  Committee  as  she  had  continuously  served  as  a  member  of  the  Ethics  Review"
"Committees of the Medical Faculty of the University of Kelaniya since 1999. On 20th January"
"2011, the said Ethics Review Committee was dissolved by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine,"
"University  of  Kelaniya.  The  Petitioner  states  that  the  said  decision  was  illegal,  mala-fide,  in"
"violation of the rules of natural justice and for extraneous and collateral reasons. It is against"
"this dissolution that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari from this Court."
"Before  I  analyse  the  submissions  of  the  present  case,  it  would  be  interesting  to  shed  a  light"
"regarding the concept of prerogative Writs."
"If any wrongful act is committed or injustice has been done to anybody then it will spread like a"
"virus and can't be tolerated. Therefore, all the justice is done will be spoiled and everyone else"
"has to wonder, what it would take for that same injustice to be done with them. There arises a"
"need to provide justice to all and remove the bias from the system. Hence the concept of the"
"writ was introduced in Common Law for keeping a judicial eye on the work of administration."
"A  writ  is  a  written  official  order  issued  by  the  court.  The  formal  order  may  be  in  form  of  a"
"warrant,  direction,  command.  Writs  can  only  be  issued  by the  Court  of  Appeal  Under  Article"
"140  of  our  Constitution.  We  have  adopted  the  concept  of  prerogative  writs  from  English"
"common law. Writs were first used to describe a written command of the King. Whereas, these"
"writs  are  now  available  to  a  person  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the 
inferior  courts  or"
"administrative body in England."
"When we  consider  the distinction  between writs  and orders,  it  can  be  said  that  writs  can be"
"issued  to  provide  an  extraordinary  remedy.  That  is  in  cases  where  the  aggrieved  person  is"
"seeking an extraordinary remedy usually against an administrative action, whereas, orders can"
"pass  in  any  matter.  A  writ  of  mandamus  is  a  command  given  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  the"
"lower  court or  any tribunal  or board  or to  any other public  authority to perform  their public"
"duty  imposed  upon  them  by  law.  Its  primary  objective  is  to  supply  defects  of  justice  and"
"prevent the rights of the citizen."
"The  writ  of  certiorari  has  been  defined  as  one  of  the  most  effective  and  efficient  remedies"
"taken  from  common  law.  Certiorari  means  ""to  certify"".  It  is  an  order  issued  by  the  Superior"
