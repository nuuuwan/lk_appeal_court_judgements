"The  Petitioner 
further  says  that  similarly  the  other 
four  Drug  Trials  were  taken  up 
for"
"consideration  at the  meeting  held  on 18.01.2011.  There too  the  Committee  invited  the  main"
"investigators  to  be  present 
to  explain  certain  ethical 
issues 
that  arose.  They  have  not"
"participated but they were represented by Professor H. Asitha De Silva, who is the coordinator"
"of the Clinical Trials Unit of the Department of Pharmacology of the Faculty of Medicine. At the"
"said  meeting  the ethical  issues  arising  in  these  four  drug trials  were  considered  and  as  those"
"too remained  unanswered  it was decided to  seek  second  opinions.  The  Guidelines  on  Ethical"
"Conduct  of  Medical  &  Dental  Practitioners  Registered  with  The  Sri  Lanka  Medical  Council"
"categorically  state  that  if  the  Ethics  Committee  does  not  feel  competent  to  consider  difficult"
"scientific data or the difficult ethical issues, it should seek appropriate advice or co-opt people"
"with the necessary expertise."
"The Petitioner states that the 01st Respondent was present at the meeting of the Ethics. Review"
"Committee  on  18.01.2011  and  tried  to  persuade  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  to  accept  the"
"proposals  without  adhering  to  guidelines  set  out  by  Sri  Lanka  Medical  Council  and  Forum  of"
"Ethics  Review  Committees  of  Sri  Lanka  (FERCSL).  The  petitioner  contended  that  the  01st"
"Respondent is a member of the Clinical Trials Unit of the Department of Pharmacology which"
"coordinated  these  drug  trials  and  therefore  was  an  interested  party  in  these  drug  trials.  The"
"Petitioner  further  states  that  in  terms  of  the  said  guidelines  the  01""  Respondent  was  not"
"entitled to interfere with the decision-making process of the said Committee."
"The Petitioner says that, while trying to persuade the Ethics Review Committee to grant ethical"
"clearance to  these  drug trials, the 01st  Respondent  tried  to  mislead  the Committee by  saying"
"that  the  Ministry  of  Health  had  given  clearance  and  therefore  the  Committee  should  follow"
"suit.  The  Petitioner  further  says  that  this  was  false.  The  members  of  the  Ethics  Review"
"Committee considering the ethical issues that arose thought, it was in the best interest of the"
"human  subjects  who  would  be  involved  in  the  research  to  seek  further  opinions.  The  01st"
"Respondent  being  angered  by  the  refusal  of  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  to  accede  to  his"
"unreasonable  and  illegal  demand  and  with  a  view  of  getting  the  requisite  approvals  for  the"
"drug trials purported to dissolve the Ethics Review Committee by letter dated 20.01.2011 with"
"immediate effect. The Petitioner or any of the members of the Ethics Review Committee was"
"not informed of any reason as to why suddenly the said Committee was dissolved."
"The Petitioner argues that the said decision of the 01st Respondent is ultra-vires. The powers of"
"the  01st  Respondent,  made  for  a  collateral  purpose,  mala-fide  and  contrary  to 
law.  The"
"members of the Ethics Review Committee acted by the guidelines of the FERCSL and in the best"
"interests  of  the  human  subjects  that  were  to  be  subjected  to 
invasive  procedures.  The"
"Petitioner  further  states  that  this  was  by  the  Guidelines  set  out  by  the  Sri  Lanka  Medical"
"Council  about  granting  ethical  clearance.  The  Petitioner  believes  that  the  investigators  had"
"informed  the  Sub  Committee  on  Clinical  Trials  of  the  Cosmetics  Devices  and  Drugs  Authority"
"that  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  of  the  University  of  Kelaniya  had  already  granted  ethical"
"clearance  for  these  proposals  and  therefore  when  they  became  aware  that  second  opinions"
"were sought in respect of the said proposals, the Investigators became agitated."
"The Petitioner states that the Management Committee of the Faculty of Medicine was held on"
"20.01.2011.  At  the  said meeting  the Dean  announced  that the  said  committee  was  dissolved"
"and  the  reasons  given  by  the  Respondent  for  the  dissolution  of  the  said  Committee 
is"
