"the  Petitioner  objected  and 
requested 
for  an 
independent  person 
to  be  appointed 
to"
"investigate the matters before the Ethics Review Committee was dissolved. Although the 01st"
"Respondent  undertook  to 
look 
into  that  matter  no  such  steps  were  taken  by  the  01st"
"Respondent."
"The Petitioner states that the ethical standards considered by the Ethics Review Committees in"
"developed  countries  where 
there 
is  a  much  greater  patient  care  system  could  not  be"
"unquestionably applied to the system prevailing in Sri Lanka."
"Answering  the  averments  contained  in  paragraph  25  of  the  01st  Respondent's  affidavit,  The"
"Petitioner states that after she came before this Court, the steps to implement the ""Standard"
"Operating Procedure"" for the Ethics Review Committee of the Medical faculty of the University"
"of Kelaniya is being pursued by the 01st Respondent. The Petitioner says that she is entitled to"
"bring this application in the public interest as this is a situation where the 01st Respondent has"
"tried  to 
jeopardise  the 
lives  and 
limbs  of  the  Sri  Lankan  patients  without  following  the"
"guidelines in which he has a public duty to adhere to."
"Answering averments contained in objections and affidavits of the Respondents, the Petitioner"
"states that there are no 'aches on my part in making this application to Court and deny that she"
"has  misrepresented  facts  to  Court  in  making  this  application.  The  Petitioner  says  that  this"
"application is not Merely of a private nature. It has been made in the interest of the voiceless"
"patients  who  are  unaware  of  the  serious  risks  they  are  sought  to  be  subjected  to.  The"
"appointment  of  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  derives 
its 
legitimacy  from  statutory  power"
"granted  under  the  Universities  Act  and 
is  designed  to  further  the  constitutional  rights  of"
"patients who may be subjected to cruel inhuman degrading treatments and punishments in the"
"guise of medical research."
"The Petitioner further says that she is entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Since"
"an  Ethics  Review  Committee 
is  appointed 
in  terms  of  statutory  power  conferred  on  the"
"appointing authority, the principal function of the Ethics Review Committee is to ensure that"
"the medical research using human subjects are conducted strictly following the internationally"
"accepted ethical standards and for the benefit of the public. The conduct of medical research in"
"Sri Lanka is also governed by an international legal regime that Sri Lanka has agreed to abide"
"by. Medical Research using human subjects is usually conducted by Medical Practitioners who"
"are  bound  by  the  statutory  regime  governing  their  conduct  and  should  adhere  to  rules,"
"regulations and conduct governing the medical profession."
"Therefore, the appointment of members, the dismissal and the procedure of the Ethics Review"
"Committee  should  be  following  the  public  interest  and  in  compliance  with  the  public  trust"
"reposed on statutory functionaries.  The said committees are performing a public duty for and"
"on behalf of the public and have a statutory underpinning and of statutory flavour. The Ethics"
"Review  Committees  are  appointed  by  the  Dean  of  the  Faculty  and  is  ratified  by  the  Faculty"
"Board under the powers granted by the Universities Act. The Petitioner further state that the"
"Faculty Board cannot abdicate their statutory functions. If the necessity arises an Ethics Review"
"Committee is required to obtain opinions from experts in the said fields and the said procedure"
"has been sanctioned by the Sri Lanka Medical Council guidelines on Ethical Conduct for Medical"
"and Dental Practitioners."
