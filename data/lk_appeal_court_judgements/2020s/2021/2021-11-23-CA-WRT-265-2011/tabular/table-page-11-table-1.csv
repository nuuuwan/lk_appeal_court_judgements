"The  Petitioner  states  that  the  matters  set  out  by  the  01st  Respondent  for  dissolving  the"
"committee  is erroneous and  is  contrary  to the  guidelines  issued  by the FERCSL  and  Sri  Lanka"
"Medical  Council.  The  decision  to  dissolve  the  Committee  was  taken  by  the  01st  Respondent"
"without allowing any of the members of the Committee to explain their position and none of"
"the alleged documents referred to therein was shown to the members. Thus, the basic norms"
"of fairness were grossly violated. The Petitioner verily believes that some of these documents"
"were fabricated by interested persons to dissolve the Ethics Review Committee and get those"
"Drug Trials approved. The Petitioner complained about this unjust treatment meted out to her"
"by  bringing  this  to  the  notice  of  FERCSL  the  umbrella  organization  named  Forum  of  Ethics"
"Review  Committees,  Sri  Lanka  by  letter  dated  27.01.2011.  It  was  copied  to  Director  Drug"
"Regulatory  Authority,  President  Sri  Lanka  Medical  Council  and  Chairpersons  of  Ethics  Review"
"Committees  of  Colombo,  Sri  Jayawardenapura,  Peradeniya  and  Ruhuna  Medical  Faculties  to"
"bring to their notice the scandalous affairs happening at the Faculty of Medicine, University of"
"Kelaniya and also to ensure that the proper guidelines relating to the ethical dimension in using"
"human subjects are adhered to."
"The Petitioner further states that a meeting of the Faculty Board of the University of Kelaniya"
"was held on 03.02.2011. In the agenda sent to the Members of the Faculty Board, it was not"
"mentioned that there was anything related to the Ethics Review Committee being discussed at"
"that  meeting.  The faculty  Board  consists  of  about  88  members.  At the said  meeting  only  the"
"01st  to  53rd  Respondents  as  well  as  the  Petitioner  participated  and  the  01st  Respondent"
"intimated to them that the Ethics Review Committee had been dissolved and a new committee"
"had been appointed. The Faculty Board approved the said decision of the 01st Respondent."
"The Petitionerâ€™s argument was, that the said decision of the Faculty Board is contrary to law,"
"unreasonable based on misrepresentations. It is null and void and of no force or avail in law."
"The  Petitioner  states  that  after  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  was  dissolved  by  letter  dated"
"20.01.2011  the  01st  Respondent  purported  to  appoint  another  Committee.  Normally  an"
"opportunity  is  given  to  persons  who  are  interested  to  apply  to  be  members  of  the  Ethics"
"Review Committee. The Faculty Board should appoint suitable persons from them. But in this"
"instance, the impugned appointments did not follow the criteria of transparency and the 01st"
"Respondent purported to appoint the said Ethics Review Committee on his own. Thereafter the"
"five drug trials referred to above in respect of which second opinions had been called for by the"
"dissolved Ethics Review Committee, had been once again reviewed by the new Ethics Review"
"Committee.  The  Petitioner  says  that  she  reliably  understands  that  the  new  Ethics  Review"
"Committee  acted 
in  post-haste  and  approved  the  said  drug  trials  unconditionally  thereby"
"jeopardizing the health of the human subjects that would be subjected to serious health risks"
"which cause concern to the dissolved Ethics Review Committee."
"The  petitioner 
further  states  that  the  said  ethical  clearance  had  been  granted  without"
"considering and contrary to the specific mandatory guidelines set out by the FERCSL and the Sri"
"Lanka Medical Council. The Petitioner states that without addressing the ethical issues raised"
"by the dissolved Ethics Review Committee, the ethical clearance could not have been granted"
"in respect of those five drug trials under the prevailing ethical clearance regime. The Petitioner"
"by 
letter  dated  24.01.2011  brought  this  matter  to  the  notice  of  the  Vice-Chancellor  and"
"subsequently  by 
letter  dated  26.02.2011  her  Counsel  also  requested  the  54th  Respondent"
