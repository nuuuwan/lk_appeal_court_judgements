"“Assessment  of  the  Contributions  made  by  the  two  applicants  for  the  Post  of"
"Professor of Surgery, University of Colombo"
"I
  forward  herewith  my  assessments  of  the  above  applicants  based  on  the"
"marking scheme of the UGC dated 30th November 2005 forwarded to me by you."
"I
  would  like  to  make  some  observations  on  the  assessment.  I  feel  they  are"
"relevant as there is some contest in  my  mind in applying the marking scheme."
"However,  as  I  have  applied  the  interpretation  to  both  applicants,  there  should"
"be no bias."
"I
n 2.1  of  the  marking scheme  both candidates  have  added an  additional point"
"based on 2.1.1 111 for all articles in the indexed journals. Since one cannot index"
"a journal unless published at least 4 x / year, I feel therefore there is an error.(If"
"the marking scheme was to read 2.1.1 111 before 2.1.1 11 this anomaly could"
"be corrected). Lest you wish to add the mark – I have given a breakdown of the"
"marks, which will permit the selection board to do so."
"O
ne  candidate  has  discriminated  between  an  abstract  of  a  presentation"
"published  as  a  supplement  to  an  indexed  journal  as  being  of  greater  value."
"This point may need to be discussed. I have not made any recognition of this.”"
"T
he final paragraph makes it clear that the second External Expert too has identified"
"that  the  14th  Respondent  has  listed  abstracts  published  in  supplements  of  indexed"
"journals.  While  he  has  not  given  any  marks  for  the  said  abstracts,  the  fact  remains"
"that  the  claim  for  marks  for  the  said  abstracts  has  been  highlighted  by  the  second"
"External Expert in his letter, ‘3R1’."
"T
he cumulative effect of the evaluation was that ‘EE1’ had allotted seven marks for"
"the  said  abstracts  while  the  second  External  Expert  had  allotted  none.  With  the"
"average marks of the two External Experts being the final mark for Sections 2.1 and"
"3, the result was that the 14th Respondent had received 3.5 marks for a category not"
"provided  for  under  Circular  No.  869.  I  do  not  think  this  fact  can  be  disputed  by"
"anyone."
