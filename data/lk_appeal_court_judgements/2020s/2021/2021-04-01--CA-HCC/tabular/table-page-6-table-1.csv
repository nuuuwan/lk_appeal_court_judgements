"","testified, her mother-in-law and sister-in-law who live  10  feet  away would have"
"","heard.  In her evidence PWI  admitted that they  may have heard  (page 59 of the"
"","brief). However, none of them  were called as  witnesses."
"20.","The  medical  officer who  examined  PWI  had  opined  that  the  injuries  received"
"","by  PWI  were  compatible  with  the  history  given  by  PWI.  However,  the  same"
"","medical  officer  in  cross  examination  had  opined  that  the  same  injuries  could"
"","also be sustained when having consensual  sex on a rough surface."
"21.","The learned High Court Judge  in  hi s judgment has  rejected  the statement made"
"","by  the  appell ant  from 
the  dock  on  the  basis  that  the  same  pos iti on  was  not"
"","taken  before  by  the  appellant  and  he  only  suggested  that  he  had  an  affair  with"
"","PWI.  The posi tion  taken  up  by the appellant right  throughout  had  been  that he"
"","had sexual  intercourse  with  the appell ant  with  her consent.  It  was  not taken  for"
"","the first time by the appellant in  his statement in  the dock."
"22.","In 
the  above  premise,  I  am  of the  considered  view  that  the  prosecution  has"
"","failed  to  prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the  absence  of consent  by  PWI 
to"
"","sexual  intercourse with the appellant.  Hence, the conviction and  the sentence of"
"","the  appellant  by  the  High  Court  are  set  aside.  Appellant  is  acquitted  of the"
"","charge."
"","Appeal  allowed."
