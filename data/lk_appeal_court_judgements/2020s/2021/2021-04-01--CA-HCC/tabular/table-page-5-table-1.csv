"","she  on  her  own  showed  them  to  her  husband  (page  45  of the  brief).  In  cross"

"","she  told  him  about  the  incident  (page  65  of the  brief).  However,  answering"
"","further  cross  examination  PWI  admitted  that  although  her  husband  inquired"
"","from  her  after  seeing the  injuries,  she  initially  did  not  tell  him  (page  66  of the"

"18.","The learned Trial Judge has  failed  consider the issue of the delay in  making the"
