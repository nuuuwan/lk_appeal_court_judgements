"since  March  2020  is  not  justified  and  the  lack  of  evidence  is  exceptional  enough  to"
"enlarge him on bail."
"The position of the learned State Counsel is that the matter is under consideration and"
"concedes that that the suspect above named served as the Warf Clerk in the company"
"which cleared the alleged consignment of potatoes."
"Upon considering the submissions of both parties this Court takes in to consideration"
"the  provisions  in  the  Poisons  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance  under  which  a"
"person  suspected  of  or  accused  of  an  offence  under  section  54A  and  54B  shall  be"
"enlarged on bail only upon exceptional circumstances."
"The term exceptional has been defined in many a decided cases in our legal case law"
"and  finally  it  has  been  decided  that  exceptionality  should  be  considered  as  per  the"
"circumstances  of  each  case  as  well  stand  in  Ramu  Thamodarumpillai  vs.  Attorney"
"General 2004 3 SLR 180."
"In the instant case this Court observes that the suspect above named has served in the"
"capacity of a Warf clerk in the company which cleared the alleged consignment and he"
"had not received it neither has he ordered it, he has only  carried out an order by the"
"company he was serving as an employee."
"Therefore this Court is of the view that upon such material it is not fair and just to keep"
"the  above  named  suspect  in  remand,  and  this  Court  also  observes  that  the  learned"
"State Counsel is unable to furnish any more incriminating evidence against the above"
"named suspect."
"But the above mentioned position has not been considered by the learned High Court"
"judge in the impugned order which this Court observes to be sufficiently exceptional to"
"enlarge the suspect namely Mohamed Anwer Mahamed Fawaz the 11thsuspect on bail."
