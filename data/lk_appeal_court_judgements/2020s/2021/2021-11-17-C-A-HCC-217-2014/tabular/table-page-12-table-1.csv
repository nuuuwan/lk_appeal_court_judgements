"The functions of an appellate Court in dealing with a judgment are based mainly on the facts"
"from Court which saw and heard witnesses."
"It was held in Fradd Vs Brown & Company 20 NLR 282 at 283 that, â€˜it is rare that a decision of"
"a Judge so express, so explicit upon a point of fact purely is over ruled by a Court of Appeal,"
"because Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a Judge of first instance"
"has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only"

"veracity so direct and so specific as these, a Court of Appeal will over rule a Judge of first"
"instance.'"
"In the present case, the learned High Court Judge has well analysed all the evidence before"
"him in his judgment."
"In the case of King v. Musthapha Lebbe 44 NLR. 505 the Court of Appeal held that ""The court"
"of criminal Appeal will not interfere with the verdict of a Jury unless it has a real doubt as to"
"the guilt of the accused or is of the opinion that on the whole it is safer that the conviction"
"should not be allowed to stand""."
"In  the  above  circumstances  it  is  evident  that  there  is  strong  and  cogent  evidence  which"
"establishes the fact that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and"

"appellant did commit the offence of murder."
"Considering the above, there is no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned High"
"Court Judge."
"We affirm the conviction and the sentence dated 30.09.2014."
"Appeal is dismissed."
