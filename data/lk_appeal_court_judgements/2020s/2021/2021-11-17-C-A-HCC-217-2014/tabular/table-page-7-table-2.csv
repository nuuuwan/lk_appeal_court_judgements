"For the accused-appellant it was argued that above portions of evidence reveal that there had"
"been  an  animosity  between  Karunawathi's  family  and  the  accused, 
in  connection  with"
"incidents of tipping off to police. The above circumstance is confirmed by the defence of the"
"accused taken in dock statement at the trial. I do not agree with the said argument of the"
"accused-appellant, considering the evidence revealed at the trial."
"Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect the trustworthiness of"
"the witness' statement, it is well established that the Court must exercise its judgment on the"
"nature and tenor of the inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the"
"facts in issue."
"It  was  decided  in  Bharwada  Boghinbhai  Hirjibhai  v  State  of  Gujarat.  AIR  (1983)  SC  753,"
"discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic version of the"

"that because two witnesses contradict each other, one of them must be a false witness and"

in 
its  entirety.  The 
judge  has  a  duty  to  probe 
into  whether  the"
"discrepancy occurred due to a lack of observation or defective memory or a dishonest motive."
"In State of UP v. M.K Anthony; AIR 1985 SC 48 the Indian Supreme Court stated that 'while"
"appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence... read"
"as a whole appears to have a ring of truth', The Court went on to elaborate further that 'Minor"
"discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper technical approach"
"by  taking  sentences  torn  out  of  context  here  or  there 
from  the  evidence,  attaching"
"importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the"
"root of the matter would not ordinarily permit, rejection of the evidence as a whole'."
"Basnayake CJ in Queen v. Julius 1980 (2) SLR. 1 observed 'that in applying the maxim of Falsus"
