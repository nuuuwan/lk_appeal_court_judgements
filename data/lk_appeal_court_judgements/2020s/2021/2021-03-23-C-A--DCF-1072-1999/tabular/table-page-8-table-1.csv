to  the  allocation  of  shares  and  entitlement  of  certain  buildings"
"standing thereon in the corpus."
"Therefore, it could be seen the appeal is so lely based  on  only one question which depends on the"
"interpretation of the exact extent granted  by virtue of Deed  produced marked P20 at the trial."
"In the schedule of the Deed  marked P20 bearing No.42/364 dated 08 t h January 1967, attested by"
"Somasunderam  Mahadeva  N.P., the following is  stated;"
"""a  divided  one-third (1/3 rd
)  share of the paddy field  referred  to as  Lot D in  Deed  of Lease  No.49"
"dated 22.09.1957"""
"It was  argued  that the entire extent of the  property in  the schedule  is  given  as  1 Acre  1 Rood  9"
"Perches which is in fact 209 perches in all. The wordings given in the schedule, a divided one third"
"share of the paddy field referred to in  Lot D of Lease  No.49 of 22.09.1957 makes it clear that the"
"said  Deed  carried  only 1/3rd  of 209  perches land  which  is  around  69.67 perches  and  there is  no"
"basis for the Appellant to claim the 209 perches out of the corpus of this action which is depicted"
"in  Plan  No.1753  at  page  257  of the  appeal  brief and  the  total  extent  of the  said  corpus  of the"
"partition action  is  14 acres and  39  perch ."
"Therefore,  the  Plaintiff-Respondent  states  that  the  Appellant  cannot  get  anything  more  than"
"undivided  69.67  perch  out of the  said  land  and  the  purported  interpretation  attempted  to  be"
"given  by the Appellant by the wordings of Deed  P20  cannot be accepted. As  the schedule of the"
"said deed makes it absolutely clear that the Vendors of the said deed had only intended to convey"
"the 1/3rd  of 209 perches or in another words 1 acre 1 rood and 9 perches."
"The 4 A Defendant-Appellant states that she would not refer to the shares allotted by the learned"
"District  Judge 
to  other  parties,  though 
the  trial  Judge  has 
reduced  certain  shares  given  to"
"contesting parties  by the  Plaintiff. The  impugned  Deed  62/364 dated  8.1.1967  shows  6 parties"
"transferring the corpus to quote the schedule."
"""A divided 1/3 share of the paddy field called Ambagastenna defined as Lot 3 in the Partition Plan"
"(Lot D in  Deed  of Lease 49) within the stated  boundaries which  is  in  extent of 1 Acre  1 Rood  and"

"The  deed  also  states  that the  aforesaid  Karuppiah  Pillai  Rajartahnam,  his  wife  and  4  children"
"transferred the property to the 5th Defendant Ratnagedara Appuhamy. One of the transferees is"
"Maheshwari  Rajaratnam .  The  original  4th  Defendant  was  Karuppiah  Pillai  Rajaratnam.  The"
