"Deliberate non-disclosure is fatal. E.g., Sirisena v Richard Arsala and Others CA"
"536/84 Court of Appeal Minute dated 24.10.1990‚Äù"
"Similarly, in Dahanayake and others v Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd."
"and others (2005) 1 SLR 67, it was held that ""If there is no full and truthful"
"disclosure of material facts, the Court would not go into the merits of the application"
"but will dismiss it without further examination""."
"As such, in view of the callous disregard of the petitioner in averring exceptional"
"circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction, omission to render an"
"explanation for the inordinate delay attached to the application and non-disclosure"
"of material facts, this Court will not go into an examination of the merits of the"
"case."
"Hence, this is not a fit and proper case to invoke the discretionary revisionary"
"powers of this Court. Taking into consideration all of the above, I see no reason to"
"issue notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly"
"dismissed, without costs."
