"On examination of the present application, neither in the petition nor in the"
"affidavit does the petitioner aver the existence of exceptional circumstances"
"warranting the invoking of the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court."
"Having referred to the authorities above and a close scrutiny of the petition, it is"
"the considered view of this Court that the petitioner had failed to expressly aver"
"exceptional circumstances in which she had to file this revision application.  It"
"must be highlighted in this instant that a petitioner cannot rely on the revisionary"
"jurisdiction of this Court as of a right. Revisionary jurisdiction is only a creature of"
"the discretion of this Court and as such, petitioner must expressly state the"
"exceptional circumstances in which such a use of discretion is warranted."
"The second point of consideration is the delay in filing the present application. The"
"instant application was filed on 05.04 2021 and it prays inter alia to set aside an"
"order of the High Court of Kuliyapitiya dated 10.12. 2016. It is evident that there is"
"a lapse of close to 4 ½ years since the impugned order was delivered."
"Delay is a fatal error that would cause an application to be dismissed in limine, if"
"the petitioner fails to adduce sufficient and reasonable explanations for such"
"delay. This matter was discussed at length in Rajapakse v The State (2001) 2 SLR"
"161 which stated the following: “…if this Court were to act in revision the party"
"must come before Court without unreasonable delay. In the instant case there is a"
"delay of 13 months. In this regard vide Justice Ismail's judgment in Camillus"
"Ignatious vs. OIC of Uhana Police Station (Rev) CA 907/89 M.C. Ampara 2587"
"(Application in revision) where His Lordship was of the view that a mere delay of 4"
"months in filing revision application was fatal to maintain a revision application"
"before the Court of Appeal. His Lordship further added- “These matters must be"
"considered in limine before the Court decides to hear the accused-petitioner on the"
"merits of his application. Before he could pass the gateway to relief his aforesaid"
"contumacious conduct and his unreasonable and undue delay in filing the"
"application must be considered and determination made upon those matters before"
"he is heard on the merits of the application."""
