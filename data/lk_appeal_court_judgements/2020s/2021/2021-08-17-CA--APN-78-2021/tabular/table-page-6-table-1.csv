"In, Herath Mudiyanselage Ratnasiri Alias Nilame v The Attorney General CA"
"(PHC) APN 44/2016 Court of Appeal Minute dated 15.10.2019 was a case in which"
"the revision application was filed after 3 years and 3 months since the impugned"
"order that was sought to be revised. In an attempt to explain such delay, it was"
"alleged that an appeal has been filed. However, petitioner did not submit any"
"document to prove that such an appeal was filed. As such this unexplained delay"
"had constituted a factor that had contributed towards the rejection of the"
"revisionary application."
"Similarly, in Seylan Bank v Thangaveil (2004) 2 SLR 101 at p. 105 held that: “It"
"appears that there is a delay of one year and four months in respect of the order"
"dated 07.03.2002 and a delay of seven months from the order dated 10.01.2003."
"The petitioner has not explained the delay. Unexplained and unreasonable delay in"
"seeking relief by way of revision, which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which"
"will disentitle the petitioner to it. An application for judicial review should be made"
"promptly unless there are good reasons for the delay. The failure on the part of the"
"petitioner to explain the delay satisfactorily is by itself fatal to the application.”"
"Having thus explained the law relating to assessment of delay, this Court now turn"
"to the facts of the case. The petition has not averred any explanation for the delay"
"of close to 4 ½ years in filing the present revision application. The delay in coming"
"before this Court is inordinate which is not justified or explained by the petitioner."
"The revisionary powers vested in the Court of Appeal are very wide and Court can,"
"in a fit case, exercise that discretionary power whether or not an appeal lies, if"
"exceptional circumstances are established. Nevertheless, this Court will not"
"exercise its discretionary powers to assist the ones who sleep over their rights -"
"Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit."
"In fact, it was only upon an inquiry made by this Court on the day the application"
"was supported, did the Counsel for the petitioner reveal that an appeal has been"
"filed against the same High Court Judgment. To compound the matter further,"
"Counsel was unable to furnish any details of the said appeal let alone any proof of"
"such an appeal. Petitioner has failed to mention the same even in the petition."
