"It is the view of this court that the non-disclosure of a material fact such as a filing"
"of an appeal prior to filing a revision application, tantamount to breach in"
"observing uberrima fides on the part of the petitioner."
"In Jayasinghe v The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering"
"(NIFNE) and Others (2002) 1 SLR 277   at p. 286 the duty to disclose material"
"facts before Court was discussed in length: “the conduct of the petitioner in"
"withholding these material facts from court shows a lack of uberrima fides on the"
"part of the petitioner. When a litigant makes an application to this court seeking"
"relief, he enters into a contractual obligation with the court, this contractual"
"relationship requires the petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly."
"This Is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from court”.  In the case of Blanca"
"Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v Wilfred Van Els and two Others 1997 1 SLR 360 the"
"court highlighted this contractual obligation. Requiring the need to disclose"
"Uberrima fide and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to court. In such"
"instances, court will not go into merits of the case. The failure to make a full and"
"frank disclosure of all materials facts renders this application liable to be"
"dismissed."
"Further, in Gas Conversions (Pvt) Ltd and 3 Others   v Ceylon Petroleum"
"Corporation & 3 others SC FR 91/2002 at p. 4 Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J (as"
"she was then) had held that “a series of judgements of our court have enunciated"
"the requirement of ‘complete’ disclosure’ and uberrima fides with regard to the"
"applications before court. It is now a well-established principle that when an"
"applicant has suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to an application"
"stand when there is no complete and truthful disclosure of all material facts the"
"court will not go into merits of the relevant application but will dismiss it in limine.”"
"In Siripala v Lanerolle and Another (2012) 1 SLR 105 Per Sarath de Abrew J:"
"“…it is a cardinal principle in revisionary jurisdiction that in order to invoke the"
"discretionary, revisionary powers the petitioner shall make a full disclosure of"
"material facts known to her and there by show uberrima fides towards court."
