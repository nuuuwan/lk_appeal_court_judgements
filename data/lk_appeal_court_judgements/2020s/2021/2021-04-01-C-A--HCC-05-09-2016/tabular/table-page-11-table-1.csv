"In this case, PW1 and PW2 only stated that the accused were from their village"
"or from the adjoining village.  PW1 admitted in evidence that there were about"
"600 to 700 people in his village alone.  Even though the accused were from the"
"same  village  or  from  the  adjoining  village,  there  was  no  sufficient  evidence  to"
"show that any of the accused were intimately known to him to recognize them"
"by their voice.  No questions were put to PW1 as to how he knew the voice of"
"each  of  the  accused.    Furthermore,  PW1  has  admitted  that  only  one  or  two"
"persons had spoken to him at the incident.  Out of these one or two people, one"
"was the first accused who had deceased by the time when the trial started."
