"from New Brunswick Rail Co. v. British and French Trust Corporation Ltd,12 to explain"
"the rationale for adopting the principle that the same issue cannot be re-litigated:"
"‘‘The doctrine of estoppel is one founded on considerations of justice and good"
"sense. If an issue has been distinctly raised and decided in an action, in which"
"both parties are represented, it is unjust and unreasonable to permit the same"
"issue  to  be  re-litigated  afresh  between  the  same  parties  or  persons  claiming"
"under them.’’"
