"State Universities."
"A  similar  syllabus  change  had  been  introduced  in  2011.  On  that  occasion,  the  UGC"
"had grouped all the students (Old and New Syllabus) together and used one ‘Z’-Score"
"to determine entry to a university. That decision having been challenged by way of a"
"fundamental  rights  application,1  the  Supreme  Court  had  directed  the  UGC  to  treat"
"the  old  syllabus and  new syllabus students as two distinct populations and  to have"
"two separate ‘Z’-Scores calculated for them."
