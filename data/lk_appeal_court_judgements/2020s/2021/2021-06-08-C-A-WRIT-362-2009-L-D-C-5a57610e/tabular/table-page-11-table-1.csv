n  Rajeswari  Nadaraja  v.  M.  Najeeb  Abdul  Majeed,  Minister  of 
Industries  and"
"Commerce and Others4 Aluwihare, J held that:"
"“In an application for a writ of mandamus, the first matter to be settled is whether"
"or not the officer or authority in question has in law and in fact the power which he"
"or  she  refused  to  exercise.  As  a  question  of 
law, 
it 
is  one  of 
interpreting  the"
"empowering statutory provisions. As a question of fact, it must be shown that the"
"factual situation envisaged by the empowering statute in reality exists.”"
"I
t is clear that from the time applications were called in 2005 and until the appointments"
"were made in 2009, there were only seventeen positions in the entire cadre of Assistant"
"Divisional  Transportation  Superintendent 
(Non-Mechanical). 
In 
terms  of 
the 
ratio"
"specified 
in  the  Service  Minute  ‘P1’,  at  all  times,  ten  positions  had  to  be  filled  by"
"external  candidates  and  the  balance  seven  could  be  filled  by  internal  candidates.  In"
"2005, there were only three vacancies that existed in the external category and it is for"
"this reason that approval was sought to fill three vacancies. The fact that there are only"
"three vacancies is clearly reflected in the notice ‘P2’ by which applications were called."
"Thus,  the  legal  right  of  the  Petitioners  is  to  have  these  three  vacancies  filled  by  those"
"who were successful at the examination. The legal duty of the Respondents is to fill the"
"three vacancies in the external category from those who obtained the highest marks at"
"the interview. It is admitted that the said three vacancies have been filled by selecting"
"the  three  candidates  who  obtained  the  highest  marks. 
I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
