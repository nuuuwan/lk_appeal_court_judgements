"In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [1973] 77 NLR"
"13, it was held that,"
"“When an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is"
"made, it is the duty of the petitioner to place before the Court,"
"before it  issues notice in  the first  instance,  a  full  and  truthful"
"disclosure of all the material facts; the petitioner must act with"
"uberima fides.”"
