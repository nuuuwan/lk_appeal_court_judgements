"there  is  a  burden  cast  upon  the  Petitioner  to  prove  the  said  letter"
"before the Board, where the Petitioner failed to do so. Besides, it is"
"to be noted that there is a doubt created before Court that, if, P1 is"
"an  outright  transfer,  there  is  no  necessity  to  pay  an  additional"
"amount  of  Rs.  350,000/-  to  the  6th  Respondent  after  five  months"
"from the date of execution of P1."
"Having  considered  the  proceedings  adopted  and  the  totality of  the"
"evidence adduced before the Board, it appears to this Court that the"
"impugned  orders  are  not  contrary 
to  section  21  of 
the  said"
"Ordinance."
"In  these  respects,  it  is  apparent  that  the  determination  of  the  5th"
"Respondent  stating  that  the  deed  P1  was  executed 
for  a 
loan"
"transaction is justifiable."
"Furthermore, it is settled law that a party seeking prerogative relief"
"should come to Court with clean hands. The expression is derived"
"from one of Equity’s maxims - ‘He who comes to Equity must come"
"with clean hands.’"
"In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [1973] 77 NLR"
"13, it was held that,"
