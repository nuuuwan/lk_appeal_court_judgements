"same ordinance. Hence an accused who is  incarcerated under the said"
"act must furnish exceptional circumstances to obtain bail."
"In the instant application the exceptionality the petitioner has urged is"
"the  fact  that  since  the  officers  who  conducted  the  raid  is  currently"
"incarcerated  for  similar  offences  committed  while  on  duty  as  with"
"regard 
to 
the  productions  pertaining 
to 
their 
investigations, 
the"
"truthfulness  of  the  investigation  is  in  serious  doubt.  But  of  course  the"
"learned  High  Court  judge  has  disregarded  the  same  stating  that  they"
"were not accused of the instant case."
"Upon consideration of the submissions of both counsels it is very clear"
"that  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  state  the  previous  convictions,  which"
"this  court  is  unable  to  endorse.  This  court  also  observes  that  the  High"
"Court Judge has stated that the officers who conducted the raid being"
"accused 
in  other  cases  of  similar  nature 
is  not  a  ground 
for  the"
"petitioner to be enlarged on bail which this court does not see as being"
"very  correct  because  it  causes  a  serious  doubt  in  the  investigations"
"conducted  by 
these  officers  as 
to 
the 
truthfulness  of 
the 
same,"
"therefore  the  question  arises  whether  it  is  morally  correct  to  keep  an"
"accused 
in 
remand  until 
the  conclusion  of 
the 
trial  under 
those"
"circumstances."
"But on the other hand it has been decided by the previous benches of"
"this court that facts of the case need not be considered for bail. In the"
"instant case the law pertaining to the instant case calls for exceptional"
"reasons for a suspect or accused to be enlarged on bail."
