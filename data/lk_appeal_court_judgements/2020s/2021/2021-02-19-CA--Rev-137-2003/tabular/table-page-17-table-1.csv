"that no new claimants were present at the preliminary survey and and thus,"
"the  Petitioners  cannot  dispute  the  case  record  that  they  had  no  notice  of"
"the action. Mr. Metha has further submitted that the section 12 declaration"
"has been filed by the Plaintiffâ€™s Attorney-at-Law and thus, the Plaintiff has"
"complied with the section 12(1) of the Partition Law. Mr.  Sahabandu has"
"submitted that there was no proper compliance with section 12 (1) of the"
"Partition  Law.  He  has  submitted  that  it  is  clearly  manifested  from  the"
"conduct of the Plaintiff in not making the Petitioners, parties to the action"
"that  the  Plaintiff  had  acted  in  collusion  with  the  other  Defendants  and"
"obtained partition decree by fraud perpetrated on the Petitioners and their"
"predecessors-in-title."
