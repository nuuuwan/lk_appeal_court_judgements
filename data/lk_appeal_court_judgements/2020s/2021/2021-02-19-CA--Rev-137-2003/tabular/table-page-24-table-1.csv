"","“
The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite"
"","i
ndependent of and distinct from the appropriate jurisdiction of this"
"","Court. Its object is the due administration of justice and the"
"","correction of errors, sometimes committed by the Court itself, in"
"","order to avoid miscarriages of justice. It is exercised in some cases"
"","by a Judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved person who may"
"","not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that, unless"
"","t
he power is exercised, injustice will result. The Partition Act has"
"","not, I conceive, made any changes in this respect, and the power can"

be exercised in respect of any order or decree of a lower Court.”"
