"The learned Counsel for the Petitioners cited Somawathie vs. Madawala (1983 2 SLR 15"
"at p. 30, 31) in which Mr. R. B. Madawala who was entitled to the rights of the subject"
"matter on a deed of transfer had not made a party to the partition action. The Court has"
"held that as a result, a miscarriage of justice has been caused to Mr. Madawala. But in the"
"instant action as decided hereinbefore, the Petitioners cannot be considered as necessary"
"parties to the action, the authority cited by the learned Counsel has no relevance to the"
"instant action."
