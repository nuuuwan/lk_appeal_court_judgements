"T
he  position  therefore  is  that  if  a  necessary  party  is  not  made  a  respondent,  the"
"application  is  liable  to  be  dismissed  in  limine.  I  use  the  word  liable  as,  for  reasons"
"that I would advert to later, it is a decision that is within the discretion of Court that"
"must be exercised judicially having carefully considered the facts and circumstances"
"of each case."
"I
  shall  now  consider  the  factual  circumstances  of  the  first  objection  in  light  of  the"
"abovementioned authorities."
"A
re the members of the Working Committee before Court?"
"I
t is admitted by all parties that in terms of the Constitution of the UNP marked ‘P16’,"
"the power of disciplinary control in respect of the members of the UNP is vested with"
"its  Working  Committee.  It  is  further  admitted  by  the  Petitioner  that  the  decision"
"reflected  in  ‘P14’  has  been  taken  by  the  Working  Committee.  Therefore,  it  is  the"
"Working Committee that will be in a position to explain to this Court the basis of such"
"expulsion. As ‘P14’ is being impugned, the members of the Working Committee had"
"to  be  named  as  Respondents  to  this  application  and  are  necessary  parties  to  this"
"application."
"I
n  terms  of  Article  7  of  the  Constitution  of  the  UNP  marked  ‘P16’,  the  Working"
"Committee  of  the  UNP  consists  up  to  92  members 
including 
its  Leader,  Deputy"
"Leader, 
Assistant 
Leader,  General 
Secretary,  National  Organiser, 
Chairman,"
"Treasurer, and the other persons referred to in Article 7."
"A
t  the  time  this  application  was  filed,  the  Petitioner  had  named  the  2nd  –  34th"
"Respondents  as  constituting  the  working  committee  of  the  UNP.  By  naming  as"
"Respondents,  the  persons  whom  the  Petitioner  believed  were  members  of  the"
"Working  Committee,  it is  clear that the  Petitioner is not disputing the  fact that the"
"members  of  the  Working  Committee  are  necessary  parties  to  this  application."
"Although 
it  should  have  been  clear  to  the  Petitioner  that 
in  terms  of  ‘P16’  the"
"Working  Committee  consists  of  up  to  92  members  and  that  naming  32  members"
"appears  to  be 
insufficient,  it  does  not  appear  that  the  Petitioner  has  made  any"
"attempt to ascertain the names of the entire Working Committee prior to filing this"
"11"
