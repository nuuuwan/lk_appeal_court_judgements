"There is no evidence in the case in hand that Rev. Madawala Sunanada Thero who was"
"admittedly  the  first  Viharadhipathi  of  Sri  Sudharmaramaya  temple  had  appointed  any"
"particular pupil out of the line of pupillary as his successor for the management and the"
"title  to  that  temple.  The  uncontradicted  evidence  of  the  case  is  that  Rev.  Kodagoda"
"Pannasara Thero was the senior pupil of Rev. Madawala Sunanada Thero, Rev. Kodagoda"
"Pannananda Theroâ€™s senior pupil was Rev. Kombala Medhananda Thero and his senior"
"pupil  is  Rev.  Haupe  Somananda  Thero,  who  is  the  Plaintiff  in  the  case.  Therefore,  the"
"Court  can  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  succession  of  the  Viharadhipathiship  of  the"
"temple in dispute should be according to that line of succession."
"Under the above stated circumstances, I hold that the determinations of the learned District"
"Judge are according to the law and the facts of the case. Therefore, I affirm the impugned"
"judgement  dated  22.07.1996  of  the  learned  District  Judge  and  dismiss  the  appeal.  The"
"Defendant will pay Rs. 50,000/- to the Plaintiff as costs of this appeal."
