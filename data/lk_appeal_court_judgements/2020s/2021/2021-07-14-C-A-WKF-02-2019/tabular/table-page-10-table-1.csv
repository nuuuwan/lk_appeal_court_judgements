"The attention of this court is drawn to the fact that the  Petitioners failed to"
"produce the certificate filed by the Respondents in the Wakfs Tribunal, along"
"with their amended petition where they are obliged to do so."
"For  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  see  no  basis  to  interfere  with  the  order  of  the"
"Wakfs Tribunal dated 02.03.2019. Thus, the appeal is dismissed with costs,"
"fixed at Rs. 25,000/-."
"The Registrar is directed to dispatch the order to the Wakf Tribunal."
