"factor is evidenced by the letters marked Rll( a) and Rll(b) that have been appended"
"to the Respondent's statement of objections."
"Thus it becomes clear that any excess of production has always been with the written"
"approval granted to the Petitioner and it cannot be  contended that the Respondents"
"have  acquiesced 
in 
the  violation  or 
infringement  of 
the  maximum  production"
"capacity. It has to be pinpointed at this stage that the documents marked Rll(a) and"
"Rll(b) by which the  Respondents directed the  Petitioner to adhere  to  the limits on"
"production  on  multiple  occasions  have  not  been  disclosed  to  this  court  and  the"
"learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
contended 
that 
this 
amounts 
to 
a"
"suppression of material facts."
"In  fact  the  document  marked Rll(a)  reveals  that  the  required minimum  green  leaf"
"standard to manufacture made  tea  of good quality is  60%.  The letter makes it clear"
"that 
the 
leaf  quality  of 
the  Petitioner  is  below 
the  required  standard  and  the"
"document marked Rll(a) instructs the  Petitioner to improve  the leaf standards and"
"therefore his request for increase in capacity cannot be acceded to.  As I said before, it"
"is the Sri lanka Tea Board (Quality Standard of Green leaf) Regulation, No.2 of 2010"
"that imposes a minimum cap of green leaf standard to manufacture made tea of good"
"quality at 60% and the Regulation and the leaf Quality Inspection Report pertaining"
"to 
the 
to 
the  Petitioner's  factory  dated  09th  October  2019  have  been  annexed"
"statement of objection as Rll and R13."
"It is  quite clear that it is  the  Sri  lanka Tea  Board (SlTB)  which is vested with the"
"is 
authority 
to 
regulate 
the 
tea 
industry  and 
towards 
this  end, 
the  authority"
"responsible for setting in motion measures to ensure the supply of good quality green"
"leaf to all existing factories with the view to promoting high quality manufacturing of"
"tea.  In  the  course  of  the  argument,  this  court  heard  arguments  on  the  challenges"
"facing the tea industry, namely, the severe shortage of green leaf.  It was brought to the"
"notice of this Court that green leaf supplies to factories (registered tea manufactures)"
