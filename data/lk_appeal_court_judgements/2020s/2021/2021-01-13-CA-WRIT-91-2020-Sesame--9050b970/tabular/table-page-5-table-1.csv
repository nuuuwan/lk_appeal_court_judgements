"Lanka Tea Board for use i.n  manufacture of tea. The same regulation states in 3(b) that"
"every  such  manufacturers  such  as  the  Petitioner must ensure  that  the  green leaf  so"
"procured for  manufacture  should not  be  damaged  due  to  past harvest  operations  of"
"suppliers of such green leaf."
"A corresponding duty to endeavor to supply a minimum of sixty per centum (60%) of"
"green  leaf  in  conformity  with 
the  quality  standard  determined  by 
the  board  is"
"imposed  on  every  supplier  of  green  leaf  as  well. These  regulatory  controls,  as  one"
"could see, have been imposed as far back as 17'h December 2010 on all manufactures of"
"tea and supplier of green leaf, with the laudable objective of maintaining the standard"
"of Ceylon Tea (see R-12) and when the Petitioner seeks to impugn P9 (direction given"

"his conditions of registration which principally imposed a cap on his production and"
"the Petitioner was, like the other tea manufacturers, put on notice of this condition of"
"the  cap.  Therefore,  when  the  directive  is  given  in  P9  to  continue  to  maintain  the"
"quality of made Sri Lankan Tea as well as the cap on production, it cannot give rise to"

"By  way  of  their  Petition  dated  19,h  May  2020,  the  Petitioner  avers 
that  since  its"
