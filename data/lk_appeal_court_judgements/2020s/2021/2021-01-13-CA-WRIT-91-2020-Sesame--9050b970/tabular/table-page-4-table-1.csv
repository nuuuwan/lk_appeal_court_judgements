"the  tea  industry  is  quite  regulated  and  P7  and  P9  show  the  notices  that  the  tea"
"brokers  have  been  put  under  namely 
they  are  not 
to  accept 
tea 
from 
those"
"manufacturers  who  exceed  their  permitted  cap.  In  the  case  of  the  Petitioner  the"
"permitted cap is 170,000 kg of tea. If one looks at the table appended to P9, one could"
"see  several  manufacturers  who  have  been 
imposed  with  limitation  on  production"
"caps.  None  of  those  manufacturers  of  tea  are  before 
this  Court  challenging  this"
"prohibition on tea brokers. It is only this tea manufacturer (the Petitioner Company)"
"which is before this Court challenging P7 and P9."
"In respect of this Petitioner, the last increase on its maximum production capacity, as"
"could  be  seen  from  the  list  appended  to  P9, is  170,000  kg  of  manufactured  tea  as"
"opposed to  the previous 140,000 kg and the  Petitioner has  been  explicitly informed"
"that  it  should  adhere 
to 
the  approved  maximum  capacity  and  that  any  excess"
"production will fall foul of the relevant regulations-vide RUA  and RUB.  Even  though"
"P7 and P9 instruct the  tea  brokers, the  manufacturers  of tea  such as  the  Petitioner"
"have  also  been  made  aware of  these limitations but these  documents have  not been"
"brought  to  the  attention  of  this  Court  along  with  the  petition  giving  rise 
to  a"
"complaint by the Respondents that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression of material"
"facts."
"As I listed it above, one of the impugned documents P9 imposes a requirement among"
"many  that the manufacturer has to maintain good leaf percentage of 60% per cent. In"
"other words a tea manufacturer is  told not only  to  adhere to his maximum capacity"
"bur  also  to  maintain  this  green  leaf  requirement-vide  Gazette  No.l684/48  dated  17th"
"December 2010  (R12).  In fact Regulation 3 of R12  specifically instructs all registered"
"manufacturers  of  tea  and suppliers  of  green  leaf  as  raw  materials  to  registered  tea"
"factories."
"Regulation 3 specifically instructs the manufactures who operate a tea factory for the"
"production of made tea to ensure the procurement of a minimum of sixty per centum"
