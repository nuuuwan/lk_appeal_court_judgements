"of Lands steps regarding divesting had been called back, and a part of the compensation was paid,"
"and  Wimalasiri had accepted same."
"The Ministry of Land indicated that the law does not permit a divest once an award was made"
"under  section  17  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act.  However,  when  pursuing  document  P  22  (A),"
"Wimalasiri  had  withdrawn  his  request  for  divesting  and  further  requested  that  he  be  paid  the"
"compensation he was entitled to."
"The documents marked as 3R1(a), 3R1(b) and 3R1(c) proves that compensation had been paid to"
"Wimalasiri."
"By 3R1(a), LKR 500,000/- was paid on 2005.12.06"
"By 3R2 (b), LKR 800,000/- was paid on 2006.03.10"
"By 3R1 (c), LKR800,000/- was paid on 2006.04.10."
"Therefore, by 10th April 2006, Wimalasiri had been paid the total compensation of Rs. 2,100,000/-"
"for the land described as lot 1  of the preliminary plan No.  1537 and the state had become the"
"absolute owner."
"Therefore, Wimalasiri had no land to sell by the year 2011. Wimalasiri, when signing the deed,"
"had known that he had already accepted the total compensation and the land was not his to sell."
"The  Petitioners  argue  that  he  did  not  know  the  acquisition  as  the  land  registry  ledgers  did  not"
"disclose any entries regarding such transactions.  Facts regarding entries of the Land registry or"
"land being acquired cannot be discussed in the present case as the cause of action is different. By"
"10th April 2006,  all amounts  of money were paid, and by 2007, the acquisition processes were"
"completed. There is no argument that lot 1 of preliminary plan 1533 is state land."
"In Farook Vs Gunawardene, Government Agent Amparai1 , it is submitted that the Petitioner is not"
"required  to  have  been  given  a  hearing  before  issuing  the  quit  notice.  In  the  present  case,  the"
"Petitioner is not the legitimate owner of the land to which a quit notice is issued."
