"In  Wannaku  Arachchilage  Gunapala  vs  Attorney  General  2007  SLR,"
"Volume 1, page 273, it was held  “  Absence of cross examination of a prosecution"
"witness of certain facts leads to the inference of admission of that fact.”"
"I
n Sarwan Singh vs State of Punjab 220  AIC SC (111)3652 at  3655, 3656"
"it was stated ‘ It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent  has"
"declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination"
"it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.”"
"The learned trial judge has clearly stated in his judgment, that the evidence"
"of  PW  2  has  not  been  challenged    by  the  defence.  In  the  light  of  the  above"
"authorities, when the evidence of PW 2 is not challenged in cross examination, it"
"has to be concluded that such evidence is not disputed and thus accepted."
"I
t has been established by medical evidence that PW 2 suffered  injury to"
"his forehead area and that there was a compound depressed fracture of the left"
"frontal bone and that the CT Scan showed , Skull fracture, Brain Contusion,  and"
"Pneumocephalus. It is fair and just to consider this injury when his evidence   is"
"considered . PW 1 saw him walking, bleeding from head and initially he could"
"not answer her question as to who injured him, but later, after  mentioning the 4"
"names    of  some  appellants  he  had  fainted.  It  is  also  important  to  consider  his"
"evidence that  although he has recovered from his head injury, sometimes he has"
"loss of memory and  he could not continue  with his visits to the medical clinic"
"because of financial difficulties. Nonetheless, he had revealed the names of the"
"other assailants to the police. These facts have to be considered in the background"
"of his head injuries."
