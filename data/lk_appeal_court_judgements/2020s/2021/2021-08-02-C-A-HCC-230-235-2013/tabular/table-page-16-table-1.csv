"19.03.2004.  (page 226)"
"A
t one point PW 2 has testified mentioning  six names and what he stated"
"was ‘about’ seven people  were assaulting the deceased when he intervened. One"
"cannot  expect  him  to  be  counting  the  number  of people  who were  around  the"
"person being assaulted, in the given circumstances. Nonetheless, these 7 accused"
"have been identified in the evidence of PW 2   particularly in pages 132, 133 and"
"163."
"This is a criminal action. It is a trite fact that consequent to   investigations"
"of  any  incident,  persons  involved    are  identified  and  arrested.  Likewise  in  the"
"instant case it appears that the accused appellants have been taken in to custody"
"at various stages. Thereafter, it is the burden of the prosecution to prove its case"
"beyond reasonable doubt."
"PW 2 has testified about the presence of the accused at the scene of the"
"crime armed with clubs and two manna knives. It has been established by medical"
"evidence that the deceased had cut injuries as well as injuries from blunt trauma."
"It  has been  established  that  PW  2 has  cut  injuries.  Therefore,  the learned  trial"
"judge’s conclusion that on evidence, the accused had been instrumental in causing"
"bodily injuries to the deceased is well founded  and the trial judge has sufficiently"
"analysed and evaluated the evidence of the complicity of each accused appellant."
"On perusal of evidence it is apparent that on behalf of the accused,  several"
"contradictory  suggestions have been put to the prosecution witnesses, specially"
"when the time frame mentioned is considered.  In page 138 it had been suggested"
"that PW 2  was  involved  in an incident the previous night with Rizwi and Iqbal"
"attacking Liyakath in his house. Another suggestion was  that PW 2 and  Rizwi"
