"Another discrepancy that was highlighted by the Counsel for the appellants"
"was PW 1 stating she saw PW 2  walking towards where Rizmi was fallen and"
"from there she took him to the police station . However, contradicting it, PW 2"
"in  his  evidence  had  stated  that  after  being  assaulted,  he  slowly  walked  to  his"
"sister’s house where eventually he fainted."
"T
he  vital  issue  to  be  considered  is  how  the  incident    occurred    and  the"
"persons  involved in it, more than the place where she met the witness and   at"
"what point it was conveyed to PW 1. As stated above , it has been elicited that"
"PW 2  was bleeding from the head after being assaulted with a cutting weapon"
"and rational thinking or a photographic memory of the sequence of events cannot"
"be anticipated or expected in such circumstances. Thus, at which place or at what"
"point the names of the assailants was mentioned is not a material point in this"
"case."
"I
n Bhoginbhai vs State of Gujarat (1983) AIR SC 753 the Indian Supreme"
"Court  held  thus”  By  and  large  a  witness  cannot  be  expected  to  possess  a"
"photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident .It is not if as a video"
"tape is replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily a witness cannot be  expected"
"to recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession"
"or in a short time plan. A witness is liable to get or mixed-up when interrogated"
"later on.”"
"I
n H.K.K. Habakkala vs Attorney General 2010 BLR at page 102  it was"
"held  ‘if  contradiction  is  to  be  material  it  should  be  sufficient  to  create  a"
"reasonable doubt in the evidence of the witness concerned.’"
