"Another  omission  that  was  highlighted  (in  page  164  )  is  that  PW  2  has"
"failed to mention the names of 5,6, and 7 accused in the police statement. In page"
"162 in cross examination   PW 2    has stated that after being released from the"
"hospital  he  has  given  a  statement  to  the  police  regarding  the  incident  and"
"mentioned the names of  Liyakanth, Hariz, Ramiz , Rizwan, Naiser and Mansoor."
"T
he  contradictory positions referred to by the learned Presidents Counsel"
"do not affect the  root of the case and no doubt has arisen regarding the credit"
"worthiness of the prosecution witnesses by these contradictions and discrepancies"
"which cannot be considered as material contradictions in the given circumstances."
"T
hus, the learned trial judge’s conclusion that the contradictions were not"
"material  and  that  the  omission  did  not  affect  the  root  of  the  case  or  create  a"
"reasonable doubt in the case can be upheld in our considered view."
"Another ground of appeal contended by the Learned Presidents Counsel"
"for the appellants  is that the Dock Identification is bad in law."
"It  was  submitted  by  President’s  Counsel  Mr.Laduwahetty  that  although"
"PW 2  testified about 7 people assaulting  the deceased , the evidence does not"
"elicit  that  position.  It  is  apparent  that  the  names  of  the  accused  have  been"
"mentioned on two separate occasions. Initially only 4 names have been mentioned"
"by PW 2 to his sister while travelling in the three wheeler."
"From the police evidence it has been established that those 4 persons have"
"been taken in to custody on 17.11.2003 when they surrendered themselves to the"
"Police. (page 210), The 5th and the 6th accused have been taken into custody on"
