"","""No doubt Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance places the burden"
"","of proving a general or special exception on an accused in the event"
"","that  he  pleads  such  an  exception  and  the  Divisional  Bench  by  a"
"","majority of 6 to 1 declared in The King v James Chandrasekera 44"
"","N.L.R  97  that  the  standard  of  proof  of  these  exceptions  is  on  a"
"","balance of probabilities but there are a number of decisions that lay"
"","down the rule that such a burden does not exist where it is manifest"
"","from the evidence for the prosecution that the plea must be upheld-"
"vide  The  King  v  Sellammai","(1931)  32  N.L.R  351;  8  T.L.R  143."
"","Therefore, it follows that the burden of proof of an exception may be"
"","discharged not only by the evidence for the prosecution but also by"
"the evidence for the defence or both.",""
"","Courts  have  gone  to  the  extent  of  holding  that  even  if  the  accused"
"denies 
the  allegation 
in","toto,  mitigatory  circumstances  must  be"
"","considered  by  the  jury  if  the  evidence  unfolds  such  circumstances."
"","Thus, in The Queen v Sinnathamby (1965) 68 N.L.R 195 the Court of"
"","Criminal  Appeal  held  that  even  though  the  defence  was  a  total"
"","denial of the acts which caused the death, the judge was justified in"
"putting the question of insanity to the jury.""",""
