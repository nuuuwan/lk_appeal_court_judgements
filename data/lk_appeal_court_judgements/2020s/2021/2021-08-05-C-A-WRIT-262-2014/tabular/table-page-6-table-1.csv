"It  was 
further 
complained  by 
the  Petitioner 
that 
the  purported"
"disciplinary 
inquiry  was 
instituted  under  the 
influence  of  one  A.P."
"Gunathilake [i.e., Prosecuting Officer] who was the Administrative Officer"
"in the Chief Secretary’s office who has developed an animosity with the"
"Petitioner  while  he  was  serving 
in  the  same  office1.  Therefore,  the"
"Petitioner  submits  that  he  was  deprived  an  opportunity  of  fair  trial  as"
"preparing  charge  sheet  as  well  as  conducting  the  prosecution  by  an"
"officer who has an animosity with the Petitioner."
"It is well settled that every member of a tribunal that is called upon to try"
"issues  in  judicial  or  quasi-judicial  proceedings  must  be  able  to  act"
"judicially;  and  it  is  of  the  essence  of  judicial  decisions  and  judicial"
"administration  that  adjudicators  should  be  able  to  act 
impartially,"
"objectively and without any bias. In such cases the test is not whether in"
"fact  a  bias  has  affected  the  judgment;  the  test  always  is  and  must  be"
"whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend that a bias attributable to"
"a member of the tribunal might have operated against him in the final"
"decision of the tribunal. It is in this sense that it is often said that “justice"
"must not only be done but must also appear to be done” [vide R v. Sussex"
"Justices, ex parte McCarthy (1924) 1 KB 256]."
"As  correctly  observed  by  Ratnayake  J  in  Captain  Nawarathna  v.  Major"
"General Sarath Fonseka  and 6 Others [(2009) 1 Sri LR 190], where the"
"petitioner denies that rules of natural justice have not been complied with"
"and  the  respondents  assert  the  contrary,  a  petitioner  can  do  no  more"
"than deny the compliance with the rules of natural justice and the burden"
"is on the respondents to establish that rules of natural justice have been"
"complied by producing an acceptable record of proceedings. In the absence"
"of production of such a record of proceedings the Court would not have"
"any  option  other  than  to  accept  the  petitioner’s  version  that  there  has"
"been  procedural  impropriety  leading  to  a  denial of  the  rules  of  natural"
"justice."
