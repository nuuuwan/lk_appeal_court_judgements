"The petitioner says that, the 1st respondent has failed to consider the facts on grounds of justice"
"and equity and he has also failed to give reasons for the award granted. The petitioner further"
"states  that  certain  allowances  such  as  festival-advance-payments,  disaster-advance-payments"
"etc.  are  payments  subject  to  recovery  from  monthly  salary.  As  per  the  award,  these  advance"
"payments to be paid for the period from 29.07.2001 to 12.05.2011 are incorrect. The petitioner"
"further states that the 1st respondent has acted arbitrarily and has not exercised judiciously and"
"reasonably."
"It is my view that the 2nd respondent is not entitled for the festival-advance-payments and the"
"disaster-advance-payments, as it applies in a timely manner."
"The  petitioner  states  that  if  the  decision  of  the  1st  respondent's  award  is  implemented  it  will"
"cause a bad example to around 30,000 employees of the board and deteriorate the disciplinary"
"control of the petitioner-board. I do not agree with the said argument by the petitioner for the"
"reason being that, whenever there is enough evidence to prove any charge against an employee,"
"he could be found guilty and the employer could take disciplinary action against the said person."
"In the present case, the 2nd respondent was acquitted and discharged by the Magistrateâ€™s Court,"
"as there was no evidence against him."
"The petitioner further states that on the above premise the petitioner is entitled to invoke the"
"jurisdiction of this Court for issue of a writ of certiorari to quash the purported award of the 1st"
"respondent dated 2016.12.05 marked as P2."
"There  is  a  fundamental  question  as  to  the  areas  in  which  writs  of  certiorari  and  mandamus,"
"being  public 
law  remedies,  would 
lie. 
It 
is  clear  these  writs  come  within  the  purview  of"
"administrative law which is a branch of law that has been developed by courts for the control of"
"the  exercise  of  governmental  or  statutory  powers  by  mainly  public  authorities.  The  distinction"
"between the public law and private law, which is a concept of recent origin in English law but,"
"which  has  been  a  basic  concept  of  Roman  law  should  be  borne  in  mind  in  considering  this"
"matter. The distinction between public law and private law in Roman law (being the genus of our"
"common law) jus publicum and jus privatum - is clearly stated in institutes (1.1.4) by Justinian - R."
"W. Lee; in his work on the Elements of Roman Law (4th Edition page 35), states as follows with"
"regard to the division of Roman law to branches as public Law and private Law;"
"""This is the division which the Roman lawyers take as the primary line of cleavage in the"
"legal system. Public Law has regard to the Constitution of the Roman State. Private Law is"
"concerned with the interest of individuals."""
"The  classification 
is 
intelligible  and  convenient,  though  there  are  points  at  which  the  two"
"overlap. The first includes constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law and procedure and"
"jus sacrum. The second comprises those branches of law which regulate the relations of citizens"
"to  one  another, 
family 
law,  property,  obligations  and  succession.  The 
institute 
is  mainly"
"concerned  with  private  law.  It  ends  with  one  title  on  criminal  law.  which  belongs  to  the  jus"
"publicum."
