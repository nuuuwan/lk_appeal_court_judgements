"","should have been ruled out by the judge and not left to the jury as its"
"","probative  value  is  far  outweighed  by  the  prejudice  it  will  cause  the"
"","accused‚Äù."
"","In this case, a very high prejudice has caused to the Appellant due to  the"
"","reference  of  the  case  history  in  the  Medico-Legal  Report  of  PW01  by  the"
"","Learned High Court Judge in his judgment."
"[11]","In  the  second  ground  of  appeal  the  Appellant  contends  whether  the"
"","question of identity has been sufficiently dealt by the Learned High Court"
"","Judge in his judgment."
"","According to PW01 the incident had happened in a hotel where they went"
"","to  have  dinner  after  consuming 
liquor 
for  about 
five  hours.  PW01"
"","admitted that the deceased had consumed considerable amount of liquor."
"","In the cross  examination the PW01 had admitted that he failed to  inform"
"","police that there was a street light which was on at the time of the incident."
"","He  further  admitted  when  the  incident  had  happened  the  lights  of  the"
"","hotel had been switched off. He further added that he ran away from the"
"","place  of  incident  when  the  incident  occurred.  When  he  returned  to  the"
"","place  of  incident  the  lights  of  the  hotel  had  been  switched  off  and  the"
"","victim was not to be seen. He only met the deceased at the hospital after"
"","several hours."
"","The  police  officer  who  had  conducted  the  investigation  and  visited  the"
"","crime  scene  had  failed  to  note  about  the  existence  of  a  street  light  in  his"
"","investigation  notes.  He  only  referred  to  a  light  which  was  burning  in  a"
"","junction close to the Navy Camp."
"","The 
investigating 
officer 
of 
this 
case 
and 
the 
PW01 
had 
given"
"","contradictory  and  unreliable  evidence  with  regard  to  the  light  condition"
"","existed  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  This  uncertainty  could  have  been"
"","resolved,  had 
the  prosecution  called  other  witnesses  who  had  given"
"","evidence in the Non-Summary Inquiry."
