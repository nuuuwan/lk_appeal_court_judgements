"[09]","Although, PW1 stated that he knew the Appellant three to four years prior"
"","to the incident and he knew that the Appellant works for Sri Lanka Navy,"
"","but failed to reveal the name of the Appellant to the police and in the Non-"
"","Summary Inquiry. Further the incident had happened on 24/07/2011, and"
"","the  witness  had  for  the  first  time  mentioned  the  name  of  the  Appellant"
"","only before the High Court on 07/02/2018."
"","The  Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  submitted  that  during  the  cross"
"","examination  the  defence  was  unable  to  mark  a  single  contradiction  from"
"","the evidence of  PW1. Therefore, he submits  that  the Learned High Court"
"","Judge  has  correctly  admitted  the  evidence  of  PW1.  Although,  no  single"
"","contradiction was marked by the defence but has raised a very important"
"","omission which certainly affect the root of this case."
"[10]","In the judgment Learned High Court Judge has mentioned that the PW01"
"","in  the  short  history  to  the  doctor  had  clearly  described  the  happening  of"
"","the 
incident 
to 
the  doctor  who  had  examined  him  at 
the  Karapitiya"
"","Teaching  Hospital  on  25/07/2011.  This  has  prompted  the  Learned  High"
"","Court Judge to accept the evidence of PW01 as credible."
"","In this case, as the doctor who examined PW01 had gone abroad, relying"
"","on the Section 414(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code Act No. 15"
"","of 1979, the prosecution had called another doctor who had been named as"
"","PW13  in  the  indictment  to  give  evidence  on  the  Medico-Legal  Report  of"
"","PW01. PW13  while giving evidence had read out the short history of the"
"","report which had been heavily relied on by the Learned High Court Judge"
"","in his judgment. (Page 272 of the brief)"
"","The admissibility of recorded history in Medico-Legal Report as evidence"
"","in  criminal  trials  has  been  discussed  in  several  decided  cases.  In  Gamini"
"","Dolawatte V. Attorney General [1988] 1 Sri.L.R 221 held that:"
"","“While  a  Medico-Legal  Report 
is  admissible 
in 
evidence  under"
"","Section  414(1)  of 
the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  hearsay"
