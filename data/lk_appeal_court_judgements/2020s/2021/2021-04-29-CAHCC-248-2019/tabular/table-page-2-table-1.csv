"1.","The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted in"
"","the  High  Court  of  Ratnapura  for  one  count  of  Murder  punishable  in  terms  of"
"","section  296  of  the  Penal  Code.  After  the  trial,  the  appellant  was  convicted  as"
"","charged and was sentenced to death. Being aggrieved by the above conviction"
"","and the consequential sentence, the appellant preferred the instant appeal."
"2.","The only ground of appeal pursued by the learned counsel for the appellant was"
"","that the learned High Court Judge erred in law by his failure to follow section"
"","11  of  the  Judicature  Act  No.2  of  1978.  It  is  the  submission  of  the  learned"
"","counsel that, at the conclusion of the case in the High Court, the learned State"
"","Counsel  attempted 
to  rectify 
the  error. 
In 
terms  of  section  11(3)  of 
the"
"","Judicature Act, the jury option should have been offered to the appellant at the"
"","commencement of the trial and therefore, such irregularity cannot be rectified"
"","at a later stage, the learned counsel submitted."
"3.","Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  appearing  for  the  respondent  conceded  that"
"","the jury option had not been given to the appellant at the commencement of the"
"","trial in the High court. Inviting the attention of the Court to the proceedings in"
"","the  High  Court  dated  26.03.2019,  learned  DSG  submitted  that  when  it  was"
"","brought to the notice of the High Court Judge that the jury option had not been"
"","given to the accused, it was rectified with the consent of the defence counsel."
"","The defence counsel has accepted that the rectification was done, and therefore,"
"","the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  is  baseless,  the  learned"
"","DSG submitted."
