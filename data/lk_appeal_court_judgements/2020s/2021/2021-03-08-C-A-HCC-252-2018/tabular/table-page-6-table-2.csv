"","marked are incapable of creating a doubt on the prosecutrixâ€™s evidence."
"","Hence this appeal ground too has no merit."
"[09]","The next complaint of the Appellant is that the due consideration has not"
"","been  given  to  the  discrepancies  between  the  evidence  of  the  prosecutrix"
"","and the medical evidence."
"","Although the prosecutrix stated that she was unmarried and never had sex"
"","with  anybody,  the  medical  evidence  revealed  that  she  would  have  either"
"","engaged in sexual intercourse more than once  or could have inserted any"
"","tools  repeatedly  in  to  the  vagina  for  some  time.  The  learned  High  Court"
"","Judge  has  considered  this  discrepancy  in  detail  at  page  214-215  of  his"
"","judgment  and 
correctly  held 
that 
this  discrepancy  will  not 
lead 
to"
"","disbelieve in the evidence of the prosecutrix."
"","The  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  further  argued  that  if  the  version  of  the"
"","prosecutrix is true, she should have sustained more injuries on the back of"
"","her body than mere tenderness, that only in two places. Hence it is difficult"
"","to believe she did not sustain at least a small abrasion or a single contusion"
"","on the back side of the body."
"","On  perusal  of 
the  Medico-Legal  Report  of 
the  prosecutrix,  she  had"
"","sustained four painful injuries two on the back of the body and two on the"
"","back  of 
the 
fingers.  According 
to 
the  doctor  all 
these 
injuries  quite"
"","compatible with the history given to the doctor by the prosecutrix."
