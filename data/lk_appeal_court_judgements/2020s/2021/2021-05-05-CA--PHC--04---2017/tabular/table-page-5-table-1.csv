"In  the  instant  case  the  position  of  the  petitioner  is  that  the,  amendment  by"
"the learned magistrate in the charge is one of deletion of a name, and under"
"section 167 (3) of the CPC it does not amount to an alteration and if that is so"
"the accused should have been acquitted."

"set aside and the instant application for revision is allowed."
