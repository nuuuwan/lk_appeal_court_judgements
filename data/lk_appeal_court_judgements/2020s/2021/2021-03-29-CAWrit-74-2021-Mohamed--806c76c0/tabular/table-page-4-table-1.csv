"riyantha Jayawardena, J held as follows:"
"“While I agree with the submissions made by the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  Petitioner  that  every  power  must  be  exercised  by  the  authority  fairly,"
"reasonably  and  lawfully,  the  mere  fact  that  the  statement  of  witnesses  of  the"
"defence  has  not  been  recorded  as  claimed  by  the  Petitioner  cannot  make  the"
"decision of the Attorney General unsustainable. The Attorney General’s decision"
"to  indict  the  Petitioner  may  be  vitiated  if  a  conclusion  is  arrived  not  on  an"
"assessment of objective facts or evidence but on a subjective satisfaction. .... If"
"it 
is  found  that  there  was  evidence  before  the  Attorney  General  and  such"
"evidence had been considered by several officers of the said Department and a"
"final  decision  was  reached  by  the  Attorney  General  based  on  the  views  of  the"
"said  officers,  the  Superior  Court  would  not 
interfere  and  would  hesitate  to"
