"It is evident that the complainant personally known the accused-appellant for a period over"
"1 1/2 years and had done several financial transactions during that period. The complainant"
"is  a  businessman  who  sells  vehicles  imported  from  Japan  and  did  trade  in  Sri  Lanka.  The"
"accused-appellant is also a person who imports vehicles from Singapore and the complainant"
"had given money on several occasions to the accused-appellant as loans, expecting a profit or"
"a higher amount than what is given to the accused-appellant. When the accused-appellant"
"obtains money on such promise he has given a cheque to the loaned amount as a guarantee"
"to be kept with the complainant until such time the face value plus the additional amount as"
"profit or interest are repaid to the complainant."
"Witness  number  1  clearly  states  in  his  evidence  that  he  was  requested  not  to  bank  the"
"aforesaid  cheques  and  only  to  retain  them  as  a  guarantee  for  the  return  of  the  money."
"According to him during the past period, several such transactions have taken place and after"
"the payment of money as expected by him, the amount loaned plus additional amount, all"
"cheques  issued  and  kept  as  guarantees  had  been  handed  over  to  the  accused-appellant"
"without banking."
"Learned counsel for the accused-appellant argued that from the beginning of the trial, it was"
"contended  that  the  said  transaction  of  giving  money  was  purely  a  civil  transaction.  The"
"accused-appellant did not deceive the complainant. Therefore, there is no false pretence and"
"there exists no inducement to deliver the money to the accused-appellant as both of them"
"had  prior  consent,  prior  approval,  agreed  terms  and  agreed  on  an  amount  before  the"
"stipulated transactions in all the aforesaid counts in the indictment. Such transactions had"
"also  taken  place  between  the  same  parties  on  many  earlier  occasions  as  testified  by  the"
"complainant."
"appellant says that it is not possible to deceive the same person namely, witness number 1"
"on 21.02.2005, on 28.07.2005 and on 03.10.2005, three occasions repeatedly on the same"
"basis or pretext."
