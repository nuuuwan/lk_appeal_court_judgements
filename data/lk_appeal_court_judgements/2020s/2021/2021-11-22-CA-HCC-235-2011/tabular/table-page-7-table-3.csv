"“a person is said to cheat when he by deceiving another person fraudulently or dishonestly"
"induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to him or to consent that he shall"
"retain any property or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do"
"anything  which  he  would  not  do  or  omit  if  he  was  not  so  deceived  and  which  act  or"
"omission  causes  or  is,  likely  to  cause  damage  or  harm  to  that  person  in  body,  mind,"
"reputation or property.”"
