"wholeheartedly agree, particularly in view of the conclusion that I have reached in CA"
"(Writ)  Application  No.  398/2015  that  the  Petitioner  had  not  misrepresented  facts"
"and/or made false and inaccurate statements in his application."

his  brings  me  to  the  second  argument  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner,  which 
is 
that 
the  Petitioner  was  not  given  a  hearing  prior 
to 
the"
"appointment  of  the  1st  Respondent,  and  that  this  amounts  to  a  violation  of  the"
"principles  of  natural  justice  and  procedural  fairness.  I  shall  consider  this  argument"
"bearing in mind the peculiar circumstances of this application, which I have set out"
"earlier, and the fact that the appointment of the Petitioner has been kept intact."
"T
he Petitioner’s purported right to a hearing is based on his claim that had he been"
"given an opportunity to explain his case, and had he been provided an opportunity to"
"peruse  the  mark  sheets  of  the  1st  Respondent,  he  may  have  been  able  to  highlight"
"certain  discrepancies 
in  the  self  evaluation  of  the  1st  Respondent  and  thereby"
"demonstrate that he had obtained higher marks than the 1st Respondent. While one"
"candidate is not permitted to examine the mark sheet of another candidate, the fact"

"this  Court  to  speculate  on  what  may  have  been  if  such  an  opportunity  was  in  fact"
"given."

"Petitioner. I am in agreement with the views expressed by the Competent Authority"
"that  it  would  indeed  have  been  a  travesty  of  justice  had  the  appointment  of  the"
"Petitioner been set aside. I must also say that a withdrawal of the post of Professor"
"of Surgery from the Petitioner by the Council of the 195th Respondent in the above"
