"discussion of the source of these powers; presumably they are implied from the"
"tribunal’s statute.23"
"The  second  exception  to  the  rule  would  therefore  be  the  power  to  correct  an"

"In Akewushola v. Secretary of State for the Home Department,24 Sedley LJ held that"
"once the decision is made, “the maximum power must be to correct accidental errors"
"which do not substantively affect the rights of the parties or the decision arrived at.”"
"He proceeded to state that, “I do not think that, slips apart, a statutory tribunal – in"
"contrast to a superior court – ordinarily possesses inherent power to rescind or review"
"its own decisions.”"
