"LJ was interpreted as follows:"
"“
The use of the word “ordinarily” suggests that Sedley LJ thought that there may"
"be  situations  other  than  the  need  to  correct  accidental  errors  where  a  tribunal"
"could  re-visit  its  previous  decision,  but  he  did  not  say  what  they  might  be…In"
"short,  Sedley  LJ was  saying, I  think, that a tribunal’s power to re-visit a previous"
"decision  was 
limited  to  cases  analogous  to  the  slip  rule  40.1226  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Rules. The fact that the tribunal proceeded to determine the appeal in"
"ignorance  of  the  true 
facts  as  a  result  of  an  administrative  error  was  not"
"something  which  was  capable  of  being  corrected  by  something  akin  to  the  slip"
"rule. Sedley LJ was saying that ordinarily the only circumstance in which a tribunal"
"can re-visit a previous decision it made was in the case of an accidental error.”"
