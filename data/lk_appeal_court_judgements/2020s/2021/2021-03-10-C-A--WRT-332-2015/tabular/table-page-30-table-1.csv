"must be finality to a decision made by a public authority, and that the Council of the",""
"195th  Respondent  should  not  be  permitted  to  reconsider  an  issue  which  has  been",""
"determined six years ago. The issue that I must consider then is the finality that must",""

  would","like

the 
following 
passage 
from"
"Administrative Law by Wade & Forsyth16:",""
"","“It may be necessary to determine whether there is power to revoke or modify"
"","the decisions or orders of an administrative authority or tribunal. The question"
"","here is whether the authority itself has power to do this. This is different from"
"","the question whether some other authority has power to do so,  which may be"
"","affected by a statutory provision that the decision ‘shall be final’.”"
"H","aving said so, the authors proceed to state as follows:"
"","“In the interpretation of statutory powers and duties there is a rule that, unless"
"","the contrary intention appears, ‘the power may be exercised and the duty shall"
"","be  performed  from  time  to  time  as  occasion  requires.’  But  this  gives  a  highly"
"","misleading  view  of  the  law  where  the  power  is  a  power  to  decide  questions"
"","affecting  legal  rights.  In  those  cases  the  courts  are  strongly  inclined  to  hold"
"","that the decision, once validly made, is an irrevocable legal act and cannot be"
"","recalled or revised. The same arguments which require finality for the decision"
"","of courts of law apply to the decisions of statutory tribunals, ministers and other"
