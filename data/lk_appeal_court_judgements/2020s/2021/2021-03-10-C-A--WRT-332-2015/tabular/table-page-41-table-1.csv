"would  have been  ideal had  the  195th Respondent awaited  the  approval of  the  UGC"
"prior to issuing the letter of appointment to the 1st Respondent, the fact remains that"
"the UGC has approved the creation of an extra cadre chair."
"L
et  me  now  consider  the  aforementioned  first  and  second  issues.  It  is  true  that"
"vacancies were called in 2008 for one post. While the approval given by the UGC did"
"not  specifically  provide  for  the  backdating  of  the  appointment,  it  was  open  for  the"
"Council  of  the  195th  Respondent  to  decide  on  the  date  of  the  appointment.  In  my"
"view, a consideration of the said issues in the light of the facts and circumstances of"
"this application, which I have already discussed in detail, would demonstrate that the"
"decision of the Council of the 195th Respondent is not, if I may borrow the words of"
"Lord Diplock, a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted"
"moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to"
"be decided could have arrived at it.36"
"T
he final argument of the  learned  Presidentâ€™s Counsel for  the  Petitioner is  that the"
"184th Respondent, the Chairman of the UGC was biased towards him due to an old"
"professional  rivalry,  which  prompted  the  UGC  to  approve  the  creation  of  an  extra"
"cadre  chair.  When  one  considers  the  fact  that  the  decision  to  appoint  the  1st"
"Respondent  was  taken  by  the  Council  of  the  195th  Respondent  and  that  it  is  the"
"entire membership of the UGC that arrived at the decision to approve the creation of"
"an additional Chair, it is clear that this argument does not have any merit."
"I
n the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to the"
"relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs."
