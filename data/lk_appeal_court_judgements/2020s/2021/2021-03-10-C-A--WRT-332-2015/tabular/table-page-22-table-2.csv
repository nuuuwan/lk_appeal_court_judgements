"Others8, this Court, interpreting the provisions of Circular No. 916 held as follows:"
"“
The  use  of  the  words,  ‘a  final  decision  should  be  reached  by  the  Selection"
"Committee  following  the  guidelines  in  the  marking  scheme’  in  ‘R4’  makes  it"
"clear that the final decision of selection must be with the Selection Committee,"
"and  that  it  cannot  abdicate  the  powers  conferred  on  it,  by  merely  accepting"
"whatever  marks  allotted  to  a  candidate  by  either  the  Experts  Panel  or  the"
"Senate Appointed Panel.”"
