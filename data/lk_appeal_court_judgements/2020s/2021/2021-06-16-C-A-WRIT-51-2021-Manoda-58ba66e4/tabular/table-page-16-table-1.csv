"office of Chairman of the 6th Respondent Council. The result is that there is a vacancy"
"in  the  office  of  Chairman.  This  in  my  view  is  what  was  intended  by  the  legislature"

"the factual circumstances of this application are outside the scope of the proviso to"
"Section 178A of the Ordinance."
