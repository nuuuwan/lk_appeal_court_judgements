"The  Last  Order  in  question  dated  22.04.2016  (P17)  affirming  the  Final  Plan  No.1079,  had"
"resulted in with the entry of the Final Decree and provisions of Section 36A of the Partition"
"Law as amended by Act No.17 of 1997 and such Order gives rise to an appeal with the leave"
"of  the  Court  of  Appeal  first  had  and  obtained.  The  Petitioners  having  failed  to  make  such"
"Leave to  Appeal  application  to the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  in terms  of  Section  36A,  had"
"invoked the extraordinary and discretionary jurisdiction of this Court in Revision, canvassing"
"Order made as far back as 27.06.2002."
"The explanation provided by the Petitioners regarding their failure to make use of the right of"
"appeal, is that the Judgment of Court of Appeal ‘P11’ was binding on the District Court and"
"further  they  take  up  the  position  that  the  said  Judgment  ‘P11’  dated  29.07.2009,  is  ‘per"
"incuriam’."
"When the Plaintiff caused the preparation of Plan No. DC/C2/01 by Surveyor Patrick Fernando"
"on  15.08.2001,  the  access  road  from  the  Rajagiriya  Road,  did  not  extend  up  to  Lot  No.4"
"allotted to the 1st Respondent and Surveyor, Bellana’s Plan No.748, had indicated the said"
"access road up to Lot No.5 allotted to the 1st Respondent. The only question that came up for"
"adjudication before this Court was whether the provision of access from Rajagiriya Road to"
"the piece of land on West, allotted to the 1st Respondent was correct? The complaint of the"
"Petitioners was that since a public road namely, Raja Hewavitharana Road was bordering the"
"portion of the land of 1st Respondent on the West, access could be given from the same."
"The electricity, water and telephone lines to the 1st Respondent’s house had been supplied"
"along the access road from Rajagiriya Road and at the trial, the Plaintiffs never suggested that"
"1st Respondent should be provided access from the Raja Hewawitharana Mawatha, decided"
"not to interfere with the Order of the District Court dated 27.06.2002 (P9). The agreement at"
"the trial, reached between the parties to maintain the access to the houses of the Petitioners"
"and the 1st Respondent, from Rajagiriya Road should be treated as an admission from which"
"the Petitioners could not resile."
"Thus, it is apparent that the ratio of the said Judgment (P11) confined to the issues raised in"
"C.A.L.A.273/2002 and could not have trammelled the powers of the District Court to confirm"
"with or without modification the scheme of partition proposed by the Surveyor in terms of"
"Section 36 (1) (a) of the Partition Law as amended. Since the Petitioners in their objections"
"had  taken  up  the  position  that  the  Plan  No.748  of  Surveyor,  Bellana  was  violative  of  the"
"Regulations of UDA, they could have sought relief by way of Leave to Appeal from the Order"
"of the District Court dated 25.06.2013 (P14) and the Order dated 22.04.2016."
"In the circumstances the Judgment (P11) of this Court, was not ‘per incuriam’ and dealt with"
"only the matters urged in that case. The Petitioners being the ‘litis dominus’ in the case should"
"have been aware of the provisions of the law in Sections 26, 31, 32  and 36 of the Partition"
"Law as amended by Act No.17 of 1997 and the Petitioners seemingly oblivious of the said"
"provisions for their advantage, had been urging such grounds since 2013 without making use"
"of right of appeal available to them. The Petitioners are not entitled as of right to seek relief"
"by way of revision when they had failed and neglected to exercise the right of appeal provided"
"by law in the absence of a plausible and acceptable explanation."
