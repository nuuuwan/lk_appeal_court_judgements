"The Petitioners have preferred this application to revise the order of the District Court marked"
"“P9”, “P14”, “P17” and the Judgment of this Court marked “P11”. By the said orders of the"
"District Court and the Judgment of this Court, the Commissioner has been directed to prepare"
"the Final Scheme of Partition in terms of the Alternative Scheme of Partition tendered by the"
"1st Respondent marked “P8”."
"The Petitioners’ position was that, the said Alternative Scheme of Partition is contrary to the"
"written  law  regulating  the  sub-division  of  land  for  development  purposes.  Hence,  it  was"
"argued by the petitioner that the Final Scheme of Partition is prepared in terms of the said"
"Alternative Scheme of Partition, such Final Scheme of Partition will never be approved under"
"the  written  law  applicable  for  such  approval  and  the parties  would be deprived  of  getting"
"approval for the said Final Scheme of Partition and the parties would never be able to carry"
"out any development work forever."
"In the alternative Scheme of Partition marked “P8” the Court observed that, the access road"
"to the Lots 2, 3, 4 and 5 is shown as Lot 1. The extent of Lot 1 is 218.51 Sq. Meters and as the"
"maximum  width  is  12  Feet, the  length of the  road  access  shown  as  Lot 1  is  more than  50"
"Meters. However, the petitioner argued that as it is between 10-12 feet, the length of the"
"road should be more than 59.21 Meters."
"There is no turning circle at the end of the road way. The petitioner says that the extent of"
"the  Lots  2  and  3  are  68.28  Sq.  Meters  (2.7  Perches)  and  50.58  Sq.  Meters  (2  Perches)"
"respectfully.  The  preliminary  plan marked  “P3  (i)”,  which  clearly  describes  that  the  land  is"
"situated within the municipal limits of Kotte Municipal Council. It is a common fact in this"
"case. Under the Gazette dated 30.09.1978 marked “P18 (i)”, the Kotte Urban Council (as it"
"then  was)  has  been  declared  as  an  Urban  Development  Area  under  Section  3  of  Urban"
"Development Authority Act as amended."
"The Gazette dated 10.03.1986 marked “P18(ii)” which consists of the Regulations made under"
"Section 21 read with Section 8 of the Urban Development Authority Act as amended. The said"
"Regulations are applicable to all the areas those have been declared under the said Act as"
"“Urban  Development  Areas”  in  terms  of  Regulation  2  of  the  said  Regulations.  The  said"
"Regulation 2 is read as follows;"
"“අමාත්‍යවරයා විසින් ගැසට් පත්‍රයේ පළ කරනු ලබන නියේදනයක් මගින් නාගරික සංවර්ධන"
"ප්‍රයේශයක් බවට ත්‍ත් කාලයේ ප්‍රකාශයට පත් කරනු ලබන සෑම ප්‍රයේශයක් සදහාම යේ නියයෝග"
"වල විධිවිධාන අදාළ වන්යන්ය.”"
"The  said  Regulations  are  applicable  to  Sri  Jayawardanapura  Kotte  Municipal  Council  Area"
"where the subject matter of the present Partition Action is situated. These Regulations are"
"applicable  for  obtaining  for  sub-division  of  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  or  to  obtain"
"Development Permits and carry out Development Work in the said land. These Regulations"
"are  the  written  law  relating  to  the  sub-division  of  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  for"
