"In  the  above  context,  the  final  two  sentences,  “It  would  be  different  or"
"invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of oral hearing. If"
"that be so it is time barred.”, constitute a conditional observation by Their"
"Lordships. Its nature is hypothetical, and does not reflect the facts of the"
"case,  as  the  time  period  did  not  exceed  two  years  from  the  date  of  oral"
"hearing.  In  other  words,  if  these  two  sentences  were  taken  out  of  the"
"judgement,  there  would  be  no  change  whatsoever  either  to  the  line  of"
"reasoning in Mohideen, or to the outcome. Therefore, though it was argued"
"by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  that  these  two  sentences  are"
"plainly relevant in deciding the instant case, they do not form part of the"
"ratio in Mohideen."
"I  therefore  consider  that the  hypothetical  conclusion  arrived  at  by  Their"
"Lordships in Mohideen is indeed “unnecessary to the decision in the case”."
"Therefore,  in  keeping  with  the  definition  I  have  provided  above,  and  in"
"agreement  with  Their  Lordships  who  have  pronounced  the  decision  in"
"Stafford Motors, it is my view that the particular statement in Mohideen (as"
"reproduced and emphasised on above) is indeed obiter dictum."
"Another argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Appellant is"
"that the decision in Stafford Motors is per-incuriam, as it was based on the"
"erroneous conclusions that, a) the decision in Mohideen is obiter, and b)"
"that  the  time  limits  presented  in  Section  10  of  the  TAC  Act  are  not"
"mandatory. Accordingly, he contended that the decision in Stafford Motors"
"is not binding."
"Before adverting to the issue as to whether the decision is per-incuriam or"
"not, I will briefly consider the definition and the legal application of the"
"rule of per-incuriam."
"L.B. Curzon’s A Dictionary of Law defines the concept of per-incuriam as"
"follows:16"
"‘Through want of care. A mistaken decision of a Court. (…) Application of"
"the  doctrine  should  be  made  only  in  the  case  of  “decisions  given  in"
"ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of"
"some authority binding on the court concerned” (…) (emphasis added).’"
