"client/person outside Sri Lanka. Falling specifically under Section 7 (1) (c)"
"is the issue of whether the Appellant’s services are consumed or utilised"
"outside Sri Lanka. These two issues will now be addressed together."
"According to the Appellant’s written submissions, the Appellant facilitates"
"the service of exporting travel reservation data from Sri Lanka to Amadeus"
"Global Distribution System. These services are provided to AIPL, an entity"
"located overseas."
"In my view, the decision on the above two issues considerably depends on"
"the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement between AIPL and"
"ALANKA and also, upon the Subscriber Agreement between ALANKA"
"and one of its subscribers, namely Global Holidays (Pvt) Ltd. (at page 183"
"of the brief)."
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that the TAC had failed"
"to understand the essence of the agreements when it held that ALANKA is"
"an  agent  of  AIPL  and  the  payments  received  by  ALANKA  from  AIPL"
"constituted the sharing of profits, which he contended is not supported by"
"evidence."
"The learned Senior State Counsel contented that ALANKA is a subsidiary"
"of AIPL, or in the alternative, an agent."
"Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘subsidiary’ as:21"
"‘subordinate; under another's control.’"
"For ALANKA to be a subsidiary of AIPL, the former would have to be"
"under  the  control  of  the  latter.  Other  than  the  fact  that  the  Distribution"
"Agreement  has  been  signed  on  behalf  of  ALANKA  and  AIPL  by  two"
"directors  having  the  same  surname,  which  raises  some  curiosity  as  to"
"whether both companies are controlled by one family, no other evidence is"
"available to support the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel that"
"ALANKA is a subsidiary of AIPL."
"Nevertheless, according to Black’s Law Dictionary,22 an ‘agent’ is:"
"‘one who is authorized to act for or in place of another; a representative.’"
