"Halsbury’s  Laws  of  England  describes 
the 
rule  of  per-incuriam  as"
"follows:17"
"‘A decision is given per-incuriam when the Court has acted in ignorance"
"of a previous decision of its own or of a Court of co-ordinate jurisdiction"
"which covered the case before it, in which case it must decide which case"
"to follow; or when it has acted in ignorance of a House of Lords decision,"
"in which case it must follow that decision; or when the decision is given in"
"ignorance of the terms of a statute or rule having statutory force (emphasis"
"added).’"
"The 
following  definition  has  been  given  by  His  Lordship 
Justice"
"Basnayake (as His Lordship then was) to the term per-incuriam, in the case"
"of Alasupillai v. Yavetpillai:18"
"“A decision per-incuriam is one given when a case or statute has not been"
"brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Court  and  it  has  given  the  decision  in"
"ignorance or forgetfulness of the existence  of that case or that  statute"
"(emphasis added).”"
"Further,  His  Lordship  Justice  Soza, 
in 
the  above-mentioned  case  of"
"Ramanathan  Chettiar  v.  Wickramarachchi  and  Others,  re-produced  the"
"following paragraph from the treatise Precedent in English Law by Prof."
"Rupert Cross,19 which explains the rule of per-incuriam thus:"
"“The principle appears to be that a decision can only be said to have been"
"given per-incuriam if it is possible to point to a step in the reasoning and"
"show that it was faulty because of a failure to mention a statute, a rule"
"having statutory effect or an authoritative case which might have made the"
"decision different from what it was (emphasis added).”"
"I now advert to the issue as to whether the decision in the case of Stafford"
"Motors is per-incuriam."
"Whilst applying the above legal principals, I find that Their Lordships in"
"Stafford  Motors  have  considered 
the  earlier  decision 
in 
the  case  of"
"Mohideen. Of course, Their Lordships have declined to follow the latter"
