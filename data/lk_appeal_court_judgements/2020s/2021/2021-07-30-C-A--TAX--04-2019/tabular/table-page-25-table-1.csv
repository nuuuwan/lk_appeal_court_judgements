"may provide a wide variety of services, to both local and foreign clients,"
"and have only those services it provides to foreign clients and which fulfil"
"the  other  criteria  set  out  in  the  above  section  be  exempted  from  the"
"applicable tax. This is plainly not the case for Section 7 (1) (b) (vi) of the"
"VAT Act, which is much more narrowly defined. Finally, it has already"
"been established that ALANKA provides some, if not all, of its services to"
"local subscribers."
"For  the  above  reasons  and  after  having  considered  the  facts  of  the  two"
"cases,  I  hold  that  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  Aitken  Spence  is  not"
"sufficiently  analogous 
to 
the 
instant  appeal,  and  distinguish 
the  said"
"decision from the instant appeal."
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant went to great lengths to stress the"
"fact that ALANKA only receives payments from AIPL and not from any"
"of its own subscribers, and that this should lead to the inference that it is"
"AIPL 
to  whom  ALANKA  provides 
its  services.  Then 
the  pertinent"
"question arises as to why ALANKA receives payments from AIPL, if the"
"services  are  provided  to  the  subscribers  in  Sri  Lanka  and  utilised  in  Sri"
"Lanka."
"As clause 7.2 of the Subscriber Agreement reads, subscribers make their"
"reservations for fares. Hence, it is obvious that subscribers will have to pay"
"for those fares through AMADEUS GDS, either at the time of reservation"
"or as a subscription. Therefore, it is incontrovertible that the payment for"
"the services provided by ALANKA has to be reimbursed by its principal"
"AIPL."
"Hence, it is my considered view that the mere fact that it is AIPL, and not"
"the 
subscriber, 
that  makes  payments 
to  ALANKA,  cannot  be 
the"
"determinative criterion in deciding whether ALANKA provides its services"
"to AIPL or to the subscriber in Sri Lanka. In any case, it is not a requirement"
"of either Section 7 (1) (b) (vi) or 7 (1) (c) that the payment has to be made"
"by  the  person  who  receives  the  service.  It  is  also  not  the  case  that  the"
"reverse, i.e. that if a person has made the sole payment, they then become"
"the sole person  to whom  a  service  has been provided,  necessarily holds"
"true."
"It  is  also important  to  note that the  Appellant’s submissions  contain the"
"following  clause  (at  page  13  of  the  Appellant’s  consolidated  written"
"submissions):"
