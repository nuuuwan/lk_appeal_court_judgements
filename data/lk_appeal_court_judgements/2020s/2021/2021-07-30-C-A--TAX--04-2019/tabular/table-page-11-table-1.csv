"of  the time  limit  applicable  to  a  Fundamental  Rights petition before the"
"Supreme Court of Sri Lanka:"
"“These provisions confer a right on the citizen and a duty on the Court. If"
"that right was intended to be lost because the Court fails in its duty, the"
"Constitution would have so provided. It has provided no sanction of any"
"kind in case of such failure. To my mind, it was only an injunction to be"
"respected and obeyed, but fell short of punishment if disobeyed. I am of the"
"opinion  that  the  provisions  of  Article  126  (5)  are  directory  and  not"
"mandatory.  Any  other  construction  would  deprive  a  citizen  of  his"
"fundamental right for no fault of his (emphasis added).”"
"Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship then was) made a similar observation in"
"the previously cited case of K. Nagalingam v. Lakshman de Mel,7 regarding"
"an  order  made  by  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  after  the  expiry  of  a"
"statutory time limit:"
"“To hold that non-compliance with the time limit stipulated by section 2"
"(2) (c) renders the Commissioner's order of approval - or refusal void will"
"cause grave hardship to innocent parties. Parties who have done all that"
"the  statute  requires  of  them  should  not  lose  the  benefit  of  the  order"
"because it was made after the final hour had struck with the passage of the"
"3 months (emphasis added).”"
"I find that Their Lordships’ comments are relevant to the instant case, in"
"illustrating the injustice that either party could suffer if the TAC were to be"
"deemed 
functus  officio  upon  expiry  of 
the 
time 
limit 
in  question."
"Furthermore,  where  an  appeal  has  been 
lodged  before 
the  TAC, 
it"
"necessarily  follows  that  the  appellant  would  only  have  done  so  with"
"significant confidence in a positive outcome. If that be so, there would be"
"no need for the appellant, upon the expiry of the time limit, to demand that"
"the  determination  of the  TAC  be time  barred,  since  there  would  still  be"
"every  chance  of  their  appeal  being  successful  and  no  fundamental  right"
"would be violated owing to the delay. Even if some other significant right"
"were to be infringed upon, it would not weigh so heavily as to vitiate the"
"right of either party to receive a considered determination from the TAC."
"It 
is 
therefore 
the  opinion  of 
this  Court 
that 
there 
is  no  statutory"
"construction  whereby  either 
the 
tax

the  appellant  or
