"It  was  also  contended  by  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the"
"alleged statement ""අර පකාල්ලා මට පිහිපෙන්ට ඇන්ටනා""is not admissible as a dying"
"declaration, as that statement should relate to the death of the deceased"
"and  in  the  given  circumstances  of  this  case,  as  the  deceased  was"
"suffering from a heart ailment the cause of death was not proved beyond"
"reasonable  doubt.  As  stated  earlier  in  this  judgment  this  Court  has"
"affirmed the conclusion of the trial judge that death was caused by the"
"injury  inflicted  by  the  accused,  who  is  the  person  referred  to  as    ""අර"
"පකාල්ලා"" therefore, the argument of the Presidents Counsel on this point"
"also fails."
