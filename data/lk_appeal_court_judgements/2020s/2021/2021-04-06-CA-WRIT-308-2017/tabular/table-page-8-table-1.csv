"On behalf of the Petitioner the main argument put  forward was that a hearing should"
"have been given to the Petitioner prior to the decision embodied in P14 and R3 was taken"
"and  since  such  hearing  not  accorded  the  letter  marked  P14  and  R3  was  unreasonable"
"arbitrary and ultra vires."
"During the course of the oral Submission on behalf of the Petitioner, the Learned Counsel"
"relied on a case bearing No.959-1999 (Writ) and decided on 01-12-2003."
"While expressing unreserved agreement with the views expressed by His Lordship Justice"
"Sripavan (as he then was) the factual matrix of the said case can be distinguished from"
"the  facts  of  the  instant  Writ  Application  concerning  the  Petition.  In  the  instant  Writ"
"Application, the Petitioner had applied for the residence Visa under a specific category"
"and which was, as submitted, so to make himself available in a pending court case in the"
"Magistrate’s Court (MC) of Nuwara-Eliya.  However, the dispute that brought about the"
"said  case  was  resolved  and  the  activity  of  surveying  that  the  Petitioner  had  objected"
"initially was also carried out without any demur on the part of the Petitioner, and the"
"proceedings of the MC case were laid by as a result by the Police."
"Thus, I believe that the Petitioner could not take up the position that he had entertained"
"a 
legitimate  expectation  that  he  would  have  been  granted  the  requisite  extension"
"because at the point of time the letter P14 and R3 was issued to him, he himself knew"
"very well, that there was no “live” and “pending” case against him in the Magistrate’s"
"Court of Nuwara-Eliya as such there was no plausible reason to given a hearing to the"
"Petitioner as the documents made available to the Respondent by the Police revealed the"
"necessary  details  sufficiently  and  adequately  to  enable  the  Respondent  to 
issue  a"
"response to the Petitioner’s Residence Visa extension in the form of P14 and R3."
"On  the  other  hand,  the  facts  of  the  aforesaid  writ  case  bearing  No.959-1999  that  the"
"Petitioner’s relied on was hinged upon a letter received by the Controller of Immigration"
"and  Emigration 
from  the  Department  of  State 
Intelligence  to  the  effect  that  the"
"Petitioner’s marriage was a sham and that it was a marriage contracted for convenience."
"The finding of the Court of Appeal in that case was that the Petitioner, should have been"
"given  an  opportunity  before  the  cancellation  of  the  Residence  Visa  to  provide  a"
"explanation to the contents on the said letter which had been solely relied upon by the"
"Controller  of 
Immigration  and  Emigration  to  arrive  at  the  decision  to  cancel  the"
"Petitioner’s Residence Visa.  This can be true and should have been done in the contract"
"of the factual matrix of the said case as the contents of the particular letter should have"
"been evaluated on the basis of a perusal of the contract of marriage of the Petitioner and"
"the Petitioner’s explanation to the allegation."
