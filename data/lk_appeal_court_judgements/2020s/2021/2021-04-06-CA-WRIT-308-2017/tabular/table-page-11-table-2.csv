"such a case, a foreign alien has no right- and I could add, no legitimate expectation-"
"of being allowed to stay…”"
"However, having regard to the factual circumstances of the instant Writ Application, the"
"Petitioner  had  been  informed  by  letter  P14  as  to  why  the  Residence  Visa  issued  and"
"granted to him had been cancelled or revoked prior to the expiry date. The contents of"
"P14  and  R3  which  are  reiterated  to  be  self-explanatory  having  regard  to  the  Category"
"under which the extension of the Residence Visa was granted to the Petitioner. It is not"
"disputed by the Petitioner that the sole purpose for which he obtained the extension on"
"the  temporary  Residence  Visa  was  as  a  means  of  facilitation  to  appear  before  the"
"Magistrate’s Court of Nuwara-Eliya in the case bearing No.77882/17."
"When the said case had been revealed and informed to be laid by the Learned Magistrate"
"without  fixing  any  further  date  for  calling  of  the  said  case,  further  continuation  and"
"remaining on the island for the Petitioner till end of the expiry does not arise thereafter."

"It is seen that a reasonable expectation for an audience or a pre-hearing to be accorded"
"to a foreign national depends on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. In"
"the instant case, it is the attendant facts do not vindicate such a pre-hearing should be"
"accorded  to  the  Petitioner  prior  to  the  decision  taken  by  the  Controller  to  cancel  the"
"Residence Visa by P14 and R3 as the sole purpose for which the extension was granted"

"Hence it could be concluded that when reasonably and logically evaluating the attendant"
"facts of this case, there is no absolute necessity to accord a hearing to the Petitioner, and"
"even  if  assumed  without  conceding  that  such  a  hearing  were  to  be  accorded  to  the"
"Petitioner, there was no room for a decision differently to that as reflected in P14 and R3"
