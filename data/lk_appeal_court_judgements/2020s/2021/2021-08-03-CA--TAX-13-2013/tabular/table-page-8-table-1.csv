"The  same  view  had  been  expressed  by  Lord  Pearce  in  the  case  of  B.P."
"Australia  Ltd  v  Commissioner  of  Taxation  of  the  Commonwealth  of"
"Australia cited by the leaned Counsel for the Appellant. In that case, Lord"
"Pearce commenting on the criteria expressed by Lord Cave in Atherton’s"
"case states thus,"
"“those words are useful as an expression of general principle on prima facie"
"indications, but the benefit in the particular case was the foundation of a"
"fund that would endure for the whole life of the Company and provides no"
"analogy to the present case.”"
"The Commissioners in the Tax Commission have observed as follows. “Thus"
"the  Appellant  argued  that  the  reimbursement  was  made  with  a  view  of"
