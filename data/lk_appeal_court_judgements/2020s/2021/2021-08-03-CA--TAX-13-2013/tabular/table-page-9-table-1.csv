"reduction) incurred by the Appellant on a recurring basis. But for January,"
"as there was no price adjustment, this sum was reimbursed. Therefore, it"
"was submitted that in “substance” this was incurred by the Appellant on a"
"recurring basis although in “form” it was a reimbursement and not a price"
"adjustment.  It  was  further  submitted  that 
it  was  not  disputed  at  the"
"hearing  that  in  “substance”  the  effect  was  the  same  on  the  retailers."
"Quoting a passage from the judgment of Lord Atkinson in Atherton’s case"
"the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submitted  that  “substance”  will"
"always prevail over the “form”. In Atherton’s case, Lord Atkinson had cited"
"the  judgment  of  Royal  Insurance  Company  Vs  Watson  (1897)  A.C.  1  in"
"which  case  the  Royal  Insurance  Company  had  purchased  and  acquired"
"from the Queen’s Insurance Company their whole undertaking which was"
"regularly 
transferred 
to 
the  purchasing  company. 
In 
the  agreement"
"entered into between the two companies for this purpose, it was provided"
"that  the  purchasing  company  should,  until  the  transfer  was  completed,"
"retain 
in  their  service  the  former  manager  of  the  Queen’s 
Insurance"
"Company  at  a  salary  of  £  4000  per  annum.  Liberty  was  reserved  to  the"
"purchasing  company  to  commute  this  salary  by  payment  of  a  bulk  sum"
"calculated on the basis of certain tables in the agreement. The Appellant"
"commuted this salary  by payment of a sum of  £ 55,8468. The Appellant"
"Company contended that they were entitled, in fixing the amount of their"
"liabilities to assessment for income tax to deduct this large sum from the"
"gains and profit for the year in which payments had been made. It was held"
"that this large sum of money was “in reality” a part of the consideration to"
"be  paid  by  the  purchasing  company  to  the  vending  company  for  the"
"transfer  by  the 
latter  to  the  former  of  the 
latter’s  business  and  was"
"therefore money employed as capital within the meaning of the aforesaid"
"rule 3. Lord Atkinson had looked into the substance of the transaction over"
"the mere form of it. In Sir Wroth Periam Christoper Lethbridge Baronet Vs"
"Attorney General, Lord Atkinson had stated thus “it has many times been"
"decided that in dealing with questions arising on the finance act of 1894"
"and the succession duty acts regard should be had to the substance of the"
"transactions  on  which  these questions  turn  rather  than  to  the  forms  of"
"conveyancing which the parties to them may have adopted to carry out"
"their objects”."
