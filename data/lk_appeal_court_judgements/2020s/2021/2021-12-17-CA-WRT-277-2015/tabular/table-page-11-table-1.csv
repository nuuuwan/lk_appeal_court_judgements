"of the land so  vested by the vesting order. The vesting order referred to is that"
"made under Section 38. It is clear from the papers filed in the previous application"
"that  there  was  one  vesting  order  in  respect  of  the  entire  extent  of  12  acres."
"Therefore, I am inclined to agree with the submission of Learned Counsel for the"
"Respondents that the divesting was to relate to the entire extent covered by the"
"vesting order. This view is further supported by Section 39A (4) (a) which provides"
"that upon a divesting order that land shall be deemed never to have vested in the"
"State  by  virtue  of  the  vesting  order.  Hence  what  is  contemplated  is  a  complete"
"reversal of the status quo ante and not a piece-meal divesting of particular portions"
"of  a  land  that  is  vested.‚Äù This  view was  endorsed by Dr. Ranaraja  J  in  Mendis  v"
"Jayaratne, Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Forestry 1997 2 SLR 215."
"For  the  aforementioned reasons,  we  are  of  the view  that  the  application  of  the"
"Petitioner for a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus must necessarily fail."
"Therefore, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner. I make no order for costs."
