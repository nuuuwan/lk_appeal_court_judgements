"and paternal inheritance) from late Peiris Amarasekara the deceased husband of"
"the 1st named donor and the father of the other donors. The Petitioner appears to"
"be a son of Peiris Amarasekara as he is referred to as the son of the 1st donor and"
"the brother of the other donors. If it is so  one can expect the Petitioner also  to"
"inherit an undivided share from his deceased father. But it is not the case of the"
"Petitioner. The case of the Petitioner is that he acquired rights in the land upon the"
"deed of gift marked P1. Even if the Petitioner had inherited an undivided right in"
"the land on paternal inheritance it is always possible for him to dispose that right"
"prior  to  the  execution  of  P1  and  that  right  can  devolve  on  one  of  the  donors"
"subsequently. The Petitioner does  not say that he had an undivided right in the"
"corpus at the time of the acquisition and he does not speak of paternal inheritance."
"According  to  the  averments  in  paragraph  1  of  the  petition  the  Petitioner  had"
"acquired the entirety of the rights of the property upon P1 and prior to that the"
"donors of the deed owned the entire rights in the land. The Petitioner did not have"
"any rights in the property. However the Petitioner had acquired those rights after"
"the acquisition process commenced. The deed marked P1 had been executed on"
"1st of October 2003. According to 2R1 notice under section 5 of the Land Acquisition"
"Act had been published in the Gazette on 9th April 1996 more than 7 years prior to"
"the execution of P1. Therefore no title to the land will accrue to the Petitioner upon"
"the deed of gift marked P1. Therefore the Petitioner does not have a legal right to"
"ask for writ of Mandamus and does not have a locus standi to make this application."
"Therefore this application must necessarily fail."
"The learned counsel for the Petitioner has cited the judgement of Somawanti Vs."
"State of Punjab (:1971 AIR 1033 1971 SCR (3) 871 1971 SCC (1) 71). In that case the"
"Supreme Court of India held as follows,"
"“If  the  purpose  for  which  a  land  is  being  acquired  by  the  State  is  within  the"
"legislative competence of the State a declaration of the Government will be final,"
"subject  to  the  exception  that  if  there  is  colourable  exercise  of  power  of  the"
"declaration will be open to challenge at the instance of the aggrieved party. If what"
"the Government is satisfied about is not a public purpose but, for instance, a private"
"purpose or no purpose at all, the action of the Government would be colourable"
"……….  and  the  declaration  would  be  a  nullity  .  .  .  .  .  for  the  question  whether  a"
"particular act is a fraud or not is always justiciable. An acquisition could be set aside"
