"the  premise  that  a  trial  judge  has  a  duty  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  his  decision  that"
"facilitate review, accountability and transparency."
"It was held  by  the  Canadian  Supreme  Court  in R V  Sheppard  [2002]1  S.C.R.  869  that  “  the"
"appellate court is not given the power to intervene simply because thinks the trial court did a"
"poor job at of expressing itself” in fact the duty goes no further than to render “ a decision"
"which having regard to the particular circumstances of the case is reasonably intelligible to"
"the parties and provides the basis for meaningful appellate review of the correctness of the"
"trial judge’s decision” In the words of the Supreme Court, to quash a decision on the basis of"
"inadequacy  of  reasons  “  the  appellant  must  show  not  only  that  there  is  deficiency  in  the"
"reasons but that this deficiency has occasioned prejudice to the exercise of his or her legal"
"right to an appeal in a criminal case”"
"In the present case the Learned Trial Judge has arrived at the decision subsequent to analysing"
"the entirety of evidence presented at the trial inclusive of the sole eye witness account, dock"
"statement  and  circumstantial  evidence  relating  to  the  incident.  Therefore,  the  allegation"
"levelled against the judgement of the Learned Trial Judge fails to hold any water."
"The third, fourth and fifth contentions by the Counsel for the Appellant revolves around the"
"overall burden of proof in a criminal trial and the onus of proving any defence by the accused."
"Counsel for the Appellant is of the view that the Learned Trial Judge by embarking to evaluate"
"the dock statement of the Appellant prior to evaluating the evidence led by the prosecution"
"has  erred 
in  shifting  the  burden  of  proof  to  the  Appellant  and  thereby  reversing  the"
"presumption of innocence."
"It is an established fact that the burden of proof in a criminal trial must be proved beyond"
"reasonable doubt by the prosecution. House of Lords in Woolmington V DPP [1935] AC 462"
"Held that “Throughout the web of the English Law one golden thread is always to be seen,"
"that is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner’s guilt…” beyond reasonable doubt."
"“The burden of the accused’s guilt extends beyond proving the elements of the offence to"
"include any burden of disproving any defence for which the defendant adduces evidence.”"
"(Criminal Law by William Wilson, 4th Ed, page 9)"
"The  Counsel  of  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  had  erred 
in  his"
"judgement  by  failing  to  consider  the  defences  of  accidental  firing  and  grave  and  sudden"
"provocation.  However,  “It  should  be noted that a  defence  can  only  be  raised  by adducing"
"evidence by the defendant. It cannot be done simply by means of pleading. The prosecution"
"does not have to disprove every cock-and-bull story the defendant might raise”"
"It is worth analysing the evidential value of a dock statement given by the Appellant in the"
"present case. In The Queen V. Buddharakkita Thera and 2 Others [1962](63 NLR 433)  it was"
"held that “ the right of the accused person to make an unsworn statement from the dock is"
