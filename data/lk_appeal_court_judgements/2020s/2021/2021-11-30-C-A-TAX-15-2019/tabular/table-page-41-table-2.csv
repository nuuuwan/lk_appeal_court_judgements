"made  to  a  rest  player  for  loss  of  income  due  to  the  non-participation  in"
"matches as a result of ankle injury. It reads at p. 335 as follows:"
"“However, it is clear from the letter dated 09.08.2008 written by the Secretary"
"SLC to the Chief Executive Officer of SLC and the reply sent, that the payment"
"made to the Appellant, Lasith Malinga was not compensation for the injury"
"he suffered, but it was a payment made to give him support for the loss of"
"income, due to his non-participation in matches as a result of the ankle injury."
"Therefore, the capital sum paid to the Appellant was not to compensate him"
"in respect of the ankle injury suffered, but it was to compensate him for the"
"loss of income. Hence, it was a payment made to a rest player. Therefore, this"
"payment  of  Rs.  1,609,500/-  will  not  fall  under  Section  13  (f)  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act, and it is liable for income tax”."
