"so under his employment contract with SLC."
"[97]  The  originating  cause  or  source  of  the  income  in  question  was  the"
"contract of employment entered in Sri Lanka under which the Appellant was"
"bound to render services to SLC as a national cricketer and the services were"
"rendered by the Appellant representing Sri Lanka to his Sri Lanka employer,"
"namely, the SLC.  The place where the services were physically performed"
"i.e. outside Sri Lanka, is only a place at which he is bound to perform his duty"
"as an employee of the SLC in terms of the Contract."
"[98] In my view the rendering of the services was no more than contractual"
"performance by the taxpayer to the Sri Lankan employer (SLC) located in Sri"
"Lanka and the source of the income earned during the foreign tour in the"
"course of employment was no different to the source of the income earned"
"by the Appellant for services rendered in Sri Lanka as the representative of"
"SLC. It is a reciprocal obligation or arrangement between the Appellant and"
"SLC irrespective whether certain matches are physically performed (played)"
"in Sri Lanka and others are performed outside Sri Lanka."
