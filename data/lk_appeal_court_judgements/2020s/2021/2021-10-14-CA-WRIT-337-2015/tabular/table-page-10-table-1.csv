"Joseph A.L. Cooray in his work Constitutional and Administrative"
"Law  of  Sri  Lanka  (June  1995)  at  page  329  says  “The  doctrine  that"
"subordinate  legislation  is  invalid  if  it  is  ultra  vires,  is  based  on  the"
"principle that a subordinate agency has no power to legislate other than"
"such 
as  may 
have 
expressly 
been 
conferred 
by 
the 
supreme"
"Legislature.  Subordinate  legislation  is  fundamentally  of  a  derivative"
"nature  and  must  be  exercised  within 
the  periphery  of 
the  power"
"conferred  by  the  enabling  Act.  For  example,  subordinate 
legislation"
"having 
retrospective  effect 
is  ultra  vires  unless 
the  enabling  Act"
"expressly  or  by  necessary 
implication  authorizes 
the  making  of"
"retrospective  subordinate  legislation.”  At  page  323  the  author  further"
"states “Unless Parliament has in the enabling or parent Act expressly or"
"impliedly  authorized 
the  sub-delegation, 
the  maxim  delegatus  non"
"potest delegare applies to make the sub-delegation unlawful.”"

"4th Respondent stated that he operates a garage under the name and"
"style  of  “Kumara  Motors”  at  the  abovementioned  premise  where  he"
"utilizes to park motor coach-vehicles belonging to his family members."
"To substantiate these facts the 4th Respondent annexed copies of the"
"certificate of registration of the motor vehicles  and Passenger Service"
"Permits 
for  Regular  Passenger  Carriage  Services  belonging  to  his"
"family  members  as  X1

It 
is 
to  be  noted 
that  all 
these"
"documents  had  been  obtained  from  the  relevant  authorities  around"
"2014-2015.  Further,  the  4th  Respondent  also  contended  that  the"
"Building  Plan  bearing  No.  BA5/2005/25  marked  P-16A  was  an"
