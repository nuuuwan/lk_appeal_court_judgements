"K. K. A. V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J."
"JUDGMENT"
"The Appellant filed case No: 386/96 in the District Court of Avissawella seeking probate for"
"the estate of late Hapugoda Rajapaksha Wannaku Mudianselage Gunapala Somabandu."
"P
roducing a document signed by five witnesses, the Petitioner had sought an order of probate."
"However, the only heir of the deceased, his daughter, opposed the document stating that the"
"document was not an act of her late father. The District Judge, after recording issues, heard the"
"case.  On  behalf  of  both  parties,  evidence  was  called  on  the  14th  of  June 1996.  The  learned"
"District Judge pronounced the judgement and declared that the document was not an act of the"
"deceased."
"A
ggrieved by this, the Petitioner appealed to this court. Both parties agreed to dispose of the"
"matter by written submissions Petitioner-Appellant has raised many grounds of appeal. Delay"
"in announcing the judgement was one such ground. If that was the only reason, it is worthless"
"discussing since delay to pronounce judgement is not a ground of appeal."
"P
etitioner  not  giving  evidence  is  not  the  ground  on  which  the  petition  was  rejected.  The"
"Appellant had taken upon himself that was one ground where the judgement went against him."
"When considering the judgement, the judge had  made an  observation  but  not  discussed  the"
"point at length. The learned judge had not violated Section 134 of The Evidence Ordinance."
"The judgement does not rely on the number of witnesses called to give evidence or the fact that"
"the Petitioner had not given evidence."
"O
ne of the main arguments of the Appellant is that the judge had misdirected himself regarding"
"witness Bandara giving an example as to the time Bandara was married and a visit to Nugegoda."
"W
itness Bandara had said he went to Nugegoda with his wife, but in reality, on the day Bandara"
"went to Negegoda, he was not married since he was married on the day, he gave evidence he"
"used the word 'wife'."
