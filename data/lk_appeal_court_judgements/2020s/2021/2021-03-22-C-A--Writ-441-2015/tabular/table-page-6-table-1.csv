"District Court of Moratuwa has been impacted upon  by any of the title certificates that"
"have been issued in this case. This Court took pains to identify  the land belonging to the"
"Petitioner in any of the determinations given by the 1st Respondent and it was unable to"
"do so."
"In any event this raises disputed questions of fact which could be effectively adjudicated"
"upon only in the District Court which the Petitioner enjoys by virtue of section 22 of the"
"Act."
"In these circumstances, this Court takes the view there is no prima facie  case of an act or"
"decision that has been made out to be  ultra vires and this Court proceeds to dismiss this"
"application for certiorari."
