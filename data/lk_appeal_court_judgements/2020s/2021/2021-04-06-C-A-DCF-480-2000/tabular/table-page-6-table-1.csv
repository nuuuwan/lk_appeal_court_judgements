"The  Defendant states that in  any event, the Plaintiff has consistently taken  up the position that"
"the  Plaintiff  granted 
leave  and 
license 
to 
the  original  Defendant  and  her  children  on  a"
"sympathetic basis.  If so would it not have been  probable that the purported notice to quit ought"
"to  have  been 
issued 
in  closer  proximity  to  when  the  original  Defendant  offered  to  buy  the"
"premises from the Plaintiff i.e. after 1984 and  not in  1987."
"The Defendant states that it is clear that the Plaintiff has in fact taken well over 7 years to institute"
"proceedings against the original Defendant to eject her well after she stopped  paying her rent."
"Another material point the Defendants embark upon  is the fact that ought to consider is that at"
"times  material to this action, the Plaintiff had  leased  out of his other houses to the daughter of"
"the  original  Defendant. 
This  was 
revealed  by  non-other  the  Plaintiff  himself  during  cross"
"examination (vide page  140 of the Appeal  brief)."
"Therefore, the  Defendants submit that there  is  a high  probability that the  Plaintiff would  have"
"not  only  given  a  house  on  lease  to  the  original  Defendant's  daughter  but  also  to  the  original"
"Defendant during the same  period."
"Subsequent  to  a  thorough  analysis  of the  arguments  of the  Plaintiff  and  the  Defendant,  it  is"
"pertinent to note that even  though  the  Defendant claimed  that she  paid  rent  in  respect  of the"
"subject property since  1971 when they came  into possession  of the subject property, she  failed"
"to produce  receipts  or any other document of such  payment.  Therefore,  it is  submitted  by the"
"Plaintiff  that  the  Defendant  had 
failed 
to  adduce  sufficient  evidence 
in  order  to  prove  the"
"existence of a contract of tenancy between the Plaintiff and the Defendant."
