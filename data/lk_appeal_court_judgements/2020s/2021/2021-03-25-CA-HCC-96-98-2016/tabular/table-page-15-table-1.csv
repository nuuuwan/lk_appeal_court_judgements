"that;"
"“In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be"
"drawn, such an inference must  be the one and only irresistible and"
"inescapable conclusion that the accused committed the offence.”"
"On the totality of the evidence led in the case and in the light of the above"
"authorities, the only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that can be arrived with"
"the proved items of circumstantial evidence is that the three accused appellants had"
"committed the murder of Karupaiah Vanarajah at Kandapola."
"Accordingly,  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  of  all  three  appellants  are"
"affirmed. The appeal is dismissed."
"The  registrar  is  directed  to  send  a  copy  of  the  judgment  together  with  the"
