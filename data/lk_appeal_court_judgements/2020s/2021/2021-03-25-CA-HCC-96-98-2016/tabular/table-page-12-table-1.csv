"The learned trial judge has correctly held that PW 5 cannot be considered as"
"an  accomplice.  It  is  clear  that  PW  5  who  according  to  the  evidence  cannot  be"
"considered as a guilty associate who willingly participated in the crime, when there"
"is no such evidence against him."
"According  to  the  available  evidence,  it  is  quite  obvious  that  PW  5  did  not"
"know  of  the  incident  which  led  to  the  death  of  a  person  and  the  subsequent"
"arrangement to dispose the body. However the body has fallen off  from where it was"
"tied to the vehicle and was left behind to be discovered by the police."
"The counsel for the appellants contended that the learned trial judge was in"
"error when PW 5 was referred to as an eye witness in page 336 of the judgment."
"It is apparent that PW 5 is not an eye witness to the incident that led to the"
"death  of  the  deceased.  However,  it is  not  incorrect  to  say  he  is  an  eye  witness  to"
"certain incidents such as the three accused coming to his house and unloading the"
"sleepers,  thereafter,  travelling  in  the  vehicle,  looking  for  the  body  underneath  the"
"vehicle,  witnessing  the  dead  body  on  the  road  and  dropping  off  the  accused."
"Therefore, it cannot be said that the learned judge was incorrect altogether stating"
"that PW 5 was an eye witness."
"The  counsel  for  the  respondent  has  referred  to  the  following  authority  in"
"support of his position."
