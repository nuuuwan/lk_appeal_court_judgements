"However, in page 157 of the brief PW 5 in evidence in chief has admitted that"
"he was told that the person was tied to the axle bar of the lorry. This position was"
"clarified in page 167 when he was cross examined where he had admitted seeing a"
"person tied to the axle of the lorry."
"It was unchallenged that PW 5 was a suspect in the Magistrateâ€™s Court and"
"was  later  named  as  a  prosecution  witness.  The  suggestion  by  the  counsel  for  the"
"appellant that he gave evidence implicating the accused as he was angry with them"
"was vehemently denied by him."
"It is to be considered that if PW 5 was not in good terms with his cousin the"
"3rd accused, stolen  goods would not have been brought to his place  nor would he"
"have travelled in the vehicle. Thus, it is apparent that the suggestions by the counsel"
"for the accused that it was PW 5 who was responsible for the incident and the person"
"who took away the sleepers were without any logical basis."
"PW 6 Nelson Wijesuriya the brother of PW 5 has testified that the sleepers"
"that were in a drain in the cabbage patch  in their garden was taken  by the police."
"PW 8 Osman de Silva had stated that his driver the 3rd accused had taken the  white"
"Nissan Atlas lorry  on the 9th and returned it only on the 11th. The Ragala Police had"
"taken the vehicle in to custody on the night of the 13th. PW 5 has been referring to"
"the white lorry as an ELF lorry but in fact it was a Nissan Atlas. However, it was the"
"description of the make of the lorry which was incorrect but there was no issue about"
"the identification of the vehicle."
"PW 09, JMO Dr Kithsiri Samarasinghe   has testified that the face and body"
"of  the  deceased  was  severely  damaged  and  injured  and  opined  that  it  could  have"
"being caused by a serious accident or being dragged by a vehicle. (page 216 of the"
