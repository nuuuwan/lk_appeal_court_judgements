"If  a contradiction is to be material it should be sufficient to create a reasonable"
"doubt in the evidence of the witness concerned. There was no reason to disbelieve"
"PW 2 when she said the deceased left at 6 pm. She had no opportunity to know that"
"the accused appellants were planning on using the alleged discrepancy of the time,"
"which is based on her evidence at the inquest, to their advantage. Thus, it appears"
"that the contradiction is highlighted not to create a doubt in the evidence of PW 2,"
"but to formulate a defence. Therefore, it is my considered view that the learned trial"
"judge has arrived at  the correct decision that the  contradictions failed to create a"
"reasonable doubt in the evidence of  PW 2."
