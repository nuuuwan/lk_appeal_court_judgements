"Another question agitated by the counsel for the appellants is the probability"
"factor on the basis that it was not probable that the three accused appellants would"
"be travelling with a dead body with stolen goods to PW 5â€™s house and divulging their"
"mis deeds then threatening to kill him."
"It has to be conceded that there is no hard and fast rule how different people"
"will act in different situations. PW 5 has testified that the 3rd accused invited him to"
"spend the night with him, after dropping off the other two. However, it appears that"
"there  was  a  change  of  plans  and  in  the  end  PW  5  was  brought  home  and  the  3rd"
"accused had gone to his place."
"In the absence of any contrary evidence, it is a fair assumption that PW 5 was"
"asked to accompany them so that after dropping off  the other two accused appellants,"
"the  3rd accused would not be alone to travel back to his house with a dead body in"
"the vehicle as originally planned. The body falling off from where it was tied would"
"not  have  been  anticipated  when  PW  5  was  invited  to  accompany  them.  In  such"
"circumstances,  the  behaviour  of  the  accused  appellants  cannot  be  considered  as"
"improbable."
"The case for the prosecution depended to a very large extent on the evidence"
"of PW 5 although the prosecution was also based on circumstantial evidence."
"PW 5 had testified that the three accused came to his house with the sleepers"
"and that they travelled in the lorry and looked for a body underneath the lorry and"
"later  observed  a  body  fallen  off  on  to  the  road.  The  accused  appellants  have  not"
"disputed or challenged this evidence in cross examination. All that was suggested to"
"the witness was that he has falsely implicated the accused and that it was PW 5 who"
"should be charged."
