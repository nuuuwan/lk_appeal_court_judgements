tabbed the deceased in the head. The second accused fired a shot in the air."
"Only  the  second,  third  and  fifth  accused  were  found  guilty  of  the  offence  of"
"murder."
"There were 29 injuries on the body of the deceased.  Injury No. 24 was a stab"
"injury that pierced the heart and lungs of the deceased and was necessarily a"
"fatal injury. The injury No. 26, 27, 28, and 29 were grievous injuries. The Learned"
"Trial Judge observed that these injuries were caused to kill the deceased, and"
"therefore the second, third and fifth accused had the common intention to kill"
"the deceased. This finding is not an inference based on circumstantial evidence"
"but on actual participation to achieve the object of killing the deceased. These"
"incriminating  facts  are  incompatible  with  the  innocence  of  the  accused.  The"
"active  participation  of  the  second,  third,  and  fifth  accused  shows  a  common"
"intention among them to kill the deceased. In the circumstances, the conclusions"
"arrived at by the Trial Judge cannot be faulted."
"The argument that a dying deposition was wrongly admitted has no merit. The"
"conviction  was  not  based  on  a  dying  deposition.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge"
"considered the evidence regarding the incident, which resulted in the killing of"
"the  deceased  and  injuring  the  others.  Each  accused  was  convicted  for  the"
"offenses  where  the  accused  had  actively  participated  in  achieving  the  result."
"There were three incidents on that fateful day. The first incident was at a betting"
"center that PW1 did not see. The second incident was that the second and fifth"
"accused came to the deceasedâ€™s house and assaulted the deceased, which PW1"
"and  PW6  saw.  The  third  incident  occurred  at  about  7.00  p.m.,  killing  the"
"deceased and injuring PW1, PW2 and PW3. No dying deposition was admitted in"
"the evidence. After the second incident, the deceased stated to his mother the"
"names  of  the  second  and  fifth  accused.  This  can  not  be  treated  as  a  dying"
"deposition.  The  argument  that  some  accused  were  identified  only  in  the  dock"
"would  be  considered  later.  In  the  circumstances,  the  contention  that  a  dying"
"deposition was wrongly admitted is rejected."
