"a
ny rate, shown that the evidence of those witnesses could not be relied on as"
"sufficient  to  displace  the  evidence  in  support  of  the  alibis.  The  remark  that"
"credibility of witnesses could not be treated as divisible came to be made in the"
"circumstances related above. We do not think this remark can be the foundation"
"for a principle that the evidence of a witness must be accepted completely or not"
"at all.”"
"In this case, the Learned Trial Judge did not disbelieve the evidence of PW1. He"
"found that there was no substantial evidence to infer the involvement of the sixth"
"accused at the crime scene, thus the evidence was insufficient to prove that the"
"sixth accused had a common intention along with the other accused. Therefore,"
"the argument that since the sixth accused was acquitted, all the other accused"
"also should have been acquitted cannot be accepted. This argument is therefore"
"rejected."
"The next argument is that the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in law in"
"applying the principle of common intention."
"In the case of the King vs Assappu (50 NLR 324), the Court of Criminal Appeal"
"held that;"
"“We  are  of  opinion  that  in  all  cases  where  the  question  of  common  intention"
"arises the Judge should tell the Jury that, in order to bring the rule in section"
"32  into  operation,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  prosecution  to  satisfy  them  beyond  all"
"reasonable doubt that a criminal act has been done or committed; that such act"
"was done  or committed by several persons; that such persons at the time the"
"criminal  act  was  done  or  committed  were  acting  in  the  furtherance  of  the"
"common intention of all; and that such intention is an ingredient of the offence"
"charged, or of some minor offence. The Judge should also tell the Jury that in"
"applying the rule of common intention there are certain vital and fundamental"
"principles which they must keep prominently in mind  - namely (a) the case of"
"each prisoner must be considered separately; (b) that the Jury must be satisfied"
