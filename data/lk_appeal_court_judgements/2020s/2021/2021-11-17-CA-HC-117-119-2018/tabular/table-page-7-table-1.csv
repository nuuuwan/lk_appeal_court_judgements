"considering the participation of each accused separately, the Learned Trial Judge"
"found  that  the  sixth  accused  had  not  done  anything  to  infer  that  he  had  the"
"common intention with the other accused to kill the deceased or hurt the other"
"witnesses. The Learned Trial Judge acquitted the sixth accused considering his"
