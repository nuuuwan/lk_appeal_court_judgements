heir  cycles.  This  witness  referred  to  the  second  and  fifth  accused  as  Pradeep"
"and Chutie Malli."
"There  was  no  suggestion  to  PW6  that  the  second  and  fifth  accused  were  not"
"known  to  him  before  the  incident.  No  contradiction  or  omission  was  marked"
"during  the  cross-examination.  PW6  stated  that  the  second  accused  and  third"
"accused were  from their village.  He knew them from  their  childhood. The fifth"
"accused was also known to him for about ten years before the incident. He said"
"he did not know the fifth accused’s real name, but he was known as Chutie Malli."
"This evidence was not shaken during the cross-examination."
"Furthermore, PW6 did not say that he saw the third incident though he was only"
"a little distance from the place of the incident. He said he heard the noise of a"
"gunshot and shouting.  He rushed to the place of the incident. When considering"
"the evidence of PW6 and the evidence of PW1, there was no doubt that the second"
"and fifth accused came to the deceased’s house in the second incident. Therefore,"
"PW1  knew the second and the fifth accused as Pradeep and Chutie Malli at the"
"third incident. Counsel for the fifth accused submitted that the fifth accused was"
"not referred to as Chutie Malli. However, almost all the witnesses referred to him"
"as Chutie Malli."
"Furthermore, the Fifth accused in his dock statement stated this;"
"“uf.a ku iqo;a l=udr f.org pQá mq;d lsh, lshkj."
"In  view  of  the  aforementioned  evidence,  we  hold  that  the  second  and  fifth"
"accused’s identities were established beyond  reasonable doubt."
"The evidence of the two witnesses called by the third accused revealed nothing"
"helpful  to  this  case.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge  considered  that  evidence.  The"
"Learned Trial Judge considered all dock statements made by the accused. The"
"second and fifth accused made a very short statement denying their involvement."
