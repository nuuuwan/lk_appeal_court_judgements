"O
n behalf of the third accused, it was argued that the deceased family members"
"had  a  strong  motive  to  implicate  the  third  accused.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge"
"considered  whether  the  third  accused  was  falsely  implicated  for  a  previous"
"animosity between PW1 and the third accused. PW1 stated in her evidence that"
"she was involved in dealing with illicit liquor. It was suggested to PW1 at the trial"
"that the third accused had given information to the police regarding her illicit"
"liquor, and therefore, there is a strong motive to implicate the third accused."
"PW1 rejected this suggestion and said that  the third accused gave information"
"to the police only after her son’s death.  She admitted that she had been fined"
"for illicit liquor cases."
"The Learned Trial Judge has considered this argument and concluded that there"
"was no connection between the illicit liquor cases and the murder. PW1 herself"
"was grievously injured in the incident. PW2 also was injured. Both of them gave"
"evidence in the trial. As per the evidence of PW2, when he came to see what was"
"happening, the third accused assaulted him. His hand was severely injured, and"
"he  went  inside  the  house.  PW3  did  not  state  anything  regarding  the  other"
"accused. He did not say that he had seen the third accused assaulting their son."
"If PW2 wanted to implicate any of the accused falsely, he could have done so as"
"he was present when the incident happened."
"On behalf of the third accused, the only suggestion made to PW2 was that he"
"was telling lies regarding his injury. There was no suggestion to PW 2 that he"
"was giving evidence against the third accused because of the previous animosity"
"PW3 had given evidence at the Magistrate Court, and that evidence was"
"adopted under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance where PW3 had stated"
"that;"
