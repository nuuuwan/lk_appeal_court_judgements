"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The instant application for revision has been filed to revise the order dated 2.2.21 of the"
"learned High Court Judge of Colombo."
"In the above order the learned High Court Judge has averred that his predecessor in his"
"order dated 16.11.16 has not allowed the application from the defense to call"
"prosecution witnesses 2,4,5 who has already concluded their evidence  at the High"
"Court trial, and the said order had been affirmed by this court and the Supreme Court."
"But the basis for the order dated 2.2.21 had been disallowing the application of the"
"aggrieved party for objecting to the defense witness nu 3 being called who was never a"
"prosecution witness. The learned High Court Judge had averred that even the state-"
"counsel appearing for the prosecution had not objected for witness number 3 of the"
"defense being called."
"When a party files a revision application the party filling the same has to satisfy this"
"court that there are exceptional circumstances which shock the conscious of this court."
"In the case of Dharmaratne and others vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas ltd and others Sri"
"Lanka Law Reports 2003 3 SLR24 it has been held that “Existence of exceptional"
"circumstances is the process by which the court selects the cases in which the"
"extraordinary method of rectification should be adopted. If such selection process is not"
"there revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant to"
"make a second appeal in the garb of a revisionary application…”"
"Therefore in the instant application the petitioner had stated that the learned High"
"Court Judge had not considered the orders of this court and the Supreme Court in"
"making the impugned order but the learned High Court Judge had very clearly stated"
"that the basis for his order is the application by the aggrieved party not to allow  witness"
"number 3 being called by the defence and the orders of the Supreme Court and the"
"Court of Appeal is not regarding the said witness but regarding witnesses 2,4,5, who"
"have already given evidence at the prosecution trial, which this court sees as being"
"factually and legally correct."
