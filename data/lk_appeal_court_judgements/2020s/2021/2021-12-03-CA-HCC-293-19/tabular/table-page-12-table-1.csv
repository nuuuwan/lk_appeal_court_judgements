"In the instant action, although learned Counsel went on the basis of a sudden"
"fight and provocation to contend that the offence should have been considered"
"by  the 
learned  High  Court 
judge  as  an  offence  of  culpable  homicide  not"
"amounting to murder, I find that such a position has never been taken by the"
"defence when the prosecution witnesses gave evidence."
"The  appellants  have  not  admitted  that  they  were  drunk  at  the  time  of  the"
"incident  and  that  they  were  provoked  by  the  deceased  or  any  member  of  his"
"family,  until 
the  appellants  made 
their  dock  statements.  As  pointed  out"
"correctly  by 
the 
learned  Senior  DSG, 
this  position  appears 
to  be  an"
"afterthought due to the evidence of PW-07, who was later treated as an adverse"
"witness  and  PW-16  who  says  that  the  appellants  were  consuming  liquor  and"
"when she reached the scene of the incident stones were being thrown at each"
"other by the parties."
"If  it  was  the  stand  of  the  appellants  that  they  were  drunk  and  they  were"
"provoked, which resulted in a sudden fight, that position should have been put"
"to the key witnesses when they gave evidence. Although the learned President’s"
"Counsel for the 1st and the 2nd appellants put much emphasis on the evidence"
"of  PW-16  based  on  the  assumption  of  the  learned  High  Court  judge  that  she"
"was the only independent witness in this action, as pointed out, she cannot be"
"considered so by any means. Apparently, it appears to be that what the learned"
"High  Court  judge  meant  was  that  she  was  the  only  witness  who  was  not  a"
"member  of  the  family  of  the  deceased.  Admittedly,  she  is  the  2nd  appellant's"
"mother’s sister and she is the one who has advised not to quarrel when he was"
"consuming liquor. I find that this is a misdirection of facts by the learned High"
"Court judge which has not caused any prejudice to the appellants."
"The  evidence  led  in  this  action  clearly  establishes  the  fact  that  at  the  time  of"
"the attack, the deceased, his father the injured, and his family members were"
"attending to their nightly affairs after retiring to their home for the day."
