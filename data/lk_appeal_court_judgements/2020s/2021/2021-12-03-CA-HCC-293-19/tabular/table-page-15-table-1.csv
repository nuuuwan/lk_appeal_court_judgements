"appellantâ€™s action has not been considered separately, what they were doing at"
"the time of the commission of the offence has been considered to conclude that"
"there was common intention."
"I  find  that  even  if  considered  separately,  there  was  ample  evidence  in  this"
"action to determine the common intention of the appellants. As considered, the"
"evidence  establishes  each  appellants  presence  and  participation  in  throwing"
"stones at the house of the deceased and using foul language at the members of"
"the house. There is evidence that each of them was carrying weapons. Evidence"
"also establishes that each of the appellants have chased after the deceased and"
"cut him and the actions of each of the appellants in the process. It is clear that"
"the damages caused to the house and the attempt to prevent the injured being"
"taken to the hospital are also part of the same common intention. Hence, I am"
"of the view that even if there was a misdirection as claimed, it has not caused"
"any prejudice to the appellant or has occasioned a failure of justice."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  3rd  appellant  that  the"
"evidence  of  PW-01  was  contradictory,  and  the  learned  trial  judge  was  wrong"
"when  she  determined  that  they  are  minor  in  nature  and  inconsequential.  He"
"also pointed out to the evidence of other witnesses, to argue that the evidence"
"was not believable as to what really happened on that day, which should have"
"been held in favour of the appellants."
