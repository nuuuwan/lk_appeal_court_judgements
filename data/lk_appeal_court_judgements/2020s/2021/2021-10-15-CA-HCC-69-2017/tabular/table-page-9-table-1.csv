"The contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the appellant was that, the learned Judge"
"of the High Court had failed to give the benefit of the doubt arising from the testimony of the"
"accused,  defense  witness:  Mohammed  Thaheer  and  the  eleventh  prosecution  witness:  Police"
"Sergeant Shantha Kumara. The position of the accused was that any unusual happening in his"
"boutique could be observed by the neighboring boutique and the salon, hence, it is not practically"
"possible  to  commit  the  offences  alleged  by  the  prosecutrix.  The  position  of  the  accused  was"
"confirmed  by  defense-witness:  Mohammed  Thaheer.  He  could  observe  happenings 
in  the"
"adjoining boutique of the accused. He further testified that the prosecutrix never came alone to"
"the  boutique.  Most 
importantly,  the  accused's  position  was  confirmed  by  Police  Sergeant"
"Shantha Kumara (PW 11)."
"It was held in Kethsiri v AG 2014; (1) SLR 38, that,"
"‘courts in evaluating evidence should not look at the evidence of the accused person with a scant"
"eye. Defence witnesses are entitled to equal treatment with those of the prosecution and Courts"
"ought to overcome their traditional instinctive disbelief in defence witnesses. Quite often they"
"tell lies but so do the prosecution witnesses. There is no reason to reject the accused –appellant’s"
"evidence.  This  means  that  the  evidence  of  the  accused  was  capable  of  creating  a  reasonable"
"doubt in the prosecution case. Evidence of main prosecution witness creates a reasonable doubt"
"in his own evidence and corroborates the position taken up by the accused-appellant.’"
"The learned President’s Counsel says that, the learned Trial Judge had misdirected himself with"
"regard  to  the  legal  principle  that  an  accused  taking  up  a  non-statutory  defence  (general  or"
"special) does not require to prove his point but mere raising of a doubt would suffice to bring"
"home  an  acquittal.  The  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  argues  that  in  the  aforementioned"
"circumstances, 
there  are  grave 
infirmities 
in 
the  evidence  of 
the  main  witness  of 
the"
"prosecution’s  case,  PW1;  the  prosecutrix.  There  is  no  corroboration  of  the  evidence  of  the"
"prosecutrix  either  by  the  JMO;  PW3  or  her  own  mother;  PW2. 
  The  accused's  version 
is"
"corroborated  by  defense-witness:  Mohammed  Thaheer,  eleventh  prosecution  witness,  Police"
"Sergeant Shantha Kumara and PW2. The medical testimony also favors the accused. The learned"
"Judge of the High Court had failed to give the benefit of the infirmities related to the prosecution"
"witnesses."
"It 
is  to  be  noted  that  the 
learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  clearly  appreciated  the"
"inconsistencies related to the time at which the alleged offences had taken place. The learned"
"Trial 
Judge  had  deemed 
it 
fit 
to  disregard 
the  said 
inconsistencies,  having  taken 
in  to"
"consideration the fact that the incident had taken place whilst the victim was at a tender age and"
"it is accordingly unfair to expect the prosecutrix to remember the exact time, date, month and"
"the whole episode."
