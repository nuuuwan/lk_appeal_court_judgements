"mentioned in the first count, that was “inserting a finger into the vagina”, an offence punishable"
"under section 365 B (2)(b) of the Penal Code. Hence the learned counsel for the appellant says"
"that the first count should necessarily fail."
"As  per  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (PW3) the enlargement  of the  hymeneal  cavity  could  have"
"taken  place  due  to  natural  causes.  He  also  testified  that  it  could  also  take  place  due  to  the"
"insertion  of  a  penis  or  a  finger.  Thus,  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  was  not  conclusive that the"
"disruption of the hymen was exclusively due to a sexual act. In the instant case, as per the Judicial"
"Medical Officer, the disruption of the hymen of the prosecutrix could be attributed to, natural"
"causes or inserting a finger or inserting a penis. In the circumstances, one hypothesis namely,"
"natural causes are totally consistent with the innocence of the accused and the learned Counsel"
"for the appellant argues that he should be given the benefit of the doubt. But in the instant case,"
"the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  used  the  other  hypothesis  to  buttress  the  story  of  the"
"prosecutrix and this could be considered as a very serious misdirection of law."
"Due to the infirmities in her testimony and contradiction with her first statement to the police,"
"the learned Counsel for the appellant says that, a grave doubt would create with regard to the"
"story of the prosecutrix. But the learned High Court judge failed to give the benefit of the doubt"
"to the appellant. He further says that the learned Judge of the High Court had erroneously come"
"to the conclusion that the defence taken by the accused was not put to the prosecution witness."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  that,  immediately  upon  his  arrest  the"
"accused did take up this stand in his statement to the police. The mother of the prosecutrix (PW2)"
"had admitted that she met the wife of the accused. She also admitted that she had given a letter"
"to the mosque.  Immediately upon receiving the complaint she did not rush to the police, but"
"there had been some dialogue with the accused and the mosque. Counsel for the appellant says"
"that, this confirms the stand taken by the accused. furthermore, defence witness: Mohammed"
"Lebbe Thaheer corroborates this position."
"Considering  the  totality  of  the  evidence  given  by  the  accused,  second  prosecution  witness,"
"defence  witness:  Mohammed  Lebbe  Thaheer  and  the  statement  made  by the  accused  to  the"
"police, immediately upon his arrest, it was proved that the mother of the prosecutrix (PW2) did"
"coerce the accused. Alternatively, a reasonable doubt is created whether PW2 did coerce the"
"accused. It is trite law that where an accused is not taking a special or general defence, he does"
"not have to prove his position but the learned counsel for the appellant argues that creating a"
"reasonable doubt would suffice to bring home an acquittal. Unfortunately, the learned Judge of"
"the High Court had failed to address his mind to this legal principle and thereby failed to give the"
"resulting benefit of the doubt to the accused."
