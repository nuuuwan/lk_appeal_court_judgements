"and failed to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused. The prosecutrix was not corroborated"
"by any of the prosecution witnesses."
"It was the contention of the counsel for the appellant that, the version of the prosecutrix was not"
"corroborated by the Judicial Medical Officer (PW3). As per the prosecutrix, the incident had taken"
"place two months prior to informing her mother (PW2) Sitti Kadija on 10.06.2011, according to"
"PW3, the injury could have taken place ten days prior to his medical examination on 14.06.2011."
"According to Sitti Kadija, the prosecutrix narrated the alleged incident ten to fifteen days after it"
"had  occurred.  The  version  of  the  prosecutrix  that  the  incident  had  taken  place  two  months"
"previously is not corroborated by PW2(her mother) or Judicial Medical Officer (PW3)."
"It was the contention of the counsel for the appellant that, the learned Judge of the High Court"
"failed to apply the legal principles related to corroboration. In the instant case the prosecution"
"had called PW2 as a corroborative witness. Admittedly, she is the mother of the prosecutrix. It is"
"trite law that where a witness is an interested witness, the trial Judge should proceed cautiously."
"While on facts, testimony of PW2 (mother of the prosecutrix) does not corroborate the story of"
"PW1; the prosecutrix. The learned Judge of the High Court acted upon it without considering the"
"legal principles applicable to the evaluation of evidence of an interested witness as enunciated"
"by Justice Shiranee Thilakawardena in AG vs Sandanam Pitchi Marry Theresa; 2011 (2) SLR 291."
"The  appellant  argues  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  disregarded  the  grave"
"inconsistencies related to the sexual acts committed as narrated by the prosecutrix.  It was the"
"contention of the counsel for the appellant that, PW 1 testified that she was made to lie on the"
"ground and the accused had inserted his penis into her vagina."
"Learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the appellant says that the evidence could be contrasted with"
"the  statement  given  to  the  police  by  PW  1  on  15.06.2011  at  13.25  hours  at  the  Kurunegala"
"Teaching Hospital. The prosecutrix contradicts herself on this vital position. In court she took up"
"the position that she was made to lie on the ground and then the offence was committed. In her"
"statement to the police the prosecutrix took up the position that the offence was committed in"
"an upright position, by pressing her back against the wall. The learned Judge of the High Court"
"however disregarded this vital contradiction."
"At the trial, the prosecutrix took up the position that three sexual offences were committed on"
"her on three separate occasions within a period of five days. On the first occasion the accused"
"had kissed her. On the second occasion the accused had kissed her and had given some water to"
"drink. Then she had fainted. On the third occasion the accused made her lie down on the floor"
"and had inserted his penis to her vagina. That was  the only occasion the accused inserted his"
"penis into the vagina. Thus, the prosecutrix never testified with regard to the alleged sexual act"
