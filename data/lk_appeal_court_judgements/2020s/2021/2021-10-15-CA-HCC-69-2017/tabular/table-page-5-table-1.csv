"want to go to school. she couldn’t go passing the shop of the accused-appellant to go to school,"
"as she was being harassed by the accused-appellant always. The witness had made inquiries from"
"the  prosecutrix  the  reason  for  same  and  the  prosecutrix  had  informed  her  that  the  accused-"
"appellant would misbehave with her. On being informed of same, she had taken the prosecutrix"
"to the General hospital in Kurunegala, and she had thereafter given a statement to the police."
"On being questioned as to whether she threatened her daughter or influenced her daughter to"
"lodge a false complaint to the police against the accused-appellant, the witness categorically took"
"up the position that she did not influence her daughter the prosecutrix to lodge a false complaint"
"to the police against the accused-appellant. The witness further testified to the effect that, the"
"statement of her daughter, the prosecutrix, had been recorded by the police subsequent to the"
"witness being directed to go to a side. The prosecutrix had been produced before the  Judicial"
"Medical Officer; (JMO);(PW3) on 14.06.2011 at 10 a.m. He had examined the prosecutrix when"
"she was warded at Kurunegala Teaching Hospital."
"The prosecutrix had narrated the incident to the JMO in Tamil whilst another doctor by the name"
"of Uwaais had translated the narration to the JMO. In the said narration, the prosecutrix had"
"informed the Judicial Medical Officer (PW3) that, ten days previously, the owner of the ulundu-"
"wade shop had taken her to the hotel, removed her underwear and had inserted his finger in to"
"her female organ twice. He had furthermore attempted to insert his male organ into the female"
"organ of the prosecutrix. On being questioned as to whether it appeared that the prosecutrix had"
"made the said narration under the influence of the mother, the JMO took up the position that"
"the prosecutrix did not appear to be under any influence from the mother. When the Judicial"
"Medical Officer had questioned the mother, the mother had informed him that the prosecutrix"
"had not gone to school on 10.06.2011 and it was thereafter that she had come to know about"
"the incident."
"Upon examining the female organ of the prosecutrix the JMO had observed a tear in the hymen"
"in the area between the 3 o’ clock and 6 o’ clock position of a clock. The JMO had furthermore"
"observed  the  hymeneal  tear  to  be  a  large  one.  The  prosecutrix  was  not  having  any  external"
"injuries. On being questioned as to whether the tear in the hymen of the prosecutrix was natural,"
"the  JMO  categorically  answered  same  by  stating  that  the  tear  had  taken  place  owing  to  an"
"insertion of an external object. The reason which resulted in the hymeneal tear to be a large one,"
"the  JMO  had  opined,  did  owe  to  the  fact  that  the  prosecutrix  had  not  yet  attained  age  and"
"therefore the hymen was very thin, which resulted large tears to take place upon the insertion"
"of an external object to the female organ. The  JMO clarified the external object to be a male"
"organ having taken in to consideration the area in which the tear had taken place with reference"
"to the positions in the clock. On being questioned whether the tear could be caused by a finger"
