"It  is  the  position  of  the  respondent  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  arrived  at  this"
"observation based on the dicta in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State of Gujarat 1983 AIRHC"
"753. In that case it was held that;"
""" In regard to exact time of an incident or the time duration of an occurrence, usually"
"people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment at the time of"
"interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates"
"in  such  matters.  Again,  it depends on  the  time- sense  of  individuals  which  varies  from"
"person to person ....‚Äù"
"The respondent further deems it pertinent in this context to draw the attention of this Court to"
"the fact that the prosecutrix was studying in year seven and was also only ten years of age at the"
"time of the incident. The prosecutrix was fifteen years of age when she testified in the High Court"
"of Kurunegala. The prosecutrix was called upon to testify in respect of incidents that had taken"
"place five years ago when she was at the tender age of ten. It is natural for her to forget the exact"
"period of incidents over the passage of time evolving from the tender age of ten to a fifteen-year-"
"old.  The  demeanor  and  deportment  of  the  prosecutrix  was  noted  by  the  trial  Judge.  The"
"proceedings  clearly  reflect  the  fact that the prosecutrix  was  in  a  state  of  shock  and  feared to"
"testify in court and she was reluctant to explain the incident in court."
"The version of the prosecutrix that the incident took place ten days prior to the examination by"
"the JMO should be correct. As the said  position came to be narrated to the JMO in the short"
"history to the Medico-Legal Report way back in 2011, when the incident was fresh in the mind of"
"the victim."
"It is the position of the respondent that there is no merit for the possibility of the involvement of"
"a third person. The learned State Counsel questioned the prosecutrix as to whether she has a"
"boyfriend where she in response categorically denied same. The victim took up the position that"
"she has not engaged in sexual intercourse prior to the instant matter. There is no necessity to"
"discuss  the  principles  of  law  relating  to  corroboration  as  the  prosecutrix  is  a  reliable  witness,"
"without a single omission being pointed out and not a single contradiction being marked during"
"the  course  of  the  trial.  The  proceedings  relating  to  the  cross  examination  of  the  prosecutrix"
"clearly  reveals  the  fact  that  not  a  single  suggestion  had  been  made  to  the  prosecutrix  which"
"reflects the fact that a previous enmity resulted in the prosecutrix to lie, to concoct, to fabricate"
"a false case against the accused-appellant. Not a single suggestion had been made to the mother"
"of the prosecutrix (PW 2) that she entertained an enmity with the accused-appellant, a grudge"
"against the accused-appellant to concoct and fabricate a false complaint against the  accused-"
