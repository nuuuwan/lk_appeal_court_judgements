"inconsistency, and this argument has no merit."
"The  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that  PW4,  a  witness  from  Government"
"Analyst  Department,  had  not  mentioned  anything  about  a  blue  colour"
"bag 
that  contained 
the  heroin.  PW4  had  given  evidence 
that 
the"
"production  was  handed  over  to  the  Government  Analyst  by  PW3  and"
"identified  the  production  marked  P3,  which  bore  her  signature.    The"
"issue 
is  whether 
the  Government  Analyst  had  examined 
the  same"
"production  taken  from  the  appellant.    PW1  stated  that  the  heroin  was"
"contained  in  a  blue-coloured  polythene  bag  which  was  then  put  into"
"another sealable bag."
"All the identification tags that PW1 had placed were there. PW1 and PW2"
"identified P-3.  PW4 also referred to those identification tags. The defence"
"has  not  taken  up  that  there  was  no  blue  colour  bag,  and  therefore,  the"
"production  examined  by  the  Government  Analyst  was  not  the  same"
"production  that  was  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  for  this  case.  No"
"question  was  put

that 
the  production"
