"There  were  two  P5s  that  were  marked;  that  is  heroin  and  CD  3187/6."
"The  correct  number 
is  CD  3188/6(page  356  and  359.)  The  same"
"stenographer  had  recorded  this  evidence.  The  Government  Analyst’s"
"report has the same number."
"The document is available (at page 20 of the MC Kaduwela original case"
"record  which  is  a  part  of  the  High  Court  case  record.)  for  inspection  of"
"the Court. It has been marked as P 5 dated 2014/09/10 and initialled by"
"the Judge.  The document speaks for itself. It was a typographical error"
"that  should  have  been  corrected.  However,  since 
the  document 
is"
"available, discrepancy does not create doubt.  There was an error in the"
"date.  The witness PW4 had explained that the letter was received on 7th"
"November  2006,  and  it  was  wrongly  typed  as  7/1/2006.  The  learned"
"High Court Judge had considered all these discrepancies."
"The 
fifth  ground 
is  that  PW1  and  PW4  stated  that  the  productions"
"number  was  PR  117/2006. 
  However,  PW2  stated 
that 
it  was  PR"
"110/2006.  It  could  be  either  PW2  wrongly  stated  the  number,  or  the"
"stenographer  wrongly  recorded  it.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"considered  this  discrepancy.    However, this  was  not  something  that  the"
"defence has cross-examined.  Therefore, there is no merit in this ground."
"The sixth ground is that PW3 had handed over the Government Analyst"
"slip to Gangodawila Magistrate's Court.  The slip is available in the case"
"record, and it is clear that it was handed over to the Magistrate's Court of"
"Kaduwela.    Therefore,  the  statement  is  clearly  a  mistake.  No  question"
"was put to PW2 in this regard.  When the document is available, no oral"
"evidence is necessary to prove the same. Therefore, this argument has no"
"merit."
