"Supreme Court considered the meaning of “adverse possession” in"
"an exhaustive manner, which reads thus:"
"“Possession by one co-owner is presumed as the possession on"
"behalf  of  all  of  the  co-owners.  For  one  co-owner  to  acquire"
"prescriptive title against the other co-owners, he shall prove ten"
"years  exclusive  possession  after  changing  the  nature  of  the"
"possession to one of adverse to the title of others.”"
