"'I am constrained to say that, in fact, what the Petitioners are asking this court to do, is in effect"
"to  amend,  by  judicial  action,  Article  35  of  the  Constitution,  by  ruling  that  the  immunity"
"enjoyed by the President is not immunity at all. This, of course,  it is not within the power of"
"this Court to do. In the guise of judicial decisions and rulings, Judges cannot and will not seek"
"to usurp the functions of the Legislature, especially where the Constitution itself is concerned.'"
