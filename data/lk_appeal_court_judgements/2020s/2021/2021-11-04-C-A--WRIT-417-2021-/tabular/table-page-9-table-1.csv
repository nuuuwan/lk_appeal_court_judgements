"The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner  disagreeing with the above position has"
"cited a Canadian judgement in the case of R v. Anderson Supreme Court of Canada (2014)"
"2
 
SCR 167 in which it has been held as follows:"
"“….Prosecutorial discretion is reviewable for abuse of process. The abuse of process doctrine is available"
"where there is evidence that the Crown’s conduct is egregious and seriously compromises trial fairness or"
"the integrity of the justice system. The burden of proof lies on the accused to establish, on a balance of"
"probabilities,  a  proper  evidentiary 
foundation  to  proceed  with  an  abuse  of  process  claim,  before"
"requiring the Crown to provide reasons justifying its decision…..”"
"The Petitioner has cited several other judgements also to  emphasize the doctrine of public"
"trust and the limitations to discretion that conferred by law. However, the argumentation of"
"the Respondents is based on the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General."
"It is important to note that the judicial review is concerned, not with the decision but with"
"the  decision  making  process7.  The 
judicial  review  has  been  expanded  through 
judicial"
"creativity  during  past  decades  and  the  Judges  have  exercised  the  freedom  of  employing"
"various theories in reviewing the discretionary power of public authorities. Accordingly, the"
"current  position,  in  my  view,  is  that  the  Attorney  General's  power  to  file  or  not  to  file  an"
"indictment  is  a  discretionary  power  which  is  neither  absolute  nor  unfettered.  Therefore,"
"each case that challenges such discretion should no doubt be decided on its own merits."
"The vital question at this stage is whether the Petitioner has established a prima facie case"
"for review. The contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the 3rd and 6th Respondents"
"is  that  the  entire  basis  for  the  Petitioner’s  application  for  writs  of  Mandamus  to  indict,"
"arrest,  and  detain  the  3rd  Respondent,  relies  solely  on  the  forensic  audit  report  marked"
"‘A5(a)’.  He  contends  referring  to  bullet  points 3  to  6  in  page  174  of  the  said  report  (A5a),"
