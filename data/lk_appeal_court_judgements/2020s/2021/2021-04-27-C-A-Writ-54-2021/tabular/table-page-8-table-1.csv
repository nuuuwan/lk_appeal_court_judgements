"While  it  is  not  for  this  Court  to  decide  if  a  necessity  exists  for  an  anchorage  at"
"Mawella Bay, a consideration of the above material makes it clear that the necessity"
"for an anchorage at Mawella Bay has been carefully considered by the Department"
"of  National  Planning  and  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  and  that  there  in  fact  exists  a"
"necessity  to  provide  such  facilities  to  uplift  the  standard  of  living  of  the  fisheries"
"community living in Mawella."
"I shall now consider the submission of the Respondents with regard to the necessity"
"for the two offshore breakwaters. While the anchorage was to meet the needs of the"
"fishing community, the construction of the two offshore breakwaters was to reduce"
"the  erosion  of  the  beach  in  the  Mawella  Bay  during  the  monsoon  period,  thereby"
"safeguarding the interests of the tourism industry by having a beach right throughout"
"the year."
