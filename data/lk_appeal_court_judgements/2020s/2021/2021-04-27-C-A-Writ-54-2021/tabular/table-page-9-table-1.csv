"H
 
aving  examined  the  contents  of  the  IEE,  it  appears  that  the  Respondents  have"
"carried  out  the  necessary  studies  to  establish  not  only  a  necessity  for  the  said"
"breakwaters,  but  also  that  it  is  the  only  option  available  and  would  not  cause  any"
"erosion  elsewhere.  I  am  therefore  of  the  view  that  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the"
"jurisdiction  of  this  Court  to  declare  that  there  exists  no  necessity  for  the  said"
"breakwaters."
