he learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that it is important that"
"the quit notice is precise with regard to the extent and boundaries but that the quit"
"notice ‘X8’ does not contain an extent of land from which ejection is sought, nor is"

"the  Ragala  Estate  and  its  divisions  and  that  there  is  no  difficulty  in  identifying  the"
"land to which the quit notice relates to."
