n this respect, it was argued on behalf of the Appellant that in terms of Sections 59(1) (a) and (b)"
"the Government Agent, Assistant Government Agent, Fiscal or Deputy Fiscal or the District Court"
"have  no  Jurisdiction  to  recover  the  sum  due  as  a  fine  and  further  they  have  no  Jurisdiction  to"
"impose Jail sentence, if the defaulter defaults the payment."

"accrued up to the filing of the certificate and a sum of Rs. 21, 000/- as cost of Arbitration."
"T
herefore, it was the contention of the Appellant that in terms of Section 59(1) (c) of the Act, the"
"Registrar is not entitled to recover the accrued interest and the cost of Arbitration."
