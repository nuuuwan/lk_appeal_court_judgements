"the words “cost” and “interest” used in the Sub Sections (a) and (b) are not present in sub Section"
"(c)."
"I
n this context, assuming that Sub Sections (a) and (b) used the words “such amount” instead of"
"the words “such sum”, it should be read as “such amount together with costs and interest”. In plain"
"reading, it is clear that the word “sum” refers to the Arbitrator’s award only."
"As such, it is worthy to note in Sub Sections (a) and (b) the Legislature has used the words “a sum"
"together with costs and interest” which means to recover the whole amount, the sum mentioned in"
"the award, interest and cost due from the defaulter."
"Assuming that the Legislature used the words in Sub Section (c), “a sum of money recovered as a"
"fine”, no cost or interest can be charged as a fine. According to the Oxford Compact Dictionary"
"and Thesaurus [Oxford University Press 1997], definition of the word “amount” is “total number”."
"The synonyms to the word “amount” are “entirety, total value, whole” etc. Hence, it is clear that"
"the Legislature in its wisdom used the words in Sub Section (c) “amount due”, including the costs"
"and interest together to be recovered as a fine."
"Accordingly, we hold that the impugned certificate filed under Section 59(1) (c) is not defective"
"and is valid in Law. Hence, the Learned Magistrate was correct in rejecting the Objections raised"
"by the Appellant."
"H
ence,  the  Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent  can  resort  to  the  provisions  in  the  Penal  Law  to"
"recover money in terms of Section 59 (1) (c) of the Act as a fine."
