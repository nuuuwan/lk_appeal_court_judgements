"Although  the  Appellant  relied  on  the  aforementioned  Judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court,  it  is"
"important to note that the relevant Section in the Cooperative Society’s Law No.05 of 1972 does"
"not have the same wordings and hence the requirement to consider whether it is impracticable or"
"inexpedient does not arise with regard to a matter under Section 59 of the Cooperative Society’s"
"Law No.05 of 1972. It is open to the Registrar to file a certificate in the Magistrate’s Court at his"
"own discretion as there is no mention in Section 59 about such a requirement, unlike in Section"
"38(2) of the EPF Act. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that Dayawathie’s Judgment (supra)"
"has no application to this case."
