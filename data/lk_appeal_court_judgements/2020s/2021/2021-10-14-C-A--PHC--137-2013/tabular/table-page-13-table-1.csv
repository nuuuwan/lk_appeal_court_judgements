"On this basis, it  is  apparent  that, where the language of the Act  is  clear and unequivocal, such"
"meaning that flows from the language must prevail."
"N
evertheless, it was the position taken up on behalf of the Appellant that the language of Section"
"59(1) (c) of the Act is clear as to the requisites of a document issued by the Registrar, must contain"

"the total amount due in a document issued under Section 59(1) (c) of the Act negates it from being"
"considered as a certificate under the Section 59(1) (c)."
"Therefore, when enacting Section 59(1) (c), the Legislature did not intend to include the interest"
"of the award, as such the certificate filed in the Magistrate’s Court Colombo is defective."
"I
n this instance, it is noteworthy that the amount recovered under Section 59(1) (c) as a fine and if"
"there is a failure to recovery, the Learned Magistrate is empowered to impose an imprisonment on"
"the Accused-Defaulter."
"In this premise the Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Complainant cannot seek interest in"
"a Criminal Case. Therefore, if the Registrar resorts to Section 59(1) (c) of the Cooperative Societies"

"H
owever,  the  Court  is  not  inclined  to  accept  the  said  argument  of  the  Appellant.  The  Court"
"observes that in Sub Sections 59(1) (a) and 59(1) (b) the used words are, “such sum together with"
"cost and interest”. Nevertheless, Sub Section 59(1) (c) has used the word “amount due”, apparently"
