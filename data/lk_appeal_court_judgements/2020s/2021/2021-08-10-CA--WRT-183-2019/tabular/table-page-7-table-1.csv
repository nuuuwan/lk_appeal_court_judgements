"The  parents  or  guardians  should  submit  the  application  forms  under  any  one  of  such"
"categories  separately.  Marks  will  be  allocated  for  selection  according  to  the  marking"
"schemes indicated under each such category."
"The  subheading  of 
the  clause  4  of 
the  said  circular,  specifically  mention 
that 
the"
"attention  should  be  drawn 
to 
the 
facts  mentioned 
in 
the  sub  clauses 
therein  are"
"particularly in respect of all categories under which the admission of a child to Grade 1"
"is  being  sought.  Further 
the  said  clause  4.2  clearly  stipulates 
that  (in 
its  English"
"version)-""the proportion of children belonging to different religions at the time of vesting"
"the  school  to  the  government  will  be  taken  into  consideration  and  the  number  of"
"vacancies in the said school shall be accordingly divided among different religions and"
"categories"" (emphasis added)"
"Therefore,  it  is  obvious  that  the  number  of  vacancies  in  the  school  should  be  divided"
"among 
(i)  different 
religions  and 
(ii)  categories.  Therefore, 
it 
is  clear 
that  before"
"conducting  the  interviews  the  number  of  vacancies  should  be  determined  and  those"
"vacancies  should  be  divided  among  different  ""religions""  and  ""categories""  (categories"
"mentioned  in  above  mentioned  clause  3  of  the  said  circular)  taking  into  consideration"
"the  proportion  of  children  belonging  to  different  religions  at  the  time  of  vesting  the"
"school to the Government."
"Accordingly, it is important to examine here whether a child could be admitted to school"
"only upon the basis of religion in terms of the said clause 4.2 despite the strength of the"
"marks 
received  by  him/her  when  assessing 
their  applications  under  any  of 
the"
"categories such as 'close proximity'. The Petitioner's argument in the instant case is that"
"even  if  a  Methodist  applicant  fails  to  meet  the  criteria  for  admission  under  such  a"
"category she must be admitted solely based on their religion."
