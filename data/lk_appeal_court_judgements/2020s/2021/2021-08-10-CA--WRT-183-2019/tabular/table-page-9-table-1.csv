"The  Supreme  Court  in  the  said  R.M.  Dayawathie  case  considering  the  provisions  of"
"Circular No. 22/2017 which contains similar provisions as in clause 4.2 of Circular No."
"24/2018, has further held that ""A candidate must prefer his/her application under one of"
"these  categories  to  gain  admission.  If  religion  was  to  be  the  sole  criteria  for  eligibility,"
"this  circular  could  have  made  it  a  separate  category.  The  fact  that  it  isn't,  means  that"
"religion  must  be  viewed  within  the  framework  of  the  overarching  eligibility  criteria.  The"
"religious quota is a special factor for consideration; and not a separate tier of admission."
"It  does  not  make  eligible  an  otherwise 
ineligible  applicant.  This 
is 
the  reason 
for"
"proportionately  dividing 
remaining 
slots  apportioned 
to  a 
religion  among  other"
"categories- to facilitate the intake of eligible candidates in other categories."""
"Furthermore, 
the  Petitioner  relies  upon 
the 
judgment 
in  case  No.  SC/FR/614/2004"
"(judgment  dated  07.11.2015;  case  filed  against  Richmond  College)  in  which  Shirani"
"Bandaranayake,  J.  (C.J)  considering  the  provisions  of  a  similar  circular  namely  No."
"18/2004  has  held  that  ""a  careful  examination  of  paragraph  5  of  the  circular  therefore"
"clearly indicates that it is mandatory that the total number of vacancies should be first"
"allocated  as  contended  by 
the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  Petitioners 
to 
the  different"
"religions in the proportions that existed at the time of vesting of schools and as specified"
"under  different  categories  in  terms  of  paragraph  5(b)  of  the  circular.""  I  am  of  the  view"
"that  the  Supreme  Court  in  this  case  has  mainly  determined  that  the  total  number  of"
"vacancies first should be allocated to the different religions proportionately and not that"
"the court had determined to express that the selection on the basis of religion should"
"be done first before assessing the application under a certain category."
"Accordingly,  I  am  inclined  to  adopt  the  reasoning  given  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  the"
"said R.M. Dayawthie case on this issue. Therefore, I am of the view that any applicant"
"who applied for admission to Grade 1 under a certain category mentioned in clause 3 of"
"the  said  circular  No.24/2018,  should 
first 
fulfill 
the  bare  minimum  qualifications 
for"
"admission under the respective category before claiming a seat under the religion basis"
"that is described in the provisions of clause 4.2 of the said circular. However in my view"
"it  is  mandatory  that  (i)  the  cut  off  mark  for  students  who  solely  applied  only  on  the"
"respective  category  and  (ii) 
the  cut  off  mark 
for  students  who  seek  admission  on"
"religious  basis  as  well  under  the  same  category,  should  be  different  and  should  be"
