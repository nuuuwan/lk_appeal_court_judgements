"for the year ended March 31, 2012 (Annexure ‘J’) in compliance with section 106"
"(11)  of  the  Act  and  that  the  assessor  has  admitted  that  the  Appellant  has  given"
"separate  accounts 
for  manufacturing  activity  and 
import  and 
sale  activities"
"(Annexure 
‘K’).  Although 
the  concessionary 
rate 
is  applicable  only 
to  any"
"undertaking  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  articles  or  in  the  provisions  of"
"services, for the eligibility under section 59B (2)(b), the turnover threshold of Rs."
"300  Million  relates  to  the  “turnover  of  such  undertaking”,  which  means  the"
"turnover  of 
the  whole  undertaking  consisting  of  all 
the  business  or 
trading"
"activities under one economically independent and self sustaining indivisible entity"
"of which the total turnover does not exceed Rs. 300 Million."
"[95]  In  ICIC  Bank  Limited  v.  The  Commissioner-General  of  Inland  Revenue"
"(supra),  the  Court  held  that  separate  accounts  shall  be  maintained  and  kept  in  a"
"manner  that  the  profits  and  income  from  each  such  activity  may  be  separately"
"identified.  In  the  absence  of  separate  accounts,  including  any  information,  books"
"and accounts, paying-in slips, auditors’s reports or other documents which as is in"
"the opinion of the assessor or assistant commissioner, necessary for the assessment"
"of the income tax, payable by the assesee, as is referred to in subsections (12) and"
"(13)  of 
section  106, 
the 
computation  of 
the 
turnover  whether  under  one"
"undertaking or separate undertakings may be difficult."
"[96]  The  assesee  has  to  satisfy  that  the  activity  of  manufacture  and  the  imported"
"sale  are  two  separate  and  distinct  undertakings  so  as  to  be  able  to  identify  them"
"separately. The assessor has noted that the Appellant has not provided the separate"
"accounts  under  section  106  (11)  which  was  called  by  him  in  order  to  ascertain"
"whether  the  assessee  maintained  accounts  separately  for  the  previous  year  as"
"indicating different undertakings as claimed by the assessee. (Vide- pages 120-122"
"of the brief). The Appellant’s Authorised Representative while admitting that the"
"Appellant  did  not  maintain  accounts  separately  for  the  previous  year,  has  stated"
"that separate accounts are indicated only for the current year (Vide-page121)."
"[97]  The  assessor  has  noted  that  he  called  for  the  assessee’s  representative  to"
"produce its ledger accounts for the manufacturing part and import and sale part to"
"ascertain  whether 
the 
assessee 
has  maintained 
separate 
accounts 
for 
the"
"manufacturing  as  a  separate  undertaking,  but  there  is  nothing  to  indicate  that  the"
"assessee  has  produced  a 
ledger  accounts 
for 
the  manufacturing  activity  and"
"imported  sale  activity 
(pages  120-122).  The  assessor  has 
further  noted 
that"
"although  the  expenses  were  separated  on  a  proportionate  basis  in  the  audited"
"accounts,  the  Appellant  has  not  produced  previous  separate  ledger  accounts  to"
"indicate that the Appellant had maintained two separate accounts for each business"
