"to  Ministers  are  normally  exercised  under  the  authority  of  the  Ministers  by"
"responsible officials of the department……….In general, therefore, a Minister"
"is not obliged to bring his own mind to bear upon a matter entrusted to him by"
"statutes, but may act through a duly authorized officer of his department”."
"[30]  Mr.  Gooewardena  relied  on  the  Australian  decision  in  the  case  of  LS  v."
"Director-General  of  FACS  (1989)  18  N.S.W.L.R.  481  at  488-89  where  the  issue"
"was again the Minister's authority of making an intellectually handicapped person a"
"ward  of  the  state  that  had  been  exercised  by  someone  who  had  not  been  properly"
"constituted a  delegate.  It  was  a  case  wherein  a  departmental officer  had  exercised"
"the power in his capacity as a delegate rather than as the minister's ""alter ego"" and"
"accordingly, 
the  Carltona  principle  had  no  application.  Having  held 
that 
the"
"Minister thereupon fell back on Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works, Young J."
"stated at p. 489:"
"“[I]t is hard to see how the ""alter ego"" doctrine can apply in a case where the"
"statute  makes  specific  provision  for  ministers  to  delegate  their  functions  and"
"the  person  who  exercises  the  function  does  not  do  so  in  the  name  of  the"
"minister but expressly as the delegate of the minister”."
"[31] It is to be noted that the Carltona principle does not confine to Ministers and it"
"has been judicially recognised in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v. Cure &"
"Deeley  Ltd. (1962)  1  QB  340  at  p 371   that  the  Commissioners  of  Customs  and"
"Excise were in a position parallel to that of Ministers:"
"“The Commissioners are in a position parallel to that of the Ministers referred"
"to 
in 
the 
judgment  of  Lord  Greene 
in 
the Carltona case [1943]  2  All  ER"
"560 at 563, in  that  their  functions  are  so  multifarious  that  they  could  never"
"personally  attend  to  them  all,  and  the  powers  given  to  them  are  normally"
"exercised under their authority by responsible officials of the department.[45]”."
"[32] In Re University of Sydney [1963] S.R. N.S.W. 723, at p 733, the Senate of a"
"University was regarded as being in a similar situation.The Carltona principle may,"
"in my view apply in appropriate circumstances where the Government officials or"
"bodies are authorised by their superior officers to carry out certain administrative or"
"routine  tasks  without  having  a  formal  delegation  to  do  so.  Because,  it  is  almost"
"impossible 
for 
the  head  of  a  department 
in 
the  Public  Service 
to  discharge"
"personally all the duties which are conferred by a Statute otherwise than his officers"
"responsible to him unless it is stated in the Act in  unequivocal language that such"
"duties shall be exercised by the head of the department personally."
