"“manufacture”.  It  must  be  understood  first,  as  any  undertaking  as  a  whole  and"
"then, such undertaking is engaged in the manufacture or provision of services."
"If  the  Appellant’s  argument  holds  water,  any  person  or  company  engaged  in  the"
"manufacture  of  goods  may  be  treated  as    a  separate  undertaking,  whether  or  not"
"such  person  or  company  is  also  engaged 
in  several  other  business  or  trading"
"activities under one economically independent and self-sustaining economic entity."
"[75] Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act provides concessionary tax rate of 10%"
"to  an  “undertaking  engaged 
in  the  manufacture  of  any  article  or 
in  the"
"provision  of  any  service”.  Had  the  expression  “undertaking” meant  any  single"
"business  activity 
instead  of 
the  whole  business  activities  of  an  economically"
"independent  and  self-sustaining  entity  as  claimed  by  the  Appellant,  there  would"
"have  been  no  need  for  the  legislature  to  include  the  words  “an  undertaking"
"engaged in the manufacture of any article or in the provision of any service” in"
"section 59B (2). The legislature could have simply used the words “manufacturing"
"undertaking” in section 59B similar to the words “agricultural undertaking” used in"
"section  45  (2)  of  the  Act..  But  that  is  not  the  case.  The  context  in  which  the  said"
"reference is made in section 59B (2) (a) appears to be the meaning that is intended"
"by  Parliament.  The  concession 
specified 
in 
section  59B 
in 
relation 
to  any"
"undertaking  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  any  article  or  in  the  provision  of  any"
"service has to be understood in the context in which the term “undertaking” is to"
"be understood as an economically independent and self-sustaining entity taken as a"
"whole and in the context in which it occurs"
"Turnover  of  such  undertaking  does  not  exceed  Rs  300  Million-Turnover"
"threshold"
"[76] The Tax Appeals Commission has stated that the Appellant has carried on two"
"business activities under one undertaking and in an undertaking, the total turnover"
"means  all  business  activities  excluding  the  sale  of  capital  assets  The  benefit  to  be"
"granted under section 59B is subject however to certain conditions so far as the type"
"of  undertaking  engaged  (manufacturing  of  articles  or 
in 
the  provision  of  any"
"service), the minimum threshold of an undertaking (threshold turnover limit of Rs."
"300  Million)  and  the  limitation  period  (for  that  year  of  assessment).  However,  an"
"undertaking engaged in the manufacture of articles or in the provision of services,"
"for the purpose of section 59B (2) depends on the total turnover of such undertaking"
"(other  than  from  the  sale  of  any  capital assest)  for  that  year  of  assessment,  which"
"does not exceed 300 Million Rupees."
"[77]  The  contention  of  Mr.  Goonewardena  was  that  the  turnover  threshold  of  Rs."
"300 Million for the purpose of section 59B (2) (b) has to be determined on the basis"
