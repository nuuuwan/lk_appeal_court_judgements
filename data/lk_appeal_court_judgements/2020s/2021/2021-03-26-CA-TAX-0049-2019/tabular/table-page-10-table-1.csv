"[24]  As 
there  may  be 
thousands  of 
taxpayers 
in  Sri  Lanka, 
the  head  of 
the"
"Department of Income tax cannot be expected to discharge personally all the duties"
"of administrative nature which can be performed by the officials of the Department"
"in in exercise of statutory powers referred to in section 165 (6). I do not think that"
"the  acknowledgement  signed  by 
the  officials  of 
the  Department  acting  under"
"authorization  of 
their  superior  officers 
in 
the  exercise  of 
the  statutory  duty"
"conferred by section 165 (6) are invalid where no express or implied delegation of"
"authority  authorizing  the  officials  to  sign  the  acknowledgement  is  reflected  in  the"
"scheme of the Inland Revenue Act. I do not think that the Parliament intended such"
"a result."
"[25] Mr. Goonewardena however, drew our attention to a case reported in Carltona"
"Ltd. v. Commissioners of Works, (1943) 2 All E R 560 and submitted that even if"
"the  Commissioner-General  need  not  sign  the  acknowledgement  personally,  his"
"implied power to delegate exists unless the assessor signed “for and on behalf of the"
"Commissioner-General’.  He  referred  to  the  following  statement  made  by  Lord"
"Green, M.R. in the said case and sought to distinguish the principle established in"
"Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (supra)  from the facts of the present case."
"“The  duties  imposed  upon  ministers  and  the  powers  given  to  ministers  are"
"normally  exercised  under 
the  authority  of 
the  ministers  by 
responsible"
"officials...Constitutionally, 
the  decision  of  such  officials 
is,  of  course, 
the"
"decision of the Minister”."
"[26]  He  contended  that    the  official  in  Carltona  Ltd.  v.  Commissioner  of  Works"
"(supra)    signed  “for  and  on  behalf  of  the  Commissioner  of  Works”  and  therefore,"
"the actions of the official are the actions of the Commissioner of Works himself. He"
"drew our attention to the present case and submitted that  the assessor has signed on"
"his  own  behalf  when  exercising  the  authority  of  the  Commissioner-General  of"
"Inland Revenue and therefore, he could have only signed ‘for and on behalf of the"
"Commissioner-General’.  It  seems  that  he  is  inviting  our  attention  to  the  Latin"
"maxim  “Qui  facit  per  alium  facit  per  se” which  means    “He  who  acts  through"
"another does the act himself”."
"[27] Greene, M.R. in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioners of Works, (supra)  explained"
"broadly the principle at page 560 as follows:"
"“In the administration of government in this country, the functions which are"
"given  to  ministers  (and  constitutionally  properly  given  to  ministers,  because"
"they  are  constitutionally  responsible)  are  functions  so  multifarious  that  no"
"minister  could  ever  personally  attend  to  them.  To  make  the  example  of  the"
"present  case,  no  doubt  there  have  been  thousands  of  requisitions  in  this"
