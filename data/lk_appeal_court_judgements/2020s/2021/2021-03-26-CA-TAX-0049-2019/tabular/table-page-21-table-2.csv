"had an occasion to expound this term “undertaking” and “industrial undertaking” in"
"the  Indian  Income  Tax  Act,  1961  in  the  case  of  P.  Alikunju  M.A.  Nazeer  Cashew"
"Industries v. CIT, 166 ITR 804. The High Court stated in paragraphs 5 and 6:"
"“5.  What  then  is  an  ""industrial  undertaking""?  The  Income-tax  Act  does  not"
"define what is ""an undertaking"" or what is an ""industrial undertaking"". It has,"
"therefore, become necessary to construe these words. Words used in a statute"
"dealing with matters relating to the general public are presumed to have been"
"used  in  their  popular  rather  than  their  narrow,  legal  or  technical  sense."
"Loquitur  ut  vulgus,  that  is,  according  to  the  common  understanding  and"
"acceptation of the terms, is the doctrine that should be applied in construing"
"the  words  used  in  statutes  dealing  with  matters  relating  to  the  public  in"
"general.  In  short,  if  an  ""Act  is  directed  to  dealings  with  matters  affecting"
"everybody generally, the words used have the meaning attached to them in the"
"common and ordinary use of language."" (Vide- Unwin v. Hanson [1891] 2 QB"
"115 , per Lord Esher M. R. at page 119)."
