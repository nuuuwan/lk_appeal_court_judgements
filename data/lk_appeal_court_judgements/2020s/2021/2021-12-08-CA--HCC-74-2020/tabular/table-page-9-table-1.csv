"In this case the investigating officers had received specific information that"
"the Appellant was travelling with Heroin in a green coloured three-wheeler"
"bearing No.YE 5361. Accordingly, the raid was arranged and the Appellant"
"was taken into custody along with the Heroin he was carrying. Considering"
"this evidence there is no improbability occasioned. Their evidence pertaining"
"to  the  raid  was  clear,  cogent  and  without  any  contradiction  or  ambiguity."
"Considering all the circumstances their action cannot be faulted at any stage"
"of the raid. Hence the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant are devoid"
"of merit due to aforesaid reasons."
"Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed and dismiss"
"the appeal."
"Appeal dismissed."
"The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court"
"of Colombo along with the original case record."
