"I
n the case of Gnanapandithen and another Vs. Balanayagam and another 1998"
"(1) SLR 391 the petitioner appellants had filed an application in the Court of Appeal"
"to set aside the judgement and the interlocutory decree entered in a partition case."
"They were not parties to the partition action and they had further sought an order"
"directing the District Court to add them as party defendants to the partition action"
"and to permit them to file a statement of claim and participate at the trial. The"
"Court of Appeal had refused the application of the petitioners. G.P.S. De Silva CJ"
"held as follows;"
"“I am accordingly of the view that the Court of Appeal was in serious error when it"
"declined to exercise its revisionary powers having regard to the very special and"
"exceptional circumstances of this partition case”."
"In  the  case  of  Somawathi  Vs.  Madawala  and  others  1983  (2)  SLR  15  also  a"

"in revision and the Supreme Court held that the intervention should be allowed."

"“The  court  will  not  hesitate  to  use  its  revisionary  powers  to  give  relief  where  a"

"Silva – J (as he then was) stated thus “it is settled law that a glaring blemish which"
"taints the proceedings in a partition action and results in a miscarriage of justice to"
"a  person  not  being  a  party  to  the  action  may  appropriately  be  remedied  by  an"
"application in revision”."
"T
herefore this court can intervene in the exercise of its revisionary powers to set"
"aside the judgement, interlocutory decree and final decree entered in this case to"
"avert 
the  miscarriage  of 
justice  caused 
to 
the  petitioners  and  exceptional"
"circumstances have arisen in this case for this court to exercise its extra ordinary"
"revisionary jurisdiction. But in the circumstances of this case it is not necessary to"
"set  aside 
the  entire  proceedings 
in 
the  District  Court  which  would  cause"
