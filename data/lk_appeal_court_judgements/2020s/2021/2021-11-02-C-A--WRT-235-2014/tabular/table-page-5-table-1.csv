"Consumer Affairs Authority Act No 9 of 2003, only regarding goods and services within the"
"scope described in Section 12 of the Act. Therefore, power is not confined to inquire about"
"warranty given by implication or otherwise by manufacturer or trader."
"S
ection 12 is in two parts,"
"(
1) the Authority may, for the purpose of protecting the consumer and ensuring the quality of"
"goods sold or services provided, by notification published in the Gazette, from time to time,"
"determine such standards and specifications relating to the production, manufacture, supply"
"storage, transportations and sale of any goods, and the supply of any services."
"(
2)  The  Authority  may,  by  notification  published  in  the  Gazette,  adopt  such  standards  and"
