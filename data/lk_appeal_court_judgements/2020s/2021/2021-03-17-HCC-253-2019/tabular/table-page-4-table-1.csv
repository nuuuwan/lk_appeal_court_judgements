"7.","Learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  appearing  for  the  respondent  submitted"
"","that  the  learned  Trial  Judge  had  carefully  analyzed  the  evidence  of PWI  and"
"","rejected the portion of her evidence that she saw the appellant dashing the child"

"8.","PWI 
in  her  evidence  said 
that  as  she  went 
inside 
the 
room,  she  saw  the"
"","appellant  dashing  the  child  on  the  floor. 
In  cross  examination  she  said  that"
"","when she went  inside the  room,  the  child who was on the  bed was  on  the  floor"
"","and 
the  appellant  was  standing  near  the  bed.  After  carefully  analyzing  her"
"","evidence,  the  learned  High  Court Judge rejected  her evidence  that she saw the"
"","appellant dashing the  child  on  the  floor.  The  learned Trial  Judge concluded  on"
"","the  basis  that  what  she  saw  was  that the  child  who  was  on  the  bed  was  on  the"
"","floor,  and  that  the  appellant  was  standing  beside  the  bed.  The  learned  High"
"","Court  Judge  relied  upon  the  evidence  of PW I,  other than  the  portion  that  she"
"","saw the appellant dashing the child on the floor."
"9.","On  carefully  scrutinizing  her  evidence,  it  is  clear,  that  upon  seeing  the  child"
"","who  was  on  the  bed  on  the  floor,  and  the  appellant  being  near  the  bed,  taken"

it 
is 
together  with  what  Anthony 
told 
the  appellant"
"","natural  for  PW I  as  the  mother of the  child to  feel  that the  appellant dashed  the"
"","child  on  the  floor.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  rightly  taken  what  she"
"","really saw, as  one of the  proved circumstances to come to  the conclusion based"
"","on circumstantial evidence that the appellant dashed the child on the floor."
