"Court was not acting in its capacity as Court of first instance exercising original Jurisdiction in"
"terms of Article 154 P (3) (a) but under Article 154 P (3) (b) as a Court exercising supervisory"
"Jurisdiction over Courts of first instance."
"Therefore, Section 11 (3) had no application to the present Case. The Jurisdiction of the Court of"
"Appeal was invoked under Article 138 (1) read with Article 154 P (6). The Court of Appeal is"
"required to correct errors committed by the High Court in the exercise of the Appellate Jurisdiction"
"and not of the Courts of first instance."
"Hence, the Application made on behalf of the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner seeking"
"to call fresh evidence in this Appeal is dismissed with costs."
