"In view of Section 74, it is relevant to note that if the Petitioner in this Application is sought to"
"establish his legal right to the disputed portion of land, this is not the forum to call fresh evidence"
"in appeal."
"Apparently, Section 74 (2) does not confer any Right of Appeal against the determination of the"
"learned Magistrate. However, if there is a miscarriage of Justice or any injustice caused to a Party,"
"the  aggrieved  Party  can  invoke  the  Revisionary  Jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court.  If  a  Party  is"
"aggrieved by the Order of the High Court exercising Revisionary Jurisdiction, the aggrieved Party"
"is allowed to prefer an Appeal to the Court of Appeal by operation of Law."
"In this instance, the Court of Appeal has to consider whether the Order made by the High Court is"
"legal in terms of Part VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No 44 of 1979.  Therefore, the"
"Court of Appeal need not allow a Party to call fresh evidence in Appeal to introduce new material."
"O
n the other hand, since the Sections of Part VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act administer"
"with a special procedure, no Application in terms of the Civil Procedure Code could be entertained."
"O
n this premise, it is relevant to note the Judgment Kayaz V Nazeer and other [2004 (3) S.L.R"
"204] where, Justice Weerasuriya emphasized that;"
"“If any matter should arise for which no provision is made in the Act, the provisions in the Code"
"of Criminal  Procedure Act  governing a like matter which the case or proceeding  is  a Criminal"
"prosecution or proceedings, and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code governing a like matter"
"where the case is a Civil action or proceeding shall with suitable adaptations as the justice of the"
"Case may require be adopted and applied.”"
