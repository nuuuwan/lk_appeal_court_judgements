"Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent had moved in Revision to the Provincial High"
"Court of Colombo seeking to revise or set aside the said Order. However, the learned High Court"
"Judge had affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and further Ordered to remove the parapet"
"wall and the gate constructed by the Respondent-Petitioner."
"Thereafter the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant preferred an Appeal against the said Order of the"
"learned High Court Judge to this Court."
"Before the Appeal was taken up for Argument, the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner has"
"made an Application to call for Fresh Evidence in Appeal. It appears that in the Caption of the"
"Petition dated 30.09.2020, the said Application was made under Section 773 of the Civil Procedure"
"Code. Apparently in Prayer (a) of the said Petition, the Petitioner prays that;"
"a)  Allow the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner to admit as Fresh Evidence in this"
"Appeal under Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code, Deed No. 2604 dated 26.05.2016"
"& 31.05.2016 executed by Vinitha Senticumaran Notary Public, which is marked as W3."
"Thus it is clear that the Petitioner has made the said Application to call for fresh evidence"
"in this Appeal under the Civil Procedure Code."
"According to the Caption of the Petition of the said Application, it was made under Section 773 of"
"the Civil Procedure Code. Nevertheless, when this Application was being supported, the learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner mentioned to Court that the said Application has been made in terms of"
"Article 139(2) of the Constitution read with Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code."
