"sole purpose of preventing a breach of the Peace and which are to be superseded by an Order or"
"decree of a competent Court."
"Since the instant Case is filed under Section 66(1) (b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, it is"
"clear that it is  not  a Civil  Action or Proceeding  and the Order made by the learned Magistrate"
"acting as a Primary Court Judge under Section 69 (2) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act is a"
"Provisional Order for the purpose of preventing the breach of the Peace."
"It is observable that Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act has not granted the Legal"
"Competency to investigate and ascertain the Ownership or Title to the disputed rights which is a"
"function of the District Court."
"Furthermore,  in  Proceedings  under  Section  66  of  the  Primary  Courts’  Procedure  Act;  the  Law"
"requires Parties to file only Affidavits and documents in support of their claims and Oral Evidence"
"is an exception in a fit Case to be permitted at the discretion of Court."
"It is to be observed that in terms of Section 67 (1) of the Act, the inquiry should be concluded"
"within three months of its commencement and in terms of Section 67 (2), the Court should deliver"
"the Order within one week of its Conclusion."
"As such, it clearly manifests the intention of the Legislature is to have a short Summary Inquiry"
"and a speedy decision to prevent the breach of the Peace and not a protracted trial with regard to"
"the investigation of Title to decide the Ownership Rights of the Parties."
