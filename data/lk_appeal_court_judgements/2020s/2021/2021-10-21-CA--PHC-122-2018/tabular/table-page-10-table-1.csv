"Section 2 of the Primary Courtsâ€™ Procedure Act stipulates that subject to the provisions of the Act"
"and other written Law, the Civil and Criminal jurisdiction of the Primary Court shall be exclusive."
"Part  III  of  the  Act  comprising  Sections  24-36  provides  for  the  mode  of  institution  of  Criminal"
"prosecution;  while  Part  IV  of  the  Act  comprising  Sections  37-53  provides  for  the  mode  of"
"institution of Civil actions. Thus, Section 78 has been designed to bring in provisions of the Code"
"of Criminal Procedure Act or the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code only in situations where"
"either a Criminal prosecution or a Civil action within Part III or Part IV of the Act respectively are"
"involved.  Inquiries  into  disputes  affecting  land  where  a  breach  of  the  peace  is  threatened  or  is"
"likely  to  be threatened under Part VII comprising  Sections 66-76 are neither in  the nature of a"
"Criminal  prosecution  or  proceeding  nor  in  the  nature  of  Civil  action  or  proceeding.  These"
"proceedings are of special nature since orders that are being made are of a Provisional nature to"
"maintain status quo for the sole purpose of preventing a breach of the peace and which are to be"
"superseded  by  an  Order  or  a  Decree  of  a  competent  Court.  Another  significant  feature  is  that"
"Section 78 while making reference to Criminal prosecutions or proceedings and Civil actions or"
"proceedings, has not made any reference to disputes affecting land. This exclusion would reveal"
"the legislative intent that Section 78 is not intended to be made use of, for inquiries pertaining to"
"disputes affecting land under Part VII of the Act."
