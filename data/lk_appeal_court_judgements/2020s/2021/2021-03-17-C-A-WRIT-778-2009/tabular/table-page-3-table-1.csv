"The Petitioner says that in terms of Section 53 (5) of the Act, if the 1st Respondent is satisfied that"
"certain  information  should  be  entered  in  the  agricultural  lands  register,  1st  Respondent  shall"
"enter such particulars after hearing any parties affected. Accordingly, it was stated that in terms"
"of Section 53(5) read along with 53(1) the 1st Respondent should have held an inquiry availing an"

"As opposed to the aforesaid Application of the Petitioner, the 4 A Respondent states that it is"
"relevant to consider whether the order of the 1st Respondent to re-insert Petitioner’s father’s"
"name as the tenant cultivator falls within purview of Section 77(1) of the Agrarian Development"
