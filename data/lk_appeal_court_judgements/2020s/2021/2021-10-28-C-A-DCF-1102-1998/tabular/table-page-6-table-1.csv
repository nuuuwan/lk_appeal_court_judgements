"Per Anandacoomaraswamy, J."
"""Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and"
"finding the shares in the corpus for them; otherwise parties will"
"tender their pleadings and expect the court to do their work and"
"their  Attorneys-at  Law's  work  for  them  to  get  title  to  those"
"shares in the corpus."""
