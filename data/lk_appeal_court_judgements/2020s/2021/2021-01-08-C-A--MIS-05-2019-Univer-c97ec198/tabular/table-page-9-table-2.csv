"and out of the persons appointed to  the Panel of Inquiry and Investigation by the Minister under"
"Section 35, to inquire into such appeal or to conduct such investigation, as the case may be."
"This provision enables a member of the staff of the University to prefer an appeal against"
"a  decision  against  him  to  a  University  Appeals  Board.  What if this  appeal results  in a"
"decision against the University? In other words, the member of this staff succeeds in his"
"appeal and the University loses. The learned Counsel for the Appellant (the member of the"
"Staff) argues that if the University loses in the appeal filed by the member of the staff, there"
"is  no right of appeal given by Section 37 of the University of Vocational Technology Act,"
"No.  31  of 2008.  Section 37,  according to Mr.  Saliya  Edirisinghe,  exclusively  applies  to a"
"member of the staff who had listed his  appeal before  the  University Appeals  Board.  He"
"alone enjoys the right of appeal of the Court of Appeal by virtue of Section 37. If one were"
"to  crystallize  the  arguments  of Mr.  Saliya  Edirisinghe,  the member of  the staff has  two"
"rights of appeal - firstly,  to  the University Appeals  Board by way of Section 36(1)(a) and"
"second, if he loses the appeal before  University Appeals Board, a second right of appeal to"
"the Court of Appeal."
