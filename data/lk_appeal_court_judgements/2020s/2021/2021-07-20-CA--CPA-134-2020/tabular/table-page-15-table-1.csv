"A bail application is an ongoing process until its end result, the enlargement of"
"a suspect on bail. Circumstances under which a petitioner apply for bail could"
"change constantly, and if circumstances change it is the right of the suspect to"
"apply for bail. The Fundamental Rights entitled to any citizen as provided by the"
"Constitution  further  strengthens  this  notion  where  in  the  Article  13  (4)  it  is"
"guaranteed that, “The arrest, holding in custody, detention or other deprivation of"
"personal  liberty  of  a  person,  pending  investigation  or  trial,  shall  not  constitute"
"punishment while Article 13 (5) emphasizes that “every person shall be presumed"
"innocent until he is proved guilty”."
"Accordingly,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  court  to  consider  the  position  of  a  bail"
"application  with  proper  deliberation,  carefully  examining  the  details  and  the"
"circumstances related to it.  While it is understood that if circumstances of one"
"application  is  similar  to  the  subsequent  application,  or  they  are  vexatious  or"
"frivolous  in  nature  the  courts  can  reject  the  application  in  limine,  if  such"
"circumstances are different, then the courts are bound to consider that in order"
"to exercise proper administration justice.  In either instance, the Judge making"
"such an order must set out the reasons for the conclusions he has arrived."
"In such a context it is manifestly evident that the High Court Order amounts to"
"a miscarriage of justice preventing the due administration of justice. Hence, in"
"my opinion this revision application should be allowed as it satisfies, inter alia,"
"the questioning of the legality and the propriety of the order of the High Court."
"Having  thus  decided  that  there  are  grounds  for  the  invocation  of  this  court’s"
"revisionary  jurisdiction,  I  now  turn  to  examine  whether  the  petitioner  has"
"submitted  to  the  satisfaction  of  this  Court,  exceptional  circumstances  which"
"warrant to enlarge the suspect on bail. As observed earlier, the revisionary power"
"of this Court is discretionary and when a party files a revision application, he or"
"she  must  satisfy  this  Court  that  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which"
"shock the conscience of Court."
