"(vi) 
The  following  are  some  instances,  not  intended  to  be  exhaustive,  of"
"when the Court could order a retrial on the ground of miscarriage of"
"justice:"
"a
)  The 
trial  court  has  proceeded  with 
the 
trial 
in 
the  absence  of"
"jurisdiction;"
"b
)  The trial has been vitiated by an illegality or irregularity based on a"
"misconception of the nature of the proceedings; and"
"c
)  The  prosecutor  has  been  disabled  or  prevented 
from 
adducing"
"evidence as regards the nature of the charge, resulting in the trial being"
"rendered a farce, sham or charade."
"In  Nandana  V  Attorney  General    2008    (1)  SLR    51    Justice  Sarath  De"
"Abrew held;"
"“I  have  perused  the  totality  of  the  proceedings,  the  Information  Book"
"Extracts and the written submissions tendered by both parties. On a perusal of"
"the judgment of the learned trial judge the following glaring misdirection of law"
"as 
to 
the  required  burden  of  proof  appear  on 
the  record  which  would"
"necessarily  vitiate 
the  conviction  and  sentence.  The 
learned  Senior  State"
"Counsel too has conceded this fundamental error on the part of the learned trial"
"judge which would have prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant and"
"occasioned  a 
failure  of 
justice  under 
the  proviso 
to  Article  138  of 
the"
"Constitution.”"
