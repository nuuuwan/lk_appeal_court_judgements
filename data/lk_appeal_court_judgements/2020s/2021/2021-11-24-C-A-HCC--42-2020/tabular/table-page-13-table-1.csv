"Therefore, it is apparent that the appellant has not satisfied this Court that"
"non  production  of  one  piece  of  paper    has  caused  prejudice  to  his  substantial"
"rights nor that it has occasioned a miscarriage of Justice."
"Ukkuwa  v  the  Attorney  General  [2002]  3  SLR  279,    is    a  case  where"
"Justice  S.  Tilakawardana 
  held 
  that  matters  of  fact  that  could  have  been"
"challenged and clarified at the trial Court are precluded being challenged at the"
"Appellate Court in the following manner at page 282;"
"“Furthermore, 
there  had  been  no  questions  under  cross-examination"
"relating  either  to  the  genuineness  of  document  P14,  nor  to  the  authorship  of"
"such document which were the matters of contest that were brought up before"
"this court. Nor was there any challenge raised even through cross-examination"
"of the identity of this witness who claimed to have carried out the examination"
"of 
the  substance 
taken 
from 
the  possession  of 
the  accused-appellant.  This"
"evidence given by the Senior Assistant Government Analyst, Mr. Sivarasa, has"
"not been challenged in the proceedings before the original High Court, and is"
"for  the  first  time  being  challenged  before  this  court.  In  this  sense,  court  is"
"mindful of the fact that having had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness"
"before the original court and having failed or neglected to avail himself of the"
"opportunity  of  such  examination  on 
these  matters  which  could  have  been"
"clarified, had such objections or cross-examination being raised in the original"
"court, the counsel is precluded from challenging the veracity of such matters of"
"fact before this court.”"
"In 
the 
light  of 
the  above  authorities, 
the  ground  of  appeal 
that 
the"
"prosecution failed to prove the chain of production fails."
