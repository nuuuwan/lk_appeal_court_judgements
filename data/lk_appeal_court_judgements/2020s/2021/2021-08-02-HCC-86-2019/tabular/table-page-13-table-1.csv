"by  section  294.  The  evidence  establishes  that  the  appellant  was  in  the"
"habit  of  assaulting  and  illtreating  the  deceased  after  consuming  liquor."
"On  the  day  in  question,  she  has  come  to  her  fatherâ€™s  house  seeking"
"shelter  after  being  assaulted  by  the  appellant.  The  appellant  who  came"
"after  her,  has  forced  open  the  door  of  the  house  and  had  dragged  the"
"deceased away and had set fire on her."
"Even  after  setting  her  on  fire,  the  appellant  has  failed  to  take  her  to  a"
"hospital and had only done so in the following morning, which goes on to"
"establish his intention beyond reasonable doubt. The statement made by"
"the  deceased  to  the  Police  while  in  hospital  (P-01),  if  read  as  a  whole,"
"clearly shows the reason why she scolded the appellant which cannot be"
"considered a provocation that warrants setting fire on the deceased, if it"
"can be even remotely considered a provocation."
"For  the  reasons  stated  as  above,  I  am  unable  to  find  any  merit  in  the"
"second ground of appeal either."
"The appeal therefore is dismissed, as I find no reasons to interfere with"
"the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant."
