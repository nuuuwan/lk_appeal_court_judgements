"Apartment  Project  located  at  No.  77,  4th  Lane,  Old  Road,  Nawala,"
"Rajagiriya…”.  Hence,  it  is  quite  clear  that  at  the  time  the  petition"
"was being filed, there had been several parties as purchasers who"
"had brought condominium units from the Apartment Building and"
"had acquired rights or interests of their respective purchase."
"Accordingly,  it  is  further  clear  that,  the  case  embraced  by  the"
"Petitioners challenging the legality of construction in the Apartment"
"Building clearly has an adverse effect on the aforesaid purchasers"
"whose  property  rights  and  interest  are  very  much  affected  by  the"
"grounds and matters alleged in the petition. However, the Petitioners"
"still had chosen not to add the said purchases or interested persons"
"as parties to this instant application."
"As  precisely  observed  by  J.A.N.  De  Silva  J.  (as  he  then  was)  in"
"Rawaya  Publishers  and  Other 
v.  Wijedasa  Rajapaksha,"
"Chairman Sri Lanka Press Council & Others [2001] 3 Sri LR 213"
"at 216, in the context of writ applications, a necessary party is one"
"without whom no order can be effectively made. A proper party is in"
"whose absence an effective order can be made but whose presence"
"is  necessary  to  a  complete  and 
final  decision  on  the  question"
"involved  in  the  proceedings.  Therefore,  the  failure  to  make  the"
"necessary party a respondent to the proceedings must be regarded"
"fatal  to  the  application.  If  the  omission  is  discovered  during  the"
"pendency of the application for the writ the Petitioner is well advised"
"to  apply  to  court  to  add  such  party  as  a  respondent.  Such  an"
"application for addition will be allowed only if the application is not"
"yet  ready  for  final  disposal  by  court:  Vinnasithamby  v.  Joseph"
"[1961] 65 NLR 359. Once the final hearing of the application by court"
"commences,  such  an  application  made  thereafter  will  be  refused."
"Vide Goonetilleke v. Government Agent, Galle [1946] 47 NLR 549"
"and  Dharmaratne  v.  Commissioner  of  Elections  [1950]  52  NLR"
