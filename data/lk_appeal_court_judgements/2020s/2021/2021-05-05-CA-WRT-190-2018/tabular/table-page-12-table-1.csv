"officials and that the determination that the 4th Respondent has title is erroneous, a"
"fact  which  has  been  disputed  by 
the  4th  Respondent.  The  Petitioner  has  also"
"complained  that  the  procedure  followed 
in  selecting  the  4th  Respondent  as  the"
"absolute  owner  is  irregular.  The  Petitioner  however  has  very  clearly  admitted  that"
"neither  Dona  Damayanthi  nor  he  has  title  to  the  said 
land.  Thus,  even 
if  the"
"arguments  of  the  Petitioner  are  accepted,  the  fact  remains  that  the  Petitioner  will"
"not  stand  to  benefit 
from  an  order  by  this  Court.  Thus,  proceeding  with  this"
"application is futile."
