"quite  wrong  to  suppose  that  a  prosecuting  counsel’s  duty  is  a  mere  mechanical  leading  of"
"evidence regardless of the object for which evidence is led.  If he is satisfied that the evidence is"
"insufficient to prove the charge and insists on leading evidence, how can he in conscience ask the"
"Court to convict the accused?"""
"""I have not seen the duties and responsibilities of prosecuting counsel set out better than in an"
"article written by Mr. Christmas Humphreys Q. C. when he was Senior Prosecuting Counsel,"
"Central Criminal Court [Criminal Law Review (1955) page 739]. His view, and it is one with"
"which  I  respectfully  agree,  is  that  “the  prosecutor  is  at  all  times  a  minister  of  justice,  though"
"seldom so described. It is not the duty of prosecuting counsel to secure a conviction, nor should"
"any prosecutor feel pride or satisfaction in the mere fact of success .... His attitude should be so"
"objective  that  he  is,  so  far  as  is  humanly  possible,  indifferent  to  the  result”.  He  continues:  “I"
"have never myself continued a prosecution where I was at any stage in genuine doubt as to the"
"guilt, as distinct from my ability to prove the guilt, of the accused. It may be argued that it is for"
"the  tribunal  alone,  whether  magistrate  or  jury,  to  decide  guilt  or  innocence.  I  repeat  that  the"
"prosecutor is fundamentally a minister of justice, and it is not in accordance with justice to ask"
"a tribunal to convict a man whom you believe to be innocent."""
"""The obligation of prosecuting counsel to maintain scrupulous fairness in every case he handles"
"is all the greater when he is Crown Counsel representing the Crown in a prosecution. For “the"
"Crown is interested in justice, the defence in obtaining an acquittal within the limits of lawful"
"procedure and Bar etiquette”. As Lord Hewart L.C.J. said in Sugarman [2 (1935) 25 Cr. App."
"Rep. page 115], “It cannot be too often made plain that the business of counsel for the Crown is"
"fairly  and  impartially  to  exhibit  all  the  facts  to  the  jury.  The  Crown  is  not  interested  in"
"procuring  a  conviction.  Its  only  interest  is  that  the  right  person  should  be  convicted,  that  the"
"truth should be known and that justice should be done”. I cannot see how the jury can honestly"
"be asked even to consider convicting the accused if counsel for the Crown is satisfied that such a"
"result should not follow upon the evidence available to the Crown. He must first be satisfied that"
"there is a prima facie case against the accused before he enters on the task of leading evidence."""
