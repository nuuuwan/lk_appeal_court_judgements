"It 
is  remarkable 
that  the  above-mentioned  Additional  Solicitor  General 
in  his  reports"
"referred to the same Senior State Counsel who made the above application before the High"
"Court-at-Bar.  This  clearly  shows  that  the  said SSC  has  changed  his  mind  in  respect  of  his"
"previous findings against the 2nd Respondent, for reasons not known to us."
"The  Petitioners  raised  an  additional  question  as  to  whether  the  Attorney  General  could"
"delegate his powers to a State Counsel in providing the information under the  said section"
"194(1)  to  Court.  It  is  a  matter  for  the  Hon.  Judges  of  the  High  Court-at-Bar  to  decide  in"
"view of the provisions of section 194(2) when they choose to consider the application made"
"by the 1st Respondent or on his behalf."
"In light of these facts, we are unable to accept the submissions of the learned Counsel for the"
"Petitioners  who  asserts 
that 
the  1st  Respondent’s  decision  not 
to  continue  with 
the"
"prosecution  against  the  2nd  Respondent  is  irrational.  Petitioners  have  also  averred  in  their"
"Petition  – 
‘bias’, 
‘illegality’, 
‘unlawfulness’  and 
‘political  motivation’  as  grounds 
for"
"challenge.  However, 
the  written  submissions 
filed  on  behalf  of 
the  Petitioners  have"
"addressed only on the aspect of ‘irrationality’ and no adequate material have been furnished"
"to establish any of those grounds that averred in the Petition. The threshold of a successful"
"challenge of the Attorney General's prosecutorial decisions must be manifestly higher owing"
"to  the  pre-eminence  attached  to  the  functions,  powers  and  duties  attached  to  the  office  of"
"Attorney  General  by  tradition  as  well  as  by  statutory  provisions  both  in  the  past  and  at"
"present.6"
"In those circumstances we take the view that it does not appear, prima facie, any procedural"
"error in the decision making process of the 1st Respondent when taking the decision not to"
"continue  with 
the 
prosecution 
against 
the 
2nd 
Respondent 
in 
the 
Case  No."
"HC/TAB/1448/2020  at  High  Court-at-Bar.  On  perusal  of  the  documents  annexed  to  the"
"Petition, it is apparent that it does not emanate prima facie evidence or any proof  to grant"
"any relief to the Petitioners as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition."
