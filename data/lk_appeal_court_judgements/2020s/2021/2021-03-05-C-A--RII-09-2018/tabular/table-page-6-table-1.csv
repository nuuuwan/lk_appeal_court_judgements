"prepayment as requested by the counsel for the plaintiff as well"
"as the counsel for the 2nd defendant."
"The 1st defendant is agreeable to the prepayment and moved for"
"a postponement of this trial."
"Counsel for the plaintiff states thus;"
"I state that I am ready for the trial today.  However, since the"
"application has been made by the 1st defendant in person for"
"postponement of trial, the plaintiff would not object to such"
"application provided prepayment of cost of the plaintiff is paid"
"on or before 9.00 a.m. of the next date which this trial refixed, I"
"move that your honor’s court be pleased to make order against"
"the defendant as prayed for in the plaint.  Although the incurred"
"cost is much more will restrict my prepayment of cost at"
"Rs.25,000/-"
"The learned president counsel for the 1st defendant emphasized the words “as"
"requested” saying that the 1st defendant also requested and that the words"
"“thus” appearing before the figure “Rs.25,000/-“ signifies that the date was"
"given as per the condition to pay Rs.25,000/-."
"However  the  phrase  appearing  there  is  “she  will  be  subjected  to  a  cost  of"
"prepayment as requested by the counsel for the plaintiff…” Hence it refers"
"not to a request made by the 01st defendant but to a request to be made by"
"the counsel for the plaintiff. The term “thus” refers to what the counsel of the"
"plaintiff next requested."
