"Translator she could not understand the character of the order made by the"
"court.  Hence  it  is  apparent  that  there  was  no  consent  by  her.  Hence  the"
"position that it is not a “consent order” is correct. The position of the plaintiff"
"however is that it is not only an agreement reached between parties but also"
"with  court  to  obtain  a  postponement.  [See  paragraph  17  of  the  written"
"submissions of the plaintiff] Such an “agreement” presupposes “consent” and"
"as aforesaid the position of the 01st defendant is that there was no “consent”"
"by  her.  This  position  is  substantiated  by  the  passage  recorded  by  court  as"
"proceedings which was relied upon by the plaintiff."
"In addition a strong point in favour of the 01st defendant is that she paid costs"

"only  that  portion  because  otherwise  she  had  no  reason  to  pay  costs  to  the"
"02nd defendant who sailed with her but not to the plaintiff."
"Plaintiff  respondent  states  that  the  words  “as  requested  by  the  plaintiff’s"
"counsel” is very important and material. But the position of the 01st defendant"

"Another point on which the plaintiff relies upon is that paragraph 07 of the"
"counter affidavit of the 01st defendant. Among other things she states there “I"
"further state that on 27.10.2017 the Attorney at Law retained by me tendered"
"proxy  revocation  papers  to  the  court  without  proper  notice  to  me”.  The"
