"signed one day before and hence she has lied in paragraph 07 and if she can"
"lie on one day she can lie on the other day. The answer of the learned counsel"
"for  the  01st  defendant  was  that  the  revocation  papers  was  in  Sinhalese"
"language.  It  could  well  be  that  the  01st  defendant  even  one  day  previously"
"signed  the  revocation  papers  without  knowing  its  exact  character.  It  is  not"
"uncommon that when her Attorney at Law gave her a paper for her to sign"
"she would place her signature on the trust she has in the Attorney at law."
"Hence  the  position  of  the  01st  defendant  that  she  was  not  aware  of  the"
"character of the order made by court on 30.06.2017 is substantiated. As per"
"the authorities the court could not have imposed a condition that a decree"
"will  be  entered  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff  in  the  event  of  not  paying  the"
"prepayment of costs without the consent of the 01st defendant."
"Hence exercising the powers of revision and restitutio in integrum this court"
"sets aside that condition and the decree entered against her for default and"
"restores the case of the 01st defendant to the roll. The learned district judge"
"will  hear  the  case  from  the  position  that  the  proceedings  were  interrupted."
"There is no order on costs."
