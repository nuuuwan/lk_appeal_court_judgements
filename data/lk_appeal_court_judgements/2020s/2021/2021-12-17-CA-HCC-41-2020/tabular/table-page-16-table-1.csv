"Similarly, in the case of Kottasha Arachchige Uhhayaweera Vs Range Forest Officer and Others"
"CA/PHC/95/2012, decided on 04.09.2018 it was held that: ""Accordingly, it is amply clear that"
"simply telling the driver is insufficient to discharge the burden cast on the vehicle owner by"
"law."""
"Therefore, the respondent says that when this evidence is considered in totality, it may be"
"seen that the appellant has failed abjectly and thoroughly, to submit any sort of acceptable"
"evidence by any forum by any standards and that the appellant falls well short of taking all"
"""pragmatic precautions to prevent the commission of the offence using the vehicle""."
"The next argument of the appellant is that confiscating the vehicle is not reasonable, just and"
"equitable and is a violation of his rights. Every individual should be equal before and under"
"the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law. It should be"
"ensured that everyone has access to equal justice. Equity holds that ""Equity will not suffer a"
"wrong  to  be  without  a  remedy.  “When  seeking  equitable  relief,  the  one  who  had  been"
"wronged has the stronger hand and that it is the one who has the stronger hand that has the"
"capacity to ask for a legal remedy. The said equitable maxim goes hand in hand with the Latin"
"legal maxim, ubi jus ibi renzedium, which reads that ""where there is a right there must be a"
"remedy."""
"Equity  also  holds  that  ""Equity  delights  to  do  justice  and  not  by  halves.  “Where  a  court  is"
"presented with a good claim to equitable relief, and it is clear that the appellant has suffered"
"monetary damage, the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief.  Equity further"
"holds that ""Equity does not require an idle gesture. “It will therefore not compel a court to do"
"a  vain  and  useless  thing.”  It  was  argued by the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  that the"
"accused has pleaded guilty and has been imposed with a sentence and a fine of Rs. 25,000/-"
"in respect of the 1st charge and a sentence of 2 years’ simple imprisonment, suspended for"
"ten years in respect of the 2nd charge. In these circumstances where the perpetrator of the"
"offence had already been charged for the offence committed by him, there are no just and"
"equitable grounds to confiscate the vehicle belonging to the  appellant when the appellant"
"himself has not been a party to the offence in question and is neither bound by a relationship"
"of proximity to the accused and had only rented the vehicle to a third party. There is no equity"
"nor is it just to deprive the appellant of a vehicle worth approximately Rs. 1,300,000/- where"
"the persons convicted of the crime is deprived of Rs. 25,000/- each totalling Rs. 125,000/-."
"In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd Vs RFO, Ampara and another 2011 (1)"
"SLR 86, the registered owner of a vehicle was convicted on his plea for transporting timber"
"without  a  permit.  At  the  inquiry-whether  the  vehicle  should  be  confiscated  or  not,  the"
"absolute  owner  (finance  company)  from  whom  the  registered  owner  obtained  financial"
"assistance to purchase the vehicle gave evidence and claimed the vehicle. After inquiry, the"
"Magistrate  made  an  order  to  confiscate  the  vehicle.  The  revision  application  filed  by  the"
"Finance Company in the High Court was dismissed. The petitioner sought to revise the said"
"judgment."
"It  was  held  that  the  owner  envisaged  in  the  law  cannot  be  the  'absolute  owner'  (Finance"
"Company). The absolute owner has no control over the use of the vehicle except to retake"
"the possession of the vehicle for non-payment of instalments. No injustice would be caused"
