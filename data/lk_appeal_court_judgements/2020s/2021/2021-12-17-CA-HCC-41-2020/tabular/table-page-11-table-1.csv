"“Secondly, that he specifically instructed the company verbally that the vehicle could"
"not be used for any unlawful activity.”"
"In cross-examination, the  appellant had admitted that he was instructed by officers of the"
"company that the vehicle would only be used for operations related to company work, and"
"not for the private use of the 05th accused. He even said that he made enquiries about the 5th"
"accused and found that he was a person who resided in Kalutara. The appellant stated that"
"he did not specifically check whether the agreement signed with the company contained the"
"clause regarding the fact that the vehicle would not be used for any unlawful activity, and"
"that the said agreement did not contain a clause stating the same."
"However, he stated that he obtained a verbal promise from the company representatives that"
"the vehicle would not be used for any unlawful activity. He further stated that he questioned"
"the  company  on  why  the  agreement  did  not  contain  the  said  clause  and  the  company"
"representative told him that this agreement could not be changed to include such clauses. He"
"admitted that the agreement did not state the exact reason for which the vehicle would be"
"used  and  also  admitted that  the  agreement  did not  carry  a  clause  stating  that the  vehicle"
"could not be used for any illegal purpose."
"He also stated that even though he claimed to have called the company to verify the purpose"
"for which the vehicle would have been used, he had no means of confirming the same and he"
"admitted that the onus was on him to prove the same. He stated that he first got to know"
"that  the  vehicle  was  used  for  the  transportation  of  cannabis  from  the  police  and  that  he"
"should have been more vigilant on how his vehicle was being used."
"He also admitted that he had not taken any legal action against the said Ashan Enterprises at"
"the time of giving evidence. The above issues had been clarified during the re-examination of"
"the  appellant.  Thereafter,  the  appellant  had  called  another  witness  to  corroborate  and"
"confirm  his  evidence.  This  witness  is  one  Chulanga  Dinesh  Perera,  the  manager  of  Ashan"
"Enterprises."

"cleaning products, since 2006. He reported for work in the Meegoda branch where the 5th"
"accused worked in 2016. The products were distributed by sales representatives of whom the"
"5th  accused  was  one.  The  sales  representatives  were  provided  vehicle  facilities  by  the"
"company itself by supplying them with vehicles taken on rent by the company. The vehicle in"
"question had been rented by the company in 2012. The agreement had been signed by the"
"previous manager and this witness had no knowledge of the agreement."
"In  cross-examination,  he  was  questioned  as  to  whether  the  appellant  approached  the"
"company  as  claimed  by  the  appellant  and  he  stated  that  he  had  no  knowledge  of  those"
"incidents because he was not serving in the company at that time. He stated further that he"
"had no knowledge as to whether the appellant indeed looked into the purposes for which his"
"car was used and also does not have any acquaintance with the appellant, the main reason"
"being  that  he  had  come  into  service  at  the  said  Meegoda  branch  in  2016,  well  after  the"
"incident took place in 2012."
