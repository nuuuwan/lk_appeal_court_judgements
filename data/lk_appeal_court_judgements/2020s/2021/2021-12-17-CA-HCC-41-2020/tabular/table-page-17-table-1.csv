"to  the  Finance  Company  as  they  could  recover  the  amount,  they  spent  for  the  registered"
"owner by way of an action in the District Court based on a violation of the lease agreement."
"The learned counsel for the respondent submits that the legislature intended that the vehicles"
"used for illegal offences (where allowed by statute) should be necessarily confiscated. The"
"reasons  are  merely  not to punish,  but  to ensure  that  these  vehicles  are not  used  again  to"
"commit such offences and also to serve as a deterrence to other vehicle holders who may be"
"tempted to enter into bad and improper contracts, merely considering the monetary benefits"
"and  disregarding  the  precautions  they  need  to  take  by 
law  and  by 
judicial  precedent."
"Therefore, it is trite law that in many cases vehicles are confiscated because it is clearly the"
"intention of the legislature and therefore, it is well reasonable that it is an act done to prevent"
"the furtherance of such offences committed by vehicle owners who are not vigilant about the"
"process of the law. Thus, it is contended that it was and is the intention of the legislature,"
"especially  in  the  Poisons,  Opium,  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance,  that the  vehicle  should"
"necessarily be confiscated."
"However, going by Manawadu vs AG (supra), the learned counsel for the respondent says that"
"even if the appellant makes use of the opportunity to show that he either had no knowledge"
"of the crime or that he had taken all reasonable precautions, the appellant in the instant case"
"had failed to do so. It is the intention of the legislature and specific law. It cannot be said that"
"this is a violation of his rights and property right. Such matters are taken into consideration"
"by the respective authorities and forums."
"Therefore,  the  argument  tendered  by  the  appellant,  that  this  is  not  a  just  and  equitable"
"punishment  fails  when  one  considers  the  fact  that  the  accused  in  this  case  have  been"
"subjected to both fine and a suspended sentence, whilst the appellant has been subjected"
"only  to  the  forfeiture  of  the  vehicle  used  for  the  conveyance  of  the  illegal  substance.  The"
"respondent further says that forfeiture of property has been a standard standalone practice"
"throughout many jurisdictions around the world and that it is not necessarily connected to"
"the offender and the punishment received by such an offender."
"In  the  case  of  Oriental  Finance  Services  Corporation  Limited.  vs.  Range  Forest  Officer  and"
"Another 2011 (1) SLR- 86 it was held thus:"
"â€œIt 
is  therefore  seen  under  the  existing 
law  a  vehicle  transporting  timber  cannot  be"
"confiscated  if  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  on  a  balance  of  probability  establishes  one  of  the"
"following things;"
