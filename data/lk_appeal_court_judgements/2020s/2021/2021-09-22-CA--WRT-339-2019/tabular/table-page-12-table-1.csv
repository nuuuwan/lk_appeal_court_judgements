"Firstly, I observe that it is now settled law that a decision of the AAT on a PSC decision can"
"be impugned under Article 140 of the Constitution. The AAT is not a body exercising any"
"power delegated to it by the PSC but is an appellate tribunal constituted in terms of Article"
"59(1) of the Constitution (See Rathanayake v Administrative Appeals Tribunal & others, (2013)"
"1 Sri LR 331;Lakmini Delapola v Justice SI Imam & others, CA Writ Application, 263/2013, CA"
"minutes  26.07.2019;  and  K.N.  Mankotte  v  Justice  SI  Imam  &  others,  CA  Writ  249/2015,  CA"
"Minutes 06.03.2019). However, the jurisdiction of Court of Appeal under Article 140 would"
"be  limited  to  a  review  of  the  decision  of  the  AAT,  and  would  not  extend  to  quashing"
"decisions  of  the PSC  or  of  a  committee  or  public  official  to  whom  the  powers  of  the PSC"
"have  been  delegated.  (See  W.A.G.  Weerasinghe  v  P.M.K.  Malalasekara&  others,  CA  Writ"
"Application No. 256/2018, CA Minutes 19.03.2021)"
"By virtue of Article 59(2) of the Constitution, the AAT shall have the power to alter, vary,"
"or rescind any order or decision made by the PSC. The Petitioner's argument is that the said"
"Article  59(2)  does  not  permit  the  AAT  to  enter  an  order  ‘with  consent  of  parties’  and  the"
"impugned  order  made  by  AAT  appears  to  confirm/affirm  a  ‘new’  decision  of  the  PSC  to"
"appoint the Appellants."
"On a perusal of the said impugned order dated 28.05.2019 it appears that the AAT has taken"
"the final decision as follows:"
