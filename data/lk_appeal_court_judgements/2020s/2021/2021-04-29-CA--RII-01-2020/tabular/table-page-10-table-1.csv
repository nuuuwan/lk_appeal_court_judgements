"petitioners  are  not  challenging  the  pedigree  of  the  plaintiffs  and  they  are  not"
"claiming for undivided rights in the corpus. They are only asking for an exclusion of"
"the disputed lot no. 01. The District Court had decided that the predecessor in title"
"of the petitioners had prescribed to this disputed portion of land and at the time of"
"the  preliminary  survey  there  was  a  well  -  established  live  fence  separating  the"
"disputed lot 01 from the rest of the corpus. The commissioner has reported to court"
"that the disputed lot 01 is annexed to the adjoining land to which the predecessor"
"in  title  of  the  petitioners  became  entitled  under  the  final  decree  in  the  earlier"
"partition action which means that the disputed lot is possessed as a portion of that"
"adjoining land and not as a part of the corpus. There is no evidence to show that"
"the possession had changed into a third party. No one other than the petitioners"
"have come forward to claim for this disputed lot which means the possession had"
"not changed into a third party. Therefore on a balance of probability one can come"
"to the conclusion that Daniel’s heirs continued to be in possession in this disputed"
"lot after the death of Daniel. In those circumstances it is not necessary to direct the"
"learned  District  Judge  to  hold  an 
inquiry  to  see  whether  the  possession  had"
"changed during the course of a very long period of time since the judgement in case"
"no.  17128  ඉඩම්  pronounced 
in  1975.  Such  a  course  would  cause  delay  and"
"unnecessary  hardship  to  all  the  parties.  Accordingly  it  would  meet  the  ends  of"
"justice  if  without  setting  aside  the  interlocutory  decree  it  is  only  amended  by"
"excluding from the corpus the disputed lot no. 01 in the preliminary plan no. 2005P."
"Therefore I make order excluding the disputed lot 01 from the corpus and direct"
"the learned District Judge to amend the interlocutory decree accordingly. The final"
"decree  and  the  proceedings  leading up  to  it  from  the  stage  of  the interlocutory"
"decree  are  set  aside.  The  application  for  revision  is  allowed  and  the  plaintiffs  -"
"respondents shall pay the petitioners Rs. 31,500.00 as the cost of this application."
