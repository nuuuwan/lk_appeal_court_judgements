"The  position  of  the  respondent 
is  that  the 
learned  High  Court 
judge  had  given  due"
"consideration to the omissions. The respondent in this context deems it pertinent to draw"
"this Court's attention to the dicta in  Banda and others v AG 1999(3) SLR168, where it was"
"held that omissions do not stand in the same position as contradictions and discrepancies."
"The  said  omissions  cease  to  be  vital  omissions  that  go  into  the  root  of  the  case  or  to  the"
"identity of the accused persons."
"Quoting the dicta in Jayathunga v AG and another 2002(1) SLR197 at 202 and Wijerathne v"
"Republic of Sri Lanka 78 NLR 49 the learned President's Counsel said that there had been a"
"failure on the part of the learned trial judge to consider the defence evidence especially the"
"evidence given by the  accused-appellant before the  learned Trial Judge decided to sustain"
"the  conviction  of  the  accused-appellant.  When  an  accused  is  facing  a  capital  charge  it  is"
"essential that every point in favour of the accused though trivial should be placed before the"
"jury. As such, matters if placed before the jury it may create a reasonable doubt about the"
"benefit to which the accused is entitled. If, however, the circumstances against the accused"
"are emphasized and the trial judge expresses his opinion as to the adverse inferences and"
"fails to place the circumstances and inferences in favour of the accused before the jury, the"
"accused is then deprived of a substance of a fair trial."
"The  respondent  submits  that  the  02nd  accused-appellant  did  not  give  evidence,  he  only"
"made  a  dock  statement.  The  learned  high  court  judge  had  evaluated  the  dock  statement"
"made by the 02nd accused-appellant."
"The dicta in Jayathunga v AG and another 2002 (1) SLR 197 and Wijerathne v Republic of Sri"
"Lanka  78  NLR  49  ceases  to  hear  any  relevancy  whatsoever  as  the  instant  matter  was  not"
"tried by a jury but by a single judge. When a case is tried by a judge who has a trained legal"
"mind, it is not necessary to state every point in favour of the accused though trivial. As held"
"by His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew in  Abeysekera  Wannaku Arachchige Percy Bernard"
"vs AG - CA/119/2003, HC Negombo 233/2001 decided on 11.11.2008 reported on page 132"
"of Appellate Court Judgments  (Unreported) 2008 (Volume II)."
"The  contention  of  the 
learned  President's  Counsel  for  the  02nd  accused-appellant  that"
"Nelson had falsely implicated the 02nd accused-appellant in connection with this murder, as"
"the 02nd accused-appellant had assaulted Nelson previously. The reason for the assault was"
"that the mother of the 02nd accused-appellant was kept at Nelson’s house. The basis for the"
"learned President's Counsel to state  that was because at the time this incident took place"
"the  entire  place  and  surroundings  were  in  darkness.  Anyone  could  not  have  made  a  clear"
"identification of any of the persons who entered the house. The purported identification of"
"the  02nd  accused-appellant  by  the  alleged  eyewitnesses  are  according  to  the 
learned"
"President's Counsel, open to very serious suspicion."
