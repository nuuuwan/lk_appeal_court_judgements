"The learned President's Counsel contended that as regards the evidence of the 01st witness"
"Dinesh  Sampath 
is  concerned  vital  contradictions  marked  which  accordingly  created  a"
"reasonable doubt as to whether the witness was present in the room and was hiding behind"
"a clothes rack. The learned trial judge."
"According  to  the 
learned  President  Counsel  he  had  brushed  aside  these 
inconsistent"
"statements  stating  that  the  said  contradictions  do  not  go  into  the  roots  of  the  case.  The"
"learned  President's  Counsel  contended  that  when  the  evidence  is  analysed  in  the  proper"
"perspective the said contradictions and omissions are material as far as the question of the"
"identity of the accused is concerned. The said failure on the part of the  learned trial judge"
"occasioned a miscarriage of justice to the 02nd accused-appellant."
"As  far  as  the  evidence  of  Abeysinghalage  Dinesh  Sampath 
is  concerned  not  a  single"
"contradiction  or  an  omission  came  to  be  marked  or  pointed  out  on  behalf  of  the  02nd"

"behalf of the 01st accused-appellant. A further omission came to be pointed out on behalf of"
"the  04th  accused  (the  03rd  accused-appellant)  on  page  165  of  the  brief.  Another  omission"
"came  to  be  pointed  out  on  page  166  of  the  brief  on  behalf  of  the  04th  accused.  Another"
"omission came to be pointed out on page  169 of the brief. Not a single contradiction  was"
"marked on behalf of either of the accused persons."
