"This Court observed that after the judgment in CA/Writ 285/2008 in"
"which  the  aforesaid  divesting  order  P15  quashed,  the  1st  Petitioner"
"made a request to the 3rd Respondent, the Minister of Land and Land"
"Development  that  the  extent  of 
land  to  be  transferred 
in 
lieu  of"
"compensation (which was pending in respect of the portion of land on"
"which the Public Library was constructed and therefore could not be"
"divested)  be  increased,  taking  into  consideration  that  the  Petitioners"
"did  not  benefit 
from 
the  said  divesting  order  as 
the  same  was"
"quashed by this Court. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent approved the"
"said  request  of  the  Petitioner  and  subsequently  the  2nd  Respondent"
"instructed  the  1st  Respondent  (vide  P23)  to  take  necessary  steps  to"
"transfer 
an 
alternative 
land 
(in 
lieu 
of 
compensation) 
to 
the"
"Petitioners."
"However,  being  the  competent  officer  i.e.,  Acquiring  Officer,  the  1st"
"Respondent  has 
failed 
to 
take  necessary 
steps 
to 
transfer  an"
"alternative portion of land in lieu of compensation to the 1st Petitioner"
"and the heirs of R.G. Sirisena. According to my view, this inaction is,"
"to 
say 
the 
least,  unreasonable 
according 
to 
the 
standard 
of"
"unreasonableness  would  amount 
to  an  abuse  of  administrative"
"authority  set  out 
in  Associated  Provincial  Picture  Houses  Ltd.  vs."
"Wednesbury Corporation3."
"Further, 
the 
instant 
application 
presents 
peculiar 
facts 
and"
"circumstances which warrant interference by this Court to rectify an"
"apparent injustice - acquisition proceedings having commenced as far"
"back  as  1986  and  the  owners  are  denied  due  compensation  or"
"alternative  land  for  the  last  35  years.  As  the  Chief  Justice  Marshall"
"(then  he  was)  emphasized  in  Marbury  vs.  Madison4,  it  is  a  general"
"and indisputable rule that where there is a legal right, there is also a"
"legal remedy by suit or action at law whenever that right is invaded."
