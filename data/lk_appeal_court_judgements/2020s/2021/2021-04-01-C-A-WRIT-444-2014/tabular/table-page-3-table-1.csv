"At 
the 
section 
9 
inquiry  which  was 
held 
to 
determine 
the"
"compensation  payable,  the  1st  Petitioner  and  the  said  R.G.  Sirisena"
"had  submitted  their  title  documents 
for  the  entitlement  on  their"
"respective  shares  of  the  said  land.  Accordingly,  the  section  10(1)(a)-"
"Notice and the section 17 award have been published upon the above"
"information received by the State."
"The  Petitioners  state  that  although  the  said  property  acquired  in"
"1986,  up  to  2002  no  compensation  was  paid.  Therefore,  the  1st"
"Petitioner complained to the Public Petitions Committee of Parliament"
"for 
the  payment  of  compensation  and

accordingly, 
the 
committee 
gave 
a"
"recommendation,  recommending  the  divesture  of  a  portion  of  land"
"which  was  unutilised  and  for  the  payment  of  compensation  for  the"

"It  was  revealed  to  this  Court  that  the  Petitioners  later  requested  for"
"alternative  land  instead  of  compensation  and  upon  such  request,  a"

inter  alia,  as  5th  and  6th"

"It  was  in  those  circumstances,  the  1st  Petitioner  made  a  request  to"
