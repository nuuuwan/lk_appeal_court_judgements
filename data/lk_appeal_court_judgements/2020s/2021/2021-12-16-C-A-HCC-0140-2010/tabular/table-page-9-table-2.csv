"charges levelled against an accused beyond reasonable doubt."
"In the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148 it was held:"
"“The burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove all ingredients"
"of the charge beyond reasonable doubt and there is no burden in our law"
"for  the  accused  to  give  any  explanation  (unless  in  certain  cases  where"
"specific provision is made by law). In my view it is sufficient if the accused"
"gives  an  explanation  which  satisfies  the  Court  or  at  least  is  sufficient  to"
"create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.”"
