"mentioned in the short history given to him, he has not been specific as to his"
"examination other than making a general statement as such."
"The  victim  was  a  13-year-old  boy  at  the  time  of  the  incident  and  when  the"
"doctor who examined the victim says that there were no injuries to the victim,"
"his evidence cannot be considered corroboration of the evidence of the victim."
"Hence, I am in no position to disagree with the contention that the evidence of"
"the DMO was not corroborative of the evidence of the victim."
"This Court finds that the learned trial judge who had the benefit of listening to"
"the entirety of the evidence had at no stage of the judgment had concluded that"
"the evidence of the victim of any of the other witnesses for that matter was not"
