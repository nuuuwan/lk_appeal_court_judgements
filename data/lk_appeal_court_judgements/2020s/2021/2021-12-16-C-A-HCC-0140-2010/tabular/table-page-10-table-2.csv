"(1) While a Court of Appeal will always attach the greatest possible weight to"
"any  finding  of  fact  of  a  judge  of  a  court  of first  instance  based  upon  oral"
"testimony  given  before  that  judge,  it  is  not  absolved  by  the  existence  of"
"these  findings  from  the  duty  of  forming  its  own  view  of  the  facts,  more"
"particularly  in  a  case  where  the  facts  are  of  such  complication  that  there"
"right interpretation depends not only on any personal impression which a"
"judge  may  have 
formed  by 
listening 
to 
the  witness  but  also  upon"
"documentary  evidence,  and  upon 
inferences 
to  be  drawn 
from 
the"
"behaviour of these witnesses (demeanour and deportment) both before and"
"after  the  matters  on  which  they  give  evidence.  A  Court  of  Appeal  in  such"
"situations  is  free  to  overrule  such  findings  of  facts  if  it  appears  that  the"
"trial  judge  has  misdirected  himself  on  the  facts  or  that  wrong  inferences"
"have been drawn from the facts."
