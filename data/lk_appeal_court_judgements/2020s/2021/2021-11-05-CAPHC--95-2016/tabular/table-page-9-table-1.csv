ccording to the said statement of the Appellant, it amply proves that there were Eaves (අගුව)"
"adjoining to the Respondent’s shop premises and in between the Appellant’s land to access to the"
"rear portion of the Respondent’s shop premises, and the Respondent and his predecessors had been"
"using  the  same  from  time  immemorial.  Apparently,  the  said  position  was  substantiated  by  the"

"land ‘අගුව’ by the Appellant. Thus, the learned Primary Court Judge has come to the conclusion"
"that the Respondent has been dispossessed by the Appellant two months prior to the date of filing"
"of  the  information  before  the  Primary  Court,  in  terms  of  Section  68  of  the  Primary  Courts’"

"dispute between the parties falls under the purview of Section 69 of the Act since it involves a"
"servitudanal right of an Eaves of 3 feet wide. Hence, the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge"
"cannot stand against the Appellant, as it was made on the pretext of Section 68 of the Act and not"
"in fact in terms of Section 69 of the Act."
