"6.  The learned High Court judge in his  judgment at page 45 (page 304) of"
"the brief has said “මෙෙ නඩුමේ මපොලිස් නිළධාරීන්මේ සාක්ෂි විත්තිෙ විසින් හබ"
"කර මනොෙැත”. It is the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that"
"right throughout the case the defence has challenged the evidence of the"
"prosecution and clearly suggested their position."
"7.  It was the contention of the learned State Counsel for the respondent that"
"the appellant relies on two basic grounds of appeal, namely, the  learned"
"trial Judge’s failure to evaluate the evidence, credibility of the witnesses"
"and  the  improbability  of  the  prosecution  story  and  that  the  learned  trial"
"Judge  has  erred  when  he  misdirected  himself  on  the  law  and  the  facts."
"The  learned  State  Counsel  conceding  to  the  above  second  ground  of"
"appeal, submitted that the learned trial Judge clearly misdirected himself"
"on  those  issues  in  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  has  wrongly  shifted  the"
"burden of proof on to the appellant and also that the  learned trial Judge"
"has clearly  erred  when he  said  in his  judgment  that the defence  has not"
"challenged 
the  evidence  of 
the  prosecution  witnesses.  Therefore, 
the"
"conceded 
that 
the 
judgment 
convicting 
the 
learned  State  Counsel"
"appellant  on  the  offences  stated  in  the  indictment  cannot  be  allowed  to"
"stand."
"8.  As  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  and"
"conceded by the State Counsel for the respondent, the learned High Court"
"Judge has clearly erred in law when he shifted the burden of proof on to"
"the  appellant.  Further,  as  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"and conceded by the learned State Counsel, the learned High Court Judge"
"misdirected  himself  on  the  facts  when  he  said  in  his  judgment  that  the"
"defence has not challenged the evidence of the police witnesses, when in"
"fact the evidence of the police witnesses on the raid has been challenged"
"by the defence right throughout the case. Therefore, in the circumstances"
"the  conviction  of 
the  accused  appellant  on 
the  both  counts 
in 
the"
"indictment  cannot  be  allowed 
to  stand.  Hence 
the  conviction  of 
the"
"appellant by the learned High Court Judge is quashed."
"9.  It is the contention of the learned State Counsel that this is a fit case to be"
"sent for retrial, as retrial is in the best interests of justice as there is good"
"evidence 
to  secure  a  conviction  against 
the  appellant.  The 
learned"
