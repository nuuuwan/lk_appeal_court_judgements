"It is important to note Section 33 of the Partition Act, which reads as follows;"
"""The Surveyor shall so partition the land that each party entitled to compensation in"
"respect of improvements effected thereto or by of building erected thereon will, if that"
"party is entitled to a share of the soil, be allotted, so far as is practicable, that portion"
"of the land which has been so improved or build upon, as the case may be."""
"It is clear according to Partition Law, as well as all accepted legal principles that, the above lots"
"of the subject matter should be allocated to the parties considering their previous possession."
"In Moldrich Vs. La Brooy 14 NLR 331 Lascelles C.J. held that where improvements have been"
"affected with the assent of the co-owner, that portion of the land on which the improvements"
"stand should, if possible, be allotted, on a partition of the land, under Ordinance no. 10 of 1863,"
"to the co-owner who has made the improvements."
"The appellant has submitted පැ1 to පැ12 to prove his title and pedigree, without any objection"
"from the respondents. According to පැ1, Palliyage Heenhamy is entitled to 2/9th share of the"
"subject matter and her only son by පැ3, has gifted the above title to the appellant and hence"
"he is entitled to 2/9th share of the corpus without any dispute. It is clear that nobody claims"
"rights  to  block  A  of  the  corpus  which  is  1  Rood  and  8  Perches  in  extent  and  therefore  the"
"appellant has exclusive prescriptive title to the same. In his testimony the appellant has stated"
"that after the death of his father the plaintiff is in possession of the land and no respondents"
"have challenged that stance and therefore the appellant has exclusive prescriptive title to block"
"A of the corpus. The 8th and 9th defendants have relied on 8 වි 3 and 9 වි 1 to prove their title;"
"but, North and West boundaries of the 8 වි 3 and 9 වි 1 are totally different from the boundaries"
"set  out  in  පැ1  to  පැ12  except  in  පැ9  and  පැ10.  By  deed  bearing  No.  2807  (පැ9)  Hewage"
"Heenhamy  and  her  husband  Wekatiyage  Saravis  Appu  transferred  their  title  to  Wekatiyage"
"Dharmadasa."
"The said Heenhamy and Savaris Appu got title from the deed bearing No. 9592 (පැ8) and the"
"said Saravis Appu got title from the, deed bearing No. 21052 (පැ4), deed bearing No. 3388 (පැ7),"
"deed bearing No. 466(පැ5) and deed bearing No. 745 (පැ.6) according to the deed bearing No."
"9592 (පැ8). The boundaries of the පැ4, පැ7, පැ5, පැ6 are compatible with the boundaries of පැ1,"
"පැ2, පැ3; but in පැ9, above-said Heenhamy and Saravis Appu had changed the boundaries as"
"well as the extent of the corpus incorrectly."
"The  boundaries  and  the  extent  of  the  8වි3  and  9වි1  are  not  compatible  with  the  corpus"
"according to the X and X1. The deed marked 8වි3 as well as 9වි1 are first registrations of the"
"deeds and North and West boundaries of the same are not compatible with the same of the"
"Preliminary  Plan  X.  According  to  X  Preliminary  Plan,  west  boundary  of  the  corpus  is  ත ොස්"
"ත ොරටුව ත ොතහොත් මැදමණ්ඩිය but in 9වි1 the West boundary of the 8වි3 and 9වි1 are described"
"as  ජුගහ ත ොරටුව and  ැට ෑලගහ ත ොරටුව respectively. Therefore, boundaries are different"
"in  8වි3  and  9වි1.  When  compared  with  plan  X,  the  findings  of  the  learned  trial  Judge  are"
"incorrect and therefore the judgment is bad in law."
"Thus, it reflects that the learned Judge had not carefully examined and analyzed the evidence"
"and had not investigated the title of parties under section 25 of the Partition Act. The need for"
"a  careful  investigation  of  all  titles  has  been  emphatically  reiterated  by  our  Courts  in  many"
"decisions as mentioned above."
