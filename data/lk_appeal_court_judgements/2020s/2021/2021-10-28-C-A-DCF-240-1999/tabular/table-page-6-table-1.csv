"transfer bearing No. 504 dated 17.03.1909 and thus she became owner of 2/9th share of the"
"subject matter."
"The said Palliyage Simon Appu died intestate and the aforesaid Palliyage Heenhami the widow"
"and Sirineris Appu the son (plaintiff’s father) became the owners to the said 1/9th share of the"
"said  deceased  Palliyage  Simon  Appu  of  the  said  subject  matter  thereafter.  As  per  the  deed"
"marked පැ3 dated 25.11.1961 the aforesaid Sirineris Appu gifted 2/3rd share as stated in the"
"said deed to the original plaintiff. The two mortgage deeds marked and produced as ""පැ 11"""
"and ""පැ 12"" also proved the fact that Sirineris Appu had title over 2/3rd share of the subject"
"matter. The plaintiff, throughout his evidence maintained this position of his entitlement to the"
"subject matter without any hesitation."
"However,  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  erroneously  considered  only  one  statement"
"made by the plaintiff at the cross-examination and arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff"
"had accepted the  defendants’ pedigree and therefore not entitled to any title over the said"
"subject  matter.  The  learned  trial  Judge's  conclusion,  regarding  the  fact  that,  the  plaintiff"
"admitting  the  1/6th  share  of  the  8th  defendant’s  title  and  the  8th  defendant  denying  the"
"plaintiff’s title tantamount to acceptance of the entire pedigree of the defendants, is totally"
"misconceived in law."
"The learned trial Judge had failed to evaluate the documentary evidences adduced before him"
"at  the  trial  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff  in  which  the  learned  trial  Judge  once  in  his  judgment"
"accepted the fact that the plaintiff had proved his pedigree.  The learned trial Judge also failed"
"to acknowledge the fact that none of the documentary evidence placed by the defendants does"
"not reveal the fact that the said Siyadoris Appu was the original owner of the undivided 2/3rd"
"share of the subject matter."
