"or a male organ the JMO opined to the effect that the tear could take place either way. He had"
"further testified to the effect that his observation is consistent with the short history given to him"
"by the prosecutrix. Having testified same on being questioned as to whether the prosecutrix had"
"been subjected to the act repeatedly the JMO had opined  to the effect that there could have"
"been either one or repeated acts."
"Police  Sergeant  28873  Shantha  Kumara  (PW  11)  who  had  assisted  the  chief  investigator;  IP"
"Weerarathne  testified  to  the  effect  that  the  chief  investigator  had  passed  away  from  a  fatal"
"accident and also that as he assisted the IP with the investigations and was present at the time"
"the notes of observations were made by the IP, he was in a position to testify on behalf of the"
"late IP Weerarathne. The witness testified that the first complaint had been lodged on 11.06.2011"
"at 12.20 hrs. from Carder Midin Nadeeja. The IP had testified about his observations of the place"
"of incident. There had been three shops in one line with a single roof. The prosecutrix had pointed"
"the shop in the middle as the place of the incident."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  that,  in  her  examination-in-chief,  the"
"prosecutrix  testified  as  to  the  time  period  during  which  the  alleged  offences  took  place.  She"
"testified  that  on  three  occasions  the  appellant  committed  sexual  offences  on  her  and  she"
"informed her mother two months after the incident. She further testified that the three sexual"
"offences took place during a period of one month. She further testified that the three incidents"
"had taken place within a space of five days."
"According to the prosecutrix, she had informed her mother two months after the last sexual act."
"According to the Judicial Medical Officer (PW3), he had examined the prosecutrix on 14.06.2011"
"at 10am. As to the medical history obtained from the victim, the boutique keeper of a kiosk had"
"inserted his finger to her vagina twice and also attempted to insert his penis to her vagina, ten"
"days before. As per medical history narrated by the prosecutrix, no penetration had taken place"
"but only an attempt to penetrate. The JMO (PW3) testified that the sexual act had taken place"
"ten days prior to the medical examination."
"As per the JMO, the injury is of recent origin, which could have taken place ten days prior to the"
"medical examination. In the circumstances, the accused-appellant argues that the evidence of"
"the prosecutrix is not corroborated by the medical evidence in so far as the time at which the"
"sexual act took place. While the medical evidence exonerates the appellant it also opens up a"
"possibility of the involvement of a third person, other than the appellant."
"The learned counsel for the appellant says that the trial Judge however did not address his mind"
"to this glaring inconsistency between the version of the prosecutrix and the testimony of the JMO"
