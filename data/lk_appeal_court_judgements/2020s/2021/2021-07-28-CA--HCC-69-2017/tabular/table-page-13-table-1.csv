"I would like to add that the appellant is not in a position to quote portions from the statement of"
"the prosecutrix to the police at the appeal stage. This Court is called upon only to evaluate the"
"evidence that was led in the High Court trial. The only instance in which this Court is permitted"
"to peruse Information-Book extracts and read statements is when looking in to the veracity of an"
"omission or a contradiction. This was held in Keerthi Bandara V. Attorney General; 2000 (2) SLR"
"at 245."
"The  testimony  of  the  prosecutrix  makes  it  apparent  that  there  was  not  a  single  reason  in"
"existence,  which  resulted  in  the  prosecutrix  to  concoct  and  fabricate  a  false  case  against  the"
"accused-appellant. The testimony of the prosecutrix was devoid of exaggeration;  she was not"
"keen to testify."
"The  only  reason  which  resulted  in  the  failure  of  the  prosecutrix  to  testify  with  regard  to  the"
"penetration was simply owing to the fact that the prosecutrix was called upon to testify in respect"
"of incidents that had taken place five years ago, when she was in the tender age of ten years and"
"studying in year seven and it is natural for the prosecutrix, not to have a video camera memory"
"and forget certain incidents over the passage of time evolving from the tender age of ten to a"
"fifteen-year-old."
"The  Judicial  Medical  Officer  attributed  the  hymeneal  tears  to  have  taken  place  owing  to  the"
"insertion  of  an  external  object  by  opining  to  the  effect  that  there  is  a  greater  possibility  as"
"opposed to that of natural circumstances for the hymeneal tears to have taken place owing to"
"the insertion of an external object which could either be a male organ or a finger."
"The Learned High Court judge arrived at the decision having taken in to consideration the dicta"
"in Bobby Mathew Vs State of Karnataka; 2004 (3) Cri. L. J page 30003. It was held that;"
