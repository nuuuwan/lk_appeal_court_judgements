"also apart from  the provisions of the said  clause 4.2 in view of regulating admission of"
"children. However, information to that effect has not been provided to this Court either"
"by the Petitioners or by the Respondents of this application."
"All  Government  schools  in  the  country  do  not  fall  in  to  the  category  of  vested  schools"
"under the above Acts1. Therefore, in my view, the schools that have not been vested under"
"the  provisions  of  the  said  Acts,  are  not  required  to  restrict  any  child  being  admitted,"
"provided  that  the  learning  medium  and  the  gender  of  the  child  is  compatible  to  the"
"respective school  and  however,  subject  to  the other  provisions  of  the annual  admission"
"circular. If an Assisted school that vested under the said Acts is located within the close"

"admission of Christian students. According to the said Affidavit of the 13A Respondent,"
"it is apparent that these 10 schools are not vested schools under the said Acts. The reasons"
"adduced above emanates that those 10 schools admit or have the capacity to admit even"
"children of non-Roman Catholic Christians (the religion of the 1st Petitioner) without any"
"hindrance,  restriction  or  limitation  and  without  maintaining  a  minimum  or  maximum"
"percentage."
"However, the Petitioners’ contention is that the Respondents have failed to establish that"
"the aforesaid 12 schools upon which a maximum of 40 marks were deducted from the 1st"
"Petitioner has in fact admitted 10% or more non-Roman Catholic Christian children over"
"the past few years. The Petitioners further argue that the Southland College is supposed to"
