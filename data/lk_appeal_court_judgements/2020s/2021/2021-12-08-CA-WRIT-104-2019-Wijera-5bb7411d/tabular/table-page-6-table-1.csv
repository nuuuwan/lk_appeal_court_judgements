"4.2 of the said circular marked R1 (clause 3.2 of the circular marked P1) and submit that"
"the  Respondents  are  under  a  legal  duty  to  admit  6.9%  non-Roman  Catholic  Christian"
"children,  including  the  1st  Petitioner  to  the  Southlands  College  to  Grade  1  for  the  year"
"2019."
"The  first  question  that  has  to  be  examined  relates  to  the  basis  upon  which  the  alleged"
"deduction of marks has been made. The Petitioners’ contention is that in terms of clause"
"7.2.4 of the said circular (R1), 04 marks could be deducted for other government schools"
"within the radius only if such school admits 10% or more children of the religion to which"
"the  child  belongs.  Further  the  Petitioner  submits  that  the  Respondents  have  failed  to"
"establish that the 10 schools listed in amended statement of limited objections of the 1st &"
"11th  to  13th  Respondents,  for  which  40  marks  have  been  deducted,  admit  10%  or  more"

"under  the  close  proximity  category  shall  be  awarded  only  if  the  applicant's  place  of"
"residence is proved and if there are no other Government schools with primary sections"
"located closer to the place of residence than the school applied for. In the event of having"
"other Government schools with primary section for the admission of the child which are"
"closer to the place of residence than the school applied for, marks shall be deducted at the"
"rate of 04 marks from the maximum marks for each school."
"The said clause further stipulates that ‘other Government primary schools that the child"
"could be admitted implies, whether the school concerned has learning medium the child"
"has applied for / whether it is a girls or boys school or a mixed school appropriate for the"
"child and whether the school admits 10% or more children of the religion to which the"
"child belongs.’ (Emphasis added)"
"For the purpose of clarity, I have also drawn my attention to the Sinhala version of the"
"relevant portion in the circular which is as follows;"
