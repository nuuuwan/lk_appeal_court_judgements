"E.  The Learned Trial Judge has erred in disregarding the glairing"
"discrepancies  between 
the  evidence  of 
the  prosecutrix  and"
"medical evidence."
"F.  The  Learned  trial  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the 
lack  of"
"credibility of the prosecutrix and has erred in law by neglecting"
"the  need  of  cogent  evidence  on  her  part,  especially 
in  the"
"absence of any corroborating evidence."
