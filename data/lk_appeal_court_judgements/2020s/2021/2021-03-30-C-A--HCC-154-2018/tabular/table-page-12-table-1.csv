"is not usual behaviour expected of a boy of that age. In such a circumstance, it is difficult"
"to predict the behaviour of such a person."
"The testimony of PW 1 and PW 2 corroborates on some points. However, when"
"the evidence of the accused is considered, he has admitted the brandishing of the knife"
"and  that  he  may  have  caused  some  injury  trying  to  defend  himself.  On  a  perusal  of"
"evidence  there is no proof beyond reasonable doubt established by the prosecution, that"
"the accused had the intention of causing injuries which in the ordinary course of nature"
"were  sufficient  to  cause  death.  There  is  a  distinction  between  an  intention  to  inflict"
"injuries which are only likely to cause death and injuries which are sufficient to cause"
"death, as explained  in  Ranjit Wijesiri alias Wije vs The Attorney General (Supra)."
"When considering the evidence in totality of how the incident had occurred, it"
"is apparent that there was no animosity or ill will existing between the parties and that"
"there  was  no  motive  as  such  to  deliberately  cause  injury  to  PW  1,  PW  2  and  the"
"deceased."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  State  in  her  written  submissions  and  also  at  the"
"argument submitted that the injury suffered by the deceased is the left lung and the heart"
"being  pierced  by  a  pointed  weapon  which  could  have  been  caused  by  the  weapon"
"identified by the doctor, and that the murderous intention of the accused is established"
"by the attendant circumstances."
"It appears that at the trial court the defence has not raised a plea of sudden fight."
"In this connection I am guided by the following judicial decisions."
