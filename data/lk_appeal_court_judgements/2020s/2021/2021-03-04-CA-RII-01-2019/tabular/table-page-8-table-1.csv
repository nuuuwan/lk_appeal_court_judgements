"into the settlements as an additional condition. That clearly shows that it was"
"not  a  part  of  the  original  settlement.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  Defendant"
"Respondents has conceded in this court that the disputed additional condition"
"was not in the original agreement. Therefore, one can come to the conclusion"
"on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  Defendants  Respondents  new,  or  a"
"reasonable  person  should  have  known,  that  a  mistake  was  being made.  That"
"mistake was excusable even where there was absence of knowledge on the part"
"of the Respondents. Therefore, the disputed additional condition incorporated"
"into the settlement can be set aside on these grounds."
"For the aforesaid reasons we set aside the settlement/ Compromise pertaining"
"to  the  disputed  additional  condition  and  direct  the  learned  District  Judge  to"
"amend the consent decree accordingly."
"The application of the Plaintiff Petitioner is allowed. In the circumstances of this"
"case, we make no order for costs."
