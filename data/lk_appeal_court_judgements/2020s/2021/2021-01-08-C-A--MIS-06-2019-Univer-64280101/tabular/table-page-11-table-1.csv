"reasons  therefore  were sent  to  that person  by  registered post,  under  subsection  (4)  of"
"Section 36."
"It was argued that because Section 36(4) is referred to in the context of the dispatch of the"
"decision  and reasons  to  the  member  of  the  staff who preferred the  appeal,  the  person"
"aggrieved in Section 37 must mean the member of the staff and him alone. In other words"
"it is the appellant staff member before the University Appeals Board who could appeal to"
"the Court of Appeal and the University has not been bestowed with such a right of appeal."
"I am afraid I cannot agree with this interpretation that is sought to be placed on Section"
"37."
"Indubitably, the right of appeal must be conferred by statute. But a synoptic reading of"
"Sections 36(4) and Section 37  along with Section 2 supports the position that a right of"
"appeal is also available to the University."
"In my view, though at first blush the words ""person aggrieved"" read with the words ""sent"
"to that person by registered post, under subsections (4) of Section 36"" appear to restrict it"
"to a member of the staff who was the appellant, the Rules framed under the Act in regard"
"to University Appeals Board explain what is meant by the words ""convey to the board"" its"
"decision.  The rules have been attached to the documents tendered to the Court and the"
"rules make it a requirement that the final decision of the University Appeals Board shall"
"be communicated to the parties by registered post, and a copy thereof shall be forwarded"
"to the Chairman of the Board of Governors of University of Vocational Technology."
"Expatiating the words ""convey to the board its decision and the reasons therefore, along"
"with a report on such appeal or investigation"" in a such a manner as to insist on a mode of"
"conveyance by way of registered post is not repugnant to Section 36(4) of the Act and it is"
"how a parity of equality would be harmoniously read into Section 37 of the UNIVOTEC"
"Act."
