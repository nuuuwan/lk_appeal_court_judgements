"According to him, if the University loses in the appeal filed by the member of the staff, the"
"University  does  not  enjoy  a  right  of appeal  to challenge  the  decision  of  the  University"
"Appeals Board. This is because no right of appeal has been granted by Section 37."
"Mr.  Suren  Gnanaraj  on  the  other  hand contended  that  Section  37  speaks  to  a  person"
"aggrieved. It includes the University of Vocational Technology which is aggrieved by the"
"decision of the University Appeals Board. Section 37 has to be interpreted in such a way"
"as  to enhance the right of appeal.  Mr.  Suren Gnanaraj, the learned Counsel for  the State,"
"also argued that the words ""person aggrieved"" has to be interpreted in terms of Section 20f"
"the Interpretation Ordinance, wherein the word ""person"" has been interpreted to include"
"any body of persons corporate or unincorporated."
"Thus what comes up for resolution before this Court is the interpretation of Section 37 of"
"the University of Vocational Technology Act, No.3l of 2008."
"Undoubtedly  Section  36(4)  states  the  modes  of  communicating  the  decision  of  the"
"University Appeals Board to the parties before it."
"To the Board of Governors of the University,"
