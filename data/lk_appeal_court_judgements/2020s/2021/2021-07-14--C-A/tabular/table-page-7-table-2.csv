"2004 3 SLR 180 observed thus:"
"""…….  the  decision  must  in  each  case  depend  on  its  own  facts"
"and circumstances. But, in order that like cases will be decided"
"alike, there should be uniformity of decisions, it is necessary that"
"guidance should be laid down for the exercise of that discretion”"
"(emphasis added)"
