"This evidence shows that regardless of the method of loading the pistol, if there"
"is a cartridge in the chamber and if the trigger is pulled, the gun fires. In view of"
"this  evidence,  the  evidence  of  the  first  accused  cannot  be  rejected  as  false"
"evidence. At least it creates a reasonable doubt as to whether he intended to kill"
"the  deceased.  The  benefit  of  the  doubt  should  have  been  awarded  to  the  first"
"accused."
"There was no motive at all to kill the deceased. The deceased and the two accused"
"were friends, and there was no animosity between the accused and the deceased."
"The accused and the deceased met clearly by chance. There was no evidence at"
"all to establish a pre-meditated plan between the two accused.  The subsequent"
"conduct of the accused is compatible with the defense version. The first accused"
"himself  took  the  deceased  immediately  to  the  nearest  hospital.  The  second"
"accused  voluntarily  handed  over  the  weapon  to  the  police  immediately.    The"
"accused did not try to deny their involvement.  At the trial, they admitted several"
"facts which the prosecution would have had to establish otherwise."
"However, the first accused should have acted more prudently when he took the"
"gun from the second accused. Both accused had consumed liquor.  However, the"
"first accused should have known that he might cause the death of his friend if"
"the  gun  went  off.  Even  though  the  first  accused  did  not  intend  to  kill  the"
"deceased, he should have had that knowledge."
"There is no evidence to establish that the second accused had common intention"
"to kill the deceased.  For the reasons set out above, the conviction and sentence"
"against the second accused is set aside. The second accused is acquitted of the"
"charge."
