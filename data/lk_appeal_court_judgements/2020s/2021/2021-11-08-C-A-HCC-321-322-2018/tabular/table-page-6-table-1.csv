"To convict the appellants, the Trial Judge has come to the following findings as"
"per the evidence of PW1."
"1.  The motorcycle rider was the first accused, and the defense version is"
"not compatible with that evidence."
"2.  If  the  first  accused  rode  the  motorcycle,  the  second  accused  should"
"have given his pistol to the first accused.  If so, the inference that could"
"be drawn is that they have agreed to kill the deceased."
"3
.  The pistol was loaded, but according to the evidence of the 2nd accused,"
"he had not kept the pistol loaded.  It was not possible to fire the gun"
"accidentally."
"The  first  accused  gave  evidence  under  oaths.    The  State  Counsel  extensively"
"cross-examined him.  The first accused admitted that he took the gun out of the"
"trouser  pocket  of  the  second  accused  and  tried  to  show  it  to  the  deceased  to"
"perform  a  joke  and  never  denied  that  he  caused  the  firearm  injury  to  the"
"deceased.  His  position  was  that  he  never  intended  nor  wanted  to  kill  the"
"deceased.  The incident happened due to his foolishness."
"The Trial Judge himself concedes that the subsequent conduct of the appellants"
"is compatible with the defense version. The incident happened at 10.00 pm.   The"
"accused  came  from  the  opposite  direction,  where  the  car  was  stopped.    If  the"
"accused had come to kill the deceased, they could have fled the place quickly on"
"their motorcycle. PW1 stated that at that time, no other people were there. They"
"waited there, and the first accused himself drove the car to the nearest hospital"
