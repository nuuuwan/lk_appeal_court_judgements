"and to be, an implied condition of the occupation by persons of such quarters."
"The term “Government Quarters” referred to in Section 2 above is defined under"
"Section  9 of the Act to include  any building or room or other accommodation"
"occupied  for  the  use  of  residence  which  is  provided  by  or  on  behalf  of  the"
"Government or any public corporation to any person and includes any land or"
"premises in which such building or room or other accommodation is situated."
"Upon  perusal  of  the  above  provisions,  it  appears  that  the  applicability  of  the"
"Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act to a particular premises does"
"not simply depend on a public officer’s entitlement to a Government Quarter or"
