"Dhammika Ganepola, J."
"The Petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Writ of"
"Certiorari quashing the quit notice issued in terms of the Government Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969, marked as P4 to the Petition. Both"
"parties agreed to conclude the case by way of written submissions. Anyhow none"
"of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected"
"matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that"
"the facts relating to each are different. While the Petitioner was an employee of"
"the Prima Ceylon Ltd, he had been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises"
"at C-26 in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay, Trincomalee upon the Lease"
"Agreement P2 entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner."
"The Petitioner states that though he has complied with all terms and conditions"
"of the said agreement P2, there had been several attempts on the part of the"
"Food Commissioner to recover possession of the premises in issue.  Later on, the"
"Petitioner has been served with a quit notice in term of the Government Quarters"
"a requiring him to vacate the premises since the Petitioner has acted in breach of"
"the  terms  of  the  said  Lease  Agreement.  In  spite  of  such  circumstances,  the"
"Petitioner  has 
lodged  this  Petition  before  this  Court  moving  for  a  Writ  of"
"Certiorari  quashing  the  quit  notice  marked  P4  stating  that  the  purported  quit"
"notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below."
"i. 
no valid reason has been given and the reasons stated in the said notice"
"are vague"
"ii. 
the  Respondent  has  procured  a  violation  of  the  Lease  Agreement  by"
"refusing to accept the rental payment."
"The Petitioner conceded the fact that the impugned house and the premises has"
"been granted to him by the Food Commissioner on a Lease Agreement p2. The"
"said  agreement  R4  specifies  that  the  subject  house  and  the  premises  are"
"Government Quarters in terms of Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession)"
"Act.  Hence  the  Petitioner  is  stopped  from  denying  the  same.  On  the  above-"
"premise, the applicability of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession)"
"Act in respect of the impugned house and premises cannot be disputed."
"The Petitioner denies the allegation of violation of terms and conditions of the"
"Lease Agreement referred in the quit notice."
"It appears that the Petitioner has taken the possession of the premises in issue"
"upon a Lease Agreement marked P2 to the Petition. The said Lease Agreement,"
