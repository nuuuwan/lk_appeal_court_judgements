"Section 51A(2) will apply only where the value declared in the VDF has been initially"
"accepted  â€“ though  the  goods may or  may  not have been  cleared.   Since  the  words"
"initially accepted only appear in Section 51A(2), the conclusion that can be drawn is"
"that Section 51A(1) will apply to instances prior to acceptance of the values declared"
"in the VDF.  This is substantiated by the fact that Section 51A(1) refers to the bill of"
"entry and documents supporting a bill of entry in addition to the VDF."
