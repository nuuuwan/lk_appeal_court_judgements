"as  provided  in  Section  18(2)  of  the  Customs  Ordinance.1  This  was  instead  a  case,"
"according  to  Sri  Lanka  Customs,  where  the  importer  had  deliberately  withheld  the"
"true value from Sri Lanka Customs and made a false declaration, thereby attracting"
"the  provisions  of  Section  52  of  the  Customs  Ordinance.  Hence,  the  necessity  to"
"conduct  an  inquiry,  thereby  affording  the  Petitioners  an  opportunity  of  presenting"
"their side of the story."
