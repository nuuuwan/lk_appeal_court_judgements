"Whether Sri Lanka Customs should act under Sections 51A(2), 18(2) or under Section"
"52 is a matter that must be decided by the Inquiry Officer at the end of the inquiry."
"Hence, the interim order sought by the Petitioners is misconceived."
"A
t  the  time  this  matter  was  supported,  the  position  advanced  by  the 
learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  was  that  the  2nd  Petitioner  is  not  conversant"
"with  English  and  that  the  2nd  Petitioner  has  been  prejudiced  by  the  inquiry  being"
"conducted 
in  English.  The 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel  submitted  that  the  2nd"
"Petitioner has conducted business in Sri Lanka for almost ten years and that he is in"
"fact conversant with the English language. As I have already observed, the services of"
"an English-Chinese Translator was made available by the Inquiry Officer, and the 2nd"
"Petitioner  had  no  objection 
to 
the 
inquiry  proceeding  with 
that 
translator."
"Furthermore,  the  Petitioner  declined  the  services  of  an  Attorney-at-Law  when  the"
"Inquiry  Officer 
inquired  from  the  2nd  Petitioner  on  the  first  date  of  the 
inquiry"
"whether he required the services of an Attorney-at-Law. That, together with the fact"
"that  the  Petitioner  had  ample  time  to  obtain  the  services  of  an  Attorney-at-Law"
"between the first and second date of the inquiry fortifies my view that the Petitioner"
"has  been  afforded  a  fair  hearing. 
I  therefore  do  not  see  any  merit 
in  the  said"
"submission on behalf of the Petitioner."
"S
everal questions of law have been raised in the written submissions filed on behalf"
"of the Petitioners. Prior to considering the said questions, it would be appropriate to"
"discuss the provisions of the Customs Ordinance relating to the declaration of a value"
"of a good."
"T
he importance of an importer declaring to Sri Lanka Customs the correct value of a"
"good was considered by this Court in Mark Santhakumar Sandanam vs Chulananda"
"Perera, Director General of Customs and Others,2 where it was held as follows:"
"“The  Customs  Ordinance  stands  on  three  important  pillars.  The  first  is  that  all"
"goods  imported  (or  exported)  to  the  country  must  be  declared  to  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs3.  The  second  is  that  a  proper  and  truthful  description  of  the  goods"
"must be  made  at the  time of  importation. The  third and final  pillar is that the"

"leave to appeal in SC (Spl LA) Application No. 406/2018; SC Minutes of 8th August 2019."
