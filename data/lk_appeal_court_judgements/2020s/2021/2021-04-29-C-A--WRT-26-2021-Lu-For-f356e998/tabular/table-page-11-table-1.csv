"Officer  doubts  the  truth  or  accuracy  of  the  values  so  provided.  Section  51A  was"
"introduced to facilitate this process of ascertaining the true value and to provide for"
"a  mechanism  to  deal  with  inaccuracies 
in  the 
information  provided 
in  the  VDFs"
"submitted under Section 51."
"A
  close  examination  of  Section  51A  would  therefore  reveal  that  it  caters  to  four"
"different  scenarios.  The  first  is,  where  the  VDFs  and  supporting  documents  reflect"
"the correct customs value, the declared value will be accepted and the goods will be"
"released by Sri Lanka Customs upon the payment of the Customs duties calculated in"
"terms of Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance."
"The  second  scenario  is  where  there  is  a  doubt  as  to  the  truth  or  accuracy  of  any"
"particulars  contained 
in  a  Bill  of  Entry, 
the  VDFs  and 
supporting  documents"
"presented in respect of a Bill of Entry under  Section 47, prior to  the acceptance of"
"the value declared in the VDFs, and prior to the release of the goods. At this point,"
"Section 51A(1) is triggered and the Customs Officer is empowered to determine and"
"amend the Customs value in accordance with the appropriate Article of Schedule E."
"The  goods  shall  be  released  upon  the  payment  of  duties  on  the  amended  value  as"
"determined by Customs."
"T
he  third  scenario 
is  provided 
in  Section  51A(2).  Accordingly,  where  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs  finds  after  an  examination,  investigation  or  post  audit  carried  out  under"
"Section 128A, after the values declared in the VDFs have been accepted but before"
"the  goods  are  cleared  that  the  values  declared  are 
inappropriate,  the  Customs"
"officer is empowered to amend the value in accordance with the appropriate Article"
"of Schedule E. Here too, the goods shall be released upon the payment of duties on"
"the amended value as determined by Customs."
"The  fourth  scenario 
is  where  the  Sri  Lanka  Customs  finds  after  an  examination,"
"investigation or post audit carried out under Section 128A, after the VDFs have been"
"accepted and after the goods are cleared that the values declared are inappropriate,"
"Sri Lanka Customs is empowered by Section 51A(2) to amend the value in accordance"
"with the appropriate Article of Schedule E."
