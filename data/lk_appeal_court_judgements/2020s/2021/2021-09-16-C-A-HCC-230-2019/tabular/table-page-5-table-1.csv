"Although  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  accused  formulated  three"
"grounds  of  appeal  for  consideration,  I  would  now  proceed  to  consider  them"
"together since all the grounds urged are interwoven."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that  the  prosecution"
"has failed to call the storekeeper of the business establishment to prove that in"
"fact  the  goods  mentioned  in  the  cash  voucher  P-01  were  delivered  to  the"
"defendant  and  also  evidence  from  the  accounts  division  of  the  company  to"
"establish  that  the  amount  claimed  was  not  settled.  It  was  his  view  that  the"
"prosecution has failed to establish the main ingredients of the charge by failing"
"to prove the value of the goods claimed to be cheated by the accused."
"It  was  also  his  contention  that  vital  contradictions  revealed  in  evidence  as  to"
"the document marked P-01 has escaped the attention of the learned trial judge."
"It was his position, that according to the evidence of PW-03, the receipt for the"
"goods  delivered  to  the  accused  has  been  handed  over  to  the  accused  at  the"
"point of delivery. However, the investigating officer PW-11’s evidence had been"
"that the receipt P-01 was handed over to him by the complainant PW-02, which"
"in his view was a major contradiction and it was not safe to convict a person on"
"such unsafe evidence."
"It was the contention of the learned SSC for the Attorney General that it is the"
"totality  of  the  evidence  that  has  to  be  considered  in  a  trial  of  this  nature  and"
"the document marked P-01 was an admitted document in several ways. It was"
"her  view  that  admitted  facts  need  no  further  proof  in  accordance  with  the"
"provisions of the Evidence Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code and the"
"prosecution  has  proved  its  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  hence  no  basis  for"
"the appeal."
"It  is  well  settled  law  that  it  is  the  totality  of  the  evidence  that  has  to  be"
"considered in a trial and not pieces of evidence in its isolation. I am of the view"
"that the totality of the evidence means the evidence of the prosecution as well"
