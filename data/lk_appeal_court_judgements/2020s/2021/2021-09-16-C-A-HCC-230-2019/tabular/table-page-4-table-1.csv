"Thuwan  Rafaideeen  (PW-03)  who  delivered  the  goods.  The  accused  has  taken"
"delivery  of  35  CPUs  at  a  place  near  Liberty  Plaza  building  and  has  asked  the"
"driver  to  deliver  the  balance  to  a  place  near  Kolonnawa,  promising  to  pay  for"
"the  goods  upon  full  delivery.  After  receiving  the  goods  and  the  cash  payment"
"receipt from PW-03, the accused has asked the driver to wait for five minutes"
"until  he  brings  the  money.  However,  since  the  accused  failed  to  return  as"
"agreed, the driver  has informed PW-01, the person who tasked him to deliver"
"the  goods  to  the  accused.  The  driver,  and  PW-01  who  arrived  at  the  place  of"
"delivery  subsequently,  has  been  made  to  wait  until  11.30  in  the  night  by  the"
"accused  with  the  promise  to  pay  and  had  later  informed  them  that  he  will"
"make the payment on the following day."
"Since the accused had failed to pay even on the following day, it was the PW-"
"02, the owner of the establishment who has made the relevant complaint to the"
"Police. It is also evidence that the accused has handed back the invoice marked"
"P-01 which was in his possession at the Police station. He  has also given the"
"letter marked P-02, undertaking to pay the sum due."
"It appears that the accused has taken several contradictory stands during the"
"cross  examination  of  the  witnesses  for  the  prosecution  as  well  as  in  his  dock"
"statement when called for a defence."
"It  has  been  suggested  to  the  owner  of  the  establishment,  namely  PW-02  that"
"the  accused  never  received  the  goods  mentioned  in  the  sales  invoice  P-01."
"However, in cross examining PW-01 who in fact sold the goods to the accused,"
"the position of the accused had been that he has to  pay only a small amount"
"more for the goods delivered, which gives the inference that he in fact received"
"the goods as mentioned. Making a dock statement, it has been his stand that"
"he  paid  cash  for  all  the  goods  mentioned  in  the  charge  against  him  and  the"
"receipt issued to him  was taken over by the complainant at the Police station."
