"means  that  a  supply  of  financial  services  is  not  taxable  unless  the  supply  is  for"
"consideration  and  second,  there  must  be  a  direct  link  between  the  supply  of"
"services  provided  and  consideration  [(Kretztechnik  AG  v.  Finanzamt  Linz  Case"
"C-465/03 (2005) ECR 1-435, ECJ , paragraph 36)]."
"[151]  It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  Appellant  had  received  income  from  sale  of"
"shares 
in 
the  share  market  and 
the 
taxability  of  a  share 
issue  depends  on"
"whether  any  supply  of  service  provided  constitutes  a  business  of  supplying  of"
"financial services for consideration within the meaning of Section 25A."
"[152] The question whether the issuance of new shares to finance the business"
"of a company was “supply for consideration” within the meaning of Article 2 (1) of"
"the  EU,  VAT  Sixth  Directive  was  considered  by 
the  ECJ 
in 
the  case  of"
"Kretztechnik AG v. Finanzamt Linz Case C-465/03 (2005) ECR 1-435, ECJ. The"
"first question that was considered by the ECJ was whether the issuance of new"
"shares  in  connection  with  Kretxtechnik’s  entry  to  the  stock  market,  in  order  to"
"finance its business activities was a supply for consideration within the meaning"
"of  Article  2  (1)  of  the  Sixth  Directive.  The  ECJ.  held  that  the  issuance  of  new"
"shares in the stock market was to finance its business activities and was not a"
"part of a commercial activity of dealing in securities and thus, it was not a supply"
"for consideration within the scope of Article 2 (1) of the Sixth Directive."
"[153] It is noted that Article 2 (1) of the Sixth VAT Council Directive that defines"
"the  scope  of  VAT  within  a  Member  State    provides  that  the  supply  of  goods  or"
"services effected for consideration and importation of goods by a taxable person"
"for  an  economic  activity  are  subject 
to  VAT.  The  ECJ.  held 
that 
the  mere"
"acquisition  and  holding  of  shares  and  sale  of  such  holdings  does  not,  by"
"itself constitute an economic activity and thus, was not a supply for consideration,"
"but  the  transactions  that  consist  of  obtaining  income  on  continuous  basis  from"
"activities that go beyond the simple acquisition and sale of shares, will constitute"
"a  supply  for  consideration  within  the  meaning  of  Article  2  (1)  of  the  Directive."
"Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the decision read:"
