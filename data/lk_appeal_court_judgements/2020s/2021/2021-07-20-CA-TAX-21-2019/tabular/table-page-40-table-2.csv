"Commissioner-General  of  Inland  Revenue  has,  in  terms  of  Section  34  (6)  of  the"
"VAT  Act, has directed  the  senior  assessor, Mr. R.D.M.  S.  Muhandiram    to  make"

"make a further inquiry into the appeal, has signed and acknowledged the receipt"
"of the appeals made by the Appellant under Section 34 (8) of the VAT Act."
"[122]  The  definition  of  “Commissioner-General”  in  section  83    of  the  VAT  Act"
"means  “the  Commissioner-General  of  the  Inland  Revenue  appointed  under  the"

specifically 
authorised

"Senior Assessor appointed under the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000. By the"

"the words “Assessor or Assistant Commissioner”."
"[123] It is patently clear that the senior assessor who is appointed under the Inland"
"Revenue  Act,  has  performed  an  administrative  function  conferred  by  Section  34"
"(8)  of 
the  Act  and  signed 
the  acknowledgement 
letter,  acting  under 
the"
"authorisation  of  his  Superior  Officers  rather  than  performing  any  discretionary"
"power in terms of the provisions of the VAT Act.  In the result, the absence of any"
"reference
