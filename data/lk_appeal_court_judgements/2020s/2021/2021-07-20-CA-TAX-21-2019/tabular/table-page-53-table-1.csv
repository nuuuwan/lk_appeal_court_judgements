"Section  25C(5)  (gg)  has  no  application  to  the  Appellant  and  thus,  the  income"
"received  by  the  Appellant  from  sale  of  shares  shall  be  considered  as  supply  of"
"financial  services  within  the  meaning  of  Section  25F  of  the  VAT  Act.  For  those"
"reasons,  I  hold  that  the  Appellantâ€™s  income  arising  from  the  sale  of  shares  is"
"liable  to  VAT  on  financial  services  as  correctly  decided  by  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission."
