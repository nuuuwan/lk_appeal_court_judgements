"therefore,  a  Minister  is  not  obliged  to  bring  his  own  mind  to  bear  upon  a"
"matter entrusted  to him  by  statutes,  but  may  act  through a  duly authorized"
"officer of his department”."
"[31] It is to be noted that the Carltona principle does not confine to Ministers"
"and  it  has  been  judicially  recognised  in  Commissioners  of  Customs  and"
"Excise  v.  Cure  &  Deeley  Ltd. (1962)  1  QB  340  at  p 371  
that 
the"
"Commissioners of Customs and Excise were in a position parallel to that of"
"Ministers:"
"“The  Commissioners  are 
in  a  position  parallel 
to 
that  of 
the  Ministers"
"referred to in the judgment of Lord Greene in the Carltona case [1943] 2 All"
"ER  560 at 563, in  that  their  functions  are  so  multifarious  that  they  could"
"never  personally  attend  to  them  all,  and  the  powers  given  to  them  are"
"normally  exercised  under 
their  authority  by  responsible  officials  of 
the"
"department.[45]”."
"[32] 
In  Re  University  of  Sydney [1963]  S.R.  N.S.W.  723,  at  p 733, the"
"Senate  of  a  University  was  regarded  as  being  in  a  similar  situation.The"
"Carltona  principle  may, 
in  my  view  apply 
in  appropriate  circumstances"
"where  the  Government  officials  or  bodies  are  authorised  by  their  superior"
"officers to carry out certain administrative or routine tasks without having a"
"formal delegation to do so. Because, it is almost impossible for the head of"
"a  department  in  the  Public  Service  to  discharge  personally  all  the  duties"
"which are conferred by a Statute otherwise than his officers responsible to"
"him unless it is stated in the Act in unequivocal language that such duties"
"shall be exercised by the head of the department personally. As Mason, J."
"referring to the Carltona principle observed in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs"
"v. Peko-Wallsend (1986) 162 CLR 24 at paragraph 12:"
"“The cases in which the principle has been applied are cases in which the"
"nature, scope and purpose of the function vested in the repository made it"
"unlikely 
that  Parliament 
intended 
that 
it  was 
to  be  exercised  by 
the"
"repository personally because administrative necessity indicated that it was"
"impractical  for  him  to  act  otherwise  than  through  his  officers  or  officers"
"responsible to him”."
"[33]  In  Re  Golden  Chemical  Products  Ltd. (1976)  Ch.  300  at  p.  20,  it  was"
"observed:"
"“Yet  I  find  the  logic of  the  principle  equally  persuasive  in  its  application  to"
"the  head  of any  large government  department,  and,  a  fortiori,  to  a  Deputy"
"Commissioner of Taxation responsible within a State for the implementation"
"of the Commonwealth's laws with respect to taxation.  No permanent head"
"of  a  department  in  the  Public  Service  is  expected  to  discharge  personally"
"all 
the  duties  which  are  performed 
in  his  name  and 
for  which  he 
is"
"accountable to the responsible Minister”."
