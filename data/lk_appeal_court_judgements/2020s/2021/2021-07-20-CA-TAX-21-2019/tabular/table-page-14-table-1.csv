"[40]  Having  said 
that,  Balcombe,  J.  stated  on 
the 
first  argument 
that 
it  was"
"permissible  for  the  Commissioners  to  make  a  single  assessment  which  covers"
"more than one accounting period to the best of their judgment, within the meaning"
"of  para.  4  (1)  of  Sch.  7  to  the  Value  Added  Act  1983,  in  one  total  amount  even"
"where  they  had  necessary  information  to  make  separate  assessments.  On  the"
"second  argument,  Balcombe,  J.  stated  that  the  schedules  sent  to  the  taxpayer"
"with  details  shown  on  enclosed  schedules,  indicated  how  the  sums  assessed"
"were made up so that the taxpayer was properly notified as required by para. 4 (1)"
"of Sch. 7 to the 1983 Act."
"[41] Although whatever possible, the VAT should, for good practice be allocated to"
"individual  periods  and  a  single  assessment  should  be  issued  covering  one  or"
"multiple  taxable  periods  by  calculating  the  amount  of  tax  due  for  each  taxable"
"period  separately, 
there  will  be  situations  where 
the  making  of  a  single"
"assessment covering  a single taxable period or multiple taxable periods  will lead"
"to  impossible  and  impracticable  results.  If  a  blanket  proposition  is made  that  the"
"amount due for any taxable period can only be calculated  accurately in regard to"
"each  taxable  period,  so  that  the  assessment  must  relate  to  each  taxable  period"
"separately,  the  scheme  of  assessment  set  out  in  the  VAT  Act  may  produce  an"
"unworkable and unreasonable result."
"[42] I do not think that it would be necessary to produce a separate piece of paper"
"showing  a  separate  and  distinct  assessment  for  each  taxable  period  where  the"
"assessor cannot split up and determine the income for each taxable period due to"
"failure of the taxpayer to disclose all the material facts necessary to determine the"
"amount of tax for each taxable period."
"[43]  The  assessor  is  entitled  in  case  where  it  is  impossible  and  impracticable  to"
"determine  and 
split 
the  assessment  up 
into 
several 
taxable  periods  and"
"calculating  the  amount  due  on  each  period  separately,  to  issue  one  notice  of"
"assessment  aggregating  several  taxable  periods,  (be  it  1,  6  or  12  months)  and"
"calculate one total amount of tax due for that particular single taxable period."
"[44] I shall now proceed to consider whether the assessor was justified in issuing"
"a  single  assessment  covering  several  monthly  taxable  periods,  what  is generally"
"known as a ‘global assessment’ covering nine taxable periods from 01.04.2010 to"
"31.12.2010  and  another  global  assessment  covering  three  taxable  periods  from"
"01.01.2011  to  31.03.2011  and  calculating  the  total  amount  due  for  that  whole"
"period  without  making  separate  assessments  for  each  of 
the 
taxable  periods"
"referred to in the notice."
"[45] A perusal of the record reveals that the only material available to the assessor"
"to  make  assessment  was  the  VAT  Returns  submitted  on  the  basis  of  estimated"
"amounts  and  the  annual  adjustment  submitted  by  the  Appellant  on  28.06.2013,"
