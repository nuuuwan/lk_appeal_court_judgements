"to reflect the actual amounts with the audited statement of accounts on"
"yearly basis and such adjustment shall be submitted within six months after"
"the closing date of the relevant accounting period”."
"[71] The provisio makes it clear that where the amount of profits for each taxable"
"period  cannot  be  accurately  ascertained,  such  amount  may  be  estimated  on  the"
"basis of available information, but such estimated amounts  shall be adjusted to"
"reflect the actual amounts with the audited statement of accounts on yearly basis."
"This Section clearly provides for a simplified year end calculation by adjusting the"
"estimated  amounts  with  the  audited  statement  of  accounts,  and  it  is  only  at  the"
"year end, as a result of the calculation carried out then, that the  relevant value is"
"""determined”."
"[72]  Thus, 
it  provides 
for  a  simplified  year  end  calculation  by  adjusting 
the"
"estimated amounts in the returns and as a result of the calculation carried out, the"
"actual value, including deductions is determined on the basis of such adjustment."
"Until that is done, in the coming financial year, the provisional value is ascertained"
"in  accordance  with  the  available  information.  The  amount  of  VAT  paid  on  the"
"provisional  value  of 
those  supplies,  shall  be  adjusted  by 
the  specified"
"institution on the VAT return for each taxable period ending after the end of the"
"financial year during which the supplies were made."
"[73] As the year end calculation will indicate the transactions and the  ""amount of"
"VAT due”, and the difference between the ""amount of VAT paid”, such difference"
"has to be adjusted  on a ""return”. This means that if a further payment or loss is"
"made, it will have to be entered and adjusted to reflect the actual amounts with the"
"audited statement of accounts on yearly basis. It follows from Section 25C (1), that"
"the initial estimated amount must be adjusted where it is higher or lower than that"
"to  which  the  taxable  person  was  entitled.  An  adjustment  must,  in  particular,  be"
"made where after the estimated VAT Returns are made,  some change occurs in"
"the  factors  used  to  determine  the  amount  to  be  deducted.  For  example,    where"
"purchases  are  cancelled  or  price  reductions  are  obtained,  such  deductions  shall"
"be  adjuted  on  the  estimated  amounts  in  the  VAT  Returns  to  reflect  the  actual"
"amounts  with 
the  audited  statement  of  accounts  on  yearly  basis. 
  This 
is"
"paramount  because 
the 
tax  period  can  be  affected  by 
factors  such  as 
the"
"seasonal  variations  either  in  the  value  of  the  supplies,  the  taxpayer  makes  or  in"
"the amount of input tax the taxpayer incurs."
"[74] I must add that the statutory scheme of the VAT Act in section 25C (1) does"
"not  make  provisions 
to  waive 
the 
requirement  of  annual  adjustment  merely"
"because of the claim of a taxpayer that the transactions remain totally  or partially"
"unpaid or emempt or zero rated.  The statutory requirement of annual adjustment"
