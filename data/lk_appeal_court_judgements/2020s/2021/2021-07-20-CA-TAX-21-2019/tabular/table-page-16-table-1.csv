"[49]  The  assessor  has  obtained  the  details  for  the  assessment  from  the  annual"
"adjustment, which does not include accurate figures at all to ascertain the actual"
"amounts of the VAT due on financial services for each taxable period separately"
"from  01.04.2010  to  31.12.2010  or  from  01.01.2011  to  31.03.2011.  There  is  no"
"comparison  or  adjustment  to  the  amount  set  out  in  the  estimated  monthly  VAT"
"Returns  and  thus,  it  was  impossible  and  impractical  for  the  assessor  to  spilt  up"
"and determine the amount of tax due on each nine taxable period from 01.04.2010"
"to 31.12.2010 and 01.01.2011 to 31.03.2011 separately."
"[50]  The  next  question  is  whether  the  Appellant  had  sufficient  notice  of  the  two"
"assessments made by the assessor for the periods included in the two notices of"
"assessments.  A  perusal of  the  two  forms  of notices  of assessments  reveals that"
"each is an independent, freestanding notice of assessment that covers the periods"
"from 01.04.2010 to 31.12.2010 and from 01.01.2011 to 31.03.2011. None of them"
"refers  to  either  of  the  others.  Each  of  them  contains  figures  which  apply  to  the"
"whole  stated  periods 
(i.e. 
first  nine  months  and 
the  next 
three  months"
"separately)  and  none of  them  is a  continuation  sheet.  None  of them  contains  an"
"amount carried forward to or brought forward from the other one and thus, there is"
"nothing  to  connect  them  with  each  other  except  for  the  fact  that  they  cover  one"
"financial year from 01.04.2010 to 31.03.2011and the figures have been taken on"
"the basis of the annual adjustment submitted by the Appellant."
"[51] The assessor has stated in the intimation letter submitted to the Appellant on"
"21.03.2014  along  with  the  two  separate  notices  of  assessment  that  the  returns"
"have not been accepted for the reasons set out therein. He has further stated that"
"the proportionate rate for total turnover, emolument payable was taken as per the"
"annual adjustment,  which  together with  the  turnover analysis schedule  has  been"
"prepared  by 
the  Appellant  himself  by  segregating 
the  value  addition 
for 
two"
"different periods, for the first 9 months and the next 3 months."
"[52]  The  assessor  has  calculated  the  net  profit  break  up  for  the  1-9  months  and"
"the last 3 months separately on the basis of the amounts contained in the annual"
"adjustment  and  the  audited  statement  of  accounts  (Vide-  page  96),  emoluments"
"payable for the  purpose  of  Section 25C(1) (Vide-  p.  96) and  annual depreciation"
"(p.  96).  According 
to 
the  notice  of  assessment 
for 
the 
taxable  periods 
from"
"01.04.2010 to 31.12.2010, VAT assessed for the said periods is Rs, 349,258,339"
"and the balance payable is nil (Vide- p. 98). According to the notice of assessment"
"for the taxable periods from 01.01.2011 to 31.03.2011, VAT on financial services"
"was Rs. 86,769,980 and after deducting the tax paid and adding the penalty, the"
"total VAT payable is Rs. 76,521,407 (Vide- p. 99)."
"[53]  Notices  of  assessments  have  been  accompanied  by 
the 
intimation 
letter"
"dated  21.03.2014  addreessed 
to 
the  Appellant.  There 
is  no  dispute 
that 
the"
"Appellant has received both notices of assessments and the said intimation letter."
