"another with authority by empowering such other person to act or do things which"
"otherwise,  he  himself  would  have 
to  do. 
In  Sidhartha  Sarawagi  v.  Board  of"
"Trustees  for  the  Port  of  Kolkata  and  others  [(2014)  16  SCC  248],  the  Indian"
"Supreme Court, while dealing with the issue of delegation of authority, observed:"
"“2-Delegation  is  the  act  of  making  or  commissioning  a  delegate.  It  generally"
"means  of  powers by  the person who grants  the delegation and  conferring of"
"an  authority 
to  do 
things  which  otherwise 
that  person  would  have 
to  do"
"himself. Delegation is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary as the act of entrusting"
"another  with  authority  by  empowering  another 
to  act  as  an  agent  or"
"representative. …Delegation generally means parting of powers by the person"
"who grants the delegation, but it also means conferring of an authority to do"
"things which otherwise that person would have to do himself.”"
"[114]  Mathew  J.  in  Gwalior  Rayon  Silk  Manufacturing  (Wvg.)  Co.  Ltd.  v.  The"
"Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax and others, 1974 AIR 1660, has succinctly"
"discussed the concept of delegation at paragraph 37:"
"“37-Delegation  may  be  defined  as  the  entrusting,  by  a  person  to  another"
"person or body of persons, of the exercise of a power residing in that person"
"or  body  of  persons,  to  another  person  or  body  of  persons,  with  complete"
"power  of  revocation  or  amendment  remaining  in  the  grantor  or  delegator."
"………It  is important  to  grasp the  implications  of  this,  for, much  confusion  of"
"thought has unfortunately resulted from assuming that delegation involves or"
"may 
involve, 
the  complete  abdication  or  abrogation  of  a  power.  This 
is"
"precluded  by 
the  definition.  Delegation  often 
involves  the  granting  of"
"discretionary 
authority 
to 
another, 
but 
such 
authority 
is 
purely"
"derivative. The ultimate power always remains in the delegator and is never"
"renounced” [Emphasis added]."
"[115] A Statute will generally provide the answer as to whether a power must be"
"performed  personally  by  those  to  whom  they  have  been  given  or  whether  such"
"power can be delegated to another. As noted, there is no express provision in the"
"VAT Act that authorises the Commissioner-General to sign the acknowledgement"
"of 
the  appeal  personally  or  delegate  his  power 
to  another  officer  of 
the"
"department  authorising  him  to  sign  the  acknowledgement.  In  this  context,  the"
"question of delegation will not arise, unless the Commissioner-General has been"
"authorised by express words to sign the letter of acknowledgement himself.  It is"
"to  be  noted 
that 
the  nature  of 
the  duty 
to  be  exercised  here 
is  merely 
to"
"acknowledge 
the  appeal  and 
the  character  of 
the  person 
involved 
is 
the"
"Commissioner-General who is the head of the Department."

In  view  of 
the  submission  made  by  Mr.  Goonewardena, 
I  shall  now"
"consider  the  question  whether  a  delegation  of  power  can  be  implied  from  the"
"scheme and objects of the VAT Act. In Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd, v."
"The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), this Court considered the"
"question  whether    a  delegation  of  power  can  be  implied  from  the  scheme  and"
