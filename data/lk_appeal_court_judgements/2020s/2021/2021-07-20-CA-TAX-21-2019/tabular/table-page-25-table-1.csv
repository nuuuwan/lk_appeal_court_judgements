"[79]  The 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel  submitted 
that  without 
the  annual"
"adjustment,  no  assessment  is  possible  and  the  non-submission  of  the  annual"
"adjustment  automatically  entailed 
the 
logical  consequence  of 
the  assessment"
"being delayed. The statutory limitation period for the month of April 2010 ended on"
"30.04.2013, the limitation period for the month of May 2010 ended on 31.05.2013"
"and  the  limitation  period  for  the  month  of  June  ended  on  30.06.2013.  Like  wise,"
"the limitation periods from July 2010 to March 2011 ended after the expiration of"
"three years from the end of the remaining taxable periods."
"[80] The annual adjustment with attached documents in support thereof necessary"
"to make the assessments for the taxable periods April 2010 and May 2010 were"
"made available by the Appellant  to the assessor only on 28.06.2013. The annual"
"adjustment  necessary  to  make  the  assessment  for  the  taxable  period  of  June"
"2010 was made available to the assessor only on 28.06.2013, just 2 days before"
"the  end  of  the  limitation  period.  For  the  taxable  period  of  July,  the  assessor had"
"only one month and two days, for August, the asssessor had two months and two"
"days."
"[81]  Unless 
the  annual  adjustment 
is  submitted 
to 
the  assessor 
in 
time  with"
"supportive  documents,  the  assessor  cannot  determine  the  amount  of  proficts  for"
"each taxable period accurately with the estimated returns, which only relate to the"
"zero  rated  attributable  method  whereas  the  Appellant  as  a  specified  institution"
"must  declare  VAT  on  the  supply  of  financial  services,  which  is  incomplete  and"
"incorrect.  In  my  view,  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  fulfil    its  statutory  obligation"
"imposed by the VAT Act and defaulted in submitting the annual adjustment in time"
"with the necessary documents.  The natural consequence of such default was that"
"the assessment was delayed as the Appellant  had not disclosed all the material"
"facts together with the annual adjustment in time, to enable the assessor to make"
"proper assessment in his best judgment."
"[82] Mr. Goonewardena complains about the failure of the assessor to give notice"
"under Section 21(8) requesting the Appellant to submit the information relevant for"
"the  assessment.  In  my  view,  the  annual  adjustment  is  a  document  that  shall  be"
"prepared by the Appellant according to the method of calculation and adjustment"
"laid down in Section 25C (1). The assessor is not required to do the  work of the"
"taxpayer and the statutory obligation imposed on him under the provisions of the"
"VAT  Act.  Any  failure  on  the  part  of  the  assessor  to  give  notice  in  writing  to  the"
"Appellant under Section 21 (4) and require him to furnish the annual adjustment in"
"time  will  not  absolve  the  Appellant  being  a  specified  institution  from  fulfilling  its"
"statutory  obligation  of  submitting 
its  annual  adjustment  with 
the  supportive"
"documents in time as required by Section 25C (1) of the VAT Act."
"[83]  As  regards  the  Question  of  Law  No.  5,  Mr.  Goonewardene  sought  to  argue"
"that  though  the  assessment  for  the  periods  from  01.01.2011  to  31.03.2011  has"
