"bar  period  ended.  The  Appellant,  in  response  to  a  written  request  made  by  the"
"Respondent,  has  submitted  the  following  documents  to  the  Respondent  for  the"
"settlement of the appeal:"
"1.  Activity  wise  breakups 
for  (a)  bad  debt  recovered;  (b)  other  gain  and"
"charges;  (c)  bad  debt  recovered;  (d)  bad  debt  write  offs;  (e)  disposal"
"losses; and bad debts provisions; and"
"2.  Activity  wise  breakups  for  VAT  declared  representing  liable  and  exempt"
"activities."
"[99]  It  is  absolutely  clear  that  the  material  documents  including  the  activitiy  wise"
"breakups 
for  VAT  declared,  representing 
liable  and  exempt  activities 
for 
the"
"determination  of  the  VAT  liability  were  in  the  custody  of  the  Appellant  but  they"
"were not disclosed to the assessor trully and fully in time to enable the assessor to"
"determine the amount of tax payable by the Appellant with the annual adjustment."
"It is clear from the record that the assessor had no evidence of facts sufficient to"
"make  an  early  assessment  as  all  the    necessary  information  with  all  relevant"
"documents  had  not  been  disclosed 
to 
the  assessor 
in 
time 
to  make 
the"
"assessment  in  time.  What  is  the  explanation  for  the  delay?  No  explanation  was"
"offered."
"[100]  Can 
the  Appellant  now  complain 
that  he  provided  all 
the 
information"
"including  the annual adjustment in time in compliance with his statutory obligation"
"imposed by Section 25C (1) of the VAT Act, but the assessor having had all such"
"information  delayed  in  making  the  assessment,  which  is  wholly  unreasonable  or"
"perverse?    In  my  view,  the  Appellant  has  wilfully  (deliberately  and  purposely"
"without reference to bona fides) failed to make a full and true disclosures of all the"
"material  facts  necessary  to  determine  the  amount  of  tax  payable  by  it  for  the"
"relevant periods from 01.04.2010 to 31.03.2011."
"[101]  In  my  view,  the  taxpayer  cannot  invoke  the  time  bar  objection  against  his"
"own  wilful,  deliberate  and  negligent  act  of  failing  to  submit  all  the  material  facts,"
"including  the  statutory  annual  adjustment  in  time,  necessary  to  determine  the"
"amount  of  tax  payable  by  him  for  the  taxable  periods  in  question,  in  compliance"
"with  his  statutory  obligation  imposed  by  the  VAT  Act.  In  the  result,  the  assessor"
"was justified in invoking Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act in making one assessment"
"for 
the  periods 
from  01.04.2010 
to  31.12.2010  and  one  assessment 
from"
"01.01.2011  to  31.03.2011.  Accordingly,  the  assessments  made  in  respect  of  the"
"said  two  periods  fall  within  the  meaning  of  Section  33  (2)  of  the  VAT  Act.  For"
"those reasons, I hold that the assessments dated 27.03.2014 are not time barred."
