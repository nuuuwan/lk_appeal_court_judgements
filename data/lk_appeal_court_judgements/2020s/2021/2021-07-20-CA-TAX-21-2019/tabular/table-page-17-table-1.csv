"In  the  circumstances,  the  Appellant  had  sufficient  notice  of  the  effect  of  the  two"
"notices  of  assessments. 
In  my  view, 
the  Appellant  has  been 
informed 
in"
"reasonably clear terms of the effect of the assessments for the periods from 9 and"
"3  months, 
respectively 
together  with 
the 
intimation 
letter  which  shows  with"
"complete clarity, how that sums were made up and how much the amount due on"
"VAT was calculated under two different periods."
"[54]  Can 
the  Appellant  be  prejudiced?  No  prejudice  will  be  suffered  by 
the"
"Appellant when the assessor makes a single global assessment for a period which"
"aggregates  a  number  of 
taxable  periods  based  on 
the  annual  adjustment"
"submitted by the Appellant and where it is impossible for the assessor to make an"
"assessment for each taxable period separately."
"[55]  Under  such  circumstances,  I  hold  that  subject  to  the  limitation  period,  the"
"assessor  was  justified,  to  the  best  of  his  judgment,  in  issuing  one  assessment"
"comprising  nine  taxable  periods  from  01.04.2010  to  31.12.2010  and  the  second"
"assessment,  comprising  three  taxable  periods  from  01.01.2011  to  31.03.2011,"
"without calculating the amount of tax due for each taxable period separately."
"Question of Law 3"
"H
as the Tax Appeals Commission erred in determining that the assessment"
"made  under  Charge  number  VATFS/BFSU/2014/579  was  valid 
in 
law"
"notwithstanding the said assessment which was issued on 27.03.2014 being"
"time barred in terms of Section 33 (1)(a) of the VAT Act?"
