"[31]  Having  dispelled  the  proposition  and  taken  the  view  that  such  a  restricted"
"meaning  is  impracticable  and  unworkable,  Lord  Denning  proceeded  to  set  down"
"the  test  to  be  applied  when  deviating  from  the  earlier  proposition  at  page  7  as"
"follows:"
"“So read, it means that, in all cases it is impossible for the commissioners to"
"spilt  the  assessment  up  into  three-monthly  periods,  they  can  assess  the"
"amount of tax for any period of time which they specify (be it six, 12, 15 or 21"
"months) and such assessment will be good. They must do it within one year"
"after  they  get  evidence  of  the  facts  sufficient  to  justify  the  nature  of  the"
"assessment: see s. 31 (2)(b).”"
"[32] Mr. Goonewardena’s argument that the assessor was required to identify and"
"determine  the  amount  of  tax  due  for  each  nine  taxable  periods  and  issue  the"
"assessment  separately,  as 
the  amount  due 
for  all  nine  months  cannot  be"
"determined on the proportionate basis in one single taxable period leads obviously"
"to  unworkable  and  unreasonable  results.  The  fallacy  of  this  argument  is  that"
"where it is impossible for the  assessor to spilt the assessment up into a monthly"
"period  in  the  absence  of  sufficient  information  provided  by  the  taxpayer,  yet,  the"
"assessor  will  be  obliged 
to  make  a  speculative  assessment  or  make 
further"
"inquiries over and over again for a long period of time. By this time, obviously, the"
"period of limitation would have expired."
"[33]  The  following  observations  of  Lord  Denning  in  S.J.  Grange  Ltd  v.  Customs"
"and  Excise  Commissioners  (supra),  at  page  9  clearly  provide  the  appropriate"
"answer to the argument and accordingly, that argument cannot be sustained:"
"“I may add that, if the trader’s argument were right, it would open the door to"
"avoidance  of  value  added  tax.    It  would  mean  that,  for  every  three  months,"
"the commissioners would have to make a speculative assessment to make a"
"guess as to what sales the trader made in those three months. He might then"
"evade it by saying: ‘I did not sell anything in that time, so you are wrong as"
"regards  that  accounting  period.  you  must  try  another’.  There  would  have  to"
"be further enquiries, and these would take so long that the period of limitation"
"would  have  expired.  Many  other  practical  difficulties  would  arise  in  making"
"assessments if they had to be made for every accounting period separately."
"In  my  opinion,  therefore,  a  notice  of  assessment  can  be  made  for  a  period"
"such  as  21  months.  This  notice  of  assessment  was  good.  The  preliminary"
"point fails....”"
"The  Concept  of  ‘Global  Assessment’  covering  several  Taxable  Periods  as"
"opposed to Separate Assessments"
"[34] The only other case to which I need to refer to this point is the decision of the"
"Court of Appeal in Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Le Rififi Ltd [1995] BVC"
"55  &  [1995]  STC  103.  The  case  concerned  an  assessment  in  prescribed  form"
"covering  a  number  of  periods,  including  a  period  which  was  out  of  time.  The"
