"Question of Law No. 2"
"Has 
the 
Tax 
Appeals 
Commission 
erred 
in 
determining 
that 
the"
"Assessments  made 
under 
Charge 
No. 
VATFS/BFSU/2014/580 
dated"
"27.03.2014 in terms of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 (as amended)"
"(‘VAT  ACT’)  was  valid  in  law  notwithstanding  the  said  Assessment  having"
"aggregated  value  added  tax  payable  for  the  3  taxable  periods  ending  31st"
"January 2011, 28th February 2011 and 31st March 2011?"
"[6]  The  Question  of  Law,  No.  1  relates  to  the  validity  of  the  assessment  under"
"Charge  No.  VATFS/BFSU/2014/579  dated  27.03.2014  by  aggregating  9  taxable"
"periods from April 01, 2010 to December 31, 2010 into a single taxable period in"
"violation of the provisions of the VAT Act. The Question of Law, No.  2 also relates"
"to  the  validity  of  the  assessment  under  Charge  No.  No.  VATFS/BFSU/2014/580"
"dated 27.03.2014 by aggregating 3 taxable periods from January 1, 2011 to March"
"31, 2011 into a single taxable period in violation of the provisions of the VAT Act."
"[7] At the hearing, Mr. F. N. Goonewardena submitted that the taxable period prior"
"to January 1, 2011 for the Appellant, in terms of Section 25B of the VAT Act was"
"one  month  and  that  the  Appellant  submitted  separate  VAT  returns  for  monthly"
"taxable periods from April 01, 2010 to December 31, 2010 under Section 21 of the"
"VAT Act. There is no dispute that the Appellant has submitted the VAT returns for"
"the  monthly 
taxable  periods 
from  April  01,  2010 
to  December  31,  2010  on"
"20.05.2010, 
17.06.2010, 
20.07.2010, 
20.08.2010, 
20.09.2010, 
20.10.2010,"
"18.11.2010, 17.12.2010 and 20.01.2010 respectively (X2-X10)."
"[8] He submitted that as Section 25B of the VAT Act specifically stipulates that for"
"the  period  prior  to  01.01.2011,  a  taxable  period  shall  be  considered  to  be  one"
"month,  for  the  periods  from  01.04.2010  to  31.12.2010,  there  were  nine  separate"
"taxable periods. His contention was that  while the last sentence of Section 33 (2)"
"specifically permits a single notice of assessment to refer to one or more separate"
"taxable  periods,  the  VAT  Act  does  not  make  provisions  for  the  aggregation  of"
"multiple 
taxable  periods 
into  a  single  amalgamated 
taxable  period  without"
"assessing  the  amount  of  tax  for  each  taxable  period  separately.  In  short,  his"
"contention was that no aggregation of taxable periods into one assessment can be"
"made without assessing the amount of tax due for each taxable period separately."
"[9]  The 
last  sentence  of  Section  33 
(2)  clearly  states 
that  any  notice  of"
"assessment may refer to one or more taxable periods. It reads as follows:"
