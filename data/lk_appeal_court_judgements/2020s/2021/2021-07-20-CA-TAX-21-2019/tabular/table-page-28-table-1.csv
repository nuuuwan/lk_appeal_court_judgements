"defined  under  the  VAT  Act.   In  Reg  v.  Senior  (1899)  1  QB  283,  Lord  Russell,"
"explains “wilfully'” to mean:"
"“that 
the  acts 
if  done  deliberately  and 
intentionally  not  by  accident  or"
"inadvertence, but so that the mind of the person who does the acts goes with"
"it."

In 
In  re  YOUNG  AND  HARS-TON'S  CONTRACT'  (1886)  31  Ch  D  168,"
"Bowen, L.J., explained the word ""wilful"" which has been accepted and applied in"
"subsequent cases, as follows:"
"“It  (i.e.,  the word  'wilful') generally,  as  used  In  Courts of  law,  implies  nothing"
"blamable,  but  merely 
that 
the  person  of  whose  action  or  default 
the"
"expression it used, is a free agent, and that what has been done arises from"
"the spontaneous action of his will. It amounts to nothing more than this, that"
"he  knows  what  he  is  doing  and  intends  to  do  what  he  is  doing,  and  is  free"
"agent”."

"Nag 34, the question was whether a railway company was guilty of willful neglect."
"The learned Judge said."
"“that the term willful neglect implies an intentional and purposeful omission to"
"do a certain act and, it is an even more extreme term than gross and culpable"
"negligence”."
"[92] In Re: T.N.K. Govindarajulu v. Unknown, 1951 1952 CriLJ 1063,  Subba Rao,"
"J. held at paragraph 10 in the context of tax evasion:"
"“In  my  view,  this  construction  which  leads  to  startling  results  should  not  be"
"accepted unless the words in the statute are clear and unambiguous. Not only"
"I do not see any such words but to my mind the word wilful used in the section"
"was  intended  only  to  hit  at  intentional  omissions  of  an  assessee  with  full"
"knowledge that the item omitted is a taxable one”."

In  Chellappah  v.  Commissioner  of 
Income  Tax  52  NLR  416  at  418,"
"Basnayake  J.  (as  he  was  then)  held  that  ordinarily,  the  word  “wilfully”  means"
"deliberately or purposely without reference to bona fides but that in penal statutes,"
"it is used in a sense denoting deliberatively or purposely and with an evil intention."
"In  HSBS  Electronic  Data  Processing  Lanka 
(Pvt)  Ltd  v.  The  Commissioner"
"General  of  Inland  Revenue    (supra),  Janak  Silva  J.  relying  on  the  interpretation"
"given by Basnayaka J. (as he was then) held that the VAT Act being a fiscal rather"
"than  a  penal  statute,  the  word  “wilfully”  in  section  33  (2)  means  deliberately  or"
"purposlely without reference to bona fides."
"[94]  Mr.  Goonewardena  however,  submited
