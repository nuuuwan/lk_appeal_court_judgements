"Appellant  has  wilfully  or  fraudulently  failed  to  disclose  fully  and  truly  all  material"
"facts  which  were  necessary 
for 
the  assessment  but  not  otherwise.  There 
is"
"nothing in section 33 (2) to indicate that the assessor shall indicate his opinion in"
"specific  language  and  in  specific  manner  in  writing.  The  formation  of  assessor’s"
"opinion  can  be  gathered  from  the  language  used  in  any  notice  or any  intimation"
"letter  sent  by  him 
to 
the 
taxpayer  supported  by 
the  contents  of 
the  record"
"maintained by the Respondent."
"[95] On the other hand, the annual adjustment shall be submitted to the assessor"
"with 
supporting  documents,  and  unless  all 
the  necessary  documents  are"
"submitted with the annual adjustment in time to enable the  assessor to make an"
"assessment within the limitation period, it would be impossible for the assessor to"
"assess  the  taxpayer  accurately.  In  the  present  case,  the  assessor  has  stated  in"
"the intimation letter that the annual adjustment contains incorrect figues such as (i)"
"the  net  profits 
for 
the  purpose  of  calculating  VAT  on 
the  supply  of 
financial"
"services  are  not  provided 
in 
the  annual  adjustment;  (ii) 
incorrect  emolument"
"payments have been taken into account in the annual adjustment;  and (iii) value"
"addition  to  financial  services  has  been  wrongly  computed  in  terms  of  Section"
"25C(5) on the supply of financial services."
"[96]  On  the  face  of  the  annual  adjustment,  the  figures  in  the  annual  adjustment"
"contains  incorrect  figures  and  the  figures  in  the  estimated  VAT  retuns  have  not"
"been adjusted to reflect the actual amounts with the audited statement of accounts"
"on  yearly  basis  referring  to  each  taxable  period  from  01.04.2010  to  31.03.2011."
"This has made it impposible for the assessor to spilt up the amount and determine"
"the amount of tax payable by the Appellant for each taxable period. As noted, this"
"has clearly resulted in the  assessor issuing global assessments covering several"
"taxable periods from 01.04.2010 to 31.12.2010 (9 months) and from 01.01.2011 to"
"31.03.2011 (3 months)."
"[97]  It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  Appellant  has  submitted  the  annual  adjustment"
"only on 28.06.2013 and thus, the Appellant has delayed in submitting the annual"
"adjustment together with the necessary documents. The natural consequence was"
"that the assessments were also delayed. A perusal of the record reveals that the"
"audited  statement  of  accounts  submitted  by  the  Appellant  marked  ‘B’  contains"
"notes  of  the  financial  statements  (p.  198)  with  the  turnover  analysis  marked  ‘A’"
"only for three months ended 31.03.2011 (p. 199)."
"[98]  Apart  from  the  VAT  returns  claiming  only  zero  rated  supplies,  notes  of  the"
"audited financial statement and a turnover for a period of only three months ended"
"31.03.2011  are  provided  with  the  adjustment,  no  other material  documents  were"
"made  available  by  the  Appellant  to  the  assessor  to  make  a  proper  assessment."
"This  position 
is 
further  confirmed  by 
the 
letter  of 
the  Appellant  sent 
to 
the"
"Respondent  on  17.09.2014,  after  the  appeal  was  lodged  and  the  statutory  time"
