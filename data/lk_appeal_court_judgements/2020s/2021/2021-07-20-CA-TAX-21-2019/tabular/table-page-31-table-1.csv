"Should the Tax Appeals Commission have determined that the appeal which"
"was made by the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue under section 34"
"(1) 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
assessments 
under 
charge 
numbers"
"VATFS/BFSU/2014/579  and  VATFS/BFSU/2014/580  be  deemed  to  have  been"
"allowed  in  terms  of  the  second  proviso  to  section  34  (8)  of  the  VAT  Act  in"
"view of it not having been determined by the Commissioner General within 2"
"year period specified therein?"
"[102] Mr. F.N.Goonewardena next submitted that the Appellant filed two separate"
"appeals  on  29.04.2014 
to 
the  Commissioner-General  of 
Inland  Revenue 
in"
"respect  of  both  notices  of  assessments  but  the  acknowledgement  of  the  appeal"
"was signed by the assessor without any authority of the Commissioner-General of"
"Inland  Revenue.  It  was  urged  by  Mr.  Goonewardena  that  the  legislative  intent"
"reflected  in  Section  34    of  the  VAT  Act  is  that  once  an  appeal  is  made  to  the"
"Commissioner-General,  every  action  in  relation  to  such  appeal shall  be  taken  by"
"the  Commissioner-General  himself  unless 
the  authorisation 
to  make 
such"
"acknowledgement  is  specifically  delegated  by  the  Commissioner-General  to  the"
"assessor."
"[103] His contention was that as the appeal was not properly acknowledged under"
"Section  34  of  the  VAT  Act,  it  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  received  by  the"
"Commissioner-General on 29.04.2014 in terms of the statutory time bar provided"
"in  Section  34  (8)  and  as 
the  appeal  was  determined  by 
the  Respondent  on"
"14.05.2006,  after  the  expiration  of  the  two  year  period,  the  determination  of  the"
"appeal was time barred under section 34 (8) of the VAT Act."
"[104]  On 
the  other  hand, 
the 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel  countered 
the"
"submission  of  Mr.  Goonewardene  and  submitted  that  as  the  two  appeals  had"
"been  made  on  29.04.2014  and  the  Appellant  has  not  disputed  the  fact  that  the"
"acknowledgement  was 
received  on  27.05.2014, 
the  appeals  had  been  duly"
"acknowledged  by 
the  Respondent  under  Section  34  (8)  of 
the  VAT  Act.  He"
"submitted that it is not envisaged in 34 (8)  of the VAT Act that the Commissioner-"
"General himself should sign the acknowledgement of the appeal and the validity of"
"the  acknowledgement 
is  not  conditional  upon 
the  same  being  signed  by 
the"
"Commissioner-General.  He  strongly relied  on  the  decision  of  this Court in  Lanka"
"Ashok  Leyland  PLC  v.  The  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue,  CA  Tax  14/2017,"
"decided  on  14.12.2018  in  support  of  his  contention  that  the  Inland  Revenue  Act"
"does  not  indicate  expressly  that  the    Commissioner-General  himself  should  sign"
"the acknowledgement of the appeal."
"[105] 
In  view  of 
the  rival  submissions  made  by 
the  parties  pertaining 
to 
the"
"acknowledgement of the appeal made to the Commissioner-General, the following"
"issues arise for consideration under this question of law:"
