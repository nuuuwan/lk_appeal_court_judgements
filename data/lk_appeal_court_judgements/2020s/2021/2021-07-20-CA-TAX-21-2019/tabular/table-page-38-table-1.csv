"present  case,  no  doubt  there  have  been  thousands  of  requisitions  in  this"
"country  by  individual  ministries.  It  cannot  be  supposed  that  this  regulation"
"meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the"
"matter.  The  duties  imposed  upon  ministers  and  the  powers  given  to"
"ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by"
"responsible  officials  of  the  department.  Public  business  could  not  be"
"carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such"
"an  official 
is,  of  course, 
the  decision  of 
the  minister.  The  minister 
is"
"responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his"
"officials  have  done  under  his  authority,  and,  if  for  an  important  matter,  he"
"selected  an  official  of  such  junior  standing  that  he  could  not  be  expected"
"competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that"
"in  Parliament.  The  whole 
system 
of 
departmental 
organisation 
and"
"administration 
is  based  on 
the  view 
that  ministers,  being  responsible 
to"
"Parliament,  will  see 
that 
important  duties  are  committed 
to  experienced"
"officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must"
"be made against them"".[Emphasis added]."

"Ltd. (1976) Ch. 300CLR 24 and stated in paragraphs 28, 29, 31, 32,33 and 34 as"
"follows:"
"“[28] The Carltona doctrine applies where a statute has conferred a power"
"on  a  Minister,  and  it  is  practically  impossible  for  the  Minister  to  exercise"
"such  power  personally,  he  may,  in  general,  act  through  a  duly  authorised"
"officer  of  his  department  without  having  a  formal  delegation  to  do  so.  It"
"recognises the principle that the functions of a Minister are so multifarious"
"that the business of government could not be carried on if he was required"
"to  exercise  all  his  powers  personally.  Thus,  the  official  is  treated  as  the"
"minister’s alter ego, and to that extent, his decision is regarded as those of"
"the Minister”."
"“[29]  The  same  principle  was  applied  in  Kuruppu  v.  Keerthi  Rajapaksha,"
"Conservator of Forests (supra). The question arose inter alia, as to whether"
"it  was  competent  for  the  Conservator  of  Forests  to  specify  the  area  within"
