in 
its  written  submissions 
filed  before 
the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  at  page  178,  paragraph  4.6.2  has 
further  admitted 
that 
the"
"Appellant company is a registered finance company. It reads:"
"“4.6.2.  The  Hon.  Tax  Appeals  Commission  may  appreciate  the  fact  that"
"the company being the registered finance company is not engaged in"
"the  business  of  issue  of  shares,  allotment  and  transfer  of  ownership  of"
"any securities”."
"[142]  The  Appellant  never  challenged  the  determination  of  the  assessor  or  the"
"Commissioner-General before the Tax Appeals Commission on the basis that the"
"Appellant  was  not  a  finance  company  registered  with  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri"
"Lanka under the Finance Companies Act, No. 78 of 1988 and thus, the Appellant"
"could not be categorised as a specified institution under Section 25F of the VAT"
"Act.  There  was  no  issue  before  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  to  the  effect  that"
"the Appellant was not a finance company registered with the Central Bank of Sri"
"Lanka  and 
thus, 
it  was  outside 
the  definition  of  a  “specified 
institution”.  Mr."
"Goonewardena  however,  submitted  for  the  first  time,  during  the  course  of  the"
"argument  that  the  Appellant  was  not  a  finance  company  registered  with  the"
"Central  Bank  at 
the 
relevant 
time.  Can 
the  Appellant,  after  having  clearly"
"admitted  before  the  Commissioner-General  and  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"that  it  was  a  finance  company  registered  with  the  Central  Bank  at  the  relevant"
"time, now deny such admitted fact.?"
"[143] It is an elementary rule that a party litigant cannot be permitted to assume"
"inconsistent  positions  in  Court,  to  play  fast  and  loose,  to  blow  hot  and  cold,  to"
"approbate  and  reprobate  to  the  detriment  of  his  opponent-quod  approbo  non"
"reprobo (Lissenden v. C. A. V. Bosch Limited, HL (1940) 412 & 417-419, Banque"
"des  Marchands  de  Moscou  v.  Kindersley 
(1951)  Ch,  112). 
I  hold 
that 
the"
"Appellant has admitted that it was a finance company registered with the Central"
"Bank and therefore, the Appellant cannot now take up any inconsistent positions,"
"blow hot and cold, approbate and reprobate and contend  now, that it was not a"
"finance 
company 
registered  with 
the  Central  Bank. 
  The  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission was fully justified in proceeding, upon the Appellant’s own admission"
"that  the Appellant  was  a finance  company  registered  with  the  Central Bank  and"
"thus, could be categorised as a “specified institution”."
