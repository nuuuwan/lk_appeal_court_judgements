"VAT paid on the provisional value of those supplies” (my emphasis). It is not"
"the amount of VAT correctly calculated on that provisional value. The wording"
"is clear. It also coincides with common sense”."
"[67] What  is necessary  is that  the  amounts of  tax  calculated  in  the  returns  to  be"
"adjusted to reflect the actual amounts with the audited statement of accounts and"
"sums paid,  if  any,   be  deducted  from  the  year  end  figure  or  any  amount  not"
"entered  in  the  Returns  to  be  adjusted  to  reflect  such  actual  amounts  with  the"
"audited  statement of  accounts.  Unless the  true figures  are  entered  in  the  annual"
"adjustment  with  supporting  documents,  there  is  no  way  of  ascertaining  whether"
"the  estimated  amounts  are  accurately  adjusted  by  the    specified  institution  to"
"reflect the actual amounts with the audited statement."
"[68] In the first place, it should be examined whether an annual adjustment of the"
"deduction  of  VAT  is  a  statutory  requirement  and  a  condition  precedent  to  the"
"assessment  as  set  out  in  Section  25C  (1).  It  is  to  be  noted  that  Section  25C  (1)"
"applies  only 
to  any  specified 
institution  and 
thus, 
the  calculation  of  VAT  on"
"financial  services  shall  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  statutory  provisions    set"
"out in Section 25C (1) of the VAT Act. The concept of annual adjustment was not,"
"however,  found  in  the  original  VAT  Act,  No.  14  of  2002  and  it  was  brought  into"
"effect by the VAT (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 2003. This reflects the purpose and"
"context  in  which  Section  25C  (1)  was  introduced  by  Parliament  to  regulate  the"
"adjustment  mechanism  provided  for  in  Section  25C  (1)  of  the  VAT  Act  as  an"
"integral  part  of  the  VAT  calculation  and  deduction  mechanism  in  relation  to  a"
"registered specified institution."
"[69]  Section  25C  (1)  of 
the  VAT  Act  refers 
to 
the  annual  adjustment 
to  be"
"submitted by any specified institution and provides that the total value addition of"
"such  an  institution  which  includes  the  net  profits  or  loss  which  is  computed  in"
"accordance  with  accepted  accounting  standards 
is  subject 
to 
the  annual"
"adjustment,  for  economic  depreciation  and  the  emoluments  payable  to  all"
"the employees of such institution. The matters that shall be taken into accounts"
"and  included  in  the  emoluments paid to employees  and  documents  that  shall  be"
"maintained  and 
taken 
into  account 
in  computing 
the  value  addition  and 
the"
"percentage are also included in Section 25C (1) of the Act."
