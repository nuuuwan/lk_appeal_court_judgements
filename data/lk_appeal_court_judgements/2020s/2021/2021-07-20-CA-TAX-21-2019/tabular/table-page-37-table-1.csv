"objects of  the  Inland Revenue  Act,  which  has  identical provision  to  the  VAT Act,"
"and the character of the power to be delegated and the circumstances, when the"
"power is able to be exercised. In Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd, v. The"
"Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), at paragraph 24, I stated:"
"“[24]  As  there  may  be  thousands  of  taxpayers  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  head  of  the"
"Department of Income tax cannot be expected to discharge personally all the"
"duties of administrative nature which can be performed by the officials of the"
"Department in the exercise of statutory powers referred to in section 165 (6). I"
"do  not 
think 
that 
the  acknowledgement  signed  by 
the  officials  of 
the"
"Department acting under authorisation of their superior officers in the exercise"
"of the statutory duty conferred by section 165 (6) is invalid where no express"
"or 
implied  delegation  of  authority  authorising 
the  officials 
to  sign 
the"
"acknowledgement is reflected in the scheme of the Inland Revenue Act.  I do"
"not think that the Parliament intended such a result”."
"[117] Mr. Goonewardena drew our attention to a case reported in Carltona Ltd. v."
"Commissioners  of  Works,  (1943)  2  All  E  R  560  and  while  seeking  to  distinguish"
"the principle established in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (supra)  from"
"the  facts  of  the  present  case,  referred  to  the  following  statement  made  by  Lord"
"Green, M.R. in the said case:"
"“The  duties  imposed  upon  ministers  and  the  powers  given  to  ministers  are"
"normally  exercised  under 
the  authority  of 
the  ministers  by 
responsible"
"officials...Constitutionally, 
the  decision  of  such  officials 
is,  of  course, 
the"
"decision of the Minister”."
"[118]  Mr.  Goonewardena’s  submission  was  that  the  official  in  Carltona  Ltd.  v."
"Commissioner of Works (supra)  signed “for and on behalf of the Commissioner of"
"Works”  and 
therefore, 
the  actions  of 
the  official  are 
the  actions  of 
the"
"Commissioner  of  Works  himself.  He  submitted,  however,  that  assessor    could"
"have  only  signed  ‘for  and  on  behalf  of  the  Commissioner-General’-“Qui  facit  per"
"alium  facit  per  se” which  means    “He  who  acts  through  another  does  the  act"
"himself”. He contended that unlike in the case of Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of"
"Works  (supra),    the  assessor  in  the  present  case  had  signed  on  his  own  behalf"
"when  exercising  the  authority  of  the  Commissioner-General  of  Inland  Revenue"
"and consequently, for the acknowledgement of the appeal to have been valid, the"
"assessor should have signed it “for and on behalf of the Commissioner-General of"
"Inland Revenue”."
