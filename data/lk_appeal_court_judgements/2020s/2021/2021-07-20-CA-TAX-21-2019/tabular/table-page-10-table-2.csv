"[30]  It  is  apt  to  refer  to  the  following  observations  made  by  Lord  Denning  in  the",""
"above-mentioned case at page 7:",""
"“Stopping 
there","is  nothing 
to  prevent 
the  Commissioners  making  an"
"","assessment  for  any  period,  whether  it  be  three  months,  12  months  or"
"","longer.  But  the  trader  says  that  an  assessment  can  only  be  made  for  a"
"","prescribed accounting period, and that is three months. In support, he relies"
"on s. 31 (2), which says:",""
"","“An  assessment  under  subsection  (1)  of  this  section  of  an  amount  of  tax"
"","due for any prescribed accounting period shall not be made after the later"
"","of  the  following  (a)  two  years  after  the  end  of  the  prescribed  accounting"
"","period; or (b) one year after evidence of facts, sufficient in the opinion of the"
"","Commissioners  to  justify  the  making  of  the  assessment,  comes  to  their"
"knowledge........",""
"","The  trader said  that  the  amount  due  for any  prescribed  accounting  period"
"","can  only  be  calculated  sensibly  in  regard  to  each  accounting  period.  So"
"they  submitted","that 
the  notice  of  assessment  must 
relate 
to  each"
"accounting period separately.",""
"","The  judge  accepted  that  argument.  I  can  see  the  force  of  it.  It  is  literally"
"","correct. But it leads to such impracticable results that it is necessary to do a"
"","little adjustment so as to make the section workable. This can be done by"
"","reading in a few words, such as Bridge LJ suggested in the  course of the"
"","argument. This is, after ‘for any prescribed accounting period’ read in these"
"words, 
‘which 
is","included 
in 
the  notice  of  assessment’.  Making 
this"
"","interpolation, it means that the two years in sub s. 2(a) runs from the end of"
"the first three months included in the assessment”.",""
