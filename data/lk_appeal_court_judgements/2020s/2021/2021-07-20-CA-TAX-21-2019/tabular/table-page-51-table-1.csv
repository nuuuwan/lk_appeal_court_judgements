"“46. In this Court, the appellant criticises the judge's explanation, in the words"
"which 
I  have  emphasised 
in 
the  passage  cited, 
for 
the 
reason  why 
the"
"borrower does not  make  a  supply of  services  to the  lender. It  is said  that the"
"judge  failed  to  appreciate  that  a  borrower  does  create  rights  in  favour  of  the"
"lender  —  the  right  to  receive  interest,  rights  over  security  and  the  right  to"
"receive  repayment-for  which 
the 
lender  provides  consideration  capable  of"
"being valued in monetary terms, “namely putting the principal of the loan at the"
"borrower's  disposal 
for 
the  period  of 
the 
loan"" 
(see  paragraph  6  of 
the"
"appellant's  skeleton  argument 
in 
this  Court). 
In  my  view 
that  criticism 
is"
"misconceived.  The 
judge  was  not  addressing  a  case  where 
the  borrower"
"provides  security;  nor  was  he  addressing  a  case  where  the  borrower  issues"
"loan or debenture stock. He was addressing the simple case where money is"
"borrowed at interest. In such a case, as the judge pointed out, the payment of"
"interest is the consideration for the use of the money lent. On a proper analysis"
"the  borrower is paying  for a  service  (the  grant  of  credit) which  is provided  by"
"the lender. That is the analysis which found favour with the Advocate General"
"in the BLP case, when he said, in the passage which I have cited:"
