"Templeman LJ reversed the said proposition and held that:",""
"","(a) there was nothing in Section 31, sub-section 1 of the 1972 Finance Act (now"
"","VAT Act 1994, s. 73) to indicate that an assessment was to be confined to a"
"","single prescribed period, and since S. 31 (2) and (4), which referred to “any"
"prescribed  accounting  period”,  could  be  constituted  as  referring","to  any"
"prescribed accounting period included in the notice of assessment; and",""
"","(b) the  construction  of  Section  31  (1)  on  the  basis  that  under  S.  31  (1),  an"
"","assessment could only be made in respect of a single prescribed accounting"
"period would produce an unworkable and unreasonable result.",""
