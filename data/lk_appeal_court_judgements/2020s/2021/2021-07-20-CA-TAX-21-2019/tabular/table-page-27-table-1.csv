"[87]  The  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  referred  to  the  decision  of  this  Court  in"
"HSBC Entronic Data Processionf  Lanka  (Pvt) Ltd,  v.  The  Commissioner General"
"of  Inland  Revenue,  CA/Tax/17/2013,  decided  on  12.05.2021  and  submitted  that"
"the 3 year cap will not apply where there has been a failure to provide necessary"
"information. 
In  HSBC  Entronic  Data  Processionf  Lanka 
(Pvt)  Ltd,  v.  The"
"Commissioner General of  Inland  Revenue  (supra),  the  Court of  Appeal held  that"
"the  letter of  intimation  dated 21.02.2007  explains  that the  Appellant  has failed  to"
"provide information on the time of supplies and thus, it was justifiable  on the part"
"of the assessor to invoke the amended Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act and make a"
"singular assessment for the entire calender year 2004."
"[88]  Mr.  Goonewardena  submitted  that  the  State  has  taken  this  new  position  for"
"the  first  time  in  appeal  and  thus,  the  State  is  now  prevented  from  relying  on"
"Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act at this stage of the appeal. I find however, that the"
"Respondent  has  raised  this  issue  in  the  written  submissions  filed  in  the  appeal"
"proceedings  before  the  Commissioner  General  and  stated  that  as  the  Appellant"
"has failed to fulfil its legal obligation of filing the annual adjustment within time as"
"required by Section 25C (1) after the closing of the relevant accounting period, the"
"limitation of time for assessment as mentioned in Section 33 (1) is not applicable"
"(p. 126 of the record). I further find that the Tax Appeals Commission has, taken"
"the  view  that  as  the  Appellant  has  not  furnished  the  information  necessary  to"
"calculate  and  assess  the  financial  VAT  in  time  as  stipulated  in  the  VAT  Act,  the"
"Apppellant cannot seek the benefit of the statutory time bar:"
"“unless  the  taxpayer  provides  such  information  in  time  as  stipulated  in  the"
"statute, the officials of the Inland Revenue Department are not in a position to"
"calculate  the  tax 
liability  and  issue  the  assessment  within  the  time  period"
"stipulated  in  the  statute.  In  this  case  it  is  clear  in  respect  of  certain  VAT"
"returns, the required documents have been submitted to the CGIR even after"
"the  statutory 
time  bar  period.........one  should  not  be  allowed  to  avoid 
tax"
"liability  under 
the  guise  of 
the  statutory 
time  bar,  by  not  providing 
the"
"necessary information in time to calculate the relevant tax liability. Therefore it"
"is our view that the Apppellant cannot seek the benefit of the statutory time bar"
"for the taxable periods from April to December 2010, as he has not furnished"
"the information that were necessary to calculate and assess the financial VAT"
"as stipulated in the VAT Act.”"
"[89] It is quite clear that even though no reference was made to section 33 (2), the"
"Tax  Appeals  Commission  has  held  that  where  the  taxpayer  failed  to  provide  all"
"material information in time necessary to calculate and assess the financial VAT,"
"the limitation period in Section 33 (1) has no application and thus, we have to look"
"at  the  applicability  of  Section  33  (2)  of  the  VAT  Act.  I  must  emphasise  however,"
"that Section 33 (2) requires the assessor to form an opinion that the taxpayer has"
"wilfully  or fraudulently  failed  to  make  a full  and  true  disclosure of all the material"
"facts necessary to determine the amount of tax.   The word ""willful"" has not been"
