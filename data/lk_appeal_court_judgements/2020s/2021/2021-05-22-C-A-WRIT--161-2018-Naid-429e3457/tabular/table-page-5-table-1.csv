"T
he  11th  and  12th  Respondents  had  appeared  before  the  Board  upon  notices  being"
"served. It had later transpired that the 11th and 12th Respondents had transferred a"
"portion of Lot No. 1 to the 13th Respondent a few days before the Petitioner filed the"
"application  before  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board.  The  remaining  portion  of  the  land"
"had been transferred to the 14th and 15th Respondents thereafter, which prompted"
"the  Petitioner  to  name  the  13th  â€“  15th  Respondents  as  parties  before  the  Board."
"Although the 11th and 12th Respondents were represented by their Attorney-at-Law"
"before the Board at the outset, the 11th -15th Respondents were neither present nor"
"represented  thereafter,  prompting  the  Board  to  fix  the  matter  for  an  ex  parte"
"hearing."
