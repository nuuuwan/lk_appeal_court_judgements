"the bidding document. I do not see there is any legal impediment to include any additional"
"requirement in a bidding document which does not supersede or override any provisions of"
"the Act."
"It is important now to examine as to whether the Petitioner is entitled to overlook or violate"
"General Conditions imposed by the Procurement Entity. The golden rule in a tender process"
"is that any person who tenders or enter into public contract with any public body is bound to"
"follow such conditions of the bidding document/ General Conditions."
"Also, I observe that the Petitioner has never taken steps to raise his concerns or objections"
"against the said requirement of submitting the Certificate before the closing of bids. Instead"
"of  raising  such  concerns  or  seeking  for  any  clarification  he  submitted  the  Certificate  on"
"25.08.2020  and  he  has  not  given  any  explanation  as  to  why  he  is  not  complying  the"
"conditions  of  the  set  out 
in  Clause  7.0  of  the  General  Conditions  of  the  bid.  In  the"
"circumstances, when analyzing the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner, I am of the view that"
"the  Petitioner's  conduct,  particularly  the  acquiescence  during  the  tender  process  should  be"
"taken  into  consideration  (see  my  judgment  in Walter  Abeysundara  and  another V.  Secretary"
"Ministry of Tourism and others, cited above)."
"In 
the  case  of  SmithKline  Beecham  Biologicals  S.A. and Another  v.  State  Pharmaceutical"
"Corporation of Sri Lanka and others(1997) 3 Sri LR 20 the Supreme Court held as follows;"
"“Therefore,  the  Guidelines  too  make  it  clear  that  a  Tender  Board  may  only  consider  bids  which  are"
"responsive  and  qualified  by  substantially  conforming  with  the  tender  documents.  The  State  and  its"
"agencies are bound by and must rigorously and scrupulously observe the procedures laid down by them"
"on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them. Justice Frankfurter in Vitarelii v. Seatom  said:"
"‘An  executive  agency  must  be  rigorously  held  to  the  standards  by  which  it  professes  its  action  to  be"
"judged ; Accordingly, if ... [an action] is based on a defined procedure, even though generous beyond the"
"requirements  that  bind  the  agency,  the  procedure  must  be  scrupulously  observed  ...  This  judicially"
"evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may add, rightly so. He that takes"
"the procedural sword shall perish with the sword’. ”"
