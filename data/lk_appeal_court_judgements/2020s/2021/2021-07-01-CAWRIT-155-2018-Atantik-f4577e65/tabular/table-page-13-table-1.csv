"members  whose  relationship  to  the  Fund  is  contractual  and  that  whatever  decisions"
"that are taken are contractual in nature and devoid of any statutory underpinning."
"T
he Fund has been established by an Air Force Order and in terms of the powers vested"
"in  the  Commander  under  the  Act.  Unlike  a  welfare  society,  the  Fund  does  not  have  a"
"constitution  of  its  own,  or  even  if  it  does,  none  has  been  produced.  The  Respondents"
"have not placed any material before this Court to establish that the Fund has a group of"
"office  bearers  who,  even  though  they  are  serving  officers  of  the  SLAF,  perform  their"
"functions independent of their official titles and functions. On the contrary, the position"
"of  the  Respondents has been  that the Fund  is being administered  by the Commander,"
"and that decisions have been taken by the Board of Management of the SLAF."
"T
he Respondents have also not placed  any  material before  this Court to establish that"
"the moneys lying to the  credit of  the Fund is kept in  a  special bank account without it"
"being  mixed  with  State  funds.  While  one  would  imagine  that  the  monies  belonging  to"
"the Fund are held by the Commander in trust for the members, the Respondents have"
"admitted that the moneys lying to the credit of the Fund is the property of the SLAF and"
"can be dealt with by the Commander in terms of the powers vested in him in terms of"
"the Air Force Act – vide Section 156 of the Act. In light of these representations made by"
"the Respondents themselves, this Court cannot deny the existence of a statutory nexus"
"to the impugned decisions."
"F
urthermore,  even  the  documents  that  have  been  sent  by  the  Respondents  to  the"
"Petitioners – i.e. ‘P4’, ‘P7’, ‘P8’ and ‘P12’ - have been written in the official capacities of"
"the relevant officer, with ‘P7’ and ‘P12’ having been sent on behalf of the Commander"
"of the SLAF. It is also clear from ‘R2’ and the annexures thereto that the decision (a) to"
"commence the scheme, and (b) to re-visit the scheme in 2017, have been taken by the"
"SLAF and not by a set of office bearers of a welfare society."
"W
hen  I  take  into  consideration  the  totality  of  the  above  material,  it  is  clear  that  the"
"Fund has been established by the Commander of the SLAF in terms of the Air Force Act,"
"and that the decisions that are being impugned in this application have been taken on"
"13"
