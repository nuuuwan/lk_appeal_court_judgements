"The scope of judicial review has seen many developments since the often quoted words"
"of  Lord  Atkin,  J  in  Rex  v.  Electricity  Commissioners  ex  parte  London  Electricity  Joint"
"Committee  Co1  where  it  was  held  that  the  controls  of  judicial  review  may  be  used"
"“wherever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting"
"the  rights  of  subjects,  and  having  the  duty  to  act  judicially,  act  in  excess  of  their  legal"
"authority.”"
