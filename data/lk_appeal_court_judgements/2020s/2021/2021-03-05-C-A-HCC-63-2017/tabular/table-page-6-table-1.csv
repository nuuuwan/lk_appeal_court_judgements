"The  Appellant  has  admitted  all  the  Post-Mortem  Reports,  Medico-Legal"
"reports  and 
the  Report  of 
the  Examiner  of  Motor  Vehicles  without"
"burdening  the  prosecution  to  call 
the  doctors  and  the  other  officers  as"
"witnesses. 
The  Accused-Appellant  expressed  his  willingness 
to  plead"
"guilty 
to 
the 
charges 
before 
the 
trial 
started 
expecting 
a 
lenient"
"punishment  for  which  the  State  did  not  agree.  The  Accused-Appellant"
"has no previous convictions."
"Although the crack in the leaf spring was not the cause of the accident, it"
"could have some bearing in aggravating the result of the accident."
"In view of the above,  we  are of the opinion that 37 and half year sentence"
"imposed  upon  the  Appellant  is  too  harsh  and  excessive.  Therefore,  the"
"sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  trial Judge  is  set aside. 
We  impose  a"
"imprisonment  on 
the  Accused-Appellant 
to 
term  of  05  years  rigorous"
"take effect from  the date of conviction, namely 20th  March 2017."
"Subject  to  the  variation  of  the  sentence,  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant  is"
"dismissed."
