"15.","I  am  unable  to  agree  with  the  submission  of  the  learned  State  Counsel  that"
"","according to the evidence adduced in the trial Court when the accused caused"
"","the injuries on the deceased he intended to kill him. If he intended to kill him,"
"","the accused could have cut a vital part of the body like the head, neck, chest or"
"","abdomen before he left the deceased.  Hence  I find  that it is unsafe to convict"
"","the  accused 
for  murder. 
I 
set  aside 
the  conviction 
for  murder  and 
the"
"","consequential sentence to death and convict the accused appellant for culpable"
"","homicide  not  amounting  to  murder  punishable  in  terms  of  Section  297  of  the"
"","Penal Code."
"16.","The appellant is sentenced to ten years’ rigorous imprisonment. In addition the"
"","appellant  is  ordered  to  pay  a  fine  of  Rupees  Ten  Thousand,  in  default  of"
"","payment of the fine, three months’ simple imprisonment to be served."
