"7.","PW2 in her evidence has given a clear account of what happened and what she"
"","saw on the fateful day. Although no contradiction was marked in her evidence"
"","and her previous statements, she was questioned by the defence Counsel at the"
"","trial  that  she  had  told  the  learned  Magistrate  that  one  Rajini  told  her  that  the"
"","deceased was fallen with injuries in Raja’s land. She has said that she could not"
"","remember saying so. However, it is to be noted that no omission was brought to"
"","the  notice  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  that  she  has  not  mentioned  to  the"
"","learned  Magistrate  what  she  saw  as  testified  in  the  High  Court.  Her  evidence"
"","has  been  consistent.  The  prosecution  has  failed 
to  discredit  her,  and  her"
"","evidence could be relied upon."
"8.","The main argument urged by the learned President’s Counsel for the appellant"
"","is  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the  elements  of  murder  against  the"
"","appellant and therefore the learned High Court Judge erred when he convicted"
"","the appellant for murder instead of culpable homicide not amounting to murder."
"","It is the contention of the learned President’s Counsel that the prosecution has"
"","failed to prove that the appellant intended  to cause the  death of the deceased."
"","Further,  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  by  medical  evidence  that  the  bodily"
"","injury  intended to be inflicted  is sufficient  in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature to"
"","cause  death.  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  argued 
that 
therefore, 
the"
"","prosecution has failed to prove the offence of culpable homicide committed by"
"","the 
appellant 
amounts 
to  murder 
as 
it 
failed 
to 
fulfill 
the 
necessary"
"","requirements mentioned in section 294 of the Penal Code."
"9.","The  learned  State  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  submitted  that  the  prosecution"
"","has  proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the  appellant  intended  to  cause  the"
"","death of the deceased. It is his contention that the sequence of events proves the"
"","intention  of  the  appellant.  The  learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that  it  is  not"
"","necessary  to  go  into  the  knowledge  as  the  murderous  intention  is  proved  as"
"","provided in limb 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code."
"10.","The  learned  State  Counsel  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Court  the  decided"
"","case of Bastian Silva v Appuhamy 4 NLR  47 where it was  held that it is not"
"","the nature of the wound but the intention of the accused which is decisive as to"
"","the nature of the crime committed. In Bastian Silva the accused after wounding"
"","the victim,  wounded  with  a  knife three  other persons  who tried  to  arrest  him."
"","The accused in that case was charged for causing hurt to one Bastian Silva and"
"","wounding  three  other  persons.  After  taking  into  consideration  the  evidence"
"","including the medical evidence, the Court held that it was consistent with this"
"","being an attempt to murder."
