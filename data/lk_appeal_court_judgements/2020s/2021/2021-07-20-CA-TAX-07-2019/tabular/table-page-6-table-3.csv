"Act provides for such an alteration. Section 25 reads thus;"
"25.  (1)  Where  a  registered  person,  has  issued  a  tax  invoice  and"
"accounted for an incorrect amount of tax by undercharging or"
"overcharging tax on a supply made to another person, he shall"
"be entitled to issue to such other person a tax debit note or a tax"
"credit note, as the case may be, for the purpose of adjusting the"
"amount of tax so undercharged or overcharged."
"Provided, however, the adjustment in respect of input tax under"
"claimed on an original tax invoice shall be made in respect of a"
"tax debit note or a tax credit note issued not later than six months"
"after the issue of the original tax invoice, to which the tax debit"
"note or the tax credit note relates."
