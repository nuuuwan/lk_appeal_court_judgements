"of the learned Counsel for the Respondent. The only necessary conditions"
"for what can be included in a tax credit note in terms of Section 25 appear"
"to be the six-month time limit specified in the proviso, and the fact that"
"only those invoices belonging to a single taxable period must be included."
"On the interpretation of fiscal statutes, Bindra states that:11"
"“It is a well-known principle of interpretation that when construing a fiscal"
"statute, the court has to lean in its interpretation in favour of the subject,"
"rather than in favour of the State.”"
"In keeping with the above principle, and for the reasons set out above, it is"
"my view that the Respondent’s returns should not have been rejected for"
"the sole reason that it did not issue an individual tax credit note per tax"
"invoice."
"Thus, having considered all arguments under this question of law, I hold"
"that the TAC has not erred in interpreting the ‘adjustment of tax by credit"
"or debit notes’ as stipulated for under Section 25 of the VAT Act."
"I therefore answer all three questions of law in the negative, and in favour"
"of the Respondent."
"1. Whether the TAC has erred in interpreting the ‘value of supply of goods"
"or services’ pursuant to Section 5 (1) of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14"
"of 2002. No"
"2.  Whether  the  TAC  has  erred  in  interpreting  the  ‘open  market  value’"
"pursuant to Section 83 of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002. No"
"3.  Whether  the  TAC  has  erred  in  interpreting  the  ‘adjustment  of  tax  by"
"credit or debit notes’ as stipulated in Section 25 of the Value Added Tax"
"Act No. 14 of 2002. (vide ‘X4’). No"
"Acting under Section 11 A (6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23"
"of 2011 (as amended), I affirm the determination made by the TAC and"
"dismiss this appeal."
