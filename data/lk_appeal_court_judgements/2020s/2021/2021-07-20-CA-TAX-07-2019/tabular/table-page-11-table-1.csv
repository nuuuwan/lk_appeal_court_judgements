"could obtain a cash refund from the company by returning the cashback"
"coupons printed on the label of the product."
"Elida Gibbs Ltd., claimed that the amount of money refunded on coupons"
"constituted a discount and therefore, VAT had to be charged on the value"
"once adjusted for these coupons."
"The Court therefore observed that:8"
"“In 
circumstances 
such 
as 
those 
in 
the  main 
proceedings, 
the"
"manufacturer, who has refunded the value of the money-off coupon to the"
"retailer  or  the  value  of  the  cashback  coupon  to  the  final  consumer,"
"receives, on completion of the transaction, a sum corresponding to the sale"
"price paid by the wholesalers or retailers for his goods, less the value of"
"those coupons. It would not therefore be in conformity with the directive"
"(sic) for the taxable amount used to calculate the VAT chargeable to the"
"manufacturer, as a taxable person, to exceed the sum finally received by"
"him.  Were  that  the  case,  the  principle  of  neutrality  of  VAT  vis-à-vis"
"taxable  persons,  of  whom 
the  manufacturer 
is  one,  would  not  be"
"complied with."
"Consequently,  the  taxable amount attributable  to  the manufacturer  as a"
"taxable person must be the amount corresponding to the price at which he"
"sold  the  goods  to  the  wholesalers  or  retailers,  less  the  value  of  those"
"coupons (emphasis added).”"
"It was further observed that:9"
"“…in order to ensure observance of  the principle of neutrality, account"
"had to be taken, when calculating the taxable amount for VAT, of situations"
"where a taxable person who, having no contractual relationship with the"
"final  consumer  but  being  the  first  link  in  a  chain  of  transactions  which"
"ended with the final consumer, granted the consumer the reduction through"
"retailers  or  by  direct  repayment  of  the  value  of  the  coupons  (emphasis"
"added).”"
"The  principle,  as  decided  by 
the  Court  of  Justice  of 
the  European"
"Communities, that where a trader supplied goods for a stated consideration,"
"but under a sales promotion arrangement, was obliged to pay an amount"
