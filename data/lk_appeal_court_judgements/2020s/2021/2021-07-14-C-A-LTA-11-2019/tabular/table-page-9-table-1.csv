"It is pertinent to be noted that the Sheriff’s case (supra) is factually different"
"from the instant case. In the case in hand, the said certificate has been filed"
"by the Respondents along with the plaint. But, in Sheriff’s case the approval"
"was  not  obtained  from  the  Board and  the  certificate  was not  issued  by  the"
"Director. In the circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the decision in"
"Sheriff’s case has no application to the instant case."
"For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the"
"Wakfs Tribunal dated 14.12.2019. Thus, the appeal is dismissed with costs,"
"fixed at Rs. 25,000/- and the impugned order is affirmed."
"The  Registrar  is  directed  to  dispatch  a  copy  of  this  order  to  the  Wakfs"
"Tribunal."
