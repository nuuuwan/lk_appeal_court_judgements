"The attention of this Court is drawn to the observation made by the Wakfs"
"tribunal in this regard, which reads thus:"
"â€œIt is an undisputable fact that the Director of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs,"
"over a period of time, has been performing the functions pertaining to those of the"
"Director designated under the Wakfs Act. The issuance of the certificates (like P4) has"
"been accepted in several cases as the function of the Director for Mosques and Muslim"
"Charitable Trusts of Wakfs. Since one person is functioning in a dual position, the mere"
"wrong designation appearing under the signature of the Director in P4 cannot be taken"
