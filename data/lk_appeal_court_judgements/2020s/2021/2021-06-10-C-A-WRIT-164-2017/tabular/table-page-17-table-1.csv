"It is in the above circumstances that the Petitioners complained to the USAB about"
"the non-payment of the academic allowance."
"I
 have already set out the  evolution  of  the  Petitioners  from  ETA  to a  teacher while"
"maintaining  their  salary  as  an  ETA  on  a  personal  to  holder  basis  but  subject  to"
"ensuring that their  take home pay was not less than what they  would have earned"
"had  they  continued  as  ETAs.  Having  opted 
for 
the  above  scheme,  which  was"
"beneficial  to  the  Petitioners  at  that  time,  the  Petitioners  cannot 
later  claim  an"
"entitlement  to  the  academic  allowance,  when  doing  so  is  more  beneficial  to  the"
"Petitioners. The learned Senior State Counsel has quite rightly pointed out that the"
"Petitioners would be paid their academic allowance when the conversion takes place"
"and the Petitioners start receiving a salary of a teacher. The fact of the matter is that"
"the  conversion  has  not  taken  place  and  therefore 
I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"Petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  the  payment  of  the  academic  allowance  which  is  a"
"component of the salary paid only to a teacher."
"T
he  Respondents  have  submitted  that  the  basic  salary  of  a  teacher  is  substantially"
"less  than  the  personal  to  holder  salary  that  the  Petitioners  are  receiving.  If  the"
"academic  allowance  of  136%  is  calculated  at  the  personal  to  holder  salary,  that"
"would  be  unjust  and  be  a  windfall  to  the  Petitioners.  The 
learned  Senior  State"
"Counsel submitted that if this happened, the gross remuneration that the Petitioners"
"would receive will exceed that of other teachers including Professors and that such a"
"situation would be unfair and inequitable and lead to an anomaly."
"H
owever, all is not lost for the Petitioners, for the reason that in terms of paragraph"
"3 of ‘R2’, until the conversion takes place, the Petitioners are entitled to be paid the"
"difference by way of a special allowance. It appears from the above table for January"
"2014 that the Petitioners have only been paid a sum of Rs. 71129 whereas had they"
"been placed on the salary scale of a teacher, the Petitioners would have received Rs."
"103,110.  In  terms  of  ‘R3’,  the  Petitioners  are  entitled  to  be  paid  the  difference  by"
"way of a special allowance, if payment has not been made already."
"T
he Petitioners have sought a Writ of  Mandamus directing the Respondents to pay"
"them  the  academic  allowance. 
I  have  already  held  that  the  Petitioners  are  not"
"entitled to the payment of an academic allowance. I am therefore not in a position to"
"grant the Writ of Mandamus that has been prayed for."
