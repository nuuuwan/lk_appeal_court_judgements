"Taking  into  consideration  all  of  the  above circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"Hon. Magistrate has acted outside the jurisdiction conferred on him and the decision"
"to issue summons is clearly illegal and is therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of"
"Certiorari."
"T
he aforementioned submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General gives rise to"
"another aspect that I wish to advert to. A Magistrate who is called upon to decide if"
"sufficient  grounds  exist 
to 
issue  summons  on  a  private  plaint  must  act  with"
"circumspection, 
for 
the 
reason 
that  such  a  complaint 
is  not  preceded  by  an"
"investigation  by  an 
independent 
law  enforcement  agency,  and  can  arise  from  a"
"private animosity or may have been filed for a collateral purpose. In other words, a"
"Magistrate  must be alive to the  fact that  the  process of  Court may  be  abused  by a"
"complainant  in  a  private  plaint  and  it  is  for  that  reason  that  the  Magistrate  must"
"consider  the  material  before  him  in  the  context  of  the  ingredients  of  the  offence,"
"before issuing summons, thus preventing the criminal justice system from being used"
"in  an  arbitrary  manner.  A  Magistrate  must  therefore  exercise  caution  when  issuing"
"summons  on  a  private  plaint 
for 
the  reason 
that 
the  consequence  of 
issuing"
"summons is to make an innocent person stand trial as an accused. To permit a case"
"without merit to be taken through the criminal justice system has an impact on the"
"private  and  work  life  of  an  accused  as  well  as  cause  an  unnecessary  burden  on  an"
"already burdened criminal justice system.3"
"W
hile  it  is  mandatory  that  the  evidence  of  the  complainant  should  be  led  where  a"
"warrant is sought, it is not so where the application under Section 139 is limited to"
"summons. In exercising his discretion whether the complainant should be heard even"
"where  only  summons  is  being  sought,  it  would  be  appropriate  for  a  Magistrate  to"
"bear in mind the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Peter"
"Leo Fernando vs The Attorney General and Others4 which sets out the rationale for"
"the recording of evidence prior to issuing a warrant:"
"“The  requirement  as  to  the  examination  of  the  complainant  is  imperative  and"
"should  be  strictly  complied  with 
in  order  to  prevent  a  false,  frivolous  and"
"3  See  the  judgment  of  the  Federal  Court  of  Malaysia  in  Sundra  Rajoo  Nadarajah  vs  Menteri  Luar  Negeri,"
"Malaysia  &  ORS  [Civil  Appeal  No:  01(F)-38-12-2020(W)  –  9th  June  2021]  in  the  context  of  the  prosecutorial"
