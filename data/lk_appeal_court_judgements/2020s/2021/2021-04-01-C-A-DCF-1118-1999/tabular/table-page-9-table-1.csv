"The evidence of the 26th Defendant on Laisohamy also remains un contradicted and she states"
"that Laisohamy died leaving two children Werisihamy and Barton, and Barton died leaving six"
"children namely, Amis, Girigoris, Amaris, Deesan, Dabilin and Alison. I therefore believe that"
"the 26th Defendant is a blood relation and her evidence as regards the devolution of title is"
"acceptable and can be relied on as having been on special knowledge."
"The fact that the 26th Defendant is a relation has been admitted by the contesting Defendants"
"[vide pages 271 of the Appeal Brief]"
