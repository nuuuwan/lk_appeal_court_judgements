"referred to in the Plaintiffs pedigree. Most of the Deeds have been executed in March, April"
"and May, 1983, just 5 months before the Plaintiff, instituted this action. They were attested"

"377 clearly refers to  Agampodi Doiso Mendis hamy.(Vide page 377.)"
"The Appellants state that at this juncture it is important that we once again draw our attention"
"to the fact that the Plaintiff’s witness Somasiri Perera too has at page 227 clearly admitted"
