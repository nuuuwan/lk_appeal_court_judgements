"Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the absence"
"of such circumstances."""
"It is the view of the respondent that the appellant had not discharged the evidential burden"
"thrust upon him under the aforesaid section of the Evidence Ordinance."
"In the Privy Council decision in Jayasena Vs Queen; 72 NLR 313 it was held that, ""Where an"
"accused who is charged with murder admits at the trial that the deceased died of wounds"
"deliberately inflicted by him with intention to kill and his defence entirely is that he was acting"
"in self-defence, section 105, read with section 3, of the Evidence Ordinance imposes upon the"
"accused the burden of proof on the issue of private defence"". Therefore, it was argued by the"
"respondent  that  the  accused-appellant  has  not  discharged  the  burden  of  proving  the"
"existence of any of the general exceptions as stipulated in the Penal Code."
"The principle involved in this section derives from the English law of evidence, where it has"
"however been  sparingly used.  The prosecution  is  usually  able  to  establish that an  accused"
"person has special knowledge of the circumstances of the crime with which he is charged."
"Under some systems of law this is considered to be sufficient for the accused to be called"
"upon  at  the  outset  of  a  trial  to  say  what  he  knows.  Such  a  procedure  would  be  quite"
"inconsistent  with  the  accusedâ€™s  right  to  silence  which  prevails  in  the  English  system  as"
"adopted in Ceylon."
"The evidence of defence witness Thiagarajah Sujitharan was that he was 16-17 years of age"
"at the time of the incident. It was his evidence that on the day in question he along with the"
"other 2 accused and another had gone to Poonthottam on a motor bicycle and when they"
"were  proceeding  along  a  particular  road,  he  had  seen  the  deceased,  Nishanthan  and  one"
"Master consuming liquor by the roadside and upon seeing them Nishanthan had beckoned"
"him to halt and asked him to get a bottle of soda. When he had intimated that he would bring"
"soda on his return journey an exchange of words had brewed at which point Nishanthan had"
"slapped accused number 3."
"Consequent to this incident, the witness had come home and it was the evidence of the said"
"witness that the deceased, Nishanthan, Master and  2 others had come to their village in a"
"three-wheeler  and  when  the  deceased  had  been  talking  to  his  mother,  Nishanthan  upon"
"seeing the witness had assaulted him twice at which point his mother had come to the scene"
"and Nishanthan had held the brazier of his mother and the witness's hand resulting in the"
"mother having a fall at which point, his elder brother had come and having taken him to a"
"neighbouring  house  had  locked  him  up  and  what  transpired  thereafter  was  not  within  his"
"knowledge."
"For  the  defence  another  witness  Thiagarah  Gowrie  has  given  evidence  corroborating  the"
"evidence of defence witness Thiagarah Sujithharan."
"The accused-appellant giving evidence on oath has testified that he was 20 years at the time"
"of the incident and that on the day in question when he was having his meals around 4.00"
"p.m., he had heard a commotion on the road which prompted him to go outside where he"
"had seen Nishanthan, Jegan and the deceased talking to his mother."
