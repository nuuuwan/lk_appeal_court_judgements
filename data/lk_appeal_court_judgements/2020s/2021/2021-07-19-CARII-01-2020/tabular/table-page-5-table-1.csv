"marked පෑ 02 it is apparent that the aforesaid lot no. 08 adjoins lot no. 10 which is"
"the corpus in this case. According to the judgement marked X 02 there had been"
"an earlier action – no. 17128 ඉඩම් between Daniel and the owners of the aforesaid"
"lot  10  –  the  corpus  in  this  case  and  it  had  been  decided  in  that  case  that  the"
"aforesaid Daniel had prescribed to a portion of lot 10 namely lot no. 10A which was"
"in  dispute  in  that  case.    The  Court  had  dismissed  that  action  instituted  by  the"
"owners  of  the  corpus  against  Daniel,  on  that  basis.  The  Court  had  come  to  the"
"conclusion  that  Daniel  had  been  in  possession  of  the  aforesaid  lot  no.  10A  and"
"prescribed to that lot against Simon who became the owner of lot no. 10 under the"
"final decree in the earlier partition action."
"Although the petitioners had failed to superimpose the plan marked පෑ 01 filed of"
"record in 17128 ඉඩම් on the preliminary plan in this case and on the final scheme"
"of partition in the earlier action to show that the disputed lot no. 10A in case no."
"17128 ඉඩම් is identical to lot no. 01 depicted in the preliminary plan in this case"
"which is in dispute, (the petitioners will obviously face practical difficulties in doing"
"so) on a balance of probability of the evidence one can come to the conclusion that"
"lot no. 10A which was in dispute in case no. 17128 ඉඩම් is the same portion of land"
"which is shown as lot 01 in the preliminary plan, for the following reasons."
"When  one  examines  the  preliminary  plan  no.  2005P  marked  X  at  the  trial  it  is"
"apparent that there is a physical demarcation of the common boundary between"
"the  disputed  lot  01  and  the  balance  portion of  the corpus.  There  is  a  live  fence"
"separating lot 01 from the adjoining lot 02 which is a portion of the corpus. That"
"shows that the disputed lot no. 01 was not possessed as a part of the corpus in this"
"case and it was possessed as a separate lot. The commissioner in his report marked"
"X 01 had reported to court that the disputed lot 01 was annexed to the adjoining"
"lot  08  which  means  that  it  remained  as  a  portion  of  the  adjoining  land  lot  08."
"Therefore it is obvious that the disputed lot no. 01 was possessed as a portion of"
"the adjoining lot no. 08. The petitioners who are the heirs of Daniel do not claim"
"any other portion of the corpus. Therefore on a balance of probability of evidence"
"one can come to the conclusion that lot no. 01 in the preliminary plan which is in"
"dispute in this case is the same portion of land which was in dispute in the earlier"
"case 17128 ඉඩම්."
