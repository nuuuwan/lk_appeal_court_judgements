"12.","In  the  case  of Biso Menika  V.  Cyril de  Alwis  afl(l Others (1982/1 Sri LR 368, the"
"","Supreme Court held:"
"","""When  the  Court has examined the record and is  satisfied the  Order complained of is"
"","manifestly  erroneous  or  without jurisdiction  the  Court  would be  loathe  to  allow  the"
"","mischief of the  Order  to  continue  and reject  the  application simply on  the  ground of"
"","delay,  unless there  are  very extraordinary reasons to justifY such rejection.  Where  the"
"","authority concerned has  been  acting altogether  without  basic jurisdiction,  the  Court"
"","may grant relief in  spite of the delay unless the  conduct of the party shows that he has"
"","approbated the  usurpation  of jurisdiction.  In  any such  event,  the  explanation  of the"
"","delay should be considered sympathetically. """
"13.","The petitioner in submitting the sequence of events,  in  paragraph  10  of his  petition has"
"","stated  that  this  alleged  unlawful  construction  commenced  on  or  about  31 ""  August"
"","2008.  I"" 3'd  4th  5th  and  6th  respondents  in  paragraph  8 of their statement of objections"
"","dated  17th  December 2008, have admitted the  contents of paragraph  10  of the petition,"
"","other than the contention that the construction is  wrongful and  unlawful."
"14.","The  petitioner  has  written  the  letter  marked  as  PS  on  9th  September  2008  to  the  I"""
"","respondent objecting to  the above construction.  The petitioner also  has  written  letters"
"","marked  P6  to  the  6th  respondent with  copies  to  the  2nd  and  5th  respondents  and  P7  to"
"","respondent  with  copies 
to 
the  2nd 
and  5th 
respondents  objecting 
to 
the 
the  6th"
"","construction, and the acceptance of the  above  letters  is  not denied. On  18th  September"
"","2008,  the  3'd  respondent  sent  the  letter  marked  PIO  stating,  among  other  things,  that"
"","the  approval  was  granted  by  the  2nd  respondent  for  the  construction.  The respondents"
"","have continued with the construction work.  The petitioner filed the instant application"
"","on  26th  September 2008.  Hence,  the submission  by  the respondents  that  the petitioner"
"","is guilty of lashes is  untenable."
