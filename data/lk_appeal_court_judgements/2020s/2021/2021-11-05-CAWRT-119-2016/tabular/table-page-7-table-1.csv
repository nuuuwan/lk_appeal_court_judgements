"title to the subject matter. Without following the correct path, he had been trying to establish"
"his  claim  as  the owner of the portion of land  on  a  decision of an officer  of the Athanagale"
"divisional secret. The officer who declared that the Petitioner as the owner is not competent to"
"declare ownership of lands claimed by the State. In this instance, the officer had requested the"
"Attorney  General's  opinion  before  awarding  compensation  under  Section  17  of  the  Land"
"Acquisition  Act.  Mere  seeking  a  view  from  the  Attorney  General  does  not  give  a  right  to"
"anyone."
"The Petitioner claims that he has a right to defend the title of lots 263, 262, 260, 259, 258, 257,"
"254, etc. He claims that he had intervened at the sale of the lots. What is essential is that even"
"he was the previous owner who sold those lots of lands after the sale, he has no right to bring"
"an action on behalf of the present owners unless the person who bought the land came forward"
"to safeguard his rights. A court will entertain only the titleholder. Even though the Petitioner"
"claims that he must warrant and defend the title, how can he do so if the present owners are not"
"coming forward? Until the people who bought the lands from him come forward, the Petitioner"
"has no status to interfere in matters that do not concern him. It is the law that necessary parties"
"should be present. When the necessary parties are not before the Court, their rights cannot be"
"discussed.  This  position  had  been  discussed  in  Ukwatta  Vs  DFCC3  and  Blambers  V  DG"
"customs.4  In  these  cases,  it  had  discussed  that  failure  to  make  necessary  parties  is  a  fatal"
"irregularity. Therefore, the Petitioner's argument that he must safeguard the ownership of those"
"who bought from him cannot be considered."
"As discussed earlier, the Petitioner should have gone before the relevant Court, which has the"
"power to hear and examine witnesses and documents and come to a conclusion regarding the"
"title. At such a forum, the State and the Petitioner could have placed their respective witnesses"
"and subjected them cross-examined. All deeds, plans and any vital documents were produced"
"and clarified. Thereby a judge can conclude a trial and pronounce the owner."
"The most crucial issue, in this case, is to determine the ownership of the subject matter, the"
"State or an individual. In Thajudeen Vs Sri Lanka tea board and another5 discussed a similar"
"situation, a writ should not be issued in a condition of this nature."
