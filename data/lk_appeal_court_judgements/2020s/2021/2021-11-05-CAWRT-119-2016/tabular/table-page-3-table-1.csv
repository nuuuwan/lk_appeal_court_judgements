"pronounced  the  Petitioner  to  be  the  owner  of  lots  255,264,265,  and  308.  Subsequently,  by"
"notice dated 19.02.2014. 1st Respondent had informed that the Petitioner is the owner only of"
"lots 264  and 308. Further 1st Respondent had reported that by  preliminary Plan No. 20218,"
"those lots were already acquired by the State as far back as  1931. When inquired for grounds"
"in which the authority claims those lots as State land, the only reason given to the Plaintiff was"
"that in Plan no 20218 (this was marked and produced as P14), there is a side note which reads"
"as 'Stakes on the boundaries of lots 1 and 3 replaced with Public Works Dept Stones by P.W.D.,"
"checked by Mr C Dirckze third-grade surveyor, ……inserted by V. Sadasivam examine by M."
"Benjamin.  (11.01.32).  On  the  strength  of  this  information,  it  is  clear  that  the  only  basis  on"
"which  the  1st  Respondent  claims  the  land  in  question  belongs  to  the  State  is  a  side  minute"
"entered in the said document."

"been identified as lands encroached by Dr J.D.L. Perera. Other than that, the authorities failed"
"to furnish proof to prove that these lands belong to the State. Petitioner claimed compensation"
"for  the  land,  but  the  authorities  have  not  paid,  making  excuses  that  the  land  was  already"
"acquired."
