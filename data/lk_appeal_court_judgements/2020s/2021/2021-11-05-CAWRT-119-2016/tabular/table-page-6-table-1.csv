"G.M. Nimalasiri V. Col. P. B.J. Fernando and others1  Express that administrative error cannot"
"be a basis of legitimate expectation."
"Vasana Vs Incorporation of Legal Education2  held, ""When the basic ingredient necessary for"
"the  formation  of  a  legitimate  expectation………  is  lacking,  the  Petitioner  cannot  rely  on  a"
"document which contains a provisional decision which has been subsequently found to be a"
"decision based on erroneous factual data submitted to the law college due to an inadvertent"
"error committed by the examiner. """
"In light of this decision, it is clear the letters P9a-P9d declaring the Petitioner as the owner does"
"not give any legitimacy to the Petitioner. On the other hand, the Petitioner had the opportunity"
"to go before a competent court and prove his title, challenging document P11and the Gazette,"
"which has named him an unlawful occupier."
"That was the time at which the Petitioner should have defended his rights. A person who sleeps"
"on his right cannot suddenly seek remedies from Court."
"As  the  first  Respondent  or  the  officer  who  issued  documents  marked  as  P9  has  no  legal"
"standing, the question of compensation does not arise. However, since there is a decision to"
"pay unlawful occupants who had made improvements, as that is a declaration by the Minister"
"to grant compensation, it becomes valid. As there was no land to acquire, and the law does not"
"permit a right on documents or decisions taken on administrative error, compensation cannot"
"be considered to lots owned by the State."
"Section 18 of the Land Accusation Act speaks of situations where an acquiring officer makes"
"a mistake and if such a mistake was found before making the award under Section 17. In such"
"an event, any proceedings after the error shall be null and void. In the present case, the Section"
"17  award  had  not  been  granted.  Therefore,  when  the  officer  realises  that  the  Petitioner's"
"declaration as the owner of the lots is incorrect, the decision was taken to consider the Petitioner"
"as an owner becomes null and void. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot seek a writ from this Court."
"The  Petitioner  must  come  with  clean  hands.  In  this  instance,  Petitioner  knew  he  had  been"
"identified as an unlawful occupier according to the Gazette he produced to this Court marked"
"as P8. Without first clearing this position at a proper forum, he cannot ask for the writs he had"
"prayed for. He should have gone before the appropriate Court to get a declaration regarding his"
