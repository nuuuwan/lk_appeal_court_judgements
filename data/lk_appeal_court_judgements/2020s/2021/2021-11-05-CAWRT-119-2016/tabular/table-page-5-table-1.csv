"""Where an acquiring officer makes a decision on any claim or dispute under subsection (1) and"
"the claims, or dispute is not referred for a determination as provided in Section 3 the decision"
"shall be final""."
"Once the ownership is pronounced, it is mandatory to act under Section 17.  After the findings"
"of Section 10(1)(a), which became final, there cannot be a revival and come up with a new"
"finding.  If the  land  belonged to  the State, the publishing of  Section 7 notice in  the Gazette"
"extraordinary number 1817/4 dated 01.07.2013 was unnecessary. The Act of publishing in the"
"said  Gazette  by  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  and  officers  of  the  government  proves  that  for  all"
"purposes, these lands were considered not as state land but as private own land. Therefore, no"
"officer can now claim them as state lands."
"Lots 215 and lot 221 of the said Plan had been identified as privately held land. These two lots"
"are part of lot B2 of plan 810, and it is mandatory to explain how those two lots became private"
"land. The Respondents have at all times considered these lands as private lands until after the"
"Section 10(1)(a) decision was reached."
"The Respondents identified the owners on the strength of the surveyor General's Plan and the"
"tenement list. Lots 255, 264, 308 were identified as state land and the Petitioner as an unlawful"
"occupant. When the Gazette marked as P8 is perused, it is clear that it had referred to each lot"
"separately, indicating the owner and his staters to hold the lot. For example, the following lots"
"were described as"
"Lot 249 - Sunil Wijersthna"
"263 P Manel Wickramathilaja"
"265 W.P. Rupasinghe"
"According to the Petitioner, the document marked P9a, P9b, P9C, P9d are documents on which"
"the authorities had accepted him as the owner. The law does not permit state land to be owned"
"by any other form other than on a state grant. Even on prescription, one cannot claim a state"
"land. The land had been identified in the tenement list as state land. Therefore, it is clear that"
"the  officer  who  issued  documents  P9a  -  P9d  had  no  authority  to  pronounce  these  lands  as"
"privately owned land. The Petitioner who saw the Gazette identified his lands as State-owned"
"and him as an unlawful occupant. He should have objected and exercised his right to safeguard"
"his title at the time of this Gazette notification. It is settled law that an administrative error of"
"an officer will not give any right to the Petitioner."
