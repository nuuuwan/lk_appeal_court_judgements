"The objections were filed on behalf of the first and second respondents. They contended that"
"lots in question had been identified as state land. However, according to circular number 1 of"
"the Ministry of Highways, a decision had been taken to pay compensation to illegal occupants"
"of state lands who had made improvements. Lots 249, 250, 251, 253, 254, 255, 257, 258, 259,"
"and  262  of  the  Plan  3892  had  been  identified  by  the  chief  value  as  lots  that  had  not  been"
"improved, and therefore these lots will not be paid any compensation. Lots 222, 252, 260 and"
"263 of Plan No 3892 was identified as lots with some improvements; therefore, these lots will"
"be  paid  compensation.  After  an  enhancement  of  compensation  by  the.  LARC  Committee,"
"owners of those four lots, were paid and had already excepted the payment. The Respondent"
"further noted that the word owner was used inadvertently, and the correct word should have"
"been illegal occupants. Petitioner claims no compensation was paid to him at any time."
"Both  parties  filed  written  submissions  and  agreed  to  dispose  of  the  matter  on  the  written"
"submissions already filed."
"Petitioner stresses that Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued, and after an enquiry,"
"a  decision  was  made  in  terms  of  Section  10(1)  (a).  On  the  strength  of  the  findings  of  that"
"inquiry,  lots  255,  264,  265  and  308  plan  No.  3892  were  identified  as  lots  belonging  to  the"
