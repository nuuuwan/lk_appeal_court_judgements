"37. The relevant section 195 (e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of"
"1979  which  provides  for  the  calling  of  the  finger  prints  reports  reads  as"
"follows:"
"195. Upon the indictment being received in the High Court, the judge of"
"the High Court presiding in the sessions in the High Court holden in the"
"judicial zone where at the trial is to be held shall:"
"…"
"(e) Caused the accused to be finger-printed and forward the prints"
"to the Registrar of Finger Prints for examination and report to the"
"prosecuting State Counsel. (The emphasis is mine)…"
"38. The plain reading of the section is, in itself very much clear which needs no"
"further clarification. Therefore, it is expected that it is the prosecuting State"
"Counsel who should be in possession of the finger print report and not the"
"case record for obvious reasons."
"39. It is a basic principle of law that every accused person is presumed innocent"
"until proven guilty. As such, a trial judge's mind should not be allowed to be"
"tainted either way by having a finger print report of an accused person in the"
"case record before a person is found guilty or not guilty for that matter."
"40. Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that every High Court should"
"be mindful to direct the Registrar of Finger Prints to furnish his report to the"
"prosecuting Sate Counsel for his reference and not to the Registrar of the High"
"Court  as  per  the  current  practice.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  prosecuting  State"
"Counsel of the High Court to bring to the notice of the presiding High Court"
"judge of any previous convictions of an accused person when it is considered"
"at the appropriate stage for the purposes of sentencing."
