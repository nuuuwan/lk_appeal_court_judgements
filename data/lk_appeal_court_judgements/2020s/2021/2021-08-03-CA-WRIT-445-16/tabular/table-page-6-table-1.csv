"434 and directed water from the natural wewa to create the new corpus wewa that is"
"in issue in the instant application."
"It is also apparent from the document marked 2R4 that although the acquisition of"
"the land has been discussed, the 3rd Respondent has written to the 4th Respondent"
"stating  that  there  is no possibility  to  acquire  the  said  land  for a  wewa that  is not in"
"existence in the Plans and upon the mere request of an individual. He has however stated that"
"in the event that there is a request made by the Agrarian Development Department"
"any alternate land falling outside the Grants land may be released."
"In  any  event,  by  2R6  dated  03.04.2014,  the  Land  Ministry  clearly  determined  that"
"since the said wewa is enjoyed by an individual person, it is not feasible for them to"
"acquire the land without a public purpose. In the same document, the Ministry has"
"noted that, however, steps may be taken to be explore the possibility of obtaining the"
"consent of the Grant holder (i.e., the 10th Respondent) through whose land the wewa"
"is said to accumulate, on the promise of an alternative land to him. However, there is"
"no material before this Court to show that any such settlement is reached between"
"the parties."
"In view of the above, this Court further observed that the State still has not taken a"
"firm decision to demarcate the portion of the land included in the respective Grants"
"for the purposes of the wewa. The question whether the land should or should not be"
"acquired is one of policy to be determined by the relevant Minister [vide Gunasekara"
"vs. Minister of Lands and Agriculture (1963) 65 NLR 119] after carrying a careful"
"study. Therefore, this Court will not compel the State to acquire a land where the"
"policy decision has not been arrived to do so."
"The Petitioners have also premised this application on Legitimate Expectation2. They"
"submitted that in view of P-06, they are legitimately expecting that the said land will"
"be acquired for the purposes of constructing the said wewa."
"P-06  is  a  document  which  the  Petitioner  claim  is  a  resolution  of  a  meeting  of  the"
"District Land Use Planning Committee of Kurunegela to approve Proposal No. 829 of"
"2 Vide para 20 of the Petition."
