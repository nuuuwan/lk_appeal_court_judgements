"shift to the landowner to rebut that inference. Therefore, I cannot agree with the"
"submission of the  learned  Senior State Counsel that the Minister owes  no  duty to"
"prove  urgency,  and  that  the  duty  to  establish  there  was  no  urgency  is  with  the"
"Petitioners.”"
"T
he  issue  with  regard  to  the  burden  of  proof  has  been  conclusively  dealt  with  by  the"
"Supreme  Court  in  Horana  Plantations  Ltd  v.  Minister  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  Land"
"and 
Irrigation,8  where 
it  was  held  that  “No  doubt  primarily  the  Minister  decided"
"urgency. He it is who is in possession of the facts and his must be the reasoning. But the"
"Courts have a duty to review the matter.”"
"T
his  brings  me  back  to  the  submission  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  that"
"there is no urgency to take over possession of the land and that the decision to deprive"
"the Petitioner of the safeguards available under Section 4 is illegal and arbitrary."
"P
ursuant to ‘R5’, Sri Lanka Police has made a formal application dated 10th March 2016"
"marked 
‘R6’  seeking  the  acquisition  of  the 
land  that 
is  the  subject  matter  of  this"
"application. I have examined ‘R6’ and observe that Sri Lanka Police has been of the view"
"that  the  land  is  owned  by  the  Land  Reform  Commission.  This  is  erroneous  in  that  the"
"land  has  been  vested  in  the  6th  Respondent  and  has  thereafter  been  leased  to  the"
"Petitioner,  who 
is  carrying  out  a  successful 
rubber  cultivation  on 
the  said 
land."
"Furthermore, it has been pointed out in ‘R6’ that there is no other suitable land in the"
"said  area 
for 
the 
said  purpose  whereas 
the  Petitioner 
states 
that 
it  can  offer"
"unproductive land from the said Sorana Estate to Sri Lanka Police. In my view, the very"
"fact  that  the  standard  application 
form  that  must  be 
filled  by  an  entity  seeking"
"acquisition of private land requires such entity to specify if alternative land is available is"
"proof  that  the  availability  of  alternative 
land  for  the  proposed  public  purpose 
is  a"
"relevant factor in deciding whether the land identified should be acquired."
"T
he Section 2 notice having been published on 13th July 2016, it took over a year for the"
"Section  38  proviso  (a)  notice  to  be  published.  The  only  activity  that  took  place  during"
"that period was the surveying of the land on 18th August 2016. If there was an urgency"
"as claimed by the Respondents that required the jettisoning of the safeguards provided"
"8 [2012] 1 Sri LR 327."
