"Agriculture,4 where Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, referring to the above scheme of"
"the Act, stated as follows:"
"“The provisions of section 38 states that the Minister may by order published in the"
"Gazette ""at any time after the award is made under section 17” direct the acquiring"
"officer  to  take  possession  of  the  land  or  servitude  acquired,  as  the  case  may  be."
"Such an order is a vesting order and vests title in the State absolutely and free from"
"all  encumbrances  from  the  date  of  the  order.  It  must  be  noted  that  the  Minister"
"ordinarily  has  no  power  to  vest  the  land  in  the  State  until  an  award  is  made  in"
"terms of section 17 of the Act. Even though the market value is calculated as at the"
"date of the notice under section 7 the award can only be made after 21 days of the"
"date of the notice. If there is a reference to Court under the provisions of section 10"
"of the Act such award will be made at such later date (section 17). Whatever the"
"length of time the Act makes it clear that in the first place possession only be taken"
"after the award is made and  after the quantum of compensation offered is made"
"known to  the  claimants. Any vesting  order  made  before such  award  would  be an"
"act  in  excess  of  powers.  The  intention  of  the  legislature  is  clear,  i.e.,  that  the"
"officers of the State cannot take possession until and unless an offer of payment"
"of compensation is made and the acquisition proceedings are concluded. It is only"
"then that the Act recognises the State’s right to possession of the land."
