"Hence, if anyone is to say that this Court cannot look into the facts of  a"
"case in order to reach its decision on a stated case, it would be a fallacy."
"Section 10 (1) of the Ayurveda Act provides that any Ayurvedic hospital,"
"pharmacy, dispensary or store has to be registered with the Commissioner"
"of Ayurveda and that the person carrying on such an institution has to be"
"registered by the Commissioner as the proprietor thereof."
"The  Appellant  has  produced  two  Certificates  of  Registration  of  their"
"Ayurvedic  Centre  as  a  ‘Private  Ayurvedic  Services  Institution’,  said  to"
"have been issued in accordance with the provisions of the Ayurveda Act."
"These two certificates are issued in the name of the Managing Director of"
"Ranweli Holiday Village Ltd. (from 8th October 2008 to 7th October 2009)"
"and in the name of Dr. (Mrs.) Deepani Amarasinghe (from 21st December"
"2011  to  20th  December  2012  in  the  Sinhalese  Copy).  According  to  the"
"English  Copy  of  the  latter  certificate,  the  validity  period  is  from  22nd"
"December 2011 to 21st December 2012, thus showing a day’s difference."
"The Sinhalese copy has been issued on 1st November 2012, whereas the"
"English  copy  mentions  two  dates,  namely  1st  November  2012  and  22nd"
"December 2011 (at pages 186 and 187 of the brief)."
"Further, 
the  Department  of  Ayurveda  has 
issued  a 
letter  dated  3rd"
"November 
2012, 
addressed 
to  Dr. 
(Mrs.)  Deepani  Amarasinghe,"
"confirming  that  ‘Aruna  Ranweli  Ayurvedic  Medical  Centre’  had  been"
"providing 
‘Panchakarma’ 
treatment  on  an  agreement  with 
‘Ranweli"
"Holiday Village Ltd’, from 24th September 2010 and that an application for"
"the  registration  of  the  former  had  been  made  on  8th  November  2010."
"However, the Department of Ayurveda had failed to conduct an inspection"
"until  22nd  December  2011,  and  following  said  inspection  has  issued  the"
"registration for both the years 2011 and 2012."
"I  observe  that  the  TAC  in  dealing  with  the  certificates  has  erroneously"
"considered  the  period  covering  the  certificate  issued  in  the  name  of  Dr."
"(Mrs.)  Deepani  Amarasinghe  as  being  from  21st  December  2009  to  20th"
"December 2011, whereas it was in fact from 21st December 2011 to 20th"
"December 2012."
"According to the aforesaid letter of the Department of Ayurveda (dated 3rd"
