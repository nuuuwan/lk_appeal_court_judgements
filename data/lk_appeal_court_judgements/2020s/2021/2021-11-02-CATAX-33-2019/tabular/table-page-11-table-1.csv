"The Respondent has produced four agreements entered into between itself"
"and the two doctors namely, Dr. (Mrs.) Herath and Dr. (Mrs) Amarasinghe."
"The first agreement is with Dr. (Mrs.) Herath from 1st June 2008 to 31st"
"May 2009. This agreement covers the first two months of the taxable period"
"relevant to this appeal. The second agreement is also with Dr. (Mrs.) Herath"
"for the seven months from  1st June 2009 until 31st December 2009. The"
"third agreement, also with the same doctor, is for the three months from 1st"
"January 2010 to 31st March 2010. The fourth agreement is with Dr. (Mrs.)"
"Amarasinghe 
for 
the  3  years 
from  24th  September  2010  until  24th"
"September 2013."
"It appears to me that, out of the taxable period relevant to the instant case,"
"5 months and 23 days from 1st April 2010 to 23rd September 2010 are not"
"covered by these four agreements. However, there is a stated income from"
"the Ayurvedic Centre for the months of April, July, August and September"
"2010  (at  page  85  of  the  brief).  Whatever  penal  consequences  may  arise"
"from this anomaly are not for this Court to consider for the purposes of the"
"present appeal."
"The  Respondent  has  acknowledged  this  gap  in  the  agreements  in  its"
"submissions to the TAC.  Be that as it may, this was not an issue before"
"either the CGIR or the TAC. Hence, the CGIR and the TAC appear to have"
"proceeded on the basis that the Ayurvedic Centre has continued to operate"
"during the  said period as well. However, should this Court find that the"
"Respondent is indeed eligible for the tax exemption claimed, this period of"
"5 months and 23 days would have to be excluded from the said exemption,"
"as  there  does  not  appear  to  be  a  professionally  qualified  person  either"
"running 
the  Ayurvedic  Centre  or  engaged  by 
the  Centre 
to  provide"
"healthcare services."
"According to the agreements, in summary, the Respondent has agreed to"
"provide the premises consisting of different units of the Ayurvedic Centre,"
"along  with 
electricity,  water, 
furniture, 
cleaning 
and  maintenance"
"(housekeeping) services. Furthermore, the Respondent has undertaken to"
"provide accounting services with the preparation of bills, collecting income"
"and banking services."
"The  doctors  have  agreed  to  provide  professional  ayurvedic  consultancy"
"services by themselves or through a professionally qualified government"
"registered person. The Ayurvedic therapists were also to be employed by"
