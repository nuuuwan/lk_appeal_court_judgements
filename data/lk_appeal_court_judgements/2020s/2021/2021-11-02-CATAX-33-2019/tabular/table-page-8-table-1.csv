"to be registered as such under the Act, and that since the Appellant in that"
"case was classified as an “Institute of Private Ayurvedic Services”, it was"
"not liable for prosecution in any event.7"
"The TAC (at page 9 of its determination) has come to the conclusion that"
"the Ayurvedic Centre operated by the Respondent in the present appeal is"
"a ‘dispensary’ within the meaning of Section 10 (1) of the Ayurveda Act,"
"in spite of the fact that this Centre too had been issued with certificates of"
"registration  identifying  it  as  an  ‘Institute  of  Private  Ayurvedic  Service’."
"The  term  ‘dispensary’  is  interpreted  in  Section  89,  the  interpretation"
"section of the said Act. Accordingly, ‘dispensary’ means:"
"any premises  (howsoever described) used or intended to be"
"used  for  the  outdoor  treatment  of  persons  suffering  from"
"illness, but does not include a pharmacy (emphasis added)"
"Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  TAC  has  relied  on  the  phrase  ‘howsoever"
"described’, in deeming the Appellant’s Ayurvedic Centre to fall within the"
"category of ‘dispensary’, though it has not explicitly been identified as such"
"by  the  Department  of  Ayurveda.  I  find  that  there  is  some  merit  in  this"
"conclusion of the TAC, even though the phrases ‘outdoor treatment’ and"
"‘suffering from illness’ are open to interpretation. Certainly, it would be"
"absurd to hold that every person who desires an ayurvedic massage, which"
"in  its  natural  meaning  would  indeed  constitute  a  ‘healthcare  service’,"
"‘suffers  from  illness’.  It  is  also  unclear  whether  the  phrase  ‘outdoor"
"treatment’  was  meant  to  encompass  all  treatments  that  do  not  involve"
"inpatients."
"Nevertheless, it is immaterial whether or not the Ayurvedic Centre located"
"within the Respondent’s premises falls within the meaning of ‘dispensary’"
"for the purposes of registration under Section 10 (1) of the Ayurveda Act."
"As adverted to previously, this Court has already held in Herbal Holidays"
"that a requirement of registration cannot be read into item (xii) of paragraph"
"(b) of Part II of the First Schedule to the VAT Act."
"However, it must be observed that the meaning of ‘medical institution’ may"
"thus  be  extended too far,  where there  is no objective basis to determine"
"what does and does not qualify as a medical institution. Fortunately, in the"
"context of the present appeal, Section 69 (3) of the Ayurveda Act makes it"
