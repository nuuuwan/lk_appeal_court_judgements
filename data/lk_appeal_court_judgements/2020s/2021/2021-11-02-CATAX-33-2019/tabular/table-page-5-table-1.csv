"since the Assessors make their assessments based on these guidelines, a"
"tribunal or court may consider them in arriving at its own conclusion."
"The TAC has also considered the letter written by the CGIR to the Director"
"General of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (at page 189 of the brief)"
"regarding the tax implications of ayurvedic treatments provided by hotels."
"This letter refers to the same Rulings as above, and it is stated therein that"
"if  the  conditions  set  out  in  the  said  Rulings  are  satisfied,  ayurvedic"
"treatment provided by hotels  will be exempted from VAT  liability. It is"
"also stated that a General Ruling cannot be issued on this matter."
"Hence, it is clear that a decision on VAT liability has to be made on a case"
"by case basis, considering facts and circumstances of each case."
"Item No. 8 of the case stated to this Court by the TAC states that the TAC"
"made its determination to the effect that Ranweli Ayurvedic Centre, owned"
"by  Ranweli  Holiday  Village  Ltd.,  is  a  ‘medical  institution’  within  the"
"meaning of the VAT Act and therefore, it is entitled  to VAT exemption"
"under the Act. Hence, it is obvious that in deciding the case stated to this"
"Court, the Court has to consider the facts relevant to the said finding."
"It  is  trite  law  that  the  consideration  of  whether  the  available  facts  are"
"sufficient to arrive at a conclusion, constitutes a question of law.3"
"In the volume titled Income Tax In Sri Lanka, Gooneratne states that:4"
"‘The principle is well established that where a tribunal arrives at a finding"
"which is not supported by evidence the finding though stated in the form of"
"a finding of fact is a finding which involves a question of law. The question"
"of law is whether there was evidence to support the finding, apart from the"
"adequacy of the evidence. The Court will interfere if the finding has been"
"reached without any evidence or upon a view of facts which could not be"
"reasonably entertained. The evidence can be examined to see whether the"
"Board  [being  the  Board  of  Review;  the  predecessor  of  the  TAC]  being"
"properly appraised of what they had to do could reasonably have arrived"
"at the conclusion they did.’"
