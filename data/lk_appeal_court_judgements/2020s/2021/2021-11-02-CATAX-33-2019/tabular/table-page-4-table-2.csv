"VAT Act, including the three terms mentioned above, are elaborated. In"
"my view, those definitions are mere guidelines issued to the Department of"
"Inland Revenue and are not binding on any tribunal or court.2 Nevertheless,"
"2 Section 74 of the VAT Act enacts that: “The Commissioner-General may from time to time specify the"
"forms to be used for all or any of the purposes of this Act, and any form so specified may from time to"
"time be amended or varied by the Commissioner-General or some other form may be substituted by the"
"Commissioner-General in place of any form so specified.”. However, the CGIR’s interpretation of the"
"meaning of terms found in the VAT Act (for the internal purposes of the Department of Inland Revenue)"
"cannot be given statutory force through Section 74."
