"In the Solicitor General v Nadarajah Muthurajah 79 (1)  NLR  63 it was held:"
"“…that an appellate court has the power to review at large the evidence upon"
"which the  order of acquittal was founded and  to reverse that decision having"
"given  due  weight    to  the  opinion  of  the  trial  judge.  A  court  is  justified  in"
"interfering with the lower court’s decision  where there is no question of the"
"credibility of witnesses, but the sole question is the proper inference to be"
"drawn from specific fact.”"
