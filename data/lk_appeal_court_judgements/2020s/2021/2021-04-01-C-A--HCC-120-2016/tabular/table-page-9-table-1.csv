"person named Nilanthi that the deceased was referring to is in fact, the wife of the accused"
"and no one else."
"Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the prosecution has not identified or established"
"with  cogent  evidence,  the  person  named  Nilanthi  who  was  having  an  affair  with  the"
"deceased.  Merely  stating  that  the  deceased  was  having  an  affair  with  Nilanthi  does  not"
"establish that it is the same person who is married to the accused. Careful perusal of the"
"evidence  adduced  reveals  that  there  is  absolutely  no  evidence  to  establish  the  nexus"
"between  Nilanthi  referred  to  by  the  deceased  and  Nilanthi  the  wife  of  the  accused."
"Therefore, I am of the view that there is no evidence established beyond reasonable doubt"
"that the person called Nilanthi the deceased has been referring to, has any connection to"
"the accused in this case."
"In Queen vs Sumanasena 66 NLR 351 it was held that;"
"“…. suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt nor does the proof of"
"any  number  of  suspicious  circumstances  relieve  the  prosecution  of  its"
"burden of proving the  case against the accused beyond reasonable  doubt"
"and compel the accused to give or call evidence….”"
"In  Iyamperumel  Ashokumar  Vs.  The  Attorney  General  (2010  III  ACJ  15)  (CA"
"167/07)  decided on 23.08.2010, their Lordships’ held “that it is trite law that suspicious"
"circumstances, even if  it amounts to a large number, do not establish guilt. Nor does the"
"proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relive the prosecution of its burden of"
"proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt”."
"It  appears  that  the  learned  trial  judge    inferred  that  the  reference  to  ‘Nilanthi’  as"
"stated in the dying declaration referred to the wife of the accused, without any cogent or"
"substantial evidence."
