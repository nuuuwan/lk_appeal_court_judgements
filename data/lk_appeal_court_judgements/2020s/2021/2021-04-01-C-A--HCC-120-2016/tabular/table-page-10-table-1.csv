"The witnesses to the dying declaration were unaware of the existence of a person"
"called ‘Nilanthi’ with whom the deceased had a relationship. It is my considered opinion"
"that  merely  mentioning  that  the  person  who  assaulted  was  Nilanthi’s  husband  does  not"
"suffice to justify an inference that it was the accused who assaulted the deceased."
"As there is no conclusive proof that Nilanthi who was referred to by the deceased is"
"the wife of the accused I  hesitate to agree with the conclusion of the trial judge. Therefore,"
"I am of the view that  it is not safe to act on the dying declaration made to three witnesses,"
"to come to a finding that  the person called Nilanthi  referred to by the deceased, is the wife"
"of the accused, when that fact has not been established beyond reasonable doubt."
"Another issue to be considered is, whether there was a positive identification of the"
"accused appellant as the person who inflicted the injuries to the deceased. The indictment"
"refers to the accused and two others who are unknown to the prosecution. Only PW 1 had"
"identified the accused as one of the 3 people who were with clubs. PW 2 who was with PW"
"1 at the same place was unable to identify the accused, the reason being the distance that"
"he saw the three people. It can be presumed that the eye sight of people may vary from"
"person to person."
"However, considering the background to the holding of the Identification Parade,"
"that is the appellant being in open court and thereafter, in the cell for over one and half"
"hours, on an inquiry date where it is safe to assume that interested parties to the case may"
"be present  in Court.   The only evidence is  Police witness stating  that the witnesses and"
"other interested parties were not present in Court when the appellant surrendered himself"
"to Court. That day being a day the case was scheduled to be called the non availability of"
"the witnesses has not been established by the prosecution. Therefore, in the absence of any"
"material evidence of this factual position, I am cautious to rely on the identification by PW"
"1 of the accused at the Identification Parade."
"10"
