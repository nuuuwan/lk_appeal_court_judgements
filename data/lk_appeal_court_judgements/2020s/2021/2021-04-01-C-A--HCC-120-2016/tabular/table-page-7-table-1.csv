"At the hearing of the appeal, the Counsel for the accused-appellant submitted that"
"the prosecution has not established  beyond reasonable doubt, that the person referred to as"
"‘Nilanthi’  by the deceased, is the wife of the appellant."
"It is trite law that the burden is always on the prosecution to prove the case against"
"the accused appellant beyond reasonable doubt."
"One of the main issues for consideration is the identification of Nilanthi, referred to"
"by the deceased."
"It is apparent that the witnesses who gave evidence of the dying declaration did not"
"know any of the parties personally. That is the deceased, Nilanthi or the accused appellant."
"They have without any reservation testified what they were told by the deceased who is a"
"stranger to them. No evidence has surfaced that they are partisan witnesses."
"The evidence of the police officer PW 7 in pages 144 and 145 of the brief is that"
"from his investigation he was satisfied that the accused is the husband of Nilanthi to whom"
"the deceased had referred. But there is no cogent evidence submitted   by the prosecution"
"to establish that fact."
