"1. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with"
"all the  proved facts. If  it  does  not,  then  the  inference"
"cannot be drawn."
"2

"reasonable inference from them, save the one to be drawn."
"If they had not excluded the other reasonable inferences,"
"then there must be a doubt whether the inference sought"
"to be drawn is correct."
