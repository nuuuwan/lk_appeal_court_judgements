"Dhammika Ganepola, J."
"The Petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Writ of"
"Certiorari to quash the quit notice issued in terms of the Government Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969, marked as P5 to the Petition. Both"
"parties  agreed  to  get  the  argument  disposed  by  way  of  written  submissions."
"Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several"
"connected  matters  that  were  taken  up  together  with  this  matter.  The  court"
"observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that"
"he was a sailor attached to Sri Lanka Navy and that while he was serving the Sri"
"Lanka Navy, he was provided a house in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay,"
"Trincomalee, upon a Lease Agreement P3 entered into between the Petitioner"
"and the Food Commissioner. The Petitioner states that he has complied with all"
"terms  and  conditions  of  the  said  agreement  including  payment  of  rent.  The"
"Petitioner 
further  claims 
that  once 
the  war  came 
to  an  end, 
the  Food"
"Commissioner took steps to recover the possession of the said house and that as"
"a  pretext  to  such  move,  refused  to  accept  rent.  Subsequently,  the  Food"
"Commissioner  had 
instituted  proceedings  against  the  Petitioner  before  the"
"Magistrate 
â€˜s  Court  of  Trincomalee 
in  terms  of  the  Government  Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act and the same had been later withdrawn. Thereafter,"
"the  Respondent  has  issued  the  purported  quit  notice  dated  18.02.2019  (P5)"
"against the Petitioner demanding him to hand over the vacant possession of the"
"said  premises  alleged  that  the  Petitioner  has  acted 
in  breach  of  the  Lease"
"Agreement. 
In  spite  of  such  circumstances, 
the  Petitioner  has  made 
this"
"application before this Court moving for a  Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit"
"notice  marked  P5  stating  that  the  purported  quit  notice  is  bad  in  law  for  the"
"reasons mentioned below."
