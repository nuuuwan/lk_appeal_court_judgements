"the  2nd  Respondent,  it  is  relevant  that  on  22.03.2015,  the  2nd  Respondent  has  lost  the"
"possession.  The  next  important  fact  which  the  learned  Magistrate  had  to  consider  was"
"whether the 2nd Respondent had been dispossessed from the exclusive possession of the"
"hotel or from a room of the hotel. If there has been evidence that the 2nd Respondent had"
"been dispossessed by the 1st Respondent from the hotel, the determination of the learned"
"Magistrate should be that the 2nd Respondent is entitled to the exclusive possession of the"
"hotel and if the evidence has been that he had been dispossessed from a room of the hotel"
"the determination should be that he is entitled to the possession of that particular room."
"To establish the position of the 2nd Respondent that he was in exclusive possession of the"
"hotel  till  22.03.2015.  from  10.02.2015.  he  has  relied  on  “2  පා  5”  which  is  an  informal"

"correctly held that the authenticity and the execution of “2 පා 5” document has not been"
"proved and therefore, that document should not be considered when determining the rights"
"of the parties."
"In addition to the document marked as “2 පා 5”, the 2nd Respondent has tendered a copy of"
"a police complaint dated 13.03.2015. made against a lady alleging that she is occupying a"
"room in the hotel without paying the hotel charges. The 1st Respondent also has tendered a"
"copy of a police complaint dated 18.03.2015. which has also been lodged against a lady"
"alleging that she is staying in a room of the hotel without paying hotel charges. Further, the"
"2nd  Respondent  has  tendered  a  police  statement  dated  16.03.2015.  made  by  him  which"
"states that after he took over the possession of the hotel on 10.02.2015, he continued to"
"obtain the services of the 1st Respondent’s brother, Amarasena as the manager of the hotel"
"and for the reason that Amarasena had cheated on him he asked Amarasena on 14.03.2015."
