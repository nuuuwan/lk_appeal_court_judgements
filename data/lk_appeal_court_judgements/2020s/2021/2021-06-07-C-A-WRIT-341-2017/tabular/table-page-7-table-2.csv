"citing  the  case  of  Jayasinghe  v  The  National  Institute  of  Fisheries  and  Nautical"
"Engineering (NIFNE) and Others4 has held as follows:"
"“The  conduct  of  the  petitioner  in  withholding  these  material  facts  from  Court"
"shows  a  lack  of  uberrimae  fides  on  the  part  of  the  petitioner.  When  a  litigant"
"makes  an  application  to  this  Court  seeking  relief,  he  enters  into  a  contractual"
"obligation with the Court. This contractual relationship requires the petitioner to"
"disclose all material facts correctly and frankly. This is a duty cast on any litigant"
"seeking relief from Court.”"
