"84] 
In  Ranasinghe  v  Premananda  1985 
(1)  Sri  LR  63  at  70,  where"
"Sharvananda C.J.  observed that:"
"“The  rationale  of  the  above  principle  appears  to  be  that  a  defendant"
"cannot  approbate  and 
reprobate. 
In 
cases  where 
the  doctrine  of"
"approbation and reprobation applies, the person concerned has a choice"
"of two rights, either of which he is at liberty to adopt, but not both. Where"
"the  doctrine  does  apply, 
if 
the  person 
to  whom 
the  choice  belongs"
"irrevocably and with full knowledge accepts the one he cannot afterwards"
"assert the other; he cannot affirm and disaffirm. Hence a defendant who"
"denies tenancy cannot consistently claim the benefit of the tenancy which"
"the Rent Act provides. For the protection of the Rent Act to be invoked the"
"relationship of landlord and tenant, between the plaintiff and him which"
"is governed by the Rent Act should not be disputed by the defendant”."
