"We decide that the learned High Court judge has not erred in law in fixing this case for trial in"
"absentia as the necessary summons have been served and it is vital to meet the ends of justice."
"It  was  decided  in  King  v  Geekiyanage  John  Silva  46  NLR  73,  ""In  a  circumstance  in  which  an"
"accused  does  not  give  any  explanation  to  the  allegation  made  against  him, 
it  could  be"
"construed that the particular charges have been proved."""
"The guilt of the accused is further established by his mother paying a visit to the victim-child at"
"the  hospital  and  making  no  objections  against  the  allegations  against  her  son.  How  the  child"
"had given the evidence proved the accountability and truth of her description as she explains"
"the  raw  facts  in  her  minor  expressions  and  jargon  to  the  best  of  her  ability.  The  wife  of  the"
"accused states in evidence that the accused did not come with the victim-child to see her. The"
"Mother  also  clearly  observed  that  her  daughter's  hair  had  been  dishevelled  and  she  looked"
"dazed.  This  puts  the  accused-appellant  in  a  compromised  position  regarding  his  actions  and"
"was unable to provide a reasonable explanation for such."
"On perusal of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it is stark that the trial judge had"
"considered and evaluated all the material evidence that had been led before him at the trial."
"There  is  no  ground  either  in  law  or  fact  to  allow  this  appeal.  Hence,  the  appeal  should  be"
"dismissed."
"The prosecution raised a preliminary objection saying that the judgment has been delivered by"
"the  High  Court  of  Kalmunai on  19.02.2010.  Thus,  an  appeal  should  be  filed  within 14  days  of"
"the  judgment  but  the  appeal  had  been  filed  only  on  02.11.2016.  In  lieu  of  this  the  learned"
"counsel  for  the  respondent  submitted  that  the  appeal  should  be  dismissed  without  going"
"through the merits of the case."
"In  the  case  of  Padmasiri  v.  Attorney  General,  2012  (1)  SLR 29  it  was  held,  ""...if  we  allow  this"
"application it would amount to condescending or, the court lending its hand to a person who is"
"guilty of contumacious conduct and thereby assisting him""."
"We  believe  that  the  discretionary  power  of  this  court  invoking  the  revisionary  jurisdiction"
"should not be used in a situation of this sort. Therefore, we hold that the petition of appeal is"
"not properly constituted and is out of time. The Appellant had absconded court proceedings."
"Thus, according to Athukorala v Swaminathan 41 NLR 165 and Silva V. Silva 44 NLR 494, ""The"
"court  must  necessarily  have  regard  to  the  unreasonable  delay  and  contumacious  conduct  of"
"the accused.”"
"Finally, 
it 
is 
important  to  note  that  the  application  made  by  the 
learned  counsel  for  the"
"accused-appellant to send this case for a re-trial. Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act, states that there must be a “failure of justice” to request a case to be sent for re-trial. It is"
"our  view  that 
in  this  situation  there  had  not  been  any  failure  of  justice,  as  the  accused-"
"appellant was absconding to evade the case against him and left the country without informing"
"even his sureties."
"In  ""Warangoda  Nanda  Ratnasuriya  v  Attorney  General  CA.58/2005  decided  on  19.12.2008,  it"
"was held that,  ""The decision to  order  a  re-trial  should  very  much  depend upon  to  satisfy  the"
"ends of justice. Furthermore, the court held four grounds that the judge must consider when"
"deciding a particular case to be sent for re-trial or not. The four grounds are as follows;"
