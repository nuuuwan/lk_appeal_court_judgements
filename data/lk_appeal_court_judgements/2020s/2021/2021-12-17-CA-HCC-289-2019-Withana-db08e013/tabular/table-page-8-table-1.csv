"","“…The answer to the question raised seems to me to depend on"
"","the interpretation of sections 181 and 182 of the Criminal Procedure"
"","Code. Section 182 is the only relevant section, in the circumstances"
"","of  this  case,  that  can  be  advanced,  as  enabling  a  Court,  when  an"
"accused","is  charged  with  one  offence,  to  convict  him  of  another"
"","offence,  although  he  was  not  specifically  charged  with 
it, 
if 
it"
"","appears from the evidence that he might have been charged with it."
"But 
the  scope  of","this  section 
is  expressly 
limited 
to  ""the  case"
"","mentioned in the preceding section"". …"
"","…The  illustration  appended  to  this  section  shows  that  the  different"
"","offences contemplated are cognate offences, and it is doubtful which"
"","of these acts or series of acts may, ultimately, be found to constitute."
"","This section, however, postulates a case in which a doubt arises from"
"","the  nature  of  the  fact  or  series  of  facts  and  not  from  a  failure  to"
"","appreciate  the  value  of  unambiguous  facts  or  from  an  inaccurate"
"","view of the position in law arising from those facts. …”"
