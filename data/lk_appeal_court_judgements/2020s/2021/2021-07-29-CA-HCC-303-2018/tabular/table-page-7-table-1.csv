"All the arguments about the identification of the appellant could have been correct if the"
"appellant was a complete stranger to the witnesses prior to the incident.  There was no"
"allegation that PW1 or PW2 had given false evidence.  The argument was that PW1 and"
"PW2 could have made a mistake in identifying the appellant.   This argument cannot be"
"sustained in view of the above evidence."
"There  are  no  discrepancies 
that  affect  the  credibility  and  trustworthiness  of  the"
"witnesses."
"The  order  of  the 
learned  Trial  Judge  to  keep  PW1 
in  the  custody  of  a  home  was"
"inappropriate.  However,  as  I  mentioned  above,  PW1  had  identified  the  appellant  and"
"described the incident before she was sent to a home to be present in the Court on the"
"following day."
"The proviso to section 334(1} of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states: -"
"'Provided  that  the  court  may,  notwithstanding  that  it  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  point"
"raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it"
"considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.'"
"In the case of Mannar Mannan V. The Republic of Sri Lanka 1987 (2) S.L.R94 it was held"
"that  the  purpose  of  the  proviso  is  to  prevent  appeals  being  allowed  on  the  basis  of"
"technicality,  regardless  of  whether  prejudice  has  been  caused  or  not  to  an  accused"
"person."
"Although  the 
learned  trial  Judge  had  made  this 
inappropriate  order,  the  evidence"
"establishes  the  charge  against the  accused-appellant.  The  Court  of  appeal,  in terms  of"
"proviso to section 334 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act has the power to affirm a"
"conviction."
"Therefore, I hold that there was no miscarriage of justice.  The prosecution has proved"
"the case beyond a reasonable doubt."
