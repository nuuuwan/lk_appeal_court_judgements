"For the above reasons, I refuse to interfere with the judgment of the learned trial Judge"
"and affirm the conviction."
"The appellant has no previous convictions. He is now over 60 years old. As he was unable"
"to supply bail money and find a surety, he had been languishing in remand custody for a"
"long period.  Considering the above facts, the punishment imposed for the second count"
"is reduced to ten years. The rest of the punishment is not changed."
"However, we direct all the sentences to run concurrently and are deemed to have been"
"served from the date of the conviction, namely 26/11/2018."
