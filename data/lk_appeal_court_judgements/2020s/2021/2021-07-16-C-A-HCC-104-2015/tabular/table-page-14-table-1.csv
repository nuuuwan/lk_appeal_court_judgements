"In his fifth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial"
"Judge  misdirected  himself  by  failure  to  observe  and  consider,  that  the"
"prosecution has failed to establish the time of death of the deceased which"
"is vital to prove the liability of the accused appellant since two different and"
"conflicting  versions  emerged 
in 
the  prosecution  case  and 
thereby 
the"
"conviction is unsafe and bad in Law."
"The PW01 in his evidence stated that when he accompanied the Appellant"
"to the place of incident after informing the incident, the deceased was still"
"alive  and  he  had  again  insisted  that  the  deceased  should  be  taken  to  the"
"hospital.  But  contrary  to  his  request  the  Appellant  had  opened  fire  and"
"dealt several blows with a Katty on the deceased and killed him. After that"
"the Appellant had told him that the deceased was dead and requested his"
"assistance  to  dispose  the  body.  According  to  PW01  the  time  was  around"

"Further,  the  doctor  who  had  performed  the  post-mortem  examination  on"
"03/01/2000  had  observed 
that 
the  dead  body  was  swollen  and  had"

"have died before his body was dumped into the water."
"Hence with the eye witnessâ€™s evidence and the medical evidence considered"
"above,  the  prosecution  has  clearly  proved  that  the  deceased  had  died  on"
"23/12/2000 around 6.30pm."
"In  the  final  ground  of  appeal,  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  Learned"
"Trial Judge misdirected himself while analysing the evidence by completely"
"failing  to  consider  the  Dock  Statement  of  the  accused  appellant  and  its"
"evidentiary  value  failed  to  afford  substance  of  a  fair  trial  and  adhere  to"
"established  Legal  principles  when  arriving  at  the  conclusion  of  convicting"
"the  accused  appellant  caused  Miscarriage  of  Justice  and
