"Even though, no necessity arises to corroborate the testimony of PW01 his"
"testimony  has  been  corroborated  not  only  by 
the  medical  and  police"
"evidence but also with other additional corroborative evidence."
"In  this  case  PW01  K.M.Wijetunga  is  an  eye  witness.  His  evidence  is  not"
"tainted with improbabilities or with any visible ambiguity. Therefore, acting"
"on PW01’s evidence will not prejudice the Appellants rights."
"In  his  second  ground  of  appeal  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  Learned"
"Trial Judge has misdirected himself by placing total reliability on the most"
"important  witness  Wijetunga  who  had  displayed  a  complete 
lack  of"
"creditworthiness  when 
defense 
counsel 
highlighted 
several  material"
"omissions  and  thereby  a  conviction  for  murder  is  not  safe  based  on  his"
"testimony."
"PW01  in  his  evidence  stated  that  when  he  saw  the  deceased  with  the  leg"
"injury,  he  had  dressed  up  the  wound  using  his  son’s  T-shirt.  But  the"
"defence highlighted this as an omission as the witness had not said this in"
"his statement to police."
"The second omission highlighted is that the failure to inform police that he"
"went  in  search  of  a  tractor  after  leaving  the  two  children  at  the  place  of"
"incident."
"The  third  omission  highlighted  is  that  the  failure  to  testify  in  the  non-"
"summary inquiry that the Appellant had struck the deceased with the butt"
"of the gun."
"The fourth omission highlighted is that the failure to inform the police that"
"the Appellant had suggested to dispose the dead body as the deceased had"
"passed away."
"The  fifth  omission  highlighted  is  that  the  failure  to  inform  the  police  that"
"the Appellant had struck the deceased’s body with a Katty."
