"510; and (j) the Judge should endeavour to assist the Jury by examining"
"the case against each of the co-accused in the light of these principles."""
"In  Wilson  Silva  vs.  the  Queen  76  NLR  414,  Weeramantri  J  stated  the"
"following:"
"""It was necessary to warn the Jury that even if there was a simultaneous"
"attack in pursuance of similar intentions this would not satisfy the test"
"of  common  intention  unless  there  was  a  sharing  of  the  intention.  The"
"Jury  had,  however,  been  placed  on 
their  guard  not  against  such"
"simultaneous  and  similar  attacks  but  against  separate  attacks  which"
"they may no doubt have thought were attacks separate in point of time."
"Separate  attacks  would  perhaps  have  been  distinguished  by  them  from"
"an attack in pursuance of common intention even without this direction"
"but the crucial distinction they should have had in mind was that even if"
"this was a simultaneous attack (rather than a series of separate attacks)"
"such attack should have been in consequence of a sharing of intentions"
"rather than in consequence of similar intentions individually entertained"
"by 
the  assailants.  The 
importance  of 
this  distinction  being  clearly"
"brought  home  to  the  Jury  has,  as  is  in  the  case  of  the  other  matters  I"
"have mentioned, been repeatedly stressed by this Court."""
"In King vs. Ranasinghe  47 NLR 373,  it was held that common intention"
"within the meaning of section 32 of the Penal Code is different from the"
"same or similar intention.  The inference of common intention should not"
"be  reached  unless 
it 
is  a  necessary 
inference,  deducible 
from 
the"
"circumstances of the case."
"In  this  case,  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  pre-arranged  plan  or  any  other"
"evidence  of  common 
intention  to  kill  the  deceased,  which  could  be"
"attributable to the appellant."
