"The  Learned  Senior  Additional  Solicitor  General 
for 
the  respondent"
"argues  that  as  the  appellant  has  done  nothing  to  prevent  the 
first"
"accused from inflicting the injuries and  the  appellant dealing a blow on"
"PW2,  facilitated  the  first  accused  to  kill  the  deceased.  Therefore,  this"
"shows that the appellant had the common intention to kill the deceased."
"At the same time, the Learned Additional Solicitor General concedes the"
"fact  that  the  appellant  had  not  inflicted  any  injury  to  the  deceased."
"Further, PW3 has also admitted that the first accused had completed the"
"assault on the deceased when the appellant arrived."
"This creates a ground of possibility for other inferences to be drawn from"
"the  above 
facts,  such  as 
the 
inference 
that 
the  appellant  did  not"
"participate  in  a  pre-arranged  plan  with  the  first  accused  to  murder  the"
"deceased.  Also,  when  looking  at  the  admission  of  PW3,  along  with  the"
"aforementioned  evidence  of  PW8,  it  shows  that  there  was  a  time  gap"
"between  the  assault  on  PW2  and  PW3  and  the  murder  of  the  deceased."
"This  creates  further  doubt  as  to  whether  a  pre-arranged  plan  existed"
"between the first accused and the appellant or whether  the first accused"
"was  acting  by  himself.  Consequently,  a  common  intention  cannot  be"
"attributed on the appellant."
"In  the  circumstances,  the  evidence 
is 
insufficient  to  prove  that  the"
"appellant shared a common intention to kill the deceased. Therefore, the"
"appellant  is  acquitted  of  count  one,  and  the  sentence  of  death  is  set"
"aside."
"However,  there  is  no  complaint  or  argument  regarding  the  conviction  of"
"count two and count three. Both PW2 and PW3 stated that the appellant"
"dealt  a  blow  on  them.  PW2 
fell  on  the  ground  unconscious  having"
"received the blow from the appellant. PW2 had eight injuries. One of the"
"injuries  was  sufficient  in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  to  cause  death."
"There  were  five  grievous  injuries.  PW3  was  also  hurt  by  the  appellant"
