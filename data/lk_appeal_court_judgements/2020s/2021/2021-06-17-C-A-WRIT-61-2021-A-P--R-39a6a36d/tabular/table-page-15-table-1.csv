"accepted, nothing flows from ‘P23’ for the reason that ‘P23’ is only an intimation of a"
"factual position that prevailed as at that date."
"T
he necessity for this Court to consider the third argument of the learned President’s"
"Counsel for the Petitioner that the Order ‘P24’ issued on 29th January 2021 is not in"
"conformity  with 
the  provisions  of  Section  66G  does  not  arise 
in  view  of 
the"
"conclusion that I have reached that there exists a vacancy in the office of Chairman."
"Furthermore,  the  requirement  that  the  next  Chairman  must  be  elected  within  six"
"weeks of the vacancy is only directory as Section 66G does not contain any sanctions"
"for not proceeding with the election within the said time period."
"T
he final argument of the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner was that the"
"1st Respondent cannot remove the Petitioner from office in terms of Section 185 of"
"the  Act  due  to  the  failure  to  adopt  the  budget.  The  necessity  to  consider  the  said"
"argument does not arise as ‘P21’ has been revoked."
"I
n  the  above  circumstances, 
I  see  no 
legal  basis  to 
issue  formal  notice  of  this"
"application  on  the  Respondents.  This  application  is  accordingly  dismissed,  without"
"costs."
