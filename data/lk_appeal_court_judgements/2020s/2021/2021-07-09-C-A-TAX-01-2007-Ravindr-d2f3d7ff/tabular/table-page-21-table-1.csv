"The Agreement – revisited"
"T
he only way this Court can determine the nature of the transaction is through the"
"documents  that  have  been  produced  by  the  Appellant,  to  which  I  have  already"
"referred to in detail, which establishes that there has been a change of ownership in"
"the shares of FWL."
"H
ere  was  an  arrangement  where  the  entire  shareholding  of  FWL, 
including  the"
"shares that the Appellant had acquired over a long period of time, was being sold to"
"a  Canadian  Company.  If,  as  claimed  by  the  Appellant,  no  money  was  coming  into"
"their  hands,  the  Appellant  was  going  to  risk  it  all  by  entering  into  an  arrangement"
"over which he had no control. If it was a true amalgamation, FWL as a Company and"
"the Appellant as a Director thereof would surely have carried out a feasibility study"
"of 
the  proposed  amalgamation  as  well  as  a  due  diligence  study  of 
the  said"
"arrangement  and  the  creditworthiness  of  TOC.  No  evidence  has  been  produced  by"
"the  Appellant  that  FWL  had  engaged  in  such  an  exercise,  nor  has  the  Appellant"
"produced the ‘Offer to Purchase’ document and the appendices thereto, which may"
"have shed light, either way"
"F
urthermore, 
an 
amalgamation  would 
have 
required 
the 
approval 
of 
the"
"shareholders of FWL by way of a shareholders resolution. While no such resolution"
"has been made available to the Board of Review, paragraph 6 of the Agreement by"
"which  the  Appellant  and  the  other  three  Continuing  Directors  have  undertaken  to"
"obtain  the  consent  of  the  other  shareholders  makes 
it  clear  that  there  was  no"
"resolution by the shareholders approving the above sale and purchase of shares."
"E
ven 
if  one  accepts  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  chose  to  take  all  the  risks,  the"
"Agreement  itself  does  not  contain  any  intention  on  the  part  of  TOC,  FWL  and  the"
"Appellant  to  carry  out  an  amalgamation  of  FWL  with  TOC  or  merger  of  the  two"
"companies. Having examined the said Agreement and the clauses thereof to which I"
"have already adverted to, it is clear to me that the said agreement is an agreement"
"for the sale and purchase of shares12 which resulted in the TOC being registered as"
"the owner of  the shares held by the  Appellant in the Register of FWL.  Nowhere in"
"the  agreement  does  it  contain  any  provision  that  suggests  a  blending  of  FWL  with"
"12Referred to as such in many paragraphs in the said Agreement: 3, 4, 8, 13(a)."
