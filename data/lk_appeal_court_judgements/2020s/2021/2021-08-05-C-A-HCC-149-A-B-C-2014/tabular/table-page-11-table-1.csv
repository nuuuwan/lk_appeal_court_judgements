"When applying the law to the facts stated above, the learned Judge of the High Court could"
"not have arrived at any other the conclusion rather than one that is in accordance with the"
"guilt  of  the  accused-appellants.  The  Toyota  Caravan  bearing  the  number  252-0121  which"
"was  the  subject  matter  of  robbery,  belonged  to  PW1  at  the  time  it  was  robbed,  which  he"
"had been using for over a year. Thus, he was familiar with the vehicle. There was a special"
"security light that he had fixed onto it. As stated above, PW4 was known to all four accused-"
"appellants and the fourth accused-appellant was his cousin."
"He admitted that he wrote the digit '8' on the number plate using his hand with paint and"
"the  vehicle  was  a  Toyota  Caravan.  At  the  time  the  vehicle  was  recovered  by  the  police,  it"
"was  observed  that  the  number  had  been  changed  from  0121  to  8121.  Therefore,  his"
"testimony  corroborated  the  evidence  of  PW1  and  further  confirmed  the  fact  that  both"
"witnesses were speaking about the same vehicle. PW4 stated that he saw this van with the"
"accused-appellants  somewhere  in  September  1999;  this  timeline  tallied  with  the  duration"
"the van remained missing."
"Ultimately,  the  van  was  recovered  from  the  possession  of  the  first,  second  and  third"
"accused-appellants on the 9th of September1999. It was revealed from the evidence of PW1"
"that the vehicle was last seen on the 2nd of September 1999 which was finally recovered by"
"the  police  on  the  9th  of  September  1999  from  the  possession  of  the  first,  second  and  the"
"third  accused-appellants.  Taking  the  entirety  of  the  evidence  into  consideration,  it  can  be"
"concluded that, the van that was used by the four accused-appellants and PW4 between the"
"2nd and the 9th of September 1999 was one and the same vehicle. Later, the police recovered"
"items  belonging  to  the  van,  i.e.  a  Sony  cassette  player,  speakers  and  fog  lights  on  the"
"statement of the fourth accused-appellant from a garage in Ratnapura."
