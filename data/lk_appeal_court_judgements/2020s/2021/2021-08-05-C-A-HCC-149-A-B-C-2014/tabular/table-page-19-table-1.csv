"The  counsel  for  the  first  and  second  accused-appellants  took  up  the  position  that  the"
"prosecution had failed to prove the identification of the corpus beyond reasonable doubt."
"The counsel was of the understanding that since the corpus was in a decomposed state PW1"
"was only able to identify it from the yellow colour underwear, which was different in colour"
"to what was taken into custody by the police."
"With  reference  to  what  had  been  stated  by  the  respondent,  at  the  examination-in-chief"
"PW1 had stated that he was able to identify the dead body of his son, the deceased from a"
"particular  pigmentation  on  the  skin.  This  evidence  was  not  challenged  by  the  defense  in"
"cross-examination with regard to the identity of the dead body. According to the evidence"
"of PW11, putrefaction had set in. However, he did not state that the corpus had putrefied to"
"the extent that it could not have been identified. PW11 in his evidence stated that the dead"
"body  was  duly  identified  before  the  post  mortem  examination,  which  evidence,  was  not"
"challenged  by  the  defense  and  it  was  never  suggested  to  either  of  the  witnesses  that  the"
"dead body had changed beyond recognition."
"On the question of whether the learned Judge of the High Court had flawed in refusing the"
"dock-statement  of  the  third  accused-appellant  on  a  wrong  footing,  what  the  accused-"
"appellant  had  stated  to  exculpate  himself  needs  to  be  looked  into.  The  third  accused-"
"appellant had flagrantly denied that he had gone to watch a musical show with the rest of"
"the accused-appellants in his dock statement and had not provided any other explanation."
"Moreover, the fact that the third accused-appellant had gone to the said musical show had"
"been established by the prosecution via the evidence given by PW4 and the said evidence"
"hadnâ€™t been challenged by the defense in any significant way."
"The law pertaining to evaluation of dock-statements is examined below. A dock-statement,"
"though considered as evidence, is subjected to the infirmity that it was not given under oath"
"and thus cannot be subject to cross-examination."
"In The Queen Vs. Buddharakkitha Thera and 2 Others [1962] [63 NLR 433], it had been held"
"that,"
