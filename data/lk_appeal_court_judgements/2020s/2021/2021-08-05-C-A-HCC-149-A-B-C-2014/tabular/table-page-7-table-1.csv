"convictions and"
"2.
the infirmities in the judgment of the learned Judge of the High Court."
"The question that seems to be of paramount importance is, whether the accused-appellants"
"were convicted by the learned Judge of the High Court based on adequate evidence, since"
"the conviction entirely hinges on circumstantial evidence."
"The 
learned  counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of 
the 
first  and  second  accused-appellants"
"submitted that the sole conviction of the said accused-appellants were based on three items"
"of  evidence,  namely,  the  evidence  that  the  accused-appellants  were  taken  into  custody"
"when 
they  were  attempting 
to 
flee  which  was  contradictory  when  considering 
the"
"testimonies of PW1 and the police, the evidence as to whether the first accused-appellant"
"was seen with the van that had been robbed prior to the date of arrest, as regards which,"
"the  counsel  stated  that  the  evidence  was  not  clear  as  to  that  fact  and  as  to  whether  the"
"witnesses of the prosecution were referring to the same van."
"The  evidence  which  indicated  that  the  number  of  the  number-plate  of  the  van  had  been"
"altered, 
in  relation  to  which  the  counsel  argued  that,  the  evidence  of  PW4  had  not"
"suggested that the number “0” was changed to number “8”, the altered number plate was"
"neither  produced  nor  identified  by  this  witness  and  that  the  evidence  of  PW1  and  PW4"
"contradict on the fact of whether the numbers of the number-plate at the front or the rear"
"had been altered."
"The  counsel  for  the  third  accused-appellant  asserted  that,  the  evidence  pertaining  to  a"
"single instance of the third accused-appellant running away from the van in question at the"
"time of his arrest did not support his conviction for murder."
"The counsel for the fourth accused-appellant reiterating the facts stated by the counsel for"
"the  first  second  and  third  accused-appellants  on  this  matter,  contended  that  there  hadn’t"
"been any evidence to say that the accused-appellants had asked PW4 to alter the number"
"plate  and  went  on  to  contend  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  erroneously"
"concluded that the accused-appellants had frequently travelled by the said van. In addition,"
"the counsel made lengthy submissions stating that,"
