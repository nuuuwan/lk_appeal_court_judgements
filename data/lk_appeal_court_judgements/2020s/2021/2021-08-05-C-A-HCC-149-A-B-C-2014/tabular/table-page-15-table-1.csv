"the courts from laying down any general guidelines regarding the situations in which"
"a  Court  may  be 
justified  on  drawing  a  presumption  under  section  114  of  the"
"Evidence  Ordinance.  When  a  trial  Judge  has  presumed  a  fact  under  section  114  of"
"Evidence Ordinance, it is the unenviable task of an appellate Court to examine the"
"validity of the trial Judge’s conclusion in the light of particular facts of the case.’"
"In the Indian case of Saundraraj v The State of Madya Pradesh; (1954) 55 Cr. L.J 257, it had"
"been held that,"
"‘in cases where murder and robbery were shown to be part of the same transaction,"
"recent 
and 
unexplained 
possession 
of 
stolen 
articles, 
in 
the 
absence 
of"
"circumstances tending to show that the accused was only a receiver, would not only"
"be  presumptive  evidence  on  the  charge  of  robbery  but  also  on  the  charge  of"
"murder.’"
"In  Cassim  v  Udaya  Mannar  (1943)  44  NLR  519,  Wijeyawardene  J  cited  with  approval  a"
"passage from Taylor on Evidence which laid out the following."
"‘The presumption is not confined to cases of theft but applies to all crimes even the"
"most  penal.  Thus  on  indictment  for  arson  proof  that  property  which  was  in  the"
"house at the time it was burnt, was soon afterwards found in the possession of the"
"prisoner  has  been  held  to  raise  a  probable  presumption  that  he  was  present  and"
"concerned 
in  offence.  A 
like 
inference  has  been  raised 
in  the  case  of  murder"
"accompanied by robbery, in the case of burglary and in the case of possession of a"
"quantity of counterfeit money.’ (12th Ed; para 142)"
"Owing to the above the learned Judge of the High Court had not erred in, applying the said"
"presumption 
to 
the 
instant  matter  before 
this  Court  and  accordingly,  convicting 
the"
"accused-appellants. Furthermore, since the accused-appellants had not made any attempt"
"to rebut the above presumption during the course of proceedings of the High Court, it can"
"be taken to have become invariably conclusive."
"Counsel  for  the  first,  second  and  fourth  accused-appellants  submitted  that  the  learned"
"Judge of the High Court had not considered the vital contradictions and omissions marked at"
"the trial. It was argued that, the evidence of PW1 and the police as to whether the accused-"
"appellants  were  arrested  with  the  robbed  van  or  not  were  contradictory,  PW1  and  PW4"
"gave contradictory evidence regarding whether the alteration of the number had been done"
"on  the  number  plate  at  the  front  or  the  rear  of  the  said  van,  the  evidence  of  PW1  was"
"contradictory to evidence of PW8 on how the police officers were clad when they had gone"
"to arrest the accused-appellants and that the evidence of the police in relation to when the"
"fourth  accused-appellant  was  arrested  were  contradictory. 
In  addition,  counsel  for  the"
"fourth accused-appellant asserted that PW3 had failed to mention in his statement to the"
"police about the missing wires in the recovered cassette player and that this and the above"
"evidence seep to the root of the case of the prosecution."
