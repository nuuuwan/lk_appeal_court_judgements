"investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit"
"rejection of the evidence as whole.’"
"Learned counsel for the third accused-appellant contended that the learned Judge of the"
"High Court had convicted the third accused-appellant since he provided no explanation"
"in  stating  that  he  was  not  a  party  to  the  robbery  and  murder.  The  counsel  was  of  the"
"view  that  the 
learned 
Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  applied  a  dictum  called  the"
"Ellenborough Dictum without specifying what it was and averred that such a dictum did"
"not  contain  in  the  case  of  Rex  Vs.  Cochrane  (1814)  (Gurneys  Reports  479)  and  is  not"
"known to law."
"Learned counsel for the fourth accused-appellant argued stating, that the learned Judge"
"of the High Court had erroneously applied the said dictum and in the absence of a strong"
"and  prima  facie  case  in  support  of  the  prosecution,  there  was  no  duty  cast  upon  the"
"fourth accused-appellant to provide explanation as to what happened to the deceased"
"after  the  said  deceased  was  said  to  have  been 
last  seen  with  the  fourth  accused-"
"appellant. The counsel further argued that this legal principle cannot be called to aid to"
"compensate 
the 
laxity,  negligence, 
ignorance  and 
lethargy  on 
the  part  of 
the"
"investigators and went on to assert that weaknesses in the case of the defense cannot"
"be used to benefit the case of the prosecution when the case of the prosecution against"
"the fourth accused-appellant was full of infirmities."
"In this contention, reference to this dictum is made below, which is encompassed in the"
"judgment delivered by Lord Ellenborough. The relevant section that is applicable in this"
"instance can be extracted thus."
"‘No  person  accused  of  crime  is  bound  to  offer  any  explanation  of  his  conduct  of"
"circumstances of suspicion which attach to him, but nevertheless, if he refused to do"
"so where a strong prima facie cases has been made out and when it is in his power"
"to offer evidence, if such exist in explanation of such suspicious appearances, which"
"would show them to be fallacious and inexplicable consistently with his innocence, it"
"is  a  reasonable  and  justifiable  conclusion  that  he  refrains  from  doing  so  only  from"
"the  conviction  that  the  evidence  so  suppressed  or  not  adduced  would  operate"
"adversely to his interest.’"
"Although  an  accused  has  the  right  to  remain  silent  and 
is  not  bound  to  offer  any"
"explanation as to his conduct, when confronted with a strong prima facie case against"
"him,  his  failure  to  do  so  would  amount,  the  evidence  that  had  been  led,  to  operate"
"adversely 
to  his 
interest. 
The 
third 
accused-appellant  had  not 
challenged 
the"
"incriminating evidence adduced against him at the trial. After the said accused-appellant"
"was  arrested  with  the  van  that  had  been  robbed  few  days  after  the  van  went  missing"
"whilst attempting to flee, had he wished to suggest that he was not a party to offences"
"explained  in  count  three  and  four  he  would  have  explained  his  conduct  to  Court.  He"
"owed an explanation to Court as to why the stolen van was in his possession soon after"
