"In  the  backdrop  of  the  evidence  which  proved  that  the  third  and  the  fourth  accused-"
"appellants were travelling in the stolen van and was in possession of the same with the"
"other  two  accused-appellants,  the  manner  in  which  they  came  into  possession  of  the"
"van without the deceased being present, ought to have been explained by the third and"
"the  fourth  accused-appellant,  hence  they  had  failed  in  that  regard,  they  were  fairly"
"presumed  to  have  committed  the  murder  of  the  deceased  along  with  the  other  two"
"accused-appellants with the common murderous intention in mind."
"In light of the facts and applicable legal principles peculiar to this matter in question, this"
"appeal has failed to hold any merit. The conviction therefore is affirmed and the appeal"
"dismissed."
