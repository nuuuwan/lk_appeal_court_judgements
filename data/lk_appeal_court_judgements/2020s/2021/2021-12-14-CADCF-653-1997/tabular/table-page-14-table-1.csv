"In these respects, this Court is of the considered view that the contention"
"of the 7th to 10th Defendants stating that the entirety of the subject matter"
"has not been shown in plan X is devoid of merits."
"I  shall  now  deal  with  the  claim  of  prescriptive  title  of  the  8th  and  9th"
"Defendants in respect of lot B in plan X."
"Indeed, these Defendants are co-owners of the subject matter. Generally,"
"one co-owner is in possession of common land on behalf of the other co-"
"owners. If a co-owner claims prescriptive title against other co-owners, it"
"is necessary to prove “ouster” in addition to the requirements set out in"
"section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871 (as amended)."
"In Corea v. Appuhamy [1911] 15 NLR 65, it was held that,"
