"Appeal bearing No. CA/DCF/653/97"
"The grounds of appeal advanced by the 1st and 15th Defendants are as"
"follows:"
"1.  Whether  the  lot  A  in  plan  X  has  to  be  excluded  from  the  corpus"
"sought to be partitioned on the footing that the 1st defendant has"
"acquired prescriptive title to the same."
"2.  Whether the lot D in plan X has to be excluded from the subject"
"matter on the basis that the same was part of Pahaladelgahawata."
"Having framed the points of contest No. 9 and 10, the 1st Defendant took"
"up the position that he has obtained prescriptive title to lot A. Admittedly,"
"the 1st Defendant is a co-owner of this land. As I have already stated in"
"this  judgment,  if  a  co-owner  claims  prescriptive  title  against  other  co-"
"owners, it is necessary to prove “ouster” in addition to the requirements"
"set  out  in  section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance,  No.  22  of  1871  (as"

"the  Commissioner  has  not  claimed  Lot  A  on  prescription.  As  per  the"
"report of the Commissioner marked X1, the 1st Defendant had claimed"
"only the improvements in lot A. The 15th Defendant, who is the son of the"
"1st  Defendant,  while  giving  evidence  on  behalf  of  the  1st  Defendant"
"categorically admitted the fact that the larger land (co-owned property)"
"was not partitioned among the co-owners. The learned Trial Judge has"
"rightly  observed  the  fact  that  the  15th  Defendant  failed  to  produce  any"
"documents as to the payment of Municipal rates, though he took up the"
"position that the 1st Defendant had paid municipal rates pertaining to Lot"
"A in plan X. In order to establish the claim of the 1st Defendant, the deed"
"bearing No. 3285 dated 17.12.1971 is produced as 1V1. It appears to this"
"Court that an extent of 1 Acre out of the entire land, has been conveyed"
"by  the  said  deed.  As  such,  it  is  apparent  that  the  vendor  in  1V1  has"
"conveyed undivided 1 Acre from the corpus. Since the said 1 Acre is not"
