"The  1st  appellant  in  his  dock  statement  has  stated  that  on  the  day  of  the"
"incident,  he,  along  with  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  appellants  and  another  person"
"called  Sarath  consumed  liquor,  and  when  they  were  passing  the  house  of"
"Ariyadasa  on  their  return,  stones  were  thrown  at  them.  As  a  result,  they  too"
"threw stones at the direction of the house."
"Both  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  appellants  have  taken  the  same  stance  as  the  1st"
"appellant in their respective dock statements, while the 4th accused had denied"
"any involvement in the incident."
"Grounds of appeal: -"
"It was submitted by the learned President’s Counsel on behalf of the 1st and the"
"2nd  appellants  that,  since  all  the  appellants  were  acquitted  of  the  charge  of"
"conspiracy, it is clear that there had been no evidence of prior arrangement by"
"the  appellants  to  cause  injuries  to  the  deceased  and  his  father  Ariyadasa.  It"
"was contended that very fact that there had been no conspiracy establishes the"
"fact that the appellants had no prior common intention to commit the offences."
"It  was  his  argument  that  under  the  circumstances,  the  learned  High  Court"
"judge should have looked into the mitigatory circumstances which amounts to"
"culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"relied  on  Exception  4  of  section  294  of  the  Penal  Code  to  formulate  this"
"argument."
"Exception 4 of the Penal Code reads as follows;"
