"I  am  of  the  view  that  even  if  considered  in  its  correct  perspective,  their  dock"
"statements  would  not  have  provided  a  reasonable  explanation  or  created  any"
"doubt as to the overwhelming evidence available against them in this action."
"The proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution which confers jurisdiction on the"
"Court of Appeal to hear and determine appeals reads thus;"
