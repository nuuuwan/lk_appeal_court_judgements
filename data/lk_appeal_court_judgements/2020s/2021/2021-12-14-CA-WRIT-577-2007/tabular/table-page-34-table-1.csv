"One of the grounds urged to seek this courtâ€™s indulgence to issue the Writ of Certiorari is that"
"the Inquiring Officer has been biased. But no material has been produced regarding bias. The"
"Petitioner has failed to demonstrate as to how the Inquiring Officer has been biased. In order"
"to succeed on the question of bias, the Petitioner who alleges bias should demonstrate to this"
"Court as to how the Inquiring Officer was biased."
"The mere allegation of bias is insufficient and the Petitioner should be able to substantiate"
"and  demonstrate  to this  Court  that there  was  in  fact,  bias.  The  proceedings  of  the  inquiry"
"before the Inquiring Officer of the Condominium Management Authority (3rd Respondent) of"
"21st January, 2006 (P42) demonstrate that the inquiry terminated at 12.10 p.m. on that day."
"The document marked as P47 demonstrates the reason for giving another date and that the"
"same was informed (copied) to the Petitioner."
"In the case of Metropolitan Properties Co (F C C) Ltd vs Lannon and Others 1968(3) Aer 304 at"
"310 Lord Denning observed as follows;"
"""Nevertheless, there must appear to be a real likelihood of bias. Surmise or conjecture"
"is not enough.... There must be circumstances from which a reasonable man would"
"think it likely or probable that the justice, or chairman, as the case may be, would, or"
"did, favour one side unfairly at the expense of the other."""
"The Supreme Court of India has held an allegation of malice by statutory officers have to be"
"proved in Writ applications. In Mukesh Kumar Agrawal vs. State of U.P. & ORS. 2009(10) scale"
"534 the Appellant raised inter alia, allegations of malice. Dismissing the Appeal, S.B. Sinha J."
"held as follows;"
"""The High court, however, upon considering the averments made in the writ petition,"
"as noticed hereinbefore, found that the allegations of malice made therein are vague"
"in character. The appellant, thus, was entitled to raise all his contentions including the"
"aforementioned contention before the authorities under the 1981 Order."
"We also intend to emphasize that the distinction between a malice of fact and malice"
"in law must be borne out from records; whereas in a case involving malice in law which"
"if  established  may  lead  to  an  inference  that  the  statutory  authorities  had  acted"
"without jurisdiction while exercising its jurisdiction, malice of fact must be pleaded"
"and proved. [See Swaran Singh Chand v. Punjab State Electricity Board 2009 (7) SCALE"
"622)] (Emphasis added)""."
"In this present case there is no material whatsoever regarding bias. It is my view that there is"
"no merit in the allegation of bias."
"Another ground urged by the Petitioner was that the 02nd Respondent's decision is tainted"
"with malice. In order to demonstrate malice, the Petitioner has not furnished any material"
"upon which the Petitioner claims that the 02nd Respondent acted maliciously."
