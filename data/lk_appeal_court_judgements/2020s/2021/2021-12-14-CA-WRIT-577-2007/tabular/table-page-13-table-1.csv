"The Inquiry Officer States, I am of the view that in the brochures it is mentioned that a roof"
"terrace with B. B. Q. facility for entertainment would be provided. But nothing is mentioned"
"about  roof  top  garden. When  we  visited  the  roof top terrace  it  is not  suitable for  B.  B.  Q."
"Because there are plenty of pipe lines laid on the roof. This laps on the part of the owner"
"L.P.H."
