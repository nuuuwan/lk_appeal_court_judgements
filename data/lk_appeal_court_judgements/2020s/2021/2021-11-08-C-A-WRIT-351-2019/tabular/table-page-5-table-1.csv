"Public  Servants have  no  absolute right to any pension or  allowance under the"
"regulations of the Minutes of Pension. However, in the case of JAYARATHNE vs."
"WICKREMARATNE AND OTHERS 2003 (2) SLR 276 it was held that,"
"“Under  section  2  (kk)  of  the  Interpretation  Ordinance,  the  Minutes  of"
"Pension is, included to be a "" written law."" Therefore, the decision of the"
"Education Service Committee on the payment of pension is one regulated"
"by 'written law of the country.”"
"Similarly in the instant case the 7th Respondent has made a determination that"
"the  Petitioner  is  entitled  to  a  pension  in  terms  of  S.48C(1)  of  the  Minutes  of"
"Pension. Therefore, it is apparent that the Petitioner has a statutory right for a"
"pension. Since, it has already been decided that the Petitioner has a statutory"
"right for a pension, the Respondents are legally bound to act in accordance with"
"the Minutes of Pension and ensure that the Petitioner is granted his entitlement."
"In  the 
instant  case,  the 
issue  has  arisen  with  the 
inability  on  the  part  the"
"Respondents to locate the personal file of the Petitioner. In terms of the S.4 of"
"the  Chapter 
IV  of  the  Establishment  Code,  the  appointing  authority  or  the"
"employer of the respective public officer is required to maintain the personal file"
"of  the  respective  public  officer.  In  view  of  letter  P3,  it  is  apparent  that  the"
"Petitioner has been appointed by the Secretary, Health Services. In view of P12,"
"it  appears 
that 
the  Petitioner  was  attached 
to 
the  General  Hospital  of"
"Anuradhapura at the time he was permanently released to the University of Sri"
"Jayawardenapura. Therefore, it is observed that in terms of S.4 of Chapter VI of"
"the  Establishment  Code,  the  4th  and  the  5th  Respondents  are  responsible  for"
"maintaining the personal file of the Petitioner. In the case of Pathirana V. Victor"
"Perera  (DIG  Personal  Training  Police)  (2006)  2  SLR  281  it  was  held  that  the"
"Establishment Code is part of the statue law of Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is evident"
"that the 4th and 5th Respondents had a duty to maintain the personal file of the"
"Petitioner by law."
"However,  letters  marked  P15,  P16  and  P17  to  the  Petition  disclose  that  the"
"personal file of the Petitioner was not to be found in the custody of the 4th or 5th"

"Respondents have failed in duly performing their statutory duty as indicated in"
"S.4 of Chapter VI of the Establishment Code. In the event where the Respondents"
