"Section 1.3 of Chapter XLVII of the Establishment Code specifically indicates the"
"duty  of  the  public  officers  to  familiarize  themselves  with  and  to  observe  the"
"Circular instructions. Section 1:3 of Chapter XLVII of the Establishment Code is as"
"follows;"
"‘’  An  officer  is  required  to  familiarize  himself  with  and  to  observe  the"
"provisions  of  the  Financial  Regulations,  the  Establishment  Code,  Circular"
"Instructions and other Departmental Manuals and Instructions.’’"
"Therefore, it appears that the Respondents were legally obliged to adhere  the"
"procedure laid down in the said Circular in initiating the pension payment process"
"with regard to the Petitioner. Moreover, in the case of Karavita and Welikanna v."
"Inspector  General  of  Police  (2002)2  SLR  287  it  was  held  that  where  a  duty  is"
"imposed upon a public officer by statute, such person is required to perform such"
"duty in accordance with the applicable circulars or scheme of recruitment."
"Irrespective  of  such  legal  obligation,  it  is observed  that  the  Respondents  have"
"failed  to 
follow  the  due  procedure 
in  granting  the  Petitioner  his  pension"
"entitlement. Therefore, in such an instance, a Writ of Mandamus lies against such"
"persons to ensure that they properly perform their statutory duty in accordance"
"with the applicable circulars or scheme of recruitment."

"forwarded to the 4th Respondent by 3rd Respondent with copy to the Petitioner,"
"was 
to  obtain 
the  missing  documents  contained 
therein,  so 
that 
the  3rd"
"Respondent  could 
initiate/proceed  with 
the  pension  payment  process. 
In"
"response to said letter(P17), the Petitioner has submitted copies of all documents"
"required by way of said letter P17 to the 3rd Respondent except for one. Even so,"
"it appears that the 3rd Respondent or any of the Respondents has failed to take"
"any positive step in order to carry out the needful and has simply passed the ball"
"to each other. The Petitioner completed the age of 55 years on 16th March 2015"
"and made his application for pension to the 2nd Respondent on the 30th of March"
"of the same year. Since then, more than six years have lapsed without a finality"
"causing grave injustice to the Petitioner. The aforesaid lapses on the part of the"
"Respondents have not been reasonably explained by the Respondents."
"In the above premise, the failure on the part of the Respondents to adhere to the"
"guidelines and instructions provided in the said Public Administration Circular and"
"their failure to provide any administrative relief to the Petitioner with regard to"
