"be  sold  to  him.  The  said  observation  of  the  Supreme  Court  is"
"reproduced as follows:"
"“The Commissioner for National Housing in his affidavit dated"
"4th  July  2001  has  admitted  the  receipts  marked  A3  and  A4"
"without  expressly  denying  the  claim  that  the  said  payments"
"were  regularly  made  during  the  period  in  question,  and  the"
"Appellant 
in  his  affidavit  dated  25th  September  2001  has"
"responded to the averments by admitting “the matter of record"
"only”,  whatever  he  intended  to  mean  by  that  phraseology.  In"
"the absence, therefore, of any express denial from the Appellant"
"or the Commissioner of the matters set out in paragraph 8 of the"
"Respondent’s affidavit filed in the Court of Appeal, I am inclined"
"to believe  that  the Respondent had  in fact paid  a substantial"
"sum of money towards the purchase of the house in question."
"In  these  circumstances,  it  is  my  opinion  that  the  Respondent"
"had a legitimate expectation, at the very least, that the house"
"in question will be sold to him."
"In  my  considered  opinion,  the  equities  favor  the  Respondent"
"rather  than  the  minor  child  Pascal, 
in  whose  favor  house"
"bearing premises No. 43 2/1, Gregory’s Road, Colombo 7 had"
"already been divested, although an attempt had been made to"
"paint the picture that the said premises was divested in terms"
"of Section 17(1) of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law to make"
"out  a  case  for  another  house  to  be  divested  on  account  of"
"Pascal.  It  is  unfortunate  that  the  Commissioner  for  National"
"Housing,  and  his  Department,  had  wittingly  or  unwittingly"
"helped 
the  Appellant 
in 
this  endeavor.  To  my  mind, 
the"
"“mistakes” made by the Commissioner for National Housing in"
"this case are too many to be disregarded on the basis that they"
"were made by sheer inadvertence."
