"(Vide page 15-16 of the judgment, SC Minutes of 29.01.2009)"
"Having  considered  the  totality  of  the  aforesaid  judgments  of  the"
"Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court it is abundantly clear that"
"the  fact  in  issue  to  be  determined  in  this  application  has  already"
"been decided by the said apex Courts, and therefore, this Court has"
"no jurisdiction to re-adjudicate the same once again."
"It appears to this Court that the Petitioner though merely annexed"
"the aforesaid judgments of the apex Courts to his petition, made no"
"reference in the petition as to how these decisions would be relevant"
"or  have  a  bearing  on  the  present  application.  Even  though,  some"
"observations  and  determinations  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  the"
"Supreme  Court  in  those  cases  are  very  material  to  the  instant"
"application,  deliberately  the  petitioner  failed  to  enunciate  those"
"aspects to this Court in his petition.  It shows that the Petitioner has"
"suppressed  material  facts  in  the  application,  and  therefore,  he  is"
"estopped from seeking discretionary remedies in the nature of writs"
"from this Court."
"In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [1973] 77 NLR"
"131, it was held that,"
