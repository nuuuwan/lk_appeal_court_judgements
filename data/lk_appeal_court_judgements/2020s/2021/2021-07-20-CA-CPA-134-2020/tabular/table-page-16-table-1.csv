"As discussed previously the extraordinary power entrusted upon this Court on"
"revisionary  jurisdiction  is  a  discretionary  power  that  shall  be  exercised  with"
"utmost care and caution. The extent and the purpose of such powers are limited"
"to the rectification of any illegality, irregularity, impropriety, or mistake appeared"
"on any sentence or order pronounced by the courts of first instance, where such"
"revisionary  powers  shall  be  exercised  according  to  circumstances  of  each"
"individual case."
"If this case is referred back to the High Court to consider the bail application,"
"the  process  may  consume  a  long  period  of  time  and  cause  an  unfair  delay  in"
"justice.  In terms of Section 16(3) of the Judicature Act and Section 364 of the"
"Criminal  Procedure  Code,  this  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  this  is  the  right"
"instance to exercise the discretionary power of the Court of Appeal."
"Over and above, as decided in the case of Gunaratne   v. Commissioner of Excise"
"(1987)  1 SLR 284 at p.287,   in the special circumstances of a case and in the"
"interests  of  justice  this  Court  may  exercise  its    revisionary  powers  in    an"
"appropriate  case    in  terms  of  Article  145  of  the  Constitution    -  ""The  Court  of"
"Appeal  may,  ex  mero  motu  or  on  any  application  made,  call  for,  inspect  and"
"examine  any  record  of  any  Court  of  First  Instance  and  in  the  exercise  of  its"
"revisionary powers may make any order thereon as the interests of justice"
"may require."" (emphasis added)"
