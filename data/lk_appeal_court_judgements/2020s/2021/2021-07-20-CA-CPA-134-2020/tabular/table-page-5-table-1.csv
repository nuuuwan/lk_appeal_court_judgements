"F
rom a close perusal of the Appeal Brief it is evident that the basis upon which"
"the petitioner Weerasinghe Arachchige Deepa Nandani filed the Bail Application"
"in the High Court and the present revision application in the Court of Appeal, is"
"the  fact  that  she  is  the  wife  of  the  suspect-respondent.  The  petitioner  has"
"submitted a copy of the Marriage Certificate as part of P1 (page 42 of the Appeal"
"Brief) to buttress this rationale."
