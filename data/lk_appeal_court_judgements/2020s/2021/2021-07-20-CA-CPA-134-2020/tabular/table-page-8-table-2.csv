"In Lansage Basil case His Lordship Justice Sisira J. De Abrew considered the"
"case of Senathilake and opined:"
"â€œIt  is  seen  that  the  above  case,  the  Court  of  Appeal  after  considering  the"
"conduct  of  the  accused  and  the  belatedness  of  the  revision  application"
"refused to exercise the extraordinary jurisdiction and discretion of the Court"
"of  Appeal.    His  Lordship  Justice  Jayasuriya  in  the  above  case  has  not"
"expressed a general view that the father of an accused in each and every"
"case has no locus standi in maintaining a revision application."
