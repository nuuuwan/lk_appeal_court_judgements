"to the inquiry into the objection of the Petitioner and her decision and the reasons for the"
"said decision9 ."
"The Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner submitted to this Court that they have not got a reply"
"pertaining  to  the  letters  marked  P14  and  P15  from  the  4th  Respondent.  This  position  was"
"contradicted by the Learned State Counsel and the Counsel for the 1stRespondent."
"The  Petitioner  thereafter  has  instituted  a  Land  Action  before  the  District  Court  of  Galle"
"bearing case no. 17763/L and among other things has sought for an injunction to restrain the"
"Ceylon Electricity Board from entering his land to fix electricity posts and draw electricity lines."
"However, the Court had refused to grant an enjoining order but has issued only a notice of"
"injunction."
"On 12thof November 2020 the 3rd Respondent had come to install the electric post and draw"
"the  electric  lines  to  which  the  Petitioner  had  again  objected  and  it  was  submitted  by  the"
"learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the police officers who were present had arrested the"
"Petitioner and the electric post had been fixed."
"The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that even if electric post and lines"

"1. 
The line that is to be drawn on the Petitioner’s land is 70kV high voltage line which causes"

"to this Court that the Petitioner had attached his title deed to the land as P1 but has failed to"
"attach the plan bearing number 450 which depicts the land and its Northern Boundary but"
"instead had attached a plan bearing number 2440 dated 05th October 2020 marked as P2. The"
"Counsel  for  the  1st  Respondent  submitted  that  they  have  obtained  the  copy  of  the  plan"
"number 450 which is marked as 1R1 and as per the said plan the Northern Boundary of the"
"Petitioner’s land is demarcated with a Wire Fence.  However, this Court observed that the"
"document marked P2 by the Petitioner does not disclose a Wire Fence."
"The counsel for the 1st Respondent also submitted that as per plan number 450 which is drawn"
