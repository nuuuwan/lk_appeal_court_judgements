"Mahaweli Development and Another8 where it was held as follows:"
"“
If compensation has been paid or improvements have been made, then  despite"
"the  inadequacy  of  justification,  divesting  is  not  permitted.  The  purpose  and  the"
"policy of the amendment is to enable the justification for the original acquisition,"
"as well as for the continued retention of acquired lands, to be reviewed; if the four"
"conditions are satisfied, the  Minister  is  empowered to divest. Of course, even in"
"such a case it would be legitimate for the Minister to decline to divest if there is"
"some  good  reason  -  for  instance,  that  there  is  now  a  new  public  purpose  for"
"which the land is required. In such a case it would be unreasonable to divest the"
"land,  and  then  to  proceed  to  acquire  it  again  for  such  new  supervening  public"
"purpose.  Such  a  public  purpose  must  be  a  real  and  present  purpose,  not  a"
"fancied purpose or one which may become a reality only in the distant future.”"
