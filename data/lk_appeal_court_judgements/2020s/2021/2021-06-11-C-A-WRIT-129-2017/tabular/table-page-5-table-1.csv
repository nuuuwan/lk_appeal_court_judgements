"S
ection 38 of the Act sets out that at any time after an award for compensation is made"
"under  Section  17,  the  State  can  take  possession  of  the  land  to  which  the  said  award"
"relates to. In terms of the proviso (a) to Section 38, under which ‘P7’ has been  issued:"
"“
.... the Minister may make an Order under the preceding provisions of this section-"
"(a) 
where it becomes necessary to take immediate possession of any land on the"
"ground of any urgency, at any time after a notice under section 2 is exhibited"
"for the first time in the area in which that land is situated or at any time after"
"a notice under section 4 is exhibited for the first time on or near that land;”"
"I
n terms of Section 40(a) of the Act:"
"“When an Order of the Minister under section 38 is published in the Gazette, then"
"where  that  Order  is  in  regard  to  the  taking  possession  of  a  particular  land,  that"
"land  shall,  by  virtue  of  that  Order,  vest  absolutely 
in  the  State  free  from  all"
"encumbrances with effect from the date  on which that Order is so published, and"
"any officer who is authorized to do so by that Order may, on or after that date, take"
"possession of that land for and on behalf of the State;”"
"T
herefore, in terms of proviso (a) to Section 38, possession of the land that is sought to"
"be  acquired  can  be  taken  any  time  after  a  Section  2  notice  or  Section  4  notice 
is"
"exhibited in respect of the said land. Section 41 of the Act provides that if the provisions"
"of  Section  4  have  not  been  complied  with,  it  is  not  necessary  to  comply  with  those"
"provisions,  and  that  if  a  declaration  in  terms  of  Section  5  has  not  been  made,  such"
"declaration  can  be  published  notwithstanding  that  Section  4  has  not  been  complied"
"with. Be that as it may, with the publication of ‘P7’, the said land has vested absolutely"
"in the State."
"A
s noted earlier, the 2nd Respondent has submitted that the notices published prior to"
"the  Section  7  notice  ‘P10b’  under  and  in  terms  of  Sections  2,  4  and  5  of  the  Act  have"
"been destroyed and therefore are not available. It is clear from the above sequence of"
