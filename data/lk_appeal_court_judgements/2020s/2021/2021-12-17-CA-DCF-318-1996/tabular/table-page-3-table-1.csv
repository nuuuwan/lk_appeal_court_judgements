"T
his  Appeal  emanates  from  the  judgment  in  case  No  2000/RE  from  Kandy  District  Court."
"Plaintiff-Appellant filed a rent and ejectment case against the  Defendants. According to the"
"Plaint, Meera Saibo  Mohamed  Thaha transferred allotment  No. 2 in  plan No.  1205 bearing"
"assessment No. 445 by deed No. 4479 dated 24.08.1981 to Plaintiff. When Plaintiff bought the"
"land, his predecessor had constructed a new building on the southern part of the land and had"
"given  on  rent  to  Munisamy.  There  was  no  question  about  the  tenant-landlord  relationship"
"between  Meera  Saibu  Mohomad  Thaha  and  Munisammy.  Once  Plaintiff  bought  the  land,  a"
"letter was sent on 11.06.1985. demanding Munisamy to vacate the premises. As Munisammy"
"passed away and the wife and children continued to occupy the premises without Plaintiff's"
"permission, another quit notice was sent to the successors of Munisamy on 17.09.1985."
"The stand taken by the  Appellant  was that the  wife  and children of the said  Munisamy  are"
"unlawful occupants. The respondent refused that they were unlawful occupiers but sought the"
"relief under Rent Act."
