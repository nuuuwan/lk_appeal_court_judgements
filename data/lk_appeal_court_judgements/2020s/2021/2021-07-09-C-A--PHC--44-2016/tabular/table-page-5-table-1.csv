"c.  Thus, the Appellant had failed to adduce any exceptional circumstances before the"
"Court to issue Notice to the Respondent,"
"Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 23.05.2016, the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant"
"[hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] has preferred this appeal to this Court."
"On behalf of the Appellant, it was submitted that the Learned High Court Judge has"
"erroneously refused to issue Notice on the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter"
"referred to as the Respondent] on the basis that on the ground as to the non-service of Notice"
"to Quit, as it has been raised for the first time in appeal."
"On the contrary, the Respondent together with the Counter Affidavit, produced a purported"
"Notice to Quit marked P4 and a report of the Grama Niladhari marked as P3. As such, it is"
"apparent that the issue regarding the non-service of the Quit notice was raised at the inquiry"
"before the Magistrate, thus the said findings of the learned High Court Judge is ex-facie"
"erroneous."
"It was the contention of the Appellant that in terms of Section 3 of the Act, when Notice to"
"Quit cannot be served in such manner, the Competent Authority is vested with Power to serve"
"the Notice to Quit and the Power must be exercised in the manner set out in Section 3 of the"
"Act. Nevertheless, in the instant case the said Power has been wrongly assigned to the said"
"Grama Niladhari and/or the Grama Niladhari has taken over the Power of the Competent"
"Authority."
"Apparently, the said section enacts that “where the competent authority considers such"
"service impracticable or inexpedient, exhibit such Notice in a conspicuous place in or upon"
"that land.”"
