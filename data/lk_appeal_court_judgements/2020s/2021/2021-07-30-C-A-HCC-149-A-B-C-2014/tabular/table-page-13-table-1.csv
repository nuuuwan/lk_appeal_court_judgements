"3.
A person who had seen another person concealing the thing in that place had"
"told the accused about it."
"The missing things of the van the deceased drove prior to his death were found in a garage"
"through  the  statement  of  the  fourth  accused-appellant.  This  fact  was  never  challenged  as"
"observed  above,  hence,  the  plausible  deduction  in  this  regard  would  certainly  be  that  the"
"accused-appellant himself handed over the said things in question to PW3."
"The  deceased  had  set  out  to  go  to  Nuwara-Eliya  in  the  van  belonging  to  PW1.  Few  days"
"later,  the  body  of  the  deceased  was  found  dumped  below  Pelmadulla-Nuwara-Eliya  road"
"whilst the said van was found in Pelmadulla in the possession of the first, second and third"
"accused-appellants, with, the mobile phone of the deceased, an altered number plate and"
"few things missing. The missing things were recovered through the confession made by the"
"fourth accused-appellant and were identified by PW1 and PW3. The said van was identified"
"by PW1 and PW4 who had altered the numbers in its number plate."
"The  fact  that  the  accused-appellants  were  in  possession  of  the  van  was  evinced  by  the"
"testimonies  of  PW4  and  PW3.  In  establishing  a  link  between  the  said  evidence  and  the"
"offences alleged to have been committed by the accused-appellants, the learned Judge of"
"the  High  Court  had  rightly  relied  on  the  presumption  explained 
in  section  114  of  the"
"Evidence Ordinance."
"Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance states the following."
