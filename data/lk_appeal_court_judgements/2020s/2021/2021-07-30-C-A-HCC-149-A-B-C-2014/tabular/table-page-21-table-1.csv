"Taking note of the extract above, the contention that the learned Judge of the High Court"
"had erroneously rejected the dock-statement is inconceivable."
"Counsel for the third accused-appellant expressed that, by delivering his judgment after two"
"months hence the trial, the learned Judge of the High Court had acted in violation of section"
"203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which stipulates that,"
"‘when the cases for the prosecution and the defense are concluded, the Judge shall"
"forthwith or within ten days of the conclusion of the trial record a verdict of acquittal"
"or conviction giving his reasons therefor and if the verdict is one of conviction pass"
"sentence on the accused according to law.’"
"There had been two schools of thought on the interpretation of the term ‘forthwith’. One"
"approach had been to give a literal interpretation to the term and interpret it to be ‘at once’"
"or ‘immediately’ whereas the other approach had been to take up the purposive approach"
"of  interpretation  and  hold  the  term  to  mean  ‘within  a  reasonable  time’  or  ‘as  soon  as"
"practicable’. Having regard to the number of cases that are being dealt with by Courts on a"
"daily basis at present, adherence to strict interpretation would not only be impractical but"
"also would affect the quality of justice that is served."
