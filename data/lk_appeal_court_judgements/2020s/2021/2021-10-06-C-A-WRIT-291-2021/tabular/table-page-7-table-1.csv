"Notification  referred  to  above  empowers  the  Commissioner  General  of"
"Excise  to  hold  an  inquiry  on  matters  provided  therein.  Therefore,  the"
"impugned direction to temporarily close the liquor shop (as contained in"
"letter  P2  and  P3) 
is  not  a  final  determination,  but  a  mere  statutory"
"requirement. As per the contents of letters P2 and P3, it is apparent that"
"the Petitioner should be given an opportunity to be heard at a subsequent"
"inquiry."
"In the case of Gamini Dissanayake vs. Kaleel (1993 2 SLR 135) at page 195"
"it was held that, “if an order is ""provisional"", and is subject to appeal or"
"objection, antecedent hearing is probably not necessary. If it is final, but by"
"statute or contract there is provision"
"a)  for  a  ""full  re-hearing  '  by  the  same  or  another  body  having"
"original jurisdiction, or"
"b)  making the decision and an appeal against it (especially if it is"
"by way of ""full re-hearing"") part of an integral scheme, it may"
"be that an initial hearing is dispensed with, or that the absence"
"thereof is not fatal.”"
"Therefore, given the temporary nature of the direction issued in letter P3,"
"it is untenable to hold that the Petitioner had been denied the right to be"
"heard  prior  to  issuance  of  the  direction  to  close  temporarily  the  liquor"
"shop. Further, I am of the view that the statutory procedure laid down in"
"the exercise ordinance is sufficient to achieve justice for the Petitioner."
"The Petitioner’s contention is that he has been operating the said liquor"
"shop for approximately twelve years since the license was transferred to"
"him by the previous licensee who was caring out business the liquor shop"
"since 1989. He further, states that there had never been any allegation of"
"any kind of violation of laws and regulations in respect of the liquor license."
"Therefore, 
the  Petitioner’s 
contention 
is 
that 
the  decision  of 
the"
"Respondents is a clear breach of principles of legitimate expectation. The"
"Excise  Ordinance  and  the  relevant  Gazette  Notifications 
issued  under"
"Excise Ordinance reveal the fact that issuance of a liquor license in terms"
"of the Excise Ordinance is subject to number of statutory rules, regulations"
"and conditions. Particularly Rule No.21 of the Gazette Notification referred"
"to above, empowers the 1st Respondent to inquire in to any objection or"
