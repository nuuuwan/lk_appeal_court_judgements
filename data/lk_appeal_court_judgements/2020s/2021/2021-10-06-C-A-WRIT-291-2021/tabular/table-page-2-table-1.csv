"The Petitioner in the instant case seeks a mandate in the nature of Writ of"
"Certiorari 
to  quash 
the  decisions  of 
the  Respondents  directing 
the"
"Petitioner 
to  close 
the  Foreign  Liquor  Shop  Polgolla  owned  by 
the"
"Petitioner and/or decision of the Respondents to suspend the license of"
"the Petitioner in respect of the said liquor shop. Also the Petitioner seeks"
"a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition to prohibit the Respondents"
"from taking any further steps to close the said liquor shop."
"The facts of the case are as follows. The Petitioner holds a license in respect"
"of the Foreign Liquor Shop Polgolla operated at 203/1, Wattegama Road,"
"Polgolla.  The  Petitioner 
states 
that 
there  had  been  no  allegations"
"whatsoever by Respondents that the Petitioner had acted in violation of"
"laws, rules, regulations or conditions in respect of the license. In spite of"
"such  circumstances,  on  11.05.2021  the  Petitionerâ€™s  Manager  has  been"
"informed not to open the liquor shop on that day as there is an order from"
"the 1st Respondent to close the  liquor shop and consequently a copy of"
"the letter dated 10.05.2021 (P2) had been delivered to the said liquor shop"
"by an Exercise Guard. Thereafter again by a letter dated 17.05.2021 (P3)"

"held by the 2nd Respondent in respect of the objections raised."

"by way of letters P2 and P3 has acted in contrary to the principles of natural"

to 
the  Petitioner.  Amidst  such"
"circumstances, on 23.06.2021 Petitioner has been informed that an inquiry"
"would be held on 01.07.2021. Accordingly, the Petitioner has been present"
"at the said inquiry along with his Attorney at Law. Moreover, several other"
"people in support of the Petitioner were also present to demonstrate that"
"there had been no public outcry or protest in respect of the operation of"
"the said liquor shop in its original premises. However, the Petitioner states"
"that  his  application 
to 
the  Respondent 
seeking  permission 
for  his"
"supporters to participate at the said inquiry was refused. Petitioner further"
"states that subsequent to said inquiry, the temporary suspension of the"
"license  has  been  made  suspended  permanently,  and  the  Petitioner  has"
