"dated 23.06.2021  (marked as P6) the Petitioner has been  noticed to be"
"present at the relevant inquiry on the 01.07.2021. However, the Petitioner"
"claims that he was not given sufficient time to prepare for the inquiry and"
"also  that  he  had  no  sufficient  and/or  any  knowledge  on  the  allegations"
"raised  against  the  operation  of  the  liquor  shop  at  the  given  premises."
"However, it appears that the Petitioner has been given one-week-notice of"
"the inquiry. Therefore, it is apparent that the Petitioner had been afforded"
"adequate  time  before  the  commencement  of  the  inquiry.  If  at  all  the"
"Petitioner alleges that such time afforded to him to prepare himself before"
"the inquiry was insufficient, and however I am of the view that it should be"
"the duty of the Petitioner to request for further time. In absence of any"
"such  request  the  Petitioner  has  not  opted  to  exercise  his  rights  in  that"
"regard."
"Another contention of the Petitioner is that he was not given sufficient"
"notice  of  the  allegations  raised  against  the  operation  of  the  impugned"
"liquor license. Moreover, the Petitioner had been afforded an opportunity"
"to  participate  at  the  inquiry  and  present  his  case.  The  Petitioner  has"
"participated at the inquiry as per the opportunity granted to him. However,"
"the  Petitioner  has  not  raised  at  the  inquiry  the  position  that  he  was"
"unaware of the allegations against him. Even though, it appears that the"
"documents P2, P3 and P6 do not expressly reveal all such relevant details"
"of  the  purported  allegations,  the  statement  (Annexure  No.10  of  1R15)"
"made  by  the  Attorney-at-Law  who  represented  the  Petitioner  at  the"
"inquiry, reveals that the Petitioner had ample knowledge of the purported"
"allegations. The documents (V1-V6) placed by the Petitioner at the inquiry"
"further suggests the fact that the Petitioner had prior knowledge of the"
"purported  allegations  and  the  prior  preparation  on  the  part  of  the"
"Petitioner in order to resist any allegations at the inquiry. In the light of the"
"above I am of the view that the mere contention of the Petitioner that he"
"did  not  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  the  allegations  against  him  stands"
"baseless and therefore the Petitioner is estopped from contending that the"
"subject inquiry was held in breach of audi alteram partem rule."
