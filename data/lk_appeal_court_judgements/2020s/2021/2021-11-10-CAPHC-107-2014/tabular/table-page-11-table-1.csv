"(1) The employment of the Petitioner under the Tea Research Institute was contractual and as"
"such, no writ lies to remedy grievances from  an alleged breach of contract or failure to"
"observe the principles of Natural Justice."
"(2) Powers derived from a contract are matters of Private Law. The fact that one of the parties"
"to the contract is a public authority is not relevant since the decision sought to be quashed"
"by way of Certiorari in itself was not made in the exercise of any statutory power."
"I
n the Case of Jayaweera Vs. Wijeratne [1985 (2) S.L.R 413], His Lordship Justice G.P.S.De Silva-"
"later became the Chief Justice, emphasized that “where the relationship between the parties is a"
"purely contractual one of a commercial nature, neither Certiorari nor Mandamus will lie to remedy"
"grievances arising from an alleged breach of contract or failure to observe the principles of Natural"
"Justice even if one of the parties is a Public Authority”."
"I
 quote, Professor H.W.R. Wade in his Administrative Law 10th edition page 526 and 527 discuss"
"the law pertaining to the above as follows."
"“A distinction which needs to be clarified is that between public duties enforceable by a"
"mandatory Order, which are usually statutory, and duties arising merely from the contract."
"Contractual duties  are enforceable  as  matters of  private law by the ordinary contractual"
"remedies, such as damages, injunction, specific performance and declaration. They are not"
"enforceable by a mandatory order, which in the first place is confined to public duties and"
"secondly is not granted where there are other adequate remedies.”"
"Further, Dr. Sunil F.A. Cooray in his Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka 3rd edition"
"Vol-2 discuss the above contention as follows;"
"“The exercise of power arising purely from the contract by one of the contracting parties"
"who was a ""Public Authority"" cannot be quashed by Certiorari whether such contract be a"
"lease of a shop premises by a local authority, a contract of employment, or a contract of a"
"dealership. A writ of Certiorari will not lie to quash a decision of the Maha Sangha Sabha"
