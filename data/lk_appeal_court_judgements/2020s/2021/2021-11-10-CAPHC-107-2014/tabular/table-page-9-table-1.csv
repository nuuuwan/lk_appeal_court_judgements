"Temporalities Act is applicable to the said property. The Appellant had failed to establish that the"
"impugned  property  is  a  Temple  property  thus  it is  seen  that  any  of  his  rights  or  interests  were"
"affected through the decision which he sought to quash."
"S
ince in the instant case, the dispute arose pertaining to a lease agreement [P15] executed between"
"the 1st Respondent-Pradeshiya Sabha and the 5th Respondent-Respondent. It was the contention of"
"the  Respondent-Respondent  that  the  Appellant  had  erroneously  filed  a  writ  application  in  the"
"Provincial High Court and prayed for a writ of Certiorari to quash the procedure followed by the"
"1st Respondent-Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha in respect of the execution of the lease agreement"
"marked as P15 and sought a writ of Mandamus against the 1st Respondent to enter his name as the"

"Respondent to enter his name as the lessee to the property in question, which is misconceived in"
"Law by pursuing the writ jurisdiction for a contractual relationship."
"A
