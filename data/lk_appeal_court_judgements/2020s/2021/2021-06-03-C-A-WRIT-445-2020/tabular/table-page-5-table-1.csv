"main contention is that the 1st Respondent has called for observations and recommendations"
"from the 2nd Respondent pertaining to any objections from the public. The Petitioner fears that"
"this act is an attempt to refuse the application for relocation.  It is not disputed by the parties"
"that the new location submitted by the Petitioner is in compliance with Excise notification no."
"902, as far as the distance from places of worships and schools are concerned. The learned State"
"Counsel  for  the  Respondents  submitted  that  there  was  no  issue  pertaining  to  Rule  20  of  the"
"above-mentioned gazette."
"Now this Court would advert to consider the provisions of Rule 13. The learned Counsel for the"
"Petitioner quite correctly submitted that by the document P18 the 1st Respondent has sought"
"the observations under Rule no. 13 (f) of the said notification.  The said Rule 13 and 13 (f) states"
"as follows;"
"“13. The documents and reports required to be submitted with regard to new applicants:"
"13 (f). A report from the Officer – in – charge of the Police Station where the licensed premises is"
"situated  that the  applicant  is  not convicted  of  any  offense  under  the  Penal  Code  or  the  Excise"
"Ordinance during the preceding five (05) years and a Report from the Divisional Secretary where"
"the licensed premises is situated that the applicant is fit and proper person to hold the said license"
"and there is no objection from the public to the issuance of the license.” (emphasis by me)."
"The Petitioner’s main contention is that the Rule 13 will not apply to his application as he is not"
"a new applicant but he is an existing applicant.  It appears on the plain reading of Rule 13 that it"
"specifies the reports that has to be submitted with regards to new applicants.  ;"
