"Accordingly, it is  the view of this Court that  Rule 12 deals with  new and existing applicants but"
"the word “existing” is ommited in Rule 13. The said Rule contemplates only new applicants."
"Rule 12 reads as follows:"
"“The applicants (new and existing) are requiered to submit the followig documents along with"
"their applications. However, the Commissioner General of Excise shall have the right to refer"
"and  extract  any 
information  pertaning  to  any  applicant  from  any  file  avilable  with  the"
"Department of Excise  or to call upon the applicant to furnish any information required for the"
"consideration of the issue of license applied for including particulars of income tax and other"
"taxes payble by the applicant.”"
"Though this rule is not exhaustive  I am reluctant to accept that it  extends to cover  the issue"
"befor this Court nameley of calling for a report and recomendations under Rule 13(f).   I come to"
"this conclusion  after giving due considartion to rule 18 and19 and for the reasons set out above"
"in this Judgment.."
"Rule 18 specifically deals with the new applicants. it reads as follows:"
"“New Applicants applying for licences  for the sale of beer, ale, stout and wines (FL 22 A) are"
"required  to  submit  the  documents  and  reports  as  referred  to 
  under  sub  paragraphs"
"(a),(b),(c),(d),(f),(g),(i),and (j) of paragraph 13”."
"Rule 19  of Excise Notification 902 deals with the documents and  reports needed to be submitted"
"by the excisting license holders. It reads as follows:"
"“The  documents  and  reports  refferred  to  be  submitted  for  excisting  license  holders  (for  all"
"catogories):"
