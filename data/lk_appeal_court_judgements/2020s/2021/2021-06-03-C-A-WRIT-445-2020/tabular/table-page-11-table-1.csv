"“The Writ of Prohibition is available to prevent a proceeding in a given matter, to exercise  a"
"power which it does not have under the law, or act in violation of the rules of natural justice"
"where the law requires such officer or authority to observe them. The Writ of Prohibition is not"
"a remedy to restrain the doing of a purely physical act, to restrain which the proper remedy is"
"an injunction.  Further, where it  is  necessary  to  restrain  an official  from  purporting  to  Excise"
"Power which he does not have, it is an order in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition to restrain"
"him that must be sought, and not a mandamus to compel him not to act.”  In view of this courts"
"finding on rule 21 this court is not inclined to  grant the said relief."
"Accordingly this Court upholds the objection of the learned State Counsel and  the  Petioner’s"
"application for a Writ of Mandamus and a Writ of Prohibition  fails. For the reasons stated above"
"in this Judgment this Court holds that  prayers (b),(c),(d)and (e) are prematuer and dismiss the"
"relief prayed for there in."
"In the above Circumstances, we are inclined to issue the Writ of Certiorari prayed for in paragraph"
"(i) of the prayer to the petition. The Respondents are directed to consider the application of the"
"Petitioner for relocation in terms of the law and convey their decision to the Petitioner two weeks"
"prior to the expiry of the license already granted to the Petitioner.  As the Petitioner has been"
"partialy sucsessfull in this application,  we make no order as to costs."
