"her signature on those documents. Answering to court PW01 has said that"
"the  Appellant  would  have  obtained  her  identity  card  number  from  her"
"passport.  Further  date  of  the  documents  of  V4,  V5  and  V6  had  been  on"
"04/12/2006,08/01/2007  and  02/02/2007  respectively.  But  money  had"
"been  given  to  the  Appellant  by  PW01  and  PW02  on  13/03/2009  and"
"04/04/2009  respectively.  Further  PW01  had  denied 
that  she  knew  a"
"person  called  Dammika  Samankanthi  from  whom  the  defence  alleges  that"
"PW01  had  obtained  money  after  singing  the  promissory  notes  which  had"
"been  marked  as  V4,  V5  and  V6.  The  defence  witness  Samankanthi  in  her"
"cross-examination admitted that  she had not made any  complaint against"
"PW01  till  she  gave  evidence  in  the  High  Court.  This  lethargic  attitude"
"clearly demonstrates her malafide intention of favouring the Appellant."
"During the cross-examination of PW02 the defence had shown V4, V5 and"
"V6 
to  him.  PW02  after  examining 
the  same 
informed 
the  court 
that"
"signatures  appearing  on  V4,  V5  and  V6  were  not  signed  by  his  wife  as  it"
"differs in some characters. But answering to the court PW02 had admitted"
"signature  appearing  on  V6  as  his  wife’s  signature.  Even 
though 
this"
"evidence  favours  the  defence  case  no  plausible  nexus  has  been  elicited"
"between V4, V5 and V6 with the money paid to the Appellant by PW01 and"
"PW2.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  citing  this  reason  has  very  correctly"
"disregarded the documents V4, V5 and V6 which had been marked subject"
"to proof by the defence."
"Next  the  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  contended  that  Appellant’s  signatures"
"had  been 
forcibly  obtained  to  P1  and  P2  by  PW02  who  had  allegedly"
"abducted 
the  Appellant 
and 
her 
daughter 
from  Anuradhapura 
to"
"Kadawatha  and  obtained  her  signature 
forcibly 
to  blank  papers  and"
"converted  the  same  as  affidavits.  Hence  the  Appellant  drew  this  court’s"
"attention  about 
the  page  setting  of  P1  and  P2 
to  substantiate  her"
"argument. On perusal of the originals of P1 and P2 no visible discrepancies"
