"in terms of its clause (iv), becomes inoperative with effluxion of the time or if the"
"Petitioner  cease  to  hold  employment  at  the  Prima  Ceylon  Ltd.  The  said  Lease"
"Agreement  is  applicable  only  for  period  from  29.09.2014  to  28.09.2015  and"
"therefore, in terms of its Clause 3, the agreement expires on the 28.09.2015. No"
"evidence  has  been  produced  before  this  Court  to  the  effect  that  the  Lease"
"Agreement has been extended beyond 28.09.2015. Further to that, the Counsel"
"for  the  Petitioner  conceded  the  fact  that  the  Petitioner  has  already  retired."
"Hence, this Court observes that there is no Lease Agreement in existence as to"
"this date."
"Apart from the  above  findings, in order to decide whether the impugned quit"
"notice is bad in law based on the reasons alleged by the Petitioner, this Court will"
"have to inquire whether the Petitioner or the Respondent has acted in breach of"
"the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement. Furthermore, the court will"
"have  to  take  into  consideration  the  contractual  relationship  between  parties."
"However, in the case of Podinona Urban Council Horana 1981 (1) SLR 141, it was"
"held that in as much as the relationship between the parties was contractual the"
"Petitioner was not entitled to the remedy by way of  Certiorari.  In the case of"
"Ariyaratne vs. the National Insurance Corporation and Others (2003 2 Sri Lr 212)"
"it was held as follows;"
"“The  fact  that  the  authority  has  failed  or  refused  to  fulfil  certain  terms"
"contained in that contract does not give rise either to public law rights or"
"to any statutory obligations under which court can assume jurisdiction to"
"issue a writ.”"
"Accordingly, depending on the relationship between parties I am of the view that"
"the Petitioner is not entitled for a remedy under prerogative powers of this Court."
"The  Section  7(3)  of  the  Government  Quarter’s  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act"
"provides the remedies available for such person who claims that they have been"
"unlawfully ejected from Government Quarters. Therefore, if at all the Petitioner"
"claims  that  he  has  been  unlawfully  ejected  from  Government  Quarters,  the"
"Petitioner may resort to the alternative remedy available and institute an action"
"for damages or other reliefs in terms of the above section."
"In terms of section 4 of the Government Quarter’s (Recovery of Possession) Act"
"where a quit notice has been served on the occupier of any Government Quarters"
"neither such occupier nor any dependent of  such occupier shall be entitled to"
"occupy  such  quarters  after  the  expiry  of the  period  of  within such  occupier  is"
