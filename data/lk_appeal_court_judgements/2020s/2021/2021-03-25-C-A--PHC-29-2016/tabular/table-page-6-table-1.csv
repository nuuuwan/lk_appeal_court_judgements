"Therefore,  when  considering  the  above  stated  Constitutional  provisions  it  is  clear  that  a"
"public  officer  who 
is  dissatisfied  with 
a  decision  of  a  Provincial  Public  Service"
"Commission has a right to  appeal  to  the  PSC and  from  there to  the Administrative Appeal"
"Tribunal (the AA T)."
"By section 3 ofthe Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, No.4 of2002 powers is delegated"
"to  the  AA T  to  hear and  determine  any  appeal  preferred  to  it  from  any  order or decision"
"made  by 
the  PSC 
in  exercising 
its  powers  under  Chapter 
IX  of  the  Constitution."
"Furthermore, 
the  Establi shment  Code  stipulates 
the  provisions  regarding  appeals  and"
"appeal  procedures against the disciplinary orders.  Section 26:5  of the  Establishment Code"
"provides that any  public officer who  is dissatisfied  with a disciplinary order could appeal"
"to  the  PSC  and  by  section 26.10 appeal  rights are  given to  such officers to  the Cabinet of"
"Ministers against the decisions of the  PSC. Therefore, the above stated Constitutional and"
"statutory  provisions  have  guaranteed  the  appeal  rights  of an  educational  personal  against"
"any order ofa Provincial Public Service Commission to the PSC and  from there to the AAT"
"or to  the Cabinet of Ministers."
"Hence, in  the instant case, the Petitioner had alternative remedies of appealing against the"
"decision of the PPSC of the North  Western  Province to  the PSC and  ifhe was not satisfied"
"with  the  decision  of the  PSC,  he  could  have  appealed  to  the  AA T  or  to  the  Cabinet  of"
"Ministers  before  seeking  reliefs 
from 
the  Provincial  High  Court  by  way  of  a  writ."
"Therefore, the Court cannot agree with  the  above stated argument of the  learned  Counsel"
"for  the  Petitioner."
"The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has cited three authorities in  his written submissions"
"to  substantiate  his  position.  The  learned  Counsel  argues  that  in  the  case  of Sirisena  Ys."
"Kotawera- Udaganla Co-Operative  Stores  Ltd,  (51  NLR 262)  the  court  had  issued  a  writ"
"even if there was an alternative remedy.  In  that case the decision which was challenged by"
"way of writs had  been taken by  the authorities exceeding the statutory power conferred on"
"them.  Therefore,  the  facts  considered  in  that  case are  different  to  the  facts  of the  case  in"
"hand and  in the  instant case the  Petitioner does  not challenge that the PPSC of the  North"
"In 
the  cases  of Linus  Silva  Ys. 
Western  Province  had  exceeded 
its  statutory  powers."
