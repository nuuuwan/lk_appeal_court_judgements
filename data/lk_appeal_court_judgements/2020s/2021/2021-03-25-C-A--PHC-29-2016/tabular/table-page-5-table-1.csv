"High  Court  Judge  has  come 
to  a  conclusion 
that 
in 
terms  of  Appendix 
III  of  the"
"Constitution, the Petitioner had an  alternative remedy of appealing to  the  PSC."
"The  learned  State  Counsel  citing  the  authorities  of Thennakoon  V.I'.  Direc/or General of"
"ClIs/oms and O/hers [2004 (I) SLR 53], Obeysekara  Vs.  Alber/ and O/hers [1978 (2) SLR"
"220]  and  Rex  Vs. 
Inland Revenue  Commissioner ex.  Pe/erson  (1985  AC  260) argues  that"
"for  the  failure of the  Petitioner to exhaust the alternative remedy  available to  him, the writ"
"applications should be dismissed."
"Appendix  III  item  3 of the Constitution states thus;"
"' The transfer and disciplinary control of all educational personnel, i.e. , Teachers, Principals"
"and Education Officers, Officers belonging to a National Service but serving the  Provincial"
"authority on secondment will  have the  right of appeal  to  the  Public  Service Commission."
"Officers belonging to the Provincial  Public Service will  have a right to appeal to the Public"
"Service Commission against dismissal. '"
"The  learned Counsel  for  the  Petitioner argues  that  the  words  'will  have  a  right to  appeal'"
"there should construe that those provisions would operate 'as and when the appealable right"
"and procedure is laid down by the law in the future .' The learned Counsel for the Petitioner"
"also argues that nowhere in  a statute stipulate an  appellate procedure against a decision of"
"a  Provincial  Public  Service  Commission  to  the  PSC  and  therefore,  the  argument  of the"
"learned State Counsel that the  Petitioner has an alternative remedy  is without merits."
"Article 58 (2) of the Constitution states that ;"
"'Any  public  officer  aggrieved  by  any  order  of transfer  or dismissal,  or any  other  order"
"relating  to  a  disciplinary  matter  made  by  a  public  officer  to  whom  the  Public  Service"
"Commission  or  any  Committee  thereof  has  delegated 
its  powers  under  the  preceding"
"to 
the  Public  Service  Commission  or  such 
paragraph  shall  have  a 
right  of  appeal"
"Committee, as the ease may be. '"
"Furthermore, Article 59 (2) of the Constitution provides thus;"
"'The Administrative  Appeal  Tribunal  shall  have  the  power  to  alter,  vary  or  rescind  any"
"order or decision made by the Commission. '"
