been  caused  to  the  Petitioner  by"
"jurisdiction  as  a  preliminary  legal  objection  without  stating  that  in

"The parties are not at variance about the fact that the powers of the Central Public Service"
"Commission (hereinafter referred to as the PSC) regarding the disciplinary control over the"
"Petitioner are  delegated  to  the  PPSC  of the North  Western  Province.  To  substantiate the"
"position of the Respondents that the Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to decide the"
"application for  writs, the  learned  State Counsel  for  the  Respondents referred to  Article 61"
"A of the Constitution."
"Article 61  A of the Constitution states thus;"
"'Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (I), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Article  126, no court or"

"exhausted the alternative remedy  available to  him  i.e. , lodging an  appeal against the order"
"of the  PPSC of the North  Western  Province to  the  PSC  is  against the  law.  That argument"
"of the learned Counsel is based on the assumption that there is no Article in the Constitution"
"and lor any Act of the  Parliament, which stipulates that an aggrieved party from a decision"
"of  a  Provincial  Public  Service  Commission  has 
the  appealable
