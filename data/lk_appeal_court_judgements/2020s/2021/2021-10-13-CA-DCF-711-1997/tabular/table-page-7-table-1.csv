"""...The moment this Law comes into operation the undivided share of a co-owner, whether"
"he be one whose interests are over fifty acres or not, becomes, in the eye of the law, a"
"distinct and separate entity, equal to the undivided extent he was earlier entitled to in the"
"common land. Such entity is, at that time, still not identified or located on the ground, as"
"distinct   from   the   larger   land.   It   is,   at   that   stage,   as   learned   Counsel   submitted,   only"
"notional, and only confined to paper. By the use of this fiction undivided interests are"
"treated as divided, and a co-owner is treated as the sole owner of a distinct entity, in order"
"to set the provisions of this Law in motion. The effect of the operation of the provisions of"
"sec. 7 is to bring about a separation or partition of the undivided share of a person, who, at"
"the  time  this Law   comes into operation,  owns such interests in common with  several"
"others, and transform  such undivided share into a distinct and separate  portion. Even"
"though still only notional and only existing on paper, yet, the law requires the extent of"
"land such person is entitled to, to be treated as a distinct and separate entity"" (emphasis"
"added)"
