"with Suduetana has now devolved on the plaintiff and the 1st defendant."
"The decision of the five-judge-bench in the Supreme Court in  Jinawathie and Others Vs Emalin"
"Perera 1986 (2) SLR 121 decided that, Upon coming into operation of the Land Reform Law No. 1"
"of 1972 on 26.08.1972, all agricultural land in excess of 50 acres became vested in the Land"
"Reform Commission in absolute title free from all encumbrances and the former owner became a"
"statutory  lessee  who  had to  make  a statutory  declaration  within the   specified period on  the"
"prescribed form of the total extent of the agricultural land held by him as such statutory lessee. In"
"the declaration the required particulars had to be furnished along with a plan or sketch plan. The"
"portion which the statutory lessee would prefer to retain could also be indicated."
"Thereafter, the Land Reform Commission makes a statutory determination specifying the portion"
"or portions of the land which the statutory lessee is allowed to retain. On the publication of the"
"statutory determination in the Gazette the Commission disentitles itself to any right or interest in"
"the agricultural land specified in the statutory determination from the date of such publication."
"Where any agricultural land is co-owned, each co-owner was deemed by a statutory fiction to own"
"his share in the co-owned land as a distinct and separate entity for the purposes of the Land"
"Reform Law. Where a person or thing is deemed to be something it only means that whereas such"
"person or thing is not in reality that something the law requires him or it to be treated as if he or it"
"were with all the attendant consequences and incidents. The rule of  eiusdem  generis  does not"
"operate to impose any limitation on the notional situation arising from the application of the"
"deeming provision as the enumerated classes are exhaustive of the genus."
"Once the statutory determination is made the person in whose favour it was made becomes"
"owner of the land specified in the determination with all the incidents of ownership. The land"
"does not then cease to be a distinct and separate entity and it does not become once again an"
"undivided portion of the larger land from which such specified portion was carved out. By virtue"
"of the Amending Act No. 39 of 1981 any encumbrance which subsisted over and in respect of the"
"undivided   shares,   the   recipient   of   the   statutory   determination   held   in   the   larger   land   would"
"however   be   revived.   Subject   to   this   such   recipient   is   absolute   owner   of   the   portion   of   land"
"specified in the statutory determination vested with the jus utendi, the jus fruendi and (so far as"
"the law does not prohibit) the jus abutendi, the right of alienation and the right to vindicate his"
"title in an action at law."

"The plan no. 1514/66 of Allen Smith Licensed Surveyor dated 15.05.1966 marked as 2 වි 2 shows"
"that the land in suit is at the extreme eastern end of that plan; but, witness Madduma Ralalage"
"Gunesekera (former Chairman of the Farmers Committee), was emphatic that the 2 nd  defendant"
