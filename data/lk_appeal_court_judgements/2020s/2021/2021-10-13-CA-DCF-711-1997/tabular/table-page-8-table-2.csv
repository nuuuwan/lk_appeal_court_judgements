"When considering the above section 59A of the amended Land Reform Commission Act, to claim"
"prescriptive rights the 2nd defendant-appellant in the present case should have proved that he was"
"having   at   least   34   years   of   undisturbed,   uninterrupted   and   adverse   possession   against   the"
"plaintiff.   According   to   the   above-mentioned   paragraph   of   the   written   submission   filed   in   the"
"District Court by the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant, he had only 30 years of prescriptive"
"rights."
"Learned Counsel for the 02nd Defendant Appellant argued that the Statutory Determination by the"
"LRC had been gazetted on 21.06.1991 and the Plaintiff had purchased the land as claimed by him,"
"in the year 1986 from Charlis Sinngho. The date of the institution of the instant action was on"
"17.07.1989. It was further argued for the 02nd  Defendant Appellant that as the Plaintiff did not"
"have any title at the time of instituting the action, the plaint was liable to be dismissed."
"It is my view that this case proceeded for trial on the amended plaint dated 24.03.1995. Thus,"
"there is no merit of the said argument on behalf of the 2nd Defendant Appellant."
"The Land Reform Commission by its order published in the Extra Ordinary Gazette notice bearing"
"number 667/14 dated 21.06.1991 made statutory declaration under S.19 of the Land Reform Law"
"(vide පැ4) allowing Emmie Wanigasekera to retain a specific portion of land called Pussellahene"
"Deniya. Therefore, to succeed in his claim, the 2 nd  defendant should have proved that he was"
"having,   prescriptive   rights   for   34   years;
 undisturbed,   uninterrupted   and   adverse   possession"
"against the plaintiff, prior to 21.06.1991."
"For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff-respondent's action is entitled to"
"succeed."
"The appeal of the 2nd defendant-appellant is, accordingly, dismissed with costs."
"The   judgment   of   the   learned   Additional   District   Judge   of   Awissawella   dated  04.06.1997  is"
"affirmed."
