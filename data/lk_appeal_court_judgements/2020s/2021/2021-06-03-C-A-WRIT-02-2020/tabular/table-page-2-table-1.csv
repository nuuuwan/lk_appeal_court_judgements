"Mayadunne Corea, J."
"T
he Petitioner has sought in her petition Inter alia for a Writ of Certiorari to quash a land grant"
"and for a Writ of Mandamus directing the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to make a correct grant. The"
"facts of the case are as follows:"
"Petitioner’s father had been granted the land numbered as lot no. 147 depicted in plan number"
"2067. The said plan is marked as P1. Petitioner’s father, mother and the children are alleged to"
"have possessed the said land and built a house there on.  Petitioner’s father had nine children."
"The father had died without nominating a successor to the grant. Petitioner alleges that the 1st"
"Respondent who is her elder brother had been granted a deed of grant bearing no. 3063 dated"
"16th December 1999. The Petitioner further alleges that the said grant had been issued without"
"considering the inheritance and succession as per the Land Development Ordinance. The Learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that her father had died in the year 1976 and the mother"
"had died in the year 1965 and therefore, the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash"
"the said grant issued in favour of her elder brother. The Learned State Counsel who appeared for"
"the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, submitted that a grant had been issued to an elder sibling of the"
"Petitioner in the year 1999."
"This Court finds that the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on the basis that she"
"is  a  Power  of  Attorney  holder  of  one  Thennegedara  Sugathapala  who  is  the  second  eldest"
"brother.  However,  this  Court  finds  that  no  valid  Power  of  Attorney  had  been  filed  with  the"
"petition.  As per the submission by the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner, he concedes that in"
"the line of succession, Petitioner is the 9th child. It was also conceded that the grant had been"
"given to the 7th sibling who is anyway elder to the Petitioner. As stated earlier in this judgment,"
"even though the Petitioner alleges that she is filing this action on behalf of the 2nd son, in the"
"absence of any valid Power of Attorney, this Court is not inclined to hold with the Petitioner’s"
"submission on the issue of Locus."
