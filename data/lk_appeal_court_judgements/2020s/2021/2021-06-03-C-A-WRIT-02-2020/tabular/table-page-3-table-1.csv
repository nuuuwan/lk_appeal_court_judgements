"On  the  application  of  the  Petitioners  counsel  on  1st  March  2021  the  Court  permitted  the"
"Petitioner to file  additional documents. By way of a motion, the Petitioner filed documents P4"
"to P8 which is alleged to be an affidavit and photocopies of National Identity cards. However, the"
"said  P8  document  is  not  an  affidavit  but  a  letter  written  by  the  Petitioner  to  the  Divisional"
"Secretary. In the said letter, the other siblings of the Petitioner have not requested the said land"
"to be handed over to the Petitioner. As per the Land Development Ordinance the succession of"
"a permit is devolved as depicted in Chapter 7 of the said Act, specifically section 72 of the Land"
"Development Ordinance and the 3rd schedule there to."
"Despite  this  Court  granting  permission  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  file  the  Power  of  Attorney"
"through  which she says she has got the right to file this application. In the absence of a Power of"
"Attorney, the Petitioner does not have the Locus Standi to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court to"
"quash the land grant which has been given to a brother older than her.  It is Imperative that the"
"applicant who is seeking a writ of Mandamus must establish that she has a sufficient personal"
"interest to the remedy she is seeking. In this instance even if the Court holds that the grant given"
"to the 1st Respondent is ultra vires, still as per the Land development Ordinance the Petitioner"
"cannot benefit."
"Accordingly, this Court holds that the Petitioner does not have the Locus Standi to invoke the"
"jurisdiction of this Court."
"This Court also has considered the deed of grant which was marked as P2. The said grant is given"
"to one, Thannegedara Aron Singho the 1st Respondent. The date of the said grant is 16-12-1999."
"Even though, the Petitioner’s Counsel submitted that the original grant holder to the land was"
"the Petitioner’s father, no such grant was tendered to this Court. The only grant that has been"
"tendered is marked as P2 which is issued to the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner is seeking to quash"
"the said grant by filing this application in the year 2020. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner"
"submitted the document marked as P3 to overcome the delay. This Court has considered the said"
"letter  and  finds  that  it  too  had  been  issued  in  the  year  2020.  Accordingly,  we  hold  that  the"
"Petitioner  has  failed  to  convince  this  court  to  overcome  the  obstacle  of  delay  nor  has  the"
"Petitioner established a Prima Facia case for this Court to issue formal notice. In the decided case"
"of Bisomanike Vs Cyril De Alwis and Others (1982) 1 SLR 368 it was held;"
"“The  Proposition  that  the  application for Writ must  be  sought  as  soon  as injury  is  caused is"
"merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer the"
"injured person sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success"
"in  a  Writ  application dwindle  and the  Court  may  reject  a  Writ  application  on  the  ground  of"
"unexplained delay.”"
"Since this Court is not inclined to grant the 1st relief prayed for by the Petitioner, the question of"
"granting a Writ of Mandamus that has been prayed as the 2nd relief will not arise. However, for"
"completeness this Court observes that the Petitioner’s 2nd application to this Court is to issue a"
