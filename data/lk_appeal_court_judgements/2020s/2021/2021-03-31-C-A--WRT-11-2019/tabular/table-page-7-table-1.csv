"parties to said District Court matter referred above.  The said District Court case"
"was a rei vindicatio action.  Moreover, the validity of the impugned grant 1R1"
"which  is  the  subject  matter  of  this  case  has  not  been  challenged  before  the"
"District  Court  upon  the  grounds  of  ultra  vires.    The  District  Court  lacks  the"
"jurisdiction to hear and determine the legality of an administrative decision of"
"the 1st to 4th Respondents who are public authorities.  The Judicial review and"
"action for rei vindicatio are not comparable.  Thus, issues raised before this court"
"could be distinguished from the issues that were raised before the District Court."
"Therefore, I hold that the judgement of the District Court could not operate as"
"res judicata among the parties in the case at hand."
"The case of T.I.G. Suriyaarachchi and Others vs, L.C. Liyanage alias Gunewardena"
"and Others (C.A. Case No. 272/1997(F) decided on 08.06.2018) clearly illustrates"
"how the decision of the Court of Appeal in a writ application shall not operate as"
"res  judicata  against  the  proceedings  before  the  District  Court  concerning  the"
"same corpus."
