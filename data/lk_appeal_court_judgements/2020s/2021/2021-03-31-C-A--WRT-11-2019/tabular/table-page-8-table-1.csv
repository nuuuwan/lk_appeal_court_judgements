"The Petitioner in his Petition seeks for a mandate in a nature of a writ of certiorari"
"to quash the impugned grant dated 03.06.1986.  In response to the Petitioner’s"
"claim the 1st to 4th Respondents argue that the Petitioner’s application is barred"
"by laches.  However, the Petitioner states that he came to know about the grant"
"only at the proceedings of Kaduwela District Court Case No.141/L.  The said action"
"had  been  instituted  on  27.02.2006  and  judgement  there  to  was  delivered  on"
"24.05.2017. Proceedings of this court commenced on 16.01.2019.  Accordingly,"
"it clearly appears that there had been a delay on the part of the Petitioner in"
"invoking the jurisdiction of this Court."
"However, in the case of Pathirana vs. Victor Perera (DIG Personal Training Police)"
"(2006) 2SLR281,291 it was held as follows;"
"“an application for a writ of certiorari will not be refused on the ground of"
"delay is not attributable to the petitioner. Laches could be excused if the"
"order is nullity. As the circular is a nullity there are no laches.”"
"Further, Wanasundera J. in the case of Ramasamy v. Ceylon State Mortgage Bank"
"(1976) 78 NLR 510, held that"
"“the principles of laches must ... be applied carefully and discriminately and"
"not automatically and as a mere mechanical device.’’"
"In the circumstances I hold that the decision of the 1st to 4th Respondents to issue"
"the impugned grant and the impugned grant on the face of it is void ab initio.  As"
"the said decision of the 1st to 4th Respondents is a nullity, the laches on the part"
"of the Petitioner could be excused."
