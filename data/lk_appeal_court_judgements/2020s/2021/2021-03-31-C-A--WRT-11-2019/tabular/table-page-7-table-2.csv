"how the decision of the Court of Appeal in a writ application shall not operate as"
"res  judicata  against  the  proceedings  before  the  District  Court  concerning  the"
"same corpus."
"“So in light of the above principles I would hold that the application for a"
"writ of certiorari could not have operated as res judicata. As it would have,"
"the writ application bearing No. CA 918/85 never went into tide and it must"
"be borne in mind that an application for judicial review investigates process"
"rights such as failure to afford a hearing and traditionally it would never go"
"into the merit of a decision. This is the traditional view of judicial review."
"English Courts have gone into the distinction between merits of a decision"
"and procedural defects that preceded the making of a decision. … In the"
"writ application bearing No. 918/85, S.N. Silva, PICA (as His Lordship then"
"was) never went into the title of the Plaintiffs vis~a~vis that of the People's"
"Bank. There was only the decision making process before the vesting order"
"that was challenged before the then President of the Court of Appeal. The"
"challenge  was  based  on  an  absence  of  the  right  to  a  hearing  and  the"
"learned  President  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  (as  His  Lordship  then  was)"
"concluded that as the ground for judicial review was not established,  he"
"would dismiss the application for a writ of certiorari. But the later action"
"filed by the Plaintiffs in the District Court of Colombo that has led to this"
"appeal was a rei vindicatio action. Metaphorically the apples were not the"
"same.  Judicial  review  and  an  action  rei  vindicatio  are  not  comparable."
"Therefore,  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  of  Colombo  was  quite"
"incorrect when she held that res judicata applied in this case.”"
