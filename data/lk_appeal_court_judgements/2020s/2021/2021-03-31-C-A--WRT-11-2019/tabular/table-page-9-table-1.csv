"has only lodged this Writ Application, pending the proceedings before the Civil"
"Appellate High Court of Homagama.  The Petitioner has sought relief elsewhere"
"in a manner provided by law and therefore, I am of the view that the delay on the"
"part of Petitioner in filing the Petition at hand is justified."
"In the light of the reasons given above, I hold that the writ of certiorari as prayed"
"for  by  the  Petitioner  should  be  granted  quashing  the  order  of  the  1st  to  4th"
"Respondents to issue a grant in favour of the 5th Respondent. However, I am of"
"the view that the Petitioner had failed to satisfy this Court of his entitlement for"
"a grant.  Therefore, the relief for a writ of mandamus prayed for by the Petitioner"
"by which the Petition moves this court to issue an order directing the 1st to 4th"
"Respondents requiring them to hold a proper inquiry and issue the grant to the"
"Petitioner, cannot allowed.  However, this judgment shall not prevent the 1st to"
"4th Respondents from  holding a proper inquiry  into the matter  and making an"
"appropriate order with regard to the rightful entitlement to the grant in issue.  In"
"view of the above circumstances I direct the issue of a mandate in the nature of"
"a  writ  of  certiorari  to  quash  the  order  to  issue  the  grant  in  favour  of  the  5th"
"Respondent."
