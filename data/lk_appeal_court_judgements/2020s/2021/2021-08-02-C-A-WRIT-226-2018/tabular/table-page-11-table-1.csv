"“A lessee is not entitled to dispute his landlord’s title. Consequently he"
"cannot refuse to give up possession of the property at the termination of"
"his  lease  on  the  ground  that  he  acquired  certain  rights  to  the  property"
"subsequent  to  his  becoming  the  lessee  and  during  the  period  of  lease."
"His duty in such a case is first to restore the property to the lessor and"
"then litigate with him as to the ownership.”"
