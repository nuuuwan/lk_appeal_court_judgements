"IP Fernando (P/W 08), had got a telephone call in respect of the death of the deceased and"
"accordingly the investigations had been commenced. He had failed to identify any mark at"
"the  crime  scene  but  observed  the  lights  at  the  said  place  was  bright  enough  to  identify  a"
"person.  P/W  08  had  also  offered  evidence  on  the  absconding  of  the  appellant  after  the"
"crime."
"According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (P/W 05), there were 4 injuries on"
"the  body  of  the  deceased  and  the  finding  of  the  Post  Mortem  was  “a  shock  by  internal"
"bleeding caused from an attack with a blunt tool”. He further said that the said tool could be"
"a heavy club. Even without those eyewitnesses to the crime, the prosecution, relying upon"
"several strong circumstantial evidence, had proved the culpability of the  appellant beyond"
"any reasonable doubt."
"The accused-appellant made a very brief dock statement at the end of the prosecution and"
"denied the allegations levelled against him"
