"V.  
the learned High Court Judge did not judicially analyse the depositions of P/W01"
"and 02 accepted under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance as required by Law."
"The  case  of  the  prosecution  was  that,  on  the  day  in  question,  06.10.1999,  at  about  10.00"
"p.m, Pushpa Ranjani Rodrigo (P/W 03) the wife of the deceased had got to know from her"
"daughter that the deceased was attacked by a person called Ajith and was admitted to the"
"hospital. Later she has informed of the death of the  deceased. There were 2 eyewitnesses"
"namely Yapage Premarathna Dahanayaka (P/W 01) and Wickrama Arachchige Luxman (P/W"
"02). Both of them were dead when the case came up for trial before the High Court.  They"
"have given evidence on the 14th February 2000, and 17 April 2000, respectively before the"
"learned  Magistrate  of  Gampaha,  during  the  non-summary 
inquiry.  That  evidence  were"
"adopted before the High Court on 03.01.2018 by the interpreter-mudliyar. It was marked as"
"පැ 1 and පැ 2 at the High Court trial. It is evident that the said evidence was cross-examined"
"and the appellant was represented by an attorney-at-law."
"The main eyewitnesses of the prosecution were P/W 01 and P/W 02, who had participated"
"soon after the crime occurred. But their evidence could not be led before the High Court"
"trial since both had died before the commencement of the trial."
"Accordingly, to P/W 01, upon a scream of a woman that “ක ොලුවට ගහනකවෝ” he had gone"
"to check the situation and at 'Nedungahahena Temple, he had observed that the deceased"
"was lying on the floor and the appellant was standing nearby. P/W 01 could easily identify"
"the appellant over the light of the beacons at the road. After seeing P/W 01, the appellant"
"had  stated  that  ""දාසට  නැගිටින්න  බැරි  කවන්නම  ගැහුවා""  and  at  the  same  time  P/W  01  had"
"noticed a club in appellant's right hand. The appellant had turned tail while he was trying to"
"be apprehended by P/W 01."
"In  the  evidence  of  P/W  01, 
it  was  further  revealed  that  there  was  personal  animosity"
"between the deceased and the appellant. When giving evidence at the non-summary trial,"
"P/W 02 stated that on the day in question, at about 8.30 p.m, whilst the appellant and P/W"
"02 were going to appellant's house, at Nedungahahena Temple, the appellant had got down"
"from  the  motor  bicycle  after  seeing  two  people  and  had  started  quarrelling  with  one,  the"
"deceased. P/W 02 stated further that the person who didn't interfere in the quarrel had left"
"the  said  place  and  P/W  02  had  also  done  the  same  as  he  couldn't  manage  to  take  the"
"appellant away. P/W 02 confirmed that there was only the appellant and deceased when he"
"left the said place."
"When  P/W  02  was  coming  back  he  had  noticed  that  the  person  (the  deceased)  who"
"quarrelled with the appellant was lying on the floor and the appellant was standing there. In"
"the  evidence  of  P/W  02,  a  confession  of  the  appellant  was  also  revealed  thus,  ""මම  දාසව"
"මැරුවා. තව කදන්කනක් තුන්කදකනක් ඉන්නවා මරන්න"". P/W 02 had admitted the belatedness"
"of his evidence and also given reasons for the same. ""මම කේ සිද්ධිය සේබන්ධකයන් කපොලිසියට"
"දින  අටක්  යනතුරු  ප්‍ර ායයක්  කනොකදන්න  කහේතුව  මා  කපොලිසිකයන්  කහොයන්න  ආකේ  නැහැ."
"කපොලිසිකයන් කහොයන්න ආවට පස්කස තමයි මම කපොලිසියට  ටඋත්තරයක් දුන්කන්. කපොලිසිකයන්"
"එන්න කියලා තිබුණා. ඒ අනුව මම කපොලිසියට ගියා."""
