"2","0. I bear in mind that suspicious circumstances would not suffice to prove the"
"","guilt of the accused. Having the above legal principles in mind I will now"
"","consider the proved circumstances in the instant case and also whether they"
"","are sufficient to prove the charges against the appellant beyond reasonable"
"","doubt."
"21. By the evidence adduced at the trial it is proved beyond reasonable doubt,",""
"","that on 04.06.2009 in the evening the appellant was consuming alcohol with"
"","the  carpenter  (PW3)  and  PW4  (who  was  having  an 
illicit  affair  with"
"","Wasanthi  the  mother  of  the  deceased).  It  is  also  proved  that  the  deceased"
"","child fell asleep on the chair she was seated at the PW3’s house and that her"
"","mother  (PW1)  took  her  and  kept  her  at  their  house  that  was  in  the  same"
"","land.  It  is  also  proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  while  they  all  were"
"","having dinner, the appellant went missing and when PW1 went to her house"
"","to see the child and the child was also missing. After raising alarm, villagers"
"","flocked  and  looked  for  the  child  and  the  appellant  without  success.  After"
"","informing  the  police,  police  officers  assisted  by  army  personnel  searched"
"","the  area  for  the  child  and  the  appellant  without  success.  On  05.06.2009"
"","morning  the  appellant  had  gone  to  the  Chena  of  PW6  Dinapala  and  had"
"","told  PW6  that  he  is  looking  for  a  honeycomb.  PW6  had  heard  a  child"
"","calling,  and  upon 
inquiry 
the  appellant  had 
told  him 
that 
it  was  his"
"","granddaughter. Later, on 09.06.2009 early hours, on the statement made by"
"","the  appellant,  police  recovered  the  body  of  the  deceased  child  that  was"
"","covered in a pit, in terms of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance."

"","that was denied by the witness, PW4 had been there when the child and the"

failed 
to 
take 
into  consideration  certain  contradictions  and"
