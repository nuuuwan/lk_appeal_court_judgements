"In the appeal under consideration, there was no misdirection or non-direction"
"as to the law, but only a choosing of wrong words, which has not caused any"
"prejudice  to  the  appellants  or  has  not  occasioned  a 
failure  of 
justice  as"
"discussed before."
"The  alibi  of  the  4th  appellant  has  been  well  considered  by  the  learned  High"
"Court judge with a clear understanding that it was the duty of the prosecution"
"to  establish  that  he  was  one  of  the  participants  of  the  crime  in  rejecting  his"
"plea of alibi."
"There is no reason to accept that there is a discrepancy as to the crime scene"
"between 
the  evidence  of  PW-03  and 
the  Police  officer  who  recorded  his"
"observations.  According 
to 
the  evidence,  after 
the 
initial  attack  on 
the"
"deceased, he had been dragged along the road towards the reservation by the"
"appellants.  PW-03  had  heard  the  cry  of  the  deceased  few  minutes  thereafter."
"The Police witness has seen blood like stains in the veranda of a house on the"
"other side of the road, where he had determined that it was the place of assault"
"of the deceased.  In my view, this observation matches exactly to the evidence"
"of  PW-03  without  any  doubt.  For  the  reasons  stated,  I  find  no  merit  in  the"
"grounds of appeal of the 3rd and the 4th appellants either."
"The appeals are therefore dismissed as they are devoid of merit. The conviction"
"and the sentence of the appellants affirmed."
