A  Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st – 8th Respondents from implementing"
"and/or 
reinstating 
the 
13th 
Respondent 
based 
on 
the 
said 
decision,"
"determination or recommendation made by the PCOI."
"T
he  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  for  the  1st  Respondent  and  the 
learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  13th  Respondent  raised  several  preliminary  objections"
"relating  to  the  maintainability  of  this  application. 
It  was  their  position  that  the"
"Petitioner has a personal animosity with the 13th Respondent over the cancellation of"
"the  petroleum  dealership  of  his  family,  and  that  this  application 
is  tainted  with"
"malice. 
It  was 
therefore 
submitted 
that 
the  Petitioner  has  not 
invoked 
the"
"discretionary jurisdiction of this Court with clean hands."
"I
t  was  also  submitted  on  behalf  of  all  Respondents  that  the  cornerstone  of  this"
"application are the purported findings of the PCOI in respect of the 13th Respondent."
"This position is clear from the aforementioned relief sought by the Petitioner, which"
"are  based  almost  entirely  on  the  purported  existence  of  the  findings  of  the  PCOI"
"relating to the reinstatement of  the 13th Respondent. It was however submitted by"
"the 
learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  13th  Respondent  that  not  only  has  the"
"Petitioner 
failed 
to  produce 
the  decision  of 
the  PCOI 
in 
favour  of 
the  13th"
"Respondent,  the  Petitioner  has  also  failed  to  produce  before  this  Court  an  iota  of"
"evidence  that  suggests  that  the  PCOI  has  made  a  decision  in  favour  of  the  13th"
"Respondent. It is in this background that the learned President’s Counsel for the 13th"
"Respondent  submitted  that  this  is  not  a  case  where  even  formal  notice  should  be"
"issued on the Respondents."
"I
n his counter affidavit, the Petitioner has stated that he has submitted two requests"
"for  information,  and  has  produced  a  letter  dated  10th  February  2021  marked  ‘P25’"
"issued by the Information Officer of the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner however has"
"not tendered to this Court the letter by which the information sought was requested."
"Hence,  this  Court  does  not  know  what  information  has  been  sought  from  the  1st"
"Respondent.  The  Petitioner  has  also  produced  a 
letter  dated  8th  February  2021"
"marked  ‘P26’  issued  by  the  Information  Officer  at  the  Presidential  Secretariat  by"
"which  a  request  for  information  made  by  the  Petitioner  in  January  2020  has  been"
"refused.  Here  too,  the  letter  by  which  the  information  was  sought  has  not  been"
"produced."
