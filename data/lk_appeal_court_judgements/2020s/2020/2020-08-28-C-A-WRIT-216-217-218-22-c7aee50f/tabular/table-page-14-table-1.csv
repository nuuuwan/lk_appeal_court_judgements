"only upon the existence of other factors which are hard to find and difficult  to establish"
"which then does not render that remedy satisfactory.  Except for  the bare assertion that"
"revision lies  against  an order of a  Magistrate's  Court it was not argued that revision is"
"more  efficacious  than this  application  for  judicial review 
and 
I  therefore  would hold"
"that the  Petitioners have properly sought judicial  review by virtue  of Article 140  of the"
"Constitution."
"Issuance of Notice-Arguability Principles"
"It has to be borne in mind that in an application for  judicial review  the stage of notice"
"demands  that  a court  seized of  an  application  for  notice  should consider  whether  the"
"case  is  suitable for  full  investigation  at  a  hearing  at  which  all  parties have  been  given"

"Permission  should be granted if an application is  prima facie  arguable. The  permission"
"judge needs to be satisfied that there is a proper basis for claiming judicial review, and it"
"is wrong to grant notice without identifying an appropriate issue on which the case can"
"properly proceed-see  R  v Social Security Commissioner ex p.  Pattni (1993)  5 Admin"
"LR  219  at  223G.  However voluminous  the papers,  or complex the putative issues,  the"
"task remains the same-R  v Local Government Commission ex p . North Yorks County"
