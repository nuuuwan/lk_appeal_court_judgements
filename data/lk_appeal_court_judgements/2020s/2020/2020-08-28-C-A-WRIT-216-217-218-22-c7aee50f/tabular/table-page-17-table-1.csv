"It is  trite that illegality  was articulated by Lord Diplock in the case of  Council of Civil"
"Service Unions  v.  Minister of the Civil Service (1985)  AC  374  at  410;  (1984)  2 WLR"
"174a: 
(1984)  All  ER  935  (the  GCH~ case)  and reasserted  in  HM  Treasury  v Ahmed"
"(2010)  UKSC  2,  where  it  was  emphasized  that  the  decision  maker  must  understand"
"correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and must give effect to it."
"Therefore  the  question  arises  - Did 
the  learned  Magistrate  correctly  understand  the"
"scope of his power when he  assumed  a power  to adopt a procedure as he did before he"
"arrived at the decision to issue the impugned warrant of arrest?  Does  Section 124  of the"
"Code permit him to hear the testimony of  a police officer  and form  an opinion as  to  a"
"cognizable offence  at a B-report stage?  This question becomes markedly  pronounced in"
"the face  of Section 32  (1)  (b) of the Code which manifests that  a reasonable suspicion of"
"any  such  cognizable offence  has  to  be formed by a police officer.  These  are  questions"
"that  loom  large  in  these  applications. Though  the  learned  SASG  cited  to  Mahanama"
"Tilakaratne  v Bandula  Wickremasinghe (1999)  1 SrLLR  372,  the  authority  is  of little"
"assistance to resolve the issue that this Court is confronted with."
"Undoubtedly after  institution of  proceedings in the Magistrates Court by virtue of s.136"
"of  the  Code, 
a  Magistrate  enjoys  the  express power of  issuing  process  on evidence  by"
"virtue of s.139 (1)  of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.  It would appear that adduction"
"of such evidence is  not speCified in the provisions dealing with investigation of offences"
"from  Section 109 onwards and at the B-report stage.  Whether in the absence of specific"
"provisions  in  the  Code  section  124  of  the  Code  could  be  invoked  in  order  to  confer"
"jurisdiction on a Magistrate 
to have evidence led  and empower him to form an opinion"
"as 
to 
the  existence  of  a  cognizable  offence 
raises  arguable 
issues 
that  demand"
"consideration at a full hearing."
"The learned SASG also sought to justify the adduction of evidence of the police officer at"
"the B-report stage on a casus omissus provision namely section 7 of the Code  which states"
"the follOwing;  ""As  regards  matters  of criminal procedure for  which  special  provisions  may  not have"
