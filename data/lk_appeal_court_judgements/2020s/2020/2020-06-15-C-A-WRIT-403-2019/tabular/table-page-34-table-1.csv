"Thus,  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  residence  from  ‘H2’  to  ‘H1’,  ’H’  has  lost  6"
"marks  when  compared  to  ‘P’.  Thus,  the  change  in  residence  has  affected  ‘H’"
"but ‘P’ remains where he is."
"T
his Court shall now take the case of ‘P’ as presented by the Respondents, and"
"compare  it  with  an  applicant  whose  application  has  been  produced  by  the"
"Respondents  marked 
‘4Rb1’.  The 
latter  applicant  has  been  a  resident  of"
"Colombo 5, for a period of five years. The number of schools that are closer to"
"the residence of the applicant than Royal College is eight. Thus, five marks are"
"deducted  for  each  of  the  eight  schools,  and  the  applicant  would  only  get  10"
"marks for sub-category 7.2.4. The applicant has been allotted 25 marks for five"
"years  on  the  electoral  register.  Together  with  the  marks  given  for  the  other"
"two sub-categories (15 marks for 7.2.1.1 and 3.3 for 7.2.1.2), the applicant has"
"received  a  total  of  53.3  marks.  Supposing  the  said  applicant  changes  his"
"residence to Cambridge Place, situated opposite Royal College, one year prior"
"to  the  closing  date  of  applications,  he  would  receive  full  marks  under  sub-"
"category 7.2.4, as there are no other schools that are situated closer to his new"
"residence  at  Cambridge  Place, 
than  Royal  College.  This  would 
take  his"
"aggregate  marks  to  93.3,  subject  to  a  deduction  of  12  marks  under  sub-"
"category 7.2.1.1 and a further 2.6 marks under sub-category 7.2.1.2, as a result"
"of not having five years of residence at the new address, leaving him with 78.7"
"marks."

"marks 
for 
the  electoral 
register 
in 
the  event  of  a  change 
in 
residence"
"midstream, the number of schools must be the same,  the applicant in ‘4Rb1’"
"would  receive  full  marks  for  registration  on  the  electoral  register,  and  an"
