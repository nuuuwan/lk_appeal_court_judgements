"“Defective decisions are frequently quashed by a quashing order without"
"any  accompanying  mandatory  order.  Once  the  decision  has  thus  been"
"annulled,  the  deciding  authority  will  recognise  that  it  must  begin  again"
"and in practice there will be no need for a mandatory order. If on the other"
"hand  a  mandatory  order 
is  granted  without  a  quashing  order, 
the"
"necessary implication is that the defective decision is a nullity, for it is only"
"on 
this  assumption 
that  a  mandatory  order  can  operate.  A  simple"
"mandatory 
order 
therefore 
does 
the  work 
of 
a 
quashing 
order"
"automatically.”"
