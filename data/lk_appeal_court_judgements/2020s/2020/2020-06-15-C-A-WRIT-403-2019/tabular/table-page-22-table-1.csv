"There are two observations that this Court wishes to make with regard to the"
"purpose  for  which  the  above  Committee  was  formed.  The  first  is  that  the"
"Committee was required to consider clauses that had given rise to problems in"
"its  implementation  (tys  ixfYdaOk  j,g  wkql=,j  lghq;=  lsrSfuSoS  u;=  jQ  huS  huS"
".eg,q  wju  lsrSu  ioyd),  and  not  interfere  with  clauses  that  had  not  posed  an"
"issue, unless of course the Committee was of the view that an amendment was"
"required to reflect the policy of the Government. The second is the Committee"
"was a preliminary Committee and was required to submit its proposals, which"
"means  that  the  recommendations  of  this  committee  were  not  meant  to  be"
"final, and that the decision whether to accept the changes so proposed was to"
"be taken by another body or person."
