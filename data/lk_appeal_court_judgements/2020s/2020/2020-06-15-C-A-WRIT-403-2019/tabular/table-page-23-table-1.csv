"College (being the school applied for), even though such schools may not have"
"the  same  facilities  or  stature  as  Richmond,  and  the  unfairness  that  would  be"
"caused by deducting marks in such situations. His concern has been that marks"
"must be deducted only where the school applied and the school that is closer"
"to  the  residence  can  be  classified  as  a  iudk  mdie,a  (or  similar  schools)  in  the"
"context of facilities and not otherwise. This is an  issue  that affects the marks"
"that are given under the sub-category of ‘number of schools located closer to"
"the place of residence than the school applied’, and has no nexus to the marks"
"given  for  being  on  the  Electoral  Register.  This  Court  is  therefore  at  a  loss  to"
"understand how the issue raised by the Principal, Richmond College could have"
"led to a discussion to amend Clause 7.2.1.3."
