"not done so, and therefore it is the view of this Court that the Minister has failed"
"to take into consideration relevant matters, prior to arriving at a decision."
"T
he learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st and 2nd Respondents had"
"submitted that in terms of Section 4(1), the consent of the parties is not required"
"for a reference and that this is an indication that the Minister does not have to"
"consult  the  other  party,  prior  to  making  the  reference  to  arbitration.  Whilst"
"agreeing that the consent of the parties is not required, this Court is of the view"
"that  this  is  not  an  indication  that  the  Minister  is  not  required  to  address  his"
"mind  in  a  judicial  manner.  If  this  Court  may  borrow  the  language used  by  the"
"Supreme Court in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe30 with reference"
"to  the  power  of  an  arbitrator  appointed  under  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act,  the"
"Minister or for that matter, no public official ‘has the freedom of the wild horse’"
"to do whatever he or she wants to. All exercise of statutory duties and functions"
"must  be  within  the  four  corners  of  the  statute  that  confers  such  duties  and"
"functions, and any transgression will be dealt with in terms of the law.”"
"I
n  the  above  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  decision  of  the  Arbitrator  is"
"irrational, unreasonable and arbitrary. I therefore issue Writs of Certiorari in terms of"
"paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition quashing the award marked ‘P5’,"
"and the decision to publish the award in the Gazette, as reflected by ‘P7’. I make no"
"order with regard to costs."
