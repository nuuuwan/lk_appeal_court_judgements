"Forsyth19 in the following manner:"
"“
 “No evidence” does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends to"
"any  case  where  the  evidence, taken as a  whole, is  not reasonably  capable  of"
"supporting the finding; or where, in other words, no tribunal could reasonably"
"reach that conclusion on that evidence. This ‘no evidence’ principle clearly has"
"something in common with the principle that perverse or unreasonable action"
"is  unauthorised  and  ultra  vires.  It  also  has  some  affinity  with  the  substantial"
"evidence  rule  of  American  law,  which  requires  that  findings  be  supported  by"
"substantial evidence on the record as a whole.”"
