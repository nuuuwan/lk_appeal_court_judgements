"Chartered Bank  vs The Minister of  Labour  Relations  and  Manpower and  Others,29"
"where this Court held as follows:"
"“This Court is of the view that in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes"
"Act, the Minister is not obliged to refer for arbitration, each and every dispute"

"background  circumstances  such  as  the 
inquiry  under  the  TEW  Act,  and  the"
"litigation challenging the findings of the Inquiry Officer, the Minister was under"
"a  duty  to  consider  the  documents  ‘X10’,  ‘X11’  and  ‘X12’  prior  to  forming  an"
"opinion  that  there  exists  an  industrial  dispute.  Unfortunately,  the  Minister  has"
