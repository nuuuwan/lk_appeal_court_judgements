"At the outset, the factual setting to this case  is  as follpws;"
"The  Petitioner states  that the  New Green  Inn  Restaurant,  which  was  previously owned  by  one"
"Anthony Durex,  has been  in  business  in  the present from since 2009 and  obtained the Hotel and"
"Bar  License  (FL7  &  FL8)  on  30th September  2010.  The  said  Anthony Durex  had  been  issued  the"
"said  License by the 1st  Respondent. The  said  License  had  been  issued  upon an  application  made"
"under  Excise  Notification  No.  902  by 
the  said  Anthony  Durex.  The  Rule  13  of  the  Excise"
"Notification  902  requires  certain  documents  and  reports  to  be  submitted  with  regard  to  new"
"applicants. The  Petitioner states  that such  application  had  been  submitted  with  the Surveyor's"
"report dated 07th  January 2010 [vide R13j,  which states that there is  no school or religious place"
"within the  prescribed  distance from the location  of New Green  Inn  258/3,  Kandy  Rod,  Ariyalai,"
"Jaffna.  Further the  Petitioner states  that According to the Specimen  Application  from for issue"
"of  Liquor  License  in  Schedule  II, 
it  is  further  noted  that  such 
licenses  had  been 
issued  upon"
"observation  and  overall 
recommendation  of  several  officers  of  the  1st  Respondent  Excise"
"Department."
"Subsequently,  the 1st  Petitioner company purchased  the  business  on  12th March  2014 together"
"with the Hotel and  Bar License  (FL2,  FL8 &  AFL1) on  being legally transferred to the 1st Petitioner"
"company  thereafter.  The  1st  Petitioner  Company  duly  renewed 
the  said 
license  annually  as"
"required up until the alleged non-renewal in the year 2016."
"In or around November 2015, the Petitioner states that the Petitioners have been asked to attend"
"inquiries  view  of  the  purported  public  complaints  made  against  the  1st  Petitioner's  hotel."
"However,  the  Respondents  have failed  to substantiate any such  public complaints or a ""strong"
"public  outcry"".  The  Petitioners  verily  believe  that  if at  all  there  was  a strong  public  outcry,  it"
"cannot be  an  outcry suffered  in  silence  leaving no  proof. Therefore, the  Petitioners vehemently"
"deny  of such  subjective  constructions.  In  any  event,  the Surveyor  General's  report  dated  12th"
"August  2015,  does not give rise to a conclusive  determination. In  fact,  it shows the situation on"
"11th  August  2015,  and  it is  unreasonable,  irrational  and  unfair to victimize the  Petitioners who"
"run  a legitimate business. Therefore, the decisions taken  in  view of the letter dated 13th August"
"2015  issued  by  the  Governor  of the  Northern  Province  marked  R20,  is  unfair,  irrational  and"
"arbitrary."
"In  December 2015,  the 1st  Respondent  issued  the  Hotel  &  Bars  license  (FL7  &  FL8  &  AFLl)  only"
"for a period  of three months from  01-01-2016 to 31-03-2016.  On  or around  04th  January 2016,"
