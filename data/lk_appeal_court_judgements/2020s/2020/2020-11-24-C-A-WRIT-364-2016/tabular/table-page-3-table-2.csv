"for a period  of three months from  01-01-2016 to 31-03-2016.  On  or around  04th  January 2016,"
"the  Petitioners  received  the letter dated  28th December 2015,  stating that upon the findings of"
"the inquiry held on  11th December 2015 and 18th December 2015, the 1st Respondent has decided"
"that the  Petitioner  should  shift the  license  and  required  the  Petitioners  to find  an  alternative"
