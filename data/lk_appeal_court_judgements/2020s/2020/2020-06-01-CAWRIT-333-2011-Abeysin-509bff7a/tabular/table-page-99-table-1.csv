"T
he  above  discussion  goes 
to  show 
that 
the  argument  or"
"proposition  of  law  that  in  judicial  review  a  Court  is  concerned"
"not with the merits of the case―that is, whether the decision  is"
"right  or  wrong―but  whether  the  decision  is  lawful  or  not,  is  no"
"longer valid in modern administrative law.   I take the view that"
"certiorari  does  lie,  if  a  tribunal  has  gone  wrong  on  merits  in"
"arriving  at  a  decision. 
  Therefore, 
I  reject  the  argument  of"
"learned  ASG  that  the  writ  Court  does  not  have  jurisdiction  to"
"look into the merits of the substantive application."
"Before I part with this point, let me add the following.  De Smith"
"states  “The  rule  of  law  has  been  a  resilient  and  effective  force"
"behind 
the  general  development  of 
judicial 
review”  and 
“In"
"practice,  many  of  the  decisions  held  unreasonable  are  so  held"
"By 
because 
they  offend 
the  values  of 
the 
rule  of 
law.”171"
"strengthening 
the  rule  of 
law, 
the  rights  of  all  people  are"
"protected,  the  arbitrary  exercise  of  power 
is  constricted  and"
"democracy  ensured.    Weeramantry,  observing  that  there  has"
"been  an  increase  in  all  manner  of  administrative  authorities"
"vested  with  various  special  jurisdictions  to  deal  with  the  rights"
"of  subjects,  states  “This  new  phenomenon  has  raised  fears  that"
"the administration may under cover of welfare legislation arrogate"
"to  itself  power  over  the  rights  and  liberties  of  the  citizen.    This"
"problem  has  become  acute  in  nearly  all  jurisdictions  and  has"
"promoted  the  growth  of  a  large  volume  of  new  law  by  which  all"
"manner  of  curbs  and  restraints  are  being  placed  upon  such"
"authorities. 
  The  principle  of 
judicial  review  of  administrative"
"decisions  is  expanding  and  administrative  law  is  likely  to  grow"
