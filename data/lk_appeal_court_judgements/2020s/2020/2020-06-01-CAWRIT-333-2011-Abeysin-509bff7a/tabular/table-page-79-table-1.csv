"correct  errors  or  to  substitute  a  correct  order  for  a  wrong"
"order  and  if  the  Commissioner’s  award  of  compensation"
"was not set aside in whole or in part, it had to be allowed"
"to  stand  unreversed.  “The  system  of  Judicial  review 
is"
"radically  different 
from 
the  system  of  appeals.  When"
"hearing  an  appeal,  a  court  is  concerned  with  the  merits  of"
"the 
decision 
under 
appeal;  when 
subjecting 
some"
"administrative  act  or  order  to  judicial  review,  the  court  is"
"concerned  with  its  legality.  On  an  appeal  the  question  is"
"right  or  wrong?  On 
review 
the  question 
is 
lawful  or"
"unlawful?”    Judicial  review  is  a  fundamentally  different"
"operation to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. A court on"
"review 
is  concerned  only  with  the  question  whether  the"
"award under attack should be allowed to stand or not. Vide"
"Prof.  H.  W.  R.  Wade  on  Administrative  Law,  7th  edition,"
"pages 38  to 39. Thus,  the object  of  this  court upon judicial"
"review  is  strictly  to  consider  whether  the  whole  or  part  of"
"the 
award 
of 
compensation 
pronounced 
by 
the"
"Commissioner  of  Labour  is  lawful  or  unlawful.  This  court"
"ought  not  to  exercise  its  appellate  powers  and  jurisdiction"
"when engaged in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction"
"and judicial review over an award of compensation decreed"
"by  the  Commissioner  of  Labour.  In  this  respect,  I  would"
"reiterate 
the  prudent  and  wise  observations  made  by"
"Justice  Samarawickrema  in  Silva  v.  Kuruppu  (SC  182/69,"
"SC Minutes 14.10.71).135"
