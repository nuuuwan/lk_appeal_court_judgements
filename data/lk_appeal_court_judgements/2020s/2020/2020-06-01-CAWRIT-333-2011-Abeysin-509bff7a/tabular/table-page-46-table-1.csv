"disregarded.  Furthermore, 
in  a  situation,  where  giving"
"reasons have been ignored, such a body would run the risk"
"of having acted arbitrarily in coming to their conclusion."
"Giving reasons for decisions minimises abuse of power."
"On  behalf  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  India,  in  Madhya  Pradesh"
"Industries Ltd. v. Union of India,66 Subba Rao J. stated:"
"In  the  context  of  a  welfare  State,  administrative  tribunals"
"have 
come 
to 
stay. 
Indeed, 
they  are 
the  necessary"
"concomitants  of  a  welfare  State.  But  arbitrariness  in  their"
"functioning  destroys  the  concept  of  a  welfare  State  itself."
"Self-discipline  and  supervision  exclude  or  at  any 
rate"
"minimize  arbitrariness.  The  least  a  tribunal  can  do  is  to"
"disclose  its mind. The compulsion of disclosure guarantees"
"consideration.  The  condition 
to  give 
reasons 
introduces"
"clarity and excludes or at any rate minimises arbitrariness;"
"it gives satisfaction to the party against whom the order is"
"made; and it also enables an appellate or supervisory court"
"to keep the tribunals within bounds. A reasoned order is a"
"desirable  condition  of 
judicial  disposal…If 
tribunals  can"
"make orders  without giving reasons,  the  said power  in  the"
"hands of unscrupulous or dishonest officers may turn out to"
"be a potent weapon for abuse of power. But, if reasons for"
"an  order  are  given,  it  will  be  an  effective  restraint  on  such"
"abuse,  as  the  order,  if  it  discloses  extraneous  or  irrelevant"
"considerations,  will  be  subject 
to 
judicial  scrutiny  and"
