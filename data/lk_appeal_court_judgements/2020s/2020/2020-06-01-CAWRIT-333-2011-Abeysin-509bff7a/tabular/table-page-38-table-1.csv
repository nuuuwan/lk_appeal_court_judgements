"decisions  being  an  essential  element  of  administrative  justice"
"and a requirement for a general sense of justice."
"The principles of natural justice do not, as yet, include any"
"general  rule  that  reasons  should  be  given  for  decisions."
"Nevertheless  there 
is  a  strong  case  to  be  made  for  the"
"giving of reasons as an essential element of administrative"
"justice.  The  need  for  it  has  been  sharply  exposed  by  the"
"expanding 
law  of 
judicial 
review,  now 
that  so  many"
"decisions  are  liable  to  be  quashed  or  appealed  against  on"
"grounds  of  improper  purpose,  relevant  consideration  and"
"errors  of 
law  of  various  kinds.  Unless 
the  citizen  can"
"discover 
the  reasoning  behind 
the  decision,  he  may  be"
"unable to tell whether it is reviewable or not, and so he may"
"be deprived of  the protection of  the law.  A right  to reasons"
"is  therefore  an  indispensable  part  of  a  sound  system  of"
"judicial review.  Natural justice may provide  the best rubric"
"for it, since the giving of reasons is required by the ordinary"
"manâ€™s sense of justice. It is also a healthy discipline for all"
"who exercise power over others.43"
