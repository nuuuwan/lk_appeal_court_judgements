"protected  against  unfair  dismissal.  No 
less  protection"
"should be afforded to a probationer constable.”160"
"There  is  however  a  wider  point  than  the  injustice  of  the"
"decision-making  process 
of 
the  Chief  Constable.  With"
"profound  respect  to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  I  dissent  from  the"
"view  that  “Not  only  must 
[the  probationer  constable]  be"
"given a fair hearing, but the decision itself must be fair and"
"reasonable.” 
If 
that  statement  of 
the 
law  passed 
into"
"authority  without 
comment, 
it  would 
in  my 
opinion"
"transform,  and  wrongly  transform,  the  remedy  of  judicial"
"review.  Judicial  review,  as 
the  words 
imply, 
is  not  an"
"appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which"
"the decision was made. The statement of law which I have"
"quoted  implies  that  the  court  sits  in  judgment  not  only  on"
"the  correctness  of  the  decision-making  process  but  also  on"
"the correctness of the decision itself.161"
