ealand126 and R. v. Deputy  Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex"
"p.  Moore127  stated  “Principles  of  natural  justice  require  that  a"
"tribunal’s  decisions  are  based  on  some  evidence  of  probative"
"value.”"
"Our  Courts,  following  English  decisions,  have  taken  a  liberal"
"approach on questions of ‘no evidence’, error of law and mistake"
"of  fact  etc.,  in  that  no  forceful  attempt  has  been  made  to  limit"
"writ  jurisdiction  only  to  lack  or  excess  of  jurisdiction  of  the"
"deciding authority."
"There  is  no  need  to  panic  that  the  Courts,  in  the  exercise  of"
"judicial  review,  will set  aside  administrative  decisions  whenever"
"they  are  found  to  be  faulty.    An  error  of  law  ipso  facto  will  not"
"give the Courts carte blanche to review decisions on the basis of"
"what  the  Courts  consider  to  be  fair  and  reasonable  on  merits."
"Writ being a discretionary remedy, the Court can decide whether"
"or not the error in question is of sufficient significance to justify"
"the  writ.  For  instance,  Lord  Denning  was  able  to  side  with  the"
"majority  opinion  in  Baldwin  &  Francis  Ltd  v.  Patents  Appeal"
"Tribunal128  to  hold  that  although  an  error  of  law  did  appear"
"upon  the  face  of  the  record,  it  was  not  an  error  which  would"
"warrant the remedy of certiorari."
