"give 
reasons 
in  support  of 
its  decision 
to  confirm 
the"
"proceedings of the Court Martial. Mr. Dutta has been unable"
"to  point  out  any  other  section  of  the  Act  or  any  of  the  rule"
"made 
therein

implication  can  be"
"drawn 
that 
such

the  Central"
"Government  or  upon  the  confirming  authority.  Apart  from"
"any  requirement  imposed  by  the  statute  or  statutory  rule"
"either expressly or by necessary implication, we are unable"
"to  accept  the  contention  of  Mr.  Dutta  that  there 
is  any"
"general  principle  or  any 
rule  of  natural 
justice 
that  a"
"statutory  tribunal  should  always  and  in  every  case  give"
"reasons in support of its decision."
