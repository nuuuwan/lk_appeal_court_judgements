"The  wrongful  rejection  of  admissible  evidence  and  wrongful"
"admission  of 
inadmissible  evidence 
in 
the  decision-making"
"process are incidents of errors of law on the face of the record."
"If 
the  deciding  authority  has  manifestly 
failed 
to  properly"
"evaluate the evidence led before it, the decision can be quashed"
"on the ground of error of law on the face of the record."
"According  to  De  Smith  “The  wrongful  rejection  of  evidence  by  a"
"decision-maker  may  also  amount  either  to  a  failure  to  take  into"
"account  a  relevant  consideration  and  or  to  a  failure  to  afford"
"procedural propriety and thus render the decision unlawful.”102"
"In  Chithrasiri  v.  National  Gem  and  Jewellery  Authority,103  after"
"an  inquiry,  the  Gem  Authority  issued  a  gem  mining  licence  in"
"favour  of  the  respondent  on  the  primary  basis  that  the  title  to"
"the  land  was  established  by  a  partition  decree.    The  Petitioner,"
"seeking  to  quash  the  said  decision  by  certiorari,  convinced  this"
"Court that the said partition decree was not relevant to the land"
"the license was issued to but to a different land, and thereby the"
"Authority had clearly gone wrong on facts in issuing the licence."
