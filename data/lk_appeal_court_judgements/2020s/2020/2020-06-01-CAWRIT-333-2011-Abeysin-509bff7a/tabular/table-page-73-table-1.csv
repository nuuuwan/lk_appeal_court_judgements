"page  316  that  “It  seems  clear  that  this  ground  of  judicial"
"review  ought  now 
to  be  regarded  as  established  on  a"
"general  basis”,  and 
forecasts 
that 
‘no  evidence’  seems"
"destined  to  take  its  place  as  yet  a  further  branch  of  the"
"principle  of  ultra  vires,  so 
that  Acts  giving  powers  of"
"determination will be taken to imply that the determination"
"must  be  based  on  some  acceptable  evidence.  If  it  is  not,  it"
"will  be 
treated  as 
‘arbitrary,  capricious  and  obviously"
"unauthorised’."
"Applying 
these  principles 
to 
the  matter  before  us,  and"
"having regard to the facts aforementioned, I am of the view"
"that  the  Rent  Board  had  failed  to  properly  evaluate  the"
"evidence  and  such  failure  was  a  question  of 
law  upon"
"which  the  Board  of  Review  was  entitled  to  exercise 
its"
"powers under section 40 of the Act.118"
