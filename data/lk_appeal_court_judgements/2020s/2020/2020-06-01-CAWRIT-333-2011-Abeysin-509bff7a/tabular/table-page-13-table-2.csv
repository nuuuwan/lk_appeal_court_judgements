"The  argument  of 
learned  ASG,  as  presented 
in 
the  written"
"submission, is as follows:"
"S.99 of the Regulations reads thus;"
"“99. The finding on every charge against the accused shall"
"be recorded and, except as mentioned in these regulations,"
"shall be recorded simply as a finding of “Guilty”, or of “Not"
"guilty”  or  of  “Not  guilty  and  honourably  acquit  him  of  the"
"same.”"
"It 
is 
respectfully 
submitted 
that 
the  drafters 
of 
the"
"regulations  have  included  the  word  “simply”  in  order  to"
"stress the fact that all what is required of Court Martial is to"
"pronounce 
its  verdict  by  using 
the  words  Guilty  or  Not"
"Guilty and therefore nothing further is required."
"In  this  backdrop  it  would  be  pertinent  to  submit  that  there"
"is just one section of the Regulations which seems to require"
"Court Martial to give reasons for its recommendation.  S.108"
"of the Regulations reads as follows;"
"“108. 
If 
the  Court  Martial  makes  a  recommendation  of"
"mercy, it shall give its reasons for its recommendation.”"
