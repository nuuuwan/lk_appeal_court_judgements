"In  the  first  case,  Som  Datt  Datta  (supra),  the  final  argument  of"
"Counsel for the Petitioner was:"
"[T]he  order  of  the  Chief  of  the  Army  Staff  confirming  the"
"proceedings  of  the  Court-Martial  under  s.164  of  the  Army"
"Act was illegal since no reason has been given in support of"
"the order by the Chief of the Army Staff. It was also pointed"
"out  that  the  Central  Government  has  also  not  given  any"
"reasons while dismissing the appeal of the Petitioner under"
"s.165  of  the  Army  Act  and  that  the  order  of  the  Central"
"Government  must  therefore  be  held  to  be  illegal  and  ultra"
"vires  and  quashed  by  the  grant  of  a  writ  in  the  nature  of"
"certiorari."
