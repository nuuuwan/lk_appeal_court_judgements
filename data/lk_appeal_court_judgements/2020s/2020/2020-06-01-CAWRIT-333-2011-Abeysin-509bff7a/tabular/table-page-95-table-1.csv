"supervisory function on a judicial review of that decision is"
"limited. The court cannot be expected to possess knowledge"
"of the reasons of policy which lie behind the administrative"
"decision  nor  is  it  desirable  that  evidence  should  be  called"
"before the court of the implications of such policy. It follows"
"that the court ought not to attempt to weigh the merits of the"
"particular  decision  but  should  confine 
its 
function 
to  a"
"consideration  of  the  manner 
in  which  the  decision  was"
"reached.‚Äù"
"When  the  sole  issue  raised  on  an  application  for  judicial"
"review  is  whether  the  rules  of  natural  justice  have  been"
"observed, 
these  propositions  are  unexceptionable.  Other"
"considerations  arise  when  an  administrative  decision 
is"
"attacked 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
it 
is 
vitiated 
by 
self-"
"misdirection, by taking account of irrelevant or neglecting to"
"take  account 
of 
relevant 
factors, 
or 
is 
so  manifestly"
"unreasonable  that  no  reasonable  authority,  entrusted  with"
"the power in question, could reasonably have made such a"
"decision. See the well known judgment of Lord Greene M.R."
