"[1894]  1  QB  750  at  760  or  where  no  deciding  authority"
"could  reasonably  reach  that  conclusion  on  that  evidence"

"Lord  Atkinson 
in  Folkestone  Corporation  v.  Brockmad"
"[1914]  AC  338  at  367  remarked:  “an  order  made  without"
"any  evidence  to  support  it  is  in  truth,  in  my  view,  made"
"without  jurisdiction.”  Contra  -  R.  v.  Net  Bell  Liquors  Ltd."
"[1922] AC 128 at 151 per Lord Sumner. R. v. Ludlow [1947]"
"KB  634  per  Lord  Goddard  CJ.  However,  Lord  Denning  in"
"O’reilly v. Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237 at 253 has impugned"
"the statement of the law pronounced by Lord Sumner as the"
"darkest  moment  of  the  “blackout  of  any  development  of"
"Administrative Law”. Other decisions have described a “no"
"evidence  finding”  as  unreasonable,  perverse  and  arbitrary"
"and therefore ultra vires for other reasons."

that  despite 
the  absence  of  an"
"authoritative  decision  reviewing 
the 
justification 
for  and"
"against  the  “no  evidence  rule”,  “it  seems  clear  that  this"
"ground  of 
judicial  review  ought  now  to  be  regarded  as"
"established on a general basis…it conforms so well to other"
"developments 
in  administrative 
law 
that  one  can  only"
"assume 
that 
the 
older 
authorities 
to 
the 
contrary,"
"impressive  though  they  are,  may  now  be  consigned  to  the"
"limbo  of  history.  ‘No  evidence’  seems  destined  to  take  its"
"place as yet a further branch of the principle of ultra vires,"
"so that Acts giving powers of determination will be taken to"
"imply  that  the  determination  must  be  made  upon  some"
