"72"
"The  Court  of  Appeal  observed  that  “if  the  true  and  only"
"reasonable 
conclusion 
contradicts 
the 
determination"
"reached by the tribunal, the conclusion may be set aside on"
"the ground that there has been an error of law, which was"
"responsible  for  the  determination”,  and  proceeded  to  hold"
"that 
the 
“Board  of  Review  has  not  acted  outside 
its"
"jurisdiction 
in  entertaining 
the  appeal  and  making 
its"
"decision on a matter of law”.116"
"In  Hasseen  v.  Gunasekera  and  others,117 
the  Court  of"
"Appeal  dealt  with  an  order  of 
the  Board  of  Review,"
"affirming  an  order  of 
the  Rent  Board  which  had  been"
"“arrived at without an adequate evaluation of the evidence"
"and  by  failing  to  take  into  consideration  relevant  items  of"
"evidence which could have influenced the finding” and held"
"the Rent Board as well as the Board of Review had “erred"
"in 
law  by  failing  to  take 
into  account  relevant 
items  of"
"evidence  in  arriving  at  the  finding”  and  therefore  quashed"
"the  orders  of  the  Rent  Board  as  well  as  of  the  Board  of"
"Review."
"Wade  &  Forsyth,  Administrative  Law,  7th  edition  at  page"
"312  dealing  with  the 
‘no  evidence’  rule  states  that  “no"
"evidence  does  not  mean  only  a  total  dearth  of  evidence.  It"
"extends to any case where the evidence, taken as a whole,"
"is  not  reasonably  capable  of  supporting 
the 
finding,  or"
"where,  in  other  words,  no  tribunal  could  reasonably  reach"
"that  conclusion  on  that  evidence”.  It  goes  on  to  state  at"
