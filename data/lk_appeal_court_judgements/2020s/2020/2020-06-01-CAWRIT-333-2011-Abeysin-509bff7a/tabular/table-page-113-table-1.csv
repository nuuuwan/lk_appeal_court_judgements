"according to law”, which in practical terms refers to sentencing."
"However, 
in  Court  Martial  proceedings,  after  the  accused 
is"
"found  guilty,  the  Court  Martial  shall,  according  to  Regulation"
"106,  take  evidence  on 
factors  to  be  considered 
in  terms  of"
"sentencing and exercise its authority under section 47 of the Act"
"in imposing punishment. According to sections 63 and 64 of the"
"Act,  and  Regulations  132,  133,  138  and  162,  convictions  and"
"sentences  imposed  by  the  Court  Martial  shall  be  subject  to  the"
"approval  of  the  authority  having  power  to  confirm  the  same,"
"until which time the conviction and sentence shall not be valid."
"Hence, unlike at a trial by jury where the verdict is given by the"
"jury  and  the  sentence  is  passed  by  the  Judge,  both  of  which"

"conviction  and  sentence  of  a  Court  Martial  are  both  passed"
"collectively  by  all  members  thereof  and  shall  take  effect  only"
"upon  the  approval  of  the  confirming  authority–such  authority"
"also having the power to refer the matter to the Court Martial for"
"revision or to alter the conviction and/or sentence."
"In terms of Regulation 109, the sentence shall be signed by the"
"President of the Court Martial."
