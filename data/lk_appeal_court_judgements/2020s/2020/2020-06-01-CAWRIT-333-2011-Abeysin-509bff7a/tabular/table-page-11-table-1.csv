"irregularity

in"

"In  Seneviratne’s  case,  one  of  the  grounds  relied  upon  by  the"
"Petitioners  in  challenging  the  acquisition  order  was  failure  to"
"state  the  public  purpose  for  which  the  land  was  to  be  acquired"
"in the Section 2 Notice issued under the Land Acquisition Act.9"
"Counsel 
for 
the 
Respondents 
convinced 
the  Court  with"
"documentary  evidence  that  the  Petitioners  were  aware  of  the"
"public purpose for which the land was to be acquired long before"
"the publication of the Section 2 Notice.  It is in this context that"
"the  Court  cited  De  Smith’s  Judicial  Review  of  Administrative"
"Action (5th Edition), where it states “If the applicant has not been"
"prejudiced by the matters on which he relies then the Court may"
"refuse  relief  even  though  he  has  succeeded  in  establishing  some"
"defect. The literal or technical breach of an apparently mandatory"
"provision  in  a  Statute  may  be  so  insignificant  as  not  in  effect  to"
"matter.  In  these  circumstances  the  Court  may  in  its  discretion"
"refuse relief.”"
"The  issue  in  the  instant  case  is  not  comparable.    The  instant"
"case  deals  with  the  liberty  of  a  man,  not  with  his  proprietary"
"rights,  as  in  Seneviratne’s  case.    Regulation  98  deals  with  the"
"procedure relating to infliction of punishment,  in fact,  the most"
"serious known to law―capital punishment or life imprisonment."
