"statutory  discretions  often  use  the  word  “unreasonable”  in"
"a rather comprehensive sense.  It has frequently been used"
"and 
is 
frequently  used  as  a  general  description  of 
the"
"things 
that  must  not  be  done.  For 
instance,  a  person"
"entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself"
"properly 
in 
law.  He  must  call  his  own  attention 
to 
the"
"matters  which  he  is  bound  to  consider.  He  must  exclude"
"from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what"
"he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may"
"truly 
be 
said, 
and 
often 
is 
said, 
to 
be 
acting"
"“unreasonably.”  Similarly, 
there  may  be  something  so"
"absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay"
"within the powers of the authority. Warrington L.J. in Short"
"v. Poole Corporation [1926] Ch 66, 90, 91 gave the example"
"of  the  red-haired  teacher,  dismissed  because  she  had  red"
"hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In another sense it"
"is  taking 
into  consideration  extraneous  matters. 
It 
is  so"
"unreasonable  that  it  might  almost  be  described  as  being"
"done in bad faith; and, in fact, all these things run into one"
"another.168"
"The  court  is  entitled  to  investigate  the  action  of  the  local"
"authority  with  a  view  to  seeing  whether  they  have  taken"
"into  account  matters  which 
they  ought  not 
to 
take 
into"
"account, or, conversely, have refused to take into account or"
"neglected  to  take  into  account matters  which  they ought  to"
"take into account. Once that question is answered in favour"
"of  the  local  authority,  it  may  be  still  possible  to  say  that,"
"although 
the 
local  authority  have  kept  within 
the 
four"
