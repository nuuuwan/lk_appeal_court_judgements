"T
he first principle of natural justice is to hear both sides before"
"taking  a  decision.    This  is  known  as  the  audi  alteram  partem"
"rule, which runs across-the-board on the whole spectrum of the"
"decision-making  process  as  a  golden 
thread, 
irrespective  of"
"whether the decision is by a regular Court, quasi-judicial body,"
"administrative tribunal or the like.  Hearing both sides does not"
"end  the  matter.    After  the  hearing,  the  deciding  authority  shall"
"give  its  decision.    The  decision  shall  not  be  an  empty  decision"
"without  reasons.    De  Smith  says  “If  those  entitled  to  be  heard"
"have  no  right  to  know  how  a  tribunal  resolved  the 
issues 
in"
"dispute  at  the  hearing,  they  may  well  regard  as  an  empty  ritual"
"their  legally  conferred  opportunity  to  be  heard”.37    The  aggrieved"
"party has a right to know the reasons for the decision, at least to"
"consider challenging the decision by appeal or judicial review.  If"
"the  decision  is  challenged  before  another  forum,  such  forum"
"shall  know  the  basis  of  the  impugned  decision  to  ascertain  its"
"correctness or otherwise."
