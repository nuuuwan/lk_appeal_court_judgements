"the other considerations, referred to above, which have also"
"weighed  with  this  Court  in  holding  that  an  administrative"
"authority must record reasons for its decision, are of no less"
"significance.  These  considerations  show  that  the  recording"
"of reasons by an administrative authority serves a salutary"
"purpose,  namely,  it  excludes  chances  of  arbitrariness  and"
"ensures  a  degree  of  fairness  in  the  process  of  decision-"
"making.  The  said  purpose  would  apply  equally 
to  all"
"decisions 
and 
its 
application 
cannot 
be 
confined 
to"
"decisions  which  are  subject  to  appeal,  revision  or  judicial"
"review. 
In  our  opinion, 
therefore, 
the 
requirement 
that"
"reasons  be  recorded  should  govern 
the  decisions  of  an"
"administrative  authority  exercising  quasi-judicial  functions"
"irrespective  of  the  fact  whether  the  decision  is  subject  to"
"appeal,  revision  or 
judicial  review. 
It  may,  however,  be"
"added that it is not required that the reasons should be as"
"elaborate  as  in  the  decision  of  a  Court  of  law.  The  extent"
"and nature of the reasons would depend on particular facts"
"and  circumstances.  What  is  necessary  is  that  the  reasons"
"are  clear  and  explicit  so  as  to  indicate  that  the  authority"
"has  given  due  consideration  to  the  points  in  controversy."
"The need for recording of reasons is greater in a case where"
"the  order  is  passed  at  the  original  stage.  The  appellate  or"
"revisional  authority,  if  it  affirms  such  an  order,  need  not"
"give separate reasons if the appellate or revisional authority"
"agrees  with 
the 
reasons  contained 
in 
the  order  under"
"challenge."
"The  object  underlying  the  rules  of  natural 
justice  “is  to"
"prevent  miscarriage  of 
justice”  and  secure  “fair  play 
in"
