"Petitioners sought to quash an arbitral award by certiorari. The"
"dismissal of the application was justified in this way:"
"There 
is  no  misdirection 
in  point  of 
fact  or 
law  which"
"vitiates  the  award.  There  is  no  failure  on  the  part  of  the"
"arbitrator to take into consideration the effect of the totality"
"of  the  oral  and  documentary  evidence  placed  before  him"
"and there is no improper evaluation of the evidence placed"
"before  the  arbitrator  on  a  consideration  of  the  award  and"
"the 
totality  of 
the  evidence  placed  before  him 
in 
this"
"matter.139"
