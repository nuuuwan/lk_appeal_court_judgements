"66(1) of the Army Rules (which is analogous to Regulation 108 of"
"our Regulations) stated as follows:"
"Rule 
66(1) 
requires 
reasons 
to 
be 
recorded 
for 
its"
"recommendation 
in 
cases  where 
the 
court  makes 
a"
"recommendation  to  mercy.  There  is  no  such  requirement  in"
"other  provisions 
relating 
to 
recording  of 
findings  and"
"sentence. Rule 66(1) proceeds on the basis that there is no"
"such requirement because  if such a requirement  was  there"
"it  would  not  have  been  necessary 
to  have  a  specific"
"provision for recording of reasons for the recommendation to"
"mercy.  The  said  provisions  thus  negative  a  requirement  to"
"give  reasons  for 
its  finding  and  sentence  by 
the  court-"
"martial  and  reasons  are  required  to  be  recorded  only  in"
"cases  where  the  court-martial  makes  a  recommendation  to"
"mercy. In our opinion, therefore, at the stage of recording of"
"findings  and  sentence  the  court-martial  is  not  required  to"
"record 
its  reasons  and  at 
that  stage  reasons  are  only"
