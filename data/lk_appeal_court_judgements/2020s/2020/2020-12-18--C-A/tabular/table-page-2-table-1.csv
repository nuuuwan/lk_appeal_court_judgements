"This 
is  an  application 
in  Revision  against 
the  order  dated  28.04.2016  of  the 
learned"
"Magistrate  of Colombo  in  case  No.  63095 / 5/10.  The  Applicant-Respondent,  the  General"
"(""Respondent"") 
Manager-
Department  of  Railways 
instituted  proceedings  under 
the"
"provisions  of the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of Possession)  Act  No.7  of 1979,  as  amended,"
"[""State  Lands 
(Recovery  of  Possession)  Act"") 
to  evict 
the  Respondent-I""  Petitioner"
"(""Petitioner"")  from 
the  land  more fully  described  in 
the  schedule  of the  quit  notice.  The"
"subject land is a State land and is  a Railway reserve and that fact had not been challenged by"
"the Petitioner."
"The Petitioner claims  that he is  a businessman who  along with  his  wife,  has  entered into a"
"Lease  Agreement  with  the  CWE  (Co-Operative  Wholesale  Establishment)  to  occupy  the"
"premises  in  question.  He  has  annexed  two  such  agreements  marked  as  P2  and  P4.  The"
"Petitioner  states 
that  he  has  paid  rents 
to  CWE  under 
the  respective  agreements  and"
"accordingly 
is  not  an  unauthorized  occupant  of the  subject  land.  Upon  perusal  of the"
"documents  annexed  to  the  Petition  of the  Petitioner,  it  appears  that  the  CWE  was  also"
"occupying the subject land on rent basis."
"At the  inquiry in  the Magistrate's Court,  the  above  named Petitioner has  submitted that he"
"had cause  to  show against the  issue  of an order  for  ejectment.  The  reasons  tendered to  the"
"Magistrate's Court are at pages  19 and 20  of the set of documents marked as  P6, annexed to"
"the Petition. The only defence taken up therein by  the Petitioner is  that;"
