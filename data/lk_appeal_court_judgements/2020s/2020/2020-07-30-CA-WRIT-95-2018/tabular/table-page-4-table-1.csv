"I
t 
is  not  explicitly  clear 
from  P2  and  P3  whether 
the  1st"
"Respondent was the nominated successor to the land at the time"
"of Wijeratneâ€™s demise. In any event, whether or not the spouse of"
"the  permit  holder  is  nominated  as  the  successor,  in  terms  of"
"section  48A(1)  of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance,  the  spouse"
"of the permit holder is entitled to succeed to the land.  However,"
"according to subsections (1) and (2) of section 68, a spouse or a"
"nominee, respectively, who does not enter into possession of the"
"land within six months of the death of the permit holder fails to"
"succeed to the land.  The Petitioner says the 1st Respondent, by"
"her  own  admission,  did  not  enter  into  possession  of  the  land"
"within the said period.1  In my view, it is too late in the day for"
"the Petitioner to challenge the succession of the 1st Respondent,"
"as  the  8th  Respondent  recognised  the  1st  Respondent  as  having"
"succeeded to the land in 1996.2"
"According to section 46(1) and (2), without the written consent of"
"the  Government  Agent, 
the  permit  holder 
is  debarred 
from"
"disposing  of  the  permit  land.    In  terms  of  section  46(3),  if  the"
"permit  holder  does  so,  such  disposition  is  null  and  void.    In"
"terms of section 48A(3), if the spouse does so upon succession,"
"the result is the same."
"The Petitioner by tendering inter alia P8 and P12 alleges the 1st"
"Respondent sold the land in dispute to third parties for valuable"
"consideration.  By P8, ex facie, the high land was sold to a third"
"party.    By  P12,  ex  facie,  the  paddy  land  was  sold  to  the  2nd"
"Respondent.   The  1st and 2nd  Respondents deny  this allegation."
