"I
n my view, it was wrong on the part of the 3rd-8th Respondents"
"to have shirked their statutory  duty to  hold an inquiry into the"
"complaint  of  the  Petitioner  and  make  a  determination  on  the"
"matter 
in  terms  of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance. 
  The"
"District Court action could not have been a bar to it."
"I  must  also  mention  the  District  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to"
"inquire  into  the  cancellation  of  a  permit,  as  there  is  a  special"
"procedure 
laid  down 
in 
the  Land  Development  Ordinance"
"governing this matter.   However, I must add,  the  District Court"
"action  was  not  in  relation  to  any  attempt  to  cancel  the  permit,"
"but  rather  against  the  eviction  of  the  2nd  Respondent  from  the"
"paddy land."
"During the pendency of the District Court action filed by the 1st"
"Respondent,  the  Petitioner  filed  this  application  in  this  Court"
"seeking predominantly to quash by certiorari the decision of any"
"one or more  of the  3rd-8th Respondents to issue  a permit to the"
"1st  Respondent 
in 
respect 
of 
the  paddy 
land 
or, 
in 
the"
"alternative,  to  compel  the  said  Respondents  by  mandamus  to"
"cancel  the  permit  already  issued  to  the  1st  Respondent. 
  In"
"addition, the Petitioner seeks to compel the said Respondents by"
"mandamus  to 
issue  a  permit  to  the  said 
land  to  the  most"
"suitable person in terms of the law.  If the Petitionerâ€™s complaint"
"is  proven,  succession  shall  be  decided  in  terms  of  section  72"
"read with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule to the Land Development"
"Ordinance."
