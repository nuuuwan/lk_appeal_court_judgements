"The concept of Adverse Title or Independent Title in terms of Section  3 of the Prescription"
"Ordinance is  that the possession  on  which the prescriptive title is  based  on  must be  'by a"
"title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in  such  action'."
"In CoorayVs. Perera 45 NLR455; the concept of adverse  possession  was explained;"
"'Where a person obtains a transfer of the entirety of a property from a co-owner, his possession is that of"
"a co-owner, and it does not become adverse without proof of ouster or something equivalent to ouster."
"There must be a corporeal occupation of land attended with a manifest intention to hold & continue it."
"It is the intention to claim title against all other persons which makes the possession of the"
"holder of the land adverse."""
