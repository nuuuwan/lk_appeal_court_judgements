"upon  which  the  Court  and  all 
its  members  have  reached  an 
interim"
"agreement  can  nevertheless  be  altered.  After  it  has  been  announced,  in"
"whatever form it be announced, it cannot be altered."
"I
 therefore hold that the decision of July 1, 1980, was not a decision of all"
"three members of the Court. Though I think it unlikely that the Chairman"
"would have changed his mind if he had lived until July 1980, I cannot say"
"that he would not have done so. As I see it, the local valuation Court could"
"have announced its decision in February 1980 while the Chairman was still"
"alive, and said it would give its reasons later. If it had followed this course,"
"in my view there would have been a valid decision of all three members of"
"the Court. But that did not happen."
"(
2) Was the decision of July 1, 1980, valid as a decision of the majority?"
"The answer to this question is very much a matter of impression. Despite"
"Mr.  Horton’s  forceful  argument  to  the  contrary,  I  hold  that  the  decision"
"was valid as the decision of the majority. I have already said that the fact"
"that  the  Chairman  had  in  February  1980  indicated  his  agreement  to  the"
"decision which was eventually given in July did not mean that that decision"
"was  a  decision  to  which  he  was  a  party.  But  if  he  was  not  a  party  to  it,"
"both the other members of the Court were, and they remained consistent"
"in their views from February until July. Even if the Chairman had changed"
"his mind, the other members would thus presumably have continued of the"
"same  mind  and  the  decision  given  in  July  if  the  Chairman  had  remained"
"alive  would  have  been  the  decision  that  was  eventually  given.  Thus,"
"though 
it 
is  unusual  to  describe  a  decision  of  a  court  of  which  one"
"member  has  died  as  a  majority  of  that  Court,  it  is  a  decision  of  the"
"majority  of  those  who  heard  the  appeal.  Thus  in  my  judgment  on  this"
"basis  the  decision  of  July  1,  1980,  of  the 
local  valuation  Court  was  a"
"perfectly valid decision.”"
"A
lthough  the  reason  for  the  third  member  not  signing  – 
i.e.  the  death  of  the"
"Chairman - is similar to the issue before this Court – i.e. the retirement of a member -"
"the factual circumstances are not. It is clear that that Glidewell J was influenced by"
"16"
