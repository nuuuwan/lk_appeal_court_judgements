"ustice Wijetunga, who delivered the majority decision of the Court, held as follows:"
"â€œSection  3(2),  in  my  view, clearly vests the discretion with the President      as"

"appointment is made  is obviously limited to  the  interim  period  between  the"
"occurrence  of  one  of  the  five situations  mentioned  in  section  3(1)  and  the"
"President's  decision  as to  whether  a  new  member  would  be  appointed.  I"
"cannot,    therefore,  see    how    section    3(2)    can    operate    independently    of"

"members  that  would  constitute  the  Commission.  She  may  well  decide  not  to"

"place.  Then and then alone  can  the  remaining members  of  the  Commission"
"continue  and  conclude  the  inquiry. But,  the  factual  situation  with  regard"
