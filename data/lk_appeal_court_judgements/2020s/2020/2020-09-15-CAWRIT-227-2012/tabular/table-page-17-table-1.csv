"the fact that the Chairman had concurred with the views of the two members and to"
"that  extent,  there  was  agreement  by  all  three  members  to  the  decision  that  was"
"eventually delivered. No such evidence has been placed by the Respondents in this"
"application with regard to the involvement of Justice Somawansa."
"Q
uite  apart  from  the  clear  statutory  provisions  of  the  AAT  Act,  this  Court  is  not"
"inclined to follow the above judgment, in any event, for four reasons. The first is that"
"Glidewell,  J  did  not  give  reasons  for  his  conclusion.  The  second  is  that  Glidewell,  J"
"conceded that the answer to the question was very much a matter of impression. The"
"third  is  that  he  did  concede  that  it  is  unusual  to  describe  a  decision  of  a  court  of"
"which one member has died as a majority of that Court. The fourth reason is the fact"
"that  Glidewell,  J  was  influenced  by  the  fact  that  an  appeal  was  available  to  the"
"ratepayer  against  the  decision  of  the  Valuation  Court,  and  such  right  had  been"
"exercised."
"Taking into consideration all of the above factors and circumstances, this Court is of"
"the view that the AAT was not properly constituted at the time ‘P21’ was delivered,"
"and  for  that  reason,  ‘P21’  is  not  a  decision  of  the  Administrative  Appeals  Tribunal,"
"and therefore ‘P21’ is a nullity."
"T
he necessity for this Court to consider the second ground does not arise in view of"
"the decision on the first ground."
"T
his  Court  therefore  issues  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  quashing  ‘P21’.  The  appeal  of  the"
"Petitioner is remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a re-adjudication on"
"its  merits.  This  Court  directs  the  Administrative  Appeals  Tribunal  to  give  priority  to"
"the appeal of the Petitioner, and hear and determine the said matter expeditiously."
"This Court makes no order with regard to costs."
