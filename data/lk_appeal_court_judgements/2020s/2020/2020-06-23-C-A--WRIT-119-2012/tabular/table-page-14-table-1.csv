"as to the time at which the award shall cease to have"
"effect as provided in paragraph (a):"
"According  to  section  20(2),  giving  notice  of  repudiation  of  an"
"Award  does  not  make  the  Award  null  and  void  ab  initio.    It"
"ceases  to  be  operative  “upon 
the  expiration  of 
three  months"
"immediately  succeeding 
the  month 
in  which 
the  notice 
is  so"
"received  by  the  Commissioner  or  upon  the  expiration  of  twelve"
"months 
from 
the  date  on  which 
the  award  came 
into 
force”,"
"“whichever 
is 
later”. 
  Section  20(2)(b)  particularly  enacts  the"
"Commissioner shall declare in the Gazette “the time at which the"
"award shall cease to have effect”."
"This means, the Award is valid from the date on which it comes"
"into force, until it ceases to have effect on repudiation.  After the"
"Award  ceases  to  have  effect  as  a  result  of  repudiation,  the  new"
"terms and conditions between the employer and employee shall"
"be 
founded  upon 
inter  alia  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the"
"Award.    This  is  the  interpretation  given  to  the  section  by  the"
"Supreme  Court  in  Thirunavakarasu  v.  Siriwardena  [1981]  1  Sri"
"LR 185."
"The  submission  made  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner  “the  case  law"
"as  at  present  is  that  the  repudiation  is  prospective;  that  is  the"
"award  ceases 
to  be  operative  upon 
the  expiration  of 
twelve"
"months  from  the  date  on  which  the  award  came  into  force,  or"
"three  months 
immediately  succeeding  the  month 
in  which  the"
"notice is so received by the Commissioner whichever is the later”"
