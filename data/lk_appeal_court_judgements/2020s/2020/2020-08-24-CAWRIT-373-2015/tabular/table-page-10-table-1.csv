challenged 
in  CA 
(Writ)  Application  No."
"891/2005.  However,  after  the  death  of  Thiyagaraja,  his  successors  have  not"
"been recognised as tenants, and therefore, the question of offering for sale the"
"said house to the tenant does not arise."
"T
he  right  of  the  Commissioner  to  sell  the  said  premises  to  any  other  person"
"arises  only  if  the  tenant  does  not  accept  the  offer,  or  where  at  the  time  of"
"vesting, the house was not let to a tenant. None of the said situations would"
"apply  in  this  instance,  and  therefore  the  Commissioner  is  not  under  a  legal"
"duty to sell the said premises to the Petitioner. In the absence of a legal duty,"
"this Court cannot compel the Commissioner of National Housing by a Writ of"
"Mandamus to sell the said premises to the Petitioner."
"T
he situation that has arisen being outside the above two situations provided"
"for in Section 12(2), the Commissioner, when he called for offers for the sale of"
"the said premises has acted in the course of his general powers conferred by"
"Section  12(2).  Thus,  while 
the  source  of  his  power  was  statutory,  what"
"followed thereafter was contractual. As held by the Supreme Court of India in"
"Air  India  vs  Cochin  International  Airport  Ltd12,  the  “award  of  a  contract,"
"whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the State, is essentially a"
"commercial transaction.”"

"“The  next  question  that  arises  for  consideration 
is  whether  a  writ  of"
"mandamus  would  lie  to  compel  the  second  to  seventh  respondents  to"
"evaluate the tenders in compliance with the tender condition. The general"
"rule of mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to do"
