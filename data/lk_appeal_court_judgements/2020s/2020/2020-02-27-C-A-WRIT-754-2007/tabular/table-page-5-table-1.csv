"the conferment of power to such  authorities. This  is  in  keeping with the purposive approach  to"
"statutory interpretation. Anything that is contrary to or inconsistent with such  general legislative"
"purpose should not be held as valid by courts in an  exercise of statutory interpretation  [Uyanage"
"and Others v.  Gampaha Urban Cauncil and Others (1991) 1 SrLL.R. 1)."
"The  construction  of  a  hospital  as 
the  subject  matter  of  this  application  is  not  incidental  or"
"consequential to the permitted uses of Primary Residential Zone -
I.  In fact,  it is prohibited as the"
"relevant clause states ""Medical Clinic not exceeding 100 sq.  m.  in  extent""."
"The learned President's Counsel for the 11th Respondent submitted that the Kegalle Development"
"Plan  (P5)  was  amended  in  2016 which  identifies the land  belonging to the 11th Respondent as  a"
"the  construction  sought  to  be  done 
is  permitted.  This 
Mixed  Residential  Zone  and  as  such"
"contention  must fail on  two grounds."
"Firstly,  I have  previously  held  that  even 
in  writ  applications  the  rights  of the  parties  must  be"
"decided  as  at the  date  of the  application  [Tissa  Abeywickrema  and Others  v.  Mayar,  Badulla"
"Municipal Cauncil and Others {CA (PHC)  111/2011, C.A.M. 22.02.2019}) . Secondly, section 6(3) of"
"the Interpretation Ordinance is applicable."
"For  all  the  aforesaid  reasons,  I  hold  that  the  Planning  Committee  of the  2nd  Respondent  had"
"changed 
its  earlier  refusal  to  the  construction  and  approved  it  acting  under  dictation  of the"
"Secretary to the Ministry of Urban  Development and Sacred  Areas  and  as  such it is of no force or"
"avail  in  law.  Accordingly,  I issue writs of certiorari as  prayed  for in  prayers  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  to the"
"petition dated  29.08.2007."
"The  1st  and  2nd  Respondents are directed to pay Rs.  50,000/= each  as  costs to the Petitioner."
"For the avoidance  of doubt, this judgment will  not prevent the  11th  Respondent  from  making  a"
"fresh  application seeking approval for the construction of a hospital on the land  in  dispute if the"
"present Development Plan  for Kegalle permits such  a construction."
