"authority to  invoke  the  jurisdiction  of Court  on  behalf  of that  name.  It  is  imperative  as  a"
"preliminary matter to decide whether the  proper  entity is  before  Court.  This  has  to  be  so"
"done even if none of the parties raises a specific objection. 
It is an  inherent duty of Court."
"In  cases  where  the  entity gets  its  authority to  invoke  the jurisdiction  of Court  by  virtue  of"
"incorporation through an  Act  of Parliament (as  in  this case)  the Learned  District Judge  need"
"not look any further than the Ordinance  itself and  the Plaint (A7a - A7d).  The  name on  the"
"Plaint  (fact)  and  the  name  in  Section  4  of the  Ordinance  (law)  is  more  than  sufficient  to"
"determine such."
"When the Plaintiff himself claims succession to ""the American Ceylon Mission"" who is  not the"
"named  Plaintiff,  the  Learned  Judge  can  only  reject  the  Plaint.  The  Learned  District  Judge"
"accordingly  and  correctly  determined that  ""the American  Ceylon  Mission""  incorporated  by"
"instead  a  different  entity  on  the  mistaken 
Ordinance  No.4  of  1908  is  not  before  Court,"
"assumption that he is the successor to ""the American Ceylon Mission"" is  before Court."
