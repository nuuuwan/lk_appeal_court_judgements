"The  Petitioner  has  produced  letter  dated  12th  July  1994  (P5) 
issued  by  his  former  employer"
"wherein  it refers to his  period of employment as  9th  May 1973 to 30th  April  1993.  If this letter is"
"factually correct  Petitioner has  fulfilled  the requirements to  be  registered.  However, this  letter"
"has  also  been  signed  by the same  person  who issued  letter dated  10.08.1992 (R2).  He  does  not"
"state that R2  is  withdrawn or is factually incorrect."
"Here  then  the  material  facts  are  in  dispute.  In  Thajudeen  v.  Tea  Board  and Another [(1981)  2"
"Sri.L.R. 471]  it was  held that where the major facts are  in  dispute and the legal  result ofthe facts"
"is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where"
"parties  would  have  ample  opportunity of examining the witnesses  so  that the Court  would  be"
"better able to judge which version  is correct, a writ will not issue."
"The Petitioner is seeking writs of certiorari to quash decisions embodied in P12, P20,  P22 and P27."
"This application was instituted on  02.02.2009. The  letter P12  is dated 02.12.1993. The  letter P20"
"is dated 08.06.1999. The letter P22  is  dated 20.11.2002. The letter P27  is dated 30.10.2008."
"P27  is  not a new decision  but only a confirmation  of an  earlier decision  contained  in  P20  dated"
"08.06.1999.  The  decision  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Medical  Council 
to  reject  the  application  of  the"
"Petitioner  was  communicated  by  P12  and  P20  and  are  dated  02.12.1993  and  08.06.1999"
"respectively.  There  has  been  a period  of 16  and  10  years  respectively  prior to the  Petitioner"
"seeking the intervention of this Court."
"In  Biso  Menike  v.  Cyril  De  Alwis  and Others  [(1982)  1 Sri.L.R.  368  at  379]  it  was  held  that  an"
"application for a Writ of Certiorari should  be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the"
"Order  which  the  applicant  seeks 
to  have  quashed .  What  is 
reasonable 
time  and  what  will"
"con stitute undue delay will depend upon the facts of each  particular case. However, the time lag"
"that can  be explained does not spell  laches or delay. Ifthe delay can  be  reasonably explained, the"
"Court will  not decline to interfere. The  delay which a Court can  excuse  is  one which is caused  by"
"the applicant pursuing a legal remedy and not a remedy which is extra-legal. One satisfactory way"
"to explain the delay is  for the  petitioner to show that he  has  been  seeking relief elsewhere  in  a"
"manner provided by the Law."
"In this case the Petitioner has failed to satisfactorily explain the delay. What he has  sought to do"
