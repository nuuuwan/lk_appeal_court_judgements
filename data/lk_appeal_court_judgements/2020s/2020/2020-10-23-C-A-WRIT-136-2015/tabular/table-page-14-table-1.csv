"the receipt of ‘P11’, perhaps forgetting the fact that she had replied ‘P11’ by letter"
"marked ‘P12’."
"H
owever,  by  a  further  affidavit  filed  thereafter,  the  5th  Respondent  has  tendered"
"letters  dated  11th  November  2011,  25th  November  2011,  2nd  December  2011,  8th"
"January 2012 and 27th January 2012 marked ‘R5e’ – ‘R5i’, respectively. The dates of"
"these letters coincide with some of the letters that were sent by the 1st Respondent"
"to the 5th Respondent, although the contents are more or less the same. Thus, after"
"denying  the  receipt  of  the  said  letters  in  her  first  affidavit,  the  5th  Respondent  has"
"changed her position, and admitted receiving the letters sent by the 1st Respondent."
"H
owever, given the fact that the Inquiry Officer has recorded that the 5th Respondent"
"has  not responded  to  the  letters  sent  by the  1st Respondent –  vide ‘P8’,  ‘P8X’,  ‘P9’"
"and ‘P10’ - I find it difficult to accept the position of the 5th Respondent that she sent"
"the 
letters  marked 
‘R5e’  – 
‘R5i’.  The  result 
is  that  the  5th  Respondent  has 
lost"
"credibility  in  the  eyes  of  this  Court.  Be  that  as  it  may,  even  if  the  position  in  the"
"further  affidavit 
is  accepted, 
it 
is  clear 
that 
the  5th  Respondent  had  avoided"
"participating at the inquiry, and thereby deprived herself of the opportunity afforded"
"to her by the 1st Respondent of placing her side of the story."
"E
ven  then,  the  5th  Respondent  could  have  filed  at 
least  with  her  Statement  of"
"Objections, any material including photographs to demonstrate that she has in fact"
"not  erected  any  unauthorised  structures,  and  that  the  Inspection  Report  and  the"
"observations of  the  Inquiry Officer  in ‘2AR1’,  are  not factually correct. None of this"
"has been done. In my view, this is critical as the 1st Respondent’s decision to proceed"
"with an inquiry was based on the Site Inspection that was carried out by its Assistant"
"General Manager. Thus, I have no reason to doubt the findings of fact arrived at by"
"the  1st  Respondent.  I  am  therefore  satisfied  that  the  factual  situation  envisaged  by"
"the empowering statute exists in reality and that the Petitioner is entitled to a Writ of"
"Mandamus  directing  the  1st  Respondent  to  demolish  all  unauthorised  structures"
"obstructing the common elements of the said Condominium Property."
"I
 shall now consider the several explanations offered by the 1st Respondent as to why"
"it  did  not  act  at  the  request  of  the  Petitioner  and  implement  its  order,  in  order  to"
"decide if I should proceed to issue the Writ of Mandamus prayed for."
