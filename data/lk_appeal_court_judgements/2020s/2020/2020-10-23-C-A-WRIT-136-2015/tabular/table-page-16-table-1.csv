"I have examined the plaint which has been produced with the second affidavit of the"
"5th Respondent marked ‘R5a’, and observe that the unit in question has been rented"
"out  to  the  5th  Respondent  by  the  Petitioner’s  predecessor  in  title,  and  that  the  5th"
"Respondent  has  not  attorned  to  the  Petitioner,  which  has  resulted  in  action  being"
"filed  in  the  District  Court  to  eject  the  5th  Respondent  from  the  said  unit.  What  is"
"important  to  note  is  that  the  premises  that  have  been  given  on  rent  to  the  5th"
"Respondent is Unit No. 3. An owner cannot give on rent or lease common elements"
"of  a  Condominium  Property.  The  complaint of  the  Petitioner  to  the  1st  Respondent"
"was with regard to a structure erected by the 5th Respondent in a common element,"
"which  fact  has  subsequently  been  confirmed  by  the  Inspection  Report  of  the  1st"
"Respondent, and  the  site inspection  of the  Inquiry  Officer.  Thus,  it is clear that the"
"Petitioner is not seeking to interfere with the tenancy rights of the 5th Respondent by"
"complaining to the 1st Respondent. Thus, I am of the view that the underlying dispute"
"between  the  Petitioner  and  the  5th  Respondent  is  not  an  impediment  to  the  1st"
"Respondent implementing its Order."
