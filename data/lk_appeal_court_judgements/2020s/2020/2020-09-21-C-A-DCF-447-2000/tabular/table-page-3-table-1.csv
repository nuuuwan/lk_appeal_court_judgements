"T
he Plaintiff in his evidence produced the statement made by the"
"Defendant to the Gramaseva Officer on 01.03.1991 marked X1."
"In  this  statement,  the  Defendant  denies  having  taken  the  land"
"from  the  Plaintiff  and  says  he  bought 
it 
from  Themanis  on"
"10.07.1977, 
for  which  he  has  a  receipt,  and  Themanis  had"
"bought 
the 
land 
from 
the  Plaintiff’s  husband, 
for  which"
"Themanis  has  a  receipt  dated  03.06.1975. 
  The  Defendant"
"further says he has not paid rent to any person in respect of the"
"land and will not do so in future either."
"The 
learned  District 
Judge 
at 
page 
3 
of 
the 
Judgment"
"misconstrues  the  said  position  of  the  Defendant  and  says  the"
"Defendant admitted in his statement to the Gramaseva Officer to"
"having obtained possession of the paddy land from the husband"
"of  the  Plaintiff  and  therefore  the  Defendant  has  entered  into"
"possession of the land on the leave and license of the Plaintiff or"
"her husband."
"It is settled law that had the Defendant entered into possession"
"of  the  land  as  a  licensee  of  the  Plaintiff,  he  could  not  have,  in"
"law,  questioned  the  Plaintiff’s  claim  to  ownership  of  the  land"
"unless  he  had  changed  the  character  of  possession  by  an  overt"
"act as the starting point of adverse possession."
"It seems the learned District Judge has assessed the evidence of"
"the Plaintiff as to  the  ownership of the land with the mind that"
"the Defendant is admittedly a licensee, which is not an admitted"
"fact."
