"meeting  held  on  21st  December  2012,  and  therefore  ‘P15’  is  an  Order  of  the"
"CAA."
"I
n 
the  written  submissions  of 
the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents, 
it  has  been"
"submitted  that  the  Order  made  by  the  Inquiry  Panel  derives  its  legal  validity"
"from  the  approval  granted  at  the  Board  meeting  of  the  1st  Respondent.  In"
"paragraph  6  of  the  Written  submissions  of  the  1st  Respondent,  it  has  been"
"stated emphatically that, “Any order and/or decision primarily obtained by any"
"appointed committee or inquiry panel derives its validity and legal effect after"
"the final approval made by the full Board of the Authority at a meeting held by"
"summoning  all  the  members  of  the  Authority, 
in  which  the  quorum  of  4"
"members.”  Thus,  there  cannot  be  any  ambiguity  in  the  position  of  the  CAA"
"before this Court that ‘P15’ must be approved by the CAA to have legal effect.9"
"S
hould the inquiry be conducted by the CAA itself?"
"S
ection  32(4)  of  the  Act  appears  to  suggest,  on  the  face  of 
it,  that  every"
"complaint must be inquired into by the CAA. This Court however observes that"
"Section 6 of the CAA Act provides that the Authority may, for the purpose of"
"discharging its functions, delegate to a public officer, such functions vested in"
"or  imposed  upon  or  assigned  to  the  CAA.  Furthermore,  in  terms  of  Section"
"8(n),  the  CAA  may  appoint  any  such  committee  or  committees  as  may  be"
"necessary to facilitate the discharge of the functions of the CAA."
"I
t is therefore the view of this Court that an inquiry into a complaint made to"
"the CAA can be conducted:"
"9 Vide paragraph 11 of the written submissions dated 6th March 2020."
