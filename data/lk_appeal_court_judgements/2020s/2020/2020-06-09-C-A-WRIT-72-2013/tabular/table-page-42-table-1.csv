"from the date of shipment, and until the arrival of the vehicle at the Port"
"of Colombo."
"The task that was expected of the Inquiry Panel was to inquire and determine"
"whether the Petitioner has breached an implied warranty that it shall exercise"
"due  care  and  skill  in  providing  a  service  to  the  3rd  Respondent.  Therefore,  it"
"was  important that the service was identified  first. For  this, the  Inquiry  Panel"
"and the CAA would have to go by the proforma invoice in order to determine"
"the terms and conditions subject to which the service was to be provided, and"
"thereafter determine whether there has been a breach of that service. To this"
"Court,  the  service  that  was  to  be  provided  by  the  Petitioner  consisted  of"
"placing  the  order  with  the  manufacturer,  effecting  shipment  of  the  vehicle,"
"clearing  the  vehicle  on  payment  of  charges,  carrying  out  the  pre-delivery"
