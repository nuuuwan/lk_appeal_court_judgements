"","“The  proper  authority  may  share  its  power  with  someone  else,  or  may"
"allow  someone  else  to  dictate  to","it  by  declining  to  act  without  their"

"","that the discretion conferred by Parliament is exercised, at least in part, by"
"","the wrong authority, and the resulting decision is ultra vires and void. So"
"","strict  are  the  courts  in  applying  this  principle  that  they  condemn  some"
"","administrative  arrangements  which  must  seem  quite  natural  and  proper"
