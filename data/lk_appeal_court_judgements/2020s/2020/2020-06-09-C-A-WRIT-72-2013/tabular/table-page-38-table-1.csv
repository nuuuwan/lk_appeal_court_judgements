"the  exercise  of  its  Writ  jurisdiction,  to  assess  whether  the  implied  warranty"
"was  breached.  The  duty  of  this  Court  is  thus  to  determine  whether  the  CAA"
"paid due regard to relevant matters, in arriving at their purported decision, and"
"whether the findings of the inquiry panel are reasonable."
"I
n exercising judicial review, Courts play a limited role and must be mindful not"
"to  substitute  its  own  decision  for  that  of  the  public  authority  who  has  been"
"conferred  with  the  power  of  making  that  decision,  unless  the  authority  has"
"disregarded material facts or where the decision is unsupported by substantial"
"evidence. In the words of Lord Bingham, ‘they (judges) are auditors of legality;"
"no more, but no less.’56"
"I
n deciding whether a decision is reasonable, the test to be applied is not what"
"a court of  law thinks or considers is reasonable nor what the proverbial Man"
"on the Clapham Omnibus would consider reasonable. Instead, it is settled law"
"that  in  considering  the  validity  of  the  exercise  of  discretionary  power,  the"
"Court will consider whether the power has been properly used, or whether the"
"authority has abused its discretion."
"T
he  test  routinely  applied  for  this  purpose  is  the  test  set  out  in  Associated"
"Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation,57 where Lord"
"Greene  defined  unreasonableness  as  ‘something  so  absurd  that  no  sensible"
"person  could  ever  dream  that  it  lay  within  the  powers  of  the  authority.’  The"
"famous  example  of  the  red-haired  teacher  who  was  dismissed  due  to  the"
"colour  of  her  hair,  illustrates  the  high  threshold  for  “unreasonableness”  that"
"was expected to justify judicial intervention on this ground."
