"The second aspect of the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is"
"that the imposition of the Levy cannot be done until the Order is published in"
"the  Gazette.  The  attention  of  this  Court  was  drawn  to  the  fact  that  even"
"though  ‘X2’  had  been  issued  on  22nd  August  2014,  and  the  number  of  the"
"Gazette in which the said Order was to be published has been stated on ‘X2’ as"
"being “No. 1876/42 dated 22nd August 2014”, even as at the date on which this"
"application was filed, the said Order had not been published in the Gazette. In"
"support  of  his  position,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  has  produced"
"marked  ‘X3’,  a  list  of  Gazettes  printed  by  the  Government  Printer  for  the"
"month of August 2014."
