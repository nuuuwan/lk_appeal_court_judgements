"I  am  unable  to  accede 
to  this  position.  The 
inquiry  officer  made  a  finding  overruling  the"
"preliminary  objection  of the  Petitioner  and  thereafter  held  that  there  exist  merits  worthy  of"
"summoning the parties for further inquiry. The  parties were summoned again on 25.05.2011 for"
"further inquiry on which date the Petitioner was  represented  by counsel."
"However,  it appears that further evidence from the 4th  to 6th  Respondents  have  been  taken  in"
"the  absence  of  the  Petitioner.  Although 
the  Respondents  contest 
this  position,  the  record"
"shows that such  evidence was taken in the absence of the Petitioner."
"Where evidence is  taken without the knowledge of a party and  without giving it an  opportunity"
"of responding to it, there is  no fair hearing [Taylor v.  National Union of Seaman  (1967)  1 W.L.R."
"532,  Errington v.  Minister of Health (1935)  1 K.B.  249]."
"Crass-Examination"
"The  learned  President's Counsel  for the Petitioner contended  that no  cross-examination  of the"
"witnesses  was  permitted  by  the  Department of Labour  and  as  such  there  was  no fair hearing."
