regard 
for 
the  observance  of 
the"
"law-Wade-Administrative  Law  (4th  Ed)  608.  The  result  of  a"
"restrictive  doctrine  of  standing, 
therefore,  would  be 
to"
"encourage  the  government  to  break  the 
law;  yet  this 
is"
"exactly what the prerogative writs should be able to prevent"
"(p.  609).  To  restrict  Mandamus  to  cases  of  personal  legal"
"right would in effect make it  a private law remedy (p 610)."
"These

the 
second 
requirement,"
"insisted upon by Tambiah J. i.e.: some personal interest in"
"the  matter 
complained 
of,  unnecessary.  But 
the 
first"
"requirement  ought,  in  my  view,  to  be  satisfied  and  it  is"
"satisfied if the applicant can show a genuine interest in the"
"matter complained of, and that he comes before Court as a"
"public-spirited  citizen  concerned 
to  see 
that 
the 
law 
is"
"obeyed in the interest of all, and not merely as a busy body"
"perhaps with a view to gain cheap publicity. As to whether"
"an  applicant  satisfies  this  second  requirement  will  depend"
"on the facts of each case. (emphasis added)"
