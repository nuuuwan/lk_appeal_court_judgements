"m
ade to re-arrest him. After he was released on 29.09.2020, the"
"Petitioner says officers of the Criminal Investigation Department"
"came in search of him  the  very next day.    The Petitioner  in the"
"said  paragraph  says  “On  30.09.2020,  a  group  of  officers  of  the"
"Criminal 
Investigation  Department 
led  by 
the  5th  Respondent"
"(Officer  in  Charge  of  Unit  III)  has  visited  Petitioner’s  residence  at"
"No. 29/01/01, Sarraj Tower, Fredrica Road, Colombo 06 and has"
"inquired  about 
the  Petitioner.  When  Petitioner’s  wife 
informed"
"them  that  the  Petitioner  had  gone  out,  they  have  left.”    In  the"
"same  paragraph,  the  Petitioner  also  describes  the  manner  in"
"which  the Criminal Investigation Department  came  in search of"
"him on 08.10.2020 and 11.10.2020."
"It 
is  noteworthy 
that 
the  Petitioner  has  been  evading 
the"
"Criminal 
Investigation  Department 
from 
the  moment  of  his"
"release.  Why? 
The 
conduct 
of 
the  Criminal 
Investigation"
"Department  and 
that  of 
the  Petitioner 
is, 
to  say 
the 
least,"
"unusual.  On the one hand, after the Petitioner was detained for"
"169  days,  there  was  no  reason  for  the  Criminal  Investigation"
"Department to go in search of him immediately after his release,"
"unless 
there  was  something  sinister  or  devious  about 
the"
"release. 
  On 
the  other  hand,  as 
the  Petitioner  claims 
in"
"paragraph  20(d)  of 
the  petition 
that 
“he  was 
released 
in"
"accordance  with the regular practice of the CID” after completion"
"of the full investigation, there was absolutely no reason for him"
"to avoid the Criminal Investigation Department after his release"
"and go into hiding."
