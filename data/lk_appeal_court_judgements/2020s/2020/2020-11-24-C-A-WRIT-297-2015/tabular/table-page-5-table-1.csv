"The 4th  Respondent states inter alia that;"
"a. 
The  Petitioner  is  not  permitted  to  fill  her  land  without  proper  approval  of the  1st"
"Respondent's Corporation,"
"b. 
the  reconstruction  of the  entire drainage  system  along  the  Buthgamuwa  Road  was"
"suspended 
temporarily  until  the  completion  of  the  1200mmp  underground  pipe"
"laying  by  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  which  is  part  of a  larger"
"project commencing from Bandaranayakepura Road to Mahaniyara Junction;"
"c. 
as  such,  the construction  of the stretch  of road  pertaining to the  matter would  be"
"completed  in  due course as  part of the aforesaid project;"
"d. 
in  any  event,  the  culvert  and  the  adjoining  canal  that  were  obstructed  due  to the"
"unauthorized filling of the Petitioner's land  (Lot  No.5)  is  different to the two culvert"
"and  ditch  on  Lot  No.2  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  20  of the  petition,  and  that the"
"aforesaid culvert on  Lot No.5  affected by the Petitioner's actions is  indispensable for"
"the purposes of drainage and channeling of storm water downstream"
"The  1st  Respondent's arguments in  a nutshell are contained hereinbelow;"
"At  the  outset the  1st  Respondent  submits  that the  documents  marked  ""P13""  and  ""13  (a)""  do"
"not contain any decision of the 1st  Respondent to be quashed by the Court of Appeal."
"The  1st  Respondent  claims  that  although  the  letter  marked  ""PlY  refers  to  a  drainage  plan"
"dated  28.02.2013  prepared  by the  1st  Respondent the said  plan  has  not been  produced  by  the"
"Petitioner.  The  plan  marked  ""P13  (a)""  is  undated and  it is  only an  annexure to the letter dated"
"06.07.2015  marked  ""P13"". 
Therefore,  even  the  letter  marked  ""P12"" 
does  not  contain  any"
"decision  of the  1st  Respondent  to  be  quashed  by  the  Court  of Appeal 
at  the  instance  of the"
"Petitioner. The  1st  Respondent further  submitted that the Plan  marked  ""P4"" clearly shows that"
"larger part of the allotments of land  depicted there including the allotment of land  marked  Lot"
"1 claimed  by the  Petitioner is  a Marsh.  Even  the  letter issued  by  the  Department of Agrarian"
"Development  marked  ""P4  (a)""  clearly shows  that the Petitioner's land  had  been  a paddy field."
"It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  in 
the  said 
letter  marked  ""P4  (a))"" 
the  Department  of  Agrarian"
"Development has  imposed a condition that the Petitioner should not fill up her land."
"It  is  the  contention  of the  1st  Respondent  that there  is  an  existing  drain  along  the  Southern"
"Boundary  of  Lot  5 
in 
the  said  Plan  marked 
""P4"",  which  connects 
to 
the  culvert  on 
the"
"Buthgamuwa  Road  opposite the said  Lot 5 and  goes through the Petitioner's land, and  the said"
"drain is  obstructed as  a result of the Petitioner filling up her land."
"The  1st  Respondent  states  that although,  there is  a problem  of flooding and  inundation  in  the"
"area  as  a result of the Petitioner's illegal  and  unlawful action, the 1st  Respondent has  not taken"
"any steps on  its own to construct a permanent drain through the Petitioner's land,  but has only"
"submitted  a drainage plan  to the 2,d  Respondent  Kaduwela  Municipal Council  as  shown  by the"
"letter marked  ""A12""."
