"land  of  the  Petitioner  despite  her  objections. 
However  the  Petitoner  emphasizes  that  no"
"material  of  such  an  actual  greater  good  being  served  was  not  established.  There  may  be  a"
"need  for  a  storm  water  drain,  however  nothing  to  establish  that  it  had  to  be  where  it  was"
"situated through  the  Petitioner's land.  The  Petitioner states that despite this total  absence  of"
"any  material supporting the actual existence of the greater good,  the Respondents argued that"
"private land  and  private rights ought to be sacrificed for the greater good."
"The  Petitioner states that if private land is  needed, for some greater good, then the only way to"
"obtain 
it  and  use 
it  for  a  drain 
if  need  be  so 
to  acquire 
it  through 
the  Land  Acquisition"
"Ordinance.  Once  the  Land  Acquisition  Ordinance  comes  into  operation  the  Petitioner  would"
"have  all  the  safeguards  in  the  said  Ordinance,  which  includes  objecting  to the  acquisition  on"
"the ground that the drain  is  actually being dug for the ulterior objective of facilitating the waste"
"disposal of the 4th Respondent."
"The  Petitioner  states 
that  however,  without  resorting  to 
the  Land  Acquisition  Ordinance,"
"merely on  evoking  public sympathy,  inconvenience  and  the  pseudo claim  of the greater good,"
"the  1st  Respondent  has  acted  arbitrarily  and  walked 
into  private  land  and  caused  harm. 
By"
"doing so,  they have  acted  completely ultra vires  and  acted  arbitrarily and  scant  regard  for the"
"rights of the Petitioner."
