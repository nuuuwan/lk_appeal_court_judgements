"T
he facts and circumstances of Suweyal’s case and this case are"
"totally different.  In Suweyal’s case, due procedure was followed"
"by the Appellant in order to have the dismissal of the appeal set"
"aside.    In  the  instant  case,  evidently,  no  such  procedure  has"
"been followed."
"I reject this submission made on behalf of the Petitioner."
"Learned  President’s  Counsel 
for  the  Petitioner  only  makes  a"
"collateral  attack  against  the  Order  of  dismissal  made  by  the"
"Appellate  Court.    Going  one  step  further,  learned  Senior  State"
"Counsel appearing for the 1st and 2nd Respondents submits that"
"a collateral attack on the District Court Judgment is possible, as"
"the District Court could not have gone into the matter presented"
"by 
the  Petitioner 
in 
this  application. 
  The  question 
is  not"
"whether  the  District  Court  could  have  decided  the  matter  but"
"whether  the  Petitioner  took  up  the  matter  before  the  District"
"Court,  and  why  the  Petitioner  did  not  challenge  the  impugned"
"Order made by the Minister by way of a writ application at that"
"time?  At the argument, learned Senior State Counsel supported"
"the  application  of  the  Petitioner. 
  However,  contrary  to  this"
"position,  in  the  statement  of  objections  of  the  1st  Respondent"
"Minister 
dated 
08.08.2018, 
the  Minister’s 
action 
is 
fully"
"defended and dismissal of the Petitioner’s application is sought."
"The  2nd  Respondent, 
the  Attorney  General,  has  not 
filed  a"
"separate  statement  of  objections.    I  reject  the  submission  of"
"learned Senior State Counsel."
