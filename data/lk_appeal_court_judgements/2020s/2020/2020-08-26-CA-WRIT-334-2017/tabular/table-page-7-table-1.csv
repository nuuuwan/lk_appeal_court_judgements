"L
earned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the Petitioner also submits that"
"the  Judgment  of  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  dismissing  the"
"appeal filed against the District Court  Judgment on the ground"
"of  want  of  appearance  is  null  and  void,  as  it  is  contrary  to"
"section  769(2)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code,  citing  Suweyal  v."
"Podinona [2017] BLR 100 in support."
"In the first place, the Petitioner does not seek such a relief in the"
"prayer to the petition.  However, this shall not be taken to mean"
"that had such relief been sought in the prayer, this Court could"
"have considered it in this writ application."
"A  Judgment  entered  by  a  competent  Court  cannot  be  attacked"
"collaterally.    There  is  a  procedure  laid  down  by  law  to  have  a"
"Judgment  set  aside. 
  If  this  submission  of  the  Petitioner 
is"
"entertained,  the  losing  party  need  not  prefer  an  appeal  against"
"the Judgment within the prescribed time but can challenge it at"
"the  execution  of  the  decree  or  in  another  proceedings.    This  is"
"not possible."
"In Suweyal v. Podinona (supra), the appeal was dismissed by the"
"High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal 
for  want  of  appearance  of 
the"
"Appellant,  as  in  the  instant  case.    Thereafter,  the  Appellant  in"
"that  case  rightly  filed  a  relisting  application  before  the  same"
"Court,  which  was  also  dismissed.    Then,  the  Appellant  filed  an"
"appeal  before  the  Supreme  Court  against  the  said  dismissal."
"The Supreme Court set aside the Order of dismissal and directed"
"the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  to  relist  the  appeal,  as  the  High"
"Court of Civil Appeal had failed to comply with section 769(2) of"
"the Civil Procedure Code in dismissing the appeal."
