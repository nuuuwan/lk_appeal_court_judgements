"legitimate  expectation  may  arise,  and  the  role  of  the  Courts 
in  respect  of  each"
"category of cases:"
"(
a) 
The court may decide that the public authority is only required to bear in"
"mind  its  previous  policy  or  other  representation,  giving  it  the  weight  it"
"thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course. Here"
"the court is confined to reviewing the decision on Wednesbury grounds."
"(
b) 
On  the  other  hand  the  court  may  decide  that  the  promise  or  practice"
"induces a legitimate expectation of, for example, being consulted before a"
"particular  decision  is  taken.  Here  it  is  uncontentious  that  the  court  itself"
"will require the opportunity for consultation to be given unless there is an"
"overriding reason to resile from it."
"(
c) 
Where the court considers that a lawful promise or practice has induced a"
"legitimate  expectation  of  a benefit  which 
is  substantive,  not  simply"
"procedural,  authority  now  establishes  that  here  too  the  court  will  in  a"
"proper case decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that"
"to  take  a  new  and  different  course  will  amount  to  an  abuse  of  power."
"Here, once  the legitimacy  of the expectation is  established, the court will"
"have  the  task  of  weighing  the  requirements  of  fairness  against  any"
"overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy."
