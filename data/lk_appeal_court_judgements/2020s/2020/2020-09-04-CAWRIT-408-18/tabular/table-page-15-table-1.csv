"“…the claimant's right will only be found established when there is a clear and"
"unambiguous  representation  upon  which  it  was  reasonable  for  him  to  rely."
"Then the administrator or other public body will be held bound in fairness by the"
"representation  made  unless  only  its  promise  or  undertaking  as  to  how  its"
"power  would  be  exercised  is  inconsistent  with  the  statutory  duties  imposed"
"upon it. The doctrine employed in this sense is akin to an estoppel.” (emphasis"
"added)"
