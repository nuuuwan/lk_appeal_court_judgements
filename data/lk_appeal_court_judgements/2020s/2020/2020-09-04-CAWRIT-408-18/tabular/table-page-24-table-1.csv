"Statement of Objections, the Respondents attempted to justify ‘P18’ on the basis of"
"the Petitioner’s medical condition."
"I
t is not in dispute that the Petitioner had been AWOL for 130 days in 2006. It is also"
"not in dispute that the Petitioner has a partial permanent disability. What is critical is"
"that these two factors were present (a) in 2011 when the Petitioner was promoted"
"as  Captain  (Temporary);  and  (b)  in  2012  when  ‘P15’  was  issued.  The  Respondents"
"have  not  taken  up  the  position  that  there  was  a  change  of  circumstances  between"
"‘P15’  and  ‘P18’  which  necessitated  and  justified  the  departure  contained 
in  the"
"decision in ‘P18’."
"I
  would  not  have  had  an  issue  with  the  said  explanation  if  the  Respondents  had"
"stated any events that transpired after ‘P15’ that would have resulted in the change"
"referred  to 
in 
‘P16’,  or  had  the  Respondents  at 
least  explained  the  change  of"
"circumstances after ‘P17’ that prompted the Army Selection Board No. 3 to do a 180o"
"degree  turn  for  a  second  time  in  December  2017  –  vide  ‘P18’.  Much  water  has"
"flowed under the bridge since the  AWOL incident in 2006, but what is important is"
"that  the  Respondents  have  not  demonstrated  that  there  was  an  incident  involving"
"discipline or efficiency between P17’ and ‘P18’ that resulted in ‘P18’. The Petitioner"
"has not had any disciplinary action taken against him since then, except the incident"
"in 2014 involving the admission of his child to the Defence College, which does not"
"appear to have influenced the decision, either in ‘P16’ or ‘P18’."
"T
he position is no different with the medical condition of the Petitioner. It is not in"
"dispute that the Petitioner has suffered from the said medical condition since 2008,"
"and 
the  Respondents  have  not  demonstrated 
that 
the  medical  condition  has"
"worsened since 2016 when ‘P17’ was issued, or that the medical condition prevents"
"the Petitioner from carrying out the duties entrusted to him. If the medical condition"
"of  the  Petitioner  was  an  issue,  one  would  expect  the  Petitioner  to  be  presented"
"before an Army Medical Board, prior to taking any decision adverse to the Petitioner."
"I
 have no hesitation in saying that the Sri Lanka Army has every right to reconsider"
"’P15’, where there is a change of circumstances which may warrant a re-evaluation"
"of the facts, or where the interests of the Sri Lanka Army demands so. However, as I"
"have  discussed  earlier,  the  Respondents  have  failed  to  demonstrate  either  of  the"
