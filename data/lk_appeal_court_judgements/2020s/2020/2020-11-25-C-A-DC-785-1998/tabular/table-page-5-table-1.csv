"As  regards  the  mode  of proof of prescriptive  possession,  mere  general  statements  of witnesses"
"that the  Plaintiff possessed  the  land  in  dispute for a number of years  exceeding  the  prescriptive"
"period  are  not evidence  of the uninterrupted and  adverse  possession  necessary to support a title"
"by prescription . It is  necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and  the question  of"
"possession  has to be decided thereupon by Court."
"In  the present case  it had  never happened ."
"It was  further held that one of the  essential  elements of the  plea  of prescriptive title as  provided"
"for  in  section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance 
is,  proof  of  possession  by  a  title  adverse  to  or"
"independent  of that of the  claimant or plaintiff. The  occupation  of the premises  must  be  of such"
"character  as 
is  incompatible  with  the  title  of the  owner.  Furthermore,  it was  stated  that,  where"
"the  evidence  of possession 
lacked  consistency,  the  fact  of occupation  alone  or the  payment  of"
"Municipal rates by itself is  insufficient to establish prescriptive possession."
"It  was  decided  in  Chelliah  Vs.  Wijenathan  54  NLR  337,  where  a  party  invokes  the  provisions  of"
"section  3 of the Prescription Ordinance in  order to defeat the ownership of an  adverse claimant to"
"immovable  property,  the  burden  of proof rests  squarely  and  fairly on  him  to  establish  a starting"
"point for his acquisition of prescriptive rights."
"The  Judgement  of the  District  Court,  accept  that the  Appellant  possessed  the  disputed  property"
"for  over  10  years,  but 
the 
trial  Judge  observed 
that  mere  Prescription, 
in 
the  absence  of"
"requirements 
in 
section  3  of 
the  Prescription  Ordinance,  would  not  sufficient 
to  acquire"
"Prescriptive rights."
