"denied  the  Plaintiff's title to  the  property and  the  Defendant  pleaded  that the  Plaintiff does  not"
"have  a valid  title to  the  land  and  premises  which  is  the subject  matter of this  action  and  further"
"pleaded  that the Defendant  is  having the prescriptive title to the premises  in  suit. The  Defendant"
"further pleaded  that he was  in  occupation and  possession  of the disputed property, for more than"
"30  years.  He  has  indicated  that  he  was 
in  undisturbed,  uninterrupted,  adverse  possession  and"
"occupation and thus the Defendant has acquired prescriptive title to the property."
"The  Defendant's  position  was  that  he  never  came  as  a  leave  and 
licensee  under  the  Plaintiff."
"According to the Plaint, the  Plaintiff stated that the  Defendant was  a leave and  licensee under the"
"Plaintiff himself. Thereafter the trial commenced  and the parties raised  their respective  issues  and"
"admissions.  Then 
this  matter  was 
fixed 
for  hearing.  At 
the 
trial  both 
the  Plaintiff  and 
the"
"Defendant  gave  evidence,  marked  their  respective  documents  and 
led  their  evidence.  The  trial"
"was  concluded  and  after submissions  by both parties the judgment was  delivered  in  favour of the"
"Plaintiff."
"Against the said judgment the Defendant preferred this Appeal to this Court and  we directed both"
"parties to file their Written Submissions after the arguments were concluded.  When this Appeal  is"
"pending, first the Plaintiff passed  away and  his daughter was substituted in  place of the Plaintiff as"
"the  substituted  Plaintiff  Respondent. 
In 
the  meantime,  Defendant  also  passed  away  and 
the"
"Defendant' s son  was substituted in  place of the deceased Defendant."
"It is  settled  law that in  a Rei-Vindicatio  action,  the  Plaintiff must prove  his title in  establishing  his"
"rights. The Plaintiff cannot rely on the weakness of the Defendant's title. In  this appeal we have to"
"consider whether the Plaintiff has established his title or not."
"It  is  important to  note  that,  in  De  Silva  vs  Gunathileke  32  N.l.R.  217  at  page  219  Macdonell  c.J."
"Citing authorities on  Roman  Dutch  Law,  referred to principles applicable to Rei-Vindicatio action  in"
"the following manner: -"
"A party claiming  a declaration  of title  must  have  the  title  for  himself.  To  bring  an  action  of Rei"
"Vindicatio, Plaintiff must have ownership actually vested  in  him. The right to possess may be taken"
"to include the ius-vinicandi, which Grotius puts in  the forefront of his definition of ownership. This"
"action  arises  from the right of Dominium,  by  if we  claim  specific recover of property belonging to"
"us  but possessed  by someone else. The  authorities unite in  holding that Plaintiff must show title to"
"the corpus in  dispute and that if he cannot, the action  will not lie."
"In  Wanigarathne vs.Juwanis  Appuhamy 65  N.l.R  167 Herath J.  stated that the Defendant  in  a rei"
"Vindicatio  action  need  not  prove  anything  still  less  his  own  title.  The  Plaintiff  cannot  ask  for  a"
"declaration  of title  in  his  favour  merely  on  the  strength  that the  Defendants  title  is  poor  or not"
"established. The Plaintiff must prove and  establish his title."
"It is  my view that, in the present situation the  Plaintiff has  proved  his case,  without relying on  the"
"weight of the evidence led on  behalf of the Defendant."
