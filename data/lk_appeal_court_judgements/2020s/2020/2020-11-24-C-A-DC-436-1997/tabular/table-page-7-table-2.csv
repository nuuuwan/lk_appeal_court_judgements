"belonging to him  situated  on  the  land  in  dispute. Deeds from  '15  V 1 'to '15  V 6' have  been"
"marked on behalf of the 15th Defendant in this case and the plaintiff has stated that the deeds"
"do  not belong to the land  in  question . The  testimony of the  plaintiff is  corroborated  by the"
"testimony of the 3rd  defendant."
"The testimony of the 15th Defendant stated that the land  belonged to him and the persons"
"mentioned  in  his statement of claim  on  the  basis  of the  deeds marked  '15V1  'to '15V6' . His"
"testimony stated that no cultivation had  been  done on  the land in question, that no building"
"had  been  erected  on  it,  and  that neither he  nor his  descendants  had  any ownership of the"
"disputed  land . At the time of testifying, he had stated his rights to certain cultivations on  the"
"land  subject  to this  case,  but at the  hearing  of this  case  he  had  not  raised  a'ny  issue  to  be"
"resolved on  his  behalf and  had  admitted that the cultivation should  be  owned by the parties"
"according to the surveyor's report. Further, at the time the surveyor came to this land, neither"
"the  15th Defendant  nor any of the  persons  mentioned  in  his  claim  had  shown  any claim  to"
"the cultivations or buildings before the Surveyor. This  15th defendant's claim shows that his"
"rights are 9/80 and  he has not produced a pedigree regarding the rema inder. According to his"
"testimony, his father, Baboon, had  been  living on  the land adjacent to the land  in  dispute in"
"this case and the two lands were separated by a village road ."
"Considering all the documents submitted  by the plaintiff in this case, it has been  very clearly"
"proved that the  land  described  by  the  heirs  mentioned in  those  documents is  not the same"
"as the land surveyed in this case and marked '15V1 'to '15V6'. The lands described by the heir"
"in  the deeds  appear to be  quite different from the boundaries of the land  measured  in  this"
"case . Therefore,  the deeds  presented  with  marks  '15  V l'to '15  V 6'  cannot  be  accepted  as"
"evidence  relevant to the subject  matter of this case.  Accord ingly, I am  of the view that the"
"pedigree  mentioned  in  the  statement  of claim  of the  15th  Defendant  in  this  case  or  the"
"evidence presented marked '15V1  'to '15V6' is  not relevant to this case."
