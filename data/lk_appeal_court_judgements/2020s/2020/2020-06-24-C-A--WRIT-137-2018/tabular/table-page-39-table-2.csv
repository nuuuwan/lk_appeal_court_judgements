"the following paragraph by Lord Keith in Regina v. Secretary of State for Trade"
"and Industry, ex parte Lornho plc:31"
"“The absence of reasons for a decision where there is no duty to give them"
"cannot  itself  provide  any  support  for  the  suggested  irrationality  of  the"
"decision. The only significance of the absence of reasons is that if all other"
"known facts and circumstances appear to point overwhelmingly in favour"
"of  a  different  decision,  the  decision-maker,  who  has  given  no  reasons,"
"cannot complain if the court draws the inference that he had no rational"
"reason for his decision.”"
