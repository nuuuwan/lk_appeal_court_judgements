"The duty to give reasons - The second tier"
"T
he  second  tier  at  which  reasons  must  be  given  is  when  the  1st  Respondent"
"conveys the decision of the Selection Committee to the applicant."
"T
he  2nd  Respondent,  by  letter  dated  3rd  September  2018  marked  ‘P17’  has"
"informed  the  Petitioner  that  ‘you  have  not  obtained  the  minimum  required"
"marks for Section 3.0 of your application. Therefore the Council decided not to"
"promote  you 
to 
the  post  of  Associate  Professor  /  Professor.’  While 
this"
"reasoning barely meets the threshold of adequacy, this Court would advocate"
"providing the applicant with a detailed analysis of the marks obtained, at the"
"time  the  decision  is  conveyed.  Quite  apart  from  the  administrative  fairness"
"that would be achieved by doing so, such a course of action is warranted inter"
"alia for the reason that an applicant is prevented from re-applying for a period"
"of two years from the date of his previous application."
"B
e that as it may, it is the view of this Court that the 1st Respondent ought to"
"have provided the Petitioner with a detailed analysis of the marks allotted to"
"him,  when  the  Petitioner  requested  such  information  by  his  letter  marked"
"‘R10’."
"T
he duty to give reasons - The third tier"
"T
his Court shall now consider the third tier, which is the duty to give reasons to"
"this  Court,  when  a  decision  is  challenged.  The  expanding  grounds  of  judicial"
"review,  particularly 
in 
the  areas  of 
irrationality  and  unreasonableness,"
"illustrates  the  active  role  played  by  Courts  in  demanding  accountability  by"
"34"
