"evidence before Court points to a completely different path to what was taken"
"by the decision maker, draw an inference that the decision was not taken for a"
"good  reason  or  that  there  was  no  reason  for  the  decision  and  it  is  therefore"
"not rational or reasonable."

"T
he Petitioner is faced with an extremely unfortunate situation. He claims he"
"should  be  given  two  marks  for  the  University  Award  and  an  additional  three"
"marks  for  his  book.  The  Senate  Appointed  Panel  and  the  Experts  Panel  have"
"not given reasons why they withheld the marks claimed by the Petitioner in his"
"self assessed application. The Selection Committee has seen the injustice that"
"would be caused to the Petitioner if the decisions of the Experts Panel and the"
"Senate Appointed Panel were followed but have been wrongfully prevented by"
"the University Grants Commission from rectifying the mistakes of the Experts"
"Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel. To make matters worse, the University"
"Grants  Commission  claims  that  the  marks  allotted  by  the  Senate  Appointed"
"Panel cannot be rectified, which, as this Court has already observed, is contrary"
"to their own Circular ‘R4’. And the final straw is the belated and misconceived"
"argument of the Respondents that the Petitioner should have acted in terms of"
"Section  86  of  the  Universities  Act  and  filed  a  complaint  with  the  University"
"Services Appeals Board, when the complaint of the Petitioner does not come"
"within the provisions of Section 86. Where does this leave the Petitioner, and"
"what is his remedy?"
"I
t is the view of this Court that the remedy lies with the Selection Committee,"
"who must discharge the obligation conferred on them by the Circulars ‘P3’ and"
"‘R4’.  Accordingly,  it is the  view of  this  Court that the  final  decision should  be"
"40"
