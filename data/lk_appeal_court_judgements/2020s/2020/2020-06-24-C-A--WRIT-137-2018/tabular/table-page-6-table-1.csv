"Colombo  and  others3,  having  considered  several  English  cases  in  this  regard,"
"this Court held as follows:"
"â€œThe  consistent  judicial  opinion,  therefore,  is  that  in  matters  which  lie"
"within the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities,"
"the  Court  has  to  be  slow  and  circumspect  before 
interfering  with  any"
"decision  taken  by  them 
in  connection  therewith.  Unless  a  decision 
is"
"demonstrably  illegal,  arbitrary  and  unconscionable,  their  province  and"
"authority should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of want"
"of 
judicially  manageable  standards  and  necessary  expertise  to  assess,"
"scrutinise and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions."
