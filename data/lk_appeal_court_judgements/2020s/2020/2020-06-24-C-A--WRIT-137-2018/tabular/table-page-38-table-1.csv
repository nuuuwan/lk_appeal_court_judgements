the  only  conclusion

this  Court  can  arrive  at

that 
the"

exus between the duty to give reasons and irrationality"
"W
here the reasons for a decision are not provided to a party against whom a"
"decision  is  made, that party may seek judicial review of  such decision  on  the"
"basis that the decision is irrational or unreasonable. As noted above, where the"
"Court is satisfied that a prima facie case has been made on the inference that"
"the  decision 
is 
irrational  or  unreasonable 
in  the  absence  of  reasons,  the"
"respondents have a burden to satisfy Court why such inference is not justified."
"The  absence  of  reasons  would  support  an  argument  that  the  decision  maker"
"has not afforded a fair hearing, which requires all relevant material to be taken"
"into  consideration  prior 
to  arriving  at  a  decision. 
In  De  Smith’s 
Judicial"
"Review27 it is observed that ‘Irrationality may also sometimes be inferred from"
"the  absence  of  reasons.28  When  reasons  are  required,  either  by  statute  or  by"
"the  growing  common 
law  requirements,  or  where  they  are  provided,  even"
"though  not  strictly  required,  those  reasons  must  be  both  “adequate  and"
"intelligible”.  They  must  therefore  both  rationally  relate  to  the  evidence  in  the"
"case29, and be comprehensible in themselves.’"
