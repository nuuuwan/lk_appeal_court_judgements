"courts function to look further into its merits.”"
"A
s  Lord  Hailsham  L.C.  has  observed,  two  reasonable  persons  can  perfectly"
"reasonably  come  to  opposite  conclusions  on  the  same  set  of  facts  without"
"forfeiting  their  title  to  be  regarded  as  reasonable.6  Similarly  Lord  Diplock  has"
"observed that, ‘the very concept of administrative discretion involves a right to"
"choose  between more  than one  possible course  of  action upon which there is"
"room  for  reasonable  people  to  hold  differing  opinions  as  to  which  is  to  be"
"preferred’. 7 As such, the test to be applied is not what a court of law thinks or"
"considers is reasonable nor what the proverbial Man on the Clapham Omnibus"
"would  consider  reasonable.  Instead,  it  is  settled  law  that  in  considering  the"
"validity of the exercise of discretionary power, the Court will consider whether"
"the power has been properly used, or abused. In the words of Lord Bingham,"
"‘they (judges) are auditors of legality; no more, but no less.’8"
