"reasons  for  the  marks  that  have  been  allotted.  Thus,  it  is  clear  that  the  two"
"sheets of paper of the Senate Appointed Panel does not contain reasons as to"
"why  the  marks  claimed  by  the  Petitioner  in  his  self-assessed  application  has"
"not been allotted for Sections 1, 3.2 and 3.3."
"C
ircular ‘P3’ specifically requires the ‘Senate Appointed Panel while allocating"
"marks  should  submit  a  report 
to 
the  Selection  Committee  regarding 
the"
"applicant’s  teaching  ability,  service  to  the  University,  profession, 
industry,"
"national development, community etc.’ This Court is of the view that the said"
"requirement 
in  ‘P3’  of  a  ‘report’  cannot  surely  be  fulfilled  by  merely  one"
"sentence."
"A
ccording  to  the  documents  annexed  to  ‘P15’  the  Petitioner  had  only  been"
"allotted  2  marks  for  Section  3.2,  even  though  the  Petitioner  had  claimed  8"
"marks.  The  said  documents  do  not  contain  any  reasons  or  an  explanation  of"
"the  basis  on  which  the  Senate  Appointed  Panel  allotted  2  marks  for  Section"
"3.2,  nor  have  the  Respondents  pleaded  if  the  two  marks  were  allotted  for"
"‘P12a’ or ‘P12b’,  or whether the marks are for both ‘P12a’ and ‘P12b’."
"T
he  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  in  her  oral  submissions  submitted  that  the"
"Presidential Award and the University award are for one and the same article."
"This  Court  is  willing  to  accept  the  said  explanation,  provided  this  position  is"
"correct. The  difficulty that this Court has with this  submission  is that it is not"
"supported  by  the  Statement  of  Objections  of  the  Respondents  or  by  the"
"Reports  of  the  Senate  Appointed  Panel.  Furthermore, 
the  Petitioner  has"
"denied this position and submitted that in the same year (2000), the Petitioner"
"also  published  three  other  papers  in  peer  reviewed  foreign  journals,  and  that"
"30"
