"","Panel. What then is the role of the Selection Committee? Circular No. 723"
"","sets out that the ‘final selection shall be made by the Selection Committee"
"","based on the evaluation reports and in conformity with the procedure of"

"","cannot  merely  rubber  stamp  the  marks  given  by  the  External  Experts"

"","provide  to  Court  the  basis  on  which  the  marks  given  by  the  experts  was"

"","issues,  it  is  prudent  that  the  Selection  Committee  consults  the  External"
