"b)","A distinction is drawn between evaluation and selection. Thus, the role of"
"","the  Experts  Panel  and  the  Senate  Appointed  Panel  is  to  carry  out  an"
"","extensive  evaluation  of  the  application,  and submit its  evaluation  sheets"
"","and reports to the Selection Committee."
"c
)","The task of selection is with the Selection Committee. The said Committee"
"","would  have  the  benefit  of  the  aforementioned  evaluation  sheets  and"
"","reports, as well as the opportunity of listening to the applicant, whenever"
"","the applicant has qualified by scoring the minimum marks. If it so desires,"
"","the Selection Committee can seek a fresh evaluation from a third expert"
"","reviewer."
"d)","It is the view of this Court that the final decision whether to promote an"
"","applicant to the post of Associate Professor / Professor is a decision that"
"","must  be  taken  by  the  Selection  Committee.  Of  course,  in  doing  so,  the"
"","Selection  Committee  shall  follow  the  guidelines  in  the  marking  scheme"
"","contained in ‘P3’."
