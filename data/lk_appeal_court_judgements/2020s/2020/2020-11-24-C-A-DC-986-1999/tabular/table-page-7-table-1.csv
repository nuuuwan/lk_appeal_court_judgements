"It is my view that on account of the totality of evidence the finding ofthe Learned Trial Judge"
"is  the only finding any judge could  have arrived  at,  in  considering the evidence given  by  the"
"parties."
"There is  no  basis  whatsoever for the Appellant to prefer this appeal except with the ulterior"
"motive of prolonging the finalization of this litigation wh ich in fact commenced on  or around"
"21st of April,  1993 and  at present it has taken almost 27 years."
"Therefore, the judgment of the Learned District Judge dated 15.11.1999, is affirmed . There is"
"no merit in this Appeal."
"Thus,  this Appeal  is dismissed with cost."
