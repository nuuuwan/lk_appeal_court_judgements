"said Sabha could not include the ""illegal"" road in the publications as it had"
"not been maintained by the said Sabha."
"In  respect of the  violation  of the provisions of Section 24(1)(b),  the"
"Petitioner  claims  that the 4th  Respondent Sabha,  having failed  to  comply"
"with the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in its failure to  demarcate the limits"
"of such roads, had arbitrarily bypassed the provisions contained in Section"
"24(1)(b)."
"According 
to 
the  Petitioner, 
statutory  provisions  contained 
in"
"Section 24(3)  of the said  Act too  had been violated by the 4th  Respondent,"
"in  its  failure  to  serve  notice on the  Petitioner  in  terms  of the  said  section"
"since the said section ""necessarily  contemplates  the  serving  of notices  in  terms"
"of Section  24(1),  and  therefore,  not only  is  Section  24(1) a necessary  precursor  to"
"the  process,  but  it  is  also  a  vital  step  in 
the  process  and 
is  a  necessary  pre"
"condition"" (emphasis original)."
"It is also claimed by the Petitioner that the 4th  Respondent Sabha had"
"failed  to  serve notices on her which is  in direct violation of  the provisions"
"contained in Section 26 of the said Act."
"The 1 st  to 4th,  5th  to 7th, 8th , 9th  and 11th Respondents have resisted the"
"application of the Petitioner."
"The  1st 
to  4th  Respondents, 
in 
their  objections  have  raised 
four"
"preliminary objections based on laches, failure  to  come with clean hands,"
"failure to follow Rule 3 of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules"
"1990  and  had  sought  to  challenge  the  validity  of  a  resolution  of  the  4th"
"Respondent."
