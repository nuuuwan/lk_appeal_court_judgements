"The  fact 
that  the  disputed  road  as  stated  by 
the  Petitioner  is  a"
"different  roadway  to  ""Kitulella  Horedola  Road""  is  established  by  the  letter"
"P20G) 
to 
issued  by  the  District Secretary/Government  Agent  of  Matara"
"Executive  Engineer  of 
the  Road  Development  Authority  by  which  he"
"informs  that  concreting  of  the  existing  road  would  facilitate  the  ""newly"
"cut""  road,  which is  of about 200  meters  in length,  which branches  off  the"
"said  concreted  road.  He further  noted  that  there  are  no  houses  on either"
"side  of the  said  new  road  and  it is  not suitable  for  vehicular  traffic.  This"
"""newly cut""  road  is  an obvious  reference  to  the one complained of by  the"
"Petitioner  who  challenged  its  construction 
in  the  Matara  District  Court."
"This Court therefore rejects the 1st  to 4th Respondents position that the said"
"photographs depict the concreted"" Kitulella Horedola  Road""."
