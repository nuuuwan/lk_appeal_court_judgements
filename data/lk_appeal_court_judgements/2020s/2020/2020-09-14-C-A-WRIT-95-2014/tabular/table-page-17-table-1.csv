"through the Petitioner's tea plantation was extended beyond her northern"
"boundary  continuing  through 
the  four 
lots 
that  had  been  acquired 
to"
"facilitate access to the villagers of Beragama to reach the main road."
"Clearly the road  that had been described  in  the resolution of the 4th"
"Respondent Sabha dated 08.06.2012 (R6)  refers to the road that existed over"
"four  decades and which  had  been constructed  upon  the strip of land  that"
"had been acquired  from  the Petitioner's  estate under the provisions of the"
"Land Acquisition Act."
"Therefore,  it is  clear  that these  different descriptions are in relation"
"to one and  the same road although they had been differently described by"
"the parties."
"If the challenge  of  the Petitioner on the validity  of  the extension of"
"time granted by  the Chief Minister with the issuance of R7  is  ignored for"
"the time being, then the resultant position would be that it had authorised"
"the 4th  Respondent to act under Section 24 of the Act No. 15 of 1987 within"
"the  extended 
time  period 
in 
respect  of 
""Horedola  Vitiyalagoda  Road/"
"Beragama  Horedola  Vitiyalagoda  Kitulellawatta Road""."
"But  the  disputed  roadway  is  not  in  respect  of  publicised  road  of"
"""Horedola  Vitiyalagoda  Road/ Beragama  Horedola  Vitiyalagoda  Kitulellawatta"
"Road""  but in relation to a different roadway that had been cut and thereby"
"branches off from  the said Horedola- Vitiyalagoda  Road at a particular point,"
"allegedly 
towards 
the  colony  with  a  different 
terminal  point  near  the"
"residence of the I stRespondent."
"In  order  to  consider  the  challenge  mounted  by  the  Petitioner  as  to"
"In 
the 
legality  of 
the  publication  made  by 
the  4th  Respondent  Sabha"
