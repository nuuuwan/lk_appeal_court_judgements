"The  shift 
in  approach  by 
this  Court 
is 
reflected 
in  Senanayake  v.  Commisioner  of National"
"Housing  and Others [(2005) 1 Sri.L.R. 182] where a divisional bench  of this Court considered the"
"validity of an  affidavit affirmed outside the jurisdiction of the Ju stice of the  Peace  who attested"
"to its execution.  Marsoof J. (with Wijayaratne J.  and  Sripavan J. agreeing) held (at page 184):"
"""I  am  of the view that the Court of Appeal  (Appellate  Procedure)  Rules  1990 have  been"
"formulated  to facilitate  the  judicial  process  and  with  a view  of achieving  justice  rather"
"than  injustice.  It appears from  Rule  3(14) that is contemplated that where there is  some"
"non-compliance  with  the  Rules, 
the  Registrar  should  put  it  up  the  application  for  an"
"order of Court. """
"In  Gita  Fonseka  v.  The  Monetary  Baard af Central  Bank  of Sri  Lanka  (supra)  Wijayaratne J.  did"
"consider the  application  of Rule  3(14)  of the  1990 Rules  but held  that even  where the  registry"
"has 
failed 
to  comply  with 
this 
rule, 
it  cannot 
rectify 
the 
fault 
that  occurred  when 
the"
"respondent  failed  to  comply  with  the  rules.  It  appears  to  me  that  Wijayaratne  J.  appears to"
"have  softened  this  approach  in  Senanayake  v.  Commisioner  of National  Housing  and  Others"
"(supra)  when  he  agreed with  Marsoof J. and  Sripavan J.  more than one year after Gita  Fonseka"
"v.  The  Monetary Board af Central Bank of Sri Lanka  (supra)."
"In  my  view, 
the  approach 
taken 
(supra) 
in  Ranaweera  v.  Mahaweli  Authority  of Sri  Lanka"
"reflects the correct approach to the failure to fi le a statement of objections. The  Petitioner who"
"complains  of the  failure  to  comply  with  the  1990  Rules  must  in  the  first  place  comply  with"
"them.  By 
filing  counter  objections,  he  ha s  waived 
the  right 
to  take  objection 
to  the  non"
"compliance of the rule s by the Respondents . The  preliminary objection is overruled ."
