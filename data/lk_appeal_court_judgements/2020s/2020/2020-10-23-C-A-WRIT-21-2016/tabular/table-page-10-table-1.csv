"the  State  does  not  intend  to  treat  the  citizen  unfairly.  It  may  of  course  be  a"
"vexed question what, in the particular circumstances, fairness requires. But the"
"so-called  rules  of  natural  justice  have  traditionally  been  held  to  demand,  first,"
"that the  mind of  the decision-maker should not be  tainted by bias  or  personal"
"interest (he must not  be  a judge  in his  own cause) and, secondly,  that anyone"
"who is liable to have an adverse decision made against him should have a right"
"to be heard (a rule the venerability of which is vouched by its Latin version: audi"
"alteram  partem,  hear  the  other  party).  This  is  a  principle  to  which  the  courts"
"tend  to  attach  great  importance,  and  it  has  been  described  as  “the  necessary"
"assumption on which to base an argument…that the court must supplement the"
"procedural  requirements  which  the  Act  itself  stipulates  by  implying  additional"
"requirements said to be necessary to ensure that the principles of natural justice"
"are observed… The decided cases on this subject establish the principle that the"
"courts will readily imply terms where necessary to ensure fairness of procedure"
"for  the  protection  of  parties  who  may  suffer  a  detriment  in  consequence  of"
"administrative  action.”-  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Environment,  ex  p."
