"I
 hold that the appeals P11(a), P11(b) and P11(c) constitute valid"
"appeals."
"According to section 79(6) of the Financial Statute, unless there"
"is  an  adjustment,  “the  Commissioner  shall  fix  a  time  and  place"
"for 
the  hearing  of 
the  appeal”  made  against  a  notice  under"
"section  57(1)(b)  and  a  proper  inquiry  shall  be  held.    A  detailed"
"procedure 
is 
laid 
down 
in 
section 
79 
running 
into"
"subparagraphs (1)-(13) regarding the conduct of such an appeal."
"An  aggrieved  party  can  appeal  against 
the  decision  of 
the"
"Commissioner  to  the  Board  of  Review  and  then  to  the  Court  of"
"Appeal.  The procedure is elaborately illustrated in chapters XXV"
"and XXVI of the Financial Statute."
"There  cannot  be  any  dispute  that  no  inquiry  contemplated  in"
"section 79 was held by the 1st Respondent in respect of the three"
"appeals marked P11(a)-P11(c)."
"Without  hearing  and  deciding  on 
the  said  appeals, 
the  1st"
"Respondent  could  not  have  sent 
the  section  87  notice  or"
"instituted  proceedings  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  to  recover  the"
"relevant penalties."
"However,  the  position  regarding  the  appeals  marked  P18(a),"
"P18(b) and P18(c) dated 08.12.2016 is different.   These  appeals"
"were  filed  against  the  section  57(1)(b)  notice  dated  23.05.2016"
"marked P15.  Clearly these three appeals, having been filed more"
"than  six  months  after  the  P15  notice,  are  out  of  time.    These"
"three  appeals  cannot  be  regarded  as  valid  appeals.    The  appeal"
"marked  P19  dated  22.02.2017  also  cannot  be  regarded  as  a"
"valid appeal for the same reason."
