"The judgment of Arumugam v  Range Forest Officer (1986)  2 Sri  L.R.  398"
"considered  this  very  issue.  It  was  an  appeal  where  the  ground  of  appeal  was"
"raised upon the basis that the trial judge had permitted inadmissible evidence of"
"the  accused's  bad  character,  that  the accused  had  been convicted  of an  offence"
"previously,  into  the  record  and  this  was  prejudicial  to  the  accused's  right  to"
"getting a fair trial."
