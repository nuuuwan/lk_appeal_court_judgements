"The  probability of the  prosecution case is  challenged  by  the  Appellant by"
"placing reliance on the conduct of the detecting officer. The fact that there was no"
"clear information conveyed to  him in at the initial stage by the private informant"
"could  be  understood  easily 
as 
the  agreement  was 
that 
the 
informant 
to"
"personally lead  the officers  to  the woman who was involved in the Heroin trade."
"The  inclusion  of  a  woman  police  constable 
in  the 
team  supports  the  initial"
"information about a  woman. The number of officers who left the PNB office and"
"only 
two  of 
them 
took  part 
in 
the  detection  cannot  be  considered  as  an"
"improbability without that aspect being probed during cross-examination. In the"
"absence  of  an  explanation  by  the  witness,  if this  Court  were  to  consider  the"
"probability  or  improbability  on  inferred 
explanations, 
it  would  be  a  mere"
"conjectural exercise."
