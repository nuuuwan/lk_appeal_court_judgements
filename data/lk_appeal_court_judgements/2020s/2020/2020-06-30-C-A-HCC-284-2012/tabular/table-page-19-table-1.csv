"","In  view  of  reasoning  in  this  precedent,  this  Court must then consider  the"
"","question, in this  particular instance, whether the trial  Court had merely allowed"
"","the irrelevant item  of evidence into  its  record  or  had  used  it  in  its  judgment in"
"","finding the Appellant's  guilt as she complains."
"","Perusal  of  the  impugned  judgment reveals  that  the  trial  Court made  two"
"","reference to the earlier incident where the Appellant was already facing a charge."
"","In  the  narration  of  her  evidence  it  is  mentioned  that  she  has  a  pending  case,"
"","which 
is  understandable  since 
it's  a  mere 
reproduction  of  her  evidence 
in"
"","summary form.  The other instance where this item of evidence  was referred to is"
"","at the  evaluation of  the  trial  Court of  the  Appellant's  evidence.  In  that instance"
"","the  reference  made  by  the  trial  Court  confines  to 
the  fact  that  on  that  earlier"
"","occasion  she  had  placed  her  thumb  impression  in  sealing  the  parcels  due  to"
"","physical assault."
"","The trial was taken before a Judge of the High Court, and not before a jury"
"","is  also a  relevant factor  in this context.  Undoubtedly  the learned  trial Judge was"
"","aware  of 
the  prohibition 
in  Section  54  of 
the  Evidence  Ordinance  and 
the"
"","conviction  is  clearly  based  on  the  large  volume  of  evidence  properly  received."
"","Since there was not even of a  hint of prejudice caused to the Appellant as a result"
"","of  the  complained  misreception  of  evidence  or  that  the  misreceived 
items  of"
"","evidence was  utilised in finding her guilty,  this Court is  of the considered view"
"","that the misreception will not vitiate the otherwise sound conviction."
