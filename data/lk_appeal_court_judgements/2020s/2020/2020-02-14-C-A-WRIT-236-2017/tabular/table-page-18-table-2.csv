"constitutes an usurpation of the powers of the Excise officers who"
"have been duly appointed;"
"It  is  clear  there  are  contradictions  inter  se  and  per  se!    Writ  being  a"
"discretionary remedy, the conduct of the party applying is relevant."
"I see no illegality or  ultra vires of the Excise Ordinance or usurpation"
"of  powers  of  the  Minister 
in  setting  up  Special  Operations  Units"
"comprising  Excise  Officers,  as  contemplated 
in  P12,  which  was"
"adopted  by  the  then  Commissioner  General  of  Excise  (and  is  now"
"admittedly  defunct),  as  a  temporary  internal  arrangement  to  bring"
"offenders to book."
"The application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs."
