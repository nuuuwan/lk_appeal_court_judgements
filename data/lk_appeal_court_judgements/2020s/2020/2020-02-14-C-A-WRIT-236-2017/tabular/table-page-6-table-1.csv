"c
eased to be  in operation after Mr. Gunawardena’s tenure.   This goes"
"to 
show 
that 
P12 
was 
a 
temporary 
internal 
administrative"
"arrangement,  made  by  the  then  Commissioner  General  of  Excise  Mr."
"Gunawardena, which ended with his retirement or transfer."
"As learned State Counsel points out, P12 issued by Mr. Gunawardena"
"in  his  capacity  as  Commissioner  General  of  Excise,  is  addressed  to"
"Assistant  Excise  Commissioners,  Excise  Superintendents  and  Excise"
"Officers-in-Charge. 
  As  Head  of 
the  Department, 
that 
is  how  he"
"thought  successful  raids  could  be  carried  out  to  bring  the  culprits  to"
"book.    His  predecessors  would  have  adopted  different  methods,  and"
"his successors adopted and will adopt their own.  I see no illegality in"
"his actions."
"For instance, by the document marked CA-4 tendered by the petitioner"
"with his counter affidavit to fortify his case, it is seen that when Mr. R."
"Semasinghe  was  functioning  as  Excise  Commissioner,  he  instructed"
"the  Assistant  Excise  Commissioners  to  deploy  Excise  Officers  of  one"
"area  of  authority  to  different  areas,  as  temporary  measures  to  effect"
"successful raids.  This, in my view, is akin to what Mr. Gunawardena"
"did in a rigorous manner.  But the petitioner has no complaint against"
"the directive in CA-4 issued in 2018.  Learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  petitioner  stated  at 
the  argument 
that 
the  Special  Units 
in"
"question  are  no 
longer 
in  operation 
(i.e.  after 
the 
filing  of 
this"
"application in 2017)."
"It is further seen by the document marked CA-5 that Mr. Semasinghe"
"had  also  set  targets  to  be  achieved  by  Excise  Officers  with  respect  to"
"conducting raids.  The petitioner is critical of this approach, saying it"
"induces Excise Officers  to conduct  raids with collateral or extraneous"
