"B
y item 4(1) of P13, the Minister has given the authority to the Excise"
"Commissioner 
to 
assign 
duties 
to 
the  Officers 
of 
the  Excise"
"Department if they have not been specifically provided for."
"The  Excise  Officers  to  whom  P12  was  addressed  had  already  been"
"given  powers  by 
the  Minister 
to 
conduct 
raids. 
  By  P12, 
the"
"Commissioner General of Excise only allocated duties to such Officers"
"as a temporary measure.  This is in consonance with the scheme of the"
"Excise  Ordinance. 
  There 
is  no  usurpation  of  the  powers  of  the"
"Minister."
"Learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  drew  the  attention  of  the  Court  to  the"

"Excise Department.  This is clear by reading inter alia items 2(6), 2(7),"
"4(1)  of  P13. 
  But  the  Special  Operations  Units  challenged  by  the"
"petitioner comprised only Officers of the Excise Department."
"The petitioner tendered a copy of the petition filed in Case No. SC (FR)"
"219/2016  marked  P2  in  support  of  this  application,  stating  that  the"
"case  was  settled  among  those  petitioners,  the  former  Commissioner"
"General  of  Excise  Mr.  Gunawardena,  and 
the 
former  Minister  of"
"Finance. 
 
In 
the 
said 
case, 
the 
petitioners 
challenged 
the"
"establishment of a Unit headed by a retired officer of the Sri Lanka Air"
"Force by the Minister of Finance for the prevention of production and"
"distribution  of 
illicit 
liquor,  bypassing 
the  Department  of  Excise."
