"that  P-6  documents  cannot  be  considered  as  a government grant.  The  said  documents  speaks"
"only about that the government does  not claim  any right to the land  subject to the  present  law"
"suit.  The  request was  made from the government agent of Galle on  the 04th July 1908 by Jalatge"
"Leiris  and  others. 
If  this 
land  belonged 
to  Jalatge  Leiris  and  Babyhamy  only, 
then 
the  P-6"
"documents should have been written in  a different way. Therefore, it is  my view that the Plaintiff"
"position has been  proved by the evidence."
"Considering that document, it appears that it is  not a government grant, but a document stating"
"that the  government  does  not  claim  rights  to the  land  subject  to  this  lawsuit  at  the  request  of"
"Jalatte  Lyris  et al.  Hr 6 refers to Jalatte and  others. According to the plaintiffs,  not only Lairis  and"
"Baby  Nona  of Jalatte,  but  several  others  also  enjoyed  the  land.  Defendant  Aki  Rupavathi  has"
"admitted this in  cross  examination. Accordingly, it is  clear that the original owners in  this case  are"
"not Lairis and  Babinona of Jalatte, as the defendants claim ."
"The  plaintiff in  this case  and  all  the other defendants who  have testified  in  this case  have  stated"
"that according to the plaint, there are 9 original owners of the land involved  in  this case  and they"
"enjoy their rights."
"is  entitled  to  the  rights  of Gedohamy,  who  owns  1/9th  shares  of the 
The  plaintiff  in  this  case"
"plaintiffs,  on  the  basis  of the documents submitted  as  P-1  to P-6. There  is  no dispute about that ."
"However,  the  examination  of the  document  No.4 V  1 shows  that the  10th  Defendant  has  only"
"1/16  th  of  the  rights  of  Apsara.  who  owns  1/9th  on 
the  deed  4  V  1.  Accordingly, 
the  10th"
"Defendant  should  get  only  9/144th  shares.  The 
remaining  7/144th  share  should  be 
left"
"unallotted ."
"Although  it  has  been  stated  that the  rights  of the  10th  Defendant  has  been  transferred  to the"
"28th  Defendant,  the  relevant  deeds  have  not  been  submitted  to the court  to  prove  it.  I do  not"
"wish  to make any order in  this regard  and the 10th Defendant should  be  entitled to the aforesaid"
"shares."
"The  most important thing to conSider  in  this appeal  is  whether all  9 originals owners  are  having"
"equal  shares  or Jalathge  Lairis  and  Jalathge  Babahamy  is  entitle  for  undivided  Y,  shares  each."
"According to the available evidence, the learned  District Judge  as  accepted  the  Plaintiff's version"
"therefore,  the  contesting  Defendants  4,  SA, 
llA,  23A,  and  24A  Defendant-Applets  argument"
"cannot be considered  as  successfu l on  the evidence available before the Trial Judge."
"It  is  evident that on  the  17.11.1009 when  the case  was  taken  of trial  the  learned  District Judge"
"has specifically recorded the following sentence;"
"After the said  settlement was  recorded  the  Learned  Counsel  who appeared  for the 4,  5,  llA, 24"
"and  25 th  Defendant could  have raised  an  objection if they were against for the settlement on  that"
"they. It looks like that they all  agreed  to get the shares according to the Plaintiff pedigree on that"
