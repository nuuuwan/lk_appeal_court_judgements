"According  to  the  points  of co ntest  raised  by  the  parties,  the  main  issue  was  with  regard  to  the"
"original  owners.  Point  of contest  number one  by  the  Plaintiff was  on  the  basis  that there  were"
"nine original  owners.  However, very significantly eight of them had  one  surname and  only  Lairis"
"had  a  different  surname.  The  contention  of these  Defendants-Appellants  and  one  to  thirteen"
"Defendants  was 
that 
there  were 
two  original  owners  called  Jalathge  Lairis  and  Jalathge"
"Babahamy who was  entitled to undivided  half each  share each.  The  said  Babahamy was  married"
"to  a  person  who  had 
the  surname 
""Korala  Pathirage""  and 
the  eight  of  the  original  owners"
"mentioned  by  the  Plaintiff  were  the  children  of the  said  Jalathge  Babahamy.  Therefore,  their"
"contention  was  that Jalathge  Lairis  who  has  been  named  as  one  of the  original  owners  by  the"
"Plaintiff,  in  fact was  entitled to undivided half share.  These  Defendant's pedigree emanates from"
"the said Jalathge Lairis."
"At  the  trial  the  Plaintiff testified  on  her  own  behalf  and  closed  the  case  producing  documents"
"marked  PI to P5."
"Thereafter, these Defendants-Appellants moved to call  a witness whose name has been  in the list"
"dated the 23,d  December 1998. However, the court did  not permit to call  the said  witness. It was"
"argued that the said  order of the Learned  District Judge  is  erroneous which  could  be  reviewed  by"
"this  Court even  at this stage.  This  is  a partition  case  where  paramount  duty is  case  on  court to"
"investigate title of the parties and  allow declaration. The  said  certificate of no claim  by the state"
"was  issued  on  an  application  made  by  Jalathge  Lairis  and  others.  Although  the  Learned  District"
"Judge  had  placed  heavy  reliance  on  the  said  document,  to  come  to  the  conclusion  that  there"
"were  nine  original  owners  who  had  equal  shares, 
the  said  document  cannot  be 
treated  as"
"conclusive  proof of the said  fact.  The  more prudent conclusion  of the said  document would  be"
"that the others mentioned there, in  are the children of Babahamy who had  a different surname."
"In  this particular partition case, there is dispute regard  as  to who the owners are even though the"
"Plaintiff  says  that  there  were  9  and  that  this  Appellant  says  there  were  only  2  but  the  same"
"parties in  the pedigree of the Plaintiff were to get shares the parties agreed that, the Plaintiff gets"
"1/9th shares.  After the  said  settlement  parties  cannot  revile  from  that settlement they  agreed."
"Now  in 
the  appeal  they  say  something  different  that  the  Plaintiff  should  not  get  1/9th  or  he"
"should  not get anything.  The  Defendants  are  estopped  from  denying what they stated to court."
"The  Appellant  says  that the appeal  should  be  dismissed  on  that ground  as  one  cannot  blow hot"
"and  cold."
"This  is  yet  another  reason  for  this  appeal  to  be  rejected  for  the  Appellants  as  are  seeking  to"
"mislead this Court without making any reference to the settlement arrived on 17/11/1998."
"The  Plaintiff-Respondents  has  been  mentioned  that after the  refusal  by  court  of the  application"
"made  on  behalf of the Appellants  to  lead  the evidence  of their witness,  they  have  not opted  to"
"lead  the evidence  of a party to the case .  The  Plaintiff says  that the sa id  subm ission  is  erroneous"
"because the 5t h  Defendant-Appellant has given evidence on  behalf of the Appellant's . 
In  the said"
"evidence  she  has  clearly  mentioned  the  position  of these  Appellants.  However,  the  Plaintiff's"
"contention  that  the  District  Court  need  not  go  on  a  voyage  of  discovery  tracing  the  title  and"
