"because the contention of the appellants was  clearly set down in  the pleadings,  in the issues and"
"in  the  evidence  adduced  in  the  case . 
It  is  the  grievance  of the  Appellants  that  although  their"
"is  established  properly  as  aforesaid  the  Learned  District  Judge  has  failed 
to  carefully 
position"
"analyze the pleadings and  the evidence and come to the correct conclusion. 
In  the circumstances"
"of this case the question of going on  a voyage of discovery would not arise."
"The Plaintiff-Respondents has placed  heavy reliance on  a purported settlement appearing at page"
"199  of  the  Appeal  Brief.  There  was  an 
indication  by  some  of  the  parties  with  regard 
to  the"
"undivided  shares  that  they  were  prepared  to  accept,  these  Defendants-Appellants  have  never"
"been  parties 
to  the  said 
indication  of  shares.  Further  no  party  including  these  Defendants"
"Appellants have Signed  a so-called  settlement. The  parties including the  Plaintiff-Respondent had"
"invited  the  Court  to  decide  the  case  on  the  points  of contest  raised  by  them .  That  position  is"
"further confirmed  when  the Plaintiff-Respondent,  in  the  middle of his  evidence  raised  the  point"
"of contest  No.17. That goes to indicate that there was  no such  settlement between the parties.  It"
"is  further submitted that even  if there was  a settlement between the parties the Court will not be"
"absolved from its duty of investigating title ."
