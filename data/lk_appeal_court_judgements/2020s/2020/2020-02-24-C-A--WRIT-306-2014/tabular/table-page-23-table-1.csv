"s
ection  39A 
the  Minister  has  only 
the  discretion 
to  make  a"
"divesting  order  and  therefore  such  exercise  of  discretion  is  not"
"amenable to judicial review."
"Nevertheless, 
for  completeness, 
I  must  state 
that 
in  modern"
"administrative 
law 
there 
is  no  unfettered 
and  unreviewable"
"discretion. Discretion shall be exercised rationally and reasonably,"
"not  arbitrarily  and  capriciously.  In  the  exercise  of  discretion,  the"
"person in authority shall do not what he likes but what he ought."
"I need only quote Mark Fernando J. at pages 293-297 in De Silvaâ€™s"
"case in this regard."
