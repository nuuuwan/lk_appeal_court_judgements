"Statutory power conferred for public purposes  is conferred as"
"it were upon trust, not absolutely—that is to say, it can validly"
"be  used  only  in  the  right  and  proper  way  which  Parliament"
"when conferring it is presumed to have intended. Although the"
"Crown’s 
lawyers  have  argued 
in  numerous 
cases 
that"
"unrestricted 
permissive 
language 
confers 
unfettered"
"discretion,  the  truth  is  that,  in  a  system  based  on  the  rule  of"
"law,  unfettered  governmental  discretion  is  a  contradiction  in"
"terms.  The  real  question  is  whether  the  discretion  is  wide  or"
"narrow,  and  where  the  legal  line  is  to  be  drawn.  For  this"
"purpose everything depends upon the true intent and meaning"
"of the empowering Act."
"The  powers  of  public  authorities  are 
therefore  essentially"
"different from those of private persons. A man making his will"
"may,  subject  to  any  rights  of  his  dependents,  dispose  of  his"
"property  just  as  he  may  wish.  He  may  act  out  of  malice  or  a"
"spirit of revenge, but in law this does not affect his exercise of"
"his power. In the same way a private person has an absolute"
"power to release a debtor, or, where the law permits, to evict a"
"tenant, regardless of his motives. This is unfettered discretion."
"But 
a 
public  authority  may  do  neither  unless 
it  acts"
"reasonably  and 
in  good 
faith  and  upon 
the 
lawful  and"
"relevant  grounds  of  public  interest.  Unfettered  discretion  is"
"wholly  inappropriate  to  a  public  authority,  which  possesses"
"powers  solely  in  order  that  it  may  use  them  for  the  public"
"good."
"There  is  nothing  paradoxical  in  the  imposition  of  such  legal"
"limits. 
It  would 
indeed  be  paradoxical 
if 
they  were  not"
