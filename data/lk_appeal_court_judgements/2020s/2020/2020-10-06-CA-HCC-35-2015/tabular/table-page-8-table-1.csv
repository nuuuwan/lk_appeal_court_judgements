"Another  ground  of  appeal  is 
the  failure  of  the  trial  Judge  to"
"consider the contradictions of the prosecution case."
"On a  perusal of the contradictions and omissions in this case it is"
"obvious  that  they  are  of  a 
trivial  nature  that  has  not  affected  the"
"credibility of the witnesses."
"Some of the contradictions that were marked are as follows;"
"In page  178 it was the evidence of PW1  that the business for the"
"day was not concluded in the liquor shop when  the incident occurred,"
"but the fact that it is recorded that the door of the store was closed and"
"PW  1 was counting money ,was marked as a  contradiction. (V  1)."
"In  page  186, 
in  the  non  summary  inquiry  PW  1  is  supposed  to"
"have  said  that  the  two  suspects  who  came  to  the  shop  sat  near  the"
"counter,  when 
in 
fact 
it  was 
that 
they  were 
the 
standing  near"
"counter.(V2)  ( emphasis added)"
"Some of the omissions highlighted are as follows;"
"In cross examination in page 400 of the brief PW 2  has stated that"
"when he hit the appellant with  the butt of the rifle,  one shot landed on"
"his  face  and  when  the  helmet  got  dislodged,  he  saw  the  face  and"
"recognized  the  suspect.  The  fact  that  this  being  not  recorded  in  his"
"statement 
to the police is highlighted as an omission."
