"compensation.  This  Court  is  further  of the  view  that  the  termination  of"
"employment of an  employee contrary  to  the  provisions  of Section  2(1)  of"
"the  TEW  Act  would  under  normal  circumstances  attract  reinstatement"
"there  con  be 
with  back  wages,  as  provided  for  in  Section  6.  However,"
"exceptional situations  as  have  arisen  in  the judgments referred  to  above,"
"which  justify  the  Commissioner  General  of Labour  making  an  order for"
"compensation.  This  Court is  therefore of the view that while reinstatement"
"with 
back  wages 
should  be 
the  norm, 
awarding  of  compensation,"
"depending  on 
the  facts  and  circumstances  of each  case,  should  be  the"
"exception."""
