"This  subsequent  allegation  against  the  2nd  accused-petitioner  was 
later"
"withdrawn  and  he  had  been  discharged 
from 
the 
relevant  criminal"
"proceedings."
"The  1st 
accused-petitioner,  as  evident 
from 
the 
record,  was 
in"
"remand  over a  period  of  almost  seven  years.  The  2nd accused  petitioner,"
"after  his  re-remand  order,  has  spent over  three  and  half years  in remand"
"custody.  It  is  correct  that their  freedom  was  curtailed  by  long periods of"
"legal  custody,  when  the  years  are  counted  from  the  date  of  arrest  and"
"remand."
"However,  it  must  be  noted  that  their  status  differed  significantly"
"during this period of time.  They were initially remanded  as  suspects with"
"the  detection  of dangerous  drugs. Then  when  the  indictment was  served"
"their status changed in to  accused from  suspects. Still  they were protected"
"by the presumption of innocence. After they were convicted, and pending"
"determination  of  their  appeal, 
their  status  altered 
to 
that  of 
accused"
"appellants, but no presumption of innocence applied. Then the re-trial was"
"ordered  and  the  accused- petitioners  have  returned  to  the  state  of  being"
"accused."
"When  the  appeal  of  the  accused-petitioners  was  lodged  after  their"
"conviction and sentence on 30.03.2017, as noted above their status changed"
"to  convicted  prisoners.  Until  the  appeal  was  decided  on 02.10.2019,  they"
"remain in the status of accused-appellants. Over this 31-month long period"
"they  spent  in  remand  pending 
determination  of  appeal  could  not  be"
"termed  as  a  period  pending 
trial  and  had 
to  be  excluded 
from 
the"
"equation. The trial  had  taken only about two and half months to  reach its"
"13"
