"A
s was said in Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department,5 although the"
"public authority may be better placed to investigate the facts and test the evidence,"
"the  Court  cannot  abdicate  its  responsibility  of  ensuring  that  the  facts  are  properly"
"explored, 
‘and  summarised 
in  the  decision,  with  care,  since  they  will  always  be"
"important and often decisive’.6"
"A
  consideration  of  the  second  and  third  grounds  urged  by  the  learned  Counsel  for"
"the Petitioner requires me to consider whether the evidence that was led before the"
"Inquiry  Officer,  marked 
‘P6’ 
in  relation  to  Charge  Nos. 
I  and 
II  was  given  due"
"consideration by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal."
"A
s observed earlier, the prosecution had led the evidence of the Officers of the flying"
"squad  who  participated 
in  the  detection,  namely  Susil  Chandrapala,  Lanny  Titus,"
"Ganepola and Jayasiri Silva. According to Chandrapala, the Flying Squad had received"
"information  on  2nd  November  2010  that  an  employee  at  Workshop  No.  42  by  the"
"name  of  Peiris  is  selling  narcotic  tablets  to  those  who  come  for  training  from  the"
"German Technical School. He had been directed to proceed to Workshop No. 42, and"
"carry  out  a  search  of  the  said  person.  He  had  accordingly  proceeded  to  Workshop"
"No. 42 with the other three Officers."
"H
aving  gone 
there,  Chandrapala  had 
instructed 
the  Foreman 
to  summon 
the"
"Petitioner to his office. Once the  Petitioner came  to  the  office,  either Chandrapala,"
"Titus or Silva had  searched  the  Petitioner and  found  in  the  right side  pocket of  the"
"trouser  worn  by 
the  Petitioner,  a  cigarette  and  a  substance  which  was 
later"
"determined  to  be  cannabis  wrapped 
inside  a  sheet  of  paper.  Chandrapala  has"
"admitted in cross examination that the Petitioner was dressed in the working attire"
"of a light blue T-shirt and a gray or brown colour trouser. The cannabis that was said"
"to have been found from his trouser pocket formed the basis for Charge No. I at the"
"Disciplinary Inquiry."
