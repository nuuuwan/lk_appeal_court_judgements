"two different versions relating to Charge No. II, and failed to provide reasons for its"
"decision  with  regard  to  that  charge.  The  decision  of  the  Administrative  Appeals"
"Tribunal with regard to Charge No. II is  therefore  liable to be quashed  by a  Writ of"
"Certiorari."
"I
 shall now consider the evidence placed before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal"
"with  regard  to  Charge  No.  I.  In  addition  to  the  evidence  of  Chandrapala  as  to  the"
"manner in  which  they found cannabis in  the  trouser pocket  of  the  Petitioner, Titus"
"had given detailed evidence in this regard. He states that the Petitioner was attired in"
"a light blue collarless T-shirt and a black trouser at the time they checked the trouser"
"pockets  of  the  Petitioner  and  found  the  cigarette  and  the  cannabis.  This 
is  the"
"clothing  that  the  Petitioner  was  attired 
in  during  work.  Titus  had  been  cross"
"examined  on  the  clothing  worn  by  the  Petitioner  and  his  position  remained  the"
"same, although he had later stated that he was not aware if the said clothing were"
"the working clothes of the Petitioner."
"W
hat  is  the  position  of  the  Petitioner  with  regard  to  Charge  No.  1?  The  Petitioner"
"states that when he reported for work on that day, he was attired in a blue checked"
"long sleeve shirt and a brown colour trouser. He states further that once he reported"
"for  duty,  he  changed  into  a  blue  T-shirt  and  a  black  trouser,  as  his  work  involves"
"working  with  machinery.  According  to  the  Petitioner,  the  clothes  worn  from  home"
"are  hung  in  a  common  area,  which  can  be  accessed  by  any  person.  The  Petitioner"
"states that once he presented himself before Chandrapala, he was asked to change"
"his clothes, which he did, and that the search of the clothes worn by him took place"
"only  thereafter.  While  the  Petitioner  admits  that  the  Officers  of  the  Flying  Squad"
"found  a  cigarette  and  cannabis  wrapped  in  a  paper  inside  his  trouser  pocket,  he"
"claims  that  the  cigarette  and  the  packet  of  cannabis  have  been  introduced  to  his"
"personal  clothing  by  someone  who  bore  a  grudge  against  him,  and  refers  to  the"
"incident  that  occurred  in  October  of  that  year  with  other  employees,  which  I  have"
"referred to earlier. The position of the Petitioner had been suggested to Chandrapala"
"during cross examination, but Chandrapala had claimed that the Petitioner had been"
"with him at all times.11 The Petitioner has been cross examined on this aspect."
