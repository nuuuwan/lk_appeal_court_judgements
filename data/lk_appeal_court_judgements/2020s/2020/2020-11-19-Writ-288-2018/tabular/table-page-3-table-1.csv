"places, they had not been weighed separately. As a result, the prosecution had only"
"preferred one charge for the entire quantity. The Petitioner had been acquitted after"
"a  lengthy  trial  where  the  Petitioner  too  had  given  evidence.  I  have  examined  the"
"judgment of the learned Magistrate delivered on 15th September 2015, and find that"
"the Petitioner had been acquitted as the prosecution had failed to establish that the"
"two  lockers  were  in  the  exclusive  possession  of  the  Petitioner  and  thus,  failed  to"
"establish  the  exact  quantity  of  cannabis  that  was  said  to  have  been  found  in  the"
"trouser pocket of the Petitioner."
