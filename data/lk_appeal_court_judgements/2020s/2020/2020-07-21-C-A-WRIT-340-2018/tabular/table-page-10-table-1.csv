the"
"minimum age and  resident in the feeder area or the Administrative District in which the"
"School  is  situated  (excepting  for past  pupil  category)  such  an  applicant  can  submit  an"

reasons

"is  not  fulfilled)  marks  should  be  allocated  under  each  and  every  Sub-Clause  of  the"
"particular category and selections made based on  the total marks to achieve the objects"
"of the  Circular.  Sub-Clause  7.1.3,  heavily  relied  upon
