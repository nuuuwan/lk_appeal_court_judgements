"","After a thorough analysis of the aforementioned Circular, it occurs to me that the Petitioners"
"","have  fulfilled  all  the  requirements  for  admission  under the  Brother Category.  Therefore,  I"
"","believe  that  not  allowing  the  Petitioner  to  go  to  Ananda  College  is  ex  facie  arbitrary  and"
"","capricious and would amount to an abuse of administrative authority. Therefore, Petitioner's"
"","application should be allowed and the relief the Petitioner seeks for, shall  be granted."
"","As  the said  application was  preferred to enter the child  to year 1 in  2018,  he  should  now be"
"","admitted to year 3 in  2020 at Ananda  College,  Colombo 10."
"","This Court issue a Writ of Certiorari  under prayer (b)  of the Petition, to quash the decision of"
"","the 1st and  11th  Respondents which reflected in  P -17 and  P- 22, respectively."
"","Further, we  issue a Writ of Mandamus under prayer (c)  and  (d) of the Petition, against the 1st"
"","to 12th  Respondents, to admit the Petitioner's son, Ranasinghe Arachchige Sampath Dhananja"
"","Ranasinghe to year 3 in  2020, of Ananda  College,  Colombo 10,"
"","Considering the circumstances we make no order for cost."
