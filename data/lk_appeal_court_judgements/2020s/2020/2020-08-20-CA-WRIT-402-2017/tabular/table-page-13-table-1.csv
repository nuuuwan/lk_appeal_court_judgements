"s stated in De Smith’s Judicial Review8:"
"“The  task  for  the  courts  in  evaluating  whether  a  decision  is  illegal  is"
"essentially  one  of  construing  the  content  and  scope  of  the  instrument"
"conferring the duty or power upon the decision-maker. The courts when"
"exercising  this  power  or  construction  are  enforcing  the  rule  of  law,  by"
"requiring administrative  bodies  to act within the “four corners” of  their"
"powers or duties.”"
