"This Court must note two important matters at this point. The first is that the"
"Condominium Plan ‘P3’ has been approved by the Colombo Municipal Council,"
"which also approved ‘P2’. The second is that the said changes effected to ‘P2’,"
"as reflected in ‘P3’ compliments the admission that alterations were effected"
"to enable the conversion of the single house to a condominium property by the"
"Petitioner’s father."
