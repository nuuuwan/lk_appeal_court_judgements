"The  Board  of  Inquiry  is  a  fact-finding  mission.    It  has  only"
"recommended  that  disciplinary  action  be  taken  against  the"
"Petitioner.  It  is  at  the  summary  trial,  at  which  the  Petitioner"
"actively participated, that the sentence sought to be quashed"
"was  meted  out.    Hence  irregularities,  if  any,  at  the  Board  of"
"Inquiry proceedings need not be given undue weightage."
"The  third  ground  relied  upon  by  the  Petitioner  relates  to"
"procedural  irregularity  at  the  summary  trial.  The  Petitioner"
"states  in  the  petition  that  the  proceedings  of  the  Board  of"
"Inquiry  was  used  as  evidence  at  the  summary  trial,  which"
"contravenes  Regulation  21  of  the  Navy 
(Board  of  Inquiry)"
"Regulations  1975:  “The  proceedings  of  a  Board  of  Inquiry,  or"
"any other confession, statement or answer to a question made"
"or  given  at  a  Board  of  Inquiry  shall,  subject  to  any  other  law,"
"not  be  admissible  or  given  in  evidence  against  any  person  at"
"any  other  inquiry or  trial except  at  the  trial of such person for"
"willfully giving false evidence before the Board”."
"The Petitioner alleges in the petition that at the summary trial"
"the 
first  witness 
for 
the  prosecution  had 
“by 
implication"
"drawn  the  attention  of  the  court  in  respect  of  the  evidence"
"adduced 
in 
the  Board  of 
Inquiry”.  The  proceedings  of  the"
"summary  trial  tendered  with  the  Respondents’  statement  of"
"objections marked R3 reveal that the said witness referred to"
"the  proceedings  before  the  Board  of  Inquiry  only  in  one  of"
"seven  questions  put  to  him  by  the  prosecution  and  that  too"
"only  to  provide  a  sequence  of  events  in  his  testimony.  The"
"proceedings  before  the  Board  of  Inquiry  were  never  in  the"
"forefront of the testimony of this witness at the summary trial"
"and hence the said passing reference can be overlooked."
