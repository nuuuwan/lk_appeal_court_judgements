"""An oath is an  appeal by a person to God  to witness the truth of what he declares"
"and an imprecation of divine punishment or vengeance  on him if what he  says is"
"false.  Its purpose is to secure the truth. In its broadest sense, an oath includes any"
"form  of  attestation  by  which  a party  signifies  that he  is bound in  conscience  to"
"perform  an  act  faithfully  and  truthfully, bur  it  does  not  include  those  forms  of"
"attestation,  which  were  not  accompanied  by  an  imprecation.  It  is  sometimes"
"defined as  an  outward pledge given  by the  person taking  it  that  his  attestation  or promise  is"
"made under an immediate sense of his responSibility to God."""
