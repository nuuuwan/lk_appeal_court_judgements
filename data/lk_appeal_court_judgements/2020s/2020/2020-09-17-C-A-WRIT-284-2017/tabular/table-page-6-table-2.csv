"Sri LR 105 at 107-108, the Supreme Court, whilst dismissing the"
"appeal filed against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal, held:"
"The only matter urged by counsel on behalf of the employer"
"at the hearing in the Court of Appeal was that the Minister"
"had no power to refer a dispute for settlement by arbitration"
"in terms of section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act while"
"applications in respect of the same dispute were pending in"
"the  Labour  Tribunal.  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  as  follows:"
"“The  combined  effect  of 
the  provisions  of 
Interpretation"
"Article  170,  Articles  114  and  116  is  that  the  decision  in"
"Wimalasena  v.  Navaratne  and  others  (1978-79)  2  SLR  10,"
"can  no 
longer  be  considered  as  valid  authority 
for 
the"
"proposition  that  the  Minister  has  unlimited  powers  under"
"section  4(1)  of  the 
Industrial  Disputes  Act  which  would"
"enable  him  to  refer  a  dispute  which  is  pending  before  a"
"Labour  Tribunal  to  an  Arbitrator  for  settlement.  Such  an"
"interpretation  would  necessarily 
infringe  and  violate  the"
"principle  of  the  independence  of  the  judiciary  enshrined  in"
"Article  116  of  the  Constitution  which  is  paramount  law”...I"
