"T
he  main 
ground  upon  which 
the 
Petitioner 
bases 
this"
"application  is,  when  the  dispute  is  sub  judice  in  the  Labour"
"Tribunal,  the  Minister  cannot  refer  the  same  or  part  of  it  for"
"arbitration."
"The  5th  Respondent  counters  this  argument  by  stating  that  the"
"dispute  referred  for  arbitration  is  distinctly  different  from  the"
"dispute presented before the Labour Tribunal."
"I  am  afraid,  I  cannot  agree.    The  alleged  “two  disputes”  are"
"intrinsically interwoven."
"The  complaint  of  the  Petitioner  to  the  Labour  Tribunal  is  that"
"the termination of her services was unjustifiable.  On that basis,"
"she seeks reinstatement or compensation and any other reliefs."
"The subsequent reference for arbitration admits the termination"
"of  employment  but  questions  the  non-payment  of  the  “pension"
"fund”."
"The  said  two  disputes  are  irreconcilable,  in  that,  in  the  dispute"
"presented  before 
the  Labour  Tribunal, 
the  5th  Respondent"
"disputes 
the 
termination,  but 
in 
the  dispute 
referred 
for"
"arbitration,  the  Petitioner  accepts  the  termination  but  disputes"
"the  denial  of  the  benefits  she  claims  she  is  entitled  to.    She"
"cannot  claim  the  benefits  of  the  “pension  fund”  without  first"
"accepting the termination of employment."
"On 
the  other  hand, 
the  dispute 
referred 
for  arbitration 
is"
"meaningless if the Labour Tribunal directs reinstatement on the"
"basis that the termination of the 5th Respondent is unjustifiable."
"If 
the  Labour  Tribunal  comes 
to 
the  conclusion 
that 
the"
"termination 
is 
unjustifiable, 
but 
decides,
