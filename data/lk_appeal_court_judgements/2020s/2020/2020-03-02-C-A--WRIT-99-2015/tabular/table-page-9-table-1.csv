"Respondent.  In  this  particular situation,  the  pivotal  issue  is  the failure  of"
"the  said  Sabha 
to  deposit 
the 
required 
sum  of  money  with 
the  4th"
"Respondent  to  be  payable  to 
the  Petitioners  after  determination  as  per"
"Section  17  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act.  The  Petitioners  have  therefore"
"sought a Writ of Mandamus against the Acquiring Officer, citing him as the"
"4 th  Respondent in addition to  the 1st  and  2nd  Respondents.  In  the event of"
"this Court  issuing a Writ of Mandamus  on these Respondents, they should"
"comply  with  that  order.  Once 
the  Court  issues  an  order, 
the  relevant"
"Respondent  must  comply. 
There 
is  no  question  of  Pradeshiya  Sabha"
"making a determination whether to comply with the order of Court or not"
"as it did with the determination of the 4th Respondent. There is no decision"
"making process  that is  involved with the Pradeshiya Sabha, in complying"
"with  an order of Court.  Hence,  the 
relevant Pradeshiya Sabha 
is  not a"
"necessary party , in tha t context."
