"place in the area . This settlement is commonly known as  ""Akkara 90 Janapadaya."" The subject"
"road  way  which  leads  to the  Remuna  Village  or  ""RemunaGammanaya""  from  the  Horana  -"
"Kalutara main road is  used  by the villagers of the Remuna  Village, Akkara 90 Janapadaya and"
"the residents of the area as a Public access way for over 50 years. The said Respondent further"
"states that there are about 85  families living in the Akkara 90 Janapadaya."
"The said roadway is the only access between the Horana - Kalutara main road and the ""Akkara"
"90 Janapadaya"" as well as  Remunawatte Village . Development of this road wrY was identified"
"as one of the foremost development projects under the 2016 Development of Rural  Facilities"
"Programme  spearheaded  by  the Ministry of National  Planning and  Economic  Development."
"A sum  of Rs.  One  Million was  allocated for the project."
"Subsequent to a thorough analysis of the facts of the case, I believe that it is pertinent to note"
"that the development of the roadway depicted as  Gamsabaha road  was  under way upon the"
"time this matter was supported for Notice before this court and that upon the issuing of the"
"said  Interim Order, the Development process came to an immediate stop . Therefore, the raw"
"material brought to the site was left to waste on site and the roadway which has been partially"
"constructed  with crushed  metal  strewn  halfway has  made access  along the  road  hazardous"
"and unusable. Pertaining to the aforesaid, (as pointed out by the 1st Respondent), the villagers"
"of the area have also faced hardship."
"I further believe that once the impugned Gazette is published, and boundaries were properly"
"demarcated, the Petitioner had  been afforded an  opportunity to raise  any objections within"
"the time and  the  Petitioner failed  to do so,  therefore no  writ remedies  would  be  amenable"
