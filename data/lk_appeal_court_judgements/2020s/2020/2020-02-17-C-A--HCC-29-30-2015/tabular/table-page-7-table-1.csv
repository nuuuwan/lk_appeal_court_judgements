In support of the 2nd  ground of appeal, as relied upon by the l"

accused-appellants, 
learned  Counsel  contended 
that  owing 
to 
the"
"irreconcilable 
inconsistencies  and  other  deficiencies  of  the  testimony  of"
"witness  Sriyalathn,  the  trial Court had concluded  that her evidence should"
"be  rejected. 
Having  rejected  Sriyalathn 's  evidence, 
the 
trial  Court  had"
"proceeded  to 
convict  the  appellants  only  on  the  evidence  of  Githnnja/ie."
"Learned  Counsel  contended

the 
adoption  of 
this 
unorthodox"
"approach  by 
the 
trial  Court  was

"also  contended  that  the  learned  trial  Judge who  delivered  the  impugned"
"judgment,  neither  had  the  opportunity  of  observing  the  demeanour  and"

deportment  of  any  of 
the  prosecution  witnesses  nor 
the

"accused-appellants or their  witnesses and  that fact clearly exacerbates  the"
"error committed by the trial Court in rejecting Sriyalatha's evidence."
