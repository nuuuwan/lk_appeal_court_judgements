"The  superior Courts  have consistently laid  emphasis on the  duty  to"
"consider the evidence as a whole, irrespective of whether the trial was held"
"before  a  jury or Judge.  In The  King v  Appuhamy 37 NLR  281,  it is  stated"
"that"" One has  to  look  at the  whole case"".  A similar approach was adopted by"
"the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal 
in  King  v  Buckley  43  NLR  474,  which"
"imposed  a  duty  on  the  jurors  that  they  should  view 
the  evidence  as  a"
"whole.  The judgments  of  King  v  de  Silva  41  NLR  337,  King  v  Perera  41"
"NLR 389, The  Queen v Abadda 66 NLR 397 had adopted a similar view."
