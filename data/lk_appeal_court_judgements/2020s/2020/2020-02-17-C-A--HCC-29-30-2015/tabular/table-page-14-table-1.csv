"In, Beckford v R (1993) 97 Cr App R 409, Lord Lowry stated;"
"""The  need 
to  give  the  general  warning  even  in  recognition"
"cases  where  the  main  challenge  is  to  the  truthfulness  of the"
"witness  should  be  obvious.  The first  question for  the  jury is"
"whether the  witness is  honest. If the  answer  to  that question"
"is  yes, 
the  next question  is  the  same  as  that  which  must be"
"asked concerning every honest witness who purports  to  make"
"is 
an 
identification, 
namely 
he 
right 
or 
could 
he 
be"
"mistaken ?"""
