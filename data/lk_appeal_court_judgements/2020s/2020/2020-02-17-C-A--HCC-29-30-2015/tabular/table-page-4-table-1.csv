"the question of identity of the accused- appellants to the required degree of"
"proof.  The  appellants  have  claimed  before  the  trial  Court  that  they  were"
"falsely  accused  of  these  offences. 
Learned  Counsel  for  the  1st  accused"
"appellant had  explained 
this  ground  of appeal  by  making an additional"
"basis that it was  a  case of  a"" mistaken identity"".  The 1st  and 3rd  accused"
"appellants  also  have  raised  another  ground  of appeal  in  support of  their"
"appeals  on  the  basis 
that  the 
trial  Court  had  erroneously  rejected 
the"
"evidence  of  Sriya/atha,  a  vital  witness  for  the  prosecution,  in  convicting"
"them  on several  counts,  which  included  an allegation of commission of a"
"capital offence. It is  their contention 
that the trial Court did so in view of"
"the irreconcilable 
inconsistencies  that exists 
between the evidence of  the"
"mother  and  her  daughter 
in 
their  evidence 
thereby  causing 
grave"
"prejudice to them."
