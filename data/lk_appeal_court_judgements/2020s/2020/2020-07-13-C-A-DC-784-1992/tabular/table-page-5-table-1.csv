"(a) 
to file an  interlocutory appeal or"
"(b)  to stay his hand and file  his appeal at the end of the case  even on the very"
"same ground only on which he could  have filed his interlocutory appeal."
"In 
the 
instance  case, 
though 
the  order  of  the  Learned  District  Judge  dated  2.10.1992"
"disallowing the Appellant's application to call  for fresh evidence goes to the root of the case,"
"the Appellants have the right to prefer an  appeal against the Judgment of the Learned District"
"Judge  dated 05 .11.1992, which was very shortly (34 days)  after the said  order."
"The said Appeal was taken up for arguments on 20.09.2010 before this Court. All 3 Appellants"
"were present in person and all the other partied were absent and  unrepresented on that day."
"follows  on 
the  20.09.2010  regarding 
the  said 
My  Learned  Predecessor  has  minuted  as"
"settlement;"
"""l7'h,  18th  and 19th  Defendant-Appellants are present in  Court and they informed Court that"
"they have settled the matter out of Caurt and tender the settlement duly signed by the parties."
"Therefore, Court directs the Learned District Judge to incorporate the terms of settlement and"
"enter  interlocutory  decree  accardingly.  However, 
the  counsel  for  the  Appellants  are  not"
"present in  Court today,  Therefore,  if there is  any ambiguity in  this  term of settlement, as  this"
"is a Partition Action the Applicant is permitted ta file  a Motion and inform the Court to correct"
"the ambiguity before this directive is sent to the District Court"""
"It is  important to be  noted that the Court of Appeal  in  its order dated  20.09.2010 permitted"
"the Appellants to file a motion in the event of an ambiguity in its order and  inform this Court"
"to correct any such  ambiguity before its directive is  sent to the  District Court of Matara. The"
"direction of the Court of Appeal  was  sent to District Court and  Learned  District Judge  could"
"not implement the said  directions as the copy of the settlement was  missing.  It was  referred"
"back to Court of Appeal and the so-called settlement terms were not to be found. At the same"
"time the 17th Defendant has failed to produce the copy of alleged terms of settlement for the"
"perusal  by  Court.  The  17th  Defendant or the  17A Substituted-Defendant  has  not made  any"
"app lication to that effect for nearly 8 years to correct any such ambiguity. It shows that there"
"was  no such settlement entered on the 20.09.2010."
"It was  argued  that the  Appellants  had  never complained  of any  ambiguity in  the said  order"
"dated  20.09.2010  hence  there  was  no  requirement  of taking  such  steps  but  the  17th  A"
"Defendant,  made  an  application  before  this  Court  on 
the  basis  that  the  said  order  was"
"erroneous  and  per incuriam  which  has  been  held  by  the  Court  of Appeal,  in  favor  of the"
"Appellants  by  its order dated  19.10.2018, vacating the said  order dated  20.09.2010.  In  view"
"of the correspondents marked P4  and  P5  tendered with the relisting application, there is  no"
"such  terms of settlement available for the  District Court to consider even  on  19.03.2018 or"
"thereafter either in the Court of Appeal  Case  Record  or for that matter in  the custody of the"
"17 A Substituted Defendant."
"After  the  Original  Case  was  sent  back  to  District  Court  (DC),  Matara  on  the  20.09.2010,"
"Interlocutory Decree and final  Decree entered and final  Partition Plan too, has  been  made in"
