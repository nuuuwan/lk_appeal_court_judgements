"08.","In  his  allocution  the  1 sl  Appellant  said  that  he  had  a  scuffle  with  the  deceased.  When  the"
"","deceased  tried  to  stab  him,  when  he  tried  to  prevent,  the  deceased  got  stabbed,  he  said."
"","Further, he said that acted in  self-defence."
"09.","At the  trial  this  position was  never taken  by  the defence.  It was  not  even  suggested  to  the"

the  evidence  adduced  at  the  trial,"
"","analyzed  the  same  and  rightly  decided  that  the  1 sl  Appellant  stabbed  the  deceased  that"
"","caused  his  death.  There  was  no  evidence  of the  1 sl  Appellant  using  his  right  of self"
"","defence,  at  the  trial.  Hence,  the  sole  ground  of appeal  urged  by  the  1 st  Appellant  has  no"

"10.","First ground of appeal  urged  by  the  2nd  and  the  3 rd  Appellants  is  that the  evidence of PW3"
"","and  PW5  with  regard 
to 
the  onset  of the  2nd 
incident  appears 
to  be  conflicting.  The"
"","evidence  of both  witnesses  was  adequately  considered  and  analyzed  by  the  learned  Trial"
"","Judge."
