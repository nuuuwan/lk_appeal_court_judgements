"c
ited but, regrettably, not the most important and most relevant"
"one,  i.e.  the  inter  partes  Judgment  and  decree  entered  in  case"
"No.2053/SPL.    Nor  has  the  Commissioner  of  National  Housing"
"taken 
the  said  decree 
into  consideration 
in  arriving  at 
the"
"impugned decision, despite the fact that he was given a copy of"
"it by the Petitionerâ€™s Attorney-at-Law."
"Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  appearing  for  the  incumbent"
"Commissioner  of  National  Housing  candidly  admits  X18  and"
"X20 cannot be defended in the eyes of the law."
"The 2nd and 3rd Respondents in paragraph 2(g) of the statement"
"of  objections  state  for  the  first  time  that  the  decree  entered  in"
"case No.2053/SPL is per incuriam. They say this, in my view, in"
"passing.  They do not pray for such a relief in the prayer to their"
"statement  of  objections.  Although  the  2nd  and  3rd  Respondents,"
"who were not parties to the said case state the said decree is per"
"incuriam, the  parties to the action do not  state so.    There is no"
"allegation of collusion.  In any event, a Judgment handed down"
"by  a  competent  Court  cannot  be  attacked  collaterally,  whether"
"by a party to the action or a third party.  The 2nd Respondent is"
"admittedly  the  lessee  of  the  premises  under  the  predecessor  in"
"title 
of 
the  Petitioner 
(until  perhaps  X20  was  wrongfully"
"executed).    How  can  such  a  person  challenge  the  Judgment"
"entered  in  case  No.2053/SPL  on  the  basis  the  decision  is  per"
"incuriam?"

"Commissioner 
of  National  Housing, 
the  Commissioner 
of"
"National  Housing  can  alter  this  status  not  by  cancelling  the"
