Commissioner  of  National  Housing

"As  an  Attorney-at-Law,  the  Commissioner 
Supreme  Court)”."
"ought 
to  have  known  no 
further 
intervention  by  him  was"
"required  in  light  of  the  decision  of  the  District  Court  in  case"
"No.2053/SPL,  delivered 
in  October  1982, 
that 
the  premises"
"never  vested 
in  the  Commissioner  of  National  Housing.  The"
"Commissioner  of  National  Housing  had  no  right  whatsoever  to"
"hold  another  inquiry  to  decide  the  owner  of  the  premises.    The"
"Commissioner of National Housing manifestly acted ultra vires."
"The  Petitioner  further  says  no  proper  inquiry  with  both  parties"
"attending  together  was  held  by  the  Commissioner  of  National"
"Housing and no decision was served on him after the inquiry."
"Be  that  as  it  may,  X18  dated  25.05.2015  is  the  decision  of  the"
"Commissioner  of  National  Housing,  made  pursuant 
to 
the"
"purported 
inquiry. 
  By  X18, 
the  Commissioner  of  National"
"Housing  says  the  Petitioner  did  not  establish  his  title  to  the"
"property  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Commissioner  but  the  other"
"party  (i.e.  the  2nd  Respondent  lessee)  “perfectly”    did  through"
"written  submissions  and  decided  cases,  and 
therefore, 
the"
"Commissioner decided to transfer the title of the property to the"
"3rd  Respondent  who  is  the  son  of  the  2nd  Respondent.    I  totally"
"reject  this 
line  of  reasoning. 
  When  a  competent  Court  has"
"already decided in a case wherein the Commissioner of National"
"Housing was the Defendant that the property never vested in the"
"Commissioner  of  National  Housing,  how  can  the  Commissioner"
"of  National  Housing 
thereafter  purport 
to 
transfer 
the  said"
"property to another?  The written submission referred to by the"
"Commissioner  of  National  Housing 
in  his  Order  has  been"
