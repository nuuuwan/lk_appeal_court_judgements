"In addition to  Ariyapala,  PushpaKumara  also  identified  the  2nd  Appellant at"
"the  identification  parade,  while Gunadasa  identified  both the  Appellants.  These"
"two witnesses also assert that they saw the faces of the two robbers at the time of"
"commission  of the  offence and  had  identified  them at the  identification parade"
"held after their arrest."
"In view of the consistent position of the  three witnesses have noted facial"
"features  of  the  two  robbers  at  the  time  of  the  commission  of  the  offence  and"
"which claim had been  subsequently confirmed  by their positive identification of"
"the  two  Appellants  without making a  mistake during the  identification parade,"
"this  Court  concurs  with  the  conclusion  reached  by 
the 
trial  Court  that  the"
"witnesses have properly identified the Appellants at the identification parade."
"With the view expressed  in the preceding paragraph, in relation to  the 1st"
"challenge 
this  Court  now  proceeds 
to  consider  the  other  complaint  of 
the"
"Appellants that they were shown to  the prosecution witnesses by the Police after"
"their arrest."
"This  contention  is  founded  on  the  evidence  of  the  witness  Pushpakumara"
"who  stated  that  he  was  asked 
to  come  to  Police  as  they  have  arrested 
two"
"suspects.  Apparently  only his father had  complied with the directive. Ariyapala"
"too had received a similar direction from the Police which he preferred to ignore."
"He also knew that Gunadasa and Pushpakumara  too  were also called by Walasmulla"
"Police, but the witness was confident none of them went to Police in compliance"
