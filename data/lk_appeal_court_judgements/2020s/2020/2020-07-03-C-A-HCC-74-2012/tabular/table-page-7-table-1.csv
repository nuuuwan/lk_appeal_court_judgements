"In  relation 
to 
the  first  of 
these 
two  contentions, 
this  Court  notes 
that"
"despite 
the  submission  by 
the 
learned  Counsel  for 
the  Appellants 
that  the"
"identification  is  improbable  because  the  robbers  wore  ""full  face  helmets"" 
that"
"fact is  not supported by evidence.  All  three prosecution witnesses agree that the"
"two  Appellants had  their  helmets on.  Only Ariyapa/a said in evidence that both"
"of them had their helmets on during the time they were in the stores of Gunadasa."
"Even  then,  the  witness claimed  that he  identified  the 2nd  Appellant,  owing  to  a"
"facial  feature  and  also  by 
his  stature,  which  had  etched  in  the  mind  of  the"
"witness. Of the three witnesses, Gunadasa  could be considered as  a  disinterested"
"witness, as indicative by his conduct when the news reached that the two robbers"
"were arrested. He had shown no interest to know who they were and had merely"
"participated  in  the  identification  parade.  The  notes  of  the  identification  parade"
"indicate  that Ariyapa/a  had shown no hesitation in identifying the 2nd  Appellant"
"as  he  had  pointed  out  the  latter  no  sooner  he  inspected 
the  parade.  Having"
"indicated there was another, at the time of robbery he did not venture to 
identify"
"the  1st  Appellant,  nor  did  he  pointed  out  to  a  wrong  person  in  the  belief  he"
"identified the 1st  Appellant."
