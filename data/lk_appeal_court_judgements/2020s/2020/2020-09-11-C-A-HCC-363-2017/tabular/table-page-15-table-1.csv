"IS 
The  Counsel 
for 
the 
appellant's 
position 
that  Perakum"
"Mawatha is  Y2  Km away from  Upananda Mawatha. But on a  perusal of"
"the evidence it appears that the length of Perakum Mwatha is what has"
"been referred 
to as  1/2  km in length."
"Considering  all  of  the  above, 
the  ground  of  appeal  urged"
"about the failure  of the learned High  Court Judge to consider the"
"contradictions in the evidence of PW  1  and PW  11  is not tenable."
"Another  ground  urged 
by  the  counsel  is  that  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge  has  failed  to  consider  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to"
"prove the chain of production."
"PW  1 testified that the appellant was taken in to custody together"
"with the production at about 9  am . PW  11  has not witnessed the actual"
"arrest as he was in the vehicle but a  few  moments later has witnessed"
"that the suspect had been taken in to custody.  It is corroborated about"
"the  weighing,  packeting  and  sealing  of  the  production  at  the  Police"
"Narcotics  Bureau.  PW  12  Jayathillake  at the  Police  Narcotics  Bureau"
"although not actively participated had corroborated the above."
"The  production thereafter,  has been in the custody of PW  1 until"
"his return to the Mount Lavinia police station 
in the night and handing"
"over  same 
to  PW  7  Manjula  who 
testified 
to 
the 
receipt  of  same."
"Thereafter, 
it  has  changed  hands  to  PW  8,  PC 
Indrasiri,  PC  13578"
"Rajapakse who  has  handed  it  over  to  PW  11, 
then  to  the  production"
"clerk and then to  the Government Analyst Department,  where there is"
