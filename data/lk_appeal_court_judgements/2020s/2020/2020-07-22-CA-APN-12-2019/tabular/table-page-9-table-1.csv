"The  Cases  3/2008  and  17/2013  have  dealt  with  the  offence  in"
"section 364 (2)  (c)  of the Penal Code."
"In the instant case the Petitioner is charged under the amended"
"Firearms Ordinance.  The previous conviction is in relation to an offence"
"committed on or before  10.6.2002. For that offence,  the petitioner  has"
"been sentenced on  12.03.2009 under Section 22  (3)  (a),  where there is"
"no  mandatory  sentence  prescribed  which  allows 
the 
trial  Judge  to"
"exercise his discretion and impose a  suitable and appropriate sentence."
"However  when  charged  under  sec  22  (3) 
(b), 
there  is  a  mInImum"
"mandatory sentence  prescribed."
"The  second  offence  has  been  committed  on  or  about  2l.06.2004,"
"approximately  2  years  and  10  days  after  the  first  offence. 
It  is  a  fair"
"assumption that the  petitioner after committing 
the first  offence,  has"
"not reformed or rehabilitated, to have  repeated a  similar offence within"
"approximately two years."
"There 
is  no  need 
to  stress  that  offences  under  the  Firearms"
"Ordinance  are  serious  offences.  Then 
the  question  arises  whether"
"courts should exercise judicial discretion in favour of imposing a  lesser"
"sentence than the mandatory sentence. The petitioner being charged a"
"second time for the same offence makes it more serious . It appears that"
"the  fact  that  the  Petitioner  being  apprehended  and  charged  for  a  fire"
"arms  offence  has  not  deterred  him  from  committing the  same  offence"
"within a  short period  of time."
"In view of the observation in SC 3  of 2008,  where it states that in"
"offences  of  serious  nature,  a  Court  may  never  exercise  judicial"
"is 
discretion 
in  favour  of  a 
punishment 
that 
less 
than 
the"
"the  argument  that  the  trial 
mandatory  minimum  sentence,  thus,"
"judge failed follow the dicta in SC 3  of 2008  necessarily fails. ( emphasis"
"added)"
"In the Supreme Court of Canada in  R  v  Nur (2015)  1 SCR 773 is"
"a  matter where the accused were charged under a  firearms offence  and"
"9"
