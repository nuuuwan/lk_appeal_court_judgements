"judicial review should be made promptly unless"
"there are good reasons for the delay.  The failure"

"In  H.A.M.Cassim  Vs  GA  Batticaloa 
(NLR  Vo1.69"
"pg.403)  It was held"
"«  An  application 
in 
reV1SlOn  must  be  made"
"promptly ifit is to be entertained by the Supreme"
"Court.  There must be finality in litigation,  even if"
"incorrect orders have to go  unreversed."""
"The  Petitioner who  is invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this"
"court has failed  to give a  plausible  explanation for the delay in seeking"
"relief. 
It is  not  averred 
that  there  is  a  miscarriage  of justice  or  the"
"impugned order is illegal irregular, capricious or arbitrary."
"Therefore, 
it  is  my  considered  view  that  on  the  ground  of  the"
"unexplained  delay  alone,  in  view  of the  above  quoted  authorities  the"
"application for revision could be dismissed in limine."
"However, 
in  the  written  submissions  of  the  respondent  dated"
"3 . 11.2019  it  is  submitted  that  the  respondent  is  not  pursuing  the"
"preliminary  objection  on  the  maintainability  of  the  action  but  only"
"seeking an enhancement of the sentence."
"I will now Consider the basis of the Revision Application . Some of the"
"exceptional  circumstances  pleaded  in  paragraph  8  of the  petition  can"
"be summarized as follows;"
"• 
Imposition of 6  and a  half year sentence is contrary to Article 4 (C),"
"11  and 12 (1) of the Constitution."
"• 
The  imposition  of 6  years  and six months sentence is contrary  to"
