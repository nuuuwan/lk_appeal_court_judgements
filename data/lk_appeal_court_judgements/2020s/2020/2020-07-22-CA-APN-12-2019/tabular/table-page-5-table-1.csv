"","•  Mandatory minimum Sentence imposed by section 22(3) of the Fire"
"","Arms Amendment Act No  22 of 1996 is in conflict with Article 4  (C),"

The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  is  not  inhibited  from  imposing  a"
"","sentence  that  it  deems  appropriate  in  the  exercise  of its judicial"
"","discretion notwithstanding the mandatory minimum sentence."
"","• 
The effect of imposition of6 and half years sentence would amount"
"","to  an erosion ofjudicial discretion in regard to  sentencing.  This will"
"","violate the principles of equal treatment and even amounts to cruel"
"","punishment."
"","The Petitioner has been charged under the Firearms Ordinance."
"","Section 22(3)  provides;"
"","Any person  contravening  the  provisions  of this  section  shall  be"
"","guilty  of an  offence  against  this  Ordinance  and  shall  on conviction  be"
"","punishable-"
"","a)  For the first offence with a fine  not exceeding ten thousand"
"","rupees  or  with 
rigorous 
imprisonment 
for  a  period  not"
"","exceeding five years or with both such fine and imprisonment;"
"","(b)  For the second or any subsequent offence,  with rigorous"
"","imprisonment for a period of not less than ten years and"
"","not exceeding twenty years."
"","Thus, it is apparent that as per Section 22(3)  (b),  the learned High"
"","Court 
Judge 
had 
to 
impose 
a 
mmimum 
ten 
years 
rigorous"
"","imprisonment  as  the  petitioner  was  convicted  of  a 
similar  previous"
"","offence.  However,  it appears the trial judge  has imposed 6  years and 6"
"","months rigorous imprisonment sentence."
"","It is contended on behalf of the petitioner in page 6  of the written"
"","submissions  dated  4.  10.2019,  that the  petitioner pleaded guilty with"
"","the prime intention of getting a  non custodial sentence."
