"General Vs  Sampath { 1997} 3  SLR 390 where it is stated that the trial"
"judge could  not have  in  law  directed  that  the  period  spent in  remand"
"should  be  taken  into  consideration  as a  part of the  period  of sentence"
"that he has served."
"However,  the  facts  in  Sampath's  case  can  be  distinguished  from"
"the instant case. In Sampath's Case, these was no mandatory minimum"
"sentence prescribed by law and it was open for the learned judge to have"
"imposed a  maximum  sentence of  10 years  rigorous imprisonment and"
"a  maximum sentence of Rs.lO,OOO / = and in addition, whipping."
"However  in  that case,  the  trial judge after  imposing only a  three"
"year rigorous imprisonment
, had taken the view that the sentence was"
"covered by the period the accused had been in custody and directed the"
"prison  authorities  to  release  the  accused  from  custody.  In  the  instant"
"case  a  six  and  a  half year  rigorous  imprisonment  sentence  has  been"
"imposed."
"At this point it is important to consider the background which led"
"up 
to 
the  withdrawal  of  the  plea  of  not  guilty  and 
the  petitioner"

"In  the  instant  matter,  the  counsel  on  mitigation  has  referred  to"
"the  three  and  a  half years  the  petitioner has  been  in  remand  custody"
"which the learned judge has considered when imposing the sentence."
"The  petitioner has been  arrested  on  20.06.2004,  indicted  in  the"
"for  being  in 
High  Court  of Gampaha on  20.03.2012.  ( 8  years  later)"
"possession of a  self loaded revolver without a  valid license ,pleaded not"
"guilty and enlarged on bail. Trial was fIxed  for 5.7.2012, and since that"
"day, 
the  trial  has  been  postponed  due  to  the  non  availability  of  the"
"productions which was said to be in the High Court of Colombo. The fact"
"the judicial system allowing almost 5 years for the case to get postponed"
"on the non availability of a  production is  disheartening and  cannot be"
"considered lightly by any court of law."
