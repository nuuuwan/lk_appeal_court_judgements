"In Attorney General vs H. N. de Silva (Vol. 57 NLR  Pg  121) Basnayake"
"A.  CJ observed 
as follows;"
""" ......... in assessing the punishment that should be passed"
"on  an  offender,  a 
judge  should  consider  the  matter  of"
"sentence  both from  the point of view of the public and  the"
"offender.  Judges are too often prone to look at the question"
"only  from 
the  angle  of the  offender.  A  judge  should, 
in"
"determining  the proper sentence,  first  consider the gravity"
"of the offence,  as it appears from the nature of the act itself"
"and should have regard  to  the punishment provided in  the"
"Penal  Code  or  other  Statute  under  which  the  offender  is"
"charged.  The  reformation  of the  criminal,  though  no  doubt"
"an  important  consideration  is  subordinate  to  the  others  I"
"have mentioned.  Where the public interest or the welfare of"
"the  State  (which  are  synonymous) outweighs  the previous"
"good character,  antecedents and age of the offender, public"
"interest must prevail. """
