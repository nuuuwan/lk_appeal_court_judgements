"authority is compelled to have regard.”18"
"W
hile I am mindful that it is not my duty to analyse the facts  as  would be done  when"
"exercising appellate jurisdiction, I am also mindful that, as stated by Lord Bingham, that"
"‘they (judges) are auditors of legality; no more, but no less.’19 Viewed from that context,"
"can it be said that the Debt Conciliation Board has performed the role conferred on it by"
"Section 21A of the Ordinance, and taken into consideration all the circumstances of the"
"case? I do not think so. As stated by Lord Diplock, the Board ought to have understood"
"correctly the law that regulates its decision making power and given effect to it. In these"
"circumstances, I am of the view that failure to do so renders ‘X8’ liable to be quashed by"
"a Writ of Certiorari."
