"matters. The four matters set out therein are factors which the legislature has thought"
"important in determining whether a transfer is in effect a mortgage, but, by the use of"
"the words, ‘take into consideration all the circumstances of the case’, the legislature has"
"made  it  clear  that  the  decision  of  the  Board  cannot  be  limited  to  a  consideration  and"
"determination of only those four matters. The Board has been empowered to conduct"
"an inquiry, hear the witnesses, and consider documents not for it to then engage in an"
"exercise  of  ticking  off  a  check  list  and  arriving  at  a  decision  based  on  the  number  of"
"rights or wrongs they give to the four matters set out in Section 21A(a) – (d). That to my"
"mind, is not acting judicially."
