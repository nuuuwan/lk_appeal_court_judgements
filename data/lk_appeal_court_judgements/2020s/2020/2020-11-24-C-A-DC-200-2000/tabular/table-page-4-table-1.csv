"Wijepala  produced  Deed  No.  1900 marked as  P4 to prove that Ranmenika  has transferred a share of the"
"disputed land to Martheewan Fernando."
"According to the evidence, the Deed  No. 50 was  marked as  P4. The Defendants did not cross examine the"
"witness who were to be  added as  P4  and  P4  (a)."
"In  the end  of the Plaintiffs case,  the Defendant did  not give  or lead  any evidence.  It is  my view that the"
"Learned  Trial  Judge  errored  in  law  stating  that  the  Plaintiff  has  not  proved  the  inheritance  and  the"
"devolution of the title under the Kandyan Law.  It is the duty of the Defendant to prove the Deega marriage"
"on the Defendants, but they failed to do so. The Defendants who should prove the Deega  marriage and it"
"is their duty to produce the marriage certificates under the Kandyan  Law ."
"In  those  circumstances  it  is  clear  that although  the  Learned  Trial  judge  has  dismissed  the  action  on  a"
"wrongful  footing, 
I  am  of  the  opinion  that  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  should  not  have  been"
"dismissed.  Therefore, the impugned judgment of the  Learned  District Judge  is  erroneous.  We  set  aside"
"the judgment dated 3,d May 2000 by the District Judge of Awissawella and the judgment should be entered"
"in favor of the Plaintiff as  follows."
"Substituted Plaintiff Appellant 
undivided 1/4'h"
"First Defendant 
undivided 1/4'h"
"Second  Defendant 
undivided 1/4'h"
"Third Defendant 
undivided 1/16'h"
"Fourth Defendant 
undivided 1/16'h"
"Fifth defendant 
undivided 1/8'h (minus block of land for 10 
coconut trees)"
"Enter interlocutory decree accordingly;"
"Appeal allowed ."
"The  Plaintiff is entitled for costs in the District Court as  well as  in the appeal  and the surveyor fees"
