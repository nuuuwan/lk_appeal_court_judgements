"such delay must be explained to the satisfaction of Court. The third is that delay can be"
"ignored, if the  act  complained  of  is  manifestly illegal, such  as  a  decision of  a statutory"
"authority  made in excess of jurisdiction. The fourth is the nature of the  acts that have"
"taken place during the time period between the impugned decision or act and the filing"
"of the application. These factors are relevant when determining whether the discretion"
"of this Court should be exercised where the Petitioners are guilty of delay."
