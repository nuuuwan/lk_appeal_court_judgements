"The  Petitioner submits that she  came  to be  aware  of the 4th  Respondent's  claim  of ownership"
"by virtue of P4  in  2002. The  Respondents contradict this by stating that there is  no  explanation"
"as  to  why the  Petitioner  waited  for  some  14  years  before  filing this  case.  Consequently,  the"
"Respondents submit that this application  cannot  be  maintained on  account of the  unexplained"
"delay."
"Further,  the  Respondents  state  that  the  Petitioner  is  effectively  reviewing  the  legality  of  a"
"Grant  made  by  the  President  of the  Republic. 
In  terms  of Article  35  of the  Constitution  the"
"President  enjoys  immunity from  legal  action  with  respect  to  anything  done  or  omitted  to  be"
"done  in  his  official  or  private  capacity. 
An  exception  is 
laid  down  in 
the  proviso.  This  Writ"
"Application clearly does not come within this exception."
"The  4th  Respondent  states  inter-alia that the Grant was  made  by  Her Excellency the  President"
"of Sri  Lanka  and  therefore  the  matters  arising  from  this  application  are  not  amenable  to  the"
"Writ jurisdiction  of this  Court.  The  4th  Respondent  took  up  the  position  that the  Petitioner  is"
"delayed  to  file  this  action  before this  Court  whereas  the  Petitioner had  denied  such  objection"
"stating  that  by  the  time  the  Court  of Appeal  case  was  instituted  the  Supreme  Court  had  not"
"decided  on  whom the power to decide over State  Lands  are vested . The 4th Respondent  states"
"that Constitution clearly explains with whom the state lands shall be vested."
"it  could  be  revealed  that  in  the 
Subsequent  to  a  thorough  analysis  of the  facts  of the  case,"
"Petition  of the  Petitioner  she  had  stated  that  delay  occurred  due  to the  inquiries  held  by  the"
"Land  Commissioner and  the inquiries held at the Land  Ministry."
"In  the  case  Biso  Menike  Vs.  Cyril  de  Alwis  1982  (1)  SLR  368  His  Lordship  Justice  Sharvananda"
"explains the delay which  a court can  excuse as follows:"
"""What  is  reasonable  time  and  what  will  constitute  undue  delay  will  depend  upon  the"
"facts of each  particular case.  However, the time lag that can  be  explained does not spell"
"laches  or delay.  If the  delay  can  be  reasonably  explained  the  court  will  not  decline  to"
"interfere.  The  delay  which  a court  can  excuse  is  one  which  is  caused  by  the  applicant"
"pursuing a legal remedy and  not a remedy which is  extra-legal."""
"As  per the  aforesaid  case  law it could  be  noted that the reason  given  by the Petitioner for her"
"delay is  not valid  because the same  has  been  occurred due to applicant pursuing an  extra-legal"
"remedy and  not a legal remedy."
"It is also pertinent to note that neither the Petitioner nor her father is  having a paper title to the"
"land  in  issue. Therefore, it is  obvious that the Petitioner has no right whatsoever to the land she"
"is claiming and she is  merely an  illegal trespasser."
