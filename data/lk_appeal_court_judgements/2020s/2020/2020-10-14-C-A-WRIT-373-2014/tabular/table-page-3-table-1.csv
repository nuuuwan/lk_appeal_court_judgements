"In  paragraph  8  of  the  statement  of  objections,  the  Director"
"General  of  Customs  says  “the  Petitioner  has 
imported  bottles"
"preform  of  plastic  being  an  intermediate  product  having  tubular"
"shape, with one closed end and one open end threaded to secure"
"screw  type  closure,  the  portion  below  the  threaded  end  being"
