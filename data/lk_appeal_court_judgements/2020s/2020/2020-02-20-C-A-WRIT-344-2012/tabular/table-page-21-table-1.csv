"The  argument  that  an  executive  discretion  of  this  nature 
is"
"unfettered  or  absolute,  that  the  repository  of  such  a  discretion"
"can do  what he pleases, is not  a new one. But it is one  which"
"has  been  unequivocally  rejected.  The  discretion  conferred  in"
"1979  must  also  be  considered 
in 
the  background  of 
the"
"constitutional  guarantees  which  sought  to  make  the  Rule  of"
"Law  a  reality,  and  in  particular  Article  12.  An  example  was"
"suggested  to  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General:  where  after"
"an acquisition of one hundred contiguous allotments of land, for"
"an 
irrigation  project,  or 
for  a  road, 
the  project  had 
to  be"
"abandoned, 
for 
technical, 
financial  or  political  reasons, 
the"
"Minister  then  exercised  his  discretion  under  section  39A,  to"
"divest some allotments, while retaining others (in circumstances"
"in which no rational distinction could be made between the two"
"categories), 
perhaps 
influenced 
by 
personal 
or 
political"
"considerations.  It  was  readily  conceded  that  such  a  decision"
"could  be  challenged  in  an  application  under  Article  126.  That"
"alone  is  enough  to  establish  that  the  discretion  under  section"
"39A is not unfettered; and here, out of seven lands acquired in"
"one  acquisition  proceeding,  the  first  lot  has  been  divested,  but"
"not  other  lots  which  are  equally  unaffected  by  the  proposed"
"shopping  complex,  and  no  grounds  have  been  urged  to  justify"
"that  discrimination.  The  Respondents  did  not  contend  that  the"
"time limit prescribed by Article 126(2) applied in respect of this"
"allegation  of  the  violation  of  fundamental  rights  by  executive"
"action,  and  in  any  event  that  time  limit  has  not  been  made"
"applicable  where  such  a  question  arises 
in 
the  course  of"
"hearing a writ application (cf. Article 126 (3)). However, leaving"
"aside  constitutional  considerations,  according  to  the  general"
