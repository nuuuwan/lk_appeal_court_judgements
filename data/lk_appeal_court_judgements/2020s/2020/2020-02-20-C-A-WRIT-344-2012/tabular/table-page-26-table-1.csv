"26"
"The  powers  of  public  authorities  are 
therefore  essentially"
"different from  those  of  private  persons.  A  man  making  his  will"
"may,  subject  to  any  rights  of  his  dependents,  dispose  of  his"
"property  just  as  he  may  wish.  He  may  act  out  of  malice  or  a"
"spirit of revenge, but in law  this does not affect his exercise of"
"his  power.  In  the  same  way  a  private  person  has  an  absolute"
"power to release a debtor, or, where the law permits, to evict a"
"tenant, regardless of his  motives. This  is unfettered discretion."
"But a public authority may do neither unless it acts reasonably"
"and in good faith and upon the lawful and relevant grounds of"
"public  interest.  Unfettered  discretion  is  wholly  inappropriate  to"
"a public authority, which possesses powers solely in order that"
"it may use them for the public good."
"There  is  nothing  paradoxical  in  the  imposition  of  such  legal"
"limits. It would indeed be paradoxical if they were not imposed."
"Nor  is  this  principle  an  oddity  of  British  or  American  law;  it  is"
"equally  prominent  in  French  law.  Nor  is  it  a  special  restriction"
"which 
fetters  only 
local  authorities; 
it  applies  no 
less 
to"
"Ministers  of  the  Crown.  Nor 
is 
it  confined  to  the  sphere  of"
"administration: 
it  operates  wherever  discretion 
is  given 
for"
"some  public  purpose, 
for  example  where  a 
judge  has  a"
"discretion  to  order  jury  trial.  It  is only  where powers  are given"
"for 
the  personal  benefit  of 
the  person  empowered 
that 
the"
"discretion  is  absolute.  Plainly  this  can  have  no  application  in"
"public law‚Äù."
"I  hold  that  the  true  intent  and  meaning  of  the  amending  Act"
"was  to  empower  the  Minister  to  restore  to  the  original  owner"
"land 
for 
the  acquisition 
(or 
retention)  of  which 
there  was"
