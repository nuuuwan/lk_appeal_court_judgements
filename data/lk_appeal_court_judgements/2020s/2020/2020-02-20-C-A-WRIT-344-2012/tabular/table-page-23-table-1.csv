"understanding  to  discern  between  falsity  and  truth,  between"
"wrong  and  right,  between  shadows  and  substance,  between"
"equity  and  colourable  glosses  and  pretences,  and  not  to  do"
"according to their wills and private affections; for as one saith,"
"talis  discretio  discretionem  confundit.”  (Lord  Hailsbury,  citing"
"Coke, in Rooke’s case (1598) 5 Co. Rep. 99b)"
"“Wheresoever a commissioner or other person hath power given"
"to  do  a  thing  at  his  discretion,  it  is  to  be  understood  of  sound"
"discretion, and according to law, and that this court hath power"
"to  redress  things  otherwise  done  by  them.”  (Estwick  v.  City  of"
"London (1647) Style 42)"
"“A  person  in  whom  is  vested  a  discretion  must  exercise  his"
"discretion  upon 
reasonable  grounds.  A  discretion  does  not"
"empower  a  man  to  do  what  he  likes  merely  because  he  is"
"minded  to  do  so—he  must  in  the  exercise  of  his  discretion  do"
"not  what he likes but  what he ought. In other  words, he must,"
"by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which"
"reason  directs.  He  must  act  reasonably.”  (Lord  Wrenbury  in"
"Roberts v. Hopwood (1925) AC 578, 613)"
"“Parliament  must  have 
conferred 
the  discretion  with 
the"
"intention  that 
it  should  be  used  to  promote  the  policy  and"
"objects  of  the  Act;  the  policy  and  objects  of  the  Act  must  be"
"determined  by  construing  the  Act  as  a  whole  and  construction"
"is always a matter of law for the court. In a matter of this kind"
"it 
is  not  possible  to  draw  a  hard  and  fast 
line,  but 
if  the"
"Minister,  by  reason  of  his  having  misconstrued  the  Act  or  for"
"any  other  reason,  so  uses  his  discretion  as  to  thwart  or  run"
