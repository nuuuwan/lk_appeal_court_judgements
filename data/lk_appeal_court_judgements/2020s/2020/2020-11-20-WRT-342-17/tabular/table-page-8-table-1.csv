"company is justified and if not justified, to what relief each"
"of them is entitled."
"After 
the 
inquiry, 
the  Arbitrator  made  the 
impugned  award"
"granting the relief sought by the employees."
"The thrust of the argument of learned Counsel for the Petitioner"
"Lanka Sathosa Limited is that there was no evidence before the"
"Arbitrator to come to that conclusion. I am unable agree."
"As 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  1st  Respondent  employee  rightly"
"points out, it is illogical to say the 1st Respondent employee and"
"the  other  494  employees 
refused 
the  voluntary 
retirement"
"scheme,  whereby  they  would  have  easily  benefitted  financially,"
"and  opted  instead  to  join  Lanka  Sathosa  Limited  as  brand-new"
"employees.  If they wanted to join Lanka Sathosa Limited as new"
"employees, 
it  seems 
they  could  have  done  so  after  having"
"accepted  the  voluntary  retirement  package  offered  by  Sathosa"
"Retail  Limited.  They  did  not  accept  the  voluntary  retirement"
"package because they wanted their period of service to continue"
"uninterrupted."
"In  addition 
to  defending 
the  arbitral  award  on 
the  merits,"
"learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent employee takes up three"
"preliminary objections to the maintainability of this application."
"Notwithstanding I am loath to uphold preliminary objections as"
"a  means  of  disposing  cases,  in  the  facts  and  circumstances  of"
"this case, I think, of the three, two are cogent enough to dismiss"
"the  Petitionerâ€™s  application 
in 
limine  without  going 
into 
the"
"merits of the matter."
