"O
ne objection is failure to add necessary parties as Respondents"
"to 
the  application.  The  Petitioner  admits 
that 
the  dispute"
"referred  for  arbitration  was  in  respect  of  495  employees.    The"
"arbitral award is in favour of all those 495 employees.  However,"
"the  Petitioner  in  the  petition  makes  only  one  employee  (i.e.  the"
"1st  Respondent  P.H.C.  Peiris)  a  party  and, 
regarding 
the"
"remaining employees, simply says “And 494 others”.  Those 494"
"employees  have  not  been  made  parties  to  the  case.    No  notices"
"were  sent  requiring  them  to  be  present  in  Court  to  defend  the"
"arbitral award, if they so desire.  Can this Court violate the audi"
"alteram partem rule with impunity and quash the decision of the"
"Arbitrator  made 
in 
favour  of 
those  494  employees  without"
"affording  them  a  hearing?  Certainly  not.    Those  494  employees"
"are necessary parties to this application, without whom the case"
"cannot  proceed. 
  The  Petitioner,  having  realised 
this  grave"
"omission,  endeavoured  to  amend  the  petition  to  add  them  as"
"parties  at  a 
later  stage  of 
the  case. 
  The  application 
for"
"amendment  was  refused  by  this  Court  and,  on  appeal,  by  the"
"Supreme  Court.  The 
failure  to  add  those  494  employees  as"
"parties  to  the  application  is  fatal.    On  that  ground  alone,  the"
"application shall be dismissed."
"Another preliminary objection is laches.  The arbitral award had"
"been  made 
on 
22.01.2017 
and 
the 
Petitioner 
filed 
this"
"application 11 months later on 19.10.2017.  The Petitioner does"
"not  explain  this  inordinate  delay  in  the  petition.    This  itself"
"disentitles the Petitioner to the discretionary and equitable relief"
"of certiorari."
