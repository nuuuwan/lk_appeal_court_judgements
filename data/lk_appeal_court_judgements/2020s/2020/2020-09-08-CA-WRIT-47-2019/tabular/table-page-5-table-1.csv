"Government  in  the  entity  that  is  engaged  in  the  industry,  business  or  undertaking."

"that it is not the Government, but the Bank of Ceylon that holds the majority shares"
"in the Petitioner. In the light of the above conclusion of this Court that the business"

"Bank of Ceylon, it is the view of this Court that the Petitioner has failed to meet the"
"second requirement that must be satisfied in order to qualify for the exclusion."
