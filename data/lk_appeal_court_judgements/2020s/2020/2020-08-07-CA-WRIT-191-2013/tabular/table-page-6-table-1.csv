"R
espondent  says  the  said  document  has  been  signed  by  none"
"other than the present Chairman of the Petitioner company."
"The  3rd  Respondent,  with  reference  to  the  documents  marked"
"3R14,  3R15,  3R16,  submits  that  deduction  and  payment  of"
"Employees’ Provident Fund, Employees’ Trust Fund and Income"
"Tax  Deductions  (PAYE  Tax)  are  clear  proof  the  3rd  Respondent"
"was  an  employee  of  the  Petitioner  company.  I  am  in  agreement"
"with this contention."
"In response, the Petitioner, producing inter alia P5, says the 3rd"
"Respondent coerced other officers of the Petitioner company into"
"remitting  contributions 
in  the  3rd  Respondent’s  name  to  the"
"Employees’ 
Provident 
Fund 
and 
Employees’ 
Trust 
Fund."
"Investigation into these matters is clearly outside the purview of"
"the  writ  Court  and  perhaps  even  the  Commissioner  General  of"
"Labour."
"Hence,  even  on  merits,  I  cannot  say  the  decision  of  the  1st"
"Respondent  that  the  3rd  Respondent  was  an  employee  of  the"
"Petitioner  company  and  he 
is  entitled  to  his  salary 
for  the"
"months  of  June  and  July  2009 
is  outrageous  or  perverse."
"Therefore, the Petitioner cannot succeed in this application."
"Before I part with this Judgment let me also add the following."
"In  Hotel  Galaxy  (Pvt)  Ltd  v.  Mercantile  Hotels  Management  Ltd,1"
"the Supreme Court, citing Loku Menika v. Selenduhamy,2 Habibu"
"Lebbe  v.  Punchi  Etana,3  Caldera  v.  Santiagopulle,4  Weeratne  v."
"1 [1987] 1 Sri LR 5."
"2 (1947) 48 NLR 353."
"3 (1894) 3 CLR 85."
