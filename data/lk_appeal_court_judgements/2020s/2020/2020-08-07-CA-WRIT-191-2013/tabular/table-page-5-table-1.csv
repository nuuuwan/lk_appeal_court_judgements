the  B-card  and  Central  Bank  Statement  of  Accounts"
"marked 
1R1, 
1R3(a), 
1R3(b);  his  Employees’ 
Trust  Fund"
"Statement  of  Accounts  marked  1R2(a)  and  1R2(b);  and  salary"
"slips marked 1R4(a), 1R4(b) and 1R4(c). Based on this evidence,"
"the 1st Respondent made the impugned Order dated 12.06.2013,"
"directing  the  Petitioner  to  pay  arrears  of  two  months’  salary  to"
"the 3rd Respondent."
"It  is  thereafter  that  the  Petitioner,  with  great  vigour,  rushed  to"
"this  Court  on  09.07.2013  to  have  the  said  Order  set  aside."
"Together  with  the  petition,  the  Petitioner  tenders  a  spate  of"
"documents  which 
should  have  been 
tendered 
to 
the  1st"
"Respondent  at  the  inquiry.    This  Court,  in  the  exercise  of  writ"
"jurisdiction, cannot hold an inquiry into the payment of arrears"
"of salary de novo.  This has already been done, albeit ex parte."
"In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  as  narrated  by  the"
"Petitioner itself, I do not think the decision of the 1st Respondent"
"to have the inquiry ex parte is unreasonable."
"The  Petitioner  has  tendered  several  documents  to  this  Court,"
"such  as  P7-P23,  P26,  P28-P32  P26,  P49,  P51,  to  say  the  3rd"
"Respondent  was  not 
the  Finance  Director  of 
the  Petitioner"
"company  and  the  position  was  held  by  another  person  by  the"
"name  of  Sampath  Witharana.    Conversely,  the  3rd  Respondent"
"has tendered several documents, such as 3R3-3R22, to say it is"
"he  who  was  the  Finance  Director  of  the  Petitioner  company."
"Drawing the attention of the Court to the document marked 3R3"
"wherein  he 
is 
identified  as 
the  Finance  Director, 
the  3rd"
