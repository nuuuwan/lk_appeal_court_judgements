"execute  a  deed  of  transfer  in  favour  of  the  2nd  Respondent.  This  Court  must"
"observe  that  the  Petitioner  and  the  2nd  Respondent  had  entered  into  similar"

"Respondent settling the sums of money borrowed from the Petitioner on each"
"occasion.1 The Petitioner states that in this instance, the 2nd Respondent failed"
"to  repay  the  said  loan  with  interest,  and  by  virtue  of  such  failure,  he  is  the"
"present owner of the property referred to in ‘A1a’."
