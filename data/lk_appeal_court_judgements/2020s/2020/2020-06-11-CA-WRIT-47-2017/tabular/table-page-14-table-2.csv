"until  there 
is  a  determination  of  the  ownership  by  a  Court  of  competent"
"jurisdiction, was answered by this Court in the following manner:"
"â€œIt  is  undoubtedly  correct  that  the  burden  of  proving  ouster  among  co-"
"owners  rests  on  the  party  claiming  such  ouster 
in  a  duly  constituted"
"action.  But  the question before  the  3rd Respondent at  the  inquiry  was  to"
"decide  on 
the 
issue  of  a  gemming 
license 
in  accordance  with 
the"
"regulations.  Regulation  8  made 
under 
the  Act 
provides 
that 
the"
"Corporation  may, 
if 
it 
is  satisfied  that  the  applicant  for  a 
license  has"
"obtained the consent of the owners of more than 2/3 share of co-owned"
"land  issue  such  a  license.  It  appears  that  this  is  a  discretionary  power"
"vested  in  the  Corporation.  The  question  before  this  court,  therefore,  is"
"whether this power has been exercised within justifiable limits."
