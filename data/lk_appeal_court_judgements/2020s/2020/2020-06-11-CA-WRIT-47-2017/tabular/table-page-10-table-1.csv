"caelum  et  infernos”,  which  means,  “the  rights  of  the  surface  owner  extend"
"upwards to the heavens and downward toward the center of the earth”."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  6th  Respondent  has  drawn  the  attention  of  this"
"Court to the judgment in Jayasundera vs Wijetilake and Others.10 In that case,"
"the  respondent  had 
instituted  action  seeking  a  declaration  of  title  to  the"
"corpus and an injunction restraining the appellant from gemming in the land."
"The  position  of 
the  appellant  was 
that  his  predecessor 
in 
title,  Punchi"
"Mahattaya had executed a deed of transfer in favour of the plaintiff, but with"
"the  following  reservation:  “ueksla  .rd  .eks
Sfus  n,h  ug  b;srs  lrf.k”.  The"
"learned District Judge, whilst recognizing the division of ownership rights, had"
"come  to  a  finding  that  the  rights  reserved  by  Punchi  Mahaththaya  does  not"
"devolve on his heirs and are extinguished on his death."
"T
his Court, having considered whether a reservation such as the above clause"
"can be inserted by a transferor, held as follows:"
"“It  is  to  be  seen  that  minerals  form  part  of  the  land  and  in  a  normal"
"transfer of a land it conveys title to the minerals as well. Thus if the title to"
"the minerals were to be reserved in the transfer it must be stated so in the"
"instrument of transfer."
"I
n the deed in question marked P4 the vendor has specifically excepted the"
"minerals in the operative part of the deed. Thus it is very clear that he has"
"not sold the mineral rights. In the habendum it is stated:"
