"Hence  it  is  crystal  clear  the  word  TRADE  means  KARMANTHAYA,  which"
"also means velandama (business) or sale.”"
"Whilst one must not strain the language in a statute to impose a tax liability,"
"one must equally be mindful not to strain in favour of the taxpayer when the"
"wording is clear. In view of the material referred to above, I am satisfied that"
"the  word  ‘lraudka;h’  is  one  of  the  words  to  which  the  word  trade  can  be"
"translated  into,  and  that  the  said  word  ‘lraudka;h’  in  Section  247B  does  not,"
"and should not be restricted to an industry. In the said circumstances, I am of"
"the  view  that  there  is  no  inconsistency  or  contradiction  between  the  Sinhala"
"and  English  texts  of  the  said  Section,  and  that  the  liability  of  the  Petitioner"
"remains unaffected."
