"within  the  1st  Respondent,  so  that  an  appropriate  decision  whether  to  accept  the"
"retirement subject to  the outcome of the inquiry could have been taken. However,"
"due  to  the  negligence  or  otherwise  of  the  officials  of  the  1st  Respondent,  such  a"
"course of action has not been adopted."
"I
f the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent was apprised of such fact, I am of the"
"view that the Board of Directors, acting in terms of Rule 1.3 of ‘X39’ could have taken"
"a  decision  whether  to  continue  the  disciplinary  proceedings  already  commenced"
"against the Petitioner, notwithstanding the Petitioner reaching the maximum age of"
"employment. If an affirmative decision had been taken, that would mean that the 1st"
"Respondent had permitted the retirement of the Petitioner, subject to the outcome"
"of the inquiry."
"T
he Respondents have not placed before this Court any such decision of the Board of"
"Directors  of  the  1st  Respondent.  In  paragraphs  52,  53,  56,  60  (c),  (f)  and  (g)  of  the"
"petition, the Petitioner has specifically stated that he retired from service with effect"
"from 26th December 2015. Except for a general denial of the said paragraphs,1 the 1st"
"Respondent has not claimed in its Statement of Objections that the retirement was"
"accepted subject to the outcome of the inquiry."
"T
hus,  even  if  the  Establishments  Code  applied,  the  1st  Respondent  could  not  have"
"proceeded  with  the  disciplinary  inquiry  against  the  Petitioner  in  the  absence  of  a"
"decision  that  the  retirement  of  the  Petitioner  has  been  accepted  subject  to  the"
"outcome of an inquiry, and the Petitioner had been informed of such fact. If, on the"
"other hand, such a decision was taken, that decision would not have been illegal as"
"the 1st Respondent has every right to take decisions with regard to its employees."
"I
n these circumstances, I am of the view that the decision of the 1st Respondent to"
"proceed with the inquiry and to withhold the pension of the Petitioner is ultra vires"
"the powers of the 1st Respondent vis-à-vis ‘X39’."
"1 Vide paragraphs 3, 6 and 26 of the Statement of Objections dated 10th August 2017. I have disregarded the"
"Statement  of  Objections  dated  22nd  November  2016,  which  had  admitted  paragraphs  53  and  56  of  the"
"petition."
