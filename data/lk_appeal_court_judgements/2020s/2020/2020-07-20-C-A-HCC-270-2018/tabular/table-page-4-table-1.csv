"to consider the grounds of appeal urged by the Appellant."
"One of the  grounds  was  that  the  evidence  of  the witness  Prasanna  Perera"
"was not analysed properly by the High Court for its credibility. In  this context, it"
"must  be  noted  that  the  Appellant  did  not  cross-examine  the  witness  since  he"
"opted 
to  abscond.  Therefore, 
the  Appellant  relies  on 
the  cross-examination"
"conducted on behalf of the 2nd  accused to sustain his contention. The 2nd  accused"
"has  suggested  to  the  witness  that  he  was  not involved  with  this  incident.  The"
"witness  admitted 
that  position.  Other 
than  eliciting 
the  2nd  accused's  non"
"participation, 
there  was  no  cross-examination  of 
the  witness 
to  assail  his"
"credibility. In short, the High Court had no basis to reject his evidence."
