"","“In the matter before us, on the relevant date, namely, the 3rd of July 1996"
"","–  the  date  when  the  Tenders  were  closed,  the  only  tenderer  who  was"
"","qualified  was  SmithKIine  Beecham  Biologicals  S.A.  since  only  its  Rubella"
"","Viral Vaccine was registered as required by the Tender document (P1). The"
"","only responsive bid was therefore that of SmithKIine Beecham  Biologicals"
"","S.A. although it was not the lowest bid. The only tenderer who was able to"
"","comply with the requirement in Clause 19 that a copy of the certificate of"
"","registration should be annexed to the Tender was SmithKIine  Biologicals"
"","Beecham  S.A. Therefore the only complete tender was that of SmithKIine"
"","Beecham Biologicals and therefore it was the only tender that qualified for"
"","evaluation.  The  Tender  Board  misdirected  itself  by  believing  that  it  was"
"","obliged  to  recommend  the  acceptance  of  the  tender  of  Biocine    S.p.A"
"","because its price was “the lowest responsive offer”. It may have been the"
"","lowest offer, but at the relevant date, namely the 3rd of July 1996 it was"
"","not a “responsive” offer at all, for Biocine S.p.A. had failed to comply with"
"the condition of registration.”9",""
