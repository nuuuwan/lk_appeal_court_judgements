"This Court must observe at this stage that what the Petitioner has extended by"
"‘P7a’ is only the validity date of the bid security and not the bid validity period."
"Thus,  it  appears  that  even  though  the  Petitioner  sent  the  letter  ‘P7a’,  its  bid"
"continued to be non-responsive for the reason that the validity period of the"
"bid did not meet the date stipulated by the Colombo Municipal Council."
