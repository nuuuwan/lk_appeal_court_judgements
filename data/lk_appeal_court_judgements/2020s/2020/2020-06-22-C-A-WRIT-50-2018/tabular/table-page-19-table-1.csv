"Such  conduct  has  clearly  changed 
the 
‘goal  post’  and  hindered 
the"
"providing of an equal opportunity, by precluding other bidders who could"
"have  otherwise 
submitted  a  higher  bid 
than 
the  11th  Respondent,"
"unencumbered by the financial capability requirement, from participating"
"in the bidding process. Had the waiver been notified at the point of calling"
"for  bids, more entities  would  have  been eligible  to  submit  bids.  It  is  also"
"discriminatory towards all the other bidders in the present case, who were"
"evaluated by the TEC, including the Petitioners, based on all the prescribed"
"qualification requirements, including that of financial capability, while the"
"11th Respondent’s compliance to it was dispensed with."
