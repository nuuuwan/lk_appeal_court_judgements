"“The requirements in a tender notice can be classified into two categories"
"- those which lay down the essential conditions of eligibility and the others"
"which  are  merely  ancillary  or  subsidiary  with  the  main  object  to  be"
"achieved by the condition. In the first case, the authority issuing the tender"
"may  be  required  to  enforce  them  rigidly.  In  the  other  cases,  it  must  be"
"open  to  the  authority  to  deviate  from  and  not  to  insist  upon  the  strict"
"literal compliance of the condition in appropriate cases.”"
