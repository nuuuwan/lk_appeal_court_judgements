"Section 33(1) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000, as amended provides"
"that, “No person shall fill any extent of paddy land or remove any soil from any extent"
"of  paddy  land  or  erect  any  structure  on  any  extent  of  paddy  land  except  with  the"
"written  permission  of  the  Commissioner-General.”  Thus,  it  is  noted  that  there  is  no"
"absolute prohibition on the filling of paddy lands, and that filling can take place with"
"the  prior  approval  of  the  Commissioner  General  of  Agrarian  Development,  the  11th"
"Respondent in this application."
