"T
he  Petitioners  admit  that  the lands which  are the  subject  matter  of  this  application"
"were  acquired  in  1992  under  the  proposed  Anuradhapura  Sacred  City  Development"
"Plan. Although the Petitioners state that their paddy lands too were acquired in 2000,"
"the Petitioners have not adduced any proof to support the position that the said lands"
"belonged  to  them.  The  Respondents  claim  that  compensation  has  been  paid  for  all"
"lands  that  were  acquired.  The  Petitioners  state  that  even  though  their  lands  were"
"acquired,  they  have  been  in  uninterrupted  possession  of  the  lands  and  continue  to"
"cultivate paddy on the said lands. In 2006, a decision had been taken to divest those"
"lands that were not required."
