"Partition  action.  There  was  no  evidence  to  prove  that  Piyadasa  was  having  any  adverse"
"possession on the disputed land, even after 1973."
"In  the  case  of Seeman  Vs.  David  2000  (3)  SLR  23, 
it  was  held  that  the  proof  of adverse"
"possession  is  a condition precedent to claim  prescriptive rights."
"It is  important to note that the 1st  Defendant claimed that, he achieved to retain possession,"
"despite  efforts  by  two  persons  to  oust  him  in  1987  and  1988  period.  One  person  was  OIC"
"Narahenpita  Police  station, 
Inspector  Fabian  Mitchell  and 
the  other  one  was  named"
"Periyasamy. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to  note 
that  Defendant  Piyadasa  declared  ownership  by"
"Prescriptive title on 04.05.1988 by Deed of Declaration bearing number 334 attested by A.H.T."
"Dayananda N.P. The plan included in this deed was the Partition Plan No. 2332 in the previous"
"Partition case 12462/P of 1971, drawn by S.R. Yapa  Licensed Surveyor. It reflects that Piyadasa"
"was having a knowledge about the Partition action. Virtually speaking 1st  Defendant Piyadasa"
"could  have  claimed  prescription  after completing 10 years from  04.05.1988.  As  the  present"
"DC  case  was  instituted  on  01.06.1992,  Piyadasa  is  unable  to  claim  prescription  against  the"
"Plaintiff during that 4-year period."
"The  court  further  observes 
that,  after  Piyadasa  was 
threatened  by 
those  2  persons 
in"
"1988/1989, he has given evidence to say that he was not living in that disputed land as  his life"
"was  in  danger.  This  also  confirms that  he  was  not having  uninterrupted  possession  on  the"
"land in question."
"Thereafter Piyadasa filed an action 5812/ZL, against those 2 persons, namely Fabian  Mitchell"
"and  Periyasamy  in  the  D.C.  Cololmbo. This  case  went  ex-parte  against  both  of them  and"
"Piyadasa  had  used 
this  ex-parte  Judgment  to  confirm  his  Prescriptive  title  for  the  next"
"transaction.  Periyasamy's address is  given  as  No.  163/7, Nawala  Road,  Narahenpita which  is"
"the address  of the same  disputed property in  the  present action.  If Periyasamy was  residing"
"in  that  same  property,  then  Piyadasa  would  have  definetely  been  residing  in  some  other"
"place. Appeal  brief confirms that, Piyadasa  has used his  residential address as  No.28, Nawala"
"Road,  Colombo 5,  for the DC  case  No.  5812/ZL. This clearly proves that even  at that time he"
"was not living on the disputed land."
"The  Defendant  states  that  as  per  the  evidence  given  by 
the  1st  Defendant  Respondent"
"Piyadasa, he claims to have had uninterrupted possession of the property from 1962 until the"
