here can be no doubt that the origin of the lands claimed by the Petitioners"
"and  the  Respondents  emanate  from  the  same  source,  namely  the  1A  1R"

"produced by the 2nd Petitioner with his Counter Affidavit, marked ‘CA1’ clearly"
"establish  that  the  land  claimed  by  the  Petitioners  and  the  land  on  which  the"
"Service Station is situated are adjoining lands, and that the Northern boundary"
"of the Petitioners’ land is the Service Station or in other words, the Southern"
"boundary of the Service Station is the land claimed by the Petitioners."
