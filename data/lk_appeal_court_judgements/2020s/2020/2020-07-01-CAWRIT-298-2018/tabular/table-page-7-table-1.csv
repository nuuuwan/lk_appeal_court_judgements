"Ampara5 where it was held as follows:"
"“
Where  the  structure  of  the  entire  Act  is  to  preclude  investigations  and"
"inquiries and where it is expressly provided (a) the only defence that can"
"be  put  forward  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  under  this  Act  can  be"
"based  only  upon  a  valid  permit  or  written  authority  of  the  State  and  (b)"
"special provisions have been made for aggrieved parties to obtain relief, I"
"am of the opinion that the Act expressly precludes the need for an inquiry"
"by  the  competent authority  before he  forms the opinion that any  land is"
"State land.”"
