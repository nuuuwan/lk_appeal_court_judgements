"without any  objections. The  2nd  Defendant gave  evidence  on  behalf of the  Plaintiffs and  stated"
"that the 1st  Defendant remained  on  the disputed  land  as  his  licensee  [Pages  127 and  135 of the"
"Appeal  Brief] ."
"Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have marked the plaint dated 16.06.1975 in District Court of Gampaha"

"in  case  no.  18404/P is  lot D of Kahatagahawatta  which  is  bounded  on  the  east  by  lot E of the"

"In  view of the above, I hold that the learned  Additional  District Judge was correct in  holding that"
"the paper title of the disputed  land  is  with the Plaintiffs."
"This leaves the question of prescriptive title pleaded  by the lA Substituted Defendant. She stated"
"that she  and  her predecessors  were in  possession  of the disputed  land for several  decades prior"
