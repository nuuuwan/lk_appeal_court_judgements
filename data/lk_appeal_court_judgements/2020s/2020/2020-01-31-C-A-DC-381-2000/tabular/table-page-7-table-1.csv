"""The  principle  of law  is  well  established  that  a  person  who  bases  his  title  in  adverse"
"possession  must show by  clear and  unequivocal evidence that his possession  was  hostile"
"to the  real  owner and  amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed.  In  order"
"to constitute adverse possession, the possession  must be in  denial ofthe title ofthe true"
"owner. The acts of the person in possession should be  irreconcilable with the rights of the"
"true owner; the  person  in  possession  must claim  to be  so  as  of right as  against the true"
"owner. Where there is  no hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner there can  be"
"no  adverse  possession. 
In  deciding  whether  the  alleged  acts  of the  person  constitute"
"adverse possession, regard must be had to the animus ofthe person doing those acts, and"
"this  must  be  ascertained 
from 
the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case  and 
the"
"relationship of the parties. Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in the case

"of a stranger may not attract  such  a presumption,  in  the  case  of persons  standing  in"
"legal 
relationships.  The  presumption 
represents 
the  most 
likely

"inference that may be drawn in the context of the relationship of the parties. The Court"
"will  always  attribute  possession  to  a  lawful  title  where  that  is  possible.  Where  the"
"possession  may  be  either  lawful  or  unlawful,  it  must  be  assumed,  in  the  absence  of"
"eVidence, that the possession  is  lawful. Thus,  where property belonging to the mother is"
"held  by the son, the presumption will be that the enjoyment of the son  was on  behalf of"

"is  consequently  not  adverse 
to  her.  It  will  not  enable 
the 
title  of  the  mother  and"
"possession  to  acquire title  by  adverse  possession.  Where  possession  commenced  with"
"permission,  it  will  be  presumed  to  so  continue  until  and  unless  something  adverse"
"occurred  about it. The  onus is  on  the licensee to show when and  how the possession"
"became adverse. Continued appropriation of the income and payment of taxes will not"
"be  sufficient  to  convert  permissive  possession  into  adverse  possession,  unless  such"
"conduct  unequivocally manifests  denial  of the  permitter's title.  In  order to  discharge"
"such  onus, there must be clear and  affirmative evidence of the change in the character of"
"possession .  The  evidence  must  point 
to 
the 
time  of  commencement  of  adverse"
