"","The  general  approach  ought  to  be  that  a  claimant  who"
"","succeeds in establishing the unlawfulness of administrative"
"","action is entitled to be granted a remedial order.  The court"
"","does,  however,  have  discretion―in  the  sense  of  assessing"
"“what 
is  fair  and 
just 
to  do 
in","the  particular  case”―to"
"withhold  a  remedy  altogether  or","to  grant  a  declaration"
"(rather 
than  a  more","coercive  quashing,  prohibiting  or"
"","mandatory order or injunction which may have been sought"
"","by the claimant) or to grant relief in respect of one aspect of"
"the impugned decision, but not others.",""
