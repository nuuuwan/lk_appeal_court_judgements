"This case has a chequered history."
"J.D.  Liyanage  made  a  statutory  declaration  marked  1R1  under"
"section  18  of  the  Land  Reform  Law,  No.1  of  1972,  as  amended"
"(LRC  Law). 
  The  Land  Reform  Commission 
(LRC)  made  a"
"statutory  determination  dated  28.02.1974  marked  1R2  under"
"section  19(1)(a)  of  the  LRC  Law,  specifying  the  portion  of  land"
"the Petitioner was permitted to retain, i.e. fifty acres of the estate"
"including 
the 
tea 
factory  situated 
thereon. 
  Thereafter, 
the"
"statutory  determination  was  gazetted  on  30.09.1976 
in 
the"
"gazette marked 1R3(a), but notably excluding the tea factory."
"Predominantly due to the exclusion of the tea factory in the land"
"he was permitted to retain, J.D. Liyanage filed a writ application"
"seeking to quash  by certiorari  the gazette 1R3(a)  and to  compel"
"the  LRC  by  mandamus 
to  deliver  possession  of 
the 
land"
"including the tea factory to him.  This Court, by Judgment dated"
"04.09.1981  marked 
P8, 
decided 
that 
the 
first 
statutory"
"determination 
dated 
28.02.1974 
is 
“the 
lawful 
statutory"
"determination” made under section 19(1)(a) of the LRC Law, and"
"quashed the purported second statutory determination gazetted"
"in  1R3(a)  but  refused  mandamus.    Let  me  quote  the  relevant"
"portion  of 
the  Judgment  of  Justice  Atukorale 
(with  Justice"
"Colin-Thome agreeing) for convenience."
