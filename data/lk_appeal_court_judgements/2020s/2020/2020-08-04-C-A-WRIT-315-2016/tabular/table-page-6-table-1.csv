"maintained  by  the  Commission  which  was  made  available"
"to us at the hearing, it seems clear that the Commission has"
"on  28.2.1974,  in  terms  of  S.19(1)(a)  of  the  Land  Reform"
"Law, made a statutory determination specifying the portion"
"of  land  that  the  petitioner  should  be  permitted  to  retain."
"According  to  this  determination  he  has  been  allowed  to"
"retain  50  acres  of  the  estate 
including 
the 
tea  factory."
"Subsequently  at  the  instance  of  the  Member  of  Parliament"
"for  Baddegama  at  that  time  and  the  then  Minister,  the"
"Chairman  of  the  Commission  appears  to  have  varied  this"
"determination.  This  varied  determination  is  set  out  in  the"
"letter  P2  and  has  been  published 
in  the  Gazette  P3.

"deprives the Petitioner of the portion that he  was originally"
"allowed to retain by the Commission. S.19(1)(a) of the Land"
"Reform  Law  enacts  that  the  Commission  shall  as  soon  as"
"practicable  make  a  determination 
(called 
the  statutory"
"determination)  specifying  the  portion  which  the  statutory"

to"
"retain. 
In  making 
this  determination 
the  Commission 
is"
"obliged to take into consideration the preferences expressed"
"by  the  declarant  in  his  declaration.  In  his  declaration  the"
"petitioner  stated  his  preference  to  retain  the  portion  where"
"the  tea  factory  was  situated.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the"
"determination  made  by  the Commission  on 28.2.1974  was"
"the lawful statutory determination under S.19(1)(a). The law"
"contemplates 
only 
one 
statutory 
determination. 
This"
"determination cannot in my view be varied by the Chairman"
"of  the  Commission.  I  am  therefore  of  the  opinion  that  the"
