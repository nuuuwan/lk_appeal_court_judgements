recovery . 
However, 
it  was

established 
beyond"
"reasonable  doubt  that  those  items  belonged  to  the  accused,  that  he"
"placed  them there,  or that the  knife  in fact was  used in  the  assault of"
"the  deceased.  These  items  were  recovered  from  an  open  area  where"
"not only the accused but other people also  had access to.  If at all what"
"can be  presumed is he  had knowledge  of the items being there,  which"
"is  not  sufficient  to  convict 
the  appellant  of  having  committed 
the"
"offence he was charged with,  in the given circumstances in this case."
