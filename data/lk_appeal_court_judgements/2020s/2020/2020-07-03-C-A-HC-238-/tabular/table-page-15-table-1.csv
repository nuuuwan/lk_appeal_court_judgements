"In the circumstances of the 
instant case,  I do  not see any reason"
"why  the 
identification  of the  appellant 
by  PW  5 ,  as  the  person  who"
"instructed 
him 
and  also  one  of the  witnesses  who  signed  the  deeds"
"before  him,  which  were  never  in  issue  before  the  court  ,should  be"
"disregarded,  especially  when  it  was  not  denied  by  the  appellant,  only"
"based  on  the  fact  that  PW  5 
is  considered  an  adverse  witness.  It  is"
"observed that there is not even a  suggestion in the trial court,  that the"
"appellant was not present when the deeds were attested. Therefore, it is"
"my opinion that the argument of the counsel fails on that point, and the"
"identification  of the  appellant  by  PW  5  is  relevant  evidence  which  can"
"be accepted by Court."
