"","The  senior  assistant  examiner  K.  Kumudu  Apsara  (PW  2)  has"
"","testified  for  the prosecution marking the government analyst report as"
"","P  9.  From her evidence it appeared that the marking of the documents"
"","sent to the government analyst department is somewhat different to the"
"","markings given in the trial court."
"","In  fact  this  was  elucidated  by  the  intervention  of the  trial judge"
"","(page 263) otherwise if it went unnoticed, there would have been a  major"
"","confusion  in  this  regard.  After  the judge's intervention  it was  clarified"
"","by the learned State counsel and  specific markings were given."
"","When 
the  commission  was  issued 
from 
the  District  Court  of"
"","Kuliyapitiya (page  243)  the following  markings were given,  for  example"
"","PI  for  Deed  3852, P2 for Deed No  3678,  P 3  for Deed  1839, P4 for Deed"
"","No  1851, P5 for the specimen signatures of PW  1.  At the trial court,  the"
"","disputed  deeds with  the  signatures were  marked  as,  Deed  1839 as  PI"
"","and Deed  1851  as P3 .  (emphasis added)"
"","In  page 252 of the appeal brief in her evidence,  PW  2  has testified"
"","that  the  signatures 
in  Deed  3852,  Deed  3678 
is  similar  with 
the"
"","specimen  signature  as well  as  the  writing in  documents  submitted by"
"","PW  1 namely in documents marked as 
P  6  and P  7."
"","Further, that the signatures in the disputed deeds 1839 and 1851"
"","are  not  similar  to  the  specimen  signature  in  P  5.  Therefore,  with  the"
"","evidence of PW 2  it was established that the signatures in the disputed"
"","deeds were not of PW  1. This evidence was not assailed."
"","In the instant case the accused have not given  any evidence,  or a"
"","statement from  the dock and have exercised their right to  silence."
"","The learned judge has specifically stated that he is not considering"
"","the evidence of PW 5 and has relied only on the circumstantial evidence ."
