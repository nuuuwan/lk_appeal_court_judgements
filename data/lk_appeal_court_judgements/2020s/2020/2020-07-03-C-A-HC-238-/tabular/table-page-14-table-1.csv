"In  Ugar  Ahir &  Ors  v  State of Bihar AIR  1965  SC  277,  it  was"
"held,  ""The  maxim falsus  in uno, falsus in omnibus 
(false in one thing,"
"false  in everything) is  neither a  sound rule  of law  nor a  rule of practice."
"Hardly  one comes across a  witness whose evidence does  not contain a"
"or 
or 
grain 
of  untruth 
at 
any 
rate 
exaggeration, 
embroideries"
"embellishments.  It  is, 
therefore  the  duty  of the  Court  to  scrutinize  the"
"evidence carefully and in  terms of the felicitous  metaphor,  separate  the"
"grain from  the chaff  But,  it cannot obviously disbelieve  the substratum"
"of  the  prosecution  case  or 
the  material  parts  of  the  evidence  and"
"reconstruct a  story of its out of the rest."""
