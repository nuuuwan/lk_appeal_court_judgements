"In  the  circumstances  can  it  be  construed  that  the  Notary  was"
"personally  known  to  the  witnesses?  In  view  of  the  evidence  that  has"
"transpired,  definitely not in my opinion."
"It is admitted that PW 5 has not checked the identity of PW  1.  Only"
"the  Identity Card  No  of the 2 n d  accused,  as  a  witness,  is  mentioned  in"
"the  Deeds.  From  his  evidence  it appeared  that he  assumed  that  PW  1"
"did not have an identity card. However, it was the evidence ofPW 5, who"
"was  shown  PW  1  in  court,  that  PW  1  is  the  person  who  signed  the"
"impugned deeds."
"It is also established that PW  1 has not given any direct or specific"
"instructions regarding the execution of the Deeds to  PW  5  and that he"
"has seen the person who attested the deed only on that day."
"In page  155 of the Brief,  PW  5  has also  stated that the only  time"
"he attested a  deed with regard to a  nun was, when these two deeds were"
"attested . It appears from the evidence of PW  5  that from the information"
"he  received  from 
the  witnesses, 
(the  accused)  he  has  assumed  the"
"identification of 
PW  1,  who  is alleged to have come to  the office in the"
"ancestral house of his wife and attested the deeds."
"PW  1  totally  denied  meeting  or  instructing  PW  5  or  signing  the"
"deeds in issue in Kuliyapitiya.  She has categorically stated that she saw"
"PW 5 for the first time in Courts. There is no other evidence before Court"
"to  establish that either the witnesses  or someone  else  accompanied  or"
"directed  PW  1  to  go  to  Ku/iyapitiya  to  attest the  Deeds.  The  appellant"
"exercising her right to  be silent has not helped her case in  this regard,"
"as 
there 
is  no 
explanation  how  PW 
1  was  directed 
to 
come 
to"
"Ku/iyapitiya."
"Whether the Notary knew the witnesses to the deeds ( the accused)"
"is also  questionable as his evidence in page  123 of the brief is 
that he"
"thought the first witness Silver Guruge  Julius Gratien was the husband"
"of the appellant, then later on in the evidence has stated that he thinks"
"Gratien 
is  her  son. 
(Page  139). 
In  page  140  he  has  stated  that  he"
