"Thus,  from  the evidence of the  Notary himself,  it is apparent that"
"without  having  any  personal  knowledge  about  the  witnesses  he  was"
"required to  know when executing deeds,  even without ascertaining the"
"identity  of  the  transferor  he  has  executed  the  deeds  in  favour  of the"
"children of the appellant."
"The argument of the Counsel for  the Appellant  is 
that when the"
"evidence of PW  5  is  rejected  as  an  adverse  witness,  all  the evidence  of"
"the witness  ceases to  exist and that although in pages 457 and 466 of"
"the brief the learned High Court Judge has stated the evidence of PW  5"
"would not be considered, the learned Judge has made observations and"
"referred to the evidence of PW  5 to discredit the position of the appellant,"
"and 
thus, it appears that the evidence has been considered."
"The  question  to  be  considered  by  this  Court  now  is whether the"
"identification of the appellant by the Notary also  should be excluded as"
"argued  by the counsel for  the appellant as the Court has treated PW  5"
"as an adverse witness."
"is  based  on 
the 
The  maxIm  falsus 
in  uno,falsus 
in  omnibus"
"concept  that  when  a  witness  makes  a 
false  statement 
it  affects  his"
"entire credibility."
"In  Dahanayake  vs  Kannagara 72  CLW  62,  Queen  Vs  Abilinu"
"Fernando  70  NLR  73  it was  considered  that the  evidence  of a  hostile"
"witness  has  no  value  and  cannot  be 
relied  upon  by  either  party."
"However, 
this  rigid  interpretation  that  was  there  earlier  is  no  longer"
"recognized fully."
"In  Keshoram  Bora  vs  The  State  of Assam  1978  AIR  65-SC"
"1096 para 6  it was observed that 'while it is true that merely because a"
"witness  is  declared  hostile  his  evidence  cannot  be  rejected  on  that"
"ground  alone, 
it  is  equally  well  settled  that  when  once  a  prosecution"
"witness is  declared  hostile  the prosecution clearly exhibits  its intention"
"not to  rely itselfon the evidence of such witness and hence,  his version"
"cannot be treated as the version of the prosecution""."
