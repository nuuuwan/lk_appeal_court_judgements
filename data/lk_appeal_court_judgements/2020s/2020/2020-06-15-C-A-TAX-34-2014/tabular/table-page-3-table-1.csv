"Commissioner of Inland Revenue (65  N.l.R.  174 at 175) held that:"
"""The  word  ""outgoings""  means  what  goes  out  and 
is  a  word  of wide  import.  It  is  the"
"opposite  of the  equally  wide  expression  ""income""  which  means  what  comes  in.  In  the"
"context  the  word  ""expenses""  is 
limited  by  the  words  ""incurred  by  such  person  in  the"
"production  thereof""  while  the  words  ""outgoings""  is  not so  limited.  The  two words  are"
"designed  to  express  two  different  concepts  one  of  wider  import  than  the  other.  All"
"outgoings  are  not expenses  incurred  in  the  production  of the  profits  or  income;  but  all"
"expenses incurred in  the production of the profits or income are outgoings ... """
