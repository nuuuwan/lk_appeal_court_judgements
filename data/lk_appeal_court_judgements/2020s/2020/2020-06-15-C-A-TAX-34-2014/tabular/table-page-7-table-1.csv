"There  a subsidiary of a US  bank  in  the  UK  matched  its foreign  currency obligations with foreign"
"its  parent 
currency  assets.  The  subsid iary  borrowed  a  substantial  amount  of  money  from"
"company which it used to make loans in  US  dollars to its customers without converting the sum"
"into sterling.  The  subsidiary  regarded  the  loan  from  its  parent  company  as  a  US  dollar liability"
"which  it matched  with  US  dollar assets. The  subsidiary  repaid  the  loan  to  its  parent  company,"
"making use  of US  dollars which the subsidiary had."
"During the  period  from  its  inception  of the  loan  up to the  date  of repayment,  the value  of the"
"US  dollar against the sterling appreciated substantially, and  the Commissioner in the UK  sought"
"to  tax  the  book gain  and  disregard  the  equivalent  book  loss.  The  House  of Lords  rejected  the"
"Commissioners  contention,  and  accepted 
the 
taxpayer's  position 
that  only  profits  realized"
"should  be  converted  to sterling amounts,  as  the  Commissioner's  position  was  predicated  on  a"
"conversion  of the  principal  sums  into  sterling  amounts,  without which  the  amount  paid  in  US"
"dollars would  equal the amount borrowed  and  there would be  no profit or loss to report in  the"
"company's tax return ."
"This 
decision 
supports 
the 
proposition 
that  unrealised  exchange 
loss 
due 
to  currency"
"conversion  has no effect on the income and  profit of an  entity for income tax purposes."
"Nonetheless,  even  on 
the  question  of  capital  or  revenue 
transaction,  whether  loans  were"
"revenue  transactions  or accretions  to capita l is  one  of fact  [Beauchamp  (Inspector oj Taxes)  v."
"F.W. Woolworth pic (1988) Simon's Tax Cases  714]."
"In  this  context,  it  is  observed  that the Appellant  has  not charged  the  alleged  foreign  exchange"
"to  the  profit  and 
loss  account.  As 
the  TAC  correctly  pointed  out  this  shows  that  the 
loss"
"Appellant regarded  it as  a capital expenditure in  terms of section  26(1)(h) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act No. 10 of 2006 as  amended."
"For the foregoing reasons the answer to question no. 1 should  be  in the negative."
