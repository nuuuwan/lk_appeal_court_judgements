"to believe  in its existence,  unless it is provided by any  law that the proof  of that fact"

"T
hus, in my mind, there is no doubt that whether immediate possession must be taken"
"over on the ground of urgency is a fact which is known only to the Minister and other"
"Officials  of  the  relevant  Ministries  that  are 
involved 
in  the  said  acquisition,  and"
"therefore  the  burden  of  proving  urgency  is with  the  Respondents.  The  question  that"
"begs an answer is how an innocent landowner could assume the reasons that led to a"
"Minister to conclude that there was in fact urgency."
"I
n Fernandopulle36, the Supreme Court, referring to the burden of proof, held:"
"""
No doubt primarily the Minister decided urgency. He it is who is in possession"
"of the facts and his must be the reasoning. But the Courts have a duty to review"
"the matter. In this case the need for a playground and a farm had been mooted"
"as far back as 1974. Political influences and extraneous forces delayed the take"
"over of the land."
"F
our  years  dragged  on  and  school's  needs  were  still  waiting  to  be  met.  The"
"delay  and  the  need  decided  the  urgency.  These  being  the  facts  the  petitioner"
"has failed to satisfy me that there was no urgency. I would therefore dismiss the"
"application with costs."""
"T
o  my  mind,  the  above  conclusion  of  the  Supreme  Court 
is  clear.  That 
is,  the"
"acquisition  process,  having  commenced  in  December  1974,  and  the  inquiry  into  the"
"objections  having  been  concluded  in  February  1977,  where  the  necessity  had  been"
"decided,  was  sufficient  for  the  Supreme  Court  to  conclude  that,  “four  years  dragged"
"on and school's needs were still waiting to be met. The delay and the need decided the"
"urgency”. It is only because the Supreme Court was satisfied that there is urgency, that"
"it went onto hold that these being the facts the petitioner has failed to satisfy me that"
"there was no urgency. Thus, to my mind, the ratio in Fernandopulle is that the duty to"
"establish urgency lies with the Minister. Once that burden has been discharged by the"
"Minister,  and  only  then,  does  the  burden  shift  to  the 
landowner  to  rebut  that"
"inference. Therefore, I cannot agree with  the submission  of  the  learned  Senior State"
