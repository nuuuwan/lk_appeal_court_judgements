"section 2 and/or section 4.‚Äù"
"I
  wish  to  reiterate  the  fact  that  in  Fernandopulle,  the  Order  under  proviso  (a)  of"
"Section 38 was made after a Section 5(1) declaration was issued following a Section 4"
"inquiry.  The  above  passage  should  therefore  be  viewed  in  that  light.  It  reflects  the"
"position  where  an  Order  is  made  under  proviso  (a)  of  Section  38  after  affording  the"
"landowner  a  hearing  in  terms  of  Sections  4(4)  and  4(5)  where  the  objections  of  the"
"landowner had been considered. In such a situation, Fernandopulle only requires the"
"Minister to consider urgency when called upon to make an Order under proviso (a) of"
"Section 38. However, where an Order is made soon after a notice is made either under"
"Section 2(1) or Section 4(1), I am of the view that the Minister must consider urgency"
"in the light of necessity and suitability."
