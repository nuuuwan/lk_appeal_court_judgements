"Section  38  nowhere  refers  to  “public  purpose”.  It  only  refers  to  the  sections"
"where  the  need  for  such  purpose  has  been  decided.  The  only  decision  it  is"
"concerned  with  is  the  “urgency”  which  necessitates  ""immediate  possession”  of"
"the land being taken. The Minister’s sole power under that section is to decide"
"the question of urgency to meet the need for which an order was made under"
"section 2 and/or section 4.”"
