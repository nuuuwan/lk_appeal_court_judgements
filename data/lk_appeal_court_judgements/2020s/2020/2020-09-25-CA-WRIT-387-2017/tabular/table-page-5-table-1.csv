"Section 4(4) specifies further that, ‘when such objections are considered every objector"
"shall  be  given  an  opportunity  of  being  heard  in  support  thereof.’  It  is  only  after  the"
"consideration of the objections that the Secretary shall make his recommendations to"
"the Minister, which shall be considered by the appropriate Minister, and who is then"
"required to make his own recommendations to the Minister in charge of the subject of"
"lands. In terms of Section 4(5) of the Act, the Minister in charge of the subject of lands"
"(the Minister of Lands / the Minister) shall consider the said recommendations of the"
"Minister  at  whose  request  the  acquisition  had  been  initiated,  and,  who  shall  then"
"decide whether the land should or should not be acquired under the Act."
