"to  the  question  to  be  decided  and  very 
importantly  had  applied  his  mind  to  the"
"documents  and  material  presented  to  him,  would  have  arrived  at.  Therefore,  I  do  not"
"see  any  merit  in  the  arguments  presented  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners"
"based on the three letters."
"P
rovisions of the CEB Act"
"T
his  brings  me  to  the  second  part  of  my  judgment.  It  is  unfortunate  that  neither  the"
"Petitioners nor the CEB referred the Arbitrator to the provisions of the Ceylon Electricity"
"Board  Act,  which  contained  provisions  relating  to  employees  of 
the  Department."
"Therefore,  I  shall  now  consider  the  crucial  question  whether  the  Petitioners  became"
"employees  of  the  CEB  by  virtue  of  their  employment  with  the  Department,  and/or"
"whether their employment with the CEB is in effect a continuation of their employment"
"that commenced with the Department on 1st November 1969, or 1st November 1968, as"
"is the case with the 13th – 15th Petitioners."
"T
he Ceylon Electricity Board has been established in terms of Section 2(1) of the Ceylon"
"Electricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969 (the CEB Act). The assent of the Governor General"
"for the said Act has been given on 6th June 1969. Section 18 of the Act provides that, ‘As"
"soon as may be convenient after the coming into operation of this Act, the Minister shall,"
"by Order, transfer the Government Electrical Undertakings to the Board.’"
"T
he Act was amended for the first time by the Ceylon Electricity Board (Amendment) Act"
"No. 31 of 1969 (the Amendment Act), for which the assent of the Governor General has"
"been given on 4th November 1969. There is no dispute between the parties that the CEB"
"came into being on 1st November 1969."
"S
ection  31A(1)  was  introduced  by  the  Amendment  Act,  and  the  relevant  parts  of  the"
"said Section are re-produced below:"
"“Every public officer of the Department, not being any such officer in a transferable"
"service  of  the  Government,  shall,  before  the  date  on  which  the  Government"
"Electrical  Undertakings  are  transferred  to  the  Board  under  Section  18  (in  this  Act"
"19"
