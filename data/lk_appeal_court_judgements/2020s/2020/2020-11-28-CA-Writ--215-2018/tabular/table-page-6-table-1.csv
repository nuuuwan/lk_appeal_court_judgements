"In  Brown  &  Company  v.  Minister  of  Labour,4  Justice  Saleem  Marsoof,  P.C.,  having"
"analysed the wide powers and duties conferred on an arbitrator, held as follows:"
"“Arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Act is intended to be  even more liberal,"
"informal and flexible than commercial arbitration, primarily because the Arbitrator"
"is empowered to make an award which is ""just and equitable"". When an industrial"
"dispute  has  been  referred  under  Section  3  (1)(d)  or  Section  4(1)  of  the  Industrial"
"Disputes Act to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, Section 17(1) of the said"
"Act requires such Arbitrator to ""make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may"
"consider  necessary,  hear  such  evidence  as  may  be  tendered  by  the  parties  to  the"
"dispute,  and 
thereafter  make 
such  award  as  may  appear 
to  him 
just  and"
"equitable"".  In  my  view,  the  word  ""make""  as  used  in  the  said  provision,  has  the"
"effect of throwing the ball into the Arbitrator's court, so to speak, and requires him"
"to  initiate  what  inquiries  he  considers  are  necessary.  The  Arbitrator  is  not  simply"
"called upon ""to hold an inquiry"", where the ball would be in the court of the parties"
"to the dispute and, it would be left to them to tender what evidence they consider"
"necessary requiring the arbitrator to be just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the"
"control and progress of which will be in the hands of the parties themselves or their"
"Counsel.  What  the 
Industrial  Disputes  Act  has  done  appears  to  me  to  be  to"
"substitute in place of the rigid procedures of the law envisaged by the ""adversarial"
"system"", a new and more flexible procedure, which is in keeping with the fashion in"
"which  equity  in  English  law  gave  relief  to  the  litigants  from  the  rigidity  of  the"
"common law. The function of the arbitral power in relation to industrial disputes is"
"to  ascertain  and  declare  what  in  the  opinion  of  the  Arbitrator  ought  to  be  the"
"respective  rights  and 
liabilities  of  the  parties  as  they  exist  at  the  moment  the"
"proceedings are instituted. His role is more inquisitorial, and he has a duty to go in"
"search  for  the  evidence,  and  he  is  not  strictly  required  to  follow  the  provisions  of"
"the  Evidence  Ordinance  in  doing  so.  Just  as  much  as  the  procedure  before  the"
"arbitrator  is  not  governed  by  the  rigid  provisions  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  the"
"procedure followed by him need not be fettered by the rigidity of the law.”"
