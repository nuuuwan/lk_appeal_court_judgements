"In 
On 
the 
issue  of  liability, 
the  Appellant's  contention 
fully 
rests 
the"
"argument  that  he  was  only  a  ""paid  working  director"".  The  capacity  in  which  a"
"is  essentially  an 
director  functions  and  his  services  are  utilized  by  a  company"
"internal  arrangement  which  could  vary 
from  one  body  corporate 
to  another."
"Therefore, what is  important is  to  find  out whether such  person  is  responsible as  a"
"defaulting employer in  terms of Section 38(2) of the EPF Act.  As observed earlier,"
"the  fact  that the  Appellant was  a director of the  company  at  the  relevant period  of"
"default  has  been  firmly  established  and  at  no  stage  of this  case  did  the  Appellant"
"take  up  the position  that he  was  only  a paid working director and  therefore did  not"
"come within  the  first  limb  of the  definition  of ""employer""  in  terms  of Section 47"
"of the  EPF  Act.  Accordingly, 
the  said  argument  has  no  merit  and  should  be"
"rejected."
