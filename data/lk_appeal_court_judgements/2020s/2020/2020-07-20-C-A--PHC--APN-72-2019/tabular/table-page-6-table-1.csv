"Since  the indictment in case No.  29/16 alleged that he committed murder,"
"an offence punishable under Section 296  of the Penal Code,  the applicable"
"law in relation to bail is found in Bail Act No. 30 Of 1997."
"The impugned order dated 16.01.2018 was made by the High Court,"
"when the Petitioner was  represented  by his Counsel, having noted  that it"
"could not proceed to commence the trial since the Petitioner was rearrested"
"and remanded on an allegation of committing another offence.  Thereupon,"
"it  proceeded 
to 
cancel  his  bail  on  the  basis  that  the  Petitioner  would"
"reoffend and also would pose high flight risk."
"The  Petitioner  claims  that  there  was  no  evidence  before  the  High"
"Court  of  him  posing  a  flight  risk.  But  the  proceedings  of  HC  29/16  on"
"indicate 
that  he  was 
arrested  on 
a  warrant  due 
to 
his 
11.01.2018"
"unexplained absence in Court and his sureties have withdrawn from  their"
"suretyships. Learned High Court Judge who presided over on 11.01.2018 is"
"the  same Judge  who  made  the  1st  impugned  order  on 16.01.2018  after  a"
"lapse of mere 5 days since his previous order. Clearly the Petitioner's claim"
"there was no evidence as to the flight risk, is clearly a statement which did"
"not reflect the actual position."
"The  2nd  impugned  order dated  08.05.2019  is  an  order  by  which  the"
"High Court had refused  the Petitioner's application to enlarge him on bail"
"applying  similar  considerations  as 
it  did  on  11.01.2018.  This  particular"
"order  is  a  common  order  made  in  relation  to 
three  bail  applications  in"
"reference 
to 
the 
three  High  Court  Case  Nos.  29/2016,  109/2014  and"
"110/2014. The Court considered  that case  No.  29/2016,  the Petitioner was"
"accused  of committing murder,  while  case  No.  110/14 was  in  relation  to"
"6"
