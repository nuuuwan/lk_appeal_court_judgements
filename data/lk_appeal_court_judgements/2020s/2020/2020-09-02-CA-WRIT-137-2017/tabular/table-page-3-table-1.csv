"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The  Petitioner  is  an  Attorney-at-Law  and  a  Notary  Public.    The"
"1st  Respondent,  the  Commissioner  of  Revenue  of  the  Western"
"Province, 
found  systematic  stamp  duty 
forgeries  on  a 
large"
"number  of  Deeds  executed  by 
the  Petitioner. 
  The  modus"
"operandi  had  been  affixing  forged  stamp  duty  payment  receipts"
"on  the  Deeds,  thereby  defrauding  the  Registrar  of  Lands,  the"
"Commissioner of Revenue and Government revenue."
"The  Petitioner’s  position 
is 
these 
forgeries  were  committed"
"unknown to him by his clerk who pleaded guilty to forgery when"
"proceedings  were 
instituted  against  him 
(the  clerk) 
in 
the"
"Magistrate’s Court.  The Petitioner further says this clerk, who is"
"a  freelance  clerk,  similarly  deceived  two  other  Attorneys-at-Law"
"who had obtained the services of the clerk in the course of their"
"notarial practice."
"The  1st  Respondent  by  letter  marked  P3(a)  dated  17.11.2015"
"informed the Petitioner that the stamp duty payable on Deed No."
"1966  executed  by  the  Petitioner  had  not  been  credited  to  the"
"Commissioner’s account, and requested the Petitioner to pay the"
"stamp  duty  of  Rs.  279,000  with  a  300%  penalty  thereon  in  a"
"sum of Rs. 837,000, amounting to a total sum of Rs.1,116,000."
"The payment was requested within seven days."
"The Petitioner immediately paid the stamp duty but did not pay"
"the penalty."
