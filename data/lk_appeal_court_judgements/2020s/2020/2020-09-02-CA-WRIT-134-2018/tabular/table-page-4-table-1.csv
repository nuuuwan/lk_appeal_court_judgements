roceeded  to  immediately  serve  letters  of  termination  on  the"
"employees  who  engaged  in  the  strike  action  (amounting  to  275"
"employees in total, according to the 3rd Respondent).  One such"
"letter of termination dated March 20, 2006 is marked A7."
"The  Minister

the  said"
"terminations  of  employment  were  justified,  and,  if  not,  what"
"reliefs  should  be  granted  to  the  employees  –  to  the  Industrial"

"marked P2 directed the Petitioner employers to reinstate the said"
"employees with back wages."
"It is against this Order the Petitioners have filed this application"
"seeking to quash it by certiorari."
"The  Petitioners  challenge  P2  on  several  grounds.    Let  me  now"
"consider them one by one."
"The first ground is the reference of the Minister is bad in law, in"

the  Gazette  marked  X8  as 
the"
"employees  whose  services  were  terminated  are  not  accurate."
"The  Petitioners  say  some  employees  entered  into  settlements,"
"some are unidentifiable, and some do not have any dispute with"
"the Petitioners."
