President’s  Counsel  made

application 
to 
the"
"Industrial Court to adjourn the inquiry on that day and proceed"
"with  the  further  inquiry  in  the  presence  of  all  three  members"
"from  that  point  onwards.6    This  application  was  allowed  by  the"
"Industrial Court.7  Thereafter, Petitioners’ Counsel moved to file"
"affidavit  evidence 
in 
lieu  of  oral  evidence,  which  was  also"
"allowed.8 
  All

Industrial  Court  were"
