"T
he Petitioners say no employee whose services were terminated"
"as  a 
result  of 
the  strike  action  gave  evidence  before 
the"
"Industrial Court.  However, the Secretary of the 3rd Respondent"
"Trade Union gave evidence on behalf of the said employees.  It is"
"this  Secretary  who  negotiated  and  communicated  on  behalf  of"
"the  employees  with  the  Petitioner  employers  and  therefore  was"
"in  a  better  position  to  give  evidence  on  the  legitimacy  of  the"
"Trade  Union  action. 
 
It  must  be  borne 
in  mind 
that 
the"
"termination  of  services  of 
the  employees  was  due 
to 
them"
"engaging  in  the  strike  action  and  not  any  other  disciplinary"
"ground, 
and 
therefore 
calling 
each 
and 
every 
individual"
"employee to give evidence was not necessary."
"The Petitioners say the Industrial Court failed to give due weight"
"to 
the  document  marked  X5,  which 
is 
in 
favour  of 
the"
"Petitioners. 
  But  X5  has  been  denied  or  not  accepted  as  a"
"genuine document by the 3rd Respondent at the inquiry.3"
"The  Petitioners 
further 
say  although 
the 
Industrial  Court"
"comments in P2 that the documents marked X16-X23 have not"
"been tendered with the written submissions, the said documents"
"are available in the Brief.  On this basis, the Petitioners say the"
"Industrial  Court  did  not  consider  all  the  evidence  when  coming"
"to  the  impugned  decision.    Voluminous  documentary  evidence"
"was tendered at the inquiry.  However, the Petitioners do not say"
"how  or  why  consideration  of  the  documents  marked  X16-X23"
"would have changed the decision of the Industrial Court.  Unless"
"the  same  is  shown  to  the  satisfaction  of  this  Court,  this  Court"
