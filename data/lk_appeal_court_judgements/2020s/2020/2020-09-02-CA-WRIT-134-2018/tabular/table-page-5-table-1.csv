"I
n 
fact,  this  matter  was  raised  before  the 
Industrial  Court1"
"together  with  another  objection  (i.e.  that  a  composite  reference"
"to the Industrial Court against six companies is illegal) and the"
"Industrial  Court  by 
the  Order  marked  X14  overruled  both"
"objections.2  The Petitioners came before this Court against X14"
"and  this  Court  by  Judgment  dated  May  18,  2010  affirmed  the"
"said  Order  of  the  Industrial  Court.    Hence  the  Petitioners  are"
"debarred from reagitating the same matter again."
"Be that as it may, the Petitioners should know which employees’"
"services  were  terminated  as  a  result  of  the  Trade  Union  action,"
"which employees entered into settlements, and which employees"
"cannot  be  identified, and  separate  those employees  from others"
"whose  grievances  have  not  yet  been  addressed. 
  As 
learned"
"Counsel  for  the  3rd  Respondent  says  in his  written  submission,"
"“if  there  are  such  names  those  names  can  be  separated  and"
"removed. It does not render the Award illegal.”"
"I reject the first ground."
"The  second  ground  is  the  alleged  failure  on  the  part  of  the"
"Industrial Court to consider the evidence placed before it."
"The  Petitioners  say  the  Industrial  Court  analysed  the  evidence"
"put forward by the 3rd Respondent in detail but did not do so in"
"respect  of 
the  evidence  of 
the  Petitioners. 
  This 
is  not  a"
"reasonable accusation."
