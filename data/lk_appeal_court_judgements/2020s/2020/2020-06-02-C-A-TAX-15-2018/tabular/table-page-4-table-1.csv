"The  time  bar in  section  163(5)  (a)  of the  IRA  is  procedural.  In  A.G.  v.  Vernazza  [(1960)  3 AII.E.R."
"97  at  100]  it was  held  that if the new Act  effects  matter of procedure  only,  then  prima  facie, it"
"applies  to  all  actions,  pending  as  well  as  future.  This was  reiterated  in  Blyth  v.  Blyth  [(1966)  1"
"AII.E.R.  524  at 535]  where  Lord  Denning held that the  rule that an  Act of Parliament is not to be"
"given  retrospective effect does not apply to statutes which only alters the form of procedure."
"v.  The  Commissioner  General  oj  Inland  Revenue 
issue  arose 
in  Seylan  Bank  PLC. 
A  similar"
"[CA(Ta x) 23/2013,  C.A.M.  23.05.2015].  In  that case  thi s Court  held that irrespective  of whether"
"the  assessee  had  to  submit the tax  return  on  or before the  30th  September or 30th  November"
"2009, 
the  assessor  can  send 
the  asse ssment  to  the  assessee  within  two  years 
immediately"
"succeeding  that  year  of assessment.  The  Court  further  con sidered  the  amendments  made  to"
"section 163 of the Act by Act  Nos.  22  of 2011,  18 of 2013 and  8 of 2014. The  Court also  held that"
"section  163(5) of the IRA  is  a procedural  law and  that even  if the amendment has retrospect ive"
"effect, it applies."
"Accordingly,  I hold that the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010 dated 30.11.2012"
"issued  against the Appellant is  not time barred in term s of section 163(5) (a)  of the IRA."
"Question 2"
"The  main  issue  here  is  whether  NBT  paid  at  the  point  of importation  falls  under  ""prescribed"
"levy"" for the purpose of section  26(1)(I)(iii) of the IRA."
"Section  25  of the  IRA  states  that there  shall  be  deducted  for the  purpose  of ascertaining  the"
"profits and  income of any person  from  any source,  all  outgoings and  expenses  incurred  by such"
"person  in  the production thereof. Section  26  of the IRA provides for certain specific items which"
"are  not prohibited deductions."
"NBT is  not specifically  identified  in  section  26  of the  IRA  as  a non-deductible.  In  the absence  of"
"any  other provision,  the  Appellant  is  then  entitled  to  deduct  the  NBT  paid  by  it at  the time  of"
"importation. However, section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IRAstates that for the purposes  of ascertaining"
"the  profits  or income of any  person  from  any  sources  no  deduction  shall  be  allowed  in  respect"
"of ""any prescribed ta x or levy""."
"The  prohibition in  section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IRA in  effect acts  as  an  exemption  when  a person  is"
"not  caught  up  within  it  as  then  the  person  can  deduct  all  the  expenses  and  outgoings  of his"
