"The  original  position  was  that  no  assessment  can  be  made  after the  expiry of 18  months from"
"the  end  of the  year  of assessment.  This  was  amended  in  2009  by  Act  No.  19  of 2009  by which"
"no  assessment  can  be  made  after 
the  expiry  of  two  years 
from 
th e  end  of  the  year  of"
"assessment."
"This  was  the  legal  position  when  the  Appellant  filed  its  return  on  29.11.2010.  If there  was  no"
"change in  the legal  regime no assessment could  have been  made after 31.03.2012  provided the"
"tax  return  was  filed  on  time which  was  done.  However, the assessment  in  thi s case  was  made"
"on  30.11.2012."
"The  Appellant  submits that the  assess ment  is  time  barred  as  it had  a vested  right  to  have  got"
"the  assessment  made on  or before  31.03.2012.  However, the Respondent  submits that in  view"
"of the amendment made to section  163(5) (a)  of the IRA  by Act  No.  41  of 2011,  the assessment"
"in this case  was validly made."
"A  vested 
right 
is  a  certain  or  assured 
right  contrasted  with  a  contingent 
right  which 
is"
"conditional  on  the  happening of an  event. When  the word  'vested'  is used  in  thi s sense,  Austin"
"(Jurisprudence  vol.  2, 
lect.  53)  points  out  that 
in 
reality  a  right  of  one  class 
is  not  being"
"distinguished from  a right of another class but that a right is  being  di stinguished  from  a chance"
"or possibility of a right, but it is convenient to use  the well-known  expressions vested  right  and"
"conditional or contingent right ."
"In  Mohammed Bhoy et 01.  v. Lebbe  Moricor (15  N. L.  R. 466)  it was  held  that the interests of a"
"fideicommissaries  cannot  be  sold 
in  execution  during  the  lifetime  of the  fiduciarie s as 
it  is  a"
"contingent  interest  within  the  meaning  of section  216  (k)  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code  where"
"such  an 
interest  was  created  by  will  and  contained  the  condition  that,  on 
the  death  of the"
"fiduciaries, 
the 
property 
should 
pass 
to 
the 
fideicommi ssa ries. 
The 
interest 
of 
the"
"fideicommissarie s,  in this case, was  ""expectant on  his surviving his father"" ."
"(29  N. 
L.  R.  373)  a  deed  of  gift  created  a  fideicommi ss um 
in  which 
the 
In  Silva 
v.  Silva"
"fideicommi ssa ry succeeded  to the property after the death  of the fiduciary.  It was  held  that the"
"former acquired  ""an  assured  and  certain  intere st"" which  was  liable to be  seized and  so ld  under"
"section  218 (k)  of the Civil  Procedure Code."
"When  the  amendment  was  made  in  2011,  the  time  period  for the  making  of assessment  had"
"not lapsed . This amendment extended the time for making of an  assessment to the thirtieth day"
"of November  of the  immediately  succeeding  year  of  assessment. 
In  the  light  of these  fact s I"
"reject the submission that the Appellant had  a vested  right to have got the assessment made on"
"or before 31.03.2012."
