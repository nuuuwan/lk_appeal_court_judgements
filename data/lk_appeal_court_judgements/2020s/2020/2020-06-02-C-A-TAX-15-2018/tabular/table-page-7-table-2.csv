In  Thor  Power  Tools  Company  v.  Commissioner  of Internal  Revenue"
"(1979)] the US Supreme Court stated:"
"""The 
primary  goal 
of 
financial 
accounting 
is 
to  provide 
useful 
information 
to"
"management, 
shareholders, 
creditors,  and 
others  properly 
interested ; 
the  major"
"is  to  protect  these  parties  from  being  misled.  The 
responsibility  of  the  accountant"
"primary  goal  of  the 
income 
tax  system, 
in  contrast, 
is 
the  equitable  collection  of"
"revenue;  the  major responsibility of the Internal Revenue Service  is to protect the public"
"its  goals  and 
respon sibilities, 
financial  accounting  has  as  its 
fisc.  Consistently  with"
"the  principle  of  conservati sm,  with 
its  corollary 
that 
' possible  errors 
in 
foundation"
"measurement [should] be  in the direction of understatement rather than ove rstatement"
