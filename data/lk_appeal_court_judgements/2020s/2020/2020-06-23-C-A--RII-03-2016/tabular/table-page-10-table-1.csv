"1121  In Sri Lanka,  the remedy of restitutio in integrum has  taken deep root"
"in  the  practice  and  procedure  of our  Courts  (Abeysekera 
v.  Haramanis"
"Appu). Cases in which application for  relief by way of restitution in  respect"
"of judgments  of original  courts  have  been  made  can  be  broadly  classified"
"under  two  heads: 
(a)  where  a judgment  has  been  obtained  by  fraud  or"
"where  there  has  been a discovery  of fresh  evidence;  (h)  where  a judgment"
"there  has  been  an  absence  of a  real 
has  been  entered  of consent  and"
"consent  such  as 
in  cases  of fraud,  fear,  excess  of authority  and  mistake"
