"However, 
the 
learned  coun se l  for  the  Appellant  contended 
that 
the  2011  amendment 
is"
"inapplicable  to  the  year  of assessment  2009/10  for  at  least  two  rea sons.  Firstly,  that  it  was"
"brought  into  effect  on  1""  April  2011  which  is  the  commencement  of the  year  of assessment"
"2011/12 and thus giving a clear indication that it wa s sought to be  made applicable from the year"
"of assessment  2011/2012  onwards.  Secondly,  it was  submitted  that  at the  time  the  Appellant"
"submitted  the  return  on  30th  November 2010 th is  was  not applicable  and  therefore  it will  not"
"apply."
"A  similar  issue  arose  some  time  ago  when  the  amendment  to  the  IRA  2006  in  2009  was  the"
"[CA(Ta x) 
subject  matter  in  Seylan  Bank  PLC.  v.  The  Commissioner  General  oj Inland  Revenue"
"23/2013,  C.A.M.  23.05.2015). 
In 
that  case 
this  Court  held  that  irrespective  of  whether  the"
"Assessee  had  to submit the ta x return  on or before the 30th  September or 30th  November 2009,"
"the Assessor can  send the assessment to the Assessee  within two years immediately succeeding"
"that year of Assessment.  The  Court further considered the amendments made to section 163 of"
"IRA 2006 by Act Nos.  22 of 2011, 18 of 2013 and 8 of 2014.  It held that the two-yea r period given"
"to the  Assessor  to send  the  assessment  against  the Assessee  was  to start from  the end  of the"
"year of assessment  originally, which  is  the 31""  of March, every year.  This  date  (the starting day"
"ofthe period) has been further pushed down to the thirtieth day of November of the immediately"
"succeeding year of assessment by Act No. 22  of 2011. The  Court also held that section  163(5) of"
"IRA 2006 is  a procedural law and that even  if the amendment has retrospective effect, it applies,"
"if the amendment is only on  procedural law."
"Two judges sitting together as  a ru le follow the decision of two judges. Where two judges sitting"
"together find themselves unable to follow a decision  of two judges, the practice in  such  cases  is"
"(UK)  Ltd.  v. 
[Walker  Sons  &  Co. 
also  to  reserve  the  case 
for  the  decision  of  a  fuller  bench"
"Gunatilake  and  others  (1978-79-80)  1  Sri.  L.R .  231).  In  any  event,  I  am  of the  view  that  the"
"reasoning  in  Seylan  Bank PLC.  v.  The  Commissioner General oj Inland Revenue  (supra)  is sound"
"and  compelling and  sets out the correct position of the law."
