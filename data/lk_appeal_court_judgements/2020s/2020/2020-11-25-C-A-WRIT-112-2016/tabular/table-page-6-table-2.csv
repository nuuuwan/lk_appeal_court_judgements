"had clearly forfeited the confidence reposed  on  him as an  employee of the Bank and therefore, the"
"termination  was justified.  The  Court cited  with  approval the following quotation of Siva  Selliah  J."
"in the case of Sithamparanathan v.  Peoples Bank 1986 -1 SLR  411; where His Lordship held;"
"""It 
is  needless 
to  emphasize 
that 
the  utmost  confidence 
is  expected  of  any  officer"
"employed  in  a  Bank 
...  he  owes  a  duty  both  to  the  Bank  to  preserve  its  fair  name  and"
"integrity  and  to  the  c'ustomer  whose  money  lies  in  deposit  with  the  Bank. 
Integrity  and"
"confidence  thus  are  indispensable  and  where  an  officer has  forfeited  such  confidence  has"
"been shown  up as  being involved in  any fraudulent or questionable transaction, both public"
"interest of the bank demand that he should be removed from such  confidence""."
