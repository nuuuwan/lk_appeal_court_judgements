"Scheme. The disqualification that has given rise to this application is found at"
"Paragraph 01.02(v) and reads as follows:"
"“hus ks,Odrsfhl=g jsreoaOj jskh l%shdudra.hla wdrusN lr oekg tu l%shdudra.h"
"wjika lr fkdue;s ks,Odrska”2"
"T
he  word,  ‘l%shdudra.h’  means  ‘procedure’,  and  therefore,  the  requirement  in"
"‘P8a’ is that a person against whom disciplinary procedures have commenced"
"is  not  eligible  to  be  issued  a  permit  under  the  Scheme.3  The  question  that"
"needs 
to  be  determined 
in 
this  application 
therefore 
is  whether  any"
"disciplinary  procedures  had  commenced  against  the  Petitioner  at  the  time"
"‘P15’ was issued to the Petitioner."
"T
he 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner 
is  equating  the  commencement  of"
"disciplinary procedure against the Petitioner to the issuance of a charge sheet"
"followed by the commencement of a ‘formal disciplinary inquiry’.  There is no"
"dispute that a charge sheet had not been served on the Petitioner at the time"
"the 
letter 
‘P15’  was 
issued  on  the  Petitioner,  and  even  at  the  time  this"
"application  was  filed.  The  primary  argument  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner  therefore was  that  his  application  for  the  vehicle  permit  could  not"
"have been refused as no formal disciplinary inquiry had been initiated against"
"him at the time ‘P15’ was issued."
"T
he position of the Respondents however is that at the time ‘P15’ was issued"
"to 
the  Petitioner,  a  preliminary 
investigation  had  been  held  against 
the"
"Petitioner and a decision had been taken to initiate disciplinary action against"
"the Petitioner, and that such a decision would satisfy the requirements set out"
"in ‘P8a’. The learned Senior State Counsel has also submitted that ‘P8a’ does"
"2 ‘P8a’ has been issued only in Sinhala and Tamil."
