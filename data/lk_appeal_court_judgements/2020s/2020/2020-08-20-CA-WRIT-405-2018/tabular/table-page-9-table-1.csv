"Deputy Solicitor General, and is of the view that this application is liable to be dismissed"
"on this ground alone."
"T
he  second  objection  relates  to  the  standing  of  the  Petitioners  to  bring  this  action."
"While  the  1st  and  3rd  Petitioners  are  serving  as  Senior  Lecturers  (Grade  I)  at  the  1st"
"Respondent  University, 
the  2nd  and  4th  Respondents  are  Professors  at 
the  1st"
"Respondent  University.  However,  none  of 
the  Petitioners 
are 
attached 
to 
the"
"Department of History or to the Faculty of Social Sciences of the 1st Respondent, which"
"is  the  Department  and  Faculty,  respectively,  to  which  the  27th  Respondent  has  been"
"appointed.  The  Respondents 
allege 
that 
the  Petitioners  have  not 
invoked 
the"
"jurisdiction  of  this  Court  in  the  public  interest,  nor  have  the  Petitioners  demonstrated"
"the manner in which their rights have been affected by the said appointment. It is in this"
"background  that  the  Respondents  have  submitted  that  the  Petitioners  are  a  group  of"
"busybodies  who  have  initiated  this  application  out  of  malice,  and  to  support  the  24th"
"Respondent,  who  was  a  member  of  the 
Interview  Panel.  While  there  has  been  a"
"significant relaxation of the rules relating to standing over the years, and the Courts are"
"inclined to look at irregularities said to have been committed by public authorities, it is"
"important  that  a  petitioner  demonstrate  the  manner  in  which  his  or  her  rights  have"
"been  affected  by  the  impugned  decision.  It  is  equally  important  that  a  litigant  comes"
"before this Court with clean hands and not to achieve a collateral purpose. Be that as it"
"may, the necessity for this Court to consider the second preliminary objection does not"
"arise in view of the conclusion reached on the first objection."
"F
or the reasons set out in this Order, this Court is of the view that this is not a fit case in"
"which  notices  should  be  issued  on  the  Respondents.  This  application 
is  accordingly"
"dismissed, without costs."
