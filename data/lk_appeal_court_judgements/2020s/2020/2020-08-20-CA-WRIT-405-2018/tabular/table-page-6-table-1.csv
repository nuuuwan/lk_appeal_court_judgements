"(a) 
The appointment of the 27th Respondent was carried out pursuant to a settlement"
"arrived in the said fundamental rights application, and therefore the Petitioners in"
"this application cannot re-agitate the same matter in this application;"
"(
b) 
The Petitioners lack standing to have and maintain this application."
"T
his Court shall now deal with the first preliminary objection."
"A
lthough  the  facts  of  this  application  do  not  come  within  the  strict  definition  of  the"
"doctrine of res judicata, the principles on which the said doctrine is based upon would"
"still be applicable. As pointed out by Spencer, Bower and Turner in The Doctrine of Res"
"Judicata2 the doctrine of res judicata is based on two principles. The first is the general"
"interest  of  the  community 
in  the  termination  of  disputes,  and 
in  the  finality  and"
"conclusiveness  of 
judicial  decisions.  This 
is  a  matter  of  public  policy3and 
involves"
"considerations  such  as  the  avoidance  of  duplicative  litigation,  potentially  inconsistent"
"results  and  inconclusive  proceedings.  The  second  is  the  right  of  the  individual  to  be"
"protected from vexatious multiplication of suits and prosecutions at the instance of an"
"opponent  whose  superior  wealth,  resources  and  power  may  weigh  down 
judicially"
"declared right and innocence. This is a matter of private justice.4"
"T
he  following  passage  from  Law  of  Estoppel  and  Res  Judicata  by  M.  Monir  and"
"A.C.Moitra5 confirms the underlying reasons for this doctrine:"
"“The principle of res judicata is founded on consideration of public policy. It is in the"
"interest  of  public  at  large  that  a  finality  should  attach  to  the  binding  decisions"
"pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction; and it is also in the public interest"
"that individuals should not be vexed twice for the same kind of litigation.”"
