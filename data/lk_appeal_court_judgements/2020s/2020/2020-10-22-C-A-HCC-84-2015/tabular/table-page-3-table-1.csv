"At  the hearing of the appeal preferred  by the 3 rd  Accused- Appellant,"
"learned  counsel  submitted  that  the  sole  eyewitness's  evidence  does  not"
"support the conviction  for  murder since, according to the said witness,  the"
"three  Accused  have  only  used  ""thin  poles"" 
to  assault  the  deceased  who"
"was standing when  the witness  rushed to  the scene upon hearing a  noise."
"The deceased had thereafter collapsed on the ground."
"The 
three  Accused  have 
left 
the  scene  carrying 
their  poles  with"
"them.  There  is no evidence led  by the  prosecution as to  the circumstances"
"under which  the admission of the deceased  to  the  hospital was  made.  He"
"died  soon after.  The  first  information  was  provided  by  the  hospital  staff to"
"the police station."
"Learned Counsel for  the Accused- Appellant also  drew our attention"
"to the  medical evidence which  indicate  that the deceased had suffered  two"
"stab 
injuries  along  with  one  cut 
injury,  and  submitted 
that 
the  sole"
"eyewitness's  account  does  not  explain 
in  any  way  of  infliction  of  these"
"injuries,  which  had  in  fact  resulted  in  death  of the  deceased.  Therefore,"
"she  submits  that  the  conviction  based  on 
the  said  witness  cannot  be"
"maintained owing to unreliability of the evidence ."
"The  learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General  in  his  reply  submitted"
"that the  three Accused  have  beaten up the deceased severely.  However,  he"
"concedes that there is no evidence as to  who had inflicted the stab injuries"
"on the deceased which had resulted in his death."
