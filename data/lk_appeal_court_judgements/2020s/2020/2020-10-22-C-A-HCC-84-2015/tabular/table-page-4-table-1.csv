"In these circumstances,  this Court is of the view  that in the absence"
"of evidence  as  to  who  carried  the  weapon  by which  the  said  stab  injuries"
"were  inflicted  on  the  deceased  and  in  the  absence  of evidence  as  to  who"
"was  responsible  for 
the  stab  injuries, 
the  three  Accused  could  only  be"
"convicted  for  culpable  homicide  not amounting to  murder on  the  basis  of"
"knowledge,  since their complicity is restricted to assault with ""thin poles""."
"The  conviction  against  the  3 rd  Accused- Appellant  was  entered  on"
"28.  07.  2015  and  since  then  he  was  in  remand  pending determination of"
"his appeal."
"The  clear  evidence  that  has  been  presented  before 
the  trial  Court"
"confines to beating of the deceased using sticks which the sole eye witness"
"described as very ""thin sticks""."
"Therefore, 
this  Court  set  aside 
the  conviction  for  murder  entered"
"against  all 
three  Accused  by 
the  High  Court  and  substitute  with  a"
"conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to murder."
"The each of the Accused  are  imposed a  imprisonment for  a  period of"
"sixty two  ( 62  ) months and that the said  term  of imprisonment in  relation"
"to 
the 
3 rd  Accused- Appellant, 
in  view  of  the  fact 
that  he  had  been"
"incarcerated  since  his  conviction,  should  run  from  the  date  of conviction,"
"namely 28.07.2015."
