"""20(g)  The  5th  Respondent  failed  to take  into  consideration  that the  1st  -
4th  Respondents  are"
"attempting to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of the Petitioner Company""."
"This  proposition  is  to be  viewed  in  the reverse  order. The  1st -
4th""  Respondents  are  employees"
"who  have  served  the  Petitioner Company for a long period of time and  for their services  rendered"
"are  statutorily  entitled  for  the  emoluments  and  payments.  The  Petitioner  Company  is  not  in  a"
"position to avoid  paying overtime benefits and  cost of living and  other payments prescribed by law."
"Hence any payment due by virtue of the law for the services rendered by the employees cannot be"
"denied  nor considered  as  an  additional  payment.  Therefore,  it is  the  Petitioner  Company that by"
"denying the due statutory payment to the  retiring employees under VRS  is  attempting to reap  the"
"benefits of retaining the sums  of money legally due to the Ist- 4th Respondents and  thus trying to"
"procure  an  undue  enrichment.  Accordingly,  the  5th  Respondent  has  taken  into  consideration  all"
"aspects of the dispute referred to him and  has made a just and  equitable award."
"Moreover, the A/3194 award was made on  2003.01.18 (P3) following the principles of natural justice"
"after hearing both  parties and  in  terms of law and  being fair and justifiable. Accordingly, the award"
"was  published in  Extraordinary Gazette No 1798/63, dated 2013.02.22.  (6R2)."
