"I
t  is  an  admitted  fact  that  the  1st  Respondent,  having  been  issued  a  letter  of"
"employment by the Petitioner, was an employee of the Petitioner. His assignment"
"was to work as a personal driver to the Chairman of the Petitioner. It is relevant"
"to note that the letter of appointment refers to the Chairman as opposed to Mr."
"SY, the Chairman. Once Mr. SY ceased to function as Chairman, it was the case of"
"the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent was required to report for duty at the head"
"office of the Petitioner, which is an admission on  the part of the Petitioner that"
"the 1st Respondent is the driver of the Chairman, whoever the Chairman may be."
"In  fact,  the  failure  to  report  for  work  after  Mr.  SY  ceased  to  be  the  Chairman,"
"formed the basis for the Petitioner treating the 1st Respondent as having vacated"
"his  post.  If  this  be  so,  the  1st  Respondent  cannot  be  categorized  as  a  personal"
"driver for the purposes of Section 33(3) of the Act, and therefore, the Arbitrator"
"has not erred by not considering the provisions of Section 33(3)."
