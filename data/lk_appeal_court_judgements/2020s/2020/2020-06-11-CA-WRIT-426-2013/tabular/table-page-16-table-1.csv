"employed by the Petitioner, has not been challenged during cross examination of"
"the 1st Respondent."
"I
t is the view of this Court that the above conduct of the 1st Respondent is not the"
"conduct of a person who had the intention to abandon his employment. Having"
"considered the evidence that was placed before the Arbitrator,  this Court is not"
"in  a  position  to  arrive  at  the  conclusion  that  the  failure  on  the  part  of  the  1st"
"Respondent  to  report  at  the  work  place,  was  actuated  by  an 
intention  to"
"voluntarily vacate his employment."
"T
he  second  event  that  negates  the  mental  element  that  is  required  in  order  to"
"satisfy  the  test  of  vacation  of  post 
is  the  fact  that  the  1st  Respondent  had"
"complained  to  the  Department  of  Labour  by  his  letter  dated  9th  October  2007"
"about not being allowed to report for work. The 1st Respondent would not have"
"complained  to  the  Department  of  Labour  if  he  did  not  have  any  intention  of"
"continuing with his employment at the Petitioner. By a letter dated 15th October"
"2007, the Department of Labour had informed the Petitioner to be present for an"
"inquiry  on  31st  October  2007.  Thus,  by  the  time  the  vacation  of  post  letter  was"
"served, the 1st Respondent had already lodged a complaint with the Department"
"of Labour. It therefore appears that the letter of 15th October 2007 was sent by"
"the Petitioner, possibly as a defence to the said complaint of the 1st Respondent."
"It is the view of this Court that in the above factual circumstances, the said letter"
"of vacation of post served by the Petitioner does not serve any purpose, bears no"
"value, and fails to negate the mental element that is required to establish that the"
"1st Respondent had vacated his post."
