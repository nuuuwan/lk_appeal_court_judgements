consideration  received  or  receivable  as  subsidy"

"Appeals  Commission  (TAC)  where  it annulled  the  assessment which  was  made  on  the  basis  of"
"the  subsidy  being  liable  to  VAT  but  made  a  determination  disallowing  the 
input  tax  credit"
"attributable to the relevant subsidy."
