Is  the  determination  made  by the Tax  Appeals  Commission  disallowing the claim  of the"
"Appellant  (which  has  already  been  allowed  by 
the  Commissioner  General  of  Inland"
"Revenue) for input tax credit erroneous in  law?"
"Question 1: Time Bar"
"The  learned  counsel  for the Appellant  submitted that in  terms of the TAC  Act,  the TAC  shou ld"
"have  determined 
the  appeal  within 
twenty-four  months  from 
the  date  on  which 
the  TAC"
"commenced  its sittings."
"It  was  submitted  that  the  appeal  was  first  heard  on  5th  July  2012  whereas  the  determination"
"was  made  only  on  30th  September  2014  and  as  such  the  determination  of the TAC  should  be"
"considered  as  a nullity. The  decision  of this Court in  A.H . Mohideen  v.  Commissioner General of"
"Inland Revenue  rCA  02/2007, CAM. 16.01.2014, (2015) Vol.  XXI  BAU  171] was cited  in support."
"The  learned counsel  for the Appellant relying on  the fact that the first hearing took place on  5th"
"in  determining  whether  the 
July  2012,  submitted  that  this  is  the  date  from  which  time  runs"
"determination of the TAC  is  time barred.  He  further submitted  that upon a consideration  of the"
"several  amendments  made 
to  the  TAC  Act, 
the 
time 
limit  granted 
to  the  TAC 
to  make  a"
"is  mandatory  which 
requires  strict  compl iance. 
It  was  submitted  that  in 
the 
determination"
"instant case  the  determination was  made after the 270 days  contemplated  by  section  10 of the"
"TAC Act and  hence it is time barred."
"In  addressing this  question, the fundamental  issue  to  be  determined  is  whether the time  limit"
"given  in  section  10 of the TAC  Act  is  directory or mandatory. The  question  whether a provision"
"in  a statute  is  mandatory or directory is  not capable  of generalization  but when  the legislature"
"has  not said  which  is  which,  one  of the  basic  tests  for  deciding whether a statutory direction  is"
"mandatory or directory is  to consider whether violation  thereof is  penal  or not. It has  been  the"
"traditional  view  that  where  disobedience  of a  provision  is  expressly  made  penal  it  has  to  be"
"concluded  that the provision  is  mandatory whereas  if no  penalty is  prescribed  non-compliance"
"with the provisions of a statute may held to be  directory."
