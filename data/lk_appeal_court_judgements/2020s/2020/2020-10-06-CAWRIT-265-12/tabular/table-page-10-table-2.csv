"39(1).  This  position  is  succinctly  set  out  in  the  following  paragraph  of  De  Silva  v"
"Atukorale:"
"“Of  course,  even in  such  a  case  it  would  be  legitimate  for  the  Minister  to"
"decline  to divest  if  there  is  some  good   reason  -   for  instance,  that  there  is"
"now  a  new  public purpose  for  which  the  land  is  required.  In  such a  case it"
"would  be  unreasonable  to  divest  the  land,  and  then  to proceed to acquire it"
"again for such  new supervening  public purpose. Such  a  public  purpose  must"
"be    a    real    and    present    purpose,    not    a  fancied  purpose  or  one  which  may"
"become a reality only in the distant future.”"
