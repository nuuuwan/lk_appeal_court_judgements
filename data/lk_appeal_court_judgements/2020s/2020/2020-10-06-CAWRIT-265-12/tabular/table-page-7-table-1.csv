n  terms  of  Section  39A(1)  of  the  Act,  “Notwithstanding  that  by  virtue  of  an  Order"

"for divestiture being made in terms of Section 39A(1), the condition precedent to an"
"Order under Section 39A(1) is that actual possession of such land should have been"
"taken for or on behalf of the State. It is not disputed that even though the State has"
"tried several times over the years to take possession of the said land, it has not been"
"successful due to stiff resistance from the Petitioners. In these circumstances, as the"
"Petitioners  are  still  in  possession  of  the  land,  the  necessity  for  me  to  consider  the"

"this application does not arise, in view of the fact that actual possession of the land"
"has not been taken over by the State."
"A
