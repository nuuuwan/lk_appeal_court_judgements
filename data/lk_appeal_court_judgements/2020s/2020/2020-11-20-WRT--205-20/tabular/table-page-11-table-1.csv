"The  Petitioners’  main  complaint  is  that  the  former  Manager  of"
"the  Bank  fraudulently  misused  the  funds  in  their  accounts  for"
"his  personal  gain  without 
their  knowledge  and,  upon 
the"
"Petitioners’  making  a  complaint  on  08.10.2018, 
the

"Manager  was  arrested  and  produced  before  the  Magistrate’s"
