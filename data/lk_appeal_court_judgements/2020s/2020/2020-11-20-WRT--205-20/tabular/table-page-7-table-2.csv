"Professor  Weeramantry,","in  his  celebrated  work  The  Law  of"
"Contracts, states at page 300 of Vol I:",""
"","A person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on"
"","the basis that he does so at his peril.  This is known as the"
"","caveat subscriptor rule, and in the operation of this rule the"
"","principles relating to Justus error come into play.  This rule"
"","must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption"
"","from the ordinary rules relating to mistake.  Where a person"
"","deliberately  affixes  his  signature  to  a  written  contract,  the"
"","court would naturally be more hesitant in permitting him to"
"","plead that he did so in consequence of a mistake as to the"
"","nature  or  substance  of  the  transaction,  and  to  this  extent"
"would be less prone to view the error as Justus.",""
"","In accordance with the rules of Justus error the court would"
"","not readily come  to  the  aid of  a person  who states  that he"
"","did  not  sufficiently  attend  to  the  terms  of  a  contract  or  did"
"","not  read  it  sufficiently  carefully,  or  altogether  neglected  to"
"","read  the  document  containing  the  contract.    Thus  where  a"
"person  who 
is  neither","illiterate  nor  blind  signs  a  deed"
"","without examining its contents, he would not, as a general"
"","rule,  be  permitted  in  Roman-Dutch  Law  to  set  up  the  plea"
"that 
the  document","is  not  his. 
 
If,  however,  without"
"","negligence,  a  person  executes  a  document  in  ignorance  of"
