"T
he Respondents say only two of the three licensees of the liquor"
"shop have filed this application.  According to the Respondents,"
"unless all three licensees are made parties, the application is not"
"maintainable. This is not necessary."
"Then, the Respondents say the 3rd Petitioner has no locus standi"
"to be a Petitioner to this application because he is not a licensee."
"This preliminary objection is counterproductive.  If this position"
"is  to  be  accepted,  it  can  be  equally  said  that  none  of  the  three"
"licensees  were  given  a  hearing  prior  to  the  impugned  decision"
"contained in P7 being taken. The 3rd Petitioner has locus standi"
"because  it  is  he  who  is  alleged  to  have  pleaded  guilty  to  the"
"charges.  The sum of Rs. 4,000,000 was ordered on this basis."
"Next, the Respondents say there is no proper application before"
"this  Court  because  the  supporting  affidavit  to  the  petition  has"
"been  filed  by  the  3rd  Petitioner  who  has  no  locus  standi  to  be  a"
"party  to  the  application.    As  I  have  already  explained,  the  3rd"
"Petitioner  has 
 
In  any  event, 
the  supporting 
locus  standi."
"affidavit to the petition need not necessarily be by a party to the"
"application.  Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules 1990 only"
"requires  an  affidavit  in  support  of  the  averments  set  out  in  the"
"petition."
"The 
preliminary 
objection 
on 
has 
“acquiescence/estoppel”"
"already been dealt with."
"The 
final  preliminary  objection 
is 
the  Petitioners  have  not"
"exhausted alternative remedies, in that, they have not appealed"
"“to the Minister in the manner provided by the rules under section"
"of 
the  Excise  Ordinance. 
This 
objection 
is 
also 
32(2)(c)”"
