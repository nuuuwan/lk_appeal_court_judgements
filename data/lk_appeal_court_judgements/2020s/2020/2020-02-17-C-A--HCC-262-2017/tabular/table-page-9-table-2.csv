"considered  the  dock  statement.  An  analysis  of the 
law  with  regard 
to  dock"
"statement  is  followed  by  an  analysis  of such  statement  to  the  case  before  the"
"learned High Court Judge."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  firstly  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  the"
"prosecution  had  proved 
the 
case 
beyond 
reasonable  doubt 
and 
secondly"
"evaluated the dock statement of the  Appellant (page 260 -261  of the Brief). The"
"intention  of such  analysis  was  to  find  out  whether  the  dock  statement  would"
"amount to create a doubt in the case of the prosecution."
"The  Appellant  in  his  dock  statement  had  not  mentioned  about  any  previous"
"enmity  between  him  and 
the  police  officers  which  would 
infer  that  he  was"
"falsely  implicated."
"The  dock statement was  rejected  on  the  basis  that  it  failed  to  create  a  doubt  in"
"the case of the  prosecution."
