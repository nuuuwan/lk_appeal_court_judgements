"o
n the recommendation of the Political Victimisation Committee."
"It  is  not  the  position  of  the  3rd  Respondent  that  although  the"
"dispute  is the same, the  Arbitrator  could  revisit the  matter  and"
"make  an  order.  Rather,  the  3rd  Respondent’s  contention  is  “the"
"application 
to 
the  Political  Victimisation  Committee  was  made"
"purely  due 
to 
the  3rd  Respondent  being  subject 
to  political"
"victimisation”  and  “the  application  made 
to 
the  Commissioner"
"General  of  Labour  and  later  referred  to  Arbitration  was  purely"
"based on Petitioner’s failure to implement relevant circulars”, and"
"therefore there is no conflict between the two grievances.  In the"
"facts and circumstances of this case, I am unable to agree."
"In fact, although the 3rd Respondent complained to the Political"
"Victimisation  Committee,  his  complaint  makes  no  mention  of"
"political  victimisation.    Rather,  the  said  complaint  pertains  to"
"grave 
injustice  caused  to  him  due  to  the 
inefficiency  of  the"
"management  of  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board,  which  compelled"
"him  to  stagnate  in  the  post  of  Internal  Audit  Assistant  (salary"
"scale K5) for twenty long years.  The said complaint refers to the"
"non-implementation  of 
the 
relevant  circulars  as  well. 
  The"
"argument of the 3rd Respondent that the complaint made to the"
"Arbitrator was different from the complaint made to the Political"
"Victimisation Committee is therefore unsustainable."
"Let me quote in full the complaint of the 3rd Respondent sent to"
"the Political Victimisation Committee for better understanding."
