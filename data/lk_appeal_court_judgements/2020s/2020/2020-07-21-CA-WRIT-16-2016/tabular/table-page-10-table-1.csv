the  same  service  as 
the  3rd  Respondent 
(i.e. 
the 
three"
"employees highlighted by the Arbitrator and the 3rd Respondent),"
"the  Political  Victimisation  Committee 
recommended 
they  be"
"promoted  upon  completion  of  six  years  of  service.    The  Political"
"Victimisation 
Committee 
did 
not 
make 
the 
same"
"recommendation  in  respect  of  the  3rd  Respondent,  perhaps  for"
"different reasons.  This Court is not mandated to look into that"
"matter."
"In  light  of  the  Cabinet  decision  already  made  in  respect  of  the"
"effective  date  of  promotion  of  the  3rd  Respondent,  the  Minister"
"could  not  have  referred 
the  matter 
for  arbitration  and 
the"
"Arbitrator could not have backdated the said promotion, thereby"
"overriding the Cabinet decision."
"The 3rd Respondent has taken up two preliminary objections."
"The 1st preliminary objection is the former Minister who referred"
"the  dispute  for  arbitration  has  not  been  cited  by  name  and"
"instead 
the  present  Minister  has  been  made  a  party,  and"
"therefore  the  application  of  the  Petitioner  shall  be  dismissed  in"
"limine.  The Minister was performing an official act; he cannot be"
"held  personally  liable  for  such  an  act  and  therefore  naming  his"
"successor 
is  sufficient  compliance 
in  terms  of  the  Court  of"
"Appeal  Rules. 
 
In  any  event, 
the  relief  sought 
is  certiorari"
"quashing 
the 
reference 
for 
arbitration 
by 
the  Minister;"
"mandamus is not sought."
"The  second  preliminary  objection  is  “Petition  of  Appeal  has  not"
"been  filed  by  the  Attorney-at-Law  on  record;  therefore  no  valid"
"Petition of Appeal is before Court.”  There is no Petition of Appeal"
