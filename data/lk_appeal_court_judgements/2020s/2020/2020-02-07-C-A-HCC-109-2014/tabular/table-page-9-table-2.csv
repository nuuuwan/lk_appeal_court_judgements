"Most  witnesses  for  the  prosecution,  being  independent  witnesses -have  not  made"
"contradictions 
interse  and 
the  circumstances  have  made  a  strong  case  beyond"
"reasonable doubt.  The Learned High Court Judge after observing and analysing all"
"the  witnesses  has  come 
to  a  conclusion 
that  prosecution  has  proved  the  case"
"beyond reasonable doubt and the defense has failed to create a reasonable doubt in"
"the prosecution."
"Considering above reasons,  I am  of the  view that the Learned High Court Judge  is"
"not  erred  in  law,  and  there  is  no  merit  in 
the  contentions  raised  by  the  Learned"
"counsel  for  the  appellant.  Accordingly  the  convictions  and  the  sentences  imposed"
"by the Learned High Court Judge is  affirmed and thereby the appeal is dismissed."
