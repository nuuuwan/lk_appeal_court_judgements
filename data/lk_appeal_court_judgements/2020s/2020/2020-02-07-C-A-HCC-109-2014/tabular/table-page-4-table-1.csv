testimony  of the  1st  witness.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  correctly"

that 
the  only 
fact  proven  before 
the  court  by 
the"

1st  witness  for  the  prosecution  is  that  ,the  witness  has  seen  the"
"deceased  in  a critical condition in a three wheeler facing Thambuttegama."
"It  has  been  submitted  that the  version  of the  Prosecution  Witness  No.2  that  he"
"identified  the  appellant  who  was  seated  at  the  back  of the  three-wheeler  and  he"
"specifically  noticed 
the  birthmark  on  his 
face 
is  not  probable  and  hence  his"
"testimony  also  did  not  implicate  the  appellant  in  the  incident  in  question.  The"
"appellant  who  was  arrested  by  the  police,  the  day  after the  incident early  morning"

"could  identifY  the  appellant  as  the  person  with  whom  the  deceased  was  last  seen"
"alive. The Learned High Court Judge has observed as follows."
