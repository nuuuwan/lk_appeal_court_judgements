"It was  also  the Petitioner's position that the said  letter had  been  prepared for his  personal use,"
"in  case  he wished to refer to his salary particulars at any given time. This item of evidence is very"
"relevant to his  motive and  subsequent conduct.  If the  letter was for his  personal use as  claimed"
"and  no copy had  been  retained  in  the Nuwara  Eliya  Office and  if as  admitted the accuracy of its"
"contents had  not been cross checked against the CClO  register which contained a written record"

"departure when  he  had  already been  in  receipt of his salary for September 2003,  also  supports"
"the  position  that this  document  was  deliberately prepared  with  the  intention  of committing  a"
"fraud. Again,  if this was  a document prepared for his own personal use as  claimed and  if none of"
"the usual  precautions had  been taken  in verifying its accuracy, the second  point is that it should"
"have  been  submitted  by  the  petitioner to the  Divisional  Secretariat  for the  preparation  of his"
"salary,  while serving  at the  Divisional  Secretariat,  Dambulla,  unless  steps were taken  to inform"
