"Therefore, the finding of the AAT cannot say to be against the weight of evidence or irrational or"
"unreasonable  having  regard  to  the  matters  adverted  to  above.  Furthermore,  the  decision  to"
"dismiss  the  Petitioner  is  proportionate  having  regard  to  the  profession  and  post  held  by  the"
