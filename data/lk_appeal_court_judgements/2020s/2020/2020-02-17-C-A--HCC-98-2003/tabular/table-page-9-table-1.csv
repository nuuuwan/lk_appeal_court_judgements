"Ground of Appeal No.4"
"18.  Learned  President's  counsel  brought  to  the  notice  of the  court  that  the  prosecution  failed  to"
"submit 
the 
sketch  of  the  house  drawn  by 
the  Police  Officer 
in  evidence.  Prosecution"
"witnesses  PWI,  PW2,  and  PW3  gave  clear evidence  about  the  house.  Those  evidence  were"
"not  challenged. 
If  there  were  any  questions  on 
the  plan  of the  house  favourable 
to 
the"
"defence,  counsel  could  have  posed  them  to  the  witnesses,  which  they  did  not.  The  Police"
"Officer  not  producing the  sketch  drawn  by  him  has  not  caused  any  prejudice to  the  defence."
"This ground has no  merit."
"Ground of Appeal No.5"
"19.  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  said  that  either  Baby  Nona  or  Anusha Nimali  should  have  had  the"
"ability to  identify the  Appellant.  As  I said  before,  the  evidence of Anusha Nimali  (PW1)  on"

"has  no  merit."
"Ground of Appeal No.6"
"20.  Baby Nona  in  her evidence  said that  the  Appellant was  not  in  good  terms  with her  husband"
"due  to  some  issues  in  the  Village  Development  Society.  However,  she  did  not  know  much"
"detail about it.  PWI  (Anusha Nimali) also said the same thing in evidence.  It is the contention"
"of  the  counsel 
for 
the  Appellant 
that 
the 
learned  Trial  Judge  has  not 
taken 
that 
into"
"consideration.  However, evidence of PW 1 was not challenged by the defence at the trial."
"21.  Merely because a witness  is  a close relative of the  deceased,  he  or she cannot be  regarded  as"
"an  interested  witness.  There  is  no  evidence to  suggest that  PW I  and  PW2  had  any animosity"
"with  the  Appellant,  other  than  the  fact  they  knew  that  the  deceased  had  an  issue  with  the"
