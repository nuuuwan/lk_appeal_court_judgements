"observe that the promotion of the Petitioner to the rank of Captain has been"
"recommended by the Initiating Officer as well as the Reviewing Officer."
"T
he primary argument of the learned  Counsel for the Petitioner was that the"
"automatic  application  of  the  above  Policy  in  ‘P13’  on  a  retrospective  basis  is"
"arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable, and that the Army Selection Board No. 3"
"must 
take 
into  consideration 
the  aforementioned 
recommendations  and"
"reports, in arriving at its decision."
"H
aving examined the decision of the Army Selection Board No. 3 conveyed by"
"‘P12’, it is clear that the decision to retire the Petitioner has been taken solely"
"in  view of  the  policy  decision  in  ‘P13’.  There has not been a  consideration of"
"the recommendations contained in ‘P7’, ‘P8a’ and ‘P8b’, nor have the Annual"
"Confidential  Reports  on  the  Petitioner  for  the  period  2013  –  2016  been"
"considered  by 
the  Army  Selection  Board  No.3.  This 
is  contrary 
to 
the"
"aforementioned provisions of Regulations 15(1) and (2) of the Volunteer Force"
"Regulations."
"W
hile the considerations applicable for the promotion of an Officer to the rank"
"of  Captain  would  be  different  to  the  criteria  applied  when  considering  the"
"promotion  of  a  Second  Lieutenant  to  the  rank  of  Lieutenant,  the  fact  of  the"
"matter is that the aforementioned AWOL incident occurred at a time when the"
"Petitioner  was  a  Second  Lieutenant  but  yet,  that  had  not  prevented  the"
"Petitioner from being promoted on two occasions after the AWOL incident."

n Colonel J.D.A Gunasekara vs Lt. Gen. N.U.M.M.W Senanayake, Commander"
"of  the  Sri  Lanka  Army  and  Others,7  this  Court  was  called  upon  to  consider  a"
"Circular  similar  to  ‘P13’,  which  was  applicable  to  those  holding  the  rank  of"
