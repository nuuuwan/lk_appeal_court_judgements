"on an automatic basis with retrospective effect, this Court had held as follows:",""
"“","This Court has examined ‘P16’ and observes that it does not contain the"
"","rationale  for  applying  on  a  retrospective  basis  a  Policy  of  automatically"
"","depriving  Officers  of  their  promotion  on  the  basis  that  they  have  been"
"","absent without leave. Nor has this Court been presented with any material"
"","or  explanation  in  the  Statement  of  Objections  as  to  the  rationale  behind"
"the  retrospective  application  of  such  policy  automatically.8  What","is  of"
"","significance  is  that  after  pleading  guilty  to  the  charge  of  being  absent"
"","without leave in August 1995, the Petitioner has been promoted on three"
"","occasions,  and  has  served  in  operational  areas  for  a  significant  period."
"","This  demonstrates  that  the  presence  of  the  Petitioner  who  has  been"
"","absent  without  leave  for  three  days  has  not  been  considered  as  being"
"","detrimental to the objects of the Sri Lanka Army. While there could have"
"","been a perfectly justified reason as to how such an incident can impact the"
"","Sri  Lanka Army when considering an Officer to  the  rank of Brigadier,  the"
"","fact of the matter is that no explanation has been offered in this regard."
"","Thus, while the fact that an Officer has been AWOL in the past can be one"
"","of  the  factors  that  could  be  considered  when  considering  an  Officer  for"
"","promotion,  it  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  automatic  application  of"
"such  a  policy  on  a 
retrospective  basis,  as 
contained 
in","‘P16’ 
is"
"unreasonable.”",""
