"In his statement from  the dock,  the 5th  Appellant stated in relation  to  the"
"incident that he heard that his name transpired as the person who set fire  to  the"
"houses and therefore he went there to investigate."

"going  on  had  not  been  put  to  any  of 
the  prosecution  witnesses  by  the  5th"
"Appellant and was advanced for the first time in his statement from the dock.  In"
"applying  probability  test, 
it  is  noted  that  his  conduct  of  visiting  the  burning"
"houses  as  admitted  by  the  5th  Appellant,  especially  when  he  is  accused  of  the"
"said crime, is highly an improbable act."
"The highlighted portion of the judgment is  in relation to  the said conduct"
"of the 5th  Appellant and the impression that the wording used by the trial Court"
"creates in the mind of the reader that it had compared the two versions side by"
"side  in  determining  to  reject  is  a  result  of  its  manner  of  presentation  and  not"
"necessarily due to such a comparison."
