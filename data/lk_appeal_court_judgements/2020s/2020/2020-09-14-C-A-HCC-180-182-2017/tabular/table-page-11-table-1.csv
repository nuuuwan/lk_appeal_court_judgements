this  Court  is  not  convinced  that  the  trial  Court  had  in  fact"
"","compared the two versions of events and of the view that it was merely rejecting"
"","the 5th  Appellant's position that he was there at the scene only as an observer, by"

"","In the circumstances, this Court partly allows the appeals of the 1st,  4th  and"
"","5th  Appellants by setting aside their conviction for the offence of murder and the"
"","sentence  of  death.  Their  conviction  for 
the  offence  of  mischief  is  accordingly"
"","affirmed.  The 
three  Appellants  are  sentenced  by 
this  Court  for  2  years  of"
"","imprisonment,  being 
the  maximum  punishment  with  which 
they 
can  be"
"","punished. In view of the fact that they were incarcerated since their conviction on"
"","02.05.2017, this Court accordingly imposes a  fine  of Rs,  100,000.00 on each of the"
"","Appellants  and  in default six  months  of imprisonment.  In the event the  default"
"","sentence is to be implemented, it should run consecutive to the other sentence."
