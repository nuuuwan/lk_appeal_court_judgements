"t
he  Petitioner’s 
leave  application  was 
refused. 
 
I 
regret  my"
"inability to agree with that contention.  Let me explain."
"Initially 
the  Petitioner  had  applied 
for 
leave 
for  one  year—"
"November  2008 
to  November  2009. 
  Thereafter,  while  being"
"abroad,  she  had  sought  an  extension  of  leave  for  another  one"
"year—from 06.12.2009 to 06.12.2010.  The Zonal Director by R4"
"refused  the  application 
for  extension. 
  On  what  basis  did  he"
"refuse  it?    It  was  refused  on  the  basis  that  approval  from  the"
"Provincial  Director  for  the  Petitioner’s  previous  leave  application,"
"sent more than one year prior, had not been received."
