"reasons  is  an  element  of  natural  justice,  the  failure  to  give"
"reasons, 
like  any  other  breach  of  natural 
justice,  should"
"render the disputed decision void. And a void decision could"
"not  be  validated  by  late  reasons  even  if  they  show  that  the"
"decision  was 
justified.  Consistent  with 
this  analysis 
the"
"Court  of  Appeal  has  quashed  a  decision  that  an  applicant"
"was 
intentionally  homeless  notwithstanding 
that 
the  bad"
"reasons 
given  when 
the 
decision  was  made  were"
"supplemented  by  good  reasons  given  in  the  Respondent’s"
"affidavit.  ‘It  is not ordinarily open’,  the  Court of Appeal said"
"in another case, ‘to a decision maker, who is required to give"
"reasons,  to  respond  to  a  challenge  by  giving  different  or"
"better reasons.’ There is always the danger that the decision-"
"maker  in  giving  supplementary  reasons  may  drift  ‘perhaps"
"subconsciously, 
into  ex  post 
facto 
rationalisation’  of 
the"
"decision.  Thus  decision-makers  should  not  be  given 
‘a"
"second bite at the cherry’. European law requires reasons to"
"be given with the decision.17"
