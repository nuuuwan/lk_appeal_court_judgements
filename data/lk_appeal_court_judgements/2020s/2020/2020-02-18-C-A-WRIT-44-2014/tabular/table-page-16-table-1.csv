"In  the  absence  of  reasons  [by  the  Controller  of  Exchange],  it"
"is impossible to determine whether or not there has been an"

"denial of justice and is itself an error of law."

"(1985)  3  All  ER  699  it  was  held  that  reasons  should  be"
"sufficiently detailed as to make quite clear to the parties and"
"specially the losing party as to why the tribunal decided as it"
"did and to avoid the impression that the decision was based"
"upon extraneous consideration rather than the matter raised"
"at the hearing.11"
