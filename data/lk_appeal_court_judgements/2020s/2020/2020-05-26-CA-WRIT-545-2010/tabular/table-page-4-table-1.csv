"Respondent University at its meeting held on 01.03.2009 to serve the vacation of post"
"notice on the Petitioner."
"The  Petitioner  contends  that  the  decision  to  consider  her  as  having  vacated  post  is  arbitrary,"
"unreasonable and ultra vires the powers of the 2nd Respondent."
"In  Nelson  De  Silva  v.  Sri  Lanka  Engineering  Services  Corporation  [(1996)  2  Sri.L.R.  242]  it  was"
"held  that  vacation  of  post  had  both  a  mental  and  physical  element.  The  Petitioner  contends"
"that in her case the mental element was not present."
"However,  the  Respondents  submitted  that  the  mental  element

"Petitioner had her first child abroad and planned to have a second child to be born soon after"
"the  end  of  her  final  leave  and  having  her  family  with  her  can  lead  to  an  inference  that  the"
"Petitioner was not intending to return."
"These  facts  taken  in  isolation  cannot  in  my  view  lead  to  an  inference  of  the  required  mental"

"authority to her sister to proceed with this case. The address of the Petitioner is given as No. 2"
"Dudley Drive, Guelph, Ontario, N1G OE5, Canada. All these factors no doubt further establish"
"the mental element."
"In  terms  of  the  Agreement  (P2)  clause  (12),  any  application  by  the  Petitioner  to  extend  the"
"Ph.D.  course  on  the  grounds  of  illness  should  have  been  supported  by  a  certificate  from  a"
"medical  officer  approved  by  the  Sri  Lankan  Embassy  in  Canada.  The  medical  certificate  (P9)"
"tendered by the Petitioner does not conform to this requirement."
