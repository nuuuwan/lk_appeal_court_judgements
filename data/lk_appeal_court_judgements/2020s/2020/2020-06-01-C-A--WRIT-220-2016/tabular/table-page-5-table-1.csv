lthough it is clear from the pleadings that the Petitioner is complaining about"
"the vires of the actions of the Respondents, this Court is in agreement with the"
"learned Senior State Counsel that this Court cannot grant a Writ of Certiorari,"
"in the complete absence of a prayer to that effect. This situation must however"
"be distinguished from a situation where there is a specific prayer for a Writ of"
"Certiorari, and the power of Court to issue the said Writ of Certiorari, albeit in"
"a modified form, in such situations. It is therefore the view of this Court that"
"paragraph (II) of the prayer is misconceived in law, and that this Court cannot"
"grant the said relief."
