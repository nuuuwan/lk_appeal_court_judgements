"The  courts  have  accepted that procedural  protection should  be  given  where an  individual  has  a"
"legitimate  expectation  of  procedural  protection  such  as  a  hearing  or  a  consultation  before  a"
"decision  is made.  It is  also  accepted that where an  individual has  a legitimate expectation that a"
"benefit of a substantive nature will be  granted, or if already in  receipt  of the benefit, that it will"
"be  continued, 
then 
fairness 
too  dictates 
that  expectat ion  of  the  benefit  should  give 
the"
"individual 
the  entitlement  to  be  permitted  to  argue 
for 
its 
fulfilment.  The  controversy 
is"
"whether  in  such  situations  th e  individual  has  a  legitimate  expectation  that  the  benefit  will  be"
"granted or continued. This  is  the question of substantive legit imate expectation."
"The  traditional objection to the doctrin e of substantive legitimate expectation is  two -fold:"
"(a) 
Ultra Vires by fettering the discretion"
"The  principle of le ga lity 
(b)"
