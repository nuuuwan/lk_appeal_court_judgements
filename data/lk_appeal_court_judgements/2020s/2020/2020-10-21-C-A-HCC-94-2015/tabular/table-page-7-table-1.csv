improbability  of  Samarajeewa's  version  of  events,  as  per"

"Appellant,  who  had  16  years  of  unblemished  service  as  a  Home  Guard,  had"
"indiscriminately  shot  three  total  strangers,  against whom he  absolutely  had  no"

"this  probability  also  with  the  probability  it  did  consider and  stated  its  reasons"
"adopting the reason of the prosecution."
