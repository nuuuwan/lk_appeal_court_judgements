"partial  towards  the  AppeIlant,  the  witness could  have  said  that no civilian was"
"all owed  near  the  pump house,  a  fact  confirmed  by IP  Silva.  But contrary  to  the"
"AppeIlant's claim, the witness said that anyone could use the road leading to  the"
"pump  house  during  his  cross-examination.  The  witness  claimed  the  three  had"
"assaulted  two  of  them.  If he  was  partial  towards  the  AppeIlant,  he could  have"
"merely said that only the AppeIlant was assaulted and not him, since that would"
"have helped  the AppeIlant to  set up a  claim of self-defence.  The trial  Court also"
"ruled  that he is a  partial witness because they lived in the same village for some"
"time and  the witness could  not recoIlect when they met after the  AppeIlant was"
"released  on  bail.  None  of  these  consideration  support  a  proposition  that  the"
"witness is in fact a partial witness and any absence of any contradiction indicated"
"that he gave a  consistent version of events since the incident.  The only blemish"
"attributable  to  him  is  he  gave  evidence  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  of  the"
"injured."
