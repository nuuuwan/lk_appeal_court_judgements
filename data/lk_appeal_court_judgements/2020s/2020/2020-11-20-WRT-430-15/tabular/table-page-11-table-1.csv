"I
t is not correct to say section 18  relates to  a  “core function” of"
"the Consumer Affairs Authority whereas section 13 does not.  As"
"I  stated  earlier,  section  8  of  the  Act  recognises  that  one  of  the"
"“functions”  of  the  Authority  is  to  “carry  out  investigations  and"
"inquiries, in relation to any matter specified in this Act”."
"Learned  Counsel  refers  to  sections  6,  66,  67  and  items  (n)  and"
"(o) of section 8 to emphasise that the functions of the Authority"
"(including  conducting 
inquiries)  can  be  delegated  even 
to  a"
"single  public  officer,  be  it  the  officers  and  staff  of  the  Authority"
"or servants and advisers of the Authority.  He highlights this to"
"argue  that  there  is  no  uniformity  in  the  applicability  of  the"
"quorum, in that an inquiry can be held by even a single officer."
"He  nevertheless  later  admits  “[inquiries]  under  section  18  of  the"
"Act which is a specific function of the Consumer Affairs Authority"
"cannot  be  delegated  under 
the  general  delegation  provisions"
"elsewhere in the Act”."
"As much as section 18 is identifiable as a specific function of the"
"Authority, so too is section 13.  An inquiry under section 13 and"
"a  decision 
thereon  cannot  be  delegated  under 
the  general"
"delegation  of  powers  to  public  officers.    In  such  inquiries,  the"
"Authority  exercises 
judicial  or  quasi-judicial  powers,  which"
"cannot  be  delegated.  The  Authority  can  delegate  powers 
in"
"respect of investigations to obtain expert opinion etc. but not in"
"respect of the main inquiry per se."

"LR 212, which is a case involving a complaint in terms of section"
"18 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, it was held at 214-215"
