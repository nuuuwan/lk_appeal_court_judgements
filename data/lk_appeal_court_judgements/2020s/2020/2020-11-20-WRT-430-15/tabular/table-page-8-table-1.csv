"subsection 
(1),  shall  be 
full 
time  members 
(hereinafter"
"referred to as “full time members of the Authority”)."
"If the argument of learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent is to"
"be accepted, the inquiry shall be held and the decision taken by"
"all  members 
of 
the  Authority, 
for 
the  quorum  would  be"
"applicable  only 
to  meetings  and  not 
to 
inquiries.  Then 
the"
"impugned inquiry and the decision thereon become ultra vires."
"The word “meeting” is not defined in the Act."
"Any argument that an inquiry can be held and a decision taken"
"by  even  one  member  of  the  Authority  sitting  alone  is  plainly"
"unacceptable."
"The  initial  argument  that  the  requirement  of  the  quorum  is"
"necessary only in respect of meetings but not inquiries is proved"
"unsustainable  by  the  next  argument  of learned  Counsel  for  the"
"2nd Respondent himself."
"Learned  Counsel,  in  the  latter  part  of  his  submission,  makes"
"another  distinction  between  an  inquiry  which  involves  policy"
"decisions  affecting  the  entire  public  and/or  an  industry  as  a"
"whole, and an inquiry between two parties on a particular issue,"
"such  as  the  sale  of  a  finished  product.    He  submits  that  the"
"quorum is required in the case of the former but not in the case"
"of  the  latter. 
  In  explaining 
further,  he  says  the  quorum  is"
"required in  section 18  inquiries but  not  in section 13  inquiries."
"But the Act does not support this argument."
