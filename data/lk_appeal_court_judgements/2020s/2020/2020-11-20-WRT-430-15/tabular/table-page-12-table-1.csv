"hat  the  power  conferred  on  the  Authority  by  statute  must  be"
"lawfully exercised by the Authority itself:"
"It is essential that for the lawful exercise of power, it should"
"be  exercised  by 
the  1st  Respondent 
[Consumer  Affairs}"
"Authority  upon  whom  such  power  is  conferred  and  by  no"
"one  else.  The  extent  of  permissible  delegation  will,  of"
"course, have to be determined with reference to the terms of"
"the statute, because if the delegation exceeds the limits set"
"out  by 
the  statute 
it  will  be  ultra  vires 
leading 
to 
the"
"invalidity  of  the  act  done  by  the  delegate.  I  am  unable  to"
"agree  with 
the 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel 
that 
the"
"powers  of  the  Authority  can  be  delegated  to  the  Pricing"
"Committee. 
The 
Pricing  Committee  may 
facilitate 
the"
"discharge of the functions of the Authority. But, the Pricing"
"Committee has no jurisdiction to exercise the powers of the"
"Authority.  The  Act  section  6  provides 
the  delegation  of"
"powers 
to  Public  Officers  only.  A  statutory  power 
to"
"delegate functions will not necessarily extend to everything."
"Thus, 
it  has  been  held 
in 
the  case  of  General  Medical"
"Council  v  U.K.  Dental  Board) 
that 
the  General  Medical"
"Council  must 
itself  exercise 
its  disciplinary  powers  over"
"Dentists  and  cannot  delegate 
them  on 
to  an  Executive"
"Committee  for  the  purpose  of  its  functions  under  Dentists"
"Act."
