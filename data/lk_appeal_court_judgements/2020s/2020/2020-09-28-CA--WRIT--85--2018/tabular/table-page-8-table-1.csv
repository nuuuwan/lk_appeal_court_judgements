"I
n  my  view,  the  2nd  Respondent,  the  Director  General  of  the"
"UDA,  abused  the  provisions  of  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of"
"Possession) Act in order to eject the 1st Petitioner from the land"
"in suit summarily.  He cannot do so.  The very fact that the Quit"
"Notice was issued after the inquiry but before the delivery of the"
"Judgment  of  the  District  Court  amply  demonstrates  mala  fides"
"on the part of the UDA.  The summary procedure of ejection laid"
"down  in  the  Act  cannot  be  allowed  to  be  abused  to  achieve"
"ulterior  motives.    That  is  not  the  intention  of  the  legislature.    I"
"quash the Quit Notice P1 by certiorari."
"I grant the reliefs to the Petitioners as prayed for in paragraphs"
"(b) and (e) of the prayer to the petition."
