"A
ggrieved  by  the  said  Order,  the  5th  Respondent  had  filed  a  revision  application  in"
"the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the  Western  Province,  holden  at  Colombo.  On  this"
"application too being dismissed, the 5th Respondent had filed an appeal in this Court,"
"which  matter  is  pending.  I  have  only  referred  to  the  above  facts  in  order  to  give"
"context  to  the  issues  that  have  arisen  in  this  application.  I  must  state  that  I  am"
"mindful  that  the 
issues  arising  from  the  said  Magistrate’s  Court  case  must  be"
"resolved in the appeal that is pending before this Court."
"T
he  Petitioner  states  that  while  the  revision  application  was  pending  in  the  High"
"Court, the 5th Respondent had continued with the construction of her house on the"
"said  premises.  The  Petitioner  states  that  he  complained  to  the  1st  Respondent,  as"
"well  as  to  the  2nd  –  4th  Respondents  about  the  unauthorised  construction,  but  that"
"they have failed to take action and/or institute action against the 5th Respondent. It"
"is  under  these  circumstances  that  the  Petitioner  has  filed  this  application,  seeking"
"inter alia a Writ of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st –  4th Respondent to  act in  terms  of"
"Sections  28A  and  28B  of 
the  UDA 
Law,  and 
to  demolish 
the  unauthorised"
"construction."
"I
n her Statement of Objections, the 5th Respondent has stated that the Petitioner is a"
"troublesome busybody who has been making complaints against her over the years"
"to  various  Government  authorities.  She  has  stated  that  she  sought  and  obtained"
"approval of the 4th Respondent in the year 2000 for Building Plan No. MB/33/2000."
"She  states  however  that  construction  work  did  not  commence  until  2006,  and  for"
"that  reason,  she  re-submitted  the  building  plan  and  that  approval  was  renewed  by"
"the  4th  Respondent.  The  5th  Respondent 
states 
that  during  construction, 
the"
"necessity  arose  to  shift  the  rear  space  of  the  house  from  the  east  to  the  west."
"Although  the  5th  Respondent  claims  that  the  4th  Respondent 
instructed  her  to"
"proceed  pending  approval,  no  written  approval  had  been  granted  by 
the  4th"
"Respondent  for  the  above  shifting  of  the  rear  space.  On  the  contrary,  the  4th"
"Respondent  has  specifically 
instructed  the  5th  Respondent,  by 
letters  dated  22nd"
"November  2006  marked  ‘5V2’  and  25th  January  2007  marked  ‘5V3’  not  to  proceed"
"with  any  construction  until  she  submits  an  amended  building  plan  and  obtains"
"approval. The construction that the 5th Respondent engaged in, pending approval is"
"the  subject  matter  of  the  aforementioned  application  to  the  Magistrate’s  Court,"
"Mount Lavinia, and the revision application and appeal arising therefrom."
"T
he  5th  Respondent  has  denied  that  the  building  on  the  said  premises  has  been"
"constructed without obtaining approval. However, an Order has already been made"
"by the Magistrate’s Court confirming that the 5th Respondent has in fact engaged in"
"construction  contrary  to  approvals  granted  by  the  4th  Respondent,  in  respect  of"
"which the aforementioned appeal is pending."
