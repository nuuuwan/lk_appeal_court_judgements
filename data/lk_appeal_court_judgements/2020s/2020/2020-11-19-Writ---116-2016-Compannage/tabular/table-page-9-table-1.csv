"subsequent  demolition  of  such  construction.  I  am  therefore  satisfied  that  the  4th"
"Respondent on whom the powers of planning have been conferred, has a legal duty"
"to take action whenever an unauthorised construction is brought to its attention. For"
"the  reasons  that 
I  have  already  set  out,  the  factual  situation  envisaged  by  the"
"empowering statute in reality exists."
"T
he  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  for  the  1st  Respondent,  the  Urban  Development"
"Authority submitted that the Petitioner’s complaint is that the construction of the 5th"
"Respondent obstructs his access to light and air, and therefore the Petitioner should"
"enforce  his  rights  through  a  civil  action. 
In  other  words,  the  submission  of  the"
"learned  Senior  State  Counsel  was  that  the  Petitioner  does  not  have  a  legal  right  to"
"secure compliance by the 5th Respondent with the applicable law. I regretfully cannot"
"agree with this submission. Quite apart from public interest litigation, an individual is"
"entitled to have his neighbour comply with the laws introduced by the legislature to"
"regulate the construction of buildings and houses. If as a result of any unauthorised"
"construction, the right of an individual to light and air is obstructed, that individual"
"has every right to complain to the regulatory agency established by law for that very"
"purpose  of  regulating constructions.  If  the  regulatory  agency  does  not  carry  out  its"
"statutory  function,  my  view  is  that  an  individual  is  entitled  to  invoke  a  public  law"
"remedy,  as  has  been  done  in  this  application.  Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"Petitioner  has  the  requisite  locus  standi  to  have  and  maintain  this  application,  and"
"that he has a legal right to seek a Writ of Mandamus."
"I
 shall now consider the relief that this Court must afford in this application. Taking"
"into  consideration  all  the  circumstances  that  I  have  referred  to,  I  issue  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus directing the 1st – 4th Respondents to act in terms of Section 28A(1)(a) of"
"the UDA Law.9 The 5th Respondent shall desist from carrying out any construction on"
"the said premises after the receipt of the notice in terms of Section 28A(1)(a)."
"I
  cannot 
ignore  the 
fact  that  the  5th  Respondent  has  made  an  application  to"
"regularise  the  unauthorised  construction.  Once  the  1st  –  4th  Respondents  acts  in"
"accordance  with  the  aforementioned  Writ  of  Mandamus,  and  provided  the  5th"
"Respondent complies with such notice, I direct the 1st – 4th Respondents to consider"
"in terms of the applicable laws and regulations the amended building plan submitted"
"by  the  5th  Respondent.  The  1st  –  4th  Respondents  may  consider  the  granting  of"
"approval 
for 
the 
said 
building 
plan, 
including 
the 
subject  matter 
of 
the"
"aforementioned Magistrate’s Court case, provided the said Plan is in accordance with"
"the  applicable laws  and  regulations,  and  subject to any other terms and  conditions"
"that the 1st – 4th Respondents may impose in terms of the law."
