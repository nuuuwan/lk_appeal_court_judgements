"The 5th Respondent states that she submitted building applications in 2008 and 2012"
"seeking approval for an amended building plan, and that the said applications have"
"not been processed in view of the pending litigation. In paragraph 34 of her affidavit,"
"the 5th Respondent has stated that, ‘the existing structure is in accordance with Plan"
"Nos. MB/69/2008 and MB/121/2012, and I consent to the demolition of any part of"
"the  building  that  deviates  from  either  Plan No.  MB/121/2012.’  Thus,  it  is  clear  that"
"there  have  been  attempts  by  the  5th  Respondent  to  regularise  the  constructions"
"which have been carried out by her."
"T
he  first  issue  before  this  Court  is  whether  the  5th  Respondent  has  engaged  in  any"
"unauthorised constructions which are not the subject matter of the aforementioned"
"action 
in  the  Magistrate’s  Court.  By  a  motion  filed  on  25th  May  2016,  the  4th"
"Respondent  had  filed  a  copy  of  Building  Plan  No.  32/2006  approved  by  it.  I  have"
"examined same and observe that there existed on the said premises, a single storey"
"house.  Approval  was  sought  and  had  been  granted  for  the  addition  of  a  structure"
"consisting  of  four  floors  –  that  is  ground  plus  three  floors,  adjoining  the  existing"
"single  storey  house.  The  photographs  of  the  building  produced  with  the  counter"
"affidavit however show a building which has five floors."
"A
nnexed  to  the  above  motion  marked  ‘B2’  is  a  sketch  prepared  by  the  Technical"
"Officer  of  the  4th  Respondent,  which  depicts 
in  orange  stripes  the  unauthorised"
"construction  which 
is 
the  subject  matter  of 
the  Magistrate’s  Court  case.  The"
"construction  for  which  approval  has  been  granted  by  Building  Plan  No.  32/2006  is"
"shown in blue stripes. Adjoining that is a three storey structure shown in red stripes,"
"which construction  has  not been  approved  by the  4th Respondent, and is therefore"
"an  unauthorised  construction.  The  4th  Respondent  has  filed  together  with  the  said"
"motion, another sketch marked ‘B1’ which shows the boundary wall and the gates of"
"the  said  premises  of 
the  5th  Respondent,  which 
the  4th  Respondent  claims 
is"
"unauthorised.  Thus,  it  is  clear  that  the  5th  Respondent  has  engaged  inter  alia  in  an"
"unauthorised construction of a three storey building and a boundary wall on the said"
"premises."
"T
he second issue before this Court is whether a Writ of Mandamus should issue  to"
"the 4th Respondent to demolish such unauthorised constructions. It would therefore"
"be appropriate to consider at this stage the matters that must be satisfied by a party"
"seeking a Writ of Mandamus."
