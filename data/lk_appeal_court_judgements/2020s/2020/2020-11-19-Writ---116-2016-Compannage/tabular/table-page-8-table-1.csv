"issued  by  the  superior  Court  for  the  performance  of  public  legal  duty.    Where"
"officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform, Mandamus"
"will  lie  to  secure  the  performance  of  the  public  duty,  in  the  performance  of"
"which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is only granted to compel the"
"performance  of  duties  of  a  public  nature,  and  not  merely  of  private  character"
"that  is  to  say  for  the  enforcement  of  a  mere  private  right,  stemming  from  a"
"contract of the parties.”"
"T
he above position has been reiterated in Jayawardena vs. People’s Bank5 where it"
"was held that:"
"“Courts  will  always  be  ready  and  willing  to apply  the  constitutional  remedy  of"
"mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must necessarily be a"
"situation  where  there 
is  a  public  duty. 
In  the  absence  of  a  public  duty  an"
"intrusion  by  this  Court  by  way  of  mandamus 
into  an  area  where  remedial"
"measures are available in private law would be to redefine the availability of a"
"prerogative writ.”"
"I
n  Rajeswari  Nadaraja  v.  M.  Najeeb  Abdul  Majeed,  Minister  of  Industries  and"
"Commerce  and  Others6  Aluwihare,  J  held  that,  “In  an  application  for  a  writ  of"
"mandamus, the first matter to be settled is whether or not the officer or authority in"
"question has in law and in fact the power which he or she refused to exercise. As a"
"question  of  law,  it  is  one  of  interpreting  the  empowering  statutory  provisions.  As  a"
"question  of  fact, 
it  must  be  shown  that  the  factual  situation  envisaged  by  the"
"empowering statute in reality exists.”"
"Thus, while the public authority must be under a legal or public duty to carry out the"
"act  which  a  petitioner  demands,  the  petitioner  must  have  a 
legal  right  to  the"
"performance of such public duty. In Kaluarachchi vs Ceylon Petroleum Corporation"
"and Others,7 Fernando J, referring to the judgment in Credit Information Bureau of"
"Sri  Lanka  vs  M/s 
Jafferjee  and 
Jafferjee 
(Pvt)  Limited8 
reiterated 
that,  “the"
"foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not grant a"
"Writ of Mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal and not based upon a public"
"duty.”"
"I
  have  already  set  out  the  provisions  of  the  UDA  Law  which  mandates  that  any"
"development activity must be carried out only with a permit issued by the 1st or 4th"
"Respondent.  Failure  to  do  so  would  render  such  construction,  unauthorised,  and"
