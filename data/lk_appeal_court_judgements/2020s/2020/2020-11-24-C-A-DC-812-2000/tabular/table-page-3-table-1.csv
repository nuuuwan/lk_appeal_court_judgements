"Plaintiffs further state  that the  Defendants that are  in  unlawful  possession  after breaching"
"the  relevant  conditions  in  the  Notarial  Executed  Retirement  Deed  P3,  and  specially clause  8"
"and  continuing to be  in  such  possession  and  are  still  carrying  out business,  and  had  gained"
"tremendous  advantage  over  the  Plaintiffs,  and  caused 
loss  and  damage  to Ithe  Plaintiffs."
"Thus  it  is  to  the  advantage  of the  Defendants  to  continue  to  possess  on  the  basis  of  an"
"imaginary agreement to sell."
"The  Defendants, as  opposed  to the previous argument state that it is  true that the Plaintiffs"
"retired  from  the business  with effect from  10.02.1983  (P3)  attested  by  K.  Jegadeesan  N.P.,"
"and  by  the  said  deed  the  Defendants  were  allowed  to  run 
the  business 
for  two  years."
"However,  upon 
retirement 
from 
the  partnership, 
the  agreement  between 
the  parties'"
"consequent  to  an  accounting  was  that  the  Defendants  will  pay  to  the  Plaintiffs  a sum  of"
"RS.2.5Miliion."
"The  Defendant  further  states  that  towards  settlement  of  this  sum  the  Defendants  have"
"given  to the Plaintiffs a promissory note to the value of Rs.  1,000,000/- and  by Deed  NO.834"
"of  10.02.1983  attested  by  K. 
Jegadeesan  N.P. 
(P2) 
the  Defendants 
transferred 
their"
"undivided half share in the said  premises No.137, to the Plaintiffs by way of security."
"The  Defendants  state 
that  by  a  separate  notarially  attested  agreement  which  cannot"
"presently  be 
traced 
the  Plaintiffs  agreed  to  retransfer  the  entirety  of the  said  premises"
"No.137, upon payment to them of the full sum of RS.2.5  Million."
"In  my observations through  the evidence  led  in  court, the  Defendants  have  already paid  to"
"the  Plaintiffs  the  sum  of  Rs.  1,000,000/- due  on 
the  said  promissory  which 
thus  stands"
"discharged. Thereafter, the  Defendants have  paid  to the  Plaintiffs a further of Rs.  300,000/"
"and  now the balance due to the Plaintiffs from the Defendants is  Rs.  1,200,000/-."
"that  the  Plaintiffs  are  deliberately  avoiding  accepting  the  balance  sum  of  Rs. 
I  believe"
"1,200,000/- which the Defendants are  ready and  willing to pay as the Defendants have tried"
"several times to pay the Plaintiffs the said  balance sum of Rs.  1,200,000/-"
"The  Plaintiffs have  both by  virtue of the said  notarial  attested agreement which  is  presently"
"not traceable  and  orally agreed  to  retransfer the  said  premises  No.137  upon  receiving  the"
"full payment of Rs.2.5  Million out of which a sum of Rs.1.3  Million has already paid."
