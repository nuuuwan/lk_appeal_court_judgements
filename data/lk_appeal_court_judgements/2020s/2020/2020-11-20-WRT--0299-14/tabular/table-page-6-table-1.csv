"T
he fact that the decision P14 is provisional is amply clear by a"
"glance at the first paragraph of the said Agreement, which says"
"the  4th  and  5th  Respondents  shall  deposit  the  ground  share  for"
"the  undivided  2/20th  share 
in  the  name  of  the  3rd  and  4th"
"Petitioners  “until  a  decision 
is  taken  after  an 
inquiry”.    It  is"
"significant to note that the printed portion of text which refers to"
"a  court  case  being  filed  for  vindication  of  rights  in  this  regard"
"has  been  struck  off,  both 
in 
the  said  paragraph  and 
in"
"paragraph 8 of the Agreement.  This goes to show that P14 was"
"provisional  pending  a  final  order.    I  need  not  labour  the  point"
"because the Petitioners themselves admit so in paragraph 12 of"
"their  written  submissions  dated  13.01.2020  when 
they  say"
"“Merely  because  P14  is  not  a  final  order,  shall  not  help  the  2nd"
"Respondent inasmuch as P14 was entered into after conducting a"
"proper inquiry.”"
"P14  was  not  made  after  a  formal  inquiry.    It  appears  to  have"
"been  made  by  the  Legal  Branch  on  prima  facie  facts  pending  a"
"final order by the Authority."
"After the order P14, the inquiry continued with the participation"
"of the 3rd and 4th Petitioners."
"It is thereafter the final order marked P22 was made.  The final"
"decision  is  primarily  that  the  3rd  and  4th  Petitioners  failed  to"
"establish the rights they claim and hence should institute action"
"in  an  appropriate  court  to  establish  their  rights  within  three"
"months of the decision."
"The Petitioners rely on a District Court Judgment marked P11 to"
"make  their  claim  to  undivided  rights.    However,  the  4th  and  5th"
"Respondents  have  produced  the  documents  marked  X1  and  X2"
