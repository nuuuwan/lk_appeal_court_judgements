"appeal and a retrial was ordered, and at the retrial the case was"
"settled, in that, out of the 1/4th share belonging to Sinduwa (i.e."
"the predecessor in title of the Petitioners), only a 1/8th share was"
"to go to the heirs of Sinduwa. The Petitionersâ€™ claim to undivided"
"rights 
is  based  on 
the  said  District  Court  Judgment.  The"
"Petitioners  have  not  disclosed 
the  appeal  decision  and 
the"
"settlement  arrived at thereafter.    Nor do  they dispute  the  above"
"facts before this Court."
"The Petitioners challenge P22 not on the merits but on the legal"
"ground  that  the  Authority  cannot  reverse  or  review 
its  own"
"decision.    This  argument  of  the  Petitioners  is  unsustainable  in"
"the facts of this case as set out above. A court or tribunal can be"
"said  to  be  functus  officio  only  after  the  final  order  is  made."
"Interim  or  provisional  orders  made  pending  final  determination"
"of the matter do not bring about the same result."
"The Supreme Court Judgment marked P13 which the Petitioners"
"refer  to  is  not  relevant.    That  Judgment  is  with  regard  to  a"
"dispute  between  the  4th  and  5th  Respondents  on  an  earlier"
"application  for  a  gem-mining  licence,  to  which  the  Petitioners"
"were not parties.  The present joint application for a gem-mining"
"licence made to the Authority by the 4th and 5th Respondents is"
"completely different, although the land appears to be the same."
"The  Petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  the  relief  prayed  for.  The"
"application of the Petitioners is dismissed but without costs."
