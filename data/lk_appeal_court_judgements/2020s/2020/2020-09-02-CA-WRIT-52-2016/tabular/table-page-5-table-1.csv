"Section 199 of the Land Manual inter alia sets out the procedure"
"to  be 
followed 
in  such  alienations. 
  This  section  has  been"
"produced  marked  P22.    In  summary,  according  to  this  section,"

"identified to be alienated on a preferential long lease basis, such"
"a  proposal  shall  be  gazetted  so  as  to  notify  the  general  public"
"that they may object to such a move.  The Minister shall take a"
"final decision only after considering the objections, if any, of the"
"public.  Possession of the land cannot be handed over until such"
"steps are taken."
"The  Respondents  do  not  say  section  199  is  inapplicable  in  this"
"instance or that the said procedure was followed before delivery"
"of possession of the land to the 6th-9th Respondents."
