"would  have  sufficed  for  the  legislature  to  have  plainly  stated  that  the  Respondent  would  be"
"required to grant the exemption simply upon the notice made by the Minister."
"This  is  further buttressed  by the fact that section  17(C)(2)(b)  reads""  is,  on  the recommendation"
"of  the  Minister  in  charge  of  the  subject  of  Indu stries,  approved  by 
the  Minister  by  notice"
"published  in  the Gazette on  or before April  1,  1992  as  a company to which  this section  applies;"
"and"" . (Emphasis added)"
"in 
In  S.B.  Perera  v.  Standard  Chartered  Bank  and  Others  [(1995)  1 Sri.L.R.  73]  Amerasinghe  J."
"holding that section  19 of the Industrial  Disputes Act  has  two parts took into consideration  the"
"fact that they were separated by a semicolon."
"Then 
the 
issue 
is  whether 
the  Appellant  has 
fulfilled 
the 
required  criteria 
to  obtain 
the"
"exemption. 
In 
this  regard 
the  application  of  the  proviso  to  the  present  case  needs  to  be"
"examined  to ascertain  whether the Appellant 
is  an  undertaking formed  by  the splitting up, re"
"construction, or acquisition of any business which was previously in  existence."
"In  Shanmuganayagam  and Another v.  Commissioner General of Inland  Revenue  [Sri  Lanka  Tax"
"Cases  Vol . IV  page  308]  the Supreme  Court held  that whether an  undertaking is  a new venture"
"or an  old  one will depend on  severa l factors. Tran sfer of assets from the old  business to the  so"
"called  new  venture 
is  an 
indication  of  ""continuation""  as  opposed 
to  ""creation""  of  a  new"
"venture.  Furthermore, the carrying on  of the former activities without abandoning them would"
"indicate and  it is  not a new distinct or separate  business from the old  bus in ess.  Even  if the form"
"of the  business  be  altered  resulting  in  a  complete  reconstruction  by  the  old  venture,  it  may"
"nevertheless be  a continuation of the old  business."
"The 
following 
evidence 
supports 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Appellant  was 
formed 
by 
the"
"reconstruction/splitting of Forbes Ceylon  Ltd.  and  as  such  is  not entitled to the tax exemption:"
"(i) 
The  admission  in 
letter  dated  09.01.1996  written  by  the  Appellant  to  the  Respondent"
"that  Forbes  Ceylon 
Limited 
had 
pursuant 
to  a 
tax 
incentive  announced 
during"
"1989/1990 commenced  production  of soy  products  but that  later a  new  company  was"
"formed  as  it was a requirement to obtain the tax exemption."
