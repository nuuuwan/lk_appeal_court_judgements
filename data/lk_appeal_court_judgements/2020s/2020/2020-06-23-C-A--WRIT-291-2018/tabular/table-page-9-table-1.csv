"T
he  main  relief  sought  by  the  Petitioner  is  to  quash  the  Lease"
"Agreement by certiorari.  Learned State Counsel for the NHDA is"
"technically  correct  when  she  states  what  shall  be  prayed  for  is"
"not to quash the Lease Agreement per se but the decision of the"
"NHDA  to  lease  the  land  to  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Kovil,"
"which has not been challenged in these proceedings.  The Lease"
"Agreement, which is a by-product of the decision of the NHDA to"
"lease the land, is not the central issue but a peripheral one."
"The question whether there is a legally enforceable Agreement or"
"not is a matter of concern to the parties to the Lease Agreement,"
"not to any others.  If it is legally unenforceable, one party to the"
"Agreement  is  bound  to  suffer.    But  there  is  no  such  dispute"
"between  the  two  parties  to  the  Lease  Agreement.    Hence,  the"
"said issue raised on behalf of the Petitioner will not address the"
"main grievance of the Petitioner, i.e. the decision of the NHDA to"
"give  Lot  353  to  the  Kovil  on  a  long  lease  in  furtherance  of  the"
"latterâ€™s religious activities."
"As learned Counsel for the Board of Trustees of the Kovil points"
"out,  if  the  Court  holds  the  Lease  Agreement  is  void  for  the"
"reason  all  the  trustees  have  not  signed,  the  trustees  can  enter"
"into  a  fresh  Lease  Agreement  with  the  NHDA.    The  NHDA,  I"
"suppose,  is  ready  to  do  so,  if  required.    Then  it  is  clear  the"
"answer to this issue is not crucial but maybe academic."
"This is a writ application and writ is a discretionary relief.  The"
"role of the writ Court is different to that of the District Court.  If"
"there  is  an  issue  regarding  the  establishment  of  a  charitable"
"trust, it shall be decided by the District Court under the Trusts"
