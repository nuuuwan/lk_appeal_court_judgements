"Learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  strenuously  contends"
"that 
this 
decision 
of 
the 
Commissioner 
General 
is"
"unreasonable/irrational/procedurally

law"
"on the face of the record.  I am inclined to agree."
"The  Commissioner  General  who  took  the  decision  did  not  hold  the"
