This application of the employees was allowed by the inquiring officer on"
"the  following  day  in  the  presence  of  the  employees’  Attorney-at-Law.5"
"Three Acre Farms Ltd did not participate at the inquiry thereafter."
"In  my 
view, 
the 
inquiring  officer 
should  not  have  allowed 
this"
"application  because  the  question  to  be  decided  at  the 
inquiry  was"
"whether the employer at the time of the termination of employment was"
"Hijra Farms (Pvt) Ltd or Three Acre Farms Ltd, and the direction of the"
"Court of Appeal was that the necessary parties should be called in order"
"to  arrive  at  a  fresh  decision.    This  purpose  was  defeated  when  Three"
"Acre Farms Ltd was discharged."
"The  firm  position  taken  up  by  Hijra  Farms  Pvt  Ltd  at  the  inquiry  was"
"that  they  sold  the  entire  property  including  the  business  as  a  going"
"concern to Three Acre Farms Ltd on 30.12.2003 by deed marked at the"
"inquiry R3, which was long before the termination of employment, and"
"therefore,  they  (Hijra  Farms  Pvt  Ltd)  were  not  responsible  for  the  said"
"termination.6"
"At  the  inquiry,  evidence  was  led  by  both  parties―Hijra  Farms  Pvt  Ltd"
"and the applicant employees. However, before the inquiring officer could"
"make recommendations to the Commissioner General of Labour to take"
"a final decision, the said inquiring officer was transferred to a different"
"Ministry."
"The  2nd  Respondent  Deputy  Commissioner 
of  Labour  was 
then"
"confronted with this issue.  The Deputy Commissioner  suggested three"
"options: 
(a)  to  make  recommendations  by  the 
inquiring  officer  who"
"conducted 
the 
inquiry; 
(b) 
to  make 
recommendations  by  another"
"5 Vide page 465 of X."
"6 Vide the written submission filed by the Petitioner at the inquiry before the"
"Commissioner General of Labour at pages 713-716 of X."
