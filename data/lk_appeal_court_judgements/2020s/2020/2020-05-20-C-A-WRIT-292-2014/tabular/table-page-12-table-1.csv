"employees  to  continue  their  employment  with  the  same  terms  and"
"conditions  without  a  break  in  service.    Such  a  question,  he  admitted,"
"shall  be  decided  on 
the  unique 
facts  and  circumstances  of  each"
"individual case."
"If  it  is  otherwise,  i.e.  if  there  is  a  blanket  prohibition  in  law  to  sell  a"
"business  as  a  going  concern  with  the  labour  force,  then  there  was  no"
"necessity  in  this  case  for  an  inquiry  by  the  Commissioner  General  of"
"Labour  with  voluminous  evidence 
led  by 
the  parties 
in  order 
to"
"ascertain who the employer was.  On the admitted facts by Hijra Farms"
"Pvt Ltd, which I adverted to earlier (i.e. that they sold  the company  on"
"30.12.2003), an order could have been made."
"In Hassan’s case (supra) the employer company, without the consent of"
"the  employee,  transferred  the  employee  (a)  to  a  different  company  (a"
"subsidiary  of  the  former),  (b)  situated  in  a  different  place, 
(c)  in  a"
"different  capacity.    The  employee  refused  to  go  and  complained  to  the"
"Commissioner General of Labour of termination of services and sought"
"reinstatement  with  back  wages.    The  question  to  be  decided  was  not"
"who the employer was (as in this case) but whether or not there was a"
"termination  of  services 
in  such  circumstances. 
  The  Commissioner"
"General  answered  that  question  in  the  affirmative  and  the  Supreme"
"Court affirmed it."
"The  facts  in  the  instant  case  are  totally  different.    The  issue  to  be"
"resolved is different.  In the instant case, if I may repeat, the issue is not"
"that there was a termination of services but rather who occasioned it.  It"
"is 
true 
that 
the  word 
‘employer’ 
is  defined 
in 
the  Termination  of"
"Employment  of  Workmen  Act.    Nevertheless,  the  question  ‘who  the"
"employer is’ is not a pure question of law.  It is a mixed question of fact"
"and law."
