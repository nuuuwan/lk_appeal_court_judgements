"In The Board of Trustees of the Maradana Mosque v. Mahmud (1966) 70"
"CLW  41,  the  Appellants  successfully  challenged  the  take-over  order  by"
"the  Minister  on  two  grounds:  one,  in  violation  of  a  rule  of  natural"
"the  other,  as  held  by 
the  Privy 
justice―audi  alteram  partem;  and"
"Council,  “in  making  the  order  the  Minister  had  not  considered  the  right"
