"Ibrahim  Rahumathuma  v.  Peoples  Bank  [1993]  2  Sri  LR  387  at",""
"","The  3rd  Respondent  made  her  application  to  the  Bank  on"
"","10-07-1979,  nearly  five  years  before  the  amendment  of"
"","1984 had come into force. This delay, enabled the Petitioner"
"","to raise the objection of time bar. If the application had been"
"","processed  expeditiously,  a  decision  to  acquire  may  have"
"","been  made  prior  to  the  amendment  coming  into  force.  In"
"these  circumstances, 
it  would  surely  be  an","injustice,  to"
"","strike  down  the  application  of  the  3rd  Respondent  on  the"
"","basis of  a new factor in  the form of  an  amendment,  which"
"","came into force during the period of delay, for which the 3rd"
"Respondent  was  not  responsible.  On  the  other  hand,","if"
"there 
was 
another 
applicant, 
who 
was","similarly"
"","circumstanced as the 3rd Respondent but whose application"
"was  expeditiously  processed  and  a  decision  made","to"
"acquire  prior 
to 
the  amendment;  would  not","such  an"
"applicant 
have 
an 
undue 
advantage 
over 
the","3rd"
