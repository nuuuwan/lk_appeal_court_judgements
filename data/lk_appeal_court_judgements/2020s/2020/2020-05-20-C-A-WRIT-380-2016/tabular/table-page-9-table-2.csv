"matters  too,  weigh  against  the interpretation contended for"
"by learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the Petitioner."
"I  am  in  total  agreement  with  these  observations.  In  the  instant"
"case, the Petitioner filed this application on 04.11.2016 and the"
"new Circular was issued nearly one and a half years later, i.e. on"
"05.04.2018. 
If 
the  application  of 
the  Petitioner  had  been"
"processed expeditiously, he would have been entitled to the relief"
"sought without contest from the State."
"For 
the  aforesaid  reasons, 
I  grant 
the  relief  prayed 
for 
in"
"paragraph 
(e)  of 
the  prayer 
to 
the  petition  and  allow 
the"
"application of the Petitioner but without costs."
