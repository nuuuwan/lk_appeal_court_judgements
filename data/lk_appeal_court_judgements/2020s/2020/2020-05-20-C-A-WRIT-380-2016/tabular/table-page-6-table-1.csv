"W
hen a statute can be interpreted in favour of either the subject"
"or  the  State,  the  tendency  is  to  interpret  it  in  favour  of  the"
"former, for it is the fundamental obligation of the State to protect"
"the  interests  of  citizens,  for  the  benefit of  whom  alone  it  exists."
"There is a presumption that the legislature does not intend what"
"is unreasonable and unjustifiable."
"(12th  Edition)  at  page  225 
Bindra’s 
Interpretation  of  Statutes"
"states “Where an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a"
"reasonable  doubt  as  regards  its  meaning,  the  benefit  of  doubt"
"must  be  given  to  the  subject  and  against  the  legislature  which"
"failed to explain itself.”"
"Wade in his monumental work Administrative Law (11th Edition)"
"at 735-736, whilst discussing the legal form and characteristics"
"of  Circulars,  states  that  although  Circulars  have  no  inherent"
"legal  effect, 
“they  may  be  used  as  a  vehicle 
for  conveying"
"instructions  to  which  some  statute  gives  legal  force…They  may"
"also contain legal advice of which the courts will take notice.”"
"Our Courts have recognised that Circulars are amenable to writ"
"jurisdiction.  Vide  The  Surveyors’  Institute  of  Sri  Lanka  v.  The"
"Surveyor General [1994] 2 Sri LR 319;  Pathirana v. Victor Perera"
"[2006] 2 Sri LR 281."
"Hence,  one  may  argue 
that 
the  principles  of 
interpreting"
"subordinate 
legislation 
are 
applicable 
in 
giving 
effect 
to"
"Circulars. In this regard, Bindra in the said treatise at page 100"
"states “The courts should take a cautious approach in construing"
"the  subordinate  legislation  and  adopt  almost  the  same  standard"
"as adhered to in interpreting legislative enactments.”"
