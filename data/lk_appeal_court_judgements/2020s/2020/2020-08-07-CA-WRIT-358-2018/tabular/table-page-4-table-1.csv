"No.14,  1st  Cross  Street,  Maharagama,  owned  by 
the  12th"
"Respondent. 
  The  12th  Respondent’s  attempt 
to 
eject 
the"
"Petitioners by a rei vindicatio action was unsuccessful.  Both the"
"District Court and, on appeal, the Civil Appeal High Court held"
"that  the  Petitioners  are  tenants  protected  under  the  Rent  Act,"
"No.7 of 1972, as amended, and cannot be ejected otherwise than"
"under the provisions of the said Act."
"Less than five months after the appeal Judgment, the occupant"
"of 
the  adjoining  premises  sent 
the 
letter  marked  P5  dated"
"24.07.2018 to the Chairman of the Public Petitions Committee of"
"the  Western  Provincial  Council 
through  a  Member  of 
the"
"Provincial  Council,  seeking  to  demolish  the  premises  in  suit  on"
"the ground that the premises, which the said occupant claims is"
"more 
than  ninety  years  old, 
is 
in  a  dilapidated  condition"
"endangering his and his employees’ lives."
"The Public Petitions Committee of the Provincial Council held an"
"inquiry into the matter and recommended to the 9th Respondent,"
"the  Maharagama  Urban 
Council, 
that 
the 
premises 
be"
"demolished."
"By filing this application, the Petitioners seek to quash the said"
"recommendation  by  certiorari  predominantly  on  the  basis  that"
"the Public Petitions Committee of the Provincial Council  has no"
"power  to  recommend  the  demolition  of  the  premises  when  the"
"premises are admittedly governed by the Rent Act."
