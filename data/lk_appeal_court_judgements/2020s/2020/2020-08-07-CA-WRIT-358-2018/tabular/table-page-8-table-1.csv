"L
earned  Counsel  for  the  12th  Respondent  vehemently  submits"
"that  recommendations  are  not  amenable  to  writ  jurisdiction."
"Although this may have been the traditional view, administrative"
"law  has  developed  to  a  stage  where  recommendations  are  now"
"amenable  to  writ  jurisdiction,  if  such  recommendations  affect"
"the rights of citizens. Hence, I take the view the recommendation"
"in issue is subject to judicial review."
"The  recommendation  of  the  Public  Petitions  Committee  of  the"
"Provincial Council is ultra vires and has no force or avail in law."
"The  preliminary  objection  raised  by 
learned  Counsel 
for  the"
"Urban  Council 
that 
the  1st-6th  Respondent  Members  of 
the"
"Public  Petitions  Committee  were  not  served  with  notice  and"
"therefore  the  application  shall  be  dismissed 
is  not 
in 
limine"
"entitled to succeed.  Notice was served on the said Respondents"
"several  times  by  registered  post,  notwithstanding  they  are  no"
"longer holding office."
"I grant the Petitioners the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b)-"
"(e) and (h) of the prayer to the petition."
"The application is allowed with costs."
