"and  he  knew  that  the sustained  assault on the  deceased"" ...  is  likely  to  cause  the"
"death of the  particular person attacked""."
"When 
the  body  of  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution  is  examined"
"carefully it revealed that there was no evidence that the Appellant knew that the"
"deceased had an underlying heart illness, which is likely to accelerate  his death if"
"the  assault  is  continued.  Although  there  is  evidence  that  the  deceased  pleaded"
"with  the  officers  that he  had  no  weapon, 
there was  no  mention  of any  illness."
"When the deceased  met his  lawyer, he did not complain of any heart condition."
"Witness Mansi!  said he asked the Appellant to allow the deceased to be treated at"
"a Hospital seeing the assault and if not he would die, but did not disclose that his"
"brother-in-law had a heart condition."
"the  brother  of 
the  deceased's  wife  and 
Witness  Mohammed  Uniaisis"
"witnessed  the  arrest  of his  brother-in-law  by  Police.  The  witness  lived  with  the"
"deceased  and  his  wife.  During examination in chief  the  witness  stated  that  the"
"deceased  had  no  illness  prior  to  his arrest and  after few  days  he  learnt that the"
"deceased had died in hospital."
"It  appears  that not only  his  close  relatives,  but the deceased  himself,  was"
"not aware as to his pre-existing heart condition at the time of the assault."
"The evidence of  the  Appellant's personal involvement in the assault of the"
"deceased  is  limited  to  the  witnesses,  who  saw  the  deceased  for  a  brief  period"
