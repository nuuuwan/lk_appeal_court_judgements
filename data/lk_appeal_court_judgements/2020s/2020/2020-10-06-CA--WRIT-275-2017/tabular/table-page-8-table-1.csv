onstructed  and  the  objective  of  the  state  has  been  achieved."
"Therefore, the Petitioner says he has a legitimate expectation of"
"revocation of the vesting order or a divesting order in respect of"
"the  subject  land.    I  cannot  accept  this  argument.    In  my  view,"
"this  being  a  writ  application,  this  argument  goes  against  the"
"Petitioner.  As a result of filing this application, the Respondents"
"could  not  complete 
the  entire  project,  only  part  of 
it  was"
"completed.  Now 
the  Petitioner  says 
the  objective  has  been"
"achieved  and  therefore  there  is  a  legitimate  expectation  that  a"
"revocation of the vesting order or divesting order be made by the"
"Minister  in  respect  of  his  portion  of  land.  A  writ  Court  will  not"
"countenance  such  conduct.    The  Respondents  do  not  say  the"
"objective 
(relocation  of 
the  pineapple  sellers)  has  been 
fully"
"achieved."
"The Petitioner slept over his rights, if any, and waited for nearly"
"three  years  from  early  2014  before  filing  this  application  in  the"
"latter part of 2017 when the construction work on the stalls was"
"about to commence."
"By 
filing 
this  application, 
the  Petitioner  seeks 
to  quash  by"
"certiorari  the  aforementioned  section  5  notice,  section  7  notice"
"and  section  38  proviso  (a)  order  made  in  2014,  which  he  was"
"aware of at that time.  The Petitioner is guilty of laches.  He also"
"seeks  to  issue  a  mandate  in  the  nature  of  mandamus  directing"
"the  6th  Respondent  subject  Minister  to  revoke  the  vesting  order"
"in 
terms  of 
section  39(1)  of 
the  Act. 
 
In 
the 
facts  and"
"circumstances of this case, no such order can be made.  In the"
"alternative,  the  Petitioner  seeks  an  order  directing  the  Minister"
"to  make  a  divesting  order  in  terms  of  section  39A(1)  of  the  Act."
"When  steps  have  been  taken  to  implement  the  public  purpose"
