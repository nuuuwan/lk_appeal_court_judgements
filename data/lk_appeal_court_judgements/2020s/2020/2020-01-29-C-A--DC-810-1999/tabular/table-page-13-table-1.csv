"The only effect of this section is that if a person is in possession, his title is presumed until"
"the title of some other person is established."
"Section no is based on the premise that possession of movable or immovable property is"
"presumptive  proof of ownership,  because  men generally  own  the  property  which  they"

"that of which he has possession, is on the person who affirms it."
"There is no such rebuttal in this case  to defeat the ownership created by Section no and I"
