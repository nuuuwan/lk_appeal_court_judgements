"Section  llA of the TAC  Act enables the TIIC to  refer for th e opi nion of this  Court a Case  Stated."
"Accordingly,  we  are  of  the  opinion  there 
is  a  valid 
reference  and  make  our  determination"
"accordingly."
"Although  five  questions of law were  refe rred  to Court  by  th e TAC,  the  learned  counsel  for the"
"Appellant acting  in  the  best  traditions of the  Bar as  always, 
informed that the Appellant  limits"
"its arguments to the questions of la w  nos.  2 and 4(a) an d 4(b)."
"Nature af the Contracts"
"The  Appellant  has  entered 
into  several  contracts  with  contractors 
for  the  uprooting  and"
"removal  of rubber trees.  A sample  of one  such  contract  ha s been  marked  as  R2  in  the  brief. In"
"terms of the contract R2,  the Contractor has to pay the Appellant a sum  of Rs. 1,600/= per tree."
"The  entire  responsibility of uprootin g  ,md  the  remo va l  of the  tree  is  the  responsibility  of the"
"It goes  on to specify that th e Contracto r  must  remove everything from  the ground 
Contractor."
"which  include even the roots which  are th e size of pencils."
"The  contention  of  the  learned  counsel 
for  the  Appellant  is 
that  the  contracts  are 
in  effect"
"contracts for the sale  of rubber trees in  situ  (i.e.  live  rubber trees  in  the  natural  form)  and  the"
"successful  bidder  has  paid  the  full  sale  co nside ration  when  the  trees  are  in  live  form  and  live"
"trees are  ""unprocessed agricultural produ ct"", which is an  exempt supply within item (b)(xxiii) of"
"Part II  of the First Schedule to the VAT Act.  In  the alternative the Appellant contends that it sold"
"agricultural  plants which  is  an  exempt supp ly  within  item  (a)(xi)  of Part  II  of the  First Schedule"
"to the VAT Act."
"The  analysis must begin with the interpreta tion of the contracts the Appellant entered into with"
"Contractors.  In  this exercise,  it must be bo rne  in  mind that ""interpretation  is the ascertainment"
"of the  meaning  which 
the  document  wo uld  convey  to  a  reasonable  person  having  all 
the"
"to 
the  parties 
in 
the 
background  knowledge  which  would  reasonably  have  been  available"
