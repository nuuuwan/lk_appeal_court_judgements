"under ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007 and set up a wrong judicial precedent."
"At the hearing of this application, learned Counsel for  the Petitioner"
"submitted that the High Court made order cancelling his existing bail order"
"without giving him a hearing. Therefore, learned Counsel contends that the"
"said  Court  had 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion  without 
any 
evidence 
or"
"information 
that 
there 
is 
a 
greater  possibility 
that  he  might  evade"
"appearing  before  Court.  He  relied  on  the  judgment of  this  Court  in  CA"
"(PHC)  Application  No.  58/2013  -
decided  on  03.09.2013  where  it  was"
"reiterated  that"" ... 
the  Court  is  entitled  to  cancel  a bail  bond  (after  hearing  the"
"accused) for  violating  the  bail  conditions  ... ""  and in this instance there was no"
"opportunity  afforded 
to 
the  Petitioner  to  offer  his  explanation.  He  also"
"referred to the original order by which the Petitioner was enlarged on bail,"
"which had no condition imposed on the Petitioner not to re-offend. Thus, it"
"was  contended  that  the impugned order of cancellation of  bail  was  made"
"contrary to law and the subsequent order of the said Court in refusing bail,"
"too is dependent on the legality of the order of cancellation."
