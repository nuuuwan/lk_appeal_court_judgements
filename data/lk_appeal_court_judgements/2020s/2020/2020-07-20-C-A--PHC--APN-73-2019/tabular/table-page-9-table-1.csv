"had complained  the atrocious conduct of the PNB officers in foisting these"
"their  personal  animosity  to  any 
very  serious  allegations  on  him  due  to"
"authority, which is the reasonable conduct expected of such a person."
"The Petitioner also stated in his petition  that"" ...  learned High Court"
"Judge failed to observe that the Petitioner appeared in Court in all the dates"
"in  this  Case  except  when  he  was  remanded 
... ""and  described  the  said"
"ground as an exceptional ground."
"In 
stating 
this  particular  ground 
as 
exceptional, 
the  Petitioner"
"qualifies himself to his declaration to ""this case"". There is a valid reason for"
"this  selective assertion.  This  is  due to  the fact  that in Case No.  HC 29/16,"
"the Petitioner did not appear before the High Court on a  trial date and was"
"produced before that Court on 11.01.2018, being arrested upon execution of"
"a warrant of arrest. On that day, his sureties sought to withdraw from their"
"suretyships and  the Court made order remanding the Petitioner.  This  is  a"
"clear attempt to mislead this Court by the Petitioner and in the light of the"
"misstatement referred  to  above,  this  Court is  convinced  that the Petitioner"
"did  not come  to  this  Court with clean  hands.  The  relief  he  seeks  being  a"
"discretionary  remedy,  his  conduct  is  very  material  in  determining  this"
"application."
"In relation to the 2nd impugned order, the Petitioner has clearly failed"
"to 
establish 
before 
the  High  Court 
that 
there  were 
exceptional"
"circumstances. When three  of his applications for bail is  taken up, it is  not"
"clear whether the Petitioner had addressed the Court on two different legal"
"that  are  applicable 
to 
these  applications. 
In 
relation 
to 
the 
regimes"
"allegation  of  murder,  it  is  the  provisions  of  Bail  Act  that  are  applicable"
