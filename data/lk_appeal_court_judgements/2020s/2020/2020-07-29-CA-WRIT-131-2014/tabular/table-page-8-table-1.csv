"The  5th-8th  Respondents 
further  say,  although  the  Petitioner"
"states in the petition that he is in sole possession of the land in"
"dispute,  R3-R5  demonstrate  the  7th  and  8th  Respondents  are"
"also  in  possession  of  the  land.    This,  in  my  view,  cannot  be"
"considered a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner"
"on  a  material 
fact  warranting  dismissal  of 
the  Petitionerâ€™s"
"application  in  limine.    This  is  neither  a  possessory  action  nor  a"
"Section 66 application.  The question is not who is in possession"
"of  the  land  but  rather,  who,  in  terms  of  the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance,  is  entitled to  succeed  to the  land upon the death  of"
"the Permit holder and his spouse."
"Finally,  the  5th-8th  Respondents  state  the  Petitioner  is  guilty  of"
"laches  having  come  before  this  Court  nearly  20  years  after  A4"
"and A5 were issued.  I cannot understand this argument.  There"
"was  no  necessity 
for 
the  Petitioner,  being 
the  nominated"
"successor  of  the  original  Permit  holder  Heen  Banda,  to  come"
"before  this  Court  until  the  1st  Respondent,  by  A13,  refused  to"
"discharge  his  statutory  duty  and  declare 
the  Petitioner 
the"
"successor  to  the  land.    There  is  no  delay  on  the  part  of  the"
"Petitioner."
"I grant the Petitioner the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b),"
"(c) and (d) of the prayer to the petition."
"The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs."
