"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The  Permit  marked  A1  dated  28.02.1992  was  issued  under  the"
"Land Development Ordinance, No.19 of 1935, as amended, to A."
"M. Heen Banda, in respect of a portion of land comprising high"
"land and paddy land.  Heen Banda was married to D. M. Sudu"
"Bandi, and they had eight children.  The Petitioner and the 5th-"
"8th Respondents are the sons born of that union.  As seen from"
"page 2 of the said Permit, Heen Banda nominated the Petitioner"
"as  his  successor  to  the  land  on  the  same  day  the  Permit  was"
"issued."
"Heen Banda died on 15.01.1995 and, in terms of section 48A(1)"
"of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance,  his  spouse,  Sudu  Bandi,"
"succeeded  to  the  land  and  the  Grants  marked  A4  and  A5  were"
"issued in her favour."
"In  terms  of  section  48A(2),  Sudu  Bandi  could  not  alienate  or"
"nominate  a  successor  to  the  land  and  could  only  possess  it"
"during her lifetime.  Therefore, in terms of section 48A(3), Sudu"
"Bandi’s  nomination  of  the  Petitioner  as  her  successor  to  the"
"land, by A6 and A7, is invalid.  Learned President’s Counsel for"
"the Petitioner concedes this position."
"Sudu  Bandi  died  on  04.04.2004;  thereafter,  the  Petitioner,  as"
"the  nominated  successor  of  the  Permit  holder,  Heen  Banda,"
"succeeded  to the land by operation of  the law  – vide  section 49"
"of the Land Development Ordinance."
"Disputes had arisen among the siblings regarding possession of"
"the  land.    It  appears  the  1st  Respondent  Divisional  Secretary  of"
"Ampara  tried  to  settle  the  disputes  but  to  no  avail.    Thereafter"
