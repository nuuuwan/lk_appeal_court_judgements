"Section 110(3) clearly demarcates the legitimate use of the contents of"
"a statement whilst protecting the interests of an accused. The Section reads;"
"""  A  statement made  by  any  person  to  a police  officer  in  the"
"course  of any  investigation  may  be  used  in  accordance  with"
"the  provisions  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  excep t  for 
the"
"purpose  of corroborating 
the 
testimony  of such  person 
in"
"court;"
"Provided  that  a statement made  by an  accused  person  in  the"
"course of any investigation shall only be used  to  prove  that he"
"made a different statement at a different time."
"Anything in  this  subsection  shall  not  be  deemed  to  apply  to"
"any  statement falling  within  the  provisions  of section  27 of"
"the  Evidence  Ordinance or  to prevent any statement made  by"
"a  person 
in 
the  course  of any  investigation  being  used  as"
"evidence in a charge under section  180 of the  Penal Code."
"The scope of the provisions of Section 110 was extensively dealt with"
"by  a  divisional  bench  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Rupasinghe  v  Attorney"
"General (1986)  2 Sri  L.R.  329. It was contended before their Lordships  that"
"during  the  investigations  the  investigators  have  acted  in violation  of  the"
"provisions  of Section 110  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  as  they  fail  to"
"to  accept  his 
recognise  the  appellants  ""right  to  silence""  and  also  failed"
"""exculpatory statement""."
