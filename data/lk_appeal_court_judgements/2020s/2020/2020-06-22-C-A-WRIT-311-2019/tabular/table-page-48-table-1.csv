"It has already been decided that the Petitioner must prima facie  satisfy"
"this Court, upon the material he had pleaded, that the 6th Respondent took"
"the  decision 
to  prosecute  him  ""dishonesty  or mala fides  or  an  exceptional"
"circumstance""."
"The indirect submission on illegality and procedural impropriety 
in"
"respect of Section 12A(4)(a)  of  the Judicature  Act had  already  been  dealt"
"with by this Court in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment. The other"
"complaint the  Petitioner  relied  on  is  the  denial  of an  opportunity  for  the"
"Petitioner  to  make a  revealing  statement by  which  he  intends  to  provide"
"valuable  information  to  incriminate  his  co  accused  and  also  to  extricate"
"himself of criminal liability."
"The contention advanced by  the Petitioner and the 14th  Respondent"
"is  that he was ordered  to  make a statement on or before  26.06.2019 by the"
"Magistrate's  Court but even before  that time  period  was  fully  exhausted,"
"the  6th  Respondent had proceeded  with filing of an indictment before  the"
"Permanent High Court at Bar. 
It is  alleged that the CID,  on their part also"
"had  acted 
illegally  when  they 
filed  a  report under Section 120(3)  of the"
"Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.1S  of  1979,  confirming  the  terminal"
"point  of  their  investigation  against  the  Petitioner  and  others  before  the"
"expiration of the time period mentioned in the Court order."
"It is  obvious that the said contention 
is based upon the premise that"
"provisions contained in Section 120(3)  of the Criminal  Procedure Code are"
"mandatory  in  nature  and  therefore  imposes  an  inviolable  prerequisite  in"
