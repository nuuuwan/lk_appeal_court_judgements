"the commission of offences  are heavily regulated by statutorily laid down"
"procedure.  The  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.  15  of  1979,  which"
"replaced  the  Administration of Justice  Law  No. 42  of 1973,  has  regulated"
"criminal  proceedings 
in  Sri  Lanka  for  well  over  four  decades  with  a"
"substantial collection  of judicial interpretations  on its  permissible 
scope."
"The number of local authorities cited in this judgment itself is a  testimony"
"of  that feature  and 
also  is  a  confirmation  that  the  statutory  provisions"
"contained therein have adequately protected the interest of the suspects as"
"well as the accused."
