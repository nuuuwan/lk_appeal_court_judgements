"","Medical  Reports of the  Petitioner from  the prison  authorities on  16th  January 2020."
"10.","According to  the  Medical  Reports submitted, Petitioner has undergone surgery in  the year 2013  to"
"","remove  a  tumor  in  the  bladder.  No  Medical  Reports  for  the  period  between  2013  and  2018  have"
"","been  submitted.  Which  means,  Petitioner has  failed  to  submit any  Medical  Reports  for  any of his"
"","illnesses  for  the  period  between  year  2013  and  2018  when  he  was  on  bail  pending  trial.  After"
"","conviction,  he  has  undergone  investigation  procedures for  a  comp laint of hematoma.  He  had  been"
"","seen  by  the  consultant  Urological  surgeon .  Petitioner's  complaint  is  being  investigated  by

"","could  not  be 
treated  at 
the  prison  hospital  or  any  other  government  hospital.  Consultant"
"","Urological  Surgeon  Dr.  Dimantha de  Silva  has  recommended  few  more  investigating  procedures"
"","and that the Petitioner should not get exposed to smoke as it  increases the  risk of recurrence of his"
"","earlier sickness that he  was treated.  Medical  Report does  not  recommend or state that  Petitioner's"
"","health  would  be  at  risk  in  prison.  There  is  no  evidence before  this  court to  the effect that  there  is"
"","more  smoke 
inside 
the  prison 
than  outside.  Thus, 
the  Petitioner's  complaint  of  ill  health 
is"
"","insufficient to constitute 'exceptional circumstances'  even at this stage."
"II.","The ground, that there  would  be  an  inordinate delay  in  hearing the  appeal,  also  was  urged  by  the"
"","Petitioner 
to  be 
considered 
as  an 
exceptional 
circumstance.  Petitioner  was  convicted  and"
"","In 
default  of  payment  of  fine 
and 
sentenced 
to

for  5  years  on
