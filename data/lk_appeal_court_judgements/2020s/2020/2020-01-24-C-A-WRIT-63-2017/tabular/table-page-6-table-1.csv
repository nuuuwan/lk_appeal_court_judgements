"Cheshire  and  North,  Private  International  Law,  13th  Ed.,  pages  579-582  explains"
"different formulations by which the overriding effect of an  Act may be ascertained"
"as  a matter of statutory construction :"
"(1) The Act may expressly provide that it is  to have complete overriding effect."
"An  example of such  an  English  Act is  the Employment Rights Act 1996 which"
"in  section  204(1)  states  that  for  the  purposes  of  the  Act  it  is 
immaterial"
"whether the law governing the contract is  the law of the  part of the United"
"Kingdom or not."
"(2) The  Act expressly provides that it is to have limited overring effect."
"The  Unfair Contracts Terms Act  1977 is  an  example of an  English  Act  which"
"by its own terms makes clear that it has only limited overriding effect."
"(3) The Act expressly provides that it is to have  no overriding effect."
"(4) The Act has  no express  provision on  its overriding effect but has  a provision"
"on  its territorial scope."
"Where 
the  Act  has  provision  dealing  with 
its 
territorial  scope  without"
"specifying  expressly  whether  it  is 
intended  to  have  overriding  effect,  an"
"inference of its overriding effect can  be  more easily drawn."
"(5) The  Act has  no express  provision as  to its overriding effect and  no  provision"
"on  its territorial scope."
"In  this situation as  well,  it is  a matter of statutory construction to ascertain"
"whether it has  an  overriding  effect although  this  exercise  is  difficult in  the"
"absence of any indication on  its territorial scope ."
