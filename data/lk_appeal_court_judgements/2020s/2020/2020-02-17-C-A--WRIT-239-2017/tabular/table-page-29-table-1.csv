"The  above reasoning can  thus be summarized as follows :",""
"a)","The 
threshold  for  judicial  intervention  set  by  Wednesbury 
is  extremely"
"","high . The  threshold  in  GCHQ, being  intrinsically linked to Wednesbury  has"
"","a similarly high threshold;"
"b)","The 
test 
laid  down 
in  Tameside  appears 
to  be  more 
realistic,  and"
"","balanced,  as 
it acknowledges  conduct  which  no  sensible  authority  acting"
"","with  due appreciation  of its  responsibilities would  have  decided  to adopt,"
"","as  being unreasonable;"
"c)","It is  the duty of Courts to consider whether a decision is  reasonable  in  the"
"","light of the facts and  circumstances of each case ."
"","This  Court  is  of the  view  that  Courts  must  take  a  more  realistic  approach  in"
"fulfilling","its 
function  of  probing 
the  quality  of  decisions  and  ensuring  that"
"","assertions made  by public authorities are properly substantiated and justified."
"","This Court shall  now conside r the decision of t he Army Selection  Board  marked"
"","'RIg'  in  the  light  of the  above  judicial  reasoning  in  order to  determine  if the"
"","said  decision had  been arrived at,  after a con sideration of all  relevant material."
"","Even  though  the  Army Selection  Board  had  arrived  at the  conclusion  that the"
"","Petitioner  had  a poor  disciplinary  record  and  that his  past  performances  have"
"","been  mediocre,  'RIg'  does  not  contain  reasons  that  prompted  the  Board  to"
"","arrive  at the  said  conclusion . In  the  absence  of any  further  elaboration  in  the"
"","Statement  of Objections  filed  before  this  Court,  it  is  clear  that  the  Board  has"
"not  considered  each  of","the 
incidents 
referred 
to  earlier,  nor  have 
they"
