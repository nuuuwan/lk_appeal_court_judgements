it  is  settled 
law  that  in  considering  the  validity  of  the  exercise  of"
"discretionary  power, 
the  Court  will  consider  whether  the  power  has  been"
"properly used, or abused . In  other words, the question for the Court is  whether"

"a. 
Misdirected himself;"
"b. 
Failed to take relevant considerations into account;"
"Failed to exclude irrelevant considerations. 
c."
