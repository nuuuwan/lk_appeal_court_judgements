"even  where the  decision  is  within  the  purported  ""four corners  of the  law"" but"
"do  not  satisfy  the  threshold  of  reasonableness  due  to  a  failure  to  consider"
"relevant material."
"If a decision  has  been  influenced  by  considerations  which  either  expressly  or"
"implicitly  cannot  lawfully  be  taken  into  account,  a  Court  may  hold  that  such"
"discretionary  power  has  not  been  exercised  validly. 
In  doing  so,  Courts  can"
"consider  to  what  degree  the  decision  maker  has  been 
influenced  by  such"
"considerations and,  in  order to determine the degree of influence,  Courts  may"
"be  guided  by 
the 
reasons  provided  by 
the  decision  maker.  The 
reasons"
"provided  for  a decision  would  therefore  allow  Courts  to  effectively  scrutinize"
"the  decision  and  detect what factors  have  influenced  the  decision  maker. The"
"absence  of reasons  would  also  support an  argument that  the  decision  maker"
"has  not afforded a fair hearing, which  requires all  relevant material to be  taken"
"into  consideration  prior 
to  arriving  at  a  decision. 
In  De  Smith's  Judicial"
"Review27 
it is  observed  that 'Irrationolity may also  sometimes be inferred from"
"the  absence  of reasons.28  When  reasons  are  required,  either by statute  or  by"
"the  growing  common  law  requirements,  or  where 
they  are  provided,  even"
"though  not  strictly  required, 
those  reasons  must  be  both  ""adequate  and"
"intelligible"".  They  must therefore  both  rationally  relate  to  the  evidence  in  the"
"cose29
,  and be comprehensible in  themselves.'"
"Thus, 
it  is  evident  that  the  principle  that  a  decision  maker  must  take 
into"
"into  consideration 
consideration  all 
relevant  material  and  should  not  take"
