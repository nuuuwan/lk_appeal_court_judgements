"'R19',  it is  clear to this Court that there  has  not been  a proper consideration of"
"all 
relevant  material. 
It 
is 
therefore  the  view  of  this  Court  that  a  decision"
"reached 
in 
such 
circumstances 
is  not  only  a  decision  which  no  sensible"
"responsibilities  would  have 
authority  acting  with  due  appreciation  of  its"
"decided to  adopt but is  also  a decision which  is  so outrageous in  its defiance of"
"logic  or of accepted moral standards  that no sensible  person  who  had applied"
"to  be  decided  could  have  arrived  at.  This  Court  is 
his  mind  to  the  question"
"55  Supra."
"S6 Supra. The  Peti tioner in  fact  states that he was  awarded  the Rana Sura Padakkama on  three occasions."
