"that  had","the  Board  considered  each 
incident  carefully, 
the  following  would"
"have been evident :",""
"(a)","The 
six 
incidents 
referred 
to  above  have 
taken  place 
prior 
to 
the"
"","Petitioner being appointed as  a Temporary Colonel  in 2011 ;"
"(b)","None of the said  incidents led to the Petitioner being summoned  before a"
"","the  Petitioner  has  not  been 
Summary  Trial  or  a  Court  Martial,  and"
"","subjected  to  any  punishment  as  provided  for in  Section  133  of the Army"
"","ActÂ· 54"
"(c)","The  maximum sanction  imposed  on the  Petitioner has  only been  a severe"
"","warning."
"","The  Board  has  not considered  the fact that the  Petitioner had  been  appointed"
"as  a  Temporary  Colonel","in  2011, 
in  spite  of  the  warnings 
issued 
to

"","Petitioner, and that three years  after being appointed  as  a Temporary Colonel,"
"","in  March  2014,  the  Petitioner  had  been  confirmed  in  the  rank  of Colonel.  As"

is 
that

"","criteria  that  should  be  followed  when  an  appointment is  made  to  the  rank  of"
"","Brigadier.  While this Court will  not subscribe to the view that a fresh  appraisal"
"of  all  previous","incidents  should  not  be  carried  out  when  considering 
the"
"","promotion  of  the  Petitioner  to  the  rank  of  Brigadier,  given  the  fact  that the"
"criteria","is 
identical,  this  Court 
is  of  the  view  that  the  Board  ought  to  have"
