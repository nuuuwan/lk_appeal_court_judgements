"Thus,  it  is  evident that with the existing circumstances at the  time of the offence"
"committed, it could not have been possible to  carry out investigations."
"Further, in King V. Ebert Silva (50 NLR 457), it was held that,"
"""The caution 
that a man 
should never be 
convicted  of  murder or"
"body 
of 
manslaughter on 
circumstantial  evidence  alone  unless 
the"
"the deceased person  has  been  found 
need  not,  however,  be 
followed"
"when very  strong  circumstantial  evidence  of death 
can 
be  given."""
"Therefore, 
it  cannot  be  concluded  that  there  had  been  no  crime  taken  place"
"mere ly  on 
the 
fact 
that  no 
recovery  of  bodies  or  on 
the  ground  of  non"
"availability of post mortem reports to confirm the cause of deaths."
"2)  The 2nd  ground of appeal  is  that the eye witness who was presented to  the"
"court was lacking credibility and reliability. The witness has stated that he"
"and Lafeer escaped from the place. But, Lafeer had reached the village on"
"the  same  day  whereas  the  eyewitness  Jamaldeen  had  reached  only  after"
"05  days.  Furthermore, 
the  Appellant  has  submitted 
that 
the  only  eye"
"witness Jamaldeen has  not convincingly proved that he  was  in  the jungle"
"for  five  days only by drinking water."
"The Learned High Court Judge has stated that the Appellant has  not been able to"
"mark  any 
contradiction 
in 
the 
testimony  of  the  witness.  The  eyewitness"
"Iamaldeen  has  stated  that he  saw  the  deceased  being  brutally  assaulted  by  the"
"accused and the others, and they were buried in the pits that were dug by them."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  made 
the  following  observation  in 
this"
"regard."
