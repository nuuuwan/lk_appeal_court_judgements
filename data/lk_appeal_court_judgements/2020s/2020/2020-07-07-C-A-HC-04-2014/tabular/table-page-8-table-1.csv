"S.I Kingsly Fernando and S.I  Baithulla of Trincomalee police was  acting"
"with a mala fide ulterior motive."
"The  5th  ground  is  the  questionable  role  played  by  S.I  Baithullah.  He  has  stated"
"that  both  the  accused  were  known  to  him  from  small  days  and  it states  that  S.I"
"Baithulla  had  a personal  interest  and  an  ulterior  motive  in  implicating  both  the"
"accused."
"The  7th  ground  is  S.I Baithulla's dismal  career record. It has  been  stated that S.I"
"Baithullah  gave  evidence  in  High  Court  on  19.07.2000  and  he  was  not  been"
"serving  in  the  police  department  by  that  time.  Furthermore,  it  has  been  stated"
"that  misconduct, 
dishonesty 
and 
in-disciplinary 
conduct, 
including 
acting"
"without  authority,  may 
have 
been 
the 
reason 
for  Baithulla's  disgraceful"
"dismissal.  Hence 
the  Appellant  has  come 
to  a  conclusion 
that  Baithulla's"
"evidence  and  his  mode  of investigation are  tainted and  malicious  and  therefore"
"ought not to be taken  into consideration in arriving at a decision in this case."
"On  the  contrary, the appellant has  not  made  any complaint to  a higher authority"
"about any  misconduct  or illegality taken place during the  investigations.  Hence"
"it 
is  not  fair 
to  raise  the  objections  now,  as 
to  the  roles  played  by  the  Sub"
"Inspectors and investigations."
"4)  4th and 6th  grounds of appeal:-"
"The  Appellant  states  that  the 
identification  parade  was  held  on  22.09.1992,"
"almost after 2 years  of the  incident and  hence  it has  raised many  questions  and"
"casted  a  doubt  as  to  whether  it  was  legal  to  accept  an  identification  after  that"
"long  interval of two years.  Furthermore  it  has  been stated by the  Appellant that"
"S.L Baithullah has made an undue influence to the identification parade."
"The written submissions on behalf of the Appellant has stated as  follows:"
""" .... SI Baithulla  is  the  highest ranking police officer present in  the parade.  In"
"this scenario,  Sf Baithulla who  earlier arrested the accused himself, had every"
"opportunity  of directing,  misdirecting and or  influencing the  course  of justice."
"He  had every  opportunity  of secretly pointing  to  the  witnesses  the  exact  spot"
