"Hence it  is  evident that  the  law  which was Jelevant when the  offence  had  been"
"committed  under Regulation 24  (1)  of the  Emergency  Regulations  and  thereby"
"it  is  apparent that the preliminary objection taken by the appellant should reject."
"Following grounds  of appeal  were  urged  by  the  Counsel  for  the  Appellant"
"in  his written su bmissions:-"
"1)  Lack of sufficient proof on the fact that deaths actually occurred."
"2)  The  purported  eye  witness  presented 
to 
court 
lacks 
credibility  and"
"reliability ."
"3)  Clandestine 
role  played  by  sub-inspectors  of  police;  namely  Kingsly"
"Fernando and Baithullah"
"4)  Identification parade held two years after the alleged incident."
"5)  Questionable role played by S.I. Baithullah"
"6)  Identifcation Parade flawed by the Participation of S.I Baithullah"
"7)  S.I. Baithullah's dismal career record."
"1)  I  wish 
to  consider  the  1 st  ground  of  appeal  mentioned 
in 
the  written"
"submission  on  behalf of the  Appellant.  The Appellant states  that there  is"
"no  sufficient  proof as  to  prove  that  the  deaths  actually  occurred  due  to"
"following reasons;"
"a)  None of the bodies were ever recovered."
"b)  No  cause  of  death  could  be 
ascertained  eg:  whether  caused  by  of"
"firearms,  gunshots etc. or fatal  blows/assault."
"c)  Non availability of post mortem reports to  confirm the cause of deaths."
"d)  No credible evidence to establish deaths."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  addressed  this  fact
