"decision-making body."
"As Tucker L.J. expounded in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk [(1949) 1 All E.R. 109 at 117]:"
"""There  are,  in  my  view,  no  words  which  are  of  universal  application  to  every  kind  of"
"inquiry  and kind  of domestic tribunal. the requirements of natural justice must depend"
"on  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  the  nature  of  the  inquiry,  the  rules  under  which  the"
"tribunal is acting, the subject-matter that is being dealt with, and so forth. Accordingly, I"
"do  not  derive  much  assistance  from  the  definitions  of  natural  justice  which  have  been"
"from  time  to  time  used,  but,  whatever  standard  is  adopted,  one  essential  is  that  the"
"person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity to present his case."""
