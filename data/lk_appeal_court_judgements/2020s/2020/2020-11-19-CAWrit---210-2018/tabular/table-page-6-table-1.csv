his position has been encapsulated in the following manner in Administrative Law"
"by Wade and Forsyth:3"
"“The  doctrine  that  powers  must  be  exercised  reasonably  has  to  be  reconciled"
"with the no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion"
"of the public authority....."
"D

"decision  is  within  the  confines  of  reasonableness,  it  is  no  part  of  the  court’s"
"function to look further into its merits.”"

"“The  question  of  the  appropriate  measure  of  deference,  respect,  restraint,"
"latitude or discretionary area  of judgment (to use  some  of the terms variously"
"employed)  which  Courts  should  grant  the  primary  decision  maker  under  this"
"head of review is one of the most complex in all of public law and goes to the"
"heart of the principle of the separation of powers. This is because there is often"
"a fine line between assessment of the merits of the decision (evaluation of fact"
"and policy) and the assessment of whether the principles of “just administrative"
"action”  have  been  met.  The  former  questions  are  normally  matters  for  the"
"primary  decision-maker,  but  the  latter  are  within  the  appropriate  capacity  of"
"the courts to decide.”"

"to reject the classification submitted by the Petitioner and the decision of Sri Lanka"
"Customs  to  classify  Psorolin  under  HS  Code  Classification  No.  34.01.11.90,  is  legal,"
"rational and reasonable."
