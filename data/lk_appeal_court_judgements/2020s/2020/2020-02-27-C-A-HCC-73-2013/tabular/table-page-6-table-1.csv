"16.  PW 12  was  a  Police  Officer  who  was  attached  to 
the  Kandy  hospital  police  post.  He  has"
"testified  in  court about the dying declaration the deceased made to  him  in  hospital.  He  was an"
"independent witness  who  had  no  connection  to  the  deceased  or to  the  Appellant.  Although,"
"PWI2 was  cross examined  by  the  defence  at  the  trial,  his  evidence  on  the  dying declaration"
"that was made to  him by the deceased was never challenged by the defence."
"17.  Although  the  hair  of the  deceased  was  not  burnt,  from  her  face  up  to  the  legs  were  severely"
"burnt according to  the  medical evidence adduced in  the court."
"18. 
In  the  above  premise,  the  learned  High  Court Judge  was entitled  to  act  upon  the  three  dying"
"declarations  made  by the  deceased to  three  different persons on three different occasions that"
"the  Appellant  poured  kerosene  oil  on  the  deceased  and  set  fire 
to  her. 
I  see  no  reason  to"
"interfere  with  the judgment of the  learned  High Court Judge and  the  grounds of appeal  urged"
"by the  Appellant should necessarily fail."
"Conviction  and  the  sentence  imposed  on  the  Appellant  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  is"
"affirmed."
"Appeal  is  dismissed."
