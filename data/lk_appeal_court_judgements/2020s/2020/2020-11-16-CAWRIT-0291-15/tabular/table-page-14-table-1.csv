"C.G.  Weeramantry  in  “Tread  Lightly  on  the  Earth,  Religion,  The  Environment  and  the  Human"
"Future”  [Stamford  Publication,  2014]  cites  various  religious  texts  to  emphasis  that  several"
"religions speak of the need to protect the environment and follow sustainable development. He"
"states (at page 228) “trusteeship of the universe is recognized in Islam and any violation of it by"
"man  is  accountable  and  subject  to  punishment  as  the  Qur’an  states  “It  is  He  who  made  you"
"trustees  of  the  earth…Indeed  your  Lord’s  retribution  is  swift,  yet  He  is  forgiving  and  kind"
"(6:165).”"
"As  Rousseau  wrote  in  Emile,  “forgetfulness  of  all  religions  leads  to  the  forgetfulness  of  the"
"duties of man.” [Rousseau, Jean Jacques, Emile: or On Education, 1762, Book 4, p. 929]"
"Before parting with the judgment, I reiterate that without any doubt there is a need to settle"
"down  all  IDPs  who  were  displaced  due  to  the  war  in  Sri  Lanka  as  far  as  possible  in  the  areas"
"where they were residing. However this is subject to other overriding concerns and above all"
"the  respect  for the  rule  of  law  which  is  the  foundation  of  our  Constitution.  The  conclusions  I"
"have made and the relief granted is based on the finding that the re-settlement of the IDPs in"
"this case has been made contrary to law."
"Application partly allowed."
