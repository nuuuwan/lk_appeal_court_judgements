"However  there 
is  no  documentary  evidence  before  Court  to  substantiate  this  assertion."
"Accordingly on 31.07.2019 the Court enquired from the learned Senior State Counsel whether"
"the land forming the subject matter of this application was used for the re-settlement based on"
"any  recommendation  made  by  this  Committee  or  the  Task  Force.  Having  moved  for  time  to"
"obtain  instructions,  he  was  unable  to  provide  the  clarification  sought by Court.  Instead  Court"
"was  informed,  by  motion  dated  22.11.2019  that,  inter  alia,  steps  will  be  taken  to  rescind  the"
"order P4 and a new order made excluding the land used for the settlement of the IDPs and that"
"if  further  re-settlements  are  necessary  every  effort  will  be  made  to  relocate  IDPs  outside"
"reserved forest."
"In  any  event  the  “Report  of  the  Inter  Agency  Committee  on  Land  Related  Issues  among  the"
"Muslim  Families  Internally  Displaced  in  the  Year  1990  (Mannar  District)”  is  dated  15.10.2012"
"(1R3) whereas the land forming the subject matter of this application became reserved forest"
"with effect from 20.10.2012."
"Hence  on  the  evidence before  Court  neither the  Task  Force  nor  the  Committee  appointed  by"
"the Task Force played any role in identifying and releasing the land forming the subject matter"
"of this application for re-settlement of IDPs after it was declared as a reserved forest."
"However  there  is  evidence  that  it  was  the  7th  Respondent  Mr.  Rishad  Badiudeen,  Minister  of"
"Industry  and  Commerce  who  was 
instrumental 
in  getting  this 
land  released 
for  the  re-"
"settlement  of  IDPs.  On  15.01.2013  a  meeting  was  held  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  7th"
"Respondent  with  the  participation  of  the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Sustainable"
"Energy,  Director  General  of  Forest  Conservation  and  his  officers  and  a  decision  was  made  to"
"release  several 
lands  for  the  re-settlement  of 
IDPs  (P7).  Deplorably  the  then  Conservator"
"General of Forest K.G. Ariyadasa compliantly took part in the meeting and signed P7 containing"
"the decision to release the reserved forest land."
"Such a release of reserved forest land for re-settlement of IDPs could have been done only if"
"there  had  been  an  order  made  by  the  Minister 
in  terms  of  section  4(2)  of  the  Forest"
"Conservation Ordinance declaring that the land in dispute is no longer reserved forest. No such"
"order has been made."
