"The learned Senior State Counsel raised an objection that a writ of mandamus cannot be issued"
"since  the  1st  Respondent  has  been  named  by  office.  He  cited  the  decision  of  this  Court  in"
"Indrakumara  v.  Land  Reform  Commission  [C.A.  (Writ) 271/2013,  C.A.M. 15.10.2019].  It  is  true"
"that  when  this  application  was  filed  the  1st  Respondent  was  cited  by  reference  to  his  official"
"designation. However, on 10.11.2017 the Petitioner filed an amended caption and brought in"
"Anura  Satharasinghe,  Conservator  General  as  the  1st  Respondent.  Therefore  this  objection  is"
"overruled."
"A further objection was raised by the learned Senior State Counsel that this Court is denuded of"
"any  power  to  grant  relief  as  the  identical  matter  was  urged  before  the  Supreme  Court  in"
"S.C.F.R. No. 130/2017 where leave to proceed was refused."
"This  Court  has  had  the benefit of  perusing  the pleadings  filed  in  S.C.F.R.  130/2017  since  they"
"have been filed of record in this application. I observe that the Petitioner in this case was not a"
"party to that application. Hence the doctrines of res judicata or issue estoppel do not apply as in"
"both instances it is necessary that the parties to the two cases and the cause of action (or issue"
"estoppel  as  in  this  case)  must  be  the  same  for  the  two  doctrines  to  apply.  [Ran  Menika  v."
"Gunasena and Another [C.A. 471/2000(F), C.A.M. 23.09.2019]."
"In any event, it is trite law that the rights of the parties must be decided as at the date of the"
"institution  of  the  proceedings  or  action  [Ponnammah  v.  Arumugam  (8  N.L.R.  223),  Sithy"
"Makeena and Others v. Kuraisha and Others (2006) 2 Sri.L.R. 341]. This application was filed and"
"notice issued in 2015 whereas the fundamental rights application S.C.F.R. 130/2017 was filed in"
"2017.  Hence  the  outcome  of  the  fundamental  rights  application  cannot  be  held  against  the"
"Petitioner in this application."
"It  was  further  contended  by  the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  that  this  application  is  futile  in"
"that the re-settlement has been completed and that no meaningful purpose can be achieved by"
"this application. I have no hesitation in overruling this objection."
