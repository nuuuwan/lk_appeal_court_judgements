"","This indicates that the 2nd  Appellant had retained the witness's passport as"
"","a  security and  thereby compelling him to  give  evidence  on his behalf.  This fact"
"seriously  challenges  the  truthfulness  of  the  witness's  claim  of  seeing  the  eye",""
"","witness at some distance away from the scene, a position that had been advanced"
"","belatedly. Thus, in the circumstances it is evident that the trial Court's decision to"
"","reject  the  defence  witness's  claim  was  based  on  the  reasonable  inferences  that"
"had been","reached upon the available evidence and  therefore is  amply justified."
"Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails.",""
