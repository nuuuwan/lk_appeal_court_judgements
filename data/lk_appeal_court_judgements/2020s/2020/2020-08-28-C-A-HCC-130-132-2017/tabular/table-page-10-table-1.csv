"daughter of the 1st  Appellant and there had been an exchange of words between"
"the  two  sides 
just before  the 
incident.  There was  no  challenge  to  that item  of"
"evidence of the witness by any of the Appellants."
"In considering the evidence the  trial Court had  arrived at the finding that"
"the  Appellants  had  entertained  an  intention  only 
to  cause  injury  which 
is"
"sufficient  to  cause  death  in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature,  in  spite  of  the  clear"
"medical  evidence  that 
it  is  a  necessarily  fatal  injury  and  thereby  had  reduced"
"their  culpability  from  murder  to  culpable  homicide  not amounting  to  murder."
"Clearly 
the trial Court had not utilised the said item of hearsay evidence elicited"
"through the witness by the Appellant themselves  to  impose criminal liability on"
"them."
"The  complaint  that  the  trial  Court had  shifted  burden on the  Appellants"
"when 
it  observed 
is  established  against 
the 
that  when  a  prima 
facie  case"
"Appellants, in the absence of an explanation it could  draw an inference of guilt,"
"should be considered by this Court now."
"In the impugned judgment the relevant portion where the Court had held"
"so, appears as follows;"
