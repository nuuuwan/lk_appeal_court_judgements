"The  Petitioner  states  that  it obtained  from  the  3rd  Respondent,  a copy  of the"
"proceedings  of  the  said 
inquiry  conducted  on  14th  August  2012,  which  has"
"been annexed to the petition marked 'P32' ."
"The complaint of the Petitioner to this Court is two fold ."
"The  first  complaint,  which  is  borne  out  by  the  proceedings  'P32',  is  that  the"
"Inquiry  Officer  proceeded  on 
the  assumption 
that  the  6th  Respondent  had"
"allocated  a  separate  assessment  number  for  the  said 
retail  shop,  which  the"
"Petitioner  claim  is  erroneous. The  6t h  Respondent  has  in  fact  very  specifically"
"submitted  in  its  written submissions that a separate  assessment  number -
i.e."
"No. 68 -
has  not been  allocated  to the said  retail  shop.  Thus,  it is  clear to this"
"Court that the Inquiry Officer has  made a fundamental error when considering"
"the complaint of the Petitioner and  has  acted  on  material which  had  not been"
"su bstantiated ."
"What is  significant however is  the second  complaint of the Petitioner, which  is"
"that 'P29' does not contain  any reasons for the decision of the 3rd  Respondent."
"This  Court  has  re-produced  in  its entirety, the decision  of the 3rd  Respondent,"
""
"which,  as  submitted  by  the  learned  Counsel  for the  Petitioner,  does  not give 
Website Copy"
"the Petitioner the reasons  as  to why the Inquiry Officer decided to dismiss the"
"complaint of the Petitioner."
