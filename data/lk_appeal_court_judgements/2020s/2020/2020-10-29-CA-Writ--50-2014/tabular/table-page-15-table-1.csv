"Respondent has correctly taken up the position that this objection should have been"
"taken  up  at  the  first  available  opportunity,  and  that  by  his  failure  to  do  so,  the"
"Petitioner has acquiesced with the application of Samarakkara."
"I
 am  of  the  view that whether the  application is  out of  time is  a mixed  question  of"
"fact and law which should have been raised before the 1st Respondent and the Board"
"of  Review,  thus  affording  the  parties  an  opportunity  of  clarifying  matters.  No"
"explanation has been offered by the Petitioner as to his failure to do so."
"I
 must state that the application of Samarakkara has not been made available to this"
"Court,  nor  was  it  available  at  the  time  Samarakkara  gave  evidence  before  the  1st"
"Respondent.  Samarakkara  had  been  cross  examined  in  detail  by  the  Counsel  who"
"appeared for the Petitioner at the inquiry before the 1st Respondent relating to the"
"application  made  by  him.21  However,  not  a  single  question  has  been  asked  from"
"Samarakkara  relating  to  the  date  of  his  application,  nor  has  any  suggestion  been"
"made to him that his application is outside the time period in Section 9."
"H
ow did this issue with regard to the date of the application then arise? In its Order"
"dated 21st December 2006, the 1st Respondent has stated that File No. CH/O/978 had"
"been  opened  on  27th  June  1973.22  That  does  not  mean  that  the  application  of"
"Samarakkara has  been made  on that date. The Board  of  Review, in  its  Order dated"
"21st  January  2014  has  stated  that  Samarakkara  made  his  application  on  23rd  May"
"1973.23  This  appears  to  be  the  only  reference  to  the  date  of  the  application  of"
"Samarakkara."
"A
s  I  have  observed,  the  application  of  Samarakkara  was  not  available  even  at  the"
"inquiry, it was not put in issue by the Petitioner, and therefore, I am not in a position"
"to  ascertain  the  basis  for  this  statement  by  the  Board  of  Review,  nor  am  I  in  a"
"position to conclude  that the  application  of Samarakkara  is outside  the  four month"
"period set out in Section 9."
