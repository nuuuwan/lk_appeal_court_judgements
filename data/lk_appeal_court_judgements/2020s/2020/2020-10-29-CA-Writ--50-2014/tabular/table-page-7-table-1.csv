Such individual shall ‘simultaneously intimate in writing to the tenant, if any, of"
"each house the ownership of which such individual or body does not propose to"
"retain, that the ownership of such house is not proposed to be retained.’"
"I
  must  note  at  this  stage  that  even  though  Section  8(2)  required  Agnes  Fonseka  or"
"her  husband  to  simultaneously  intimate  in  writing  to  the  tenant  of  each  house  the"
"ownership of which they did not propose to retain, of such fact, there is nothing to"
"indicate  that  such  notice  was 
in  fact  given  to  the  tenant  of  No.11,  16th  Lane,"
"Kollupitiya."
"T
he purpose of giving notice to the tenant that the owner does not wish to retain the"
"house of which he/she is the tenant is to enable the tenant of such house to act in"
"terms of Section 9 of the CHP Law, which reads as follows:"
"“The tenant of a surplus house or any person who may succeed under section 36"
"of the Rent Act to the tenancy of such house may, within four months from the"
"date of commencement of this Law, apply to the Commissioner for the purchase"
"of such house.”"
"It is admitted that Agnes Fonseka had rented out one of the houses situated on the"
"said premises to T. Wijeyesingham, while the other house comprising of three rooms"
"had  been  rented  to  Somapala  Samarakkara.8  Although  this  Court  has  not  been"
"apprised  of  the  reasons,  it  is  admitted  that  the  application  of  T.  Wijeyesingham  to"
"purchase  the  house  had  been  refused  by  the  1st  Respondent,  and  that  he  had"
"vacated the house after the appeal to the Board of Review was rejected in 1978. The"
"other  tenant,  Somapala  Samarakkara  had  also  made  an  application 
to 
the  1st"
"Respondent in terms of Section 9 of the Act seeking to purchase the said house. It is"
"the application of Samarakkara that has given rise to this application."
"S
ection 10 of the CHP Law sets out the steps that a person may take in respect of the"
"houses which are in excess of the permitted number of houses, and is re-produced"
"below:"
"8 See proceedings of 12th February 2004 at page 365 of ‘P2’ and proceedings of 9th December 2003 at page 373"
"of ‘P2’, for a description of the house occupied by Samarakkara."
