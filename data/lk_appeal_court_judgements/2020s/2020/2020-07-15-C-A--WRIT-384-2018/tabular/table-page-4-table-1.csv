"The  Petitioners  are  employees  of  the  Excise  Department.    The"
"dispute  pertaining  to  this  application  relates  to  their  transfers."
"The annual transfers of the Excise Department had been initially"
"done  according  to  the  scheme  of  transfers  marked  P19.    This"
"scheme  of 
transfers  was 
first 
replaced  by  P22  and  P23;"
"thereafter,  by  P33  and  P34. 
  At 
the 
time  material 
to 
this"
"application,  the  schemes  P33  and  P34  were  in  force,  the  latter"
"being 
applicable 
to 
Excise 
Chief 
Inspectors 
and 
Excise"
"Inspectors,  and  the  former  to  other  Excise  employees.    By  P38"
"and P39, the transfers relevant to this dispute were given effect"
"to be operative from 01.01.2019.  The Petitioners have filed this"
"application seeking to quash by certiorari P38 and P39, together"
"with  the  attachments  marked  P38(a)  and  P39(a),  on  the  basis"
"the  said  decisions  are  a  nullity.    Let  me  now  consider  why  the"
"Petitioners say so."
"It 
is  common  ground 
the 
transfers  of  Public  Officers  are"
"governed  by  the  procedural  Rules  made  by  the  Public  Service"
"Commission, 
published 
in 
the 
Gazette 
Extraordinary"
"No.1589/30  dated  20.02.2009  marked  P18(a).  In  terms  of  Rule"
"194,  a  Public  Officer  can  be  transferred  only  by  the  Public"
"Service  Commission  or  by  an  Authority  with  Delegated  Power."
"Insofar  as  the  Excise  Department  is  concerned,  the  said  power"
"has been delegated by the Public Service Commission to the 1st"
"Respondent Commissioner General of Excise."
