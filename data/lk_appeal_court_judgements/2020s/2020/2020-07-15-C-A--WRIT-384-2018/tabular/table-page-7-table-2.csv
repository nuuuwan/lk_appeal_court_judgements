"officer, under this Chapter or under any other law."
"I  must  emphasise  that  an  ouster  clause  –  be  it  statutory  or"
"constitutional – which takes away the rights of a citizen to come"
"before  Court  against  wrongful  administrative  decisions  shall  be"
"liberally interpreted in order to protect such rights and not deny"

"Article 61A can be invoked only when a decision has been taken"
"by  the  Public  Service  Commission  or  by  a  Committee/Public"
"Officer to whom the Public Service Commission has delegated its"
"power.  In the facts and circumstances of this case, Article 61A"
"has  no  application,  as 
the  Petitioners  are  challenging 
the"
"decision  taken  by  a  Committee  which  had  no  power  or  duty  to"
"take  such  a  decision. 
  The  said  decision 
is  ultra  vires  and"
"therefore a nullity.  A decision which is a nullity cannot be given"
"validity by ratification by the Public Service Commission or any"
"other authority for that matter.  Simply stated, if the decision is"
"a nullity, there is nothing to ratify or approve.  Hence Article 61A"
"does  not  arise 
for 
consideration.
