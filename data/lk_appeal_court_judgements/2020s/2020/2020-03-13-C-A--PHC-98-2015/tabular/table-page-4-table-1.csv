"The main grounds of appeal are as  follows;"
"a) 
has  the  learned High Court Judge erred in  law by  failing  to  decide the party"
"which has established possession over the matter in  dispute."
"b)  has  the  learned High Court Judge failed  to  appreciate that an  application for"
"the 
instance  of  showing  exeptional 
revision  will  be Â· allowed  only  at"
"circumstances by  the party invoking jurisdiction."
"The contention of the Appellant is  that, he  was  in  possession of the disputed"
"premises  at 
the 
time  of  dispute. 
""Section  68  requires 
the  judge 
to  make  a"
"declaration 
as 
to  who 
is 
entitled 
to 
possession.  He 
should 
first  make  a"
"determination  as  to  who  was  in  possession  on  the  date  of the  notice.  Magistrate"
"should evaluate  the  evidence"".  (David Appultamy  vs.  Yassi  Thero  (1987)  1 SLR"
"253)"
"Section 68 (1) of the Act states;"
"""Where the  dispute  relates  to  the possession of any land or part thereof it shall be"
"the  duty  of the judge of the  Primary  Court  holding the  inquiry  to  determine  as  to"
"who  was  in  possession  of the 
land  or  the  part  on  the  date  of the  filing  of the"
"information under Section  66 and make order as  to  who  is entitled to possession of"
"such land or pqrt thereof"""
