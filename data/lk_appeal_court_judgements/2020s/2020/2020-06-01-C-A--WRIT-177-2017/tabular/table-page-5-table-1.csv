"The  Petitioner  submitted  that  according  to  the  insurance  policy,  disputes  in  re lation  to  the"
"breach of contract should  be  referred to Court and  disputes in  relation to the quantum of claim"
"should  be  referred to arbitration. Indeed  clause  18 of the fire insurance policy (P2) states that if"
"any difference  arises  as  to the amount of any  loss  or damage  such  difference  must be  referred"
"to the  decision  of an  arbitrator.  It further  provides  that the  award  of the  arbitrator shall  be  a"
"condition precedent to any right of action or suit upon the policy."
"Yet  the dispute  between the  parties  in  this  case  is  not the  amount of any  loss  or damage. The"
"contention of the  Petitioner is  that the  alleged  loss  does  not fall  within the scope of the impact"
"damage  cover  provided  under the  fire  insurance  policy  (P13).  In  any  event,  parties  cannot  by"
"agreement oust the jurisdiction vested  in  a statutory body or person  by the legislature."
