"The  Petitioner  states  that  in  terms  of the  section  31  B (1)  of the  Industrial  Disputes  Act,"
"either a workman himself or a trade  union for and  on  behalf of the workman could  make a"
"valid  complaint  to  the  Labour  Tribunal.  For  a  trade  union  to  make  a  complaint  to  the"
"Tribunal  such  is 
limited  to the  employee  seeking  relief being  a  member of the  said  union."
"Thus, the  Petitioner states that it is  clear that even  under section  31  B (1)  of the  Industrial"
"Disputes Act only a Trade union and  not anyone else can  make an application ."
"In  the instant application, the  Petitioner states that the  learned counsel  for the 1st and  2nd"
"Respondents  sought 
to  argue 
that  the  3rd  Respondent  and  other  employees  made  a"
"complaint on  7th September 2009 (P2)  upon which the inquiry was commenced and  carried"
"out by the  1st and  or 2nd  Respondents.  It is  reiterated  that the  Petitioner had  no  notice  of"
"P2  until such  time it applied and  obtained certified copies  of the  part of the inquiry records"
"from  the  2nd  Respondent  subsequent  to  the  Petitioner  receiving  notice  on  enforcement"
"proceedings in the Magistrate Courts of Galle."
"It  is  also  the  position  of  the  Petitioner  that  a  bare  perusal  of the  purported  complaint"
"marked  P2  would  sufficiently  demonstrate  that  it  was  a  complaint  made  only  by  the  3rd"
"Respondent for himself and  for the other employees with a schedule  of the  details of such"
"other  employees  attached 
thereto.  There  were  not  even 
the  signatures  of  the  other"
"employees.  Consequently, 
there  were  no  separate  complaints  made  by  each  of  the"
"aggrieved  employee when the 1st and  2nd  Respondent wrongly without authority assumed"
"competence jurisdiction inquiring into the said  purported complaint marked P2 ."
"In  view  of the aforesaid  the  Petitioner argued  that the  said  complaint marked  P2  does  not"
"constitute  a complaint  within the  purview of section  6  B (1)  of the  TEWA  and  thus  inquiry"
"claimed  have to have  been  carried out on  such  complaint and  determination made thereon"
"is  void  ab 
initio. 
It 
is 
further  submitted 
that 
the  Petitioner  by 
letter  sent 
to 
the  1st"
"Respondent  which  forms  part of the  pleadings  due  to  same  being  annexed  to the  Petition"
"marked  P8,  categorically stated that the purported  complaints  by  the  employees,  were  not"
"in  compliance  with  the  required  legal  procedure  and  were  time  barred.  Thus,  the  learned"
"Counsel for the 1st and  2nd  Respondent's pOSition  that the  Petitioner failed to take  up  such"
"objection in the Petition is  misconceived if not wrong."
"The  Petitioner also states that the 1st and  2nd  Respondents have  in paragraph  11 (i)  of their"
"Objections  unequivocally  conceded  that  the  3rd  Respondent  and  other  employees  made"
"complaints to the 1st Respondent by way of affidavits only on  28.2.2010 which being almost"
"after  nine 
(09)  months 
from 
the  alleged 
termination  of  the  employment  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent  and  the other employees. Therefore,  the  Petitioner states  that  it  is  clear  from"
"the  said  admission  of  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondent 
that 
there  was  a  patent 
lack  of"
