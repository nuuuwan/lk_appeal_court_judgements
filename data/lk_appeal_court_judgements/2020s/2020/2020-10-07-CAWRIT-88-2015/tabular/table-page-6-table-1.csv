"over.    I  hold  that  the  discharge  of  the  1st  Respondent  was"
"ultra vires."
"This  Judgment  is  often  quoted  to  say  the  Commander  has  no"
"authority  to  discharge  a  serviceman  under  the  clause  “services"
"no  longer  required”  if  a  punishment  for  the  same  offence  had"
"already  been  given,  as 
it 
is  against 
the  doctrine  of  double"
"jeopardy."
"However, there are decisions  handed  down by this  Court which"
"have 
taken 
the 
opposite 
view.  For 
instance, 
in  Mangala"
"Pushpakumara 
v. 
Air 
Chief  Marshal 
Roshan  Gunathilake"
"Anil 
(CA/WRIT/448/2009, 
CA 
Minutes 
of 
28.03.2012),"
"Gunaratne  J.  held 
that 
such  discharge  under 
the 
clause"
"“services  no  longer  required” 
is  not  made  as  a  punishment."

"Commodore (CA Minutes of 11.09.2017), Dehideniya J. held that"
"such discharge is not a punishment  but only an administrative"

  According 
to 
this 
line  of  decisions,  after 
the 
initial"
"punishment,  discharging 
the 
serviceman  under 
the 
clause"
"“services no longer required” does not amount to violation of the"
"doctrine 
of  double 
jeopardy. 
  Against

"Weerakoon  (SC/SPL/LA/234/2017,  SC  Minutes  of  05.09.2019)"
"refused  special  leave  to  appeal.    When  special  leave  is  refused,"
