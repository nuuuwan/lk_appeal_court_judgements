"“While 
it 
is  disappointing 
to 
realize 
that  my 
judgment  was"
"erroneous, I welcome the opportunity now given me to employ the"
"language  of  Baron  Bramwell  in  a  similar  situation:  “The  matter"
"does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me"
"before.”    This  has  been  quoted  by  many  Judges  in  the  past,"
"including Wimalachandra J. in Palitha  v. Monetary Board of the"
"Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  [2012]  1  Sri  LR  199  and  Bank  of"
"to  accept 
Ceylon  v.  Warnakulasuriya 
[2007]  1  Sri  LR  33,"
