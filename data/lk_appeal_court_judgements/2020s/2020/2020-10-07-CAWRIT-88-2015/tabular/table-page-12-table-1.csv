"A  person  in  whom  is  vested  a  discretion  must  exercise  his"
"discretion  upon  reasonable  grounds.  A  discretion  does  not"
"empower  a  man  to  do  what  he  likes  merely  because  he  is"
"minded  to do so  – he  must  in  the exercise of his discretion"
"do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he"
"must,  by  the  use  of  his  reason,  ascertain  and  follow  the"
"course which reason directs. He must act reasonably."
