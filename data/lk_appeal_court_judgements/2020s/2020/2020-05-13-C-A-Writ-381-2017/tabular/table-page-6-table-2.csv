"In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. and Others v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd. [(1987) 1 Sri.L.R. 5]"
"it was held:"
"""To justify the dissolution of an injunction the suppression or misrepresentation should"
"be  of  ""such  a  character  as  to  present  to  court  a  case  which  was  likely  to  procure  the"
"injunction but which was in fact different from the case which really existed"""
"Thus,  a  misstatement  of  the  true  facts  by  the  plaintiff  which  put  an  entirely  different"
"complexion  on  the  case  as  presented  by  him  when  the  injunction  was  applied  for  ex"
"parte would amount to a misrepresentation or suppression of material facts warranting"
"its dissolution without going into the merits"". (Emphasis added)"
