"""The  petitioner's  application  is  beset  with  other  difficulties  as  well.  The  petitioner  has"
"made  W.  L.  P.  de  Mel,  Commissioner of Labour,  the  respondent to  his  application.  It  is"
"common ground that he has  now ceased  to hold this post and  is  presently the Secretary,"
"Ministry of Trade.  The  petitioner has  not sought to  substitute the  present  holder of the"
"office.  A Mandamus can  only issue  against  a natural  person,  who  holds a public office.  If"
"such  a  person  fails  to  perform  a  duty  after  he  has  been  ordered  by  Court,  he  can  be"
"punished for contempt of Court. (See,  Haniffa v.  The  Chairman,  U.  C.  Nawalapitiya, 66 NLR"
"48).  Before this Court issues a Mandamus, it must be satisfied that the respondent will"
"in  fact  be able to comply with the order and that in  the event of non-compliance,  the"
"Court  is  in a position to enforce obedience to its order.  Mandamus will  not, in  general,"
"issue  to  compel  a re sponde nt to  do what is  imposs ible  in  law or in  fact.  Thus,  it will  not"
"issue  ...............  to  require one  who  is  functus officio to do what he was  formally obliged"
"to do."" (de Smith, r d Edn.  581). So  it see ms to me, that even if th e petitioner's application"
"succeeded, the iss ue of a Mandamus would  be  futile.""  (emphasis added)"
