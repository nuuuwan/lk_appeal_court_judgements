"was  ""there"".  Later  he  learnt  that  the  deceased's  body  was  recovered  from  the"
"river."
"Witness  Sunil  knew  both  Appellants  as  sand  miners  and  claimed  that  it"
"was he who  trained  the 1st  Appellant to  mine sand from  river bed,  although he"
"had left his employer subsequently. The 2nd Appellant met him one morning and"
"pleaded with the witness to save  him by paying Rs.  5000.00 as he had killed the"
"deceased  and  put him  to  the  river. 
Sunil  informed  the  2nd  Appellant's  former"
"employer Wimalasiri  Mudalali  of  the confession  immediately  and,  on the latter's"
"suggestion,  inspected  the  scene  for  tell-tale  marks.  At  that  point of  time  both"
"Appellants were employed under the witness."
"Sunil  suspected  this confession could be a joke and had questioned  the 1st"
"Appellant  whether 
this 
is 
true.  By 
this 
time  Wimalasiri  and  Devendra  have"
"informed  Hanwella  Police about the murder.  The Police  took  the 
three of them"
"along the river bank but found no trace of the deceased."
"The Police  arrested  the 1st  Appellant and  when questioned  admitted  that"
"the deceased was killed and put to the river.  The 2nd  Appellant was also arrested"
"thereafter who confessed in the presence of the 1st  Appellant of his complicity."
"and  another  had  identified  the  body  of  the  deceased  at 
Later  Devendra"
"Ragama  Hospital."
"Wimalasiri  in his evidence confirmed that Sunil told him that 2nd  Appellant"
"confessed to  the murder at Devendra's sand depot. It was not unusual for a sand"
"miner to seek employment elsewhere if the river is swollen and the witness  did"
"not take notice that deceased did not report to work. Then he learned from  Sunil"
"as to the  fate of the deceased."
