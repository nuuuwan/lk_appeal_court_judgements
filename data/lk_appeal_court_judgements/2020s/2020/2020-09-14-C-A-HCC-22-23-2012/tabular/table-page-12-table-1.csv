"himself,  which 
is 
a 
probable  conduct  of 
a 
person, 
if  placed  under 
the"
"circumstances  as 
the  witness  was  placed  at  that  point  of  time.  The  fact 
that"
"witness  relocated  himself  after  the  incident  is  confirmed  by  Sunil  who  located"
"him after several days to convey that the Police wanted to question him."
"Referring to  the tenor of cross-examination,  the trial Court considered  the"
"suggestion put to  witness Sunil and rightly concluded  that the confessions were"
"not  disputed  by 
the  1st  Appellant,  except  denying  making 
it.  There 
is  no"
"lsi  Appellant  over  making 
the 
contradiction  or  an  omission  marked  by  the"
"confession on the witness's evidence indicating that it was mentioned on the first"
"available opportunity and thereafter consistently made by the witness. When the"
"witness denied the suggestion that due to  prior animosity the lsi  Appellant was"
"implicated, he did not probe any further by suggesting other instances where he"
"had acted with such animosity."
"The contradiction 1 VI is in relation to the eye witness's claim that it was he"
"who  spoke 
to 
the 
two  Appellants  when  seated 
together  with  the  deceased,"
"whereas he told Police that he could not identify the Appellants, until they who"
"shouted at him"" Cl)£j!;  CJ®Cl)i"".  Clearly this was due to the limitation of the witness"
"to  express himself describing what took  place.  He merely  said  in evidence  that"
"the  three  were  there.  Only  during  cross-examination,  it  was  elicited  how  he"
"identified them clearly."
"As  to  the  omission  marked  in  relation  to  the  utterance  attributed  to  the"
"deceased, it was elicited  by the lsi  Appellant that he made a  statement to Police"
"the  Magistrate's  Court.  The  omission  was 
as  well  as  gave  evidence  before"
"marked only in relation to his testimony before the Magistrate's Court, justifying"
"an inference that the witness did mention it in his statement to Police, which was"
"12"
