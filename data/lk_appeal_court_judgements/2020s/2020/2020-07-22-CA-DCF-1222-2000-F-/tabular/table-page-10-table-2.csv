"to the instant action, section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance requires at least one attesting witness"
"to be  called  for the purpose of proving the execution  of the document in  question before  using"
"the said  document as  evidence  and  the  plaintiff has  led  the evidence  of one  attesting witness,"
"who is  also  a brother of the Donor,  who  has  stated that Kandiah  Arulanandam  signed  'P4' in  his"

"that  although  Section  68  speaks  of at  least  one  attesting  witness  being  called,  as  a  matter of"
"precaution,  however, 
it  is  better  to  call  all 
the  attesting  witnesses.  The  object  of  requiring"
"attestation  by  more  than  one  witness  is  to  guard  against  the  difficulties  arising  out  of death,"
"unavailability, absence from jurisdiction and  other causes.  If one witness is called and he speaks"
"to attestation, the document is prima facie proved. But it is open to the other side to rebut the"
"proof by evidence that the apparent attestor is  not an  attestor in the legal  sense.  Where only"
"one  of the  attesting  witnesses  is  called  and  his  evidence  is  not  believed,  the  provisions  of"
"section  68  would  not  have  been  complied  with. The  evidence  of an  attesting  witness  is  not"
"necessarily conclusive and can  be rebutted. [Emphasis added]"
"In  view of the above,  it is  safe to conclude that 'P4'  is  prima facie  proved  in  terms of section  68"
"of the Evidence Ordinance and  'P4'  and  its contents can  be used  in  evidence."
"the  defendant  contends 
that  the  execution  of  'P4'  was  not  the  act  of  Kandiah

"Arulanandam and his signature was forged. In such  a situation, the burden is on  him to prove that"
"the execution of 'P4' is tainted with fraud  [Dr.  ourgadas De Fonseka v.  Vasanthi Gunathil/ake (C.A."
"326/1997; C.A.M. 05.12.2019)] and  rebut the evidence led  by the plaintiff."
"However,  the  defendant  has  failed  to produce  any  cogent  evidence  before the  Court  to  prove"
"these allegations. The  defendant has  not given  evidence and  the only evidence led to show that"
"'P4'  was  fraudulently  executed  is  the testimony of Kandiah  Parimalarajah,  who  has  only stated"
