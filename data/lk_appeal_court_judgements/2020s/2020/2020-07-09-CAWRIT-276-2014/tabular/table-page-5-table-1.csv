"W
hat does the 4th Respondent say in turn?  Compensation was"
"predominantly  decided  on  the  valuation  of  the 
land  by  the"
"Government 
Chief 
Valuer. 
 
The 
4th 
Respondent’s  main"
"contentions are the valuation by the Government Chief Valuer is"
"excessively  high,  the  findings/observations  of  the  Presidential"
"Investigation  Unit  highlight 
the 
suspicious  nature 
of 
the"
"valuations, and the Petitioner’s claim to ownership of the land is"
"dubious  or  uncertain. 
  Defences  of 
this  nature  are 
totally"
"irrelevant in deciding the straightforward case presented by the"
"Petitioner.    The  matters  raised  by  the  4th  Respondent  shall  be"
"sorted out by the 4th Respondent with the Chief Valuer and the"
"1st and/or 2nd Respondents.  The Petitioner cannot and shall not"
"be  made  to  suffer  for  disputes  among  other  parties.    The  4th"
"Respondent’s defence is absolutely devoid of merit."
"Moreover, no relief has been sought against the 4th Respondent"
"because  the  land  was  acquired  by  the  subject  Minister  and  the"
"award  under  section  17  of  the  Act  was  made  by  the  Divisional"
"Secretary. 
  The  Petitioner  has  nothing 
to  do  with 
the  4th"
"Respondent."
"Once  the  award  under  section  17  is  made,  section  29  becomes"
"operative.  According to section 29, the acquiring officer, in this"
"case  the  2nd  Respondent,  shall  pay  the  compensation  awarded"
"under  section  17  to  the  relevant  claimants,  subject  to  a  final"
"decision by way of appeal to the Board of Review or the Court of"
"Appeal.  There has been no such appeal in this case."
"It  is  well  settled  law  that  mandamus  lies  to  compel  a  statutory"
"duty, which the Petitioner in this application has a legal right to"
"demand."
