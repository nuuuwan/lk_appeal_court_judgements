"In 
letter  dated  27.08.2016  (P8/R1),  the  2nd  Respondent  states  that  the  available  material"
"establishes that there was an employer-employee relationship between the Petitioner and 4th"
"Respondent  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act.  In  terms  of  section  47  of  the  Act,  “employee”"
"includes any apprentice or learner who is paid a remuneration. Accordingly, the payment of a"
"remuneration 
is  an  essential  condition  to  the  existence  of  an  employer-employee  relation"
"within  the  meaning  of  the  Act.  When  the  2nd  Respondent  held  that  there  was  an  employer-"
"employee  relationship  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  4th  Respondent  within  the  meaning  of"
"the  Act,  it  necessarily  means  that  consideration  was  given  to  the  issue  of  whether  the  4th"
"Respondent was paid in respect of his “employment” and an affirmative finding made."
"This conclusion is supported by evidence led at the inquiry. In terms of section 47 of the Act,"
"“earnings”  means  inter  alia  wages,  salary  or  fees.  The  contribution  that  must  be  made  under"
"the Act as EPF according to the section 10 of the Act is based on “earnings”."
"The pay slips of the Petitioner marked X14 and X15 and annexed to the written submissions of"
"the  4th  Respondent  made  before  the  Labour  Department  shows  that  the  4th  Respondent  was"
"paid a salary. The salary slip X15 also shows that no EPF was paid by the Petitioner with regard"
"to the 4th Respondent’s salary. Documents annexed to the Petitioner’s written submissions (P6)"
"marked  X16(a)  to  X16(e)  made  before  the  Labour  Department  show  that  the  4th  Respondent"
"was paid a salary by the Petitioner."
"The true grievance of the Petitioner appears to be that there was an agreement between the 4th"
"Respondent  and  the  Petitioner  that  the  4th  Respondent  would  not  be  paid  EPF  (X10  &  P5)."
"However, the Supreme Court in Blanka Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd v. Van Els [(2004) 3 Sri.L.R. 314] held"
"that there can be no waiver of contribution by agreement between employer and employee as"
"section  16(1)  of  the  Act  provides  that  “the  employer  of  every  employee  to  whom  this  Act"
"applies  shall, 
inrespect  of  each  month  during  which  such  employee 
is  employed  by  such"
"employer, be liable to pay in respect of such employee, to the fund, on or before the last day of"
"the succeeding month, a contribution of an amount equal to 3 per centum of the total earnings"
"of such employee from his employment under such employer during that month”."
"The  principle  was  followed  by this  Court  in  Ceylon  Agro  Industries  Limited  v.  Employees  Trust"
"Fund [C.A. (PHC) 40/2003; C.A.M. 26.02.2016]. Therefore, I have no hesitation in rejecting the"
"submissions  of  the  Petitioner  that  the  4th  Respondent 
is  bound  by  the  terms  of  the  said"
"agreement."
