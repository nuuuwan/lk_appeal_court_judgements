"In  this  case,  the  Petitioner  did  not  resort to  any  legal  remedies prior to the  institution  of  this"
"application. The first communication after the receipt of P8 is letter dated 05.01.2017 [P12(a)]"
"by  which  a  request  was  made  for  certified  copies  of  the  inquiry  proceedings.  The  minute"
"thereon marked P12(a) indicates that the Personal Manager Noel Fernando was informed that"
"the  request  can  be  granted  only  upon  a  court  order.  This  was  conveyed  to  the  Petitioner’s"
"lawyer. It is only after the Petitioner received summons to be present in the Magistrate’s Court"
"on  27.07.2019  was  this  application  filed.  I  hold  that  there  has  been  an  undue  delay  in  the"
"circumstance of the case."
"For all the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed without costs."
