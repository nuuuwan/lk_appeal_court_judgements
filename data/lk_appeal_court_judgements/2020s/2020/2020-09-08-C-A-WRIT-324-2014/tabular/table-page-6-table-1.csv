"The  1st 
to  3rd  Respondents  contended 
that 
the  Petitioner 
is  not"
"entitled  to  any  relief  in  seeking  a  prerogative  Writ,  as 
the  facts  are  at"
"variance in relation to  the claim of possession between the Petitioner and"
"the 5th Respondent. They also contend that the application of the Petitioner"
"is futile as a  permit had already been granted to the 5th  Respondent and he"
"seeks to nullify a  permit that had been issued earlier to  the one marked as"
"5R2, on which the 5th  Respondent claims his rights over the disputed land."
"It is also the submission of the 5th  Respondent that the Petitioner never was"
"in  possession  of  the  said  portion  of  State  land  and 
the  documentation"
"clearly  establish 
that 
the 
former  was 
in  possession 
long  before 
the"
"Petitioner first disputed his possession."
