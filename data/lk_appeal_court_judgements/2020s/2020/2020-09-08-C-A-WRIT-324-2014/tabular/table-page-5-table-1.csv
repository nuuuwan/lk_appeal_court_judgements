"District Court of Matugama, in seeking a  declaration of his title to  the said"
"land and to evict the Petitioner therefrom."
"The  1st 
to  3rd  Respondents, 
in 
their  objections  stated 
that  the  5th"
"Respondent made a written request for a permit in respect of Lot No. 34 on"
"22.05.2006.  Upon 
recommendation 
of 
the 
3rd 
Respondent, 
the 
5th"
"Respondent  had  granted  a  permit  under  Section  19(2)  of 
the  Land"
"Development Ordinance, (marked as 3R4) in  favour of the 5th  Respondent"
"on 08.07.2013, as directed by the 1st  Respondent."
"In 
their 
respective  objections, 
the  Respondents  have  collectively"
"sought the dismissal of the petition of the Petitioner."
"The 
Petitioner, 
in 
his 
counter 
affidavit, 
claims 
that 
the 
5th"
"Respondent was only shown boundaries in January 2011,  referring to  the"
"plan 5R1 and reiterated his position as stated in the amended petition."
"When 
the  Petitioner's  application  was  taken  up  for  hearing, 
the"
"invited 
this  Court 
to  pronounce 
its 
judgment  on 
the  written 
parties"
"submissions they have already tendered."
"The  Petitioner, 
in  his  submissions  contended 
that  he  was  made"
"aware of the issuance of the permit to the 5th  Respondent (referring to P2),"
"only when the boundaries were shown to him on 20. 01.2011,  when in fact"
"there  was a  direction by  the 3rd  Respondent to  the Grama  Niladhari  not to"
"proceed  with  the  demarcation of boundaries on the  said  land,  in  view  of"
"the  pending inquiry  into  the Petitioner's complaint. 
It is  therefore stated"
"that since it was the Petitioner who developed the land, he is entitled to the"
"permit and not the 5th  Respondent."
