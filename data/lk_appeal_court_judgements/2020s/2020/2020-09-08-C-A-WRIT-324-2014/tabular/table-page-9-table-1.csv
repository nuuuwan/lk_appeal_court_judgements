"had recommended  the 5th  Respondent's application for a  permit in respect"
"of 
the  said 
land  on  05.06.1995,  more 
than  fourteen  years  before 
the"
"Petitioner even raised his claim of  any development activity on it."
"Even 
if 
there 
is  any  development

"Petitioner, his interest over it is  remedied by his  own cross claim made to"
"in seeking compensation for
