"""Learned  President's  Counsel  finally  contended  that  even  though"
"the  impugned evidence  did not amount  to  a confession,  and even if"
"it  could  not  reasonably  have  been  so  considered  by  the  jury,  there"
"was nevertheless a possibility that the jury might have  thought that"
"the  Appellant  had  made  a confessional  statement,  and  that  it was"
"therefore  the  duty of the learned High  Court Judge  to  direct  the jury"
"that it was not a confession."""
