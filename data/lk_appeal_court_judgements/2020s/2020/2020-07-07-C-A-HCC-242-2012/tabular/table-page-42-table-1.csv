"The  un-contradicted  evidence  of  the  prosecution  that  the  Appellant  had"
"knowledge  of an easy  way to  take  out the  concealed  Heroin from  the stainless"
"steel  pipes without drilling  into  them is  a  factor  sufficient to  draw  the positive"
"inference that he did possess the requisite knowledge as envisaged in the offence"
"of  importation  of  a  dangerous  drug.  His  bare  denial  of  any  knowledge,  as"
"admitted  by  the  Appellant,  is  advanced  only  during  the  very  late  stage  of  his"
"evidence for the first time."
