"Remaining grounds  of appeal  that  had  been raised  by  the Appellant had"
"one  common  underlying  element.  All  of 
these  grounds  are  based  on 
the"
"proposition  that  the  prosecution  had  failed 
to  prove  the  identity  of  the  item"
"imported 
into  Sri  Lanka.  The  concerns  expressed  by  the  learned  President's"
"Counsel  on 
the 
inconsistency  as 
to 
the  number  of  days 
the  officers  have"
"attempted 
to 
trace 
the  pounding  machine  among 
the  other  consignments"
"received by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority,  the inconsistency as to  the exact date"
"on which the Appellant had presented himself at the Customs, the inconsistency"
"in the  description of the machine as spoken to  by the prosecution witnesses and"
"also as to  the vessel in which it had arrived, whether it was mounted on a palette"
"or in a  crate and  the inconsistency  as  to  the  reference number of investigations"
"have 
this  common  denominator  and  had  a  bearing  on 
the 
issue  of 
the"
"identification of the imported item."
