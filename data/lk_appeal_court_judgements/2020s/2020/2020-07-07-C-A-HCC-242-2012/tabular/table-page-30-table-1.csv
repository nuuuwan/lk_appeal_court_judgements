"""The  Customs  Ordinance

"severe  penalties  on

its  provisions.  The  Crown"
"must 
therefore  establish  any  breach  of  those  provisions  beyond"
"reasonable  doubt as  in  a criminal  prosecution.  The  onus  of  proving"
"that the gold bars  were imported being on  the  Crown  it should have"
"established  that fact  beyond reasonable  doubt.  It has failed  to  do  so."
"The  onus  proving  lawful  importation  does  not  therefore  lie  on

"It is  trite  law  that  in  a  criminal  prosecution,  the  burden  of  proving  its"
"allegation lies squarely on the  prosecution and both the actus 
reus  and mens  rea"
"of the alleged  offence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, except for very"

"Ordinance as amended consists of both physical and mental elements."
"In these offences,  the mental element consists of  the accused's knowledge"
"of  the  criminalised  act,  he  is  accused  of  and  engaged  in.  The  nature  of  the"
"requisite  knowledge  of  the offences  of illegal  trafficking in and  possession  of a"
