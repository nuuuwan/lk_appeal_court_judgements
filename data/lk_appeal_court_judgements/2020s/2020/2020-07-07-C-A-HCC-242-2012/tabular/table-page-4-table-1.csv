"","In delivering  the  impugned judgment on 14.06.2012,  the High Court had"
"","found  the  Appellant guilty  only  to  the 1st  and 3rd  counts.  The  2nd  accused  was"
"","acquitted from the 2nd and 3rd  counts. The Appellant too was acquitted of the 2nd"
"","count. 
The  Appellant  was  sentenced  to  death  upon  conviction  on both  these"
"","counts."
"","Being aggrieved  by  his  conviction and sentence,  the  Appellant  preferred"
"","an appeal and at the hearing, learned President's Counsel who represented him"
"","had presented submissions on the broader and general ground of appeal that he"
"","was deprived of a fair  trial.  As  the learned President's Counsel proceeded along"
"","with his submission, he had itemised several factors  upon which he founded his"
"","ground of appeal. In support of these factors, it was contended that;"
"","a . 
the trial Court had failed  to  properly consider the relative probabilities"
"","of the version of events as presented by the prosecution,"
"","b . 
the  trial  Court  had  failed 
to  properly  consider  the  inconsistent  and"
"","contradictory evidence of the prosecution in determining its credibility."
"","Learned President's  Counsel,  in elaborating the  grounds of appeal  based"
"","on  the  probability  of  the  prosecution  version  of  events,  posed 
the  question"
"","whether  it  is  more  probable  for 
the  Appellant,  if  he  knew  that  Heroin  was"
"","concealed  in the  machine, to  abscond  rather than to  present himself voluntarily"
"","at the  Customs  to  complete the  clearance procedure and thereupon  to  face  the"
"","consequences.  He also contended  that the trial  Court had failed  to  consider the"
"","said  probability  of 
the  prosecution  version, 
in 
the 
light  of 
the  Appellant's"
"","assertion that it was not the machine he had imported from the Indian supplier."
