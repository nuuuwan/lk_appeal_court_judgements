"obviously  indicate  two  contradictory  time  periods,  and  therefore  whether  the"
"prosecution had failed to prove its allegation of importation, at the very outset of"
"this judgment."
"This particular ground of appeal  demands  that this Court determines the"
"issue whether the conclusion reached  by  the  trial  Court was justified  or not,  in"
"view of this particular inconsistency in the light of the prosecution evidence as to"
"the  date  and  time  of  the  importation  of  the  pounding  machine.  In  order  to"
"determine  that  issue,  this  Court  then  must Â· undertake  an  exercise  by  which  it"
"determines,  as far  as  Section 54A of the Poisons,  Opium and  Dangerous  Drugs"
"Ordinance  is  concerned,  what  it  meant  by  the  word  ""import""  and  how  the"
"effective  date  and  time 
of 
importation  should  also  be  determined.  In  other"
"words,  this  Court was  to  provide a  definition  to  the  word  ""import""  in Section"
"54A, which would include as to  when the act of importation is  completed, since"
"the Legislature did not provide one as it did with the two other offences namely"
"""manufacturing"" and ""trafficking in"" of a dangerous drugs."
"The  indictment  alleged 
that  the  Appellant  had 
imported  the  specified"
"quantity  of  Heroin  during  the  time  period  28.04.2004  and  30.04.2004.  It was"
"pointed  out  by  the  learned  President's  Counsel  that  there  is  evidence  of  the"
"prosecution witnesses that, in fact the pounding machine did arrive in Sri Lanka"
"on 17.04.2004 and the information on Heroin was conveyed on 21.04.2004 but the"
"Appellant  presented  himself  to 
the  Customs  only  on  the  28.04.2004.  It was"
"therefore  contended  by 
the 
learned  President's  Counsel 
that 
the  machine"
"containing Heroin was already imported to Sri Lanka on  a date very much prior"
"to the date of alleged importation by the Appellant."
