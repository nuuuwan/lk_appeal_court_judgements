"Section 54A(c)  of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance had"
"made  illegal  import or  export of  any  dangerous  drug as  a  punishable  offence."
"Even though the Legislature defined the words ""traffic"" and ""manufacture"" that"
"constitute distinct offences, it did not however provide any such definition to  the"
"words ""import or export"" contained in the said Section."
"this  Court 
(1995)  2  Sri  L.R.  1, 
In  Attorney  General  v  Kumarasinghe"
"considered  the  question whether a  passenger,  who  possessed  40  gold  pieces  in"
"transit  lounge  of  the  Bandaranaike  International  Airport,  had  ""imported"" 
the"
"them  in  to  Sri  Lanka  without  a  permit, 
in  violation  of  Section  21(1)  of 
the"
"Exchange Control Act.  The said passenger had arrived Sri Lanka from Singapore"
"and was waiting in the transit lounge en  route  to Male.  This Court, having noted"
"that  the  ordinary  meaning  of  ""import"" 
is 
to  ""bring  from  abroad"",  however,"
"adopted  the  definition  provided  for  ""import""  in Section  22  of  the  Imports and"
"Exports  Control  Act  No.  1  of  1969,  where 
it  states 
that  """"import""  with 
its"
"grammatical variations and cognate expressions when used in  relation  to any good means"
"the importing or bringing into Sri Lanka,  or causing to be  bought into Sri  Lanka whether"
"to  rule  that the  appellant  had  in fact  ""imported"" 
by  sea  or  by  air  of such  goods"""
"gold."
"This  judicial  precedent on importation has  no  applicability to  the  instant"
"appeal  since 
it  could  clearly  be  distinguished  on 
two  aspects. 
In  Attorney"
"(ibid), 
the 
concern  was 
that 
the 
appellant  had 
General  v  Kumarasinghe"
"committed a Customs/Revenue offence. Hence the applicability of the definition"
"provided in the Exchange Control  Act.  In this  instance,  however,  the offence of"
"importation  is  created  by  Section  54A(c)  of  the Poisons  Opium and  Dangerous"
"Drugs Ordinance. This Statute states that prohibited dangerous drugs could only"
"be imported  "" ...  in  accordance  with the  provisions of this  Chapter""  or upon a  licence"
