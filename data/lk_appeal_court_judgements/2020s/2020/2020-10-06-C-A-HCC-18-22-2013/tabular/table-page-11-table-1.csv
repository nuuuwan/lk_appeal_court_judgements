the  prosecution  case  has  starved  the  case  of evidence  as

the"
"reasons for  their presence  in  the  locality or to  commit assault within  the"
"meaning of section 342 of the Penal Code.  In  this context,  I hold that  the"
"prosecution  had failed  to  establish  that  there  was  an  unlawful assembly"
"with  the common object of committing assault on Raviwarman within the"
"meaning  of section  342  of the  Penal  Code.  Thus,  counts  1  to  10  of the"
"indictment  must  necessarily fail.  Accordingly,  1 set  aside  the  conviction"
"of the Accused-Appellant on counts  Ito 10.  '"
