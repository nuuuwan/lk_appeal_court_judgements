"22.","In  the Duminda Silva  case, the  common object of the unlawful assembly mentioned"
"","in  the charges was  criminal  intimidation of voters with the use of fire  anns, and  that,"
"","in  prosecution  of  that  common  object 
the  other  offences  were  committed.  The"
"","common  object in  that case was  not,  to  cause  hurt on  the  deceased  or other victims."
"","However,  in  the instant case the common object mentioned in  the charge of unlawful"
"","assembly  is  to  cause  hurt  on  PW I.  Hence  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  prosecution  to"
"","prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the  common  object  of the  unlawful  assembly"
"","was  to  cause hurt  to  PWI.  Therefore,  on  the  issue  of common  object,  the Duminda"
"","Silva case would not be relevant to  this case.  There is  a clear doubt created about the"
"","common object, as  to  whether it  was to  cause hurt on  PWI  or to  disrupt the  meeting"
"","that was to  be  held, when the sequence of events is  taken  into consideration."
