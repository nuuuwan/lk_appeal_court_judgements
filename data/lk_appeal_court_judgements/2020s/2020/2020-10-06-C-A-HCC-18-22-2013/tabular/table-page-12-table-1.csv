"","common 
intention  could  be  formed 
in 
the  spur  of the  moment  without  any  pre"

"28.","It  is 
the  contention  of the 
learned  Presidents  Counsel  for 
the  1 't,  2nd,  3rd  and  51h"
"","appellants  as  well  as  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  41h  appellant  that  in  terms  of the"
"","evidence of PW IS,  none  of the  other appellants shared  a common  intention  with  the"
"","151  appellant.  In  his  unsworn  statement  from  the  dock,  the  151  appellant  denied  his"
"","presence at the scene."
"29.","Although  the  I st  appellant had  denied  his  presence at the crime scene there  is  cogent"
"","evidence  to  prove  not  only  that  the  1 st  appellant  was  present  but  also  that  he  fired"
"","shots  from  a  T56  weapon  from  the  place  where  the  lorry  they  came  was  parked,"
"","towards  the  direction  of Badulla  where  the  deceased  in  count  5  and  the  injured  in"
"","count No.7 had been standing. As I stated  before, it is  evident that it was PWI5 who"
"","ordered  to  stop  the  vehicle.  When  the  appellants  initially  got  down  from  the  lorry,"
"","they  had  been  unarmed  except  for  the  51h  appellant  who  carried  a  bottle.  Although"
"","the  PW  1  had  denied  anyone  pelting  stones  on  the  appellants,  PW15  had  clearly"
"","testified 
that  the  crowd  threw  stones  at 
the  appellants.  He  then  had  seen 
the  1st"
"","appellant  whom  he  pushed  into  the 
lorry  before,  firing  with  a  T56  weapon.  It  is"
"","obvious  that the  1 st  appellant had  used  the weapon that had  been  in  the  lorry.  Hence,"
"","the  rest  of the  appellants  could  not  have  had  the  opportunity  to  share  any  common"
"","intention  of committing  the  acts  of firing  with  the  I st  appellant  even  in  the  spur  of"
"","the moment."
"30.","The learned High Court Judge has relied  solely  on the evidence ofPWl, to  come to"
"","the  conclusion that the  2nd  appellant also  used  a T56  weapon to  shoot at  the  stage or"
"","the  crowd.  PW 1  in  his  evidence  said  that  the  2nd  appellant  also  carried  a  weapon"
"","when he initially came near the stage. However,  if the 2nd  appellant carried a weapon"
"","when  he  came  out  of the  lorry,  PW 15  should  have  seen  it.  It was  the  evidence  of"
"","PW IS 
that  only 
the 
I st 
appellant  used  a  weapon,  and 
that 
is  also  after 
the  1st"
"","appellant  was  pushed 
inside 
the 
lorry  by  him.  Therefore, 
it  was  unsafe  for 
the"
"","learned  High  Court  Judge  to  conclude  that  the  2nd  appellant  also  used  a  weapon"
