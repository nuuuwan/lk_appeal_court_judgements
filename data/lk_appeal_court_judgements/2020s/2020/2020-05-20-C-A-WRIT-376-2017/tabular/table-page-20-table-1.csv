  That  was  the  starting  point  of  this  episode. 
  The"
"appointment  of  Dr.  Senaratne  by 
the  Departmental  Higher"
"Degrees Committee is ultra vires."
"The  Respondents  state 
that 
the  names  of 
the 
five-member"
"committee  appointed  by  the  Faculty  Higher  Degrees  Committee"
"to  re-examine  the  answer  scripts  were  taken  from  R28,  which"
"they  say  has  been  approved  by  the  Senate. 
  However,  even"
"assuming that R28 contains a list of examiners approved by the"
"Senate,  only  two  of  the  five-member  committee  are  included  in"
"R28. 
  Learned  State  Counsel  admits 
it. 
  This  means, 
the"
"majority  of 
the  said  committee  did  not  comprise  examiners"
"approved  by  the  Senate.    Then,  the  decision  taken  by  the  five-"
"member  committee 
to  scrutinise/re-examine/standardise 
the"
"answer scripts/marks is ultra vires."
"It  is  on  these  findings  arrived  at  without  jurisdiction  that  the"
"Dean  reported  to  the  Vice  Chancellor  that  disciplinary  action"
"against the Petitioner could be considered."
"The  Appeal  Board  did  not  look  at  the  issue  from  the  proper"
"perspective. 
  The  Appeal  Board  considered 
the  appeal  at  a"
"superficial  level  and  dismissed  it  paying  scant  attention  to  its"
"merits. The approach adopted is also wrong.  I need not give so"
"many reasons to quash the punishment  of  the  Council and the"
"decision of the Appeal Board."
"If 
the 
first  decision 
of 
the  Departmental  Higher  Degrees"
"Committee  and  Faculty  Higher  Degrees  Committee  to  appoint"
"examiners 
it 
is  a  nullity 
for  all 
intents  and 
is  ultra  vires,"
