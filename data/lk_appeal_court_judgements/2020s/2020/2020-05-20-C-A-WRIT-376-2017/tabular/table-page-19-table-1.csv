"F
aculty Higher Degrees Committee can appoint examiners for re-"
"correction, and hence the course of action adopted is correct.  I"
"am unable to agree."
"Under “Part V-Examinations” of the said Regulations, 5.1 states"
"that 
“Examiners 
for  all  postgraduate 
examinations  will  be"
"recommended by the Departmental HDC through the Faculty HDC"
"to the Faculty Board and shall be approved by the Senate.”"
"It  is  the  position  of  the  Respondents  in  paragraph  11  of  their"
"statement of objections that the Senate approved examiners for"
"the  relevant  year  (2008/2009),  as  evidenced  by  R28,  and  two"
"members  of  the  five-member  panel  of  examiners  were  selected"
"from the said list approved by the Senate."
"However, firstly, there is no indication in R28 that the examiners"
"stated  therein  were  approved  by  the  Senate.    R28  only  goes  to"
"prove that eight names were approved by the Faculty Board, not"
"by  the  Senate. 
  The  Faculty  Board  or  Departmental  Higher"
"Degrees Committee or Faculty Higher Degrees Committee cannot"
"appoint  examiners;  that  shall  be  done  by  the  Senate  on  the"
"recommendation  of  the  Faculty  Board  and  said  Higher  Degrees"
"Committees. Vide, inter alia, section 48(3) of the Universities Act."
"I  will  assume  for  the  time  being  that  the  eight  names  in  R28"
"were  approved  by  the  Senate.    But  what  about  the  original"
"second  examiner  who  played 
the  pivotal  role 
in 
this  whole"
"exercise―Dr.  Samanthi  Senaratne 
of 
the  University  of  Sri"
"Jayewardenepura?    Dr.  Senaratne  was  undoubtedly  appointed"
"by  the  Faculty  Higher  Degrees  Committee  without  the  approval"
"of  the  Senate.    She  technically  re-examined  the  answer  scripts"
