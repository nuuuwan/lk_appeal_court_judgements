"Mahinda Samayawardhena, J."
"The 4th Respondent was appointed as a Distraining Officer/Rate"
"Collector of the 1st  Petitioner  Colombo  Municipal Council  by P2"
"in 1978.  P2 inter alia states the 4th Respondent shall enter into"
"an Agreement  with the  Colombo Municipal Council for a period"
"of  one  year  prior  to  commencing  work.  The  Colombo  Municipal"
"Council  retained  absolute  power  to  terminate  the  Agreement"
"even  within  that  period,  if  the  work  of  the  4th  Respondent  was"
"found 
to  be  unsatisfactory. 
  The  work  assigned 
to 
the  4th"
"Respondent  was  to  collect  municipal  rates  due  to  the  Colombo"

"paid  only  a  commission  on  his  collection;  no  other  salary  or"
"allowances  would  be  paid.

"shows  the  fragile  nature  of  the  job  of  the  4th  Respondent.    The"
"last  Agreement  between  the  parties  had  been 
in  2016,  after"
"which  no  new  Agreement  was  signed.  By  P8, 
the  Colombo"
"Municipal  Council  informed  the  4th  Respondent  of  its  decision"
"not  to  extend  his  “contract  period”  beyond  31.12.2016.    It  is"
"thereafter that the 4th Respondent  for the first time  complained"
"to  the  1st  Respondent  Commissioner  General  of  Labour  by  P9"
