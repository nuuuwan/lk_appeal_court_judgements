"cannot be said to form an employer-employee relationship in the"
"strict 
legal 
sense 
that  would 
attract 
application 
of 
the"
"Employees’ Provident Fund Act."
"In  the  unique  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  take  the"
"view 
that 
the 
relationship  between 
the  Colombo  Municipal"
"Council  and  the  4th  Respondent  was  not 
that  of  employer-"
"employee,  but  the  4th  Respondent  was  only  an 
independent"
"contractor  of  the  Municipal  Council. 
  Hence  the  Employees’"
"Provident Fund Act is inapplicable in this instance."
"In  view  of  the  above  finding,  there  is  no  necessity  for  me  to"
"consider 
the  applicability  of  sub-paragraph 
(c)  of 
the  First"
"Schedule to the Employees’ Provident Fund Regulations of 1958,"
"which,  for  the  present  purposes,  says  “every  employment  other"
"than 
employment  under  any 
local  authority 
(being  a 
local"
"authority in respect of the employees of which a pension scheme"
"or  provident  fund  has  been  established  under  any  other  written"
"law) shall be covered employment”."
"In  view  of  my  observations  made  at 
the  beginning  of 
this"
"Judgment 
in  respect  of  P22,  P26  and  1R6,  the  preliminary"
"objections  taken  up  by  learned  Counsel  for  the  4th  Respondent"
"on  laches  and  the  availability  of  alternative  remedies  are  not"
"entitled to succeed."
"Before I part with this Judgment, let me take the liberty to stress"
"the  following.    Learned  Counsel  for  the  4th  Respondent  relies"
"heavily on two of my earlier Judgments on the same subject, i.e."
"Sri  Lanka  Telecom  PLC  v.  The  Commissioner  General  of  Labour"
"(CA Minutes of 22.11.2019) and  Courtaulds Trading Company  v."
"The Commissioner General of Labour (CA Minutes of 05.03.2019),"
