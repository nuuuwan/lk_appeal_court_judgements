"NLR  178].  One  exception  to  this  general  principle  is  the  ‘no  evidence"
"rule'.”"
"H
aving referred to the above passage from Administrative Law by Wade and"
"Forsyth, this Court went on to state as follows:"
"“The observations made by the text writers about this ground of judicial"
"review  have  been  adopted  and  endorsed  by 
the  Supreme  Court 
in"
"Kiriwanthe v Navaratne [(1990) 2 Sri LR 393 at 409] and in Nalini Ellegala"
"v Poddalagoda [(1999) 1 Sri LR 46 at 52]."
"In Hasseen v Gunasekara and others [CA  Application No. 128/86 C.A.M."
"02.10.1995] this court considered an order of the Rent Board of Review,"
"affirming an order of the Rent Board which had been ""arrived at without"
"an  adequate  evaluation  of  the  evidence  and  by  failing  to  take 
into"
"consideration relevant items of evidence which could have influenced the"
"finding""  and  held  the  Rent  Board  as  well  as  the  Board  of  Review  had"
"""erred in law by failing to take into account relevant items of evidence in"
"arriving  at  the  finding""  and  therefore  quashed  the  orders  of  the  Rent"
"Board as well as of the Board of Review."
"T
herefore,  when  a 
factual  finding  by  an  administrative  body 
is  not"
"supported by the evidence on record, or has been made ignoring relevant"
"and established evidence on record, the court has the ability to exercise"
"judicial review.”"
"H
aving  carefully  considered  the  proceedings  before  the  1st  Respondent,  this"
"Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent has clearly erred when he arrived"
"at the finding that the Petitioner had agreed to the payment of compensation"
"to  the  2nd  Respondent.  In  the  said  circumstances,  this  Court  is  in  agreement"
"with the second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, and is of"
"the  view  that,  that  part  of  the  award 
‘P3’  dealing  with  the  payment  of"
"compensation, is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari."
"presumed that administrative decision makers have all the factual information on hand and are best"
"equipped to make factual determinations."
