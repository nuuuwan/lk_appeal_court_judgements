"The final argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that in any"
"event,  the  award  is  uncertain,  in  that  the  amount  of  compensation  has  not"
"been specified  and  therefore, the  award  is  not capable of  being  given  effect"
"to, or enforced. This Court is of the view that an award must be specific and"
"must be capable of being given effect to, which unfortunately is not the case"
"in this application."
