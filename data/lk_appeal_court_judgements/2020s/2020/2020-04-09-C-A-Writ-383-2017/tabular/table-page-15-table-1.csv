"Urban Council, held as follows:",""
"â€œ","Based  on  the  foregoing  analysis  the  legal  position  with  regard  to  the"
"","application of the doctrine of ultra vires, in this respect, can be stated as"
"","follows.  An  authority  (Corporation)  established  by  statute  such  as  an"
"","Urban Council has, in law, a status, objects, powers, functions and duties,"
"","only as provided in the constituent statute or in any other statute. Beyond"
"","these  it is legally  incapable  of  doing anything. For instance  section 36(b)"
"","vests  public  roads  in  the  Urban Council.  As  contended by  counsel  for the"
"","Respondents, vesting ordinarily connects a transfer of ownership and the"
"","Council should be considered the owner of the road. Notionally, this may"
"","be  correct.  But  vesting,  here,  does  not  mean  that  the  Council  gets  the"
"","rights attaching to ownership  at  common  law in  respect of the road. A"
"","statutory authority endowed with statutory powers, has... no common law"
"","powers  at  all  (Wade,  P.216).  Therefore,  public  roads  are  vested  in  the"
"Urban  Council  so  that","it  will  exercise,  perform  and  discharge  such"
"","powers, functions, and duties as are specified in the Ordinance or in any"
"","other statute, in relation to such roads, and no more. Anything purported"
"","to be done, by the Council, in excess of what is permitted by the statutory"
"","provisions will be considered as wholly invalid in law, on the application of"
"","the  doctrine  of  ultra  vires.  However,  in  construing  the  relevant  statutory"
"","provisions  the  Court  will  bear  in  mind  the  need  to  promote  the  general"
"","legislative  purpose  underlying  these  provisions  and  consider  whether  the"
"impugned  act 
is 
incidental","to  or 
consequential  upon 
the 
express"
