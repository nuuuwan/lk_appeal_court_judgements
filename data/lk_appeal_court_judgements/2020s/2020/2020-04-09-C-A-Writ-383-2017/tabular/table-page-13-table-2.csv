"fact  that  a  Municipal  Council  cannot  lease  out  a  street  is  supported  by  the"
"provisions of Section 50 of the Ordinance, which provides as follows:"
"“Whenever  any  street  or  any  part  of  any  street  vested  in  a  Municipal"
"Council ceases to be used as a street, the Council, with the prior approval"
"of the President, may sell, lease, or exchange such street or part thereof,"
"and in the event of such sale or lease, the proceeds thereof shall be paid"
"into the Municipal Fund.”"
