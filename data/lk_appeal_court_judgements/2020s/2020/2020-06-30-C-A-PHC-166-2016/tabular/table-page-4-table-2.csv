"","imprisonment  of either  description  for  a  term  not 
rupees  and  to"
"","exceeding six months and to  the cancellation of his driving licence."
"07.","Hence,  it  is  clear that  the  sentence  imposed  on  the  Appellant  by  the  learned  Magistrate  is"
"","well within the powers of a Magistrate."
"08.","Appellate Court will  not  interfere into a sentence passed  by a lower Court unless  it  is  illegal"
"","or wrong in  principle. It is  mandatory for the  Magistrate to  cancel the driving  licence  when"
"","an Accused is convicted for an offence in terms of section  ISI(1A) as submitted above."
"09.","The Appellant urged  that there was no  document to  prove that the Appellant used the three"
"","wheeler to  convey  passengers for  a fee.  However, the  Appellant has  already  pleaded  guilty"
"","to  the  charge under section  lSI (I A).  Particulars of the  offence as  mentioned  in  the  charge"
"","also covers the same, so  that the Appellant could have  understood the charge."
"10.","Drunken driving has  become prevalent and  it further aggravates when the vehicle is  used to"
"","transport passengers.  Such driver who  is drunk risks the  lives of the passengers as  well.  The"
"","legislature  has  considered  the  seriousness  of the  offence,  therefore,  made  it  mandatory  for"
"","the  Court to  cancel  the  driving licence  for  the  offence of drunken  driving when  the  vehicle"
"","is used  for carriage of passengers for a fee."
"II.","Hence,  the  grounds  urged  by  the  Appellant  are  without  merit  and 
the  appeal  should  be"
"","dismissed."
"12.","It 
is  pertinent  to  note  that  upon  conviction  of an  Accused  for  an  offence  under  section"
"","151 (lA),  it  is  also  mandatory  for  the  Magistrate  to  impose  a  sentence  of imprisonment  of"
"","either description  for  a  term  not  exceeding  six  months, apart  from  the  prescribed  fine  and"
"","the  cancellation of the  driving  licence.  It has  escaped the  mind of the  learned  Magistrate as"
"","well  as  the  learned  High  Court Judge  who  heard  the  revision  application.  Therefore, acting"
"","in  terms  the  powers vested  in  this  Court by  section 328  of the  Code of Criminal  Procedure"
