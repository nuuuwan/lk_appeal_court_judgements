hort  notice  on  30.11.2016.    Although  the  7th  Respondent  did"
"not participate at the second inquiry, the 1st Petitioner says the"
"5th  Respondent,  who  conducted 
the 
inquiry,  was  biased 
in"
"favour  of 
the  7th  Respondent  and  expressly  stated 
the  7th"
"Respondent is entitled to the land."
"The  1st  Petitioner  protested  against  the  second  inquiry  on  the"
"same day by P16."

"from  conducting 
further 
inquiries  and  a  writ  of  mandamus"
"directing the said Respondents to act in terms of P14."
"In  the  statement  of  objections  filed  by  the  1st-6th  Respondents"
"dated 05.07.2018, the said Respondents do not give any reasons"
"for holding the second inquiry."
"But,  in  the  written  submissions,  the  said  Respondents  state,"
"after  issuance  of  P14,  the  7th  Respondent  again  requested  the"
"permit not be issued in the name of the 2nd Petitioner but in her"
"name  –  vide  7R2.    It  is  on  this  basis  the  decision  to  hold  the"
"second inquiry was made.  However, the 2nd Respondent did not"
"participate  at  the  second  inquiry.    Hence  the  matter  shall  end"
"here."
"The 
Petitioners’ 
entire 
case

on 
the 
legitimate"
"expectation  made  out  by  P14.
