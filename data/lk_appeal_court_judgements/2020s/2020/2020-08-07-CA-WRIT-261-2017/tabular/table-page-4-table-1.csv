"I
t is the position of the 1st Petitioner that it is he who expended"
"money  to  buy  the  land  and  also  construct  the  house  thereon."
"The 
7th  Respondent 
disputes 
this 
claim. 
  Although  not"
"conclusive,  it  appears  the  land  had  been  bought  by  the  7th"
"Respondent and the house was constructed by the 1st Petitioner"
"â€“ vide P27."
"Once the original permit issued to Wanigasekera was cancelled,"
"the property reverted to the State."
"Thereafter, both the 1st Petitioner and the 7th Respondent appear"
"to  have  made 
representations 
separately 
to 
the  Mahaweli"
"Authority  to  have  a  permit  or  long-term  lease  in  respect  of  the"
"land issued in their favour."
"An 
inquiry 
in 
this 
regard  was  admittedly  held  by 
the  6th"
"Respondent  on  02.06.2016  with 
the  participation  of  both"
"parties.    The  outcome  of  the  inquiry  and  the  recommendation"
"thereon  sent  to  the  2nd  Respondent  is  marked  P27.    The  said"
"recommendation is not to issue the permit in the name of either"
"of the  parties  but to issue a long-term lease  in the name of the"
"eldest  son, 
the  2nd  Petitioner. 
  The 
reason  given 
for 
this"
"recommendation is, in my view, acceptable: i.e. in the event the"
"permit is issued in the name of either the husband or wife, there"
"is  a 
likelihood  of  alienation  of  the 
land  due  to  matrimonial"
"disputes.  The formal recommendation on P27 was made by the"
"2nd Respondent by P14."
"The  complaint  of  the  1st  Petitioner  is,  subsequent  to  the  said"
"inquiry and the formal recommendation whereby it was decided"
"to  take  steps  to  give  the  land  on  long-term  lease  to  the  2nd"
"Petitioner,  the  1st  Petitioner  was  called  for  a  second  inquiry  on"
