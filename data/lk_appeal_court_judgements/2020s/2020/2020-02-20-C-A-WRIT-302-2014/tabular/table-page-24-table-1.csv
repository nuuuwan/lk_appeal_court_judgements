"contend that the time limit prescribed by Article 126(2) applied"
"in  respect  of  this  allegation  of  the  violation  of  fundamental"
"rights by executive action, and in any event that time limit has"

"As  Justice  Douglas  of 
the  United  States  Supreme  Court"
"observed,  dissenting,  in  United  States  v.  Wunderlich  (1951)"
"342 US 98, 101:"
"“Law  has  reached  its finest  moments  when  it  has freed  man"
"from 
the  unlimited  discretion  of  some  ruler,  some  civil  or"
"military 
official, 
some 
bureaucrat.  Where

"absolute,  man  has  always  suffered.  At  times  it  has  been  his"
"property

invaded;  at

"thought;  at  times,  his  life.  Absolute  discretion  is  a  ruthless"
"master.  It  is  more  destructive  of  freedom  than  any  of  man’s"
"other inventions. [The decision of the majority] makes a tyrant"
"out  of  every  contracting  officer.  He  is  granted  the  power  of  a"
"tyrant even though he is stubborn, perverse or captious. He is"
"allowed  the  power  of  a  tyrant  though  he  is  incompetent  or"
"negligent.  He  has  the  power  of  life  and  death  over  a  private"
