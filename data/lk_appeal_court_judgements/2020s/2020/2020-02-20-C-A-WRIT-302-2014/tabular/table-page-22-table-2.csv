"Court of Appeal and held:"
"(a) The  Appellant realised that the land acquired  from him was"
"not  used  for  a  public  purpose  only  in  2002,  when  the  4th"
"Respondent  put  up  its  name  board  on  the  said  land,  and"
"therefore  the  Appellant  adequately  explained  his  delay  in"
"instituting the application in the Court of Appeal."
"(b) The Ministerâ€™s decision to acquire land can be challenged in"
"a  Court  of  Law.    A  Minister  does  not  have  the  unfettered"
"right  to  acquire  land  without  specifying  a  public  purpose."
"Nor does a Minister have a right to acquire land and utilise it"
"for purposes other than a public purpose."
"(c)  No improvements had taken place on the land and the filling"
"up  of  the  land  by  the  4th  Respondent  for  a  purpose  other"
"than a public purpose cannot be described as improvements"
"for the purpose of section 39A(2)(C)."
