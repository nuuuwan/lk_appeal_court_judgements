"","The  argument  that  an  executive  discretion  of  this  nature  is"
"","unfettered or absolute, that the repository of such a discretion"
"","can do what he pleases, is not a new one. But it is one which"
"","has  been  unequivocally  rejected.  The  discretion  conferred  in"
"1979  must  also  be  considered","in 
the  background  of 
the"
"","constitutional  guarantees  which  sought  to  make  the  Rule  of"
"","Law  a  reality,  and  in  particular  Article  12.  An  example  was"
"","suggested to the learned Deputy Solicitor General: where after"
"","an  acquisition  of  one  hundred  contiguous  allotments  of  land,"
"","for  an  irrigation  project,  or  for  a  road,  the  project  had  to  be"
"","abandoned,  for  technical,  financial  or  political  reasons,  the"
"","Minister  then  exercised  his  discretion  under  section  39A,  to"
"divest 
some","allotments, 
while 
retaining 
others 
(in"
"","circumstances  in  which  no  rational  distinction  could  be  made"
"","between  the  two  categories),  perhaps  influenced  by  personal"
"","or political considerations. It was readily conceded that such a"
"","decision  could  be  challenged  in  an  application  under  Article"
"126.  That  alone","is  enough  to  establish  that  the  discretion"
"","under  section  39A  is  not  unfettered;  and  here,  out  of  seven"
"","lands  acquired  in one  acquisition proceeding,  the first lot  has"
"","been divested, but not other lots which are equally unaffected"
