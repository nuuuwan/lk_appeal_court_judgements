"(5)  The  Minister 
in 
the 
instant 
case,  has  exercised  his"
"discretion very curiously. First he agreed to divest one lot, but"
"did  not  do  so.  He  then  divested  the  first  lot.  Thereafter  his"
"reply  to  a  direct  request  to  divest  the  remaining  land,  was  in"
"effect, 
that 
it  was  not  his  business,  but  a  matter  for  his"
"colleague,  who  was  not  the  statutory  authority.  This  was  a"
"clear refusal to exercise his discretion for a wrong reason, and"
"also  an  abdication  of  discretion.  In  the  Court  of  Appeal  he"
"sought  to  justify  his  inaction  on  the  different,  but  patently"
"erroneous  basis  that  the  land  was  required  for  a  shopping"
"complex  -  ignorant  or  forgetful  of  the  fact  that  the  land  was"
"over  19  acres  in  extent  while  the  shopping  complex  required"
"only about 3% of that extent; a manifestly erroneous basis for"
"his refusal to exercise his discretion."
"(6)  The  affidavits  and  documents  produced  show  beyond"
"doubt 
that  had 
the  matter  been  considered  properly, 
the"
"Minister 
(1st  Respondent)  had  no  option  but 
to  make  a"
"divesting  order,  retaining  only  the  land  actually  required  for"
"the  shopping  complex,  subject 
to  compliance  with  section"
"39A(2)(d)."
