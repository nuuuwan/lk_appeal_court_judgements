"The proviso to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act is based"
"on the urgency regarding a proposed acquisition and therefore"
"the  burden  of  establishing  urgency 
is  on 
the  acquiring"
"authority. In the circumstances of the case, the requirement of"
"urgency  has  not  been  established  by  the  acquiring  authority"
"and placing the burden of showing that there was no urgency"
"on  the  appellant  would  amount  to  a  misdirection  in  law.  The"
"facts and circumstances of this case do not  warrant an order"
"under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act on"
"the ground of urgency."
"Since the final authority regarding the decision to acquire land"
"under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, especially in"
"terms  of  Clause  (a)  of  the  proviso  to  Section  38  is  on  the"
"Minister, the Minister has a duty to act with care in arriving at"
"such  decisions  as  the  discretion  conferred  on  him  is  not  one"
"which is unfettered. Exercise of unfettered discretion could be"
"the subject of challenge. The Minister must endeavour to make"
"proper 
inquiries  and  only  pursue  such  acquisitions 
if  no"
"alternative 
is  available  as  otherwise  such  actions  would"
"jeopardize the interests of the Public."
