that  with 
the"

the  Judgment  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  in  Writ"
"Application  No.  120/1995,  the  question  of  the  tenancy  of  Mendis  Singho"
"over the 4th  Respondent's land had ""reached finality"".  It appears that the 4th"
"Respondent relies  on the principle of  Res  Judicata  when  he  made  the  said"
"impress  that 
the  dispute  had  reached 
submission  before 
this  Court  to"
"finality  with  the  dismissal  of  the  Writ Application filed  by  Mendis  Singho"
"challenging 
the  validity  of  P8  before 
the  Provincial  High  Court.  The"
"present  Petitioner  or  her  father  were  not  cited 
in 
that  application  as"
"Respondents  and  therefore  are  not  parties  to  that  litigation.  It  is  correct"
"that they seek almost identical remedy against the determination P8 in the"
"the  1st 
to  3rd 
instant  application.  But  since 
the  pronouncement  of  P8,"
"Respondents acting on the findings of P8,  have proceeded to  make several"
"other consequential  orders under the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of"
"2000, 
to 
the  extent  of  handing  over  the  possession  of 
the  paddy  land"
