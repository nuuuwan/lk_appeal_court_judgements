"It is my considered opinion that the learned High Court judge"
"has  not  given  his  mind 
to 
the  fact  that  a  vehicle  confiscation"
"inquiry had commenced and that the registered owner who has to"
"satisfy  Court  why 
the  vehicle  should  not  be  confiscated,  has"
"concluded  his  evidence  and  that  there  was  a 
legal  duty  and  an"
"obligation  on 
the 
learned  Magistrate 
to  consider 
the  existing"
"evidence before making the order to confiscate the vehicle."
