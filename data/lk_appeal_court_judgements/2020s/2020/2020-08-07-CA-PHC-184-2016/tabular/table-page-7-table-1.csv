"rejected."
"Section  28A  (I)  of the  Urban  Development  Authority  Law,  as  amended,"
"provides  for  the  procedure  to  be  followed 
in  respect  of development  activities"
"commenced contrary to  the terms and conditions of a permit; that is,"
"(a) to cease such development activity forthwith;  or"
"(b) to  restore the  land  on which such  development activity  is  being executed or"
"has been executed, to its original condition; or"
"(c) to  secure  compliance  with 
the  permit  under  the  authority  of which 
that"
"development  activity 
is  carried  out  or  engaged 
in,  or  with  any 
term  or"
"condition  of such  permit,  and 
for 
the  purposes  of compliance  with 
the"
"requirements aforesaid,"
"(i) 
to discontinue the use  of any or building; or"
"(ii) to demolish or alter any building or work."
"Accordingly,  Section  28A  (I) has  laid  down  the  procedure  to  be  followed,"
"where  any  development  activity  commenced  continued,  resumed  or  completed"
"without  a  permit  or contrary  to  any  term  or  condition  set  out  in  a  permit  issued,"
"pertaining to a development activity."
"The  Respondent 
relied 
on  Urban  Development  Authority  Vs.  H. W."
