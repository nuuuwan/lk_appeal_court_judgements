"Thereafter, the status of the lands forming the subject matter of this application as  at present is"
"as follows:"
"A  portion  of the  land  acquired  by  P1( X1)  was  divested  by  P5(X3)  which  divesting  order  was"
"cancelled  by  X5.  Hence  the  land  forming  the  subject  matter of P5(X3)  continues to vest  in  the"
"State."
"A portion of land  acquired by P2(X2) was  divested by P6(X4)  and  later the acquisition of the said"
"land was cancelled  by X6.  Hence this  land  is  not vested in the State."
"In  both
