"This approach  is consistent with the 'presumption of validity' according to which  administrative"
"action is  presumed to be valid  unless or until it is set aside  by a Court [F Hoffmann-La Roche and"
"Co.  AG v.  Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) A.C.  295] . However, this 'presumption"
"of validity' exists  pending a final  decision  by the Court [Lord  Hoffmann  in  R v.  Wicks  (1998)  A.C."
"92  at  115,  Lords  Irvine  LC  and  5teyn  in  Boddington  v.  British  Transport  Police  (1999)  2 A.C.  143"
"at  156 and  161, and  173-4] ."
