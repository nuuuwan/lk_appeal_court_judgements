"Thus,  even  where  an  act  of a public authority is  ultra  vires  and  a nullity, for remedial  purposes"
"the illegality must be established before a court. As  stated by Wade and  Forsyth, Administrative"
"Law,  9th  Ed.,  Indian Edition, 281:"
""""".the  court will  treat  an  administrative  act  or order  invalid  only  if the  right  remedy  is"
"sought by the right person  in the right proceedings"""
"This  approach  is  reflected  in the statement of Lord  Radcliffe  in  Smith  v.  East Elloe  Rural District"
"Council [(1956) A.C.  736, 769-770] where he  held :"
"""An order, even  if not made  in  good faith is  still an  act capable  of legal  consequences.  It"
"bears  no  brand  of invalidity  upon  its  forehead .  Unless  the  necessary  proceedings  are"
"taken  at  law  to  establish 
the  cause  of  invalidity  and  to  get  it  quashed  or  otherwise"
"upset,  it will  remain  as  effective  for  its  ostensible  purpose  as  the  most  impeccable  of"
"orders."""
"Wade  and  Forsyth,  Administrative Law,  (supra)  page  304,  after restating  the  above  statement"
"of Lord  Radcliffe sets out the correct position as follows:"
"""This must be  equally true even  where the 'brand of invalidity' is  plainly visible for there"
"also  the  order  can  effectively  be  resisted  in  law  only  by  obtaining  the  decision  of the"
"court.  The  necessity of recourse  to the  court has  been  pointed  out  repeatedly in  the"
"House  of  Lords  and  Privy  Council,  without  distinction  between  patent  and 
latent"
"defects.  Lord  Diplock spoke still more clearly  [F Hoffmann-La  Roch  and C AG  v.  Secretary"
"for Trade  and Industry (1975) A.C.  295  at 366], saying that"
"It leads to confusion to use  such  terms as  'Voidable',  'voidable ab  initio', 'void' or"
"'a  nullity'  as  descriptive  of the  status  of  subordinate  legislation  alleged  to  be"
"ultra 
vires 
for  patent  or 
for 
latent  defects,  before 
its  validity  has 
been"
"pronounced on  by a court of competent jurisdiction."" (Emphasis added)"
