"I
n  my  view,  the  whole  process 
involving  all 
four  offences 
is"
"tainted  with  illegality,  ultra  vires  and  procedural  impropriety."
"Let me explain."
"For  the 
first  offence  of 
losing  his  service 
identity  card,  the"
"Petitioner  was  charged  only  under  section  115(1)(b)  of  the  Air"
"Force  Act,  as  seen  from  1R3.    No  other  section  is  mentioned  in"
"the  charge  sheet. 
 
If 
the  Respondents  opted 
to  charge 
the"
"Petitioner  only  under  the  said  section,  then  according  to  that"
"section  the  Petitioner  should  have  been  tried  by  Court  Martial."
"This was not done.  Hence the said decision and punishment are"
"ultra vires."
"The  letter  of  warning  1R5,  which  the  Respondents  heavily  rely"
"on,  was  served  on  the  Petitioner  as  the  punishment  for  the"
"second  offence.    This  punishment  was  admittedly  given  upon"
"conclusion of a Court of Inquiry and not after a summary trial or"
"Court Martial."
"According 
to 
the  Air  Force 
(Courts  of 
Inquiry)  Regulations,"
"promulgated  under  section  155  of  the  Air  Force  Act,  found  in"
"Chapter  359  in  Vol.  VI  of  the  Subsidiary  Legislation  (1956),  a"
"Court of Inquiry is not a body empowered to decide a matter.  Its"
"task  is  to  investigate  and  report  to  the  convening  authority,  for"
"the convening authority to decide on the future course of action."
"Upon  the  findings  of  a  Court  of  Inquiry,  punishment  cannot  be"
"imposed.    For  punishment  to  be  imposed,  the  accused  shall  be"
"convicted  on  a  charge  sheet.    But  there  is  neither  an  accused"
"nor  a  charge  sheet  at  a  Court  of  Inquiry.    It  is  a  fact-finding"
"mission.    This  is  amply  clear  by  Regulation  2  of  the  Air  Force"
