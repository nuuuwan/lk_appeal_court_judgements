"The Judicial Medical Officer, who performed the Post Mortem of the deceased,  had described"
"the  nature  of the  weapon which was  used  for  the  stab as  a knife  with a sharp edge (PI).  The"
"nature  of the  injury  one  was  elaborated  as  a  ""penetrating stab injury of the back of the left"
"side  of the chest,  2.2cm,  inverted  ""V"" shape"" shows  that  an  extensive  damage  was  caused"
"It  was  also  undisputed  that  the 
and  must  have  struck  the  deceased  with  very  great  force."
"deceased  was  unarmed and  he  had  no  likelihood of protecting himself from  the  attack of the"
"appellant.  When considering the  medical evidence,  the  deceased sustained three stab  injuries"
"where all  pierce  the  left  lung and cut a vein which affected a sudden death due to  a necessary"
"fatal  injury. 
In my  view,  this  indicates that the  appellant had taken an  undue  advantage over"
"the situation."
