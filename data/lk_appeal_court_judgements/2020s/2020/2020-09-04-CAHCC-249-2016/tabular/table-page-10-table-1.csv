"Thus the Ratio decidendi of the above cited case establi.shed that;"
"""i)  though the accused has not taken  up the defence of intoxication if such defence"
"arises on the evidence it is the duty of the jury to consider the same."
"ii)  In  cases  of involuntary  intoxication  the  test  is  the  same  as  that  applicable  to"
"insanity,  namely  the  degree  of intoxication  is  such  that  the  accused  was  totally"
"deprived  of capacity  to  apprehend the nature  of the  act  or  its  wrongful or illegal"
"character.  The section  dealing  with  voluntary intoxication  is  of wider scope in  that"
"the effect of the provision  is  not confined to  intoxication in this degree,  but applies"
