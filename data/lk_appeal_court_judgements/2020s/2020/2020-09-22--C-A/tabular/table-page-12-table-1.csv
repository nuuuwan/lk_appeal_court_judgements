"payment, and it is not enough for  the accused to leave a doubt in  the"
"mind  of  the  Court,  because 
leaving  a  doubt  alone  will  not  be"
"sufficient.  Here  there  is  no  doubt  that the  trial Judge  had the  case of"
"Jayasena,  72  N.L.R.  313,  in  mind.  This  is,  with  respect,  a correct"
"statement  of the  burden  that  lay  on 
the  appellant  and  that  is 
the"
"yardstick  applied  by 
the 
trial  Judge 
in  determining  whether 
the"
"presumption has  been  rebutted. When  the learned trial Judge said in"
"the 
second 
instance 
that 
the 
appellant 
'has 
to 
prove 
these"
"transactions  are  free 
from 
taint  and 
that 
the  character  of  these"
"payments  are  above  suspicion' he  meant  nothing other  than  to  say"
"that  'leaving  a doubt  alone  will  not  be  sufficient'  as 
in 
the  first"
