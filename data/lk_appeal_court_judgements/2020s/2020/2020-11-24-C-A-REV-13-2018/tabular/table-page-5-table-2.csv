"Plaintiff-Respondent  instituted  a  possessory  action 
in 
the  District  Court  of  Polonnaruwa"
"seeking  an  order  for  ejectment  of  the  Defendants  from  the  paddy  field 
in  dispute  and"
"restore  him  in  possession.  In  addition  to  the  said  relief the  Plaintiff  sought  damages  from"
"the Defendants for the period  he  was  out of possession . The  Defendants filed  their Answer"
"and  set  up  a claim  in  reconvention  against  the  Plaintiff purportedly on  the  basis  that  they"
"have  entered  in  to  possession  by  paying  sum  of money to the  brother of the  Plaintiff and"
"therefore they are entitled to possess the land  in  dispute."
"It is  pertinent to note that when the relevant case  was  called  on  the 10th of November 1993"
"the  Defendants  were  not  present 
in  Court  and 
the  Registered  Attorney  of  the  said"
"Defendants 
informed  Court  that  he  has  no 
instructions.  Thereafter  the 
learned  District"
"Judge fixed the trial ex-parte against the Defendants."
"I 
further  note 
that, 
thereafter 
the 
1st  Defendant-Respondent  made 
an 
application"
"purportedly  under  and 
in 
terms  of Section  86(2)  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code  before  the"
"delivery  of the judgment  and  the  Application  of the  1st  Defendant  is  misconceived  of law"
"since  such  an  application  cannot  be  made  under  and  in  terms  of Section  86(2)  of the Civil"
"Procedure Code unless the Plaintiff consents to vacate the order for ex-parte trial."
"Thereafter  the  ex-parte  trial  was  taken  up  and  the  judgment  was  given  in  favour  of  the"
"Plaintiff. The  1st Defendant-Petitioner has  contended that the said  trial commenced  without"
"recording  admissions  and 
issues  and  therefore  there  is  a  procedural  defect  in  the  entire"
"process.  However, 
there 
is  no  necessity 
to 
record  admissions  and 
issues 
in  case 
if  it"
"proceeded for ex-parte trial and  there was  no necessity in  recording admission  and  issues as"
"an  inter parte trial."
"It is  also  pertinent to note that, thereafter the 1st Defendant had filed  an  Application  under"
"and 
in 
terms  of  Section  839  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  and 
the  learned  District  Judge"
