"In Biso Manikaâ€™s case, Sharvananda, J. (later C.J.), at page 379"
"An application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within"
"a  reasonable  time  from  the  date  of  the  Order  which  the"
"applicant  seeks  to  have  quashed.  What  is  reasonable  time"
"and what will constitute undue delay will depend upon the"
"facts of each particular case. However the time lag that can"
"be explained does not spell laches or delay. If the delay can"
"be 
reasonably  explained, 
the  Court  will  not  decline 
to"
"interfere. The delay which a Court can excuse is one which"
"is caused by the applicant pursuing a legal remedy and not"
"a  remedy  which 
is  extra-legal.  One  satisfactory  way  to"
"explain  the  delay  is  for  the  Petitioner  to  show  that  he  has"
"been seeking relief elsewhere in a  manner provided by the"
"Law."
"When  the  Court  has  examined  the  record  and  is  satisfied"
"the Order complained of is manifestly erroneous or without"
"jurisdiction the Court would be loath to allow the mischief of"
"the  Order  to  continue  and  reject  the  application  simply  on"
"the  ground  of  delay,  unless  there  are  very  extraordinary"
"reasons 
to 
justify  such 
rejection.  Where 
the  authority"
"concerned 
has 
been 
acting 
altogether  without 
basic"
"jurisdiction, the Court may grant relief in spite of the delay"
"unless 
the 
conduct  of 
the  party  shows 
that  he  has"
"approbated 
the  usurpation  of 
jurisdiction. 
In  any  such"
"event,  the  explanation  of  the  delay  should  be  considered"
"sympathetically."
