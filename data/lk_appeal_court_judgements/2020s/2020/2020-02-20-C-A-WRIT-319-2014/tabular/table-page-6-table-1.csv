"D
ecember  2013”.    Be  that  as  it  may,  if  this  Court  accepts  the"
"position of learned State Counsel at the argument, where is the"
"Award made by the Compensation Tribunal comprising the Chief"
"Valuer and two other Members?  No such Award was tendered at"
"least  at  the  stage  of  the  argument,  notwithstanding  this  matter"
"was  in  the  forefront  of  the  counter  objections  and  the  written"
"submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner."
"In the eyes of law, “the Award dated 18 December 2013” marked"
"R1, is not an Award."
"There 
could  not  have  been  a 
fresh  Award  made  by 
the"
"Compensation  Tribunal  with  the  Chief  Valuer  as  the  Chairman"
"after  R1  dated  18.12.2013,  because 
the 
letter  marked  R2"
"informing  the  Petitioner  of  the  quantum  of  compensation 
is"
"dated 19.12.2013."
"Although the Respondents in their statement of objections claim"
"that the Petitioner by R3 “acknowledged the receipt of the award"
"of  compensation  notified  by 
letter  dated  19.12.2013”,  a  close"
"scrutiny  of  R3  reveals  that  the  Petitioner  did  not  consider  the"
"said  letter  as  an  Award  but  as  an  offer  of  compensation  to  be"
"accepted  or  rejected  by  him.    The  first  sentence  of  R3  says:  “I"
"have  received  your  letter  of  19th  December,  and  I  have  to  reject"
"your  offer  of  compensation  [for  Rs.  4,865,000/=]  unless  you  will"
"agree  that  this  is  a  down  payment  to  a  later  final  settlement"
"without any strings attached.”"
"The 
Petitioner  had  not 
been 
served  with  R1 
and  R1(a)"
"documents.    The  Petitioner  saw  these  documents  for  the  first"
"time  when  they  were  tendered  by  the  Respondents  with  their"
"statement of objections."
