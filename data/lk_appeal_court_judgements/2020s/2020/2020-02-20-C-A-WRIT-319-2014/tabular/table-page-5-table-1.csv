"o
f this case”; the other two Members of the Tribunal are named"
"as the 6th and 7th Respondents."
"The fact that the Award is made by the Compensation Tribunal"
"comprising the 5th-7th Respondents is made abundantly clear by"
"the public notifications tendered by the Respondents marked R5"
"and R6.  This is reinforced by P10, a letter sent by the Secretary"
"of the Compensation Tribunal to the Petitioner."
"The  Respondents 
in  paragraph  11 
of 
their 
statement 
of"
"objections 
state 
that 
“the  determination 
of 
the 
award 
of"
"compensation  by 
the  Compensation  Tribunal  was  made  on"
"18.12.2013 
[R1],  and  was  communicated 
to 
the  Petitioner  on"
"19.12.2013 
[R2], 
and 
the 
Petitioner, 
by 
his 
letter 
dated"
"26.12.2013,  had  acknowledged 
the 
receipt  of 
the  award  of"
"compensation [R3]”."
"By paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit the Petitioner has taken"
"the  strong  position  that  if,  according  to the  Respondents,  R1  is"
"the  Award,  it  is  illegal  and  ultra  vires,  as  the  Award  was  made"
"without the 5th Respondent Chief Valuer, presiding as Chairman"
"of the Tribunal."
"As seen from the last page of R1, the Award or “Determination of"
"Compensation”  has  been  made  by  R.A.R.M.N.  Rajakaruna  as"
"Chairman  and  the  6th  and  7th  Respondents  as  Members  of  the"
"Compensation Tribunal.  It is addressed to the Chief Valuer."
"At  the  argument,  learned  State  Counsel  for  the  Respondents"
"stated that R1 is only a recommendation made by a Committee"
"to  the  Chief  Valuer.    This  is  in  contradiction  to  the  position"
"taken  by 
the  Respondents 
in  paragraph  20  of 
the  written"
"submissions,  where  R1  is  referred  to  as  “the  Award  dated  18"
