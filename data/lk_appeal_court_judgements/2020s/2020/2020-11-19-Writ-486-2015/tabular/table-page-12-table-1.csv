"As observed in De Smith’s Judicial Review3:"
"“The  question  of  the  appropriate  measure  of  deference,  respect,  restraint,"
"latitude or discretionary area  of judgment (to use  some  of the terms variously"
"employed)  which  Courts  should  grant  the  primary  decision  maker  under  this"
"head of review is one of the most complex in all of public law and goes to the"
"heart of the principle of the separation of powers. This is because there is often"
"a fine line between assessment of the merits of the decision (evaluation of fact"
"and policy) and the assessment of whether the principles of “just administrative"
"action”  have  been  met.  The  former  questions  are  normally  matters  for  the"
"primary  decision-maker,  but  the  latter  are  within  the  appropriate  capacity  of"
"the courts to decide.”"
