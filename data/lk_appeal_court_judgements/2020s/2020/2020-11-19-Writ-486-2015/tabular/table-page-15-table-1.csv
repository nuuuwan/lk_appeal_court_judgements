"Let me now consider whether the Senate Appointed Panel acted unreasonably when"
"it failed to allot the marks that the Petitioner claims he should have been given for"
"Section 1. The test to determine the reasonableness of a decision was laid down by"
"Lord Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation"
"when he defined unreasonableness as ‘something so absurd that no sensible person"
"could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority.’ 11 In Council of Civil"
"Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service12 Lord Diplock described irrationality"
"by  reference  to  Wednesbury,  when  he  stated  that,  “By  ‘irrationality’  I  mean  what"
"can now be succinctly referred to as ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’. It applies to a"
"decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards"
"that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could"
"have arrived at it.”"
