"That brings me to the final argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, which"
"is  that  the  decision  of  the  Selection  Committee  should  have  been  informed  to  the"
"Petitioner.  While  the  Petitioner  is  entitled  to  be  informed  of  the  outcome  of  his"
"application, for reasons which I shall now proceed to discuss, I am satisfied that the"
"Petitioner was made aware of the decision of the Selection Committee, many years"
"prior to ‘P17’."
