"c) 
Two copies of the publications, research papers and other relevant documents."
"T
he manner of evaluating each application that is received by the relevant University"
"has also been set out in the said Circular."
"A
ccordingly, the Senate shall appoint two External Experts in the relevant field from"
"outside  the  Higher  Educational  Institution  concerned,  to  evaluate  the  applicants’"
"contribution under Sections 2 and 3.1 (the External Experts)."
"T
he evaluation of the contribution under Sections 1 and 3.2 is carried out by a panel"
"appointed by the Senate consisting of the Vice Chancellor or the Dean of the relevant"
"Faculty,  and  two  Professors,  one  of  whom 
is  either  from  within  or  outside  the"
"institution  concerned  but  has  knowledge  of  the  discipline  or  related  discipline"
"relating  to  the  applicant,  and  the  other  person  from  another  faculty  of  the  same"
"higher educational institution as the applicant (the Senate Appointed Panel)."
"T
he 
final  selection  shall  be  made  by 
the  Selection  Committee  based  on 
the"
"independent  evaluation  reports  submitted  by  the  External  Experts  and  the  Senate"
"Appointed  Panel.  The  composition  of  the  Selection  Committee  has  been  set  out  in"
"Circular No. 223 dated 30th June 1983 marked ‘P10’ issued by the University Grants"
"Commission. It must be noted that the Selection Committee does not allot marks to a"
"candidate and would be guided by the marks allotted by the External Experts and the"
"Senate Appointed Panel. The final decision with regard to selection would however"
"be  with the  Selection Committee, and  where appropriate,  the  Selection  Committee"
"has  the  power  to  adjust  marks  given  by  the  External  Experts  and  the  Senate"
"Appointed Panel."
"I
 must observe at the outset that the scheme of evaluation set out in Circular No. 723"
"seeks  to  ensure  that  an  application  for  a  post  such  as  Associate  Professor  or"
"Professor 
is  evaluated  by  those  persons  who  have  the  expertise  in  the  relevant"
"discipline as that of the applicant or of the work carried out by the applicant. This is"
"confirmed when one considers the fact that of the 90 marks that are required to be"
"appointed  as  a  Professor,  approximately  60  marks  must  come  from  the  External"
"Experts.  Similarly,  of  the  65  marks  required  to  become  an  Associate  Professor,"
"approximately 35 marks would have to be allotted by the External Experts. Even with"
"6"
