"To the aforementioned argument, the Plaintiff states that it will be  observed ~hat the Western"
"Boundary of the Plaintiff's land  is the main  road  and the said  boundary had  been  in  existence"
"at least from the year 1925 where the oldest deed of the Plaintiff had  been  el!8cuted."
"The  evidence of the Plaintiff is to the effect that the predecessor in title of the Defendant was"
"at one time the  sub  post  mistress of the Wahakotte Sub  Post  Office  who  condu~ted the said"
"post office on the Defendants'  land ."
"They 
further  state 
that  at 
that  point  of  time,  since 
there  was  no  proper  access 
to  the"
"Defendants' 
land,  the  sister  of the  Plaintiff  had  permitted  the  predecessor  in 
title  of  the"
"Defendants to gain  access  to the post office through  their land. This  is  permissive  user of the"
"land  which  will  not  create  a  prescriptive 
title  unless 
the  Defendants  could  establish 
the"
"change  of  character  of  their  possession.  The  Plaintiff  further  explains  the  reason 
for  the"
"erecting  a fence  which  is  that since  there was  the  post office,  there  had  to  be  free  access  to"
"the  same  and  they had  to  protect the  balance  part of their land  from  stray cattle  and  other"
"intruders."
"Furthermore, the  Plaintiffs submit that the  best  evidence  to establish  the true identity of the"
"Defendant's land  was  to call  their predecessor in  title as  a witness  but they have failed  to do"
"so which  is a fact which has to be considered  adverse to their case."
"However,  the  Defendants  introduce  a  procedural  error  made  by  the  Plaintiff  which  is  that"
"during the  appeal  when  the Court  of Appeal  directed  to file  Written  Submissions  as  final  on"
"The 
12.10.2018,  the  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiff Appellant  and  also  the  Plaintiff  were  absent."
"Counsel for the Defendant Respondents and the Defendants were present before Court."
"Due  to the  absence  of the  Counsel, the  Learned  Judge  of the  Court of Appeal  had  dismissed"
"the  Appeal  without  Cost.  The  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  had  subsequently  filed  a  relisting"
"application and  the case  was fixed  for an  inquiry on  the  relisting application .  The  Defendants"
"claim  that  if the  attorney,  without  sufficient  cause  was  absent  and  the  court  dismissed  the"
"application, the court is entitled to refuse to reinstate the matter."
"To  this  argument  of  the  Defendants,  the  Plaintiffs  state  that  the  non  -appearance  of  Mr."
"Dilhan  (the  Counsel  on  their behalf)  was  due  to  an  unforeseen  and  unexpected  reason  that"
"was  beyond  his control as  he  had  been  held  up in  traffic near the Panchikawatte Junction and"
"still  he  had  managed  to reach  the  Court  Room  just as  the  case  had  been  dismissed .  Hence,"
"they submitted that the non-appearance on  the part of the Appellant of the said  date was  not"
"intentional  but due  to an  unexpected  and  unforeseen  circumstances  which  were  beyond  the"
"control of the parties."
