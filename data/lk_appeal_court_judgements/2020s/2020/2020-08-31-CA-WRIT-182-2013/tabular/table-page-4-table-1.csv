"marked  ‘P4’,  in extent of  2A 3R  20P.  According to the Petitioner, the land given"
"under  the  Grant ‘P3’ was only part of  the high  land  given  to Anula Kumarihamy"
"under the Permit ‘P1’. Thus, when issuing the Grant ‘P3’, the State had not given"
"the entirety of the land held by Anula Kumarihamy under the permit ’P1’ but had"
"instead  given  1A  1R  30P  less  than  the  extent  of  the  high  land  given  under  the"
"Permit ‘P1’. Be that as it may, the Petitioner claims that he is in occupation of the"
"entire land given under the permit ‘P1’ to Anula Kumarihamy."
