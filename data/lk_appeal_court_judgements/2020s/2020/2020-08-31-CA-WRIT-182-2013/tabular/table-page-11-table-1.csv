"Although the Supreme Court arrived at the above conclusion when called upon to"
"decide on the validity of a nomination made while the permit was valid, and the"
"permit  had  subsequently  been  converted  to  a  grant,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"principle  laid  down  by  the  Supreme  Court  that  the  transfer  from  a  permit  to  a"
"grant is one process, would apply to this case."
