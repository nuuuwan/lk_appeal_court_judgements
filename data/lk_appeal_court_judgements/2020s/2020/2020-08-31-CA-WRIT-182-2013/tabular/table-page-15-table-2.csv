"the judgment of the Supreme Court in Biso Menika v.Cyril de Alwis and others9",""
"where it was held as follows:",""
"","“Unlike  in  English  Law,  in  our  Law  there  is  no  statutory  time  limit  within"
"","which a petition for the  issue of a Writ must be  filed. But a rule of practice"
"","has grown which insists upon such, petition being made without undue delay."
"","When no time limit is specified for seeking such remedy, the Court has ample"
"","power  to  condone  delays,  where  denial  of  Writ  to  the  petitioner  is  likely  to"
"","cause great injustice. The Court may therefore in its discretion entertain the"
"application 
in  spite  of 
the 
fact","that  a  petitioner  comes 
to  Court 
late,"
"especially  where  the  Order  challenged","is  a  nullity  for  absolute  want  of"
"jurisdiction in the authority making the order.”",""
