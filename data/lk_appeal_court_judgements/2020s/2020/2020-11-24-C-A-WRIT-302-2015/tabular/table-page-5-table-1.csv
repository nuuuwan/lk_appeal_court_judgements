"The  Petitioner states that as  reflected  by the document marked  as  R2,  which  is  annexed to the"
"objections, clearly reflect the said position that the Petitioner assumed duties as a Senior Lecturer"
"before he assumed duties as the Vice-Chancellor. The Petitioner continued to function as a Senior"
"Lecturer in Mathematics and served as the Second  Examiner for Mathematics exams until March"
"2015, during which period  University had  paid the Petitioner a research allowance to which only"
"academic  staff were  entitled,  because  of the  Petitioner's said  substantive  post.  Moreover,  the"
"Petitioner  was  paid  allowances  for  serving  as  an  Examiner  in  his  substantive  post  as  a Senior"
"lecturer.  As  such,  the  Petitioner states that the  position  taken  up  by the  Respondents  that the"
"Petitioner did  not have a valid visa  to function in the capacity as  a Senior Lecturer in Sri  Lanka, is"
"absolutely  baseless  and  an  afterthought  to  justify  the  illegal  conduct  of the  Respondents 
in"
"preventing the Petitioner from reverting back to his substantive post of Senior Lecturer."
"The  Petitioner also states that there is  no merit in the argument that the Petitioner had  assumed"
"duties  as  Vice  Chancellor  before  assuming  duties  as  a  Senior  Lecturer  and  that  vitiates  the"
"appointment of the position of Senior Lecturer. It is submitted that the Petitioner assumed duties"
"first  in  his  substantive  post  and  thereafter  as  Vice  Chancellor  as  reflected  by  the  document"
"marked as  R2,  which is annexed to the objections. The  Petitioner complained that he was denied"
"the Right of obtaining 3 months' Paid  Leave and the Right to hold his Substantive Post."
"Further, the Petitioner states that by his letter dated 12th March 2015 he wrote to the Competent"
"Authority of the 10th Respondent University seeking 03  months leave prior to resuming duties as"
"a Senior  Lecturer  and  the  Competent  Authority  by  letter  dated  09th  May  2015  informed  the"
"Petitioner that the Competent Authority is seeking a clarification from the UGC with regard to the"
"same."
"Thereafter, the  UGC  by  its  letter dated  24th July  2015,  addressed  to the Competent Authority,"
"Professor Uma  Coomarasamy  had  instructed  to interdict the  Petitioner from the post  of Senior"
"Lecturer and  conduct an  inquiry while paying half salary."
"The  Petitioner  states  that  the  letter  further  instructed  the  Competent  Authority  to  pay  the"
"Petitioner three months special leave with full pay as  per UGC Circular Letter C/99/04, for serving"
"full term in office as the Vice-Chancellor, admitting the fact that the Petitioner's appointment and"
"the  term  as  Vice  Chancellor  was 
legal  and  that the  Petitioner  had  duly  resumed  duties  in  his"
"substantive position of Senior Lecturer.  However, no action had  been taken regarding that letter"
"by 
the  11th  Respondent,  acting 
in  an  arbitrary, 
illegal  and  a  capricious  manner.  The  11th"
"Respondent's  failure  in  adhering  to  the  advice  sought  by  the  said  respondent's  own  initiative"
"demonstrates the high-handed  manner in which the 11th Respondent dealt with matters."
"The  Petitioner  further  states  that  the  Petitioner  became  a dual  citizen  with  effect  from  16th"
"October 2014  prior to his tenure of office as  Vice  Chancellor ended on  4th March 2015 and  not"
"from 11th May 2015 as stated in the affidavit of the Respondents. Thus, the Petitioner was serving"
"part of his term as Vice Chancellor and as a Senior Lecturer in his substantive post, as a Sri  Lankan"
"citizen."
