"to her sister-in-law, and in these circumstances submitted that the  Petitioner"
"has not come before this Court with clean hands. In essence, the submission of"
"the learned State Counsel was that this Court should refrain from exercising its"
"discretion in favour of the Petitioner."
"E
ven if the Petitioner deliberately kept away from the inquiry, which does not"
"appear  to  be  the  case, 
I  cannot  disregard  the  antecedent  circumstances"
"surrounding the cancellation, which I have referred to earlier in this judgment,"
"and  the  collateral  purpose  for  taking  steps  under  the  Ordinance,  namely  the"
"land being required for the Rural Development Society. Nor can I disregard the"
"fact that the provisions of the Ordinance have been violated with impunity, as"
"already  noted,  and  a  sham  inquiry  conducted  to  enable  steps  to  be  taken"
"under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to eject the Petitioner from"
"the said land, and thereby achieve the collateral purpose."

his Court, in KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited vs Consumer Affairs Authority and"
"Others10 has stated that, “Authorities acting on behalf of the public ought to be"
"accountable for the overall quality of the decision making process. While Courts"
"must  be  mindful  not  to  substitute 
its  own  decision  for  that  of  the  public"
"authority,  this  must  be  balanced  with  Courts  taking  an  active  role  in  probing"
"the quality of decisions of public authorities, and ensuring that actions of public"
"authorities  are  properly  substantiated, 
justified,  and  strike  a 
fair  balance"
"between  parties.”  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  above  view  should  be  extended"
"with equal force to ensure due adherence with the procedure laid down in an"
"Act of  Parliament.  Public Officers  cannot and  should  not be  allowed to  act in"
"complete  disregard  of  the  laid  down  procedure,  and  make  a  mockery  of  the"
"Rule of Law."
