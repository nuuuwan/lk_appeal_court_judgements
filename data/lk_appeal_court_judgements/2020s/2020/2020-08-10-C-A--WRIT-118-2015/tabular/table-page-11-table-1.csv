"S
ection  113  of  the  Ordinance  provides  that  a  “permit-holder  aggrieved  by  an"
"order made by the Government Agent under section 110 may appeal therefrom"
"to  the  Land  Commissioner.”  The  mode  of  preferring  an  appeal  and  the  time"
"period for preferring an appeal is set out in Section 114 of the Ordinance."
"S
ection 115 of the Ordinance sets out the powers of the Land Commissioner in"
"determining  an  appeal.  In  terms  of  Section  116(2)  of  the  Ordinance,  “any"
"decision made by the Land Commissioner under section 115 shall be final and"
"conclusive for all purposes.”"
"I
  shall  now  consider  each  of  the  complaints  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner  that  the  procedure 
laid  down 
in  the  Ordinance  has  not  been"
"observed."
"T
he first complaint is that the notice issued under Section 106 – ‘P19’- does not"
"set out the conditions of the permit that the Petitioner has failed to observe."
"Given the fact that the purpose of such a notice is to enable the permit holder"
"to show sufficient cause as to why the permit should not be cancelled, I am of"
"the  view  that  it  is  mandatory  that  the  said  notice  contains  details  relating  to"
"the  violations  of  the  conditions  of  the  permit.  I  have  examined  ‘P19’  and"
"observe  that  ‘P19’  does  not  contain  the  conditions  of  the  permit  that  the"
"Petitioner  had  failed  to  observe  and 
is  a  blank  document.  Without 
‘P19’"
"specifying the conditions of the permit that had been violated, this Court is at a"
"loss  to  understand  how  the  Divisional  Secretary  could  have  satisfied  himself"
"that there has been a breach of any of the conditions of the permit.  Therefore,"
"I  am 
in  agreement  with  the 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  that  the"
"provisions of Section 106 have not been complied with by the 1st Respondent"
"and that ‘P19’ is liable to be quashed, on this ground."
