"“Failure to give adequate reasons therefore amounts to a denial of justice"
"and is itself an error of law. The reasons must not only be intelligible but"
"should deal with the substantial points which have been raised. The courts"
"have  treated  inadequacy  of  reasons  as  an  error  on  the  face  of  record so"
"that inadequately reasoned decision could be quashed, even if the duty to"
"give reasons was not mandatory.”"
