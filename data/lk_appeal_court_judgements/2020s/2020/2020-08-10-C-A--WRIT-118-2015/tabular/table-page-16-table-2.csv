"A
s noted earlier, ‘P19’ does not set out the conditions that have been violated"
"by  the  Petitioner, nor  does ‘1R11’ set out  the  reasons for cancellation  of  the"
"permit. While ‘1R11’ is liable to be quashed due to the failure to give reasons,"
"the absence of reasons clearly demonstrates that the Divisional Secretary did"
"not have any basis to be satisfied that there has been a breach of the condition"
"of the permit, which is a requirement that must be satisfied both in terms of"
"Section 109(1), as well as under Section 110(1)."
