"","“It  is  one  of  the  fundamental  principles  in  the  administration  of  justice"
"","that an administrative body which is to decide must hear both sides and"
"","give  an  opportunity  of  hearing  before  a  decision  is  taken.  No  man  can"
"","incur a loss of property by judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings unless and"
"","until  he  has  had  a  fair  opportunity  of  answering  the  complaint  made"
"against  him.  Thus,  objectors  at  public","inquiries  must  be  given  a  fair"
"opportunity 
to  meet  adverse 
evidence,","even 
though 
the

"","provisions  do  not  cover  the  case  expressly.  (vide  Errington  v.  Minister  of"

"consequences if it affects proprietary rights.”",""
