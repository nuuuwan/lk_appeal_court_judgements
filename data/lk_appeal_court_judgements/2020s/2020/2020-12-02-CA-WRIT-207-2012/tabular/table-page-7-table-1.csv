"The learned Senior State Counsel has submitted that irrespective of the classification,"
"the  control,  management  and  regulation  of  forest  land  as  defined  in  Section  78  is"
"with  the  Conservator  of  Forests.  He  submitted  that  while  the  power  to  manage"
"forests is with the Department of Forest Conservation, the Act contained provisions"
"which empowered  the  Divisional Secretaries to  take  steps to safeguard  forest land."
"The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that the administrative power to"
"manage  residue  forest  land  had  been  vested  in  Divisional  Secretaries  by  a  circular"
"issued in 1998 and that all what the Circular ‘P8’ has done was to cancel that circular"
"and re-vest all residue forest land in the Conservator General of Forests."
