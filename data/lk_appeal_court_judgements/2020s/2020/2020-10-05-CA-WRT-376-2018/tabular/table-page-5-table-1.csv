"the  Petitioners  that  it  was  Lot  311  which  was  sold  to  the  7th"
"Respondent  by  Deed  P10. 
  This 
is  not  disputed  by  the  7th"
"Respondent."
"The other contention is Lot 4 in Plan No.694 serves as a roadway"
"to  Lots  3,  5-9  and  Lots  311  and  312 
in  Plan  No.1173A"
"(altogether 
eight 
lots). 
The 
Petitioners 
say 
this 
is 
in"
"contravention  of 
the  UDA  Regulations  as  gazetted 
in  P8(a),"
"which  say  the  width  of  a  road  with  less  than  eight  residential"
"units shall be 15 feet.  Lot 4, according to Plan No.694, is 15 feet"
"wide."
"Even  with  the  subdivision  of  Lot  10 
into  two,  the  roadway"
"marked Lot 4 in Plan No.694 serves only eight residential units."
"There is no violation of P8(a)."
"Therefore, I see no reason to quash by certiorari P28, which has"
"been  issued  for  the  residential  development  of  Lot  1  in  Plan"
"No.1363 as one unit."
"By  the  same  token,  I  am  not  inclined  to  quash  Plan  No.1363"
"marked P27 by certiorari. Seeking to quash a Plan by certiorari"
"is, in my view, misconceived in law."
"The next document the Petitioners seek to quash by certiorari is"
"P31."
"P31  is  not  a  residential  development  Permit.    It  is  a  Permit"
"issued  to  grant  permission  to  the  4th  Respondent  to  sub-divide"
"Lot 1 in Plan No.1363."
"The 4th Respondent is a land developer.  He had purchased the"
"larger  land,  namely  Ahalagahawatta,  abutting  Lot  10  in  Plan"
"No.694 to the south, and amalgamated Ahalagahawatta with Lot"
