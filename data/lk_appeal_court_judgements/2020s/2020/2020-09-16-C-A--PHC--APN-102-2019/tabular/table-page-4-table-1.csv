"06.","In  the  instant case,  it had  been  brought to  the  notice  of the  learned  High Court Judge that"
"","the  Petitioner has  pending cases  including a  murder case, and  also,  he  had  once  escaped"
"","from  prison.  However, 
it  was 
submitted  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner, 
that  he  had"
"","surrendered  back  to  the  authorities  and  that  he  was  warned  and  discharged  for  escaping"
"","from  prison,  after 
taking 
into  account 
the  circumstances  under  which  he  escaped."
"","However,  the  fact  remains  that  the  Petitioner  was  on  bail  earlier  for  another  case  of"
"","murder.  He 
is  also  suspected  of  attempting 
to 
take 
ransom  by  making 
threatening"
"","telephone  calls to  victims,  and  such offences are  currently being investigated  into.  It was"
"","submitted  in the objections by  the  Respondent  State that  the  Petitioner has more than  20"
"","cases of this  nature alleged  to  have  been  committed whilst in  remand  custody.  Therefore,"
"","when considering the  number of cases and the alleged offences the Petitioner is  suspected"
"","of,  the  chances  of the  Petitioner committing further  offences  whilst on  bail,  and  also  not"
"","appearing in Court if bail  is granted, is high."
