"equipment,  but  he  was  later  exonerated .  The  witness  was  asked

"narrated  to  the  Police,  as  he  had  it  with  him  in  the  witness  box  at  the  time  of"
"giving evidence.  He had prepared it after returning from  the Police.  He further"
"stated that his child had typed his statement into a  computer but at that time he"
