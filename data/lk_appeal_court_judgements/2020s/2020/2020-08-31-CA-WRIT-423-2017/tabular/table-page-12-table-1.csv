"As seen from 1R2, the main concern of the Technical Evaluation"
"Committee  was  to  award  the  tender  to  the  highest  bidder.   The"
"1st, 2nd, 4th-7th Respondents say in the written submissions “The"
"grand 
total 
of 
the  bid  made  by 
the  9th  Respondent  was"
"Rs.52,920,000,  which  is  Rs.18,240,000  higher  than  the  grand"
"total of the bid made by the Petitioner.”  If the grand total of the"
"bid  is  the  decisive  factor,  disqualifications  need  not  be  set  out."
"Clauses  such  as  7(iii)  of  P16A  are 
incorporated 
into  tender"

the  1st  Respondent 
is  not  a  private"
"enterprise, but a fully government-owned company."
"In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  it  is  clear  the  9th"
"Respondent  is  disqualified  from  being  awarded  the  tender  in"
"view  of  clause  7(iii)  of  P16A,  which  the  Technical  Evaluation"
"Committee failed to consider.  Hence, I take the view it is wrong"
"on the part of the 1st Respondent to have awarded the tender to"
"the 9th Respondent instead of to the Petitioner."
"When  the  Petitioner  filed  this  application  on  11.12.2017,  the"
"Petitioner  was  not  aware  that  the  Agreement  1R1  had  been"
"signed on or around 10.11.2017, awarding the tender to the 9th"
"Respondent."
"I  quash  the  Agreement  marked  1R1,  tendered  with  the  motion"
"dated  24.06.2020,  by  certiorari  and  compel  the  1st  and  the  2nd"
"Respondents by mandamus to award the tender to the Petitioner"
"for five years from the date of signing the Agreement."
