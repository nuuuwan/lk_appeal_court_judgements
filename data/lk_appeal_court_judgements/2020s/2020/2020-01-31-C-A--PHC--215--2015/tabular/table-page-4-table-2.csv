"Similarly, I am  of the view that even  in  applications made under section 66(1)(b) of the Act there"
"is  a statutory duty on the Primary Court Judge to determine and  declare the persons entitled to"
"possession of the land. In  this instant case this has been  done by the learned Civil Appellate High"
"Court Judge which power he has when acting in revision against the Primary Court order. The fact"
"that the Respondent has failed to pray for this relief in the affidavit does not relieve the learned"
"Civil  Appellate High  Court Judge of the statutory duty imposed upon him."
"For the foregoing reasons, with the greatest respect to their lordships in Dias and another v. Dios"
"and another (supra),  I hold that in  a private information filed  under Section  66(1)(b) ofthe Act it"
"is not incumbent on the petitioner to specifically pray for restoration to possession. That is a relief"
"that the  learned  Primary Court Judge  is  under a statutory duty to consider  and  grant after due"
"inquiry."
