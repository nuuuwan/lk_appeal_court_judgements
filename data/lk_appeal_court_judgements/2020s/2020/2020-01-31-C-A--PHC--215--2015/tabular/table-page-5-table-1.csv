"In  any event, the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or"
"der of any court shall  be reversed  or varied on  account of any error, defect or irregularity, which"
"has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice."
"In  the  matter before  Court, the  alleged  defect in  the prayer of the Respondent's  affidavit  does"
"not at any point prejudice the substantial rights of the Appellant or occasion  a failure of justice."
"For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs."
"Parties in  CA(PHC)  APN  149/2015 agreed  to abide by the judgment given  in  CA  (PHC)  215/2015."
"Hence the said  revision application is  also dismissed with costs."
