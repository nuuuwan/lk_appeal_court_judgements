"","The  case  record  bears  testimony  to  the  fact  that  the"
"","appellant was  represented  by  Counsel  throughout  the  case."
"","He has had an opportunity to examine the witnesses against"
"him.  He","too  has  given  evidence  and  his  plea  of  alibi  has"
"been  considered  by","the 
learned  Magistrate.  These 
facts"
"","clearly indicate  that he  was  informed  of his  rights  and  that"
"he has exercised that right and no substantial prejudice was",""
"caused  to","the  appellant.  Thus , 
the  appellant's  contention"
"that he was denied a  fair trial, fails.",""
