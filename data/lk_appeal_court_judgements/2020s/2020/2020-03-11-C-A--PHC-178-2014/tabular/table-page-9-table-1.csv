"J.  has observed."
"""An  alibi  may  broadly  be  described  as  a  plea  of an"
"accused  person  that  he  was  elsewhere  at  the 
time  of the"
"alleged  criminal  act.  What  is  important for present purposes"
"and what needs to  be stressed is that it is a plea which casts"
"doubt on an essential element of the case for the prosecution,"
"namely 
that 
it  was 
the  1s t  appellant  who  committed 
the"
"criminal  act charged. In  other words,  if the jury entertained a"
"to  a  constituent  element  of the 
reasonable  doubt  in  regard"
"offence, 
namely 
the 
criminal 
act( 
factum) 
then 
the

"appellant is entitled to  an acquittal. """
