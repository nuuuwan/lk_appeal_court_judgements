"evidence of PW1  and PW2  they have been in close proximity,"
"and the fact that one person was ahead of the other, has not"
"affected their identifying the assailant."
"The  distance 
from  PW2 's  house 
to  PW 1 's  house 
is"
"about  100  meters  and  the 
incident  occurred  before  PW1"
"reached  his  house.  Then  it  stands  to  reason  that  they  did"
"not have  to  run far  before  the  incident occurred.  The  above"
"mentioned so called contradictory evidence, according to the"
"appellant 
is  also  a  ground  of  appeal  where 
the 
learned"
"Magistrate 
is 
alleged 
to 
have 
failed 
to 
consider 
the"
"infirmities  on  the  evidence  relating  to  identification  of  the"
"appellant."
"PW2  has  clearly  evidenced  that  he  saw  the  appellant"
"attacking  PW 1  and  that  the 
appellant  addressed  him  as"
"""Sudu"" which  is  the  name  he  is  addressed  by  the  villagers."
"This 
fact  was 
not 
challenged  when 
PW2  was 
cross"
"examined.  Therefore,  there was no doubt created about PW2"
"identifying the appellant who is a  neighbor known to him for"
"a  long time."
"In  cross  examination  PW2  has  admitted  that  he  has"
"not  seen  the  appellant  when  he  went  to  Niroshan's  house"
"earlier 
in 
the 
evening. 
However,  he  has  unequivocally"
"evidenced 
that 
it  was 
the  appellant  who  attacked  PWI."
"Nothing  has  been  elicited 
from  PW2, 
that  he  was  either"
"hostile  to  the  accused  or  actuated  by  a  private  grudge  to"
"give  evidence  against  the  appellant.  There  is  not  an  iota  of"
"evidence  to  the contrary that either PW1  or PW2  were not in"
"a  position 
to 
identify  the  assailant. 
It  is  established  that"
"PW2  was  very  close  to 
PW1  and  also  to  the  appellant  and"
"with  the  moonlight  and  electric  light  he  has  identified  the"
