"""It  is  well  established that findings  of primary facts  by a  Trial  Judge  who"
"hears and sees witness are not to  be lightly disturbed on appeal.. """
"Therefore  when  considering the  evidence of the  prosecution  case  it  is  evident that"
"there  is  cogent evidence against the  Accused-Appellant.  When  ring of truth  of the"
"prosecution witnesses  is  available it  is  difficult to challenge the same  by  unreliable"
"and  fallacious  defence taking  up  on  to  create a  reasonable doubt in  the  prosecution"
"case."
"I observe  that the  Learned  High  Court Judge  has  fairly  and  squarely  analysed  the"
"evidence  adduced  before  him  and  delivered  a  well-reasoned  judgment.  I  find  no"
"merit  in  the  ground  of appeal  urged  by  the  Appellant and  therefore  the  ground  of"
"appeal  should  necessarily  fail.  Accordingly  I  have  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the"
"findings of the Learned Trial  Judge."
