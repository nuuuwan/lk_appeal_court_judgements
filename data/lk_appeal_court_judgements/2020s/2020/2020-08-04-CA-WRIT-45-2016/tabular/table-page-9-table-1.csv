"P
rior to considering the above two issues, it would be useful to lay down the"
"provisions of the LRC Law that are relevant to this application. The LRC Law is"
"the  first  law  enacted  under  the  First  Republican  Constitution  of  1972  by  the"
"National State Assembly, and came into operation on 26th August 1972. In its"
"long  title,  the  said  Law  was  stated  to  be  a  ""Law  to  establish  a  Land  Reform"
"Commission,  to  fix  a  ceiling  on  the  extent  of  agricultural  land  that  may  be"
"owned by persons, to provide for the vesting of lands owned in excess of such"
"ceiling  in  the  Land  Reform  Commission,  and  for  such  land  to  be  held  by  the"
"former  owners  on  a  statutory  lease  from  the  Commission,  to  prescribe  the"
"purposes and the manner of disposition by the Commission of agricultural lands"
"vested  in  the  Commission  so  as  to  increase  productivity  and  employment,  to"
"provide  for  the  payment  of  compensation  to  persons  deprived  of  their  lands"
"under this Law and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”"
"W
ith the introduction of the LRC Law, agricultural lands owned by any person"
"in excess of the ceiling stipulated in the LRC Law vested with the Land Reform"
"Commission,  by  operation  of 
law.7  However, 
in  view  of  the  definition  of"
"‘Agricultural 
land’ 
in  Section  66, 
lands  belonging 
to  Viharas  and  Devalas"
"(together  referred  to  as  Temples)  were  excluded  from  the  provisions  of  the"
"LRC Law."
"A
t the time the LRC Law was introduced, in addition to private individuals who"
"owned 
land,  there  were  several  companies,  commonly  known  as 
‘Sterling"
