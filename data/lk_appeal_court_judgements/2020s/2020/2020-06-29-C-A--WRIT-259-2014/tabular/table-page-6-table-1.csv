"In  Thirimavithana  v.  Urban  Development Authority and Others  [(2010)  2 Sri.L.R.  262]  this  Court"
"took the view that where section  18 of the  Urban  Development Authority Act allows the  Urban"
"Development  Authority 
to  alienate  any 
land  or 
interest 
in 
land  with 
the  approval  of  the"
"Minister,  any alienation without such  approval  is  of no avail  in  law even  where the approval  of"
"the Minister has been subsequently obtained."
"Nonetheless, the  Court  did  not give  any  consi deration  on  the  effect  of subsequent  ratification"
"by the Minister.  However, in  Ratnasiri and Others  v. Ellawala and Others  [(2004)  2 Sri.L.R.  180]"
"that  the  Public  Service  Commission  as  well  as  a  Committee  of  the 
Marsoof  J.  PICA  held"
"Commission  or a public officer exercising delegated authority may in  appropriate circumstances"
"ratify  an  order  made  or  action  taken  by  a  public  officer  without  authority  and  that  there  is"
"nothing  in  the  Constitution  or  any  law  to  prevent  the  Respondent  Secretary,  from  making  a"
"decision 
in  regard  to  a  matter  where  some  person  or  body  of  persons  has  previou sly  made"
"some  decision  without  any  authority  to  do  so.  Court  did  refer  to  established  adm ini strative"
"practice of taking urgent action whenever exigencies of the service so demanded and  obtaining"
"necessary covering approval thereafter, a practice  which  is  often  resorted  to and  is  sanctioned"
"by  administrative  procedures  and  judicial  decisions 
[Rajapakse  v.  Tissa  Devendra,  Chairman,"
"Public Service Commission and Others (1999) 2 Sri.L.R. 331]."
"I see  no reason  why this rationale should  not apply in the application of Article  10 of Schedule  E"
"of the  Customs  Ordinance.  The  interest  of  national  economy  may  need  urgent  action  to  be"
"taken there under by the  Minister subject to ratification  by the Cabinet of Mini sters.  Therefore,"
"I  hold  that  the  subsequent  approval  of the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  on  04.09.2014  (X26)  of  the"
"Gazette bearing no. 1857/3 dated 07.04.2014 (X17)  gives it validity."
"Rights of the Parties"
"Nonetheless,  it  is  trite  law  that  rights  of  the  parties  must  be  determined  as  at  the  date  of"
"institution  of proceedings  or action.  [Ponnammah  v.  Arumogam  (8  N.L.R .  223  at  226),  Silva  v."
