"It  is  the  same  in  relation  to the charging of excise  duty. The  Petitioner admits that the alleged"
"excess  excise  duty  has  been  collected  from  the  Petitioner.  Yet,  he  has  not  sought  a  writ  of"
"certiorari  quashing  that  decision.  Instead,  he  ha s sought  writs  of  mandamus  and  prohibition"
"which  relate  to enforcing a statutory or public duty and  pro hibiting a public functionary acting"
"ultra  vires.  But  the  alleged  ultra  vires  act  has  been  already  committed  by  the  customs  by"
"recovering  what  is  alleged  to  be  excess  excise  duty.  That  deci sion  mu st  be  qua shed  before"
"directing the customs to act according to law."
"For all the foregoing reasons,  I dismiss the application of the Petitioner without costs ."
