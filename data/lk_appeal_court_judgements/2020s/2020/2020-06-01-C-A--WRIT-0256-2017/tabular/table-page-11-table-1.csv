"parte would amount to a misrepresentation or suppression of material facts warranting"
"its dissolution without going into the merits""."
"One of the main grounds on which the Petitioner seeks to assail his removal as Chairman of the"
"NCP Council is that none of the 'no confidence motions"" against him was approved to be placed"
"on the agenda by the Select Committee of the NCP Council. It is a material fact on which the"
"Petitioner has sought to mislead Court by suppressing and /or misrepresenting the true facts."
"Hence  this  application  is  liable  to  be  dismissed  on  that  ground  alone  without  going  into  the"
"merits."
"There is further suppression and/or misrepresentation  of material facts by the Petitioner. The"
"Petitioner claims that he was taken by surprise when the second 'no confidence motion' which"
"had been dismissed by the Select Committee of the NCP Council was included in the agenda by"
"the 3rd Respondent for the meeting on 18th July 2017 [paragraph 26 of the petition]."
"It 
is 
inconceivable  how  the  Petitioner  could  have  been  surprised  when  he  had  previously"
"invoked  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the  North  Central  Province  holden  in"
"Anuradhapura 
in  case  no.  15/2017  (3R3)  on  13.07.2017  seeking  to  prevent  the  said 
'no"
"confidence  motion'  being  taken  up  on  18.07.2017.  According  to  paragraph  28  of  the  petition"
"filed  in  that  case  the  Petitioner  was  clearly  aware  of  the  inclusion  of  the  said  motion  in  the"
"agenda for the meeting on 18.07.2017.  This application was  withdrawn on 17.07.2017 by the"
"Petitioner  on  what  is  stated  to  be  technical  grounds.  The  Petitioner  has  suppressed  to  this"
"Court the filing and withdrawal of that application."
"It  also  appears  to  me  that  the  Petitioner 
is  guilty  of  suppression  and/or  misrepresenting"
"material  facts  by  stating  that  even  the  second  'no  confidence  motion'  was  rejected  by  the"
"Select Committee. However, according to the minutes of the Select Committee meeting held on"
"10.07.2017  (6R5)  a  majority  of  the  members  had  indicated  that  the  'no  confidence  motion'"
"should be included in the agenda for the next meeting."
