"In this respect, I wish to advert to the decision in  Moosajees Limited v.  Eksath Engineru Saha"
"Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya [79(I) N.L.R. 285 at 288] where the Court held:"
"""The pleadings in their petition and affidavit do not contain a full disclosure of the real"
"facts of the case and to say the least the Petitioner has not observed the utmost good"
"faith and has been guilty of a lack of uberrima fides by a suppression of material facts in"
"the pleadings. It was neither fair by this court nor by his counsel that there was no full"
"disclosure of material facts."""
