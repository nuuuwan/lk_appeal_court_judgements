"office to substantiate the contents thereof, and thereafter arrive at a determination"
"in terms of the Act."
"I
  shall  now  consider 
‘P20’. 
It 
is  only  a  response  to  the  Attorney-at-Law  of  the"
"Petitioner, informing him of the decisions taken at a meeting of all relevant Officials"
"with regard to the dispute. ‘P20’ does not contain any final decisions, except to state"
"that the  provisions of the  Act must be  complied  with. This Court cannot determine"
"the entitlement of the Viharaya to the land in issue nor can it determine whether the"
"Sannasa / Thudapatha / Seettuwa is genuine. However, in order to ensure that the"
"claim of the Petitioner is not prejudiced, the Commissioner of Title Settlement shall"
"call upon the relevant Officials to substantiate the matters set out in paragraph one"
"of ‘P20’."
"I
 shall now come back to ‘P16’. As already expressed, I have a concern with ‘P16’. The"
"Commissioner  of  Title  Settlement,  acting  solely  upon  the  contents  of 
‘P14’,  has"
"arrived at the conclusion that the land has not been settled in favour of the Viharaya"
"and  that the  Sannasa  /  Thudapatha  / Seettuwa  is a  forged  document which  should"
"not  have  been  acted  upon,  without  conducting  an  investigation  as  required  by  the"
"Act.  This  is  precisely  the  concern  that  I  had  with  the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Lands"
"copying 
‘P14’ 
to 
the  Commissioner  of  Title  Settlement,  which  of  course  was"
"prompted  by  the  7th  Respondent  copying  his  letter  to  the  Commissioner  of  Title"
"Settlement. I am of the view that any conclusion on the authenticity of the Sannasa /"
"Thudapatha 
/  Seettuwa  of 
the  Viharaya  must  be  determined  only  after  an"
"investigation is carried out in terms of Section 13 of the Act, and that the conclusion"
"reached  prior  to  that,  as  reflected  in  ‘P16’,  on  the  genuineness  of  the  title  of  a"
"potential claimant is illegal and therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari."
"T
o  my  mind,  the  procedure  that  should  have  been  followed  in  terms  of  the  Act  is"
"clear. Unfortunately, the unwarranted interference on the part of the Commissioner"
"General of Buddhist Affairs has brought about a situation where the provisions of the"
"Act  have  not  been  adhered  to.  Hence,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Commissioner  of"
"Title Settlement shall, acting in terms of Section 12 of the Act, on receipt of certified"
"copies  of  cadastral  maps  relating  to  the  Viharagama  land  publish  a  Notice  in  the"
"Gazette  (if  it  has  not  already  been  done),  calling  upon  any  claimants  to  the  lands"
"12"
