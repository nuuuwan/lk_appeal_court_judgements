"Ranjith Silva J rejected  this contention and stated;"
"""The  provisions  of the  Evidence  Ordinance  itself have  made a clear"
"distinction  with  regard  to  documentary  evidence  on 
the  one  hand"
"91

real 
evidence 
on 
the  other. 
Section

the  Evidence"
"Ordinance  excludes  parole  evidence  whereas  Section  60(1)  and  (2)"
"of the  Evidence Ordinance enacts  that if the  oral evidence refers  to a"
"fact  which  could  be  seen  or  perceived by  any  other  sense  or  in  any"
"other way,  it must be  the  evidence  of the  witness  who  says  that  he"
"saw  or  perceived  that  fact  by  that  sense  or  in 
that  manner, 
that"
"should be  led  to  prove  that fact,  although  the  Court  may,  if it thinks"
"fit,  require  the  production  of such  material  thing for  its  inspection."
"(Section  165  of the  Evidence  Ordinance)  Thus  the  prosecution  was"
"entitled  to 
lead  oral  evidence  of a witness  without  producing 
the"
"material object."""
