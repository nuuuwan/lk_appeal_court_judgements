"witness  as  per  Gunasekara  v  Director  General,  Commission 
to  Investigate"
"Allegations of BribenJ  or Corruption CA 210/2008 - decided  on 21.06.2011.  The"
"indictment  reads 
the  date  of  offence  as  3rd  March  2006.  The  witness  gave"
"evidence  only  in  October  2015.  There  is  a  gap  of  more  than  nine  years  exists"
"between these two points of time.  Naturally her memory would have faded over"
"the years as to the exact timing."
"In view  of  these  considerations,  the inaccuracies  as  to  the  exact timing of"
"the  calls could  easily  be  understood  as  she had  to  rely  on her  memory to  recall"
"the timings."
"Thus,  it is  clear  there was sufficient evidence that had been led  before  the"
"trial  Court in  relation  to  the calls  initiated  and  received  by  the  witness  Indrani."
"The  Appellant  contended  before 
this  Court 
that  her  attribution  of  certain"
"utterances  to him is  a fabrication.  No contradiction or omission was highlighted"
"by  the Appellant nor he made any suggestion to her that it is a fabrication."
"The acceptance of her claim of making calls and what had been conveyed"
"to  her  by 
the  deceased  as  well  as 
the  Appellant  during  these  calls 
therefore"
"purely depends on her credibility as a witness."
"Whilst directing the jury, the trial Court had addressed them on these lines"
"over the  issue and invited them to consider the question whether it is reasonable"
"to expect such discrepancies in her evidence in such circumstances."
