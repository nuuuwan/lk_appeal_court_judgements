"(a)  
A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st – 5th Respondents to issue"
"the 7th Respondent a permit under the Land Development Ordinance;"
"(
b) 
A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st – 5th Respondents to issue a permit to the"
"Petitioner."
"A
lthough the Petitioner claims that the decision to issue the 7th Respondent a permit"
"is  ultra  vires  the  powers  of  the  1st  Respondent,  it  cannot  be  disputed  that  the  1st"
"Respondent is possessed of the power to issue a permit in respect of lands vested in"
"it.  The  question  that  arises  for  determination 
in  this  application 
is  whether  the"
"decision of the 1st Respondent to grant the 7th Respondent a permit in respect of half"
"of  the  said  land  even  though  the  Petitioner  has  been  selected  in  2003  to  receive a"
"permit in respect of the entirety of the land, is reasonable and rational."
"P
rior to determining the entitlement of the 7th Respondent, the 1st Respondent has"
"conducted  an  inquiry  where  the  statements  of  the  Petitioner,  7th  Respondent  and"
"Nandawathie  had  been  recorded. 
It  had  transpired  at  the  said 
inquiry  that  the"
"Petitioner  as  well  as  the  7th  Respondent  were  living  on  the  said  land,  having  built"
"houses of their own. In fact, in her statement marked ‘1R6’, Nandawathie had stated"
"that  the  Petitioner  had  only  built  one  house,  and  not  two,  as  claimed  by  the"
"Petitioner.  The  1st  Respondent  had  accorded  due  recognition  to  the  fact  that  both"
"the  Petitioner  and  the  7th  Respondent  were  in  possession  of  the  said 
land,  and"
"decided to allocate half share of the property to each of them."
"I
n support of his entitlement, the 7th Respondent has stated that he too lived in the"
"old  house  built  by  their  mother  on  the  said 
land.  He  states  that  Nandawathie"
"informally divided the land into two 20 perch plots, and permitted the two children"
"to build a house on the plots given to each of them. The 7th Respondent states that"
"the  Petitioner  only  built  the  house  bearing  assessment  No.  66  and  states  that  the"
"house bearing assessment No. 67 was built by him. He claims that he has lived in the"
"said house since 1998, except the periods when he was working outside Sri Lanka."
