"n  Ratnasabapathy  Thiruarudchelvam  vs.  Murugupillai  Sinnarajah18  this"
"Court held as follows:"
"“This  Court  is  of  the  view  that compliance  with Section  71(4)  is  a  vital"
"step in the acquisition process stipulated in Part VIII of the Act and that"
"this 
is 
the  only  opportunity 
that  a  person  affected  by 
the 
said"
"determination  would  have,  of  being  informed  of  the  reasons  for  the"
"decision  of  the  Bank,  prior  to  the  Minister  making  a  vesting  order  in"
"terms  of  Section  72.  As  held  by  Lord  Diplock,  susceptibility  to  judicial"
"review under the head 'procedural impropriety' covers the failure by an"
"administrative  tribunal  to  observe  procedural  rules  that  are  expressly"
"laid  down 
in  the 
legislative 
instrument  by  which 
its 
jurisdiction 
is"
"conferred,  even  where  such  failure  does  not 
involve  any  denial  of"
"natural 
justice.19  Therefore,  non-compliance  with  such  a  step  would"
"render  the  entire  process  illegal  and  liable  to  be  quashed  by  way  of  a"
"Writ of Certiorari.”"
