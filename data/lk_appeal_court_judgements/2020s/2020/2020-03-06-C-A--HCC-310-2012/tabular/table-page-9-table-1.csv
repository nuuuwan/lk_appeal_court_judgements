"appellant was  done  only  after  returning  to  PNB.  By  this  time,  he  had  initially"
"founded  his  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  brown  powder  contained  Heroin,"
"upon its smell and his work experience.  The field  test therefore is  meant only to"
"confirm his suspicion that the brown powder contained Heroin."
"The very purpose of conducting field  tests had to  be clearly distinguished"
"from 
the  more 
formal 
scientific  analysis  conducted  by 
the  officers  of 
the"
"Government  Analyst  Department  who  possess  the  required  knowledge  in  the"
"science  of  Chemistry  and 
the  expertise 
to  carry  out 
the 
required  chemical"
"analytical 
tests 
to 
identify  and  quantify 
the  presence  and  concentration  of  a"
"prohibited 
substances 
from 
a 
sample  of 
suspected  production 
item.  The"
"acceptance by IP Nalaka  of having identified  Heroin in all  seven packets  during"
"cross-examination will have to  be considered in this context. His objective was to"
"have his  suspicions justified  by conducting a  field  test on the parcel containing"
"packets of brown powder suspected to contain Heroin."
"It  is  undisputable  that  the  accusation  of  possession  and 
trafficking  of"
"Heroin against the  accused-appellant is  based  on the  report of the Government"
"Analyst.  In  that context,  irrespective  of  the  fact  whether  Heroin  was  identified"
"during field  test or not, the decisive factor  is  the confirmation of the presence of"
"Heroin  in  the  parcel  recovered  from  the  accused-appellant by  the  Government"
"Analyst. In evaluating relative probabilities of the version of events as spoken to"
"by  the  Prosecution  witnesses,  the 
trial  Court  had  to  be  mindful  whether  the"
"initial suspicion of the detecting officer is justified in view of the  results obtained"
"through a  more formal analysis of the production by the Government Analyst at"
"a subsequent stage."
