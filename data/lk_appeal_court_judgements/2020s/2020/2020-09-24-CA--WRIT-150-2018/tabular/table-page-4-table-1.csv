"the  Petitioner’s  action  was  dismissed  by  the  District  Court  for"
"non-compliance  with  section  214(1)  of  the  Pradesheeya  Sabha"
"Act.  One of the main grounds upon which the Petitioner’s action"
"was dismissed by the District Court was the failure on the part"
"of the  Petitioner to  prove construction  of a new road across his"
"lands.    The  appeal  filed  in  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  was"
"also dismissed, albeit on the said technical ground."
"The  Petitioner  had  thereafter  filed  a  writ  application  bearing"
"No.CA/WRIT/257/2015  on  the  same  issue,  but  it  appears  the"
"application was later withdrawn."
"The  three  Counsel  appearing  for  separate  Respondents  state  in"
"unison that the facts of this matter are in dispute and therefore"
"this  Court  has  no  option  but 
to  dismiss 
the  Petitioner’s"
"application.  There is force in this argument."
"The main question  appears to me to be the identification of the"
"disputed road.  It is still unclear where exactly this road is. The"
"learned  District  Judge 
in  the  aforementioned  case  was  also"
"confronted  with  the  same  predicament.    The  Petitioner  has  not"
"identified  the  disputed  part  of  the  road,  which  he  says  runs"
"across  his 
land,  by  way  of  a  Plan. 
  He  alleges 
the  1st-4th"
"Respondents  are  constructing  a  road  on  his  land  depicted  in"
"Plan P1B. But no such road is shown on this Plan although the"
"Petitioner  has 
tendered 
several  photographs  compendiously"
"marked P12 showing the alleged construction. The Court cannot"
"assume  that  what  is  shown  in  those  photographs  is  the  road"
"being  constructed  across  the  Petitioner’s  land  depicted  in  P1B."
"The  difficulty 
relating 
to 
the 
identification  of 
the 
road 
is"
