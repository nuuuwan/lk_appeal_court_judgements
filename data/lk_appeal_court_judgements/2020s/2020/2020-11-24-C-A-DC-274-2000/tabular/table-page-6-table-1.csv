"Like other tribunals he may go wrong on  a question of fact, but it is a cogent circumstance"
"that  a judge  of  first  instance,  when  estimating  the  value  of  verbal  evidence,  has  the"
"advantage  (which  is  denied  to  Court  of Appeal)  of having  the  witnesses  before  him  and"
"observing the manner in  which their evidence is given."""
"The  Learned  District Judge's findings  in  the instant case  does not warrant interference by"
"the Appellate Court."
"The judgement of the learned Trial Judge is affirmed. I therefore dismiss the Appeal of the"
"Plaintiff Appellant, with costs ."
