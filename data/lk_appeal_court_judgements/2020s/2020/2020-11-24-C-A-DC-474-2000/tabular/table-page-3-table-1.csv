"This Partition action was filed in the DC,  on the 28.01.1992 and  proceeded for trial. Judgment"
"was  delivered  on  the  14.08.1996. The  1st  and  3,d  Defendants,  appealed  against  the  said"

"The  main  issue  in  this case  is  whether the aforesaid land should  be  partitioned by  relying on"

"Appellants.  The  Plaintiff  Respondent  has  discharged  his  burden  by  submitting  title  deeds"
"produced and  marked as  P1 to P4 to prove that he  is  entitled to undivided 126/168 share."
"The Appellants challenged the aforesaid pedigree of the Plaintiff by pleading that the original"
"owner of the  property  was  one  Dingirala,  who  was  governed  by the  Kandyan  Law.  He  died"
"leaving 4 children  namely Kiribanda,  Ungurala,  Uppuhamy and  Singngappu and  according to"
"the statement of claim ofthe1 st and  3,d  Defendants, they have  referred to several title deeds"
"and pleaded that the 1st Defendant is entitled to undivided 16/42 share and the 3,d  Defendant"
"is entitled to undivided 5/42 share, subject to the life interest of the 1st  Defendant."
"The  Plaintiff Respondent further states that the deeds produced and  marked as 1D4 and 1D6"
"dated  28.04.1954,  Abraham  and  Lewis  who  are  children  of  Ungurala  and  Lokuhamy  have"
"transferred their rights as  inherited from their parents to Punchibanda,  whereas their father"
"Lokohamy  by  deed  produced  and  marked  as  1D1  dated  29.12.1954  transferred  undivided"
"1/4th of his rights to Punchibanda, Martin Singho and Themanis."
"In view of the above  Deed,  produced and  marked as  1D1, Lokuhamy was live on 29.12.1954,"
"at least 8 months after Deeds  No.1D3 and  1D6 were executed on  28.04.1954, on the ground"
"that they inherited parental  rights when their father Lokuhamy was living."
"Therefore, it was argued that Abraham  and  Lewis cannot transfer paternal inheritance by the"
"said  deeds,  as their father was  living."
