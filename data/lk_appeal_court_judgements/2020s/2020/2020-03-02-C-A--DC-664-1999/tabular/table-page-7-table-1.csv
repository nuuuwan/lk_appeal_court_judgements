"In view of the above, I hold that the word ""shall"" used in section 19(2) of the Partition Law should"
"be  read  as  mandatory and  that it is  imperative on  the part of a defendant who  claims  that the"
"plaintiff is  seeking to partition only a portion  of a larger land  to follow the  procedure laid  down"
"in section 19(2) of the Partition Law and move for the larger land to be  partitioned. He cannot ask"
"for dismissal  of the action. Such  a course of action  is fair by all  parties as  it does  not deprive the"
"defendant of getting the larger land partitioned ."
