"""The  hallmark  of a vexatious  proceeding  is  in  my judgment"
"that  it has  little or  no  basis  in  law  (or  at least no discernible"
"basis);  that whatever the intention of the  proceedings may be,"
"is 
its  effect 
to 
subject 
the  defendant 
to 
inconvenience,"
"harassment  and  expenses  out  of all  proportion 
to  any  gain"
"likely to accrue  to  the claimant; and  that it involves an  abuse"
"of the  process of the  Court,  meaning by  that use of the  Court"
"process  for  a  purpose  or  in  a  way  which 
is  significantly"
"different  from 
the  ordinary  and  proper  use  of  the  Court"
"process. """
