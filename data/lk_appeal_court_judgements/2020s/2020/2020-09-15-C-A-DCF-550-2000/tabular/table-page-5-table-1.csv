"5"
"t
ransferred to the Plaintiff by P8 in 1988 was an undivided half"
"of the (remaining portion of) land, i.e. ½ acre of the land, thereby"
"leaving  another  ½  acre  intact,  which,  in  my  view,  belongs  to"
"William Silva."
"According 
to 
the  Plan  marked  P6, 
the  Defendants  are 
in"
"possession  of  Lot  1  and  they  live  in  the  old  house  standing"
"thereon.    The  surveyor  in  his  report  prepared  in  1990  says  the"
"house is about 30 years old.  This is the house William Silva had"
"been living in with his family.  The 1st and 2nd Defendants have"
"been living in this house after marriage."
"There  is  no  evidence  to  say  the  Defendants  came  to  the  said"
"house on 10.11.1982 with the leave and license of Chandrasena."
"P14 dated 02.03.1988 sent by the 1st Defendant to Chandrasena"
"the day after the execution of Deed marked P8 dated 01.03.1988"
"is  not  irreconcilable  with  the  above  position  because  what  was"
"sought to be transferred by P8 was not the entire land but part"
"of 
it,  which 
is  different 
from  the  portion  of 
land  where  the"
"Defendants were and still are residing."
"The learned District Judge in his Judgment has not, in my view,"
"analysed the facts of the case from the proper perspective.  I set"
"aside  the  said  Judgment  and  allow  the  appeal  with  costs.    The"
"Plaintiff’s action in the District Court shall stand dismissed."
