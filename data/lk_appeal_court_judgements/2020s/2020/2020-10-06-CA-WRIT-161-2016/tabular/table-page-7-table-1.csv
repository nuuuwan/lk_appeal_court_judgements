"nomination or cancellation is duly registered before the date of the death of the owner"
"of the holding or the permit-holder.”"
"T
he above decision of the Supreme Court supports the argument of the learned Senior"
"State  Counsel 
that  not  only  should 
the  nomination  be 
registered,  but 
that 
the"
"registration must take place during the lifetime of the permit holder or the owner. In the"
"absence of such registration, and in view of the mandatory nature of Sections 54, 56 and"
"60 
in 
the  overall  scheme  of 
the  Ordinance, 
I  agree  with 
the  submission  of 
the"
"Respondents that the nomination of Manamperige Hamina is not valid."
"W
here  does 
that 
leave  Manamperige  Hamina  with 
regard 
to 
the  said 
lands?  A"
"determination  of  that  question  brings  me  to  the  second  reason  urged  by  the  learned"
"Senior State Counsel for the issuance of ‘P15’, which is that Manamperige Hamina only"
"had the rights of a lifeholder."
"A
s  I  have  noted  earlier,  at  the  time  Hendrick  Appuhamy  died,  he  had  been  issued  the"
"Grant  ‘P9’  in  respect  of  the  highland  in  addition  to  the  Permit  ‘P1’  in  respect  of  the"
"paddy land."
"I
n terms of Section 48A(1), “Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or"
"her  death  was  required  to  pay  any  annual  installments  by  virtue  of  the  provisions  of"
"subsection 
(2)  of 
section  19,  notwithstanding  default 
in 
the  payment  of 
such"
"installments,  the  spouse  of  that  permit-holder,  whether  he  or  she  has  or  has  not  been"
"nominated  as  successor  by  that  permit-holder,  shall  be  entitled  to  succeed  to  the  land"
"alienated  to  that  permit-holder  on  the  permit  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of  that"
"permit shall be applicable to that spouse”. Thus, in the absence of the registration of the"
"nomination, all that Manamperige Hamina was entitled to with regard to the paddy land"
"was to succeed to the said land and occupy the said land by virtue of being the spouse"
"of Hendrick Appuhamy. By virtue of being only a life-holder, Manamperige Hamina did"
"not have the power to nominate a successor, as clearly laid down in Section 48A(2)(b)."
"Thus,  the  nomination  of  the  1st  Petitioner  as  her  successor  by  way  of  her 
last  will"
"marked ‘P2’ is not valid in terms of the law."
