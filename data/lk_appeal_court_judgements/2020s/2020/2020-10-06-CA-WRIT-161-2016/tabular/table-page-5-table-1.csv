"Petitioner in respect of the paddy land."
"E
ven  though  the  Respondents  have  not  made  available  to  this  Court  the  letter  dated"
"15th March 2016, the learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the decision in ‘P15’"
"recalling the permit and grant issued to the 1st Petitioner was done for two reasons. The"
"first is that the nomination of Manamperige Hamina had not been registered in the Land"
"Ledger, and therefore her nomination as a successor is not valid. The second is that, in"
"these circumstances, Manamperige Hamina was only a lifeholder of the said lands and"
"therefore  she  had  no  power  to  nominate  a  successor,  either  through  a  last  will  or"
"through a nomination made under the Ordinance."
