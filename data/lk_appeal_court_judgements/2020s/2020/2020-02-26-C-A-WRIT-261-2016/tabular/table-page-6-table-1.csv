"gave  only  15  days  to  vacate.  In  the  words  of  De  Smith"
"“breach of procedural or formal rules is likely to be treated"
"as  a  mere  irregularity  if  no  substantial  prejudice  has  been"
"suggested  by 
those 
for  whose  benefit 
the  requirements"
"were introduced.”"
"The  notice  to  quit  is  dated  10.10.83.  The  application  for"
"ejectment  was  filed  on  24.1.84,  i.e.  the  Petitioner  had  106"
"days  to  move  out  before  legal  proceedings  were  instituted."
"In  addition,

own

the"

the

"introduced. In my view, the requirement in s. 3(1) of Act, No."
"7  of  1979,  that  a  minimum  of  30  days  be  given  to  vacate"
"must  be 
treated  as  directory  and 
there  has  been  a"
"substantial  compliance  with  the  time  requirement  specified"
"in s. 3(1) of the Act."
