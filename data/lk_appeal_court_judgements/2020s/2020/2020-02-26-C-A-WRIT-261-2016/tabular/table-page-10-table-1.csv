"I
 reject the second argument of the Petitioner."
"The third argument is in relation to the name of the party to be"
"ejected  as  described  in  the  Notice  to  Quit.    The  party  on  whom"
"Notice to Quit was served is Victory Silk Stores.  The Petitioners"
"to this application are the partners of that partnership business."
"Learned 
President’s  Counsel 
for 
the 
Petitioners, 
drawing"
"attention 
to 
the  provisions  of 
the  State  Lands 
(Recovery  of"
"Possession)  Act,  argues  that  the  words  used  are  “persons”  and"
"“his  dependents”  and  therefore  Notice  shall  be  addressed  to  a"
"natural  person.    If  this  argument  is  to  prevail,  incorporated"
"bodies who can sue and be sued are also not covered.  It is true"
"that  a  partnership  is  neither  a  natural  nor  a  juristic  person."
"Nevertheless, section 2(s) of the Interpretation Ordinance, No. 21"
"of 1901, as amended, states that “person” includes any body of"
"persons  corporate  or  unincorporate. 
  A  partnership 
is  an"
"unincorporated body.  Hence there is no legal obstacle to serve a"
"Notice  to  Quit  on  the  partnership. 
  All  the  correspondence,"
"including  payment  receipts,  which  the  Petitioners  heavily  rely"
"on,  are  in  the  name  of  the  partnership  and  not  in  the  name  of"
"the  partners.    No  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  Petitioners"
"thereby. 
  When 
the  UDA  sent 
letters 
in 
the  name  of 
the"
"partnership, 
the  Petitioners  being 
the  partners  have  readily"
"responded. 
  The  Petitioners  have 
even 
responded 
to 
the"
"summons  directed  on  the  partnership  and  submitted  to  the"
"jurisdiction 
of 
the  Magistrate’s  Court.  Vide 
Jayasinghe 
v."
"Gnanawathie Menike [1997] 3 Sri LR 410, W.M. Mendis & Co. v."
"Excise Commissioner [1999] 1 Sri LR 351."
"I am not inclined to agree with the third submission as well."
