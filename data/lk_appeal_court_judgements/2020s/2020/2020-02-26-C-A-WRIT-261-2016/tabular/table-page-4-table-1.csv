  It 
is  the  submission  of 
learned  Senior"
"Deputy  Solicitor  General  that  there  is  no  legal  requirement  to"
"attach  a  Plan  to  the  Notice  to  Quit,  and  what  is  necessary  is"
"identification  of  the  corpus.   If  the  property  can  be  identified,  a"

  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General"
"referred 
to  several  correspondences  between 
the  UDA  and"
"Victory  Silk  Stores,  where  10/1  and  10/4  of  Dharmapala"
"Mawatha,  Colombo  3  (which  are  admittedly  the  two  buildings"
"from which eviction is sought) have been clearly identified.  Even"
"the  P6  sketch―the  Petitioners’  own  document―clearly  identifies"
"10/1  and  10/4  of  Dharmapala  Mawatha,  Colombo  3. 
  The"
"District Court action previously filed by the Petitioners is also in"
"respect of 10/1 and 10/4 of Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 3."
"Hence there is absolutely no question in identifying the property"
"without  a  Plan.    In  reply,  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioners stated that what matters is not whether the property"
"from which eviction is sought can be identified but whether the"
"Quit Notice is valid in law."
"This  argument  is  purely  technical  and  has  nothing  to  do  with"
"the merits of the application."
"The  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  was  passed  to"
"recover possession of State lands from persons in unauthorised"
"possession 
expeditiously. 
 
The 
procedure 
is 
simple 
and"
"straightforward.  There is no place for high technical objections"
"which will defeat the purpose of the Act.  Vide Gunaratne (Alexis"
