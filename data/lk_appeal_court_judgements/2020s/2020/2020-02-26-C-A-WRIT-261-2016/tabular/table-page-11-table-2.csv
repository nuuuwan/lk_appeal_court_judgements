"In  Siddeek  v.  Jacolyn  Seneviratne  [1984]  1  Sri  LR  83  at  90,  the"
"Supreme Court observed:"
"It is necessary at this stage to bear in mind that certiorari is"
"a  discretionary  remedy—see  Wade:  “Administrative  Law”"
"5th Ed.  (1982)  pp.  546,  591.  As  de  Smith  says  in  his  work"
"“Judicial Review of Administrative Action” 4th Ed. (1980) p."
"404: “Thus, certiorari is a discretionary remedy and may be"
"withheld  if  the  conduct  of  the  applicant,  or,  it  would  seem,"
"the nature of the error does not justify judicial intervention”."
"The  Court  will  have  regard  to  the  special  circumstances  of"
"the case before it before issuing a writ of certiorari. The writ"
"of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result will"
"be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality."
