nnexed  to  ‘P32’ was  a sketch of  a plan prepared  by the  Petitioner, showing"
"the amalgamation of Lot Nos. 1 - 5, 9 and 10 of ‘P11’ into a single lot marked"
"‘A’. Thus, on the Petitioner’s own admission in ‘P32’, and as evidenced by the"
"Petitioner’s  own  sketch  annexed  thereto,  the  claim  of  the  Petitioner  was"
"limited to Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 of ‘P11’. Very importantly, the Petitioner"
"had no issues either with the boundaries depicted in ‘P11’ or with the extent of"
"land that the Petitioner was entitled to, as set out in ‘P11’."
