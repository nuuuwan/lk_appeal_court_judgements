"compensation  must  be  calculated  as  at  the  date  on  which  the  notice  under"
"Section 7 is published. Given the factual circumstances of this application, the"
"Acquiring  Officer  clearly  erred,  and  in  fact  acted  wrongfully  and  irrationally"
"when he published a fresh Section 7 notice (vide ‘P48’) when a valid Section 7"
"notice ‘P12’ already existed. The error having been pointed out to him, it is my"
"view that not only was it within the power of the Acquiring Officer, but he was"
"also  required  in  terms  of  the  Act  to  cancel  the  second  Section  7  notice  (vide"
"‘P48’), and take steps to publish an amendment to the first Section 7 notice, by"
"substituting  Lot No.  12  for  Lot  Nos.  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  9  and  10.  Such  a  decision  is"
"neither ultra vires nor illegal, and is a manifestation of the provisions of Section"
"7."
