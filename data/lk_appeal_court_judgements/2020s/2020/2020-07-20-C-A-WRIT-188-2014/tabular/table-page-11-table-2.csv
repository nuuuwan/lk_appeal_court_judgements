"11 of ‘P11’;"
"I
  have  examined  the  petition  filed  in  the  aforesaid  application,  marked  ‘P29’,"
"and observe that the Petitioner had complained that ‘P11’ had been prepared"
"in  callous disregard  for the  Petitioner’s interests and  that ‘P11’ widely differs"
"from ‘P7’. The issue appears to be the depiction of the Petitioner’s land in ‘P11’"
"as several lots, as opposed to two lots in ‘P7’, which the Petitioner claims has"
"been done without any reason, and has adversely affected his rights. It is noted"
"that the Petitioner had no objection to his land being depicted as separate lots"
"in ‘P7’, but appears to have taken up issue with the further division of the said"
"lots  in  ‘P11’.  It  is  on  this  basis  that  the  Petitioner  was  seeking  to  quash  Plan"
"‘P11’,  and  the  Section  7  notice  ‘P12’.  It  is  noted  further  that  other  than  this"
"objection, the Petitioner does not appear to have had an issue with the extent"
"of the land depicted in the two plans."
