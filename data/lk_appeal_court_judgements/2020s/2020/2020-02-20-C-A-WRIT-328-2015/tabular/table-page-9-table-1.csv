"Mahaweli Authority, as held out by the Mahaweli Authority."
"This 
is 
in  my  view  an  unusual  extension  of  the  concept  of"
"legitimate  expectation.  Can 
legitimate  expectation  pass 
to  a"
"number  of  people  over  a  period  of  time?    Does  it  pass  with  the"
"land  arguably  like  praedial  servitudes?    These  are  questions"
"which can be left open to be decided in a future case."
"In the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not need to go"
"so  far.    The  1st  Petitioner  on  whom  Notice  to  Quit  has  been"
"served,  which  he 
seeks 
to 
quash  by 
certiorari 
in 
these"
"proceedings,  has  not  established 
that  he  had  grounds 
for"
"legitimate expectation that the Mahaweli Authority would convey"
"the land in question to the liquidators of the Company and  the"
"liquidators would convey the land to the late husband of the 2nd"
"Petitioner  and  the  said  husband  would  thereafter  convey  the"
"land to him.  No nexus acceptable to this Court has been shown."
"The Agreement which the Petitioner relies on to make a claim on"
"legitimate  expectation  to  the  land  described  in  the  Quit  Notice"
"has  nothing  to  do  with  the  land  in  the  Crown  Grant  which  is"
"said to have been submerged."
"Application dismissed with costs."
