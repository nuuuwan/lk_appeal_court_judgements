"T
he  Petitioners’  story,  in  my  view,  is  not  rational  and  is  not"
"based  on  accepted  or  acceptable  facts  but  on  conjectures  and"
"hypotheses."
"No 
legitimate  expectation  which  could 
form  the  basis 
for  a"
"prerogative  writ  could  have  been  had  by  the  Petitioners  on  the"
"facts elicited by them in the petition."
"There  is  no  nexus  between  the  Petitioners  and  the  Mahaweli"
"Authority  for  the  former  to  have  such  expectation  arising  from"
"what the latter is alleged to have represented."
"Let  me  unfold  the  case  of  the  Petitioners  as  set  out  by  them  in"
"the petition."
"By virtue of the Crown Grant marked P2(a) dated 16.02.1970, a"
"land in extent of 20 Acres 1 Rood and 15 Perches, described in"
"the  schedule  thereto,  was  conveyed  to  a  Company  known  as"
"Kandy  Textile  Industries  Limited,  which  is  not  a  party  to  this"
"application.    What  has  been  conveyed  by  the  Crown  Grant  is"
"admittedly a different portion of land and has nothing to do with"
"the land described in the Quit Notice."
"Parts of the said land belonging to the said Company, according"
"to 
the 
Petitioners, 
had 
subsequently 
been 
flooded 
and"
"permanently  submerged  by  an  overflow  of  the  Mahaweli  river"
"and/or 
been 
earmarked 
for 
acquisition 
by 
the  Mahaweli"
"Authority.    This  the  Petitioners  state  mainly  based  on  P2(b)"
"dated 18.12.1981."
"P2(b)  is  the  principal  document  of  the  Petitioners’  case.    Based"
"on  P2(b), 
the  Petitioners  state 
that 
the  Mahaweli  Authority"
"agreed  to  give  the  said  Company  an  alternative  plot  of  land"
