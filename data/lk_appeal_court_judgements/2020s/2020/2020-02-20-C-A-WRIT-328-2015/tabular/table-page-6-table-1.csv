"b
ehind  the  then  existing  site  of  the  Company,  as  constituting"
"“part  of  compensation 
for  the 
lands  which  are  submerged”,"
"which includes the land described in the Quit Notice."
"There 
is  no  acceptable  evidence 
to  suggest 
that 
the 
land"
"described  in  the  Quit  Notice  formed  part  of  the  said  alternative"
"plot  of  land  promised  to  the  Company.    Nor  is  there  evidence"
"that the Company was placed in possession of such plot of land"
"by the Mahaweli Authority or that the Company developed such"
"plot of land."
"The Company went into liquidation and the District Court made"
"an  Order  winding  up  the  Company  under  the  provisions  of  the"
"Companies Act in the year 2000, as seen from P2(c)."
"Then the Petitioners state that the liquidators sold the aforesaid"
"submerged portion of the land described in the Crown Grant to"
"four people, including the late husband of the 2nd Petitioner, for"
"a sum as high as Rs. 13.5 million in 2005 by deed marked P2(f)."
"This  deed  is  also  a  key  document  to  the  Petitioners’  case.    The"
"contents  of  this  deed  are  utterly  confusing  to  me.    It  speaks  of"
"various  transactions  among  the  parties  and  refers  to  several"
"Plans,  sub-divisions  etc.    I  cannot  understand  how  and  why  a"
"liquidator  who  sells  the  assets  of  the  Company  would  want  to"
"get 
involved 
in 
the 
internal  affairs  of 
the  parties,  such  as"
"subdividing  land  among  the  parties.  The  schedule  of  the  deed"
"refers to Plan No.1483 dated 20.10.1993, which is different from"
"the Plan referred to in the Crown Grant marked P2(a).  No such"
"new  Plan  has  been  tendered  to  the  Court  to  understand  the"
"nexus."
