"alleging that the 4th Respondent ‘has tabled and got approval of the Board to"
"the said Board Paper arbitrarily, without following due process or procedure or"
"by obtaining the approval of the Ministry of Finance.’1"
"T
he Petitioner states that the increase of the gratuity to one month’s salary for"
"each  year  of  completed  service  had  been  queried  by  the  Auditor  General  on"
"the  basis  that  such  an  increase  is  contrary  to  the  provisions  of  the  Act.  It"
"appears 
that 
the  Auditor  General  has  not 
taken 
into  consideration 
the"
"provisions of Section 10 (1) of the Act which provides for such an increase. The"
"issues arising from the said audit query had been discussed by the Board of the"
"Petitioner at a meeting held on 11th May 2016. According to the minutes of the"
"said meeting marked ‘P16’, the representative of the Secretary to the Treasury"
"on the Board of the Petitioner had stated that, he ‘was of the view that since"
"the  Company 
is  already  awarding 
incentives  to  the  employees  the  current"
"method of  payment of  the  full  one month’s salary as gratuity  is  unsuited and"
"will create an unnecessary precedent to other companies as well. Thereafter he"
"added that if a full one month’s salary is paid as gratuity, then the incentives"
"should not be paid.’  This demonstrates that the members of the Board did not"
"consider  the  payment  of  the  enhanced  gratuity  as  illegal,  or  as  an  arbitrary"
"decision taken by the 4th Respondent. The Board had decided that the Circular"
"‘1R4B’ be declared null and void and to pay gratuity calculated at half months"
"salary for each year of completed service to those employees who retire after"
"25th  April  2016,  which  is  the  date  that  the  Petitioner  had  received  the  letter"
"from  the  Auditor  General.  Circular  No.  KP/2016/10  marked  ‘P17’  had  been"
"issued to implement the said decision with effect from 25th April 2016."
"T
he  initial  contract  of  appointment  ‘P4’  stipulated  that  the  4th  Respondent"
"shall  be  paid  an  all 
inclusive  monthly  salary  of  Rs.  70,000.  The
