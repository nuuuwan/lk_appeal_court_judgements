"divisional bench of this Court had held as follows:"
"“When  gratuity  payable  to  an  employee 
is  higher  than  the  statutory"
"minimum, it is governed by any other agreement as in the case in hand. If"
"it is so gratuity should be computed in accordance with such agreement,"
"and  the  employer  would  be  estopped  from  denying  such  benefit  to  an"
"employee.  The  scheme  of  the  Act  contemplates  in  a  broad  sense  two"
"options.  (a)  The  statutory  minimum  of  ½  month  salary  for  each,  year  of"
"service. 
(b)  An  enhanced  payment  of  gratuity  based  on  any  other"
"agreement  between  the  employer  and  employee.  It  could  also  be  on  a"
"collective agreement or award. I observe that both (a) and (b) above fall"
"within the four corners of the statute. To enter into 'any other agreement'"
"is  recognized  by  the  payment  of  Gratuity  Act  itself  and  to  provide  for"
"payment  of  enhanced  gratuity.  ....  I  would  go  further  in  this  regard  and"
"state it is a 'right' of an employee and not a privilege. As such an employee"
"or  workman  would  have  a 
legitimate  expectation 
for  payment  of"
"enhanced gratuity which cannot be exploited/denied by the employer, on"
"any account. I cannot accept and agree with the views expressed contrary"
"to above on behalf of the Petitioner Bank.”"
