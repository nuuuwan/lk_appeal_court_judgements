"It would thus be seen that the 4th Respondent has been given periodical salary"
"increments  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Petitioner.  Quite  apart  from"
"whether  the  Board  had  the  power  to  grant  such  increments,  the  fact  of  the"
"matter  is  that  the  Petitioner  has  suppressed  this  fact  from  this  Court,  and  it"
"was left to the 4th Respondent to produce documents to establish that at least"
"part  of  the  increments  were  approved  and  granted  by  the  Board.  The  next"
"matter  that 
is  evident  by  the  above  documents 
is  that 
it  was  not  the  4th"
"Respondent  who  in  violation  of  applicable  financial  regulations  increased  his"
"salary,  but  it  was  the  Board  who  increased  his  salary.  Thus,  the  allegation"
"made in  the  written  submissions filed  on behalf  of  the  Petitioner that the 4th"
"Respondent, as the former Chief Executive Officer has arbitrarily overdrawn his"
"salary  during  his  tenure  of  office 
is  contradicted  by  the  Petitioner’s  own"
"documents. There is another important matter that this Court must advert to,"
"which 
is  the  fact  that  the  Treasury  was  represented  on  the  Board  by 
its"
"nominee  director,  and  that  such  director  was  present,  at 
least  when  the"
"decisions marked ‘4R7’, ‘4R10’ and ‘4R12’ were taken."
