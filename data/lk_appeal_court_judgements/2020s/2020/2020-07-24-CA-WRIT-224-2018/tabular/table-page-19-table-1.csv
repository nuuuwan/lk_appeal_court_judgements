"In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the 1st Respondent was right"
"when he arrived at the finding in ‘P25’ that  the increase in gratuity granted by"
"‘1R4B’ cannot be withdrawn unilaterally and that the 4th Respondent must be"
"paid  gratuity  at  the  rate  of  one  month’s  salary  for  each  year  of  completed"
"service. Therefore, I am of the view that the decision of the 1st Respondent in"
"‘P25’  that  the  4th  Respondent  should  be  paid  gratuity  in  terms  of  ‘1R4B’  is"
"neither illegal nor ultra vires the powers of the 4th Respondent."
