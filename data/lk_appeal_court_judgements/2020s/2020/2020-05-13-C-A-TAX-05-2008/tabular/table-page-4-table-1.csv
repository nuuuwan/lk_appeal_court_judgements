"In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Saverimuttu Retty (Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol. I, page"
"103 at 109) Abrahams C.J. did make a similar statement by stating:"
"“Incidentally there was no reference to us on this point by the Board of Review, since"
"that point was not put to the Board when they were called upon to adjudicate in appeal,"
"but we are not, of course precluded from considering any point upon which the actual"
"decision of the Board might be upheld, no matter what might have been their reasons"
"for arriving at that decision”."
