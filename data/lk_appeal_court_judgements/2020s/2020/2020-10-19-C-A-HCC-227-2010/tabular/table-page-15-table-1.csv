"","Archbold,  2015  Ed  at p.46  para 19-72  of  its  supplement,  states  under  the"

"","Returning  to  the  appeal  under  consideration, 
the  Appellant  before  this"
"","Court  seeks 
to  rely  on  the  violent  history  between  him  and 
the  deceased  in"
"","justifying  the  application  of  the  plea  of  cumulative  provocation.  During  her"
"","submissions, 
learned  Counsel  for 
the  Appellant  stressed 
the  point 
that 
the"
"","deceased  had  continuously  harassed  the  Appellant  and  had  displayed  violent"
"","conduct towards him."
"","In  view  of  her  submissions, 
it  is 
relevant 
to  examine 
the  evidence  in"
"","relation to the alleged history of violence between the two."
"","The  Appellant,  in  his  dock  statement  stated  that  the  deceased  used 
to"
"","physically assault whenever they met and due to a violent attack by the deceased"
"","the  Appellant had  lost a  few  teeth.  He also  referred  to  an incident in which  the"
"","deceased had mounted an attack on him and tried to grab his weapon, aided by a"
"","group of persons."
"","These  assertions  of  the  Appellant  were  rejected  by  the  trial  Court  since"
"","none of these were ever put to any of the lay prosecution witnesses during cross"
"","examination and raised only during his statement from the dock, rather belatedly"
"","at the tail end of the case.  In  applying the test of consistency  the  trial Court had"
"","rejected these assertions on the basis of its credibility and reliability."
