"","In support of the first ground of appeal, leaned Counsel contended that the"
"","judgment of the trial Court does not indicate the reasons for rejecting the defence"
"","of  accident,  although  the  Court  merely  states  that  it  had  rejected  what  the"
"","Appellant said  in his  statement and  the  dock  statement does  not  raise  a  doubt"
"","about the prosecution case."
"","However,  it is  evident upon  the perusal of the  impugned judgment,  that"
"","the 
trial  Court  had 
in  fact  devoted  a 
separate  section  under 
the  heading"
"","evaluation  of  the  dock  statement,  in  which  the  Court had  applied  the  tests  of"
"","consistency and probability on the claim of accidental shooting and decided that"
"","the said claim had failed  in both these tests.  It had been noted by the  trial  Court"
"","that 
the  Appellant  had  not  suggested 
the  claim  of  accidental  shooting 
to"
"","prosecution  witnesses,  particularly  to 
the  medical  expert  who  opined  that  the"
"","deceased  was shot at from  his back and from a  distance. 
In applying the  test of"
"","probability  the  trial Court had  tested  the claim of the  Appellant as it considered"
"","his claim of attempted attack on him by the deceased. The trial Court noted  that"
"","the  pole  deceased  had  with  him 
is  only  4  feet  in  length  and 
to  attack 
the"
"","Appellant,  the  deceased  must be  in front  of the  Appellant,  facing  him  within a"
"","distance  of at least 6  feet.  But  the  medical evidence points  to  a  totally  different"
"","position. The Court also noted  that the angle of the bullets that had  pierced  the"
"","deceased  body  does not  tally  with  the  position  taken  by  the  Appellant that his"
"","gun went off when he was  in bended  position and  excluded  the probability  of"
"","accidental shooting. It is significant to note in this context that the Appellant had"
"","opted not to cross-examine the medical expert at all."
"","The defence of accident, as it is generally referred  to,  is one of the general"
"","exceptions to  criminal  liability recognised  in Chapter IV  of the Penal Code,  and"
"","described in Section 73 of the Penal Code. The section reads thus;"
