"S
econdly, the Petitioner says the Order was made in violation of"
"the principles of natural justice inasmuch as the Petitioner was"
"not  given  an  opportunity 
to  produce  evidence 
that 
the  3rd"
"Respondent  was  never  an  employee  of  the  Petitioner  company."
"The principal submission of the  Petitioner  at the argument was"
"that  the 
impugned  Order  on  gratuity  was  made  without  an"
"inquiry.    This  is  belied  by  the  Petitioner’s  own  documents.    In"
"paragraph 14 of the statement of objections, the 1st Respondent,"
"having  admitted  that  the  gratuity  claim  was  not  inquired  into"
"due  to  an  oversight  at  the  first  inquiry,  states  in  subparagraph"
"(iv)  “Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  was  summoned  for  inquiry  and"
"several occasions the inquiry was held and parties were allowed"
"Although 
the 
to 
file 
their 
respective  written  submissions”."
"Petitioner  in  the  counter  affidavit  denies  this  and  emphatically"
"states no written submissions were filed, P34 dated 25.08.2017"
"produced  by  the  Petitioner 
itself,  makes 
it  abundantly  clear"
"written 
submissions  were 
in 
fact 
filed. 
  This  means 
the"
"impugned Order was made after hearing the Petitioner.  The fact"
"that the Petitioner did not tender the relevant documents at the"
"inquiry is beyond the control of the 1st Respondent."
"Thirdly,  the  Petitioner  says  the  impugned  Order  is  contrary  to"
"the  law,  as  it  was made  nearly  five  years  after  the  complaint  of"
"the  3rd  Respondent. 
  The  complaint  P2  had  been  made 
in"
"February 2013 and the first inquiry was held in May 2013.   As"
"already  stated,  the  1st  Respondent  did  not  address  the  gratuity"
"claim  in  the  impugned  Order  delivered  pursuant  to  the  first"
"inquiry  due  to  an  oversight.    The  second  inquiry  was  held  in"
"August  2017. 
  There 
is  no 
time 
limitation 
for 
inquiry 
into"
