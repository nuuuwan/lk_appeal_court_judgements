"B
anks cannot avail themselves of the provisions of the Recovery"
"of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act to recover their debts"
"by  parate  execution. 
It 
is  the  argument  of  Counsel 
for  the"
"Petitioner that, in terms of section 22, only Licensed Commercial"
"Banks  can 
resort 
to  parate  execution. 
  This  argument 
is"
"unsustainable. An amendment to the principal Act by Act No. 1"
"of  2011  encapsulates  “Licensed  Specialised  Bank”  within  the"
"definition of “Bank”."
"The  final  submission  of  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  relates  to"
"inconsistency 
in  the  preamble  of  the  Act  and  the  said 
loan"
"granted to the Petitioner. The preamble of the Act states it is “An"
"Act to provide for the recovery of loans granted by Banks for the"
"economic  development  of  Sri  Lanka”.  Counsel  argues  the  loan"
"given to the Petitioner does not fall within the purpose stated in"
"the preamble and therefore the Bank cannot recover its dues by"
"parate  execution.  This  is  not  the  first  time  this  argument  has"
"been  presented  before 
this  Court. 
 
In  DFCC  Bank  Ltd  v."
"Somaweera  [2003]  3  Sri  LR  128,  this  Court  rejected  the  same"
"argument  on 
two  grounds.  Firstly, 
the  preamble  of  an  Act"
"cannot  be  utilised 
to  restrict  a  clear  provision 
in 
the  Act."
"Secondly, even if what is recoverable under this Act is only loans"
"for the economic development of Sri Lanka, if there is material to"
"suggest  the  loan  has  contributed  to  economic  development,  the"
"requirement is fulfilled."
