"Power of Transfer"
"In  terms of Article  55(1) of the Constitution, the appointment,  promotion, transfer, disciplinary"
"control  and  dismissal  of public officers  is  vested  in  the  PSc.  The  PSC  is  empowered  in  terms of"
"Article  57(1)  of the  Constitution to delegate to a public officer its  powers  of,  inter alia,  transfer"
"of such  category of public officers as are specified  by the PSC."
"The 
learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  contended  that  the  power  of transfer  in  relation  to  the"
"Petitioner has  been  delegated  by the  PSC to the Secretary to the  Ministry of Finance  (R14).  The"

"powers  pertaining to transfer is  retained with the  psc. This  submission  is  based  on  the Scheme"
"of Transfer (R15)."

"according  to  schemes  approved  by  the  Public  Service  Commission"" . Transfer  is  not  limited  to"
"annual transfers.  But all transfers must be  in  accordance with a scheme of transfer approved by"
"the PSc.  This  is  further corroborated  by clause 02. of the Scheme of Transfer (R15) which  states"
"transfers  will  be  done  by 
the  Secretary 
to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning 
that  ""all"
"according  to  schemes  of  transfer  approved  by  the  PSC"".  Merely  because 
the  PSC  has  not"
"approved  a scheme  of transfer does  not mean  that the Secretary is  not vested  with the power"
"of transfer. He  has  the power but cannot  exercise  it in  the  absence  of an  approved  scheme  of"
