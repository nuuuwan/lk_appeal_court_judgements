"I
 am in agreement with the submission of the learned State Counsel that in any"
"event, the 1st Respondent required time  to consider the steps that should be"
"taken,  especially  given  the  fact  that  that  this  application  has  been  filed  less"
"than thirty days after writing ‘P19’, and less than eighteen days after ‘P21’, and"
"that in these circumstances, there has not been a refusal by the 1st Respondent"
