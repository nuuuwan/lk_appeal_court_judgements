"I
  shall  now  consider  whether  the  1st  Respondent  has  the  power  to  institute"
"action against the 2nd Respondent."
"A
s  stated  above,  the  position  of  the  Petitioners  is  that  by  proceeding  with  a"
"disciplinary 
inquiry  which  did  not  commence  within  the  stipulated  21  day"
"period,  the  2nd  Respondent  had  violated  the  provisions  of  the  said  Collective"
"Agreements."
"T
he learned President’s Counsel for the 2nd Respondent submitted that it is not"
"mandatory  that  the  disciplinary 
inquiry  commence  within  21  days  of  the"
"receipt of  the response to the show cause letter. This submission was on the"
"premise  that  no  sanctions  follow  the  failure  to  commence  the 
inquiry  as"
"scheduled,  and  thus,  the  said  provision  is  not  a  mandatory  provision.  It  was"
"also  submitted  that  in  any  event,  the  failure  to  commence  the  inquiry  falls"
"within  the  exceptions  provided  in  the  Collective  Agreements,  namely  that  it"
"was not possible  to commence  the  inquiry for  reasons  beyond  the  control  of"
"the 2nd Respondent, or by reason of the employee’s own conduct or seeking, or"
"by  reason  of  unforeseeable  circumstances.  I  am  of  the  view  that  it  is  not  for"
"this  Court  to  decide 
in  an  application  filed 
in  terms  of  Article  140  of  the"
"Constitution,  whether 
the  said  provision 
in 
the  Collective  Agreements 
is"
"mandatory or not, as it arises from an agreement between two private parties."
"T
here  are  two  sections 
in  the  Act  which  sets  out  the  power  of  the  1st"
"Respondent  to  take  steps  in  terms  of  the  law,  where  there  exists  a  dispute"
"relating  to  the  terms  of  employment  of  the  2nd  –  4th  Petitioners  contained  in"
"the said Collective Agreements."
