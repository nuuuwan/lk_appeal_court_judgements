"Section 57 of the  Customs  Ordinance  requires every exporter to deliver a Bill  of Entry,  which  is"
"in 
the  modern  usage  sometimes  also 
referred 
to  as  a  Customs  Declaration  or  ""CusDec"","
"containing inter alia  an  accurate  specification  of the quantity, quality and  value of the goods to"
"be  exported  and 
the  number,  denom ination,  dimensions  and  description  of  the  respective"
"packages  containing  the  goods.  If the  goods  do  not  agree  with  the  particulars  in  the  bill  of"
"entry,  in  the  absence of any explanation to the satisfaction of the Director-General of Customs,"
"the same  shall  be forfeited and such forfeiture includes all other goods which sholl be entered or"
"packed with them as well as the packages in  which they are contained."
"In this context,  the customs violation  results  in  the forfeiture of the goods concerned  as  well  as"
"all  other goods  which  shall  be  entered  or  packed  with  them  as  well  as  the  packages  in  which"
"they  are  contained.  The  word  ""entered""  in  section  57  of the  Customs  Ordinance  in  my  view"
"means included  in  the Bill  of Entry or CusDec."
"However,  section  57  of the  Customs  Ordinance  does  not  cover  the  imposition  of a forfeiture"
"amounting to treble  the  value  of goods  although  it provides for the  forfeiture  of the  goods  in"
"relation  to which  the violation  of section  57 of the  Customs  Ordinance  occurred  as  well  as  the"
"forfeiture of all  other goods which were entered or packed  with them as well as the packages  in"
"which  they  were  contained.  Therefore,  the  impugned  order  cannot  be  sustained  in  terms  of"
"section 57 of the Customs Ordinance."
"In  contrast,  section  59  of  the  Customs  Ordinance  dea ls  with  both  the 
forfeiture  of  goods"
"together with  the  means  of conveyance  and  the  imposition  of treble  the  value  of goods.  The"
"question  is  what  is  meant  by  ""such  goods""  in  relation  to  the  imposition  of treble  the  value  of"
"the goods."
"In  my  view  the  drafters  of the  Customs  Ordinance  appear  to  have  made  a  clear  distinction"
"between  situations  where  they  intended  to  encompass  only  the  goods  in  relat ion  to  which  a"
"customs  violation  occurred  compared  to  situations  where  all  other goods  entered  or  packed"
"with them as  well as  the packages  in  which they were contained  are brought into the equation."
"That  to  me  appears  to  be  the  reason  for  section  57  of the  Customs  Ordinance  to  specifically"
"refer  to  goods  entered  or  packed  with  the  goods 
in 
relation  to  which  a  customs  violation"
