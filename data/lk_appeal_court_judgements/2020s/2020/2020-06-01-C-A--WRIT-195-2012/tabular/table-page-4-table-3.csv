"In  Palasamy Nadar v.  Lanktree (51  N.L.R. 520 at 522) Gratiaen J. stated:"
"""Section 46  (which  is  the present Section 44)  provides that any goods exported or taken"
"out  of  the  Island  contrary  to  certain  specified  prohibitions  and 
restrictions  ""shall  be"
"farfeited and  shall  be  destroyed or disposed of as the Principal Collector of Customs may"
"direct."" 
The  Customs  Ordinance 
is  an  antiquated  enactment 
...........  Some  of  its"
"provisions declare that in  certain  circumstances goods  ""shall  be forfeited"" while in  other"
"circumstances they are  merely ""liable to be  forfeited""  ....  I am  prepared to concede that"
"the draftsmen must be given credit for having intended the terms ""forfeited"" and  ""liable"
"to forfeiture"" to convey different meanings. 
If the goods  are  declared to be  ""forfeited"""
"as  opposed  to  ""liable  to forfeiture""  on  the  happening  of a given  event,  their owner  is"
"automatically and  by  operation  of law  divested  of his  property in  the  goods  as  soon  as"
