"Arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Act is intended to"
"be even more liberal, informal and flexible than commercial"
"arbitration,  primarily  because  the  Arbitrator  is  empowered"
"to  make  an  award  which  is “just  and equitable”. When  an"
"industrial dispute has been referred under Section 3(1)(d) or"
"Section  4(1)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act  to  an  Arbitrator"
"for  settlement  by  arbitration,  Section  17(1)  of  the  said  Act"
"requires such Arbitrator to “make all such inquiries into the"
"dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence"
"as  may  be  tendered  by  the  parties  to  the  dispute,  and"
"thereafter make such award as may appear to him just and"
"equitable”.  In  my  view,  the  word  “make”  as  used  in  the"
"said  provision,  has  the  effect  of  throwing  the  ball  in  to  the"

"would be left to them to tender what evidence they consider"

just  a 
judge"

"will  be 
in  the  hands  of  the  parties  themselves  or 
their"
"Counsel.  What 
the 
Industrial  Disputes  Act  has  done"
"appears  to  me  to  be  to  substitute 
in  place  of  the  rigid"
"procedures  of 
the 
law  envisaged  by 
the 
“adversarial"
"system”,  a  new  and  more  flexible  procedure,  which  is  in"
"keeping  with  the  fashion  in  which  equity  in  English  law"
"gave  relief  to  the  litigants  from  the  rigidity  of  the  common"
"law.  The 
function  of 
the  arbitral  power
