"NLR 289, the Privy Council stated:"
"The powers and duties of an Arbitrator under the Industrial"
"Disputes  Act,  of  an 
Industrial  Court  and  of  a  Labour"
"Tribunal  on  a  reference  of  an 
industrial  dispute  are  the"
"same.  In relation  to  an  arbitration,  the Arbitrator  must hear"
"the  evidence  tendered  by  the  parties.  So  must  a  Labour"
"Tribunal  on  a  reference.  An  Industrial  Court  has  to  hear"
"such  evidence  as  it  considers  necessary.  In  each  case  the"
"award  has  to  be  one  which  appears  to  the  Arbitrator,  the"
"Labour  Tribunal  or  the  Industrial  Court  just  and  equitable."
"No other criterion is laid down. They are given an unfettered"
"discretion to do what they think is right and fair."
