"maker must closely observe all material requirements as to"
"form.2"
"However,  De 
Smith 
immediately 
thereafter 
acknowledges,"
"whereas 
formalities 
pertaining 
to 
inter 
alia 
notices  were"
"previously  construed  literally  and  rigorously,  the  Court  is  at"
"present  more 
likely 
to  pardon  omissions 
if  no  substantial"
"prejudice is caused to the affected party."
"Given the facts and circumstances of this case, I am of the view"
"substantial  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  Petitioner  due  to"
"non-adherence 
to 
the  provisions  of  publishing  notice  under"
"section 7."
"As  I  have  already  stated,  the  acquiring  officer  refuses  to  pay"
"compensation  because  the  Petitioner  did  not  come  forward  at"
"the 
right 
time. 
 
This 
is 
unacceptable 
in 
view 
of 
the"
"abovementioned facts."
"However,  the  Petitioner  in  the  prayer  to  the  petition  does  not"
"seek compensation."
"As 
seen 
from  X1 
tendered  by 
the  Respondents  with 
the"
"statement  of  objections,  the  Petitioner  has  been  agitating  for"
"relief  with  the  proper  authorities  since  at 
least  1983. 
  The"
"documents marked P9, P10, P14, P15, P16, P17, P21, X, clearly"
"establish  this  position.    The  Petitioner  has  not  been  sleeping"
"over his rights."
