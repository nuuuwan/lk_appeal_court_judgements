"mandamus  compelling  the  Minister  to  divest  the  land,  on  the"

"Petitioner  in  respect  of  the  portions  of  the  Petitionerâ€™s  land  not"
"used for any public purpose up to now.  The said portions of the"
"land are admittedly identifiable by Plan No. CO/KDW/2005/470"
"dated 10.05.2006."
"During  the  course  of  the  argument,  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner  expressed  his  willingness  to  accept  compensation  in"
"lieu  of  divestiture. 
  The  above  order  shall  not  stand  as  an"
"obstacle if both parties come to a compromise in this regard."
"The reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (c) and (d) are granted."
"The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs."
