"a
nd  Land  Development;4  and  N.W.  Leelawathi  v.  Minister  of"
"Lands and Land Development.5"
"In light of the contents of the Minister’s letters marked P12 and"
"P13  quoted  above,  I  am  of  the  view  the  Petitioner  has  satisfied"
"the  four  criteria  stipulated  in  39A(2)  of  the  Act.    The  Petitioner"
"has 
tendered  photographs  marked  P18-P20,  albeit  undated,"
"whereby  it  appears  the  said  land  has  been  left  untended  and"
"unutilised.  The  Respondents  do  not  claim  either  that  the  said"
"land has been utilised or improved thus far."
"At  the  argument,  it  was  submitted  condition  (a)  under  section"
"39A(2)  has  not  been  satisfied  because,  as  seen 
from  R8(1),"
"compensation  was  paid  to  some  persons  interested  in  the  land."
"It was stressed, if compensation has been paid to “any person or"
"persons”  interested  in  the  land,  as  specified  in  condition  (a),  a"
"divesting  order  in  terms  of  section  39A(2)  cannot  be  made.    I"
"regret  my 
inability 
to  agree  with 
this 
contention  without"
"qualifications."
"In the first place, the said argument is against the clear position"
"of  the  Minister  in  P12  and  P13,  whereby  he  acknowledges  that"
"the Petitioner has satisfied all four criteria for divestiture."
"Secondly,  “any  person”  in  section  39A(2)(a)  cannot  be  given  an"
"unduly narrow interpretation to the detriment of citizens whose"
"lands have been unreasonably acquired by the State."
