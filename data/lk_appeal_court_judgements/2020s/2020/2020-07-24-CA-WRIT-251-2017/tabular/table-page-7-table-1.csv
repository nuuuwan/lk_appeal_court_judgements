"The said letter sent by the 4th Respondent is dated 04.07.2018."
"It is the same Officer who filed the corresponding affidavit dated"
"26.09.2018 to the statement of objections of the Respondents."
"With  regard  to  non-payment  of  compensation  to  the  Petitioner,"
"the position of learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents"
"is  the  Petitioner  did  not  make  his  claim  to  the  acquiring  officer"
"within  the  time  period  allowed  in  the  Act.    The  Respondents"
"state  in  paragraph  14(f)-(h)  of  the  statement  of  objections  “the"
"Respondent issued Notice under section 7 of the Land Acquisition"
"Act”  and  a  total  of  35  claimants  had  been  called  for  inquiries"
"under 
section  10(1) 
of 
the  Act, 
of  whom  27  were  paid"
"compensation."
"It is the position of the Petitioner that he was totally unaware of"
"such  an  inquiry  for  payment  of  compensation  and  he  was  not"
"served with notice.  Learned Counsel for the Petitioner draws the"
"attention  of  the  Court  to  section  17  of  the  Act  to  formulate  the"
"argument  that  the  acquiring  officer  shall  give  written  notice  to"
"persons  entitled  to  compensation.    Clearly,  section  17  has  no"
"application 
in  this  context,  as  the  written  notice  referred  to"
"therein  relates  to  the  award  of  compensation  made  after  the"
"inquiry under section 9 of the Act."
"However,  in  my  view,  in  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this"
"case, the contention of the Petitioner that he was unaware of the"
"inquiry is acceptable.  Let me explain."
