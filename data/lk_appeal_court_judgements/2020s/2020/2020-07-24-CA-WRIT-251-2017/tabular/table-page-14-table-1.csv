"W
hy I say “unreasonably” above is because the land in this case"
"was  acquired  under  proviso 
(a) 
to  section  38  of 
the  Land"
"Acquisition Act in the year 1979 “on the ground of urgency” but"
"has been left undeveloped for more than 40 years.  The State or"
"State 
functionaries  cannot  use 
the  Land  Acquisition  Act 
to"
"irresponsibly take over private lands in the guise of urgency and"
"then  let  the  land  stand  idle  for  several  decades.    That  is  a"
"betrayal of the public trust doctrine (vide The Colombo Buddhist"
"Theosophical Society v. The Secretary, Ministry of Education)6."
"As  held  by  this  Court  in  K.P.S.D.  De  Silva  v.  L.H.S.C.  Silva,"
"Commander  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Army,7  when  a  statute  can  be"
"interpreted 
in 
favour  of  either  the  subject  or  the  State,  the"
"tendency  is  to  interpret  it  in  favour  of  the  former,  for  it  is  the"
"fundamental  obligation  of  the  State  to  protect  the  interests  of"
"citizens, for the benefit of whom alone the latter exists.  There is"
"a 
presumption 
the 
legislature 
does 
not 
intend  what 
is"
"unreasonable and unjustifiable."
"If a large extent of land is acquired for a public purpose, and, for"
"instance, only half of it is used for the said purpose, a divesting"
"order  for  the  remaining  portion  cannot  be  refused  relying  on"
"section 39A(2)(a) on the basis that compensation was paid to the"
"persons whose portions were used for the public purpose.  Such"
"an  interpretation  leads  to  an  absurdity.    It  is  the  duty  of  the"
"Court  to  give  purposive  interpretation  to  the  section.    If  the"
"portion of land sought to be divested can be separated from the"
"rest  of  the  land  and  no  compensation  has  been  paid  to  any"
