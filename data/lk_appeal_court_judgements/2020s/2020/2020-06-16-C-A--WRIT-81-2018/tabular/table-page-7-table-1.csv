"T
hus, the averment in paragraph 1 of the petition that the 1st Petitioner is the"
"occupier  of  the  paddy  land  under  the  Annual  Permit  P1  is  factually  incorrect."
"The correct position thus appears to be that the land given to the 1st Petitioner"
"under  Permit  No.  716/36  is  currently  being  cultivated  by  the  2nd  Petitioner,"
"namely M.M.Sarath Wijebandara. This is in addition to cultivating the adjoining"
"land  given  to  M.M.Wijeratne,  the  father  of  the  Petitioners  under  Permit  No."
"716/37."
