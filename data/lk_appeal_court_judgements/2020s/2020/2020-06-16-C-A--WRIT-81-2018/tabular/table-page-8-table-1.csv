"necessary inquiries and make a suitable recommendation to quash ‘P4’."
"T
his Court must observe that this application has been filed 24 years after the"
"Grant  ‘P4’  had  been  issued,  and  that  the  6th  Respondent  has  taken  up  the"
"position that the Petitioners are guilty of laches. The position of the Petitioners"
"is that they have been in occupation of the said land since 1982, and was not"
"aware of the Grant, until the 6th Respondent instituted Case No. 158/L in 2017"
"in the District Court of Hingurakgoda, seeking a declaration of title in respect of"
"the said land and to eject the father of the Petitioners from the said land. This"
"explanation is plausible, especially since the 6th Respondent has not placed any"
"material before this Court that the existence of the Grant was divulged to the"
"Petitioners any time prior to 2017."
