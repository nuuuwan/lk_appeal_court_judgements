"the law relating to the case before the court martial proceeds to deliberate upon"
"its finding.""‚Äù (Emphasis added)"
"The Supreme Court quashed the finding of the Court Martial and the order of punishment on"
"the  basis  that  the  failure  of  the  Judge-Advocate  to  perform  the  statutory  duty,  explicitly"
"imposed  by  section  39  (d)  of  the  Navy  Act,  to  sum  up  on  the  evidence  before  the  court"
"deliberates on its finding is a fatal illegality."
"This may well be the reason for the learned counsel for the Petitioner to place heavy reliance"
"on  the  summing  up  of  the  Judge  Advocate  and  the  alleged  misdirection  and  non-direction"
"therein to assail the decision of the Court Martial and the punishment imposed on him."
"The  grounds  advanced by  the  learned  counsel for  the  Petitioner are  that  the  Judge  Advocate"
"has  failed to  sum up to the  Court  Martial  about  the  maintainability of  the  charge  against the"
"Petitioner,  since  the  initial  charge  sheet  issued  contained  a  different  charge  to  that  of  the"
"charge before the Court Martial, that the Court Martial lacked jurisdiction to try the Petitioner"
"without the provisions of section 40 of the Air Force Act  being followed after the charge had"
"been amended/changed."
