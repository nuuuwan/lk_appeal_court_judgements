"the power to try and punish offences, which if committed by civilians would be tried by"
"the  ordinary  courts,  is  not  ordinarily  composed  of  officers  with  legal  knowledge  or"
"judicial  experience.  In  fact  the  court  in  the  present  case  was  composed  of  two  supply"
"officers and one surgeon officer. It is because of this lack of legal or judicial training and"
"experience that the function of advising courts martial is committed by law to the Judge-"
"Advocate.  Indeed,  his  functions  are  comparable  to  those  of  a  Judge  of  Assize  in  cases"
"tried by Jury. Although it is the function of the Jury to decide all questions of fact, the"
"law  requires  that  before  the  Jury  deliberates  on  the  facts,  the  Judge  must  sum  up  to"
"them the evidence. Section 39 (d) imposes a similar requirement in the case of a trial by"
"court martial:-"
