"However, neither of them is engaged in the circumstances of this case. In such a situation the"
"practice is that the right to determine the order in which witnesses may be called is given to"
"Counsel  subject  to  overriding  discretion  given  to  Court  [Bandaranaike  v.  Premadasa  (1979)  2"
"Sri.L.R. 369]."
"The 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  further  submitted  that  the  Court  Martial  failed  to"
"consider the credibility of the main witness. Again I see no merit in this submission given that"
"the  Judge  Advocate  has  properly  summed  up  as  to  how  to  evaluate  the  credibility  of  the"
"prosecution  witnesses.  Once  that  duty  is  performed  judicial  review  cannot  be  extended  to"
"decide whether the Court Martial acted in accordance with the said direction or not."
"A further point was made on the contradictory nature of the prosecution witnesses. The Judge"
"Advocate  has 
in  his  summing  up  properly  directed  the  Court  Martial  on  the  credibility  of"
"witnesses."
"Thereafter it is up to the Court Martial to decide the creditworthiness of witnesses and evaluate"
"their evidence.  This Court cannot step into the shoes of the Court Martial, as much as a Court"
"does  not  do  to  a  Jury,  and  determine  that  issue  differently.  The  Court  Martial  is  the  final"
"authority on the facts of the case."
"For all the aforesaid reasons, the application is dismissed. I make no order as to costs."
