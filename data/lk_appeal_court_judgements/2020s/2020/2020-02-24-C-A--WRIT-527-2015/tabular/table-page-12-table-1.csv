uggests that  the Central Environmental Authority should have"
"taken  21  days  for  approval.    This  is  the  main  argument  of  the"
"Petitioner against the Central Environmental Authority approval"
"marked  P10B,  which 
is 
sought 
to  be 
quashed 
in 
these"
"proceedings.  That is the main relief sought."
"In  my  view,  the  argument  of  the  Petitioner  in  the  petition  that"
"“21 days are required for the Technical Review of an IEE Report”"
"is  a  misleading  statement.    It  presupposes  that  the  Authority"
"must take 21 days to assess the IEE Report.  This is not so."
"The  Petitioner  has  referred  to  P12  to  convince  his  assertion."
"P12―an 
extract 
from 
the  Central  Environmental  Authority"
"website―says  “The  time  allowed  for  the  PAA  (Project  Approving"
"Agencies)” for “Technical review” is “21 days for IEE and 30 days"
"for  EIA.”    This  does  not  say  nor  can  it  be  taken  to  mean  that"
"technical  review  of  the  IEE  Report  shall  mandatorily  take  21"
"days.    P12  gives  the  maximum  time  limit  to  complete  the  task."
"It can be in one day or any day within 21 days."
"Here again, in my view, the time stipulated is not mandatory but"
"given for the benefit of the project proponent in order for him to"
"plan  out  his  project.    If  the  technical  review  were  to  take  more"
"than 21 days, that would not invalidate the whole process which"
"culminates 
in  granting  or  refusing  approval  by 
the  Central"
"Environmental Authority."
"What 
is  stated 
in  the  website 
is  a  simplified  version  of  the"
"Regulations  made 
by 
the  Minister 
under 
the 
National"
"Environmental  Act  marked  3R4.  Learned

"Petitioner  drew  the  attention  of  the  Court  to  Regulation  No.9."
