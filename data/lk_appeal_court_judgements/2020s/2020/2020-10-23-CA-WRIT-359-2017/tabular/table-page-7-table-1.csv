"2.  Since  some  of  these  issues  have  arisen  fairly  recently"
"and  have  not  been  considered  in  the  EIA  report  which"
"was 
prepared 
in 
2007, 
no 
satisfactory  mitigatory"
"measures 
to 
resolve 
the  above 
issues  have 
been"
"suggested  by  the  project  proponent  in  the  EIA  report  or"
"in  subsequent  documents.  Further,  it  appears  that  due"
"attention  has  not  been  paid  to  the  above  issues  during"
"the  Technical  Evaluation  of  the  EIA  report.  Important"
"stakeholders  such  as  the  National  Building  Research"
"Organisation,  Natural  Resources  Management  Centre  of"
"Dept.  of  Agriculture,  Road  Development  Authority  and"
"the  Udarata  Amarapura  Nikaya  Sanga  Sabha  have  not"
"been  consulted  during 
the  EIA  study  and 
the  EIA"
"evaluation."
