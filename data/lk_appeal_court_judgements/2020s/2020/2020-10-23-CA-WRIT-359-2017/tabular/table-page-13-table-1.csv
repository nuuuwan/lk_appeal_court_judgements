"national importance of the project and the overall well being"
"of the state and the citizens in making the said order."
"The  main  grouse  of  the  Petitioner  against  the  appeal  decision"
"seems 
to  be 
the  opportunity  given 
to 
third  parties  by 
the"
"Secretary 
to 
the  Ministry,  acting  as 
the  appellate  body, 
to"
"express their views at the hearing of the appeal, when the appeal"
"was  limited  to  three  specific  grounds  as  stated  in  P9(a)/5R6"
"quoted above."
"I regret my inability to agree with this submission.  This appeal"
"under the Environmental Protection Act is unique. The appellate"
"procedure is set out in Gazette No.850/4 dated 20.12.1994. The"
"Regulations  set  out 
in 
the  said  Gazette  are  cited  as 
the"
"National  Environmental  (Appellate  Procedure)  Regulations  of"
"1994.    Regulation  5  thereof  says:  “All  appeals  received  shall"
"be  entered  on  a  register  to  be  maintained  by  the  Secretary for"
"such 
purpose.  Such 
register 
or 
an 
extract 
thereof  duly"
"authenticated by the Secretary shall be a public document open"
"for  public  inspection  at  the  office  of  Ministry  of  the  Minister  in"
"charge of the subject of Environment during any working day.”"
"Providing for the appeal registry to be a public document open"
"to  general  inspection  makes  it  clear  that  any  member  of  the"
"public  may  raise 
their  concerns  over 
the  subject  matter."
"Regulation  11  says: 
“The  Secretary  may  also  notify 
the"
"authority, government department, corporation, statutory body,"
"local  authority  or  public  officer  as  the  case  may  be,  to  submit"
"its  comments  or  observations  on  the  appeal,  and  may  require"
"them 
to  be  present  and  make  submissions  at  any  hearing"
