1B(1)(a)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act,  No.  43  of  1950,  as"
"amended, 
there  shall  be  a 
termination  of  services  by 
the"
"employer  to  grant  relief.    The  Labour  Tribunal,  the  High  Court"
"and 
the  Supreme  Court  held 
that 
there  was  constructive"
"termination  of  employment  after  the  tendering  of  the  Notice  of"
"Resignation.  Reliefs were accordingly granted to the employee."
"I cannot accept the argument of learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  employee  and  learned  State  Counsel  for  the  Commissioner"
"General  of  Labour  that  to  put 
in  motion  section  13  of  the"
"Payment  of  Gratuity  Act,  termination  of  employment  by  the"
"employer 
shall 
necessarily 
be 
in  writing. 
 
Constructive"
"termination 
of 
employment 
by 
the 
employer 
is 
a 
valid"
"termination for this purpose."
"If the services of the employee were constructively terminated by"
"the  employer,  as  alleged  by  the  employee  in  the  instant  case,"
"there is no necessity to thereafter tender resignation."
"The  letter  of  resignation  R1  (annexed  to  P7)  had  been  given  on"
"08.11.2010. 
  On  the  same  day,  by  R3 
(annexed  to  P7)  the"
"petitioner  informed  the  employee  inter  alia  that  “your  letter  of"
"resignation  is  not  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  your  letter  of"
"appointment,  by  which  you  have  agreed  to  give  us  3  months"
"notice or 3 months salary in lieu of notice. We believe that, as you"
"have not given us 3 months notice you will make arrangements to"
"make  payment  of  3  months  salary 
in 
lieu  of  notice 
to 
the"
"Company.”  This refers to clause 15 of the Letter of Appointment"
"marked R2 (annexed to P7), which reads as follows:"
