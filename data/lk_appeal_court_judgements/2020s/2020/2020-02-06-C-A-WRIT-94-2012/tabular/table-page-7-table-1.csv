"notice  is not  possible  and  thus question  of payment  in lieu"
"of notice does not arise. (emphasis added)"
"There  is  no  dispute  that  in  the  eyes  of  the  law,  constructive"
"termination 
of 
employment 
is 
a 
legally 
accepted  way 
of"
"terminating employment."
"This is not a new phenomenon.  In the instant case, constructive"
"termination  of  employment,  according  to  the  employee  himself,"
"preceded resignation.  In the Supreme Court case of Walker and"
"Sons  &  Company  Ltd.  v.  Gurusinghe  [2008]  1  Sri  LR  37,  this"
"happened 
in 
that 
constructive 
termination 
of 
vice 
versa"
"employment followed resignation.  In the Walker and Sons case,"
"the  employee  was  promoted  with  additional  duties.    Thereafter,"
"the  employee  gave  Notice  of  Resignation  on  the  ground  that  he"
"was  unable 
to  accede 
to 
the  new 
terms  due 
to  a 
lack  of"
"infrastructure facilities to achieve targets given by the employer."
"Pending 
formal  acceptance  of  resignation,  the  employee  was"
"demoted to his earlier position and called to give explanation for"
"his  non-participation  at  Management  Meetings  etc.    Thereafter,"
"the  employee  informed  the  employer  in  writing  that  the  latter"
"had 
terminated  his 
services 
constructively 
and 
instituted"
"proceedings 
in 
the  Labour  Tribunal 
seeking 
relief 
for 
the"
"unjustified 
constructive 
termination 
of 
employment. 
 
The"
"question  to  be  decided  was  whether  the  employee  had  resigned"
"from 
employment 
or 
whether 
his 
services 
had 
been"
"constructively  terminated  by  the  employer.    This  question  was"
"significant  to  clothe  the  Labour  Tribunal  with  jurisdiction  to"
"grant  relief  to  the  employee,  in  that,  if  it  was  the  former,  the"
"employee  was  not  entitled 
to  relief  as, 
in 
terms  of  section"
