n  the  result,  I  hold  that  the  decision  of  the  Commissioner"
"General  of  Labour  contained  in  P10  is  a  nullity,  as  it  has  been"
"made without jurisdiction."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  I  set  aside  the  impugned  decision  of"
"the Commissioner General of Labour contained in P10 and grant"
"relief to the petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of"
"the prayer to the petition.  I make no order as to costs."
