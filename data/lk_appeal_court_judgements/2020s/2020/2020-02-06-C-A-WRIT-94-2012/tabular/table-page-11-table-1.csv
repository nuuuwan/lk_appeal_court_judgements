that  you  have 
resigned

"required during the investigations. It would be imperative to"
"do  so  especially  to  ascertain  your  entitlement  for  gratuity."

"the Gratuity  Act, forfeiture of gratuity  is  possible  in certain"
"circumstances.  Therefore,  we  would  expect  you

time  of 
the 
investigation"
"processes."
"Quite apart from the above, we would also reserve the right"
"to  pursue  any  action  against  you 
in 
terms  of 
law, 
if"
"necessary."
