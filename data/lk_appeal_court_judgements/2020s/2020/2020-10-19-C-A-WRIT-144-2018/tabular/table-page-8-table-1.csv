he  Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  was  not  made  a  suspect/accused"
"in any inquiry. No punishment was meted out on the Petitioner."
"In the circumstances, how can the Petitioner find fault with the"
"procedure 
of 
the 
inquiry? 
As 
seen 
from 
P27, 
several"
"punishments  were 
imposed  on  Kala  Traders  who  had

"representation  at  the  inquiry.    But  Kala  Traders  or  any  other"
