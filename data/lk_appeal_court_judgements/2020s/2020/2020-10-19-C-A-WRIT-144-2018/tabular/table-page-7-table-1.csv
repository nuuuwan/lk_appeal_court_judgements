(according  to  the  Agreement  entered  into  between  the"
"Petitioner and Kala Traders marked P6)."
"This  makes  abundantly  clear  my  earlier  observation,  i.e.  that"
"Kala  Traders  is  a  necessary  party  to  this  application.  For  me,"
"hearing this application without Kala Traders is akin to playing"
"Hamlet  without 
the  Prince  of  Denmark! 
  Failure 
to  make"
"necessary  parties  petitioners  or  respondents,  as  the  case  may"
"be, warrants dismissal of the application in limine."
"If  Kala  Traders  failed  to  make  due  payments  in  violation  of  the"
"Agreement  or  if  the  ownership  of  the  goods  is  in  dispute,  the"
"same shall be resolved in a different forum, perhaps by the said"
"Commercial  High  Court  case,  and  not  by 
insisting  that  the"
"Customs  Department  recommence  the  already  concluded,  long"
"drawn out inquiry."
"It is in the alternative to the said main relief (quashing P27) that"
"the  Petitioner  asks  this  Court  to  direct  the  Director  General  of"
"Customs 
to  hold  a 
formal 
inquiry  upon  a 
formal 
charge"
"sheet/show cause notice issued on the Petitioner."
"The  contention  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  section  8  inquiry"
"under the Customs Ordinance is a fact-finding inquiry, which is"
"a precursor to a formal inquiry, and any punishment meted out"
"after a section 8 inquiry is a nullity, as punishment can only be"
"meted out after a formal inquiry."
"Let me consider the issue in light of this submission."
"The  Petitioner  refused  to  participate  in  the  section  8  inquiry."
"After the section 8 inquiry, no show cause notice was served on"
