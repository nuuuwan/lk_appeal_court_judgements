"and  effective  assessment.  This  decision  was  cited  with  approval  by  Thomas  J. 
in  a  recent"
"decision  of  the  Tax  Chamber  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal 
in  Patrick  v.  Commissioner  of  Her"
"Majesty's  Revenue  and  Customs  [(2015)  UKFT  508  (TC)]  where  he  held  that  assessment  and"
"notice are two different things."
"I  arrived  at  a  similar  conclusion,  with  my  brother  Wengappuli  J.  agreeing,  in  Stafford  Motor"
"Company (Private) Limited v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [C.A. (Tax) 17/2017;"
"C.A.M. 15.03.2018]."
"The 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  contended  that  the  facts 
in  Honigs  case  (supra) 
is"
"different  to  the 
instant  case  as  there  was  evidence 
in  that  case  which 
indicated  that  the"
"assessment itself had been done prior to the expiry of the time bar period which is not there in"
"the instant case. I am unable to accept this submission."
"Section 29 of the VAT Act states that where the Assessor does not accept a return furnished by"
"any person under section 21 for any taxable period and makes an assessment or an additional"
"assessment on such person for such taxable period under section 28 or under section 31, as the"
"case may be, the Assessor shall communicate to such person by registered letter sent through"
"the post why he is not accepting the return. The letter dated 21.02.2007 sent by the Assessor"
"informs the Appellant to treat the letter as an intimation under section 29 of the VAT Act.  On"
"this  view,  the  letter  dated  21.02.2007  can  be  treated  as  indicative  of  an  assessment  having"
"being  made  and  therefore  the  assessment  for  the  taxable  period  from  1st  February  2004  to"
"31st December 2004 has been made within the time stipulated in Section 33(1) of the VAT Act."
"However, the learned Senior State Counsel invoked the  provisions in section 33(2) of the VAT"
"Act  (as  amended  by  Act  No.  7  of  2003) and  submitted  that  while  the  general  rule  is  that the"
"assessment must be made within three years of the end of the taxable period, where a person"
"or  entity being  assessed  has  failed  to  make  a  full  and  true disclosure  of  all  the  material facts"
"necessary  to  determine 
the  amount  of  tax  payable  by  him 
for  any  taxable  period  the"
"assessment  can  be  made  within  a  period  of  five  years  from  the  end  of  the  taxable  period  to"
"which the assessment relates."
"I must add that the requirement is that such failure must be done wilfully or fraudulently."
