nderway,  and  a  part  of  the  land  acquired  from  the  Petitioner"
"has  been  given 
to 
the  said  sports  society  as  a 
temporary"
"measure  until  an  alternative  land  is  identified  for  them.    The"
"Respondents  have  tendered  a  spate  of  documents  to  establish"
"that the public purpose for which the land was acquired has not"
"changed  and 
the  area  used  at  present  as

"volleyball  court  will  be  used  to  construct  the  proposed  office"
"buildings of the Central Expressway."
"The  Petitioner  cannot  seek  divestiture  under  section  39A  of  the"
"Land Acquisition Act.  In order for a divesting claim to be made"
"under section 39A, the Petitioner shall satisfy four criteria.  The"
"first criterion is “no compensation has been paid under the Act to"
"any person or persons  interested  in  the land  in relation  to  which"
"Admittedly, 
the 
the  said  divesting  Order 
is 
to  be  made”."
"Petitioner 
received 
compensation 
without 
any 
protest."
"Therefore, he cannot in law make a claim for divestiture."
"The  Petitioner  admittedly  did  not  appeal  against  the  award  of"
"compensation  in  the  manner  set  out  in  Part  III  of  the  Land"
"Acquisition  Act;  nor  did  he  appeal 
to 
the  special 
tribunals"
"created  for  this  purpose,  i.e.  the  Land  Acquisition  Resettlement"
"Committee (LARC) and the Super Land Acquisition Resettlement"
"Committee 
(Super  LARC). 
  He  says  he  did  not  do  so  as  a"
"responsible  citizen.    Then  he  cannot  now  move  this  Court  to"
"enhance the quantum of compensation.   This is not the task of"
"the writ Court."
"Both reliefs sought by the Petitioner are plainly misconceived in"
"law."
