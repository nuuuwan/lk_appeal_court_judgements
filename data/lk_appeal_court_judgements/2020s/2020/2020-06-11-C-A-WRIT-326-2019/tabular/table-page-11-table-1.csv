"Necessary Parties"
"The 
learned  President's  Counsel  for  the  1st  to  8th  Respondents  submitted  that  the  SEC 
is  a"
"necessa ry party and as  such  should  have been added as  a Respondent.  In  the absence of which,"
"it was  submitted that the applicat ion  must be  dismissed for want of necessary parties.  Reliance"
"was  placed  upon  the  decision  in  Rawaya  Publishers  and  Others  v.  Wijedasa  Rajapakse  and"
"Others  [(2001)  3  SrLL.R.  213]  and  Central  Cultural  Fund  v.  Lanka  General Services  Union  and"
"three others [( 2008)  BLR  Vol.  XIV  Part II  page  269]."
"It was  submitted that even  though the determination impugned  in  these  proceedings were not"
"made  by  the  SEC, 
it  is  only  through  the  SEC  that  the  Respondents  derived 
its  authority  to"
"conduct  an  inquiry and  make a determination in  terms of the SEC  Rules and  as  such the SEC  is  a"
"necessary  party.  Further 
it  was  contended 
that  since 
the  Petitioner  contends 
that  the  1st"
"Respondent  acted  in  contravention  of the  Stockbroker  Rules  promulgated  under  the  SEC  Act"
"the SEC  must be  made a party at lea st for the purpose of assisting Court."
