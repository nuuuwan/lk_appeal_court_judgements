"Defendants informed the Court that ""by an  oversight, the Defendants could  not file the affidavit"
"in  support of the  said  Petition  under sec.  86  (2)  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code  and  therefore the"
"Affidavit with receipt pertaining to the stamp duty being paid  is filed  hereby."""
"The  deceased  Plaintiff filed  her Objections to the said  Application  of the  Defendants  mainly on"
"two grounds"
"(a)  The  Defendants  have  filed  their Application  out of time  for the  reason  of no  valid  and"
"stamp duty paid to the Petition and  Affidavit that was filed within  14 days"
"(b)  That there is no need of summons to be served as the Defendants any way came to Court"
"by filing a proxy."
"The Learned District Judge on 17-08-2000, dismissed the said application of the Defendants, after"
"having considered  both of the grounds taken up by the Defendants."
"The Defendants preferred this Final  Appeal  against the said  Order. In  the said  Final Appeal  as"
"well, the Defendants raised the aforesaid  grounds."
"The  defence  taken  up  by  the  now  deceased  Plaintiff  was 
that,  by  way  of  a  motion  dated"
"16.10.2000,  he  informed  the  District  Court  that this  Final  Appeal,  under  sec.86  (2)  of the  Civil"
"Procedure  Code  the  application  was  filed  not within  14  days  (including Sundays  and  all  public"
"holidays) from the service  of the said  ex-parte decree entered, which  was on  15-11-1999.  Even"
"though  the  said  purported  Application  was  comprised  with  a Petition  and  an  Affidavit  by  the"
"Secretary  of the  2nd  Defendant-Appellant,  both  purportedly dated  26-11-1999,  as  admitted  by"
"the Defendants themselves, the said  documents were not stamp duty paid.  Since as admitted by"
"the  Defendants  themselves,  there  was  no  valid  stamp  duty  paid  Petition  and  Affidavit,  the"
"Defendants  were  forced  to  file  a fresh  Affidavit  with  stamp  duty  paid. 
The  said  subsequent"
"Affidavit, this time by the 1st Defendant-Appellant was tendered to the Court on  02.12.1999."
"Consequently,  even  though  the  Defendants  might  have  filed  a Petition  and  Affidavit  without"
"stamp  duty being paid  within  14 days from the date of the service  of the said  ex-parte decree,"
"the  subsequent  affidavit  with  stamp  duty  paid,  was  filed  17  days  after the  service  of the  said"
"ex-parte decree."
"Therefore, it is very clear that the  Learned  District Judge was correct in  deciding the Application"
"of the Defendants is time barred."
"It is  my  view that Even  though  the Defendants  maintained  that summons  were  tendered  with"
"the Plaint,  it is  evident from the case  record  itself that the summons were tendered at the time"
"of filing of the Plaint. It is  my observation that there shall  not be other evidence remaining in the"
