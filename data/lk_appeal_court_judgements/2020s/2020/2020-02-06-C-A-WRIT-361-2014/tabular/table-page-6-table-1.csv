"termination within the meaning of section  2(1  )(a).  However, it is  not necessary to decide"
"that question because, as learned State Counsel submitted on behalf ofthe 1st Respondent,"
"there  is  a  difference  between  consent  to  the  termination  itself  (which  is  what  section"
"2(1)(a) requires), and an agreement - as in this case - as to the quantum of terminal benefits"
"in circumstances in which the termination itself is no longer negotiable or has already been"
"unilaterally determined or effected  (which is  not enough). The  Petitioner's letters and  the"
"2nd  Respondent's  acceptance  of the  payments  were  all  subsequent  to  the  Petitioner's"
"unilateral  decision  to  terminate  the  2nd  Respondent's  services,  and  are  not  proof of"
"anything more than his agreement to the benefit's payable consequent upon that decision."
"The  2nd  Respondent did not give prior consent,  in  writing or otherwise, to the termination"
"of his services,  but subsequently agreed to and accepted the terminal benefits offered."""
