"I will now examine whether the attendant circumstances of this case show that such  an  approval"
"has been  given  by the 1st  Respondent."
"Section  2(2)(a)  of  the  Act  states  that  approva l  may  be  given  by 
the  Commissioner  on  an"
"application made in that behalf by such  employer, a copy of which  application shall be served on"
"the workman concerned, who shall  be  afforded an  opportunity of being heard."
"In  this context one must bear in  mind that section  114 of the Evidence Ordinance states that the"
"court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being"
"had  to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and  public and  private bu si ness in"
"their relation to the facts of the particular case.  Illustration (d) therein states that the court may"
"presume that judicial and  official acts have been regularly performed. I see  no reason to consider"
"that that  the  1st  Respondent  may  have  acted  otherwise 
in  relation  to  granting  permiss ion  to"
"terminate the services of the Petitioner. Therefore,  if the assertion  of the  Petitioner is true that"
"the  1st  Respondent  did  give  his  prior  written  approval,  there  should  be  an  application  by  the"
"Petitioner and  a copy of that should have been served on the 2nd  Respondent and  he should have"
"been  heard.  However,  neither  the  Petitioner  nor  the  1"" 
to  3,d  and  5th  Respondents  have"
"submitted  any documentation to Court  indicating that the Petitioner made such  an  application"
"and the workman were given  an  opportunity of being heard."
"Furthermore,  section  2(2)(d)  requires the Commissioner to give  notice in  writing of hi s decision"
"on the application to both the employer and the workman. In this situation too section 114 of the"
"Evidence  Ordinance  applies.  However,  neither 
the  Petitioner  nor 
the  1st 
to  3,d  and 
5th"
"Respondents  have  submitted  any  documentation  to  Court  which  evinces  of a  deci sion  of the"
"Commissioner in  writing."
"In this context it is  important to point out that at the inquiry (P16)  conducted  into the complaint"
"made by the 2nd  Respondent (P14)  about hi s unlawful termination, the Petitioner did not take up"
"the  position  that  the  termination  was  consequent  to  written  approval  obtained  from  the  1"""
"Respondent . In the written submi ss ion s signed by Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner (Respondent"
"at the inquiry)  it is  stated  that ""at  all  times  material  to the  employment of the employees they"
"were made to understand that there wa s no  permanency in their employment"" and  that "" Farab"
"decided  to  hand  over  its function s to  a contractor  si nce  they were  unable to continue  with  its"
"employees""."
