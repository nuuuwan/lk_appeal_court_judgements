"time  period,  in  CCTV  footage 
that  had  been  recovered  from  a  public"
"school, which was located near the place where the three bags were found."
"The Suspect-Respondent is  the registered owner of the said Car and"
"was  arrested  on  15.09.2019,  after  she  had  evaded  arrest  by  shifting  her"
"residence  to  one of  her relations. In her statement she had stated that she"
"had given her car on rent to  one"" Hichchi  Malli"".  The Suspect-Respondent"
"claimed 
that  she  did  not  know  any  other  personal  details  of  the  said"
"""Hichchi  Malli""  except  for  his  mobile  phone  number  0729534610.  This"
"number had been issued with international roaming facility  and  therefore"
"the local service provider is  unable to trace  the details of ownership of the"
"phone or of its subscriber."
"In refusing  to  enlarge  the Suspect-Respondent,  the  High Court has"
"held  that the submissions  made on her behalf as  to  the non-availability of"
"evidence in relation to her exclusive possession of the prohibited substance"
"is  not relevant since it is a  matter for  the trial  Court. It also considered the"
"time  period 
the  Suspect-Respondent  has 
spent 
in 
remand 
pending"
"investigations  and  found 
that  there  is  no  exceptional  ground  revealed"
"therefrom.  The 
fact 
that  she 
is 
a  mother  of 
two  children 
too  was"
"disregarded as a non-exceptional ground."
"Learned  President's  Counsel  for 
the  Petitioner  submitted 
to 
this"
"Court in support of  the  revision  application  that  the Suspect-Respondent"
"was merely arrested because she is the registered owner of the said vehicle"
"and  no  other  evidence  is  available  as  to  her  complicity  even  though  the"
"investigations are continuing. Therefore, he reiterated that there is  no basis"
