"had  noticed  the  7th  Respondent  and  Sumanapala  to  appear  before  the  Tribunal  on"
"27th  March  2015.  On  that  date,  the  3rd  Petitioner  had  appeared  and  informed  the"
"Tribunal  that  Sumanapala  had  passed  away  prior  to  the  complaint  being  made."
"However,  the  3rd  Petitioner  had  sought  time  to  discuss  with  the  family  members  a"
"possible resolution of the dispute."
"O
n the next date – i.e. 28th April 2015, as there was no settlement, the inquiry had"
"been fixed for 15th May 2015. On that date, the  3rd Petitioner had produced  to  the"
"Tribunal  a  letter  appointing  a  representative  to  appear  on  her  behalf  at  the  said"
"Inquiry.  The  3rd  Petitioner  had  continued  to  appear  before  the  Tribunal,  had  given"
"evidence, and led the evidence of two witnesses on her behalf. Thus it is clear that"
"the 3rd Petitioner had participated fully before the Tribunal."

"land and that the Tribunal cannot make an Order without hearing the 1st Petitioner,"
"who  the  3rd  Petitioner  claimed  was  the  landlord  of  the  said  paddy land.  It  must  be"

"seeking  permission  to  appear  before  the  Tribunal,  although  the  1st  Petitioner,  by"
"virtue of the fact that she was living with the 3rd Respondent by that time, may have"
"been aware of the inquiry that was being conducted."
"B
y  its  Order  delivered  on  19th  May  2016,  the  Tribunal,  having  carefully  considered"
"the evidence that was led before it:"
