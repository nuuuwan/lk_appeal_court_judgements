"in  the  schedule  to  the  application.  The  schedules  in  both  applications  filed  in  the"
"Magistrates  Court  by 
the  Appellant 
to 
eject 
the 
respective  Respondents  are"
"identical.  Therefore,  of consent,  written  and  oral  submiss ions  of Counsel  were"
"made to cover both applications."
"The  Respondent  took  up  the  position  that,  she  is  the  owner  of the  land  in"
"issue  by  virtue  of Deed  of Declaration  No.  155  dated  24/06/2005.  Taking  into"
"the 
learned  Magistrate  made  order 
consideration  the  said  Deed  of  Declaration,"
"di smissing the Appellant's  application stating that the  said  land  is  not a  state  land"
"but a private land and  therefore,  the  Respondent is not liable to  be ejected from  the"
"land  as 
she 
is 
in  possession  of  the 
land  by  a 
legally  executed  Deed.  Being"
"aggrieved  by 
the  said  order  the  Appellant  filed  a  revision  application 
in  High"
"in  Trincomalee,  where  the 
learned  High 
Court  of the  Eastern  Province,  holden"
"Court Judge dismissed  the  said  application on  the  basis  that,  the  Appellant had  no"
"authority  to  institute  action,  since  the  Board  or Directors  had  not  delegated  such"
"powers 
to 
the  Chairman  of the  SLTDA,  (as  competent  Authority) 
to 
fil e 
this"
"application.  The Appellant is  before this  Court to  have the said judgment set aside."
"The following grounds of appeal  have been rai sed by the Appellant: -"
"I)  Did  the 
learned  Magistrate  erroneously  hold  that  the  land 
in  dispute  is  a"
"private land and therefore,  the  Respondent was entitled to possess the  land?"
"2)  Has 
the 
learned  Magistrate  erred 
in 
law  by  deciding 
that 
the  person 
to"
"whom summon s was  served could establ ish possession or occupation in  any"
"other manner than  producing a valid  permit issued  by the  State."
