"""The 
State  Lands 
(Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  was 
initially 
enacted  on"
"2510111979  in  order  to  make  provision for  the  recovery  of possession  of ""State"
"Lands"" from  persons  in  unauthorized possession or occupation  of the  said lands."
"Thus,  it  is  obvious  that  the  intention  of the  legislature  was  to  obtain  an  order  of"
"ejectment from 
the  Magistrate's  Court  when  the  occupation  or  possession  was"
"unauthorized ...."
"Thus,  one  could see  that  a  limitation  has  been placed on  the  scope  and ambit  of"
"the  inquiry before  the  Magistrate.  The  Magistrate  can  only satisfo him  whether  a"
"valid permit or  any  other  written  authority  of the  State  has  been  granted to  the"
"person  on  whom  summons  has  been  served  If the  language  of the  enactment  is"
"clear and unambiguous,  it  would not be  legitimate for the  Courts  to  add words  by"
"implication  into  the  language.  It  is  a  settled law  of interpretation  that  the  words"
"are  to  be  interpreted  as  they  appear  in 
the  provision,  simple  and grammatical"
"meaning  is 
to  be  given  to 
them,  and  nothing  can  be  added  or  subtracted.  The"
"Courts  must construe  the  words  as  they find it and cannot go  outside the  ambit of"
"the  section and speculate as  to  what the  legislature  intended  An  interpretation of"
"Section  9 which  defeats the  intent and purpose for which  it  was  enacted should be"
