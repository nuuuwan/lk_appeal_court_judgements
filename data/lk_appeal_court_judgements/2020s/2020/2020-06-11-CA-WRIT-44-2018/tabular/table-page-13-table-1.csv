"In its written submissions, the Petitioner has submitted that even if the revised"
"assessments were issued upon obtaining the necessary approvals, the 1st and"
"2nd Respondents have violated Section 235(3) and (4) of the Municipal Councils"
"Ordinance which require notices of assessment to be served on or left at the"
"premises of every occupier in a timely manner, thereby giving an occupier an"
"opportunity  to  voice  any  opposition  to  such  assessment  in  terms  of  Section"
"235(4).9 This Court is of the view that even if the assessment ‘P8’ was served"
"late, there was no legal impediment to the Petitioner objecting to the notice of"
"assessment  served  on  him.  This  Court  must  observe  that  according  to  ‘X2’,"
"over 500 residents out of the over 88100 assessments served in 2018, had in"
"fact objected to the assessments, and that the Petitioner too, could have done"
