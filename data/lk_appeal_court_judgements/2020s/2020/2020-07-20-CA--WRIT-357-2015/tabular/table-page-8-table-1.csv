"I  fully  understand  that  the  words  “for  every  Rs.1,000  or  part"
"thereof of the aggregate value of such number [of shares] Rs.5.00”"
"found in item 6 of the second Gazette is meaningless unless the"
"Minister  specifically  states  how  the  aggregate  value  of  such"
"number  of  shares  shall  be  decided:  whether  multiplied  by  par"

"“market  value”  but  also  states  who  shall  determine  the  market"
"value. 
  For  convenience, 
let  me  hereinafter  refer  to  Gazette"
"No.1439/1  as  the  “first  Gazette”.    Item  6  of  the  first  Gazette"
