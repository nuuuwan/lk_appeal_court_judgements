"by  Order  published 
in 
the  Gazette  on  every  “specified"
"instrument”."
"According  to  section  4(f)  of  the  Stamp  Duty  (Special  Provisions)"
"Act, “specified instrument” includes:"
"a share certificate on new or additional issue or on transfer"
"or assignment."
"The  Minister’s  Order  applicable  to  the  matter  at  hand  was"
"published 
in  Gazette  No.1465/19  dated  05.10.2006. 
  For"
"convenience, 
let  me  hereinafter  refer  to  this  Gazette  as  the"
"“second Gazette”.  Item 6 thereof reads:"
"Any  share 
certificate 
issued 
consequent 
to 
the 
issue,"
"transfer  or  assignment  of  any  number  of  shares  of  any"
"company"
"for every Rs.1,000 or part thereof of the aggregate value of"
"such Number – Rs. 5.00  (emphasis added)"
"The term “aggregate value” is not defined in the second Gazette."
"Nor is it defined in the Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act or in"
"the Stamp Duty Act, No. 43 of 1982, as amended."
"The contention of the Respondents is:"
"[T]he  term  “aggregate  value”  has  no  special  meaning  and"
"simply means the total value.  The word value  will have to"
"be 
interpreted  with  reference  to  the  parent  Act, 
i.e.  the"
"Stamp  Duty  Act,  which  as  explained  above  refers  to  the"
"market value."
