"unless  there  are  compelling,  cogent  reasons  to  do  so.    This  is"
"one of the main causes for law’s delays."
"The  Respondents’ 
firm  position  at 
the  argument  was 
the"
"Supreme Court decision is per incuriam.  But the position of the"
"Respondents  in  the  pleadings  is  different.  In  the  statement  of"
"objections, 
the  Respondents  say 
the  said  Judgement 
“was"
"delivered by  the  Supreme Court on 4th April 2014” and “the  said"
"judgment  was  not  enforced  with  effect  from  date  of  Stamp  Duty"

"Supreme  Court  Judgment,  and  in  light  of  the  decision  already"
"arrived  at,  there  is no  necessity  for  me to  consider  whether  the"
"said Supreme Court decision is per incuriam."
"As the Respondents highlight in the written submissions, writ is"
"a  discretionary 
remedy  and

"One of the technical objections taken up by the  Respondents is"
"laches  on 
the  part  of 
the  Petitioner

"jurisdiction  of  this  Court.    In  my  view,  the  Respondents  are"
"guilty  of 
laches 
for  taking  up  technical  objections 
including"
"laches  at  the  point  of  the  argument!    There  is  no  necessity  to"
"consider the belated technical objections of the Respondents one"
"by one."
