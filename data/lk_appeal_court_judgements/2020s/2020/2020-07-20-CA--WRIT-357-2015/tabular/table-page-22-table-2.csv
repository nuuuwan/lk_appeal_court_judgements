"observation 
of 
Justice  Wigneswaran 
in 
Senanayake 
v."
"Siriwardene:18"
"Courts  are 
fast  making  use  of 
technical  grounds  and"
"traversing  of  procedural  guidelines 
to  dispose  of  cases"
"without reaching out to the core of the matters in issue and"
"ascertain  the  truth  to  bring 
justice  to  the 
litigants.  This"
"tendency  is  most  unfortunate.  It  could  boomerang  on  the"
"judiciary as well as the existing judicial system."
