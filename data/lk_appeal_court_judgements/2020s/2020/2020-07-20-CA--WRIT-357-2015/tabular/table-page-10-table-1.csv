"Why did the Minister remove the part of the first Gazette which"
"states 
the  Commissioner  General  of 
Inland  Revenue 
shall"
"determine  the  market  value  of  the  shares  in  order  to  calculate"
"the stamp duty payable?"
"The explanation of the Respondents is “The [second] Gazette was"
"made  applicable  to  all  companies  and  as  such  there  was  no"
"necessity  to  specify  that  the  Assessor  will  determine  the  market"
"value. 
  Public  Quoted  companies  have  a  ready  market  value"
"available.”"
"There is no dispute that shares of public quoted companies have"
"a  readily  available  market  value  ascertainable  by  their  trading"
"price 
on 
the  Stock  Exchange. 
  But  what 
about  private"
"companies,  which  have  no  such  readily  available  market  value"
"on  their  shares?    Who  shall  determine  the  market  value  of  the"
"shares of private companies under the second Gazette?  Unless"
"the  Minister 
specifies  who 
shall  do 
so, 
the 
transferor  or"
"transferee  of  the  shares,  for  instance,  can  also  lay  claim  to"
"determining 
the  market 
value 
in  order 
to  obtain  a  more"
"favourable rate."
"The 
Respondents 
cannot 
say 
the  Minister 
had 
already"
"manifested  his  intention  in  the  first  Gazette,  and  therefore  the"
"taxpayer cannot be allowed to take advantage of an omission in"
"the  second  Gazette,  and  the  practice  under  the  former  shall"
"continue."
