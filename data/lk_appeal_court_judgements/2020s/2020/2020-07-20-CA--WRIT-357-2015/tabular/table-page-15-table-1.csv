"When  enacting  a  new  law  the  legislature  is  presumed  to"
"have had in contemplation the existing statutes on the same"
"subject,  and 
to  have  framed 
its  enactment 
in  reference"
"thereto."
"Subsequent  to  the  second  Gazette,  a  third  Gazette,  No.1864/2,"
"was 
issued  on  26.05.2014.  The  Respondents  say 
the 
third"
"Gazette  was  necessitated  by 
the  aforesaid  Supreme  Court"
"decision.  The third Gazette reads as follows:"
"Any  share 
certificate 
issued 
consequent 
to 
the

"transfer or assignment – Rs. 5.00 (emphasis added)"
"The  third  Gazette  explicitly  states  “aggregate  value”  is  “market"
"value”.  The third Gazette also clearly states who shall decide the"
"“market  value”,  differing  in  this  regard  from  both  section  71  of"
"the Stamp Duty Act, which stipulates “the Assessor” shall decide"
"the  market  value,  and 
the 
first  Gazette,  which  states 
“the"
"Commissioner General of Inland Revenue” shall so decide."
