"Secretary  of State for  the  Home  Deportment  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1139,  paras  45-46]  where  Lord"
"Justice Hedley states as follows:"
"""45.  The  proposed  duty is,  as  I have  said,  not  unthinkable -
indeed  many  people  might"
"consider  it very desirable  - but thinking  about  it  makes  it  rapidly  plain  that if it is  to be"
"introduced it should be by Parliament and not by the  courts.  Parliament has  the option,"
"which 
the  courts  do  not  have,  of extending  and  configuring  an  abligation 
to  consult"
"function by function.  It can also abandon or modify obligations to consult which experience"
"shows to be unnecessary ar unworkable and extend those  which seem to work well.  The"
"courts,  which act an larger principles, can do none of these things."
"46. 
It  is  here,  I  think,  that the  respondents'  conspectus  of statutory  provisions  for"
"consultation  is  relevant and  revealing.  While  it is  not, for reasons  I have given,  an  aid  to"
"the  construction  of the  Immigration  Act  1971,  it  illustrates  very  clearly  the  need

those 
whom  it  requires"
"members or representatives of a named class,  or with those representative organisations,"
"who appear to the minister or  body to be appropriate or (what is  not the same thing)  to"
"be  representative;  will sometimes dispense  with  the  requirement in  cases  of urgency or"
"where 
the  consultee  agrees  not  to  be  consulted;  will  sometimes  make  consultation"
"the  choice  of 
discretionary;  will  sometimes  make  consultation  obligatory  but  leave"
"consultees  to  the  discretion  of the  minister or body  concerned;  will  sometimes  require"
"to  the  minister  to  represent  interests  substantially 
consultation  with  those  appearing"
"affected or otherwise defined;  and may combine consultation  with  specified bodies  with"
"publication of a general invitation to make submissions. Two or more of these models may"
"In  one  remarkable  instance  (the  Recorded  Delivery  Service  Act  1962,  s. 
be  combined."
