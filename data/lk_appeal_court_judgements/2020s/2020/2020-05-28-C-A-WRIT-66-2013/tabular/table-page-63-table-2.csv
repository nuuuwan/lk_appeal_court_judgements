"he following passages from De Smith’s Judicial Review capture the essence of"
"the above argument:66"
"“A decision is irrational in the strict sense of that term if it is unreasoned; if"
"it  is  lacking  ostensible  logic  or  comprehensible  justification.  Instances  of"
"irrational  decisions  include  those  made  in  arbitrary  fashion,  perhaps  “by"
"spinning a coin or consulting an astrologer”67. In such cases claimant does"
"not have  to prove  that the  decision was “so bizarre  that its  author must"
"have been temporarily unhinged”, but merely that the decision simply fails"
"to “add up – in which, in other words, there is an error of reasoning which"
"robs the decision of logic”68."
