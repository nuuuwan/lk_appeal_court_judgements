 panel consisting of three members of the CAA had thereafter conducted an"
"inquiry into the said complaint of the 3rd Respondent on 9th October 2012, with"

"explained that it resulted in the discharge of coolant, which in turn resulted in"
"the  overheating  of  the  engine  and  that  the  damage  to  the  gasket  was  a"
