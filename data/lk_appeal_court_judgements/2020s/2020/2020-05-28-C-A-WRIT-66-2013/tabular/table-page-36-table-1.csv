"This  Court  has  already  outlined  what  occurred  with  the  vehicle  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent. The issue, as this Court sees it, was that the radiator hose had not"
"been fitted properly or it had become loose. A consequence of this issue was"
"the discharge of the coolant. Any person acquainted with motor vehicles, and"
"certainly  a  vehicle  agent  such  as  the  Petitioner  would  know  that  one  of  the"
"possible  consequences  of  an  engine  overheating  as  a  result  of  the  vehicle"
"being used without coolant, is the possibility of damage to the gasket. At least"
"when the vehicle was brought in for repairs for the second time, the Petitioner"
"ought to have checked the root cause for the rise in temperature and whether"
"such  rise  in  temperature  could  have  a  nexus  to  the  initial  problem  of  the"
"vehicle being used without coolant."
