"or  imposed  upon  or  assigned  to  the  CAA.  Furthermore,  in  terms  of  Section"
"8(n),  the  CAA  may  appoint  any  such  committee  or  committees  as  may  be"
"necessary to facilitate the discharge of the functions of the CAA."
"I
t is therefore the view of this Court that an inquiry into a complaint made to"
"the CAA can be conducted:"
"(
a)   by the CAA itself; or"
"(
b)   by a public officer to whom the function has been delegated in terms of"
"Section 6; or"
"(
c)  
by a Committee appointed in terms of Section 8(n)."
"T
his Court wishes to make two observations at this stage. The first is that the"
"Respondents  have  admitted  in  paragraph  21  of  its  Statement  of  Objections"
"that no delegation of authority had taken place.9 The second is that the option"
"at  (c)  can  be  pursued  only  to  facilitate  the  discharge  of  the  functions  of  the"
"CAA and not to discharge the functions of the CAA."
"W
hat 
is 
important  however  â€“  and  this 
is  the  thrust  of  the  first  argument"
"advanced on behalf of the Petitioner - is that the decision, or in other words,"
"the  opinion  that  must  be  formed  in  order  to  provide  the  relief  set  out  in"
"Section  13(4),  must  be  that  of  the  CAA.  Therefore,  even  if  an  inquiry  into  a"
"complaint 
is  conducted  by  a  committee  appointed  for  that  purpose,  the"
"responsibility  for  taking  the  final  decision  or  in  other  words,  of  forming  an"
"opinion in terms of Section 13(4), will always rest with the CAA."
"9 In any event, none of the members of the inquiry panel were Public Officers, which is a pre-condition for the"
"delegation of any function."
