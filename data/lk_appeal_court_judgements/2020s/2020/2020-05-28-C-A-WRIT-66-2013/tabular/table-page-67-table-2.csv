"whether the bus had in fact been rendered unserviceable, the Supreme Court"
"stated as follows:"
"“Next,  to  consider  the  defects  in  the  vehicle,  the  letters  written  by  the"
"defendants refer to the vehicle breaking down on 11thJanuary 1998 after"
"which  it  was  repaired  and  returned  to  the  defendants.  The  letters  also"
"refer  to  defects  in  the  lights,  the  front  and  rear  windscreens  not  being"
"properly fixed, repairs to the front hub, oil leaks, and defects in the front"
"shock absorbers. These are all defects which can be repaired."
"As  mentioned  earlier,  the  evidence  is  that,  these  defects  were  repaired"
"and the vehicle was handed back to the defendants on 27thJuly 1998. The"
"evidence indicates that the defendants continued to use the vehicle after"
"that. In these circumstances, it is not possible to reasonably conclude that,"
"the defects in the vehicle rendered the vehicle unusable.”"
