"Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  which  is  that  when  a  manufacturer  or  trader  has"
"extended  a  written  or  express  warranty,  as  in  this  case,  a  consumer  cannot"

"other words, the question is whether the consumer would be disentitled to the"
"protection  afforded  by  way  of  an  implied  warranty  under  Section  32(1)(d)"
