"for  the  goods  that  are  sold  to  be  ‘free  from  any  defects’  or  to  be  in  ‘perfect"
"condition’, an aggrieved consumer may even succeed in a claim where there is"
"a very minute and even negligible cosmetic defect on a product sold to them."
"Instead, the standard expected is ‘reasonable fitness for the purpose for which"
"it is supplied’."
