"The conclusions of the Inquiry Panel are not supported by the evidence"
"T
he fact that the 3rd Respondent purchased a KIA Sorento motor vehicle from"
"the  Petitioner  and  that  the  said  motor  vehicle  had  an  issue  on  the  date  of"
"purchase  is not in  dispute. The  fact that the Petitioner  carried out repairs on"
"several  occasions  but  all  arising 
from 
the 
loose 
radiator  hose, 
is  also"
"undisputed."
"T
he  Petitioner  states  that  the 
Inquiry  Panel  however  had  no  evidence  to"
"support its finding that the replacement of the gasket reduced the value of the"
"vehicle,  and  that  for  such  a  conclusion  to  be  valid,  it  must  be  supported  by"
"expert evidence or testimony of a person knowledgeable in the field of motor"
"vehicles.  This  Court  is  in  agreement  with  this  submission,  especially  since  no"
"material  has  been  placed  before  this  Court  that  the  members  of  the  Inquiry"
"Panel had expertise in motor mechanism. The 3rd Respondent did not place the"
"evidence  of  an  expert  to  support  the  position  that  the  replacement  of  the"
"gasket 
reduced 
the  value  of 
the  vehicle.  Neither  has 
the 
inquiry  panel"
"explained the basis for such conclusion. The Inquiry Panel has therefore arrived"
"at  a  conclusion,  which  ultimately  weighed  heavily  in  their  ultimate  decision"
"that the vehicle be replaced, without having any factual or legal basis for such"
"conclusion."
"T
he 
Inquiry  Panel  has  also  been 
influenced  by 
the 
fact 
that 
the  3rd"
"Respondentâ€™s ability to pursue his career as a dental surgeon was affected by"
"having  to  take  the  motor  vehicle  for  repairs  on  three  occasions.  It 
is  the"
"position of the Petitioner that this finding of the Inquiry Panel too is devoid of"
"evidence.  The  3rd  Respondent  was  employed  by  the  Government,  and  no"
"68"
