"Court in Benedict and Others vs. Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri",""
"Lanka and Others61 where it was held as follows:",""
"","“This  court does  not dispute  that the  first  respondent has a discretion in"
"","the matter. However, it is a discretion that has to be exercised reasonably,"
"fairly  and","justly.  As  Lord  Diplock  said  “the  administrative  discretion"
"","involves  a  right  to  choose  between  more  than  one  possible  course  of"
"","action  upon  which  there  is  room  for  reasonable  people  to  hold  differing"
"","opinions as to which is to be preferred.” – Secretary of State for Education"
"","v. Tameside Metropolitan B.C. The valid exercise of a discretion requires"
"","a  genuine  application  of  the  mind  and  a  conscious  choice  by  the  first"
"","respondent. The effect of the Monetary Law Act is not to set up the court"
"","as  an arbiter of the correctness  of one  view over the  other.  It is the first"
"","respondent  alone  who  can  take  such  a  decision  and,  provided  the  first"
"","respondent acts fairly and reasonably within the four corners of its lawful"
"jurisdiction,  this  court","in  my  opinion  cannot 
interfere.  Accordingly, 
it"
