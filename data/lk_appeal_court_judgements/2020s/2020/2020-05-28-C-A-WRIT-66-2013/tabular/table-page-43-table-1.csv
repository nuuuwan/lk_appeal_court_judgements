"reasonable  time.”  I  am  not  quite  sure  that  that  is  entirely  accurate.  The"
"relevant  time  is  the  time  of  sale.  But  there  is  no  doubt  what  the  judge"
"meant. If the car does not go for a reasonable time but the engine breaks"
"up  within  a  short  time,  that  is  evidence  which  goes  to  show  it  was  not"
"reasonably fit for the purpose at the time it was sold. On the evidence in"
"this  case,  the  engine  was  liable  to  go  at  any  time.  It  was  “nearing  the"
"point of  failure,” said the  expert Mr.  Wise. The  time  interval was  merely"
"“staving off the inevitable.” That shows that at the time of the sale it was"
"not reasonably fit for the purpose of being driven on the road.”"
