"39.  Section  \00 of the  Evidence Ordinance provided  that  recourse  was to  be had  to  English Law"
"in  the  case ofa Casus  Omissus.  Accordingly, making use  of Section  100,  Sri  Lankan Courts"
"applied  the  approach  taken  by  the  English  Law of Evidence  at the  time,  and  recognized  the"
"right  of an  Accused  to  make  an  unsworn  statement  from 
the  dock  in  the  case  of King  V."

The  prisoner"
"instead of 
may still if he prefers it,  make  an  unsworn statement from  the  dock,"
