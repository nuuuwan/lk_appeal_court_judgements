"33. 
In  the  instant case  Ananda, the  father  of the  complainant  was  not  even  listed  as  a  witness  in"
"the  indictment.  The defence  has  not  even  requested  the  court to  order the  prosecution to  call"
"Ananda as a witness.  It was also open for  the defence to  call  the witness if they so wished."
"34.  The husband  of the  complainant  was  not  called  as  a  witness  for  the  prosecution.  Even  in  his"
"unsworn statement from  the dock, the Appellant has taken up  the position that the  husband of"
"the  complainant  was  not  at  home  when  he  had  sex ual 
intercourse  with 
the  complainant."
"Hence,  prosecution not calling Ananda and  complainant's husband  has  not created any doubt"
"in the prosecution ' s case."
"35. 
It is  the contention of the  learned counsel  for  the  Appellant that the  learned High  Court Judge"
"has  not given proper weight to  the  Appellant's unsworn statement from  the dock."
"It would  be  pertinent at  this juncture to  refer to  the  legal  position with  regard to  the  unsworn 
36."
"statements  from  the  dock by  Accused  persons  and  the  history of the  right of the  Accused  to"
"make such statements."
"37.  As  elaborated  by  Professor  G.L.  Peiris 
in  hi s  article  ""UNSWORN  STATEMENTS  BY"
"ACCUSED PERSONS:  TRENDS IN THE COMMONWEALTH' published  in  1981,  in  the"
"early days  English  Law  did  not  permit  a  defendant  in  criminal  proceedings  the  right  to  give"
"evidence  in  his  own  defence.  The  law  of England  at  that  time  was  exposed  to  the  criticism"
"that exclusion of sworn testimony  by  the  Accused  gravely hampered a  blameless Accused  in"
"vindicating  his  innocence.  Thus,  the  position  in  England  was  changed  by  Section  1  of the"
"Criminal  Evidence  Act  of  1898  which  rendered  an  Accused  a  competent  witness  for  the"
"defence  in  all  criminal  cases. Furthermore, Section  I (h)  of the said  Act embodied the express"
"proviso  that,  ""Nothing  in  this  Act  shall affect ... any right  of the  person  charged,  to  make  a"
"statement  without  being sworn "".  Thus,  it  appears  that  proviso  to  Section  I  of the  Criminal"
"Evidence  Act No.  1898  is  what  allowed an  Accused, when called up  for  defence,  to  make an"
"unsworn  statement from  the dock."
"In  Sri  Lanka,  Section  120(6)  of the  Evidence  Ordinance  provides,  that  an  Accused  can  be  a 
38."
"competent witness in his  own behalf and  may  give evidence in  the same manner and  with the"
"like effect and  consequences as any  other witness.  Hence, even before the Criminal  Evidence"
