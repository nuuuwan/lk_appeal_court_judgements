"It may be  contended that Article  61A  of the Constitution  only prevents this Court"
"from exercising writ jurisdiction in  relation to orders or decisions made by the PSC"
"or  its  delegates  whereas  in  this  case  the  Petitioners  are  seeking  only  a writ  of"
"mandamus directing that a statutory duty be performed. Such a narrow application"
"of the constitutional ouster in Article 61A of the Constitution overlooks the purpose"
"of the ouster."
"In  applying the provisions  of Article 61A this Court must bear  in  mind the scheme"
"formulated in the 17th Amendment in regard to the public service. Unlike previously"
"the appointment, promotion, transfer,  disciplinary control and  dismissal  of public"
"officers  are  vested  with  the  PSC  and  not the  Cabinet  of Ministers  [Article  55(1)]."
