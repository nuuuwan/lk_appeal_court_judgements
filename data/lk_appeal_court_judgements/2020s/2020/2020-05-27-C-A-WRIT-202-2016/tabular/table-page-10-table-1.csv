"the  knowledge  of  the  4th  Respondent.    Although  the  incumbent"
"Divisional  Secretary  was  later  made  a  party  to  this  application,"
"he  has  opted  to  remain  silent.    In  any  event,  the  Government"
"Agent  could  not  have  taken  such  a  decision  arbitrarily  denying"

"there  is  no  evidence  to  the  effect  that  the  said  decision  was"
