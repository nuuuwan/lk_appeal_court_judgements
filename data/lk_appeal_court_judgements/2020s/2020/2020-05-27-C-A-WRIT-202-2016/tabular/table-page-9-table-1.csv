"part  of  it.    The  Tenement  List  had  been  prepared  in  order  to"
"issue  Grants  to  the  occupants,  as  seen  from  the  “Remarks”"
"column  of  4R2.  This  has  been 
further 
confirmed  by 
the"
"Divisional Manager of the Mahaweli Authority of Attanakadawala"
"by R3."
"The  Petitioner  also  admits  in  paragraph  7  of  the  petition  that"
"“under 
the  Permit  bearing  No.  528

"Learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  places  special  emphasis  on"
"the endorsement “FCP 29 – from 456 only 3 Acres” appearing on"
"the 
first  page  of  R1,  presumably  made  by 
the  Additional"
"Government  Agent  of  Polonnaruwa  on  the  same  day  the  4th"
"Respondent’s name was inserted as the Permit holder.  This was"
"in 2010.  It is not clear on what basis the said endorsement was"
