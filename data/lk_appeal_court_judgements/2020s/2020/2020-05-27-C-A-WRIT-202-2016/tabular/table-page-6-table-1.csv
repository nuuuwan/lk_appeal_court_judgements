"successor,  the  4th  Respondent  failed  to  succeed  to  the  land  in"
"terms of section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, and"
"therefore, 
inserting 
the  name  of 
the  4th  Respondent  as 
the"
"Permit holder in R1 and the consequent Grant issued in favour"
"of the 4th Respondent are illegal."
"After 
the 
full  argument, 
learned  Counsel 
for 
the  Petitioner"
"abandoned  this  position,  as  there  is  overwhelming  evidence  to"
"prove  possession  of  the 
land  by  the  4th  Respondent,  which"
"negates the contention that the 4th Respondent failed to succeed"
"to the land despite nomination."
"The next argument of learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that,"
"in any event, the 4th Respondent could not have been granted 4"
"Acres and 41 Perches; the maximum which could be granted to"
"the  4th Respondent  is only  3  Acres,  and  the  balance  portion  of"
"the 
land  depicted 
in  Plan  P2/4R1  should  be  given 
to 
the"
"Petitioner."
"Counsel  says  this  on  the  basis  that  the  Permit  P3/R1  refers  to"
"only 3 Acres, and not 4 Acres and 41 Perches.  He argues that it"
"is the Permit which matures into a Grant, and therefore a larger"
"extent than what is stated in the Permit cannot be conveyed by"
"way of a Grant."
"I  regret  my  inability  to  agree  with  this  argument  for  several"
"reasons."
"When 
the  Permit  was 
issued, 
there  was  no  Survey  Plan."
"Therefore, 
the 
land  was  described 
in  the  Permit  as  a 
land"
"“containing  in  extent  about  3.0  acres”  without  any  boundaries."
