"misconceived and unknown to the law and therefore neither relief could be granted,",""
"this Court held as follows:",""
"","“It is necessary for the Petitioner to specify the writ he is seeking supported by"
"","specific averments why such relief is sought. Even though the Petitioner has set"
"out","in  the  caption  that  ""In  the  matter  of  an  application  … for  writ  of  quo"
"","warranto  and  prohibition""  there  is  no  supporting  averment  specifying  the  writ"
"","and there is no prayer as regards the writ that is being prayed for. The failure to"
"","specify the writ therefore renders the application bad in law.”"
