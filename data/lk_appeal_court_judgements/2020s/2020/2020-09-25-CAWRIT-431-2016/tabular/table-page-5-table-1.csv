"where there is a specific prayer for a Writ, and the power of this Court to issue the"
"said Writ, albeit in a modified form."
"T
he learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General has also submitted that the relief sought"
"by the Petitioners is broad and vague. The order sought in paragraph (a) above is not"
"limited  to  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  but 
is  directed  at 
‘any  other  person  or"
"authority named’ by this Court. Similarly, the relief sought in paragraph (b)(iii) above"
"is  directed  at  any  Government  authority  which  demonstrates  that  the  Petitioners"
"themselves  do  not  know  who  has  the  power  to  name  roads  etc.  This  Court, 
in"
"Sipkaduwa Anthony Danawathie Wimalasuriya vs  Commissioner  General  of  Lands"
"and Others2 held that, “This Court cannot issue writs in such vague terms against an"
"array  of  Government  Officials.  This  application,  filed  seeking  vague  reliefs,  shall,  in"
"my view, be dismissed in limine on that basis.”"
"I
n the above circumstances, this Court upholds the above legal objections raised by"
"the  learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General,  with  the  consequence  being  that  this"
"application is liable to be dismissed in limine."
"H
owever, for purposes of completeness, this Court would assume that the principal"
"relief  sought  by  the  Petitioners  is  a  Writ  of  Mandamus,  and  consider  whether  this"
"Court is in a position to grant that relief."
"T
he  Petitioners  have  submitted 
that  Paddiruppu 
is  a  small  village  which  has"
"approximately  250  families.  While  it  has  its  own  Grama  Niladhari  division,  several"
"public 
institutions  such  as 
the  Paddiruppu  National  School,  Paddiruppu  Zonal"
"Education Office etc are situated within Paddiruppu. The argument of the Petitioners"
"is  that  the  said  bus  stand  is  situated  wholly  within  the  village  of  Paddiruppu,  and"
"therefore naming the bus stand as the Kaluwanchikudi bus stand is in violation of the"
"rights of the people of Paddiruppu."
"T
he 4th Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Manmunai South and Eruvil Pattu in his"
"Statement 
of  Objections 
has 
admitted 
that 
Paddiruppu 
is 
situated  within"
"Kaluwanchikudi.  He  has  stated  that  the  Paddiruppu  Grama  Niladhari  division  was"
"established in 2007, and is one of the six Grama Niladhari divisions coming within the"
"2 CA (Writ) Application No. 47/2014; CA Minutes of 29th July 2018(9)."
