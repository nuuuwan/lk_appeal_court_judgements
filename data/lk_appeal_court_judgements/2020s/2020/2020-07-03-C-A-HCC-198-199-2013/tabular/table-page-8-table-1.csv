"Perusal of the judgment of the  trial  Court indicates that it had considered"
"all 
the  contradictions  and 
the 
two  omissions  marked  off 
the  eye  witness's"
"evidence,  in  coming  to 
the  conclusion  that  the  said  witness  is  a  truthful  and"
"reliable  witness.  Having  examined 
the  extent  to  which  the  eye  witness  had"
"contradicted  and  over 
the  material  he  had  contradicted  himself  with  his"
"statement made to Police, this Court concurs with the view of the trial Court that"
"none of these contradictions were on the vital aspects of his testimony.  Although"
"a significant number had been marked, that did not affect the basic version of the"
"witness. 
He  varied  with  his  version  only  on 
trivialities  which  are  clearly"
"attributable to failing human memory."
