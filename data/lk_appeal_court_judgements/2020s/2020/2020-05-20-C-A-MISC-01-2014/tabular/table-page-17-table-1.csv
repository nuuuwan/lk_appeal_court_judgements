"This  Court  has  examined  the  evidence  of the  Secretary,  Board  of Architectural"
"Education and the evidence of the Appellant. The Appellant does not deny that"
"he  sent the  letters  marked  'P4'  and  'PS'  to the  Respondent.  The  names  of the"
"persons  who  have  been  copied 
the  said 
letters  have  been  set  out  at  the"
"bottom  thereof  and

"related  to the failure on the part of the members of the  Board  of Architectural"
"Education to look into the alleged irregularities, in their official capacity."
"The  Appellant  submitted  further  that  'P4'  and 
'PS'  only  relates  to  a  matter"
"affecting  the  Architectural  Profession  in  general  and  the  actions/inactions  of"
"the  Board  of Architectural  Education  and/or the  Respondent in  relation  to one"
"particular  incident  in  their  official  capacity  as  office  bearers  of the  Board  of"
