On  receipt of such  information or complaint,  Institute shall adhere  to"
"the 
procedure 
hereinafter 
set 
out, 
whether 
the 
informer 
or"
"complainant is  identifiable or non-identifiable."""
"The 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  Respondent  very  correctly  submitted  that  the"
"above  provisions  as  well  as  Regulation  9  (3)  -
(8)  of 'Pl'  makes  it abundantly"
"clear that the Respondent may act on  information received,  or on  a complaint."
"This  Court is  in  agreement with the said  submission  of the learned  Counsel  for"
"the  Respondent.  This  Court  is  therefore  of the view that a formal  complaint is"
"not  required  for the  Respondent  to  initiate  disciplinary  proceedings  against  a"
"Chartered  Architect,  Architect or an  Architectural  Licentiate.  In  any  event,  it is"
"clear  from  the  letter  sent  by  the  Secretary,  Board  of Architectural  Education"
"that he  was  aggrieved  by the fact that the Appellant had  circulated the  letters"
"'P4' and  'PS'  among the general  membership.  His  inquiry as  to what action the"
"Respondent 
intends 
to 
take, 
is 
a  clear 
indication 
that  he  wanted 
the"
"Respondent to act  on  his  letter.  In  the  said  circumstances,  this  Court does  not"
"see  any  merit 
in 
the  second  submission  of  the 
learned  Counsel 
for 
the"
"Appellant."
"The  third  submission  of the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  was  that  the"
"members  of the  Disciplinary  Committee  had  failed  to  evaluate  the  evidence"
"that  was 
led  before  them  in 
the  context  of the  charges  framed  against  the"
"Appellant,  and 
that 
the  members  of  the  Disciplinary  Committee 
failed 
to"
"consider 
the  material 
that  was  placed 
before 
them 
in  arriving  at 
their"
"conclusion."
