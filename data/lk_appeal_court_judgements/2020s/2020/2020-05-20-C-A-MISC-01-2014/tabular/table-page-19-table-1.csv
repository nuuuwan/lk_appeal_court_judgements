"","Appellant  on  this  issue.  Unfortunately,  the  Respondent,  for  whatever  reason,"
"","had  chosen  to ignore the  said  letter, and  the  Appellant therefore  did  not have"
"","the  benefit of a reply to an  issue  which the Appellant was  raising  in the general"
"","interest of the membership, and  not with regard  to the professional conduct of"

"","The  failure  on  the  part  of the  Respondent  to  reply  'P3'  resulted  in  'P4'  being"

"","reference  was 
Board  of  Architectural  Education  by  name,  although  such"
"","limited 
to  steps 
that  were 
taken 
in  his  capacity  as  Secretary,  Board  of"

'P4' 
too  went  unanswered
