"By  a further  letter dated  18th  October  2010,  marked  'P12',  the  Appellant  had"
"stated  that  he  was  not  trying  to  discredit  the  profess ion  but  rather  to  keep"
"informed  of  the  alleged 
irregularities 
that  were 
members  of the  profess ion"
"taking  place .  The  Appellant  had 
reiterated 
that  he  has  not  maliciou sly  or"
"unfairly criticised  or attempted  to discred it any  person  except the  submission"
"of relevant facts."
"The  Report of the Investigation Committee dated 8th  December 20102 states as"
"follows:"
"""The  Committee  was  of  the  view  that  the 
letters  under  reference  by"
"Architect  Nalaka  Jayaweera  are  replete  with 
instances  and  references"
"where he has made unfounded criticism against Members and the Council."
"The  right  to  criticism  does  not  entitle  a  Member  to  make  defamatory"
"statements against another which could tantamount to disrepute.  Further,"
"in  several instances Architect Nalaka  Jayaweera  has made  allegations by"
"identifying  Members  of SLiA  by name,  when they were only carrying out"
"duties 
on 
voluntary 
and  honorary 
capacity 
as 
either  Chairman,"
"Secretary,  or as a  Member of a  Board or a  Committee.  By  making such"
"allegations  public  by  email  distribution  there  is  a  valid  cose  of bringing"
"disrepute and damage to the reputation of such members."
"Having 
considered  all 
aspects  of 
the 
Investigation, 
the  Committee"
"unanimously agreed that,"
"2 This report had been  produced before the Disciplinary Committee."
