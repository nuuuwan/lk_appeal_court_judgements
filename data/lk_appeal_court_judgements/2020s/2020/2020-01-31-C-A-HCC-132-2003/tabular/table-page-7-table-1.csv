"21.  Learned  High  Court  Judge,  after  considering  the  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors,  had"
"imposed  on the  Appellant a  sentence of 10  years  rigorous  imprisonment.  In  his  Judgment"
"at  page 244 of the brief,  the  learned  High Court Judge  rightly concluded that the  Appellant"
"caused  the  injuries  on  the  deceased  with  the  intention  of causing  such  bodily  injury  as  is"
"likely  to  cause death.  Therefore,  in  terms of section 297 of the  Penal  Code, the prescribed"
"punishment  is  imprisonment  of either description  for  a  term  which  may  extent  to  twenty"
"years  and  shall  also  be  liable  to  a  fine.  However,  it  has  escaped  the  mind  of the  learned"
"Trial  Judge  that  in  addition  to  the  sentence  of imprisonment,  the  law  also  prescribes  a"
"mandatory fine.  Hence, in addition to  the  10 years  rigorous imprisonment, the Appellant is"
"ordered  to  pay  a  fine  of Rs.50001-,  in  default  the  Appellant  is  ordered  to  serve  another 6"
