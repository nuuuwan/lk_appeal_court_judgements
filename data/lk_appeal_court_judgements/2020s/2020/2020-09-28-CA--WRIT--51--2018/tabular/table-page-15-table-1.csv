"oath should be carried out by a person who is permitted to"
"do so under our law."
"None of the cases cited by the Petitioners dealt with the effect of"
"the  proviso 
to  section  12(2)  of 
the  Oaths  and  Affirmations"
"Ordinance.    Airport  and  Aviation  Services  (Sri  Lanka)  Limited  is"
"the only case, as far as I am aware, that particularly deals with"
"this section. The Petitioners do not cite any other authority that"
"has given a different interpretation to the proviso to section 12(2)"
"of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance. The dicta contained in"
"the  said  Supreme  Court  Judgment  in  relation  to  the  proviso  to"
"section 12(2) is the ratio decidendi of the Judgment.  This Court"
"is bound by that Judgment."
"In 
the  Supreme  Court  case  of  Pushpadeva  v.  Senok  Trade"
"Combine Ltd,4 cited by the Petitioners, the proviso to section 12"
"of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance was not considered.  In"
"the said case, the two preliminary objections raised in respect of"
"the supporting affidavit were: (a) there was no affirmation at the"
"beginning  of  the  affidavit,  and  (b)  the  affirmant  did  not  specify"
"his  religion  in  the  affidavit.  The  Supreme  Court  rejected  both"
"objections 
for 
obvious 
reasons. 
Although 
there  was 
no"
"affirmation  at 
the 
commencement  of 
the  affidavit, 
it  was"
"observed  “the  fact  that  the  affirmant  has  affirmed  before  the"
"Commissioner  for  Oaths  is  clearly  reflected  in  the  jurat  to  the"
"affidavit.”    The  Supreme  Court  further  held  that  so  long  as  the"
"deponent  has  affirmed  to  the  averments  of  the  affidavit,  failure"
"to  mention 
the 
religion  does  not  affect 
the  validity  of 
the"
"affidavit.  The 
religion, 
according 
to 
the  Respondent,  was"
"necessary to  decide whether the  deponent  shall  swear or affirm"
"4 [2015] BLR 40."
