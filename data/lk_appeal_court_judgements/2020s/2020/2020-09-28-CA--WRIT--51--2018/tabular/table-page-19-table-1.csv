"that,  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  before  whom  the  affidavit  of  the"
"Petitioner  was  affirmed  did  not  have  territorial  jurisdiction  to"
"attest the affidavit.  When this objection  was  raised, apparently"
"at  the  stage  of  the  argument,  the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  in"
"his written submission sought the permission of the Court to file"
"a  fresh  affidavit  in  support  of  the  averments  contained  in  the"
"petition.    The  Divisional  Bench,  which  was  constituted  for  the"
"sole purpose of deciding this question of law (i.e. whether a fresh"
"affidavit can be allowed at that stage of the case) held in favour"
"of  the  Petitioner  and  granted  permission  to  file  a  fresh  affidavit"
"on  identical  terms.  It  is  unfortunate  that  the  Petitioners  in  the"
"instant case did not make an application to file a fresh affidavit"
"in  place  of  the  defective  one,  even  at 
least 
in  their  written"
"submissions tendered after the argument."
"Unless such an application is made by the Petitioners, the Court"
"cannot, 
in 
this 
contested  matter  where 
eminent 
senior"
"Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  are  appearing 
for 
the  opposing  parties,"
"direct  the  Petitioners  to 
file  a 
fresh  affidavit 
instead  of  the"
"defective  one.  Such  conduct, 
in  my  view,  would  give 
the"
"impression  to  the  contesting  Respondents  that  the  Court 
is"
"biased in favour of the Petitioners, which does not auger well for"
"the  justice  system.    The  dicta  of  Lord  Hewart  C.J.  in  Rex  v."
"Sussex Justices, Ex parte McCarthy8 is worth repeating:"
