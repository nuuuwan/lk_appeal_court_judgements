"his identity card. Next to the Major, a Police Sergeant serving in his own station"
"who left the police station on leave was seated."
"The Major was dressed in civilian clothes and had a black coloured large bag on"
"his lap. When he directed the Major to open the bag, he has observed that he"
"panicked, and was reluctant to open the bag, but had stated that he wishes to"
"speak with the witness. As the bag was with a padlock, the witness has directed"
"the person to get the key, for which he has replied that the key is in Colombo."
"Having  failed  to  get  the  person  to  open  the  bag  voluntarily,  the  witness  has"
"searched his trouser pockets and found a key inside the purse the person was"
"carrying, which appeared to be the key of the padlock. When the witness opened"
"the bag using the key the person had in his possession, he has discovered 15"
"neatly packed and taped parcels of about 10 x 06 inches. Realizing that these"
"packets may carry prohibited drugs through his experience, he has pierced one"
"of the parcels and had taken out a small sample of the powder like content inside,"
"and had confirmed for himself that the contents are Diacetylmorphine or Heroin."
"Accordingly,  PW-01  has  arrested  the  person  who  possessed  the  drugs,  after"
"informing the charge against him. At the trial, he has identified the appellant as"
"the person who was arrested by him. Apart from the parcel that was on the lap"
"of the appellant, he had found another bag under the seat, where he has found"
"a camouflaged army uniform as well as a uniform of an Army Major. The arrest"
"has been made at 15.15 hours."
"After a brief inspection, he has taken charge of the productions and the appellant"
"and had decided to immediately go back to his police station, as the area where"
"the  detection  took  place  was  a  highly  insecure  area  due  to  constant  terrorist"
"activities. His intention had been to reach a secured location as soon as possible"
"to conduct further investigations."
"In his evidence, the witness has described the steps he took to secure the safety"
"of the productions and the appellant, who was under his custody. At the police"
"station, he has weighed the gross weight of the 15 packets he took into custody"
