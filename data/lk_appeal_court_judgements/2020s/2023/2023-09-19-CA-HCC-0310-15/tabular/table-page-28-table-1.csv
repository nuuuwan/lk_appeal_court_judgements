"The evidence of PW-01 had been that he received two pieces of information few"
"minutes  apart  from  each  other  over  the  phone.  The  1st  one  had  been  from  a"
"person who spoke broken Sinhalese and informed him about a person carrying"
"a suspicious parcel, and the 2nd information had been from a Captain attached"
"to the Thalladi army camp about a person carrying a suspicious parcel suspected"
"to be a weapon."
"Although  evidence  of  the  relevant  army witnesses  is  suggestive  that  they  took"
"steps to inform the name of the appellant to the police, there is nothing to say"
"that the army captain who spoke to PW-01 and provided the 1st information to"
"him, informed the name of the suspected person as Major Kariyawasam who is"
"the appellant. I find no reason to believe that if the information was in relation"
"to a specific army officer, for PW-01 to not make a note of the name of the person,"
"as it would be much helpful for him to conduct the raid."
"The evidence of PW-01 had been that he opened the bag found in the possession"
"of the appellant which had a padlock using the key he found in one of his purse"
"pockets and used a small knife he was carrying to create an opening in one of"
"the  parcels  found  in  order  to  take  out  a  sample  of  what  was  inside.  The"
"prosecution witnesses have clearly identified the bag marked P-05 which had its"
"cover stitched on a part of it indicating a repair has been done to it previously."
"When the bag was produced as evidence, no specific questions had been asked"
"on the basis that the bag was cut open."
"However,  it  appears  that  when  the  appellant  gave  evidence,  he  has  chosen  to"
"state  that  the  bag  was  cut  open  by  the  police  and  that  is  the  reason  for  the"
"stitches, which appears to be a repair done to the torn off part of the bag. It was"
"contended that this opening was created when one of the officers of the raiding"
"party used a cleaning rod of a T-56 weapon to force open the bag, which clearly"
"appears to be a story created as a result of an afterthought. I find no basis to"
"consider it in favour of the appellant."
