"When considering the evidence of PW-04 in its totality, there cannot be any doubt"
"that  he  was  telling  the  truth  as  to  what  happened  on  that  day.  The  evidence"
"clearly shows that he has no reason to lie by creating a story like this against a"
"senior officer of the army who has no connection to him or any animosity with"
"him."
"Similarly, I am of the view that the other contradictions referred to in the case"
"are very minor in its nature that had not created any doubt as to the evidence of"
"the  prosecution  witnesses,  as  correctly  considered  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge.  Therefore,  I  do  not  find  any  basis  for  the  argument  that  the  said"
"contradictions had created a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  strenuously  argued  that  the  incident  of  the"
"burning of the finger of the appellant mentioned by the witnesses do not tally"
"with the Medico-Legal Examination Form (MLEF) produced in evidence, and it"
"was his position that this shows that the position of the appellant that he was"
"never taken to a hospital, but was taken to a place resembling a hospital and"
"not produced before a doctor was credible."
"If one reads the relevant portions of the evidence, it is clear that the burning of"
"the finger spoken of by the witnesses are not getting it burnt due to a fire. The"
"evidence  was  that  when  the  appellant  was  asked  to  place  his  left  thumb"
"impression  on  the  sealing  wax  (ලාකඩ)  which  was  in  hot  melted  form,  the"
"appellant  did  not  wet  his  finger  properly  as  instructed  before  doing  so,  which"
"resulted  in  his  finger  getting  burned.  It  is  clear  that  this  does  not  amount  to"
"getting  burn  injuries  in  its  proper  sense  but  a  temporary  incapacitation  only."
"That may be the very reason why there is no indication of any injury in the MLEF"
"produced in relation to the appellant in the Court."
"I find no basis to accept the appellant’s version that he was taken to a place that"
"resembles a hospital but not produced before a doctor. I have no reason to believe"
"that  the  appellant  being  a  senior  army  officer,  for  the  arresting  officer  to  take"
