"him near a hospital and bring him back without producing him to a doctor, or a"
"doctor of a hospital  will sign and hand  over the MLEF back to a police officer"
"knowing very well what such a step would lead to under the given circumstances."
"The  PW-04  who  was  with  the  appellant  when  he  obtained  the  bag  from  an"
"unknown person has stated that when he came back to the motorbike, he was"
"carrying a black coloured bag with a strap hung around the shoulder, but PW-"
"01,  the  arresting  officer  and  PW-08,  who  assisted  him,  both  have  not  stated"
"anything about the bag they detected from the possession of the appellant having"
"a strap. The said bag which has been marked as a production (P-05) at the trial"
"had no strap that can be hung around the shoulder. It was the position of the"
"learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  came  into  an"
"incorrect assumption that PW-08 who assisted PW-01 in the arrest had identified"
"a strap in the bag. However, it appears that under re-examination what the PW-"
"08 has referred to as a bag with a strap was the bag carried by the appellant"
"when he came to the army camp and had with him when he was arrested at the"
"checkpoint by the police."
"Even if it was a misdirection by the learned High Court Judge, I do not find it a"
"matter  that  creates  any  prejudice  towards  the  appellant.  The  witnesses  have"
"given credible evidence as to the bag found in the possession of the appellant. It"
"has  been  marked  and  identified  at  the  trial.  Although  there  is  no  explanation"
"about  a  strap  that  was  spoken  by  PW-04,  that  is  not  a  reason  that  can  be"
"concluded  in  favour  of  the  appellant  as  the  evidence  in  its  totality  creates  no"
"doubt as to that fact."
"Although it was contended that there was a glaring contradiction with regard to"
"the  information  received  and  also  between  the  evidence  of  army  and  police"
"witnesses, which shows that the police knew the name of the appellant at the"
"time of arrest, I do not find any merit in that contention either."
