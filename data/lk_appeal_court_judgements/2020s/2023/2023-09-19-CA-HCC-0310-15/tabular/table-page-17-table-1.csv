"•","The  learned  High  Court  Judge’s  comment  in  the  judgement  that  the"
"","defence did not challenge the evidence of the driver of the bus is untenable,"
"","because 
the  driver’s  evidence  was 
favourable 
to 
the  defence  as 
it"
"","contradicted with PW-01."
"•","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  made  an  erroneous  comment  in  the"
"","judgement that the appellant has failed to ask any questions from PW-01"
"","of the fact that he was outside the bus when the police arrived."
"•","There  is  no  proper  acceptance  of  the  prosecution  evidence  on  the  basis"
"","that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, nor a"
"","rejection of the appellant’s evidence with reasons. The learned High Court"
"","Judge failed to consider the intermediatory position where the appellant’s"
"","evidence  is  neither  accepted  nor  rejected,  in  which  case  the  appellant"
"","should have been acquitted."
