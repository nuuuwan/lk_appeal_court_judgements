"In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Devunderage Nihal (2011) 1 SLR 409,"
"it was held:"
"“There is no requirement in law that a particular number of witnesses shall"
"in any case be required for the proof of any fact. Unlike in a case where an"
"accomplice or a decoy is concerned, in any other case there is no requirement"
"in law that the evidence of a Police Officer who conducted an investigation"
"or  raid  resulting  in  the  arrest  of  an  offender  need  to  be  corroborated  on"
"material particulars.”"
