"For the reasons as stated above, I find no basis to consider that the padlock and"
"the key was not a production before the Court."
"Another position taken up by the learned President’s Counsel was that according"
"to the evidence of PW-01, all the passengers were inside the bus when he reached"
"the checkpoint where the bus was stopped. According to the evidence of PW-05,"
"the driver of the bus, he was outside of the bus when the police party came to"
"the checkpoint. The appellant has given evidence and had claimed that when the"
"police  party  came,  he  was  also  outside  of  the  bus  having  a  cigarette,  and  he"
"decided  to  get  down  from  the  bus  because  the  bus  was  kept  parked  there  for"
"about half an hour."
"The position of the learned President’s Counsel was that, the learned High Court"
"Judge  failed  to  consider  these  facts  that  are  in  favour  of  the  appellant  in  his"
"judgement."
"He found fault with the learned High Court Judge’s comment that the appellant"
"did  not  challenge  the  evidence  of  the  driver  (PW-05),  on  the  basis  that  it  was"
"untenable,  because,  there  was  no  necessity  for  the  appellant  to  challenge  the"
"evidence as the evidence was in fact favourable to the appellant’s position."
"It needs to be noted that what the PW-01 has stated in his evidence was that all"
"the  passengers  who  travelled  in  the  bus  were  inside  the  bus  and  they  were"
"checked while being inside. He has not referred to the positioning of the driver"
"at that time. In his evidence, the driver has stated that after he was informed to"
"wait for about 5 minutes to pick up the OIC of Murukkan police who were going"
"on leave, he stopped the bus and got down from it to follow the usual formalities"
"of entering the details of his bus in the book maintained at the checkpoint. He"
"has stated that while he was in that process, the police party came, which was"
"within  few  minutes of  him  stopping  the  bus.  His  evidence was  that  the  police"
"officers entered the bus and arrested the appellant after they conducted a search."
