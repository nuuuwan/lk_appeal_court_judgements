"There was nothing in the evidence of the driver other than to indicate that in fact"
"the appellant was arrested while he was inside the bus. He has well remembered"
"the appellant because he travelled in the same bus when he came to the area"
"and got down near Thalladi camp. He has stated that the appellant got into the"
"bus near the army point at zone 11 Uilankulama. He has specifically stated that"
"because of the war situation that existed, they make it a point to remember the"
"passengers and their belongings."
"I  find  nothing  to  conclude  that  the  evidence  of  PW-05  was  in  favour  of  the"
"appellant.  As  contended  correctly  by  the  learned  DSG  and  considered  by  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge,  if  the  stand  of  the  appellant  was  different  to  the"
"evidence  given  by  PW-05,  he  should  have  been  confronted  with  that  position"
"when he gave evidence and was subjected to cross-examination. PW-05 being a"
"civilian witness, the position taken up by the appellant in his evidence should"
"have been put to him and confront him at the trial."
"The  appellant  has  come  out  with  this  position  when  the  PW-01  was  cross-"
"examined, but had failed to take a similar stand when the PW-05â€™s evidence was"
"led at the trial. Although he has given evidence and stated that he was outside"
"the bus when the police party came, that in itself does not create any doubt as"
"to the evidence of the officers who conducted the raid and arrested him and that"
"of PW-05."
