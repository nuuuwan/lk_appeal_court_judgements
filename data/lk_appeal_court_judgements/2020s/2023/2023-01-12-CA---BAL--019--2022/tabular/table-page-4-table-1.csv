"Hence as the instant act has very clearly stated that priority should be given"
"for matters under this act over the other matters, this Court is of the view"
"that  it  is  only  but  fair  that  the  suspect  in  the  instant  matter  should  be"
"enlarged on bail."
"As  such  the  instant  application  for  bail  is  allowed  and  we  direct  that  the"
"learned  Magistrate  to  enlarge  the  above-mentioned  suspect  on  suitable"
"conditions of bail."
