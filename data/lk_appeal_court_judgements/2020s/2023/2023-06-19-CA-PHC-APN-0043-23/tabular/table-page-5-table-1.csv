"the identification of the accused."
"The plain reading of the above grounds reflects that these are challenges to the"
"facts  placed  before  the  trial  Court  and  are  not  circumstances  that  can  be"
"considered  as  exceptional  circumstances  which  warrants  the  invoking  of  the"
"revisionary powers of this Court."
"Although the petitioner claims that the learned High Court Judge has failed to"
"draw his attention to the above-mentioned grounds, it is clear from the judgment"
"of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  as  well  as  the  judgement  of  the  learned"
"Magistrate,  the  relevant  facts  had  drawn  attention  of  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge, as well as the learned Magistrate."
"For a party aggrieved by a judgement pronounced by a High Court in exercising"
"its appellate jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution, the remedy"
"available is to file an appeal before the Supreme Court with leave first had and"
"obtained either from the relevant High Court or the Supreme Court itself. The"
"petitioner has failed to exercise his right of appeal, but has filed this application"
"some two years after the pronouncement of the High Court judgement."
"It is essential for a person who is seeking the discretionary remedy of revision"
"from this Court to explain his failure to file an appeal in the correct forum as"
"required by law and the delay in coming by way of revision before this  Court."
"Giving  an  explanation,  the  petitioner  has  stated  in  his  petition  that  due  to  a"
"default of his previously retained Attorney-at-Law, an appeal against the High"
"Court  judgement  was  filed  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  where  it  was  dismissed  for"
"filing the appeal in the wrong Court. It is thereafter only the petitioner has sought"
"the revisionary remedy from this Court by submitting this application."
