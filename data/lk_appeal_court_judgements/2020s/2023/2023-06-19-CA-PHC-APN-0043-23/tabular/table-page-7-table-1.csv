"his evidence rings to be true, as a general rule, the Court may act on the"
"evidence of a single witness though uncorroborated."
"In  this  action,  the  evidence  of  PW-01  and  that  of  the  investigating  officer  has"
"been evaluated in its correct perspective and the learned trial Judge has come"
"to  his  findings  accordingly.  Although  the  petitioner  has  initially  taken  up  the"
"position stating that he was shown to the PW-01 before the identification parade"
"was  held,  however, 
after 
PW-01 
answered 
that  position  under 
cross-"
"examination, has taken up the position that the PW-01 was shown a photograph"
"of him and he was identified at the parade because of that."
"The  learned  trial  Judge  as  well  as  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well"
"considered  these  positions  and  had 
found  no  reasons  to  accept  the  said"
"contentions  and  has  determined  that  it  had  not  created  any  doubt  as  to  the"
"evidence of PW-01."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  also  pointed  out  that  the  identification"
"parade notes had been marked through the Court interpreter without calling the"
"relevant witnesses and affording the petitioner to confront them in that regard."
"However,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  in  terms  of  section  414  (2)  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.  15  of  1979, 
the  depositions 
regarding  an"
"identification  parade  held  by  a  Magistrate  or  Justice  of  Peace  can  be  marked"
"without calling the relevant witnesses."
"It appears that the identification parade notes had been marked in terms of the"
"above  provision  of 
law.  When  this  was  done,  at  the  Magistrate  Court  of"
"Homagama, the petitioner had been represented by his Attorney-at-Law. There"
"had  been  no  application  to  call  the  relevant  witnesses  before  the  Court  as"
"required  in  terms  of  the  proviso  of  section  414.  Hence,  this  Court  finds  no"
"irregularity in the procedure adopted by the learned Magistrate in that regard."
