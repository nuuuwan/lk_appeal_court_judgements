"a.  The question whether corroboration of a testimony of a single witness is"
"or  is  not  necessary  must  depend  upon  the  facts  and  circumstances  of"

"corroboration, except in cases where the nature of the testimony of the"
"single witness itself requires, as a matter of prudence, that corroboration"
"should be insisted upon."
