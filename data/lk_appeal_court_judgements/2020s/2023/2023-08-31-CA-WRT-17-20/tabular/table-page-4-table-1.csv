"The Petitioner argues that he is entitled to the land as he is the eldest son of"
"the original Grantee Under section 72 of
the Land Development Ordinance"
"as amended by Section 68(2)(ii)
of
the Land Development Ordinance as"
"amended by Act, No 16 of 1969 and Act, No 27 of 1981."
"In this regard,
I refer to the observation made by the Supreme Court in the"
"case
of
Mallehe
Vidaneralalage
Don
Agosinno
Vs.
Divisional"
"Secretary-Thamankaduv 1 where His Lordship the Chief Justice S.N. Silva"
"enunciated that;"
"“it
is clear
from the provisions of
the law that
the change in the nature"
"of
the holding from that of a permit
to a Grant
is one purpose and it"
"should
not
be
taken
as
two
distinct
processes
for
the
purpose
of"
"annulling a nomination that has been previously made.”"
"In the case of Piyasena Vs. Wijesinghe 2 the Court of Appeal observed that;"
"“The
nomination
in
the
Permit
itself
shall
stand
valid
until
it
is"
"subsequently
cancelled
by
the
Permit Holder.
The
nomination of a"
"successor under
the Permit becomes converted to nomination made by"
"the permit holder as the owner of the land.”"
"Furthermore it was observed in this court in Paranavitharana Karunapala"
"Vs Minister of Lands and others3 that"
"“the nomination of a successor made by the Permit holder in his Permit"
"is valid until
the same is revoked. However,
if
the Permit holder has"
"made a fresh nomination in his Grant which has been given to him"
