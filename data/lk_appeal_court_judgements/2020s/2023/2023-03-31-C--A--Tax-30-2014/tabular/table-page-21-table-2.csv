"currently before the Court:12"
"It should be mentioned that two types of cases were stated by justices"
"at  common  law.  Justices  stated  one  type  of  case  during  the"
"course  of  a  hearing  before  them;  they  set  out  the  facts  that"
"raised a legal problem, and that statement was sent before the"
"Assize judges for solution. The judges’ opinion was returned to the"
"justices,  who  then  completed  their  hearing  and  adjudicated  in  the"
"light of that opinion."
"The other type of stated case was stated after the justices had"
"made their conviction or order. If a legal problem had arisen on"
"which  they  had  felt  difficulty,  they  could  state  the  facts  and  the"
"problem in the form of an appendix to their conviction or order, and it"
"was  then brought up as part of the record by a certiorari. Then  the"
"Queen’s  Bench  quashed  or  affirmed  the  adjudication  brought  up,"
"according as they agreed or disagreed with the justices’ legal rulings."
