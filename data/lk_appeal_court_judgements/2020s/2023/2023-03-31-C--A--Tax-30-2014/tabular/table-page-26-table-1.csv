"“Let me give an example. A case before the TAC raises the question of"
"whether the assessment is time barred in addition to substantive issues."
"The TAC decides to take up the time bar issue as a preliminary objection"
"as raised by the taxpayer. If the TAC overrules [This should be “upholds”]"
"the preliminary objection then we are told, by the second part quoted from"
"Koggala Garment case (supra), that the  taxpayer must resort to judicial"
"review  as  the  TAC  has  not  looked  at  the  substantive  issues.  Yet  if  the"
"taxpayer  [This  should  be  “Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue”]"
"succeeds in its challenge on time bar of assessment, then it is in relation"
"to a matter arising on the assessment and, we are told by the first part of"
"the quotation in Koggala Garment case (supra), the Commissioner General"
"of Inland Revenue can move for a Case Stated to be referred to this Court”."
