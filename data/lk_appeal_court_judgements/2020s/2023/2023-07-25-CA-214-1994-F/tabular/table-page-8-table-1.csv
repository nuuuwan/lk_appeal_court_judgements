"follows,"
"“Hence, a decision per incuriam is one given in ignorance or forgetfulness of the"
"law  by  way  of  statute  or  binding  precedent,  which,  had  it  been  considered,"
"would have led to a different decision. It must be reiterated that a decision will"
"not be regarded as per incuriam merely on the ground that another Court thinks"
"that it was wrongly decided; the fault must derive from ignorance of statutory"
"law or binding authority. Also, the authority must be a binding rule of law and"
"not merely an authority that is distinguishable”"
"The  definition  of  the  phrase  per  incuriam  in  Lord  Goddard’s  terms  has  been"
