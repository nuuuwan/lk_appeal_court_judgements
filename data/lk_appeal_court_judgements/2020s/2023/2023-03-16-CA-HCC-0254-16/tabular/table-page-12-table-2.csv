"It is clear from the evidence that other than of an information that the appellant"
"is in possession of a weapon, police have had no knowledge as to the exact place"
"where it would be, when PW-01 has recorded his statement. I am of the view that"
"fact  was  not  within  the  knowledge  of  the  police  when  the  discovery  of  the"
"weapons  and  the  ammunition  was  made  upon  relying  on  the  section  27"
"statement.  Therefore,  I  find  no  reasons  to  agree  with  the  contentions  that  the"
"section 27 recovery would not be applicable as evidence against the appellant."
"The question whether it can be determined that it was the appellant who had the"
"exclusive  possession  of  the  discovered  productions  are  concerned,  it  was  the"
"evidence  of  the  witnesses  that  the  relevant  productions  were  discovered  as"
"pointed out by the appellant from under a bed in a room of the house. Although"
"such a discovery could have been made even without a statement in that regard"
"by the accused, if the police team searched the house, in this instant, I find no"
"basis  to  doubt  that  the  discovery  was  made  as  a  result  of  the  section  27"
"statement.  The  items  of  productions  discovered  had  been  a  T-56  weapon,  60"
"rounds of ammunition and 2 magazines concealed in a polythene gunny bag kept"
"under a bed. I am of the view that evidence led in this action cannot attribute"
"the  possession  of  such  weapons  and  ammunition  to  the  females  of  the  house"
"and minor children under any circumstances."
