"Besides all that, when the relevant witnesses gave evidence in Court, the line of"
"cross-examination  by  the  learned  Counsel  who  represented  the  appellant  had"
"not  been  on  the  basis  of  a  denial  that  the  productions  were  not  found  in  the"
"possession of the appellant."
"The only position taken had been to imply that the gun found belongs to another"
"person called Bandu and nothing else."
"I am in no position to agree with the contention that there are serious infirmities"
"inter se and per se between evidence of PW-01, 02 as well as PW-05."
"I have already discussed that the evidence of both PW-1 and 02 relates to only"
"one male in the house when the raid was conducted. If one reads the evidence"
"of PW-01 and 02 as a whole, it becomes clear that the informant has gone near"
"the house of the appellant only for the purpose of showing the PW-01 the correct"
"house. It is clear from the evidence of PW-01, what he had been saying was that"
"the informant did not take part in the raid itself, but left after showing the house."
"What PW-02 says in that regard is also similar to the stand of PW-01."
"In his evidence, PW-01 has stated that after the arrest, there was no revelation"
"about another person, but later in his evidence, he has admitted that they went"
"looking for a third person. In fact, what PW-02 says is also the same thing. In"
"their evidence, PW-01 and 02 had clearly stated that the recovery of the gun and"
"the ammunitions was by PW-01 as pointed out by the appellant. Both of them"
"say that PW-01 went into the room and removed the mattress that was on the"
"bed and they were able to witness a yellow-coloured gunny bag on the floor under"
"the  bed,  through  the  gaps  in  the  wooden  poles  of  the  bed,  and  later  the"
"productions were recovered inside the bag. What Pw-05 says is also that PW-01"
"removed the mattress and recovered a gunny bag, although he doesnâ€™t say that"
"the gunny bag was on the floor under the bed."
