"implying that the things were recovered as the witnesses say, but they were not"

"the defence and the dock statement of the appellant, there exists no basis for the"
"4th ground of appeal either."
"The appeal of the appellant is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit."
"The conviction and the sentence affirmed."
