"I am of the view for contradictions and infirmities to be considered as material"
"in a criminal trial, such contradictions and infirmities must go into the core of"
"the matter. Such infirmities which are trivial in nature, that do not create any"
"doubt or doubts in the prosecution case cannot be considered to conclude that"
"the prosecution has failed to prove its case."
"For  the  reasons  stated  as  above,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  first  three  grounds  of"
"appeal urged."
"The  fourth  ground  of  appeal  is  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to"
"consider and evaluate the dock statement made by the appellant."
"I find no reason to subscribe to such an argument in this appeal. The learned"
"High Court Judge has clearly summarized what the appellant has stated in his"
"dock statement and has considered whether it has created a reasonable doubt"
"as to the prosecution case, or at least had provided a reasonable explanation as"
"to the evidence placed before the Court."
"The learned High Court Judge has been very much mindful that although a dock"
"statement is not evidence that can be valued similar to that of  evidence  given"
"under oath, and subjected to the test of cross-examination, such evidence also"
"has evidential value. It is clear from the judgement, that the learned High Court"
"Judge has considered the dock statement, the value that can be attached to such"
"a statement."
"In his dock statement, the appellant has stated that when he was arrested, the"
"police  officers  came  into  the  house  with  his  own  brother  who  had  a  previous"
"grudge against him and it was at his instigation that he was taken away from"
"the house. It had been his position that it was his brother who showed a gunny"
"bag near an abandoned house, and the police party went looking for a person"
"called Bandu as informed by his brother and since the mentioned Bandu could"
"not be located, he was produced in Court after six days."
