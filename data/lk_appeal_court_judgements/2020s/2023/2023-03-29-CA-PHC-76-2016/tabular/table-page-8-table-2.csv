"I  quote  Krishnamoorthy Sivakumar vs. Pathima Johara Packer  [CA (PHC) 122/18 C.A.M"
"27.09.2022] where De Silva, J. held:"
"“It is my view that the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 stipulates that “no"
"appeal shall lie against any Determination or Order under this Act” to prevent prolong"
"and protracted hearings and also to prevent frittering away precious time of courts and"
"parties. When examining the intention of the Legislature in including the 3-month time"
"frame for a matter to be concluded before the Primary Court Judge, the implication is"
"such  that  Legislature  intended  to  discourage  people  from  filing  cases  on  frivolous"
"grounds, devoid of merit."
"Thus, in an actual sense, the suitable step is to have the civil rights of the relevant parties"
"adjudicated  in  the  relevant  competent  civil  court.  Therefore,  when  filing  an  appeal"
"against  a  provisional  order  given  under  the  Primary  Courts’  Procedure  Act,  the  party"
"concerned must come to a degree of certainty that their claim has merit and is likely to"
"succeed and thereupon decide on the appropriate platform from which he can receive a"
"fair remedy.  It is incumbent upon the learned High Court Judges to direct parties to a"
"competent civil Court for final adjudication of their legal rights pertaining to the land in"
"question. This will enable us to witness an efficient administration of justice in our Court"
"system."
