"It is to be observed that the learned Magistrate, upon considering the evidence placed before"
"Court has stated in his order dated 02.02.2012 that Appellants have failed to reasonably explain"
"how they came to possession of the land in dispute.  The Appellants had taken up the position"
"that they gave the land in dispute to one Vijitha Damayanti Liverra Tennakoon to have possession"
"of the land and to use the land for various purposes of cultivation from 01.01.2007 onwards."
"However, the learned Magistrate had held that the said Vijitha Damayanti Liverra Tennakoon"
"failed  to  produce  evidence  to  substantiate  her  possession  of  the  land  in  dispute  that  bears"
"assessment No.43, Riverside Road.  It is relevant to note that documents marked and produced"
"as K and M with the original affidavits are in relation to a land that bears assessment No.51,"
"Riverside Road and is not related to the land in dispute."
"The learned Magistrate has analyzed and evaluated the evidence available to him and come to"
"the correct findings of fact and rightly held that Appellants and Party of the 1st Party-Respondents"
"have failed to establish they were or any of them were in possession of the land in dispute at the"
"time of which the information was filed or that they have been dispossessed from the land in"
"dispute within a period of two months immediately before the date on which the information"
"was filed."

"essentially  is  to  prevent  a  breach  of  peace  and  evidently  not  to  embark  on  a  protracted  trial"
"investigating the title. Thus, if the Appellant wishes to establish his legal rights to the disputed"
"portion of land, it is both fitting and proper to invoke the civil jurisdiction of a competent court"
"rather than preferring an appeal and/or an application to the Court of Appeal. It was further"
