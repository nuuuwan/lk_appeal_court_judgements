"SC  Appeal  No.  101/2012  decided  on  05.06.2023,  His  Lordship"
"Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J held that:"
"“Furthermore, a stated above, Section 63B (1) has conferred power"
"on 
the 
learned  Magistrate 
to 
forfeit 
to 
the  State  any  mineral,"
"machinery, equipment or material used in or in connection with the"
"the 
commission  of  an 
offence  under 
the  Act.  Moreover,  as"
"transportation of minerals without a valid license issued under the"
"Act 
is  an  offence  under 
the  said  Act, 
the  equipment  used 
to"
"transport minerals falls within the scope of section 63B (1). In this"
"regard,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  any  machinery,  equipment  or"
"material  used  not  only  directly  for  exploration  of  mining  but  also"
"anything 
that  would 
facilitate  mining  and 
transportation  are"
"subject to the scope of the said section."
"Thus, having considered the aforesaid dictionary meaning and the"
"context  where  the  word  “equipment”  is  used  in  the  Mines  and"
"Minerals Act, I am of the opinion that the word “equipment” used in"
"the Act should be taken to include a ‘vehicle’ (Lorry, tipper or even"
"a  bullock  cart)  used  to  transport  minerals  without  a  valid  license"
"issued under the said Act”."
