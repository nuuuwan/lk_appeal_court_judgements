"derived his rights from a previous owner. That is not material infirmity in the 3rd"
"Defendant’s  evidence  because  in  a  pedigree  there  can  always  be  a  still  older"
"previous owner."
"The learned District Judge had observed that the land referred to in the deed"
"marked 3V3 is a land in extent of one Amunam and two Pelas (paddy sowing"
"extent)  out  of  which  one  Pela  had  been  transferred  to  Sirimala.  The  learned"
"District Judge has also observed that the Plaintiff had instituted this partition"
"action to a land which defers to it in extent. In his extensive written submission"
"where he had not left a single stone unturned in the interest of his client, the"
"learned Presidents Counsel for the substituted Defendant-Appellant had drawn"
"our attention to the fact that there is a reference to an extent of three Pelas in"
"the deed marked 3V4. Therefore, it is the submission of the learned Presidents"
"Counsel that although only an extent of one Pela was transferred to Sirimala by"
"3V3,  Sirimala  had  acquired  rights  to  this  land  on  two  deeds  and  therefore"
"Sirimala owned three Pelas in the land. The extent referred to in 3V4 is an extent"
"of three Pelas. We agree with that submission. However, as the learned District"
"Judge has correctly observed there is a discrepancy in extent of the land referred"
"to in the deeds produced by the 3rd Defendant and the land referred to in the"
"deeds produced by the plaintiff. The deeds marked 3V4, 3V5 and 3V6 produced"
"by the 3rd Defendant refer to a land in extent of three Pelas. The land referred"
"to in the deeds produced by the Plaintiff is a land in extent of one Yelamuna"
"which  is  equal  to  an  extent  of  six  Pelas.  Therefore,  one  cannot  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the deeds produced by the 3rd Defendant refer to the corpus in"
"this case which is very much larger (double the extent) than the land referred to"
"in  the  deeds  produced  by  the  3rd  Defendant.  There  are  discrepancies  in  the"
"boundaries also. The boundaries referred to in the deeds produced by the 3rd"
"Defendant do not tally with the boundaries in the land surveyed in this case. In"
"the deeds produced by the 3rd Defendant the Northern, Eastern and Western"
"boundaries  are  referred  to  as  “Ella”  but  in  the  land  surveyed  the  Northern,"
"Eastern and Western boundaries are referred to as “Banage Watta, Palpalekura"
"and Wesbadeniye Watta”. In the 3rd Defendant’s deeds, the Southern boundary"
"is referred to as a portion of the same land. But according to the preliminary"
"plan  a  portion  of  the  same  land  does  not  border  the  corpus  to  the  South."
"According to the preliminary plan the Southern Boundary is “Batugedarawatta”."
"None of the boundaries referred to in the 3rd Defendant’s deeds tally with the"
"existing boundaries of the corpus as shown in the preliminary plan. Therefore,"
"one  cannot  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  land  referred  to  in  the  deeds"
