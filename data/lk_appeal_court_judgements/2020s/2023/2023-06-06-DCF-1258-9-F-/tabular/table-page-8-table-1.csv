"Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the name referred to in 1V1 and the"
"two deeds. The word ‘Elamaldeniye’ is missing in 1V1 and the word ‘Gedara’ is"
"not there in පැ9. In 1V1 the name of Sodina’s father is referred to as Dingira. It"
"was the case of the 1st and 2nd Defendants that Dingira is the brother of Surendra"
"Yakdessa and both were living together with a common wife in the same house"
"which was a custom that existed in the Kandyan provinces which was known as"
"“එක‌ගෙයි කෑම” and the name of Dingira was entered in 1V1. The learned District"
"Judge has come to the correct finding that there was no sufficient evidence to"
"come to that conclusion. It was the case of the 1st and 2nd Defendants that the"
"contents  of  the  two deeds  marked  පැ8  and  පැ9  indicate  that Sodina  was not"
"living in her native village and she was living elsewhere which shows that Sodina"
"had entered into a deega marriage and left the village. The learned District Judge"
"has come to the conclusion that he cannot rely on that theory. Therefore, he has"
"come to the finding that the fact that Sodina had entered into a deega marriage"
"had not been established and the 1st and 2nd Defendants are not disputing that"
"finding. There is no reason for us to interfere with that finding. Therefore, the"
"balance rights of Punchina and Surendra Yakdessa should devolve on 1st and 2nd"
"Defendants and Sodina. Therefore, the rights acquired by Sodina on පැ8 and the"
"rights  she  had  inherited  should  devolve  on  Hendirik  on  පැ9  and  those  rights"
"should go to the Plaintiff. For the aforesaid reasons, on a balance of probability"
"of evidence one can come to the conclusion  that the Plaintiff had proved his"
"pedigree and the 3rd defendant had failed to prove his pedigree. The learned"
"District Judge has come to a correct conclusion regarding the devolution of title"
"and we see no reason to interfere with that finding."
"The learned Presidents’ Counsel for the Substituted – 3rd Defendant Appellant"
"has submitted that the 3rd Defendant had acquired a prescriptive right to the"
"land. But the prescriptive claim of the Substituted 3rd Defendant Appellant must"
"fail for the following reasons;"
"The  3rd  Defendant  in  his  amended  statement  of  claim  had  not  asked  for  a"
"prescriptive  right  either  to  the  entire  corpus  or  to  a  specific  portion  of  it."
"However, issue no. 23 had been raised on behalf of the 3rd Defendant at the trial,"
"without  any  objection,  that  the  3rd  Defendant  had  prescribed  to  the  entire"
"corpus."
"Issue No. 23 reads as follows;"
"23.  3  වන  විත්තිකරු  සහ  ඔහුගේ  පූර්වොමීන්  එම  ඉඩම  දීර්ඝකාලීන  භුක්තිය  මත"
"භුක්තියට සවිවීගේ අයිිවාසිකේ ලබා සිටීද?"
