"share  to  his  children  Suramba,  Ganitha  and  Sewranga  the  2nd  Defendant."
"Surendra Yakdessa had transferred another 1/15th share to the 1st Defendant by"
"the deed marked 1V2. Still there is a balance 13/30 share owned by Surendra"
"Yakdessa. There was a dispute regarding the devolution of Suramba’s rights and"
"Ganitha’s  rights.  Both  of  them  had  died  unmarried  before  their  parents.  As"
"shown  in  the  Plaintiff’s  pedigree  their  rights  had  devolved  on  their  mother"
"Punchina and the 1st and the 2nd Defendants had disputed that fact. Their case"
"was that those rights devolved on their father Surendra Yakdessa and after his"
"death those rights devolved on his two surviving children, the 1st and the 2nd"
"Defendants.  There  is  no  dispute  that  this  devolution  was  governed  by  the"
"Kandyan  law.  The  learned  District  Judge  has  come  to  the  finding  that  both"
"Suramba  and  Ganitha  had  died  before  the  Kandyan 
law  Declaration  and"
"Amendment Ordinance No. 39 of 1938 came into operation and the 1st and 2nd"
"Defendants had not appealed against that finding. The law that existed prior to"
"this Ordinance came in to operation had been discussed in the case of Kalu Vs"
"Kiriya reported in 18 NLR 465 and accordingly the mother inherits the rights of"
"the deceased unmarried children. In that case it was held that a Kandyan mother"
"inherits her children’s acquired properties in preference to the father. This rule"
"is not restricted only to cases where the mother was married in binna; nor only"
"to cases where the property has been acquired from a source other than the"
"father.  Therefore,  Suramba’s  and  Ganitha’s  rights  should  devolve  on  their"
"mother  Punchina.  Surendra  Yakdessa  and  Punchina  had  transferred  a  1/15th"
"share to the 1st Defendant on 1V2. Thereafter, Punchina had transferred a 1/15th"
"share to Sodina on පැ8. Sodina had transferred those rights to Hendrick on පැ9"
"and Hendrick had transferred same to the Plaintiff on පැ10. The learned District"
"Judge has come to the conclusion that the balance rights owned by Surendra"
"Yakdessa and his wife Punchina should devolve on their three children, the 1st"
"and  2nd  Defendants  and  Sodina.  At  the  trial  the  1st  and  2nd  Defendants  had"
"disputed the fact that Sodina inherited the rights from her parents. It was the"
"case  of  the  1st  and  2nd  Defendants  that  since  Sodina  entered  into  a  deega"
"marriage, she did not inherit any rights from her parents. To substantiate this"
"position,  the  1st  and  2nd  Defendants  had  produced 
in  evidence  a  marriage"
"certificate  marked  1V1  which  is  purported  to  be  the  marriage  certificate  of"
"Sodina. That marriage certificate refers to a deega marriage. According to that"
"document the name of the female party is Karunadhipathiyale Gedara Sodina."
"The  learned  District  Judge  has  correctly  observed  that  in  deeds  පැ8  and  පැ9"
"Sodina’s  name 
is  described  as  Elamaldeniye  Karunadhipathiyalage  Sodina."
