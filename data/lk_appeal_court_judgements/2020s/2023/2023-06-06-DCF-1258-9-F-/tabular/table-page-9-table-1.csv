"The evidence reveals that although the 3rd Defendant had cultivated a portion"
"of  the  paddy  field  which 
is 
inside  the  corpus,  he  did  not  have  exclusive"
"possession to the corpus. The 5th Defendant and 1st and 2nd Defendants had also"
"cultivated portions of the paddy field. Therefore, the 3rd Defendant did not have"
"exclusive possession to the entire corpus. Therefore, the 3rd Defendant did not"
"have undisturbed possession which  is  a necessary  requirement  to  establish  a"
"prescriptive right. In the case of Siman Appu Vs. Christian Appu (1895) 1 NLR"
"288 Withers J. had described the concept of undisturbed possession as follows;"
"“Possession is disturbed either by an action intended to remove the possessor"
"from the land or by acts which prevent the possessor from enjoying the free and"
"full use of the land of which he is in the course of acquiring the dominion, and"
"which convert his continuous into a disconnected and divided user.”"
"In the same case Lawrie ACJ had observed as follows;"
"“A disturbance is something less than an interruption; it is a disturbance if, for a"
"time, someone succeeds in getting partial possession, not to the entire exclusion"
"of the former possessor, but jointly with him.”"
"The  3rd  Defendant  had  possessed  the  corpus 
jointly  with  1st,  2nd  and  5th"
"Defendants  and 
therefore,  he  did  not  have  undisturbed  and  exclusive"
"possession  to  the  entire  possession.  Therefore,  his  prescriptive  claim  must"
"necessarily fail. The 3rd Defendant is not asking for a prescriptive right for the"
"portion of the paddy field in which he is in possession. As the learned District"
"Judge had correctly observed the 3rd Defendant had not asked for a prescriptive"
"right to a specific portion of the corpus. To ask for a prescriptive right to the"
"portion  of  the  paddy  field  which  is  possessed  by  the  3rd  Defendant,  he  must"
"show that portion in the plan. But the 3rd Defendant had not shown that portion"
"in a plan and superimposed that plan on the preliminary plan. In any event he"
"cannot establish a prescriptive possession to that portion of land. 3A Defendant"
"in his evidence had stated as follows;"
"“කට වචනයකින් ගවන් කර භුක්ති විදින්ගන්”"
"That shows that the parties had possessed different portions of the corpus with"
"the  consent  of  each  other.  Therefore,  the  3rd  Defendant  could  not  have  had"
"adverse possession to the portion in which he was in possession. Therefore, his"
"prescriptive claim must necessarily fail."
