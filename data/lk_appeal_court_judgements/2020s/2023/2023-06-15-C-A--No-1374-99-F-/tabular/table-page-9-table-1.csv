"the  case  of  a  will  thirty  years  old.  The  corresponding  section  of  the  Indian"
"Evidence Act  appears  to have been construed in  the same  way  in  the  Indian"
"Courts. Mukkerji v. Pal Sritiratna, I.L.R. 5, Cal. 886. It has, however, been held"
"in  India, and  I think rightly, that the presumption should generally be drawn"
"with  caution,  and  there  should  be  at  least  some  evidence  of  transactions  or"
"states of affairs necessarily or at least naturally referable to it so as to free it"
"from the suspicion of being fabricated. (See Prasad Bai v. Chandra Bai, 6 W."
"R. 82; Dishit Moro v. Lahshman, I. L. R. II., Bom. 89.) In this case evidence of"
"execution is not absolutely wanting, for the widow of the deceased swears to"
"his  having  signed  it.  Further,  transactions  of  the  kind  referred  to  are  also"
"shown to have taken place, as it appears that the widow and the children who"
"were beneficiaries under the will sold some of the property of the estate, and"
"the  vendees  have  been  in  undisturbed  possession  for  a  great  many  years"
"without opposition from the respondents to this appeal, who are the children of"
"the  widow  by  a  marriage  contracted  subsequently  to  the  death  of  the  first"
"husband, the deceased testator. I therefore think that the requirements in the"
"proof of a will of an ancient date have been sufficiently fulfilled, including the"
"necessity for the document to come from proper custody.‚Äù"
