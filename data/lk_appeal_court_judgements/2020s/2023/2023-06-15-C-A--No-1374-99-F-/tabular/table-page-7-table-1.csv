ertram  CJ  in  ‘the  Alim’s  Will’  case  20NLR  481  stated  as  follows  at  pages"

"“Before proceeding to an analysis of the evidence, I would state briefly what I"
"understand to be the law upon the subject. It has been established by a long"
"series of decisions, the most important of which are Barry v. Butlin,1 Baker v."
"Butt,"" Fulton v. Andrew, Tyrrell vs  Painton1 (see also Orion v. Smith, Dufour v."
"Croft, Wilson vs Basil, Sukhir v. Kadar Nath) that wherever a will is prepared"
"and executed under circumstances which arouse the suspicion of the Court, it"
"ought not to pronounce in favour of it unless the party propounding it adduces"
"evidence which would remove such suspicion, and satisfies the Court that the"
"testator knew and approved of the contents of the instrument. It is now settled"
"that this principle is not limited to cases in which the will is propounded by a"
"person who takes a special benefit under it and himself procured or conducted"
"its execution. It may very well be that a refusal to grant probate in such a case"
"may involve an imputation of fraud upon the party propounding the will. This"

"fraud. What it has to ask itself is whether, in all the circumstances of the case,"
"it will give credit to the subscribing witnesses or the other witnesses adduced"
"to  prove  the  execution.  Nor  is  it  an  objection  to  the  operation  of  this  principle"
"that the evidence which casts suspicion on the will, though it suggests fraud,"
"is not of such a nature as to justify the Court in a finding of fraud. (See Tyrrell"
"v  Painton)  The  principle  does  not  mean  that 
in  cases  where  a  suspicion"
"attaches to a will, a special measure of proof or a particular species of proof is"
"required. (See Barry v. Butlin (supra).)  It means that in such cases, the Court"
"must  be  ""  vigilant  and  jealous  in  examining  the  evidence  in  support  of  the"
"instrument, in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is"
"removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded' does express"
"the  true  will of  the deceased."" There  are  two forcible expressions used in  the"
