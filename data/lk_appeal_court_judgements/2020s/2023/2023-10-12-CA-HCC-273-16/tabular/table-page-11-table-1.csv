"with or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act or not."
"In the said decision, reliance was placed on the principle laid down in Prakash Chand v. State (Delhi"
"Admin (6). It is worth noting that in the said case, there was material on record that the accused had"
"taken the Investigating Officer to the spot and pointed out the place where the dead body was buried"
"and this Court treated the same as admissible piece of evidence under Section 8 as the conduct of the"
"accused."
"He further held that;"
"In State of Maharashtra v. Damu S/o Gopinath Shinde and others (7), it has been held as follows: -"
"“It is now well settled that recovery of an object is not discovery of a fact as envisaged in the"
"section.  The  decision  of  the  Privy  Council  in Pulukuri  Kottaya  v.  Emperor  (8)  is  the  most  quoted"
"authority for supporting the interpretation that the “fact discovered” envisaged in the section embraces"
"the place from which the object was produced, the knowledge of the accused as to it, but the information"
"given must relate distinctly to that effect.”"
"Same principle has been laid down in State of Maharashtra v. Suresh (9), State of Punjab v."
"Gurnam Kaur and others (10), Aftab Ahmad Anasari v. State of Uttaranchal (11),  Bhagwan Dass v."
"State (NCT) of Delhi (12), Manu Sharma v. State (13)and Rumi Bora Dutta v. State of Assam (14)."
"In the case at hand, the factum of information related to the discovery of the dead body and other"
"articles and the said information was within the special knowledge of the present appellant. Hence, the"
"doctrine  of  confirmation  by  subsequent  events  is  attracted  and,  therefore,  we  have  no  hesitation  in"
"holding that recovery or discovery in the case at hand is a relevant fact or material which can be relied"
"upon and has been correctly relied upon”"
"We  hold  that  since  the  Accused  did  not  contradict  the  evidence  of  the  witness"
"regarding the recovery of the knife with the blood stain, it falls within the definition of"
"the word 'proof' in Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance. Such evidence could be treated as"
"an adverse inference drawn against the Accused."
