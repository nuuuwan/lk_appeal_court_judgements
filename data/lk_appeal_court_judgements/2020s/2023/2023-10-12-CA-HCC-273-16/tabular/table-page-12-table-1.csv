"to his body. PW9 then collected blood samples, took photographs of them, and compiled a"
"report."
"Upon perusal of the aforementioned evidence provided by these witnesses, we will"
"now examine the corroborative evidence among them."
"The  evidence  presented  by  the  principal  eyewitness  deduces  the  entirety  of"
"witnessing the Deceased being attacked by the Accused as the Deceased was dismounting"
"his bike, receiving a blow from a 'Manna' on his right side. This witness's testimony was"
"corroborated by other prosecution witnesses who made observations at the crime scene"
"and analyzed the items recovered from both the crime scene and during the arrest of the"
"Accused."
"On reviewing the evidence presented before us, no contradictions or discrepancies"
"were highlighted by the defense, leaving no room for them to challenge or question the"
"evidence  given  by  PW12,  apart  from  the  contention  of  the  belated  statement.  The"
"consistent support and corroboration from the testimonies of other prosecution witnesses"
"significantly influenced the Learned High Court Judge to correctly evaluate and accept"
"this  evidence  as  essential  to  this  case.  In  my  view,  the  prosecution  witnesses  have"
"remained  consistent  and  truthful  in  their  testimonies;  thus,  I  deem  this  evidence  as"
"paramount to the case"
"T
he Accused’s version"
"Now, let's consider the Accused’s dock statement:"
"The  Accused  delivered  a  dock  statement  during  which  he  denied  the  murder"
"allegation against him, refuted any connection to it, stated that there was no animosity"
"between him and the Deceased, and pleaded not guilty."
"Upon  examination  of  the dock  statement  provided  by the  Accused,  it  becomes patently"
"and manifestly clear that he has failed to create doubt regarding his connection to this"
"murder.  He  neither  offered  an  alibi  nor  presented  a  plausible  argument  related  to  the"
"incident, only providing a mere flat denial."
"I would like to refer to the sentiments referred by Justice F.N.D Jayasuriya along"
"with  Justice  P.H.K  Kulathilaka  J in  the  case Thalpe  Liyanage Manatunga  v.  Attorney"
"General, CA No.47/98, decided on 25.08.1999, held that;"
