"means and includes -"
"(
a) anything, state of things, or relation of things capable of being perceived by the senses;"
"(
b) any mental condition of which any person is conscious""."
"It is seen that a fact is not merely an object or article. It is something that can be"
"perceived by the senses or a mental state of which one is conscious."
"Coomaraswamy  in  his  Law  of  Evidence  Vol.  I,  page  446,  has  made  particular"
"reference to the distinction that should be drawn between a fact that is discovered and an"
"object that may found. He has stated:"
"""thus, the fact referred to in this section, may be any fact as defined in section 3 of"
"the Ordinance as opposed to ""fact"". The object discovered may be the body of the injured"
"person, the property stolen, bloody clothes, the weapon with which injury was inflicted or"
"some other material evidence of the offence""."
"This distinction between the discovery of a fact and the finding of some object is"
"clearly brought out by the Privy Council in the decision in the case of Pulukuri Kottaya v."
"Emperor where it was observed as follows :"
"""It is fallacious to treat the ""fact discovered"" within the section as equivalent to the"
"object produced. The fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced"
"and  the  knowledge  of  the  accused  as  to  this,  and  the  information  given  must  relate"
"distinctly to this fact. Information as to past user, or the past history of the object produced"
"is not related to its discovery in the setting in which it is discovered. Information supplied"
"by a person in custody that: 'I will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house' does"
"not lead to the discovery of a knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to the"
"discovery  of  the  fact  that  a  knife  is  concealed  in  the  house  of  the  informant  to  his"
"knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence,"
"the fact discovered is very relevant. But, if to the statement, the words be added, ""with"
"which I stabbed A"", these words are inadmissible since they do not relate to discovery of"
"the knife in the house of the informant""."
