"the registered owner of the vehicle has given clear evidence in that regard and"
"has explained as to the reasons why he allowed the accused to drive his vehicle."
"I am of the view that the facts of a matter need to be considered in its totality"
"and not in the isolation of one fact alone."
"The accused has come to the establishment of the registered owner in order to"
"get  the  cement  blocks  he  purchased  from  him  transported  to  his  house.  The"
"registered  owner  has  explained  the  necessity  the  accused  had,  and  since  the"

"distance  that  the  cement  blocks  were  due  to  be  transported  was  about  3"
"kilometers, the owner of the vehicle has waited over three hours to inquire into"
"the whereabouts of his vehicle. In his evidence, the registered owner had stated"
"the distance from his house to the accused’s house was about 3 kilometers and"
