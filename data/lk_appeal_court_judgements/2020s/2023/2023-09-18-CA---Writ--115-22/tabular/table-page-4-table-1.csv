"It is observed in Manel Fernando and Another v. D.M. Jayaratne, Minister of Agriculture"
"and Lands and Others [2000]1 Sri LR112 that, “The Minister cannot order the issue of a"
"section 2 notice unless he has a public purpose in mind. …the purpose of section 2 is to"
"ascertain whether land in any area, and if so which land, is suitable for a public purpose.”"
"The law only requires that the public purpose be stated in the Section 2 notice and that"
"identification of an area can be challenged if the public purpose is not specified in the said"
"notice. It cannot be an undisclosed one. The scheme of the Act requires  a disclosure of"
"public  purpose,  and  its  objects  cannot  be  fully  achieved  without  such  disclosure.  [This"
"position was upheld by the Supreme Court in Manel Fernando v. Jayarathna (supra)]. In"
"the instant case concern, the particular public purpose for which the land is required has"
"been  identified  in  the  Section  2  notice  marked  P10  as  relocation  of  the  weekly  fair  of"
"Melsiripura. Even the Petitioners do not challenge the necessity of the relocation of the"
"said weekly fair (public purpose) which occurred due to the acquisition of the old weekly"
"fair  premises  for  the  construction  of  the  Kurunegala-Habarana  railway  project.  The"
"Petitioners challenge only the process of acquisition and the suitability of their land for the"
"above-mentioned public purpose."
"After the notice under Section 2(2) of the Act is exhibited acquiring officer may enter any"
"land in that area to ascertain whether that land is suitable for the public purpose for which"
"land in that area is required. [Section 2(3) of the Act]. The notice only indicates an area"
"which is first identified by the Minister for public purpose. This means that the Minister"
"first identifies the larger area for public purpose, but a specific land is not pinpointed at"
"this stage. The purpose of issuing Section 2 notice is purely to gain entry to the land and"
"take initial steps to ascertain its suitability  for the public purpose for which land in that"
"area is required."
"As per Section 2 of the Act, there is no legal requirement to serve notice personally on all"
"persons whose lands are going to be acquired. All that is required to be done is for notice"
"under Section 2 to be exhibited in a conspicuous area.  This is because at the time that"
"Section 2 notice is exhibited, there is no definite determination of the specific land which"
"will be eventually acquired. In the circumstances, the rights of the Petitioner to his land are"
"not  affected  by  such  notice  except  by  the  authorized  officer  entering  into  the  land  to"
"consider its suitability for acquisition."
"The stance was upheld by this Court in the P.B.D. Dayaratna v. Hon Dr Rajitha Senaratne,"
"Court of Appeal Application No. 1790/2003, decided on 16.12.2004. it was observed,"
