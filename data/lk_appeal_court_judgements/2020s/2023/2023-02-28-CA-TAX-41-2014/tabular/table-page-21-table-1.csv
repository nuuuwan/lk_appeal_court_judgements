"centum of this is Rs. 8,766,847.50. This is what the appellant deposited at the"
"time  of  preferring  its  appeal  to  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission.  It  is  after  the"
"appellant indicating its intention to appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission that"
"the Deputy Commissioner sends her reasons for the determination. It was on"
"25th November 2013 that the appellant indicated to the Secretary to the Tax"
"Appeals  Commission,  its  intention  to  appeal.  The  respondent  has  stated  at"
"page 19, paragraph 77 of its written submissions dated 08th December 2022,"
"that, “the reasons are sent once a tax payer communicates to the TAC that he is aggrieved by the"
"decision of the CGIR and upon the TAC requesting the CGIR to send reasons”."
"The  reasons  sent  are  dated  02nd  January  2014,  nearly  2  months  after  the"
"determination. It was in the reasons that the Deputy Commissioner has stated,"
"that, “…Accordingly 25% of the tax payable is Rs. 18,062,425/-."
"This is not to question the procedure of Deputy Commissioner acting on behalf"
"of the Commissioner sending reasons for determination only if the tax payer"
"expresses  its  intention  to  appeal.  It  is  true  that  the  appeal  has  to  be  made"
"within  30  days  after  receiving  the  reasons  for  the  determination.  But  a"
"determination being provided without reasons and reasons coming only at the"
"time of preferring an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission is more the reason"
"that the Secretary to the  Tax Appeals Commission grants an opportunity to"
"rectify any error [although the error, in this case, was not on the part of the appellant] without"
"rejecting  the  appeal  the  appellant  not  being  heard.  This  is  why  it  was  said,"
"“With great power comes great responsibility”."
"A Court does not have the power to give reasons, only if the litigant aggrieved"
"appeals.  But  the  statutory  creature  of  the  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue"
"may do so."
