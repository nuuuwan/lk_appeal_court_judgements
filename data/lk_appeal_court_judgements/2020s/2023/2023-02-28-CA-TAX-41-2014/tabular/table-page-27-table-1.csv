"correct decision if the deciding authority is not impartial. Hence, arises the rule"
"nemo judex in causa re sua, no one be the judge of his own cause."
"Thus, the ‘judicial process’ requires the allowing of the free inflow of all facts"
"and circumstances the presence of which is necessary to arrive at the right"
"decision and an unfettered ability to discern good from evil or the ability"
"to take independent and unbiased decisions. It was also said that the ability"
"to discern good from evil is not what anybody and everybody think good"
"and evil, because it is so connected with the rationality of human mind for"
"it is that which arises by cause following effect, reason."
"In  refusing  to  list  the  appeal  of  the  appellant  on  10th  February  2014  and  in"
"persistently refusing to re list the same, neither the Secretary to the Tax Appeals"
"Commission, nor the Tax Appeals Commission, if in fact it directed the Secretary"
"as claimed, have acted as above."
"Furthermore,  the  Secretary  to  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  and  or  as  the"
"Secretary has claimed, the Tax Appeals Commission, has sought only the views"
"of the Commissioner General, with regard to re listing and apart from receiving"
"the letter of the appellant dated 29th May 2014 and a reminder dated 22nd July"
"2014, has not considered the views of the appellant, which is also a violation of"
"the basic procedural rights of the appellant."
"In  the  circumstances,  the  Questions  of  Law  are  answered  in  favour  of  the"
"appellant. This Court is of the opinion that the appellant has complied with the"
"requirement in section 7(1) proviso (b) of Tax Appeals Commission Act in respect"
"of providing a bank guarantee for 25% of the tax assessed by the Commissioner"
"General."
"Hence,  this  Court  holds  that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  to  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  dated  10th  February  2014  is  bad  in  law,  a  nullity  and  without"
"jurisdiction and hence set aside."
