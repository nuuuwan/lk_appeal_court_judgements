"a general duty to give reasons is a serious gap in the law.""2 This report"
"reiterated  the  posi-  tion  of  an  earlier  committee  stating  that  ""no  single"
"factor  has  inhibited  the  development  of  English  administrative  law  as"
"seriously as the absence of any general obligation upon public authorities"
"to give reasons for their deci- sions.""3 Similar sentiments have also been"
"expressed in Australia4 and in Canada.’"
