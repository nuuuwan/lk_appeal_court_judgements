"On  the  other  hand,  since  the  Petition  of  Appeal  is  filed  without  the  written  sanction  of  the"
"Commissioner of Labour, the Petition of Appeal is bad in law."
"Therefore, in view of the aforesaid reasons, we uphold the preliminary objection raised on behalf"
"of the 1st and 2nd Respondent – Petitioner – Respondents. Thus, we dismiss the Petition of Appeal"
"without costs."
"Moreover, in the circumstances it is the duty of the Court to consider whether it is plausible to"
"convert the instant Petition of Appeal to a Revision application."
"It seems that the said application is made to convert this Appeal to a Revision application merely to"
"overcome the statutory bars to filing this Appeal."
"In view of the aforesaid authorities, it clearly indicates that by allowing to convert an Appeal filed"
"out of time to a Revision application, the relevant Rules with regard to the filing of Appeals will be"
"rendered nugatory."
"Since the Appellant had not filed Written Submissions, the Appellant has failed to substantiate her"
"contention and has also failed to establish any exceptional circumstances to convert an Appeal to"
"a Revision application in the interest of justice."
"Hence, application to convert the Appeal to a Revision application is also dismissed."
"Thus,  we  uphold  the  Preliminary  Objection  raised  on  behalf  of  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondent  –"
"Petitioner – Respondents and dismiss the Petition of Appeal in limine."
