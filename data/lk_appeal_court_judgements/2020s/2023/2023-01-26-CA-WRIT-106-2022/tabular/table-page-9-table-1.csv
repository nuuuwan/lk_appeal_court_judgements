"The Section 7 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance  deals with the capital of the  Bank and"
"Section 651 provides that the provisions of the Part II of the Finance Act No. 38 of 1971"
"shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to the financial control and accounts of the Bank of Ceylon."
"In light of the above, it is necessary for this Court to draw attention to the component of"
"the shareholding of the State and also the financial obligations of the Bank under statutory"
"provisions for the purpose of fuller and proper adjudication of the instant Application."
"Thus, I take the view that the facts revolving around the said objections should be clearly"
"made  available  to  this  Court  by  way  of  complete  sets  of  affidavits  and  not  by  limited"
"Statement of Objections in order to examine the Respondentsâ€™ said objections."
"On  an  overall  conspectus  of  the  submissions  made  by  all  parties  and  based  on  the"
"complexity of issues that require the resolution of this Court at a merits stage, I take the"
"view  that  this  Court  should  fully  consider  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case  on"
"affidavits at a final hearing. Further, this Court takes the view that the preliminary issues"
"of rejection have to be looked into only at the merit stage in view of the circumstances of"
"this  case.  In  that  event,  the  Court  will  be  able to  consider  whether  there  would  be  any"
"merits  on  the  objections  raised  by  the  Respondents,  after  considering  all  the  facts  and"
"circumstances together with the complete submissions of the learned Counsel."
"Hence, we decide to issue formal notice of this Application on the Respondents."
