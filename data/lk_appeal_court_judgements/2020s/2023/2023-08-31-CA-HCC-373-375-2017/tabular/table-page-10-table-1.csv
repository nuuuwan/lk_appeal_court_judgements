"This dictum was followed in the case of Piyathilaka and 2 Others v. Republic of Sri Lanka"
"[1996] 2 S.L.R, His Lordship DR. GUNAWARDENA, J."
"There is no iota of evidence placed before the trial against the 2nd and 3rd accused"
"with regard  to  whether  they  have  actively participated in the  assault  on  the  deceased."
"That is to say, whether they had shared the murderous intention with the 1st Accused."
"Hence  in  view  of  the  facts  stated  above  we  are  of  the  view  that  there  was  no"
"unlawful  assembly formed  during  the  incident  and we see  that  the  2nd  and  3rd  accused"
"appellants should be acquitted from all charges found guilty by the trial judge. Hence the"
"appeal of the 2nd and 3rd accused appellants are hereby allowed."
"The next question is with regard to the culpability of the 1st accused."
"From  the  evidence  stated  above  we  find  that  1st  accused  caused  injuries  to  the"
"deceased.  Then  the  question  is  whether  that  injury  had  caused  death  to  the  deceased."
"According  to  the  doctor,  there  were  several  injuries  found  on  the  deceasedâ€™s  body,  and"
"further,  he  stated  that  there  was  more  than  one  weapon  that  was  used  to  inflict  such"
"bodily injury."
"In  light  of  the  above,  we  set  aside  the  conviction  and  sentence  imposed  by  the"
"Learned Trial Judge against the 1st Accused. We find him guilty of voluntarily causing"
"grievous hurt by dangerous weapons under section 317 of the Penal Code.  We therefore"
"impose a sentence of 7 years of rigorous imprisonment, from the date of the conviction by"
"the Learned Trial Judge."
"As  such  the  appeal  of  the  1st  Accused  appellant  dismissed  subject  to  the  above"
"variation."
