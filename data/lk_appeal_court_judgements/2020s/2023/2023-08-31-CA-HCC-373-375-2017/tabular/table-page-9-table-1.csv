"and caution has to be exercised in deciding which of the persons present can be safely"
"described as members of the unlawful assembly. Although as a matter of law an overt act"
"i

 not a  necessary factor bearing upon membership of an unlawful assembly, yet, it is"
"safer to look for some evidence of participation by each person alleged to be a member"
"before holding that such person is a member of the unlawful assembly, lest innocent"
"persons be punished for no fault of their's. The common object of an assembly is an"

erence from facts to be deduced from the facts and circumstances of each case. The"
"common object can be collected from the nature of the assembly, the arms used by them,"
"the behaviour of the assembly at or before the scene of occurrence, and subsequent"
"conduct. The common object must be readily deducible from the direct as well as"
"c
i
rcumstantial evidence, including the conduct of the parties. It is not sufficient for such"
"evidence to be consistent with such an inference, but must be the only conclusion"
