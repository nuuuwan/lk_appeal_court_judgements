"According  to  the  findings  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the  Order  in  the"
"Magistrateâ€™s  Court  case  No.  43359  was  delivered  on  23.05.2013  and  the  revision"
"application was made on 05.08.2014. The delay was for a period more than one year"
"and the Petitioner-Appellant had not given any explanation for the delay."
"Moreover, the Petitioner-Appellant had not shown exceptional circumstances that"
"shock the conscience of Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial"
"High Court of the Central Province. Therefore, it is apparent that the learned High"
"Court Judge has very correctly held against the Petitioner-Appellant and dismissed"
"the application of the Petitioner-Appellant."
"Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the Order of the learned High Court Judge"
"dated 18.11.2015 and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 23.05.2013."
"The appeal is dismissed with tax cost."
