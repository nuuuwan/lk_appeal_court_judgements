"Further,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  very  correctly  considered  the"
"evidence given by PW1, PW2 PW3 and other witnesses and had reached the"
"conclusion that the Appellant had committed the murder of the deceased on"
"21.03.2001 at the premises of the Court Complex of Polonnaruwa.  Hence,"
"the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant have no merit at all."
"As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the"
"charge  levelled  against  him  in  the  indictment,  I  affirm  the  conviction  and"
"dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Polonnaruwa along with the original case record."
