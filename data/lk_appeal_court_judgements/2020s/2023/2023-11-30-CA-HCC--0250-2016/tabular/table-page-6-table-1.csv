"This case rests on direct and circumstantial evidence."
"As  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Appellant  are  interconnected,  all"
"grounds will be considered together in this appeal."
"The right to a fair trial guarantees fair court proceedings. A fair trial means"
"that the court follows all procedures correctly and treats all parties equally,"
"so  that  the  trial  itself  is  fair  and  effective,  regardless  of  the  decision  and"
"outcome. The  right  to  a  fair  trial  encompasses  requirements  for  the  court"
"and its constitution as well as procedural guarantees during proceedings."
