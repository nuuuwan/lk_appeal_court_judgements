"In  Herath  Mudiyanselage  Ariyaratne  V.  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.  (CA"
"307/2006 [17.7.2013]) where His Lordship Justice Sisira De Abrew said:"
"' ... I now again turn to the contention that succeeding HCJ in a criminal"
"trial cannot, under Section 48 of the Judicature Act, continue with the"
"proceedings recorded before his predecessor. When a HCJ is transferred"
"from  his  station  he  ceases  to  exercise  his  jurisdiction  in  his  area  and"
"thereby he suffers from disability to function as HCJ of the area. Thus,"
"in my view,  transfer of a HCJ from a station  is covered by  the  words"
"'other disability ' in Section 48 of the Judicature Act. '"
"Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  who  wrote  the"
"judgment  had  the  discretion  and  the  authority  to  continue  with  the  case."
"Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the Appellant has not been afforded a"
"fair trial in this case."
"Any contradiction if proven in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence"
"Ordinance,  can  impeach  the  credibility  of  the  witness  and  can  help  in"
"rejecting the evidence of the prosecution in criminal trials and of the other"
"side in civil trials. Contradictions have to be proved in accordance with the"
"procedure prescribed under the Evidence Ordinance, otherwise it would have"
"no  evidentiary  value  and  would  not  be  admissible.  A  witness  can  be"
"contradicted with its previous statements either made by him in writing or"
"reduced into writing by someone."
"For contradiction to be essential and to affect the decision of a trial court,"
"such contradictions must be material and fundamental. They must create"
"doubt in the mind of the court to such a degree that the court believes that"
"the  doubt  must  be  resolved  in  favour  of  the  accused.  Therefore,  it  is  very"
"much important to evaluate the evidence given by the witnesses in a criminal"
"trial very carefully."
"The Learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel contended that the evidence given by PW1"
"and  PW2  are  contradictory  which  certainly  vitiates  the  conviction  in  this"
