"Upon the matter being sent back to the Magistrate’s Court of Walasmulla, the learned Magistrate"
"who acted as the Primary Court Judge after taking into consideration all the evidence placed"
"before  him,  delivered  the  order  dated  20.02.2015  in  favour  of  the  1st  Respondent,  on  the"
"premise that the 1st Respondent was in possession of the disputed land two months prior to the"
"date of filing of the information in terms of Section 68 (1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"Being dissatisfied with the said order, the Appellant had preferred a revision application bearing"
"No.  HCRA/04/2015  to  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Southern  Province  holden  in  Tangalle,"
"seeking to revise or set aside the said order dated 20.02.2015."
"Consequently, the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle after hearing both parties, affirmed the"
"order  dated  20.02.2015,  by  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Walasmulla  and  dismissed  the  said"
"revision application by order dated 27.10.2016 with costs fixed at Rs. 10,500/-."
"Against the said order dated 27.10.2016 of the Provincial High Court of Tangalle, the Appellant"
"has preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal."
"This is an appeal preferred against an order of the Provincial High Court exercising revisionary"
"jurisdiction.  Since  no  appeal  is  provided  in  terms  of  section  74(2)  of  the  Primary  Court"
"Procedure Act against the order of the learned Magistrate, the court of Appeal is empowered to"
"evaluate the correctness of the exercising of revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial high Court"
"and it is not the task before the Court of Appeal to consider an appeal against an order made"
"under and in terms of section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. in the case of Nandawathi and another Vs. Mahindasena"
