"I take the view that as far as a Committee of the PSC exercises their delegated power without"
"amending, varying or disturbing the decisions of the principal, who is the PSC, such decisions"
"cannot be considered ultra vires. Hence, I am of the view that the Health Service Committee"
"of the PSC has the authority to make lawful incidental decisions which do not contradict the"
"decisions of the PSC, particularly, without superseding the Service Minute approved by the"
"PSC.  Such  lawful  incidental  decisions  are  needed  for  carrying  out  the  duties  of  the  said"
"Committee effectively within the scope of their delegated power. On a careful consideration"
"of  the  whole  matter,  I  need  to  conclude  that  the  Health  Service  Committee  has  taken  an"
"incidental  or  consequential  decision  to  approve  the  requirement  of  the  minimum  mark  as"
"reflected in 'P3(a)' with due legal authority to make such a decision and it neither affects nor"
"creates an impact upon any of the provisions of the said Service Minute marked ‘P2’."
"In light of the above, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to any relief as prayed for in"
"the Petition of the Petitioner. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss this Application."
"Application is dismissed."
