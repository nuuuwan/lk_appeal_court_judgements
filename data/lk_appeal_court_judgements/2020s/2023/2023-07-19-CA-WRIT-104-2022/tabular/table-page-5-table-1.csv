"Service Committee of the PSC. When considering the said preliminary objection, this Court"
"at the outset needs to examine whether the above Notice published by the 1st Respondent in"
"'P3' is tantamount to decisions taken by the PSC or its' Health Service Committee."
"The 1st Respondent Secretary to the Ministry of Health affirming an affidavit has submitted"
"that the Health Service Committee of the PSC had approved the requirement of obtaining a"
"minimum mark of 50% in the said written examination as a criterion. It is stated on the face"
"of the relevant Notice which contains the impugned paragraph marked 'P3(a)' that the said"
"Notice has been published as per the order of the Health Service Committee of the PSC. The"
"documents  marked  'R3'  and  'R4'  imply  that  the  said  Health  Service  Committee  has  taken"
"cognizance in specifying a minimum mark to be qualified by the respective examination.  The"
"Attorney General who represents the PSC in the instant Application has filed a motion on"
"28.07.2022 annexing a letter dated 21.06.2022 which is filed of record. It is a letter addressed"

"the  written  examination  is  discriminatory.  This  reflects  the  fact  that  the  Petitioners  are"
"challenging  an  order  or  decision  of  a  committee  of  the  PSC  which  was  illustrated  earlier."
"Thus,  I  am  inclined  to  accept  the  proposition  of  the  Respondents  that  this  Court  has  no"
"jurisdiction to inquire whether the decisions reflected in 'P3(a)' are unreasonable or unfair as"
"pleaded by the Petitioners. In other words, reviewing the impugned decision by this Court"
