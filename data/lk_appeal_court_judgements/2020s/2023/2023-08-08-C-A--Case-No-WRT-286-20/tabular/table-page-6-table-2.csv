"T","he learned Counsel for the petitioner advanced his arguments on the"
"following grounds.",""
"I.","Although it is stated in the letter P-9 that the marking scheme for"
"","the  structured  interview  is  attached  to  P-9,  a  document  (P-10)"
"","containing  only  the  subtopics  in  the  marking  scheme  for  the"
"","structured interview was attached to P-9. As the marking scheme"
"","for the structured interview was not given to the petitioner prior"
"","to 
the 
interview,  a 
fair 
interview  was  not  held,  and  UGC"
"","contravened the scheme of recruitment and procedure."
"II.","The Selection Committee had not been properly constituted, the"
"","Selection Committee failed to comply with the procedure followed"
"","in the past and no proper marking scheme had been used."
"III.","The decision of the USAB to dismiss the petitioners appeal on the"
"","ground 
that 
the  board  has  no 
jurisdiction 
to 
intervene 
is"
"","erroneous. The finding of the USAB that the evaluation process"
"","and the marks given to the petitioner are beyond the expertise of"
"","this  Board  is  illegal  and  irrational.  Thus,  the  USAB  order  has"
"","been made in contravention of the provisions in the Universities"
"","Act."
