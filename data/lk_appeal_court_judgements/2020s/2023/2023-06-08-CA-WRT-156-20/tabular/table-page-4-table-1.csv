"The learned State Counsel appeared for the respondents contended that"
"the  orders  contained  in  R-4  and  R-7  should  be  quashed  to grant  the"
"relief  of  reinstatement  prayed  for  by  the  petitioner,  but  according  to"
"Article 61A of the Constitution, this court has no jurisdiction to quash"
"an  order  made  by  the  Public  Service  Commission.  In  addition,  the"
"learned  State  Counsel  contended  that  the  petitioner  has  suppressed"
"material  facts  by  not  disclosing  the  letter  R-5,  wherein  it  is  clearly"
"mentioned the reason for terminating his service."
