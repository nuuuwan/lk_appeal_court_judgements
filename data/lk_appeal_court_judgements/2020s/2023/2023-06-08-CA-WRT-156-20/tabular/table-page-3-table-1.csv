"The  petitioner  was  served  with  a  charge  sheet  dated  09.02.2016"
"containing three charges, and consequently, a disciplinary inquiry was"
"conducted.  The  petitioner  stated  that  the  inquiry  was  concluded  on"
"19.11.2016, but no order has been issued against him."
"T
he  acting  Inspector  General  of  Police  informed  the  petitioner  by  the"
"letter dated 19.03.2014, marked R-5 (The date mentioned in the letter,"
"as  seen 
in  R-5, 
is  2014.03.19,  but  the  signature  was  placed 
in"
"2013.12.16,  prior  to  the  date  of  the  letter)  that  his  services  were"
"terminated and his name was struck off from the officers’ registry."
"S
ix  years  after  the  said  termination,  the  petitioner  filed  the  instant"
"application on 7th July 2020 seeking a writ of mandamus against the"
"1st 
to  3rd 
respondents  directing 
them 
to 
issue 
the  petitioner’s"
"disciplinary  order.  If  the  petitioner  is  acquitted  of  the  charges,  the"
"petitioner sought a writ of mandamus against the 1st to 3rd respondents"
"directing them to mobilize the petitioner in the post of  Reserve Police"
"Constable with effect from 20.06.2000,  absorb the petitioner into the"
"post  of  Regular  Police  Constable  and  pay  all  his  salaries  and"
"entitlements from 20.06.2000."
"A
t the hearing of the application, the learned Counsel for the petitioner"
"and 
the 
learned  State  Counsel 
for 
the 
respondents  made  oral"
"submissions."
"T
he main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner was that"
"since  a  disciplinary  inquiry  was  held  against  the  petitioner,  an  order"
"should  be  delivered  and  the  petitioner  is  entitled  to  obtain  the  said"
"order. The learned Counsel contended further that in terms of Section"
"22.4  of  Chapter  48,  Volume 
II  of 
the  Establishment  Code, 
the"
"disciplinary order should be issued immediately after the conclusion of"
"the inquiry and the 1st to 3rd respondents had breached the legal and"
"public duty by not issuing the disciplinary order."
