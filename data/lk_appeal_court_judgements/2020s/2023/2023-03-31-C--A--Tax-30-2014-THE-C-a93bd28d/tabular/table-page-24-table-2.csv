"CA/TAX/03/2017  Justice  Janak  de  Silva  referring  to  the  question  of  a  “Case"
"Stated” said at page 05 and 06,"
"“Section 11A (6) of the TAC Act reads:"
"""Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and determine"
"any question of law arising on the stated case and may in accordance with"
"the  decision  of  Court  upon  such  question,  confirm,  reduce,  increase  or"
"annul the assessment determined by the Commission, or may remit the"
"case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court, thereon."" (emphasis"
"added)."
"The words ""hear and determine any question of law arising on the stated"
"case"" appeared in section 74(5} of the Income Tax Ordinance No 2 of 1932"
"and was interpreted by Basnayake e.J. in R.M. Fernando v. Commissioner"
"of Income Tax (Supra. at 577) to mean that it requires the Court to hear"
"and determine any questions of law arising on the stated case and not any"
"question or questions formulated by the Board. Previously in M.P. Silva v."
"Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  (Reports  of  Ceylon  Tax  Cases,  Vol.  I,  page"
"336 at 338) Canekeratne J. having considered section 74(5} of the Income"
"Tax Ordinance No 2 of 1932 held that ""all questions that could be raised"
"on the whole case was intended to be left open"". The learned Judge chose"
"to follow the dicta in Ushers Wiltshire Brewery v. Bruce [(1915) A.C. 433"
"at 465,466]”."
