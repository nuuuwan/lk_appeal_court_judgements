"3.  The  Tax  Appeals  Commission  (“TAC”),  however,  appears  to  have  held"
"that the Supreme Court decision in the subsequent order issued pursuant"
"to  Dr.  P.  B.  Jayasundera’s  application  delivered  on  13th  October  2009"
"(“subsequent order”) had “set aside all findings” of the original judgment."
"As the subsequent order does no such thing, it would appear that the TAC"
"has mistakenly relied upon some other unknown order. The TAC allowed"
"the appeal on the preliminary issue of time bar, based on such erroneous"
"premise”."
