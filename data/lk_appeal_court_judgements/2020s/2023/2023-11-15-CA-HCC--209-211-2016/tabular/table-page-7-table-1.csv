"There is no evidence as to animosity between the accused-appellants and PW1, who is the"
"main eye witness. There is no reason for PW 1 to falsely claim that 1A, 2A and 3A were present"
"at the scene and committing the purported acts."
"In Pannila Gamage Roshan Sampath Kumara vs. The Attorney General C.A.Case NO:-34/2013"
"dated 23.06.2015, it has been held thus; “The accused-appellant has given evidence from the"
"dock and the learned trial Judge has held that the dock statement has not created any doubt"
"in the prosecution case. The accused-appellant has only denied the charge against him and"
"said  that  he  had  no  animosity  with  deceased.  There  is  hardly  any  evidence  in  the  dock"
"statement to evaluate. It amounts only to a bare denial of the allegation levelled against him"
"by the prosecution. In my view that the learned trial Judge has correctly rejected the dock"
"statement of the accused-appellant. The dock statement is not credible and nor does it create"
"any doubt on the prosecution case.”"
"On  perusal  of  the  judgment  of  the  learned  trial  Judge  it  is  stark  that  the  trial  Judge  had"
"considered and evaluated all the material evidence that had been led before him at the trial"
"by both parties. Considering the above, there is no ground either in law or fact to allow this"
"appeal."
"The  evidence  of  defence  witnesses  the  case  of  defence  rests  on  the  evidence  of  the  1st"
"accused - Uthumalebbai Semilathumma, the 3rd accused - Atham Lebbai Mohamed Ibrahim"
"and the 2nd accused gave a dock statement."
"The 1st accused - Uthumalebbai Semilathumma."
"She  was  an  illiterate  woman  who  had  given  birth  to  9  children.  The  period  in  which  the"
"incident  happened  was  the  time  of  the  General  Election  and  she  and  her  family  were"
"supporters of Athaulla whilst the deceased and their family supported Hakeem. The deceased"
"came to invite the 1st accused and her family for a meal which were organized by their political"
"party and they refused as they supported the opposing party. Because of that reason some"
"of the deceased Sinnathamby's people threw stones at her houses."
"The deceased Sinnathamby came to her house on 05.04.2004, on the date of the incident"
"before breakfast and pulled her clothes and harassed her saying that he will give her the 10th"
"child and tried to rape her and further the deceased Sakeer said he will rape her daughter."
"There she attacked the deceased by a pole to defend her dignity and the blows may have"
"been made on his head. At the material time, her husband had gone to the sea and the 2nd"
"accused  was  at  the  house  belonging  to  Dawood  and  the  3rd  accused  had  gone  to  tuition"
"classes.  The  2nd  accused  came  to  the  scene and  asked  what  happened after the  deceased"
"Sakeer ran and jumped over the wall. The 3rd accused came there at about 11.00 am when"
"the  crowds  were  gathering  at  her  house.  She  made  a  complaint  to  the  police  after  the"
"incident. She was arrested while she was at her house. The police told her that her house was"
"demolished  and  burnt  after  the  arrest.  At  the  police  station,  she  gave  a  statement  to  the"
"police  and  placed  her  thump  impression.  She  was  illiterate  and  could  not  read  what  was"
"recorded and the police did not read over the statement to her and therefore did not know"
"whether the police recorded entire statement (vide page 439 bottom)."
