"deceased  and  the  accused–appellants  respectively,  as  to  they  supported  in  antagonistic"
"political parties at the general election 2004. The deceased Sakeer came to the 1st accused's"
"house while she was alone on 05.04.2004 lifting his sarong and attempted to rape her and"
"threatened that he will kidnap and rape her daughter. The 2nd witness was at Dawood's house"
"and the 3rd accused was attending classes at the material time. The 1st accused-appellant used"
"the right of private defence and gave several blows with a club. The deceased Sakeer jumped"
"over the wall and ran."
"Sinnathamby Shifaya (vide page 178);"
"She was the sister of the victim and she had studied up to Ordinary Level. She said that there"
"were walls on the three boundaries of her land and the rear boundary was a cadjan fence."
"She  further  testified  that  the  front  side  of  her  land  faced  a  lane  (vide  page  p185).  This"
"corroborated the sketch produced by the police at page 532. She testified that the adjoining"
"land of her rear boundary was a bare land (vide page 186) where the incident took place."
"However, this was contrary to the sketch of the police. According to the said sketch the bare"
"land was in between Azees' house and the accused’s house."
"She said her deceased brother came to her house at Oluvil-01 in the morning from her sister's"
"house which was at Oluvil-02. She was bathing at the well. The well was located at the front"
"left side of her house and the front was facing the lanes which lead to the main road. Her"
"brother, deceased Sakeer said he wanted to bathe as well and was getting ready to take a"
"bath while talking to his sister."
"She testified that while she was bathing at the well, she heard a noise (of people hitting) from"
"rear side of the of the house and some voices. The voices were voices of a male, a female and"
"her brother's voice. She said that she ran towards the rear side and looked out through the"
"fence. ('I peeped through rear fence') She said that the fence was taller than her and further"
"she  admitted  that  it  was  taller  than  her  present  height  answering  a  question  lead  at  the"
"examination-in-chief.  She  has  said  elsewhere  that  she  climbed  on  a  toilet  pit  which  was"
"situated in a smaller gap and stood and looked 10 to 15 feet away. This is the most material"
"part  of  her  testimony  where  she  testified  that  she  saw  the  incident.  The  entirety  of  the"
"prosecution's  evidence  was  based  on  her  evidence  as  she  was  the  only  eyewitness  to  the"
"incident. It is respectfully submitted that there was no possibility whatsoever to see the place"
"at which the incident took place. This makes it clear by referring the sketch produced by the"
"police. In the said sketch her house is marked as `A' and shows clearly that the front side of"
"her land was facing the lane. Azees' house which was marked 'C' was in her left boundary and"
"the  bare  land  and  the  narrow  pathway  where  the  incident  took  place  was  next  to  Azees'"
"house. According to her version, the rear boundary of her land was a cadjan fence and she"
"saw the incident through and/or over that fence. Therefore, the rear boundary is the opposing"
"boundary  of  the  front  side  which  was  facing  the  lane  and  the  cadjan  fence  was  at  that"
"boundary. It is impossible seeing the incident through the cadjan fence which was at her rear"
"boundary and hence her testimony is suspicious. It is further observable, that the bare land is"
"located next to the accused’s house and this corroborated the version of the 1st accused. The"
"1st accused stated that the deceased ran and jumped over the wall when she attacked him. It"
"is respectfully submitted that the injured Sakeer, who was the victim was found on the narrow"
"pathway in between the bare land and Azees' house  and not in the bare land. The injured"
