"of Azees' house as it were barbed wire fences in all four boundaries of his land. However, she"
"could not go to the bare land and the adjacent narrow pathway through her rear boundary"
"as it faced the opposite side of the place where the incident took place. The only possibility"
"to reach the bare land was through her front gate which was facing the lane connecting to"
"the main road."

"further stated that she saw the accused-appellants with poles over their shoulders among the"
"mob gathered (vide page 195). However, this was not corroborated by any other witness. She"
"stated  that  afterwards,  they  took  the  injured  Sakeer  to the  Palamunai  Hospital  (vide page"
"198) by Ismile's  vehicle (vide  page  199)  and  later  to  Batticaloa  Hospital and from  there  to"

"the sketch of the police at page 532) through the cadjan fence. He further admitted that he"
"did  not  see  the  accused  among  the  crowd.  This  corroborates  with  the  version  of  the  1st"
