"I
n the case at hand, when the letter P4-e was received by the petitioner"
"stating 
that  he  had  been  promoted 
to  Grade 
I  with  effect 
from"
"17.05.2015, he requested by letter dated 04.11.2013 marked P5-a, that"
"he be awarded the rank of Ambassador with effect from 17 May 2013."
"After considering his request, the Ambassador rank was approved with"
"effect  from  01.03.2014  by  the  letter  P5-b  but  not  with  effect  from"
"17.05.2013. In the same letter, it was mentioned that the petitioner is"
"entitled 
to 
the  overseas  service  allowance  and  other  allowances"
"applicable 
to 
the 
rank  of  Ambassador.  Although 
the  petitionerâ€™s"
"complaint  was  that  the  date  01.03.2014  has  been  fixed  arbitrarily,  I"
"regret  that  I  am  unable  to  agree  with  that  argument  because  the"
"decision  to  award  the  rank  of  Ambassador  is  made  by  the  relevant"
"authority,  and  the  relevant  authority 
is  not  bound  to 
inform  the"
"petitioner  of  the  basis  for  fixing  the  effective  date.  Furthermore,  the"
"relevant  authority  is  not  legally  or  statutorily  obligated  to  award  the"
"rank of Ambassador from the date of promoting the officer to Grade I."
