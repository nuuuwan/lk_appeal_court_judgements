"category of 'student' as a whole and it is to uphold the true nature of a ‘university’ as a"
"consequence to the powers and functions described in the said Act."
"In Liyanage and others vs. Gampaha Urban Council and others (1991) 1 Sri. L.R. 1  S. N."
"Silva J. held :"
"""However, in construing the relevant statutory provisions the Court will bear in mind the"
"need  to  promote  the  general  legislative  purpose  underlying  these  provisions  and  consider"
"whether the impugned act is incidental to or consequential upon the express provisions. If it"
"is so considered necessary, the impugned act will not be declared ultra vires'."
"S. N. Silva J. in the above Liyanage and Others case has referred to the case of Attorney"
"General vs. The Great Eastern Railway Co. (1880 (5) Appeal Cases 473) where the House of"
"Lords  approved  the  doctrine  of  ultra  vires  with  some  refinement  that  lend  it  a  greater"
"flexibility. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Selborne) restated (at p. 478) therein the doctrine"
"as follows,"
"""I assume that your Lordships will not now recede from anything that was determined in"
"The Ashbury Railway Company vs. Riche (1)5; It appears to me to be important that the"
"doctrine of ultra vires, as it was explained in that case, should be maintained. But I agree"
"with Lord Justice James that this doctrine ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably,"
"understood  and  applied,  and  that  whatever  may  fairly  be  regarded  as  incidental  to,  or"
"consequential  upon,  those  things  which  the  Legislature  has  authorized,  ought  not  (unless"
"expressly prohibited) to be held, by judicial construction, to be ultra vires'."
"Hence, I am not convinced that admitting day scholars to the said University would be"
"unlawful  on  the  pretext  of  the  provisions  of  Section  3  or  Section  4  of  the  Act.  Also,  it"
"cannot be assumed that such decision would contravene the purported wish of General Sir"
"John  Kotelawala  and  the  stipulation  in  the  preamble  of  the  Act.  I  have  arrived  at  that"
"conclusion  based  on  the  decision  of  the  Parliament  to  confer  ‘university’  status  to  the"
"aforesaid Academy. In my view, when the said Academy was conferred with ‘university’"
"status, the provisions in Sections 3 and 4 of the Act become only an additional criterion to"
"enroll students and to decide on study programmes. There cannot be any specific reason"
"to  restrict  admission  only  to  limited  categories  after  conferring  the  ‘university’  status."
"Determining the eligibility criteria for admitting students should be in the sole authority"
