"studies  for  students  who  do  not  come  within  the  above  four  categories.  The  Petitioner"
"asserts that in the context of recent public debate regarding the militarization of the higher"
"education  system  in  Sri  Lanka,  there  were  attempts  to  legitimize  the  intake  of  civilian"
"students by the passage of the General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University"
"Bill (‘P4’). It appears according to the pleadings that the Petitioner's main objective in the"
"instant Application is to address the alleged illegality that will be prospectively committed"
"by the University and limit the instant Application & its prayers to seek only prospective"
"reliefs."
"The  Respondents  raising  preliminary  objections submit  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"resort  to  Article  121  of  the  Constitution  to  invoke  the  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  the"

"freedoms under Article 10 and 12(1) of the Constitution."
"What  needs  consideration  in  the  instant  Application  for  judicial  review  is  whether  the"
"Respondents  have  exceeded  their  powers  by  admitting  the  students  who  do  not  come"
"within the categories of pre-officer cadets, officer cadets, officers, and/or public officers."
"The powers, duties and functions of the University are described in Section 4 of the Act"
"by which the main focus is to accommodate the students who come within the above four"
"categories.  Thus,  a  pertinent  question  arises  as  to  whether  enrolling  or  admitting  any"
"student who does not fall into such categories would become a usurpation of the powers"
"of the Respondents."
"Nowhere in the said Section 4 or in the other provisions of the said Act does it expressly"
"exclude the power of the Respondents to admit civilian day scholars to the University to"
"follow degree programmes etc. It is important to draw attention to Section 4(ah) of the"
"said Act by which power is vested in the University to recognize persons recommended"
"by the Board of Management of the University. The said Section 4(ah):"
