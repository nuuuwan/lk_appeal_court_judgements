"students to the general society; no single affidavit of a current or past civilian student has"
"been tendered to Court. It is obvious that grave prejudice would be caused to the present"
"civilian  students  if  this  Court  issues  an  order  adverse  to  them  without  hearing  such"
"students. The Petitioner rather than adding the present or past civilian day scholars have"
"made the said Trade Union a party who seems to have no better  interest on the instant"
"application  than  the  said  day  scholars.  This  clearly  reflects  the  fact  that  the  necessary"
"parties are not before Court. It would in my opinion be irresponsible for any court, without"
"hearing necessary parties including the current students at the University, to overrule the"
"impugned  decision  on  a  matter  which  directly  affects  the  students  who  intend  to  seek"
"higher education within the country."
"Based on my above findings, I do not think it’s necessary to examine the Respondents’"
"other preliminary objections fully. In the circumstances, I am not inclined to grant any of"
"the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the Application of"
"the Petitioner."
"Application is dismissed"
