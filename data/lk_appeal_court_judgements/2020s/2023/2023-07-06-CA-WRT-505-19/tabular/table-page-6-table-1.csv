"The  foregoing  documents  substantiate  the  fact  that  the  Petitioner  has  been"
"suffering from an ailment associated with his spinal cord even before the date on"
"which  he  was  hospitalized  as  per  P1.    The  Medical  Examination  Board  Report"
"marked P2 indicates that the Petitioner has been suffering from the same illness"
