"situations where an accused person has not been granted bail by the time the"
"indictment is served on the accused. It is on such instances, that the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  can  order  detention  on  that  person  pending  trial  until  or"
"unless he is granted bail by a competent Court, if that competent Court is not"
"the High Court which served the indictment on the accused."
"In the instant case, the accused has appeared before the High Court after being"
"granted bail by a competent Court as stated earlier. Under the circumstances, it"
"is the view of this Court that it was not open to the prosecuting State Counsel to"
"make  submissions  on  the  basis  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs"
"(Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022 arguing that the High Court has no jurisdiction"
"to grant bail. Such an argument can have substance only in a situation where"
"the accused has not been granted bail, if the pure quantity of the drug was over"
"ten grams as provided for in the Amendment."
"It is the view of this Court that this is common sense more than anything else."
"Once  a  person  is  granted  bail  by  a  competent  Court,  that  person  can  be"
"remanded again if any of the bail conditions have been violated by such a person."
"It is the view of this Court that since there is no indication that the accused has"
"violated the bail conditions imposed on her, the learned High Court Judge was"
"misdirected as to the relevant law when it was ordered that the accused shall be"
"kept  in  remand  custody  and  that  he  has  no  jurisdiction  to  grant  bail.  The"
"question of jurisdiction to grant bail would not arise in the instant matter."
"Accordingly,  the  order  dated  05-01-2023  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of"
"Colombo where the accused has been remanded is hereby set aside. The learned"
"High Court Judge is directed to order the release of the accused forthwith on the"
"bail conditions she has already fulfilled in accordance with the bail order made"
"on 17-02-2022 by the High Court of Colombo."
"The Registrar of the High Court of Colombo is directed to call for the original case"
"record  No.  B52348/05/21  from  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Colombo  where  the"
"accused has deposited her bail money and the sureties have entered their bail"
