"The accused has been arrested by the officers of the Colombo Crimes Division"
"on 22nd June 2021 on the allegation that she had in her possession 102 grams"
"and  192  milligrams of  Heroin.  However, according  to  the  Government  Analyst"
"Report, the pure quantity of the said Heroin was 41.81 grams."
"The  accused  had  preferred  an  application  for  bail  under  the  provisions  of  the"
"Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance to the High Court of Colombo."
"The learned High Court Judge of Colombo, being satisfied that the accused had"
"established sufficient exceptional circumstances which entitled her to be granted"
"bail, had granted bail to the accused by his order dated 17th February 2022."
"The  accused  had  been  indicted  before  the  High  Court  of  Colombo  by  the"
"indictment dated 05-05-2022 by the Hon. Attorney General for offences in terms"
"of  section  54A  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance.  The"
"indictment had been served on the accused on 5th January 2023."
"When  the  indictment  was  served  on  the  accused,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"accused  had  moved  for  bail  in  terms  of  section  195  of  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure Act, informing the Court that she is already on bail granted by the"
"High  Court  of  Colombo.  However,  it  appears  from  the  proceedings,  when  this"
"application  was  made  on  that  day,  the learned  State  Counsel  who  prosecuted"
"had  objected  to  the  accused  being  granted  bail  on  the  basis  that  the  pure"
"quantity of Heroin alleged to have been found in the possession of the accused"
"was 41.8 grams. It had been his position that since the pure quantity of the drug"
"was  more  than  10  grams,  in  terms  of  Poisons,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs"
"(Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022, it is only the Court of Appeal that can grant"
"bail under  exceptional circumstances. He has urged that since the High Court"
"has no jurisdiction to grant bail, the accused should be remanded."
"It appears that the learned High Court Judge has accepted the said argument"
"by the learned State Counsel and remanded the accused by his order dated 05-"
"01-2023."
