"practice. If unable to do so, the public authority concerned should compensate the person affected"
"by having placed reliance on such representations and practices.”"
"Apart  from  the  legitimate  expectation  of  the  Petitioners,  no  substantial  material  has  been"
"submitted for this Court to declare that the original rights of the said Stephen De Silva are"
"unlawful. It cannot be assumed under the Land Reform Law that the LRC has the authority"
"to take over possession of a larger portion of land for the mere purpose of identifying a lesser"
"portion that is depicted in a statutory declaration. Moreover, in line with the precedent laid"
"down by the superior courts, I am not convinced with the proposition of the LRC that the"
"Petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  a  writ  of  Mandamus.  Further,  the  representations  and  the"
"practice  of  the  LRC emanated  through  the  communications  discussed  above  outweigh  the"
"technical objection raised by the LRC referring to the locus standi of the Petitioners."
"In  light  of  my  above  findings,  I  take  the  view  that  a  mandate  in  the  nature  of  a  writ  of"
"Mandamus should be issued directing the Land Reform Commission to release a portion of"
"land with a minimum extent of A17-R3-P23 from and  out of the  land described in the 2nd"
"Schedule to the Petition or an alternate land with the same extent to the legitimate heirs of"
"Gajasinghege  Stephen  De  Silva  without  adopting  a  tedious  process  that  may  cause  an"
"additional inconvenience to the Petitioners. However, I am not inclined to issue a quashing"
"order as prayed for in paragraph ‘c’ in the prayer of the Petition."
