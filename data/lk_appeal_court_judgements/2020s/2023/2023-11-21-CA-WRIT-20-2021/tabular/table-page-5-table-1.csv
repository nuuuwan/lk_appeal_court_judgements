"In  proof  of 
such  continuous 
representations  made 
to 
the  LRC, 
the 
letters  marked"
"‘X7’,’X8’,’X9’,’X10’,’X11’  and  ‘X12’  are  annexed  to  the  Petition.  Referring  to  the  letters"
"marked 
‘X13,’X14,’X15’, 
‘X16’  and 
‘X17’, 
the  Petitioners  assert 
that 
the  LRC  has"
"acknowledged the gaining of the possession of the portions of land upon which the Petitioners"
"raise  their  claims  that  stem  from  the  rights  of  the  said  deceased  Gajasinghege  Stephen  De"
"Silva. Additionally, the Petitioners have annexed letters marked ’X18’ to ’X31’ in which the"
"correspondence between the relevant authorities and the Petitioners are well reflected. The"
"steps  taken  by  the  Petitioners  to  make  further  representations  to  the  Chairman  and  other"
"officers  of 
the  LRC 
to 
resolve 
the 
issues  amicably  are  also  viewed 
through 
such"
"communications."
"The  Petitioners 
further 
contend 
that 
the  LRC  as  a 
consequence  of 
the  aforesaid"
"correspondence has finally conceded to the Petitioners' entitlement limiting it to a portion of"
"land in extent of A17-R3-P23. It is submitted that the LRC has limited the extent as above"
"based  on 
two 
transfer  deeds  bearing  No.636  and  No.637  attested  on  22.02.1981  by"
"A.Kakulawala Notary Public. Anyhow, the Petitioners state that the title has never passed"
"due to the said transfer deeds, since the respective transferees had been paid due consideration"
"upon 
their 
loss  of  rights 
to  same/surrendering  or 
the  said  deeds  and  disclaiming  all"
"rights/title.  Likewise,  the  Petitioners  claim  that  they  are  entitled  to  a  portion  of  land  in  a"
"minimum extent of A17-R3-P23."
"Now I must examine the aforesaid correspondence annexed to the Petition of the Petitioner."
"The letters marked ‘X7’, ‘X15’, ‘X16’ and ‘X18’ display that the process of contemplating the"
"Petitioner’s request has commenced during the year 1985. The Director-Land Ceiling of LRC"
"by a letter marked ‘X18’ (06.02.1987) has expressed his opinion that the undeclared portion"
"of land belonging to the said Stephen De Silva should be released. The ‘X19’ and ‘X20’ also"
"reflect an attempt of the LRC to find an alternate land. The Director-Land Ceiling, even in"
"the year 2005 by his letter marked ‘X25’ (dated 17.06.2005) has recognized the entitlement of"
"the said Stephen De Silva for a portion of land in extent of A33-R3-P22 within the land called"
"“WeerawilaWatte”."
"The  Chairman  of  LRC  after  an  inquiry,  emphasized  by  a  letter  dated  08.08.2005  marked"
"‘X26’ that the said Stephen De Silva is entitled to a portion of land in the extent of A33-R3-"
