"financial  business  of  trading  in  securities  for  generating  income,  the  dividend"
"payment  regularly  received  as  a  consideration  in  the  trading  of  shares  may"
"constitute a supply of financial service”."
"[152]  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  facts  of  case  in  Peoples’  Leasing  and  Finance"
"PLC  v.  The  Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue  (supra)  are  totally  different"
"from  the  facts  of  the  present  case.  The  Peoples’  Leasing  and  Fiannce  PLC  was"
"admittedly  a  finance  company  registered  with  the  Central  Bank  of Sri  Lanka,  and"
"thus, it was regarded as a specified institution  within the meaning of Section 25F"
"of the VAT Act. It was clearly a Leasing and Finance PLC carrying on the business"
"of  supplying  financial  services 
identified 
in  that  case.  Accordingly,  the  VAT"
"liability of Peoples’ Leasing and Finance PLC was decided completely on different"
"factual  and  VAT  law  principles.  As  noted,  the  principles  decided  in  the  case  of"
"Peoples’ Leasing and Finance PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue"
"(supra)  will  not  apply  to  the  Appellant  who  is  only  carrying  on  life  insurance"
"business  with  an  investment  element,  and  investing  the  policyholders’  premium"
"income for the sole purpose of enhancing the value of premium income of the life"
"insurance fund."
"[153]  For  those  reasons, 
I  hold  that  the  TAC  has  erred 
in  holding  that  the"
"Appellant has supplied financial services as defined in section 25F of the VAT Act"
"and that the Appellant is carrying on the business of supplying of financial services"
"in terms of section 25A(1) read with section 25F of the VAT Act."
"Conclusion"
"[
154] For those  reasons, I am of the view that the question of law No. 1 should be"
"answered in favour of the Respondent and the questions of law Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,"
