in the case of life insurance, the interest is not the measure of loss."
"What is life insurance?"
"[117] Life insurance is a contract whereby the insured agrees to pay certain sums,"
"called  premiums,  at  specified  times,  and 
in  consideration  thereof  the 
insurer"
"agrees  to  pay  certain  sums  of  money  upon  the  death  of  the  injured  on  certain"
"conditions and in specified ways (Life Insurance Corporation of India  v. Vishwanath"
"Verma  and  Ors.  (30.09.1994  -  SC)  :  Civil  Appeal  No.  6493  of  1994,  Decided  on:"
"30.09.1994).  In terms of section 114(1) of the Regulation of Insurance Act of 2004,"
"'Life  Insurance'  is  confined  to    “contracts  of  insurance  dependent  on  human"
"life” and thus, the exemption of the life insurance applies to the insurer, being the"
"person authorized to carry on such life insurance business (S.Balaratnnam, VALUE"
"ADDED  TAX  IN  SRI  LANKA,  p.  606).    Life  insurance  contracts  are  relatively  long-"
"term compared to non-life insurance policies, which are usually for a short period"
"of  time.  Life 
insurance 
involves  one  event–  death,  the  risk  of  which  for  any"
"individual is often based on a standard mortality table.  In fact, to  a large degree"
"much life insurance is investment,  and it remains, from a market point of view at"
"least, an investment (Malcolm A. Clarke, The Law of Insurance Contracts, 5th Ed. P"
"16). What distinguishes it from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield,"
"depends  on  the  contingencies  of  human  life  (Supra).  Any  activity  which  involves"
"the investment of the customers’ premiums, carry an element of risk for the insurer"
"of  the  life  insurance  product  or  which  can  properly  be  seen  as  an  insurance  risk"
"(Supra). Such an operation might be regarded as an activity which is related to the"
"maintenance  and  preservation  of 
life 
insurance 
fund  and  payment 
to 
the"
"customers by way of bonuses and other corresponding  benefits to the insurer."
"[118] The insurer to carry on business requires authorization under the Regulation"
"of  Insurance  Industry  Act,  No.  43  of  2000,  and  therefore,  it  is  only  the  insurer"
"effecting  life  insurance,  who  is  exempt  under  the  provisions  in  the  VAT  Act  (S."
