"ordinary  principles  of  revenue  law,  albeit  the  holding  of  an  asset  in  a  particular"
"fund  may  be  a 
relevant factor in  ascertaining  whether 
the 
investment  was"
"intended to be held as a capital asset”."
"[125] In my view, the purpose of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act is for the"
"regulation of the insurance business for the protection of policy holders’ deposits"
"in  investments  and  the  prohibition  of  insurance  companies  from  engaging  in"
"financial services without authorization. The VAT liability of an insurance company"
"is  solely  determined  by  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  through  the  VAT  Act"
"which is interpreted by the Courts  and relevant tribunals.  Now the question is to"
"consider  the  relationship  between  the 
insurance  business  and  the 
investment"
"income derived from the policyholders’ premium income in the life insurance fund"
"and the relevant VAT liability arising therefrom. It is necessary to consider whether"
"the 
investment  activities  carried  out  by  the  Appellant  were  required  to  earn"
"income for the purpose of carrying on its insurance business and if so, whether the"
"activities  carried  out  by  the 
insurance  must  be  held  to  be  a  part  of  the 
life"
"insurance business."
"The role of investment income in the life insurance business- the Investment"
"is  part of the life insurance"
"[126] The crucial question is whether the interest income was a mere enhancement"
"of  value  of  the  premium  income  of  the  life  insurance  fund  from  investment  by"
"realizing securities and other financial instruments. If not, the question is whether"
"it was made in the course of carrying on the business of supplying of the financial"
"services for sole profit-making defined in section 25F(g).  In determining the scope"
"of  VAT,  it  is  therefore  necessary  to  draw  a  distinction  between  the  life  insurance"
"business with an investment element, and investment business. Usually, insurance"
"companies  generate income  from  charging  premiums  in  exchange  for  insurance"
"coverage, and then invest them in other income-generating assets. There are two"
"significant  elements  arising  from  the  life  insurance  transaction,  and  the  ultimate"
"beneficial  interest  to  the  end  customer.  The  first  is  the  ""insurance  transactions"
"proper” and the second is the ""operations arising directly therefrom involving the"
"element of investment”. The insurance law allows insurance companies to carry out"
"""not  only 
insurance  transactions  proper”  but  also  ""operations  arising  directly"
"therefrom” by investing the policy holders’  monies  in  securities and other similar"
"instruments for the purpose of earning an income."
