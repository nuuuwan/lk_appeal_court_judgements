"effect  that  “the  appeal  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  allowed  where  the  Tax"
"Appeals Commission fails to adhere to the time limit specified in section 10 of the"
"Tax Appeals Commission Act."
"[35] There are guidelines in tax statutes, which stipulate that the failure to observe"
"any time limit provision would render the appeal null and void or that the appeal"
"shall be deemed to have been allowed. For example, Section 165 (14) of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), provides that “an appeal preferred to"
"the 
Commissioner-General 
shall 
be 
agreed 
to, 
or 
determined 
by 
the"
"Commissioner-General within a period of two years from the date on which such"
"petition  of  appeal 
is  received...”.  The  same  section  specifically  stipulates  that"
"“where such appeal is not agreed to or determined within such period, the appeal"
"shall be deemed to have been allowed and tax charged accordingly”."
"[36] An identical provision is contained in section 34 (8) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of"
"2002  as  well,  which  stipulates  that  “where  such  appeal 
is  not  agreed  to,  or"
"determined within such period, the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed"
"and the tax charged accordingly”. Although the Tax Appeals Commission Act was"
"amended by Parliament twice and increased the period within which the appeal is"
"to be determined by the Commission from 180 days to 270 days with retrospective"
"effect, the legislature in its wisdom did not specify any penal consequence or any"
"other  consequence  of  non-compliance  of  the  time  bar  specified  in  section  10  of"
"the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act.    Had  the  legislature  intended  that  the  non-"
"compliance  with  section  10  to  be  mandatory,  it  could  have  easily  included  a"
"provision  with  negative  words  requiring  that  an  act  shall  be  done  in  no  other"
"manner or at no other time than that designated in the section or a provision for a"
"penal  consequence  or  other  consequence  of  non-compliance.  This  proposition"
"was echoed by FOTH, C. J. in the Supreme Court of Kansas decision in Paul v. The"
"City of Manhattan, 511 P.2d (1973) 212 Kan. 381, paragraph 17 as follows:"
