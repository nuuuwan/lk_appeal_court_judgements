"Gunetilleke 
that  certain  activities  of 
the  Appellant’s  business,  namely, 
the"
"activities in subparagraph 25F(g)-“the provision of any loan , advance and credit”"
"falls  within  the  definition  of  financial  services  in  terms  of  section  25F  of  the  VAT"
"Act.  He  submitted  that  none  of  the  fifteen  activities  identified  by  the  assessor  is"
"life or general insurance business, but are investment income falling within “loan,"
"advance and credit” in section 25F(g) of the VAT Act."
"[109] He strongly relied on the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance, No. 7"
"of  1937 
(as  amended)  and 
submitted 
that  when 
the  Government 
issued"
"securities, it is raising  a loan and thus, any person who purchases  such securities"
"issued by the Government is providing a loan to the Government. His submission"
"was  that, 
in  addition  to 
investment  of 
life 
insurance  business 
in  government"
"securities, the Appellant was also involved in the provision of interest bearing loan,"
"advance  and  credit  using  other 
investments  which  are  also 
liable  to  VAT  on"
"financial services. Mr.  Gunetilleke, thus submitted that, therefore, the Appellant is"
"liable for VAT on financial services  under Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act."
"Provision of Loan, advance or credit"
"[110] It is not in dispute that the provision of loan, advance or  credit constitutes"
"financial  services  as  defined  in  section  25F  of  the  VAT  Act.  The  provision  of  any"
"loan,  advance  or  credit  is  wide  enough  to  encompass  activities  such  as-  (a)  loan"
"facilities 
(that 
include  the  granting  of  credit  or  secured  or  unsecured  credit"
"facilities,  the  receipt  of  fees  received 
in  respect  of  such  services,  charges  for"
"making arrangement for the granting of credit; (b) provision of credit facilities that"
"include  purchase  or  repurchase  arrangements  and  credit  of  the  investments  in"
"stocks, investments or business purposes."
"[111] It is not in dispute that Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued"
"under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923 (as amended) and Treasury"
"Bonds  which  are  medium 
to 
long 
term  debt 
instruments 
issued  under 
the"
"Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937 (as amended). It is not in"
"dispute 
that 
Treasury 
Bonds 
and 
Treasury 
Bills 
are government 
debt"
"securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka  and they  earn periodic interest"
"until  maturity.    Mr.  Gunetilleke  submitted  that  none  of  the  above  mentioned"
"activities  are  part  of  the 
life 
insurance  or  general 
insurance  business  of  the"
"Appellant, but they form part of the separate investment income of the Appellant"
"that  fall  within  “loans,  advance  or  credit”  in  section  25F  (g)  of  the  VAT  Act.  He,"
"apparently,  sought  to  restrict  the  life  insurance  to  the  “pure  premium  income”"
