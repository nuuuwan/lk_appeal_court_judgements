"of  making  determination  within 
the 
time 
limit  specified 
in  section  10.  The"
"retrospective operation of section 10 without any penal or other consequence of"
"non-compliance,  by  itself,  cannot  be  treated  as  a  factor  in  determining  that  the"
"legislature intended that the failure to adhere to the time limit specified in section"
"10 is mandatory."
"Avoidance of doubt clause"
"[47] Mr. Fernando, further relied on the avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15 of"
"the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act  to  argue  that  section  15  would  be  rendered"
"nugatory if the provisions of section 10 are considered to be directory. A perusal"
"of  section  15  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  (Amendment)  Act,  No.  20  of  2013"
"reveals  that  it  relates  to  appeals  that  have  been  transferred  to  the  Commission"
"from the Board of Review, and provides that the TAC shall have the power to make"
"a  determination 
in 
respect 
thereof,  beyond 
twelve  months  granted 
for 
its"
"determination of appeals by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 23 of 2011."
"[48]  It  seems  to  me  that  the  avoidance  of  doubt  clause  in  section  15  applies  to"
"appeals transferred from the Board of Review and not to new appeals directly filed"
"before the TAC. On the other hand, the intention of the legislature in section 15 is"
"to  empower  the  Commission  to  hear  an  appeal  transferred  to  it  by  the  Board  of"
"Review  under  section  10  of  the  Act,  notwithstanding  the  expiry  of  the  twelve"
"months granted for its determination by the Tax Appeals (Amendment) Act, No. 4"
"of  2012. 
It  seems  to  me  that  section  15  manifests  that  the 
legislature  never"
"intended that the time period specified in the general scheme of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission Act to be mandatory, and holding otherwise, would not promote the"
"main object of the legislature reflected in the Act."
"Consequences  of  non-compliance  with  a  statute  by  those  entrusted  with"
"public duty"
"[49] The other important factor that is necessary to consider, whether a provision"
"is mandatory or directory is to find as to who breached the time limit specified in"
"section 10-whether it was breached by one of the parties to the action, or by those"
"entrusted with the performance of a public duty. Also coming under this head are"
"cases  where  the  Court  will  take 
into  account  the  practical 
inconveniences  or"
"impossibilities  of  holding  a  time  limit  requirement  to  be  mandatory  where  the"
"public duty is performed by a public body. If the statutory provision relates to the"
"performance  of  a  public  duty,  the  Court 
is  obliged  to  consider  whether  any"
