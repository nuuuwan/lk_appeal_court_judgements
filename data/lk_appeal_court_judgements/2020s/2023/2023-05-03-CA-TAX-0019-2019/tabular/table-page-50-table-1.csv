"[127]  The  Argument  of  Mr.  Gunetilleke  that  the  exemption  of  life  insurance  is"
"limited to the minimum amount of  “pure  insurance premium” or the “amount of"
"cash  surrender  value”  in  a  ""life  insurance""  contract  does  not  exist  in  the  modern"
"investment oriented insurance business, which involves a combination of insurance"
"premium  component  and 
investment  component.

"obligation  undertaken  by  the  insurer  under  a  contract  of  life  insurance  is  not"
"limited to the payment of monies to the policy holders upon maturity and/or on"
"the  occurrence  of  a  covered  event,  as  formerly  thought,  but  it  also  extended  to"
"corresponding  benefits  or  services  offered  to  the 
insured  by  competitive

investment  of  policy  holders’  monies

"financial assets generates an additional interest income to the life insurance fund"

the  company  waits 
for  possible  payouts.  The 
life 
insurance 
is  highly"
"investment oriented business involving  the insurance and investment component"
"and the amounts invested from the insurance fund are tied to and payable to the"
"policy  holders,  in  addition  to  corresponding  benefits  in  terms  of  the  insurance"
