"“Generally, when the definition of a word begins with “means” it is indicative of"
"the fact that the meaning of the word has been restricted: that is to say, it would"
"not  mean  anything  else  but  what  has  been 
indicated 
in 
the  definition"
"else……Therefore,  unless  there  is  any  vagueness  or  ambiguity,  no  occasion  will"
"arise  to 
interpret  the  term 
in  a  manner  which  may  add  something  to  the"
"meaning  of  the  word,  which  ordinarily  does  not  mean  by  the  definition  itself,"
"more  particularly,  where 
it 
is  a  restrictive  definition” 
(see-further  Feroze  N."

"[103] In the Indian case of Mutto v. T.K. Nandi, [1979] 2 SCR 409 (418), it was said:"
"""The  Court  has  to  determine  the  intention  as  expressed  by  the  words  used.  If  the"
"words  of  a  statute  are  themselves  precise  and  unambiguous,  then  no  more  can  be"
"necessary  than  to  expound  those  words  in  their  ordinary  and  natural  sense.  The"
"words themselves alone do in such a case best declare the intention of the lawgiver."""
"As it was stated in another Indian case of Thompson v. Gould, [1910] A.C. 409 (420)"
"""it is a wrong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and"
"in  the  absence  of  clear  necessity,  it  is  a  wrong  thing  to  do so.  The  cardinal  rule  of"
"construction of statute is to read  statutes literally, that is, by giving to the words"
"their  ordinary,  natural  and  grammatical  meaning.""  [Jugalki-  shore  v.  Ram  Cotton"
"Co.  Ltd., 
[1955]  1  SCR  1369]. In  Punjab  Land  Development  and  Reclamation"
"Corporation  Ltd  v.  Presiding  Officer,  Labour  Court,  Chandigarh  (1990)  3  SCR  111),"
"the Supreme Court of India stated:"
"“The definition has used the word 'means'. When a statute says that a word or"
"phrase  shall  ""mean""--not  merely  that  it  shall  ""include""--certain  things  or  acts,"
"""the  definition 
is  a  hard-and-fast  definition,  and  no  other  meaning  can  be"
"assigned to the expression than is put down in definition"" (per Esher, M.R., Gough"
"v.  Gough,  [1891]  2  QB  665).  A  definition  is  an  explicit  statement  of  the  full"
"connotation of a term”."

"is exempt from VAT and the same is stated in paragraphs 49 and 50 of the written"
