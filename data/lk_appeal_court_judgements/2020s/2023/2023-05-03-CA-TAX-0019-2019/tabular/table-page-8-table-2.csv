"determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on"

"[20] In the present case, Mr. Nihal Fernando conceded that the statement made by"
"Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra)"
"would  not  constitute  a  ratio  decidendi,  but  it  is  a  relevant  judicial  dicta  which"
"cannot be regarded as a mere obiter statement. Thus, it is not in dispute that the"
"statement  of  Gooneratne  J.  is  not  a  ratio  decidendi  for  the  present  case.  The"
"relevance  of  the  statement  must  be,  however,  considered  in  the  context  of  the"
"facts  and  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and  the  relevant  legal  provisions  that"
"existed at that time."
