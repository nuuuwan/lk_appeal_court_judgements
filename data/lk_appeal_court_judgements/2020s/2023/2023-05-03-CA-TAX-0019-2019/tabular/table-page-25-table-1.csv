"“Based  on  Section  140  of  the  Act,  No.  38  of  2000,  the  legislature  intended  the"
"word ‘hearing’ to mean an oral hearing; ........."
"Section 140 (10) provides that the Board shall confirm, reduce, increase or annul"
"the  assessment  ‘after  the  hearing’  of  the  Appeal.  It  is  therefore  patently  evident"
"that  the  word  “hearing”  used  consistently  in  Section  140  of  Act  No.  38  of  2000"
"means an “oral hearing” and no more”."
