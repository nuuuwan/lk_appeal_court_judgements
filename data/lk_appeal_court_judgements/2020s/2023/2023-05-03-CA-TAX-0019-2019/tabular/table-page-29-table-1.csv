"on  in  the  course  of  business  of  supplying  financial  services.  His  main  arguments"
"included:  (i)  the  Appellant  is  neither  a  finance  company  nor  a  bank  providing"
"finance  services  within  the  meaning  of  the  VAT  Act;  (ii)  the  Appellant  is  neither"
"involved  in  the  business  of  supplying  financial  services  nor  provided  any  of  the"
"financial services contemplated in section 25F of the VAT Act; (iii) the Appellant is"
"only  engaged 
in 
insurance  business,  and 
its 
life 
insurance  business 
is  highly"
"statutorily  regulated  business  under  and  in  terms  of  the  Regulation  of  Insurance"
"Industry  Act,  No.  43  of  2000  (as  amended);  (iv)  the  life  insurance  business  that"
"comprises  the  investment  of  policy  holders’  premium  income  in  securities  and"
"other similar instruments; (v) the life insurance is not a financial service within the"
"contemplation of section 25F of the VAT and the life insurance is exempted from"
"VAT in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act; (vi) A"
"portion  of  life  insurance  cannot  be  subject  to  VAT  on  financial  services  and  the"
"Appellant  is  not  liable  to  pay  VAT  on  financial  services  in  respect  of  the  interest"
"income  received  from  the  investment  of  the  policy  holders’  premium  income  in"
"securities and other similar instruments."

"of the activities identified by the assessor form part of the life insurance business,"
"but  part  of  investment  income  received  from  government  securities  and  other"

"financial  activities  in  question  could  be  treated  as  supply  of  financial  services"
