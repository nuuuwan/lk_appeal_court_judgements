"insurance business and invests the life insurance monies to enhance its income is"
"as much a part of that business as the collection of the premiums. The purpose of"
"investing  the  funds  of  the  Appellant  is  thus  to  obtain  the  most  effective  yield  of"
"income."
"Distinction  between  carrying  on  the  business  of  supplying  financial  services"
"and earning of income by investment"
"[141] Mr. Gunetilleke however, argued that the investment activities are ancillary or"
"associated with the insurance business, and all such activities that are classified as"
"financial  services  under  section  25F(g)  shall  be  considered  as  an  integral  part  of"
"the business income of the Appellant subject to VAT in financial services. On the"
"other  hand,  Mr.  Fernando’s  argument  was  that  the  mere  fact  that  the  investment"
"income  received  by  the  Appellant  is  treated  as  business  income  does  not  mean"
"that  the  Appellant  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  supplying  financial  services.  In"
"this context, it is necessary to consider the distinction between the carrying on the"
"business of    supplying financial services and  the  earning of income for the mere"
"enhancement of the value of the life insurance fund."
"[142]  The  distinction  between  carrying  on  a  business  and  earning  income  from"
"investment in property was considered in the Indian case of Saifuddin Alimohamed"
"v.  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax,  Bombay  City  AIR1954  Bom  219  in  the  context  of"
"the  income  tax  law.  Dealing  with  Section  10  (1),  Income  Tax  Act,  Chagla,  C.  J.,"
"observed:"
"""Therefore, looking to the plain language used by the Legislature, what has been"
"emphasised  in  this  section  is  the  fact  of  a  business  being  carried  on  by  the"
"assessee.  It  is  the  assessee  who  carries  on  a  business  who  is  liable  to  pay  tax"
"under  the  head  of  business.  It  is  rather  significant  to  notice  the  difference  in"
"language in Section 10, and Section 9. Section 9 deals with tax under the head"
"of  property  and  that  tax  is  payable  by  an  assessee  who  is  the  owner  of  the"
"property.  So,  in  the  case  of  property,  what  is  emphasised  by  the  Legislature  is"
"ownership. In the case of business, what is emphasised is not the ownership of"
"the business, but the fact of the business being carried on by the assessee"
"[emphasis added]."
"[143] The concept of “business” referred to in section 25A (1) of the VAT Act, must,"
"however, constitute a “continuing activity which is predominantly concerned with"
"the business of an  specified institution or a  person  carrying  on  the business  of"
"supplying of any financial services to others for a consideration over a period of"
"time” (see-The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children v. Customs"
"and  Excise  Commissioners  (1992)  VATIR  417,  422).  This  means  that  a  supply  of"
