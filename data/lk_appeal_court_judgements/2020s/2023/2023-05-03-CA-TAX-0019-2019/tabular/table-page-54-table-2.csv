"N.Z.L.R.  694 the  Court  of  Appeal","in  New  Zealand  considered  the  relationship"
"between the life insurance and investment, and Cooke J. said, at pp. 697-698:",""
"","""In  the  general  sense  all  life  insurance  is  investment.  What  distinguishes  it"
"","from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield, if there is one, depends"
"","on the contingencies of human life. That is the case as regards all these bonds."
"","Under each a fixed sum, being more than the premium, becomes payable to the"
"","policyholder  or  his  personal  representative  (the  10-year  bond  carrying  as  well"
"","participation in surplus), but the date on which that fixed sum becomes payable"
"","depends on whether or not the life assured is continuing. It is true that the sum is"
"","calculated by adding to the premium a given percentage, and compounding the"
"","resulting  figure  if  necessary;  but  only  if  death  happens  to  occur  on  an  exact"
"","anniversary of the commencement of the risk will the sum correspond to interest"
"","for the actual use of money. No reason is apparent for describing these contracts"
"","as anything other than life insurance. In essence they are very closely linked with"
"","the contingencies of human life. A contract of life insurance is not the less such"
"","because it is for a short term."" (see- further paragraph 187 of Fuji Finance Inc v"
"Aetna Life  Ins Co Ltd [1997] Ch 173)‚Äù [Emphasis added].",""
