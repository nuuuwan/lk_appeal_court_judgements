"[58] If we interpret the legislative intent of Section 10 from its mere phraseology,"
"without considering the nature, purpose, the design, the absence of consequences"
"of non-compliance and practical impossibility, which would follow from construing"
"it  one  way  or  the  other,  it  will  tend  to  defeat  the  overall  object,  design,  the"
"purpose  and  spirit  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act. 
If  we  hold  that  the"
"determination of the Commission is null and void, it will cause serious injustice to"
"parties  who  have  no  control  over  those  entrusted  with  the  duty  of  discharging"

in  Mohideen  v.  Commissioner-General  of 
Inland"
"Revenue (supra) reads as follows:"
"“Has the Board of Review erred in law by violating the “spirit and intentions” of"
