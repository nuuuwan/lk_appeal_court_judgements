"statute. Crawford on “Statutory Construction” (Ed. 1940, Art. 261, p. 516) sets out"
"the following passage from an American case approvingly as follows:"
"""The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon"
"the  intent  of  the  legislature  and  not  upon  the  language  in  which  the  intent  is"
"clothed.  The  meaning  and  intention  of  the  legislature  must  govern,  and  these"
"are to be ascertained, not only from the phraseology of the provision, but also"
"by considering its nature, its design, and the consequences which would follow"
"from construing it the one way or the other""."
