"should have an opportunity to challenge the other impugned decisions (P14, P15, P16 and P18) in"
"respect  of  the  several  other  transactions(charges)  where  they  have  not  admitted  liability  by"
"making payments in the respective cases in the Magistrate’s Court.  Therefore, payment of due in"
"the case bearing No. 02596 in respect of order P17 does not give rise to an estoppel as claimed by"
"the Respondents. I make this observation based on the overall circumstances of this case. Hence,"
"the acceptance of liability in the case bearing No. 02596 in the Magistrate’s Court Morawaka has"
"no impediment to challenge the Petitioners the decisions reflected in the P14, P15, P16 and P18."
"Anyhow it is noted that the Petitioners are estopped from making any claims based on the reasons"
"given in this judgment for the monies already paid in case bearing No. 02596 as such aspect is"
"never subjected to within the adjudication of this case and there is no specific relief sought by the"
"Petitioners in that regard. Therefore, it establishes the element of waiver."
"Conclusion"
"Based  on  the  said  circumstances,  and  the  reasons  given  above  I  am  inclined  to  issue  a  writ  of"
"certiorari to quash the decisions of the 1st Respondent reflected in the P14, P15, P16 and P18."
"However, this order shall not stand as an impediment for the 1st Respondent to hold a fresh inquiry"
"in  terms  of  Section  66  of  the  Cooperative  Societies  Law  against  the  Petitioners  based  on  the"
"findings of the said inquiry held in terms of Section 46(1) of the Cooperative Societies Law. I order"
"no cost."
"Application is partly allowed."
