"cannot  be  treated  as  trivial;  we  cannot  justify  the  same  as  being  a  result  of  human"
"fallibility,  since  the  evidence  of  the  Prosecution  Witnesses,  when  evaluated  along  with"
"that of the Defence, does not appear to be cogent. Although keeping with the wisdom of"
"Section  134  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  there  are  judicial  dicta  that  a  single  Police"

"the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses; officials who are expected to be trained in their"
"craft,  as  opposed  to  ordinary  lay  persons  who  are  intimidated  or  overwhelmed  by  the"
"processes.  This  is  not  to  say  that  there  are  no  exceptions.  When  we  consider  these"
"contradictions, it is sufficient to reject the prosecution version as these contradictions go"
"to the root of the case."
