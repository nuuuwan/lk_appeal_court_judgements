"Heroin was residing at that location. Therefore, the question that arises is if there were"
"several people inside the house why the officers did not think to search the others?"
"According  to  the  evidence  of  PW1  (on  page  61  of  the  brief  –  proceedings  dated"
"20/10/2016)"
"“
ප්‍ර - ඒ අවස්ථාහව්දී හමාකක්ද ලැබුහන් හතාරතුර. හම් වැටලීම සම්බන්ධහයන් හමාකක්ද ලැබුන හතාරතුර?"
"උ - ස්වාමීණී, වැල්ලවත්ත, “රාජගුරු ශ්‍රී සුහබෝධි” පාහස අංක 481 දරණ නිවහස් පුද්ගලහයකු සන්තකහේ විෂ"
"මත්රවය තිහබනව කියල තමයි හතාරතුරු ලැබුහන්.”"

"“
ප්‍ර - මහත්මයා, ඔබ කිව්වා අංක 481 කියන නිවසට ගිය බව?"
"උ - එහහමයි."
"ප්‍ර - ගිහිල්ලා හමාකද කහල්?"
"උ - ස්වාමීනි, ඒ නිවසට ගිහිල්ලා නිවැසියන්ට කතා කරල ඊට පස්හස ඒ නිවස ඇතුහල් පුද්ගලහයක් හිටියා."
"හතාරතුරට අනුව එම පුද්ගලයා සැකකරු බවට සැක හිතිලා පරික්ෂා කලා”"
"The question arises without the identification of the Accused and the number of"
"people who were inside the house how PW1 spotted the Accused and arrested him."
"A  similar  circumstance  was  considered  by  his  Lordship  Sisira  De  Abrew  J.  in"
"Munasighe Arachchilage Samanalee Perera v. The Republic of Sri Lanka CA 270/2006,"
"decided on 2009-06-19. Where there were multiple individuals at the place of search and"
"only one was searched by the Police, his Lordship questioned:"
"“
If there were several women inside the house why didn’t the police officers search"
"the other women.”"
"According to PW1, they did not take steps to search the house nor around the house"
"after finding Heroin on the Accused. Therefore, it appears that upon finding  Heroin on"
"the  Accused  the  raiding  party  has  somehow  come  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is  the  only"
"amount the Accused had in possession. This again conjures up the matter of probability."
"How  likely  is  it  that  the  officers  did  not  think  to  search  the  house  of  the  Accused,  the"
"house in which the Accused was allegedly caught in possession of Heroin? How likely is it"
