"that the Accused only had the Heroin in his pocket, and the police knew not to look for"
"anymore?"
"Furthermore,  according  to  PW9,  he  along  with  Major  Peiris  came  to  surveil  a"
"person  suspected  to  have  Heroin  in  his  possession.  Yet,  when  they  came  to  know  the"
"person  is  having  Heroin  in  his  possession,  they  left  the  location  without  informing  the"
"police officers to come to the place immediately. On the other hand, the next day only they"
"went  to the Station and  informed.  It  is  highly  improbable  that  army officers who have"
"come to know of a person with drugs and identified him, leave the place, go to the police"
"station and come back to arrest. A prudent officer would have stayed at the location to"
"make sure the suspect does not leave the place. On the other hand, the Accused and his"
"witness state that the Accused was handed over to the Police by the Army Officers. It is"
"our considered view that, in the light of the Defence taken by the Accused, the story of the"
"Prosecution is improbable."
"Another point to consider is PW1’s conduct. According to PW1, he handed over the"
"production  from  the  first  arrest  and  left  to  No.  481  Rajaguru  Sri  Shubodhi  Road,"
"Wellawatta  immediately.  When  we  analyze  how  the  production  of  evidence  from  the"
"previous  arrest  was  handled,  it  is  evident  that  PW1  has  failed  to  conduct  himself"
"according to the legal requirements pertaining to the handing over of substances such as"
"Heroin and the suspect and to make entries in his notes as they left. Instead, the Heroin"
"is simply handed over to the reserve and the entry is made by PW1 only at 20.00. When"
"the question is put to him, PW1 claims that he deviated from standard procedure so that"
"he could reach the place of the Accused immediately. In contrast, it is claimed by PW1"
"before  they  left,  they  checked  both  police  and  army  vehicles  and  made  sure  nothing"
"unwarranted  was  carried  by  the  raiding  party.  The  question  here  is  whether  it  was"
"possible for a reasonable person to do all these things when he was supposedly in a rush."
"This response by PW1 seems inconsistent with his assumed urgency at the time."
"As stated by PW1 (on page 124 of the Brief – proceedings dated 03/09/2018):"
