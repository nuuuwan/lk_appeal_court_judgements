"","letter  marked  as  R2  the  said  application  made  by  the  Petitioner  was"
"","allowed.  The said fact is supported by document R4 and the annexure to"
"","R4."
"21)","Subsequently, the Petitioner had been transferred to a separate Division"
"","by  letter  R6  dated  4th  January  2021.  The  dispute  had  arisen  after  the"
"","Petitioner had been transferred to the Division referred to in letter R6."
"22)","The Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Petitioner was transferred"
"","to  a  separate  Division  which  is  completely  different  from  the  basis  on"
"","which  she  was  recruited.    However,  the  Petitioner  had  reported  to  work"
"","in the said Division and later she was restrained from reporting to work"
"","by the 15th Respondent."
"23)","However, the Senior State Counsel denied the said facts and brought the"
"","notice of attendance registers R7 and R8 that the Petitioner had failed to"
"","report to work after she was transferred."
"24)","Later, by document R10 the Respondents had held a preliminary inquiry"
"","subject  to  the  complaints  made  by  the  Petitioner  and  had  decided  to"
"","issue a charge sheet against the Petitioner."
"25)","After serving the charge sheet at the inquiry, initially the Petitioner had"
"","participated  and  later  on  the  Petitioner  had  failed  to  attend  the  said"
"","inquiry.    The  proceedings  of  the  inquiry  marked  as  R12  had  supported"
"","that position."
"26)","Based  on 
Inquiry  R12  the  Petitioner’s  service  had  been  terminated."
"","Those facts had been supported by the documents R12 to R18.  Position"
"","taken by the Counsel for the Petitioner is that the proceedings conducted"
"","at  the  inquiry  and  terminating  the  Petitioner’s  service  is  arbitrary  and"
"","illegal.    On  that  ground  the  Petitioner  has  proceeded  to  invoke  the  Writ"
"","Jurisdiction of this Court."
"27)","When  the Court questioned from the  Counsel for the Petitioner  whether"
"","the  Petitioner  had  not  sought  the  alternative  reliefs,  his  answer  was"
"","‘Petitioner could come to the Labour Tribunal or seek Writ Jurisdiction’."
