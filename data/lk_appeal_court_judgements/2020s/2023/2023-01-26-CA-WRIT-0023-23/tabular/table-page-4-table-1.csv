"bind the owner of the holding by such conditions and not by any licenced commercial"
"bank stipulated in Section 41A of the LDO."
"The  Petitioners’  further  contention  is  that  in  terms  of  Section  37  of  the  LDO  the"
"conditions included in any grant shall run with the land and shall bind the original and"
"all owners thereof and all persons whomsoever who acquire any title thereto. I take the"
"view that the Petitioners cannot maintain this argument when considering the scheme"
"of the LDO. The Section 19 of the principal enactment of LDO has been amended by"
"virtue of the Land Development (Amendment) Act No.11 of 2022. Accordingly, subject"
"to other provisions of the said Section, the approval of the Divisional Secretary also shall"
"not be required when mortgaging such holding to a licenced commercial bank, including"
"the National Development Bank."
"Although  this  amendment  was  introduced  after  the  stage  of  mortgaging  the  Land,  it"
"clearly  implies  the  policy  and  its  enactments  of  the  legislature  in  reference  to  the"

"LDO to prevent the Bank proceeding with the subject resolution passed under provisions"
"of the Act. This Court has constantly decided that it is not possible or not desirable to"
"attempt to define what facts or circumstances might have caused the defaulters to not"
"settle the loans."
"Anyhow, I need to consider whether the Petitioners are entitled to raise a claim in this"
"case  under  the  doctrine  of  proportionality  when  the  transactions  and the  relationship"
"with the Bank are completely in the contractual nature and also when the Petitioners"
"have expressly and explicitly conceded for the repercussions in an event of default."
"As per the provisions of the Agreement entered into by the Petitioners and the Bank, in"
"my  view,  the  Petitioners  are  precluded  from  taking  refuge  under  the  ‘principle  of"
