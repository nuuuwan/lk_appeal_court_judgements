"the wound as alleged by PW 01 was so serious to result in difficulties in walking and severe pain,"
"there must be in the least some  blemish or a mark of a healed wound. Therefore,  the learned"
"counsel for the appellant submits that it is evident that PW 01 had fabricated this narration about"
"a wound to bring bogus allegations against the appellant."
"PW 01 admits that according to his knowledge the appellant's wife was present in the quarters at"
"the time of the alleged incident. The evidence of PW 06, can be gathered the place shown by PW"
"01 as the place of the incident was merely covered with curtains. According to PW 01 the alleged"
"incident took place for about 5 minutes, which gives PW 01 sufficient time to protest and react to"
"the alleged action. The absence of any such reaction suggests that the alleged incident did not in"
"fact take place."
"Not only that PW 01 alleged that when he went to the Hospital it was closed. This is a government"
"hospital and no governmental hospital closes even on Poya days. There is a possibility of doctors"
"taking leave but there is at least one doctor on duty in such occasions. Besides, evidence emanates"
"from DW 01 and DW 02, who are independent witnesses, that in the event there is no doctor on"
"duty, the hospital will take necessary steps to bring down a doctor and this was facilitated by the"
"fact that the doctors' quarters were in the hospital grounds. DW 02, during cross-examination by"
"the prosecution and questions by the Judge, confirms repeatedly that no patients will be sent to"
"the  Doctors'  quarters  under  any  circumstance  and  the  procedure  is  to  bring  the  doctor  to  the"
"hospital and the hospital staff usually attend to the dressings of wounds in the ward or OPD."
"Both DW 02 and DW 05 testify that no consultations were done privately by the Doctors in their"
"quarters. This evidence goes on to show that alleged incident as narrated by PW 01 could not have"
"occurred, failing the test of probability, and affecting the credibility of PW 01's evidence."
"Learned counsel for the respondent argued that evidence of the prosecutrix does not satisfy the"
"test of spontaneity and the test of probability. In the instant case the test of spontaneity must be"
"considered on several factors. According to the Training Programme on the Treatment  of Child"
"Victims  and  Child  Witnesses  of  Crime  for  Prosecutors  and  Judges,  UNODC  those  factors  are  as"
"follows;"
