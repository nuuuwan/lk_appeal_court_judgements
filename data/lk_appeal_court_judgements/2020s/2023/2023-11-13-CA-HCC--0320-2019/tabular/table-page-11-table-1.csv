"the appellant was that there were no doctors at the hospital and they were directed to go to the"
"appellantâ€™s  bungalow.  The  government  hospitals  are  not  closed  on  holidays  and,  Chandrasiri"
"Kumara (DW 2) confirms this position in his evidence and testified that there had been no such"
"practice, procedure, or protocols to send patients to the private bungalow of the doctor, other"
"than calling the doctor to the ward in a case of an emergency. This was confirmed in the testimony"
"of DW 2, who is an independent witness and by the evidence of the wife of the appellant who is"
"also a doctor."
"According to the evidence of the prosecutrix, he was asked to lie on the medical bed and his pants"
"were removed and thereafter, his male genitalia was taken into the mouth by the appellant. This"
"version is highly improbable considering the notes of the investigating officer who had visited the"
"crime scene after one month from the date of the purported incident."
"According to the evidence of the Police, there was no such medical bed, medical instruments, or"
"medicine in the Bungalow premises where the appellant resided with his wife.  Considering the"
"absence of a bed at the place where this purported incident is said to have taken place, there is a"
"serious doubt cast on the case for the prosecution. The question arises, whether the version of"
"the prosecutrix is probable and could be upheld by a reasonably prudent person, as he testified"
"that the incident took place while he was lying on the bed. The Learned Trial Judge, in order to"
"overcome  this  issue,  mainly,  the  non-availability  of  a  bed  at  the  crime  scene,  had  arrived  at  a"
"speculative finding that, since there had been a gap from the date of the incident, to the date the"
"police had gone to visit the scene of crime, the appellant had had ample time to remove the bed"
"from  the  scene  of  crime.  This  contention  is  hypothetical,  completely  erroneous  and  had  been"
"based on pure surmises and conjectures not supported by the evidence placed before the Trial"
"Court."
"The  mother  of the  prosecutrix had  lodged  a  complaint to  the police  regarding  this  incident  on"
"16.09.2006  stating  that  the  incident  had  occurred  on  10.09.2006.  The  prosecutrix  made  his"
"statement to the police after one month, on 11.10.2006. PW3, one Dimuthu Roshan had made his"
"statement to the police after forty-nine days on 29.10.2006, from the date of the incident."
"According to the prosecution case, it was PW 4 who first got to know about this incident and who"
"had divulged this incident to the mother of the prosecutrix. Ironically, PW 4 who should have been"
"a crucial witness was not summoned as a prosecution witness. Although, she is listed as a witness"
"on the back of the indictment."
