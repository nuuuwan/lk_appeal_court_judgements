"this case the victim has given a plausible reason for the delay in making a complaint to the police."
"In fact, the evidence of the victim shows that he never intended to make a complaint about this"
"incident  to  anyone.  But  after  some  time,  due  to  circumstances  beyond  his  control  he  was"
"compelled to divulge the said incident to the police. One cannot say that the victim wanted to"
"falsely implicate the accused-appellant due to a third party's intervention."
"The learned counsel for the accused appellant argued that the trial Judge had failed to consider"
"that the version of the prosecution failed to satisfy the test of probability. The Learned Trial Judge"
"had  failed  to  properly  evaluate  the  evidence  given  by  defence  witnesses  which  creates  ample"
"doubt in the case for the prosecution. DW 02, a hospital assistant, testifies to the fact that no"
"private consultations were taken place even in emergency situations as the protocol was to call"
"the doctors and bring them in to the hospital. This is corroborated by DW 01 and DW 05."
