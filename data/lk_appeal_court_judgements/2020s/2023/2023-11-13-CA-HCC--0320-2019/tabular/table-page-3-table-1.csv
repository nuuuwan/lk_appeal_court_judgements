"According to the prosecution witnesses  on or about 10.09.2006, PW 01 went to the Gileemele"
"hospital for dressing a wound which was on his foot. He was accompanied by his cousin, PW 03,"
"up to the hospital junction. PW 01 was told by an unnamed person that the hospital was closed"
"but that he could get his wound cleaned and dressed at the appellant doctor's quarters. Following"
"this, PW 01 had gone to the residence of the appellant from the backdoor where the appellant"
"and his wife were present. He was led to a small dispensary in the house where only the doctor"
"was present. PW 01 alleges that the appellant dressed his wound, asked him to lie down on the"
"bed and checked for any moles and then removed his trousers and sucked his male genitalia. PW"
"01 further alleges that the action continued for about 5 minutes and the appellant then opened"
"the window and spat out."
"Thereafter, PW 01 paid for the dressing and immediately left the appellant's quarters. Afterwards"
"PW 01 had met PW 03 near a boutique shop and told him what happened. But had not told anyone"
"else and when PW 03 suggested they go ask the appellant about it, PW 01 had prevented PW 03"
"from doing so. PW 03 had then told of the incident to his mother, PW 04 (whose evidence was not"
"led in trial), who in turn had told this to PW 01's mother, PW 02. Thereafter PW 02 had gone to"
"the police and a formal complaint was made on 11.10.2006, a month after the alleged incident."
"At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the appellant made a dock statement and led 4 defence"
"witnesses."
