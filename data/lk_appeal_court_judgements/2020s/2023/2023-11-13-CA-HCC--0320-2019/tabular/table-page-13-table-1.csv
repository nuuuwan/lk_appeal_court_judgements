"In the statement made by the mother of the Prosecutrix, she complained about an act, ""touching"
"the genital area"", of the Prosecutrix. She did not say anything about taking the male genitalia of"
"the  Prosecutrix  into  the  mouth  of  the  Appellant.  The  mother  was  confronted  with  her  first"
"statement to the police and this was brought to the notice of the Learned Trial Judge. Not calling"
"PW 4 as the first person who received this information is fatal to the conviction and the provisions"
"under the evidence Ordinance - Section 114(f) would operate against the prosecution. In light of"
"the above-said contradiction, it is emanating from the evidence of the prosecution, that the ""act"""
"first complained of, by the mother to the police and the act of grave sexual abuse stipulated in the"
"indictment  are  two  different  acts.  That  shows  the  inconsistency  between  the  evidence  of  the"
"Prosecutrix  and  the  mother.  The  finding  of  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  is that  the  evidence  of the"
"Prosecutrix is consistent with his mother and is corroborated. However, such finding is ex facie"
"wrong and erroneous in light of the evidence that has been led at the trial."
"When considering the medical evidence and according to the short history given to the doctor,"
"the incident had occurred about a month prior to the said medical examination. However, in the"
"short history, the Prosecutrix referred to the wound that he wanted to get dressed on that day."
"Judicial Medical Officers examine patients referred to them based on the short history given in"
"order to ascertain whether such short history is compatible with the physical examination.  The"
"Judicial Medical Officer, after examining the prosecutrix, he had observed no blemish, no mark,"
"no healed  wound  marks  on  the dorsum of  the  right foot of  the Prosecutrix.  Even under  cross-"
"examination, the Judicial Medical Officer was categorical on this point. On the contrary, the short"
"history given by the prosecutrix to the Judicial Medical Officer reveals that there were in existence"
"blemishes, marks, or healed wounds on the dorsum of the right foot."
"It is obvious that the version of the prosecutrix is not credible and contradicted by the medical"
"evidence.  According  to  the  evidence  of  the  PW  1,  the  Prosecutrix  had  a  wound  on  the  upper"
"surface  or  dorsum  of  his  right  foot  and  he  treated  it  at  home,  two  to  three  days  prior  to  the"
"incident. The Prosecutrix wanted to get it treated and dressed from the hospital, he joined PW 3"
"Dimuthu Roshan in order to go to the Hospital. As the Prosecutrix described in his evidence, he"
"could not keep his foot on the floor and walk properly and he was limping. After one month when"
"he was examined by the Judicial Medical Officer, there was no such healed injury or a blemish on"
"his skin to show that his wound had been so severe."
"Considering the totality of all the  above-mentioned circumstances, the learned counsel for the"
"accused appellant submitted that neither the conviction nor the sentence in this matter could be"
"sustained in law and therefore, to acquit the Appellant from the charges levelled against him."
"Lack of animosity between the victim's family and the accused is another important ground which"
"was  raised  by  the  accused-appellant.  Victim  specifically  states  that  there  was  no  animosity"
"between  the  accused  or  family  of  accused  and  the  family  of  the  victim.  On  behalf  of  the"
"respondent learned counsel indicates that no suggestion whatsoever that the alleged incident was"
"fabricated  due  to  influence  of  a  third  party  was  suggested  to  the  victim  in  cross  examination."
"Therefore,  the  defence  of  animosity  of  third  party  and  fabrication  was  an  afterthought  placed"
"before court after the evidence of the victim was concluded. No suggestion was made that the"
"victim was giving false evidence on any point whatsoever when the victim was cross examined."
"Although  it  was  suggested  on  behalf  of  the  defence  that  the  victim  fabricated  the  incident  of"
"sexual abuse made to the mother of the victim, it was categorically denied by the mother of the"
"victim. It was suggested to the police witness that the 1st complainant mother of the victim came"
