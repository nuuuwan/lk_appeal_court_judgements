"and the need decided the urgency.” Therefore, as explained above, sufficient reasons exist"
"to come to the conclusion that there is an urgent requirement for the subject acquisition"
"to take place. The Petitioners failed to effectively challenge the above circumstances which"
"were based on urgency. Therefore, I am of the view that the authorities have submitted"
"satisfactory  grounds  for a  requirement  of  urgency  to  take  immediate  possession  of  the"
"land. The Petitioners have failed to establish sufficiently that there was no urgency. Their"
"main argument is the failure to consider the existence of alternative lands. Therefore, I am"
"unable to accept the position that there are no satisfactory grounds for taking immediate"
"possession of the land under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Act."
"suitability"
"The Petitioners further claim that the urgency is not the only factor that needs to be proved"
"under said proviso if the Minister declares immediate possession, necessity and suitability"
"also need to be proved before making the decision under proviso to Section 38 of the Act"
"as decided in the CA (Writ) Application No. 387/2017. The Petitioners claim that the land"
"which is to be acquired is not the most suitable land for the relocation of the weekly fair"
"and alternative lands including several lands owned by the state in the vicinity have not"
"been considered. Nevertheless, after the institution of this application, a field visit and an"
"investigation have been conducted by the 2nd, 4th and other authorities to determine the"
"suitability of the alternative lands including the questioned land [documents 2R7(1) and"
"2R7(ii)].  During  that  field 
investigation,  two 
lands  owned  by  the  National  Livestock"
"Development  Board,  as  mentioned 
in  the  Petitioner's  Petition,  were  also  taken 
into"
"consideration.  In  the  report  [2R7(1)  and  2R7(ii)],  the  Respondents  have  justified  their"
"request for acquiring the disputed land by stating that it is suitable for connecting with the"
"remaining portion of land, which was used for the weekly fair, and avoiding the acquisition"
"of any constructions situated in the land."
"The Petitioner’s claim that a weekly fair, solely conducted during the weekend, would have"
"such a severe impact on the functioning of the government school in the vicinity seems"
"unfounded. Furthermore, the Petitioners also claim that relocating the fair closer to the"
"main road would cause heavy traffic congestion. However, it must also be observed that"
"relocating the weekly fair to a remote and inaccessible location would entirely defeat the"
"purpose of holding the fair in the first place."
"In the instant case, the Petitioners seek a writ of prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent"
"from acquiring the land in issue. The order under proviso (a) to Section 38 has not been"
"issued yet. The Petitioners' concern is that the ongoing acquisition process may lead to the"
"actual  acquisition  under  said  proviso.  However,  as  mentioned  before,  authorities  have"
"satisfactorily set out the requirement for urgency. It is the duty of the Minister to consider"
"the directions and requests of the authorities and then to make an appropriate order under"
"said proviso. The ruling of this Court should not be an impediment to making such a well-"
