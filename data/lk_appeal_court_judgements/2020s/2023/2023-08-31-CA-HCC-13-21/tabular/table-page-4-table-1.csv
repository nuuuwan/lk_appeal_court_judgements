"According to PW1, two days before the incident, the Deceased had informed him of an"
"unresolved  dispute  between  the  Deceased  and  the  Accused  that  escalated  into  a  physical"
"altercation.  During  his  cross-examination,  PW1  revealed  that  the  Deceased's  residence  is"
"located 50 meters from his own home. He elaborated that the conflict between Ajith and his"
"brother  remained  unresolved  and  had  been  ongoing.  He  also  indicated  that  the  distance"
"between the toilet and the kitchen in the Deceased's house was approximately 15 feet, and"

"proceeded to the toilet to wash his hands, which she stated was approximately 10 to 12 feet"
"from  the  kitchen.  Subsequent  to  hearing  a  gunshot  accompanied  by  smoke,  her  husband"
"rushed  back  into  the  house  proclaiming  that  he  had  been  shot  by  Ajith.  He  was  visibly"
"bleeding and collapsed onto the kitchen floor. Before collapsing, he told PW2 that it was Ajith"
"who had shot him."
