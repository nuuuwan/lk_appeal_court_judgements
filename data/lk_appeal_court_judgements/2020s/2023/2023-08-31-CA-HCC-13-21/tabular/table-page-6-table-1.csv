"PW2 maintained that she had successfully identified the Accused fleeing the scene, as he had"
"been a frequent visitor to their house prior to these events. When the Defense suggested that"
"trees near the toilet could have obstructed her view, she refuted the claim."
"PW4, Katapodi Kankanamge Suseema Priyangika (Sister of the Deceased), testified"
"that a few days before the incident, the Deceased had informed her during a visit to her house"
"that he had an unresolved dispute with the Accused, who had threatened to kill him. She"
"added that the Accused's residence was situated six to seven houses away from theirs."
"In her cross-examination, PW4 revealed that she had reported the Accused's threat to"
"kill her brother to the police. She noted that upon hearing the gunshot, she immediately went"
"to her brother's house, located 170 feet from her own. She admitted to having no recollection"
"of the events that transpired subsequently, as she was emotionally disturbed and therefore"
"not in a state to notice details. She confirmed that both her brother and sister-in-law were"
"unconscious at that time."
