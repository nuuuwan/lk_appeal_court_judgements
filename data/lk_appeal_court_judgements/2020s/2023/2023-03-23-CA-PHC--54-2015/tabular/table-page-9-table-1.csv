"When  interpreting  the  word  ‘premises’  indicated  in  Section  18A  (2),  it  is  plausible  to"
"apply the purposive rule of interpretation, which provides for an interpretation which"
"gives effect to the purpose of the statute, where the alternative interpretation frustrates"
"the purpose of the statutory provision."
"As held in the case of Priyavarte Mehta Vs. Amrendu Banerjee [1997] AIHC 4292;"
