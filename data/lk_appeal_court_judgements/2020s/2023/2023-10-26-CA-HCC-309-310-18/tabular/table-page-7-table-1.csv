"observed that the evidence had been uncontradicted and consistent. We too"
"observe that it is so."
"Hence the surrounding circumstances of the facts at the scene of crime can"
"be  concluded  only  by 
finding 
the 
two  appellants  guilty  of 
the  charge"
"possession.  The  defense  although  had  made  a  valiant  effort  in  trying  to"
"challenge the evidence of the prosecution by cross examination and by their"
"statements form the dock , the evidence of the defense has only substantiated"
"the evidence of the prosecution."
"Therefore, the trial judge is correct in finding the two appellants guilty for the"
"possession of heroin at the time of arrest. But it appears that in the charge it"
"had not said specifically that the two appellants jointly possessed the heroin."
"It is the opinion of this Court that it is not necessary to say so  specifically"
"because we find that when two accused persons are charged under section"
"32  of  the  Penal  Code  it  is  not  stated  in  the  charge  specifically  that  it  is  so"
"because it is implied and it is up to the prosecution to prove that they were"
"in joint possession through evidence emanating from their actions and words."
"As  such  in  the  instant  matter  the  two  appellants  had  been  found  to  be"
"together in a very small compound surrounded by instruments and utensils"
"which facilitated their act of packeting the substance which later proved to"
"be heroin. Hence the only irresistible conclusion that can be drawn is that"
"they  were  in  joint  possession  of  the  alleged  heroin.  Hence,  we  are  of  the"
"opinion  that  the  finding  of  the  trial  judge  with  regard  to  the  possession  of"
"heroin against the appellants is justified and we affirm the same."
"Hence  then the question arises as to why the  trial  judge had  acquitted the"
"two appellants from the charge of trafficking."
"It  has  been  held  in  the  case  of  The  Attorney  General  vs  Mohamed  Iqbal"
"Mohamed Sadath SC Special LA 58 of 2003 by Aluvihare J that,"
"“Since  possession  and  trafficking  can  look  the  same  at  first  glance,"
"prosecution 
for 
trafficking 
typically 
requires  producing  additional"
"circumstantial evidence to indicate that the accused was in possession"
"of drugs not for personal use but for commercial purposes. The quantity"
"of the drugs detected would be a good indicator to decide whether the"
"perpetrator is a user or is trading drugs.”"
"In the instant matter the amount taken in to custody is 122.68 grammes and"
"the  tools  which  were  taken  in  to  custody  at  the  time  of  the  detection  also"
"proves beyond a reasonable doubt that that the appellants were in the process"
"of trafficking the narcotics as well."
