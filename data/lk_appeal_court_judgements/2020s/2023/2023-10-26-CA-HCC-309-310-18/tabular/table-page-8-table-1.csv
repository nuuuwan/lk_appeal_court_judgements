"As such we are of the opinion that the trial judge has erred in acquitting the"
"two  appellants  from  the  charge  of  trafficking  as  such,  we  set  aside  the"
"acquittal entered by the trial judge for the charge of trafficking and we convict"
"the two appellants for the charge of trafficking and pass the sentence of life"
"imprisonment and affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial"
"judge for the charge of possession."
"As such we see no merit in the submission of the Counsel for appellants and"
"as such the appeals of the two appellants are hereby dismissed."
