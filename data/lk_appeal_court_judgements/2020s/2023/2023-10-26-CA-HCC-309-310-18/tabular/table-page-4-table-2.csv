"This court also observes that these much referred contradictions are,"
"1.  PW1  has  referred  to  the  jewelry  shop  in  which  they  had  weighed  the"
"productions to be as Vogue Jewelers but PW3 had said as Noor Jewelers"
"and this we think is a typographical error and nothing more."
"2.  PW1 had said that the place of incident had been Terrance Silva Mawatha"
"Dematagoda, but whereas PW3 had said it to be Gerens Silva place which"
"again we see as a typographical error."
"3.  PW1 had said at one point that he put all 20 bags of heroin in to a colorless"
"bag but latter he had said it to be a pink colored bag, this also we as a"
"minor  and  frivolous  and  un-important  discrepancy.  As  such  we  see  no"
"merit in this submission also."
