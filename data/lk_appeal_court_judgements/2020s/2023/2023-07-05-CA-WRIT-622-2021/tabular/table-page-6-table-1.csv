"outcomes  is  notoriously  difficult  and  she  has  identified  three  important  mechanisms  of"
"influence: (a) disruption, (b) facilitation and (c) persuasion.1"
"The task of this Court at this juncture is not to examine the legitimacy of the purported public"
"outcry but to assay whether such public protest is reasonable enough, in line with the above"
"concepts on public protest, to effect a policy change by the Pradeshiya Sabha. It is important"
"to note that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have not submitted any evidence in respect of the"
"nature or the behaviour of the alleged public protest which has taken place and this Court is"
"unable to ascertain whether such protests attract the mechanisms identified above. Similarly,"
"such Respondents have not made an application to this Court in order to add any parties to"
"enable this Court to consider the grievances of a particular group of protestors. It can be clearly"
"assumed according to pleadings that the alleged public protest was not against any decision"
"of the 1st and 2nd Respondents but perhaps to persuade the Petitioners not to sell the subject"
"land to a third person. In other words, it was not to facilitate the Pradeshiya Sabha to change"
"its’ previous decision to permit subdivision of the subject land although the Pradeshiya Sabha"
"has  suspended  its  original  decision  on  the  pretext  of  the  purported  public  protest.  It  is"
"paramount  that  the  Land  Commissioner  General  has  specifically  declared  that  the  subject"
"land can be considered private land."
"It is obvious that the original decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents permitting the subdivision"
"is not under judicial review in the instant Application and the Petitioners have sought judicial"
"review only against the decision to suspend the original decision which permitted subdivision."
"The 1st and 2nd Respondents have not pleaded that the said original decision permitting the"
"subdivision had been made by mistake or erroneously. In my view, public protest should not"
"be used as a persuasion power to change a legitimate policy or a lawful decision unless the"
"true  grievance  of  the  protestors  will  be  established  with  satisfactory  or  acceptable  reasons"
"before this Court. The pleadings of the Petitioners illustrate the potential pitfalls of varying"
"the original decision by the Pradeshiya Sabha on a finding of clear inconsistency. The 1st and"
"2nd Respondents have failed in crafting a legitimate defence against the Petitioners based on"
"the  purported  public  protest  to  vary  their  original  decision  which  permitted  the  respective"
"1 Article titled 'People protest for many reasons, yet we don’t know how effective protests are'"
