"Mesurier  case  has  no  application  to  the  marriage  contracted  by  the  plaintiff-petitioner  in  the"
"present case.”"
"The decision in the above Asokan Nee Kandasamy case provokes the question as to whether a"
"marriage entered in Sri Lanka can be dissolved in “some competent court” outside Sri Lanka,"
"as it determines that divorce jurisdiction is exercisable by the Sri Lankan courts irrespective"
"of the place where the marriage was contracted. Now I must advert to the below vital critiques"
"on  divorce  laws  of  Sri  Lanka,  made  by  Shirani  Ponnambalam  in  “Law  and  the  Marriage"
"Relationship in Sri Lanka” 2nd Revised Edition, Lake House Investments Ltd, pp. 304 to 311."
