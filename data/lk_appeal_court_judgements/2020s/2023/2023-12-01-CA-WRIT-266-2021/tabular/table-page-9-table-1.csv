"reasonable period of time when applying for a divorce. Thirdly, I take the view that both the"
"husband and wife should actively participate in such divorce proceedings in a foreign court"
"while being subjected to the procedure adopted in such court concerning matrimonial actions."
"I have taken the initiative to provide the above three guidelines in order to avoid either of the"
"parties being deprived of any right that they derived from the registration of their marriage"
"under  the  said  Ordinance  in  Sri  Lanka.  For  the  reasons  set  out  above,  a  valid  decree  of"
"dissolution of marriage entered into in a foreign country can be given effect, when necessary,"
"within Sri Lanka, subject to other laws of this country and the above guidelines formulated"
"by  me.  I  am  convinced  that  the  Petitioner  and  the  3rd  Respondent  have  fulfilled  all  of  the"
"above necessary criteria when obtaining their decree of divorce in England."
"Hence, the final issue that remains is whether the Petitioner is entitled to a mandate in the"
"nature  of  a  writ  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  decision  reflected  in  the  impugned  document"
"marked 'A12'. Based on my findings above, I cannot agree with the opinion of the Registrar"
"that the Petitioner ought to obtain a divorce decree after instituting a divorce action in a court"
"in  Sri  Lanka  at  a  time  where  the  vinculo  matrimonii  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  3rd"
"Respondent have been dissolved by a competent court in England. Thus, in no way can it be"
"assumed that it is lawful for the Petitioner to institute another divorce case in Sri Lanka as"
"erroneously recommended by the Registrar since the Petitioner has already entered into his"
"second contract of marriage in Thailand. Therefore, I hold that the document marked 'A12'"
"should be quashed."
"Having considered the main question of law, what remains to be examined is whether a duty"
"has been cast upon the Registrar in terms of the said Ordinance in Sri Lanka to place on record"
"in the relevant register about any divorce of a vinculo matrimonii declared by a local or foreign"
"court of law by invalidating/removing the entry of such marriage  initially registered in Sri"
"Lanka. Although I am unaware of any extraneous arrangements made between the Registrar"
"and the Registrars of District Courts, in reference to divorce decrees, I need to stress that there"
"doesn't appear to be any express provision in the said Ordinance that bound the Registrar to"
"execute such a duty whenever a District Court of Sri Lanka issues a divorce decree. Therefore,"
"I am unable to grant any of the mandates in the nature of writs of Mandamus as prayed for"
"in the prayer of the Petition. Nevertheless, my determination should not be an impediment"
