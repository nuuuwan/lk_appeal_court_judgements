"When the C.I.D. Officer S.I. Kohona gave evidence regarding the contents of the"
"file  containing  පැ5  documents,  he  had  produced  in  evidence  a  letter  marked"
"පැ5b which is a letter sent by the Manager of the Tissamaharama branch of the"
"People’s  Bank  to  the  Manager  of  the  Plaintiff’s  Company  Sanasuma  Holiday"
"Resort (Ltd) requesting the company to furnish details of their accounts. That is"
"not a letter sent by the bank to the Plaintiff’s company asking the company to"
"pay the arrears that are due to the bank. That is the original document of the"
"letter  sent  to  the  Plaintiff’s  company  which  had  been  returned  to  the  bank"
"undelivered with the endorsement on the cover - සේථානය හැර ෆගාසේ. That cover"
"with the endorsement has been marked as P5d. The office copy of that letter"
"which  is  in  the  bank  file  has  been  marked  as  P5c.  In  the  newspaper  article"
"marked පැ1, there is a reference to a letter sent by the bank to the Plaintiff’s"
"company  which  had  been 
returned 
to 
the  bank  undelivered  with 
the"
"endorsement සේථානය හැර ෆගාසේ ඇත."
"A letter sent by the witness Hettiarachchi, a former Deputy General Manager of"
"the 1st Defendant bank, on behalf of the 1st Defendant bank to the plaintiff had"
"been marked as පැ16. In that document there are particulars of a loan that the"
"plaintiff  had  obtained  from  the  Kollupitiya  branch  of  the  1st  Defendant  bank."
"Those details cannot be available in the Tissamaharama branch as that branch"
"had nothing to do with that loan. There is no reference to those particulars in"
"the newspaper article marked පැ1."
"Those facts are consistent with the version of the Plaintiff that the 2nd Defendant"
"had provided that information to the newspaper."
"The  file  containing  the  particulars  of  the  bank  accounts  of  the  plaintiff’s"
"company was in the custody of the 2nd Defendant and those particulars could"
"not  have  gone  out  without  the  knowledge  and  the  participation  of  the  2nd"
"Defendant."
"In cross examination it has been suggested to the plaintiff that the Plaintiff had"
"in his office, several files containing particulars of these loan transactions and it"
"has been suggested that some of the files were in the custody of one Jeewan"
"Rajaratnam- an employee of the plaintiff who had later left the services of the"
"plaintiff.  The 
line  of  cross  examination  was 
to  show 
that 
the  “Ravaya”"
"newspaper could have obtained these particulars of the loan transactions from"
"the plaintiff’s office or from Jeewan Rajaratnam who had left the services of the"
"Plaintiff. As Rajaratnam had left the services after falling out with the plaintiff"
"and 
in  displeasure  there  was  a  tendency 
in  Rajaratnam  to 
leak  out  this"
