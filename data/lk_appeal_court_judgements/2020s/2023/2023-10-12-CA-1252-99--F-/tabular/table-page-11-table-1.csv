"bank is a corporate body established under the People’s Bank Act No. 29 of 1961"
"and it is highly improbable that the governing body of the bank – the Chairman"
"and the Board of Directors would have such a personal interest in the affairs of"
"the bank. There is no benefit that they could accrue by publishing internal affairs"
"of the bank. On the other hand, the 2nd Defendant who is a minor official of the"
"bank had the opportunity of accruing a benefit by passing this information to"
"the newspaper."
"Under the provisions of Section 77 of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 the 2nd"
"Defendant  who  was  the  Manager  of  the  Tissamaharama  branch  of  the  1st"
"Defendant  bank  was  under  a  statutory  duty  to  the  customers  of  the  1st"
"Defendant bank to observe strict secrecy in respect of all the transactions and"
"matters relating to and connected with the transactions of the bank. Therefore,"
"the 2nd Defendant was under a similar statutory duty to observe strict secrecy"
"connected  with  accounts  No.  1215,  1416  and  PDL  127  maintained  by  the"
"Plaintiff’s company and the 2nd Defendant was under the duty not to reveal or"
"release or disclose to any persons regarding the transactions or the contents of"

"page no. 377 state as follows;"
"“An employer will only be responsible for torts committed by their employees if"
"those torts are committed in the course of the employment, rather than, as the"
"courts have put it, when the employee is on a “frolic of his own”. The traditional"
"test for whether an act is committed in the course of employment was taken"
"from  the  classic  textbook  on  tort,  Salmond  on  Torts,  first  published  in  1907."
"Salmond stated that a wrongful act would be classified as done in the course of"
"employment"
"If it is either (a) a wrongful act authorized by the master (the old-fashioned legal"

"act authorized by the master."
"This means that the employer will be liable not only where they have permitted"
"the employee to do the wrongful act, but also in some cases where they have"
"not given such permission. This will be the case where the wrongful act is so"
