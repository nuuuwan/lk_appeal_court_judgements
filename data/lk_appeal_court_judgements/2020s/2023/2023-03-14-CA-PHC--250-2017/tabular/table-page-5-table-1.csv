"Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  learned  Magistrate  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  and"
"determine the instant case under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"The rationale underlying the above is in view of section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance"
"which  states  “Courts  will  have 
to  presume 
that 
Judicial  Acts  have  been  regularly"
"performed”. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge has been correct when he decided"
"by his order dated 30.11.2017 that the learned Magistrate has jurisdiction to hear and"
"determine the instant case. The learned High Court Judge further had ordered the learned"
"Primary Court Judge to inquire into the said case bearing No. 51274/L and to make an"
"appropriate order."
"In such a situation, it is a duty of the learned Primary Court Judge who was holding the"
"inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the land in dispute on the date on"
"which information was filed under Section 68(1) of the Act and make an order as to who"
"is entitled to possession  of the  land in dispute.  Moreover, if the  Primary Court Judge is"
"satisfied  that  any  person  who  had  been  in  possession  of  the  disputed  land  has  been"
"dispossessed  within  a  period  of  two  months  immediately  before  the  date  on  which  the"
"information was filed, the learned Primary Court Judge may make a determination to that"
"effect and make an order directing the party dispossessed be restored to possession and"
"prohibit all disturbances of such possession otherwise than under the authority of an order"
"or decree of a competent Court."
"In this instance, it is submitted that the intention of the Legislature in introducing Part VII"
"of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 is to prevent a breach of peace and"
"not to embark on a protracted trial. That is precisely the reason why, Section 67(1) of the"
"Primary Courts’ Procedure Act has given a three-month and one week period for a matter"
"to be concluded."
"As  the  information  in  the  instant  action  was  filed  on  19.11.2012  under  the  Section"
"66(1)(b) of the Act which is almost 10 years ago, we direct the learned Magistrate/Primary"
"Court Judge to decide the matter  within a period of three months from the date of this"
"Judgment,  based  on  available  material  such  as    affidavits,  counter  affidavits,  annexed"
"documents,  complaints, 
statements  made  by  parties 
to 
the  Police  Station,  written"
"submissions, and the order made by the Learned High Court judges."
