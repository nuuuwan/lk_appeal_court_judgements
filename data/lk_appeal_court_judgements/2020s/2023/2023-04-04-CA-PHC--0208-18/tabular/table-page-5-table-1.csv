"was given ample opportunity to adduce evidence to establish that the  impugned structure was"
"built prior to the appointed date. However, multiple affidavits submitted on behalf of the Appellant"
"and  other  such  evidence  adduced  by  the  Appellant  does  not  indicate  the  date  in  which  the"
"structure was built. Therefore, considering all of the above evidence, learned Magistrate has come"
"to a correct find of fact and law and concluded that the impugned building was built after the Act"
"has come into force."
"In view of the aforementioned reasons it is apparent that the Appellant had not substantiated his"
"contentions for this court to interfere with the orders of the learned High Court Judge as well as"
"the learned Magistrate. Hence, the learned Magistrate had correctly made the order to demolish"
"the impugned construction."
"Since the Appellant has constructed the impugned building in contravention of section 42(3) of"
"the Thoroughfares Act no. 40 of 2008, I hold that the said construction is unauthorised thus the"
"learned magistrate had exercised jurisdiction within the purview of the power conferred to him"
"in terms of the provisions in the Thoroughfares act no 40 of 2008"
"Hence, the learned Magistrate had rightly made an order to demolish the impugned construction."
"The learned High Court Judge too affirmed the order dated 17.06.2016 of the learned Magistrate"
"and  held  that  no  exceptional  circumstances  exist  for  the  Appellant  to  invoke  the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction of the High Court."
"As such we see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate dated 17.06.2016"
"and the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 06.12.2018"
"Hence, we dismiss this appeal with costs."
