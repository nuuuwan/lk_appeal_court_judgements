"the  mind  of  a  candidate  who  is  likely  under  pressure  to  complete  the  paper  within  the"
"stipulated  time.  The  Respondents  have  failed  to  defend  the  allegations  that  no  School"
"Examination  Advisory  Committee  was  appointed  nor  have  they  provided  a  reasonable"
"explanation for their inadvertence."
"Anyhow, the Respondents assert that if the relief sought by the Petitioner is granted, the 3rd"
"Respondent  would  be  compelled  to  appoint  an  entirely  new  panel  of  paper  setters  and"
"moderators, which may result in the appointment of such paper setters and moderators who"
"have no experience in paper setting. The Respondents further argue that the candidates who"
"would answer the question papers in the subject of chemistry at G.C.E. (A/L) Examinations"
"would be greatly prejudiced if the reliefs sought by the Petitioner is granted. It is contended"
"that only 8 out of the 9 members, who were part of the panel of paper setters for the G.C.E."
"A/L chemistry paper for the year 2020, were re-appointed for the year 2021. Accordingly, the"
"panel of paper setters for the year 2021 consisted of 11 members, including 3 newly appointed"
"members. It is further submitted that a new moderator was appointed for the G.C.E. A/L"
"chemistry paper for the year 2021 and as such, the moderator who functioned in 2020 was"
"not re-appointed. This Court is not possessed with the reason behind the above changes and"
"perhaps it is due to the requirement of maintaining the secrecy of the identities of the panel of"
"paper setters and moderators."
"For the reasons explained above and on an overall consideration of the circumstances of this"
"case, I am compelled to take the view that this Court, unless it is highly essential, should not"
"interfere in the process of setting question papers in A/L Examinations as it would affect the"
"sanctity of such competitive examinations. The thrust of the Petitionerâ€™s case is not on the"
"usual  grounds  of  review,  but  on  the  necessity  of  taking  punitive  measures  to  prevent  the"
"recurrence  of  errors  in  question  papers  as  averred  by  the  Petitioner.  According  to  the"
"Petitioner, not allowing the same examiners to continue to be on future panels of paper setters"
"and moderators is an essential step in order to ensure that the candidates will not be similarly"
"prejudiced in the future. I am reluctant to interfere with the process of setting the chemistry"
"paper  as  such  a  process  demands  a  high  degree  of  secrecy  within  it  and  also  due  to  the"
"unavailability  of  adequate  material  before  Court  to  overcome  the  state  of  institutional"
"incapacity in relation to the expert knowledge of this Court on the subject of chemistry. I do"
