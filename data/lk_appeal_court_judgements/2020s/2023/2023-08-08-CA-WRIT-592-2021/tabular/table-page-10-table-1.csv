"Even in an event this Court decides to accept the position that the said chemistry paper is"
"flawed by containing erroneous questions, it cannot be assumed that the Petitioner is entitled"
"to the reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the Petition in the same way such reliefs have been"
"formulated.  This  is  because  this  Court  should  take  serious  cognizance  of  the  fact  that  the"
"candidates have been allocated additional and reasonable marks according to a fresh marking"
"scheme prepared as a result of the deliberation and decisions reflected in 'R7'. Also, it is noted"
"that there is no single complaint from any of the candidates who sat the said chemistry paper"
"or from any other student who is to face future A/L chemistry examinations. In this vein, the"
"standing  of

"can  use  a  reasonable  ground  of  review  to  usurp  the  power  of  the  1st,  2nd,  3rd  and  5th"
"Respondents.  Anyhow,  based  on 
the 
findings 
illustrated  earlier, 
this  Court  makes  an"
"observation  that  it  is  the  duty  of  the  Commissioner  of  Examination  and  other  relevant"
"authorities to conduct an appropriate inquiry, preserving the secrecy of the process and take"
"appropriate decisions in respect of the paper setters and the moderators of the chemistry paper"
"for  the  best  interest  of  the  candidates  who  sit  future  A/L  Examinations.  Anyhow,  for  the"
