"knowledge that he will have to face charges either in the Magistrate Court or in"
"the High Court depending on the report of the Government Analyst. That was"
"the very reason why he had to appear before the Magistrate Court over several"
"dates after he was released on bail. If the case was not duly called on the 17-03-"
"2006 as claimed by the accused, it was his duty to inquire in that regard as he"
"would have been the person affected."
"As  correctly  viewed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the  accused  has  never"
"taken up the position that he went to the Court on the 17th of March, which was"
"his duty as a law-abiding citizen, and the case was not called on that day and"

"As observed by the learned High Court Judge even for the  persons who stood"
"surety  for  the  accused,  his  whereabouts  were  unknown.  One  surety  has  been"
"sentenced to a jail term because of his failure to pay the fine imposed on him for"
