"particular incident.  If their evidence consists inter se or per se contradictions"
"and which affects the root of the case, their credibility become questionable."
"The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 265-266 held that"
"the evidence given by PW1 and PW2 sans any contradiction in their evidence."
"The relevant portion is re-produced below:"
"(Pages 265-266 of the brief.)"

"The above highlighted portion in the judgment is a clear indication that the"
"Learned High Court had not considered and analysed the evidence given by"
"PW1 and PW2 properly."
"According to PW1, he had received a specific information that a person called"
"Himash and a lady called Jayanthi were involved in selling drugs at a place"
"called Sinna Dupatha."
"But PW2, in his evidence categorically said that he was unaware about the"
"identity  of  the  persons  until  he  was  directed  to  enter  Jayanthi’s  house."
"Hence,  the  Counsel  submits  that  this  leads  to  serious  doubt  about  the"
"happening of the incident as described by the witnesses."
"Next  the  Counsel  argued  that  although  a  specific  information  had  been"
"received  about  involvement  of  a  female called  Jayanthi,  PW1  had  failed  to"
"include a female police officer to the team. Hence, she further argues that"
"the incident described by PW1 and PW2 fail the test of probability."
"Probability test is a prerequisite in criminal trials to prove the case beyond"
"reasonable  doubt.  In  this  case  the  conduct  of  PW1  is  highly  questionable"
"which certainly not pass the probability test."
