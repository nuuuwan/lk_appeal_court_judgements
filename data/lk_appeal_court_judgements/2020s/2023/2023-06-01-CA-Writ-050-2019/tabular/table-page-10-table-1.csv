"In the case of Samaraweera v. People’s Bank and others3 her Ladyship Dr."
"Shirani  Bandaranayake  J.,  (as  her  Ladyship  then  was)  cited  the  following"
"extract from Wade4; ‘a right to reasons is, therefore, an indispensable part of"
"a sound system of judicial review. Natural justice may provide the best rubric"
"for it, since the giving of reasons is required by the ordinary man’s sense of"
