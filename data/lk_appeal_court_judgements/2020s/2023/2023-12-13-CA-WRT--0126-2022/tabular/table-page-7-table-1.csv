"CA/HCC/126/2022"
"Appellant ordered to stop the bike which defy their orders the Appellant with"
"best of his ability tried to stop the motorbike but unfortunately bullets struck"
"the deceased. It is pertinent to note that when the Appellant signalled  the"
"rider to stop the bike, rider had driven the bike forward non-stop. Both PW1"
"and  the  Appellant  had  seen  an  object  resembled  to  a  gun  was  on  the"
"motorbike. At this point the intense suspicion led the Appellant to shoot at"
"the bike to stop it. Further the road is in a declining angle and according to"
"the investigating officer it is very difficult to take aim at that place."
"PW2 admitted that a large umbrella was on the lap of the deceased at the"
"time of the incident. According to PW1 and the Appellant they had seen an"
"object similar to a gun was carried on the motor bike."
"Under these circumstances, evaluating the evidence under the 4th limb of the"
"Section 294 of the Penal Code, I consider, is not appropriate."
"The Appellant, being a police officer caried out his duties as directed, and"
"that he did not have any intention of shooting the deceased. The Appellant"
"in  his  dock  statement  clearly  stated  under  what  circumstances  he  had"
"opened fire at the motorbike."
"Considering  the  appeal  ground  advanced  by  the  Appellant  and  all  the"
"circumstances  of  this  case,  it  is  quite  appropriate  that  this  matter  should"
"have  been  considered  under  section  69  of  the  Penal  Code.  The  Appellant"
"should have been awarded the benefit under the said section. The Learned"
"High  Court  Judge  ought  not  have  come  to  a  finding  of  guilt  against  the"
"Appellant."
"Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that"
"this  is  an  appropriate  case  to  consider  for  the  Appellantâ€™s  benefit,  his"
"entitlement under Section 69 of Penal Code;"
