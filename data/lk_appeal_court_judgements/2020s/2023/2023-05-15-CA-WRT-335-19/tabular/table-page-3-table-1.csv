"T
he Petitioner, after having completed his G.C.E. Advance Level Examination in"
"2016, applied to the University of Vocational Technology (hereinafter referred to"
"as the “UNIVOTECH), Ocean University of Sri-Lanka to study for the Bachelor of"
"Technology 
in  Manufacturing  Technology  and 
to 
the  University  Grants"
"Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “UGC”). By letter dated 13-03-2017"
"(P4a),  the  Petitioner  was  called  for  an  interview  by  the  UNIVOTECH,  and"
"accordingly, the former participated in the interview on 23-03-2017 but failed to"
"submit his school leaving certificate along with other required documents as the"
"same  was  already  submitted  to  the  UGC.  As  per  the 
letter  marked  P4a,"
"submission  of  the  school  leaving  certificate  is  mandatory  for  registration.  The"
"Petitioner states that his registration at the UNIVOTECH could not be completed"
"as he failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of submitting the school"
"leaving certificate."
"Thereafter, the UGC, by letter dated 26-10-2017 (P5c), selected the Petitioner for"
"the  Applied  Science 
(Physical  Science)  program  at  Rajarata  University."
"Subsequently, by letter dated 14-12-2017 (P9) the UGC informed the Petitioner"
"that  in  terms  of  paragraph  1.7  (3)  of  the  University  Admissions  Handbook"
"2016/17,  his  admission  was  invalid  as  he  was  a  registered  student  of  the"
"UNIVOTECH.  By  letter  dated  09-10-2018  (P13a),  the  UGC  requested  the  11th"
"Respondent, the Registrar of the Rajarata University to cancel the studentship"
"of  the  Petitioner  on  the  basis  that  the  latter  had  violated  the  1.7  rule  of  the"
"University Handbook 2016/2017, and accordingly, the 11th Respondent by letter"
"dated  17-01-2018  (P13)  informed  the  Petitioner  that  his  admission  has  been"
"cancelled. As such, the Petitioner states that P9, P13 and P13a are liable to be"
"quashed as those documents are based on manifestly erroneous decisions."
"The contention of the 2nd to 10th Respondents is that as per the 1.7 rule of the"
"University Handbook 2016/2017, as the Petitioner had registered to follow the"
"first-degree  course  at  the  UNIVOTEC,  he  is  ineligible  for  admission  to  a  State"
"University. The 13th to 15th Respondents (UNIVOTEC) in their objections took up"
"the  position  that  the  Petitioner  had  submitted  certified  copies  of  all  required"
"documents, namely GCE A/L Certificate, Birth Certificate, National Identity Card"
"and  School  Leaving  Certificate,  and  thereafter  the  Petitioner  was  registered  at"
"UNIVOTEC under the Registration No. MAN/17/B1/23. The Petitioner filled the"
"registration  form  and  made  the  required  payments  as  well.  The  Petitioner"
"attended the student inauguration held on 06-04-2017 and was issued a student"
