"It is settled law that, the doctrine of natural justice is a cardinal principle to be"
"applied  in  each  and  every  case.  All  the  parties  are  entitled  to  be  heard  before"
"making any decisions in respect of them. In the event of failure on the part of"
"the authorities to adhere to the rule of natural justice, the determination made"
"by the authority is liable to be quashed on this ground alone. However, it is the"
"considered view of this Court that, if the party concerned, expressly or impliedly,"
"admits the allegation leveled against him, the question of fair hearing and/ or"
"Application  of  the  principle  of  natural  justice  does  not  arise.  In  the  instant"
"Application, as the Petitioner expressly admitted in his letter marked P6a that"
"he is a registered student of UNIVOTEC, there is no necessity arising either to"
"UNIVOTEC or UGC to grant an opportunity to the Petitioner for a hearing."
"The  13th  Respondent,  in  his  affidavit  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  UNIVOTEC"
"stated that the Petitioner was a duly registed student of the UNIVOTEC. However,"
"the  UNIVOTEC  by  letter  dated  27-04-2018  (P16)  informed  the  UGC  that  the"
"Petitioner’s registration was not completed due to non-submission of the School"
"Leaving Certificate. The 13th Respondent in its affidavit categorically stated that"
"at the request of the Petitioner and in order to grant him an opportunity to obtain"
"an opportunity to follow a degree program under the UGC,  the letter P16 was"
"issued.  I  decline  to  accept  the  aforesaid  irresponsible  explanation  of  the  13th"
"Respondent. The 13th Respondent, as a responsible authority, should not behave"
"in  this  manner.  The  13th  Respondent  in  its  affidavit  impliedly  admits  the  fact"
"that it had misled the UGC by providing wrong information which is liable to be"
"condemned."
"However, at the request of the Petitioner, the UNIVOTEC by letter dated 11-05-"
"2018 (P17) allowed the Petitioner to rejoin and follow the program at UNIVOTEC."
"It is borne out from the affidavit filed by the Petitioner that now he is following a"
"Bachelor of Science degree at the Open University of Sri Lanka, and therefore, it"
"appears to this Court that the Petitioner has not been prejudiced."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  has  a"
"legitimate expectation to carry out his higher studies at the Rajarata University."
"The meaning and scope of the doctrine of legitimate expectation was considered"
"at length in Union of India vs. Hindustan Development Corporation1, where"
"it was stated that, “Time is a three-fold present: the present as we experience it,"
"the  past  as  a  present  memory  and  future  as  a  present  expectation.  For  legal"
"purposes, the expectation cannot be the same as anticipation. It is different from"
"a wish, desire or a hope nor can it amount to a claim or demand on the ground of"
"a  right.  However,  earnest  and  sincere  a  wish,  a  desire  or  a  hope  may  be  and"
"however  confidently  one  may  look  to  them  to  be  fulfilled,  they  by  themselves"
"cannot amount to an assertable expectation and a mere disappointment does not"
"1 1994 AIR 988, 1993 (3) SCC 499."
