"attract legal consequences. A pious hope even leading to a moral obligation cannot"
"amount  to  a  legitimate  expectation.  The  legitimacy  of  an  expectation  can  be"
"inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established"
"procedure  followed  in  regular  and  natural  sequence.  Again  it  is  distinguishable"
"from a genuine expectation. Such expectation should be justifiable, legitimate and"
"protectable. Every such legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a right"
"and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a conventional sense.”"
"The  Petitioner  in  this  Application  has  violated  the  1.7  rule  of  the  University"
"Handbook 2016/2017, and therefore, he cannot have a legitimate expectation to"
"obtain admission to the Rajarata University. The Petitioner’s wish or desire to"
"carry out higher studies at the Rajarata University is not legitimate."
"In the circumstances, it is well established that the said letters marked P9, P13"
"and P13a have been issued within the purview of the 1.7 rule of the University"
"Handbook 2016/2017, and therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled for the reliefs"
"as prayed for. The Application is dismissed. No costs."
"Application dismissed."
