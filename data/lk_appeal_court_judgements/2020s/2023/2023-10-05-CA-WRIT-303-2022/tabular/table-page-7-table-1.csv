"that is not subjected to transparent and verifiable proof by the party who asserts such facts."
"The Petitioners argue that the 1st Respondent has contemplated to examine or consider facts"
"that  are  irrefutably  not  part  of  the  official  record  pertaining  to  the  inquiry.  It  is  further"
"submitted  that  the  statutory  inquiry  ought  to  be  ‘transparent  and  verifiable’  and  cannot"
"contain  secret  references  that  can  be  excluded from  scrutiny.  In  a  nutshell,  the  Petitioner's"
"prime assertion is that the Commissioner or the 2nd Respondent conducted the inquiry on the"
"3rd Respondent’s application contrary to the principles of natural justice."
"Apart from the above, the Petitioners are raising a claim upon their request made to the 2nd"
"Respondent  -  Inquiry  Officer  to  gain  a  copy  of  the  inquiry  brief.  The  Petitioners,  having"
"noticed that the documents contained in the said copy of the brief were not in a consistent"
"chronological order and further the pages 234-242 were missing, have subsequently written"
"to the Inquiry Officer seeking such missing pages. The said Inquiry Officer, in response to this"
"request, has informed the 1st Petitioner that she was unable to share the missing pages with"
"the Petitioners as such are internal notes relating to the inquiry."
"Nevertheless, it appears that the 3rd Respondent based on its decision to wind up the Company"
"has offered a voluntary severance scheme (VSS) to all the employees of 3 factories linked to"
"the said Company. All employees of the two factories in Ja Ela and Kegalle have accepted the"
"said VSS. However, the 1st Petitioner Union has disputed the said scheme in regard to the"
"factory in Koggala. Anyhow, it is evident that all the employees at the said  Koggala factory"
"except the 2nd to 20th Petitioners have accepted the VSS during different stages of the process"
"of  making  payments.  The  contention  of  the  3rd  Respondent  is  that  the  prerogative  of  the"
"Commissioner to hold an inquiry under TEWA is limited to test the veracity of the application"
"submitted by the 3rd Respondent and to ensure that the employees receive the compensation"
"envisaged by law. It was argued on behalf of the 3rd Respondent that the instant Application"
"of the Petitioner is misconceived in fact and law and thus made malafide by suppressing the"
"material facts described in their pleadings. Predominantly the 3rd Respondent raises a vital"
"question  as  to  how  it  could  re-employ  the  above-named  19  Petitioners  at  a  time  when  the"
"operation  of  the  Company  has  ceased,  due  to  no  fault  or  neglect  on  the  part  of  the  said"
"Company."
