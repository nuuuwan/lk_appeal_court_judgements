"Further,  it  appears  that  no specifications  have been  given  by  the Petitioners  as  to  how  the"
"allegations raised by them have strongly influenced the Commissionerâ€™s decision to approve"
"the termination of services of the employees of the relevant Company. Another noteworthy"
"aspect is that the Petitioners have not raised any objections when the 2nd Respondent notified"
"the parties on 17.02.2022, [Vide - ""P2(e),""] that the testimony in respect of the inquiry will be"
"obtained in writing and both parties would be given the same opportunity. In such a scenario,"
"it is difficult to understand why the Petitioners are making a claim at this review stage on their"
"lost opportunity of cross examining the opponent witness."
"In light of the reasons given above, I take the view that no comprehensive submission has"
"been made by the Petitioners in support of their case in the instant Application. Hence, I do"
"not  see  any  reasonable  grounds  for  this  Court  to  exercise  its  inherent  powers  disregarding"
"even  the  aforesaid  ouster  clause  to  grant  relief  as  prayed  for  in  the  prayer  of  the  Petition"
"considering solely the violation of the principles of natural justice allegedly committed by the"
"1st and 2nd Respondents."
"In the circumstances, I am not inclined to accept the proposition of the Petitioners that the"
"Commissioner  has  not considered  adequate  evidence  upon  the  reasons  tendered  by  the  3rd"
"Respondent Company for its decision to wind up the Company. Further, I hold that it is not"
"reasonable to employ the doctrine of ultra vires when considering the overall circumstances"
"of the instant Application. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application of the Petitioner."
"I order no costs."
