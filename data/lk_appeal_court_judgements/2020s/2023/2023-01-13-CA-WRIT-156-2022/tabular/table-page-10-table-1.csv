"Conclusion"
"Judicial  control  over  public  power  has  been  expanded  through  judicial  activism.  The"
"process of considering ‘Rights’ as an independent ground of review has been recognized"
"by our Courts since the Supreme Court made pronouncements in the judgement of Perera"
"vs. Prof. Daya Edirisinghe and others (1995) 1 Sri. L.R. 148. Even if this Court disregards"
"the submissions of the parties on legitimate expectation, my above findings in reference to"
"the Petitioner whose rights have been affected, are sufficient for the purpose of full and"
"proper adjudication of the instant Application. Thus, I do not make any determination on"
"the reliefs prayed for based on the alleged legitimate expectation. Anyhow, I am mindful"
"of the statement of Lord Woolf MR in R vs. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p."
"Coughlan (2000) 3 All E.R. 850 (at p.872), where he has stated that “Once the legitimacy of"
"the expectation is established, the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of"
"fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the changing policy.” It is true that"
"the governments are free to change policy, however, in certain circumstances the Review"
"Courts have tended to uphold the expectation generated by the old policy."
"In the circumstances, I proceed to issue writs as prayed for in paragraphs (b), (e)(i) and (f)"
"of the prayer of the amended Petition dated 08.08.2022 of the Petitioner."
