"“However, the system has not been modified to collect taxes based on ‘Engine Capacity’ for"
"Hearses. This new tax system came into effect after 2018 budget.”"
"Having  observed  that  the  computerized  system  has  not  been  updated  with  the  new  tax"
"regime,  the  said  DDC  without  any  further  clarification  has  arrived  at  the  following"
"conclusion;"
"“According to new X1D Gazette Rupees 8,005,000.00 should have been paid for this Hearse"
"but as per ‘4000-XH1’ code only 1,789,094.00 has been recovered for this Cusdec”"
"It appears that the DDC has completely ignored the fact that the computer system had not"
"been updated for period of 11 days starting from 09.11.2017 (the date of ‘P10’) up to the"
"date of the Notice of Assessment (‘P9’) i.e., 27.11.2017. Do the Respondents expect this"
"Court to believe that the Customs has not updated their computer system after publishing"
"‘P10’ for 11 days and if so, what was the criteria and procedure adopted by the Customs"
"for the goods imported during that period? Hasn’t the Customs cleared any goods other"

"Court  as  to  how  long  exactly  the said system was  functioning  without  the  revised  data"
"being updated. Moreover, the Petitioner speaks not about 11 days but about a period of 3"
"weeks within which the said system has not been updated. To my mind, it is impossible to"
"justify even a single day without an updated computerized system at the Customs which"
"is vital for the process of levying tax/duty in respect of imported goods."
"It is observed that none of the communications addressed to the Petitioner by the relevant"
"officials stipulate that the Customs has made a mistake and there had been a necessity to"
"rectify such error. Certain provisions are available in the Interpretation Ordinance also to"
"amend, vary, rescind or to revoke orders by the authority who made the same orders. If a"
"public officer or a public institution makes a mistake, procedures are in place which enable"
"them to rectify such mistakes according to law. Not issuing a revised Notice of Assessment"
"up to date itself emphasizes that the Customs has not followed any reasonable criteria in"
"order to overcome any purported repercussions of not updating the computerized system."
"‘Rights’ of the Petitioner"
"In light of the above, it is important to examine whether the rights of the Petitioner can be"
"undermined by clinging only to the provisions of the said Section 3 of the  Act No. 1 of"
