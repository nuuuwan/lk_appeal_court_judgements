"for  justice  to  be  done  in  each  case.  For  these  reasons,  I  shall"
"emphasize how a clear distinction of a Preliminary objection can be"
"drawn.  There  are  two  considerations  for  the  Court  in  this  regard."

"maintainability of an Application or on the basis of the assumption"
"of the truth of all the averments of fact made by the suitor. Secondly,"
"whether the objection before the Court is one which can be taken in"
"argument  though  not  raised  in  the  written  defence.    If  both  these"
"criterium are met, the objection raised may qualify as a Preliminary"
"Objection."

"preliminary  objection  is  confronted  with  a  question  of  law.  Mainly,"
"whether the Petitionerâ€™s Application should be dismissed as he has"
"invoked  an  alternative  remedy  and  has  invoked  the  discretionary"
"jurisdiction while that matter is pending.  To delineate our law in this"
"regard I would like to quote from a recent judgement of this Court. In"
"Pinnaduwage  Baby  Mallika  Chandraseana  vs  C.W  Abeysuriya2"
"having  carefully  considered  judicial  developments  in  the  law  this"
"Court held,"
