"Section 14 of the said Act is to omit the word 'Companies Ordinance' from the relevant"
"provisions in Section 14. In Article 170 of the Constitution, the Companies Ordinance is"
"excluded from the list of written laws by which a body can be established and it is probably"
"because the status of a company registered under the Companies Ordinance is different to"
"a corporation or board."
"It  can  be  assumed  that  the  framers  of  the  Constitution  have  acknowledged  in  the  said"
"Article 170, the fact that a body may be duly established by the Companies Act.  However,"
"the entities that are being established by the Companies Act have been excluded from the"
"said interpretation given to a 'public corporation' whereas, the Legislature in the Budgetary"
"Relief Allowance of Workers Act has not made any reference to the Companies Act. As"
"such,  I  take  the  view  that  I  need  not  advert  to  any  authority  or  principal  to  arrive  at  a"
"conclusion that a body established under the Companies Act is clearly encapsulated in the"
"relevant phrase in section 14 of the said Act."
"The provisions adopted in interpretation Section 46 of the Parliamentary  Budget Office"
"Act No. 06 of 2023, which is a latest Act passed by Parliament, are also apt here. Whilst"
"accepting the same meaning assigned to the words 'public corporation' in Article 170 of"
"the Constitution, the said interpretation Section 46 has given a wide meaning to the words"
"'public institution' as follows;"
