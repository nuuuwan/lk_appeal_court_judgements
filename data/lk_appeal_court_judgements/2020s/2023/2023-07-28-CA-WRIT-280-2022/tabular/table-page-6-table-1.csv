"argue that there is no difference between the words 'established' and 'incorporated'. But it"
"seems that there should be a difference between these two words depending on the context"
"in which it is used and also on the specific intention of the Legislature."
"Once an entity is incorporated by or under a written law, such entity would not get the"
"juristic personality by mere enactment of such written law but a special provision should"
"be embodied therein by Parliament for such an entity to be considered a juristic person"
"with  perpetual  succession.  However,  to  my  mind,  the  establishment  of  an  entity  is"
"generally to give effect to commencing or establishing such entity (including a corporation,"
"board or other body) and to prove the same. Similarly, the date of establishment may refer"
"to the date on which a business starts its' operations, whilst the date of incorporation can"
"be the date on which a business acquires the legal foundation to carry out its' operations."
"In  that  sense,  there  should  be  a  difference  between  an  incorporated  business  and  a"
"registered business as well. It appears, prima facie, that a registered business is attached to"
"persons who own such business or its' directors to the extent of bearing the risk of liability,"
"particularly in limited liability companies. Shareholders or owners of a business which is"
"incorporated may not bear such risk of the business personally."
"The  status  of  a  statutory  corporation  and  an  unincorporated  body  is  also  important  in"
"order to understand the above differences. 'Only if the functions of a proposed body are"
"such that corporate status is necessary, should that status be given. If the body is to engage"
"in commercial activity, or be self-financing, or is to hold funds or other property, or is to"
"enter into contracts, there is likely to be a need for corporate status. If a body is to be solely"
"advisory  or  judicial  or  quasi-judicial,  there  is  unlikely  to  be  a  need  for  incorporation.'"

"In this backdrop, this Court needs to consider whether the Petitioner, which is a company"
"incorporated under the Companies Act No.7 of 2007 ('Companies Act'), comes within the"
"definition of 'a body established by or under any written law'. The Petitioner referring to"
"the  interpretation  given  to  the  words  ""written  law""  in  Article  170  of  the  Constitution,"
"contends  that  the  requirement  of  establishment  by  or  under  any  written  law  would  be"
"fulfilled  once  a  certificate  of  registration  is  issued  under  the  Companies  Act.  I  am  not"
"inclined to accept the way in which the said argument was formulated by the Petitioner at"
"the hearing stage.  The fundamental reason that can be assigned to my view is that the"
"Petitioner Company cannot be considered a statutory body or a corporation created by a"
