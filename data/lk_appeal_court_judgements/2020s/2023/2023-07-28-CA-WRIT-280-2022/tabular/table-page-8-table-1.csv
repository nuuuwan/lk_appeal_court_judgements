"majority  of  the  shares  of  the  said  Asian  Hotels  Corporation  Limited  were  held  by  the"
"Government through the CWE."
"In the circumstances, the question in the instant Application at this stage is whether Sri"
"Lankan  Airlines  (Petitioner),  which  is  not  a  public  body  incorporated  under  a  specific"
"statute, could seek an exclusion under the interpretation given in Section 14 of the said"
"Act."
"The Petitioner has made lengthy submissions in order to substantiate the argument that"
"the  Petitioner  Company  is  not  liable  to  pay  the  allowances  under  the  said  Act  to  the"
"particular  group  of  employees.  The  Petitioner  has  even  referred  to  the  State  Industrial"
"Corporation Act No.49 of 1957 to elaborate the establishment of entities by a written law"
"and under a written law. While appreciating such strenuous submission made on behalf"
"of  the  Petitioner,  I  need  to  stress  that  I  do  not  intend  to  make  a  deep  analysis  of  such"
"submissions. It is because I am of the opinion, in light of my findings above, that this is a"
"fit case to resolve the immediate questions before Court conveniently with the aid of the"
"language  adopted  in  the  interpretation  of  the  words  given  to  a  ""public  corporation""  in"
"Article 170 of the Constitution. Despite the fact that the said interpretation given to ""public"
"corporation"" will not directly contribute to my findings in the instant Application, the 1st"
"to 3rd Respondents rely upon the same interpretation in a different perspective to which I"
"am not inclined to agree."
