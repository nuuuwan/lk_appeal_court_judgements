"annexed  a  document  to  that  effect  marked  'B'.  The  4th  Respondent  in  its'  statement  of"
"objections  responding  to  the  averments  in  the  said  paragraph  9  has  admitted  that  the"
"overwhelming majority of the shares of the Petitioner are held by the Government of Sri"
"Lanka.  The  1st  to  3rd  Respondents  in  their  statement  of  objections  have  not  denied"
"categorically  the  said  averments  relating  to  the  majority  shareholding  of  the  Petitioner"
"Company by the Government of Sri Lanka."
"In light of the above, it is clear that the  Government is holding a majority of the share"
"capital of Sri Lankan Airlines Limited with funds or capital provided by the Government."
"One  of  the  main  arguments  raised  in  the  said  Grand  Oriental  Hotel  Case  was  that  the"
"majority of the shares of the Grand Oriental Hotel were owned by the Bank of Ceylon,"
"which is a State-owned bank and thus, the Grand Oriental Hotel should be exempted from"
"the liability of paying budgetary relief allowances. Anyhow, the Court of Appeal appears"
"to have taken a view that the exclusion under the said Act cannot be extended to entities"
"where shares are not directly held by the Government. Accordingly, the final conclusion"

"Company. Thus, it appears that the Petitioner has met one of the above requirements to"
"be  excluded  from  making  budgetary  relief  allowances,  on  the  basis  of  ownership  of"
"majority of shares."
"Now  I  advert  to  the  other  requirement  which  a  corporation,  board  or  other  body  must"
"satisfy in order to be exempted from liability under the provisions of the said Act. Such"
"requirement  deals  with  the  mode  of  establishment  of  the  entity  which  seeks  exclusion."
"When you sift the said requirement, one may find three sub limbs: a corporation, board or"
"other  body  should  be  in  existence;  such  corporation,  board  or  other  body  should  be"
"established  by  or  under  any  written  law;  and  also,  the  said  corporation,  board  or  other"
"body should carry out an industry, business or undertaking."
"When examining the fact whether the Petitioner Company has met the said requirement,"
"the mode of the establishment of the said Company should be taken into consideration"
"carefully. Out of those three sub-limbs mentioned above, what attracts me mostly is the"
"element which includes the word 'established'. In other words, the corporation, board or"
"other body stipulated in the said section should be established by or under any written law"
"and it is specifically not to be incorporated by or under any written law. At once, one may"
