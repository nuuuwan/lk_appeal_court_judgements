"The Counsel appearing for the Respondents vehemently objected to the"
"application on the basis that the suspect had put a witness under threat"
"and duress inside the Court premises and the learned Magistrate had"
"observed his reluctance to give evidence in the case record which is a"
"good enough testimony of the conduct of the suspect."
"The  Counsel  for  the  suspect  stated  that  although  the  suspect  was"
"arrested and produced under the instant act meaningful action is yet to"
"be taken against the suspect by the authorities."
"The law  pertaining to  the  instant matter is  that  if  a  suspect is  to  be"
"enlarged on bail under this act he has to show exceptional circumstances"
"to obtain bail by the Court of Appeal."
"The term exceptional has not been defined in the act but in the cases so"
"far decided have held that exceptionality of circumstances have to be"
"determined case by case."
"But in the instant matter we observe that the complainant who has come"
"to  Court to  give evidence has been dealt by the  suspect inside Court"
"premises which shows scant disregard for the entire Court system. As"
"such if  bail is  considered for the  instant suspect at  this juncture, we"
"conclude that it  is  a mockery of justice  and violates the  fundamental"
"purpose  of  the  act  which  is  to  safeguard  the  rights  of  victims  and"
"witnesses."
"As such the instant application for bail is hereby refused."
