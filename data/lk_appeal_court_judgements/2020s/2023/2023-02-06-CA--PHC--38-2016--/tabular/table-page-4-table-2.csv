"It is worthy to draw the attention of Court to Judgment in the case of Bandulasena and"
"others  Vs.  G.K.Chaminda  Kushantha  [CA  PHC  147/2009  C.A.M  27.09.2017]  where"
"Surasena J emphasized:"
"“It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an appeal"
"against  a  judgment  pronounced  by  the  Provincial  High  Court  in  exercising  its"
"revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is not to consider an appeal"
"against  the  Primary  Court  order  but  to  consider  an  appeal  in  which  an  order"
"pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction"
"is sought be impugned.”"
