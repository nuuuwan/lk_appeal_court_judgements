"In this instance, Court draws the attention to the Judgment in the case Nandawathie and"
"others Vs. Mahindasena [(2009) 2 SLR 218]"
"“When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in the"
"High Court, the High Court can examine only the legality of that Order and not the"
"correction of that Order”."
"It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J;"
"“I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances should"
"not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application to examine"
"the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the High Court Judge"
"in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not under the guise"
"of an appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the evidence led in the main case.”"
