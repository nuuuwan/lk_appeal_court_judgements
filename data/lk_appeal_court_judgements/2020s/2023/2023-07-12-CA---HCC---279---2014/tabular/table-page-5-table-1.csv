"that the appellant was brutally assaulted by the narcotics officers at Galle"
"Face green at about 4.30 in the afternoon which is also very improbable"
"because at that time of the day generally the Galle Face Green is very"
"populated and any right thinking police officer would not be assaulting a"
"suspect  in  custody  on  broad  day  light  violating  the  basic  law  in  the"
"country."
"Hence,  we  have  to  conclude  that  the  defense  put  forward  by  the"
"appellant at the trial has not created a reasonable doubt in the case for"
"the prosecution but we observe that at some points the trial judge had"
"not properly analyzed the evidence before her but we finally conclude"
"that the trial judge rightly concluded in saying that the prosecution had"
"proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt."
"As  such  we  find  no  merit  in  the  submission  of  the  counsel  for  the"
"appellant as  such  the  conviction and the sentence of the trial judge is"
"hereby affirmed and the instant appeal is dismissed."
