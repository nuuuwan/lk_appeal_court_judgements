"acceptance  of  the  fact  that  the  appellant  did  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the"
"transporting of timber without a permit. On these facts the court is of the view that the"
"confiscation of the lorry is not justifiable,”"
"The 
learned  Magistrate  had  failed  to  consider  the  above-mentioned  judgement  and  the"
"circumstances of this particular case and the previous conduct of the driver of the said vehicle"
"and the owner, prior to delivering the order to confiscate the vehicle. If there had been any"
"evidence  against  the  owner  of  the  lorry,  the  police  could  have  charged  him  for  aiding  and"
"abetting under section 25(3), and made him an accused person of the Magistrate’s Court case,"
"which, has not been the case.  It is very clear that the Presumption of Innocence, therefore,"
"accrues to the appellant."
"It is important to note that  the underlying principles of interpretation of statutes in specific"
"cases such as this, were found in the case of Nizar vs. Inspector General of Police 1978 2 SLR"
"304 and in the case of Manawadu vs. Attorney General 1991 (1) SLR 209."
"It  enumerated  the  principles  of  making  an  order  for  confiscation  wherein  the  underlying"
"principle is that the property of a third party cannot be confiscated without hearing the third"
"party. The ratio decidendi of the said decisions was the prevention of arbitrary confiscation of"
"property  of  innocent  persons  and  was  not  intended  to  provide  a  guideline  as  to  how  such"
"confiscation should occur. The statute accordingly must be considered and interpreted strictly"
"when an application to the loss of liberty and property of persons."
"The learned Judge of the High Court and the learned Magistrate failed to recognize that degree"
"of  precautions  taken  by  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  could  take  defence  on  the  prevailing"
"circumstances of each case, and thereby have erred by concluding that the appellant has failed"
"to sufficiently show cause in the confiscation inquiry. Present law requires an owner of a vehicle"
"at the confiscation inquiry to satisfy the court that he has reasonably taken all precautions to"
"prevent the vehicle being used in the commission of the relevant offence."
"At the arguments of this matter, the attention of this court was brought to the fact that the"
"degree  of  precautions  one  can  take  would  differ  from  case  to  case  depending  on  the"
"circumstances  of  the  case.  The  extent  and  the  limitations  of  the  precautions  would  vary"
"between cases where the owner himself actively engages in the business for which the vehicle"
"is used and the owner simply hires his vehicles for business purposes without actively engaging"
"in such activities. The fact whether the vehicle is given for hire or used for private purposes or"
"any other business purpose should also be taken into consideration."
"Due to those circumstantial differences, an equal level of precaution should not be expected"
"from a vehicle owner. It is evident that the vehicle owner in this matter had very limited control"
"over  the  vehicle  which  in  turn  limits  his  capacity  to  take  precautionary  measures  and  the"
"learned  Magistrate  should  not  have  expected  a  higher  degree  of  precautions  which 
is"
"impractical under these circumstances."
"The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the owner of the vehicle is a farmer. He had"
"purchased the vehicle for the purpose of his coconut trading business. The accused person was"
"working as a driver for the past two years and never engaged in any illegal activity. Therefore,"
