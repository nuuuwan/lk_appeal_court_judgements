"The attention of the Court is drawn by the learned counsel for the respondent, to the line of"
"cross-examination, where he was challenged with regard to the payment of the fine. Hence, it"
"has  been  severely  challenged  the  credibility  of  the  appellant.  Hence,  the  counsel  for  the"
"respondent  further  argued  that  the  onus  of  proving  the  fact  has  shifted  to  the  appellant."
"However, the appellant had failed to call evidence of the driver to prove the fact that he was"
"warned and advised not to use the vehicle for illegal purposes."
"The learned counsel for the respondent further says that the judgment of Sujith Priyantha vs."
"OIC  Poddala  CA/PHC/157/12  where  it  had  been  held  that  merely  giving  instructions  to  the"
"driver not to use the vehicle for illegal activities does not satisfy the test of taking all precautions"
"to prevent such things from happening. However, the appellant has failed to prove what steps"
"or precautions were taken by him in order to avoid the driver engaged in illegal activities by"
"using his vehicle. Similarly, the appellant had failed to establish that he had no knowledge with"
"regard to the offence committed by the driver. In terms of his own testimony, the driver had"
"informed him where he was going. Thus, it is the duty of the appellant to check the authenticity"
"of the version of the driver as the said vehicle was taken on hire by a person known to him."
"The  Magistrate  of  Pilessa  court  had  sufficient  opportunity  to  examine  and  observe  the"
"demeanour of the witness. The Magistrate would have observed the demeanour of the witness"
"under  cross-examination.  Hence,  the  appellant  cannot  rely  on  section  134  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance  in  order  to  prove  his  case  which  requires  corroboration.  The  respondent  further"
"prays that this appeal is dismissed for want of merits and affirms the order dated 03.09.2018"
"of the High Court of Kurunegala in the case number HCR/04/17and the order dated 14.12.2016"
"of the Magistrateâ€™s Court of Pilessa in case No. 79786."
"Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance reads as follows;"
