"Therefore,  it  clearly  shows  that  the  land  surveyed  by  the  said  1st  commission  is  not  the  land"
"described in the schedule to the plaint and the Defendant is in possession of the land which was"
"surveyed on the said commission."
"Since the said plan marked ‘X’ is not in conformity with the land described in the schedule to the"
"plaint, on behalf of the Plaintiffs, a second commission had been taken to survey the land described"

"Plaintiffs and issues numbered 6-14 were raised on behalf of the Defendant."
"It is to be noted that on behalf of the Plaintiffs only the 6th Plaintiff had adduced evidence and"
"none of the other Plaintiffs had come forward to give evidence. The 6th Plaintiff adduced evidence"
"and produced documents P1-P3 in evidence."
"It seems, most of the deeds marked by the 6th Plaintiff was to prove their title to the subject matter"
"described in the schedule to the Plaint in the Plaintiffs action."

"contended that they were entitled to a declaration of tittle in respect of the said land."
"In contrast, it was the position taken up by the Defendant that he himself along with some other"
"third parties [who are not Parties to the instant case] are entitled to the land called and known as"
"‘Ihala Kalale Kumbrua’ alias ‘Kalale Kumbura’. Which is shown in plans marked ‘X’ and ‘Y’."
"It is relevant to note that the Plaintiffs had taken two commissions to survey the land described in"
"the schedule to the Plaint, which is the land described in the title deeds relied on by the Plaintiffs."
