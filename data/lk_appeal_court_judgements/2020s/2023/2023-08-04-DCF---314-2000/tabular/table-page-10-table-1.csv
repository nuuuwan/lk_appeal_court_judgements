"In respect of those issues no 12 and 13, it appears that the Defendant in his amended answer, has"
"prayed relief for damages caused to him by granting of the interim injunction against him and"

"evidence in this respect."
"Accordingly, we hold that the Defendant-Appellant is entitled for damages. Hence, we award Rs."
"10,000 as damages prayed in prayer II of the amened answer as the initial capital cost of setting"
"up the gemming operation and also damages prayed in prayer II of the amended answer, as Rs."
"1000 per mensem from the date of filing of the Plaint and until the date of pronouncement of this"
"judgement amounting to Rs. 530,000."
"It is reiterated that in our law in rei vindicatio action, a significant burden lies on the Plaintiff not"
"only  to  establish  title  over  the  land  but  to  properly  identify  the  corpus  of  the  land  and  its"
"boundaries.  In  view  of  the  foregoing  reasons  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  prove  the  identity  of  the"
"corpus thus the Plaintiffs had not discharged this burden. Therefore, the decision of the learned"
"District Judge is set aside, and we allow this appeal."
