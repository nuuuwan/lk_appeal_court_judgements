"This approach of the Learned High Court Judge clearly demonstrates that"
"he  had  been  greatly  influenced  by  the  confessionary  statement  which  had"
"creeped  into  the  court  proceedings.  The  prosecution  should  not  have  led"
"evidence  which  contained  confessionary  statement  of  the  Appellant.  This"
"leads to a denial of a fair trial."
"In this case a serious mistake done by the Learned High Court Judge has"
"caused  great  prejudice  to  the  Appellant.  Further,  the  Appellant  for  his"
"defence  had  given  evidence  under  oath  and  called  his  wife  as  a  defence"
"witness. But instead of analysing the evidence of the defence, the Learned"
"High  Court  Judge  had  analysed  the  law  pertaining  to  the  acceptance  or"
"rejection of the dock statement of an accused in the judgment. The relevant"
