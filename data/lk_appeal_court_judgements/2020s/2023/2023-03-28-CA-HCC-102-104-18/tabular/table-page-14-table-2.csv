"behalf of an accused had been rejected by the learned trial Judge, it was held"
"at page 21 of the judgement,"
"Per Anil Gooneratne, J."
"“I  find  a  total  misdirection  of  the  Trial  Judge  at  folios  420-419  where"
"Tarzan’s testimonial trustworthiness had been analyzed and rejected. The"
"basis  of  rejection  has  been  summarized  by  the  Trial  Judge  as  regards"
"Tarzan. 
It 
is  stated 
that  witness  Tarzan 
is  a  drug  peddler.  He  has"
"consumed  drugs  for  over  15  years.  He  daily  consumes  drugs.  (Twice  a"
"day)  Tarzan  has  been  convicted  by  a  Court  of  law  for  possession  and"
"trafficking,  etc.  These  are  items  of  evidence  admitted  into  the  evidence  of"
"Tarzan.  It  is  a  misdirection  of  law  to  conclude  that  he  is  an  untruthful"
"witness on account of above. There is no denial by Tarzan of above. Trial"
"judge  states  that  a  person  in  the  caliber  of  Tarzan,  who  is  a  drug  addict"
"and  such  evidence  is  untrustworthy  of  credit  when  he  is  called  upon  to"
"give  evidence  on  behalf  of  another  drug  trafficker  or  drug  peddler.  Trial"
"Judge’s  view 
is 
that  Tarzan  has  a  distorted  mind 
is  on  one  hand"
"unsupported  by  medical  evidence.  TC  has 
failed 
to  analyze  Tarzan’s"
"evidence 
in 
an 
unbiased  manner 
and  without 
importing 
personal"
"knowledge of the witness and as such it cannot be a good ground to reject"
"his  testimony 
in  Court.  A  witness  can  be  rich,  poor,  disabled,  person"
"convicted  of  an  offence,  suffer  mental  disability  during 
lucid  periods,"
"person  of  young  age  etc.  what  is  important  is  not  the  character-  position"
"but the evidence that transpires in Court is trustworthy or has credence or"
"not. Whatever the person is, can the Court rely on the evidence led in Court"
"and not based on his position in life.”"
