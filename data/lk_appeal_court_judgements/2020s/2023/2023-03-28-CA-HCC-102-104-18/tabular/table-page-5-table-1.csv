"The place where he found the injured person had been about 50 meters away"
"from a funeral house. He had observed a streetlight about 6 meters away from"
"the shop. One Bernard Fernando has identified the injured as his son, and PW-"
"04  has  instructed  him  to  take  the  injured  to  the  hospital.  At  the  same  time,"
"another  person  called  Anura  Lasantha  (PW-02)  has  informed  him  that  one  of"
"the persons who stabbed the injured person ran away towards a nearby statue."
"Upon receiving this information, PW-04,  along  with another  police officer, has"
"got into a three-wheeler and gone in pursuit of the attacker."
"Although he was not informed of any details of the attacker, when he reached"
"the  statue,  PW-04  has  observed  a  person  attempting  to  switch  on  a  three-"
"wheeler, which was parked nearby. With the aid of the nearby streetlights, he"
"has observed that the person is covered with blood in his hands and the body."
"When  he  pointed  the  torch  he  was  carrying  towards  the  person,  he  has"
"observed  blood  stains  in  his  left  foot  as  well.  Further,  upon  searching  the"
"person,  he  has  seen  a  cut  injury  in  his  left-hand  index  finger.  He  has  also"
"observed him in a panicked state. Accordingly, PW-04 has arrested the person"
"as a suspect of the incident."
"The  earlier-mentioned  Anura  Lasantha  has  informed  PW-04  that  the  arrested"
"person  was  one  of  the  assailants  of  the  injured.  He  has  identified  him  in  the"
"trial Court as the first appellant."
"The prosecution has called the other relevant police witnesses who conducted"
"investigations  into  the  matter  and  recovered  the  two  knives  as  part  of  the"
"investigation."
"The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the postmortem has marked"
"the  said  report  as  P-06.  She  has  observed  thirty  cut  and  stab  wounds  on  the"
"body  of  the  deceased.  The  defence  has  admitted  the  fact  that  the  JMO  has"
"observed  such  injuries  on  the  body  in  terms  of  section  420  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act."
