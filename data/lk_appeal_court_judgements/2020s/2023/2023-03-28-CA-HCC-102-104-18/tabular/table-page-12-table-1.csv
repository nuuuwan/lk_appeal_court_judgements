"that  although  evidence  of  a  solitary  witness  can  be  relied  upon  to  a  prove  a"
"case, it can be done only if that witness was cogent and trustworthy."
"The  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  contended  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  has"
"failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  as  to  why  he  is  accepting  the  evidence  of  PW-"
"02, given the discrepancies in his evidence. It was his position that PW-02 was"
"a  witness  planted  by  the  police  to  establish  their  case,  and  it  was  highly"
"doubtful whether any witness could identify the knife or knives used to commit"
"the  crime  under  the  light  conditions  that  existed,  and  given  the  facts  and  the"
"circumstances."
"He too pointed out the possible reasons as to why the prosecution who initially"
"wanted to produce the deposition made by PW-01 at the non-summary inquiry"
"as  evidence,  later  decided  not  to  do  so,  because,  if  produced,  it  would  have"
"been detrimental to the prosecution case."
"The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  representing  the  Hon.  Attorney"
"General submitted that a witness being a Heroin addict is not a reason by itself"
"to doubt his evidence. She cited what was stated by Anil Gooneratne, J. in the"
"case  of  C.  A.  Sisira  Bandula  alias  Mahathun  Vs.  The  Attorney  General  CA"
"122/2006 decided on 09-10-2014 to support her contention."
"It  was  her  position  that  PW-02  was  a  credible  and  trustworthy  witness,  and"
"there had been no acceptable issues raised as to the credibility of his evidence"
"at the trial. It was her position that PW-02 has been consistent in saying that"
"he  did  not  know  the  deceased  and  his  father  before  the  incident,  and  later  in"
"his evidence  saying he speaks to the father,  cannot be  interpreted to say that"
"the witness had not been truthful in that regard."
"Referring  to  the  identification  of  the  deceased  at  the  postmortem,  it  was  her"
"position that PW-02 has identified the body as the person who was stabbed at"
"the incident."
