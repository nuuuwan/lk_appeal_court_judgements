"that  it  was  in  the  morning  of  the  following  day,  and  yet  again,  later  in  his"
"evidence has stated that it was in the afternoon at 3.30 p.m."
"Referring to the prosecution’s failure to mark the deposition made by PW-01 at"
"the  non-summary  inquiry  even  after  informing  the  Court  that  it  would  be  so"
"marked,  it  was  the  position  of  the  learned  Counsel  that  it  was  not  done"
"because,  if  marked,  it  would  have  further  established  that  PW-02’s  evidence"
"was not reliable. The learned Counsel contended further, that the learned High"
"Court Judge has believed the evidence of PW-02 at the very commencement of"
"his judgement and even before he considered the evidence led on behalf of the"
"defence.  It  was  his  view  that  this  approach  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"has denied a fair trial towards his client."
"It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the 2nd appellant, that the 2nd"
"appellant  was  arrested  by  the  police  while  he  was  sleeping  in  a  house  where"
"the 3rd appellant was also sleeping. It was his position that although the police"
"witnesses say a weapon was recovered upon his statement, the appellant never"
"gave such a statement nor was he allowed to read the statement before he was"
"asked to sign. It was also his position that the 2nd appellant was shown to PW-"
"02 and that was the reason why he identified him at the identification parade."
"The stand taken up by the learned Counsel to argue that the evidence of PW-02"
"was  not  credible,  was  that  he  was  never  an  eyewitness  to  the  incident,  but"
"because  he  was  a  friend  of  the  father  of  the  deceased,  he  volunteered  to  give"
"evidence, and he has been coaxed by the police to implicate the 2nd appellant."
"He  pointed  to  the  evidence  where  PW-02  who  has  stated  that  when  the"
"stabbing took place, the deceased was leaning against a  lamppost, and to the"
"place where the deceased was found injured in front of a shop nearby. It was"
"his  position  that  this  discrepancy  shows  that  the  witness  has  not  seen  the"
"incident and there exist a serious doubt in that regard. He contended that this"
"discrepancy has not drawn the attention of the learned High Court Judge."
