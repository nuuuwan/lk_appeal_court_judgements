"“obligatory duties must be distinguished from discretionary powers. With"
"the latter, mandamus has nothing to do""."
"T
his court observes that it is established law that a Writ of Mandamus does"
"not lie against discretionary powers and therefore this court cannot impose"
"itself against the discretionary power vested upon the Respondent in terms of"
"section 165(4)."
"F
urther,  I  also  observe  that  The  Petitioner  is  seeking  a  Writ  of  Mandamus"
"compelling a specific performance without moving to quash the determination"
"of the Respondents. The Petitioner has not sought to quash the documents"
"marked ‘P4’ and ‘P9’ and the said decisions had not been impugned. Hence, I"
"observe that the Petitioner’s prayer is bad in law as presented."
"F
urther, this Court also discerns that the Petitioner does not seek to quash"
"the document marked ‘P11’ which has been issued in terms of Section 171"
"wherein  it  established  finality  to  the  assessment  when  no  valid  appeal  has"
"been  lodged  in  terms  of  Section  165(1)  or  where  the  said  appeal  has  been"
"dismissed  under  Section  165(9)  or  where  an  agreement  has  been  reached"
"under Section 165(7)."
"Therefore, I hold that the decision challenged by the Petitioner is in line with"
"the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and established principles of law. The"
"Petitioner is not entitled for a Writ of Mandamus in terms of Article 140."
"F
or the above reasons, I refuse to issue notice. I dismiss the Application of"
"the Petitioners and make no Order as to the costs of this Application."
