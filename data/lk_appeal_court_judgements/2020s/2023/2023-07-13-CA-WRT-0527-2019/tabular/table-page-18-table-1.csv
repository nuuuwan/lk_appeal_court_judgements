"In the present application, the IIM rightly sought permission from the UGC"
"to  establish  the  aforementioned  postgraduate  degree.  Subsequently,  the"
"UGC  constituted  a  panel  of  experts  to  examine  this  matter.  The  UGC"
"requested the IIM to incorporate the recommendations of the expert panel"
"into  the  syllabus  of  the  proposed  postgraduate  degree  to  ensure  the"
"maintenance of academic standards."
"Regrettably, despite being provided with ample opportunities by the UGC"
"to  comply  with  its  requests,  the  IIM  utterly  failed  to  do  so.  Given  these"
"circumstances,  the  UGC  had  no  alternative  but  to  disapprove  the  said"
"program."
"It is the  considered opinion of this Court that the decision taken by the"
"UGC,  as  contained 
in  document  P26, 
is 
justifiable, 
falls  within  the"
"authority  conferred  by 
law 
is  consistent  with 
the 
(intra  vires),  and"
"provisions of the Universities Act."
"Furthermore, it  is  ensured that through the establishment  of the  PGIIM"
"for postgraduate studies, the discontinuation of the disputed program by"
"the UGC will not cause any prejudice to the petitioners."
"It is borne out from the documents marked P9A, P9C, P9C, P101, P10, P12"
"etc that the Petitioners were fully aware of the fact that the postgraduate"
"program in dispute was not within an adequate standard and the IIM failed"
"to  comply  with  the  report  presented  by  the  expert  panel  of  the  UGC."
"Further, as per the document marked 27R25, the UGC  had kept informed"
"the  Petitioners  the  present  situation  and  the  Petitoners  were  given  an"
"adequate hearing as well. As such it appears to this Court that  the UGC"
"had adhered to the principles of natural justice."
