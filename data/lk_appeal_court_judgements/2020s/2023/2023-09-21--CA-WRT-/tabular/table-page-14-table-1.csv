"sanction of the Board has not been obtained to execute the deed and thus"
"the Transfer Deed bearing No. 4142, which has been exected while a notice"
"registered under subsection 35(2) is in force, is null and void. Therefore,"
"the  decision  of  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board  to  overrule  the  preliminary"
"objection  raised  on  the  ground  that  the  relevant  property  had  been"
"transferred to the petitioner by a duly executed deed is correct."
