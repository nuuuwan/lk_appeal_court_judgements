"[68] It is crystal clear that His Lordship Gooneratne J. flatly rejected the argument"
"of  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  that  the  legislature  intended  that  the  hearing  should  be"
"concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition of appeal or that the"
"time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition of appeal."
"His Lordship Gooneratne J. was not prepared to be guided by the Budget Speech"

"the legislative intention was that the hearing should be concluded within 2 years"

"question involved (Question No. 2), held with the Respondent on the basis that"
"the hearing for the calculation of time limit of 2 years specified in section 140 (10)"
"commences from the date of the oral hearing and not from the date of filing the"
"petition  of  appeal.  In  my  view,  the  principle  laid  down  by  Gooneratne  J.  in"
"Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra) was that the hearing"
"for the purpose of time limits of 2 years specified in the second proviso to Section"
"140 (10) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 commences"
"from the date of the oral hearing and no more."
"[70]  That  was  the  principle  upon  which  the  case  was  decided  by  His  Lordship"
"Gooneratne J. which represents the reason and spirit of the decision and that part"
"alone is the principle which forms the only authoritative element of a precedent"
"in Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra). Having laid down"
"the principle upon which the case shall be determined on the Question of Law"
