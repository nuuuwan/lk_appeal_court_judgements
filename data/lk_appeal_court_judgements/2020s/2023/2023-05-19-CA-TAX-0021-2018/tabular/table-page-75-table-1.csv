"there is a statutory provision in the Act, No. 22 of 2011, which expressly provides"
"that the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment, shall for"
"all purposes, come into force from 01.04.2011. In  in any event, the said Indian"
"decision applied unless there is any express provision in the Amendment Act itself"
"which  prohibits  the  assessor  from  passing  an  order  of  rectification  within  the"
"extended period of limitation. For those, reasons, I am not inclined to agree with"
"the Respondentâ€™s argument that the amending Act, No. 22 of 2011 extended the"
"time  period  given  to  the  assessor  from  31.03.2013  to  30.11.2013  to  make  the"
"assessment  for  the  year  of  assessment  2010/2011,  after  the  time  bar  period"
"expired on 31.03.2013."
"[197]  For  those  reasons,  I  hold  that  although  the  assessment  was  made  on"
"09.09.2013, the assessment for the year of assessment 2010/2011 was time barred"
"when it was not made on or before 31.03.2013 in terms of section 163(5) of the"
"Inland Revenue Act (as amended). For those reasons, the question of law No. 2 is"
"answered in favour of the Appellant."
"Question of Law No. 3"
"Is the determination made by the Commissioner-General time barred in terms of"
"section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act?"
"[198]  At  the  hearing,  Dr.  Felix  submitted  that  the  determination  made  by  the"
"Commissioner General is time barred for the following reasons:"
"1.  The  petition  of  appeal  to  the  Commissioner  General  was  tendered  on"
