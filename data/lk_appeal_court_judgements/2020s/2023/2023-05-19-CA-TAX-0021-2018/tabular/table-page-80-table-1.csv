"[210] At the hearing, Dr. Felix submitted that the Appellant is a person referred"
"to in Section 2 (1)(a) of the Nations Building Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as"
"the NBT Act) and paid the Nation Building Tax (hereinafter referred to as the"
"NBT) at the point of importation under Section 3(1)(i) read with section 5 of the"
"NBT Act. He submitted that  the Regulations made by the Minister of Finance"
"under  section  212  of  the  Act  and  published  in  Gazette  Extraordinary  No."
"1606/31 dated 19.06.2009 by which the two thirds of NBT charged by the NBT"
"Act  was regarded as a prescribed levy as provided by section 26(1)(l) (iii) of the"
"Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, does not apply to the Appellant."
"[
211] His contention was that once the NBT was paid by the Appellant at the"
"point  of  importation  and  collected    by  the  Director-General  of  Customs,  the"
"Appellant does not fall within the said Regulation which only refers to a person"
"referred to in paragraphs (b)-(d) of subsection 1 of section 2, and chargeable"
"with tax in respect of the liable turnover of such person for such relevant quarter"
"as  the  use  of  the  word  “quarter”  in  the  Regulation  reflects  that  the  relevant"
"Gazette was applicable only to those paying NBT on a quarterly basis."
