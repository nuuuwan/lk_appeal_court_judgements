"except with the written approval of the Commissioner-General or any"
"Commssioner.”"
"[202] The acknowledgement was issued by the Senior Assessor under section 165"
"(6),  and  not  under  section  163  or  165(7)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  and  the"
"acknowledgement of the appeal under section 165(6) is not caught under section"
"208 of the Inland Revenue Act. The question of acknowledgement falls entirely"
"within the purview of section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, which stipulates"
"the  period  within  which  the  receipt  of  the  appeal  shall  be  acknowledged  and"
"where  so  acknowledged  or  not  acknowledged,  as 
the  case  may  be, 
the"
"consequences thereof. Section 165(6) does not specify who should acknowledge"
"the  appeal,  which  is  only  an  administrative  act  performed  on  behalf  of  the"
"Commissioner-General."
"[203] It is patently clear that the senior assessor who is also an assessor has only"
"performed an administrative function conferred by section 165 (6) of the Act and"
"signed 
the  acknowledgement 
letter,  acting  under 
the  authorisation  of  his"
"Superior Officers rather than performing any discretionary power in terms of the"
"provisions of the Inland Revenue Act. In the result, the fact that a senior assessor"
"signed  the  acknowledgement  letter,  or  that there  is  no  reference  in  that  letter"
"that the assessor/senior assessor signed the acknowledgement “for and on behalf"
"o
f
 
the Commissioner-General” will not make the acknowledgement of the appeal"
"invalid."
"[204] The Appellant has further claimed that no acknowledgement was received"
"by him in terms of section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act and, therefore, the"
"appeal shall be deemed to have been received by the Commissioner-General on"
"27.12.2013 under section 165 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act. There is no dispute"
"that  the  appeal  made  by  the  Appellant  to  the  Commissioner-General  was"
"received on 27.12.2013. The TAC brief  (p 28) contains an acknowledgement of"
"the  appeal  dated  09.01.2014,  which  states  that  the  appeal  was  received  on"
