"“Section 115(3) is an empowering section. It empowers the Assessor to do one"
"o
f
 two things. He may accept the return, in which event he makes the"
"assessment accordingly. Or else he may not accept the return. In such an event"
"he is obliged to do two things:"
"1
.
  Estimate the assessable income, taxable income or taxable gifts and"
"assess him accordingly (the underlining is mine); and"
"2
.
  He must communicate to the Assessee in writing the reasons for not"
"accepting the return."
"To my mind these are all part of one exercise. There is nothing in the"
"provision which indicates that the estimation of assessable income, wealth"
"and gifts must be postponed for some time long after the non-acceptance."
"Even if one transposes the words “and communicate to such persons in"
"writing the reasons for not accepting the return” to the first line of the"
"section after the word “return” and before the word “estimate” it will not"
"make it a condition precedent. One has still to read more words into it to"
"have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This"
"would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty, but does"
"not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the"
"section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return, he may"
"assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also"
"communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also"
"j
ustifies his act of assessing on an estimate. The plain meaning of the section"
