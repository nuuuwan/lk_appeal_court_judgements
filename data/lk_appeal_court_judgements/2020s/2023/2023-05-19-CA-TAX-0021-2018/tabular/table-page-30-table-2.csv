"[80] During the argument, Dr. Felix strongly relied on the judgment of the Court"
"of Appeal in A. M. Ismail v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (1980) IV"
"Sri Lanka Tax Cases 156, D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail (1982) Sri"

"and Wijewardene v. Kathiragamar (1991) IV Sri Lanka Tax Cases 313, in particular,"
"in support of his contention. During the course of further argument, he further"
"relied  on  the  decisions  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in John Keels Holdings PLC v."
"Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue 
(CA  Tax  26/2013  decided  on"
"16.03.2022 and ACL Cables v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax"
"07/2013 decided on 16.03.2022, which held that whilst making an assessment"
"and sending a notice of assessment are two different things, a valid assessment"
"cannot  be  made  in  time  unless  the  notice  of  assessment  is  served  on  the  tax"
"payer."
"[81]  The 
learned  Senior  Additional  Solicitor  General  however,  strenuously"
"contended that there is a clear difference between the making of the assessment"
"and  the  notice  of  assessment,  and  the  time  bar  relates  to  the  making  of  the"
"assessment, and not to the service of the notice of assessment. He argued that"
"there can be no notice without an actual and valid assessment, which precedes"
"the notice and the assessment, and therefore, it is in no way dependent on the"
"notice or the service thereafter.  He relied on the decisions in Honig & Others"
