"","purpose  of  the  application  of  the  proposition  of  law  made  in  Sampanthan v."
"Attorney General (supra). The object sought to be attained by section 10 of the",""
"","Tax Appeals Commission Act has been designed primarily, to expedite the appeal"
"","process filed before the TAC, which was established by an Act of Parliament, and"
"","the Commsission shall comprise retired Judges of the Supreme Court or the Court"

"","[41] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted time"
"","to the TAC to hear all appeals within one hundred and eighty days from the date"
"","of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission"
"","(Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012 extended the said time period from one hundred"

"","commencement  of  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.  The  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"","(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 however, reduced the time limit granted to the"
"","TAC to conclude the appeal by enacting that the time specified in section 10 shall"
"","commence from the date of the commencement of its  sittings for hearing the"

the  TAC,  but 
it"

"[42]  The","legislature  amended  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act  twice  with"
"","retrospective  effect,  and  provided  time  frames  to  conclude  appeals  quickly  as"
"","possible within the time limit of 270 days from the date of the commencement"
"","of its sittings for the hearing of such appeal.  It is true that the legislature has"
"","amended section 10 with retrospective operation but if it intended to take away"
"","the jurisdiction of the TAC, and render its determination made outside the time"
"","limit specified in section 10 invalid, it could have easily made, with retrospective"

"","[43] It is settled law that the Courts cannot usurp legislative function under the"

"Appeals  Commission  Act,  because  this","is  exclusively 
in  the  domain  of  the"
