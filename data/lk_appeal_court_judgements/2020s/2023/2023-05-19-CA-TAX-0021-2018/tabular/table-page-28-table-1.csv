"time limit of 2 years ought to be calculated from the date of the receipt of the"
"Petition of Appeal by the Board and not from the date of oral hearing."
"[73] That part of the statement enunciated by His Lordship Gooneratne J. that “it"
"would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of"
"oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred” is a passing observation, in the form"
"of an assumption or hypothesis unaccompanied by the principle upon which the"
"case was decided in favour of the Respondent, is manifestly an obiter and not the"
"ratio having a binding authority."
"[74] On the other hand, His Lordship Gooneratne J.  was never called upon to go"
"into  the  factors,  whether  or  not  the  second  proviso  to  section  140  (10)  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act could be regarded as mandatory or directory, having regard"
"to the nature, purpose and the design of the statute, the consequences that may"
"flow  from  non-compliance,  if  the  act  is  not  done  within  that  period.  So,  those"
"factors  were  not  considered  by  His  Lordship  Gooneratne  J.  in  Mohideen v."
"Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra). Also not called upon and not"
"considered are the factors such as whether or not the non-compliance is visited"
"with some penalties, or the statute provides for a contingency of non-compliance"
"of the time limit provision or any practical inconvenience and injustice to parties"
"who have no control over those entrusted with a statutory duty and deprivation"
"of their statutory rights at their no fault."
"[75] In the light of the above discussion, I am of the opinion that, the portion of"
"the statement of Gooneratne J. in question cannot have the character of a ratio"
"decidendi but a mere casual statement or observation or remark which does not"
"form the part of the legal principle upon which the case was decided and thus, it"
"has no authoritative value."
"[76] For those reasons, I have no reasons to disagree with the decisions of Janak"
"de Silva, J. in Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner General of"
