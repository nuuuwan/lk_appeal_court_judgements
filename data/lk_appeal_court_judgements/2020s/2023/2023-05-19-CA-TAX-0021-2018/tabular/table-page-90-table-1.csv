"Charging section & Machinery section"
"[235] The rule of construction of a charging section is that before taxing any"
"person, it must be shown that he falls within the ambit of the charging section"
"by clear words used in the section. A charging section or a provision imposing"
"a penalty has to be construed strictly. If a person has not been brought within"
"the  ambit  of  the  charging  section  by  clear  words,  he  cannot  be  taxed  at  all."
"(Indian Banksâ€™ Association, Bombay v. M/s. Devikala Consultancy Services, AIR"
"2004 SC 2015). On the other hand, a machinery provision deals with calculation"
"and  collection  of  tax  and  the  said  provision  is  independent  of  the  charging"
"provision."
"[236] Section 3 (1) of the Act deals with the following two distinct elements for"
"the purpose of imposition of the NBT, namely:"
"1.  The first element relates to the charging section by which the NBT is charged"
