"is time barred by operation of the law for the following two reasons:"
"1.  There  cannot  be  a  valid  assessment  unless  notice  of  assessment  has  been"
"served on the taxpayer and the assessment was in fact made on 29.11.2013"
"and  received  by  the  Appellant  on  03.12.2013.  The  so-called  letter  dated"
"10.09.2013 is only  the source document which is referred to in the notice of"
"assessment  under  DLN  12329404101  (Document  Location  Number)  which"
"does  not  contain  a  charge  number  and  thus,  it  is  not  the  assessment.  The"
"computerized notice of assessment dated 29.11.2013 is the assessment which"
"had been served on the taxpayer after the expiry of the time bar for making"
"the assessment in contravention of section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act."
