"additional income and other information with an explanation for not disclosing"
"them  earlier,  were  sent  to  the  assessor  by  the  taxpayer,  the  assessor  did  not"
"communicate in writing with his reasons for not accepting the return as required"
"by section 93(2) of the Act. The Respondents (Revenue)  were unable to to prove"
"that a letter dated 04.04.79 was sent to the taxpayer with reasons for rejecting"
"the returns, and accordingly, the notice of assessment dated 30.03.1979  was sent"
"to  the  taxpayer  without communicating  reasons  for  not  accepting the  return  in"
"total non-compliance with the provisions of section 93(2) and 93(C)(3) of the Inland"
"Revenue Act."
"[97]  In  the  present  case,  however,  the  letter  of  the  assessor  dated  09.09.2013"
"states “I hereby inform you that the said return of income has not been accepted"
"for the reasons given below” (See -letter of the assessor dated 09.09.2013 at page"
"3  of  the  Document  File).  There  there  was  no  complaint  whatsoever  that  the"
"reasons for not accepting the return were not communicated to the Appellant by"
"the  assessor,  and 
in  fact,  the 
letter  dated  09.09.2013  with  reasons  for  not"
"accepting  the  return  has  been  sent  to  the  Appellant  before  the  notice  of"
"assessment dated 29.11.2013 was sent to the Appellant. Accordingly, I am of the"
"view that the circumstances under which Victor Perera, J.  made the above quoted"
"statement is not applicable to the facts of the present case."
"[98] It is to be noted that the assessor and the Commissioner General of Inland"
"Revenue appealed to the Supreme Court against the said order of the Court of"
"Appeal  which  issued  a  writ  of  certiorari  quashing  the  assessment  of  tax  (See-"
