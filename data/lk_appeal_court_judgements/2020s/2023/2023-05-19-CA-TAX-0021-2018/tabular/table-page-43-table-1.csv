"[115]In Honig & Others (Administrators of Emmanuel (Honig) v. Sarsfield (H. M."
"I
nspector of Taxes) (supra), some weeks before the time limit in section 40 of the"
"Taxes  Management  Act,  1970,  the 
Inspector  of  Taxes  on  16.03.1970  raised"
"assessments against the administrators of Emanuel Honig by signing certificates"
"to that effect where he entered into the assessment book stating that he had made"
"assessments  on  the  administrators.  The  notices  of  assessment  were  issued  on"
"16.03.1970 but did not reach the administrators until after 07.04.1970. The time"
"bar for the making of the assessment was 06.04.1970 under sections 34(1) and 40"
"of the Taxes Management Act, 1970."
"[116]  The  Special  Commissioners  held  that  (i)  the  assessments  were  made  on"
"16.03.1970 when the duly authorised Inspector signed the certificate and that they"
"were not out of time. The Chancery Division, dismissing the appeal held that the"
"making  of  an  assessment  was  not  dependent  on  the  service  of  the  notice  of"
"assessment, as the assessment was made on 16.03.1970 and so, it was within the"
"time limit prescribed by section 34 and 40(1) of the Act. The Court of Appeal in"
"dismissing the appeal held that the assessments were made on 16.03.1970 when"
"the 
Inspector  of  Taxes  signed  the  certificate 
in  the  assessment  book. 
  The"
"fundamental question that arose for decision before the Court of Appeal was this:"
"Is an assessment effectively made until notice of it has been given to the taxpayer?"
"Section  29(1)  of  the  Act  provided  as  follows:  “Except  as  otherwise  provided,  all"
"assessments for tax shall be made by the Inspector. Section 29(5) provided that"
"notice of any assessment of tax shall be served on the person assessed, and shall"
"state  the  time  within  which  any  appeal  against  the  assessment  may  be  made."
"Section 29(6) provided that “After the notice of assessment has been served on"
"the  person  assessed,  the  assessment  shall  not  be  altered  except  in  accordance"
"with the express provisions of the Taxes Acts..”"
"[117] The Court of Appeal in Honig answered the question whether an assessment"
"effectively  made  until  notice  of  it  has  been  given  to  the  taxpayer    and  held  at"
"paragraph F:"
