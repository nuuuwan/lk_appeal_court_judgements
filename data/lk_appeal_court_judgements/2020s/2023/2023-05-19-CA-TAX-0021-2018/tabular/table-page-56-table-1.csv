"Retrospective and prospective amendments"
"[152] It is relevant to note that a  substantive law defines and provides for rights,"
"duties and liabilities whereas the procedural law deals with the application of"
"substantive law to particular cases (Izhar Ahmed Khan v. Union of India AIR 1962"
"1052) (e.g. law of evidence or practice of courts or limitation)."
"General Rule- Presumption against retrospective construction- prospective effect"
"[153] There is a presumption of retrospective construction and a presumption"
"against retrospective construction. The cardinal principle of construction is that"
"every statute is prima facie, prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary"
"implication made to have a retrospective operation (Keshvan v. State of Bombay"
"AIR 1951 SC). The general rule is that all statutes other than those which are"
"merely declaratory or which relate only to matters of procedure or of evidence"
"are prima facie prospective (TAXMANNâ€™S Interpretation of Statutes, p. 860). The"
"retrospective  operation  should  not  be  given  to  a  statute  unless  by  express"
"words  or  necessary  implication,  it  appears  that  this  was  the  intention  of  the"
"legislature. (Supra, p. 840, 846)."
