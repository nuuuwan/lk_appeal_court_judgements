"the judgment of the Supreme Court is inapplicable in the present case and  it"
"should not be followed for the following reasons."
"1.  The Supreme Court held that the assessment was time barred on the basis"
"that the return of income had already been submitted by the assessee when"
"the Act, No. 19 of 2009 came into operation, and thus, the assessee could"
"not benefit from the amending Act while the assessor could benefit from"
"the provisions that extended the time within which the assessment could"
"be  submitted.  In  the  present  case,  however,  the  assessee  filed  its  return"
"after the Amending Act came into force and the time period to make the"
"assessment had not expired by the time the amending Act came into force;"
"2.  The Supreme Court considered the combined effect of section 106(1) and"
"section 163(5) of the Act and thus, the basis of the judgment related to the"
"inability of the taxpayer to benefit from the extended period of time given"
"to  the  taxpayer  to  file  return  while  the  assessor  could  benefit  from  the"
"extended  period  given  to  make  the  assessment,  since  the  taxpayer  had"
"already filed return by the time the Act. No. 19 of 2000 came into force;"
"3.  The intention of the legislature by amending section 163(5) of the principal"
"enactment  by  the  Act  No.  22  of  2011  was  to  grant  a  right  only  to  the"
"assessor, and thus, the assessor has a right to make the assessment within"
"the extended period of time."
