"the statement made by Samarakoon C.J. in  D.M.S. Fernado v. A.M. Ismail (supra)"
"at pp. 193-194:"
"“A duty is now imposed on the Assessor not only to give reasons for non-"
"acceptance of a return, but also to communicate them to the assessor. The"
"primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor will"
"bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination"
"whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly"
"unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as “a protective"
"measure”. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due"
"to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a “return till”"
"the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a"
"grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to"
"make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of"
"this unhappy practice was to pressurize the taxpayer to such an extent that he"
"was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a"
"measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when"
"an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of"
"t
i
me he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision"
"rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be"
"communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the"
"written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure"
"that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly, the"
"communication of the reason at the relevant time is the indication of its"
"compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of fixing the"
"Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop and change"
"thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should"
"s
tate his reasons and communicate them h. His reasons must be communicated"
"a
t
 
o
r
 
about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any later"
"communication would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment”"
"(
