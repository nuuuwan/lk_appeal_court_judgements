"[136] Dr. Felix submitted that even if the assessment was made on 09.09.2013, as"
"asserted  by  the  Respondent,  the  applicable 
law  for  the  year  of  assessment"
"2010/2011  commended  on  01.04.2010  and  ended  on  31.03.2011  and  thus,  the"
"statutory amendment applied in respect of the said year of assessment was the"
"Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, which applied to any year of"
"assessment on or after 1, April 2009.  He further submitted that the Inland Revenue"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No.  19  of  2009,  which  changed  the  time  bar  relating  to"
"assessment, but it did not provide that the amendment made to section 163(5) of"
"the principal enactment had retrospective effect. Dr. Felix strenuously argued that"
"the 
Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act.  No.  22  of  2011  came 
into  effect  on"
"01.04.2011,  which  further  changed  the  time  bar  relating  to  assessment,  but  it"
"applied to any year of assessment on or after 01.04.2011. On that basis, he argued"
"that  the amendment made to section 163(5) of the Act, No. 22 of 2011 had no"
"retrospective effect in terms of section 56 of the said Act."
"[137] He further submitted that the said amendment was prospective in nature,"
"which has no effect on any year of assessment prior to 1, April 2011 and section"
"56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 did not provide that"
"the  amendment  made 
to 
section  163(5)  of 
the  principal  enactment  had"
"retrospective  effect.  He  submitted  that  even  if  the  assessment  was  made  on"
"09.09.2013, it was time barred within two years from the end of the relevant year"
"of  assessment  2010/2011  (i.e.,  by  31.03.2013)  in  terms  of  section  163(5)  of  the"
"Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 10 of 2009. He relied on the decision of the"
"Supreme Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue SC"
"Appeal No. 46/2016 decided on 16.12.2021 in support of his contention."
"[138] On the other hand, Mr. Balapatabendi submitted that (i) the  Inland Revenue"
"Act, No. 10 of 2006 provided that no assessment shall be made after the expiry of"
"18 months from the end of the immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e."
"until 30th September of the following year; (ii) this section was amended by the"
"Act, No. 19 of 2009 which provided that no assessment shall be made after the"
"expiry of a period of 2 years from the end of the immediately succeeding year of"
"assessment 
(i.e.  until  31st  March  of  the  second  year 
following  the  year  of"
"assessment); (iii) a further amendment was made by the Act. No. 22 of 2011, which"
"came into operation on 01.04.20111, which provided that no assessment shall be"
"made after the expiry of a period of 2 years from the 30th day of November of the"
"immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e. until 30th November of the second"
"year following the year of assessment); (iv) the return was submitted on 08.11.2011"
"and the Inland Revenue Act was amended by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 and thus, the"
