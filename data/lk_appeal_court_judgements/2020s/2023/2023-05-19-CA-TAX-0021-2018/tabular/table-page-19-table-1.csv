"10 to the effect that the appeal shall be disposed of speedily within a period of"
"270 days from the date of the commencement of the sittings for the hearing of"
"the appeal. But the legislature imposed no drastic and painful penal consequence"
"or  other  consequence  of  non-compliance,  including  prohibitory  or  negative"
"words in section 10, rendering the determination of the appeal null and void for"
"non-compliance with the time limit specified in section 10. In my view, they are"
"not intended to make the parties suffer from the failure of the Commission to"
"make the determination within the time limit specified in section 10 of the Tax"
"Appeals Commission Act."
"[47] Any procedural retrospective operation  of a provision, in my view,  cannot"
"take away the rights of parties who have no control over those entrusted with the"
"duty of making determination within the time limit specified in section 10. The"
"retrospective operation of section 10 without any penal or other consequence of"
"non-compliance, by itself, cannot be treated as a factor in determining that the"
"legislature intended that the failure to adhere to the time limit specified in section"
"10 is mandatory."
"Avoidance of doubt clause"
"[48] Dr. Felix, further relied on the avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15 of the"
"Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act  to  argue  that  section  15  would  be  rendered"
"nugatory if the provisions of section 10 are considered to be directory. A perusal"
"of section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013"
"reveals that it relates to appeals that have been transferred to the Commission"
"from  the  Board  of  Review,  and  provides  that  the  TAC  shall  have  the  power  to"
"make a determination in respect thereof, beyond twelve months granted for its"
"determination  of  appeals  by  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act  No.  23  of"
"2011."
"[49] It seems to me that the avoidance of doubt clause in section 15 applies to"
"appeals transferred from the  Board of Review and not to new appeals directly"
"filed before the TAC. On the other hand, the intention of the legislature in section"
"15 is to empower the Commission to hear an appeal transferred to it by the Board"
"of Review under section 10 of the Act, notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve"
"months granted for its determination by the Tax Appeals (Amendment) Act, No."
"4  of  2012.  It  seems  to  me  that  section  15  manifests  that  the  legislature  never"
"intended that the time period specified in the general scheme of the Tax Appeals"
