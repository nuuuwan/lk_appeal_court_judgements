"In  the  case  of  Dhanayake  and  others  vs  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation"
"[2005]  1  Sri  LR  67  Saleem  Marsoof  J  quoted  the  above  passage  with"
"approval."
"The respondents have pointed out that there is no reserve or reservations by"
"the name of “Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve.”  No long-term lease, permit or grant"
"has  been  issued  to  5th  –  9th  respondents.    They  have  been  permitted  to  be"
"quarried  as  per  the  plans  approved  by  the  4th  respondent.  The  petitioners"
"have  not  produced  copies  of  such  permission  or  grants.  Therefore,  the"
"allegation of the petitioners that the respondents had violated the provisions"
"of  the  State  Land  Ordinance  or  the  Land  Development  Ordinance  is  not"
"correct."
"The  Department  of  Archaeology  has  verified  that  there  are  no  artefacts  of"
"archaeological  value,  and  therefore,  they  have  made  no  objection  to  the"
"issuance  of  the  licence  to  the  quarry.      The  position  of  the  petitioners  that"
"the respondents are destroying the valuable artefacts is also not correct."
"The  respondents  obtained 
the  Environmental 
Impact  Assessment 
(EIA)"
"report  from  the  CEA  before  the  issuance  of  the  licence.    After  the  5th  –  9th"
"respondents  and  some  other  persons  had  submitted  the  applications  to"
"quarry  upon  the  said  land,  the  respondents  made  an  inspection,  and  the"
"area of rock was demarcated on a plan made by the 4th respondent.  Copies"
"of the initial plan for the 5th – 9th respondents are marked 4R10 – 4R14, and"
"the maps demarcating where the quarrying takes place with regard to each"
"respondent  are  marked  4RX1  –  4RX5.  The  allegation  that  the  5th  to  9th"
"respondents  were  granted  permission  to  quarry  without  an EIA  is  factually"
"incorrect."
"As the title to the land is not divested or alienated, there is no breach of any"
"provisions of the State Land Ordinance or the Land Development Ordinance."
"The  petitioners  sought  to  prohibit  issuing  licences  under  the  Mines  and"
"Minerals Act.  No licence is required for metal crushing."
"Though  the  petitioners  were 
invited  to  participate 
in  the  meeting 
that"
"happened among all the respondents and other stakeholders, the petitioners"
"of  their  own  volition  refrained 
from  participating 
in  the  meeting. 
  The"
"petitioners  were  also 
invited 
to  participate 
in 
the 
inspection  and 
test"
"explosion. However, of their own choice, they did not participate in the said"
"meeting  and  test  explosion.    The  respondents  have  clearly  demonstrated"
"that there were no issues from any residents in that area with regard to the"
"blasts."
