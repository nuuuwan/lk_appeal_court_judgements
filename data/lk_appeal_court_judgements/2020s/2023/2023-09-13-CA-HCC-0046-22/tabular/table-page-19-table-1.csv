"The learned High Court Judge has considered the delay in making the complaint"
"and  justified  it  with  proper  reasoning.  After  having  considered  the  defence"
"version, it had been determined that it cannot be accepted or creates any doubt"
"in the prosecution case."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  although  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was"
"somewhat misdirected when he determined that there  is no direct evidence of"
"this incident, it is not a reason to consider that as a misdirection that has caused"
"any prejudice towards the appellant."
"It is my view that this is a clear case  where even if the evidence of the victim"
"child  is  disregarded,  the  prosecution  has  proved  the  case  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt  against  the  appellant,  based  on  eyewitness  account  and  other  evidence"
"led in this trial."
"Although I find no merit in this appeal, it is with regret I need to note that our"
"trial  Judges  have  failed  to  grasp  the  importance  of  correctly  adhering  to  the"
"provisions  of  Evidence  (Special  Provisions)  Act  No.  32  of  1999  (hereinafter"
"sometimes referred to as the Act). Clearly, these provisions have been enacted as"
"an exception to the rules of evidence, considering the rights and the vulnerability"
"of a child in criminal proceedings."
"Under the provisions, a child can be allowed to testify without causing an oath"
"or affirmation to be administered under certain circumstances."
"The provisions have been made as to the applicability of the probable age of a"
"child in cases where the age of a child is not certain."
"For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant section 163A which"
"was inserted immediately after section 163 of the Evidence Ordinance, which is"
"the relevant section in relation to video recorded interview with a child that may"
"be used as evidence in a trial."
