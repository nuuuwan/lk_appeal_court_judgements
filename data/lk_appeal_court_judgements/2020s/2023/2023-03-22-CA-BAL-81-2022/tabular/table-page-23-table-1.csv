"ISIS. These facts alone do not warrant an incarceration for over 3+ years, especially in"
"a context where an indictment has not been served. On the one hand, the suspect has"
"exercised  his  freedom  of  expression  and  on  the  other,  the  prosecution  has  failed  to"
"gather  any substantive evidence during the  course  of the said  3+  years to justify the"
"continuation of the incarceration. The mere sharing of a video which express a view or"
"amounts to a seeming act that threatens national security does not warrant a period of"
"incarceration  exceeding  46  months.    The  inability  of  the  respondents  to  forward  an"
"indictment for 3+ years further points to the lack of possibility to begin a prosecution"
"based on the material available against the suspect."
"The learned DSG’s contention that the suspect should not be enlarged on bail and that"
"the delay in receiving the government analyst’s report has caused the delay in tying up"
"the investigations is unacceptable. As stressed above, for the true potential of Act, No."
"12 of 2022 to be realized, all arms of the law enforcement in the country must work in"
"tandem to expedite justice. While the contention of the DSG on the delay may have been"
"a sufficient ground for continued incarceration under the PTA prior to its amendment"
"in 2022, as the law and the state of affairs stand today, it is not.  Given the abundance"
"of technology to expedite proceedings at the hand of law enforcement units, the judiciary"
"cannot endorse restriction of personal liberty for delays on the part of the prosecution"
"to build a substantive case against a person. Such an endorsement would be contrary"
"to  justice  and  tantamount  to  oppression  of  the  suspect.  As  such  the  position  of  the"
"prosecution is not “weighty” when compared to the submissions of the petitioner in light"
"of the legislative intention behind the application of Act, No. 12 of 2022."
"The law does not allow for the construing of inordinate delays and prolonged period of"
"incarceration as a form of punishment and thus, the law enforcement units have a duty"
"to  ensure  the  protection  of  the  personal  liberty  and  the  fundamental  rights  of  an"
"individual  to  be  free  from  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention.  The  prolonged  period  of"
"incarceration has aggrieved the family members of the suspect and has also squandered"
"the youth of the suspect as he has spent an inordinate number of years in detention"
"without a firm indication of being indicted and being able to present averments against"
"such indictment. This is a clear manifestation of contravention of the basic rights of the"
"suspect and a blatant disregard of justice, a very fact that is sought to be tamed by the"
"advent of Act, No. 12 of 2022. As I mentioned above and in line of the thinking of the"
