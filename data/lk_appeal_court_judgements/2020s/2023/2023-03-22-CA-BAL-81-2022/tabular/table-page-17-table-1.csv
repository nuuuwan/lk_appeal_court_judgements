"Therefore,  in  both  the  second  instance  and  the  fourth  instance,  an  applicant  must"
"satisfy the High Court (in the second instance) and the Court of Appeal (in the fourth"
"instance), as to the existence of exceptional circumstances.  Ultimately it will be up to"
"the 
judicial  discretion 
to  decide  whether 
the  exceptionality  contended  warrants"
"admittance of the applicant into bail."
"Exceptional Circumstances"
"As  examined  in  the  previous  section,  the  PTA  as  amended  by  Act,  No.  12  of  2022"
"explicitly recognized four instances in which a person arrested under the PTA is granted"
"the opportunity to make an application to be admitted to bail. In doing so, the legislature"
"designates two occasions (second instance and fourth instance) whereby the Court of"
"Appeal  or  High  Court  may,  in  exceptional  circumstances  release  a  suspect  on  bail."
"Alternatively, it must be noted that the lack of mention of ‘exceptionality’ in the first and"
"third instances should not lose its importance as well."
"However,  the  Act,  No.  12  of  2022  does not  indicate the manner in  which  exceptional"
"circumstance needs to be interpreted. In general terms, an ‘exceptional circumstance’"
"is an instance which occurs out of the ordinary, unavoidably or unexpectedly. For the"
"purpose of the Act, No. 12 of 2022, it is clear that the presiding judge in the PTA matter"
"has  the  sole  power  and  discretion  to  decide  instances  that  fall  within  the  ambit  of"
"exceptional circumstances."
"For example; if a bail application is pleaded on the ground of severe health condition of"
"an accused/suspect, the court must be satisfied that the said health condition is either"
"life-threatening or that such a health condition cannot be treated while in remand which"
"poses the threat of aggravating the illness. Further, in instances of oppressiveness and"
"lack  of  progress in  serving  an  indictment,  the  courts  may  be  enlightened  to  consider"
"such oppressiveness and inordinate delays as exceptional circumstance to grant bail."
"The Act, No. 12 of 2022, to a certain extent, recognizes the values endorsed in human"
"freedom and fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the country. Hence,"
"it  is  the  duty  of  the  court  to  prevent  the  stringent,  mechanical  and  monotonous"
"application  of  rules  and 
instead,  espouse  the 
judicious  use  of  discretion 
in  an"
"appropriate manner based on the facts and circumstances of each case. Exceptionality"
