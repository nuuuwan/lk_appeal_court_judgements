"circumstances stating that ‘It cannot be  the  norm; it is not  the rule it is very much the"

"the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be justifiable”. Therefore, when presented with a bail"
"application  under  the  Act,  No.  12  of  2022,  the  presiding  judge  may  also  consider"
"whether the PTA has been applied in the correct manner so that the true intention of"
"the new amendment is fully realized. The observation made by a five bench judges in"
"the  Supreme  Court  in  Attorney  General  Vs  Sumithipala  2006  2  SLR  126  is  more"
"appropriate to the present context. “A judge cannot under a thin guise of interpretation"
"usurp the functions of the legislature to achieve a result that the judge thinks is desirable"

"The following passage of the Lord Denning MR in the case of Ward vs James (1965) 1"
"ALL ER 563 at 571 is precisely applicable to the context of present day. His Lordship"
