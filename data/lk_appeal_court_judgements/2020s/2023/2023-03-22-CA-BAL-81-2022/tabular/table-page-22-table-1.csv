"avenues  such  as  the  Constitution.  Similarly,  the  designation  of  the  four  instances  of"
"bail as envisioned in Act, No. 12 of 2022 does not apply to bail matters governed under"
"the Bail Act. Therefore, the exclusion of the Bail Act on matters falling under the PTA as"
"amended does not exclude the application of the principles of the law governing bail. As"
"expounded  above,  the  core  principles  that  underlie  the  concept  of  bail  which  can  be"
"derived from case law emanating from the Bail Act can serve as guidance to the exercise"
"of judicial discretion under the PTA as amended."
"Although, the learned DSG has cited Wickremasinghe Vs A.G (supra) to rule out the"
"application of the Bail Act and to justify the long period of incarceration of the suspect,"
"this Court would like to draw attention to the rationale of the case where it was held"
"that “Purpose of remanding a suspect /accused is, in my view to ensure his appearance"
"in court on each and every day that the case is called in court. If the Court feels that he"
"would appear in Court after his release on bail, court should enlarge him on bail. Court"
"should not remand a suspect/accused in order to punish him”. (At page146). This case"
"sheds  light  on  one  of  the  core  principles  of  granting  bail  to  a  suspect  which  is  that"
"refusal to grant bail cannot be construed as a form of punishment to the suspect. In an"
"instance where the court is convinced that the suspect will not abscond and will appear"
"before the court where necessary, the court has the discretion to consider such factors"
"in determining whether to refuse or grant such persons on bail in the interest of justice."
"Furthermore,  it is observed  by  this  Court  that  the  learned DSG has  not  objected  the"
"grant of bail to the suspect on any substantial grounds like the possibility of the suspect"
"absconding,  tampering  with  witnesses,  posing  a  threat  to  the  national  security  and"
"communal harmony or the possibility of the suspect reoffending if released out on bail."
"The learned DSG has failed to convince this Court of the reasons as to why the court"
"should not enlarge the suspect on bail. The learned DSG has merely announced that"
"the  investigations  are  almost  over  as  they  are  still  awaiting  the  government  analyst"
"report and has mentioned that the indictment will be served in the near future, albeit"
"an exact time frame has not been provided which leaves this Court with the impression"
"that the time of indicting the suspect is still indefinite."
"Against  such  a  submission,  the  facts  available  before  this  Court  presents  that  the"
"suspect has shared a video and information via an entity that is alleged to have links to"
