"11"
"First Instance"
"The first instance stipulates if the trial has not commenced after the expiration of twelve"
"months from the date of arrest, the Court of Appeal may release such person on bail."
"Here is an instance where an indictment is yet to be served on the person and the person"
"has been languishing in prison for more than twelve months since his arrest under the"
"PTA.  The  legislative  prescription  of  twelve  month  coupled  with  the  absence  of  an"
"indictment serves as a criterion as to when the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal can"
"be  invoked  under  Section  15B.  If  not,  the  Court  of  Appeal  will  be  inundated  with"
"litigation under the PTA. If either one of the criteria is not fulfilled, for example if twelve"
"months  have  not  expired  or  indictment  has  been  served,  an  applicant  cannot  come"
"before the Court of Appeal under Section 15B. For such applicants, recourse is available"
"before the High Court, as will be discussed later."
"It is pertinent to note that, the legislature has not provided for the grounds upon which"
"the  grant  or  refusal  to  grant  bail  may  be  considered  by  the  Court  of  Appeal.  It  only"
"delineates the criteria by which an applicant is eligible to apply for bail. The question of"
"whether bail ought to be granted or not rests with the judicial discretion of the presiding"
"judge."
"To  that  end,  some  guidance  can  be  taken  from  existing  judicial  precedent  and  legal"
"principles  pertaining  to  bail.  While  there  is  a  wealth  of  judicial  precedent  on  the  law"
"relating to bail, the celebrated judgment of R v Toussaint 12 NLR 65, made the following"
"observation: “no doubt the main object of requiring bail is to ensure the attendance of"
"a person charged with a criminal offence, but there are other considerations which the"
"Court in the exercise of its discretion generally takes into account. The first accused is"
"charged  with  very  serious  offence  punishable  with  long  terms  of  imprisonment”.  The"
"judgment quoted the words of Grener AJ in Etrenne Barromet v Edmond Allain, Ellis"
"and Blackburn, p. 1 “the Court has discretion to admit accused persons to bail in all"
"cases, but in exercising that discretion the nature of the charge, the evidence by which"
"it is supported, and the sentence which by law may be passed in the event of a conviction"
"are in general the most important ingredients for the guidance of the Court, and where"
"these are weighty the Court will not interfere.”"
