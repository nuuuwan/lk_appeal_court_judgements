"Third Instance",""
"The third instance stipulates that if the trial has not commenced after the expiration of",""
"twelve months since the forwarding and filing of the indictment in the High Court, the",""
"High  Court  may  consider  releasing  such  person  on  bail.  This  provision  encounters  a",""
"situation where an indictment has been forwarded and filed. Hence this is a distinctly",""
"different scenario to the first instance discussed above.",""
"In the third instance, jurisdiction of the High Court to grant bail can be invoked upon",""
"the  fulfilment  of  two  criteria,  namely,  the  serving  and  filing  of  indictment  and  the",""
"absence in the commencement of trial even after the expiration of twelve months since",""
"such  filing.  The  similarity  between  the  first  instance  and  the  third  instance  is  that",""
"neither stipulates any grounds for consideration in exercising the judicial discretion to",""
"either grant or refuse to grant bail. Nevertheless, as discussed in the previous part, some",""
"guidance  can be  derived  from existing precedent and  principles subject to the caveat",""
"that each case ought to be decided on its peculiar facts and circumstances. Yet a slight",""
"dissimilarity is present in the wording of the first and third instances.",""
"In  the  first  instance,  the  legislative  language  is  ‘the  Court  of  Appeal  may  release.’.",""
"However,  in the third  instance  the  language  used  is  ‘the High Court may consider to",""
"release.’.  This  slight  variation","is  a  recognition  of  the  difference  between  the  two"
"situations where in the former (first instance), an indictment is yet to be served. In the",""
"latter  scenario  (third  instance),  the  Attorney  General  has  perused  the  IBEs  and  has",""
"decided that the evidence against the accused has a reasonable prospect of securing a",""
"conviction  or  that  there  exists  a  prima  facie  case  to  proceed  with the  prosecution.  In",""
"such  a  context,  the  High  Court  Judge  has  discretion  to  either  consider  the  bail",""
"application or refuse to do so. However, this does not mean that the High Court judge",""
"ought to dismiss the application in limine. It is a mere expression that the burden on",""
"the applicant requesting for bail is slightly higher in the third instance, than it is in the",""
"first instance. Because in the latter, the prosecution is yet to decide whether a case can",""
"be sustained against the suspect.",""
