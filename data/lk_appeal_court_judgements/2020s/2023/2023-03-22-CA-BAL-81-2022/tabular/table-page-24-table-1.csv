"lawmakers, it has been a perennial tension though all civilizations â€“ security, on the one"
"hand, and liberty, freedom of an individual on the other. This Court has to arrive at an"
"equilibrium between these two, a sensitive balance which has to be made in relation to"
"contextual factors."
"Hence,  taking  into  consideration  the  lack  of  a  rational  basis  to  refuse  to  enlarge  the"
"suspect  on  bail  and  the  prolonged  period  of  incarceration  of  the  suspect  without  an"
"indictment being served, brings  the  suspect within the framework  laid under  Section"
"15B  of  the  PTA  as  amended,  thereby  enabling  the  suspect  to  be  granted  bail  by  the"
"jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Therefore, in light of the above contentions, it is the"
"considered view of this Court, the suspect should be enlarged on bail."
"Thus, this Court, while urging the authorities to expedite the matter, orders the suspect"
"to be enlarged on bail upon the following conditions."
