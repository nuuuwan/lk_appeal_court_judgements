"For the above reasoning, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has"
"found the appellant guilty of the 1st count preferred against him with a sound"
"basis,  and  after  analyzing  the  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  in  its  correct"
"perspective."
"Hence, I find no reason to interfere with the conviction of the appellant for the"
"1st count preferred against him."
"I find that there had been a misdirection as to the acquittal of the appellant on"
"the 3rd count, which is also a count where the appellant has misappropriated the"
"sum mentioned in the pay order marked P-02 on the wrong premise that the 3rd"
"count  relates  to  a  company  called  Jayawansha  Construction.  However,  since"
"there is no appeal in that regard, I would make no order in relation to the said"
"misdirection."
"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well  considered  the  mitigatory"
"factors urged on behalf of the appellant in sentencing him for 30 months rigorous"
"imprisonment, which is according to law and the facts and circumstances of the"
"case."
"The appeal is dismissed as I find no merit in the ground of appeal urged."
"Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence dated 12th December 2019 by the"
"learned High Court Judge of Colombo is affirmed."
