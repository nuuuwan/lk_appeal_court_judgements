"about 20 meters away from the house. Just after the midnight, the informant"
"has pointed to a person who is coming towards them, and after identifying him"
"as Ananda, has discreetly left them."
"PW-01  along  with  the  mentioned  officer  Sampath  have  confronted  the  person"
"and after identifying themselves as police officers had questioned him. According"
"to  the  evidence  of  PW-01,  after  they  identified  themselves,  the  person  had"
"behaved strangely and had started to sweat and shiver. Upon checking the said"
"person, PW-01 has recovered a blue-coloured cellophane parcel with a brown-"
"coloured  powder  in  his  left  trouser  pocket.  Inspecting  the  contents,  he  has"
"identified  the  brown-coloured  powder  as  heroin  through  his  experience  as  a"
"narcotics officer. Accordingly, the person whom the witnesses have identified in"
"the Court as the appellant had been arrested 10 minutes passed midnight, that"
"is to say, early hours of 4th October 2007."
"It had been his evidence that when questioned, the appellant informed him of a"
"person called Shiran Harshik as the person from whom he received the heroin"
"and agreed to show the place from where he got it. He has given further evidence"
"to say that although they went in search of the mentioned person, they did not"
"search  the  place  but  decided  to  come  later  and  returned  to  PNB  with  the"
"appellant and the productions taken (at page 85 and 86 of the appeal brief)."
"When weighed at the PNB,  the brown-coloured powder  has shown a weight of"
"186 grams. The witness has explained the procedure followed by him in order to"
"safely  seal  the  productions  and  to  handover  the  productions  to  the  relevant"
"productions officer at the PNB on the following morning."
"When PW-01 was cross-examined on behalf of the appellant, the position taken"
"up  has  been  that  no  heroin  was  recovered  from  the  appellant  and  no  raid  as"
"stated by the witness took place. It has been suggested that the appellantâ€™s son"
"was taken into custody and kept in a place at Bambalapitiya and released only"
"after the appellant came and a parcel found near the salon  was introduced to"
