"Referring to the evidence of PW-02 at page 13 of the judgement (page 415 of the"
"appeal brief), it has been stated that;"
"“ඔහුව අත්අඩංගුවට මෙන ශිරාන් නැෙැත්මතකු සේබන්ධමයන් මෙළිදරව් වූ මතාරුරක්ෂ පරීක්ෂෂා"
"කර ෙත්රවය කාර්යංශයට නැවත පැමිණ ඇත.”"
"It is my view that by looking at the way the learned High Court Judge has referred"
"to the relevant evidence of PW-01 and 02, the learned High Court Judge being a"
"person well learned in the law, had been aware that a statement made to a police"
"officer  which  amounts  to  a  confession  cannot  be  accepted  as  evidence.  This"
"becomes  clear  in  the  way  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  referred  to  the"
"contentious part of the evidence by avoiding the portion where the witnesses say"
"that the appellant informed them that the heroin was supplied by the mentioned"
"Shiran, and that was the reason why they went in search of that person."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  glossed  over  the  contentious  statement  in"
"order to take it out of the meaning of a confession. It is my view that this should"
"not be the way the evidence in a case should be looked at."
"If  the  learned  trial  Judge  had  determined  that  he  is  not  going  to  consider  the"
"parts of the evidence which amounts to a confession and had not used it in a"
"way giving it a different meaning, it can be agreed that such a statement has not"
"prejudiced the mind of the learned High Court  Judge being trained as to how"
"such prejudicial evidence should be disregarded."
"However, I am not in a position to agree with the submissions of the learned DSG"
"that the learned High Court Judge has not been influenced by the evidence of"
"PW-01 and 02 that the appellant disclosed his source of heroin in the judgement."
"I am of the view, that the judgement points to the fact, that although not in a"
"direct manner, it has influenced the final outcome of the judgement, when the"
"learned High Court Judge stated; At page 25 of the judgement (page 427 of the"
"appeal brief) that;"
