"closed  its  case.  It  has  been  decided  to  proceed  with  the  trial  by  adopting  the"
"previous evidence."
"However, the learned High Court Judge has informed the appellant that if he so"
"wishes he can  recall the  relevant  previous witnesses for the purpose of cross-"
"examining them again, obviously, because the relevant witnesses have not given"
"evidence before the learned High Court Judge."
"Accordingly, at the request of the appellantâ€™s Counsel, the learned High Court"
"Judge  has  allowed  the  recalling  of  witness  number  01  and  02  and  subjecting"
"them to cross-examination again, which has resulted in PW-01 and 02 being re-"
"summoned."
"Accordingly, PW-01 has been subjected to cross-examination again. While being"
"cross-examined,  it  has  been  noted  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  that  the"
"said  witness  was  recalled  for  the  purpose  of  observing  the  demeanour  and"
"deportment of the witness. The learned High Court Judge also has questioned"
"the  witness  as  to  the  street  value  of  the  heroin  alleged  to  be  found  in  the"
"possession of the appellant."
"It appears from the proceedings of 25-05-2017, it was the learned High Court"
"Judge who has decided to conclude the further cross-examination on the basis"
"that the Court had the opportunity of observing the demeanor and deportment"
"of the witness. Furthermore, the learned High Court Judge has decided that it"
"was not necessary to recall PW-02 for the purpose of cross-examination, as he"
"has  already  observed  the  demeanour  and  deportment  of  PW-01,  who  was  the"
"raiding officer and there is no need for him to observe PW-02 for that purpose."
"However,  subsequent  to  an  application  made  against  the  order  of  the  learned"
"High Court Judge, the Court of Appeal has given a direction to the Court that"
"PW-02 should also be recalled and the defence should be given the opportunity"
"of  cross-examining  him,  which  has  resulted  in  PW-02  also  being  subjected  to"
"cross-examination for the 2nd time."
