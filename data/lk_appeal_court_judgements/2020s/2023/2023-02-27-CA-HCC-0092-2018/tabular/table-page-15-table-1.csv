"Section 25 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus;"
"25  (1).  No  confession  made  to  a  police  officer  shall  be  proved  as"
"against a person accused of any offence."
"The above provision is subject to exceptions in relation to laws like Prevention of"
"Terrorism Act where a confession becomes relevant if it can be proved that such"
"a confession was not caused by inducement, threat, or promise as provided for"
"in Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"As contend correctly by the learned DSG, although a confessional statement has"
"been admitted in evidence, if it can be shown that the learned trial Judge who"
"pronounced  the  judgement  has  not  made  use  of  such  a  confession  in  his"
"judgement  by  applying  the  correct  legal  principles,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the"
"learned trial Judge has been prejudiced and a fair trial has not been afforded. It"
"was  his  view  that  as  a  person  trained  in  law  a  Judge  is  well  equipped  not  to"
"consider inadmissible evidence in a judgment."
"Under the circumstances, the matter that needs the attention of this Court is"
"whether  the  mentioned  confessional  statement  has  been  considered  by  the"
"learned  trial  Judge  in  his  judgement.  In  the  judgement,  while  analyzing  the"
"evidence of PW-01, at page 08 of the judgement (at page 410 of the appeal brief),"
"the learned High Court Judge has stated as follows;"
"“මෙෙ  සාක්ෂිකරුමේ  පළපුරුද්දට  අනුව  එය  මෙමරායින්  බවට  ෙඳුනාමෙන  ඇත.  සැකකරු"
"අත්අඩංගුවට  මෙන  ඇත.  එෙ  සැකකරු  අධිකරණමේ  සිටින  විත්තිකරු  බවට  ෙඳුනාමෙන  ඇත."
"ඔහුව  අත්අඩංගුවට  ෙැනීමෙන්  පසුව  වාෙනය  එෙ  ස්ථානයට  මෙන්වා  මෙන  එෙ  විත්තිකරු"
"නංවාමෙන  ප්‍රශ්න  කිරීමේදී  ශිරාන්  ොපිෂ්  නැෙති  පුද්ෙලමයකු  සේබන්ධමයන්  මතාරුරක්ෂ"
"ලබාදීමෙන් අනුරුව එෙ මතාරුර පිළිබඳ මසායාබැලීෙට එෙ ස්ථානමයන් පිටව මොස් ඇත.”"
