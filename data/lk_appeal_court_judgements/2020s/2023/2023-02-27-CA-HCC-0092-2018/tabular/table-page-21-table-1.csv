"This is a matter where the offence had alleged to  have been committed on 4th"
"of October 2007. The accused had been released on bail by the High Court on"
"27th of July 2010, nearly 3 years after being in remand custody. The judgement"
"has  been  pronounced  after  a  protracted  trial  on  14-03-2018,  nearly  10  years"
"after  the  alleged  offence.  Up  to  now,  the  appellant  has  been  in  incarceration"
"pending the determination of the appeal for a period of nearly 4 years and 10"
"months."
"Taking all these factors into account, I am of the view that ordering a retrial is"
"not warranted and this is not a fit and fair case to order such a retrial."
"Accordingly,  I  am  of  the  view  that  this  Court  has  no  option  but  to  acquit  the"
"appellant."
"The  appeal  is  allowed,  and  the  appellant  is  acquitted  of  the  charges  preferred"
"against him."
