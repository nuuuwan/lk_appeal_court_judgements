"party not going into the house of the arrested person and searching it creates a"
"doubt whether this was an actual incident or not."
"Referring  to  the  contradictions  in  the  evidence  of  PW-01  and  02,  it  was  the"
"position of the learned President’s Counsel that in his evidence-in-chief, PW-02"
"had stated that PW-01 informed him to get ready for a raid at 2.55 p.m. (at page"
"147 of the appeal brief) while PW-01 has stated that they left for the raid at 2.35"
"p.m. (at page 80 of the appeal brief). He points to the facts that at a later stage"
"of his evidence, PW-02 has stated that they left at 2.15 p.m. (at page 150 of the"
"appeal brief)."
"Furthermore, it was pointed out that PW-02 in his evidence (at page 154 of the"
"appeal brief) has stated that the person they apprehended was wearing a brown"
"coloured trouser and a T-Shirt while, PW-01 (at page 82 of the appeal brief) has"
"stated  that  the  person  apprehended  by  them  was  wearing  a  white  and  grey"
"coloured three-quarter trouser. It was contended that the learned trial Judge has"
"failed to consider these contradictions and infirmities  per se and  inter se, and"
"the learned High Court Judge was not correct when it was determined that there"
"were no contradictions in the prosecution witnesses’ evidence."
"The learned President’s Counsel submitted that the trial Court has permitted the"
"evidence,  which  amounts  to  a  confession  as  to  the  offence  committed  by  the"
"appellant to be admitted at the trial. He pointed out to the evidence in chief by"
"PW-01 where he had stated that after the arrest, the appellant confessed about"
"a person who supplied heroin to him (at page 85 and 86 of the appeal brief). It"
"was contended that even when PW-02 was giving evidence, same confessional"
"statement  alleged  to  have  been  made  by  the  appellant  had  been  admitted  as"
"evidence (at page 159 of the appeal brief)."
"It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that  admitting  such"
"evidence  was  against  the  law,  and  it  was  his  view  that  the  leaned  High  Court"
"Judge has made use of such inadmissible evidence in his judgement in a subtle"
"way, which has denied a fair trial towards his client."
