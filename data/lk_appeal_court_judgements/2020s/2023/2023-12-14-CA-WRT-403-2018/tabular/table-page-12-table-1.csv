"accepted as his fixed salary payment. Nevertheless, according to R1 it is stated"
"with  rational  reasons  that  for  the  purpose  of  EPF  computation  the  acceptable"
"amount to be considered would be Rs. 25,000/- as a payment since 2006/08."
"Thereby, the consideration of service since 1991, as per documents marked P5,"
"P7 & P9, is unacceptable. Yet according to the findings of R1 it could be said that"
"the  6th  respondent  is  entitled  to  claim  for  statutory  dues  for  the  period  from"
"2006/08 to 2015/04."
"Hence, it could be asserted that the 1st to 5th respondents need to reconsider"
"the EPF calculation period and ensure that the statutory nominal contribution"
"percentage for EPF payment is accurately determined in EPF calculations."
"Considering all the above-mentioned this Court deems the 6th respondent can be"
"considered  as  an  employee  of  the  petitioners  and  thereby  is  entitled  to  the"
"payment of EPF. Yet however, it could also be stated that the calculation period"
"and calculation amount of EPF in documents marked P5, P7 & P9 are erroneous."
"Thereby, this Court deems to annul the orders in documents marked P5, P7 &"
"P9.  This  Court  further  directs  the  1st  respondent-  Commissioner  General  of"
"Labour to recalculate the statutory dues as stated in this order."
