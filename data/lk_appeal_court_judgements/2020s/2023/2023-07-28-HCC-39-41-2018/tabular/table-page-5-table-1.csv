"Upon  scrutinizing  PW1's  cross-examination  and  identifying  inconsistencies  and"
"discrepancies  with  his  original  witness  statement,  it  is  clear  that  his  evidence  is  not"
"consistent. For instance, he claims to have witnessed the incident from the bathroom of"
"PW4's  house  during  his  cross-examination,  yet  in  his  original  statement,  he  states  he"
"observed the scene from atop the water tank. Analyzing his testimony in conjunction with"
"PW4's, it's clear that the incident occurring in front of PW4's house couldn't be seen from"
"the  house's  rear.  This  casts  doubt  on  the  credibility  of  PW1's  statement  in  regards  to"
"identifying the Accused."
"This testimony contradicts his initial version, in which he stated that the assailants"
"covered  their  faces  while  shooting,  and  only  removed  their  coverings  when  escaping."
"Furthermore, it's unclear how he identified the 3rd Accused as the one who shot at him"
"and  his  father  if  it  is  to  be  believed  that  their  faces  were  covered  at  the  time  of  the"
"shooting."
"According  to  the  second  son  of  the  deceased,  Nithyantha  Kurukkal  Sivanantha"
"Sarma (known as PW4), who also sustained injuries, he heard a distressing noise from"
"his father's house and therefore he rushed to his fatherâ€™s aid. He was shot in the leg and"
"hand near Thulsai Maadam, shortly after which his jewellery was stolen by the Accused."
"He was subsequently taken to the hospital. He could identify his assailant as they hadn't"
"covered their face. He stated that he did not participate in the identification parade, yet"
"PW6, the Magistrate, recorded that he had participated but didn't identify anyone."
"When we  juxtapose  the  testimonies  of  PW1  and  PW4,  we  find discrepancies. One"
"witness claims he identified the suspects, who were not wearing masks, but failed to do"
"so during the identification parade. Meanwhile, PW1, who did identify the suspects during"
"the parade, had stated that their faces were masked during the shooting. The court thus"
"concludes that the witnesses contradict each other on this crucial point."
"Our central concern is whether PW1 accurately identified the 2nd and 3rd Accused."
"We understand the utmost importance of precise identification in a criminal trial, given"
"the  potential  severity  of  the  penalties,  which  can  significantly  limit  an  individual's"
"freedom."
"In the recent judgment of Dassanayake Lekamlage Somapala alias Gangabada Sudu"
"and  others  v.   Attorney General,  CA  208-210/2011 decided  on  02.09.2014,  his  Lordship"
