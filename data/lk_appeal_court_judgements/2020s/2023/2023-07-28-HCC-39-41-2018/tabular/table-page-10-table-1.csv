"where he was held for 20 days and subjected to torture. He affirmed that no jewellery was"
"seized from him."
"He further testified that he lent the rifle to the 1st and 2nd Accused for hunting"
"pork and that it was returned after 1 ½ hours. He revealed that during this time, Sergeant"
"Kamal informed him about the shooting incident, but the 1st and 2nd Accused had not"
"returned the rifle by then."
"During  cross-examination,  he  admitted  to  lending  the  gun  to  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Accused. It's crucial to note that when the rifle was returned, it was short three magazines"
"and three or four bullets. This rifle was seized by PW17. Furthermore, he acknowledged"
"that no one else witnessed him handing over the rifle — only the 1st and 2nd Accused"
"were aware of it."
"Upon  scrutinizing  the  3rd  Accused's  statement,  we  must  determine  whether  it"
"suggests that the Accused is testifying in a self-exculpatory manner while implicating the"
"co-accused. From his judgment, it is evident that the Trial Judge failed to emphasize the"
"testimony given by the 3rd Accused."
