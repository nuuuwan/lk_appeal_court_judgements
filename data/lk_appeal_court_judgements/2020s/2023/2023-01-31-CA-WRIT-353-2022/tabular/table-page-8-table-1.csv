"The 1st Respondent tendering his affidavit to Court has affirmed that he had issued the quit"
"notice ‘P19’ after reaching the opinion that the Petitioner was in unauthorized occupation of"
"the Land upon consideration of the documents, marked ‘R2(a)’ to ‘R2(h)’. As per paragraph"
"17  of  the  said  affidavit,  the  Gazette  Notification  which  reflects  the  vesting  order,  the"
"(a)Indenture of Lease No.4834, (b)Field Plan No.1074 and (c)the Google maps are among"
"the documents he has perused."
"It  appears  that  the  Kahawatta  Plantations  PLC  has  taken  several  steps  to  notify  the  1st"
"Respondent of the unauthorized occupation of the land by the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent"
"by his letter dated 30.08.2017, marked R19, has requested the Petitioner to show cause on her"
"ownership and however, the Petitioner has failed to respond thereto. (See-‘R20’)"
"Based on all the material made available to Court and the Order of the learned President of"
"the  Labor  Tribunal  in  case  bearing  No.B4707/03,  I  am  convinced  that  the  Competent"
"Authority’s  main  concern  was  to  evict  the  Petitioner  from  the  land  upon  which  the  said"
"official quarters is situated. I am compelled to accept the version of the 1st Respondent that"
"the Petitioner does not dispute the fact that she was given the subject premises as her official"
"quarters. My above reasoning precludes further evaluation of evidence by this Court as in a"
"Trial Court to decide whether the quit notice (‘P19’) does not accurately identify the ‘Land’."
"For the reasons set out above, I am convinced that the 1st Respondent has formed an opinion"
"on a rational basis under Section 3 of the Act that the State is lawfully entitled to the ‘Land’."
"Nevertheless, the Petitioner is privileged under Section 12 of the Act to vindicate her title in"
"an appropriate Court of law."
"Service of quit notice"
"The Petitioner contends that the proof of dispatch of the quit notice by registered post to the"
"correct person and to the address is a mandatory and essential preliminary requirement to"
"establish that the quit notice was deemed to be served on intended recipient. The Sections"
"3(1)(b) and 3(3) deal with the serving quit notices."
