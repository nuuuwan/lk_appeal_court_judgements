"Kumari  Nikaathagoda  vs.  Jayasinghe  Mudiyanselage  Chamila  Indika  Jayasinghe,  Divisional"
"Secretary and others, CA/Writ/293/2017 decided on 18.11.2019 where His Lordship has held;"
"“The principle then is that while no inquiry is needed to form an opinion, there should be a"
"rational basis to form the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land. The rational basis"
"should satisfy the Wednesbury test of reasonableness.  Thus, a Competent Authority would be"
"acting reasonably if he were acting on the basis of a Surveyor General's plan, even if the occupant"
"is claiming prescription. The Competent Authority is not expected to, and indeed is precluded"
"from, carrying out an inquiry”. (Emphasis added)"
