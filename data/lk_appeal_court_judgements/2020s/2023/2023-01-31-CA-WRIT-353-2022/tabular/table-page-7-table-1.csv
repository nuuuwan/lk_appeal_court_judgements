"The learned President of the Labour Tribunal of Balangoda in case bearing No. B/4707/03","",""
"(marked ‘R10’) has observed that the Petitioner had refused to be transferred from the official","",""
"quarters citing personal reasons. The said learned President has taken cognizance of the fact","",""
"that  the  Petitioner’s  claim  for  alleged  improvements  made  to  the  official  quarters  worth","",""
"Rs.180,000.00.  Consequently,","the","learned  Labour  Tribunal  President  has  arrived  at  a"
"conclusion based on overall evidence of the case that the main reason for not complying with","",""
"the transfer orders was the undesirability of the Petitioner to leave the official quarters and","",""
"accordingly, there cannot be any constructive termination of services (See-page 17 of ‘R10’).","",""
"In the circumstances, it can be well assumed that the purpose of issuing the quit notice was","",""
"due to the refusal of the Petitioner to vacate the said official quarters. This Court is unable to","",""
"resolve  with  the  available  material,  the  title  issues  in  respect  of  the  subject  ‘Land’  and","",""
"particularly the arguments of the Petitioner that the land described in the said Transfer Deed","",""
"‘P2’ is not the same Land/Premises described in the schedule of the quit notice. Anyhow, for","",""
"the purpose of a fuller and proper adjudication of the instant Application, it is sufficient to","",""
"identify the ‘Land’ described in the Schedule to the quit notice. The Review Court examining","",""
"the title of parties in an application filed based on the actions or decisions taken under the Act","",""
"would  tend  to  undermine  the  clear  intention  of  the  legislature  which  introduced  mighty","",""
"provisions to recover the possession of State Land in an expeditious manner.","",""
"The ‘Land’ upon which the ejectment is sought has been morefully described in the schedule","",""
"to the quit notice ‘P19’ by sufficiently referring to the boundaries and the extent, although no","",""
"reference has been made to a specific plan. The Register of Settlements, marked ‘P5’ and the","",""
"documents, marked ‘P9(a)’, ‘P10(a)’ and ‘P10(b)’, illustrate that the above official quarters is","",""
"situated  on  the  Hunuwella  Estate  which  belongs  to  the  SLSPC.  I  am unable  to  accept  the","",""
"Petitioner’s argument that the ‘Land’ is private land as the Lot Nos. 311 (Hunuwalawatta)","",""
