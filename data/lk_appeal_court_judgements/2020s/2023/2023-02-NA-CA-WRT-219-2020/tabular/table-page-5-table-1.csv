"The objection of futility has two aspects to it. It is contended that proceeding with"
"this application is futile, firstly, because the license sought to be cancelled is the license"
"issued for the year 2020 (and that the 6th Respondent has already been granted a license"
"for the year 2023) and, secondly, because the relief prayed for, in a sense, has been granted"
"by the undertaking of the Respondent authority to conduct an inquiry."
"The  first  contention  was  raised  in  response  to the  issuance  of  certiorari.  It  was"
"contended that, it is futile for us to quash a license that was issued in 2020 and expired"
"at the end of 2020, as such licenses are legally valid only for a period of one year (vide"
"condition (b) of Excise Notification 849). However, as the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the Petitioner declared in Court that the Petitioner would not be pursuing certiorari, there"
"is no necessity for us to address that objection. Our focus will be only on the second aspect"
"of the futility argument."
"It is argued that the relief that is claimed has in substance already been granted"
"because 
the  Respondent  authorities  have  commenced  an 
inquiry 
into  the  alleged"
"infractions  of  the  law.  The  State  has  undertaken  to  do  so  as  well  as  evident  in  the"
"proceedings dated 31st January 2023 and 9th February 2023 in CA/WRT 415/2020 where"
"similar  relief  was  sought  against  the  6th  Respondent  and  Lion  Brewery  PLC.  The"
"application in CA/WRT 415/2020 was withdrawn subject to the Commissioner General’s"
"undertaking to conduct the inquiry into the alleged infractions."
"However, as evident from the documents in the Brief, this inquiry commenced after"
"the  present  application  was  instituted.  Meaning,  the  Respondent  authorities  began  to"
"take steps to investigate the matter only after the present application was instituted. This"
"delay on their part is attributed to the Covid- pandemic and the consequent lockdowns."
"In  the 
instant  application,  the  Petitioner 
is  continuing  with  his  battle 
for"
"mandamus because the end result of this alleged infraction concerns a loss to the state,"
"which if it is true must be investigated.  We are also mindful that this application is filed"
"in the public interest."
"Therefore,  we  are  of  the  view,  that  this  Court  will  be  better  able  to  determine"
"whether the criteria for the issuance of the writs of mandamus prayed for has been made"
"out once it has the benefit of hearing the parties in the argument stage."
