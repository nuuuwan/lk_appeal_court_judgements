"authority's  decision  to  defer  a  promotion  or  reduce  in  Grade,  such  an  officer  should  first"
"establish his entitlement for the respective promotion."
"In light of the above, I am not convinced that the Arbitrator has given due consideration to"
"the above aspects relating to the purported promotion before he granted reliefs in his Award."
"It is important to note, that the deferment of a promotion or the reduction in Grade is not"
"reflected  in  the  particular  punishments  imposed  against  the  4th  Respondent.  Further,  the"
"reference to arbitration specifically requires the Arbitrator to deal only with the punishment"
"imposed  against  the  4th  Respondent.  The  ‘X2b’  which  was  issued  under  the  hand  of  the"
"Commissioner, does not refer to any alleged  damages caused to the good repute of  the 4th"
"Respondent and his family members. Not only such matters relating to the good repute of the"
"4th Respondent but also the expenses incurred by him when attending the proceedings before"
"the  Industrial  Court  cannot  be  considered  as  matters  referred  to  the  Arbitrator.  In  the"

"further argued on behalf of the 4th Respondent that a fine of a sum of Rs.250,000 has been"
"imposed without conducting a formal disciplinary inquiry, upon a charge sheet, against the"
"4th Respondent. The Petitioner argues that the question whether the said some of Rs.250,000"
"would  be  deducted  from  the  4th  Respondent’s  retiring  gratuity  wasn’t  an  issue  before  the"
"Arbitrator  and  the  Bank  did  not  have  the  opportunity  to  present  any  evidence  or  examine"
"witnesses  in  regard  to  such  issue  as  it  was  not  raised  by  the  4th  Respondent  during  the"
"proceedings before the Arbitrator. However, the fact that remains to be seen is that  a sum of"
"Rs.  250,000  has  been  retained  by  the  Bank  as  a  part  of  the  punishment  imposed  by  them"
