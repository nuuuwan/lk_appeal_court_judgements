"scenario, the view of the Petitioner is that it is not reasonable for the employer to only recover"
"their  losses  from  the  employee  that  was  terminated  while  not  doing  the  same  from  the"
"employee  who  was  retained  for  a  short  while.  Further,  the  Petitioner  relies  on  an  alleged"
"practice of imposing punishment for minor misconduct without a formal inquiry during the"
"disciplinary  process  conducted  by  the  Bank.  Likewise,  the  Petitioner  complains  that  the"
"failure of the Arbitrator to consider, among other evidence, the proof led by the Bank exposing"
"the said practice is irrational. Anyhow, I am not inclined to give a broader interpretation to"
"the related law as suggested by the Petitioner in view of accepting a proposition which hinders"
"conducting a reasonable inquiry before imposing punishments. The overall submissions made"
"on behalf of the Petitioner focuses as to how the Arbitrator has erred in law by not evaluating"
"the evidence laid down on behalf of the Bank."
"When considering the circumstances of this Application, there is ambiguity on whether the"
"Bank  did  deduct  the  said  sum  of  Rs.  250,000  either  from  the  gratuity  or  the  pension"
"entitlements of the 4th Respondent. Even the issue of whether the respective loan mentioned"
"in the said charges has been recovered or not is unclear to this Court. Section 13 of the said"
"Payment of Gratuity Act deals with the forfeiture of gratuity, however, I am of the view that"
"such provisions cannot be applicable due to the above uncertainty. Although the Petitioner"
"indicates that there is an ambiguity between the Sinhala text and the English text of the said"
"section 13, I take the view that the most prudent interpretation that should be given to the"
"provisions of the above section 13 is that an employer is entitled to forfeit gratuity if all the"
"three limbs below mentioned are fulfilled."
