"It was his position that considering all these matters together, it is obvious that"
"a fair trial has not been afforded to the appellant."
"The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  who  represented  the  respondent"
"brought to the notice of the Court that neither the victim child nor her parents"
"went to the police to make a complaint and it was after receiving an anonymous"
"petition the investigations relating to this incident has commenced. It was his"
"position that this in itself shows that the mother and the stepfather, as well as"
"the  victim  child,  have  been  truthful  as  to  the  incidents  that  happened  to  the"
"child."
"It was his position that the reasons for the child not to divulge the incidents to"
"her mother or the stepfather had been clearly established by way of evidence and"
"also the reasons of their reluctance to go to the police due to their dependence"
"on the appellant and his family in their lives."
"The learned DSG insisted that the evidence of the stepfather and the mother of"
"the child are very much consistent with the evidence of the victim child. It was"
"his  position  that  the  amending  of  the  indictment  as  to  the  date  of  offence  to"
"indicate that it occurred during a certain period of time has not prejudiced the"
"appellant  as  his  defence  was  a  complete  denial  of  the  act  and  he  had  all  the"
"possibilities of cross-examining the witnesses and put forward the stand as the"
"amendment has been effected at the very beginning of the evidence given by the"
"victim child."
"He was of the view that the evidence of the JMO was consistent with the evidence"
"of the victim child and his opinion that a sexual abuse as claimed by the victim"
"can occur without any injuries or marks being present should be considered by"
"taking the evidence in its totality, which has been the case in this trial."
"The learned DSG moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the basis that it has"
"no merit."
