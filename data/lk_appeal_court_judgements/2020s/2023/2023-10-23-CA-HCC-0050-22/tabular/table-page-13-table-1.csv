"Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal"
"As  the  grounds  of  appeal  pleaded  by  the  appellant  are  interrelated,  the  said"
"grounds of appeal will be considered together."
"The  evidence  led  at the  trial  when  taken  in  its  totality  becomes  clear  that  the"
"family of the victim child who lived adjacent to the land belonging to the appellant"
"were very much dependent on the appellant and his family in their daily lives."
"Their water source had been a well situated within the appellant’s land, and even"
"they had been dependent on the generosity of the other household members of"
"the appellant’s family to fulfill various needs."
"The  evidence  of  the  child,  the  stepfather  as  well  as  the  mother  needs  to  be"
"considered  in  that  context  as  correctly  considered  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge in her judgement. The learned High Court Judge has clearly considered"
"the evidence of the victim child, namely PW-01 considering the basic yardsticks"
"of  evaluating  such  evidence,  namely  the  tests  of  probability,  consistency,  and"
"spontaneity."
"It  is  clear  from  the  charge  that  it  has  been  formulated  on  the  basis  of  what"
"happened  on  the  day  the  stepfather  observed  the  suspicious  behaviour  of  the"
"child. The learned High Court Judge too has considered the evidence before the"
"trial Court on that basis and not on the basis of several sexual acts committed"
"during the period. The learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence in"
"relation to other similar instances only to test whether the evidence of the victim"
"child and that of the stepfather and the mother can be believed."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  observations  made  by  the"
"investigating officer of the place of the incident and had come to a correct finding"
"that  such  an  incident  as  claimed  by  the  victim  child  and  the  stepfather  can"
"occur."
"The learned High Court Judge has considered the contradictions marked during"
"the testimony of the victim child where she has spoken of several other incidents"
