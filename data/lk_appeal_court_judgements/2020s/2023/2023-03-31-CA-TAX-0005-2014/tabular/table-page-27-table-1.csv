"or  provided  “tertiary  or  vocational  education”  within  the  meaning  of  the"
"Tertiary and Vocational Education Act."
"[56] If it was the intention of the legislature that the VAT exemption is subject"
"to the registration of the educational institution  under the provisions of the"
"Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Act,    it  could  have  easily  referred  to  the"
"Tertiary and Vocational Education Act.  It is not in dispute that the VAT Act or"
"its subsequent amendments make no reference to the Tertiary and Vocational"
"Education  Act.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  placed  sufficient"
"evidence  before  the  TAC  that  it  provides  practical  training  in  the  field  of"
"information technology at all levels of its computer-related degrees, Diplomas"
"and Certificates, the TAC erroneously proceeded to consider the registration"
"by  the  Appellant  under  the 
  Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Act 
is  a"
"mandatory requirement for the VAT exemption."
"[57] The Appellant has taken up the position that the VAT Act is a special Act"
"and thus, its provisions supersede the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational"
"Education  Act  on 
 
the  basis  of 
the  principle  of 
interpretation  specialia"
"generalibus  derogant  (Question  of  Law,  No.  3).  On  the  other  hand, 
  Mr."
"Gunatilleke’s submission was that VAT Act does not need to make a specific"
"reference to the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, as it is implicit that for"
"any institution to legally carry out tertiary or vocational training education, they"
"need to be registered under the provisions of that Act. His contention was that"
"the  principle  of 
in  pari  materia  applies  when  the  definition  of  the  term"
"“vocational  training”  or  “practical  training”  is  not  found  in  the  VAT  Act,  and"
"therefore, the TAC was correct in allowing itself to be guided by the provisions"
"of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act in disallowing the exemption."
"Maxim specialia generalibus derogant"
"[58] 
I  will 
first  consider 
the  Maxim  specialia  generalibus  derogant.  The"
"maxim “generalia specialibus non derogant” means that when there is a conflict"
"between  a  general  and  a  special  provision,  the  latter  shall  prevail.  For  the"
"purposes of interpretation of two statutes in apparent conflict, the provisions"
"of a general statute must yield to those of a special one. The said principle has"
"been defined in Craies on Statute Law, Fifth Ed. P. 205 thus:"
