"[39]  According  to  Table  2,  the  students  are  required  to  use  the  computer"
"laboratories to develop their practical experience by applying the knowledge"
"acquired  through  lectures  and  tutorial  classes.  Table  3  further  illustrates  the"
"independent 
learning  hours  spent  by  the  students  on  different 
learning"
"activities, which clearly demonstrates that the Appellant is providing practical"
"training at different levels of the programmes."
"[40] The Respondent did not challenge the contents of the document marked"
"A1  and  A2  submitted  to  the  TAC  and  the  TAC  also  did  not  question  the"
"genuineness of those documents. It is crystal clear that the Appellant provides"
"practical training in the areas of information technology and modern computer"
"facilities  are available to support practical training and skills development."
"[41] The VAT Act, however, does not lay down the degree of practical training,"
"whether it is 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% or 10% and what is required  is that  any"
"educational  institution  shall  conduct  vocational  or  practical  training  in  the"
"areas  of 
information  technology.  One  cannot  understand  as  to  how  the"
"Appellant’s  School  of  Computing  could  have  conducted 
the  computer"
"Degree  Programmes/Computing/Software  Engineering  programme  or

"related Business Information Technology  Progrmmes solely on 100% practical"
"training 
without 
providing 
both 
theoretical-based 
ICT-related"
"principles/concepts  and  practical  training  in computer  laboratories  listed    in"
"A1and A2."
"[42]  On  the  strength  of  the  material  presented  by  the  Appeelant, 
it 
is"
"inconceivable for any educational course in the area of information technology"
"to be conducted by any School of Computing at any level  leading to either"
"Post-Graduate  Degrees  or  Diplomas  solely  on 
theory  disregarding  any"
"computer laboratory based practical training. No explanation has been given"
"by the TAC for the justification of the conclusion that the Appellant’s courses"
"are  only  academically  oriented  but  no  practical 
training  was  provided"
"disregarding very clear and comprehensive material provided by the Appellant"
"before the TAC."
"[43]  The  TAC  has  decided  that  the  Appellant  is  not  providing  vocational"
"educational  courses  and  practical  training  without  examining  the  practical"
