"[10] He strenuously contended that the Appellant has presented material before"
"the  TAC  to  demonstrate  that  practical  training  and  skills  development  were"
"provided  in  the  training  programs  conducted  by  the  Appellant.  He  further"
"submitted that  the Appellant had given details of the theoretical lecture hours"
"as well as the practical hours and therefore the Appellant falls within paragraph"
"(d) of the definition of “Educational Establishment” in section 83 of the VAT Act."
"He further submitted that the TAC has totally ignored the syllabi and mistakenly"
"decided  that  registration  by  the  Appellant  under  the  Tertiary  and  Vocational"
"Education Act, No. 20 of 1990 is a mandatory requirement for the eligibility of"
"the VAT exemption when it is clear that the VAT Act makes no reference to the"
"Tertiary and Vocational Education Act."
"[11] Dr. de Silva strenuously argued that all what the Appellant had to establish"
"was  that  the  Appellant 
is  providing  either  vocational  training  or  practical"
"training, and if the Appellant established that it provided practical training in"
"the areas of information technology, it is eligible for the exemption in terms of"
"the definition of “Educational Establishment” in section 83 of the VAT Act. He"
"further submitted that  practical training is a part of the Appellant’s Information"
"Technology  Institute,  and  no  program  in  the  information  technology  can  be"
"conducted  without  practical  training  being  given  to  the  students  who  follow"
"such courses in information technology."
"[12]  On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Gunatilleke  submitted  that  since  the  terms"
"“vocational training” and “practical training” are not defined in the VAT Act, the"
"TAC  was  correct  in  relying  on  the  criteria  that  should  be  satisfied  by  any"
"educational institution under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20"
"of 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act)."
"He submitted that in terms of the provisions of sections 14, 15 and 16 of the"
"Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, the registration of any institute for the"
"provision of tertiary and vocational education or conducting  any tertiary and"
"vocational education course or conducting any examination for conferring or"
"granting  any 
tertiary  education  award  or  vocational  education  award 
is"
"mandatory."
"[13] He submitted that the Appellant is not registered under the  Tertiary and"
"Vocational  Education  Act  and, 
therefore, 
the  Appellant  could  not  have"
"established,  managed, 
conducted 
any 
tertiary  or 
vocational 
education"
"course   under  the  provisions  of  the  said  Act.  He  argued  therefore,  that  the"
"ordinary meaning of “vocational training “ or “practical training “ in the VAT Act"
