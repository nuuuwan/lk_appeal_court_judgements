"Vocational Education Act, and therefore, the two Acts are in pari materia. He"
"argued  that  the  meaning  of  vocational  and  practical  training  in  the  VAT  Act"

"regarded as an “Educational Establishment” referred to in paragraph (d) of the"
"definition of “Educational Establishment” of the VAT Act."
