"[7] The TAC dismissed the Appellant’s appeal on the following grounds:"
"1.  The  Appellant  is  a  graduate  School  offering    Post-Graduate  Degrees,"
"Diplomas  and  Masters  Degrees  in  Information  Technology,  but  not"
"providing vocational education or practical training as it is evident from"
"the Website of the Appellant;"
"2.  The  registration  by  the  Appellant  under  the  Tertiary  and    Vocational"
"Education Act is mandatory for the exemption but the Appellant was not"
"registered  under  the  said  Act,  and  therefore,  the  Appellant  cannot  be"
"regarded as an “Educational Establishmentment” providing vocational or"
"practical training under paragraph (d) of section 83 of the definition of"
"“Educational Establishment” of  the VAT Act;"
