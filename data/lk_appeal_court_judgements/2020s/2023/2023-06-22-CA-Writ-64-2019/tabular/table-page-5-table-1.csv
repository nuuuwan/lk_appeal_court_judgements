"The Petitioner submitted that as per the above Gazette Notification, there are"
"only four types of transfers applicable to any teacher, namely;"
"(a)  Annual transfers."
"(b) Transfers on exigencies of service."
"(c) Transfers on disciplinary grounds."
"(d) Mutual transfers upon request by the relevant officials."
"The Petitioner submitted that;"
"•  There was no preliminary inquiry or disciplinary inquiry held against the"
"Petitioner at the time of the transfer."
"•  Petitioner has not completed ten years of service as per Circular marked"
"‘P21’."
"•  Petitioner has not applied for a transfer."
"The Petitioner alleged that although her transfer letter ‘P 22’ states that she is"
"transferred on the recommendation made by the Secretary to the Ministry of"
"Education by his letter No. ED/05/72/02/04/537 dated 19th November 2018,"
"no such letter was made available to her despite her request made under the"
"Right to Information Act (Vide ‘P 24’, ‘P 25’, ‘R 1’, and ‘R 2’).  The failure"
"to make available a document referred to in the transfer order marked ‘P 22’"
"is a breach of the principles of natural justice and consequently amounts to an"
"error  on  the  face  of  the  record2.  However,  finally,  the  Respondents  have"
"tendered a copy of the aforesaid letter along with their objections marked as"
"‘R 5’. The Petitioner has also annexed a copy of the same with her counter"
"objections marked ‘P 28’."
"The Petitioner submitted that the 3rd Respondent’s letter dated 11th December"
"2018 (‘P 22’) transferring her to Wanduramba National School and subsequent"
"decisions  in  this  regard  are  unlawful  and/or  unreasonable  and/or  irrational"
"and/or  ultra-vires  and/or  contrary  to  natural  justice,  lacking  transparency,"
"violating procedural and substantive legitimate expectation."
"Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  prayed  for  the  aforementioned  reliefs  in  the"
"Petition."
