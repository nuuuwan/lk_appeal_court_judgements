"Tribunal in terms of Article 59. Article 61A has shut out the writ jurisdiction"
"of the Court of Appeal to review decisions of the Public Service Commission.’"
"In the case of Ratnasiri and others v. Ellawala and others9  Saleem Marsoof"
"J., (P/CA) (as His Lordship then was) observed as follows;"
"‘…  while  the  Public  Service  Commission  is  empowered  to  delegate  to  a"
"Committee or a public officer its powers of appointment, promotion, transfer,"
"disciplinary control and dismissal of specified categories of public officers, it"
"is expressly provided that any public officer aggrieved by an order made by"
"any such Committee or public officer may appeal first to the Public Service"
"Commission and from there to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which is"
"appointed by the Judicial Service Commission. All this is in addition to the"
"beneficial  jurisdiction  created  by  Article  126  of  the  Constitution  which  is"
"expressly  retained  by  Article  61A  of  the  Constitution,  these  are  the  many"
"pillars on which the edifice of the Public Service rests’"
"‘In view of the elaborate scheme put in place by the Seventeenth Amendment"
"to the Constitution to resolve all matters relating to the public service, this"
"Court would be extremely reluctant to exercise any supervisory jurisdiction in"
"the  sphere  of  the  public  service.  I  have  no  difficulty  in  agreeing  with  the"
"submission made by the learned State Counsel that this Court has to apply the"
"preclusive  clause  contained  in  Article  61A  of  the  Constitution  in  such  a"
"manner as to ensure that the elaborate scheme formulated by the Seventeenth"
"Amendment is given effect to the fullest extent.’"
"Katugampola  v.  Commissioner  General  of  Excise  and  others10  Shiranee"
"Tilakawardane  J.,  (P/CA)  (as  her  Ladyship  then  was)  held  that  ‘the  ouster"
"clause contained in Article 61A of the Constitution precludes the jurisdiction"
"of this Court and grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme Court to hear"
"and determine all such matters envisaged within the scope and ambit of such"
"Article. In these circumstances, the person aggrieved by the decision would"
"have to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to inquire into the matter"
"in  terms  of Article  126 of  the  Constitution  as  a  violation  of  a  fundamental"
"right.’"
