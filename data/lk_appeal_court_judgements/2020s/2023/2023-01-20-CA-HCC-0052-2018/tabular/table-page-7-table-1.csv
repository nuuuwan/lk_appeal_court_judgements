"Therefore,  this  Court  has  no  option  but  to  allow  the  appeal  and  set  aside  the"
"conviction and the sentence."
"I am also of the view that this is not a matter fit to order a retrial given the period"
"of time the appellant had been in incarceration and also the time he had to spend"
"in remand custody before the conclusion of the trial, as well as the date of the"
"offence."
"Accordingly,  I  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  of  the  appellant  and"
"acquit him of the charges."
"The appeal is allowed."
