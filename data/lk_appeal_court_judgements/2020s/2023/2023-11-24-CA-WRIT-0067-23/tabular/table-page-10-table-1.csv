"The Petitioner also states that the Kalmunai North Division was also given an official Cheque book"
"from the government account and therefore, it should have received approval from the cabinet"
"for  expenditure,  which  would  not  have  occurred  if  the  said  Kalmunai  North  Division  was  not"
"recognized by the Cabinet of Sri Lanka. By letter dated 2012.12.21 a separate deed book was"
"approved for the Kalmunai North Division to register the respective documents. Both the North"
"and South Divisions have separate books allocated to them. Following the said letter, additional"
"district  registrar  at  the  time,  sent  a  letter  dated  2013.2.27  to  the  Kalmunai  North  Division"
"requesting  a  list  of  Grama  Sevaka  Divisions  and  the  villages  governed  by  the  Kalmunai  North"
"Division, in order to implement the said letter. The said letter was also sent to the Kalmunai South"
"Division requesting Grama Sevaka divisions under their authority."
"Thereafter, the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat at the time replied to the above by letter"

"requested,  the  administrative  areas  of  Kalmunai  North  were  sent  by  letter  dated  2013.3.7."

"said documentation."
"The  Land  Registry  had  a  separate  book  for  registration  of  lands  within  the  Kalmunai  North"
