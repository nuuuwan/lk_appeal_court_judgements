"reasonableness. Thus, a Competent Authority would be acting reasonably if he were"
"acting  on  the  basis  of  a  Surveyor  General's  plan,  even  if  the  occupant  is  claiming"
"prescription. The Competent Authority is not expected to and indeed is precluded from,"
"carrying out an inquiry” (at page 17)."
"The  aforementioned  authorities  endorse  the  proposition  that  there  is  no  statutory"
"requirement  to  hold  an  inquiry  by  the  competent  authority  on  whether  the  land  in"
