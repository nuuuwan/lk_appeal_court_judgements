"The learned Counsel for the Petitioners argued that when the ownership of the land is"
"in doubt, the competent authority could not form an opinion that the land is State land"
"and therefore, is not entitled to take steps under the Act to evict the person in possession"
"or occupation of the land. The learned State Counsel for the Respondents submitted to"
"Court that section 3(1) of the Act requires the competent authority to form an opinion"
"on the material available to him and if his opinion is that the land is State land, to serve"
"or exhibit a Quit Notice on the person in possession or occupation. The learned State"
"Counsel  submitted  that  in  the  instant  action,  since  the  1st  Respondent  formed  her"
"opinion based on the survey plan marked P-12 and the Report marked P-11, her decision"
"was based on the material available to her and therefore, she has correctly formed an"
"opinion and served the Quit notice which is in compliance with the provisions of the"
"Act. It is the contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that, since"
"plans marked as P-10 and P-12 were prepared by the Surveyor General,  in terms  of"
"section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance and section 4 of the Surveyor Act No. 17 of 2002"
"it should presume that both plans were accurate and subsequent plan marked as P-12"
"could not supersede the first plan marked as P-10 and that due to the anomaly created"
"by the two plans, the opinion of the 1st Respondent, that the land in question, is State"
"land,  is  arbitrary,  irrational,  capricious,  ultra  vires,  illegal  and  violates  the  rules  of"
"natural justice."
"Section 3(1) of the Act provides that where a competent authority is of the opinion that"
"any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation of any State land, the competent"
"authority could serve a notice on such person in possession or occupation thereof. The"
"1st Respondent has formed her opinion on the plan and report marked as P-12 and P-11"
"that  the  land  in  dispute  is  State  land.  Since  both  plans  marked  P-10  and  P-12  were"
"prepared by the Surveyor General, both plans could be considered in terms of section"
