"Service Commission on 21.06.2012. According to the new service minutes, the officers"
"in the Postal Department belong to the service category of Supervisory Management"
"Assistants-Technical/  Non-Technical.  The  said  service  category  consists  of 
three"

the  officers  should  pass 
the  Efficiency  Bar"

"a combined service. Accordingly, the officers were categorized as Class B Grade II and"
"Class  B  Grade  I  officers.  Recruitments  were  done  to  the  Class  B  Grade  II.  The"
"promotions  were  given  from  Class  B  Grade  II  to  Class  B  Grade  I  upon  passing  the"

the  officers  who  passed 
the"
"“Efficiency  Bar  Examination”  and  not  the  “Common  Charge  Examination”  (fmdÿ"

"The position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the operation of the old"
"service minutes has been stopped/terminated with effect from 01.01.2006, the date on"
"which  the  Public Administrative  Circular  No.  06/2006  marked  as  P-2(a)  came  into"
"effect and from that date onwards the new service minutes should apply. The Public"
