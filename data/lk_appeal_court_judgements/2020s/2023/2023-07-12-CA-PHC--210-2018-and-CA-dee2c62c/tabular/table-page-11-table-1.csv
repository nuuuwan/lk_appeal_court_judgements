"It is observed that the said Complaint was made on the date on which the dispute arose, and"
"it  is  seems  that  the  1st  Appellant  was  forcefully  ousted  by  the  1st  Respondent  in  a  violent"
"manner,  which  is  not  permitted  under  the  law.  The  contention  of  the  1st  Appellant  was"
"substantiated in the said Complaint as well."
"Thus, it is apparent that the learned Magistrate had duly analysed and evaluated the evidence"
"placed before him and had come to correct findings of fact and law and determined that 1st"
"Appellant was in possession of the disputed premises on the date of filing of the information"
"and determined the matter in terms of section 68(1) and (3)"
"Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judge had come to an erroneous conclusion"
"and set aside the order of the learned Magistrate."
"Thus, we set aside the order dated 07.12.2018 by the learned High Court Judge and affirm"
"the  order  dated  15.03.2016  by  the  learned  Magistrate.  Hence,  we  allow  both  appeals"
"preferred by 1st and 2nd Appellants."
