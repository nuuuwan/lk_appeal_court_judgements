"The contention of the Petitioners is that the Petitioners, 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents are the co-owners of the land, namely Lot 2 in Plan"
"marked as P1(a) and the partition action bearing No. 28609/P has"
"been instituted in the District Court of Kegalle to partition the said"
"corpus amongst the co-owners. The Petitioners state that the 4th"
"and  5th  Respondents  unlawfully  decided  to  enter  into  the  land"
"owned  by 
them  and  attempted 
to  construct  a  building.  The"
"Petitioners 
further 
state 
that 
the  4th  and  5th  Respondents"
"attempted to dispose of valuable flora under the guise of the said"
"unauthorised  construction. 
In 
the  said  Partition  action, 
the"
"Petitioners sought an interim injunction against the Respondents"
"restraining  the  4th  and  5th  Respondents  from  cutting  trees  and"
"constructing buildings on the land in dispute, whereas the learned"
"District  Judge  on  16-05-2018  dismissed  the  said  application."
"Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned District Judge of"
"Kegalle, the Petitioners preferred an appeal to the Civil Appellate"
"High  Court  of  Kegalle  in  case  No.  SP/HCCA/KEG/19/2018(LA),"
"whereas the High Court on 02-05-2019 dismissed the said appeal."
"The  Petitioners  have  sought  a  special  leave  to  appeal  from  the"
"Supreme Court against the said Order of the High Court in case"
"No. SC/HCCA/LA 204/19."
"In  a  nutshell, 
the  Petitioners  allege 
that 
the  4th  and  5th"
"Respondents  are  attempting  to  encroach  on  the  subject  matter"
"owned  by  the  Petitioners,  1st  and  2nd  Respondents.  Admittedly,"
"there  is  a  partition  action  pending  before  the  District  Court  of"
"Kegalle in respect of the land in dispute. In terms of the provisions"
"of the Partition Law, it is the duty of the learned District Judge to"
"identify the corpus to be partitioned and the rightful owners of the"
"same.  It  is  trite  law  that  the  partition  decree  is  a  decree  in  rem"
"binding  everybody.  In  these  circumstances,  it  is  the  view  of  this"
"Court  that  the  dispute  advanced  in  this  Application  could  be"
"resolved in the said pending partition action."
"It 
is  necessary  to  adduce  oral  and  documentary  evidence  to"
"determine  the  boundaries  of  the  purported  land  owned  by  the"
"Petitioners. The facts are in dispute and therefore, the Petitioners"
"are not entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. In this"
