"of officers of the provincial public service of each Province is vested in the Governor of"
"that Province."
"It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  Petitioner  does  not  assert  that  the  power  to dismiss  him  from"
"service is vested with the Governor under the said Section 32(1). Anyway, it cannot be"
"assumed that the Petitioner would be subjected to disciplinary control of  the Provincial"
"Public Service Commission to which the Governor could delegate such powers. It is clear"
"that  the  Petitionerâ€™s  appointing  authority  was  the  President  and  the  Provincial  Public"
"Service Commission has no role to pay in reference to the said appointment."
"Although there is no direct application of the provisions of Section 36 of the Act to the"
"instant Application, it is observed that the President has the authority, by virtue of the said"
"Section,  to  make  orders  and  take  actions  if  any  difficulty  arises  in  giving  effect  to  the"
"provisions of this Act."
"The cardinal argument of the learned ASG is that the Petitioner is not entitled to have and"
"maintain  this  Application  on  the  strength  of  the  provisions  of  the  Article  35  of  the"
"Constitution"
