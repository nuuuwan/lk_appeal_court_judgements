"whether by way of punishment or otherwise and by necessary implication,"
"recognises a right to life. That right must be interpreted broadly, and the"
"jurisdiction  conferred  by  the  Constitution  on  this  Court  for  the  sole"
"purpose of protecting fundamental rights against executive action must be"
"deemed to have conferred all that is reasonably necessary for this Court"
"to protect those rights effectively.”"
