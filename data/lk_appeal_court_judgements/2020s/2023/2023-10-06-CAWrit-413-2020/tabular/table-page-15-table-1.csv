"case that he was terminated solely on the ground of earlier punishment."
"In fact, he continued in service thereafter. As the report would reflect that"
"there are many an allegation subsequent to the imposition of punishment"
"relating  to  his  conduct,  misbehaviour  and  disobedience.  The  Vigilance"
"Department,  in  fact,  had  conducted  an  enquiry  behind  the  back  of  the"
"appellant. The stigma has been cast in view of the report received by the"
"Central Vigilance Commission which was ex parte and when that was put"
"to the delinquent employee, holding of a regular enquiry was imperative."
"It was not an enquiry only to find out that he did not possess the requisite"
"qualification.  Had  that  been  so,  the  matter  would  have  been  altogether"
"different. The allegations in the report of the Vigilance Department pertain"
"to  his  misbehaviour,  conduct  and  his  dealing  with  the  officers  and  the"
"same  also  gets  accentuated  by  the  stand  taken  in  the  counter  affidavit."
"Thus,  by  no  stretch  of  imagination  it  can  be  accepted  that  it  is"
"termination simpliciter. The Division Bench has expressed the view that"
"no departmental enquiry was required to be held as it was only an enquiry"
"to find out the necessary qualification for the post of Chest Therapist. Had"
"the factual score been so, the said analysis would have been treated as"
"correct,  but  unfortunately  the  exposition  of  factual  matrix  is  absolutely"
"different.  Under  such  circumstances,  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  concur"
"with the view expressed by the Division Bench‚Äù."
