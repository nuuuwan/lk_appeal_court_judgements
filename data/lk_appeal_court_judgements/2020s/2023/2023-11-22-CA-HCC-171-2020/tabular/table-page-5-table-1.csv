"In the instant matter  also, we find that  the trial judge had  attached a certain"
"degree of a liability on the appellant saying that he has failed to prove certain"
"facts in his evidence which we think is contrary to the basics of criminal law."
"As such we find that the defense of the appellant has not been considered fairly"
"by the trial judge."
"Further to the above we also find that the trial judged has failed to take in to"
"consideration the observations that has been made with regard to the sealing of"
"the productions during the cross examination of PW1, because it has been sealed"
"with  “ලාකඩ”,  if  that  is  so  a  mark  on  the  parcel  is  inevitable  because  the"
"substance “lakada “ is a very sticky substance which would  inevitably  leave a"
"mark. This probability has not been considered by the trial judge."
"Hence in the light of the above we are compelled to conclude that the trial judge"
"had misdirected himself on the law and the facts of the case."
"Hence, we are compelled to set aside the conviction and the sentence of the trial"
"judge and allow the instant appeal."
