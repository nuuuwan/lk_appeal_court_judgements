"of Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in the case bearing No. 54771"
"(Section 66) at the Magistrate Court of Balangoda. It was informed that since there was a dispute"
"between the 1st and the 2nd Parties in relation to a land, it is likely to result in a breach of the"
"peace."
"The Learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired the matter"
"following the procedure stipulated in Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act, concluded"

"invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province"
"holden in Ratnapura in case bearing no R A 43/2015."
"After hearing the  matter, the  Learned Provincial High Court Judge affirmed the  order of the"
"Learned  Magistrate  and  held  that  the  2nd  Party-Petitioner  had  not  established  the  required"
"possession  and  therefore  the  1st  Party-Respondent  is  entitled  to  the  possession  of  the  land  in"
"dispute until the matter is resolved by a competent court."
