"she has given weight on a liberal and broader interpretation to the Act in view of recovering"
"loans. She has observed that;"
"“Considering the purpose of the enactment of Act, No. 4 of 1990, it is obvious as pointed out"

"the Banks. Therefore the Act makes provision for the sole purpose of recovery of the loans they"
"have  already  granted. The  loans  were  granted  by  the  Bank,  on  securities  provided  by  the"
"debtor to the satisfaction of the creditor, the lending agency.” (at page 413)"
