"served as a window she had been able to identify the appellant who had come the previous"
"day to collect a fishing net and who had also been known to her husband."
"The appellant had entered the house and had said that he was Tharanga and had blown"
"off the bottle lamp and had raped her. In the process the little infant child who had been"
"sleeping on the single bed on which this sexual act had been going on, had woken up and"
"the appellant is supposed to have thrown the child and had committed rape on the victim."
"The child had remained passive after the initial resistance. Thereafter the appellant had"
"left and the other person had also come in and has done the same thing and she names"
"him as Indika, but the prosecution had failed to name him as an accused in the indictment."
"Thereafter  when  the  husband  came,  she  had  told  him  the  story  and  he  had  gone  and"
"confronted the appellant and the other person whom she names and they had tried to"
"settle the matter by offering money. But they had proceeded to the police station and a"
"complaint had been lodged."
"She  had  been  lengthily  cross  examined.  In  the  cross  examination  it  had  transpired  that"
"although she had spoken of a knife being shown to her by the appellant and threatening"
"with it in her evidence in the Magistrates Court, she had not said so and an omission had"
"been brought to the notice of Court."
"Her husband also had given evidence and he had corroborated the victim and he too had"
"named the appellant and the name of the other person who is supposed to have raped the"
"victim."
"The doctor who gave evidence had said that in the history that she had mentioned two"
"names and have said that they both raped her .But he had not seen any tell-tale marks of"
"any type on her body."
"At the conclusion of the prosecution case the appellant had made a statement from the"
"dock denying the entire allegation."
"The main ground of appeal raised by the Counsel for the appellant is the improbability"
"of the story for the prosecution."
