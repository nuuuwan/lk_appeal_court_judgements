"Hence although P.22 is not in the spirit in it should have been made, because,"
"the  17B  defendant  petitioner  has  by  adducing  documentary  evidence  on  two"
"days of inquiry held before the learned predecessor district judge who made order"
"P.7, has shown, as to how she gets the share, although the said learned district"
"judge who made P.7, thought, her hands are tied by the share allotted to the 17th"
"defendant  Richard  by 
the 
judgment 
in  1989,  despite  ordering  a  certain"
"“correction”  referred  to  above  be  included  in  the  judgment,  on  the  whole  the"
"statement that nothing was allotted after Mr. K. S. Gunethilake’s order in 1992,"
"in respect of the 6th defendant, is correct."
"The  17B  defendant  appealed  by 
leave 
to  appeal  application  bearing  No."
"WP/HCCA/ KAL/ 06 2017 LA, for which leave was granted on 4 questions and"
"by  its  judgment,  the  said  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  dismissed  the  appeal"
"directing the learned District Judge to enter interlocutory decree as per the 1989"
"judgment (P.3) and also setting aside the aforesaid orders dated P.7 and P.16."
"Judgement is marked as P.27."
"Among other things, the 17B defendant petitioner argues that, the said orders"
"P.7 and P.16 “emanates from holding of inquiries subsequent to the direction of"
"the  ....Court  of  Appeal  in  revision  application  bearing  No.  C.  A.  1221/2002"
"(marked as P.5) and therefore by setting aside, the said orders P. 7 and P. 16,"
"the Hon. Judges of the Provincial High Court exceeded the jurisdiction conferred"
"upon them”."
"The 17B defendant’s claim is basically from Richard, her father, son of William"
"and who in turn was a son of K. Davith Perera, one of the original owners who"
"had  a  share  of  undivided  11/12th  and  also  from  Nanso  alias  Nancy  Perera,  a"
"sister of Richard and the aunt of 17B defendant."
"It 
is  pertinent  to  examine  as  to  how  shares  were  devolved  upon,  before"
"considering whether the 17B defendant petitioner has established how much of"
"a share should be allocated to him. This needs a pedigree to be drawn, a copy of"
"which pedigree prepared by me is attached to this judgment."
