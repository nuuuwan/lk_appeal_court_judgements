"In Tapinder Singh v. State of Punjab [1970] AIR SC 1586 the court held"
"that:"
"“In  fact  inasmuch  as  a  dying  declaration  is  admitted  on  the  basis  of"
"necessity an obligation lies on the Learned Trial Judge to direct the jury"
"to be on its guard to scrutinize all relevant surrounding circumstances”"
"Considering the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, the dying deposition of the"
"deceased creates a serious issue in respect of the credibility of their evidence."
"The  contradiction  marked  V8  and  V1  creates  a  serious  doubt  about  the"
"evidentiary  value  of PW1  and  PW2  which  should  have  been  considered  by"
"the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment. Hence this ground of appeal"
"has merit."
"In  the  second  common  ground  of  appeal,  the  Learned  Counsels  contends"
"that  the 
identification  of  the  Appellants  has  not  been  proven  beyond"
"reasonable doubt due to the contradictory nature of the evidence given by"
"PW2."
"Proper  identification  of  the  accused  persons  is  a  fundamental  point  that"
"needs to be determined at the beginning of a criminal trial. In this case it is"
"very  important  to  discuss  whether  the  prosecution  has  established  the"
"identity  of  the  Appellants  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  If  the  identification  is"
"compromised, the net result would be the acquittal of the accused persons"
