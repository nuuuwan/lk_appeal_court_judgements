"officers  is  vested  in  the  PSC  by  virtue  of  Article  55(3),  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the"
"Constitution. Accordingly, the powers of the PSC are well entrenched in the Constitution."
"The PSC, in view of Article 61B, has the power to formulate rules, regulations and procedures"
"relating to the public service. Under such powers, the PSC, among other matters, deals2 with"
"the  formulation  and  publication  of  procedural  rules, 
issuance  of  circulars  and  general"
"instructions  relating  to  the  public  service  as  well  as  the  setting  up  of  Service  Minutes  and"
"Schemes  of  Recruitment.  At  the  inception  of  the  PSC,  there  were  no  Service  Minutes  in"
"respect of several services of the Government. However, it is noted that the PSC currently has"
"taken  steps  to  implement  a  Service  Minute  for  almost  each  approved  service  in  the  public"
"service and a Scheme of Recruitment for several posts in semi-government institutions."
"The usual practice, as I am aware, is that the PSC when drafting a Service Minute or Scheme"
"of  Recruitment  uses  its  discretion  to  approve,  reject  or  approve  subject  to  conditions  the"
"requirements forwarded by a Secretary to a Ministry in relation to appointments, promotions"
"etc,. The purpose of a Service Minute and a Scheme of Recruitment, as I can understand, is"
"to uphold fairness, transparency and consistency when making appointments and promotions"
"to the posts in public service and other related services. In my opinion, the PSC's obligation"
"with regard to Service Minutes and Schemes of Recruitment is to formulate criteria in line"
"with  the  concepts  of  the  Rule  of  Law 
in  response  to  any  requests  for  appointments,"
"promotions,  etc,  made  by  the  Secretaries  of  the  relevant  Ministries  and  other  designated"
"authorities based on the public administration's policies. The general perception is that the"
"PSC when exercising such powers collaborates with the Ministry of Public Administration,"
"National Pay Commission and the Department of Management Services. In this regard, the"
"Public Administration Circulars also play a vital role. As such, the Service Minutes which is"
"material to this case are legal instruments formulated by the PSC under its powers flowing"
"from the Constitution."
"The  crux  of  the  argument  relied  on  by  the  Respondents  is  that  the  Public  Administration"
"Circulars cannot override the Service Minutes approved by the PSC. The Respondentsâ€™ prime"
