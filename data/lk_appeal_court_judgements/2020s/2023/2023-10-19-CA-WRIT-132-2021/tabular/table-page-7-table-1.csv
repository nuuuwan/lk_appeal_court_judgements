"argument emanates from the  Note attached to Clause 12(1)  of the Service Minute marked"
"'P12' which deals with the appointment to the post of SDC. The said Note reads:"
"“The post of Senior Deputy Commissioner is the designation of officers in Grade I who were"
"promoted from Grade II to Grade I, but not being assigned the post in Grade I of the Sri Lanka"
"Inland Revenue Service. This post is an official designation given merely to the seniority and not"
"having any change in the role, responsibility or benefits relating to the post”"
"In view of the said Clause 12(1), the qualifications required for the post of Commissioner and"
"SDC are equivalent and such qualifications are: “to be an officer in Grade I of the Sri Lanka Inland"
"Revenue Service”. The qualifications for the post of Deputy Commissioner are: “to be an officer"
"in Grade II of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service”. Thus, it appears the SDC is a post that falls"
"between  the  post  of  Commissioner  and  Deputy  Commissioner,  two  posts  each  of  which"
"requires distinct qualifications. This position is further reinforced in line with the contents of"
"the  above  Note  attached  thereto.  It  can  be  assumed  that  the  intention  of  the  PSC  or  the"
"Secretary to the relevant Ministry is merely to promote the Deputy Commissioners in Grade"
"II  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Inland  Revenue  Service  to  its  Grade  I,  without  assigning  the  post  of"
"Commissioner (in Grade I). On the other hand, the said promotion is only a Grade-to-Grade"
"promotion and not a Post-to-Post promotion. Thus, the concern that emanates from the fact"
"of promoting a Deputy Commissioner to the post of SDC is whether such appointments are"
"in a conditional nature rather than being made unconditionally as in other usual promotions."
"I  am  aware  that  during  the  recent  past,  the  PSC  has  given  approval  for  such  promotions"
"without assigning the post related to the respective Grade. The reason for this may be to confer"
"benefits to certain categories of officers who serve in one particular Grade for a long period"
"without being promoted to the next substantive post. I  consider this concept or policy as a"
"method of facilitating such stagnated officers by granting them the salary of the higher post"
"but  without  assigning  other  benefits  associated  with  such  substantive  higher  posts.  In  the"
"meantime, the scenario in the instant Application can be viewed as a better privilege since the"
"SDC was given a designation that raises their status in addition to the higher salary scale."
"Upon an independent study I have done on the aforesaid policy, I have come across several"
"instances where the Government has adopted the above policy in order to cater  to officers"
