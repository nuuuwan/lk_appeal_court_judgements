"In  view  of  the  above  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court,  it  is  settled  law  that  the"
"members of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent Bank need not be made"
"parties to this Application."
"In  these  circumstances,  it  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  preliminary  legal"
"objections raised by the learned State Counsel are devoid of merits."
"I shall now deal with the merits of this Application. The contention of the learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner is that the Petitioner has never been involved in the"
"business of the 3rd Respondent Company at any time and therefore, is a third"
"party in respect of the facilities secured by Mortgage Bond Numbers 1240 and"
"1241."
"As per the document marked as P5B (Article of Association of the 3rd Respondent"
"Company),  the  Petitioner  is  one  of  the  Directors  of  the  said  Company.  The"
"Application for a Bank guarantee made on behalf of the 3rd Respondent Company"
"marked  as  1R1a  has  been  signed  by  the  Petitioner  as  a  Director.  The  loan"
"Application marked as 1R3 made on behalf of the 3rd Respondent is also signed"
"by the Petitioner as a Director. The Mortgage Bonds bearing Nos. 1240 and 1241"
"have  been  signed  by  the  Petitioner  in  his  capacity  as  a  Director  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent.  The  document  marked  as  1R4  is  the  minutes  of  the  Board  of"
"Directors  of  the  3rd  Respondent  Company,  the  Petitioner  has  in  fact,  in  his"
"capacity as “Chairman” chaired the meeting at which a decision was taken to"
"obtain loans, overdrafts, Bank guarantees and letters of credit facilities from the"
"Bank  of  Ceylon.  It  is  pertinent  to  be  noted  that  a  decision  to  enter  into  the"
"Mortgage Bonds in disputes was also taken at the same meeting chaired by the"
"Petitioner. Moreover, it is borne out from the document marked 1R17 that the"
"Petitioner has drawn allowances from the 3rd Respondent Company for his role"
"as a Director. In these respects, it is abundantly clear that the Petitioner, as a"
"working Director (Chairman) of the 3rd Respondent Company, has played a major"
"role in the business transactions of the 3rd Respondent Company, and therefore,"
"he can not be considered as a 3rd party as far as the said Mortgage Bonds are"
"concerned."
"The  2nd  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  was  that  the"
"impugned  Resolution  passed  by  the  1st  Respondent  Bank,  amalgamating  two"
"separate Borrowers, namely the 3rd Respondent individually and the Petitioner"
"and the 4th Respondent jointly, is bad in law. It is pertinent to be noted that in"
"terms of the provisions of Section 25 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance, the Bank"
"is  empowered  to  combine  both  Mortgage  Bons  in  suit  as  those  Bonds  are"
"executed  concerning  the  same  property.  Section  25  of  the  said  Ordinance  is"
"reproduced as follows;"
