"for the recovery of the total amount due to the Bank in respect of all such"
"loans, overdrafts, advances and other accommodation, as the case may be,"
"and the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply accordingly.”"
"In the circumstances, the impugned Resolution, with the amalgamation of both"
"financial facilities,  passed by the 1st Respondent Bank is lawful, and therefore,"
"the  question  of  the  threshold  of  the  amount  for  the  parate-execution  does  not"
"arise."
"The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Notice under Section 21"
"of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance has not been given to the Petitioner. The learned"
"State Counsel appearing for the 1st Respondent has denied the above contention"
"and however failed to produce a copy of the Notice, to meet this argument."
"Under Section 21 of the said Ordinance, the Resolution authorizing the sale of"
"the  property  shall  be  published  in  the  Government  Gazette  and  three  daily"
"newspapers  in  Sinhala,  Tamil  and  English.  The  Notice  shall  be  sent  under"
"registered post to the borrower."
"Indeed,  there  is  no  material  before  Court  to  substantiate  the  fact  that  Notice"
"under Section 21 has been dispatched to the Petitioner. However, it is evident,"
"that Notice of sale under Section 22 of the said Ordinance has been served with"
"the  Petitioner.  Thereafter,  the  Petitioner  invoked  the  Writ  jurisdiction  of  this"
"Court as well. In these circumstances, it appears to this Court that there is no"
"material prejudice caused to the Petitioner for not  giving Notice under Section"
"21.  In  this  regard,  I  refer  to  the  observation  made  by  the  Supreme  Court  in"
"Gunaratne Vs. Abeysingha2. This is the case where the Competent Authority,"
"under  the  provisions  of  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  No.  7  of"
"1979  (as  amended),  had  given  15  days  Notice  to  the  unauthorized  occupant"
"whereas Section 3 of the said Act mandates to give 30 days Notice.  The learned"
"Magistrate dismissed the Application on the basis that the Competent Authority"
"has  not  adhered  to  Section  3  of  the  said  Act  which  has  subsequently  been"
"affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court set aside the Orders of the"
"learned Magistrate and the Court of Appeal and observed that;"
"“Although  nullification  is  the  natural  and  usual  consequence  of  disobedience,"
"breach of procedural or ""formal rules is likely to be treated as mere irregularity if"
