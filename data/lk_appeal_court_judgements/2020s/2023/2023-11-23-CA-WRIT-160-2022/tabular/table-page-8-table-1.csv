"Now I advert to the circumstances relating to the second disciplinary inquiry held against the"
"Petitioner  after  his  retirement.  The  Respondents  contend  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"appear  before  the  second  disciplinary  inquiry  despite  him  being  informed,  in  writing,  the"
"necessity of his appearance. The stand taken by the Petitioner that no disciplinary inquiry can"
"be conducted against retired officers is a proposition to which I cannot simply agree. In this"
"regard I need to draw my attention to the provisions of section 36:4 of Chapter XLVIII of the"
"Establishments Code (E-Code) which declare that the Disciplinary Authority can conduct a"
"disciplinary  inquiry  against  an  officer  retired  subject  to  section  12  of  the  Minutes  of  the"
"Pensions  irrespective  of  the  retirement  of  such  officer.  I  am  aware  that  the  SMIB  is  not"
"governed under the E-Code or the Minutes on Pensions, but the rationale adopted in those"
"sections has a considerable bearing in this case."
"The Petitioner was absent at the inquiry held on 01.04.2022 and even on the subsequent dates."
"Due to such absence of the Petitioner, the new Inquiry Officer has decided to proceed with"
"the fresh disciplinary inquiry ex parte. Upon the conclusion of the said second inquiry by the"
"10th  Respondent,  the  Petitioner  was  found  guilty  of  all  twelve  charges  against  him.  The"
"respective  disciplinary  report  dated  5.7.2022  is  marked  ‘R14’.  The  Petitioner  was  duly"
"informed about the said second disciplinary order and as a consequence his services have been"
"terminated  with  effect  from  his  date  of  retirement  (i.e.,  15.12.2020)  barring  him  from  any"
"entitlement to terminal benefits by the letter dated 10.08.2022 marked ‘R15’. Apparently, the"
"Petitioner has not lodged an appeal against the said disciplinary order ('R14') though he was"
"privileged to do so under the provisions of the Rules of the SMIB. Neither does he challenge"
"the said report through the instant Application. Further, I take the view that the Petitioner"
"has failed to satisfy Court that the author of the impugned document 'P19' has acted beyond"
"his jurisdiction and contrary to principles of Natural Justice or pronounces a decision which"
"is eminently irrational or unreasonable."
"In  these  circumstances,  I  do  not  see  any  necessity  to  analyse  the  objections  raised  by  the"
"Respondents who argue that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the instant Application"
"as it deals with matters arising from a contract of employment between the Petitioner and the"
