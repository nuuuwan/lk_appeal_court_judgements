"No evidence is available to form an opinion that the SMIB has suppressed the reasons to call"
"for  a  fresh  inquiry.  The  Petitioner  has  not  denied  having  knowledge  of  issuing  the  above-"
"mentioned letter marked 'R9' but has only attempted to elucidate the facts described therein."
"In the Counter Affidavit, the Petitioner has just made a general denial upon the respective"
"provisions in the Statement of Objections of the Respondents rather than expressly contesting"
"the existence of the aforementioned document 'R9'. The Respondents contend that there is no"
"specific necessity to record reasons on the face of the document containing the findings of the"
"Inquiry Officer. Nevertheless, the Disciplinary Authority has seemingly taken much effort to"
"elaborate on such reasons in the said letter marked ‘R9’. Similarly, the Petitioner has failed to"
"establish  any  inordinate  or  unreasonable  delay  on  the  part  of  the  SMIB  in  forwarding  the"
"report of the first disciplinary inquiry. As observed earlier the Inquiry Officer has taken more"
"than  ten  months  to  forward  his  final  report  ('R7(a)')    to  SMIB  after  the  conclusion  of  its"
"proceedings."
"Based  on  the  facts  and  overall  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  am  not  convinced  that  the"
"Petitioner was prejudiced by any conduct of the relevant authorities, in failing to make the"
"Petitioner  aware  of  the  reasons  recorded  by  the  Disciplinary  Authority  to  hold  a  fresh"
"disciplinary inquiry.  Thus, I am not inclined to consider the relief prayed for in paragraph 'C'"
"of the prayer merely based on the proposition of the Petitioner that the reasons to summon a"
"fresh inquiry have not been communicated to him."
