"reasons as to why the former has not agreed with the findings of the disciplinary order. In"
"addition to the aforesaid 'R9', the SMIB even at its Board Meeting held on 20.07.2021 resolved"
"to initiate a fresh disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner and as a consequence, the 10th"
"Respondent was appointed as the Inquiry Officer. The extract of the minutes of the said Board"
"meeting  is  marked  ‘R10’.  Anyhow,  the  Petitioner  has  raised  objections  continuously  for"
"conducting a fresh disciplinary inquiry against him."
"There  cannot  be  any  ambiguity  on  the  point  that  the  Disciplinary  Authority  has  in  fact"
"formulated specific reasons for his decision to conduct a fresh inquiry against the Petitioner."
"This is clearly evinced in the said letter marked 'R9', though that document is not a copy of"
"the minute sheets or other pages of whatever the file maintained by the SMIB dealing with"
"the affairs of the first disciplinary inquiry. It is important to note that there are no expressed"
"provisions in the 'Rules' that the Disciplinary Authority is duty-bound to communicate his"
"decisions  that  are  recorded  in  the  relevant  file.  Anyhow,  I  must  draw  my  attention  to  the"
"aspect  of  whether  there  is  any  breach  of  the  rules  of  Natural  Justice  by  the  SMIB  for  not"
"communicating such reasons in a specific communique to the Petitioner."
"I take the view that when assaying whether the rules of Natural Justice are violated the court"
"cannot stick only to the traditional yardsticks.  With the evolution of legal jurisprudence, the"
"concept  of  Natural  Justice  has  gone  beyond  its  ancient  parameters  which  are  generally"
"considered as the Rule Against Bias1 and the Right to a Fair Hearing2. The scope of the rule"
"of Natural Justice has been expanded through judicial activism to give a broader definition"
"which also includes the 'duty to act fairly'. However, it cannot be restricted to the said concept"
"of fairness as the rules of Natural Justice have now been crystalised into various dimensions."
"Thus, the right of a litigant to know the reasons for the decision taken by the public authority"
"is  an  essential  element  in  establishing  the  Rules  of  Natural  Justice.  In  this  backdrop,  the"
"assessment of violation of the rules of Natural Justice should be analysed based on the facts"
"and circumstances of each case."
