"Officer expressed an opinion referring to the evidence led before him that the charges 1 to 12"
"against  the  Petitioner  have  not  been  proved.  Having  analyzed  the  final  report  of  the  said"
"disciplinary  inquiry  held  against  the  Petitioner,  the  Disciplinary  Authority  of  the  SMIB"
"decided  to  disagree  with  the  decision  of  the  said  Inquiry  Officer.  Accordingly,  the  Acting"
"General Manager of the SMIB by the said letter marked 'P19' informed the Petitioner that a"
"fresh disciplinary inquiry would be commenced against the Petitioner on the same charges. It"
"is  noted  that  the  said  Acting  General  Manager  has  not  accepted  the  final  decision  of  the"
"previous disciplinary inquiry based on clause 16.3 of the Disciplinary Rules ('Rules') marked"
"'P27'/ 'R3' of the SMIB."
"The  Petitioner  claims  that  even  though  the  previous  disciplinary  inquiry  against  him  was"
"concluded on 18.12.2019 the Disciplinary Authority of the SMIB failed to communicate its"
"final  decision  to  him. Anyhow,  as  per  the cover  letter  marked  'R7'  the  Inquiry  Officer  has"
"forwarded his Final Report ('R7(a)') to SMIB only on 30.10.2020. It is seen that the Petitioner"
"has  been  given  extensions  of  service  from  time  to  time  until  the  conclusion  of  the  said"
"disciplinary inquiry (Vide 'R6' and 'R6(a)'). Moreover, the Petitioner states that he retired on"
"15.12.2020 reaching the retirement age of sixty years but it appears that it occurred whilst the"
"said disciplinary inquiry was in progress. Meanwhile, SMIB notified the Petitioner through a"
"letter dated 23.02.2022 ('P22') of the new Inquiry Officer and the Prosecution Officer for a"
"fresh disciplinary inquiry which was scheduled to commence on 01.04.2022."
"The  Petitioner  pleads  that  the  decision  to  hold  a  fresh  disciplinary  inquiry  against  him  is"
"contrary  to  the  provisions  stipulated  in  Clauses  16.3  and  16.4  of  the  said  Rules.  The"
"contention of the Petitioner is that such a decision has been taken in a scenario where the final"
"decision of the first disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner was pending for approximately"
"two years. Additionally, the Petitioner argues that no provisions are spelled out in the Rules"
"to initiate disciplinary inquiries in respect of retired officers."
"Now I need to examine the relevant provisions of the said Rules of the SMIB with respect to"
"the power of the Disciplinary Authority in reference to the orders of the disciplinary inquiries."
