"as business income of the Appellant in the course of operating and maintaining"
"facilities for storage."
"[69] The Appellant has submitted that he had inherited 5 warehouses from his"
"father and constructed three more, and thereafter continued to provide storage"
"facilities in those warehouses to customers, in the same manner that his father"
"had  done  without  any 
lease  agreement  but  only  a  memorandum  of"
"understanding. He has further submitted that upon the request made by the"
"Department of Inland Revenue, the Appellant executed  lease agreements for"
"the premises and the Department of Inland Revenue is now using the said lease"
"agreements  as  a  basis  to  deny  the  due  tax  concession.  The  Appellantâ€™s"
"argument was that the material submitted by the Appellant demonstrates that"
"he  in  fact  operates  and  maintains  the  storage  facilities  and  therefore,  the"
"Appellant is entitled to the exemption in terms of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule"
"to the Inland Revenue Act."
"[70] The learned Deputy Solicitor Counsel, however, submitted that in terms of"
"item 31, the concessionary rate of 10% can only be granted if the Appellant is"
"operating and maintaining a facility for storage and the facts relied on by the"
"Appellant indicate that the Appellant was merely providing a storage facility to"
"others and collecting a rent, which are insufficient for the eligibility under item"
"31 of the Fifth Schedule. He further submitted that no credible evidence had"
"been  placed  by 
the  Appellant 
to  establish 
that  he  was  operating  and"
"maintaining facilities for storage, and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to"
"10% concessionary rate of tax as correctly determined by the TAC."
"[71] It is not in dispute that the Appellant has entered into lease agreements"
"with Cargills Retail (Private) Limited and Ranfer Teas (Private) Limited and leased"
"out his premises to Cargills Retail (Private) Limited (p. 184 of the TAC brief) and"
"Ranfer  Teas  (Pvt)  Ltd  (p.  172  of  the  TAC  brief).  The  Appellant  relies  on  the"
"following  two  clauses  of  the  said  two  lease  agreements  with  Cargills  Retail"
"(Private) Limited and Ranfer Teas (Private) Limited, and argues that they indicate"
"that  the  Appellant  was  responsible  for  the  maintenance  of  the  premises  and"
"that  the  TAC  was  wrong 
in  holding  that  the  Appellant  was  only  renting"
"warehouses  to  the  parties  based  only  on  the  existence  of  written 
lease"
"agreements:"
