"[8]  At  the  hearing  of  the  Appeal,  we  heard, Mr.  Suren  Fernando,  the  learned"
"Counsel for the Appellant and  Mr. Manohara Jayasinghe, the learned Deputy"
"Solicitor General for the Respondent. At the commencement of the hearing, Mr."
"Suren Fernando intimated to Court that he did not wish to pursue the questions"
"of law No. 1 and 4 (Vide- the journal entry dated 23.11.2022). Accordingly, Mr."
"Suren Fernando confined his submissions mainly on the questions of law No. 2"
"and 3."
"[9] At the hearing, Mr. Suren Fernando submitted that the TAC erred in relying"
"on the erroneous ruling made by the Committee for Interpretation of Tax Laws"
"dated  29.05.2015  that  ruled  that  the  term  “business”  has  been  defined  in"
"Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act, referring to an activity carried out only"
"by  a  company.    Mr.  Suren  Fernando  further  submitted  that  the  concept  of"
"“undertaking” in item 31 is wider than the concept of “business”, referred to in"
"Section 217, which encompasses a number of different activities including the"
"rental income received by the Appellant from warehouses. He submitted that"
"item  31  of  the  Fifth  Schedule  to  the  Act  applies  to  both  individuals  and"
"companies. He referred to the Sinhala version of item 31 of the Inland Revenue"
"Act and submitted that it refers to both profits and income of an undertaking"
"and that it makes reference to an “individual” and thus, the concessionary rate"
"in item 31 applies to both business profits and income of such an undertaking"
"who is either an individual or company. He submitted that the concessionary"
"tax rate referred to in item 31 applies to an individual who is engaged in renting"
"warehouses,  and  thus,  the  income  received  by  the  Appellant  from  renting"
"warehouses  qualifies  for  the  preferential  rate  of  tax,  independent of  whether"
"rents received by such individual constitute business income or rental income."
