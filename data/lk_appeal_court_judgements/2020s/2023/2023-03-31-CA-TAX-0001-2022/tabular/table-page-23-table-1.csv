"[63] After applying the aforesaid principle to the facts, the Court found that (i)"
"the  sub-leases  were  granted,  because  the  assessee  company  wanted,  was  a"
"matter of business, to turn its rights to account by opening out, and developing"
"the  areas,  and  then  granting  these  sub-leases  with  an  eye  to  profit;  (ii)  the"
"assessee  company  having  secured  a  large  tract  of  coal-bearing  land  parcel,"
"developed it into a kind of stock-in-trade to be profitably dealt with, extended"
"its business acquiring fresh fields. In the circumstances, the Court came to the"
"conclusion that the nature of the business was trading within the objects of the"
"company and not enjoyment of property as land owner and thus, that income"
"had  to  be  treated  as  income  from  business  and  not  as  income  from  house"
"property."

"Supreme Court held that rental income derived by the assessee company by"
"letting out a property simplicitor, was chargeable to tax under the head ""income"
"from house property"" and not as business income, irrespective of the fact that"
"the assessee company was doing business of acquiring, developing and selling"
"properties. The Court said that the rental income was received by the company"
"because of ownership of the property and not by exploitation of property by"
"way  of  complex  commercial  activity.  While  holding  that  the  rental  income"
"received  by  the  assessee  does  not  become  income  from  trade  or  business,"
"Jagtap, A.M. J. held:"
