"“The term “undertaking” means a kind of business and the term “business” is"
"defined  in  section  217  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  as  follows:  -  “business”"
"includes  an  agricultural  undertaking,  the  racing  of  horses,  the  letting  or"
"leasing of any premises, including any land by a company and forestry”. The"
"definition cannot be overlooked. Therefore, it is seen that letting or leasing of"
"a premises is treated as a business only, if such activities are carried out by a"
"company. In any other circumstances, profit and income from letting premises"
"by  any  person  other  than  a  company  is  treated  as  income  from  renting  of"
"properties  falling  under  section  3(g)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act.  It  has  been"
"argued that the term “undertaking” cannot be restricted to a business and that"
"even facilities for storage would come within the meaning of an undertaking."
"However, it is seen that the Appellant is only renting out commercial premises."
"Therefore, the term “undertaking” referred to in section 58B cannot be applied"
"to treat the activity of the Appellant as a business, in view of the definition of"
"business given in section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act”."
