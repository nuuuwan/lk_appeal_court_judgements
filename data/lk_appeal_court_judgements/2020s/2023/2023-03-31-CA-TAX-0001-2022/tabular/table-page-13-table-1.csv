"[29] On the other hand, the Sinhala version of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to"
"the Inland Revenue Act, as amended, refers to both profits and income of the"
"undertaking and thus, item 31 captures both profits and income. The Sinhala"
"version reads as follows:"

"[30]  The  word  “undertaking”  therefore,  should  be  understood  to  have  been"
"used in item 31 in a wide sense, and must be understood as one taking in its"
"fold  all  collective  business  or  trading  activities,  a  person  or  company  may"
"undertake as one economically independent and self-sustaining indivisible"
"entity subject to the purpose and activity referred to in Item 31 of the Fifth"
"Schedule  to  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  (Mr.  S.  P.  Muttiah  v.  The  Commissioner"

"(CA/TAX/48/2019, decided on 30.07.2021, paragraph 28)."
"[31] In my view,  the  concept of “undertaking  “referred to in  item  31 is  wider"
"than the mere term “business” referred to in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue"
"Act.  It  is  not  limited  to  the  activities  carried  out  by  a  company  as  incorrectly"
"found by the Tax Appeals Commission. It applies both to an individual and a"
"company and profits and income earned by an individual or company as one"
"economically independent and self-sustaining indivisible entity, as long as"
"such individual or company in the nature of an undertaking carried on business"
"or  trading  activities  as  a  whole,  from  which  profits  and  income  arise  for  the"
"purpose  and  activity  referred  to  in  Item  31  of  the  Fifth  Schedule  to  the"

(CA/TAX/48/2019,"
"decided on 30.07.2021, paragraph 29). Hence, that part of the finding of the TAC,"
"namely that the term “business” referred to in section 217 of the Inland Revenue"
"Act is limited to activities of a company shall stand corrected."
"Business income vs. Rental income"
"[32] The next question is whether the rental income received by the Appellant"
"can be considered as a business income for the purpose of item 31 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, irrespective of the fact that the concession in item 31 applies to"
"an individual or a company, and profits or income of an undertaking. The TAC"
"however,  did  not  rest  its  decision  on  the  ground  that  the  Appellant  as  an"
