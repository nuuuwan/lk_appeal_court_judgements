"[41] P. M. Bakshi on Interpretation of Statutes First Edition, 2011 dealing with",""
"the construction of the meaning of words states at p. 496:",""
"","“The general rule of statutory construction of a fiscal statute is that words"
"","have  to  be  construed  strictly  according  to  their  ordinary  and  natural"
"","meaning,  particularly  when  the  statute  is  a  fiscal  one  irrespective  of  the"
"","object  with  which  the  provisions  was  introduced.  Of  course,  if  there  is"
"ambiguity 
in  the  statutory","language,  reference  may  be  made  to  the"
"","legislative intent to resolve the ambiguity. But if the statutory language is"
"","unambiguous, then that must be given effect to. The Legislature is deemed"
"","to intend and mean what it says. The need for interpretation arises only"
"","when the words used in the statute are, on their own terms ambivalent and"
"do  not  manifest  the","intention  of  the  Legislature.  However,  there  are"
"","exceptions to this rule. The first is that the rule of strict construction does"
"","not  apply  to  a  provision  which  merely  lays  down  the  machinery  for  the"
"","calculation or procedure for the collection of tax. The second exception is: If"
"","two constructions are possible and a strict construction would lead to an"
"","absurd result then the construction which is keeping with the object of the"
"","statutory provision or in keeping with equity could be accepted”."
