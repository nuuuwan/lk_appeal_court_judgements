In the event, the Appellant failed to secure 10% concession under item"

"that  the  concessionary  rate  of  tax  set  out  in  Item  31  does  not  apply  to  the",""
"Appellant for the following reasons:",""
"","1.  The  term  “undertaking”  means  a  kind  of  a  business,  and  the  term"
"","“business” has been defined in Section 217 of the Inland  Revenue Act,"
"","which restricts the letting or leasing of any premises by a company and"
"","not by an individual;"
"","2.  Even  though  the  Appellant  has  rented  out  his  premises  to  several"
"","companies for storage purposes, the Appellant was not involved in the"
"","business  of  operating  and  maintaining 
facilities 
for 
storage,  and"
"","therefore,  the  Appellant  cannot  rely  on  the  concessionary  tax  benefit"
"","under item 31of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act;"
"","3.  The  activity  carried  out  by  the  Appellant  was  only  renting  out  his"
"","premises to others to  be used  for storage purposes, which falls under"
"","Section 3 (g) of the Inland Revenue Act, and thus, the Appellant’s activity"
"","of renting out the premises cannot be treated as an undertaking or as a"
"","business;"
"","4.  The Appellant’s activity of renting out his premises should be calculated"
"","in terms of Section 6 of the Inland Revenue Act, and thus, the Appellant"
"","is not entitled to secure the concessionary tax rate provided in Item 31"
"","of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act."
"","5.  The term “undertaking” in section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act cannot"
"","be  applied  to  treat  the  activity  of  the  Appellant  as  a  business,  and"
"","therefore,  the  Appellant  is  not  an  undertaking  within  the  meaning  of"
"","section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act.  The Appellant is therefore, not"
"","entitled to secure the concessionary tax rate of 10% under section 59B"
"","of the Inland Revenue Act."
