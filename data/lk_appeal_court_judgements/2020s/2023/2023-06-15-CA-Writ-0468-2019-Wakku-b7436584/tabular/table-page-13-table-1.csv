"It came to light in this case that the State has decided not to proceed with the"
"order  made  under  Section  38  Proviso  (a)  of  the  Act  consequent  to  the"
"undertaking  given  to  this  Court.  However,  the  said  undertaking  was  given"
"pursuant  to  the  Petitioner’s  application  for  interim  reliefs  which  included"
"suspending the operation of the order made under Section 38 Proviso (a) of"
"the Act. Therefore, cannot be considered as an abandonment of proceedings"
"under the above order. Accordingly, in my view, the Court must consider this"
"application in the form it is presented to this Court."
"Alleged malice and ulterior motive on the part of the 1st Respondent"
"The  Petitioner’s  main  allegtion  on  malice  is  that  in  April,  2017  the  1st"
"Respondent  Divisional  Secretary  together  with  her  driver  came  an  met  the"
"Petitioner and demanded to sell a portion of Petitioner’s land for her to build"
"a house. The Petitioner refused the demand and thereafter, the 1st Respondent"
"maliciously took steps to acquire the Petitioner’s land to build the Divisional"
"Secretariat and her quarters. However, in my view, this allegation is highly"
"improbable and unsupported by evidence. The letter ‘R 1’, the description of"
"the lands proposed to be acquired, was signed by the 1st Respondent on the"
"29th  March  2017,  before  the  date  on  which  she  has  visited  the  Petitioner."
"Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the Petitioner’s allegation.  The other"
"ground  of  malice  is  choosing  Petitioner’s  land  for  the  required  purpose"
"without considering other options, unfounded allegation of landslide risk at"
"the land where the present Divisional Secretariat and Divisional Secretary’s"
"quarters are situated, making both the application and recommendation by the"
"1st  Respondent  and  the  1st  Respondent  signed  the  document  ‘R  1’  in  the"
"purported capacity as the head of the department13.  The foregoing grounds"
"are already dealt with above in this judgment."
"Accordingly,  it  is  my  considered  view,  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"establish malice on the part of the 1st Respondent. However, I am of the view,"
"the 1st Respondent’s conduct is irrational and unreasonable."
"Finally, the Respondents argued that even if the order made under Section 38"
"Proviso  (a)  is  quashed,  the  Section  2  notice  will  remain  intact  since  the"
"Petitioner  has  not  sought  to  quash  the  Section  2  notice.  I  observe  that  this"
"submission  is  contrary  to  their  own  submission  that  once  the  Section  38"
