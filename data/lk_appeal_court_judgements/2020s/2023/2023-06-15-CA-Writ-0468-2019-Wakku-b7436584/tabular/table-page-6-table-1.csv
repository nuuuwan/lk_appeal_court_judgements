"(a)  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act2  there  is  a  specific  question  regarding  the"
"amount  estimated  for  the  acquisition  and  whether  a  specified  amount  is"
"deposited with the Divisional Secretary. Answering the said question, the 1st"
"Respondent stated that funds would be  provided by the Ministry of Lands."
"Therefore, it is clear that no funds had been allocated for the acquisition. The"
"next question is whether there are funds available for the purposes for which"
"the land is acquired. Answering the said question, the 1st Respondent states"
"that funds will be allocated in the 2019 budget under the Ministry of Internal"
"Affairs. Another question is whether the building plans had been prepared and"
"the tenders had been called. This question was also answered in the negative."
"Hence,  the  Respondent’s  own  documents  establish  that  without  taking  the"
"initial steps such as allocation of funds, the 1st Respondent has proceeded to"
"acquire the land for the construction."
"Urgency, necessity, and suitability"
"The  Respondent’s  main  contention  is  that  the  land  in  which  the  present"
"Divisional Secretariat and the quarters of the Divisional Secretary are situated"
"is subject to the risk of landslide. However, the Respondents have failed to"
"substantiate  this  position  by  obtaining  a  report  from  the  National  Building"
"Research Organization (NBRO) or any other competent authority. However,"
"the  1st  Respondent  has  obtained  the  services  of  a  Geologist  to  inspect  the"
"Petitioner’s  land3.  The  Respondents  relied  on  the  statement  made  by  the"
"Grama Niladhari of Elapatha Division who gave evidence at the inquiry held"
"in respect of the objections made by the Petitioner. Even in Grama Niladhari’s"
"statement, all that she has stated is that earth slips occur in the land where the"
"present Divisional Secretariat is located and steps have to be taken to make it"
"stable. She has not stated that there is a risk of landslides."
"Another  ground  stated  by  the  Respondents  is  that  the  present  Divisional"
"Secretariat is housed in an old building where there was a Village Council. It"
"was also submitted that the building is in dilapidated condition and with the"
"increase of the number of members of staff almost to double, 150  - 200 in"
"number,  the  building  is  insufficient  to  house  the  present  number  of  staff."
"Further,  it  was  submitted  that  a  large  number  of  the  public  come  to  the"
"Divisional Secretariat for their needs, daily."
