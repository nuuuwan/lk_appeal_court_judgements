"Proviso (a) order is made, the pre requisites recede to the back ground and the"
"order made under Section 38 Proviso (a) takes precedence."
"Be that as it may, in the case of Dayaratne v. Rajitha Senarathne, Minister of"
"Lands and others14  the Court of Appeal observed that the Section 2 notice"
"only  facilitates  an  authorize  officer  to  enter  into  the  land  and  determine"
"whether such land is suitable for the public purpose for which it is required."
"Further, a Section 2 notice by itself does not affect the rights of any person to"
"his land except to the limited extent of the authorized an officer to enter upon"
"the said land and consider its suitability for acquisition. Section 2 notice is"
"clearly not a decision or order which has the proprio vigore, its own force."
"Therefore, in my view, a plea to quash the Section 2 notice is unwarranted."
"Conclusion"
"In light of the analysis made above in this judgement, I am of the view that"
"the  decision  to  acquire  the  portion  of  land  of  which  the  Petitioner  is  a  co-"
"owner, depicted in plan ‘R 5’ is irrational, unreasonable and ultra-vires."
"Hence, I am inclined to issue writs of certiorari prayed for in paragraphs (d),"
"(e),  (f),  (g)  and  the  writ  of  prohibition  prayed  for  in  Paragraph  (h),  of  the"
"prayer of the Petition."
"Parties shall bear their own costs."
