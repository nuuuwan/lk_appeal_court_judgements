"Section 22(1): The proper authority shall make regulations as to the fees to be paid to the"
"cemetery keeper, and the fees for the performance of burial services in respect of any portion"
"of any cemetery not sold or set apart for the special use of any religious denomination, and"
"the  fees  â€˜for  digging  graves  and  for  cremations,  and  such  other  services  in  any  cemetery"
"situated within the territorial limits of such proper authority,"
"Section 38: It shall be lawful for the proper authority, from time to time, to make by laws for"
"the following purposes:-"
"(a) for the inspection of burial grounds;"
"(b) for the proper regulation of the burial and cremation of corpses in such burial grounds,"
"and for ensuring that the graves are of proper depth;"
"(c) for the registration of burial grounds within specified areas, the limits of which shall be"
"therein defined;"
"(d) and generally for the proper management, regulation, preservation, and control of all"
"burial grounds, and for the maintenance of order, decency, and cleanliness within the limits"
"thereof, and such by-laws at any time to repeal, alter, or amend."
"Therefore, the learned Magistrate has erred in law when he determined that he cannot grant"
"possession to either the1st Party Respondents or the 2nd Party Respondents and that he can"
"only  grant  possession  to  the  Proper  Authority.  The  learned  Magistrate  had  not  granted"
"possession of the disputed land to either party in dispute on the assumption that such Party"
"would get the power to do anything on the land in dispute."
"However, Sections 11, 12 19, 20 and 24 of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance"
"clearly  address  how  cemeteries  may  be  sold,  assigned  or  set  apart  for  exclusive  burials"
"therefore, parties do not have such freedom."
"Furthermore, under Section 12 of Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance, it clearly states"
"that  any  land  vested  for  a  burial  ground  can  be  used  only  for  the  purpose  of  burial  or"
"cremation of the dead."
"Section 12 of the Ordinance is reproduced below,"
"No part of any cemetery shall be used for any purpose except for the purpose of a cemetery;"
"and any person making any other use of such land, except for the burial or cremation of the"
"dead and purposes relative to such burial or cremation,  shall be guilty of an offence, and"
"liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine  not  less  than  two  thousand  rupees  and  not  exceeding  five"
"thousand rupees for every such offence."
"As such any person who commits any act which constitute to an offence under the ordinance,"
"or any other law becomes liable for punishment under the Chapter IV of the said Ordinance."
