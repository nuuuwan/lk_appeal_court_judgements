"","then  prime  minister  told  him  to  continue  to  keep  the"
"","vehicle in order to serve the people."
"5.","At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  the  learned  President’s"
"","Counsel 
for 
the  appellant  submitted 
that, 
the  prime"
"","minster has given the appellant oral permission to retain"
"","the  vehicle.  However,  the 
learned  President’s  Counsel"
"","further submitted that, although he was not re-elected to"
"","the parliament, he has failed to return the vehicle. It was"
"","the  contention  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that,"
"","the appellant never received the letters said to have been"
"","sent 
to 
the  appellant  asking  him 
to  hand  over 
the"
"","vehicle,  and 
that  he  never 
intended 
to  commit  any"
"","offence."
"6.","Although 
it  was  not  pursued  at 
the  hearing  of 
this"
"","appeal, a further ground of appeal has been urged by the"
"","learned  President’s  Counsel  in  his  written  submissions."
"","That 
is, 
the  prosecution  has 
failed 
to  prove  beyond"
"","reasonable doubt that the vehicle in question falls within"
"","the  definition  of  public  property.  This  aspect  has  been"
"","sufficiently  considered  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"","in his judgment at page 37 (page 363 of the appeal brief)."
"","The evidence was adduced by the prosecution at the trial"
"","that, the vehicle in question was originally bought by the"
"","Ministry  of  Economic  Development  subject  to  a  leasing"
"","facility  from  the  Bank  of  Ceylon.  Thereafter,  the  vehicle"
"","was  handed  over  to  the  prime  minister’s  office.  Finally,"
"","the vehicle was handed over to the appellant through the"
"","prime  minister’s  office.  Hence, 
the  prosecution  has"
"","proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  this  vehicle  does"
"","fall  within  the  definition  of  public  property.  Thus,  the"
"","above ground of appeal should necessarily fail."
"7.","The  appellant has  taken up  the  position  that  he  did not"
"","receive  any  letters  asking  him  to  hand  over  the  vehicle,"
"","other  than  the  one  that  was  sent  through  registered"
"","post. 
In  his  statement 
from 
the  dock, 
the  appellant"
"","stated  that  he  received  one  letter  in  July  2016.  This"
"","aspect  was  also  sufficiently  considered  by  the  learned"
