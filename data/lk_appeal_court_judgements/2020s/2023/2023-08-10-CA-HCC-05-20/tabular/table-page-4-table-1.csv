"T
he Facts and circumstances are that;"
"It should be noted that the Accused was first indicted in 2008 for the same matter, and he"
"was convicted on all three counts on the 18th of March 2014. Against the conviction, an appeal"
"was preferred to the Court of Appeal, bearing case No. CA/146/2014. The matter was sent for"
"retrial by order dated 14th June 2018, as it was observed that the jury option was not given"
"to the Accused. Therefore, a retrial commenced on the 10th of February 2020, and the same"
"witnesses who testified about 12 years ago gave evidence."
"The evidence of the prosecution is as follows: On the fatal day of 20th June 1993, PW1 Sudu"
"Menika (the mother of the Deceased and an eyewitness who had sustained injuries during"
"the  incident)  was  residing  in  her  house  with  her  two  daughters,  namely  Weerasooriya"
"Muhandiramlage  Ramani  (PW2,  who  was  an  eyewitness  who  had  also  suffered  injuries),"
"Weerasooriya  Muhandiramlage  Wimalawathie  (PW4),  and  her  son  Nalin  Priyadharshana"
"(the Deceased)."
"The Accused, who was a relative, had whispered a proposition to PW2, who was 15 years of"
"age  at  that  time.  Subsequently,  PW2 rejected  the Accused’s  proposition, who  then  left  the"
"premises  and  returned with  a large  pole  hidden behind  his  back, which  was witnessed  by"
"Geetha Manel (PW3), who was also present at that time. The Accused struck PW2 with the"
"pole, flinging her to the ground. PW1 tried to intervene to save her daughter and was also"
"struck  on  the  head  by  the  Accused.  PW1’s  son,  who  witnessed  this,  jumped  around  his"
"mother’s neck in an attempt to protect her too, and was struck in the head by the Accused."
"Subsequently, the Deceased fell to the ground and was struck in the head repeatedly."
