"[2004] 1 SLR 154 at p. 163 observed:"
"“A writ of mandamus is available against a public or a statutory body performing statutory"
"duties  of  a  public  character.  In  order  to  succeed  in  an  application  for  a  writ  of  mandamus  the"
"petitioner has to show that he or she has legal right and the respondent corporate, statutory or"
"public body has a legal duty to recognize and give effect to the petitioner’s legal right. In the instant"
"case  the  Council  of  Legal  Education  has  decided  to  admit  to  the  Law  College  in  2002  all  those"
"candidates who have scored 70 marks and above at the Entrance Examination held in September"
"2001. The petitioner who has obtained only 56 marks at the said Examination has no legal right"
"to be admitted to the Law College on the results of the said Examination. Accordingly, there is no"
"corresponding  legal  duty  on  the  Council  of  Legal  Education  to  admit  the  petitioner  to  the  Law"
"College.”"
