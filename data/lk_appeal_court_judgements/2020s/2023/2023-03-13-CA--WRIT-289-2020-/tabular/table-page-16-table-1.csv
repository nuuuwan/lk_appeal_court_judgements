"The  Coughlan  standards  of  review  have been adopted  in  our  jurisprudence.  For"
"instance, his Lordship Arjuna Obeyesekere J. in Captain (Temporary) H.D.C. Perera v."
"Lt.  Gen  N.U.M.M.W.  Senanayake  &  Ors  (CA  Wrt  408/2018  CA  Minutes  31.08.2020)"
"studied the application of these standards. Similarly, his Lordship Janak De Silva J. in"
"Galle Municipal Council v. Galle Festival (Guarantee) Limited (CA (PHC) No. 155/2010"
"CA Minutes 01.03.2019) discussed the applicability of Coughlan’s third standard of review"
"in our law."
"Bearing  this  in  mind,  we  must  now  determine  whether  the  Petitioners  in  the"
"instant application will overcome these obstacles."
"In the instant case, some Petitioners have completed more than 3 years of service"
"at the National Water  Supply and Drainage  Board, whilst others have completed more"
"than 23 years of service."
"As alluded to above, the representation that the Petitioners are relying on is the"
"circulars;  Public  Administration  Circulars  Nos.  25/2014  (“P3”),  25/2014(I)  (“P4”)  and"
"29/2019 (“P17”) dated 12th November 2014, 29th December 2014 and 18th September 2019,"
"respectively, issued to all Secretaries of Ministries, Heads of Departments and Heads of"
"all State Corporations and Statutory Boards.  As stated in the body of the circulars, the"
"same has been issued with the concurrence of the Treasury. This was pointed out by the"
"Petitioners to dispel the notion that their absorption into the permanent cadre would not"
"burden  the  country’s  finances.  Further,  the  first  two  circulars  state  that  contract,"
"substitute, daily, and temporary employees can be made permanent provided they have"
"satisfied  certain  conditions  such  as  the  completion  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  employer"
"continuous 180 days of service, and minimum educational qualifications depending on the"
"grade/post  of  the  relevant  employees.  P4  (at  para.  5)  includes  temporary,  contract"
"employees who are serving in foreign-funded projects as well."
"However,  Public  Administration  Circulars  Nos.  25/2014  (“P3”), 25/2014(I)  (“P4”)"
"were  revoked  by  Public  Administration  Circular  No.  25/2014(II)  dated  4th  April  2016"
"(“P16”). The said Circular communicated the decision of the Cabinet dated 23rd February"
"2016 to revoke the previous two Circulars in a manner that would not cause any prejudice"
"to  those  employees  who would  have been  made  permanent  under  those  Circulars.  The"
"relevant paragraph reads:"
