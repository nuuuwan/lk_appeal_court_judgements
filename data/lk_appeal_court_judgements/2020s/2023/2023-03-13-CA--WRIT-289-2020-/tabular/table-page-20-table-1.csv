"Related to this application, especially in the light of the  sole prayer for a writ of"
"mandamus, is another question that arises for consideration."
"The  issuance  of  a  writ  of  mandamus  is  based  upon  the  satisfaction  of  certain"
"criteria that have been laid out in our case law. The clearest of such an enumeration of"
"criteria  is  found  in  Credit  Information  Bureau  of  Sri  Lanka  v.  Messrs  Jafferjee  and"
"Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd  [2005] 1 SLR 89. His Lordship J.A.N. De Silva, J. (as he then was),"
"with  their  Lordships  S.N.  Silva  C.J.  and  Weerasuriya  J.  agreeing,  set  out  some  of  the"
"prerequisites for issuing a Writ of Mandamus:"
"“There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on the conditions to be satisfied by the"
"Applicant. Some of the conditions precedent the issue of Mandamus appear to be:"
"(a) The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties against"
"whom  the  Mandamus  is  sought  (R  v  Barnstaple  Justices).  The  foundation  of  Mandamus  is  the"
"existence of a legal right (Napier Ex Parte)"
"(b) The right to be enforced must be a “Public Right” and the duty sought to be enforced must be of"
"a public nature."
"(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the Applicant himself (R v Lewisham Union)"
"(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect purpose"
"(e) The application must be preceded by a distinct demand for the performance of the duty"
"(f) The person or body to whom the writ is directed must be subject to the jurisdiction of the court"
"issuing the writ"
"(g) The Court will as a general rule and in the exercise of its discretion refuse writ of Mandamus"
"when  there  is  another  special  remedy  available  which  is  not  less  convenient,  beneficial  and"
"effective."
"(h) The conduct of the Applicant may disentitle him to the remedy."
"(i) It would not be issued if the writ would be futile in its result."
"(j)  Writ  will  not  be  issued  where  the  Respondent  has  no  power  to  perform  the  act  sought  to  be"
"mandated."
"The above principles governing the issue of a writ of Mandamus were also discussed at length in"
"P.K. Benarji v H.J. Simonds. Whether the facts show the existence of any or all pre-requisites to"
"the granting of the writ is a question of law in each case to be decided not in any rigid or technical"
"view of the question, but according to a sound and reasonable interpretation. The court will not"
