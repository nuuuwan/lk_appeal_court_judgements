"These words by him in pg. 97 suggest that he was working in the plantation, when he heard"
"the gun shot."
"“මම ශබ්දය ඇහිෙ මබේ ෙැඩ නෙත්ෙො අනිත් පැත්තට එන බොට...”"
"But as it was described above, he states in pg. 62/ 72/ 94, he was on the way to the plantation,"
"when he heard the gun shot in other places."
"Due to the above factors, the testimony of Thalpawila Widana Kankanamlage Cyril: PW 01."
"(The father of the deceased) is full of contradictions and omissions and thus is not credible at"
"all. There is a high degree of possibility that he is lying and narrating a fabricated tale."
"Contradictions  and  omissions  in  the  evidence  of  PW  02  is  also  important  in  regard  to  the"
"incident which was highlighted by the prosecution. In contradiction to his father's statement"
"that  his  deceased  brother  was  employed  in  the  army,  Thalpawila  Widana  Kankanamlage"
"Chaminda Lakmal: PW 02 (The brother of the deceased) states that his deceased brother was"
"not engaged in any job and was staying at home."
"On this fatal day they had dinner around 7.30 pm-8.00pm and his father left with his deceased"
"brother Sujith, his sister and a child called Premaratne who was a relative of them. (pg. 107/"
"110) This statement is contradictory to his father's (PW 01) statement that he started walking"
"towards the plantation, after a lapse of 5-10 minutes. In pg. 128-129, an omission is marked"
"upon his statement. He has not stated to the police that his sister went with them."
"In pg. 111 he states that when he closed a one half of the gate and was about to close the"
"other half of the gate, he heard a gunshot, from the side in which his new house was situated."
"Then he heard someone shouting, ""Father."" (pg. 111) Then he started running towards the"
"new house (pg. 127) in the main road. There was a distance of 200m from the gate to the new"
"house in the main road."
"In pg. 124 he states that on this specific date he had the idea of closing the gate and going to"
"their new house. (මම අලුත් බෙදරට යන්න හිතාබෙන හිටිබය)"
"But when he was cross-examined upon a contradictory statement to the police in pg. 126, he"
"admits that it is true."
