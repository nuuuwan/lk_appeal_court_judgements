"deceased) took a torch and a match box and started walking in the trail too. His intention was"
"to reach the fence of the new house, get out of the gate, cross the road and take the route,"
"which starts at the front of the new house to his plantation to kindle a fire to chase away the"
"wild boars, which arrive and destroys the new coconut plantation."

"coconut plantation. There are 150 yards/ 137.16 meters from the main road to his coconut"
"plantation. He goes about 41.5 meters when he hears a gun shot. Within seconds he hears"
"his daughter screaming ""Father, someone has shot ayya"". He stopped his walk and returned"
"to the main road towards the new house."
"When he was coming closer to the new house, and was at the edge of the main road he heard"
"somebody running. He flashed the torch light in that direction and he saw Pradeep Nishantha"
"the  1st  accused-appellant  (who  suddenly  disappeared  and  was  considered  dead)  running"
"towards the main road, with a long barrel gun in his hand. Jayadasa the accused-appellant"
"too was running behind him. There was about six and half meterâ€™s distance between them."
"They ran in front of him. They were wearing sarongs which they wore shortened. They were"
"running to the Radampola - Dickwela direction."

"of the deceased declares that these two (Pradeep Nishantha and Jayadasa) are cousins, and"
"known to them as fellow villagers. He admits that he didn't see the actual incident of shooting."
"When he reached the new house, he saw his deceased son sitting on a chair in the verandah"
"with a wound in his head, soaked in blood. The neighbours too then gathered and they took"
"steps to take him to the Batheegama hospital. The doctor checked him and declared that he"
"has succumbed to his injuries."
