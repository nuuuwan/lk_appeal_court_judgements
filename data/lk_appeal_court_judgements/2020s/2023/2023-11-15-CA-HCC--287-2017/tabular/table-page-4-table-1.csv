"contradictions marked before him. He had disregarded them as he believed that they would"
"not have a considerable bearing on the trustworthiness of prosecution witnesses."
"The learned counsel for the appellant invites court to apply the test of probability in respect"
"of  the  prosecution  witnesses.  It  should  be  noted  that  both  PW  01  and  PW  02  promptly"
"implicated the culpability of the accused in their statements to the police. There was no undue"
"delay in implicating the names of the accused to the police. The accused were known men in"
"the village. The house of the deceased accused was situated in close proximity to the new"
"house of PW 01. The witnesses said in his evidence, both accused were seen running towards"
"the said house of the deceased accused. When the accused was arrested, police recovered a"
"hand grenade from his possession."
"The accused testifying in the High Court and denied possessing of an offensive weapon such"
"as a hand grenade. He gives an impression to court that the police planted the hand grenade"
"to  vindicate  him.  But  subsequently  he  admitted  that  he  pleaded  guilty  to  a  charge  of"
"possession of an illegal offensive weapon in court. It raises the question as to why he opted"
"to plead guilty to a charge that was fabricated by Police. On behalf of the respondent the said"
"prosecution witnesses had testified in court without any exaggeration. As pointed out earlier,"
"the  prosecution  witnesses  could  have  easily  added  more  compelling  narrative  into  their"
"testimonies. But they professed the truth at all given times. The test of probability should be"
"applied in favour of the prosecution witnesses."

"accused-appellant pleaded a defence of Alibi. However, as provided for in the said alternative"
"situation, it makes mention of the fact that the deceased accused and the accused entered"
"the  jungle  for  the  purpose  of  hunting.  Based  on  the  above  fact,  it  is  not  possible  for  the"
"accused-appellant to take up the said defence and still suggest that the accused-appellant"
"was  in  the  company  of  the  deceased  accused  at  the  scene  of  the  crime.  On  behalf  of  the"
"respondent,  it  was  suggested  that  the  accused  appellant  is  not  telling  the  truth  in  this"
"situation."
"Further, with regards to the ground of appeal took forward by the learned  counsel for the"
"appellant,  it  is  evident  that  the  said  ground  of  appeal  appears  to  be  misleading  and  quite"
"confusing.  Thus,  the  prosecution  is  of  the  view  that  the  learned  counsel  is  attempt  in  to"
"mislead this court. He claims that even if this court tries to believe in the testimony of the two"
"eye  witnesses  that  it  only  proves  that  the  accused  appellant  ran  behind  a  man  who  was"
"holding a long-barrelled gun."
