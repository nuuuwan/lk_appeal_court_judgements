"his sister and a child called Premaratne who was a relative of them."
"Then he went down in the main route to the estate to close the gate. When he closed a one"
"half of the gate and was about to close the other half of the gate, he heard a gunshot, from"
"the side in which his new house was situated. Then he heard someone shouting, ""Father"" and"

"in 3-4 minutes, he heard somebody running fast towards him on the main road. He was in a"

"which was leading towards the house of Pradeep Nishantha (the 1st accused)"
"He saw Pradeep Nishantha running with a gun in his hand. Jayadasa too ran behind him. There"
"was about a distance of a meter between them. They were wearing sarongs shortened. When"
"he reached the new house, he found out that his brother has been shot dead."
