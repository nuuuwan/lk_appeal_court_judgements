"clause II of the prospectus marked as P2, a doctor who follows the course should obtain"
"a minimum percentage of 50 in each of the three components of the examination, and"
"if not obtained 50% in each component, even though the aggregate marks for the whole"
"examination is 50% or above he/she will be considered as failed. The Petitioner has"
"averred  in  the  Petition  that  many  irregularities  were  taken  place  in  conducting  the"
"Diploma as well as during the examination and he has complained in writing about the"
"same  before  and  after  the  examination  was  held  and  even  before  the  results  were"
"released."
"When the case was taken up for argument on 14.06.2010, the learned DSG appearing"
"for  the  Respondents  raised  preliminary  objections  about  the  maintainability  of  the"
"action and thereafter on 07.03.2011, the learned  Counsel for the Petitioner informed"
"Court that the Petitioner will not proceed with the reliefs sought in prayers (c) and (d)"
"and will restrict himself only to the reliefs prayed for in prayers (e) to (g) in the Petition."
"When the matter was taken up for argument on 06.06.2022, parties consented to dispose"
"of the matter on written submissions and accordingly, only the Petitioner has tendered"
"written submissions on 30.08.2022."
"The substantive reliefs prayed for in the Petition dated 06.10.2022 are as follows;"
"(e) issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision/results to"
"fail the Petitioner by the 24th Respondent (the PGIM) as reflected in the letter dated 21st"
"July 2008, marked as P10"
"(f) issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 24th Respondent"
"to include the Petitioner's name in the past list"
"(g) issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 24th Respondent"
"to award the Diploma in Sports Medicine to the Petitioner"
"Now I will address my mind to the reliefs sought by the Petitioner in prayers (e) to (g)"
"of the Petition which he is pressing upon. In prayer (e) the Petitioner seeks to issue a"
"Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the PGIM contained in P10 to fail him from"
"the examination. The learned DSG appearing for the Respondents argues that the relief"
"sought in prayer (e) is futile for the reason that the marks awarded in respect of the"
"clinical component have not been sought to be quashed."
