"The Petitioner has  stated in  the Petition that two examiners interviewed him on two"
"clinical cases (two patients) at the clinical component and alleges that out of those two"
"cases,  one  case  was  not  relevant  to  the  subject  matter  of  the  Diploma.  Further,  the"
"Petitioner alleges that both examiners who interviewed him were not qualified in the"
"relevant field of study as required by the applicable rules for the examiners issued by"
"the PGIM and therefore, they are disqualified to be the examiners and for that reason,"
"the examination panel  was not  properly constituted. The Petitioner alleges that even"
"though  there  should  be  two  examiners  at  the  examination  and  the  evaluation  of  the"
"clinical  cases  (the  two  patients),  when  the  Petitioner  had  the  consultation  with  the"
"patient in the second clinical case and when discussing the case with the examiners one"
"of  the  examiners  (Dr.  C.  Thurairaja)  was  not  at  the  bedside.  The  Petitioner  further"
"alleges that there were many irregularities and deficiencies involved in conducting the"
"Diploma and in the relevant examination and he had protested and complained against"
"the same (P11 and P6a). The Petitioner argues in terms of clause 4.1.1. of the P8 that"
"the two examination panellists (the 59th and the 60th Respondents) were not qualified to"
"function as examiners for the reason that they functioned as course supervisors as well"
"as main clinical trainers other than their role as examiners. Clause 4.1.1 states that;"
