"of Objections. Accordingly, it was proposed to reduce the retirement age of public sector and"
"semi-governmental employees to 60 years. Those who have been employed beyond 60 years"

"293/2007  decided  on  28th  November  2012,  Justice  Gooneratne  quoted  the  De  Smith's"
"'Judicial Review' (6th edition), it was held, inter alia, (at pages 423 to 426):"
"""It is clear that the reasons given must be intelligible and must adequately meet the substance"
"of the arguments advanced. It will not suffice to merely recite a general formula or restate a"
"statutorily  prescribed  conclusion.  It  is  also  preferable  if  reasons  demonstrate  a  systematic"
"analysis has been undertaken by the decision maker""."
"The  petitioners  were  granted  a  special  privilege  owing  to  the  sui  generis  nature  of  the"
"technical skills and expertise possessed by the Petitioners. Thus, the arbitrary decrease of the"
"compulsory age of retirement which had been entrenched for a period of time violates the"
"legitimate expectations of the Petitioners."

legal  certainty"
"deserves  protection.  Public  perception  of 
legal  certainty  becomes  negative  when 
the"
"authorities on their own have given assurances which give rise to their expectations and later"
"arbitrarily infringe the same."
