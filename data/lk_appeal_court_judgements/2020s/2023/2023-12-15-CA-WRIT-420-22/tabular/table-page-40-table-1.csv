"The respondents argued that the contention of the Petitioners that Doctors is a special class"
"of people in view of the compulsory age of retirement being placed at 63 years is erroneous"
"and misplaced. The decision to retire Doctors at 63 years was a policy decision taken by the"
"Cabinet of Ministers as evident by the Cabinet Memorandum dated 17.05.2021 marked P 2(a)"
"and the Cabinet Decision dated 14.06.2021 marked P2(b) to the Petition, owing to a shortage"
"of doctors prevailing at the time. The Respondents further state that the circumstances that"
"warranted an extension of the age of retirement of doctors was time centric as there were so"
"many vacancies at this time, and only limited number of doctors are serving this time."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the petitioners always says that all doctors are treated in"
"one category as the doctors, specialists, and dental surgeons. The Petitioners have a legitimate"
"expectation of being treated in the same category of doctors, specialists, and dental surgeons."
"The  doctors  and  medical  specialists  instituted  proceedings,  obtained  interim  orders,  and"
"finally appear to have obtained an undertaking that they will not retire until the age of 63, in"
"all Writ matters. The petitioners argued that the same rule shall apply to  all the Doctors as"
"there is a severe shortage of experienced Doctors."
"It is important to note that;"
"-By Gazette 2235/60 dated 8.7.2021 [P3], the retirement age of medical officers, dental"
"surgeons, and nurses were made 63."
"-By Circular dated 6.1.2022 [P6], the retirement age of doctors, dental surgeons and"
"nurses were proposed to be at 65."
"-By circular 14.9.2022 [P7], Doctors, specialists and medical officers, including nurses’"
"retirement age was proposed to be reduced to 60."
"It is evident that according to P8[1], Nurses, medical officers and dental surgeons’ retirement"
"age  was  reported  to  be  at  63.  In  the  aforesaid  circumstances  nurses,  medical  officers  and"
"specialists were treated in the same way. Thereafter by Gazette 2309/04 dated 05.12.2022"
"the retirement age of all government officers was reduced to 60. The doctors and medical"
"specialists filed several writ applications in this Court bearing No. CA WRIT 420/2022, CA WRIT"
"421/2022, CA WRIT 422/2022, CA Writ 473/22 and CA WRIT 54/2023. Interim orders in the"
"above matters were granted by this Court. The State gave an undertaking that the retirement"
"age of medical specialists and doctors would be 63 years. They will be permitted to serve until"
"31.12.2024. But it was revealed that, the doctors and medical specialists are not happy about"
"the dead line introduced by the Government. It is our view that the said deadline should not"
"be applied for all the doctors."
"In the circumstances the petitioners argued that the retirement age of all doctors should be"
"the same as retirement age of other medical officers. dental surgeons, medical consultants and"
"all medical specialists. In these circumstances the petitioners request that this Court should"
"quash the gazette which sets the retirement age at 60 for all doctors."
"In considering the above circumstances it is our view that there is a grave shortage of doctors"
"in the government sector. We take judicial notice that since 31.03.2023 for the past 8 months"
"nearly 1000 vacancies for doctors were created in the hospitals, due to various reasons. Some"
