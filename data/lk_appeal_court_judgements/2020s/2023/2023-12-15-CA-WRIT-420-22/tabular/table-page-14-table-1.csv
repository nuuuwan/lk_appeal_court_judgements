"Thus, it is further argued by the learned Counsel for the Added Respondents that the Article"
"61A  and  the  Article  104  H  (1)  of  the  Constitution  are  two 
incomparable  Constitutional"
"provisions  and  the  argument  of  the 
learned  President's  Counsel  for  the  petitioners 
is"
"completely misconceived in law."
"It  is  true  that  the  Courts  are  prevented  from  doing  something  indirectly  which  the  Court"
"cannot  do  directly.  Thus,  the  Petitioners  cannot  seek  from  this  Court  to  invoke  the  writ"
"jurisdiction 
indirectly  against 
the  Public  Service  Commission  and 
the  Health  Service"
"Committee of the Public Service Commission by seeking Writs of Prohibition to prevent the"

"service. I have no difficulty in agreeing with the submission made by the learned State"

"the Constitution in such a manner as to ensure that the elaborate scheme formulated"
"by the Seventeenth Amendment is given effect to the fullest extent."""

"select Agricultural Instructors had been conducted by the Secretary, Ministry of Agricultural"
"Development in terms of the powers delegated by the Public Service Commission."
"Sisira De Abrew, J upheld the argument, of the respondents that in view of the provisions of"
"Article  61A  of  the  Constitution,  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  no  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into  the"
"conducting  of  the  examination,  and  that  the  petitioners  could  not  have  invoked  the  writ"
"jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to quash the results of the said examination."

"Judgements  in  the  Ratnasiri  and  Others  case  and the  Hewa  Pedige  Ranasingha  and  Others"
"case has also held that the Court of Appeal cannot exercise the writ jurisdiction in matters"
"against the Public Service Commission. Therefore, its trite law that the writ jurisdiction vested"
"in this court is ousted by Article 61A of the Constitution to grant any mandate in the nature of"
"writs  against 
the  Public  Service  Commission,  a  committee  or  a  public  officer  of  the"
"Commission."
