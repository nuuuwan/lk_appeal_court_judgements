"(b) where that officer is Head of a Department, the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry to"
"which  that  Department  is  attached  considers  that  his  services  should  be  retained  in  the"
"interest of the service."
"Rule  5  defines  the  ""competent  authority""  to  mean  ""the  authority  competent  to  make"
"appointments to the office held by that officer."""
"In terms of the above provisions, the power of the extension of employment of any public"
"officer beyond the age of compulsory retirement is entirely vested in the competent authority,"
"which is the Public Service Commission in terms of Article 55(3) and Article 55(5) read with"
"the above provisions. The learned Counsel for the respondents submits that the Petitioners"
"cannot  rely  on  an  invalid  and  no  longer  legally  valid  Minutes  on  Pensions,  marked  P3  and"
"elevate  it  to  the  level  of  a  statutory  underpinning  when  the  rules  promulgated  under  the"
"Public  and  Judicial  Officers  (Retirement)  Ordinance  No.  21  of  1917,  set  the  law  on  age  of"
"retirement for all public officers. It is only the Parliament that can increase such this age."
"The respondents state that the contention of the Petitioners that doctors are a special class"
"of people in view of the compulsory age of retirement being placed at 63 years is erroneous"
"and misplaced. The decision to retire Doctors at 63 years was a policy decision taken by the"
"Cabinet of Ministers as evident by the Cabinet Memorandum dated 17.05.2021 marked P 2(a)"
"and the Cabinet Decision dated 14.06.2021 marked P2(b) to the Petition, owing to a shortage"
"of doctors prevailing at the time. The Respondents further state that the circumstances that"
"warranted an extension of the age of retirement of doctors was time centric as there were"
"2500 odd vacancies at the time."
"Learned Additional Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that in"
"contrast, as evinced at present there are enough doctors, hence, the requirement that existed"
"in  2021,  no  longer  exists  at  present  and  therefore  the  revision  of  the  compulsory  age  of"
"retirement in issue has no impact on the health sector."
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the petitioners always says that all doctors are treated in"
"one  category  as  the  Doctors,  Specialists  and  Dental  Surgeons.  The  petitioners  have  a"
"legitimate expectation of being treated in the same category of Doctors, Specialists and Dental"
"Surgeons. The doctors and medical specialists instituted proceedings, obtained interim orders,"
"and finally appear to have obtained an undertaking that they will not retire until the age of"
"63,  in  the  case  of  CA  WRIT  420/2022,  CA  WRIT  421/2022,  CA  WRIT  422/2022,  CA  WRIT"
"473/2022 and CA WRIT 54/2023. The petitioners argued that the same rule shall apply to all"
"doctors."
"It is important to note that;"
