"v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 118/17, Decided on 09.11.2018:"
"“Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this appeal, it should"
"be borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on circumstantial evidence to establish"
"the charges, for the reason that there were no eyewitnesses to substantiate any of the charges"
"against the Accused-Appellant. Thus, it was incumbent on the prosecution to establish that"
"the ‘circumstances’ the prosecution relied on, are consistent only with the guilt of the accused-"
"appellant and not with any other hypothesis."
