"2.  Considering the evidence/ law of the case could the finding that the appellant was in"
"exclusive possession or was trafficking the cocaine be sustained?"
"The facts of the case are briefly summarized as follows:"
"PW01, IP Subodha, acting on information received from PC Gupta, who had received"
"information  from  a  private  informant,  regarding  the  trafficking  of  Cocaine,  led  a  team  of"
"officers to conduct a search operation. According to his testimony, he accompanied PW02 to"
"the  5th  floor  of  Blue  Hill  Residencies  Apartment,  where  they  apprehended  Mohommed"
"Guhari Rasik and the Accused in possession of a bag containing 516g of Cocaine. The Accused"
"has  been  indicted  for  this  offense  by  the  Honorable  Attorney  General,  and  the  case  is"
"currently pending."
"On the following day, after presenting the Accused before the Mt. Lavinia Magistrate"
"Court  and  obtaining  a  detention  order,  the  Accused  provided  a  statement  indicating  the"
"presence  of  more  contraband  at  his  residence.  Acting  on  this  information,  the  officers"
"proceeded to the address disclosed by the Accused."
"Upon arrival at the location, a woman believed to be the Accused's wife granted the"
"officers access to the premises. During their search, the officers discovered a plastic container"
"in the kitchen containing a bag of cocaine weighing 1048g."
"In his dock statement, the Accused denied the allegations against him. He contended"
"that he was arrested at Dehiwala while waiting for a bus and that the parcel was shown to"
"him after the officers searched his residence upstairs while he was downstairs. Furthermore,"
"he asserted that there was no kitchen upstairs in his house."
"The Learned High Court Judge convicted the Accused on the grounds of discovering"
"cocaine under Section 27 of the Recovery of Property Ordinance at the said premises, where"
"the Accused was the primary occupant. However, the Learned High Court Judge neglected"
"to assess whether the prosecution had established the actual and exclusive possession of the"
"Accused."
"According to Sir Hari Singh Gour in his book ""The Penal Law of India,"" he has stated:"
"""Possession to be criminal must be actual and exclusive. For criminal liability does not apply"
"to constructive possession."""
