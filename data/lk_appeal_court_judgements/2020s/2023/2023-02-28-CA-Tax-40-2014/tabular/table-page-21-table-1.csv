"appeal,  in  the  process  jeopardizing,  nay  even  violating  the  basic  procedural"
"rights of the appellant."
"There  is  another  thing  which  prejudiced  the  tax  payer.  After  the  appellant"
"appealed  to  the  Commissioner  General,  the  determination  of  the  Deputy"
"Commissioner was dated 04th November 2013. This gives the computation of"
"the tax liability and says Total Payable is Rs. 111,838,663/-. Twenty five per"
"centum of this is Rs. 27,959,665.75. This is what the appellant deposited at"
"the time of preferring its appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission. It is after the"
"appellant indicating its intention to appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission that"
"the Deputy Commissioner sends her reasons for the determination. It was on"
"27th November 2013 that the appellant indicated to the Secretary to the Tax"
"Appeals  Commission,  its  intention  to  appeal.  The  respondent  has  stated  at"
"page 19, paragraph 77 of its written submissions dated 08th December 2022,"
"that, “the reasons are sent once a tax payer communicates to the TAC that he"
"is aggrieved by the decision of the CGIR and upon the TAC requesting the CGIR"
"to send reasons”."
"The  reasons  sent  are  dated  02nd  January  2014,  nearly  2  months  after  the"
"determination. It was in the reasons that the Deputy Commissioner has stated,"
"that, “…Accordingly 25% of the tax payable is Rs. 46,237,087/-."
"This is not to question the procedure of Deputy Commissioner acting on behalf"
"of the Commissioner sending reasons for determination only if the tax payer"
"expresses its intention to appeal. The appellant can appeal within 30 days of"
"the  receipt  of  reasons.  But  a  determination  being  provided  without  reasons"
"and reasons coming only at the time of deciding to prefer an appeal to the Tax"
"Appeals Commission is more the reason that the Secretary to the Tax Appeals"
"Commission grants an opportunity to rectify any error [although the error, in this"
"case, was not on the part of the appellant] without rejecting the appeal the appellant"
"not  being  heard.  This  is  why  it  was  said,  “With  great  power  comes  great"
"responsibility”."
