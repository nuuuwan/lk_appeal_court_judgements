"The Magistrates had overruled the objection and had proceeded to trial"
"and  being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order  the  appellant  had  made  an"
"application  for  revision  to  the  High  Court  and  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge had held with the Magistrate."
"The instant application is against the said orders."
"The appellant in the submissions made orally and  in writing had taken"
"the  same  position  and  the  Attorney  General  had  objected  to  the"
"application."
"Upon  consideration  of  the  submissions  of  both  sides  it  is  pertinent  to"
"note the manner in which legal proceedings are commenced before the"
"Magistrate."
"Under  chapter  XIV  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  it  is  stated  that"
"criminal  proceedings  commences  before  the  Magistrate  once  a  plaint"
"and charge sheet is filed."
"But in the instant matter when the Magistrate made the order for the"
"suspect to be discharged on 22.9.2016 there had been no charge sheet"
"or plaint filed against the suspect. Hence the Magistrate could not have"
"acquitted the suspect because he was only a suspect and not an accused."
"Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that there was no bar"
"for  the  Attorney  General  to  have  instructed  the  police  to  file  charges"
"under the relevant act against the suspect and for the learned Magistrate"
"to have accepted the same."
"As such we see no irregularity or an illegality in the order of the learned"
"High Court Judge in holding with the Magistrate."
