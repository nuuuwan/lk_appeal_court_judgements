"detriment of the investor whilst not strictly enforcing the rules against the broker firm. Such"
"conduct, reflects the general perception of bias of the CSE in favour of its members, when"
"resolving  disputes  between  brokers  and  investors.  The  Petitioners  were  dismayed  by  the"
"decision of the CSE Panel, as it had refused the Petitioners' relief notwithstanding the fact that"
"the Panel has clearly identified and observed that the Stockbroker Firm has violated several"
"CSE Rules set out below:"
"(i)  
Rule  3.2.1  of  the  Section  3  of  the  Stockbroker  Rules  of  the  CSE  Stockbroker"
"Firms  shall  within  a  period  of  6  months  from  the  date  of  adoption  of  these"
"rules: use a telephone recording system with notice to the client, to record the"
"order  instructions  including  date  and  time  of  the  order  and  maintain  such"
"telephone  recordings  as  part  of  its  records  for  at  least  six  (6)  years  for  the"
"purposes  of  these  Rules,  or  ensure  that  the  order  instructions  are  received"
"from clients in writing and such written instructions are maintained as part of"
"its records for at least six (6) years"
"(ii)  
Rule 7. 1. 3 (2) of the Section 7 of the Stockbroker Rules of the CSE The credit"
"extended to a client shall not exceed 50% of the Market Value of the Securities"
"portfolio  held  in  the  client's  CDS  account.  For  the  purposes  of  these  Rules"
"'Market  Value'  is  defined  as  the  value  of  the  Securities  portfolio  held  in  the"
"client's  CDS  account,  including  Pending  Buys,  and  excluding  Pending  Sells,"
"marked to market at the end of each Market Day."
"At page 5 of the Decision marked P13, the Panel also expressly acknowledges Rule 3.2.2 of"
"Section 3 of the CSE Rules that provide as follows;"
"""In the event of a complaint made by a client against a Stockbroker Firm relating to a"
"particular  transaction,  if  it  is  revealed  that  the  order  instructions  have  not  been"
"recorded and maintained by the Stockbroker Firm as required in terms of Rule 3.2.1"
"above, it shall be the responsibility of the Stockbroker Firm to provide sufficient proof"
"that the Stockbroker Firm received order instructions from the client pertaining to the"
"disputed transaction. If the Stockbroker Firm fails to do so, the Stockbroker Firm shall"
"be held liable""."
"It is clear from a plain reading of Rule 3.2.2 that where a transaction is disputed, if the stock"
"broker fails to establish with sufficient proof that the order instructions were received from"
"the client, the stock broker firm shall be held liable, for the particular transactions."
"Despite the express acknowledgement of the said Rule 3.2.2 and the aforesaid finding that"
"Rule 3.2.1 has been violated, which affirm a clear violation of the CSE Rules and contractual"
"obligations of the Stockbroker firm, the CSE Panel has informed the Complainants that,"
"""the  Panel  appointed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  CSE  in  respect  of  the"
"captioned  Complaint  has,  decided  that  the  Panel  cannot  proceed  any  further  with"
"regard to the Complaint."""
"The  primary  reason  for  CSE  Panel  to  refuse  relief  was, 
inter  alia,  that,  no  exceptional"
"circumstances, were demonstrated in order to waive the application of Rule 2.16.1 of section"
