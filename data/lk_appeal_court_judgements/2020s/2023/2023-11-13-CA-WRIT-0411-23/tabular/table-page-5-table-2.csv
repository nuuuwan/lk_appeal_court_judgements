"In  view  of  the  serious  repercussions  of  purchasing  shares  and  effectively  imposing  broker"
"credit  without  prior  consent,  on  receipt  of  the 
'bought  notes'  pertaining  to  aforesaid"
"purchases;"
"a.  
The Petitioners acted in compliance with the instructions set out in the ""bought"
"notes""  which  state  that  ""If  there  are  any  errors  or  discrepancies  you  are"
"requested to contact us by 9:00 a.m. on the following day following the receipt"
"of  this  confirmation.  Failure  to  do  so  would  be  taken  as  acceptance  of  the"
"trades confirmed herein"" and verbally complained to the 5th Respondent"";"
"b.  
The Petitioners continued to repeatedly complain to the 5th Respondent and"
"inquired  as  to  why  such  shares  were  purchased,  as  the  Petitioners  had  not"
"instinct the purchase of such shares and as prior order instructions were not"
"provided by the Petitioners;"
"c.  
The 5th Respondent accepted the position that it was a disputed transaction"
"and repeatedly assured the Petitioners that he would take steps to regularize"
"the  process  and 
reinstate 
their  portfolio  and 
that 
they  would  not  be"
"detrimentally affected;"
"d.  
By virtue of the repeated reassurances, and by assuring the Petitioners that he"
"was acting in their best interests, the 5th Respondent cleverly ensured that the"
"Petitioners would not tender a written complaint in the hope of maintaining a"
"cordial, amicable relationship with the Investment Advisor. However, while the"
"Petitioners did not make a written complaint they continued to inquire into and"
"protest  and  object  to  the  purchases  that  had  been  made  without  order"
"instructions from the Petitioners."
"e.  
Thereafter, on or about the 10th of February 2022, on the specific request of"
"the  5th  Respondent  to  make  even  a  small  payment,  the  Petitioners  made  a"
"payment  of  Rs.5,482,240.00 
(a  figure 
specifically 
suggested  by 
the  5th"
"Respondent)  and  categorically 
informed  the  4th  Respondent  and  the  5th"
"Respondent that such payment was made without prejudice and did not in any"
"way signify consent and acquiesce to the illegal and unlawful purchases;"
"f.  
Furthermore, as the Petitioners expected to carry out other transactions, they"
"anticipated 
that 
the  aforesaid  payment  could  be  used 
for 
subsequent"
"purchases, such as the purchase of shares from Seylan Bank PLC in respect of"
"which  order  instructions  had  already  been  given.  Further,  the  said  amount"
"could also round up and lower the average of the shares in the portfolio of the"
"Appellants. In any event, a receipt has not been issued in respect of the said"
"payment, to-date."
