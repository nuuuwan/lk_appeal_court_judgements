"stating that this was where the body was buried. This piece of evidence was challenged"
"by the Accused."
"It must be noted that his statement was recorded 2½ months after the incident."
"No reason was given for this delay. We are mindful of the Accused's allegation in their"
"grounds of appeal."
"We are mindful that PW8 IP Rukmal, who conducted the investigation, was not"
"called  to  give  evidence  at  the  trial.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  only  relied  on  the"
"premise  of  the  evidence  postulated  by  the  10  witnesses  that  were  summoned,  as  the"
"prosecution had not elicited the reason as to why the Accused had committed the murder"
"of the Deceased, as there had been no evidence postulated by the witnesses regarding this"
"issue.  This  raises  the  question  as  to  whether  the  evidence  relied  upon  by  the  Learned"
"High Court Judge is enough to convict the Accused of the Murder of the Deceased."
"The Accused’s version:"
"The Accused testified under oath that he used to live at the house at No. 18 Matin"
"Lane, which was given by his grandfather, as it was owned by his relatives. The Accused"
"and his wife moved into that house during that time, and the old lady had been residing"
"there for seven years. It was pointed out that she was not the owner of that house. The"
"Accused,  his  wife,  and  their  child  (who  was  born  later)  resided  there  along  with  the"
"Deceased,  as  she  was  asked  to  stay  behind  instead  of  going  to  an  elder's  home.  After"
"finding out about his wife's previous marriage, which was not disclosed to him, he engaged"
"in a physical altercation with his wife. Later on, after his father-in-law committed suicide,"
"his brother-in-law and his wife assaulted him. Afterward, he lived at his friend's house,"
"which was on the same road in front of his house. Due to a dispute with Chooti, he reported"
"the Accused to the Army intelligence unit due to his affiliation with the LTTE, where he"
"was later apprehended towards the end of November 2008. He was assaulted and confined"
"for 26 days. In his re-examination, he was released on the 26th of January 2009. After"
"that, when he returned home, his wife, child, and the old lady were not at home. Upon"
"further inspection, PW2 told him that his wife and child were not there anymore, and he"
"later learned that his wife had left with Chooti. He then reported this to the police, who"
"merely overlooked his complaint. One night, when he was alone, the roof of his house was"
"set  on  fire,  and  succumbing  to  fear,  he  lived  with  his  grandfather.  When  he  was  at  a"
"church, he was put into a police jeep, and upon being arrested, he was inquired about the"
"whereabouts of the old lady, of whom he had no knowledge of her disappearance."
