"We are mindful of the following Indian judgement that was considered by our judges when"
"dealing with circumstantial evidence:"
"In  the  case  of  Hanumant  Govind  Nargundkar  and  another  v.  State  of  Madhya"
"Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 343 at Page 345, Mahajan, J held that ,"
"“In  dealing  with  circumstantial  evidence  the  rules  specially  applicable  to  such"
"evidence must be borne in mind. In such cases there is always the danger that conjecture"
"or suspicion may take the place of legal proof and therefore, it is right to recall the warning"
"addressed by Baron Alderson, to the jury in Reg v. Hodge ((1838) 2 Lew. 227), where he"
"said :-"
"""The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and"
"even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to from parts of one connected"
"whole;  and  the  more  ingenious  the  mind  of  the  individual,  the  more  likely  was  it,"
"considering such matters to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that"
"is  wanting,  to  take  for  granted  some  fact  consistent  with  its  previous  theories  and"
"necessary to render them complete."""
"It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,"
"the circumstances  from which  the  conclusion  of  guilt  is  to  be drawn  should  in the  first"
"instance  be fully established, and  all  the  facts  so  established should be consistent  only"
"with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a"
"conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis"
"but the one proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so"
"far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the"
"innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability"
"the act must have been done by the accused.”"
