"Jerome who had committed the murder of Lily Mary."
"The  question  before  us  is  whether  the  prosecution  has  established  sufficient"
"evidence  for  the  court  to  form  an  inference  that  the  one  and  only  irresistible  and"
"inescapable conclusion is that the Accused himself committed this crime."
"To answer this question, we focus on the evidence led by the prosecution before the"
"trial:"
"According to PW1 Jayakumaran Rajkumaran, a relative (great-grandson) of the"
"deceased, he was informed by the Accused's wife, Jerome Roxy, and his mother-in-law,"
"Anthony  Ritamalar  (PW2),  about the killing and  burying  of  his  relative, the Deceased."
"According to PW1, it was an assumption that the Deceased's body could be at the house."
"During this time, the Accused's wife and PW2, after quarreling with the Accused, were"
"residing close to PW1's house. This is when they decided to tell PW1 that the Deceased's"
"body was at their house (the Accusedâ€™s house). PW1 had already lodged a complaint three"
"days after her disappearance and was later notified by the Accused's wife and PW2 about"
"the  Deceased's  demise.  PW1  and  his  brother-in-law  then  lodged  a  complaint  with  the"
"Police,  who  conducted  the  investigation  and  recovery  of  the  Deceased's  body  from  the"
"Accused's house. The place was pointed out by the Accused's wife and PW2, and they dug"
"up  and  recovered  the  decayed  body.  PW1  identified  the  decayed  body  as  that  of  his"
"relative."
"In his cross-examination, it was put forward that the Accused's wife had made the"
"complaint to the police station two months after the killing of the Deceased, and that the"
"particular place where the body was buried was exactly pointed out by the Accused's wife,"
