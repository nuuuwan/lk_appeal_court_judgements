"Thereafter, he learned that his wife had reported to the police that he had killed"
"and buried the body of the Deceased. He was assaulted while under custody. Prior to these"
"events, he stated that the Deceased had informed him that Chooti used to visit their house"
"and give money to his wife from the Accused's bank account. Eight people were arrested"
"alongside him on that day."
"In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not know where his family had gone"
"to, and he did not take any action to find them as he feared that he would be taken by the"
"Army and assaulted again."
"We must note that in the evidence given by the Accused from the evidence box,"
"he was not questioned about the gold jewelry that was sold off to the goldsmiths by the"

"who resided in his house."

"follows: “In criminal proceedings against any person the husband or wife of such person"
"respectively  shall  be  a competent  witness  if  called  by the  accused,  but  in that case,  all"
"communications between them shall cease to be privileged.”"

"24. It is proved that it was the wife of the accused, Roxy who had given all the information"
"with regard to the murder to the police and had assist the police to recover the corpse."
"She is now dead."
"On  the  other  hand,  the  Learned  High  Court  judge  has  failed  to  consider  the"
"following evidence;"
