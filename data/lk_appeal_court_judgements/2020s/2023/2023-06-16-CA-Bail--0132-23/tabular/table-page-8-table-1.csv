"The Section 15 B of PTA (Amendment) Act No. 12 of 2022 states:"
"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the provisions of this Act, if"
"the trial against a person remanded or detained under this Act has not"
"commenced  after  the  expiration  of  twelve  months,  from  the  date  of"
"arrest,  the  Court  of  Appeal  may  release  such  person  on  bail,  upon  an"
"application in that behalf, made by the suspect or an Attorney- at Law"
"on his behalf:"
"In  15  B  of  PTA  (Amendment)  Act  No.  12  of  2022,  the  key  word  is  “the"
"trial”. If the trial has not commenced after 12 months from the date of"
"arrest, 
the  Court 
of  Appeal  may 
release 
such  person 
on  bail,"
"irrespective of whether the suspect has been indicted or not. Unless the"
"trial is commenced, sending out indictment to relevant High Court does"
"not preclude the suspect seeking bail from the Court of Appeal. The bail"
"jurisdiction  of 
the  Court  of  Appeal  under  Section  15  B  of  PTA"
"(Amendment) Act No.12 of 2022 only shifts to High Court once the trial"
"is commenced in the High Court."
"The  plain  meaning  of  the  “trial”  is  the  ‘formal  examination  before  a"
"competent tribunal of the matter in issue in a civil or criminal cause in"
"order  to  determine  such  issue’.  Hence,  serving  the  indictment  on  the"
"accused  does  not  preclude  the  Petitioner  invoking  the  jurisdiction  of"
"this Court for bail under Section 15 B of PTA(Amendment) Act No.12 of"
"2012.  This  entitlement  only  shifts  once  the 
formal  trial  commence"
"before the High Court upon filing an indictment. As long as the trial is"
"not  commenced  after  filing  the  indictment  before  the  High  Court,  the"
"suspect is legally entitled to seek bail before the Court of Appeal."
"Even though the accused has already exhausted his rights of invoking"
"the original jurisdiction of the High Court at-Bar under Section 15 B of"
"the PTA as amended, his entitlement to come before the Court of Appeal"
