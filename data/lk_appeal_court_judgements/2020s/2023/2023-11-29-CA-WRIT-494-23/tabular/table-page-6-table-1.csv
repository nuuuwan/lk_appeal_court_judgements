"The statutory duty of the Respondents."
"The Petitioner submits that the 3rd,4th, and 5th Respondents have  failed to perform the statutory"
"duty cast on them to survey the temple land. In view of the said submission, in order to obtain the"
"relief  he  seeks,  it  is  incumbent  for him to demonstrate that there is a statutory duty cast on the"
"3rd,4th, and 5th Respondents towards him which the said Respondents have failed to perform."
"This Court specifically asked  from the  learned  Counsel  for the Petitioner to demonstrate to the"
"Court the provision he relies on which a statutory duty is cast on the Survey General to survey a"
"land that has been settled in favour of the temple. The learned Counsel failed to draw our attention"
"to such a provision."
"It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner has failed to submit to this Court as to whether the"
"said land falls within the area where the Title Registration Act is enforced and whether a cadastral"
"survey  should  have  been  conducted.  Accordingly,  as  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  submit  to this"
"Court the statutory duty that the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Respondents have failed to perform, the Petitioner"
"has failed to establish the alleged statutory duty which he seeks to enforce through this Application."
