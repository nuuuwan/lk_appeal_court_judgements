"Industries v Minister of Labour & Vocational Training (1998) 1"
"SLR 235)”"
"I
n the said context, further to the evidence that had been led - it is"
"apparent that the Petitioners had no intention (mental element) of"
"abandonment or vacation from their post, but were compelled to"
"such a position physically, due to detainment in prison until they"
"were  discharged.  In  such  a  background,  the  Petitioners  contend"
"that  the  determination  of  the  5th  Respondent  to  deem  that  they"
"vacated their post is not just and equitable. In deciding the said"
"issue,  the  1st  Respondent  Arbitrator  had  identified  8  pertinent"
"issues to be answered in that regard. However, it is the view of this"
"Court  that  the  Arbitrator  has  not  thoroughly  considered  the"
"circumstances of the case and the position of the Petitioners in a"
"just  and  equitable  manner  and  in  particular,  the  fact  that  the"
"Petitioners had no intention to vacate their post."
"F
or the above reasons, this Court is inclined to issue a mandate in"
"the  nature  of  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  quashing 
the  aforesaid"
"award/decision of the 1st Respondent marked as 'X17' appearing"
"in 
the  Gazette  notification  bearing  No.  2191/42  and  dated"
"04.09.2020 marked ‘X18’."
"H
owever, this Court is cognizant of the fact that despite the need"
"for compensation being presented during submissions on behalf of"
"the  Petitioners,  the  pleadings  fail  to  rightfully  establish  and/or"
"pray for an accurate claim against the 5th Respondent."
"F
or  the  foregoing  reasons,  A  Writs  of  Certiorari  quashing  the"
"Arbitral Award made by the 1st Respondent marked as P17 and the"
"Gazette  Notification  bearing  No.  2191/42  dated  04-09-2020"
"marked as X18 is issued."
