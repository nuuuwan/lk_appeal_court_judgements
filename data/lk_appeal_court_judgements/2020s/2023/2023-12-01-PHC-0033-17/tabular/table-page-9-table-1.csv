"CA (PHC) 33/17"
"In Nandasena v Senanayake and Others [1981] 1 SLR 238 the Court"
"held that:"
"“Statutes should be construed, as far as possible, to avoid absurdity"
"or futility. A statute should be construed in manner to give it validity"
"rather than invalidity- ut res magis valeat quam pereat”."
"The  judicial  decisions  cited  above  and  the  writings  amply  demonstrate"
"that  the  Court  cannot  under  the  guise  of 
interpretation  usurp  the"
"intention of the legislature."
"In this case the Learned Magistrate as well as the Learned High Court"
"Judge had followed the literal interpretation of the section concerned."
"In 
the 
recent 
judgment 
in  TAB  1A 
and  1B/2020  decided 
on"
"11/01/2023, His Lordship Kodagoda,PC, J. held that:"
"“ 
In  the  circumstances 
it 
is  clear  that,  the  Supreme  Court  when"
"deciding  Anoma  S.Polwatte  v.  Director  General  Commission  to"
"Investigate  Allegation  of  Bribery  and  Corruption 
(supra)  had"
"never 
intended 
to 
impose  an  additional  requirement 
to  submit  a"
"written directive  when filing charges before Court,  and  therefore this"
"Court  is  not  inclined  to  impose  an  additional  requirement  other  than"
"the provisions already identified….”"
"Considering the interpretation given to the Section 78(1) of the Bribery"
"Act  by  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge,  written  sanction  requirement  is"
"unnecessary and only cause an additional requirement which certainly"
"obstruct  or  delay  the  smooth  function  of  the  Bribery  Act.  This  Court"
"satisfies  that  the  Bribery  Commission  had  given  directions  to  institute"
"proceeding  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Colombo  under  section  78(1)"
"which  had  been  correctly  endorsed  by  the  High  Court  of  Colombo  as"
"written sanction requirement contemplated by the Appellant would only"
"be superfluous."
