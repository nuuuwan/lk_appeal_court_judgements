"As stated by Salmond, “by interpretation or construction is meant, the"
"process  by  which  the  courts  seek  to  ascertain  the  meaning  of  the"
"legislature  through  the  medium  of  authoritative  forms  in  which  it  is"
"expressed”."
"Interpretation of statutes is the process of ascertain the true meaning of"
"the  words  used  in  a  statute.  When  language  is  of  the  statue  is  clear,"
"there is no need the rules of Interpretation, But, in certain cases, more"
"than one meaning may be derived from the same word or sentence. It is"
"therefore necessary to interpret the statue to find out the real intention"
"of the statute."
