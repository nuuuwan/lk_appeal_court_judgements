"An  important  bench  of  five  Justices  of  Supreme  Court  in  Attorney"
"General and Others v. Sumathipala [2006] 2 SLR 126 held that:"
"“A judge cannot under a thin guise of interpretation usurp the"
"function of the legislature to achieve a result that the Judge thinks"
"is  desirable  in  the  interests  of  justice.  Therefore,  the  role  of  the"
"judge is to give effect to the expressed intention of Parliament as it"
"is the bounden duty of any Court and the function of every Judge"
"to do justice within the stipulated parameters.”"
