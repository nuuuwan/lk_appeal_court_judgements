"As  stated  before,  the  position  of  the  petitioner  had  been  that  there  was  no"
"violation of the provisions of the relevant section. Since there was no dispute as"
"to the fact that the cigarettes contained in the boxes are legally manufactured"
"cigarettes and the packets of cigarettes and the cartons found inside the boxes"
"had the necessary pictorial warning, the matter that had to be decided by the"
"Court  was  only  whether  the  outer  6  boxes  which  admittedly  had  no  pictorial"
"warning violates the provisions of the Act and nothing else."
"It is clear from the applications initially made before the learned Magistrate of"
"Chilaw,  those  applications  had  been  made  with  the  clear  intention  of  causing"
"maximum difficulties and loss to the petitioner. The cigarettes the petitioner had"
"in his possession were legally manufactured products permitted to be sold in the"
"open market. There cannot be any argument that the relevant manufacturer has"
"paid  due  taxes  for  the  cigarettes  manufactured  before  releasing  them  to  its"
"authorized  agent  for  the  purpose  of  sale.  It  is  an  admitted  fact  that  the  end"
"product that would in fact go into the hands of a consumer or a customer had"
"the  necessary  warning  as  required  by  law.  Therefore,  the  matter  that  would"
"necessarily be required to be determined by the learned Magistrate was a matter"
"of a technical nature."
"I  do  not  find  any  basis  for  the  application  made  by  the  learned  Senior  State"
"Counsel who represented the respondent before the Magistrate Court to send all"
"the 6 large boxes along with its contents to the Government Analyst."
"As  pointed  out  correctly  by  the  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel,  the  Government"
"Analyst  would  not  be  able  to  answer  any  of  the  questions  raised  in  a  positive"
"manner, if the productions were in fact sent to the Government Analyst."
"There was no dispute before the Court that the tobacco found in the cigarettes"
"belongs to the Ceylon Tobacco Company. The Government Analyst would not be"
"able to express an opinion whether the petitioner has violated the provisions of"
"the Act which is a matter for the Court to determine after a proper trial. There"
"was no dispute that the 6 large boxes are boxes made of cardboard."
