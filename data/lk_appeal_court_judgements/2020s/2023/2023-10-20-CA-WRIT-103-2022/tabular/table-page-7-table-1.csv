"an investigation report was rejected solely because it implicated others. It seems that the report"
"would be administratively inconvenient if it was provided. In the event that an individual alleges"
"that they were not afforded the opportunity to obtain and present particular documents during"
"an investigation, it is imperative that they elucidate to the Court precisely how said documents"
"would have had a substantial bearing on their case during the review process. Mere allegations of"
"being denied an opportunity do not hold enough weight for courts to exert its review powers. It is"
"important to note that the Court carefully considers both the facts and the law when making a"
"decision.  In  this  case,  the  Petitioners  have  not  specified  how  the  alleged  documents  that  the"
"Respondents  failed  to  provide  strongly  influenced  the 1st  Respondent's decision  or  how  it  had"
"caused any prejudice to the Petitioners during the inquiry. Therefore, I am of the view that the"
"Petitionerâ€™s right to a fair hearing had not been violated merely because they were denied access"
"to the investigation report."
