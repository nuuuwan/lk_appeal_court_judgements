"Considering above portions of the judgment, the Learned High Court Judge"
"had very clearly, extensively and correctly considered the defence evidence"
"before she could reach her final decision. Hence, the contention raised in the"
"second and third grounds of appeal by the Appellant have no merit."
"In the third ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the recovery made"
"under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has not been proved beyond"
"reasonable doubt."
"Following the arrest of the Appellant in this case, a knife was recovered based"
"upon his statement to the police and the same was identified by PW2 as the"
"knife that was used to kill the deceased."
"The  admissibility  of  the  recovery  evidence  under  Section  27(1)  of  the"
"Evidence  Ordinance  had  been  discussed  in  several  cases  decided  by  the"
"Superior Courts of our country."
