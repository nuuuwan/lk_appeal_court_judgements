"In  this  case,  PW1  had  vividly  explained  how  the  deceased  was  positioned"
"when  he  was  brutally  attacked.  When  PW1  looked  at  the  deceased  the"
"Appellant was stabbing the deceasedâ€™s neck."
"Considering  the  evidence  presented  against  the  Appellant,  I  conclude  that"
"the  prosecution  had  succeeded  in  adducing  highly  incriminating  evidence"
"against  the  Appellant  and  thereby  has  established  the  charge  beyond"
"reasonable doubt."
"As such, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which the findings"
"of the Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 20/03/2018 can be"
"interfered upon. Hence, I dismiss the Appeal."
"Appeal dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Kurunegala along with the original case record."
