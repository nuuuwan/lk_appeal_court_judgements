"n Nandasena v. The Republic  of Sri  Lanka (1994) 3 Sri LR at page 172"
"the Court held that;"
"“In  a  case  which  turns on circumstantial evidence  it  is essential  that"
"the  trial  judge  should  explain  clearly  to  the  jury  that  circumstantial"
"evidence, if it is to support a conviction, must be altogether inconsistent"
"with  the  accused's  innocence  and  explicable  solely  on  the  hypothesis"
"of his guilt”."
