"“
……..The danger may be greater with arbitrators who have no judicial training or"
"background, than with judges who are used to reaching entirely independent adjudicatory"
"decisions with the benefit of law clerks or other junior judicial assistants. However, the danger"
"exists for all tribunals. Best practice is therefore to avoid involving a tribunal secretary in"
"anything which could be characterised as expressing a view on the substance of that which"
"the tribunal is called upon to decide.”"
