"Samaranayake [1996] 2 SLR 268 at 272 expressed a similar view. Referring to Section 31 D"
"(6) of Industrial Disputes Act, as amended, His Lordship held,"
"“
There can be doubt that the legislative intention was to ensure that at the conclusion"
"o
f
 
the appellate proceedings, however lengthy, there would be a fund available to satisfy the"
"workman’s entitlements; and, by providing for interest, to ensure that the lapse of time and"
