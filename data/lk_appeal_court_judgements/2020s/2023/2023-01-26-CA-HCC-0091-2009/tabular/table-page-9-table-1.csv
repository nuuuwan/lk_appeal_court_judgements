"Page 16 of the appeal brief is as follows;",""
"","“… Now you would have understood the charges levelled against these two accused"
"","persons.  I  have  an  obligation  to  explain  the  term  common  intention  further.  For"
"","example, two people work in an office. These two people go to a market together."
"","They  buy  a  thing  there.  They  both  have  a  common  intention  of  buying  that  thing."
"","When one of them goes to buy that thing, a person sees someone else in front of him."
"","That person may already be angry or have a grudge against this person. He asks his"
"","friend, ""Since you are my friend you have to help me to assault and kill this person."
"","That is to say you have to help me not to let him run away when I am involved in doing,"
"","such  an  act.  So,  the  friend  agrees  and  both  kill  the  person  by  way  of  assaulting  or"
"doing, any other act of attack.”",""
"","“Now  the  law  says  that  there  is  a  common  intention  between  these  two  people.  I"

"intention is and what section 32 refers to.”",""
