"“There  is  one  further  principle  of  construction  that  in  my  judgment"
"supports  the  meaning  which  I  attribute  to  this  clause,  viz.  that  all  the"
"words used should, so far as possible, be given a meaning. Disputes as to"
"the  construction  of  the  contract,  or  as  to  matters  arising  under  the"
"contract, are covered by the opening words of a clause. So disputes as to"
"the matters arising in connection with the contract must be taken to refer"
"to disputes other than about questions of construction, or as to matters"
"arising  under  the  contract.  Asked  to  suggest  a  dispute  that  arose  in"
"connection with the contract which was neither a matter of construction"
"nor arose under the contract, counsel for Ashville was only able to suggest"
"a question whether the contract had been frustrated by some supervening"
"event. I  can  see  no  reason  why  the  words  should  be  limited  only  to"
"matters that arose after the making of the contract and should not"
"include matters which happened before the making of the contract,"
"provided that they are connected with the contract”. [Emphasis added"
"in this judgment]"
