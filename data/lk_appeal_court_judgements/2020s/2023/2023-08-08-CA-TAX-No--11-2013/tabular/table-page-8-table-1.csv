"If one takes, the “deduction of difference” means, Cost minus Depreciation,"
"(5) Excess of Proceeds over (3) [(1) – (2)] is Rs. 1,000,000/- - (Rs. 1,000,000/-"
"- Rs. 400,000/-) = Rs. 400,000/-         taxed as profit."
"(02) 
Example by the respondent:-"
"It is pertinent to observe, the example on calculation shown by the respondent"
"in his further Written Submissions, dated 15.03.2022."
"“When a full depreciation is allowed"
"If a full depreciation allowance is granted in terms of paragraph (a), then the"
"FULL amount of the proceeds of the sale of capital assets is liable for income"
"tax  as  if  it  were  a  business  income  (or  income  from  trade,  profession  or"
"vocation) in terms of section 03."
"When a partial depreciation is allowed"
"If only a partial allowance is granted for depreciation, in terms of paragraph"
"(b), income tax will have to be paid on “the excess of the proceeds” over the"
"“difference between the purchase price and the depreciation allowance”."
"Is this what, part two of section 25(3)(b) says,"
"“…the excess of the proceeds of such disposal over the difference between"
"the  cost  of  acquisition  or  the  cost  of  construction  of  such  capital  asset,"
"and the total allowance for depreciation granted in respect of such capital"
"asset, shall,…”"
"The respondent’s example continues,"
"“So for example, assume that I purchase a machine for Rs. 1,000,000/- and"
"sell  it  for  Rs.  5,000,000/-.  Let  us  say  my  depreciation  allowance  is  Rs."
"500,000/-.  Then  the  difference  between  the  purchase  price  [1,000,000/-]"
