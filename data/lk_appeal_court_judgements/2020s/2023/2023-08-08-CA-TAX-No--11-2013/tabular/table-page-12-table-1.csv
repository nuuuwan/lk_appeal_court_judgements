"(b) Rs. 600,000/- - (Rs. 1,000,000/- - Rs. 500,000/-) = Rs. 100,000/-"
"If  cost 
is  Rs.  1,000,000/-,  proceeds  are  Rs.  600,000/-  and  depreciation"
"allowance is Rs. 400,000/-."
"Then according to respondent’s example,"
"(c) Rs. 600,000/-     - Rs. 400,000  = Rs. 200,000/-"
"According to the formula Proceeds - (Cost – Depreciation) = Taxable Amount"
"(d) Rs. 600,000/- - (Rs. 1,000,000/- - Rs. 400,000/-) = Rs. 0/-"
"Hence, when Depreciation is low the Tax is also low. [Compare (b) and (d) above]"
"If Depreciation is more the Tax is also more."
"(04) 
What if the difference between Cost and Depreciation exceeds"
"proceeds?"
"It  could  be  assumed,  proceeds  Rs.  600,000/-  Cost  Rs.  1,000,000/-  and"
"Depreciation Rs. 200,000/-. Then it will be,"
"Rs. 600,000/- - (Rs. 1,000,000/- - Rs. 200,000/-) = Rs. 200,000/- minus"
"This situation is addressed by the first Proviso to section 25(3)(b) which says,"
"“Provided  that  where  such  difference  exceeds  the  proceeds  of  such"
"disposal, the excess shall be treated for the purpose of subsection (1),"
"as an expense incurred in the production of income:…”"
"This shows, that, in such a situation the formula should be,"
"(Rs. 1,000,000/- - Rs. 200,000/-) – Rs. 600,000/- = Rs. 200,000/- expenditure"
"(Difference)                    -  (Proceeds)            = (Expense Incurred)"
