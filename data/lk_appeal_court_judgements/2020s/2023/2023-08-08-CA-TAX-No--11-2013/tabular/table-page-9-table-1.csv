"Rs. 5,000,000/-               -      Rs. 500,000              =   4,500,000/-"
"(proceeds)           - (depreciation allowance) =    (sum liable for income tax)”."
"But, as per part two of section 25(3)(b), it is not Proceeds – Depreciation."
"There is a difference."
"It is Proceeds – (Cost – Depreciation) = Taxable Amount"
"In the above example of the respondent, no difference in the answer is caused"
"because  depreciation  is  Rs.  500,000/-  and  Cost  being  Rs.  1,000,000/-,  the"
"difference is also Rs. 500,000/-."
"But this is not true in every case."
"If in the above example of the respondent, the Cost is Rs. 1,000,000/-, Proceeds"
"Rs.  5,000,000/-  and  Depreciation  is  Rs.  600,000/-,  what  will  be  the  taxable"
"amount?"
"As per section 25(3)(b) it should be,"
"Rs. 5,000,000/-     -  (Rs. 1,000,000/-  - Rs. 600,000/-)   = Rs. 4,600,000/-."
"When the Depreciation was Rs. 500,000/- [in the example of the respondent] the"
"taxable amount was Rs. 4,500,000/-."
"This will make the situation in section 25(3)(b) not similar to what the common"
"sense  in  Investopedia  said,  “The  larger  the  depreciation  expense,  the  lower"
"the taxable income, and the lower a company's tax bill…”"
"Take  another  example  where 
the  Cost 
is  Rs.  1,000,000/-,  Proceeds  Rs."
"5,000,000/- and Depreciation Rs. 800,000/-. The taxable amount will be,"
"Rs. 5,000,000/-    - (Rs. 1,000,000/- - Rs. 800,000/-)   = 4,800,000/-"
"Now what if Depreciation is equal to the Cost?"
