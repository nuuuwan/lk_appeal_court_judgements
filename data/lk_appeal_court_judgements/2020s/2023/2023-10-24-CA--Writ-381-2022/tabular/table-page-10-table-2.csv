"make statements and adduce evidence on his own behalf. But this opportunity given to an officer or"
"soldier will not change the character of the Court of Inquiry into a disciplinary inquiry.‚Äù"
"In the light of the above, I am of the view that the warnings given to the Petitioner based"
"on decisions or findings of a Court of Inquiry on said occasions cannot be considered based"
"on the circumstances of this case, as disciplinary breaches and therefore the same should"
"not stand in the way of considering the grant of the relevant promotions to the Petitioner."
"Alleged Disciplinary Breach No. 6 - Adverse Confidential Report - R9"
"An adverse confidential report was submitted by the Commander of Security Headquarters"
"(Wanni) whereby the Petitioner was strictly warned in respect of his irresponsible conduct,"
"bad attitude towards responsibilities he was entrusted with, misusing of military vehicles,"
"violation of instructions and misbehaviour as the Staff Officer Administration. As per the"
"said adverse report R9 dated 13.02.2014 the Petitioner has been placed on report for one"
"year  with  effect  from  13.02.2013  in  which  any  careless  mistake  or  any  repetition  of  a"
"similar act would be dealt severely. It has also been stated that during the said period the"
"Petitioner  will  not  be  considered  for  any  confirmation  of  rank,  recommendation  of"
"promotions or any other privileges. It is observed that the period of one year during which"
"the  Petitioner  was  placed  on  the  report  as  per  the  R9  has  lapsed.  Therefore,  the  said"
"adverse confidential report should not stand as a barrier in considering the Petitioner for"
"the impugned confirmation or promotion now."
"The Petitioner contends that the Respondents have failed to exercise due discretion when"
"the  Respondents  considered  the  grant  of  the  impugned  promotion  to  the  Petitioner  as"
"they have failed to take into account the applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, the"
"Petitioner claims that it was unreasonable for the Respondents to deny the Petitioner of"
"his promotion. The Petitioner is relying on the judgement of  Colonel U.R. Abeyratne Vs."
