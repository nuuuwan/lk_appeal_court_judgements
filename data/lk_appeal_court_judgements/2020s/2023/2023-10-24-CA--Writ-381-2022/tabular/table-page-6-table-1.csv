"Therefore, in the light of the above decisions and circumstances of this case Court shall not"
"interfere with the findings of the Army Promotion Board unless this Court is satisfied that"
"the discretion vested with such Board and the Commander of the Army has been exercised"
"unreasonably and/or wrongfully and /or that there has not been a proper consideration of"
"the materials relating the Petitioner."
"Alleged Disciplinary Breach No. 01- Affair with a female soldier- P11/R4"
"It is stated that the Petitioner was having an inappropriate affair with a female soldier while"
"he was serving at Valaichchena Camp in 2001.  Based on such an allegation there had been"
"a summary trial against the Petitioner and finally, the Petitioner had been discharged from"
"all  the  charges  pertaining  to  the  charges  as  contained  in  P11/R4  due  to  insufficient"
"evidence.  As  the  Petitioner  was  discharged  from  the  charges  therein  it  would  not  be"
"reasonable to hold such incident against the Petitioner after 20 years from the incident."
"However, the Respondents contend that although the Petitioner was discharged from the"
"said charges as contained in P11/R4, he was subjected to a probation period of one year"
"from 23.04.2005 for having an alleged unnecessary friendship with a female soldier on the"
"same  proceedings.  Upon  perusal  of  the  documents  P11/R4, 
it  appears  that  such  a"
"probation  period  had  been  imposed  on  the  Petitioner  without  any  charge  sheet  being"
"issued, without giving a fair hearing to the Petitioner or without pursuant to a summary"
"trial. Such period of probation, in any event, lapsed on 22.04.2006. It is also observed that"
"despite such an alleged breach of the disciplinary code, the Petitioner was confirmed in"
"the rank of Major on 30.06.2007 and in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 30.12.2010. It is"
"observed  that 
irrespective  of 
imposing  a  such  probation  period  on  the  Petitioner,"
"document  P11  specifically  provides  that  the  Petitioner  has  been  discharged  from  the"
"charges 
levelled  against  him  as  there  had  been  no  evidence  to  prove  such  charges."
"Therefore, in view of P11, the Petitioner has not committed any breach of discipline."
