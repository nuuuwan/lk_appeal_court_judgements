"In  such  instances,  Court  may  be  more  inclined  to  assess  such  decisions  on  the"
"grounds of rationality  or proportionately, Mumbai courts can still intervene even"
"where the decision is within the purported “ four corners of the law but do not satisfy"
"the threshold of reasonableness due to a failure to consider relevant material."
"If  a  decision  has  been 
influenced  by  considerations  which  either  expressly  or"
"implicitly  cannot 
lawfully  be  taken 
into  account,  a  Court  may  hold  that  such"
"discretionary power has not been exercised validly”"
"When this Court considers all the facts mentioned above and the circumstances involved"
"in this case, it is clear that no proper consideration has been given to the relevant materials"
"by the Army Advisory Boards when said Boards arrived at the relevant recommendations."
"Finally,  I  need  to  draw  attention  to  the  passage  in  Colonel  U.R.  Abeyratne  case  [Supra]"
"where it is opined as follows:"
"“it is, therefore, the view of this Court that a decision reached in such circumstances is not only a"
"decision which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have"
"decided to adopt but is also a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted"
"moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided"
"could 
have 
arrived 
at.”However, 
the  Army 
Promotion  Board 
assembled 
on"
"29.09.2020,27.01.2021  and  10.05.2021  has  decided  (R16,  R17  and  R18)  not  to"
"recommend  the  Petitioner  to  be  promoted  to  the  rank  of  Colonel  following  the"
"recommendations  of  the  respective  Army  Advisory  Board.  It  is  evident  from  the"
"said  decisions  marked  R16,  R17  and  R18  of  the Army  Promotion  Board  that  the"
"Army 
Promotion 
Board 
has 
based 
its 
decision 
on 
the 
said 
erroneous"
"recommendations of the respective Army Advisory Boards that the service record"
"of  the  Petitioner  was  tainted  with  six  disciplinary  breaches.  The  Redress  of"
"Grievance  (ROG)  submitted  by  the  Petitioner  by  P22  to  clear  the  erroneous"
"references made by the Army Advisory Board has also been rejected on the very"
"same basis and the recommendation of the Advisory Board has been approved by"
"the Commander of the Army by letter P30."
"Thereafter  the  Petitioner  has  been 
informed  that  the  Commander  of  the  Army  has"
"recommended to retire the Petitioner from Sri Lanka Army by the letters P39 and P41. As"
"the Petitioner was not recommended for his next promotion and he has been permitted"
"to serve the maximum permissible period in his present rank of Lieutenant Colonel, the"
"Commander  of  the  Army  has  recommended  sending  the  Petitioner  on  retirement.  The"
"above  decisions  reflected 
in  P39  and  P41  are  solely  based  on 
illegal  and 
irrational"
"recommendations  made  by  the  Army  Advisory  Boards  which  cannot  stand 
in 
law."
"Therefore, the said decisions reflected in the P30, P39 and P41 are liable to be quashed."
"This  Court  considered  the  decision-making  process  involved  in  the  instant  application."
"Therefore, this Court is not inclined to make any order to promote the Petitioner to the"
"rank  of  Colonel.  It  is  up  to  the  Respondents  to  consider  the  promotion  based  on  the"
"relevant  material  pertaining  to  the  Petitioner  according  to  the 
laws  and  regulations"
