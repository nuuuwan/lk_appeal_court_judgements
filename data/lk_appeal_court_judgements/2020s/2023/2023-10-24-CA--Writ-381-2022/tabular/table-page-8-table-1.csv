"punished by a Court of Inquiry, or based on an Order made upon the report of the Court"
"of Inquiry as such Court of Inquiry is only a fact-finding forum."
"Nevertheless, by the time the said decision R7/P13 was issued, the Petitioner was serving"
"as the Administrative Officer of the said unit holding the rank of Major and the said warning"
"against the Petitioner had been issued without issuing a charge sheet. As per Clause 8 of"
"the P19 when an officer is to be warned without issuing a charge sheet based upon a Court"
"of Inquiry report it must be specifically stated. Nevertheless, nowhere in the document"
"R7/P13  it  is  stated  as  such.  As  per  Clause  5  of  the  Instructions  on  the  Imposition  of"
"Punishments to Army Officers marked P19, a warning issued without issuing a charge sheet"
"to  an  officer  in  the  rank  of  Major  or  below  would  not  be  considered  as  a  punishment."
"Therefore,  based  on  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  warning"
"reflected  in  the  R7/P13  which  has  been  issued  pursuant  to  the Court  of  Inquiry  Report"
"cannot be considered as a disciplinary breach that would stand in the way of granting the"
"relevant promotion to the Petitioner."

"in  R8,  it  has  been  directed  to  produce  the  Petitioner  before  the  Commander  of  the"
"regiment and to be strictly warned."
"There was no summary trial or Court Marshal held against the Petitioner in respect of such"
"allegations and no charge sheet had been issued against the Petitioner. As per Clause 8 of"
"the P19 when an officer is to be warned without raising a charge sheet based upon a Court"
"of Inquiry report it must be specifically stated. Nowhere in R8, it has been mentioned as"
"such."
"In both the above instances (Alleged disciplinary breach No. 4 and 5), the Petitioner had"
"been warned based on the findings of the Courts of Inquiry. The Petitioner submits that an"
"officer in the Sri Lanka Army cannot be punished by a Court of Inquiry or based upon a"
"report of a Court of Inquiry without affording a Summary Trial or Court Martial as the Court"
"of  Inquiry  is  only  a  fact-finding  mission  having  no  authority  to  convict  and  sentence  an"
"officer."
"It  is  observed  that  there  is  a  distinction  between  a  Court  of  Inquiry  and  a  Summary"
"Trial/Court  Marshal.  The  Court  of  Inquiry  is  a  fact-finding  inquiry  and  it  is  defined  in"
