"between the boundary of the road and the reserve forest has been taken"
"with legal authority after following the correct legal procedure."
"I
t  is  also  vital  to  be  noted  that  the  constitution  in  Chapter  VI  under"
"“Directive Principles of State Policy and fundamental Duties” states that"
"the State shall protect, preserve and improve the environment for the"
"benefit  of  the  community  (Article  27(14))  and  Article  28  refers  to  the"
"fundamental duty upon every person to protect nature and conserve its"
"riches  as  it  was  held  in  Watte  Gedara  Wijebanda  v.  Conservator"
"General of Forests and Others – (2009) 1 Sri. L.R 337."
"I
n  addition,  the  petitioner  cannot  complain  that  the  fence  would  be"
"erected to harass her due to the political affiliations of the son of the"
"petitioner especially because of the reason that it was decided to erect"
"the  fence  15  feet  from  the  edge  of  the  road  although  it  was  decided"
"initially to allocate 15 feet from the center of the road to either side of"
"the road when developing the road. According to the initial decision, the"
"1st respondent could erect the fence 15 feet from the center of the road"
"without excluding 15 feet from the edge of the road towards the forest."
"Erecting the fence 15 feet from the edge of the road would result in the"
"fence being erected further away from the petitioner’s land."
"N
ow,  the  only  issue  that  remains  to  be  considered  is  whether  the"
"petitioner  has  a  right  to  obtain  a  writ  to  stop  erecting  a  fence  on  the"
"boundary of the road and forest reserve for the reason of her right of"
"view being obstructed."
"I
n the absence of local decisions, I would like to consider the decisions"
"of two foreign cases in which the right of view has been recognized as a"
"legal right. Those two cases show the limited circumstances where the"
"right of view can be granted."
