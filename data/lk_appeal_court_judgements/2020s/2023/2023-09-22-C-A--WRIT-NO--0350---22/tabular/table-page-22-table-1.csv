"","C.A. WRIT  No. 350 - 22"
"48)","In 
the  said  circumstances, 
it 
is  obvious  by  P36(a),  P36(b)  and  P8"
"","documents  that  the  employees  of  the  category  of  the  Petitioners’  Grade"
"","are eligible to face an interview and then the qualifying candidates will be"
"","sent for 2 years training programme."
"IV.","If  so,  are  the  Petitioners  entitled  for  Writ  of  Certiorari  and  Writ  of"
"","Mandamus  prayed 
for 
in  the  prayer  of  the  petition  dated  27th"
"","September 2022 against the Respondents?"
"49)","In  the  instant  application  the  Petitioners  have  raised  their  arguments"
"","based  on  the  documents  marked  as  P35,  P36(a),  P36(b)  and  P8.    The"
"","President’s Counsel Shamil Perera brought to the notice of the Court that"
"","the category on which the Petitioners are eligible is different to the Field"
"","Technical  Service  category  employees,  who  are  eligible  to  face  the  same"
"","interview."
"50)","The position taken by the Respondents is that the eligible candidates had"
"","been  interviewed  and  recruited  as  per  the  marking  scheme  marked  and"
"","produced as R1."
"51)","Further, 
the  Counsel 
for 
the  Respondents  had 
reiterated 
that 
the"
"","technical  knowledge  possessed  by 
the  eligible  candidates  had  been"
"","considered as per P35 document."
"52)","However,  the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  challenged  the  said  argument"
"","and  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  Court  that  P35  document  promotion"
"","scheme under 5.1 states that only Field Technical Service employees are"
"","eligible 
to 
face 
the 
said 
interview 
and 
should  possess 
technical"
"","experience."
"53)","None  of  the  Board  Circulars  contain  that  the  Billman  category  should"
"","possess  technical  knowledge.    It  is  obvious  that  the  Billman  category"
"","employees  will  not  have  the  opportunity  of  gaining  technical  experience"
"","during their career."
