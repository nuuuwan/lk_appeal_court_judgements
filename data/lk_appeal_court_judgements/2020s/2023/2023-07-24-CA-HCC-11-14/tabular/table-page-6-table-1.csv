"The learned High Court judge has misdirected himself by shifting the burden to the"
"Accused."
"The burden of proof is always on the prosecution, this proposition was expressed in"
"Pantis v. The Attorney General 1998 2 SLR 148, his Lordship Wijeyaratne J held:"
"“The  burden  of  proof  is  always  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  all  ingredients  of  the"
"charge beyond reasonable doubt and there is no burden in our law for the accused to give"
"any explanation (unless in certain cases where specific provision is made by law). In my"
"view it is sufficient if the accused gives an explanation which satisfies the court or at least"
"is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.”"
"It should be kept in mind that the trial Judge was a trained judge who would have"
"been aware of the fact that the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove a"
"case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore if a reasonable doubt was created in his mind,"
"no doubt he would have given the benefit of that doubt to the accused and acquitted him"
"on the charges.”"
"In the instant case, the Accused has stated that he has handed the document over"
"to  PW3,  and  also  there  is  evidence  to  show  that  the  said  document  had  a  date  stamp,"
"however, this factor was not considered by the learned High Court Judge."
"We are mindful that there is no need for the Accused to prove his innocence. For"
"the Accused to offer his evidence, only when a prima facie case has been made out by the"
"prosecution. This was expressed by Abbott, J. in Rex v. Burdett 1820 4 B & Ald 95, 120:"
"“No person is to be required to explain or contradict until enough has been proved"
"to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or"
"contradiction; but when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as"
"to admit of explanation or contradiction can human reason do otherwise than adopt the"
"conclusion to which proof tends."""
"The above dictum was followed by His Lordship P.R.P.Perera,J  in the case"
"of Baddewithana v. The Attorney General 1990 1 SLR 275."
