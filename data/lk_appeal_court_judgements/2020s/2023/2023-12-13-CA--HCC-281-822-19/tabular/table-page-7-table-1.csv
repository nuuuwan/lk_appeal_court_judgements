"Sadath v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 110/15, (SC Minutes 14.12.2020), held:"
"“Lord Wilberforce went on to state that, on such matters as above, though not"
"exhaustively stated, it must be decided whether in addition to physical control, he has or"
"ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess or knowledge that he does possess,"
"what is in fact a prohibited substance. The above reasoning in my view is a rational"
"guideline that should be adopted in deciding as to whether the Accused had the knowledge"
"(the requisite mens rea) that what he possessed is a prohibited substance, even though he"
"may not have known the precise nature of the substance.” Further, he held that: “It would"
"not be unreasonable to presume that it was well within his knowledge that people do"
"smuggle contraband into the country under various guises, given the social standing of"
"the Accused.”"
