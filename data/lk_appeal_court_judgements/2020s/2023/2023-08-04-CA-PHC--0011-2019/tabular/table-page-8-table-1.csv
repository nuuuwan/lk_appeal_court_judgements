"The main contention of the Counsel for the Appellants is that both the"
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  and  the  Learned  Magistrate  had  failed  to"
"evaluate the evidence led at the inquiry."
"The  relevant  portions  of  the  MC  proceedings  and  the  order  of  the"
"Learned Magistrate re-produced above clearly indicate that the Learned"
"Magistrate had failed to evaluate the evidence given by the Appellants."

"hires  vehicles.  The  1st-Appellant  he  a  64  years  old  person  when  the"
"incident  had  happened.  The  trailer  he  gave  it  on  hire  to  2nd-Appellant"
"was  used  for  his  Tractor.  As  his  Tractor  was  broken  down,  he  took"
"steps  to  hire  it  for  a  charge.  No  previous  incident  or  pending  cases"
"reported."
