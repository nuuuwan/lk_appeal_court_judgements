"Upon perusal of the evidence, we see that the entire incident of rape by the appellant had"
"taken place on a single bed while the infant child had been sleeping. The victim also had"
"said at one point that the appellant had thrown the child when the child cried once, and if"
"that  is  so,  the  child  should  have  sustained  injuries  and  the  child  would  be  yelling  and"
"strangely the victim  had not said so in her evidence. Furthermore, it is very hard to believe"
"that this type of an act can take  place on a single bed with a child sleeping on the side"
"unless there was no resistance from either party. In the instant matter the victim says that"
"she resisted the appellant touching her and kissing her on the lips which means that there"
"would have been some type of movement on the bed to which a child would always react"
"especially when it is the mother who happens to be on the bed."
"Therefore,  we  too  see  that  the  story  narrated  by  the  victim  happens  to  be  highly"
"improbable and we also note that although the victim has spoken to about two persons by"
"the name the indictment speaks of a person unknown to the prosecution along with the"
"appellant committed the act which also shows that the prosecution was not very sure of"
"the story narrated by the victim."
"Mr. Justice Mackeena in the article  “ discretion “ in the Irish Jurist Vol 1X 1 at 10 had said"
"as follows,"
"“When  I  have  done  best  to  separate  the  truth  from  the  false  by  these  more  or  less"
"objective tests, I say which story seems to be truer, .I decide the case as the law requires"
"in favor of the defendant”."
"The Indian Supreme Court has held in the case of State of Utra Pradesh vs Anthony AIR"
"1985 SC 48 Supra para 10 that “while appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach"
"must be whether the evidence ….read as a whole appears to have a wring of truth. Once"
"that  impression  is  formed  it  is  undoubtedly  necessary  for  the  Court  to  scrutinize  the"
"evidence more particularly in keeping with the deficiencies and infirmities……”"
"Hence in the instant matter we find the narration of facts by the victim seems to be highly"
"improbable  and  it  only  indicates  an  act  which  had  taken  place  with  the  consent  of  the"
"victim and not the other way about."
