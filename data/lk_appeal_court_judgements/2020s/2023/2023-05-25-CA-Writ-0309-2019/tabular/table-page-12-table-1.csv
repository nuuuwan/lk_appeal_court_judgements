"circumstances, Petitioner’s application has become futile, a writ of mandamus"
"will also not be available against the Respondent9."
"Is the Petitioner’s application based on a contract?"
"The Petitioner has sought to quash the letter of the Secretary to the Ministry"
"of Education and Cultural Affairs (‘P 20’) issued under the directions of the"
"4th Respondent Minister. As I have already stated above in this order, by the"
"said  letter,  the  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  has  informed  the  NFC  that  the"
"agreements entered between the NFC and the private circuits are null and void"
"and to inform the parties not to engage in the distribution of films in the future."
"However, it is an admitted fact that the Petitioners have already instituted an"
"action in the District Court bearing No. DSP 99/2018 (‘P 17(i)’) seeking relief"
"regarding the agreement between the NFC and the private circuits. According"
"to  ‘P  17(i)’  the  reliefs  sought  inter-alia  are  that  the  agreements  are  valid,"
"binding,  operative,  and  in  force.  Further,  a  declaration  that  the  agreements"
"cannot be unilaterally terminated and/or unilaterally declared null and void."
"Hence,  it  appears  that  the  Petitioners  have  already  sought  relief  from  the"
"District Court with respect to the same agreements, the matter in issue in the"
"instant case.  Accordingly, the Petitioners themselves have acknowledged that"
"the relationship between the NFC and the private circuits is contractual and"
"resorted to the alternative remedy available."
"In the case of Jayaweera v. Wijeratne10 His Lordship G.P.S. de Silva J., (as"
"His Lordship then was) observed, ‘Where the relationship between the parties"
"is  a  purely  contractual  one  of  a  commercial  nature  neither  certiorari  nor"
"mandamus will lie to remedy grievances arising from an alleged breach of"
"contract or failure to observe the principles of natural justice even if one of"
"the parties is a public authority.’"
"Further, it was observed that ‘the fact that the parties are amenable to writ"
"jurisdiction would not change the character of the decision if the decision is"
"made in exercise of the power springs from contract’."
