"In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte11 it was held that ‘The"
"Writ will not issue for private purposes, that is to say for the enforcement of a"
"mere private duty stemming from a contract or otherwise. Contractual duties"
"are enforceable by ordinary contractual remedies such as damages, specific"
"performance, or injunction. They are not enforceable by Mandamus which is"
"confined to public duties and is not granted where there are other adequate"
"remedies."
"Further,  in  Gawarammana  v.  The  Tea  Research  Board12  it  was  held  that"
"‘powers derived from contract are matter of private law. The fact that one of"
"the  parties  to  the  contract  is  s  public  authority  is  not  relevant  since  the"
"decision sought to be quashed by way of certiorari itself was not made in the"
"exercise of any statutory power’."
"It  was  observed  in  the  case  of  De  Silva  v.  Sri  Lanka  Telecom13,  ‘Neither"
"Certiorari nor Mandamus will lie to remedy the grievances arising from an"
"alleged breach of contract’."
"It is trite law that prerogative writs are discretionary remedies, and therefore,"
"not entitled to invoke when there is an alternative remedy available."
"In Ishak v. Laxman Perera, Director General of Customs and others14 it was"
"held  that,  ‘where  there  is  an  alternative  procedure  which  will  provide  the"
"applicant  with  a  satisfactory  remedy  the  Courts  will  usually  insist  on  an"
"applicant exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial review’."
"‘the alternative procedure to be exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review"
"is in accord with judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy"
"of last resort.’"
"I am mindful that there had been instances where our Courts have provided"
"relief  through  writs  where  the  contractual  or  commercial  character  of  the"
"transaction is  overshadowed  by an administrative  malady  that  needs  to  be"
"remedied15. But this is not such a case. The impugned decision, in this case,"
