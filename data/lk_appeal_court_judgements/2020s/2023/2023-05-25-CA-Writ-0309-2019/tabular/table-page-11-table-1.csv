"The  other  argument of  the  Petitioner is that  even  if  the  concurrence of  the"
"Attorney  General  is  obtained  the  agreement  entered  into  by  the  NFC  with"
"private circuits falls within the phrase ‘actions already taken in terms of the"
"said Circular’ in the Cabinet decision. The Cabinet decision ‘1 R 1’ states that"
"the said decision should be without prejudice to the actions already taken in"
"terms of the Circular. Obviously, as far as the Petitioners are concerned, this"
"should be any action already taken under the agreement entered pursuant to"
"Circular ‘P 5’. In my view, Petitioners should not be allowed to interpret the"
"agreement itself as an action under Circular ‘P 5’, concerning the Petitioners."

"Yet, I am mindful that an application for writ should not be dismissed merely"
"because it has become futile pending the determination of the application8."
"However,  the  facts  of  the  present  case  are  quite  different  from  the  cases"
"referred to in the preceding paragraph, and in my view, the facts of this case"
"do not warrant the continuation of this application. This is not an appropriate"
"case to convey a message to other public officers."
"The  Petitioner  has  also  sought  a  writ  of  mandamus  directing  the  1st  to  4th"
"Respondents  to  duly  consider  and  evaluate  in  full  representations  by  the"
"Petitioners  and  other  concerned  parties  in  connection  with  any  proposed"
"regulation criteria or standards relating to the importation and/or distribution"
