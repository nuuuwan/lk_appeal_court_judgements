"However, in the instant case, the Secretary had not taken any steps to apply to Court to"
"rectify the situation and set the record straight."
"T
he  Petitioner  Pradeshiya  Sabha  is  also  quiet  on  whether  the  Secretary  had"
"instructed  the  Work  Superintendent  to  enter  the  settlement.  Instead,  in  its  written"
"submissions, it conveniently states that there is “no evidence to show that the Secretary’s"
"power has been delegated” to the Work Superintendent, instead of a genuine attempt to"
"submit  evidence  of  the  Secretary  himself,  such  as  by  an  affidavit  to  substantiate  its"
"contention."
"T
he Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha then takes up the position that the Secretary “in"
"any event cannot delegate any power to any other person” because the Secretary himself"
"is a statutory delegatee."
"W
e cannot agree with that argument because Section 9(3) confers on the Secretary"
"the powers of the Pradeshiya Sabha in the interim period between the end of the members’"
"term of office and the election of new members. As alluded to above, this is envisaged to"
"ensure the continuity of the functions of the Pradeshiya Sabha, which would otherwise be"
"at a  standstill.  In  the  present  case,  the  new members  weren’t in  office  for  three  years."
"These powers that the Secretary exercised by virtue of Section 9(3) will then include the"
"power  of  the  chairman  to  delegate  as  well.  The  Chairman’s  powers  to  delegate  are"
"provided in Section 8. Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 8 provide:"
"(2)The Chairman may by order in writing delegate to the Vice-Chairman or Secretary or any other"
"officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha any of the powers, duties or functions conferred or imposed upon"
"or vested in the Chairman by this Act or any other written law."
"(3)The  exercise,  discharge  or  performance  by  the  Vice  Chairman  or  the  Secretary  or  any  other"
"officer  of  the  Pradeshiya  Sabha  of  any  power,  duty or  function  delegated to him  by  order  of  the"
"Chairman,  shall  be  subject  to  such  conditions  and  restrictions  and  limited  to  such  purpose  or"
"purposes as may be specified in the order: and any such delegation on may at any time be varied"
"or cancelled by order of the Chairman."
"Therefore, in terms of the statute, the Secretary becomes the statutory repository"
"of the powers of the Pradeshiya Sabha, whose members are not in office due to their terms"
"of office coming to an end. This is until new members assume office. The Secretary can"
