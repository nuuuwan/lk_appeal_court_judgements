"Therefore, we do not agree with the contention of the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha"
"that the Secretary should have been substituted or added as a party in the original action"
"once the term of office of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha expired. Since that is not"
"a “cessation of legal existence”."
"T
he next issue, the crux of the present application, is to see whether the terms of"
"the settlement are binding on the Pradeshiya Sabha."
"Section 9(2) provides that the Secretary is the Chief Administrative Officer of the"
"Pradeshiya Sabha. Section 9(3) reads:"
"Where a Pradeshiya Sabha is unable to discharge its functions by reason of the Chairman"
"and  Vice-Chairman  ceasing  to  hold  office,  the  Secretary  shall,  during  any  period  that  elapses"
"between the occurrence of the vacancies in respect of those offices and the filling of those vacancies"
"in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Local  Authorities  Elections  Ordinance,  have,  exercise"
"perform and discharge all the rights, privilege, powers, duties and functions vested in or conferred"
"or imposed on, the Pradeshiya Sabha, the Chairman or Vice-Chairman by this Act or by any other"
"written law. [emphasis added]"
"T
his  subsection  provides  for  the  continuation  of  the  administration  and  the"
"functions of the Pradeshiya Sabha, which would otherwise come to a grinding halt and"
"thereby cause hardship and inconvenience to its service recipients and beneficiaries. The"
"Secretary  becomes  the  statutory  repository  of  all  the  “rights,  privileges,  powers,  duties"
"and functions” of that of the Pradeshiya Sabha."
"O
n a perusal of the record, it appears that the Secretary, acting as the statutory"
"repository had entered that settlement. Although the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha  has"
"taken  steps  to  sanction  the  Work  Superintendent  who  entered  into  the  settlement,  by"
"suspending his services, it did not act with the same vigour against the Secretary. This is"
"perhaps because it knew that the Secretary was statutorily vested with the power to enter"
"such  a  settlement,  and  therefore  sought  to  sanction  the  Work  Superintendent  as  the"
"‘sacrificial lamb’. In its Petition itself, we are told that the Secretary had written to the"
"Project  Engineer  of  the  Kalutara  District  trying  to  divert  the  water  down  the  road"
"elsewhere (“P21”)."
"If the settlement had been entered into without the knowledge of and not on the"
"Secretary's  instructions,  then  the  settlement's  validity  could  be  called  into  question."
