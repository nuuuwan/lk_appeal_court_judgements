"2.  Reached the required salary step at the time he applied for the concessions"
"prior to the implementation of PAC 20/2001."
"Nevertheless, in the said FR matter though the petitioner reached the age of 45"
"years prior to the implementation date of PAC 20/2001, he had not reached the"
"required salary step and thereby was denied access to the said exemption."
"The learned DSG during the argument stage of the instant case enunciated and"
"cited  the  No:  432/2003 FR  case  (Supra)  and  the  PAC  20/2001  while  agreeing"
"that it is essential that the petitioner must fulfill both requirements stated in the"
"PAC  20/2001  prior  to  01/10/2001.  However,  it  appears  that  the learned  DSG"
"has not accurately examined P12 when claiming to the state the order of the AAT"
"is correct which states that the petitioner only reaches the E.B. salary scale on"
"26/02/2003."
"Yet, in the instant case it is evident the petitioner has fulfilled both requirements"
"of completing the age of 45 years and reaching the Efficiency Bar salary step prior"
"to  01/10/2001  which  is  the  date  of  implementation  the  PAC  20/2001  and  is"
"thereby eligible for the said exemption from the Efficiency Bar Examination."
"As  such,  the  impugned  order  by  the  AAT  delivered  on  08/02/2018  could  be"
"deemed  as  prima  facie  erroneous  as  it  states,  “Although  the  appellant  had"
"completed  45  years  of  age  before  01/10/2001,  he  would  be  reaching  the  E.B."
"salary point only on 26/02/2003 that was a later date than the effective date of"
"P.A.  Circular  No.  20/2001  of  12/09/2001…….”.(emphasis  added)    Thus,  the"
"counsel for the petitioner argued that the AAT order is error on the face of record,"
"as the date on which the petitioner reaches the required salary step is identified"
"erroneously  as  26/02/2003  when  he  has  already  reached  the  salary  scale"
"requirement (proved  by  P12) prior to the implementation date (01/10/2001) of"
"the PAC 20/2001."
"For  an  order  to  be  quashed  for  error,  that  error  must  appear  upon  its  face."
"Accordingly, there has arisen a deal of confusion as a record, though consistent"
"in its parts with no error appearing may, on comparison with some extraneous"
