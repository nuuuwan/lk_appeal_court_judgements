"certiorari  should  be  available  to  correct  errors  of  law  committed  by  merely"
"administrative bodies, and not be restricted to those which are exercising judicial"
"or quasi-judicial functions."
"After considering the above findings, this Court has determined that the AAT's"
"order is erroneous and constitutes an error on the face of the record due to its"
"failure to consider relevant documents properly. The petitioner has fulfilled the"
"requirements for exemption from the Efficiency Bar Examination and therefore"
"has a legitimate expectation of eligibility. Accordingly, this Court rules that the"
"petitioner  is  entitled  to  be  promoted  to  Class  II  of  the  SLPS  effective  from"
"01/09/2009, having completed 10 years of service and receiving due concessions"
"accordingly. Hence, a Writ of Certiorari is issued to quash the AAT's order dated"
"08/02/2018. Further, the petitioner is entitled to receive other benefits that come"
"with the promotion to the higher grade, with effect from September 1, 2009."
