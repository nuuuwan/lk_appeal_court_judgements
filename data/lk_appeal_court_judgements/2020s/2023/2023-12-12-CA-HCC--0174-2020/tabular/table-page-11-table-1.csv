"In  this  case,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  the  evidence"
"presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He has properly analyzed"
"the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced"
"by  the  Appellant  fails  to  create  a  doubt  over  the  prosecution  case,  the"
"conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be"
"faulted."
"As  discussed  under  the  appeal  grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant,  the"
"prosecution  had  adduced  strong  and  incriminating  evidence  against  the"
"Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all the"
"evidence presented by all the parties and has come to a correct finding that"
"the  Appellant  was  guilty  of  committing  attempted  murder  of  PW1  and"
"committing the murder of the deceased in this case. Therefore, I affirm the"
"conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High"
"Court of Galle along with the original case record."
