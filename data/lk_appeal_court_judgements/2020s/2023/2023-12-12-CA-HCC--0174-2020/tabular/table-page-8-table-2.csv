"In Daradala Ganage Chandralatha Jayawardena alias Shantha v AG CA"
"85/2013 decided on 25.05.2018 the Court held that:"
"“Time and again courts have discussed the acceptance of evidence of"
"children of tender ages. Our judges are not there to test the memory of"
"the  witness,  they  are  expected  to  find  the  actual  fact  and  the  truth."
"Witnesses are human beings; they are not memory machines nor robots"
"to repeat the incident as it was. Further the natural behaviour of human"
"beings is to forged incidents, especially sad memories. No one wants to"
"re-visit painful moments and keep detailed memories with them”."
