"This witness was only 15 years of age, all alone at home when the incident"
"had  taken  place.  Further,  he  had  given  evidence  in  the  High  Court  after"
"about 8 years of the incident. It is obvious that one cannot expect to give a"
"perfect account of the incident considering the traumatic experience he has"
"faced. In this case, PW2 is a child witness and he cannot be expected to give"
"evidence regarding the incident in detail."
