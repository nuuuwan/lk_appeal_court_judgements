"When this matter was mentioned on 08-08-2023,
the learned Counsel
for
the"
"Respondents raised
preliminary legal objections as to the maintainability of this"
"Application on the basis that;"
"1. The impugned decision made by the Land Reform Commission (LRC)"
"dated
26-02-2013
had
already
been
determined
by
this
Court
in"
"Applications No. Writ/270/13, 271/13 and 272/13."
"2. The impugned decision made by the Land Reform Commission (LRC)"
"dated 26-02-2013 that
is being challenged by the Petitioners in the instant"
"Application is not
in force. A fresh decision made by the LRC dated"
"06-04-2023 is being challenged by the Petitioners before this Court
in"
"Application No. Writ/263/23.
In this context,
the instant Application is"
"futile."
"The LRC,
on
26-02-2013,
decided
to
transfer
the
land
in
dispute
to
one"
"Jayasundara Mudiyanselage Migara (14th Respondent) or to a suitable 3rd party"
"(paragraph 43 of the Petition). Being aggrieved by that decision, the Petitioners"
"invoked the Writ
jurisdiction of
this Court
in Applications No. Writ/270/13,"
"Writ/271/13 and Writ/272/13,
seeking Mandates
inter-alia in the nature of a"
"Writ of Mandamus prohibiting the LRC from transferring the subject matter to a"
"3rd party and a Writ of Mandamus compelling the transfer of the subject matter"
"to the Petitioners. The said Applications were dismissed by the Court of Appeal"
"on
15-10-2019. Being
aggrieved
by
that
Judgment,
the
Petitioners
sought"
"Special Leave to Appeal
from the Supreme Court, whereas the Supreme Court"
"refused to grant leave to appeal (SC-SLA. No. 415/2019)."
"Thereafter,
the
14th Respondent,
in Application
bearing No. Writ/191/2021"
"invoked
the Writ
Jurisdiction
of
this Court
seeking
inter-alia,
a Writ
of"
"Mandamus
directing
the
LRC to
implement
the
impugned
decision
dated"
"26-02-2013 to transfer
the subject matter
to the 14th Respondent and a Writ of"
"Prohibition restraining the LRC from transferring the subject matter
to a third"
"party. The Court of Appeal allowed the Application on 03-08-2022."
"In
the
instant Application,
the Petitioners
are
seeking,
inter-alia,
a Writ of"
"Certiorari
to quash the decision dated 26-02-2013 of
the LRC to transfer
the"
"corpus
to the 14th Respondent or a 3rd party.
In those circumstances,
it
