"further during the oral submissions the counsel for petitioner reiterated on"
"the disturbance caused to the neighbors due to the constructed kovil and its"
"proceedings.  However,  the  counsel 
for  the  respondent 
firmly  noted  and"
"emphasized  on  the 
fact  that  the  counsel 
for  the  petitioner 
in  his  oral"
"submissions  used  the 
term 
‘Public  Nuisance’  repeatedly  to  explain  the"
"disturbance  caused  by  the  acts  of  the  16th  respondent.  And  thereby  stated"
"that in an event of ‘Public Nuisance’ Section 261 of the Penal Code identifies"
"and carries separate remedies and legal consequences. And as per Section 98"
"of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, an application seeking relief under the"
"offence of public nuisance could be  made to the Magistrate’s  Court. Hence,"
"claimed that the petitioner must go before an appropriate forum in order to"
"obtain proper relief for the matter of concern."
"This  Court  also  notes  that  documents  submitted  by  the  petitioner  of  the"
"instant  application 
is 
vague 
in 
its  nature,  nevertheless 
it 
could  be"
"acknowledged that the document marked R4 marked (by 1-5th respondents)"
"issued  by  the  Nuwara  Eliya  Municipal  Council  was 
issued  prima 
facie"
"according to the procedure laid down in the statute. However, if the petitioner"
"believes  otherwise,  he  may  possibly  have  challenged  the  document  at  an"
"appropriate forum."
"Thereby this Court is of the view that the prayer of the petitioner seeking relief"
"through Writ cannot be granted."
"Application dismissed without costs."
