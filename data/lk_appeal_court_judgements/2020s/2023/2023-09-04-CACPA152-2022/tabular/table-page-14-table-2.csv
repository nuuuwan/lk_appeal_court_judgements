s
 
well-settled law that a thing which cannot be done directly, cannot be allowed to be"
"done indirectly. The petitioner to the present application in my opinion is seeking to impugn"
"t
he judgment delivered by the learned High Court Judge in an indirect manner than"
"provided for in the law, which he cannot achieve directly by reason of his right to challenge"
"t
he propriety of the said judgment in the Supreme Court by way of a direct appeal. Further,"
"i

"application would be appealable to the Supreme Court in terms of Article 127 of the"
"Constitution. This would undoubtedly lead to absurdity and above all, the petitioner will"
"have a second bite at the cherry, which is not available to a person who has already"
"exercised the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.”"
