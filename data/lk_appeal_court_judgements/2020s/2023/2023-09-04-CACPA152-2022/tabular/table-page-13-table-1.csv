"Under section 5C of the Act, appeal from the judgments and orders of the Provincial High Court",""

"It  is  noteworthy  that  ‘Review’  is  a  term  that  is  similar  to  revision,  according  to  Black’s  Law",""
"Dictionary, the term review means,",""
"","A reconsideration; second view or examination; revision; or consideration for purposes"
"","of correction. Used especially for the examination of a cause by an appellate court, and"
"","of a second investigation of a proposed public road by a jury of viewers."
"A literal meaning of the term ‘review’ suggests that the leave to appeal was to be granted if there is",""
"a  question  of  law  to  be  answered  or  if  the  matter  is  fit  to  be  reviewed  by  the  court.  This  Act",""
"essentially  empowered  the  Supreme  Court  to  consider  appeals  if  the  judgment  was  fit  to  be",""
"reviewed, i.e., revised by the court. I would go so far as to state that, the Act essentially requires",""
"Supreme Court to allow appeals even if grounds exist which would be ordinarily considered as",""
"grounds  for  a  revision  application  even  though  the  Supreme  Court  is  not  empowered  with",""
"revisionary jurisdiction in a traditional sense.",""
"In interpreting section 5C, it states that an ‘appeal’ lies ‘directly’ to the Supreme Court. The term",""
"‘directly’ [emphasis added] indicates by-passing any other court (being the Court of Appeal). The",""

"‘revision’ is because a revision cannot lie to the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court does not have",""
