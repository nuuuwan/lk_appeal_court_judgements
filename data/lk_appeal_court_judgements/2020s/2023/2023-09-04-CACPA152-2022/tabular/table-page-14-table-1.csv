"Moreover, if litigants are allowed to file a revision application in the Court of Appeal against a"
"judgment or order given by the Provincial High Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction it would"
"lead to unnecessary duplication of court proceedings. This could result in a revision application"
"being filed in the Court of Appeal while an appeal is pending in the Supreme Court. It would also"
"have the effect of the Court of Appeal being given an opportunity to overrule a judgment of the"
"Supreme Court if the revision application is successful while the appeal to the Supreme Court is"
"not, which is an unintended absurdity."
"It would also give three different appeals from a judgment or order by the District Court, firstly"
"appeal or revision application to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal and a leave to appeal to"
"the  Supreme  Court,  secondly  a  revision  application  filed  in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  and  thirdly  an"
"appeal from such a revision application from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court."
"Furthermore, to allow the Court of Appeal to exercise revisionary jurisdiction in this manner would"
"allow the court to intentionally go beyond the statutory scope of Act No. 19 of 1990 which has"
"clearly stated that the appeal from Provincial High Courts should lie directly to the Supreme Court"
"after leave being obtained first."
"In the case G.K.D. Stephan Gunaratne v Maddumage Thushara Indika Sampath [supra], Justice"
"Salam stated that,"
