"In  view  of  the  aforesaid  analysis  of  the  relevant  statutory  provisions,  it  clearly  manifests  that  it"
"would be a paradox to permit the Court of Appeal to exercise revisionary jurisdiction against a"
"court  exercising  similar  jurisdiction  to  that  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  civil  appellate  matters  -  the"
"Provincial High Court. This court should not lie in revision of the Provincial High Courtâ€™s judgments"
"in exercises of its civil appellate jurisdiction provided by Act No. 54 of 2006 which is an exercise"
"of the same jurisdiction as this Court."
"In  light  of  the  foregoing,  the  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  Respondent  regarding  the"
"jurisdiction of this court has been upheld. Therefore, I hold that this court does not have jurisdiction"
"to  interfere  with  the  judgment  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Western  Province  exercising"
"appellate jurisdiction dated 21.10.2022. As such Order of the learned Judge of the District Court"
"of Colombo in the case bearing No. 561/17/DDR dated 21.06.2019 which has been affirmed in"
"the judgment of the learned Provincial High Court Judge in Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/31/2019"
"(RA) remains in effect."
"Hence, the application is dismissed with cost."
