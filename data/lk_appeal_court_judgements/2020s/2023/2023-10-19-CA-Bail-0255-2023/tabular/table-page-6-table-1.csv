"American  Convention  on  Human  Rights 
(Article  8(1), 
the  African"
"Charter  on  Human  and  Peopleâ€™s  Rights 
(Article  7(1)(d),  and 
the"
"European  Convention 
for 
the 
Protection 
of  Human  Rights 
and"
"Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1)."
"When a person is kept in remand without taking his or her case for trial"
"for a considerable period of time, he or  she  should be released on bail"
"pending trial. Otherwise, this will lead not only  to prison overcrowding"
"but  also  violates  his  or  her 
fundamental  rights  which  have  been"
"guaranteed under the Constitution."
"Hence, I consider the delay more than three years in remand falls into"
"the 
category 
of 
excessive 
and 
oppressive 
delay 
considering 
the"
"circumstances of this case.  Hence, considering all the circumstances of"
"this  case,  the  Accused  has  very  good  exceptional  circumstances  to"
"consider  this  application  in  his  favour.  Further,  remanding  a  suspect"
"without commencing his or her trial will prejudice his or her rights and"
"family as well."
"Offences  under  Section  54A(d)  and  54A(b)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and"
"Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no"
"doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form"
"a  ground  to  refuse  bail.  In  considering  these  matters,  the  court  must"
"bear in mind the presumption of innocence."
"Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail"
"is  primarily  at  the  discretion  of  the  Courts.  The  discretion  should  be"
"exercised  with  due care  and  caution  taking  into  account  the  facts  and"
"circumstances of each case."
"Considering  all  these 
factors 
into  account,  especially  the  period 
in"
"remand, the pure quantity of Heroin detected and the circumstances of"
"the  case, 
I  consider  this  an  appropriate  case  to  grant  bail  to  the"
"Accused.  Hence,  I  order  the  Accused  be  granted  bail  with  following"
"strict conditions."
