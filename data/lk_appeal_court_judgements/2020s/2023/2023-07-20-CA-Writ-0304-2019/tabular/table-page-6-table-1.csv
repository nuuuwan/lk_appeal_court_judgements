"class title of absolute ownership4. Therefore, Section 29 of the RT Act does"
"not apply in this instance."
"However, there is another instance where a party could seek remedy from"
"Court  under  the  RT  Act.  Section  59  provides  that  a  Court  may  order"
"rectification of  the  register  where it is satisfied that any  registration  has"
"been obtained by fraud. Once such an order is made, the Registrar of Title"
"has to rectify the register and the other records maintained under the RT"
"Act5. Thus, it is clear that the RT Act has allowed Court intervention even"
"after the registration of the title. It is important to observe that although in"
"Sections 21, 22, and also in Section 29,  the  Court having jurisdiction is"
"specified as the District Court having jurisdiction over the area in which"
"such a land is situated, in Section 59, the Legislature has not specified the"
"Court. Therefore, at first glance, it appears that a party seeking a remedy"
"under section 59 is free to bring an action in the District Court or invoke"
"writ jurisdiction of this Court. Yet, a committed fraud must be established"
"for a Court to order rectification of the register under Section 59. In a writ"
"application, this Court will not decide on disputed facts as such6. Therefore,"
"in  my  view,  the  remedy  under  Section  59  is  quite  independent  of  an"
"application for a prerogative writ."
"Be that as it may, it is clear that the entries in the Title Register are subject"
"to being reviewed in Courts and for rectification. Consequently, there is no"
"sanctity  attached  to  the  Certificate  of  Title  or  to  the  entries  in  the  Title"
"Register, as submitted by the Respondents."
"In  the  instant  application,  the  Petitioner  seeks  relief  upon  the  breach  of"
"principles  of  natural  justice  and  also  under  the  procedural  impropriety"
"which is amenable to a writ."
"Next,  I  will  consider  whether  the  aforementioned  remedy  excludes  writ"
"jurisdiction."
"In the case of Obeysekera v. Albert and others (C.A.),7 the Court of Appeal"
"considered  the  alternative  remedy  available  to  an  aggrieved  party  under"
"Section  20  (1)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes Act  to  repudiate  an  arbitration"
"award. It was held that certiorari is a discretionary remedy and will not"
"normally  be  granted  unless  and  until  the  plaintiff  has  exhausted  other"
"remedies reasonably available and equally appropriate. The Court held that"
