"Section  20  (1)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act  conferred  the  right  on  the"
"aggrieved party to repudiate the award and accordingly, such party cannot"
"seek, a discretionary remedy such as certiorari."
"However, in the latter case of E. S. Fernando v. United Workers Union and"
"others8 the Supreme Court, contrary to the above decision of the Court of"
"Appeal, held that ‘assuming that the repudiation of an award in terms of"
"section 20 is a ""remedy"", yet it is not an adequate and an effectual remedy."
"To disentitle the petitioner-appellant to the remedy by way of certiorari,"
"the  ""alternative  remedy""  must  be  an  adequate  and  effectual  remedy."
"In Obeysekera vs. Albert and others, the Court of Appeal does not seem to"
"have sufficiently addressed its mind to the question of the  adequacy and"
"efficacy of the ""remedy"" provided in section 20 of the Industrial Disputes"
"Act. In this view of the matter, as at present advised.’"
"Consequently, the Supreme Court held that Obeysekera v, Albert and others"
"(C.A.)9 has been wrongly decided10."
"S. M. Mehta, in his book titled Indian Constitutional Law,11 states that ‘the"
"existence of an alternative remedy may be a ground for refusing a writ of"
"certiorari,  where  the  defect  of  jurisdiction  is  not  patent  on  the  face  of"
"record  and  the  fundamental  rights  are  not  involved.  This  is  a  Rule  of"
"convenience and not a Rule of law and hence certiorari may be issued"
"even when an alternative remedy is available. Thus, an alternative remedy"
"which is not speedy, effective, or adequate is no ground for refusing a writ"
"of certiorari.’"
"I am aware that there is no allegation of violation of fundamental rights in"
"the instant case, which is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. However,"
"this is only one of the two aspects that S.M. Mehta has taken into account"
"in making the above comment. The other is the defect of jurisdiction on the"
"face  of  the  record,  which  is  present  in  this  case,  for  the  reasons  stated"
"hereinbelow in this judgment."
"In  Somasunderam  Vanniasingham  v.  Forbes  and  another  (S.C.)12  Her"
"Ladyship  Bandaranayake J.,  (as Her Ladyship then was)  observed that13"
