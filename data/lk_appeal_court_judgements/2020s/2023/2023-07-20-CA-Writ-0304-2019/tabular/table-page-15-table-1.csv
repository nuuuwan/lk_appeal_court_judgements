"Accordingly,  I  am  of 
the  view 
that  Section  22  of 
the  Interpretation"
"Ordinance is not a bar to maintain the instant application."
"In the case of Atapattu and others v. People’s Bank and others33, the issue"
"before the Supreme Court was whether Article 140 is subject to the other"
"laws which were kept alive by Article 168 (1). Article 140, unlike Article"
"146, has a phrase that the powers and authority of the Court of Appeal are"
"‘subject to the provisions of the Constitution’. The Supreme Court held that"
"the phrase ‘subject to the provisions of the Constitution’ is necessarily there"
"to avoid conflicts between Article 140 and other Constitutional provisions"
"such as Articles 80 (3), 120, 124, 125, and 126 (3). Consequently, it was"
"held that the aforementioned phrase refers only to contrary provisions in"
"the Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written"
"laws. The Supreme Court observed that the language used in Article 140"
"of the Constitution is broad enough to confer unfettered jurisdiction to the"
"Court of Appeal to review, even on grounds excluded by the ouster clauses."
"Further,  His  Lordship  Fernando  J.,  observed  that  the  presumption  must"
"always be in favour of the jurisdiction which enhances the protection of the"
"rule of law, and against an ouster clause which tends to undermine it."
"Article 140 also provides that the power of the Court of Appeal has to be"
"exercised ‘according to law’. Therefore, I am of the view that it is pertinent"
"to consider the phrase ‘according to law’ in Article 140 of the Constitution"
"as  well.  In  the  cases  of  Goonasinghe  v.  de  Kretser34,  Nakkuda  Ali  v."
"Jayaratne,35  and  M.  D.  Chandresena  and  two  others  v.  S.  P.  de  Silva"
"(Director of Education)36 Court interpreted the term ‘according to law’ to"
"mean the relevant Rules of English common law. The above decisions were"
"based on the premise that the law relating to prerogative writs originated"
"and evolved in the United Kingdom. This had been followed by our Courts"
"in a long line of authorities."
"In the cases of B. Sirisena Cooray v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and two"
"others,37 it was held that ‘the writ jurisdiction conferred upon the Superior"
"Courts  by  Article  140  of 
the  Constitution  and 
it  cannot  be 
lawfully"
"restricted by the provisions of ordinary Legislation contained in the ouster"
"clauses.’"
