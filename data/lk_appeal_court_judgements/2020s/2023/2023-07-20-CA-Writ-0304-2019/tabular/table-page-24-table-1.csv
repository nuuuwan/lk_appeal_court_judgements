"Another argument advanced by the Respondents is that this application is"
"futile since the Petitioner has not sought to quash the Gazette notification"
"marked ‘P 10’. Their contention was that even if the reliefs sought by the"
"Petitioner are granted, the Gazette notification ‘P 10’ would remain intact."
"‘P 10’ is a Gazette notification published under Section 14 of the RT Act"
"The learned State Counsel for the 3rd 5th and 7th Respondents submitted in"
"the written submission that as per Section 14, it is the Gazette notification"
"‘P 10’ which depicts the determination of the Commissioner of Title."
"However, the Gazette is merely the publication of the determination of the"
"Commissioner  of  Title  Settlement. 
  Once  the  publication  is  made  an"
"aggrieved claimant could prefer an appeal to the District Court against the"
"declaration59.  After 
the  publication  of 
the  Gazette  notification  under"
"Section 14, if the Commissioner of Title Settlement is of the view that a"
"claimant has established his claim; under Section 20 of the RT Act, he shall"
"declare such claimant eligible for the registration as the owner and shall"
"register such interest in the Title Register. It is this registration, that confers"
"on a person a first-class title of absolute ownership.  Furthermore, it is the"
"entries in the Title Register that have a conclusive effect60. A Certificate of"
"Title is issued to those who possess a title of ownership or other interest."
"The Certificate of Title shall form conclusive evidence of the title61. The"
"Gazette  notification 
in 
terms  of  section  14  of 
the  RT  Act  could  be"
"distinguished 
from  publication 
in 
terms  of  section  38  of 
the  Land"
"Acquisition  Act.  A  publication 
in 
terms  of  section  38  of 
the  Land"
"Acquisition Act itself vests the property in the state. But as I have already"
"stated, a Gazette notification in terms of section 14 of the RT Act itself does"
"not confer absolute title. The absolute title is conferred by the subsequent"
"administrative steps."
"The  learned  State  Counsel  for  the  3rd,  5th,  and  7th  Respondents,  in  the"
"written submission, drew the attention of the Court to the case of Rathansiri"
"and others v. Ellawala and others62 and argued that this application is futile"
"without quashing the Gazette notification ‘P 10’. This was a case where a"
"decision taken by the Transfer Appeal Board was approved and adopted by"
"the Secretary to the Ministry of Tertiary Education. No relief was sought"
"in  respect  of  the  decision  made  by  the  Secretary  to  the  Ministry.  In  the"
"circumstances, it was held that it would be futile to grant the relief prayed"
