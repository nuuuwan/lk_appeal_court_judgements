"‘Judicial  review  is  radically  different  from  the  system  of  appeal.  When"
"hearing an appeal, the Court is concerned with the merits of the decision"
"under appeal. But in judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality."
"On appeal, the question is right or wrong. On review, the question is lawful"
"or unlawful … Judicial review is a fundamentally different operation.’"
"Accordingly, the basic principles involved in judicial review are distinct"
"from those involved in an appeal. In my view, those are not the same as an"
"action instituted in the District Court seeking a declaratory remedy as well."
"The District Court action commenced in the year 2015 but, has not been"
"concluded yet. Hence, it is apparent that the District Court action is not a"
"speedy, effective, and efficacious remedy. On the other hand, the Petitioner"
"has instituted instant application on the grounds of breach of the principle"
"of natural justice and error on the face of the record. For the reasons which"
"would be set out below in this judgment, there is a procedural defect on the"
"face of the record coupled with breach of the principle of natural justice."
"Hence, I am of the view that the institution of action in the District Court"
"does not exclude writ jurisdiction."
"Does delay defeat writ remedy?"
"The  Petitioner  first  instituted  the  action  in  the  District  Court  seeking"
"declaratory  reliefs  and  claiming  consequential  damages  on  the  17th  of"
"September 2015."
"In the case of Lindsey Petroleum Co. v. Hurd18, in dealing with delay it was"
"observed;  ‘two  circumstances  always  important  in  such  cases  are  the"
"length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval which"
"might  affect  either  party  and  cause  a  balance  of  justice  or  injustice  in"
"taking the one course or the other, so far as related to the remedy’"
"In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another,19 it was observed"
"that; ‘if a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law"
"refused afterward to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law"
"both  to  punish  his  neglect,  “nam  leges  vigilantibus,  non  dormientibus"
"subveniunt”, and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over"
"their rights and are not vigilant.’"
