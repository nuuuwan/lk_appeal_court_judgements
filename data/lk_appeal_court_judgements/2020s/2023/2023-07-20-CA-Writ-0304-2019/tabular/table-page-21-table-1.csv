"and all subsequent steps taken by the Commissioner on the basis of the"
"said vesting order are void in law. (emphasis added)"
"Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded that failure to comply with the"
"statutory procedure leads to nullity."
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  it  is  apparent  that  the  Respondents  have"
"failed to follow the procedure laid down in Regulation 4 of the Gazette"
"Notification ‘P 1’; which nullifies the proceedings."
"Whether  the  1st  to  5th  and  7th  Respondents  have  violated  the  Rule  of"
"natural justice."
"According 
to  Section  13  of 
the  RT  Act, 
the  Commissioner  of  Title"
"Settlement  shall  cause  an 
investigation 
to  be  conducted 
in  order 
to"
"determine the genuineness or otherwise of the claims made in response to"
"a notice under Section 12. The 4th Respondent stated in his statement of"
"objections  that  since  the  only  claimant  was  Lucihamy,  there  was  no"
"necessity to conduct an inquiry under Section 13 of the RT Act52. However,"
"Section 13 clearly states that the genuineness or otherwise of claims made"
"has to be determined after an investigation. The 3rd and 5th Respondents"
"have 
stated 
that 
the  3rd  Respondent  conducted  a 
‘search  of  prior"
"registration of title’ in respect of the subject land in the Land Registry of"
"Marawila.  Consequently, 
the  3rd  Respondent  has  observed 
that 
the"
"revocation of the Deed of Gift by Lucihamy is invalid and has made an"
"entry in the forms titled ‘Pre-investigation notes on documents at the Title"
"Registration Office’ (‘3 R 3’). According to the 3rd and 5th Respondents, the"
"3rd  Respondent  has  subsequently  submitted  his  observation  to  the  4th"
"Respondent and the 4th Respondent has instructed the 3rd Respondent that"
"the Deed of Gift could be revoked. Consequently, the 3rd Respondent has"
"proceeded to prepare the Title Investigation Report marked ‘P 11’ and the"
"4th Respondent has approved the same. The 3rd and 5th respondents have"
"submitted  that  they  acted  in  good  faith  at  all  times53. According  to  the"
"minute  made 
in 
‘Pre-investigation  notes  on  documents  at 
the  Title"
"Registration  Office’ 
(‘3  R 
3’), 
the  4th  Respondent, 
the  Assistant"
"Commissioner has received instructions from the Legal officer at the head"
"office  to  the  effect  that  the  revocation  of  the  Deed  of  Gift  is  valid."
"Accordingly, the above decision of the 3rd Respondent as well as of the 4th"
"Respondent are influenced by extraneous considerations."
