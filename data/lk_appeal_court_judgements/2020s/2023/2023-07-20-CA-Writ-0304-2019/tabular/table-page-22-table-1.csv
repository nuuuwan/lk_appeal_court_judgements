"This Court observes that Lucihamy was only a life interest holder and she"
"had no right whatsoever to cancel the Deed of Gift executed by her husband"
"Peduru Appuhamy in favour of the Petitioner (‘P 3’) and also to transfer"
"the said land to the 1st Respondent upon deed ‘P 5’."
"However,  as  I  have  already  stated  above  in  this  judgment,  in  a  writ"
"application, the Court will not rule on the disputed facts."
"Be that as it may, according to ‘Pre-investigation notes on documents at"
"the Title Registration Office’ (‘3 R 3’), the 3rd Respondent has come across"
"deed ‘P 3’ executed in favour of the Petitioner, consequent to the search"
"conducted by him at the Land Registry of Marawila. The 3rd Respondent"
"has made a note that there is no condition in the deed ‘P 3’ reserving the"
"right to revoke. Further, the only condition in the said deed is that the gift"
"is subject to the life interest of the donor and his wife Lucihamy."
"The 3rd Respondent in conducting his investigation into the genuineness or"
"otherwise of the claim made in respect of the subject land, has identified"
"the Petitioner as a person having an interest in the land but, failed firstly,"
"to notify the Petitioner and secondly, to offer the Petitioner an opportunity"
"to present her case."
"In my view, this is a flagrant violation of the audi alteram partem rule and"
"constitutes a breach of the basic principle of natural justice."
"On the other hand, when it was revealed that the Petitioner has a legitimate"
"claim to the subject land, even after considering the opinion of the legal"
"officer at the head office, the 3rd and 4th Respondents could have at least"
"registered a second-class title in the name of the 1st Respondent without"
"registering in a first-class title."
"Alternatively,  since  the  RT Act  provides  for  the  Commissioner  of  Title"
"Settlement to refer the matter to the District Court when he is of the view"
"that it would be more appropriate for the investigation to be carried out by"
"the District Court, he should have referred the matter to the District Court"
"for a determination54. Therefore, it is unreasonable on the part of the 3rd"
"and 4th Respondents not to have referred the matter to the District Court."
"In my opinion, in order to ensure proper registration, the RT Act should"
"have provisions for establishing a competent panel, at the very least. The"
"Minister has the power to appoint a qualified panel to be referees of title"
