"As viewed correctly by the learned High Court Judge, he has suppressed vital"
"material facts to the original Court and has come out with new material before"
"the High Court which has no value in order to challenge the determination of the"
"learned Magistrate."
"It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the appellant had no basis to challenge the"
"order when he filed the application in revision before the Provincial High Court."
"The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well  considered  the 
factual  and 
legal"
"provisions in that regard, and had correctly dismissed the application."
"Accordingly, I find no reasons to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate"
"of Samanthurai as well as the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the"
"Provincial High Court of Eastern Province holden at Kalmunai."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  appellant  has  filed  this appeal  before  this"
"Court, not for anything else, but to cause the maximum possible harassment to"
"the respondent, knowing very well the strength of his appeal."
"The appeal is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High"
"Court  of  Kalmunai  and 
to 
the  Magistrate  Court  of  Sammanthurai 
for"
"information."
