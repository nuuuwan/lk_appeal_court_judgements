"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely"
"W Ratnapala under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of"
"Victims of Crime and Witnesses act."
"A  complaint  had  been 
lodged  against  the  suspect  on  25.4.2021  for"
"attempted  murder  and  had  been  bailed  out  by  the  Magistrate  on"
"5.5.2021 and thereafter he had threatened his wife asking her not to give"
"evidence in the substantive case."
"Subsequently the police had filed a B report under the instant act as a"
"result of which the suspect had been remanded and has been in remand"
"ever since."
"The  State  Counsel  appearing 
for  the  respondents  objected  to  the"
"application based on the threats levelled at the victim and sated that the"
"non-summery in the substantive matter had commenced."
"In  considering  the 
law  pertaining  to  the 
instant  matter  bail  can  be"
"considered under the instant act only upon exceptional circumstances by"
"the Court of Appeal and the act has not defined the term exceptional."
"But in many of our decided cases it has been held that the exceptionality"
"depends on the facts and circumstances of each case."
"In  the  instant  case  the  exceptionality  pleaded  is  that  although  eight"
"months have passed  since the incarceration of the suspect the  matter"
"pertaining to the suspect has not been concluded."
