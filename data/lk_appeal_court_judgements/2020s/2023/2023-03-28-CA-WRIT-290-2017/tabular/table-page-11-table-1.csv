"Thus, I take the view that even during the recovery process of loans under the said Act, all"
"the transactions between the borrower and the bank cannot be designated with a statutory"
"flavour. Borrowing money from banks is a complete contractual relationship between the"
"borrower and the bank and the statutory provisions in the said Act have been provided for"
"the recovery of loans granted by the banks for the economic development of the country"
"and  for  matters  connected  therein  or  incidental  thereto  (See-the  long  title  of  the  Act)."
"Therefore, it is important to sever the statutory duties of the licensed commercial banks"
"among many other transactions of such banks during the process of recovery of loans. It"
"is stated in ‘Banks and Banking Law in Sri Lanka’ (by W. S. Weerasuriya, 2006, Institute"
"of Bankers Sri Lanka, p. 203); ‘While no doubt there is a close relationship between the"
"banking practice and banking law, bankers must clearly appreciate that banking practice"
"is not invariably banking law’."
"In light of the foregoing, I hold that Petitioners are not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed"
"for  in  the  prayer  of  the  Petition.  Thus,  I  proceed  to  dismiss  the  Application  of  the"
"Petitioner."
"Application is dismissed."
