"If you go on the strict interpretation of Section 17, it implies that a borrower or any person"
"on his behalf may apply to a Review Court in respect of transgressions of the bank relating"
"to the cancellation of the Certificate of Sale. Anyhow a non-cancellation of a Certificate"
"of Sale can be challenged only if the total amount due in respect of the loan including all"
"interests are settled. In order to settle such dues mentioned in Section 17, the borrower and"
"the bank are at liberty to enter into any type of agreement and it cannot be assumed that"
"such agreement will also be amenable to writ jurisdiction. Hence, I take the view that this"
"Court cannot intervene to enforce the said purported agreement ‘P10’."
"Having considered the relief sought by the Petitioners for a writ of Mandamus, now I need"
"to deal with the Petitioners’ claim for a writ of Certiorari."
"Apart from the provisions in the said Section 17, the Petitioners rely on Section 19 of the"
"Act. Certain limitation has been imposed by Section 19 of the Act debarring the bank to"
"hold the mortgaged property for a longer period than it is necessary to enable the bank to"
"re-sell the property. I cannot assume that the provisions of Section 19 have any bearing on"
"the  instant  Application  as  the  Petitioners’  main  claim  is  on  the  legitimate  expectation"
"arising from the purported agreement ‘P10’."
"The Petitioners further argue that the Certiorari that has been sought is superfluous as the"
"said  Deed  of  Transfer  ‘P20’  is  void.  In  order  to  substantiate  the  said  argument,  the"
"Petitioners  have  referred  to  the  dicta  in  the  judgement  of  Lord  Denning  in  MacFoy  vs."
"United Africa Co. Ltd. (1961) 3 A.E.R. 1169 which has been applied in the Sri Lankan case"
"of Rajakulendran vs. Wijesundera (Sriskantha Vol. 1 Part 1 page 164). The following passage"
"at page 168 of the said Rajakulendran case has been highlighted;"
