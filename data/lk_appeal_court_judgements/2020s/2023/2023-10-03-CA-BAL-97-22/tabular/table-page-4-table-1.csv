"In 
the  case  of  Ranil  Charuka  Kulatunga  Vs  Attorney  General  CA(PHC)"
"APN134/2015 the Court held that,"
"“the  quantity  of  cocaine  involved  in  this  case  is  62.847  grammes,"
"which 
is  a  commercial  quantity. 
 
If  petitioner 
is  convicted, 
the"
"punishment is death or life imprisonment.  Under these circumstances"
"it is prudent to conclude the trial early while the petitioner is kept in"
"custody.”"
"I
n this case, the pure heroin detected was 809.6 grammes which is certainly"
"a  commercial  quantity. 
  Considering  the  gravity  of  the  offence  and  the"
"sentence  prescribed  under 
the  Poison,  Opium,  and  Dangerous  Drugs"
"Ordinance, there is  a high risk  of the suspect  absconding,  if he  is  enlarged"
"on  bail.  In  view  of  this,  it  is  prudent  to  conclude  the  High  Court  case"
"expeditiously while the suspect is in remand custody."
"T
he  grounds  urged  by  the  petitioner,  in  this  case,  cannot  be  considered  as"
"exceptional circumstances."
"F
urther,  the  delay  of  more  than  two  years  in  remand  does  not  fall  into  the"
"category  of  excessive  and  oppressive  delay,  considering  the  clarity  of  the"
"offence and other circumstances of this case."
"C
onsidering  all  the  material  placed  before  this  Court,  the  petitioner  has"
"failed to satisfy that there are exceptional grounds to enlarge the suspect on"
"bail.  Therefore, this bail application is refused."
"T
he Registrar of this Court is directed to send copies of this order to the OIC"
"of the Colombo Crime Division, Magistrate’s Court of Welisara and the High"
"Court of Negombo."
