"properly."
"Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal"
"As the 2nd ground of appeal is a ground of appeal relating to the date of offence"
"as mentioned in the charges preferred against the appellant on the basis that it"
"was not proved, I will now proceed to consider the 2nd ground of appeal before"
"considering the other grounds urged."
"In  the  indictment,  the  prosecution  has  mentioned  that  the  three  instances  of"
"grave sexual abuse were committed during a period of 2 months. That is to say"
"between  11th  April  2004  and  11th  June  2004.  It  was  the  contention  of  the"
"learned Counsel for the appellant that the victim has failed to give evidence in"
"that regard, but has stated that the complaint was made in the year 2004. She"
"has  failed  to  mention  dates  or  months.  Even  the  grandmother  (PW-04)  has"
"failed  to  come  out  with  any  specific  dates  of  the  alleged  offences  was  the"
"contention. It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the"
"relevant complaint  has been made on 11th June 2004 and there was no basis"
"to  conclude  from  the  evidence  placed  before  the  trial  Court  that  the  offences"
"took place during the time period mentioned in the said charges."
"It is clear from the evidence of the victim that when she faced these incidents of"
"grave sexual abuse, she was studying in grade 5 of her school. The doctor has"
"given  her  age  as  10  years  old  in  his  MLR.  The  evidence  of  the  victim  clearly"
"shows that the perpetrator of this crime has used the young age of the victim"
"and  her  family  situation  to  his  advantage.  The  victim  child  who  was  without"
"her  natural  mother  has  only  revealed  these  abuses  to  her  teachers  at  school,"
"which has led to a complaint being made in this regard to the police. The said"
"complaint had been made on the 11th of June 2004."
