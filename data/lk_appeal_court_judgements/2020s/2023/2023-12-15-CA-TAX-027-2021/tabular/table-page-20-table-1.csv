"The learned Judge decided,"
"“The section speaks of sixty days, and the starting point is certain and"
"there  can  be  no  dispute.  Since  the  application  under  section  66(1)  is  to"
"“require” the Tribunal to refer a case the obvious construction is that the"
"“requiring”  must  be  within  60  days.  Now  a  person  is  “required”  to  do"
"something only when he knows of it and not while the letter is lying in a"
"post  office  unknown  to  him.  The  Tribunal  is  “required”  to  refer  the"
"questions when the application reaches the Tribunal and not before. The"
"sub  section  nowhere  uses  the  phrase  “require  by  an  application  made"
"within 60 days”, which has been expounded in the Orissa High Court. The"
"sub  section  read  grammatically  means  only  that  the  Tribunal  must  be"
"“required”  within  60  days  to  refer  the  questions,  and  then  the  Tribunal"
"must within 90 days make the reference. There is really no hiatus [a pause]"
"between  terminus  ad  quem  [the  point  at  which  something  ends]  of  the"
"limitation for applications and the terminus a quo [starting point] of the"
"90 days in which the reference has to be made. For this second period the"
"terminus a quo [starting point] is also the receipt of the application. The"
"section,  in  my  opinion,  is  quite  clear  and  does  not  admit  of  any  other"
"construction.” (page 225 – 226)"
