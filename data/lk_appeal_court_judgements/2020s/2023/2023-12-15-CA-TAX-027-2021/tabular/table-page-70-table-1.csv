"Commissioner, or Assessor or Assistant Commissioner is duly printed or"

"Furthermore section 08 of the Nation Building Tax Act No. 09 of 2009 provides,"
"among  other  things,  that,  provisions  in  Chapter  XXII  relating  to  Assessments"

"against assessments, finality of assessments and penalty for incorrect returns,"
"tax in default and sums added thereto, recovery of tax, miscellaneous, penalties"

"following modifications."
"The argument of the appellant is that the function of making an assessment"
"and sending a notice of assessment are functions that must be performed"
"by one and the same person in view of the fact that section 163(1) clearly"
"contemplates that these functions should be performed by the same person."
"It is also argued, that, as the requirement for making an assessment is set out"
"in  section  163(1)  of  the  Act  the  amount  of  tax  which  in  the  judgment  of  the"
"Assessor ought to be paid must be determined by the Assessor and by notice in"
"writing require such person to pay the tax forthwith. The position of the appellant"
"is that the power to make the assessment is coupled with a duty of sending the"
"notice of assessment."

"particular return."
