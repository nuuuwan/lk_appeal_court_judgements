"Frequently  he  was  at  odds  with  Lord  Simonds  in  particular  who  once"
"memorably expressed his distaste for Lord Denning’s preference for ‘filling"
"in the gaps’ left by poor or confusing drafting as ‘a naked usurpation of"
"the 
legislative 
function  under 
the 
thin  disguise  of 
interpretation.’"
"According to the Sunday Times obituary, it was the frustration which"
"resulted  from  conflict  with  Lord  Simonds  that  led  Lord  Denning  to"
"accept the apparent demotion from the House of Lords consequent"
"on his acceptance of the office of Master of the Rolls in April 1962. In"
"the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning’s judgments, even the dissenting ones,"
"could have much more impact on the shaping of the law than was possible"
"in  the  House  of  Lords.  It 
is  also  worth  noting  that  Lord  Denning’s"
"appointment  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  19th  April  1962  was  made  by"
"Harold Macmillan. Macmillan was an unorthodox Conservative who was"
"the author of a number of relatively radical initiatives between 1957 and"
"1962  ranging  from  the  creation  of  Life  Peerages,  the  setting  up  of  the"
"National  Economic  Development  Council, 
the  establishment  of  new"
"Universities  and,  most  radically  of  all,  the  application,  in  1961  of  the"
"United Kingdom to join the European Economic Community15."
"15  [The rest  of the Note is reproduced here in footnote]  Macmillan’s  appointment  of  Lord"
"Denning to the Court of Appeal, as Master of the Rolls, in April 1962 could be seen in"
"this  context  as  an  unorthodox,  but  inherently  conservative,  attempt  to  modernise  the"
"institution of the law along similar lines to those which Macmillan adopted with regard"
"to other institutions during the period of his premiership. Lord Denning’s appointment"
"came  between  the  Orpington  by-election,  in  the  seat  next  door  to  that  of  the  Prime"
"Minister, which the Conservatives lost to the Liberals, and the so called ‘night of the long"
"knives’ on 13th July 1962 when Macmillan sacked seven Cabinet ministers, including"
"the Lord Chancellor. It was a time of decided instability in the fortunes of the Conservative"
"government. In this context, Macmillan’s appointment of Lord Denning to conduct the"
"inquiry  into  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  resignation  of  John  Profumo  in  June"
"1963 should be considered an astute manouevre; the deployment of a conservative, but"
"unorthodox,  judge  of  Lord  Denning’s  calibre  was  perhaps  the  only  way  in  which  the"
"gravest  crisis  of  his  premiership  could  have  been  resolved  satisfactorily.  In  the  febrile"
"atmosphere of the summer of 1963, a judge of the stamp of Lord Simonds would not have"
"been  able  to  construct  a  report  which  would  been  credible,  let  alone  have  saved  the"
"government. Lord Denning did not disappoint; his Report saved Macmillan, perhaps even"
"the Establishment itself. Despite his modest criticism of his conduct as Prime Minster"
"during  the  affair,  Lord  Denning  retained  a  substantial  amount  of  respect  for  Harold"
"Macmillan. He concluded his account of the whole business in Landmarks in the Law by"
