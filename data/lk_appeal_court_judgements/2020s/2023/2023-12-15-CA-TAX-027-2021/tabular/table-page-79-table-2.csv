"(later  Hon.  Chief  Justice)","(with  Sarath  Nanda  Silva  C.  J.  and  Gamini"
"Amaratunge J., agreeing) said,",""
"","“It is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes"
"","and  duties,  not  to  extend  the  provisions  of  the  statute  by  implication,"
"","beyond the clear import of the language used or to enlarge their operation"
"","in order to embrace matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt,"
"","the provisions are construed most strongly against the state and in"
"","favour of the citizen thus, the intention to impose duties and or taxes"
"","on imported goods must be shown by clear and unambiguous language"
"","and cannot be inferred by ambiguous  words.  The court cannot give  a"
"","wider  interpretation  to  section  16  as  claimed  by  the  learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor  General  merely  because  some","financial 
loss  may 
in  certain"
"circumstances  be  caused","to 
the  state.  Considerations  of  hardship,"
"","injustice  or  anomalies  do  not  play  any  useful  role  in  construing  fiscal"
"","statutes. One must have regard to the strict letter of the law and cannot"
"","import provisions in the Customs Ordinance so as to apply and assume"
"deficiency”.",""
