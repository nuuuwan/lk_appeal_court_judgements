"assessment was one and the same and therefore the assessment was"
"invalid in law?"
"The  appellant  has  also  argued  that  the notice  of  assessment  is  incorrect.  The"
"reason is that the figures indicated as per computation for the assessment (vide"
"page  59  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commissionâ€™s  brief)  and  the  actual  figures  in  the"
"return (vide page 56 of that brief) as set out in the notice of assessment (vide"
"page  60  of  the  said  brief)  do  not  tally.  Hence  according  to  the  notice  of"
"assessment, the amount in the return and the assessment are the same. It is"
"also  submitted  for  the  appellant  that  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  has  not"
"referred to this question in its determination."
"It appears to this Court that the respondent does not have an answer to give to"
"controvert  this  position  appearing  in  black  and  white.  What  is  submitted  in"
"written submissions dated 11th of May 2023 is that Inland Revenue Act supports"
"that precedence need to be given to substance over form. But the question of the"
"arithmetical figures is not a matter of form but of the substance."
"It  is  also  submitted  for  the  respondent  that  if  the  power  exercised  by  the"
"Commissioner General or the Assessor is referable to a jurisdiction that confers"
"validity  on  such  power,  any  omission  to  refer  to  the  section  under  which  he"
"exercises such power will not itself render such exercise of power invalid or void."
"Whereas  the  non  reference  to  the  empowering  section  is  excusable  the  wrong"
"exercise of jurisdiction (as the amount is incorrect) cannot be the right exercise"
"of the jurisdiction."
"Therefore the appellant is entitled to obtain an answer to this question as prayed"
"for."
