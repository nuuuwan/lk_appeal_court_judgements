"the remedy lies in an amending Act”] Denning L. J., was not deceived by"
"“labels”, “Magor”, “St. Mellons” and now “Magor and St. Mellons”. He said,"
"“I cannot think that the judge is right  about this.  The Minister’s order"
"expressly  provided  that  the  property  of  the  two  rural  district  councils"
"should be transferred to and vest in the combined council. The right of"
"the  two  councils  to  compensation  was  clearly  “Property”  which"
"vested in the combined council and the judge so held, but he thought"
"that the right was worth nothing because the two councils only lived"
"for a moment of time after they had been shorn off their rich grounds."
"Much as I respect his opinions, I cannot agree with him about this."
"The effect of the Minister’s order was, if I may use a metaphor, not"
"the death of the two councils, but their marriage. The burdens which"
"each set of ratepayers had previously borne separately became a combined"
"burden to be borne by them all together. So, also, the rights to which the"
"two councils would have been entitled for each set of ratepayers separately"
"became a combined right to which the combined council was entitled for"
"them  all  together.  This  was  so  obviously  the  intention  of  the  Minister’s"
"order that I have no patience with an ultra legalistic interpretation which"
"would deprive them of their rights altogether. I would repeat what I said"
"in Seaford Court Estates Ltd., vs. Asher [1949] 2 All E. R. 155. We do"
"not sit here to pull the language of Parliament and Ministers to pieces"
"and make nonsense of it. That is an easy thing to do and it is a thing"
"to  which  lawyers  are  too  often  prone.  We  sit  here  to  find  out  the"
"intention of Parliament and of Ministers and carry it out and we do"
"this better by filling in the gaps and making sense of the enactment"
"than by opening it up to destructive analysis.” (page 1235,1236)"
