"reading  a  copy  of  the  Act  which  had  reached  us  two  days  earlier"
"brought it to my notice that the provisions of section 157A of the Act"
"contained a requirement that the judges of the Supreme Court and"
"the court of Appeal should take their oaths in terms of the Seventh"
"Schedule before the President which in fact had not been done by any"
"of the judges. The judges of both courts therefore considered this matter"
"and wrote to the President, inter alia that in their opinion the period of one"
"month expired at midnight on the same day (i.e. the 9th September) and"
"that they were thus prepared to take their oaths. There was no reply from"
"the President. However, I was informed by the Minister of justice that he"
"had contacted the president on this matter and he had been told that the"
"President had been advised by the Attorney-General that the period of one"
"month had expired on the 7th. In the result no oath could be administered."
"On Monday the 12th I was informed that the Courts of the supreme"
"Court and Court of Appeal and the Chambers of all judges had been"
"locked and barred and armed police guards had been placed on the"
"premises  to  prevent  access  to  them.  The  judges  had  been  effectively"
"locked out.‚Äù"
