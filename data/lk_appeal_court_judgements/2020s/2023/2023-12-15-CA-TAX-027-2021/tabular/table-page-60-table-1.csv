"“Howard vs. Bodington 2 P. D. 203, appears to be most in favour of the"
"defendant, but it is clearly distinguishable; there the suit was of a criminal"
"nature and as the defendant did not appear it was necessary to shew that"
"he had received a copy of the representation against him within the limited"
"time;  it  was  held  that  as  the  limited  time  had  been  exceeded  the  suit"
"failed”."
