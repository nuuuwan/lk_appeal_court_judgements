"4(c) and Article 105. He is the one who started the dispute of disputing the tax"
"payer’s self assessment. It could be that a particular tax payer on receiving an"
"intimation of non acceptance of the self assessment may make representations"
"to  the  Assessor  or  to  the  Assistant  Commissioner  and  the  latter  accepts  the"
"position  of  the  tax  payer.  This  position  which  was  succinctly  explained  by"
"Justice Victor Perera in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1981)"
"(Pvt)  Limited  vs. 
2  SLR  78  was  considered  by  me 
in  ACL  Polymers"
"Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue,  C.  A.  Tax  09/2023  decided  on"
"09.12.2022. In the same judgment the case of D. M. S. Fernando vs. Mohideen"
"Ismail, the appeal of the above case to the Supreme Court was also considered."
"From the decision of the Assessor or the Assistant Commissioner the tax payer"
"appeals  to  the  Commissioner  General,  who  is  the  superior  of  the  former.  The"
"contest 
is  between  the  self  assessment  and  the  estimate  prepared  by  his"
"subordinate officer. Before the Tax Appeals Commission too, the only appellant"
"is  the  taxpayer  as  the  Commissioner  General  was  the  decision  maker.  The"
"Commissioners,  although  they  include  retired  Judges  of  the  Superior  Courts"
"because  the  legislature  in  establishing  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  in  2011"
"wanted it to consist of non tax officers as well, are neither appointed by the Head"
"of the State or the Judicial Service Commission, as done in Courts, Tribunals"
"and other institutions under Articles 4(c) and 105 of the Constitution."
"This is the reason why the citizen’s right to pay on the self assessment gets"
"only  suspended  but  not  vitiated  when  disputed  by  the  assessor  and  the"
"Commissioner  General.  That  process  of  disputing 
the  citizen’s 
self"
"assessment culminates at the Tax Appeals Commission. From Tax Appeals"
"Commission upwards what is considered are only questions of law but not"
"facts.  So 
if  the  process  of  disputing  the  self  assessment  cannot  be"
"completed according to law and as required by the law, should not the right"
"of self assessment prevail?"
