"the  aggrieved  party  cannot  be 
implied 
in  the  absence  of  clear  and"
"unambigouous statutory provisions.”"
"Therefore  the  Court  of  Appeal  commenced  applying  the  passage 
from  the"
"judgment in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage saying, “Although the above case was"
"one involving of a fundamental right,…” the Court, it appears, took for granted,"
"that, both situations are similar or identical. It is the position of this Court that"
"it is not so due to following reasons."
"If a citizen whose fundamental right has been violated does not do anything he"
"cannot  assert  that  right  and  obtain  a  remedy  for  the  infringement.  It  needs"
"adjudication for it to come in to existence as a right. If he makes an application"
"the  Supreme  Court  has  to  adjudicate  it  and  if  the  time  limit  obstructs  the"
"Supreme  Court  from  doing  it,  the  citizen  is  deprived  of  his  right  to  get  his"
"fundamental right adjudicated."
"On the other hand, under the system of self assessment of income tax by a citizen"
"prevalent under the law on Income Tax, a citizen has been conferred with a right"
"to pay the amount of tax he assesses, unless and until he is deprived of doing so"
"by the assessor rejecting his self assessment. But it does not stop at the assessor"
"under the law. From there it goes to the Commissioner General and to the Tax"
"Appeals  Commission.  This  is  the  end  of  it  as  far  as  the  disputing  (or  not"
"disputing) of the self assessment is concerned. Can anyone dispute this simple"
"argument?  The  answer 
is  no,  because 
from  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
