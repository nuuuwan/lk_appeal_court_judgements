"The words material in Julius’ s case were,"
"“…It “shall be lawful” for the Bishop of the diocese “on the application of"
"any party complaining thereof” to issue a commission for inquiry”. (page"
"1033)"
"“…It was held that the words “it shall be lawful” merely conferred a power."
"“But there may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to"
"be  done,  something  in  the  conditions  under  which  it  is  to  be  done,"
"something in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the"
"power is to be exercised, which may couple the power with a duty and"
"make it the duty of the person on whom the power is reposed, to exercise"
"that power when called upon to do so” (per Lord Cairns L. C. 222 – 223)"
