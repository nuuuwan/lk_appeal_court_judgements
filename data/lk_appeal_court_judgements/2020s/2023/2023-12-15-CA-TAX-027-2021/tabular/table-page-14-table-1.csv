"information of the new generation of Judges and Lawyers, who perhaps do not"
"know about it,  I venture to record here,  that, when our first Chief Justice Sir"
"Codrington Edmund Carrington presided with one other Judge in the court of"
"equity,  which  became  the  Supreme  Court  of  British  Ceylon,  Edmund  Henry"
"Lushington, due to a dispute arose between the Court and the Army due to the"
"use  of  “parade  grounds”  in  Fort,  Major  General  David  Douglas  Wemyss,  the"
"lieutenant  governor  of  Ceylon  ordered  the  closure  of  “every  entrance  into  the"
"Fort” from 8 o’clock in the morning till 12 noon or 1 p.m., ostensibly on security"
"reasons,  which  disrupted  the  Court  and  Wemyss,  who  ranked  in  the  protocol"
"next to the Governor was summoned before the Court, examined for eight hours"
"and released on a recognizance of a hundred thousand Rix dollars to keep the"
"peace and to be in good behaviour for one year. It was as a result of this incident,"
"that,  the  Judges  had  to  come  to  Hulftsdorp  from  Fort.  Incidentally,  that  too"
"happened in the month of September in the year 1804 on 24th. It is recorded,"
"that,  on  03rd  October,  when  Wemyss,  the  Commander  of  the  Forces  and"
"Lieutenant Governor of Ceylon appeared, in Court, surrounded by the officers of"
"the  Garrison  and  armed  and  the  ground  around  the  Court  and  the  Parade"
"Ground were filled with soldiers who were talking aloud, the Chief Justice having"
"inquired of Wemyss what was meant by so unusual an assemblage, added that"
"if  it  was  intended  to  intimidate  the  Judges,  not  all  the  guns  at  the  Garrison"
"levelled at their Lordships would have that effect.  The Commander disclaimed"
"such intentions and orders were given forthwith to the soldiers to disperse and"
"keep the peace. The Crier of the Court was directed to proclaim the order that"
"no one was to remain in the Court premises with their swords or bayonets, on"
"which order there was compliance by all including the General and his suite1."
