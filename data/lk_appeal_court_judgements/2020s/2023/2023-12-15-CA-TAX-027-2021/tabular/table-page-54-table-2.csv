"Furthermore, Narotom Singh Bindra in the 12th Edition of his book at page 317"
"“The  first  and  primary  rule  of  construction  is  that  the  intention  of  the"
"legislature must be found in the words used by the legislature itself, if the"
"words used are capable of one construction only, then it would not be"
"open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on"
"the  ground  that  such  hypothetical  construction  is  more  consistent"
"with the alleged object and policy of the Act. The legislature must be"
"deemed to have intended what it has said. It is no part of the duty of the"
"court to presume that the legislature meant something other than what is"
"said. If the words of the section are plain and unambiguous, then there"
"is no question of interpretation or construction. The duty of the court"
"then is to implement those provisions with no hesitation.”"
