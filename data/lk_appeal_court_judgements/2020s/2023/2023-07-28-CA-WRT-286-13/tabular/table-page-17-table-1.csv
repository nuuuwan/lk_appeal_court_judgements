"P6  issued  in  2009, only  in  the  year  2011  by  their  letter  marked  as  X2(j).  It  is  also  pertinent to"
"observe that even in this letter, the trade union has failed to mention that the previous Circular P5"
"where the retirement age was increased was made as a result of their agitation or negotiations and"
"was done with the consent of the employer and the employee."
"As stated earlier in this judgment, we find there is no documentary evidence to demonstrate either"
"the trade unions or the 4th Respondent had objected to Circular P6 when it was issued.  What is"
"available is the evidence of the secretary to the trade union which only demonstrates that even the"
"trade union had objected to the said P6 only after two years, hence the Petitioner’s argument that"
"the terms of the Circular were accepted and acquiesced up until the objection two years later."

"employment marked as X2(a), his retirement age is specifically stipulated as 55 years.  The said"
"letter states as follows,"
"“Your employment if not terminated earlier, shall, ipso facto ceases upon your reaching the age"
"of retirement which shall be 55 years.”"
