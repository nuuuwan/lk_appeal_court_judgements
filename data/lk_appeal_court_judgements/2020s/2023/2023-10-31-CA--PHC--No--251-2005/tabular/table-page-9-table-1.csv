"After the filing of the objections by the Party of the Second Party Respondents, both parties"
"filed their respective Written Submissions and thereafter the learned Provincial High Court"
"Judge delivered the Order on 14.10.2015 upholding the Order of the learned Magistrate and"
"dismissing the Revision Application of the Complainant of the First Part-Petitioner."
"Consequently, the Complainant of the First Part Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to"
"as the Appellants] had preferred an Appeal to the Court of Appeal seeking to set aside the"
"Order made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 14.10.2005 and the Order of"
"the learned Primary Court Judge dated 27.08.2002."
"It is noteworthy that the learned High Court Judge in his Order analysed and evaluated the"
"evidence placed before  the learned Magistrate and had come  to the  findings that the  two"
"perch  land  in  question  had  been  possessed  and  used  in  common  by  all  parties.  Thus,  the"
"Appellant  had  not  been  in  exclusive  possession  of  the  land  in  question.  Furthermore,  the"
"Appellants have not possessed it to the exclusion of the others, and nor have they derived any"
"right in terms of section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act."
"The  learned  Provincial  High  Court  Judge  has  essentially  confirmed  the  reasoning  of  the"
"learned Magistrate and affirmed the Order, which concluded that all parties are entitled to"
"common possession of the two perch disputed land until the matter is decided by a competent"
"court."
"Hence,  if  the  Appellants  have  the  legal  right  to  claim  the  two  perch  land,  the  Appellants"
"should have  instituted action in a  Civil Court to determine  their rights, nevertheless, they"
"have not taken any interest in civil litigation. Thus, it can be presumed that the Appellants"
"are trying to grab the portion of land in dispute to their land which is 18.8 perches in extent.,"
"making use of the provisions of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
