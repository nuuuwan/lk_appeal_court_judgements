"Magistrate has only considered one limb in arriving at the current determination,"
"both the orders are considered to be erroneous and contrary to law, by this Court"
"as it is observed that the second limb of the criterion under Section 3A of the Act,"
"which is the requisite of lack of knowledge, is sufficiently established as revealed"
"by  the  facts  of  the  case  and  as  such  the  order  of  the  confiscation  cannot  be"
"affirmed."
"Thus, it is the view of this Court that as the learned Magistrate and the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  had  erred  in  the  orders  dated  25.08.2017  and  23.03.2021"
"respectively, the appeal by the appellant to have both the orders set aside can be"
"allowed. Therefore, this Court intervenes to set aside the order of the High Court"
"dated 23.03.2021 and the order of the Magistrate Court dated 25.08.2017."
"The appeal is hereby allowed."
