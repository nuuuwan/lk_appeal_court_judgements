"bring it about. Upon each of the isolated acts a conjectural interpretation is put, and from"
"the aggregate of these interpretations an inference is drawn.”"

"Indeed, while the  2nd  Accused did  introduce  the  donor, the  1st  Accused,  and  the"
"individual impersonating PW4 to PW6 during the preparation of the deeds, it was in fact"
"the 1st Accused who brought forth the impersonator of PW4 and Lilian Victoria De Silva"
"Amarasekara Jayawardena. This raises questions about the extent of the 2nd Accused's"
"knowledge concerning the fictitious nature of these individuals. The additional point of"
"contention  is  whether  a  prudent  person,  knowing  that  these  documents  were  forged,"
"would retain the property or dispose of it immediately. This issue has not been adequately"
"addressed,  as 
the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  did  not  venture 
into 
this  matter."
"Furthermore, it is apparent that the prosecution has failed to prove the essential elements"
"of the charges brought against the 2nd Accused under Section 454 of the Penal Code."
"The subsequent matter under scrutiny pertains to the authenticity of the impugned"
"deeds. Given that the Donor was fictitious and the attesting witness was impersonated,"
"there  exists  a  question  of  whether  the  2nd  Accused  could  be  legally  convicted  for  this"

"part  of  a document  or makes  any mark  denoting  the  execution  of  a document  with  the"
"intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of a document was made,"
"signed,  sealed,  or  executed,  by  or  by  the  authority  of  a  person  by  whom  or  by  whose"
"authority he knows that is was not made, signed, sealed, or executed, or at a time which"
"he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or executed; or"
"Secondly – Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or"
"otherwise,  alters  a  document  in  any  material  part  thereof,  after  it  has  been  made  or"
"executed either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead"
"at the time of such alteration; or"
"Thirdly  –  Who  dishonestly or fraudulently  causes  any person to sign, seal,  execute,  or"
"alter  a  document,  knowing  that  such  person  by  reason  of  unsoundness  of  mind  or"
