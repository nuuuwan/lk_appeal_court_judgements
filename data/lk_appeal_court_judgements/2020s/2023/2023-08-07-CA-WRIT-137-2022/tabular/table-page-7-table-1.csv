"On perusal of the language spelt out in said Rule 3(1)(a), it clearly implies that submitting an"
"affidavit  together  with  the  petition  in  an  application  made  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  for  the"
"exercise of powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution,"
"is mandatory. Further, it is a vital and mandatory requirement that such affidavit should be"
"in support of the averments of the petition. In view of the said Rule, where a petitioner fails"
"to comply with the provisions of such Rule, the Court has the discretion ex mero motu, to"
"dismiss such application. In light of the above, I hold that the instant Application deserves to"
"be dismissed since the Petitioner has failed to comply with the aforesaid vital Rules."
"Despite such defect in the affidavit, I shall now consider whether this Court should exercise"
"its' inherent powers to assay the matters placed before Court by the Petitioner and that is for"
"the interest of an animal whose feelings cannot be expressed by way of words. In other words,"
"I must consider whether the Petitioner has satisfied this Court with sufficient material in order"
"to establish any grounds of judicial review."
"Upon  an 
inquiry  made  by  Court, 
the  Petitioner  has  categorically 
informed  Court  on"
"19.05.2023 that his claim in the instant Application is based on the documents marked 'X12'"
"to 'X18' (See-journal entry dated 19.05.2023). The document marked 'X12' is an unsigned and"
"undated  statement  of  one  Chandani  Perera.  The  document  marked  'X13'  appears  to  be  an"
"affidavit affirmed by the same person on 15.03.2021. Then again, the document marked ' X14'"
"is  another  unsigned  and  undated  document  by  one  Samantha  Gunasekara  whilst 
the"
"document  marked 
'X15'  is  an  affidavit  affirmed  by  the  said  Samantha  Gunasekara  on"
"16.03.2022. The affidavits marked as 'X16', 'X17' and 'X18' are dated 20.03.2021, 20.02.2022"
"and 25.03.2022 respectively. Significantly, the affidavits 'X15' to 'X18' are affirmed after the"
"date of the affidavit which is annexed to the Petition of the Petitioner. This clearly shows that"
"the  affidavit  submitted  along  with  the  Petition  of  the  Petitioner  cannot  be  considered  as"
"evidence or is in support of the averments of the Petition."
"Moreover, the Venerable Monks and other persons have made statements in the documents"
"marked  'X12'  to  'X18'  based  on  purported  media  (or  social  media)  reports,  telecasted  or"
"published,  alleging  some  kind  of  ill  treatment  to  the  tusker  Myan  Kumara  by  the  4th"
"Respondent whilst none of them are eye witnesses. As opposed to the contents alleged in such"
"documents,  the  Respondents  have  drawn  the  attention  of  this  Court  to  the  report  dated"
