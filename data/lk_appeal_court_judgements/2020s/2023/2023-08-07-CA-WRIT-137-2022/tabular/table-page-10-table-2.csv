"Thero and others vs. Dharmasena Dissanayaka, Chairman - The Public Service Commission and"
"others CA/WRIT/45/2019 decided on 30.03.2023 that;"
"'It is observed that in order to issue a writ of Mandamus, the court must be satisfied of the existence"
"of a public duty owed and an existing legal right in the petitioner to have it performed. Therefore,"
"it will not be available conditionally or for the performance of merely moral duties. The court"
"must take cognisance of the distinction of a duty and a privilege or discretion as a Mandamus"
"exists only where a duty lies. A duty and privilege found in a statue may be distinguished to a"
"large extent by examining the language of the statute'."
