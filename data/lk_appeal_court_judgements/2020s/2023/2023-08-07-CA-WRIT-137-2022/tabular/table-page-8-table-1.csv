"28.03.2021 issued by Dr. Ashoka Dangolla, Professor in Veterinary Clinical Science at the"
"Faculty  of  Veterinary  Medicine  and  Animal  Science  of  the  University  of  Peradeniya,  by"
"which he has certified the well-being of the tusker Myan Kumara after seeing the tusker. He"
"has  issued  another  letter  on  10.09.2022  to  the  same  effect.  Those  documents  are  part  and"
"parcel  of  the  document  marked  '4à·€1'  annexed  to  the  statement  of  objections  of  the  4th"
"Respondent.  Upon  a  direction  by  this  Court,  the  Director  General  of  the  Department  of"
"Wildlife  Conservation  has  tendered  a  Report  by  way  of  a  motion  filed  by  the  Attorney"
"General  on  09.05.2023.  In  the  said  Report  Dr.  G.A.  Tharaka  Prasad  (Director-  Health,"
"Department of Wildlife Conservation), Dr. B.A.D.S. Jayawardana (Wildlife Rehabilitation"
"Center) and Dr. Madusha Perera (Department of National Zoological Gardens) after visiting"
"the premises where the tusker Myan Kumara is currently kept emphasize inter alia, that the"
"tusker has been well looked after by maintaining its' health condition at a satisfactory level."
"The  identity  of  the  tusker  has  been  duly  verified  by  the  doctors  referring  to  the  microchip"
"implanted in the said tusker. The Petitioner has not challenged the eminence or competency"
"of  the  aforesaid  Professor  of  the  University  of  Peradeniya  and  the  other  Veterinarians"
"mentioned above."
"In this backdrop, the evidence tendered to Court by the Respondents in view of establishing"
"the  well-being  and  good  health  condition  of  the  tusker  outweigh  the  purported  evidence"
"submitted by the Petitioner through the documents marked 'X12' to 'X18' which speak about"
"personal opinions of the respective authors of those documents merely based on purported"
"media reports. This kind of insufficient material, although overflowed with personal opinions"
"and recommendations cannot be considered as adequate material for this Court to arrive at a"
"reasonable determination upon the matters referred to Court by the Petitioner. Submitting an"
"affidavit  which  was  affirmed  one  year  before  the  date  of  the  Petition  is  a  cardinal  error"
"committed by the Petitioner and it vitiates the entitlement of the Petitioner to seek relief from"
"this Court based on the circumstances of this case."
"The Petitioner sought permission to display a video of an unsupported media report in open"
"court through an electronic device in addition to a compact disc annexed to the pleadings of"
"the Petitioner. The genesis of the said Rule 3(1)(a) tends to give prominence to the contents"
"of the petition; in other words, it is essential to elaborate the whole claim clearly in writing,"
