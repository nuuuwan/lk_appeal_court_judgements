"behalf of the 4th Respondent. No lawful defence has been taken up by the Petitioner against"
"the assertions of the 4th Respondents on laches, misrepresentations and unclean hands."

"Firstly, a writ of mandamus is sought against the 1st Respondent, directing him to hand over"
"the tusker to the safari park in Ridiyagama or any other suitable place. Having considered the"
