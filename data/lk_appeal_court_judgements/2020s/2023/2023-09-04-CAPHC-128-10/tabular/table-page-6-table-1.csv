"participate at the inquiry but the court shall consider such material as is before it"
"respecting the claims of such party in making its determination and order.”"
"Therefore, it is seen that the court has to consider the evidence of the party who failed to"
"appear before court. Accordingly, court has to analyse the available evidence on behalf of the"
"2nd Party in respect of his claim."
"In this respect, it is relevant to consider the statement made to the Police by the 1st party of"
"the Appellants on 19.02.2009 regarding the dispute. ‘She has stated that she was living in a"
"rented house and only on 16.01.2009, she constructed a temporary house and a well on that"
"land and that she planted plantains, bushes, and coconut trees in January only."
"According to the Police report dated 13.03.2009, in the disputed land, there was a newly"
"built house, a well, a plantain cultivation and coconut trees that were newly planted."
"It is seen that everything in the disputed land was constructed/planted within a short period"
"of time and these facts are closely connected with the affidavit filed by the 1st Party Petitioner-"
"Respondent."
"Furthermore, it was the findings of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge that the 1st Party"
"Petitioner-Respondents  [hereinafter sometimes referred  to  as  the  Respondents]  had  fenced"
"the land and had been cultivating the land as stated in their affidavits dated 20.01.2009. It"
"was further held that the Appellants had constructed the house in the disputed land and thus"
"the Respondents were dispossessed from the peaceful possession of the land in dispute."
"Similarly, with regard to the statement made by the 1st party of the Appellants on 19.01.2009,"
