"In  view  of  the  aforesaid  documentary  evidence,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  Appellant  had"
"entered the land in dispute on 16.02.2009 without the knowledge of the Respondents. The"
"1st party of the Respondents got to know of this on 19.01.2009 and the 2nd party of the"
"Respondents got to know of this on 20.01.2009."
"Therefore,  it  clearly  demonstrates  that  the  Respondents  were  forcibly  dispossessed  by  the"
"Appellant from the disputed premises on or around 19.01.2009."
"Since the said information was filed by the police on 06.03.2009, it clearly shows that the"
"Respondents were forcibly dispossessed from the disputed portion of land by the Appellants"
"within two months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under"
"Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"Thus, the Learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge misdirected himself"
"and had to come to an erroneous conclusion that Appellants are entitled to be in possession"
"of the land in dispute on the basis that two months prior to filing of the information, and at"
"the time of filing of the information =, the Appellants were in possession of the land."
"Since it is evident that the Respondents have established ownership and possession of the land"
"in question based on the material placed before the Magistrate Court, the Learned Magistrate"
"had come to a wrong finding of fact and law by holding against the Respondents."
"Therefore,  I hold that the  Learned Magistrate erred in law  and facts  and held against the"
"Respondent and as such I affirm the order of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge dated"
"04.10.2010 which set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 12.06.2009 and"
"Hence, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 52,500/-."
