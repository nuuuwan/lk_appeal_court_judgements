"In this case the Learned High Court Judge had merely narrated the evidence"
"of  the  prosecution  witnesses  without  giving  any  reason  and  acceptance  of"
"evidence of the prosecution witnesses. Hence, the said judgment cannot be"
"considered as a valid judgment. As there is no proper judgment passed in"
"this case, I therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the"
"Appellant."
"Now, I consider whether this an appropriate case to send for a re-trial."
"In this case the only evidence available against the Appellant is the purported"
"statement of Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance. There is no any other"
"evidence  led  by  the  prosecution.  Under  these  circumstances  sending  this"
"case for re-trial will not serve any purpose."
"Therefore, I acquit the Appellant from the charges levelled against him."
"The Appeal is, therefore allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Vavuniya along with the original case record."
