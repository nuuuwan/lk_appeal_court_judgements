"conclusion  that  the  discretionary  revisionary  jurisdiction  must  not  be  exercised  in"
"favour of the Accused."
"As observed by his Lordship Sharvananda C.J.  Sudharman (supra) at p. 14,"
"“Contumacious conduct on the part of the applicant is a relevant consideration when"
"the exercise of a discretion in his favour is involved”. Citing this dictum, his Lordship"
"Janak De Silva J. in Rankothpedige Harindra Prasad v. Attorney General CA PHC"
"APN 81/2015 CA Minutes 26.01.2018 concluded (at p. 6), “… the Accused, who by his"
"contumacious  conduct  placed  himself  beyond  the  reach  of  the  law  in  treating  the"
"original courts and their authority with contempt, should not be allowed to invoke"
"the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.”"
"Additionally,  our  conclusion  is  buttressed  by  the  absence  of  any  exceptional"
"circumstances  pleaded,  which  is  the  threshold  requirement  for  this  discretionary"
"jurisdiction to be invoked."
"We, therefore, uphold the preliminary objection raised by the learned Counsel"
"for the Respondent. This appeal is dismissed."
