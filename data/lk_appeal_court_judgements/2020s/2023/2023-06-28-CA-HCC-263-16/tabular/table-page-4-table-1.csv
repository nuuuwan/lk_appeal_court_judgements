"To support his stance that the Accused is entitled to an unconditional right of"
"appeal the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner strongly relied on several"
"judgments of the Supreme Court which expound the sanctity of the right of appeal."
"One  of  which  is  the  notable  judgment  of  Sudharman  v.  Attorney  General  [1986] 1"
"SLR  9.  In  the  said  judgment  his  Lordship  Sharvananda  C.J.  contended  that  an"
"Accused is not estopped by his contumacious conduct from invoking  the statutorily"
"conferred right to appeal against a sentence and conviction. In what appears to be an"
"interesting exchange with the Counsel for the Respondent their Lordships had posed"
"the  question,  “what  was  the  distinct  advantage  which  an  absconding  accused  had"
"over persons who respected the law and presented themselves for trial”. In response"
"to which, their Lordships observed, “he [Counsel for the Respondent] was hard put to"
"demonstrate such advantage. He had to concede that, on the other hand, an accused"
"who presents himself for trial will definitely be at an advantage in that he will be"
"able  to  cross-examine  prosecution  witnesses  and  himself  give  evidence  and  call"
"witnesses in his support.”"
