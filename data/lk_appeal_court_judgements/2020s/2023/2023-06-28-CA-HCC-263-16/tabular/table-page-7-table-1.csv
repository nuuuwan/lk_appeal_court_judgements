"whether an Accused seeks to reopen proceedings in terms of Section 241(3) is their"
"choice. If the Accused does not opt to do so, there is nothing preventing the Accused"
"from directly appealing the substantive conviction as well, as clearly opined in the"
"aforementioned judgment of Sudharman (provided, however, that the appeal is filed"
"on time)."
