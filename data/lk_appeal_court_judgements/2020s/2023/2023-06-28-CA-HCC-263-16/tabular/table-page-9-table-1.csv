"“[Section 4(2)] states that every person convicted of a criminal offence under"
"any  written  law  shall  have  the  right  to  appeal  to  a  Higher  Court  against  such"
"conviction any sentence imposed and therefore as of right a convicted person has a"
"right to have that conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher forum. Perhaps some"
"irregularity  in  procedure  may  deprive  the  Appellants  of  the  opportunity  to  file  his"
"appeal  within  the  time  prescribed  by  law.  But  the  right  to  review  is  a  recognised"
"substantive right.”"
