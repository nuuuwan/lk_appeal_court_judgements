"Held Further;"
"“An  order  of  confiscation  is  in  fact  a  punishment  which  is  imposed  in"
"addition to the ordinary punishment imposed on the offender. However, if"
"the vehicle used in the commission of the offence belongs to a third party,"
"it  is  confiscated  only  after  the  third  party  is  afforded  an  opportunity  of"
"being heard."
"The  confiscation  of  the  vehicle  has  to  be  based  on  a  conviction  which  is"
"acceptable in law. If there is no conviction, then there is no confiscation. In"
"other  words,  a  valid  conviction  is  a  condition  precedent  to  proceed  to  call"
"upon the owner of the vehicle, if he is not the offender, to explain himself.”"
