"“It  has  to  bone  in  mind  that  an  order  of  confiscation  of  property  whether"
"movable  or  immovable  leads  to  deprivation  of  property  rights  of  a  citizen."
"Inasmuch as the Court has to approach the issue relating to the liberty of"
"the subject by giving a strict interpretation of the provisions of the law and"
"the same approach has to be aimed at resolving the issues relating to the"
"legality of the confiscation orders as well, since the confiscatory provisions"
"in any enactment though it may not be strictly called a draconian measure,"
"yet it has such a draconian flavour.”"
