"necessity of framing a charge by a Magistrate, held;"
"“Thus,  it  would  be  seen  that  farming  of  a  charge  to  give  validity  to  a"
"criminal prosecution or subsequent conviction is absolutely indispensable."
"The  absence  of  a  charge 
is  fatal 
to 
the  validity  of  the 
trial  and 
the"
"conviction  as  well.  This  principle  has  been  exhaustively  discussed 
in"
"Abdul  Sameem  Vs.  The  Bribery  Commissioner  (1991)  1  SLR  76  in"
"reference 
to  a 
long 
line  of  decided  authorities 
including  a 
full  bench"
"decision.”"
