"unloading charges at the Port of Colombo do not form a part of the Customs"
"Value.  Therefore,  the  declaration  in  the  CUSDEC  and  the  VDF  regarding  the"
"terms of payment cannot make any difference in the customs value. It can be a"
"relevant factor only in a situation where the unloading charges in the Port of"
"Colombo  should  be  included  in  the  customs  value.  Therefore,  no  order  for"
"forfeiture  can  be 
imposed  against  the  Petitioner  under  Section  52  of  the"
"Customs Ordinance on an allegation that the Petitioner had declared incorrect"
"payment  terms  as  the  correct  value  had  been  declared  in  accordance  with"
"Schedule E. Therefore, the finding of the 1st Defendant to the effect that the"
"Petitioner  Company  had  defrauded  government  revenue  by  declaring  the"
"contract was CIF is ultra vires the provisions of the Customs Ordinance, contrary"
"to Schedule E of the Customs Ordinance and unlawful."
"The relationship between the parties"
"Article 1 (2) of Schedule E of the Customs Ordinance reads as follows;"
"â€œ2  (a) 
In  determining  whether  the  transaction  value 
is  acceptable  for  the"
"purpose of paragraph 1, the fact that the buyer and the seller are related within"
"the meaning of Article 9 shall not in itself be ground for regarding the transaction"
"value as unacceptable. In such case the circumstances surrounding the sale shall"
"be  examined  and  the  transaction  value  shall  be  accepted  provided  that  the"
"relationship did not influence the price. If in the light of information provided by"
"the 
importer  or  otherwise, 
the  Customs  Administration  has  grounds 
for"
"considering that the relationship influenced the price. It shall communicate its"
"grounds 
to 
the 
importer  and 
the 
importer  shall  be  given  a 
reasonable"
"opportunity to respond. If the importer so requests, the communication of the"
"grounds shall be writing."
"(b) In a sale between related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted"
"and  the  goods  valued 
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  paragraph  1"
"whenever the importer demonstrates that such value closely approximates to"
"one of the following occurring at or about the same time: -"
"(i) the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical or similar goods"
"for export to Sri Lanka:"
"(ii)  the  customs  value  of  identical  or  similar  goods  as  determined  under  the"
"provisions of Article 5:"
