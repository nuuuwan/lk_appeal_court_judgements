"CA BAIL  16-2023"
"The  Counsel 
for 
the  Petitioner  urged 
this  Court 
to  consider 
that"
"detaining  a  suspect  without  any  legal  action  for  an  extended  period  of"
"time  amounts  to  a  violation  of  his  fundamental  rights  which  can  be"
"considered as an exceptional ground."
"The Learned State Counsel has submitted that the investigation dossier"
"has not been received so far from the Police Narcotics Bureau."
"The  Government  Analyst  Report  pertaining 
to 
this  case  has  been"
"received by the Magistrate Court of Moratuwa on 22.12.2020. Although"
"more  than  one  and  half  years  have  passed  since  the  receipt  of  the"
"Government Analyst Report by the Court, the investigation agency has"
"failed  to  submit  the  relevant 
investigation  dossier  to  Hon.  Attorney"
"General to consider charges against the Suspect."
"Due to inordinate delay in submitting the investigation notes pertaining"
"to  this  case  to  Hon.  Attorney  General,  justice  has  been  denied  to  the"
"Suspect. The legal maxim portrait that justice delayed is justice denied."
"Although  all 
the  steps  are 
important 
in  criminal  cases,  sending"
"investigation  notes  to  prosecuting  authority  is  more  important  among"
"others.  Hence, 
in  a  case  of  this  nature  or 
in  all  cases  where  the"
"investigation  is  over,  the  prosecuting  authority  should  use  their  power"
"in the interest of public, to get down all necessary information to decide"
"whether  a  prima  facie  case  could  be  made  out  against  a  suspect  who"
"has  been 
in  remand 
for  a  considerable  period  of  time.  Further, 
I"
"consider 
it 
is  appropriate 
to 
call 
for 
explanation 
from 
the 
law"
"enforcement 
agencies 
for 
unreasonable 
delay 
in 
forwarding"
"investigation  notes  to  the  prosecuting  authority.  Otherwise,  the  people"
"will lose trust on the system."
"The 
Learned  Magistrate 
of  Moratuwa  has 
rightly 
called 
for 
an"
"explanation  from  the  Senior  Superintendent  of  Police,  under  whose"
"supervision  the  Mount  Lavinia  Police  Station  is  coming.  Although  the"
"Mount  Lavinia  Police  has  reported 
in  writing  to  the  Magistrate  on"
"22.06.2022 that the relevant investigation noted had been dispatched"
