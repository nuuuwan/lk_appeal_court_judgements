"With the above dictum in mind, we hold that the particular contradiction does not"
"go to the root of the matter. We cannot hold the contradictions are vital enough to assail"

"The  final  ground  raised  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Accused  was  that  the"
"learned High Court Judge failed to consider the dock statement of the Accused and the"

"have to consider the evidentiary value of a dock statement."
