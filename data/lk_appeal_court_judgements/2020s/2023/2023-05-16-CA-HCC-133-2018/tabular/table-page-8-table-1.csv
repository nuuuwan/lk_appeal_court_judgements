"When assessing the above discrepancies, it is important to understand the context."
"According to Prosecution’s evidence, PW1 is the officer who received the information from"
"PW4, got authorization from his superiors, put together the team and organized the raid."
"In getting to Babar Street, PW1 is led by the informant and it is only on PW1’s orders"
"PW2 joined the party. All these factors are relevant in understanding that PW1 had more"
"reasons to be attentive. When following someone along as opposed to leading the party,"
"naturally  the  person  is  bound  to  pay  less  attention.  This  is  likely  to  result  in  a  blurry"
"version of the events years later when the person gives evidence (Over four years later, in"
"this matter)."
"Another factor to keep in mind is that both PW1 and PW2 are officers of STF which"
"is a specialized unit in its own regard, but one that does not deal especially with the likes"
"of drug cases. On the other hand, considering considerable time has lapsed since the raid,"
"if the two witnesses’ evidence  is matching to the smallest detail, the Court would have"
"more of a reason to be suspicious of the Prosecutions’ version and its truthfulness."
"In this light, it is worth referring to the dictum in State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K."
"Anthony 1984 (2) SCJ 236. This was adopted by his Lordship Ranjit Silva J. in Nanediri"
