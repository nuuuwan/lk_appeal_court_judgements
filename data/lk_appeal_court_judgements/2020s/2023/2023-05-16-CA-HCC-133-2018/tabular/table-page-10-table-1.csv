"Bearing  this  in  mind,  this  Court  will  consider  how  the  Learned  Trial  Judge"
"evaluated  the  dock  statement  and  the  evidence  of  the  Defence.  The  Defence  version  is"
"built on the notion that the Accused came to Babar Street to receive money on behalf of a"
"friend. But as the Learned Trial Judge points out, there is no mention as to who this friend"
"is,  which  would  be  a  vital  detail  in  their  version.  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  further"
"addressed the failure of the Defence to address or even acknowledge vital issues from the"
"arrest to the production. He further points to a few instances where details in the cross-"
"examination are absent from the dock statement. Statements of such vague nature do not"
"invoke confidence in the Accused. In his delivery, the Accused himself appears to seem"
"uncertain of his story."
