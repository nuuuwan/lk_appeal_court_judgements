"For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the provisions of section 6"
"[which sets out the lighter punishment] shall not apply in respect of an offence which was"
"committed prior to the date of coming into operation of this Act.  [emphasis added]"
"As  the  legislative  intention  is  manifested  in  clear  and  unequivocal  terms,  to"
"disregard  it  in  the  interests  of  justice  would  be  to  enter  murky  constitutional  waters."
"Therefore,  regrettably,  this  Court  has  no  authority  to  confer  the  benefit  of  the  lesser"
"sentence upon the Accused."
"This  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Accused  are"
"without merit. We see no reason to interfere with the judgement dated 12th September"
"2018.  The  conviction  and  the  sentence  are  affirmed  and  the  appeal  is  accordingly"
"dismissed."
