"entitled to a servitudanal right over the subject matter and possession of the same was handed"
"over to the 1st Party."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order  the  2nd  Party  –  1st  and  2nd  Petitioners  had  invoked  the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial high Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle."
"The learned High Court Judge having inquired the matter before him, and affirmed the order of"
"the learned Magistrate."
"Thereafter, the 2nd Party – 1st and 2nd Party Petitioners being aggrieved by the order of the learned"
"High Court judge had preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal seeking relief prayed in the"
"prayer of the Petition of Appeal."
"It is observable in the prayer to the Petition of Appeal, that the 2nd Party-1st and 2nd Petitioner-"
"Appellants (herein after referred to as the Appellants) had prayed only to revise or set aside the"
"order of the Learned Magistrate and not sought to set aside or revise the order of the learned"
"High Court Judge against which this appeal was preferred."
"Be that as it may, the facts of the instant case is as follows;"
"The dispute between the Parties is relating to a right of way claimed by the Appellants over a"
"land belonging to the 1st Party-1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondents."
"Therefore, it appears that the dispute affecting the subject matter comes within the purview of"
"section 75(d) of the said Act (reproduced below)."
"Section 75(d): In this Part ” dispute affecting land ” includes any dispute as to the right to the"
"possession of any land or part of a land and the buildings thereon or the boundaries thereof or"
"as to the right to cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the right to the crops or produce of"
"any land, or part of a land, or as to any right in the nature of a servitude affecting the land and"
"any reference to ” land” in this Part includes a reference to any building standing thereon."
"Thus, it is the burden of the Appellants to prove that they have a right to use the disputed pathway"
"in the nature of servitude."
"It was submitted on behalf of the Appellants that the Appellants enjoyed the disputed pathway"
"from 1990 – 1999 and the only access road to their land lies over the land belonging to the"
"Respondent."
