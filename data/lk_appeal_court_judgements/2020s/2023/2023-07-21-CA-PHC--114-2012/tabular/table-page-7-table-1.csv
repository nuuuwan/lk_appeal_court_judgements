"Hence, I hold that the learned Magistrate had misled himself and had not come to a correct finding"
"of fact and law. Thus, the learned Magistrate had erred in law and  thereby held against the 2nd"
"Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant."
"In view of the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the order dated 13.07.2010 of the learned Magistrate"
"and  hold  that  the  2nd  Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant  is  entitled  to  use  the  impugned"
"pathway to access the land occupied by the Appellants."
"The  learned  Provincial  High  Court  judge  affirmed  the  findings  of  the  learned  Magistrate  and"
"dismissed the revision application on the ground that no exceptional grounds exist to revise the"
"order of the learned Magistrate since we hold that the learned Magistrate had come to an erroneous"
"conclusion and held against the 2nd Party-1st and 2nd Petitioner-Appellants, we set aside the order"
"made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 13.6.2012 as well."
"Therefore, we allow the appeal of the 2nd Party-1st and 2nd Petitioner-Appellants and order the cost"
"to be paid by the Respondents."
