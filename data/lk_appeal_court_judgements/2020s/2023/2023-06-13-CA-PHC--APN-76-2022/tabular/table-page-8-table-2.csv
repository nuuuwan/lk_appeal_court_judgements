"Dr.A.R.B.Amerasinghe  in  his  book  titled  “Judicial  Conduct,  Ethics"
"and Responsibilities” at page 284 observes that:"
"“However,  Article  13(5)  of  our  Constitution  states  that  every  person"
"shall  be  presumed  innocent  until  he  is  proved  guilty.  Article  13(2)"
"further provides that a person shall not be deprived of personal liberty"
"except upon and in terms of the order of a judge made in accordance"
"with procedure established by law."
"The State imposes a punishment on the suspect indirectly by keeping"
"him in remand custody for an uncertain period. Obviously, that was"
"not the intention of the legislature when it enacted Article 13(5) of the"
"Constitution”."
