"serious  offences  but  seriousness  of  the  offence  alone  cannot  form  a"
"ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must bear"
"in mind the presumption of innocence."
"Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail"
"is  primarily  at  the  discretion  of  the  Courts.  The  discretion  should  be"
"exercised  with  due care  and  caution  taking  into  account  the  facts  and"
"circumstances of each case."
"Considering the above factors, this court has come to a conclusion that"
"the  Petitioner  has  established  exceptional  grounds  for  the  granting  of"
"bail. Hence, the Petitioner is granted bail with following condition."
