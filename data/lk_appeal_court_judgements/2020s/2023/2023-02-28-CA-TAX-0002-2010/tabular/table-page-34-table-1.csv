"Judgment of the Supreme Court in Ceylon Financial Investments Limited"
"V. Commissioner of Income Tax (CFI Case)"
"[81] I will now turn to the CFI judgment.  The facts of the CFI judgment reveal"
"that the assessee company was an investment company and its object was to"
"invest  money 
in  shares 
in  other  companies. 
Its 
income  was  derived  from"
"dividends  declared  by  companies  in  which  it  owned  shares,  and  interest  on"
"moneys  lent  out  by  it.  The  company  did  not  carry  on  any  trade  and  claimed"
"deductions  from  outgoings  and  expenses  in  the  production  of  the  profits  or"
"income within the meaning of section 9(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance (Chapter"
"188) (corresponding to section 25(1) of the IRA 2006)."
"[82]  In  the  said  case,  the  assessee  argued  that  the  interest  income  should  be"
"treated  as  a  source  under  section  6(1)(a)  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance  1932"
"(corresponding to section 3(a) of the IRA 2006), and the assessor in disallowing"
"the management expenses claimed drew a distinction between an investment"
"company and a company which carried on a trade or commercial enterprise. The"
"assessor  stated,  however,  that  (i)  an  investment  company  does  not  incur  any"
"expense in the production of income, and once the investment was made, no"
