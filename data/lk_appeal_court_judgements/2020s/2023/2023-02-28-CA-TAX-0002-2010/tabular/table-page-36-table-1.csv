"[84]  The  first  question  that  was  considered  by  the  judges  in  the  CFI  case  was"
"whether the income derived by the company from dividends and interest was a"
"source  under  section  6(1)(a)  or  section  6(1)(e)  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,"
"1932,  which  corresponds  to  section  3(a)  and  3(e)  of  the  IRA,  No.  10  of  2006"
"respectively."
"[85] The argument of the Appellant in that case was that income should have"
"been  assessed  under  section  6(1)(a)  of  the  Ordinance  as  a  business  and"
"therefore, such expenses should have been allowed under section 9(1) (current"
"section 25(1) of the IRA 2006) as “all outgoings and expenses incurred by such"
"person in the production thereof. The Crown argued that the profits or income"
"of the assessee came exclusively under section 6(1)(e) (current section 3(e) of the"
"IRA)  and  could  not  be  regarded  as  the  profits  and  income  of  a  business."
"Alternatively, the Crown argued that if the profits and income came under both"
"under section 6(1)(a) and under section 6(1)(e), the Crown had an option as to"
"the sub-section under which the tax could be charged."
"[86] It may be noted that section 9(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, which relates"
"to the deductions allowed in ascertaining profits or income, is identical to section"
"25(1) of the IRA. It reads as follows:"
"“(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2), and (3), there shall be deducted,"
"for the purpose of ascertaining the profits of income of any person from any"
"source, all outgoings and expenses incurred by such person in the production"
"thereof….”-"
"[87] Section 9(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance is identical to section 25(4) of the"
"IRA 2006 and it reads as follows:"
"“(3) Subject as hereinafter provided, Income arising from interest shall be the"
"full amount of interest falling due, whether paid or not, without any deduction"
"for outgoings or expenses:”"
