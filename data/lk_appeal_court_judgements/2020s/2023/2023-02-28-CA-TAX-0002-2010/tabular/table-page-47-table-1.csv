"business of a commercial airline providing international air transportation and"
"related services."
"[121]  The  Appellant  has  operated  an 
interest-bearing  bank  account 
for"
"depositing its working capital  money in the bank to earn a  higher   interest"
"income  from  such  short  term  call  deposits,  which  is  not  connected  with  or"
"related 
to 
its  business  of  commercial  airline  providing 
international  air"
"transportation  and 
related  services.  The 
interest 
income  earned  by 
the"
"Appellant from an interest bearing account is a separate source of income not"
"connected  with  the  profits  and  income  earned  by  the  Enterprise  from  its"
"business for which the tax exemption has been granted by the BOI."
"[122] In my view, to sustain the submission of the Appellant, and obtain the"
"benefit  of 
the  exemption, 
it  was 
just  not  sufficient 
that  a  commercial"
"connection  was  established  between  the  profits  earned  from  short  term"
"deposits and its business of air transportation. In my view  the business of air"
"transportation itself had to be the source of the profit or income derived from"
"short  term  deposits  and  the  business  had  the  direct  source  of  the  interest"
"income earned from such short term deposits and not a means to earn any"
"other  profit.  The  interest  income  received  from  short  term  call  deposits  has"
"been  derived  from  a  different  source  under  section  3(e)  and  thus  it  can  be"
"clearly  separated 
from 
the  business  of  commercial  airline  providing  air"
"transportation  and  ancillary  or  related  services.  In  my  view,  such    interest"
"income    cannot  be  categorized  as  business  income  of  the  Appellant  under"
"section 3(1)."
"[123]  the other hand, the  interest from short term deposits received by the"
"Appellant  is  not  the  direct  result  of  any  business  of  the  commercial  airline"
"providing  air  transportation  though  it  can  be  attributed  to  a  commercial"
"connection, and hence, it cannot be treated, in the absence of direct evidence"
"including the entries made in the statement of accounts  as income which is"
"derived  from  the  business  income  of  the  Appellant.  The  mere  statement"
"without  proof 
that 
the 
interest 
income  was  used 
for  working  capital"
"requirement is not sufficient to categorise such income as part of the business"
"income  to  which  the  tax  exemption  was  conferred  under  clause  8(1)  of  the"
"Agreement."
"[124] The Appellantâ€™s contention was that its short term interest income earned"
"was  used  for  its  working  capital  requirements  and,  therefore,  such  interest"
