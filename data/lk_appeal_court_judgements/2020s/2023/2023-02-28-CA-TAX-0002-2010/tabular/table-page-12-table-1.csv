"“The effect of section 6(3) is that in the absence of any express provision, the"
"repeal by itself does not affect the past operation or any right acquired under"
"the law that is being repealed. However,, by an express provision the past"
"operation of the law that is being repealed could be denuded of any effect"
"so  that  any  right  acquired  thereunder  would  be  of  no  force  or  avail."
"Additional Solicitor General submitted that what is sought to be done by the"
"present  amendment  is  to  restore  the  status  quo  ante  so  that  any  liability"
"operative prior to the grant of the amnesty or immunity under Act, No. 10"
"of 2003 is fully revived."
"We are of the opinion that in terms of  Article 75 of the Constitution read"
"with section 6 (3) of the Interpretation ordinance, it is within the legislative"
"competence of parliament to make provision for the revival of any liability,"
"duty or obligation that was operative under the relevant laws, and thereby"
"remove the legal effect of any concession, indemnity or immunity granted"
"under Act, No. 10 of 2003, as amended, provided that the revival of such"
"liability,  duty  or  obligation  would  in  itself  not  be  inconsistent  with  the"
"Constitution”."
