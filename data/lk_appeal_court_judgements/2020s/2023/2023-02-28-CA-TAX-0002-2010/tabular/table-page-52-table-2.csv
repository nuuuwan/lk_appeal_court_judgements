"UNDER THE Act as the tax exemption does not apply to that year. His Lordship"
"Surasena, J. held at page 16:"
"“These  facts  clearly  show  that  the  year  of  assessment  1998/1999  is  not"
"qualified to be a year of tax exemption as it has not met any of the two"
"requirements set out above. Therefore, the year of assessment 1998/1999"
"is not within the tax exemption period determined by the BOI. Thus, any"
"profit that may have been made during that year becomes assessable under"
"the Act as the tax exemption does not apply to that year. Therefore, any"
"loss  that  the  Respondent  had  incurred  in  the  year  1998/1999  could  be"
"deducted from the total statutory income as that amount of the loss could"
"bhave been assessable under the Act if it had been a profit”."
