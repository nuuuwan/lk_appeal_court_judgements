"[37] Now the question is whether or not the BOR had made its determination"
"within a period of 2 years from the date of the commencement of the hearing"
"of such appeals. The appeal for the period 1994/1995 was made on 25.05.1998"
"and the appeal for the period 1995/1996 was made on 23.03.1999. The appeals"
"were 
referred 
to 
the  BOR  by 
the  Respondent  on  08.06.2001  and 
the"
"determination  was  made  by  the  BOR  on  28.10.2009.  As  the  first  proviso  to"
"section 140(10) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 as amended by the"
"Inland  Revenue 
(Amendment)  Act,  No.  37  of  2003  came 
into  effect  on"
"01.04.2003 after the appeals were referred to BOR but before the determination"
"was made, the BOR should have made the determination within two years from"
"the date of commencement of the hearing of such appeal. The question is as to"
"when the hearing commenced."
"[38]  The  Court  of  Appeal  in  Mohideen  v.  Commissioner  -General  of  Inland"
"Revenue (supra) considered the question of the actual date of hearing intended"
"by Parliament in the second proviso to Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No.  37  of  2003,  for  the  purpose  of  the  time  limit  of  the"
"appeal. The Court of Appeal  held that the hearing means the “date of the actual"
"oral hearing” and the BOR made its determination within 2 years from the date"
"of the oral hearing, and thus, it is not time barred. His Lordship Gooneratne J."
"having considered the question involved (Question No. 2 in that case), held with"
"the Respondent on the basis that the hearing for the  calculation of the time"
"limit of 2 years specified in section 140 (10) commences ‘from the date of the"
"oral hearing’ and ‘not from the date of filing of the petition of appeal’. I have"
"no  reason  to  deviate  from  the  view  taken  by  Gooneratne,  J.  in  Mohideen  v."
"Commissioner-General  of 
Inland  Revenue 
(supra). 
I  hold 
that  when 
the"
"legislation provides that when the BOR shall hear all appeals received by it and"
"make its determination, “within two years from the date of commencement of"
"the  hearing  of  such  appeal”,  the  hearing  commences  from  the  date  of  oral"
"hearing. In the present case, the oral hearing  commenced on 08.06.2008 and"
"the determination was made on 28.10.2009."
"[39] On the other hand, this Court has consistently taken the view that the word"
"""shall” used in section 10 of the TAX Appeals Commission Act, No. 10 of 23 of"
"2001 
is  normally  to  be 
interpreted  as  connoting  a  directory,  and  not  a"
"mandatory provision. In Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax CA /Tax/17/2017, decided on 15.03.2019),"
"Janak de Silva, J.held that the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.  23 of 2011 (as"
