"[22] It is obvious that by virtue of the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act,"
"No.  10  of  2003,  the  proceedings  before  the  BOR  were  discontinued  and  the"
"Appellant  was  benefiting  from  that  law.  The  Inland  Revenue  (Regulation  of"
"Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004 was enacted inter alia, to repeal the said Act and"
"to revive or restore or continue with the proceedings, investigation or inquiry"
"which were stopped, suspended or withdrawn. The provisions of section 4(4) of"
"the  Inland  Revenue  (Regulation  of  Amnesty)  Act,  No.  10  of  2004  does  not"
"indicate that the intention of the legislature was to revive or restore or continue"
"with proceedings or investigation or inquiry which were being conducted only"
"by  the  Commissioner  General  or  any  other  authority  empowered  to  recover"
"taxes, but exclude proceedings which were discontinued on the basis of section"
"4(3) of the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003. In my view,"
"the  Inland  Revenue  (Regulation  of  Amnesty)  Act,  No.  10  of  2004  revived  or"
"restored the proceedings which were discontinued before the BOR on the basis"
"of section 4(3) of the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003,"
"and therefore, the assessments under appeal were not final and conclusive in"
"terms of section 4(3) of the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of"
"2003."
"[23]  Though  the  Appellant  has  not  made  an  application  seeking  an  amnesty"
"under the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003 and an appeal"
"had  been  made  against  the  assessments,  the    Commissioner  General  or  any"
"authority charged with the administration of the laws specified in the schedule"
"thereto, are obliged to comply with the provisions of the said Act. Accordingly,"
"the Appellant who was benefiting from the provisions of the Act, No. 10 of 2003"
"cannot be heard to say that the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act,"
"No. 10 of 2004 did not apply to the Appellant and any proceeding which has"
"been, stopped, suspended or withdrawn in terms of the Inland Revenue (Special"
"Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003, cannot be revived or restored and continued"
"with, in terms of the provisions of the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty)"
"Act, No. 10 of 2004."
"[24] The Appellant further contended that  the Inland Revenue (Regulation of"
"Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004 cannot apply to the Appellant as the Appellant"
"did  not  make  any  application  seeking  amnesty  under  the  Inland  Revenue"
"(Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.  10  of  2003  in  respect  of  non-payment  or  non-"
"disclosure  of  liability  by  making  a  statutory  declaration  for  the  purpose.  The"
"Appellant relies on section 6(3) of the Interpretation Ordinance, No. 21 of 1901"
