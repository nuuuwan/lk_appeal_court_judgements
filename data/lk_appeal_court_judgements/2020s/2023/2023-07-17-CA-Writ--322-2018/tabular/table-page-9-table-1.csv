"(3) Where an employee has not been paid the whole or a part of the remuneration required"
"by this Act to be paid to him by his employer, the Commissioner may, if he thinks fit so to"
"do,  by  written  notice  require  the  employer  to  pay  such  amount  or  the  balance  of  such"
"amount 
to 
the  Commissioner  within 
the 
time  specified 
in 
the  notice  so 
that 
the"
"Commissioner may remit it to such employee. Where the employer when served with such"
"notice  pays  such  amount  or  such  balance  directly 
to  such  employees 
instead  of"
"transmitting it to the Commissioner as required by such notice, he shall be deemed not to"
"have paid such amount or such balance to such employee."

(1)  The  Commissioner  of  Labour  shall  be 
the  officer 
in  charge  of 
the  general"
"administration of this Act."
"(2)  Subject  to  any  general  or  special  directions  of  the  Commissioner,  any  Deputy  or"
"Assistant Commissioner of Labour may exercise, perform or discharge any power, duty or"
"function of the Commissioner under this Act or under any regulation."
"The Assistant Commissioner of Labour who is the 2nd respondent of the application has"
"been the entity that has decided and corresponded with the petitioner company at all"
"instances 
regarding 
the  matter  at  hand.  Under  Section  46 
(2) 
the  Assistant"
"Commissioners are duly authorised to perform and discharge powers under the Act and"
"thereby the directives issued by the 2nd respondent are deemed to be legal by this Court."
"Furthermore, upon perusal of the inquiry notes marked R1- R3 it is apparent to this"
"Court  that  the  inquiry  proceedings  of  this  matter  at  the  Commissioner  have  been"
"conducted  duly  without  any  concerning  defects.  Following  such  fair  inquiry  only  the"
"directives marked P14, P16 and P17 are issued. The petitioner has raised concerns and"
"objections regarding the disputed Schedule to P17. As noted above, P17 is the directive"
"with revised the total amount payable, due to the change in the time period considered"
"for  calculation.  P17  further  mentions  that  it  annuls  the  prior  directive  marked  P16."
"According to the affidavit submitted by the 1st respondent all annexures are sent along"
"with P17 in the registered post, however the petitioner denies this. On the other hand,"
"the respondents have failed to submit a copy of such schedule of P17 that they claim to"
"have sent from there end, as well."
"It  is  argued  that  the 1st  Respondent,  who  has  custody  of  the  Schedule,  should  have"
"presented  it  instead  of  claiming  to  have  sent  it  via  registered  post  as  stated  in  their"
