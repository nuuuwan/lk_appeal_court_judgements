"objections. However, it should be noted that the failure to produce this Schedule, which"
"was prepared by the 1st Respondent, should not be considered as a mean to deprive the"
"legal entitlements of the 4-28 respondents. The total amount to be distributed among"
"these respondents is clearly stated in P17 and is documented in the file. However, it is"
"observed  by  this  Court  that  it  is  essential  to  send  a  detailed  schedule  with  amount"
"payable to each respondent employee as the total amount payable is revised. Further,"
"in  the  directive  marked  P17,  the  date  of  P16  is  mentioned  inadvertently  and  the"
"petitioner in his petition mentions this fact. This Court does not intend to be concerned"
"with the faulty date on P17 as it is  a minuscule matter that has not  posed a serious"
"threat to justice and proceed to accept the 1st-3rd respondentsâ€™ submission that it was a"
"typographical error."
"In  the  instant  matter,  it  is  evident  to  this  Court  that  the  respondent  employees  are"
"unquestionably governed by the SOE Act and the Commissioner has correctly decided"
"on the matter directing the petitioner company to pay remunerations for the overtime"
"work  of  the  respondent  employees.  Therefore,  to  effect  the  decision  duly,  this  Court"
"directs  the  respondent  Commissioner  to  re-send  a  copy  of  detailed  schedule  on  the"
"revised  amount  mentioned  in  P17  to  the  petitioner  company  with  detailed  amounts"
"payable to each respondent employee, forthwith."
