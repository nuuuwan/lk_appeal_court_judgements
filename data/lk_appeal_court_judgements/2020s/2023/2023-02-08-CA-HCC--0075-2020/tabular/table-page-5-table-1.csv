"stance  at  the  High  Court  trial.  His  evidence  is  mostly  unchallenged  and"
"accepted by the Appellant."
"According to PW7, the Appellant was handed over to him by PW3 and PW4"
"when he was on his way to the place of incident. He had observed blood on"
"Appellant’s  dress  and  the  broken  knife.  This  witness  had  recovered  the"
"handle  of  the  knife  at  the  place  of  incident.  The  Appellant’s  arrest  and"
"handing over to PW7 is unchallenged and undisputed."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  analysed  this  evidence  in  its  correct"
"perfective and admitted as true evidence."
"According  to  the  medical  evidence  13 
injuries  had  been  noted  on  the"
"deceased’s  body.  According  to  the  doctor  all 
injuries  could  have  been"
"inflicted with the knife which had been recovered from the Appellant at the"
"time of his arrest. The knife was marked as P 2(a) at the trial. According to"
"the  doctor  the  death  has  caused  due  to  haemorrhagic  shock  following  a"
"deep cut injury to the neck with a sharp cutting weapon."
"On  the  date  of  incident,  the  deceased  had  lodged  a  complaint  against  the"
"Appellant regarding a money dispute in the Dehiwala Police Station. PW13"
"had recorded the complaint lodged by the deceased against the Appellant."
"According  to  PW1  a  complaint  receipt  was 
found 
in  the  wallet  of  the"
"deceased."
"With  all  the  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution  and  the  defence,  it"
"appears  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  appropriately  evaluated"
"the  evidence  in  delivering  his  verdict.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"considered the dock statement of the Appellant in the judgment."
"In this case the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses are not tainted"
"with  uncertainty  or  ambiguity  and  it  certainly  passes  the  probability  test."
"As such, the Appellant is not successful in his Appeal grounds."
