"that  the  3rd  accused  appellant  got  involved  in  the  altercation  between  the  1st"
"accused appellant and the deceased at the party."
"Although the learned High Court Judge has determined that the evidence of the"
"PW-01  was  that  when  she  came  out  of  the  room  all  three  accused  appellants"
"were near husband armed with weapons, I view that as a clear misdirection as"
"to the evidence led at the trial. Her evidence had been that when she first saw"
"her husband with bleeding head injuries, it was only the 1st accused appellant"
"near him armed with an iron rod."
"The 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants were outside of the house and clearly,"
"they  had  not  participated  in  the  act  where  the  deceased  received  his  injuries."
"There cannot be any basis to conclude that all of them were together when the"
"attack took place and ran away from the place where the deceased was sleeping"
"as  no  such  evidence  has  been  given  in  this  trial.  The  evidence  of  PW-01  only"
"establishes the presence of the 2nd and 3rd accused appellants, a distance away"
"from the scene of the crime, which only suggests that they may have come along"
"with the 1st accused appellant."
"There  was  no  evidence  before  the  Court  to  suggest  that  there  had  been  a"
"prearrangement among the three accused appellants to cause the death of the"
"deceased. It was only with the 1st accused appellant the previous altercation has"
"occurred, and the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants had taken no part in the"
"said altercation."
"There  cannot  be  any  basis  to  think  that  this  may  be  a  result  of  an  incident"
"occurred where the common intention was formed on the spur of the moment as"
"the evidence is clearly suggestive of the fact that this was a result of a previous"
"incident happened between the 1st accused appellant and the deceased."
"Although  there  is  no  doubt  PW-01  has  identified  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  accused"
"appellants outside of the house, I find a basis for  a clear doubt as to whether"
"she clearly saw that the said accused appellants were armed with a knife and a"
"club at that time."
