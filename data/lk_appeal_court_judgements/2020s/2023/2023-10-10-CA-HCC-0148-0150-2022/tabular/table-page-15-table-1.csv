"The  power  of  observation  differs  from  person  to  person.  What  one  may"
"notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on"
"one person’s mind, whereas, it might go unnoticed on the part of another."
"Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of"
"events  which  take  place  in  rapid  succession  or  in  a  short  time  span.  A"
"witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on.”"
