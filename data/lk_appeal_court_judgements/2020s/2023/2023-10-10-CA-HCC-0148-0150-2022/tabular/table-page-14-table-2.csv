"The Indian Supreme Court held in the case of Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State"
"of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC 753 that;"
"â€œBy  and  large  a  witness  cannot  be  expected  to  possess  a  photographic"
"memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a videotape is"
"replayed on the mental screen."
"Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness"
"could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of"
"surprise.  The  mental  faculties  therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  attune  to"
"absorb the details."
