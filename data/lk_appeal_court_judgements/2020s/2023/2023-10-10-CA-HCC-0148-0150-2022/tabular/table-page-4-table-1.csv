"She has stated in her evidence that she saw a Manna knife with the person she"
"identified as Podi Maama and a club with Mahinda."
"In Court, she has identified the 1st accused appellant as Bandula, and the 2nd"
"accused appellant who is also a relative of the deceased as the person whom she"
"referred to as Podi Maama and has identified him as Nandana Abeywardena. She"
"has identified the 3rd accused appellant as the person referred to as Mahinda. It"
"has been her evidence that she saw the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants from"
"a distance about five-six feet away. After the appellants left the scene, the witness"
"has raised her cries and the villagers who gathered have taken steps to take the"
"deceased to the hospital where he was pronounced dead."
"While she being subjected to cross-examination on behalf of the appellants, the"
"defence has marked a contradiction as V-01 where the witness has stated when"
"she gave evidence before the Magistrateâ€™s Court of Mathugama, that she could"
"not see the place where the husband was sleeping from the room, whereas, she"
"has stated in her evidence before the trial  Court, that she could see the place"
"where her husband was sleeping."
"She has maintained the position that although there was a kerosene lamp in her"
"house, when her husband went to sleep, it was lit off and the torch they had was"
"with her. However, the defence has marked a contradiction in that regard in her"
"evidence  before  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Mathugama  in  the  non-summary"
"inquiry where she has stated that her husband took the torch from her and went"
"to sleep. This contradiction has been marked as V-02."
"Before the trial Court, she has maintained the position that the torch was with"
"her throughout and she identified the appellants with the aid of the torch she"
"had with her."
"The defence has brought to the notice of the Court that in her initial statement"
"to the police, PW-01 has failed to mention that the 2nd accused appellant had a"
"Manna knife and the 3rd accused appellant had a club with them when she saw"
"them in that night as omissions in her statement."
