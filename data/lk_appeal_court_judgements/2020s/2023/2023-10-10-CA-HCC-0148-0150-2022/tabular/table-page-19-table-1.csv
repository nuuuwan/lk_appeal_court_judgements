"This becomes so, as she has failed to mention that in her police statement made"
"few hours after the incident and has failed even to state that at the inquest or at"
"the non-summary proceedings held at the Magistrate Court."
"Therefore, I find that the learned High Court Judge was not correct when it was"
"determined that the evidence has established beyond reasonable doubt the 2nd"
"and  the  3rd  accused  appellants  carried  weapons  and  actively  took  part  in  the"
"attack of the deceased."
"Since  the  evidence  led  before  the  trial  Court  provides  no  direct  evidence  to"
"connect  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  accused  appellants  for  causing  the  death  of  the"
"deceased, it becomes necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable"
"doubt  that  the  said  two  accused  appellants  participated  in  the  crime  with  a"
"common  intention  along  with  the  1st  accused  appellant  to  prove  the  charge"
"against them. What has been established at the trial was only the presence of"
"the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants outside the house where the assault took"
"place."
"It is my considered view that alone would not suffice to conclude that the charge"
"has been proved beyond reasonable doubt against them. I am of the view that"
"the only conclusion which can be reached would be that their presence creates"
"a  grave  suspicion  of  their  involvement  in  the  crime.  However,  it  is  settled  law"
"that suspicions alone would not prove a criminal case."
"For the reasons set out above, I find merit in the appeal preferred by the 2nd and"
"the  3rd  accused  appellants  and  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was"
"misdirected when the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants were convicted for the"
"offence of murder based on common intention."
"Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants"
"and acquit them of the charge."
