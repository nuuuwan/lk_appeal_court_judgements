"The contradiction marked V-02, which relates to the fact whether the torch was"
"with her when she came out of the room was based on her evidence during the"
"non-summary  proceedings  that  her  husband  took  the  torch.  However,  when"
"giving evidence in Court, she has given clear evidence that the torch was with"
"her and the husband went to sleep in the living area after coming home drunk"
"during  that  night.  I  find  her  evidence  that  it  was  she  who  had  the  torch  very"
"much acceptable as she was the one sleeping with the children and who may"
"need it during the night"
"When it comes to the evidence presented before the trial Court in relation to the"
"question of identity, it can be said that the PW-01 had a very brief moment to"
"observe and identify the accused appellants."
"This is a house where there was no electricity and no doors or windows except"
"for  the  door  of  the  room  where  PW-01  and  children  were  sleeping.  Under  the"
"circumstances, I do not find any reason  to doubt her evidence that she had a"
"torch  with  her  although  she  must  have  stated  otherwise  during  the  non-"
"summary inquiry. Her evidence taken in its totality clearly establishes the fact"
"that it was from the aid of the torch she had identified the persons who came to"
"the  house.  Although  it  was  nighttime,  I  am  of  the  view  that  for  a  person  well"
"adapted to living in such conditions, a light emanating from a torch would be a"
"sufficient source for clear identification of a person. Her evidence was that when"
"she saw the 1st accused appellant he was few feet away from her inside the house"
"and near her husband. She has observed the husband with a head injury on the"
"floor  and  the  1st  accused  appellant  has  left  the  place  after  uttering  filth  while"
"carrying an iron rod."
"I am of the view that even in relation to the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellants,"
"her  evidence  had  been  that  they  were  only  about  5-6  feet  away  from  her,  but"
"outside  the  house.  Since  the  house  had  no  doors  or  windows,  her  ability  to"
"identify  a  known  person  from  such  a  distance  using  a  torchlight  cannot  be"
"doubted under any circumstance."
