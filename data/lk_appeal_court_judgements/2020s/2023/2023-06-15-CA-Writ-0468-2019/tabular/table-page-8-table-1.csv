"In the instant application, the main relief sought by the Petitioner is to quash"

"The acquisition procedure in the Land Acquisition Act starts with Section 2"
"(1)."
"Section 2 (1) reads as follows;"
"‘2 (1) Where the Minster decides that land in any area is needed for any public"
"purpose, he may direct the acquiring officer of the district in which that area"

"published on the 23rd March 2018 (‘P 5’/’R2 (a) to (c)’)."

"acquiring officer has to proceed to investigate the suitability of the land for"
"the  purpose  for  which  the  land  is  to  be  acquired  by  carrying  out  surveys,"
"examining the subsoil, demarcating boundaries, etc. Thereafter, if the Minister"

"terms  of  Section  4  (3)  of  the  Act  calling  for  written  objections  for  the"
"acquisition, if any."

"is  to  enable  the  owner  to  submit  his  objections:  which  would  legitimately"
