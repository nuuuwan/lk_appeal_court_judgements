"In State of  Uttar Pradesh v. M. K.  Anthony  [AIR 1985 SC 48] the court"
"“While  appreciating  the  evidence  of  a  witness,  the  approach"
"must  be  whether  the  evidence  of  the  witness  read  as  a  whole"
"appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed,"
"it 
is  undoubtedly  necessary 
for 
the  court 
to  scrutinise 
the"
"evidence  more  particularly  keeping 
in  view 
the  deficiencies,"
"draw-backs  and  infirmities  pointed  out  in  the  evidence  as  a"
"whole  and  evaluate  them  to  find  out  whether  it  is  against  the"
"general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether"
"the  earlier  evaluation  of  the  evidence  is  shaken  as  to  render  it"
"unworthy  of  belief.  Minor  discrepancies  on  trivial  matters  not"
"touching 
the  core  of 
the  case,  hyper-technical  approach  by"
"taking  sentences 
torn  out  of  context  here  or 
there 
from 
the"
"evidence, 
attaching 
importance 
to 
some 
technical 
error"
"committed  by  the  investigating  officer  not  going  to  the  :  root  of"
"the  matter  would  not  ordinarily  permit  rejection  of  the  evidence"
"as a whole.  …Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in"
"some  details  unrelated  to  the  main  incident  because  power  of"
"observation,  retention  and  reproduction  differ  with  individuals."
"Cross  examination  is  an  unequal  duel  between  a  rustic  and"
"refined lawyer.”"
