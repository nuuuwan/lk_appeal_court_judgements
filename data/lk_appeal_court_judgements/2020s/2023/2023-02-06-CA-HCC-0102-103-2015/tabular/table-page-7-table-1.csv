"The Learned President’s Counsel for 1st Appellant had contended under 1st"
"ground  of  appeal  that  the 
infirmities  in  the  evidence  of  the  main  eye"
"witness have not been given due consideration."
"The Learned President’s Counsel strenuously argued that the Learned Trial"
"Judge  had 
failed 
to 
consider 
all 
the 
circumstances  whether  PW1,"
"Seelawathie had witnessed the incident as claimed by her in her testimony."
"As  stated  above,  PW1  Seelawathie  who 
is  an  eye  witness  had  vividly"
"explained how this gruesome incident had happened. She had clearly seen"
"the attack on the 2nd deceased Jayatilaka before she could escape from the"
"house."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge 
in  his 
judgment  had  considered 
the"
"evidence given by PW1 extensively and properly analyzed her evidence in its"
"correct  perspective.  Further 
learned  High  Court  Judge  had  reasonably"
"considered all evidence direct and circumstantial to come to his decision."
"Further, the eye witness PW1 had given evidence in the High Court nearly"
"17 years after the incident. I consider her evidence is clear and cogent and"
"not shaken her credibility or testimonial trustworthiness."
"Although motive is not necessary to prove in a criminal trial, existence of a"
"motive  would  strengthen  the  prosecution  case.  In  this  case  the  evidence"
"revealed  that  an  enmity  existed  between  parties  due  to  the  sister  of  1st"
"accused and 1st Appellant who married to the 2nd deceased Jayathilaka had"
"left  her  matrimonial  house  due  to  a  family  dispute  with  her  husband  the"
"2nd deceased. This had led to the 1st accused and 1st Appellant threatening"
"1st  deceased  Cicilia  with  regard 
to 
their  sister’s 
issue  of 
leaving 
the"
"matrimonial house."
"As the Learned High Court had Judge had considered all these evidence in"
"his judgment, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had"
"failed to give due consideration to the evidence of PW1, Seelawathie. Hence,"
"I conclude this ground has no merit."
