"provides  for  a  choice  between  either  proving  that  necessary  precautions  were"
"taken or that there was no knowledge of the offence being committed. Similarly,"
"yet minutely different stance is adopted by the Fauna and Flora Protection Act"
"no. 22 of 2009, where under Section 54 of the Act, Section 64 of the principal"
"enactment  is  amended  to  hold  that  where  an  owner  of  a  vehicle  proves  to  the"
"court  on  a  balance  of  probability  that  s/he  has  exercised  all  due  diligence  to"
"prevent the use of the vehicle in any offences, the burden casted therein shall be"
"dispensed."
"However, section 79 of the Act does not cast such a burden upon the registered"
"owner  of  vehicle  where  the  application  of  Section  79  is  automatically  triggered"
"wherever,  any  offence  is  committed  with  the  use  of  the  vehicle.  Therefore,  the"
"learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  stance  that  the  appellant  has  not  taken  the"
"necessary  precautions  to  prevent  the  commission  of  an  offence  by  using  the"
"vehicle, does not have any legal grounding as such a burden is not casted on the"
"owner  by  the  Poisons,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance.  Thus,  the"
"contention  of  the  learned  D.S.G  in  this  regard  is  not  acceptable.  This  Court"
"decided in CA-PHC-119-18 C.A Minute dated 15.03 2022 “In the absence of any"
"amending law to the Excise Ordinance, the principles enunciated by early case law"
"under the Excise Ordinance must be used as guidance.  Importation of principles"
"from different laws must be discouraged. It has always been accepted as axiomatic"
"that judges administer justice according to the prevailing law of the land. As His"
"Lordship Justice Maartensz observed in Alice Kothalawala Vs. W.H. Perera and"
"another  (1937)1  CLJ  58  p  ‘Justice  must  be  done  according  to  law.  If  hardship"
"results  from  the  law  in  force  the  remedy  must  be  affected  by  legislation.  There"
"would be chaos if a judge was entitled to create a procedure to meet the exigencies"
"of every case in which he considers the law would work injustice”."
"Nonetheless, even though the law stipulated under Section 79 does not provide"
"for an opportunity to the registered owner a vehicle to establish on a balance of"
"probability that s/he is not a party to the offence and therefore by reason of his"
"innocence  to  have  his/her  vehicle  released  to  the  owner,  Nonetheless,  the  law"
"still enables a party to establish his/her innocence on a balance of probability"
"before the court through the application of principles of Natural Justice."
