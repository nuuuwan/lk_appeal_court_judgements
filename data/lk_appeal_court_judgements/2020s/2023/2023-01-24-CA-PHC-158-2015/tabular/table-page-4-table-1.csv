"relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State with effect from the date on"
"which such conviction is affirmed on appeal."
"Literally, Section 79 automatically comes into operation in the event of an offence"
"being  committed in  contravention of the law promulgated in the Ordinance. In"
"this  instant  scenario,  the  application  of  Section  79  is  triggered  because  the"
"vehicle in question has been used to transport cannabis which is an illegal and"
"an  illicit  activity,  committed  in  contravention  of  the  law,  thereby  the  court  is"
"empowered to forfeit the said vehicle according to the powers bestowed therein."
"It is pertinent to note that Section 79 does not provide for the release of the vehicle"
"upon satisfaction of the Court of the owner’s innocence in the said offence. This"
"is contrary to the  laws  promulgated in the Forest Ordinance, Flora and Fauna"
"Act  and  the  Animal’s  Act  where  the  release  of  a  vehicle  is  enabled  where  the"
"criterion to prove innocence on the part of the owner of the vehicle is established."
"Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, as amended by the Forest (Amendment) Act"
"No.65 of 2009 provides that a vehicle owner has the burden of proving before a"
"court,  on  a  balance  of  probability,  that  s/he  has  taken  all  the  necessary"
"precautions  to  prevent  the  commission  of  any  illegal  activities  by  engaging"
"his/her  vehicle.  The  Forest  Ordinance  following  the  amendment  has  cast  a"
"burden on the owner of a vehicle to claim the vehicle in the event of a confiscation"
"by  proving  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  court  that  when  perusing  the  adduced"
"evidence, s/he has taken all the necessary precautions as a reasonable registered"
"owner of a vehicle to prevent the commission of any offences with the employment"
"of the vehicle."
"Similarly, under Section 3A of the Animals Act, there is a burden cast upon the"
"registered owner of a vehicle to prove to the satisfaction of the court, on a balance"
"of  probability,  that  s/he  as  the  registered  owner  of  a  vehicle  has  taken  all"
"necessary precautions to prevent any illegal activities from being committed with"
"the use of the vehicle or to prove that s/he had no knowledge of the said vehicle"
"being  engaged  in  illegal  activities.  The  difference  between  the  aforementioned"
"burden  cast  by  the  Forest  Ordinance  and  the  Animals  Act  is  that  the  latter"
