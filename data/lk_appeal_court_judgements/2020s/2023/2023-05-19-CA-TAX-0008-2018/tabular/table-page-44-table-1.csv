"retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment. ….And"
"therefore, the only question is, was the appeal to His Majesty in Council a right"
"vested in the appellant at the date of the passing of the Act, or was it a mere"
"procedure? It seems to their Lordships that the question does not admit of"
"doubt. To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a superior"
"tribunal which belonged to him as of right in a very different thing from"
"regulating procedure. In principle, their Lordships see no difference between"
"abolishing an appeal altogether and transferring the appeal to a new tribunal."

"known general principle that statutes are not to be held to act retrospectively"
"unless a clear intention to that effect is manifested”."
