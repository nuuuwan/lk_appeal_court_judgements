"Retrospectivity and Prospectivity in Amending Acts"
"[89] It is relevant to note that where a repeal of statutory provision dealing with"
"substantive rights is followed by new legislation by enactment of an amending"
"Act, such new legislation is prospective in operation. (Texmann, p. 863). Such an"
"amendment will not affect the substantive or vested rights of parties unless it is"
"made  retrospective  expressly  or  by  necessary  implication.  (supra).  Thus,  an"
"amendment of substantive law is not retrospective unless expressly laid down"
"or by necessary implication inferred (Bhagai Ram Sharma v. Union of India AIR"
"1988  SC  740).  An  amending  Act  that  deals  with  substantive  rights  is  only"
"retrospective  if  there  is  a  clear  indication  in  the  legislative  language  to  that"
"effect."
"[90] I would now proceed to examine whether section 163(5) of the  amending"
"Act (Act, No. 22 of 2011) is retrospective as urged by learned counsel for the"
"Respondent, and thus, whether the assessor is given a new lease of life to extend"
"the  period  given  to  make  the  assessment  from  31.03.2012  to  30.11.2012.  A"
"perusal of the amendments made to the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No."
"22  of  2011  reveals  that  they  deal  with  both  procedural  and  substantive"
"amendments.  The  amendments  made 
to  section  163(5)  of 
the  principal"
"enactment  are  prima  facie,  presumed  to  have  retrospective  effect  and  the"
"question is whether such presumption of retrospectivity applies to the present"
"case, in view of section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011."
