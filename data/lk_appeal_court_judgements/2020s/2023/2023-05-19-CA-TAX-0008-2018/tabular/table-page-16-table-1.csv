"[
35] One cannot fathom from the language of section 163 (3) that the notice of",""
"assessment should also be sent together with the communication of the reasons",""
"for non-acceptance of the return. Once the assessment or additional assessment",""
"had been made, the assessor is fixed to a definite assessment, a position which",""

In

the  communication  of  such",""
