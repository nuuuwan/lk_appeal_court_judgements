"“Therefore, both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have based"
"their judgments in the premise that “making the assessment” is same as “giving"
"notice of assessment”.  This was why it had been argued in CA Tax 17/2017"
"that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a valid"
"notice of assessment. The Division of this Court in C.A. Tax 17/2017 though"
"that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent without being"
"written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the appellant is that"
"an “assessment” becomes valid only when the “notice” is given. This position"
"was the basis of Ismail despite those two cases were concurred with the duty"
"to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that an “assessment” is no"
"“assessment” until “notice of assessment” is given. The position could have"
"been otherwise, viz. an “assessment” could have been a valid assessment, as"
"soon as an estimate is made. If like in Honig (administrators of Emmanuel"
"Honig) v Sarasfield (H.M. Inspector of Taxes), the Commissioners Inland"
"Revenue also maintained a register in which an assessment is entered. In the"
"absence of such procedure in this country. It cannot be accepted that the"
"making of an assessment without giving notice of assessment is a valid"
"assessment. Hence, notice of assessment must be given to make the"
"assessment validly made for the purpose of the stipulated time period”."
