"different things, a valid assessment cannot be made in time unless the notice"
"of assessment is served in the tax payer."
"[9]  On  the  first  question  whether  the  statutory  time  bar  applies  for  both  the"
"assessment  and  the  notice  of  assessment,  Mr.  Dharmawardenaâ€™s  submission"
"was that there is a clear difference between the making of the assessment and"
"the  notice  of  assessment,  and  the  time  bar  relates  to  the  making  of  the"
"assessment, and not to the service of the notice of assessment. His contention"
"was that there can be no notice without an actual and valid assessment, which"
"precedes the notice of assessment, and therefore, it is in no way dependent on"
"the notice or the service thereafter. He relied on the decisions in Honig & Others"
