"[50] The fact that the Inspector of Taxes signed the certificate in the assessment"
"book  stating  that  an  assessment  was  made  under  the  Taxes  Management  Act,"
"cannot  be  applied 
in  displacing 
its  ratio  of  Honig  that  the  “making  of  the"
"assessment was not dependent on the service of the notice of assessment, which"
"are two different things.” Accordingly, it is not possible to distinguish the decision"
"in Honig from the present case and accept the Appellant’s argument that unless"
"the notice of assessment is served, there is no valid assessment."
"[51] The Appellant argued that unless the notice of assessment is served on the"
"assessee within the period for the making of the assessment, the assessor could"
"indefinitely delay the sending of the notice of assessment, and issue the same at"
"any time as he wishes. If that is the intention of Parliament, the legislature should"
"have 
specifically 
stated 
so 
in 
the 
Inland  Revenue  Act 
that 
the 
letter  of"
"communication as required by section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act shall be"
"accompanied by the notice of assessment or that the notice of assessment shall"
"be served within the period for the making of the assessment.  In this context, the"
"question  whether  the  notice  of  assessment  should  also  be  sent  before  the"
"expiration of the time  period for the making of the assessment  is the exclusive"
"province of the Parliament."
"[52] It is settled law that courts cannot usurp legislative function under the disguise"
"of interpretation and rewrite, recast, reframe and redesign the Inland Revenue Act,"
"because this is exclusively in the domain of the legislature. This proposition was"
"lucidly explained by Lord Simonds in Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council"
"v
.
 Newport Corporation   [1952]  AC  189,  HL.  Referring  to  the  speech  of  Lord"
"Denning MR, Lord Simonds said at page 191: “"
