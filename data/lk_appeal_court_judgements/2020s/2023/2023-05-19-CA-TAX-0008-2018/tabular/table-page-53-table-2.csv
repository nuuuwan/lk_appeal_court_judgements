"Rebuttal of Presumption of Retrospectivity"
"[126]  This 
raises 
the  question  whether 
the  presumption  of 
retrospective"
"operation of any procedural enactment made by Act, No. 22 of 2011 has been"
"rebutted by any express provision of the same Act. There is no dispute that the"
"period  of  limitation  for  making  the  assessment  had  not  expired  when  the"
"amendment  was  made  to  the 
Inland  Revenue  Act  by  the 
Inland  Revenue"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No.  22  of  2011.  Even  if  it  is  assumed  that  the  period  of"
"limitation for making the assessment had not expired when the amendment was"
"made to the principal enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011, the crucial question"
"is whether the legislature has expressed something by express words that would"
"prohibit  the  assesser  from  using  such  amendment  and  making  an  assessment"
"within such extended period of limitation. In short, the question is whether the"
"presumption of retrospectivity in relation to procedural limitation made to the"
"principal enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 has been rebutted by any express"
"provision in that Act itself."
