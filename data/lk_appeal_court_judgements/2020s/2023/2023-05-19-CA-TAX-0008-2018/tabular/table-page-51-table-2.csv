Parliament passed the 1959 Act nullifying that decision. By the same Act,"
"Parliament gave power to issue a notice at any time in all these cases in"
"which the 8 year period under the principal Act as it stood prior to the 1956"
"Amendment had expired. The words “at any time” mean what they say."
"There is no special meaning to be attributed to them. “Ant time” thus meant"
"action to be taken without any limit of time. ……"
"The effect of the amendment of the year 1953 on this case may be stated"
"shortly thus: The assessment year being 1942-43, the notice under s. 34 had"
"to issue in 1951 at the latest. After that year notice could not issue unless"
"the limit of time was increased or removed. But the fact that the notice could"
"not be issued after 1951 did not clothe the assesee with a right not to pay"
"the tax if it became legally claimable again. If the law conferred a power on"
"the income-tax Officer to deal with such a case, the assessee would again"
"be exposed to proceedings, provided it said in clear terms that the law was"
"retrospective. This is what the law did in precise and clear terms. In 1953 an"
"Act was passed amending s. 34 which enabled action at any time if there was"
"a
 finding or direction of the character indicated in the second proviso to"
"sub-s. (3) of s. 34. Section 31 also made this position clear by applying the"

"saved all notices issued and assessments made in respect of any year prior"
"to April 1. 1948, whether the notices were issued or the assessments were"
"made before or after April 1, 1952. …………But a Court is required to take"

"1948, it is the duty of Court and Tribunal to read s. 34 in that manner and in"
