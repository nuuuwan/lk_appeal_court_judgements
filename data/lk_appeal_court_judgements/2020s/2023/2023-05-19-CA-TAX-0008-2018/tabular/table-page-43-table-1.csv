"expressly excludes the retrospective operation of that amendment and provides"
"that the effective date of the amendment shall be 01.04.2009."
"[104] Although the Supreme Court considered the combined effect of section"
"106(1) and section 163(5) of that Act, No. 19 of 2009, the Supreme Court was"
"clearly guided by the legislative intention in section 27(6) of the amending Act,"
"No.  19  of  2009.  As  noted,  the  Supreme  Court  clearly  held  that  section  27(6)"
"expressly excludes the applicability of the general presumption that procedural"
"laws  be  given  retrospective  effect  and  that  the  amendments  made  to  the"
"principal  enactment,  (which  includes  s.  163(5)),  other  than  the  amendments"
"specifically referred to in section 27, shall come into force on April 1, 2009. (see-"
"pp 15-16 of the Supreme Court judgment)."
"[105] The Supreme Court clearly held in Seylan Bank v. The The Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue (supra) that although the amendment made to section"
"163(5) is presumed to have retrospective effect, the express provision in section"
"27(6) of the amending Act excludes the applicability of the general presumption"
"of retrospectivity, and therefore, the amendment made to section 163(5) of the"
"principal  enactment  does  not  apply  to  the  year  of  assessment  2007/2008,  in"
"terms of section 27(6) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009. Accordingly, it is not possible"
"to disregard the first part of the decision of the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank v."
"The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), and apply only the second"
"part of the decision as against the express statutory provision in section 56 of"
"the Act, No. 56 of 2011 in the present case."
