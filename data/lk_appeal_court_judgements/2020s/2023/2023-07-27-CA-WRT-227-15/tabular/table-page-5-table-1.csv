"O
n 11.12.2012, the petitioner was served a notice under section 42A (2) of the"
"Municipal  Council  Ordinance,  which  notice  contained  that  the  petitioner's"
"building bearing no. 104/36A should be demolished within 14 days of the said"
"notice.  That notice was produced marked P12.  Further, the petitioner states"
"that the construction was not an unauthorized construction."
"The petitioners are seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st,"
"2nd and 3rdrespondents to demolish the building referred to in P12 and a writ"
"of certiorari to quash the lease agreements of the 8th respondent marked P6"
"and P8 C."
"T
he  1st  respondent  filed  objections  and  stated  that  the  petitioner  had  not"
"obtained any authority to build the constructions in question.  The petitioners"
"only obtained an application and there was no approval for the construction"
"of a building by the 1st respondent. The 6th respondent has admitted that the"
"letters marked P9A, P9B and P9C were issued to the 1st petitioner. However,"
"the 6th respondent further stated that P9C was issued  based on documents"
"that  were  submitted  by  the  1st  petitioner  at  the  site  inspection.  6th  and  7th"
"respondents also deny that they gave permits to the petitioners to construct a"
"building."
"I
t  is  common  ground  that  the  land  on  which  the  petitioners'  constructions"
"stand is state land.  The petitioner is not a permit holder or a grantee for that"
"state land.  Therefore, the petitioner has no legal right, title, or interest in the"
"subject land."
"T
he action instituted by the 4th respondent under the provisions of the State"
"Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  No.  7  of  1979  was  decided  against  the"
"petitioners. Even though the  petitioners'  position is that the decision of the"
"Learned  Magistrate  was  set  aside  by  the  Provincial  High  Court,  no  certified"
"copy of such decision is produced by the petitioner."
