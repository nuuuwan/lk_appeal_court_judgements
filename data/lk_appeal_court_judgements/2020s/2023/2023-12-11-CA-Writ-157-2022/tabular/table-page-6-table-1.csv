"â€œIf a decision maker bases his decision on a misunderstanding of the factual"
"situation of  the case, he will reach a decision which  is wrong. The question"
"which then arises is  whether the courts  will review such an error in judicial"
"proceedings. In general, the answer to that question is that the courts will be"
"very cautious. After all, the courts will often not have the expertise to assess"
"the  factual  situation  and  may  have  great  difficulty  in  deciding  whether  a"
"factual error has resulted in the wrong decision. The courts have traditionally"
"approached  this  matter  by  dividing  errors  of  fact  into  categories.    The  first"
"relates to reviewable errors of facts,  which are jurisdictional, and the other"
"category is that of non-reviewable, non-jurisdictional facts."
