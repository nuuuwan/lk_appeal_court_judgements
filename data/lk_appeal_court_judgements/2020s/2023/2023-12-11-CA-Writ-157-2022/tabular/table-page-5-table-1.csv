"The  legal  proceedings  were  commenced  before  the  Magistrate  Court  Teldeniya"
"reporting  facts  by  the  officials  of  the  Forest  Department  alleging  the  violation  of"
"Section 7 (1)(a), (1)(i) and (1)(j) of the Forest Ordinance based on the portion of the"
"Forest Reserve being cleared. The Respondents state that the area cleared was the"
"land which is a part of the Forest Reserve adjoining the portion depicted as ‘E’ in the"
"R3 Tracing but not Lot ‘E’. Further, the Respondents argue that Lot ‘E’ is the land"
"claimed by the Petitioner upon deed no. 328 marked P1 which is A:2, R:3, P:25.32 in"
"extent situated outside the Forest Reserve. Said Lot ‘E’ is depicted in Plan R3."
"However, the extent of the land described in  deed no. 328 P1 is A:3, R:1, P:03 in"
"extent. Accordingly, there is a discrepancy in the extent between Lot ‘E’ and the land"
"referred to in deed no.328. Lot ‘E’ is less than the extent given in the extent of the"
"land described in deed no.  328.  It is important to observe that the Respondents"
"have identified the area cleared as 0.4 Hectares (approximately 92 Perches) outside"
"Lot 
‘E’ 
in  the  GPS  Map  marked  R4.  The  Respondents  have  conceded  to  the"
"Petitioner’s title deed no. 328 and stated that they have not obstructed any activity"
"within  the  extent  of  the  land  described  in  deed  no.  328  in  their  Statement  of"
"Objections and the Affidavit. Since there is a discrepancy between the extent of Lot"
"‘E’ and the land described in deed no. 328, it cannot be accurately decided whether"
"the portion of land cleared is within the Forest Reserve. Furthermore, the statement"
"made by Forest Officer Samith Chathuranga to the Police on 04.10.2021 also reflects"
"their  uncertainty  about  the  boundaries  of  the 
lands 
in  question.  Under  such"
"circumstances,  this  Court 
is  not 
in  a  position  to  accept  the  stance  that  the"
"Respondents have not obstructed any activity within the extent of the land depicted"
"in deed No. 328. Moreover, although the Respondents claim that the Petitioner owns"
"only Lot ‘E’ in Plan R3 the Petitioner does not claim Lot ‘E’ in Plan R3 as his land."
"While perusing the documents marked P4 it is observed that the Petitioner claims"
"Lots 22 & 36 in preliminary plan PP/MAHA/3207 as his land. Said portion is depicted"
"as  Lot  ‘D’  which  forms  a  part  of  Tracing  No.  Maha/FRMP/2004/237  in  Plan  R3."
"Nevertheless,  at  all  times,  the  Respondents  have  acted  on  the  basis  that  the"
"Petitioner owns Lot ‘E’ in Plan R 3."
"Therefore, it appears that the Respondents without conducting a due examination"
"have concluded that the area cleared by the Petitioner is within the Forest Reserve"
"based on incorrect findings of fact or insufficient material. If the errors of fact are of"
"a fundamental nature in that they cause a decision to be unlawful."
