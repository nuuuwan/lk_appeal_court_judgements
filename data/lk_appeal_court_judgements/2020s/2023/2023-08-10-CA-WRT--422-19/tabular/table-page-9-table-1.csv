"The 
case 
of  Samarakoon  and  Others  V.  University  Grants"
"Commission  and  Others  – 
(2005)  1  Sri  L.R.  119  explains  how"
"""legitimate expectation"" derives. It was held that ""Legitimate expectation"
"derives from an undertaking given by someone in authority, and such"
"an undertaking may not even be expressed and would have to be known"
"from 
the  surrounding  circumstances."" 
In 
the  case  at  hand, 
the"
"petitioner could not have legitimate expectations because the petitioner"
"had  no  transaction  or  connection  in  respect  of  this  land  with  the  1st"
"respondent, divisional secretary, or any other official engaged in issuing"
"permits, and he had transactions only with the 7th respondent, who had"
"no right to the state land."
"In,  Union  of  India  v  Hindustan  Development  Corporation-  (1993)"
"SCC (3) 499 it was stated that, the legitimacy of an expectation can be"
"inferred,  if  it  is  founded  on  the  sanction  of  law  or  custom  or  an"
"established  procedure  followed  in  a  natural  and  regular  sequence.  In"
"the  case  at  hand,  no  sanction  of 
law,  custom  or  an  established"
"procedure  was 
followed  by 
the  petitioner.  They  have  engaged 
in"
"personal transactions on a property owned by the state."
"According  to  the  petition,  without  a  permit  under  Land  Development"
"Ordinance  or  without  any  legal  right,  5th  and  6th  respondents  have"
"possessed the land and illegally transferred the state land for a sum of"
"Rs.1,500,000/- to the 7th respondent. Again, the 7th respondent made"
"an  illegal  transaction  with  the  petitioner  and  executed  the  transfer"
"agreement,  P-6  to  transfer  the  state  land  to  the  petitioner.  It  is  to  be"
"noted that violators of law are not entitled to legitimate expectation as"
"observed in the case of  Cinnamond v. British Airports Authority –"
"[1980] 1 W.L.R. 582. This decision has also been followed by the Indian"
"Supreme  Court  in  Madras  City  Wine  Merchants'  Association.  and"
"Another v. State of Tamil Nadu and Another – Case No: Appeal (civil)"
"4981 of 1994, decided on 27 July, 1994."
