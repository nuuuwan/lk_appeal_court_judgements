"The 2nd Party-Respondent had stated in her objections that 1st Party-Petitioner never"
"asked her directly to leave the property in dispute, but, on 27.02.2016 the 1st Party-"
"Petitioner at the behest of her husband made a false complaint to the Police to oust"
"her from the property in dispute."
"Moreover,  on  29.02.2016,  the  electricity  supply  had  been  disconnected  by  the"
"Electricity Board upon a complaint made by the husband of the 1st Party-Petitioner."
"However, the electricity supply had been restored on 04.03.2016. This indicates that"
"the  dispute  between  parties  arose  on  or  around  29.02.2016  and  not  prior  to"
"02.02.2016 after dispossessing the 1st Party-Petitioner from the disputed premises."
"If  2nd  Party-Respondent  had  come  to  possession  of  the  disputed  premises  on"
"19.08.2015  after  her  retirement,  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  the  1st  Party-"
"Petitioner would have complained to the Electricity Board to disconnect the supply"
"during the said period, prior to 29.02.2016."
"It is worthy to note the affidavit dated 16.03.2016 (IP10) filed by the brother of the"
"Petitioner Rasaiah Senthuran which stated ‘even after the death of their parents,"
"the said affirmant Rasaiah Senthuran had lived in the said disputed premises. While"
"the house was under renovation, he had lived in a portion of the premises in dispute."
"After completion of the renovation, the keys of the house had been handed over to"
"Grama  Niladari  Thavarajah  on  20.12.2015  by  building  contractor  Rasaratnam"
"Uthayakumar  to  whom  the  custody  of  the  premise  was  entrusted  by  1st  Party-"
"Petitioner’."
"It is seen that the contents of the said affidavit (IP10) filed by Rasaiah Senthuran is"
"contrary  to  the  contents  of  the  affidavit  of  2nd  Party-Respondent.  Thus,  the  2nd"
"Party-Respondent has not substantiated her contention that after her retirement,"
"she had come to occupy the premises in dispute from 19.08.2015."
"It is imperative to note that brother of the Petitioner, Rasaiah Senthuran, affirmed"
"in his affidavit that Party of the 2nd Part-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred"
"to as the Respondent) his sister Gnaneswari, who was living in Colombo had come"
"to know that Petitioner Nageswari was making arrangements to give the premises in"
"dispute  to  establish  a  sewing  training  center  and  the  said  2nd  Party-Respondent"
