"The said position was corroborated by affidavit (IP14) of Sundaralingam Satheesan"
"which stated that when they went to clean the property in dispute on 27.01.2016 in"
"order  to  set  up  the  said  sewing  training  centre  and  when  sewing  machines  were"
"brought on 28.01.2016, they were not allowed to enter the said property in dispute"
"and  that  2nd  Party-Respondent  prevented  them  from  unloading  and  keeping  the"
"sewing machines in the disputed house. Although arrangements had been made for"
"the  opening  ceremony  of  the  sewing  training  centre  on  29.01.2016  and  Alaveddi"
"Willlage  Kanapathi  Nathkunam  had  come  from  London  to  declare  open  the  said"
"sewing  training  centre,  they  had  been  prevented  by  2nd  Party-Respondent  on"
"28.01.2016 from entering the said property in dispute."
"In view of the aforesaid facts revealed through the affidavits tendered by parties,"
"it is apparent that the contention of the 1st Party-Petitioner was corroborated by"
"the affidavits  marked  and  produced  as  IP3,  IP7,  IP9,  IP10,  IP11,  and  IP14. Thus,  it is"
"noteworthy that 2nd Party-Respondent’s position was contradicted by the contents"
"in affidavits filed on behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner.  As such, it is evident that"
"brother of the Petitioner, Rasaiah Senthuran had been in possession of the disputed"
"premises during the period relevant to the instant action and that he possessed the"
"disputed premise on behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner."
"Therefore, it clearly manifests that 2nd Party-Respondent was not in possession of"
"the disputed property on a date 2 months prior to the date on which the information"
"was filed in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"Thus,  I  hold  that  2nd  Party-Respondent  is  not  entitled  to  the  possession  of  the"
"disputed property or part thereof in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts’"
"Procedure Act. It is observable that 2nd Party-Respondent had come to the possession"
"of  the  disputed  premises on  or around  20.01.2016  and  since  the information  was"
"filed on 02.03.2016, the 2nd Party-Respondent has to establish that she had been in"
"possession of the disputed premises on or before 02.01.2016, which the 2nd Party-"
"Respondent had not been able to prove."
"Since the 1st Party-Petitioner entrusted the contractor to do the repairs of the house"
"and placed her brother Rasaiah Senthuran in part of the disputed property, it clearly"
"shows  that  the  1st  Party-Petitioner  had  actual  control  and  management  of  the"
"premises in dispute. This amply shows that 1st Party-Petitioner had possession of the"
