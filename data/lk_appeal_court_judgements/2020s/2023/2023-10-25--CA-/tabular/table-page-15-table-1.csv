"things occur."
"(1) That the owner should be given an opportunity of being heard against it;"

"the thing liable to confiscation."""
"Chief Justice Sharvananda held as follows;"
"“Having regard to the above rules of construction, I am unable to hold that the"
"amended  subsection  40  excludes  by  necessary  implication  the  rule  of  'audi"
"alteram partem'. On this construction, the petitioner, as owner of lorry bearing"
"No. 26 Sri 2518, is entitled to be heard on the question of forfeiture and if he"
"satisfies 
the  court 
that 
the  accused  committed 
the  offence  without  his"
"knowledge or participation, his lorry will not be liable to forfeiture."
"His Lordship further stated,"
"In  the  light  of  the  above  principles,  I  am  unable  to  accept  the  submission  of"
"State Counsel that the legislature by Section 7 of Act No. 13 of 1982 intended"
"to  deprive  an  owner  of  his  vehicle  that  had  been  used  by  the  offender  in"
"committing  a  forest  offence  without  the  owner's  knowledge  and  without  his"
"participation.  Having  regard  to  the  inequitable  consequences  that  flow  from"
"treating the words 'shall by reason of such conviction be forfeited to the State'"
"as  mandatory.  I  am  inclined  to  hold,  as  the  House  of  Lords  did  in  A.  G.  v."
"Parsons (supra)  that ""forfeited"" meant ""liable to be forfeited. "" and thus avoid"
"the injustice that would flow on the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is"
"automatic on the conviction of the accused. Having regard to the  above rules"
"of construction, I am unable to hold that the amended subsection 40 excludes"
"by  necessary 
implication 
the 
rule 
of 
'audi  alteram 
partem'.  On 
this"
"construction  the  petitioner,  as  owner  of  lorry  bearing  No.  26  Sri  2518 
is"
"entitled  to  be  heard  on  the  question  of forfeiture  and  if  he  satisfies  the  court"
"that 
the 
accused 
committed 
the 
offence  without 
his 
knowledge 
or"
"participation, his lorry will not be liable to forfeiture."
"The  above-mentioned  cases  emphasize  that  before  imposing  forfeiture,  the"
"owner  must  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to  show  cause  as  to  why  such"
"property should not be forfeited.  This  is  one of the rules of  natural justice."
"Even  in  an  action  of  rem,  once  the  property  is  seized,  the  owner  must  be"
"notified by personal notice or by publication."
"On  behalf  of  the  respondents,  it  was  argued  that  nowhere  in  section  119"
"does it speak or refer to ownership.  Further, it was argued that “there shall"
"be  a 
forfeiture  of  a  sum  of  money  and 
the  goods 
if 
false 
inter  alia"
"documentation is submitted irrespective of ownership.”  “Ownership or title"
"is 
irrelevant  because  when  a  party  contravenes  section  119,  the  party"
