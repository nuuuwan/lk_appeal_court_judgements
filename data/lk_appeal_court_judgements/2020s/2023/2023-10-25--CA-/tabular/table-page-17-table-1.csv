"Bank and cleared the goods. When the remitting Bank did not receive money"
"on  time,  the  petitioner  made  inquiries  from  both  banks  and  the  shipping"
"company.    When  the  petitioner  came  to  know  that  the  Delivery  Order  was"
"issued, one of the petitioner’s directors came to Sri Lanka on the same day"
"and  made  a  complaint  to  the  CID.  The  petitioner  has  acted  in  the  manner"
"that any law-abiding person would do. The 2nd respondent failed to give due"
"consideration  that  the  petitioner  exercised  due  diligence  and  completely"
"relied on banking transactions."
"The forfeiture of the sugar consignment is also bad for the following reasons."
"The  2nd  respondent  did  not  allow  the  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  to  cross-"
"examine  the  witnesses  Gnanasekaran  and  Eranga  Ratnayake  fully  during"
"the 
inquiry  proceedings  on  06.11.2012.  The  petitioner  alleged  that  the"
"petitioner was stopped at a crucial juncture during the cross-examination of"
"the  suspect,  Gnanasekaran  and  not  allowed 
to  cross-examine  Eranga"
"Ratnayake at all. This amounts to a breach of natural justice."
"The  2nd  respondent  has 
failed  to  consider  that  the  petitioner  was  not"
"negligent in handling documents or the consignment of sugar and it was not"
"privy to any of the illegal acts done by K. Gnanasekaran.  The confession of"
"Gnanasekaran,  who  defrauded  the  petitioner  and  the  6th  respondent  bank,"
"was irrelevant against the petitioner."
"The 2nd respondent failed to consider the contract entered into between the"
"petitioner  and  the  4threspondent  and  failed  to  consider  the  applicable  law"
"relating to the sales of goods."
"The  respondents  have  failed  to  take  into  consideration  the  provisions  of"
"section 166 B of the Ordinance that the petitioner had not contravened any"
"provisions of law, and there was no loss of revenue when forfeiting the sugar"
"consignment."
"Seylan Bank"
"On behalf of the 3rd respondent, it was argued that the Seylan Bank has no"
"locus  standi  to  file  an  action  against  the  customs  because  the  collecting"
"bank’s duty to make payment to the remitting bank arises only if the buyer"
"has  collected  documents  from  the  collecting  bank  paying  the  sale  price  to"
"the  collecting  bank.    On  behalf  of  the  third  respondent,  it  was  submitted"
"that  if  the  collecting  bank  is  not  paid  by  the  buyer,  the  bank's  duty  is  to"
"inform  the  remitting  bank  and  send  back  the  document.    However,  in  this"
"matter, the buyer has stolen the documents from the bank and cleared the"
"goods."
"The  third  respondent  further  argued  that  the  seller  (the  petitioner)  should"
"have  sued  against  the  buyer  and  the  collecting  bank  to  recover  the  selling"
