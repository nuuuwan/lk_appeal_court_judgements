"which involved issuing of an arrest warrant, it was stated by Deeraratne, J. at"
"page 382,"
"“Issuing a warrant is a judicial act involving the liberty of an individual and"
"no warrant of arrest should be lightly issued by a Magistrate simply because"
"a prosecutor or an investigator thinks it is necessary. It must be issued as"
"the law requires, when a Magistrate is satisfied that he should do so, on the"
"evidence taken before him on oath. It must not be issued by a Magistrate to"
"satisfy the sardonic pleasure of an opinionated investigator or prosecutor.”"
