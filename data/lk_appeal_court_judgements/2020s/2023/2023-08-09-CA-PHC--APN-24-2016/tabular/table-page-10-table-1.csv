"It is against the above order the petitioner has come before this Court invoking"
"the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court."
"When the order dated 16-02-2016 reached the learned Magistrate of Chilaw. The"
"learned Senior State Counsel who represented the respondent has informed the"
"Court that she is not objecting to the release of the contents in four of the six"
"cardboard boxes and has requested the Court to send 2 sealed cardboard boxes"
"with its contents to the Government Analyst and call for the report as requested"
"earlier. It has also been informed that she would not be objecting for the release"
"of the rest of the cigarettes to the petitioner."
"However,  when  this  application  was  supported  before  this  Court,  this  Court"
"issued  a  stay  order  preventing  the  learned  Magistrate  from  proceeding  any"
"further  in  the  matter  before  the  Magistrate  Court,  and  as  a  result,  it  is  now"
"informed  to  this  Court  that  the  said  productions  have  not  been  sent  to  the"
"Government Analyst as yet. However, it appears from the Magistrate Court case"
"record  that  apart  from  two  boxes,  the  contents  of  the  balance  four  boxes  had"
"been released to the petitioner on a bond, and the mentioned two boxes along"
"with its contents are in the Court custody.  It had been informed to the Court"
"that the expiry date of the cigarettes manufactured will be 6 months from the"
"date of manufacture."
"At the hearing of this matter, this Court had the benefit of listening to the learned"
"Presidentâ€™s  Counsel,  and  also  had  the  opportunity  of  listening  to  the  views"
"expressed  by  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  who  represented  the"
"respondent."
"The facts that have been presented before the learned Magistrate of Chilaw and"
"before this Court clearly demonstrates that the matter that had to be determined"
"by the learned Magistrate was whether the petitioner has violated the provisions"
"of section 34 (1) of the Act by failing to display the required pictorial warning on"
"the 6 large cardboard boxes used to transport the packets of cigarettes produced"
"before the Court."
