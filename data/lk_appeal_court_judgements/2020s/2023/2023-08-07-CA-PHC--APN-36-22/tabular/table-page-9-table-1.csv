"Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third"
"party, on order of confiscation shall be made  it  that owner had proved  to"
"the  satisfaction  of  the  Court  that  he  has  taken  all  precautions  to  prevent"
"the  use  of  the  said  vehicle  for  the  commission  of  the  offence.  The  ratio"
"decidendi  of  all  the  aforementioned  decisions  also  show  that  the  owner"
"has to establish the said matter on the balance of probability.”"
"Held further;"
"“As  has  been  clearly  illustrated  by  several  decisions  referred  to  above,  it"
"would  be  necessary  for  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  to  establish  that  the"
"vehicle  that  had  been  used  for  the  commission  of  the  offence  had  been"
"used without his knowledge and that the owner had taken all precautions"
"available  to  prevent  the  use  of  the  vehicle  for  the  commission  of  such  an"
"offence.”"
