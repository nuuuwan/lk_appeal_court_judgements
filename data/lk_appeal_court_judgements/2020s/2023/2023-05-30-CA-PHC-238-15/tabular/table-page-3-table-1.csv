"C. P. Kirtisinghe - J."
"The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (here in after referred to as the Appellant)"
"has preferred this appeal from the judgement of the learned High Court Judge"
"of the Provincial High Court of Colombo dated 31.10.2016."
"T
he  Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent 
(here 
in  after 
referred  to  as 
the"
"Respondent) - the Urban Development Authority had made an application to the"
"Magistrates’ Court of Kaduwela to remove an unauthorized construction of the"
"Appellant under the provisions of section 28 (A) (3) of the Urban Development"
"Authority Act which was allowed by the learned Magistrate by her order dated"
"22.04.2013. The Appellant had preferred a revision application to the Provincial"
"High Court of Colombo to revised that order and the learned High Court Judge"
"had dismissed that revision application. The Appellant has preferred this appeal"
"against that judgement and seeks to vacate same on the grounds urged by the"
"Appellant in the petition of appeal."
"O
ne of the grounds urged by the Appellant is that the learned Magistrate had"
"not appreciated the fact that the existing  building had been constructed in or"
"around 1988 in compliance with the then applicable Local Authority Regulations"
"and the construction was duly approved by the Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha. The"
"learned Magistrate erred in failing to appreciate the fact that once a building has"
"been  approved  under  the  existing 
regulations  of  the 
local  authority,  it 
is"
"unnecessary 
to 
reapprove 
the  construction  at  a 
future  date  when 
the"
"regulations are changed. The Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha had never intimated"
"to the Respondent (Urban Development Authority) that the said building is an"
"unauthorized structure which is  ought to be demolished. This  was one of the"
"main  grounds  urged  by  the  Appellant 
in  the  High  Court  as  well  as 
in  the"
"Magistrates’ Court."
"S
ection 28 (A) (3) of the Urban Development Authority Act reads as follows;"
"(a) 
Where  any  person  has 
failed 
to  comply  with  any  requirement"
"contained in any written notice issued under subsection (1) within the"
"time specified in the notice or within such extended time as may have"
"been granted by the Authority, the Authority may, by way of petition"
