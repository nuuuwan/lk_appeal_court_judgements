"where a Petitioner invokes the revisionary jurisdiction of court, as in the present"
"case before the High Court, the court expects  and insists  on uberrima fides. It"
"was so held in the case of Navaratnesingham Vs. Arumugam and another 1980"

"material facts. A material  fact is  something which is material for the Judge to"
"decide a case. In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd and others Vs. Mercantile"
"Hotel Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR at page 36 Atukorale J. stated as follows;"
"“…  a  misstatement  of  the  true  facts  by  the  Plaintiff  which  put  an  entirely"
"different complexion on the case as presented by him when the injunction was"
"applied  ex  parte  would  amount  to  a  misrepresentation  or  suppression  of"
"material facts warranting its dissolution without going into the merits.”"
