"after its decree has been set aside by the Supreme Court, confirms a"
"sale  held  in  execution  of  the  decree,  that  order  can  be  vacated.  It"
"would also clearly be a gross injustice that, whether by the default of the"
"Court or by the default of the plaintiff in applying for confirmation of the"
"sale,  property  which  the  Supreme  Court  intended  to  preserve  for  the"
"appellant should be taken away from her. In my opinion the case should"
"be remitted to the District Judge in order that he may cite all parties before"
"him and determine on what terms the application of the appellant for relief"
"should be granted. It is necessary,  I think, in this case, as the sale has"
"been  completed,  that  notice  should  be  given  to  the  Fiscal,  and  that  the"
"Court  should  determine  who  should  be  responsible  for  paying  the  fees"
"which the Fiscal has already received. The order confirming the sale, and"
"the  further  order  for  delivery  of  possession,  should  be  set  aside.  The"
"appellant is entitled to the costs of this appeal, and in the Court below."
"SCHNEIDER A.J.â€”I agree."
