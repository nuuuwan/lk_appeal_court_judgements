"However, the 1st Respondent has taken  up the position that if there is any wrong"
"done by an employee, the Cooperative Society has to initiate proceedings in terms"
"of Section 68 of the Cooperative Societies Law and not under Section 58 of the same."
"The  1st  Respondent  has  taken  up  the  position  that  the  instant  action  cannot  be"
"instituted and maintained under Section 59 of the Cooperative Societies Law, since"
"the said amount of money was not alone a liability. As such, the instant action could"
"have been filed under Section 68 of the Cooperative Societies Law as the said amount"
"of money was involved in a fraud, misappropriation or a criminal breach of trust. It"
"is apparent that the money misappropriated by the Respondent is clearly a deposit"
"on the business of this Society as referred to in Section 58."
"It is evident that the nature of the dispute referred  to in the instant action is not"
"limited to a debt owed to the Society by reason of a monetary loan."
"Therefore, it is observable that there is no legal basis for the learned Magistrate to"
"decide that the recovery procedure in Section 59 is limited to recovery of a loan."
"Hence, the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent is empowered to initiate action in"
"terms of Section 59 of the Cooperative Societies Law with regard to misappropriation"
"of funds."
"It is observable that if the instant matter  is referred under Section 68 and not in"
"terms  of  Section  59,  it  gives  rise  to  a  situation  where  the  Petitioner-Appellant"
"Society  would  not  be  able  to  recover  the  amount  of  money  indicated  in  the"
"certificate."
"It is to be noted that Section 68 [which is identical to Section 67 of the Co-Operative"
"Societies  Law  No.  05  of  1972]  provides  for  the  institution  of  proceedings  in  the"
"Magistrateâ€™s Court for Criminal Breach of Trust where the Magistrate is empowered"
"to imprison and/or fine any person accused of the same after the summary trial."
"Therefore, it is clear that proceedings under Section 68 are designed to hold a person"
"liable for a criminal offence and not designed to allow a complaint to recover the"
"money which has been misappropriated."
"On this premise, it clearly manifests that the Law itself is designed to permit two"
"actions in instances where misappropriation is involved. One action can be instituted"
"in  terms  of  Section  59  of  the  Co-Operative  Societies  Law  to  recover  the  loss  or"
