"By lodging within fourteen days from the time of such judgment or order being"

"Hence, it was the contention of the 1st Respondent that Rule 2 is only applicable to"
"final orders and that the impugned order delivered by the learned High Court Judge"
"upholding the preliminary objection is not a final order."
"In this respect, it is worthy to note the decision in  Pathirana Vs. Goonawardene"
"and others [CA PHC 16/2016], where it was observed that the Order of the High"
"Court was made upon an application made by the Petitioner to issue notice on the"
"Respondent.  It  was  held  that  although  the  Order  refusing  to  issue  notice  on  the"
"Respondents  finally  determined  the  matter,  if  the  High  Court  decided  to  issue"
"notice, the matter would not have been finally determined. On this basis, the Court"
"regarded  an  Order  refusing  to  issue  notice  as  an  interlocutory  order  that  did  not"
"come within the scope of Article 154(6) of the Constitution."
"In  the  instant  case,  if  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  overruled  the  preliminary"
"objection taken up by the Respondents, inquiry should proceed and the merits of"
"the application have to be determined."
"It was decided in the case of S.L.M. Naim Vs. Mohammed Naina Marikkar Haseeb"
"and Others [CA PHC 223/2006 decided on 28.02.2019] that there is no right of"
"appeal available against interim orders of the High Court."
"The impugned Order of the learned High Court Judge which this appeal is preferred"
"against is an interlocutory order. Thus, the Appellant is not entitled to invoke the"
"appellate jurisdiction of this Court."
"Be that as it may, it is relevant to note that the learned High Court Judge upheld"
"the preliminary objection and dismissed the revision application of the Petitioner in"
"limine, on the assumption that no exceptional circumstances exist for the Petitioner-"
"Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court."
"It  is  noteworthy  that  the  Petitioner-Appellant  in  paragraph  11  of  the  Petition  of"
"Appeal  had  stated  that  any  one  of  the  following  will  constitute  an  exceptional"
"circumstance."
