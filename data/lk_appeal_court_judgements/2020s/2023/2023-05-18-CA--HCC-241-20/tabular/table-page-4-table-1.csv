"The  accused  appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  against  the  conviction  and"
"sentence. Whilst this appeal was pending a Judge of the High Court in the course"
"of the proceeding in a case where the accused in that case was charged under"
"section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code, (identical offence with which the accused"
"was charged) submitted a reference to this Court in terms of Article 125 (1) of"
"the Constitution. In that reference the learned High Court Judge has posed the"
"question whether Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code as amended by Pen al Code"
"(amendment)  Act  No.22  of  1995  has  removed  the  judicial  discretion  when"
"sentencing an accused convicted for an offence punishable under section 364 (2)"
"(e) of the Penal Code."
"This reference was taken up for determination before a Bench of three Judges of"
"this  Court  on  29.07.2008  with  notice  to  the  Attorney  General  and  after"
"considering the submissions of the learned Senior State Counsel who appeared"
"as amicus curiae on behalf of the Attorney General, this Court pronounced its"
"determination  on  15.8.2008  on  the  question  submitted  to  it.  SC  Reference"
"3/2008,H.C.  Anuradhapura  Case  No.333/2004,  SCM  15.10.2008,  (reported in"
"2008 BLR in Part II – The Bar Association Law Journal (2008) vol. XIV, page 160)."
"The  unanimous  opinion  of  the  Court  in  that  determination  was  that  “the"
"minimum mandatory sentence in Section 362 (2) (e) Is in conflict with Article 4"
"(c), 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution and that the High Court is not inhibited"
"from imposing a sentence that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its judicial"
"discretion notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence”."
"This determination removed the knot of mandatory sentence which up to that"
"time tied hands pf the trial Judges with regard to the appropriate sentence to"
"be imposed in the circumstances of the particular case tried by them.”"
