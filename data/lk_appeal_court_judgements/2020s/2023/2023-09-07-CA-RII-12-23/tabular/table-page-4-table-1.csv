"respondents. Furthermore, while the counsel for the petitioner was supporting"
"the  case  he  reiterated  and  requested  the  court  to  grant  an  interim  order"
"judgment  dated 
(Prayer 
‘f’  of 
the  petition)  staying  the  operation  of  the"
"04.04.2013  and/or  the  Decree  Absolute  dated  24.02.2014  entered  in  the"
"Divorce 
case  bearing  No.  D/1555/2012  until 
the 
final  hearing  and"
"determination of this application."
"It is prima facie evident that the Decree Nisi and the Decree Absolute has been"
"entered, far back in 04.04.2013 and 24.02.2014 respectively. And thereby the"
"matter of concern at this juncture is to ascertain whether or not this Court"
"should grant the stay order."
"According to the submissions made by both parties on 26.07.2023 there are"
"two  ongoing  testamentary  cases.  One  testamentary  case  was  filed  by  the"
"petitioner’  and  deceased’s  daughter  at  the  District  Court  of  Colombo  (Case"
"Bearing  No.  165/2021/DTS)  seeking  a  Letter  of  Administration  concerning"
"the properties of the said deceased Upali Dassanayake. Another testamentary"
"case was filed by the respondent of the instant application at the District Court"
"of Kuliyapitiya (Case Bearing No. 812/T) seeking letter of Probate based on a"
"Last Will bearing No.3921 dated 30.07.2020 attested by K. Sumanasuriya N.P."
"However, this Court holds the view that the inheritance or succession of Late"
"Dissanayake's  estate  shall  be  determined  upon 
the  conclusion  of 
the"
"aforementioned testamentary action/s."
"Furthermore, another concern was raised over which party is entitled to claim"
"and  benefit  from  the  pension  of  the  late  Upali  Dassanayake.  During  the"
"submissions made by the counsel for the petitioner it was stated that upon"
"the  death  of  late  Upali  Dassanayake,  the  petitioner  had  exercised  her  legal"
"rights to claim the pension payment of the late Upali Dassanayake who served"
"as a Member of Parliament from 1987 - 1993. However, upon the application"
"made to the parliament, the petitioner states that she was informed that the"
"pension  payment  is  already  being  claimed  by  the respondent  of  the  instant"
"application  who  claims  to  state  she 
is  the 
legal  wife  of  the 
late  Upali"
"Dassanayake.  And  further  conceded  that  the  respondent  is  enjoying  the"
"benefit up to date."
