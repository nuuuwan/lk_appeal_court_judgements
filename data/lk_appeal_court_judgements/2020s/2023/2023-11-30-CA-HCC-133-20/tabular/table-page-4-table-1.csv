"supervening condition arising as a consequence of the injuries inflicted ,"
"and  also  of  the  supervening  condition  whether  it  is  sufficient  to  cause"
"death. This has been discussed, in Mendis vs The Queen 54 NLR 177."
"This theory of causation has been discussed in the case of Sumanasiri vs"
"Attorney General 1999 1 Sri LR 309 in which it has been held that  â€œAny"
"contravened issue relating to the theory of causation ought to be decided"
"according  to  rational  and  common  sense  theories.  Where  there  was  no"
"breach in the line of causation despite the fact that the surgical operation"
"performed at a time posterior to the infliction of the injury and at a point"
"of time anterior to the death, the offence is murder if the act is done with"
"the intention of causing murder."
"In the instant matter according to the dock statement made by the appellant it"
"reveals a back ground where the deceased and the appellant has been having a"
"lot of differences and the deceased has on many a occasion displayed suicidal"
"tendencies, which had been his defense right along and the trial judge had very"
"obviously chose to disregard the same which is a clear indication that the defense"
"of the appellant has not been considered at all and the trial judge appears to be"
"totally unaware of the theory of causation which has been discussed so vividly"
"in many of our decided cases when there is a supervening cause which has been"
"active at the time of the death of the deceased, and if it has over taken the original"
"cause , then the charge of murder is reduced to culpable homicide not amounting"
"to murder, if not it is murder."
"The appellant also has brought in several witnesses including the daughter of"
"the deceased and the appellant and she had corroborated the dock statement of"
"the appellant. The evidence of this witness also had not been considered by the"
"trial judge."
"The  farther  of  the  deceased  also  had  when  giving  evidence in  the  case  for  the"
"prosecution and had said that there were disputes between the appellant and"
"the deceased."
"Hence, we find that the trial judge had failed to give a fair trial to the appellant"
"which is in fact in the Constitution of the country. He had concluded that the"
"prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt long before he has"
"considered the defense case. (Page 239)"
"The appellant right along has taken up the defense that the deceased has had"
"an extra marital relationship and it had led to a lot of disputes between the two"
"but he had tolerated but on many occasions the deceased had attempted suicide"
"and the instant incident also is a matter of the same."
