"The  appellant  has  further  said  that  after  the  incident  he  had  feared  that  the"
"people  would  assault  him  because  all  the  neighbors  were  relations  of  the"
"deceased,  he had left the house and had been walking towards the police when"
"he had been taken and handed over to police by the prosecution witness Amila"
"Dharmaratne at page 84, who had said that the appellant had been walking on"
"the road and not running, but the trial judge had considered PW 2 who had said"
"that the appellant ran away after the incident which had been said in Court for"
"the first time."
"But as said before the trial judge had failed to consider the same but had whole"
"heartedly accepted the evidence of the prosecution without even considering the"
"infirmities  in  the  same  and  the  defense  put  forward  by  the  appellant  which"
"signals out a situation where the deceased has been having suicidal tendencies"
"of  which  the  appellant  has  spoken  to  very  lengthily  and  if  that  is  so  can  the"
"appellant  be  convicted  for  the  charge  in  the  indictment  or  of  a  lesser  charge,"
"especially in view of the medical evidence."
"The trial judge had concluded that the act by the appellant is premeditated but"
"he  has  failed  to  consider  the  position  of  the  appellant  in  the  dock  statement"
"which he has taken up right throughout the case, and even the daughter of the"
"appellant had spoken to the erratic behavior of the mother the deceased."
"The appellant had stated in his dock statement he had burnt himself in trying"
"to douse the fire which had been observed by the police that there were injuries"
"on the appellant."
"All these items have not been considered by the trial judge but of course he had"
"reproduced  chunks  of  evidence  led  by  the  prosecution  without  analyzing  the"
"same."
"Further more the prosecution had alleged that in the dying  declaration to the"
"police the deceased is supposed to have said that the appellant had brought the"
"inflammable substance in a bag in a bottle which was half cut from the top which"
"arouses the mind to think whether it is humanly possible to carry a substance"
"which is inflammable in a bag when the bottle is half open."
"The  police  had  recovered  the  said  bottle  from  the  scene  of  crime  and  the"
"Government Analyst had said it had contained petrol."
"But none of these possibilities and improbabilities have been considered by the"
"trial judge."
"Hence it is very clear that there had been an incident of fire on the fateful day"
"and the deceased had sustained burn injuries and that she had died of the sepsis"
"which had set in due to the burn injuries which shows that there had been a"
"supervening condition subsequent to the original issue."
