"But  what  Court  has  to  consider  is  whether  it  was  a  mere  likelihood  which  is"
"sufficient to cause death or not or whether it was suicide."
"The fact that whether it was suicide had been ruled out by the doctor who had"
"given  evidence  on  the  report  prepared  by  the  judicial  medical  officer  who  had"
"conducted the post mortem, hence suicide is ruled out."
"But the cause of death is a sepsis which has set in due to the burn injuries which"
"is according to the theory discussed above a supervening condition had set in"
"subsequent to the original cause."
"Hence there is no way that the judge could have found the appellant guilty for"
"murder. As such we are compelled to set aside the conviction for murder."
"Hence the next question is whether the appellant can be convicted for a lesser"
"offence under Section 297 of the Penal code."
"But in view of the improbabilities mentioned above and the unsafe evidence of"
"the prosecution witnesses and the medical evidence we are of the view that it is"
"not safe to find the appellant guilty even for a lesser offence not amounting to"
"murder."
"As such we are compelled to allow the instant appeal."
