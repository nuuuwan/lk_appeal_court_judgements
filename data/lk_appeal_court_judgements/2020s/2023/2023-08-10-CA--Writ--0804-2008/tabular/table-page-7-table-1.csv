"In  Samastha  Lanka  Nidahas  Grama  Niladhari  Sangamaya  Vs  Dissanayake1  Saleem"
"Marsoof J. held that,"
"“It is trite law that no court will issue a mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari or"
"mandamus where to do so would be vexatious or futile.”"
"Marsoof, PC. J (P/CA) in the case of Ratnasiri and others Vs Ellawala and others2 held"
"that;"
"""This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is empowered to grant"
"in these proceedings are not available as of right. Court has a discretion in regard to"
"the grant of relief in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time"
"and time again by our Courts that ""A writ... will not issue where it would be vexatious"
"or futile."""
"In the case of Siddeek Vs Jacolyn Seneviratne3 Soza J. observed that,"
"“The Court will have regard to the special circumstances of the case before it before"
"issuing a writ of certiorari. The writ of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end"
"result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.”"
"Vide; Rev. Nehinwela Piyadassi Thero Vs National Water Supply and Drainage Board4;"
"Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Vs Messrs Jafferjee & Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd.5; De"
"Silva Vs University Grants Commission6; P.S. Bus Co. Ltd. Vs Members and Secretary"
"of Ceylon Transport Board7; Pushpakumara Vs Lt. Commander Wijesuriya.8"
"In the case at hand, the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash P10, by which"
"the  PGIM  informed  the  Petitioner  that  he  had  failed  the  clinical  component  of  the"
"Diploma. Therefore, even if the Court decide to quash the decision mentioned in P10,"
"the decision taken by the PGIM to fail the Petitioner will remain unchanged. Therefore,"
"I hold that the relief sought in prayer (e) is futile."
