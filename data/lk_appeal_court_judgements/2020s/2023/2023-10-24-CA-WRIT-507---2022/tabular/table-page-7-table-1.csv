"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the revision of the age of retirement"
"to  63  years  was  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  as  the  appointing"
"authority. The age of retirement of the public sector is a matter of policy and the Cabinet of Ministers"
