"43)","It  is  specified,  when  the  parties  agreed  to  resolve  the  dispute  by  the"
"","arbitration  process,  court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  that"
"","action. As a statutory law, the Arbitration Act stipulates a remedy in Section"
"","5, such statutory remedy cannot be superseded by remedies available under"
"","other branches of law, including the Writ Jurisdiction."
"44)","In the instant action the State Counsel for the Respondent has brought this"
"","matter to the notice of the court with an objective to proceed with this case"
"","seeking relief under the Writ Jurisdiction."
"45)","In considering the relevant Sections of the Arbitration Act and Article 8 of"
"","the Power Purchase Agreement, I agree with the objection raised by the State"
"","Counsel for the Respondents that when there is an arbitration clause in an"
"","agreement and that objection is raised by a party, the court shall have no"
"","jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute arisen between the parties in"
"","respect of the agreement."
"46)","Thus, my considered view is in the Power Purchase Agreement both parties"
"","have  agreed  and  entered  Article  8  in  the  Power  Purchase  Agreement  to"
"","resolve their disputes by way of dispute resolution and arbitration."
