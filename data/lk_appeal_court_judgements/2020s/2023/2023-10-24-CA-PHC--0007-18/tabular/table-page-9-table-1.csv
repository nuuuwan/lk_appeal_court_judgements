"interpretation to section 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act on the basis"
"that it refers to an appeal or a revision application against an order of acquittal"
"whereas section 318 only refers to the filing of an appeal against an acquittal."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge was wrong when the application of the"
"petitioner was refused without its merits being considered to find out whether"
"there exists any basis to issue notices against the respondents mentioned."
"I find that if the application was considered in its correct perspective, there would"
"have  been  no  basis  for  the  appellant  to  get  the  notices  issued  against  the"
"respondents mentioned as the 1st accused-respondent had a legal right to obtain"
"the possession of the land purchased by her through a bank auction and there"
"was no evidence that she was trespassing on to the land under the possession"
"of the appellant. There was no basis for the charge to be maintained against the"
"2nd and the 3rd accused-respondents who were bank officials engaged in fulfilling"
"their official commitments."
"I find that the learned Additional Magistrate of Kandy was correct in dismissing"
"the action filed by the Katugasthota police against the accused-respondents as"
"the prosecution has failed to establish the charge against the said respondents."
"As I considered above, although the learned High Court Judge was misdirected"
"as  to  the  way  the  revision  application  filed  by  the  appellant  was  in  limine"
"dismissed, I am of the view that even if the revision application was considered"
"on its merit, there would have been no basis for the appellant to get the notices"
"issued to the accused-respondents mentioned."
"I am of the view that sending the case back to the relevant High Court for the"
"consideration of whether to issue notices or not on the merits of the application"
"would serve no purpose under the circumstances as I have considered above."
"For the above reasons considered, the appeal is dismissed, as it would serve no"
"purpose in maintaining the application filed before the Provincial High Court of"
"the Central Province Holden in Kandy any further."
