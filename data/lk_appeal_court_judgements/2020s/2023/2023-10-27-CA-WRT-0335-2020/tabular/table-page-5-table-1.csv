"Having considered the foregoing judicial literature, it is to be noted that"
"Writ jurisdiction and Fundamental Rights jurisdiction are two distinct"
"remedies  provided 
in  the  Constitution  to  an  aggrieved  party.  The"
"Petitioner has already invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the"
"Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court is looking into the grievance"
"of 
the  Petitioner 
from 
the  perspective  of  a  Fundamental  Rights"
"Application,  there  are  several  aspects  the  Court  can  consider.  The"
"Supreme Court exercises just and equitable jurisdiction with extremely"
"wide  power.  But,  when  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  looking  into  the  same"
"reliefs  under  Article  140  of  the  Constitution,  the  Court  is  exercising"
"discretionary, 
limited,  Writ 
jurisdiction.  When 
the  Petitioner  had"
"invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by way of a fundamental"
"rights application, that should be considered as an adequate remedy by"
"which  the  grievances  of  the  Petitioner  are  to  be  adjudicated.  In  those"
"circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that the Petitioner"
"is  precluded  from  invoking  the  Prerogative  Writs  jurisdiction  of  this"
"Court as he had already invoked the  Fundamental  Rights jurisdiction"
"of  the  Supreme  Court  in  respect  of  the  same  grievances.  Thus,  the"
"instant Writ application is liable to be dismissed in- limine."
"Be that as it may, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that"
"the Petitioner was not heard before issuing the impugned letters marked"
"P25 and P27. P25 is a letter dated 27-07-2020 written to the Petitioner"
"by the 1st Respondent wherein it has been stated that the Petitioner had"
"failed to accept the new duty list which has been given to him in respect"
"of  his  present  position,  namely 
“Archival  Officer”.  By  P27, 
the"
"Respondents  decided 
to 
temporarily  suspend 
the  payment  of 
the"
"increment which is due to the Petitioner for 06 months."
"There is no dispute to the fact that the Petitioner had refused to accept"
"the new duty list. This Cout is mindful of the fact that the Petitioner has"
"not  challenged  the  said  new  duty 
list  before  this  Court. 
In  those"
"circumstances,  there  is  no  option  to  the  Respondents  but  to  take"
"disciplinary action against the Petitioner for not accepting the new duty"
"list. 
It 
is  to  be  noted  that  the  Respondents  have 
imposed  minor"
"punishment  on 
the  Petitioner 
in 
terms  of 
the  provisions  of 
the"
"Establishments Code. As the Petitioner had refused to accept the new"
"duty 
list  without  any  basis  and  the  said  duty 
list  has  not  been"
"challenged by the Petitioner, hearing the Petitioner before issuing P25"
"and  P27  does  not  arise.  Moreover,  it  appears  to  this  Court  that,  the"
"punishment imposed on the Petitioner is not permanent in nature and"
"the  Petitioner  is  entitled  to  present  his  case  before  the  Respondents"
"before the said temporary decision is made absolute."
