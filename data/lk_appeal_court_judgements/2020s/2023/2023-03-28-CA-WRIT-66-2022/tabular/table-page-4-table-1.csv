"that  the  “Prior  consent”  required  by  section  2(1)(a)  of  the  TEWA  need  not  necessarily  be"
"contained in a single sheet of paper; it could be inferred from the attendant circumstances in"
"each  case.  Thus,  the  applicability  of  the  precedent  laid  down  by  those  judgements  to  the"
"instant Application need to be examined in the perspective of the true nature of the question"
"of the instant Application."
"The alleged consent expressed by the 5th Respondent to terminate his services based on the"
"provisions of the said Agreement would come into effect upon a notice by either party, will"
"be a significant issue in this case."
"Hence, a question arises in the instant Application, whether such consent on its own would"
"fulfil the requirement of obtaining the consent of the workman as stipulated in the Section 2"
"of  TEWA.  I  take  the  view  that  the  defence  of  the  5th  Respondent  is  also  need  to  be"
"considered when arriving at a conclusion of the relevant questions of the instant Application"
"but it is noted that the 5th Respondent was absent and unrepresented when this matter was"
"taken  up  for  support.  Although,  the  learned  State  Counsel  who  appears  for  the  1st  to  4th"
"Respondents  moves  that  the  instant  Application  be  dismissed  in  limine  at  the  threshold"
"stage, I take the view that the questions of the instant Application need to be assayed at a"
"trial hearing without prejudice to the stand taken by the Respondents."
"In  the  circumstances,  this  Court  should  fully  consider  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this"
"case  on  affidavits  at  a  final  hearing  after  issuing  formal  notice  of  this  Application  on  the"
"Respondents."
