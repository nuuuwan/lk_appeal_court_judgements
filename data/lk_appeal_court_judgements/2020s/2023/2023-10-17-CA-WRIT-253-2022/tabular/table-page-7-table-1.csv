"The general perception is that banks play a unique and pivotal role in the economy, with a"
"privileged  status  that  distinguishes  them  from  other  financial  institutions.  They  are  the"
"foundation  of  the  current  financial  environment,  providing  a safe  financial  atmosphere  for"
"individuals and corporations to store their assets, get credit, and conduct transactions. Lord"
"Denning M.R. in United Dominions Trust Ltd. v. Kirkwood (1966) 1 All.E.R.968 observed that:"
"“Bankers  are  a  privileged  class.  They  are  exempt  from  the  vexatious  restrictions  which  are"
"imposed  on  other  money  lenders.  They  are  an  exclusive  circle  to  which  entry  is  limited.  It  is"
"important that we should know what these privileges are; for we will see that Parliament when"
"granting them has never defined who is a banker.”"
"Although Lord Denning made this statement over half a century ago, his views can apply"
"even to the present-day economy. This is because banks are critical to the financial system's"
"stability, serving as intermediaries to secure the flow of capital and credit throughout society."
"As such the foreign currency reserve of a bank is vital right throughout their banking business."
"When the bank facilitates a borrower with foreign currency, the intention of such a bank under"
"normal circumstances may be to recover such loan in the same currency. This can be easily"
"identified  as  part  and  parcel  of  the  banking  business  through  which  the  bank  generates"
"revenue. If a borrower to whom the bank lends foreign currency defaults, the bank may need"
"to top up the foreign currency reserve by borrowing foreign currency from the local market at"
"the prevailing Forex rates as managing its foreign currency reserves is crucial to the business"
"of the bank."
"In  this sense,  if  one  assumes  that  the  1st Respondent  Bank  has  requested  the  Petitioners  to"
"settle the sum outstanding in the foreign currency loan on the date of resale (rather the date"
"the Bank received compensation) particularly in U.S. dollars, the Petitioners would still have"
"to deal with the same consequences because they would be required to purchase U.S. dollars"
"at the same exchange rate on the local market. The risks involved when dealing with foreign"
"currency would be common to a bank as well as to the borrower. However, my considered"
"view  is  that  no  party  to  an  agreement  should  engage  in  biased  practice  based  on  foreign"
"currency fluctuations and the principles of fairness are the guidelines to assess such biased"
