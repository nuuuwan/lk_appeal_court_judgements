"In light of the above, I take the view that the loans granted to the Petitioners by the Bank in"
"U.S. dollars are subject to foreign currency fluctuations when calculating the total outstanding"
"amount even though such fluctuations are not expressly laid down in the respective Mortgage"
"Bonds.  Undoubtedly,  recovery  of  any  additional  sum  due  to  the  application  of  foreign"
"currency fluctuation does not fall within the ambit of recovering costs under section 29L of"
"the said Act as claimed by the Petitioners since such provisions do not relate to loss of that"
"nature. The Bank at the time of auctioning the property and also at the purported resale (the"
"date of the receipt of compensation) has calculated the outstanding amount in reference to"
"the U.S. dollar loans, adopting the Forex rates prevailing on such specific dates. Moreover,"
"taking into consideration the overall circumstances of this case I cannot find any evidence"
"where the Bank has engaged in biased practice by adopting the Forex rates in calculating the"
"total sum outstanding."
"Whether it is lawful for the Bank to recover costs and expenses incurred by the Bank during the"
"period between the date of parate execution and the date of resale."
"Now I must advert to the second question involved in the instant Application. The Manager"
"- Special Assets Unit of the Peopleâ€™s Bank in his affidavit, which is annexed to the Statement"
"of Objections of the 1st to 3rd Respondents affirms that from the time the property was vested"
"with the 1st Respondent Bank until handing over the possession of the said property to the"
"State, the 1st Respondent incurred charges to maintain the property and the such charges are"
"recoverable in terms of section 29L1 of the said Act."
