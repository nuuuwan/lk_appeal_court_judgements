"debtor  to  declare  “freedom”  or  nonliability  provided  that  the  Bank  is  the  purchaser  at  the"
"auction."
"For the reasons said forth above, I hold that it is lawful for a bank to recover costs and charges"
"incurred by the bank even during the period between the date of parate execution and the date"
"of resale. Although I have arrived at the above conclusion I need to emphasize that such costs"
"should be calculated strictly in accordance with the provisions of section 29L. The Recovery"
"of  Loans  by  Banks  (Special  Provisions)  Act  No.4  of  1990  also  spells  out  almost  similar"
"provisions in its section 13. It is important to examine the provisions of section 29L of the Act"
"by  breaking  those  provisions  into  several  limbs.  During  such  an  exercise,  it  can  be  easily"
"assumed  that  a  bank  is  entitled  only  to  recover  all  moneys  expended  by  the  Bank,  in"
"accordance with the Mortgage Bond,"
"i.) in the payment of premiums and other charges in respect of any policy of insurance"
"effected on the property mortgaged to the Bank, and"
"ii.) in the payment of all other costs and charges authorized to be incurred by the Bank,"
"under the covenants contained in such mortgage bond"
"iii.) the costs of advertising the sale and of selling the mortgaged property; (provided"
"that the costs incurred under this shall not exceed such percentage of the loan as may,"
"from time to time, be fixed by resolution of the Board.)"
"iv.) all moneys paid to the State by the Board of the Bank as moneys due to the State"
"by the Board on a surrender mentioned in section 29L(c)."
"The above first limb relates to a policy of insurance while the third limb deals with selling the"
"mortgage property. What is applicable to the issue in hand is the above second limb which"
"describes certain costs and charges. However, the Bank under the said second limb would not"
"be able to recover costs and charges unless such costs and charges are mandatorily authorized"
"to  be  incurred  by  the  Bank  beforehand,  under  the  covenants  contained  in  such  Mortgage"
"Bonds. The contents of the fourth limb are not applicable to the particular issues of this case."
"At this stage, I must advert to the Statement of Accounts reflected in “1R1” wherein the Bank"
"raises a claim of 5,990,000/- LKR as charges recoverable under section 29L. I am afraid that"
