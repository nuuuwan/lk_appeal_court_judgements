"As opposed to such a stance of the Bank, the Petitioners referring to section 29N(1) argue that"
"once the certificate of sale is issued all the rights, title, and interest of the debtor to and in the"
"property shall vest in the purchaser. The Bank heavily relying on the provisions of section 29L"
"claims that all moneys expended by the Bank including the payment of all costs and charges"
"authorized  to  be  incurred  by  the  Bank,  under  the  covenants  contained  in  the  respective"
"Mortgage Bonds can be recovered by the Board of the Bank in addition to the amount due on"
"any  loan.  The  Petitioners'  contention  in  this  regard  is  that  the  costs  incurred  between  the"
"original sale and the resale do not fall within the scope of the provisions of section 29L."
"On a careful perusal of the provisions of section 29N(1) 2, it implies that there is no ambiguity"
"on the conclusive effect of a certificate of sale when transferring the rights, title and interest of"
"the debtor in respect of the property to any purchaser. What needs to be noted in the instant"
"Application is that the purchaser referred to here is the Bank and not a third party purchaser."
"The  Bank  purchased  the  property  as  there  were  no  bidders  at  the  auction.  In  view  of  the"
"recovery process laid down in the Act, when the purchaser is the respective bank, the effective"
"process of recovering the loan does not cease at the time a certificate of sale is issued in favor"
"of such bank. This is because the bank would not be indemnified at that point and the bank"
"may properly be compensated, in such an instance, only at the stage of resale. This scenario"
"may be different when the purchaser is anybody other than the bank."
"The scheme of the recovery process stipulated in the Act is to provide a speedy mechanism to"
"recover  the  total  outstanding  at  any  stage  of  such  process  probably  even  until  the  date  of"
"resale. The Petitioners in the instant Application have failed to repay the outstanding within"
"the time period stipulated in the Mortgage Bond.  Moreover, they have not made an attempt"
"to purchase the property at the auction or at any time before the purported resale/acquisition"
"of property by the State. Hence, I take the view that the provisions in section 29N(1) by which"
"the rights, title and interest of the debtor vested in the purchaser, will not be a proxy for the"
"2 Section 29N -"
"“(1) If the mortgaged property is sold, the Board shall issue a certificate of sale and thereupon all the rights,"
"title, and interest of the debtor to and in the property shall vest in the purchaser; and thereafter it shall not be"
"competent for any person claiming through or under any disposition, whatsoever, of the right, title or interest"
"of the debtor to and in the property made or registered subsequent to the date of the mortgage of the property"
"to the Bank, in any court to move or invalidate the sale for any cause whatsoever, or to maintain any right title"
"or interest to or in the property as against the purchaser.”"
