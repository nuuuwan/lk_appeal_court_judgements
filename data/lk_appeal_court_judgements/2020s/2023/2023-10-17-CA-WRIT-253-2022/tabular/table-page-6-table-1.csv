"sterling  was  discounted  prior  to  payment,  while  the  Nigerian  pound  preserved  its  value."
"Despite the sellers' promise to accept pounds sterling in the discharge of the buyer's abilities,"
"the House of Lords held that the money of account was still Nigerian currency. Although this"
"Court is not bound by the dicta of the said case at this instance, the following pronunciation"
"of Lord Pearson in the said judgment is vital:"
"“Although commercial men may not be familiar with the terminology of the distinction between"
"“money of account"" and “money of payment,” they must be very familiar with the difference"
"between  “price”  and  “terms  of  payment,”  which  are  the  usual  headings  in  a  sale  of  goods"
"contract."""
"I am unable to make a specific focus in this judgment on ‘money of account’ and ‘money of"
"payment’  in  relation  to  the  aforesaid  Mortgage  Bonds  Nos.  3330  and  1091  as  neither  the"
"Petitioners nor the Bank has tendered to Court the copies of the respective Mortgage Bonds."
"However, I have considered the facts and circumstances of this case relating to this area of"
"law through the pleadings and submissions of both the learned Counsel. It can be assumed"
"that the absence of any reference to foreign currency fluctuations in the respective Mortgage"
"Bonds is an admission between both the Petitioners and the Bank."
"I am aware that the effects of exchange rate volatility are common to international trade and"
"any bank transaction carried out in foreign currency. Depending on the state of the economy,"
"the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  occasionally  permits  floating  foreign  exchange  or"
"stabilizes  it.  The  correlation  between  such  volatility  and  trade  may  cause  profits  or  losses"
"during  the  business  and  such  volatility  cannot  be  controlled  by  a  single  bank.  Therefore,"
"foreign currency fluctuation should be considered as a norm within the trade carried out in"
"foreign currency and the exception thereto is explicitly restraining from the applicability of"
"such fluctuations. Thus, if the parties to any such contract do not wish to be bound by foreign"
"currency  fluctuations  they  should,  in  my  view,  explicitly  declare  such  conditions  in  the"
"respective  agreement  but  not  vice  versa.  Therefore,  the  absence  of  a  clause  specifically"
"incorporating the applicability of foreign currency fluctuations in a contract or a mortgage"
"bond  would  not  excuse  any  of  the  parties  from  the  risk  of  incurring  losses  due  to  such"
