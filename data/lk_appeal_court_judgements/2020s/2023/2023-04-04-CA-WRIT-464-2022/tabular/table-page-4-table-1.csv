"verdict. The Clause 9.1.5 of Circular 'R1' provides applicants an opportunity to submit a"
"reapplication to the Principal when his/her application has been rejected while there are"
"necessary  qualifications.  Anyhow,  such  applicants  are  not  permitted  to  annex  to  the"
"reapplication anything other than the documents forwarded with previous application. It"
"seems  that  the  said  provisions  do  not  restrain  any  discretion  of  the  Principal  or  the"
"interview board to summon or inspect voluntarily any material to clarify a particular issue"
"upon which the interview board has not arrived at a final conclusion."
"The main grievance of the Petitioner is that the document which discloses the relationship"
"between the Petitioner and her grandmother has not been considered when evaluating the"
"reapplication."
"At this stage, I must examine the role and the duty of the Principal and the interview board"
"and also of an appeal board which evaluate reapplications/appeals of the parents whose"
"applications have been rejected. It is no doubt that in terms of 'R1', a party can appeal, as"

"submitted for reconsideration under the said Clause 9.1.5, as of right."
"A decision is 'final' if it would determine the entire proceedings whichever way the court"
"decided the issues before it. Further, a decision is treated as final where it is made at the"
"conclusion of part of a hearing or trial which has been split into parts and would, if made"
"at  the  conclusion  of  that  hearing  or  trial,  be  a  final  decision  because  it  determines  the"
"entirety of that part of the claim. (vide- Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals)"
"Order 2000, art.1(2)(c) & art.1(3) in England). Hence, a reasonable question arises whether"
"the two reasons adduced by the interview board in 'P15' can be considered as final. In such"
"a backdrop, it appears that both such reasons are not in the nature of a final order but mere"
"decisions which need additional material to arrive at a final conclusion."
"The criteria adopted in Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code of Sri Lanka is very much"
