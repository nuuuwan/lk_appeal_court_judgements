"additional  material  to  establish  the  nexus  between  the  applicant  and  her  grandmother."
"Based on the above approach taken by me in this judgement, I take the view that this Court"
"should not consider the other reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner at this stage. I need to"
"emphasize that I have arrived at the above conclusions based on the special circumstances"
"of the nature of the reapplication submitted by the Petitioner and on the specific reasons"
"given  by  the  interview  board  as  reflected  in  'P15'  and  'P20'  which  are,  to  my  mind,"
"exclusive to the Petitioner of the instant Application. Thus, the Respondents' assertions"
"on the requirement of necessary parties need not be examined at this stage."
"The  Respondents  relying  on  the  judgment  of  Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs."
"Messrs. Jafferiee & Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 89, submits that the Court should"
"not grant a mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but purely equitable nature.  I take"
"the view that I have arrived at the above conclusion not on Petitioner's rights of equitable"
"nature but clearly on the basis that the Petitioner's legal rights have been violated as the"
"interview board has failed to duly exercise their appellate jurisdiction. Similarly, there is"
"no requirement for me to assay the Respondents' arguments on the legitimate expectation"
"of the Petitioner as I have not focused my above findings on that aspect."
"Application is partly allowed."
