"On analysing this excerpt, we are of the view that the learned High Court Judge"
"has rightly considered the dock statement and their Defence. We hold that the learned"
"Trial  Judge  has  correctly  concluded  that  the  dock  statement  has  not  created  any"
"reasonable doubt in the evidence of the Prosecution."
"Additionally, the Accused has not been successful in establishing any of the limbs"
"set out in the dictum of Shah J. in the case of Kirpal Singh v The State of Uttar Pradesh"
"AIR (1965) SC 712, which was insisted upon by our courts. For the purpose of convenience,"
"it is pertinent to set out the said dictum of Shah J;"
"""
The conclusion recorded by the Court of First Instance and affirmed by the High"
"Court  is  based  upon  appreciation  of  evidence  and  no  question  of  law  arises  therefrom."
"Normally this Court does not proceed to review the evidence in appeals in criminal cases,"
"unless  the  trial is  vitiated  by  some  illegality or  irregularity  of  procedure  or  the  trial  is"
"held in a manner violative of the rules of natural justice resulting in an unfair trial or"
"unless the judgment under appeal has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice. """
"Considering  the  same,  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  Accused  has  failed  to"
"satisfy us of any such gross miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere"
"with the judgment dated 03.05.2017. The conviction and the sentence are affirmed, and"
"the appeal is accordingly dismissed."
