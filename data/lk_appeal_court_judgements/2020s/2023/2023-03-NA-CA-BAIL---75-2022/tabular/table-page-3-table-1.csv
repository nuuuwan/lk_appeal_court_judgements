"The Counsel appearing for the respondents objected to the application."
"The investigations are not yet over."
"The law pertaining to this matter is that a suspect produced and remanded"
"under this act can be granted bail only upon exceptional circumstances by"
"the Court of Appeal, and the term exceptional has not been defined in the"
"act but our legal literature has held that exceptionality has to be determined"
"by the facts of each case."
"Upon considering the submissions of both parties it is the considered view"
"of this Court  that the suspect pertaining to this matter should be enlarged"
"on bail and as such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct"
"the learned Magistrate to enlarge the suspect on suitable conditions of bail."
