"The  main  contention  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  gazette  notification  [P4]  is  ultra"
"vires, null and void and ex facie illegal. In view of the North Western Provincial Council"
"Statute No. 01 of 1990, the said gazette notification is void and of no force or avail in"
"law  within  the  North  Western  Province  in  as  much  the  provisions  of  the  Municipal"
"Council Ordinance referred to therein cannot be invoked by those bound and governed"
"by the aforementioned statute.  Thus, P4 had not been promulgated in terms of the"
"North Western Provincial Council Statute No. 01 of 1990."
