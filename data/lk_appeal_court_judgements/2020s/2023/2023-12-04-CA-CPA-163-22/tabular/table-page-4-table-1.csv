"The  indictment  has  been  served  on  the  respondent  on  27-04-2021  and  the"
"matter has gone down several dates for the parties to consider concluding the"
"matter without going for a trial."
"However, since it had not been materialized, on 05-11-2021, the case has been"
"fixed for trial for 04-04-2022, and the summons had been issued to PW-01."
"When the matter came up for trial on the mentioned day, PW-01 had been absent"
"and the prosecuting State Counsel has moved for the postponement of the trial"

"learned  High  Court  Judge  when  the  above  application  was  made  by  the"
"prosecuting state counsel, as this revision application is based on the entirety of"
"the said order."
