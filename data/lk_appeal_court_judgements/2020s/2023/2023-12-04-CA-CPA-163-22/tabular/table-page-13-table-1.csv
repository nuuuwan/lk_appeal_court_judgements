"I am of the view that there was no reason for the learned High Court Judge to"
"consider that as a punitive measure to conclude that no summons report had"
"been filed. I am of the view that even if there was no summons report, there was"
"no  justification  for  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  to  discharge  the  respondent"
"since this was the 1st date fixed for the trial and the learned prosecuting State"
"Counsel has given a valid reason as to why he is seeking a postponement of the"
"trial."
"The considered section seven of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is the section"
"where  decisions  can  be  taken  when  there  are  no  special  provisions  as  to  the"
"criminal procedure made by the Code or any other law for the time being in force."
"However, such steps have to be taken as the justice of the case may require and"
"not inconsistent with the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. I am of the view that"
"the  Justice  refers  to  in  this  section  has to  be  considered  in relation  to  justice"
"towards an accused person as well as the prosecution who took pain to file an"
"indictment  against  an  accused  person  requiring  the  Court  to  decide  on  the"
"charge or charges against him based on the evidence placed before the Court. If"
"the Court is to discharge such an accused even without reading the indictment"
"over  to  him  and  requiring  him  to  plead  to  the  charge  on  the  basis  that  the"
"summons had not been served on PW-01, I do not see any reason to conclude"
"that justice has been served."
"It appears that the learned High Court Judge was well aware that no procedural"
"steps have been mentioned in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to discharge"
"an  accused  person  indicted  before  a  High  Court  when  the  prosecution  is  not"
"ready to prosecute the action. It is under that pretext that the learned High Court"
"Judge has decided to consider the cited two  Judgements and section 7 of the"
"Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  as  relevant  to  justify  the  discharge  of  the"
"respondent."
