"jury-man, he must direct an acquittal."
"Having considered the facts and the law in relation to the Judgements cited by"
"the learned High Court Judge to justify his decision to discharge the respondent,"
"I have no option but to agree with the submissions of the learned SDSG that the"
"said cited Judgements have no direct bearing to the facts of the matter and the"
"learned High Court Judge was misdirected in that regard."
"I am of the view that the learned High Court Judgeâ€™s reliance on the cited section"
"7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to justify the discharge was also a clear"
"misdirection."
"The cited Attorney General Vs. Gunawardane (Supra)  was a case where the"
"accused  person  has  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charge  and  was  acquitted  after"
"hearing part of the evidence relating to the charge on the basis that the charge"
"cannot be maintained even if the remaining evidence were to be led."
"The cited Attorney General Vs. Baranage (Supra) was a case where the accused"
"was  acquitted  after  the  prosecution  case  was  closed  without  calling  a  defence"
"from the accused."

"taken up. Since the prosecution witness number 01 summoned for that day was"
"not  served  with  the  summons,  the  prosecuting  State  Counsel  has  sought  an"
"adjournment of the trial on that basis. Although the learned High Court Judge"
"has concluded that the prosecution failed to file the summons report before 3"
"days of the date fixed for the trial, in fact it appears that the relevant summons"
"report was available, but not within the considered 3 days before the date fixed"
"for the trial."
