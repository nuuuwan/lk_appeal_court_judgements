"The  question  that  needs  consideration  of  this  Court  is  whether  the  suspension  of  the"
"services  and  the  payment  of salary  of  the  Petitioner  are  rational.  The contention  of  the"
"Petitioner is that the said temporary suspension is inter alia ultra vires, unreasonable and"
"irrational as it has been done without any hearing and giving reasons."
"Based on the circumstances of this case, I take the view that it is fit and proper to be guided"
"by the rationale adopted in some provisions of the University Establishment Code (‘Code’)"
"in order to determine the issues of this case. I must draw my attention to Chapter XXII of"
"the  Code  which  deals  with  disciplinary  procedure.  The  Section  18  of  Chapter  XXII"
"illustrates rule on Interdiction and Compulsory Leave."
