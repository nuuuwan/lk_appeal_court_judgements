"Respondents  have  failed  to  demonstrate  to  this  Court  that  Circular  P5  was  a  result  of  the"
"negotiations the trade union had with the management pertaining to the extension of the age limit."
"In any event, it is trite law that the Writ court will be reluctant to act when material facts are in"
"dispute."
"Accordingly, in view of the contradictory nature of the evidence given by the 4th Respondent and"
"his witness, and in the absence of any reference to demonstrate that the extension was granted as"
"a  result  of  negotiation  this  Court  finds  that  there  is  no  sufficient  material  to  establish  that  the"
"Managementâ€™s decision to increase the retirement age to 58 was done on a request of the trade"
"union with the consent of the employees, which makes the said decision also a unilateral decision."
"Thereafter,  the  parties  are  not  at  variance  that  the  Management  unilaterally  took  a  decision  to"
"reduce the retirement age to 55.  In the given circumstances, the safest conclusion to come to is"
"that  both  decisions  reflected  in  P5  and  P6  have  been  taken  unilaterally  by  the  Management"
"subsequent to the employee entering into his contract of employment. Hence the Commissioner"
"erred when he held that the first amendment pertaining to the retirement age, as reflected in P5,"
"was made at the request of the trade union with the consent of both the employer and employee"
"and that there is an offer and acceptance which constitutes a valid agreement that is lacking in P6."
"It is also pertinent to note that if the decision in P5 was taken as a result of negotiations between"
"the trade union and the employer, it was incumbent on the trade union to secure the said decision"
"into the contract of employment of the employees by way of an addendum or by entering into a"
"collective agreement. However, in the absence of such and especially as per the wording of P5,"
"the  only  conclusion  this  Court  can  come  to  is  that  P5  is  a  unilateral  decision  taken  by  the"
"Management."
"It is also pertinent to note that this Court finds as stated above in this judgment, that there is no"
"material by way of documentary evidence to substantiate that the increase of the age of retirement"
"13"
