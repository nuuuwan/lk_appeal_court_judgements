"In the said letter there is no provision to seek for an extension of services. It is not disputed that"
"the 4th Respondent had requested an extension of services upon reaching  his retirement age. In"
"seeking  an  extension  of  services  by  X2(d),  it  appears  the  4th  Respondent  too  has  acted  under"
"Circular P6 as it is only by the said Circular, provisions were made to reduce the retirement age to"
"55 and also granted an employee the opportunity to seek extensions until he reaches the age of 57."
"However, this is subject to an evaluation of his performance, and the exclusive discretion to grant"
"an extension or not is vested with the Management.  Thus, in our view, the 4th Respondent himself"
"had  submitted  himself  to  P6  and  accepted  the  terms  and  conditions  of  P6  when  he  utilized  its"
"provisions  and  sought  an  extension.  This  letter  has  been  replied  to  on  21.03.2012,  where  the"
"Management has declined to grant the said extension (X2e),"
"“We refer to your appeal dated 01st March 2012 with regard to the above and regret to inform"
"you that the management has not considered your appeal favorably"
"Hence,  your  retirement  date  will  be  11th  September  2012  and  you  are  requested  to  utilize"
"accumulated Annual Leave prior to retirement”"
