"(ii) any contract of employment wherein the age of retirement of such workman is expressly"
"stipulated; or"
"A
ccordingly, it was the contention of the Petitioner that as per the Letter of Appointment and as"
"per P6, the retirement age of the 4th Respondent is specified and therefore, since the 4th Respondent"
"has reached retirement age there could not have been an inquiry under TEWA."
"A
s per section 3 of the Act, it is clear that the provisions of the Act will not apply if  it falls under"
"any of the conditions enumerated in section 3(1). As per section 3 (1) (c) (II), the operation of the"
"Act is excluded in circumstances where a workman’s contract of employment expressly stipulates"
"the  age  of  retirement.  The  contract  of  employment  X2(a)  specifically  stipulates  the  age  of"
"retirement to  be  55. Thus,  as  stated  elsewhere  in  this  judgment,  when  Circulars  P5  and  P6  are"
"unilateral Circulars, they cannot attract any legal relationship between the employer and employee."
"Hence  what  prevails  is  the  contract  of  employment  which  is  X2(a).  Therefore,  in  the  given"
"circumstances, this Court is inclined to agree with the Petitioner’s contention on the applicability"
"of TEWA."
"S
uppression of material facts"
"Even though the Respondents raised the objection under the suppression of  material  facts, their"
"main  contention  was  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  annex  the  entire  proceedings.  This  Court"
"observes that the Petitioner has pleaded that if the need arises, they be permitted to annex further"
"documents. Especially in prayer (b) and paragraph 10 of the petition. This position is admitted by"
"the Respondents as well.  However, with the objections, the Respondents have submitted the entire"
"copy of the proceedings."
"In the said circumstances, the Court has been furnished with the entire copy of the proceedings. In"
"the  submission  of  the  learned  Counsel,  he  has  failed  to  pursue  the  said  objection  nor  has  he"
"submitted to this Court as to the other relevant material that has been suppressed for the proper"
"adjudication  of  this  case.  Accordingly,  we  are  not  inclined  to  accept  the  said  objection.  The"
"Respondents have failed to substantiate the rest of the objections to the satisfaction of this Court."
