"Thereby the said decision is in violation of the provisions of the Termination of Employment of"
"Workman’s Act. Thus, it amounts to a termination."
"Can the contract of employment be changed unilaterally?"
"This  Court observes  that  once  a  Letter of  Appointment  is  accepted,  there  is  a  binding  contract"
"between  the  parties  as  the  offer  by  the  employer  has  been  accepted  by  the  employee.  Hence  a"
"unilateral change cannot be accepted."
"In Sascon knitting company (PVT) Ltd. Vs Commissioner General of Labour and other SC"
"Appeal 52/2014 decided on 7.8.2020.   it was held that “The specific terms of employment agreed"
"to  by  the  employee  cannot  and  should  not  be  varied  many  years  after  unilaterally  by  an"
"employer.” The parties are not at variance that as per the original Letter of Appointment which is"
"the  contract  of  employment,  the  retirement  age  of  an  employee  is  55  years.  However,  in  this"
"instance, the term of retirement which is a term of employment in the contract of employment has"
"been changed subsequent to the acceptance of the said contract by the employee. We observe the"
"retirement age has been changed not once but twice. The 4th Respondent employee has no objection"
"pertaining to the  first change  but the agitation  lies against the 2nd change. The  first change was"
"effected by Circular P5 which increased the retirement age, while the second change is done by"
"Circular P6 which reduced the age back to the pre-P5 position, that is to bring down the retirement"
"age to 55 years which is also the retirement age depicted in the Letter of Appointment. Thus, the"
"question  arises  as  to  whether the  first  amendment  was  also  made  unilaterally  or  made  with the"
"agreement of both parties."
"In response, the Respondents contended that over a period of time, the trade union to which the 4th"
"Respondent belonged, had agitated for better facilities for the employees of the Petitioner. One of"
"their main contentions was to increase the retirement age to 58 years.  Hence, they argued that as"
"a result of their agitation and in consultation with them, the Management had agreed to increase"
"the age of retirement to 58 years and released the Circular increasing the age of retirement to 58."
