"to 58 was done by obtaining the consent of the employees. In the absence of such materials, the"
"said extensions too cannot be considered to create a legally valid contract between the parties in"
"the absence of an offer and acceptance."
"It is apposite to note that as per the 4th Respondent’s original Letter of Appointment, which is a"
"binding contract of two parties, the employee’s retirement age is specifically stated as 55.  The act"
"of the Petitioner to send the 4th Respondent on retirement upon reaching the age of 55 will  not"
"violate the original terms of the contract.  It is also pertinent to observe that in the absence of any"
"documentary evidence to demonstrate that the enhancement of the retirement age was done with"
"the agreement of the employee, the said enhancement also would not attract any legality."
"Legitimate expectation to work till 58"
"The 4th Respondent argued that in view of P5, he had a legitimate expectation to work till 58 years."
"It was also contended that the said Respondent had obtained loans with that expectation."
"However, the 4th Respondent has failed to demonstrate with documentary evidence that with this"
"legitimate expectation to work beyond 55, he has obtained loans and other facilities during the said"
"period. The said period is between the issuance of P5 and P6 which is roughly around 6 months."
"In fact, under cross-examination, the 4th Respondent has specifically said he has not attempted to"
"obtain any loans during this period."
