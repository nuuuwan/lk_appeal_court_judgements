"the final step of the said process will be to forward the Gazette Notification to the Parliament"
"by the line ministry and that is also required only if the main statute provides for the necessity"
"of the sanction of the Parliament."
"I
n light of the above and on a careful consideration of the language embraced by the Section"
"20(3), I am not inclined to accept the Petitioner's argument that the Regulations made under"
"the relevant Act should be published immediately after endorsement by the Minister for such"
"Regulations to become effective. It is no doubt that such Regulations should be mandatorily"
"published by way of a Gazette Notification, perhaps on a later date.  I have arrived at this"
"conclusion as the relevant Act or the Regulations 'X4' does not illustrate the requirement of"
"immediate publication of the Regulations by way of a Gazette Notification. At the same time,"
"I  observe  that  the  provisions  of  Section  20(3)  do  not  specifically  provide  that  the  required"
"publication should be via a Gazette Notification or any other mode of publication since the"
"word 'such' (or its) is not seen immediately before the word 'publication' as usually adopted"
"by other Acts of Parliament in their respective provisions."
"A
t this stage, I must draw my attention to certain formats used by the legislature in different"
"Acts of Parliament when delegating power to make subordinate legislation. The respective"
"provisions  used  in  National  Housing  Development  Authority  Act  No.  17  of  1979,  Urban"
"Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended), Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of"
"2017 (as amended), Finance Act No. 35 of 2018, Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 (as"
"amended) and Customs Ordinance are similar to Section 20(3) of the Act to a certain extent."
"However,  in  those  provisions  the  mode  of  publication  is  the  publication  of  a  Gazette"
"Notification, whereas in Section 20(3) it is not specified by omitting the word 'such' or 'its'"
"immediately before the word 'publication'."
"Section 76(3) of National Housing Development Authority Act No. 17 of 1979;"
"'Every  regulation  made  by  the  Minister  shall  be  published  in  the  Gazette  and  shall"
"come into operation on the date of such publication or on such later date as may be"
"specified in the regulation'."
