"Now, I must advert to the other main argument of the Petitioner that the Parliament has not"
"approved the Gazette Notification 'X4' within a period of one month. The Section 20(4) of"
"the Act requires the Regulations made by the Minister to be brought before Parliament within"
"a period of one month from the date of the publication of that Regulations under Section 20(3)"
"of  the  Act.  As  I  have  mentioned  earlier,  there  is  an  ambiguity  in  respect  of  the  mode  of"
"publication described in the said Section 20(3). To my mind, in view of Section 20(3) of the"
"Act,  there  is  a  possibility  for  any  person  to  raise  an  argument  that  the  publication  should"
"mandatorily be by way of a Gazette Notification and at the same time one may argue that the"
"publication could be by way of an electronic form of the Gazette in an appropriate website."
