"obstruct  the  access-road  in  dispute.  On  the  same  day  the  learned  District  Judge  made  an"
"order adding the 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent as a party to the said District Court"
"action."
"As such, the learned Magistrate had come to the conclusion that although concreted segment"
"of the road is 4 feet wide, before the construction commenced the Respondent had been using"
"a ‘7 feet wide’ road way."
"Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant had filed a revision"
"application in the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy."
"The learned High Court Judge has refused the revision application of the Appellant on the"
"ground that the order of the Primary Court Judge does not disclose any grounds of failure of"
"justice or any error of law or fact warranting the revision of the same."
"Subsequently the Appellant has preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal against the order"
"of the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 05.01.2017."
"The Appellant contended that the indenture of lease being no 4058 [1R1] and plan bearing"
"12998 [1R2] do not indicate that Respondent is entitled to a common right to use a 7 feet"
"wide access road to the shop premises. It is to be observed that, the said 1R1 and 1R2 do not"
"indicate the width of the roadway as 4 feet wide."
"It is imperative to note that the Appellant does not deny the access road to the Respondent’s"
"shop premises. Nevertheless, denies the width of the road. Therefore, the only question to be"
"determined by this Court is whether the Respondent has been using a ‘4 feet’ wide roadway"
"or a ‘7 feet’ wide road way."
"In  this  instance  court  draws  the  attention  to  the  case  of  Nandawathie and Another Vs"
"Mahindasena [2009] S.L.R. 218  cited by the learned counsel for the Respondent where it"
"was held that,"
