"is embodied in Clause III of the PE Circular.  Thus, I take the view that the said question"
"should be duly examined in CA/Writ/114/2021 for the best interest of justice and for the"
"fuller and proper adjudication of the said Application."
"Having considered the main questions pertaining to the instant Application what remains"
"to  be  considered  is  whether  a  deep  evaluation  is  necessary  regarding  the  Respondents'"
"objections.  The  Respondents  among  other  objections  resist  the  maintainability  of  the"
"instant  Application.  One  such  is  that  no  writ  lies  upon  the  alleged  grievances  of  the"
"Petitioner as those emanating from the contract of employment entered into between the"
"Petitioner and the NITF. However, it is important to note that this court has constantly"
"decided, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal has the discretionary power to exercise writ"
"jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a contract of employment if the disciplinary"
"order  of  a  public  authority  was  in  breach  of  statutory  restrictions/provisions2.  I  am"
"convinced  that  all  such  issues  in  relation  to  breach  of  statutory  restrictions  have  been"
"considered above and thus, there is no necessity to assay this objection as well as the other"
"objections which are in preliminary nature."
"In the circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed"
"for in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant application."
"Application is dismissed."
