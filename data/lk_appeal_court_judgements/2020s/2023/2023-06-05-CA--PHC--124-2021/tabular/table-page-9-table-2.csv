"In  G.K.D. Stephan Gunaratne v Maddumage Thushara Indika Sampath  CA  (PHC)  APN"
"54/2013 decided on 23.09.2013, A. W. A. Salam J. held that,"
"‘It is well-settled law that a thing that cannot be done directly, cannot be allowed to be"
"done  indirectly.  The  petitioner  to  the  present  application  in  my  opinion  is  seeking  to"
"impugn the judgment delivered by the learned High Court Judge in an indirect manner"
"than provided for in the law, which he cannot achieve directly by reason of his right to"
"challenge the propriety of the said judgment in the Supreme Court by way of a direct"
"appeal. Further, if the petitioner is held to enjoy such a right, a judgment pronounced on"
"the revision application would be appealable to the Supreme Court in terms of  Article"
"127  of  the  Constitution.  This  would  undoubtedly  lead  to  absurdity  and  above  all,  the"
"petitioner will have a second bite at the cherry, which is not available to a person who"
"has already exercised the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.’"
