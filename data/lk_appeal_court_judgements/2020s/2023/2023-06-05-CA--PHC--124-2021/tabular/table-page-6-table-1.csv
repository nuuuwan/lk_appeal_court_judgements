"civil appellate jurisdiction under section 5A of the said Act. Thus, it appears that a specific"
"remedy is provided by the said Act itself."
"A plain reading of section 11(1) of the said Act that a revision lies against ‘all causes, suits,"
"actions,  prosecution,  matters,  and  things  of  which  such  High  Court  may  have  taken"
"cognizance."
"It is significant to note that no jurisdiction was granted over matters that the District Court"
"has taken cognizance of civil matters. Therefore, it is my considered view that the powers of"
"Revision granted to the Court of Appeal in respect of the matters of which the High Court has"
"taken cognizance does not include judgments and orders from the District Courts for which"
"an appeal lie directly to the Supreme Court."
"Furthermore,  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  the  Provincial  High  Court  exercise  concurrent"
"jurisdiction with regard to matters dealt with by the Provincial High Court exercising civil"
"appellate jurisdiction against the orders and judgments of the District Courts, vide Article"
"138 of the Constitution and Section 5A of the Act No. 19 of 1990 High Court of Provinces"
"(Special  Provinces)  as  amended  by  Act  No.  54  of  2006  read  with  Article  154P  of  the"
"Constitution."
"The relevant Constitutional provisions and statutory provisions set out in Act No. 09 of 1990"

"The Article 138 of the Constitution sets out the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, including"
"the revisionary jurisdiction, Article 138 has been reproduced below,"
"Article 138. (1) ‘The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the"
"Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or"
"in law which shall be [committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original"
"jurisdiction  or  by  any  Court  of  First  Instance],  tribunal  or  other  institution  and  sole  and"
"exclusive  cognizance, by  way  of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes,"
"suits,  actions,  prosecutions,  matters  and  things  [of  which  such  High  Court,  Court  of  First"
"Instance], tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance.’"
"Provided  that  no  judgment,  decree,  or  order  of  any  court  shall  be  reversed  or  varied  on"
"account of any error, defect, or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights"
"of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice."
