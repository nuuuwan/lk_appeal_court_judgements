"Judgments and Orders of the (Provincial) High Courts. If I may repeat, it says: “The"
"Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the Constitution"
"or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction…."
"Any law” encompasses the laws introduced by Act Nos. 19 of 1990 and 54 of"
"2006.”"

emphasis is mine]"
"S
ince Aluwihare PC. J has not taken into consideration sections 5A, and 5C of the Amending"
"Act No. 54 of 2006 and the purpose of such amendment, the Court of Appeal need not follow"
"the judicial precedence of Wijesiri Gunawardane & Others v. Chradsena Muthukumarana"
"and Others [supra]."
"Moreover, in Ramanathan Chettiar Vs. Wickramarachchi and others, [reported in 1978 -"
"1979 (2) SRI L.R.395, at pages 410 and 411] Soza J with Tambiah J agreeing, sitting in the"
"Court of Appeal observed thus:"
"‘The doctrine of stare decisis is no doubt an indispensable foundation upon which to"
"decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It provides at least some"
"degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in the conduct of their affairs as"
"well as a basis for orderly development of legal rules. Certainty in the law is no doubt"
"very  desirable  because  there  is  always  the  danger  of  disturbing  retrospectively  the"
"basis on which contracts, settlements of property, and fiscal arrangements have been"
"entered  into.  While  the  greatest  weight  must  be  given  to  these  considerations,"
"certainty must not be achieved by perpetuating error or by insulating the law against"
"the currents of social change. . ........................  However, ........, a decision given per"
"incuriam by the former Supreme Court is, if I may say so respectfully, not absolutely"
"binding on the present Court of Appeal.’"
"Therefore,  in  the  event  a  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  has  not  considered  the  relevant"
"provisions of a particular statute or has not responded to previous case law applicable to such"
"matter,  then  this  court  is  allowed  to  distinguish  such  judgments  and  follow  the  statutory"
"provisions as held by Chitrasiri J., in the case of W. Jane Nona Kumbuuka & Others v H. D."
"Chalo Singho  [CA No. 499/98 (F) & A 499/98 (F), CAM 25.07.2013]."
"In view of the aforesaid analysis of the relevant statutory provisions, it clearly manifests that"
"it would be a paradox to permit Court of Appeal to exercise revisionary jurisdiction against"
"the same jurisdiction that Court of Appeal has been entrusted, as the Provincial High Court"
"exercises  the  same  jurisdiction  as  the  Court  of  Appeal.  As  Court  of  Appeal  cannot  lie  in"
