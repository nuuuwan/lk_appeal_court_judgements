"In  the  case G.K.D. Stephan Gunaratne v Maddumage Thushara Indika Sampath [supra],"
"Justice Salam stated that,"
"It is well settled law that a thing which cannot be done directly, cannot be allowed to"
"be done indirectly. The petitioner to the present application in my opinion is seeking"
"to impugn the judgment delivered by the  learned High Court Judge in  an indirect"
"manner than provided for in the law, which he cannot achieve directly by reason of"
"his right to challenge the propriety of the said judgment in the Supreme Court by way"
"of a direct appeal. Further, if the petitioner is held to enjoy such a right, a judgment"
"pronounced on the revision application would be appealable to the Supreme Court in"
"terms of article 127 of the Constitution. This would undoubtedly lead to absurdity"
"and  above  all,  the  petitioner  will  have  a  second  bite  at  the  cherry,  which  is  not"
"available to a person who has already exercised the right of appeal to the Supreme"
"Court."
