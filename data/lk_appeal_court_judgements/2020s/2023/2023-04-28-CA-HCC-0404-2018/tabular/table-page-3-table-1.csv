"In  his  judgement,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  found  that  there  was  no"
"evidence to suggest that the appellant engaged the minor in his garage with the"
"intention  of  subjecting  him  to  cruelty,  burned  him  with  iron  rods  or  deprived"
"him of food as mentioned in the charge preferred."
"However, it was determined that the child has suffered an eye injury as a result"
"of him being near a grinder operated by the appellant, where some object which"
"escaped from it hit the eye of the minor. It had been determined that this was a"
"result of failing to provide due protection for him, which amounts to negligence."
"It  has  also  been  determined  that  the  appellant  has  assaulted  the  minor  with"
"the  tools  used  in  the  garage  and  thereby  willfully  harassed  or  assaulted  him."
"Although  it  was  found  that  there  was  no  evidence  as  to  the  alleged  acts  of"
"cruelty  mentioned  in  the  charge,  the  appellant  was  found  guilty  in  terms  of"
"section 308A (2) on the basis of his negligence as stated above."
"Accordingly, the appellant was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment,"
"which  was  the  minimum  mandatory  that  can  be  imposed  in  terms  of  section"
"308A (2) of the Penal Code."
"In  the  sentencing  order,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  being  the  judge  who"
"heard the case in its entirety, has considered that although the appellant was"
"found guilty, the way the appellant and his wife, the 2nd accused indicted, has"
"treated the minor on other occasions as relevant. He has also considered that"
"the  appellant  has  provided  the  minor  with  the  best  available  care  when  he"
"received  the  eye  injury  relevant  as  well,  in  sentencing  the  appellant  for  the"
"minimum mandatory sentence and not ordering any compensation."
