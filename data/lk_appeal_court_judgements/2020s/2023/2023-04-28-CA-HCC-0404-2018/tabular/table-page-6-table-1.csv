"The  offence  of  hurt  as  described  in  section  310  of  the  Penal  Code  reads  as"
"follows;"
"310. Whoever causes bodily pain, disease, or infirmity to any person"
"is said to “cause hurt”."
"The offence of voluntary causing hurt as described in section 312 of the Penal"
"Code reads as follows;"
"312.  Whoever  does  any  act  with  the  intention  of  thereby  causing"
"hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby"
"to cause hurt to any person, and thereby cause hurt to any person is"
"said to “voluntary to cause hurt”."
"The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  having  agreed  to  consider  the"
"arguments of the learned Counsel for the appellant, and after considering the"
"facts  and  the  circumstances  of  this  matter  in  its  totality,  agreed  that  the"
"evidence  falls  short  of  proving  beyond  reasonable  doubt  the  offence  of  cruelty"
"as described in section 308A (1) of the Penal Code."
"It was her contention that the evidence establishes that the minor has suffered"
"a  permanent  injury  to  his  eye  and  therefore,  it  should  attract  a  conviction  of"
"the  appellant  in  terms  of  section  316  of  the  Penal  code  for  causing  grievous"
"hurt to the minor."
"This  argument  was  formulated  on  the  basis  that  the  minor  has  suffered  an"
"impairment  of  the  eye  and  it  falls  within  the  meaning  of  section  311(b)  of  the"
"Penal Code, which is permanent privation or impairment of the sight of either"
"eye."
