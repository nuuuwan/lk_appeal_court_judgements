"CA PHC 31/2018"
"monetary  or  personal  benefit 
from  the  crime  committed  cannot  be"
"deemed as the person behind the illegal operation."
"Hence, the Learned Magistrate simply dismissing the application on the"
"basis that the Claimant had failed to show that  she took all necessary"
"precautions  to  prevent  a  crime  being  committed  is  not  correct  in  this"
"case."
"Further,  finding  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  that  there  are  no"
"exceptional circumstances to grant relief is also erroneous."
"Hence, 
I  set  aside  the  order  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  of"
"Hambantota  dated  07.03.2018  and  the  order  of  Learned  Magistrate"
"Court of Tissamaharama dated 26.03. 2016."
"Therefore, this appeal is allowed."
"I direct that the vehicle No. SP LE 8799 be released to the Appellant."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this Judgement"
"to 
the  High  Court  of  Hambantota  and 
the  Magistrate  Court  of"
"Tissamaharama."
