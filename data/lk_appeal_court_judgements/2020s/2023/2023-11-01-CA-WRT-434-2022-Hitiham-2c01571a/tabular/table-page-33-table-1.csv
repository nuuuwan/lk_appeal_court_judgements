"","(iii) 
As per the provisions related to the Citizenship Act, No.  18 of 19489, the 1st"
"","Respondent had not taken any steps to renounce the   British Citizenship as her"
"","mother is a descent from Britain. The said provisions are referred to in Section"
"","5(i), Section 8(i), Sections 20(ii), (v) and (vi) of the Citizenship Act."
"37)","The dual citizenship was not obtained by the 1st Respondent as per the statement made"
"","to the Criminal Investigation Bureau on 31st October 2022."
"38)","Although the said position taken by the Petitioner was rejected by the 1st Respondent,"
"","when observing the objections tendered by the 1st Respondent, the 1st Respondent had"
"","not  challenged  the  documents  marked  and  produced  by  the  Petitioner  and  the  4th"
"","Respondent."
"39)","However,  I will deal with  these  facts later.  At the outset, pertinent  to  the aforesaid"
"","issues, as I have not agreed with my brother judge, I have to consider the facts pertinent"
"","to the documents tendered by the Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent and the 4th Respondent"
"","to see whether the 1st Respondent is a citizen of Sri Lanka to proceed with the Writ of"
"","Quo Warranto Application."
"40)","The foremost question that had arisen in this Application is the British Citizenship of"
"","the 1st Respondent.  To support that the Petitioner had submitted P11 document which"
"","is a photocopy of the British Passport of the 1st Respondent."

"","document marked and produced as P11 is a photocopy, therefore, in a Writ Application"
"","that document cannot be accepted."
"42)","The  P11  photocopy  of 
the  passport  refers 
to  Passport  No.521398876. 
  The  3rd"
"","Respondent had submitted R4 document which contains the same passport number and"
"","the same name of the 1st Respondent.  Although the document marked and produced as"
"","P11 is a photocopy, the R4 document which is marked and produced by the Attorney"
"","General reiterates the same facts as related in P11."
"43)","The  Counsel  appearing  for  the  3rd  Respondent  had  contended  that  without  a  proper"
"","investigation at this stage, the 3rd Respondent cannot verify the Diana Gamage referred"
"","to in R4 is the same Diana Gamage referred to as the 1st Respondent."
"44)","At this stage, I am returning to the main question of the Application of the two British"
"","Passports Nos. 094425352 and 521398876 referred to by the Petitioner.  In referring to"
"","the  said  two  British  Passports,  I  draw  my  attention  to  the  document  marked  and"
