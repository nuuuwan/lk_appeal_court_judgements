"in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto against Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe while he held the"
"office of Prime Minister of the Republic of Sri Lanka. Among the Preliminary Objections raised"
"on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents in the instant case, one such Preliminary Objection"
"was that the Petitioner had failed to comply with Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate"
"Procedure) Rules 1990."
"The  Court  of Appeal,  having  considered  the  implications  of  allowing  a  faulty  application,"
"upheld the Preliminary Objection and stated thus;"
"""The  Court  of Appeal  Rules  make  provision,  under  Rule  3(1)(a),  for  a  Petitioner  to"
"tender originals of documents or certified copies thereof in support of the averments"
"contained in an application to exercise powers vested in this Court by Articles 140 and"
"141 of the Constitution. The documents marked P6(a)-(e) and P7 (a)-(e), attached to"
"the affidavit, are not original documents or certified copies of original documents. The"
"failure  to  comply  with  the  said  Rules  remains  unexplained.  The  Rule  relating  to  the"
"discretion of Court in consideration of surrounding circumstances, as noted above, in"
"my view, cannot be outweighed by considerations which disregard the objective of the"
"Rule. I observe that there is a clear and consistent non-compliance of the said Rule in"
"the application submitted to Court. Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the"
"procedure for invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court, the strict compliance of which"
"is imperative."""
"""For  the  reasons  aforementioned,  I  uphold  the  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the"
"Respondents  and  dismiss  the  Petitioner's  Application  for  non-compliance  with  Rule"
"3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules."""
"It is significant to note that the Hon. Judges of the Court of Appeal in the aforesaid judgement"
"considered the submissions on the part of the Petitioner with regard to certain documents that"
"were contended to the electronically accessible public documents which do not require further"
"proof in terms of Section 5(1)(a) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, and"
"held that the Petition of the Petitioner in the aforesaid case was not in compliance with Rule"
