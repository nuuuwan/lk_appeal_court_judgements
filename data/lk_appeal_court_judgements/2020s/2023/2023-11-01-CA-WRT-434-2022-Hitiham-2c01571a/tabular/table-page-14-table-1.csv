"In the said case, the Supreme Court, sitting in appeal from a judgement of the Court of Appeal,"
"was presented with competing versions of the citizenship status of the Appellant Member of"
"Parliament, and, having enquired into the matter and considered the disputed facts, concluded"
"that the Appellant had been a dual citizen at the time of her election as a Member of Parliament,"
"which, being against the prevailing law at the time, meant she was not qualified to be elected"
"as a Member of Parliament and thus not qualified to hold such office; accordingly, the Writ of"
"Quo Warranto issued by the Court of Appeal was upheld by the Supreme Court."
"The Supreme Court also observed in the said case that since the Appellant had admitted that"
"she  was  a  citizen  of  Switzerland  and  was  now  contending  that  she  had  given  up  such"
"citizenship, ""the burden shifts to the 1st Respondent to prove the date on which she gave up"
"citizenship  of  Switzerland"",  going  on  to  cite  sections  101,  103  and  106  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance. The Supreme Court went on to state. The learned Counsel for the Respondent says"
"that the 1st Respondent-Appellant is the best person to speak about the date on which she gave"
"up the citizenship of Switzerland more than anybody. She even in her Statement of Objection"
"and her Affidavit filed in the Court of Appeal, does not state the date on which she gave up the"
"citizenship of Switzerland."
"Hence, the settled position of the law is clearly that in the issuance of a Writ of Quo Warranto"
"where the party against whom it is sought mounts a challenge resulting, naturally, in disputed"
"facts,  the  court  is  obligated  to  enquire  into  the  matter  and  decide  based  on  the  evidence"
"presented by the parties whether or not the Writ lies. Considering the nature and purpose of the"
"Writ, the duty on the Court and on the State in this regard is substantial and cannot be lightly"
"discharged."
"Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent argued that the Petition of the Petitioner has not been"
"filed  in  compliance  with  Rule  3  (1)  (a)  of  the  Supreme  Court  Rules  the  Court  of Appeal"
"(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990."
