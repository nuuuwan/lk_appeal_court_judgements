"The 1st Respondent's preliminary objection is that the facts in respect of the 1st Respondent's"
"citizenship are in dispute and hence this Court cannot exercise Writ jurisdiction."
"In the first place, the Petitioner draws attention to the fact that it is only the 1st Respondent who"
"can conclusively resolve the said purported dispute by tendering to this Court proof of her Sri"
"Lankan citizenship in terms of the Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948 as amended (""Citizenship"
"Act""),  or  proof  of  renunciation  of  her  British  citizenship.  However,  the  1st  Respondent  has"
"submitted no such proof or indeed any supporting documentation to this effect and she has not"
"even expressly averred to this Court that she is a citizen of Sri Lanka or that she has renounced"
"her British citizenship."
"Secondly, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner argues that the 1st Respondent relies on four"
"cases in raising this preliminary objection. However, the Court will observe that in all four of"
"those cases, the reliefs sought are Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus. Even if it is accepted that"
"Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus do not lie when facts are in dispute, the position of the law"
"in  Writs  of  Quo Warranto  is  entirely  different:  the  remedies  are  incomparable  and  the  said"
"principle does not indiscriminately apply. The Writ of Quo Warranto requires the person on"
"whom it is issued to show by what warrant or authority such person holds or exercises public"
"office or franchise."
