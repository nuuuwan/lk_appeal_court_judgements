"yourself down; you have let down those who look to you for inspiration,"
"your party, your profession and Parliament.”"
"“The impact of your conviction has been disastrous for you. You have"
"been expelled from the Labour Party and it seems inevitable that you"
"will be struck off as a solicitor. ... I make plain that I will not treat you"
"more severely because of your position as an MP and former solicitor."
"That said, as Ms Agnew accepted on your behalf, there cannot be one"
"law  for  those  in  positions  of  power,  privilege  and  responsibility  and"
"another for those who are not. ... You had a choice on 2 November 2017"
"whether  to  tell  the  truth  or  to  attempt  to  pervert  the  course  of  public"
"justice. You made the wrong choice, with disastrous consequences.”"
