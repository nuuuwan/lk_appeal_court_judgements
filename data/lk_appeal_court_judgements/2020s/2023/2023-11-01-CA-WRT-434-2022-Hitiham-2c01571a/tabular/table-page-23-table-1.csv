"In any event, the judgement of Justice Marsoof, P.C., President Court of Appeal (as he was"
"then) in Ratnasiri and Others Vs. Ellawala and Other /2004] 2 Sri. LR 180 is of great value"
"to  further  illustrate  the  manner  in  which  the  instant Application  before  this  Court  will  be"
"rendered nugatory  and futile even in the  event  that  this Court is  inclined to  grant the  relief"
"prayed for by the Petitioner."
"In Ratnasiri and Others Vs. Ellawala and Other (supra) their Lordships held thus;"
