"The preliminary objections are as follows;"
"i.   The Petition of the Petitioner has not been filed in compliance with Rule 3 (1) (a) of the"
"Supreme Court Rules and should be dismissed in limine."
"ii.   The facts are in dispute between the parties. That is the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent,"
"and the 3rd Respondent as evident from the pleadings and as such writ will not lie and"
"the Petition of the Petitioner should be dismissed in limine."
"iii.   The relief sought in the Petition of the Petitioner is not conclusive, as such, granting"
"such relief by this Court will be futile. Therefore, the Petition of the Petitioner should"
"be dismissed in limine."
