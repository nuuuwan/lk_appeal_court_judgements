"50)","Beside the said facts, the 1st Respondent had not cited any authority where the said facts"
"","related in the X1 document cannot be considered with the other available documents"
"","and whether the Petitioner had put forward a prima facia case."
"51)","In the said circumstances, I draw my attention to the facts spelt out in the X1 document."
"","In the last page of the X1 document, the 1st Respondent had admitted that she had used"
"","the  British  Passport  Nos.  094425352  and  521398876  to  obtain  visa  to  travel  to  Sri"
"","Lanka."
"52)","When comparing the document marked and produced by the 3rd Respondent as R4, it"
"","contains the same passport numbers referred to by the 1st Respondent in her statement"
"","made to the Criminal Investigation Bureau."
"53)","Therefore, there is prima facia evidence to support the argument raised by the Petitioner"
"","that the 1st Respondent is not a Sri Lankan citizen."
"54)","On perusal of the document R1 marked and produced by the 4th Respondent with his"
"","objections,  is  a  letter  written  by  U.V.  Sarath  Rupasiri  Controller  General  of  the"
"","Department of Immigration and Emigration.  The said objections were filed by the 4th"
"","Respondent on 9th January 2022."
"55)","The  3rd  Respondent  had  filed  his  objection  on  10th  January  2023.    However,  the  3rd"
"","Respondent had failed to produce the said document and had failed to refer to the said"
"","document.  In the said document the Controller General had specifically referred to that"
"","the 1st Respondent requested to obtain a Diplomatic Passport and, in his observation,"
"","he had stated that the 1st Respondent is not entitled to obtain the said Passport as she"
"","has not produced any document renouncing her British Citizenship. The 1st Respondent"
"","had not objected or denied the facts related in R1 document in her objections."
"56)","In considering all these documents, I am of the view, there is prima facia evidence put"
"","forward by the Petitioner, that the 1st Respondent had not obtained dual citizenship or"
"","she had not renounced her British Citizenship."
"57)","I will consider the facts pertinent to the argument raised by the Parties, the Citizenship"
"","Act, and the other documents under the upcoming disputed facts."
