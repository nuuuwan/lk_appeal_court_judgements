"“Courts are reluctant to grant orders in the nature of writs when the matters"
"on which the relief is claimed are in dispute or in other words when the facts"
"are in dispute.”"
"In Dr. Puvanendran and Another Vs. Premasiri and Two Others3 the Supreme Court"
"held that;"
"“The writ of mandamus is principally a discretionary remedy - a legal tool for"
"the dispensation of justice when no other remedy is available. Given the power"
"of such a remedy, the Common Law surrounding this remedy requires multiple"
"conditions that must be met prior to the issuance of a writ by Court. The Court"
"will issue a writ only if (1) the major facts are not in dispute and the legal result"
"of the facts are not subject to controversy and"
"(2) the function that is to be compelled is a public duty with the power to perform"
"such duty.”"
"Citing the above-stated decision, it was held in Wijenayake and others Vs. Minister of"
"Public Administration4 that disputed facts cannot be decided by a writ court."
"In “Administrative Law”, by H. W. R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, (9th edn, at page 260) it"
"has been stated that;"
"3 (2009) 2 SLR 107 at page 112."
"4 (2011) 2 SLR 247."
