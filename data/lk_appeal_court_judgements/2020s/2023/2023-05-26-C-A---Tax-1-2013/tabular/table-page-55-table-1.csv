"","“So, in the case of a loan which has become irrecoverable, the amount of"
"","which is sought to be deducted, important considerations are that it is not"
"","the  ""expenditure""  incurred  in  advancing  the  loan  which  is  sought  to  be"
"","deducted, but the loss of the loan capital by reason of its having become"
"","irrecoverable; and in that regard, for the purposes of applying the section,"
"","it is relevant to observe that were it not for the loss of the loan capital there"
"","would be no question of any deduction and that the real issue in such a"
"","case is the deductibility of the loss (see Stone' s case supra at 593E-F) ."
"","But in my view considerations such as these are confined to the context"
"","of section 11(a); they have no bearing on the application of section 23(g)."
"","Section 11(a) provides positively for what may be deducted, and section"
"","23(g)  negatively  for  what  may  not,  but  there  is  no  direct  correlation"
"","between the one and the other. So, for instance, the question whether"
"","or not expenditure is of a capital nature is vital to the enquiry under"
"","section 11(a), but it plays no role in the application of section 23(g)."
"","The enquiries under the two sections are notionally and logically discrete."
"","That  this  is  so  is  demonstrated  by  the  fact  that  the  Legislature  did  not"
"","transpose the descriptive expression ""expendituré and losses"" from section"
"","11(a) to section 23(g); instead, it used in the latter section the colourless"
"","expression ""any moneys"". Section 11(a) is concerned with the deduction of"
"","""expenditure"" qua expenditure  and  the  deduction  of  ""losses"" qua losses,"
"","while section 23(g) focusses on the deduction of ""moneys"" qua moneys”."
"It was said that section 11(a) is concerned with an expenditure of capital nature,",""
