"","n  Hayley  and  Company  vs.  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax,  1961,"
"His Lordship said at page 175,",""
"","“Section 9 (1) deals with three classes of deductions. One"
"","is “ outgoings ” , the second is “ expenses incurred by the"
"","assessee in the production of the profits or income ” , and"
"","the third is the specific deductions allowed by paragraphs"
"","(a)-(i) thereof. The word “ outgoings ” means what goes out"
"","and is a word of wide import. It is the opposite of the equally"
"","wide expression “ income ” , which means what comes in. In"
"","the  context  the  word  “  expenses  ”  is  limited  by  the"
"words  “incurred  by  such  person","in  the  production"
"","thereof ” while the word “ outgoings ” is not so limited."
"The 
two  words  are  designed","to  express 
two  different"
"","concepts one of wider import than the other. All outgoings"
"","are not expenses incurred in the production of the profits or"
"","income; but all expenses incurred in the production of the"
"profits or income are outgoings”.",""
