"Goldswain and Swart says about Joffe, as follows,"
"“He presided in the Joffe case where the taxpayer carried on business as"
"engineers in reinforced concrete. A concrete cantilever hood for a power"
"station  in  Durban,  the  building  of  which  the  taxpayer  was  supervising,"
"collapsed and a plumber employed by another contractor was killed by the"
"falling material. It was later established that the reinforcing steel rods had"
"become displaced from their proper position while the concrete was being"
"poured. This displacement had weakened the structure and caused it to"
"collapse. In a delictual court action brought against the taxpayer, it was"
"established  that  the  taxpayer  had  been  negligent 
in  supervising  the"
"construction work and, accordingly, it was required to pay compensation"
"to  the  relatives  of  the  deceased  workman.  The  compensation  and  legal"
"expenses  directly  related 
to  resisting 
the  compensation  action  were"
"claimed  as  a  deduction  incurred  “in  the production  of  the  income”.  The"
"Commissioner  disallowed  both 
the  compensation  awarded  and 
the"
"attendant legal expenses incurred in resisting and defending the claim as"
"a deduction."
"The facts in the Joffe case, prima facie, appear to be very similar to the"
"facts 
in 
the 
Port 
Elizabeth 
Electric 
Tramway 
case, 
negligence"
"notwithstanding.  The  economic  consequences  to  the  taxpayer  were  the"
"same as for the taxpayer in the Port Elizabeth Tramway case. In both cases"
"compensation  had  to  be  paid  as  a  result  of  an  accident  occurring  while"
"carrying on a business. So a similar result could have been expected. But"
"that was not to be. Watermeyer CJ not only disallowed the legal expenses"
"claimed – to be expected since he had made the same decision on this very"
"point 
in  the  Port  Elizabeth  Electric  Tramway’s  case  –  but  also  the"
"compensation  paid.  He  held  that  the  taxpayer  failed  to  prove  that  the"
