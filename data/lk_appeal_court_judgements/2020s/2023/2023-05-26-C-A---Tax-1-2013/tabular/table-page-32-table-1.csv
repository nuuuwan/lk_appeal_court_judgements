"","expenditure  attendant  on  it  is  deductible.  It  seems,  however,  that  this"

"There  are  two  English  cases  which  point  that  way.","In  the  case  of"
"","Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Van Glehn and Co. Ltd. (1920, 2 K.B."
"","553)  a  trader  in  the  course  of  his  business  traded  with  the  enemy  and"
"","became liable to a fine, it was held that he could not deduct such fine. In"
"","the  case  of  Strong  and  Co.  of  Romsey  v.  Woodifield  (1906,  A.C.  448)  an"
"","innkeeper incurred liability towards a guest in his inn owing to the collapse"
"","of a chimney and it was held that this expense could not be deducted. In"
"","this case the Judges differed in their reasons and the judgments are not"
"","very  helpful,  but  the  LORD  CHANCELLOR  suggested  that  possibly  a"
"","railway  company  which  had  to  compensate  injured  passengers  could"
"","deduct such compensation – presumably on the ground that payment of"
"compensation","in  such  cases  was  an  expense  attendant  upon 
the"
"","operations  of  railway  transport,  and  because  no  amount  of  care  could"
"","prevent it arising from time to time, it was so closely connected with such"
"","operations as to form part of the cost of preforming them. There is in fact"
"","a  decision  of  the  Special  Court  to  that  effect  in  the  case  of  a  tramway"
"","company reported at (1 S.A.T.C. 57). I shall not, however, deal further with"
"","the  question  of  unlawfulness  of  a  business  operation  or  negligence  in"
"carrying it out because   they do not arise in this case. (page 246)",""
"","The  other  question  is  what  attendant  expenses  can  be  deducted?  How"
"","closely  must  they  be  linked  to  the  business  operation?  Here,  in  my"
"","opinion,  all  expense  attached  to  the  performance  of  a  business"
