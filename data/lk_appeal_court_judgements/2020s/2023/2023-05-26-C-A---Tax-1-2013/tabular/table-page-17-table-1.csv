"of  certain  expenses,  which  if  not  so  prohibited,  would  be"
"allowable  deductions.  The  combined  effect  of  sections  23"
"and 24 therefore is to divide all outgoings and expenses into"
"two categories; outgoing expenses which are deductible and"
"not deductible”. (page 391)"
"“In considering the applicability of sections 23 and 24, the"
"respondent took up the position that section 24 (1) (g) could"
"be applied to disallow amounts expended for the purpose of"
"producing profits and income from the exempt receipts of a"
"source. Section 24 (1) (g) is in the following terms:"
"“For the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any"
"person  from  any  source  no  deduction  shall  be  allowed  in"
"respect  of  any  disbursements  or  expenses  of  such  person"
"not  being  money  expended  for  the  purpose  of  producing"
"such profits and income.”"
