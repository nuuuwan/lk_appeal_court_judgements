"‘mechanical and contrived” is supported and cites the case of ITC 1058 (1963) 26"
"S.A.T.C. 305, as an example. It is as follows,"
"“…the judge in ITC 1058, it is submitted, took a backward step and erred"
"when  holding  that  the  compensation  paid  as  a  result  of  a  negligent  or"
"perhaps only a stupid act on the part of the taxpayer, was not deductible."
"The South African Railways had parked a trailer in front of the entrance"
"to the taxpayer’s factory. The employees of the taxpayer, unfortunately for"
"some reason not mentioned in the case, partially moved the trailer onto a"
"tarred portion of the road. During the night, a motorist crashed into the"
"trailer and both the taxpayer and the Railways had to pay damages to the"
"motorist  as  a  result  of  the  accident.  The  court  reasoned,  somewhat"
"absurdly it is submitted, that a third party who happens to drive past the"
"factory  at  night  is  not  essential  to  the  taxpayer’s  trade  and  did  not,"
"therefore, produce income”."
