"years after Port Elizabeth Electric Tramways case, saying that Watermeyer,"
"now the Chief Justice of South Africa was in an unenviable position."
"Watermeyer  C.  J.,  said,  ““Mr.  Rosenberg  [N.  E.  Rosenberg  K.  C.,  who"
"appeared for the appellant] further contended that, even if the expenditure"
"in  question  was  not  the  necessary  concomitant  of  the  business  of  a"
"reinforced  concreate  engineer,  it  was  an  expenditure  necessarily  arising"
"out of the business methods employed by the appellant and, consequently,"
"was  a  deductible  expenditure.  This  argument  can  be  put  in  a  slightly"
"different form as follows: Appellant has chosen to conduct his business in"
"a manner which necessarily leads to accidents in which third parties are"
"injured  and 
in 
respect  of  which  appellant  has 
to  pay  damages,"
"consequently  such  damages  are  a  deductible  expenditure.  It  is  possible"
"that this argument can be refuted upon more grounds than one, but I shall"
"only mention the following one: there is nothing in the stated case to show"
"that the appellant’s method of conducting his business necessarily leads"
"to  accidents  and 
it  would  be  somewhat  surprising 
if 
there  were."
"Consequently,  the  basis  of  Mr.  Rosenberg’s  argument  disappears  and  it"
"cannot be supported”."
