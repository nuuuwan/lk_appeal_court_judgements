"“if the decision is bias.”"
"Article  140 of  the  Constitution prescribes  the  Law  under  which  this  Court  can  issue  Writs  in  the"
"nature of Certiorari and Prohibition."
"The Respondents argued that the contention of the Petitioners that Nurses are a special class of"
"people  in  view  of  the  compulsory  age  of  retirement  being  placed  at  63  years  is  erroneous  and"
"misplaced. The decision to retire Nurses at 63 years was a policy decision taken by the Cabinet of"
