"sound  argument  of the  learned  President’s Counsel  for  the  respondent,  where  the"
"learned President’s Counsel correctly stated that the petitioner could have filed the"
"purge  default  application 
to 
the  District  Court  by  relying  on 
the  special  act"
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 17 of 2021"
"which was in operation at the time of the matter, rather than moving to this Court"
"stating that the delay was due to the continuous power cuts prevailed in the country."
"Thus, the learned President’s Counsel    claims that the petitioner has not exercised"
"the  alternative  statutory  remedies  available 
for  the  petitioner  and  thereby  the"
"petitioner is not entitled to any relief in the nature of an application for restitutio in"
"integrum."
"Apart from the argument that summons had not been served on the petitioner, the"
"petitioner challenged the learned District Judge’s order on the ground that the order"
"had been delivered based on two contradicting documents marked P9 and P10."
"It was stated and admitted by the petitioner that there was a transaction between"
"the  plaintiff-respondent; 
the  Bank  and 
the  1st  defendant-respondent  and 
the"
"petitioner was the guarantor for the transaction (Document marked P8). Nevertheless,"
"the petitioner argued that there is a contradiction between P9 and P10 and thereby"
"stated  that  the  fact  the  order  of  the  learned  District  Judge  relying  on  contrary"
"documents caused substantial miscarriage of justice to the petitioner. Yet the learned"
"President’s Counsel during his argument stated that they deny the averment of the"
"petitioner and states that there is no discrepancy between the documents."
"In accordance with ordinary business practices, the respondent Banker maintains"
"the  account  ledgers  for  P9  and  P10  documents.  The  learned  District  Judge  has"
"acknowledged  and  accepted  these  uncontested  documents  and  thus  there  is  no"
"sufficient justification for the argument of the petitioner to satisfy to courts that the"
"documents are contrary to each other. Apparently, the P9 and P 10 are based on the"
"entries of the respondent plaintiff’s (Banker’s) books. Thus, the Section 90C of the"
"Evidence Ordinance subject to the provisions in Chapter VI of the Ordinance, enables"
"that   a certified copy of any entry in a banker's book shall in all legal proceedings be"
"received as prima facie evidence of the existence of such entry, and shall be admitted"
"as evidence of the matters, transactions, and accounts therein recorded in every case"
