"Provisions) Act No. 17 of 2021 was in operation for two years commencing from the"
"1st of March 2020. Thereby the learned President’s Counsel points out to state that"
"the petitioners could have used this to validate their argument with regards to the"
"delay in filing purge default papers to the District Court which is a more binding and"
"suitable argument."
"The learned President’s Counsel further stated that the most appropriate procedure"
"for relief would have been to follow the procedure stated in Section 86(2) of the CPC."
"The way in which the applications are to be presented to purge the default and the"
"manner, such an application should be considered is stipulated in Section 86(2) of"
"CPC."
"The  said  section  reads:  “Where,  within  fourteen  days  of  the  service  of  the  decree"
"entered  against  him  for  default,  the  defendant  with  notice  to  the  plaintiff  makes"
"application to and thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable grounds for such"
"default, the court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant to"
"proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as to costs or"
"otherwise as to the court shall appear proper."""

"Selenduhamy  48  N.L.R.  353  held  where  an  order  is  made  ex-parte  the  proper"
"procedure to be adopted by the person against whom that order has been made is,"
"in the first instance, to move the court which made the order to set it aside. In the"
"case  of  Dingihamy  V  Don  Bastian  65  N.L.R.  549  it  further  states  that  a  party"
"affected  by  an  ex-parte  order  of  which  he  had  no  notice  must  apply  in  the  first"
"instance to the court, which made the order to rescind the order."
"If the petitioner claims that he has not been served with summons he is responsible"
"for proving his case to satisfy the courts. The petitioner repeatedly argued about the"
"fact that in the caption of the plaint to the District Court he had been named as the"
"3rd  defendant  and  his  address  had  been  mentioned  as  No.  105/E,  Ehelape  Road,"
