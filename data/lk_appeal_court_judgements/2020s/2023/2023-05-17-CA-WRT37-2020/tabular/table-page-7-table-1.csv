"De Smith’s ‘Judicial Review’ 8th edition notes:"
"“Where an applicant seeks to impugn a decision of an administrative authority other than"
"by claiming non-compliance with a duty to give reasons- for example by challenging the legality or"
"rationality of decisions- a failure by that authority to offer any answer to the allegations may justify"
"an inference that its reasons were bad in law or that it had exercised its powers unlawfully."
"‘
Absurd’ or ‘perverse’ decisions may be presumed to have been decided in that fashion” [emphasis"

"substantiating  our  observation  that  the  decision  is  arbitrary.  An  arbitrary  exercise  of"
"power is the antithesis of the rule of law."
"Notwithstanding the aforesaid discussion, what is appalling to this Court is the"

"resolution to prevent the transportation of extracted groundwater, which has been duly"
"approved  by  the  relevant  authority  in  law  tasked  with  the  same.  It  is  trite  that  the"
