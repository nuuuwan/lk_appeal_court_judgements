"T
hey  searched  the  house  but  did  not  find  any  illegal  substances  there.  Then"
"they  came  to  the  police  station  at  Hikkaduwa,  where  they  properly  sealed  the"
"heroin  and  kept 
it 
in  a 
locker  allocated 
to  PW1.  The 
following  day 
the"
"productions were handed over to PW8 Inspector of Police, Rajakaruna and PW8"
"then handed over the productions to the Government Analyst."
"The first ground of appeal is that the chain of custody has not been proved by"
"the  prosecution. 
  It 
involves  only  PW1  and  PW8. 
  PW1  handed  over  the"
"productions  on  the  following  day  to  PW8.    PW8  handed  over  the  same  to  the"
"Government  Analyst.    There  was  no  break  in  the  chain  of  custody  of  the"
"productions. Therefore, the first ground of appeal has no merit."
"The  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that  there  is  a  difference  in  the  weight  of  the"
"heroin.    As  per  the  police,  the  weight  of  the  heroin  is  13  grams  and  200"
"milligrams.  When  it  was  weighed  by  the  Government  Analyst  department,  the"
"weight  was  13  grams  and  730  milligrams.    The  witness  from  the  Government"
"Analyst  department  had  explained  that  the  weighing  scale  at  the  Government"
"Analyst  department  is  accurate.    She  further  said  that  most  of  the  time  the"
"weight given by the police would slightly differ. This slight difference in weight"
"does  not  create  a  reasonable  doubt.    The  Trial  Judge  had  considered  it  and"
"come to the conclusion that it had no significance."
"The  next  argument  is  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  drug  trafficking.  The"
"prosecution  had  not 
given 
additional 
evidence 
that 
the 
appellant  was"
"trafficking  heroin.    There  should  be  some  additional  evidence  to  prove  the"
"trafficking;  if  not,  the  quantity  of  heroin  itself  is  a  large  quantity  to  presume"
"that  he  was  trafficking  heroin.  Therefore,  I  set  aside  the  conviction  of  the"
"accused for the first count."
"The  next  ground  of  appeal 
is  that  the  version  of  the  prosecution 
is  not"
"probable. 
  Counsel 
for  the  appellant  argued  that  as  there  were  no  other"
