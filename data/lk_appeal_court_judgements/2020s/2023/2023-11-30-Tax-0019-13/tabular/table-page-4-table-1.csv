"Question No. 01: Whether reasons communicated under section 7(3) of Tax"
"Appeal Commission Act after the time period are valid?"
"In  respect  of  this  Question  the  response  of  the  respondent  contained  at  its"
"written submissions dated 08th June 2018 at page 03 is that as the appellant"
"intimated its intention to appeal by a letter dated 06.10.2011 which was referred"
"to the respondent by a letter dated 14.10.2011 and received thereafter; and the"
"respondent  transmitted  his  reasons  for  the  determination  on  16.11.2011,  the"
"communication is within the stipulated time."
"If  the  Tax  Appeal  Commission’s  letter  dated  14.10.2011  was  received  by  the"
"respondent on 15.10.2011, the determination is one day out of time."
"Section  7(3)  says,  “within 
thirty  days  of  receipt  of 
the  notification”.  The"
"Commission’s  letter,  as  the  respondent  says,  being  dated  14.10.2011  and  the"
"reasons being on 16.11.2011, had the letter dated 14.10.2011 received by the"
"respondent on 17.10.2011, the reasons are still within time."
"There appears to be no admission between parties as to when the letter dated"
"14.10.2011  was  received  by  the  respondent,  which  the  respondent  does  not"
"disclose.  Therefore  it  appears  to  this  Court  that  answering  that  question  is"
"superfluous."
"Question  Nos.  02,  03  and  04:  Whether  the  notice  of  assessment  is  made"
"within the time provided under section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act"
"No. 10 of 2006?"
"Whether the amendment made to section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act"
"No. 10 of 2006 by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009 is"
"applicable to the year of assessment 2007/2008?"
"Whether the Assessor communicated the reasons in rejecting the return of"
"income as required by section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of"
"2006?"
"Section 163 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 is as reproduced below."
