"Purportedly  following  the  Supreme  Court  case  of  D.M.S.  Fernando  vs.  Ismail"
"1982 (1) SLR 272, W.N.D. Perera J., said,"
"“Communication  of  reasons  for  rejecting  a  return  is  mandatory  and  has  to  be"
"done “at or about the time”, an assessment is made on an estimated income. In"
"the instant case the assessments have been sent to the assessee “at or about the"
"time,” the assessments were made. There is therefore substantial compliance with"
"the requirement of the law.”"
"The said judgment cannot be accepted for two reasons, one is intrinsic whereas"
"the other is extrinsic. D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982 and the Court"
"of  Appeal  decision  on  which  it  was  based,  Ismail  vs.  Commissioner  of  Income"
"Tax  1981,  dealt  with  the  question  whether  giving  reasons  for  not  accepting  a"
"return is mandatory. Both courts decided that it was mandatory. The Court of"
"Appeal  decided 
that  reasons  must  be  given  before  sending 
the  notice  of"
"assessment.  The  Supreme  Court  decided  that  the  reasons  can  be  given  “at  or"
"about the time” when the notice of assessment is sent. It is from that decision"
"the  court  in  Philp  Upali  Wijewardene  (appellant)  vs.  C.  Kathiragamer  and"
"another  in  1992  has  taken  the  phrase  “at  or  about  the  time”.  The  Supreme"
"Court in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982 did not say that “notice”"
"or the “assessment” can be sent “at or about the time”. This intrinsic defect is"
"even seen in the last quoted passage from Justice W.N.D. Perera’s judgment. In"
"the aforequoted passage the first sentence refers to “reasons” while the second"
"sentence refers to the “assessment.” Please see the highlighting of the second"
"quotation from the judgment. This is, with respect, the inherent defect in that"
"decision. The extrinsic reason for the inability of this court to apply that decision"
"lies  in  the  difference  between  the  relevant  revenue  legislations  then  and  now."
"The  case  of  Philp  Upali  Wijewardene  (appellant)  vs.  C.  Kathiragamer  and"
"another (respondent) 1992 was decided on Inland Revenue Act No. 04 of 1963"
"as  amended  by  Inland  Revenue  (amendment)  Law  No.  30  of  1978.  The  said"
"amendment  dealt  with  the  duty  to  give  reasons  for  not  accepting  the  return"
