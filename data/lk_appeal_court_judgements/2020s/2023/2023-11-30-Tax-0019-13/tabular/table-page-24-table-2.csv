"Justice Victor Perera, that giving reasons must be prior to the sending of notice"
"of assessment, both justices agreed on several salient points, such as,"
"(a) An assessor could arrive at an arbitrary decision since he was not bound"
"to disclose any reasons,"
"(b) The  assessee  was  kept 
in  the  dark  and  hence  was 
in  a  position  of"
"disadvantage when he has to appeal against a notice of assessment,"
"(c)  Once  the  assessor 
forms  his 
judgment,  the  burden  shifts  on  to  the"
"assessee,"
"(d) The  purpose  of  the  amendment  brought  by  law  No.  30  of  1978  was  to"
"remedy the aforesaid position,"
"(e)  Both 
Judges 
considered 
that 
the 
“making 
of 
an 
assessment” 
is"
"synonymous  with  “the  giving  of  statutory  notice  (not  the  reasons)  of"
"assessment.” [Eg. the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is"
"made for the purpose of sending the statutory notice of assessment"
"referred to in section 95]"
