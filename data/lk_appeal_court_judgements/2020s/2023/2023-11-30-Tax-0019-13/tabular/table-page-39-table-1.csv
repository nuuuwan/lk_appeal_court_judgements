"""In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is already said. There"
"is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There"
"is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is"
"to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used""."
"The above passage from the judgement of Rowlett. J. has been"
"quoted  times  out  of  number  and  approved  by  the  House  of"
"Lords, Privy Council and Supreme Court in a number of cases‚Äù."
