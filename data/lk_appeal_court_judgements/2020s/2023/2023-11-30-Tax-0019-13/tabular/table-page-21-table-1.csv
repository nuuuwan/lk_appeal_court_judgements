"his judgment, the burden shifted on the assessee."
"The learned Chief Justice also said,"
"“Furthermore one has to consider this amendment in the light of the law"
"as  it  then  existed.  The  Assessor  was  then  not  bound  to  disclose  any"
"reasons either on the file or by communication to the Assessee. All was left"
"to the good sense of the Assessor and his sense of justice and fairness. The"
"Assessee could only appeal against the quantum of assessment and the"
"onus  of  proof  lay  on  the  Assessee.  He  could  only  speculate  on  the"
"reasons for such assessment for the purposes of his appeal. The picture is"
"now  different.  A  duty  is  now  imposed  on  the  Assessor  not  only  to  give"
"reasons for non-acceptance of a return but also to communicate them to"
"the Assessee”."
