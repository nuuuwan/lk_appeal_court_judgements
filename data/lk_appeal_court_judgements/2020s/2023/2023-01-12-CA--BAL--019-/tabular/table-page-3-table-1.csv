"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely"
"Panambarage  Shamith 
Jehan  Fernando  under 
the  provisions  of 
the"
"Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses act."
"A complaint had been lodged against the suspect on 1st March 2021 under"
"section 314,316 and 380 of the Penal Code."
"Subsequently  another  complaint  had  been  filed  on  15th  March  2021  for"
"threatening  the  husband  of  the  victim 
in  the  above-mentioned  matter."
"Thereafter the police had filed a B report under the instant act as a result of"
"which the suspect had been remanded and has been in remand ever since."
"The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that the suspect and"
"the  victim 
in  the  substantive  matter  had  been  having  an  extra  marital"
"relationship  and  that  it  is  a  series  of  events  based  on  the  three  people"
"involved in a triangle of a personal relationship and nothing also."
"The State Counsel appearing for the respondents objected to the application."
"In considering the law pertaining to the instant matter bail can be considered"
"under the instant act only upon exceptional circumstances by the Court of"
"Appeal and the act has not defined the term exceptional. But in many of our"
"decided cases it has been held that the exceptionality depends on the facts"
"and circumstances of each case."
"Anyhow  it  has  been  urged  on  behalf  of  the  suspect  that  he  has  been  in"
"remand  for  the  instant  matter  for  more  than  a  year  without  proper  legal"
"action being taken against him."
