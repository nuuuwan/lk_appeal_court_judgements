"After  considering  the  application,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Kalmunai,"
"pronouncing his order dated 09-02-2022, has decided that there was no material"
"for the Provincial High Court to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate"
"and had affirmed the order and dismissed the application made in revision by"
"the petitioner."
"It is against the above-mentioned two orders; the petitioner has now come before"
"this Court seeing to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction conferred to this Court in"
"terms of Article 138 of the Constitution."
"At the hearing of this application, it was the contention of the learned Counsel"
"for the petitioner that the main reason for the rejection of the claim by the owner"
"of the animals by the learned Magistrate had been that the age of the animals"
"given in the cattle vouchers and the corresponding cattle receipts do not match,"
"and the claim of the owner that he was not privy to the actions of the accused"
"cannot be accepted."
"It was his position that there was no dispute as to the ownership of the cattle"
"and although the accused were charged for having transported the cattle, in fact,"
"they were only herding the cattle when they were arrested. It was his position"
"that herding of cattle by foot would not amount to transporting of the cattle as"
"envisaged in the provisions of the Animals Act. It was also his position that if the"
"learned Magistrate was not certain about the ages of the animals claimed by the"
"owner, the learned Magistrate should have given effect to his order made in the"
"journal  entry  dated  02-07-2020  of  the  Magistrate  Court  case  record,  before"
"pronouncing his order five days thereafter, on 07-07-2020."
"It  appears  from  the  journal  entry  dated  02-07-2020  of  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court"
"case record, that it was the date fixed by the learned Magistrate for his order in"
"relation to the inquiry. However, on that day, the learned Magistrate, instead of"
"pronouncing his order, has made the following Directive which reads thus;"
