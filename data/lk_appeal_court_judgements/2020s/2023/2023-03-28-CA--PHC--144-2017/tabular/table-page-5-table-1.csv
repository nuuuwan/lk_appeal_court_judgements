"contention  whether  the  learned  Magistrate  has  correctly  applied  the"
"relevant  legal  provisions  and  evaluated  the  evidence  presented  before"
"the court, in arriving at the final determination that the appellant has"
"failed to dispense the said burden."
"While  making  submissions  by  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  relied  on"
"two grounds, namely, appellant has taken all precautions to prevent the"
"use of her vehicle for the commission of such offence to the satisfaction"
"of  the  court  and  there  exists  a  fatal  defect  in  the  charge  sheet  where"
"accused pleaded guilty."
"The  learned  Magistrate  in  delivering  the  order  has  examined  whether"
"the  appellant  has  sufficiently  established  ownership  to  the  vehicle,"
"which  was  followed  by  an  evaluation  of  the  evidence  given  by  the"
"appellant in relation to the precautionary steps taken by her."
"Through  an  examination  on  the  evidence  given  by  the  appellant  it  is"
"stated that the  vehicle was used  for transporting firewood  as per the"
"request  of  companies  such  as  Damro,  Lalan,  Hirdaramani  &  Prime"
"Polymers and stated that the lorry was also given for hiring purposes."
"However, during the cross examination the appellant had admitted  to"
"the fact she was not aware about the whereabouts of the transportation"
"of wood on the day of the incident. This indeed raised the concern over"
"why the appellant did not keep close monitoring on activities the lorry"
"was  engaged  in,  on  a  daily  basis.  Thereby  this  can  be  considered"
"contrary  to  her  claim  of  having  taken  all  precautionary  measures  to"
"avoid the act of crime."
"Furthermore, the appellant had also stated that the accused generally"
"comes  to  the  appellantâ€™s  house  each  morning  and  takes  the  lorry  for"
"hiring or work purposes and returns the vehicle back each evening after"
"the designated work. Nevertheless, there is no evidence brought forward"
