"after 15 years and she too had misplaced her personal notes and thereby she had given"
"evidence by memory. Hence the Counsel for the appellants raised the position that she"
"had no note to refresh her memory and that she had conducted about 40 parades and that"
"she had been unable to remember details of the said parades but remembers the details"
"pertaining to the instant parade which is very unusual."
"Hence this Court observes that the prosecution had failed to provide before Court as to"
"how the parade had been held, the number of objections that may have been taken on"
"behalf of the appellants , the formations of the parade and how the witnesses and the"
"appellants were brought in to the parade."
"At this juncture this Court draws its attention to the case of Attorney General Vs Joseph"
"Alloysius  and  other1992  2  SriLR  264  where  S.N.  Silva  J  had  stated  with  regard  to"
"identification parade notes that"
"“In the case of Perera V. The State (supra) as noted above, the questions had references"
"to the appearance and physical characteristics of the suspects. Therefore, we are of the"
"view that the observation of walgampaya, J. as to the “Proper Procedure” to be adopted"
"at an identification parade should be understood only in the context of the objectionable"
"features as noted in that case. Indeed, the procedure as stated by walgampiaya J. that a"
"witness should only be asked to identify any suspect if he is in the parade, is with due"
"respect, one that may lead to practical difficulties in many cases. Where several persons"
"are alleged to have committed an offence, if a witness is merely asked “to identify any"
"suspect” he would be confused and would not know what he is expected to do at the"
"parade. His  attention must  necessarily  be  drown to  the  acts  done  by  the  different"
"participants, in  the  course  of  committing  the  offence,  so  as  to  facilitate  a  proper"
"identification. However, at all times caution should be taken to ensure that the question"
"do not contain any indication of the appearance or physical characteristics of a particular"
"participant so as to facilitate an identification."
