"on information collected from the area because it had been a well-known incident in the"
"area. As such this Court is of the view that it is unsafe to accept her evidence with regard"
"to the identification parade."
"The police officer who assisted in producing the suspects at the parade had given evidence"
"but he is not in a position to speak with regard to the details as to the acceptability of the"
"parade."
"If the identification parade notes are done away with the identification of the appellants"
"are solely based on the dock identification of the appellants by the witnesses."
"At this point we draw our attention to the judgment of his Lordship the Chief Justice"
",Jayasuriya J where it has been held in the case of SC (spl)Appeal 7/2018 dated 4.10.2019"
"that “to establish the identity of an accused it is not mandatory that the witnesses should"
"have known him by his name or otherwise, prior to the incident, even in a situation where"
"a  witness had seen a  person at an incident for the first time , his  eviden ce in  Court"
"identifying the accused in  the  dock for the first  time  should not be  rejected merely"
"because the witness had neither seen him before nor had known him by the name…..A"
"dock identification is a valid form of identification. However, time and again Courts have"
"considered the dangers in dock identification”."
"The judgment had referred the E.R.S.R.Coomarswamy in Law of evidence where it has"
"discussed that dock identification is “undesirable and unsafe and should be avoided if"
"possible”."
"The above quoted judgement had further held to say that what really matters is the quality"
"of the evidence and the visual identification of the accused by the witnesses becomes a"
"relevant fact under section 9 of the Evidence Ordinance."
