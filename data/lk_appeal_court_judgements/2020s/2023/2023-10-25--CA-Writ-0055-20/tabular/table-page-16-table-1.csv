"In  the  case  of  Mohamed  Ismail  Wahabdeen  Vs.  His  Lordship  Jayantha  Jayasuriya,"
"Chairman, Judicial Service Commission5, Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J. held as follows;"
"""On a careful perusal of the provisions of the said Article 61A, it is apparent"
"that a wider spectrum of indemnity has been conferred to the PSC precluding"
"even the issuance of prerogative writs against the PSC by the Court of Appeal"
"in  as  much  as  the  said  Article  specifically  spell  out  the  words  ""no  court  or"
"tribunal"". Therefore, it appears that the legislature has made a clear distinction"
"between Article 111K and 61A. However, in terms of the said Article 61A, the"
"jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 126 (along with the jurisdiction"
"of AAT) has not been precluded."""
