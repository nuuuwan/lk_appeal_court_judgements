"the  Petitioner  obtained  her  postgraduate  degree  on  26th  August  2014."
"Consequently,  as  of  the  effective  date  of  notice  ‘P  3’,  23rd  June  2017,  the"
"Petitioner  did  not  have 
the  required 
twelve  years  of  experience  at 
the"
"management level in the public sector or in a semi-government organization"
"from the date of obtaining the bachelor’s degree and also the required three"
"years of experience from the date of obtaining the postgraduate degree."
"Nevertheless,  the  Petitioner’s  contention is  that  she  was  the  most  qualified"
"candidate for the advertised position. She alleged that yet, the 1st Respondent"
"selected the 5th Respondent who has lesser qualifications than the Petitioner"
"and who did not fulfil the qualifications referred to in ‘P 3’. Another argument"
"of the Petitioner is that the 5th Respondent’s bachelor’s degree in Bachelor of"
"Science  (Estate  Management  and  Valuation)  as  well  as  the  postgraduate"
"degree of the same category is not a degree that falls under the category of"
"degrees specified in ‘P 3’. The Petitioner submitted that even on a previous"
"occasion,  the  5th  Respondent  applied  for  the  same  post  and  he  was  not"
"selected, among other grounds, on the ground that his bachelor’s degree and"
"the  postgraduate  degree  both  do  not  fall  within 
the  specified  degrees."
"According to ‘P 6’, which is also marked as ‘5 R 1’ by the 5th Respondent, 5th"
"Respondent’s  degree  is  a  Bachelor  of  Science  (Estate  Management  and"
"Valuation). The 5th Respondent stated that his degree falls within the category"
"of ‘management’ in ‘P 3’. The 5th Respondent submitted the letter marked ‘5"
"R  2’  and  contended 
that 
the  degree 
in  Bachelor  of  Science 
(Estate"
"Management and Valuation) is a degree offered by the Faculty of Management"
"Studies and Commerce of the University of the Sri Jayawardhanapura and it"
"is a degree in management."
"The document submitted by the Petitioner herself, marked ‘P 1’ indicates that"
"the scope of study of the degree of Bachelor of Science (Estate Management"
"and  Valuation) 
includes  subjects  such  as  financial  management,  human"
"resource management, management process etc. Therefore, it is clear that the"
"above degree is not confined to studies on estate management. Furthermore,"
"in ‘P 3’ the degree in management is clearly separated from other degrees that"
"are also separated from each other. Therefore, it is clear that any degree in"
"management would fulfil the required qualification."
"The Petitioner stated that the 5th Respondent has only an ordinary pass in the"
"Bachelor  of  Science  degree. The  Petitioner  submitted  the  5th  Respondent’s"
"degree certificate as ‘P 5’. According to ‘P 5’, the 5th Respondent has only an"
"ordinary pass. As it was correctly submitted by the Petitioner, ‘P 3’ requires a"
