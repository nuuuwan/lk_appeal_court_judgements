"referred to in ‘P21’1 demonstrates that the alleged 9th Wash Trade constitutes less than 4.88%"
"of the total quantity of BIL shares traded on 12.12.2020 whilst the other eight purported Wash"
"Trades constitute less than 2.05 of the total quantity of BIL shares traded on the relevant days."
"Thus,  the  Petitioners contend  that  such  transactions  cannot  be  construed  as  a  grave  act  of"
"market manipulation."
"Likewise, the 2nd Petitioner asserts that the reason for his conduct which allegedly resulted in"
"raising the allegations of a 'Wash Trade' was due to receiving ‘Margin Calls’ from his bank"
"and it was not an act done to manipulate the market. In contrast, the Respondents argue that"
"when the SEC contacted the relevant banks they had confirmed that no Margin Calls were"
"made at the time to the Petitioner. Thus, the Respondents emphasize that the Petitioners have"
"provided a false response to the second show cause letter. Further, the Respondents assert"
"that Wash Trade transactions bear a strong potential to distort the stock market as it indicates"
"a high value of trading concerning a particular stock when in actuality the ownership of the"
"shares remains with the same person."
"It is significant to note that the Respondents acknowledge that these unusual activities did not"
"necessarily  cause  the  sudden  surge  in  the  price  of  stocks  and  admit  that  it  may  have  been"
"largely or wholly attributable to the “corporate announcement” by BIL of their affiliation with"
"a  Port  City  Project.    Nonetheless,  the  Respondents  are  of  the  view  that  these  trading"
"operations  are  against  the  aforesaid 
  Rule  12  because  the  2nd  Petitioner's  activity  was"
"“calculated”  to  distort  the  market.  Be  that  as  it  may,  the 
learned  President’s  Counsel"
"appearing on behalf of the Petitioners, through strenuous argument, clarified that there has"
"been no significant increase in the value of the respective shares as an immediate aftermath"
"of the said nine transactions. Therefore, following a careful analysis of the document marked"
"‘P21’,  and  based  on  the  limited  material  available  to  this  Court,    I  am  unable  to  find  any"
"compelling  reason  to  refute  the  stand  taken  by  the  Petitioners  that  the  aforesaid  nine"
"transactions do not violate  Rule 12 of the SEC Rules."
