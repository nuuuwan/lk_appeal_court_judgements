"By virtue of section 148 and section 149 of the Act, every offence committed under Chapter"
"II shall be triable upon indictment by the High Court and every prosecution in respect of such"
"an  offence  shall  be  instituted  and  conducted  by  the  Attorney  General.  The  said  Act  was"
"certified  on  21.09.2021.  By  the  said  Act  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Sri"
"Lanka Act No.36 of 1987 was repealed. The mode of prosecution prescribed in the said Act"
"No.36 of 1987, in respect of any person who is found guilty of an offence under the previous"
"Act (for which no penalty is expressly provided for under the said Act) by way of a summary"
"trial by a Magistrate. Anyhow, the duty of prosecution of offences under the current Act is"
"bestowed on the Attorney General. Section 187(2) (k) of the current Act stipulates that all"
"offences under the provisions of the repealed Act, shall be offences committed under the said"
"repealed Act and be tried accordingly. It is observed as per the letter of the Attorney General"
"marked ‘R5’ that the SEC has sought legal assistance from the Attorney General to institute"
"criminal proceedings and that was after certifying the said Act No.19 of 2021."
"The Attorney General possesses a wide range of powers in respect of prosecutions under the"
"law and some of such powers are described in section 393 of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act No.15 of 1979 (‘CCPA’). In addition to presenting an indictment to the High Court, the"
"Attorney General also enjoys exclusive powers when entering a nolle prosequi, withdrawing an"
"indictment or suspending prosecutions. Section 193 of the CCPA stipulates that in every trial"
"before the High Court, the prosecution shall be conducted by the Attorney General. In cases"
"where  a  magistrate  is  required  to  hold  a  preliminary  inquiry  under  section  145  or  section"
"136(e) of the CCPA, the Magistrate, if he is satisfied with the sufficient evidence commits the"
"accused to stand trial in the High Court and forwards to the Attorney General a copy of the"
"proceedings, together with other relevant documents."
"Therefore, the Attorney General will initiate criminal proceedings only if he is independently"
"satisfied with the sufficiency of evidence and also based on the provisions of the CCPA. In"
"this backdrop, it cannot be assumed that the Attorney General must follow a mere request of"
"the SEC to file an indictment under section 148 of the aforementioned Act or to initiate any"
"criminal proceedings against the 2nd Respondent without the Attorney General arriving at an"
"independent finding upon the alleged offences."
