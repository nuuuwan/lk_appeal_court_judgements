"cause letters through the subsequent two documents marked ‘P7’ and ‘P9’, where he has even"
"provided an explanation about some of the alleged unusual trading activities being a genuine"
"mistake on his part, which occurred due to the 2nd Petitioner placing a BUY order in place of"
"a SELL order."
"In  light  of  the  above,  it  is  difficult  to  arrive  at  a  conclusion  without  substantial  and  stable"
"evidence as to whether the actions of the 2nd Petitioner were done in a calculated manner, as"
"required under Rule 12 to distort the stock market. As such, an additional issue arises in whose"
"favour the burden of proof would lie. This is because the Respondents assert that an attempt"
"at market manipulation has been made, especially when there is seemingly no clear impact"
"by the actions of the 2nd Petitioner on the price of the relevant shares."
"Anyhow, the Respondents stand firm on their argument that causality between conduct and"
"outcome  is  not  necessary  for  the  2nd  Petitioner  to  violate  the  said  Rule  12.  This  is  further"
"emphasized by the learned Deputy Solicitor General drawing an analogy through his own"
"creative words as mentioned below:"
"“Assume, one shoots a man at point-blank range with the intention to cause his death, but he"
"misses,  and  at  the  next  moment,  the  intended  victim  is  gunned  down  by  a  sniper  acting"
"independently. Can the fact that the shooter's objective (of causing the man’s death) was realized"
"through an external agency excuse the malevolent behavior? The answer of course is an emphatic"
"NO!”"
"However, in the event that the 2nd Petitioner may have made a genuine mistake in carrying"
"out the trading activities, the respondent shall have an obligation to reinforce their stand by"
"presenting the Court with sufficient proof. The aforesaid analogy in fact helps me to come to"
"a clear understanding of the complexity of issues in this case which can only be resolved with"
"clear and consistent information. This is a key element to conclude that an accused party or"
"the 2nd Petitioner must know without any ambiguity the case against them to formulate their"
"defense effectively."
"For the reasons explained above, the notion of 'right to know the opposing case' is crucial"
"when determining the questions of this case. Accordingly, at this stage, I need to draw my"
"attention  to  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the  2nd Petitioner  on  the  perspective  of  the"
