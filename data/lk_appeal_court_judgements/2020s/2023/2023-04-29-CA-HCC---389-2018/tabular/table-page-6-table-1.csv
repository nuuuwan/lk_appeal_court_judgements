"incident  hence  the  identification  of  the  appellant  has  to  be  presumed  by"
"surmising  and  conjecturing  which 
is  not 
in  accordance  with  our 
legal"
"system."
"The learned Judge had not addressed his mind to the state of illumination"
"at the time of the incident. But this Court is unable to understand as to how"
"he had presumed that the appellant was adequately identified."
"This Court also notes that the learned High Court Judge had gone in to, too"
"much detail as to why the evidence of the victim should be believed but we"
"note that he was unable to observe the demeanor and the deportment of"
"the 
lay  witnesses  which 
is 
very 
important 
in 
view  of 
the  mental"
"inadequacies  of  the  victim  which  had  been  recorded  by  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge who heard her evidence."
"Hence  it  is  the  considered  view  of  this  Court  that  in  a  case  of  rape  the"
"evidence of the victim is very important, it does not necessarily have to be"
"corroborated by another lay witness but it has to be evidence the Court can"
"rely upon."
"But 
in  the 
instant  case  we  observe  that  the  evidence  of  the  victim 
is"
"waivered  and  appears  to  be  very  unnatural  and,  in  several  instances,  she"
"had admitted that she was giving evidence on the instructions of someone"
"else and it had taken much effort on the part of the prosecuting Counsel to"
"get the name of the appellant."
"Furthermore,  it  is  very  hard  to  disregard  the  observation  by  the  learned"
"High Court Judge who had heard the evidence of the victim in totality."
