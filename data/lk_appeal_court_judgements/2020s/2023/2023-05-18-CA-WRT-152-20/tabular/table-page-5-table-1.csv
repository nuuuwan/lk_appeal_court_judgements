"Association V Director General of Health Services and Others (CA  Writ"
"Application No. 861/93)."
"Having considered the Written submissions and the decisions of apex Courts"
"with regard to this matter, it is the view of this Court that generally speaking,"
"the  intervention  cannot  be  allowed  in  Writ    Applications  in  the  absence  of"
"specific rules formulated by the Supreme Court providing for the procedure"
"permitting  third  parties  to  intervene  in  Writ    Applications.  However,  if  the"
"intervenient Petitioner can establish the fact that the Court cannot arrive at"
"a  final determination without making him a party and/or his rights will be"
"affected by the Petition filed by the Petitioner, the intervention can be allowed."
"In  the  instant  Application  the  intervenient  Petitioner  is  seeking  the  same"
"reliefs  that  are  prayed  for  in  the  Petition.  It  appears  to  this Court  that  the"
"intervenient Petitioner is in support of the Petitioner. There is no impediment"
"for the intervenient Petitioner to challenge the impugned liquor license issued"
"to the 7th Respondent in a fresh Application."
"Having considered the facts and circumstances of these Applications, it is the"
"view of this Court that the intervenient Petitioner is not a necessary party for"
"the final determination of the instant Application. Moreover, the Application"
"filed by the Petitioner will not affect the rights of the intervenient Petitioner."
"Thus, the Application for intervention is refused."
"Application refused. No costs."
