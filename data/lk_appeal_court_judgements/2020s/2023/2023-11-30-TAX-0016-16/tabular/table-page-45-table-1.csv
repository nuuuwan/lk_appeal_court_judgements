"and  to  the  grammatical  construction,  unless  that 
is  at  variance  with  the"
"intention of the legislature, to be derived from the statute itself.”"
"H
ere using the word in its ordinary meaning was in variance with the intention"
"of the legislature, which was to be derived from the statute itself, because the"
"term used was not “tool” as the Tax Appeal Commission thought but “industrial"
"tool manufacturing.”"
"T
he  use  of  the  prefix  “industrial”  before  the  term  “tool  manufacturing”"
"alters its ordinary meaning."
"T
herefore  it  is  clear  that  the  appellant  is  entitled  to  the  exemption  from  tax"
"because  it  is  engaged  in  “industrial  tool  manufacturing”  which  is  a  “specified"
"undertaking”."
"H
owever, the question of law No. 06 is not correctly formulated, in the sense, it"
"should have referred not to “industrial  manufacturing”, but to “industrial tool"
"manufacturing”. Hence while the said question of law has to be answered in the"
"negative,  the  answer  must  accompany  with  an  explanation  that  the  term"
"“industrial and machine tool manufacturing” can be interpreted as “industrial"
"tool manufacturing” and “machine tool manufacturing”, in which the appellant’s"
"product comes within the former."
"T
herefore the Questions of Law are answered as follows,"
"Question No. 01 – “Yes”"
"Question No. 02 – “Yes”"
"Question No. 03(a) – “Yes”"
"Question No. 03(b) – “Yes”"
