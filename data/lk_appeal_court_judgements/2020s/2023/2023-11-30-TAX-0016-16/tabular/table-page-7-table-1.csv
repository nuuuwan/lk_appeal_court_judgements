"“The  section  163(5)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  is  a  procedural  law.  It"
"regulates the procedure of sending an assessment against the assessee by"
"an assessor in the event that the tax return sent by the assessee is not"
"accepted  by  the  assessor.  Even  if  the  amendment  has  a  retrospective"
"effect, it applies, if the amendment is only on procedural law. No party can"
"have vested right on procedure.”"
