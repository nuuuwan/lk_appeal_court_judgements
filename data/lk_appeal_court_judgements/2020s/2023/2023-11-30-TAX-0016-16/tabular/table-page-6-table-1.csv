"The  Inland  Revenue  (amendment)  Act  No.  22  of  2011  was  endorsed  by  the"
"Speaker on 31st March 2011."
"As Inland Revenue (amendment) Act No.22 of 2011 was endorsed by the Speaker"
"on 31.03.2011, it has come into operation after the year of assessment relevant"
"to this case. The relevant year ended on 31.03.2011."
"In CA (TAX) 23/20131 decided by another division of this court on 25.05.2015,"
"(Judgment of Justice Dehideniya) the respondent, the Commissioner General of"
"Inland Revenue (who is also the respondent in this appeal) had taken a two fold"
"argument.  It  is  said  at  page  3  of  the  said  case.  “one  argument  is  that  the"
"amendment came into force within the eighteen month period where the"
"assessor  was  entitled  to  send  the  assessment  against  the  assessee  and"
"therefore the extension of time period is applicable. The other argument is"
"that  it  is  a  procedural  law  and  any  change  in  the  procedural  law  can  be"
"considered as an amendment with retrospective effect.”"
"The first argument aforesaid, if correct, will apply to the year of assessment in"
"this appeal, because the  eighteen month period ended on 30.09.2009 and the"
"amendment came before that on 31.03.2009. In the said case CA (TAX) 23/2013"
"it was decided at page 5."
