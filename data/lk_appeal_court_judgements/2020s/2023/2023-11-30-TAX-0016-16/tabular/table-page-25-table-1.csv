"(g) If  giving  reasons 
is  after 
the  sending  of  notice 
the  purpose  of 
the"
"amendment by law No. 30 of 1978 will be defeated"
"Hence whereas Justice Victor Perera said giving reasons should precede sending"
"notice  of  assessment,  the  learned  Chief  Justice  said  “His  reasons  must  be"
"communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an-estimated"
"later  communication  would  defeat  the 
income9.”  He 
further  said,  “Any"
"remedial  action  intended  by  the  amendment.” Hence whereas the Court of"
"Appeal said giving reasons must precede notice of assessment and the Supreme"
"Court said reasons can be given at  the time of the notice of assessment,  both"
"courts agreed that giving reasons cannot be after the sending of the notice of"
"assessment, which both courts considered as synonymous with making the"
"assessment."
"Hence  although  it  is  correct  to  say  that  both  the  aforesaid  cases  [Ismail  vs."
"Commissioner of Income Tax, as well as D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail] were not on"
"the  point  whether 
“making 
the  assessment”  as  well  as 
“giving  notice  of"
"assessment,”  must  be  within  the  stipulated  time  period,  they  both  took  it  for"
"granted, in their analysis of the procedure, that “making the assessment” is same"
"as “giving notice of assessment”. Whereas Justice Victor Perera said that giving"
"reasons 
for  non  acceptance  of 
the 
return  should  precede 
the  notice  of"
"assessment,  the  learned  Chief  Justice  said  that  reasons  should  be  sent  at  or"
"about  the  time  of  giving  notice  of  assessment  and  any  later  communication"
"would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment."
"Therefore  both  Justice  Victor  Perera  and  the  learned  Chief  Justice  have"
"based  their  judgments  on  the  premise  that  “making  the  assessment”  is"
"same as “giving notice of assessment”. This was why it had been argued in"
"C.A. (Tax) 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first"
