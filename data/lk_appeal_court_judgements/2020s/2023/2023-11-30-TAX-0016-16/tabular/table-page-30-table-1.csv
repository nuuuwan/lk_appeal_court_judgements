"question in the present case is not as to when reasons has to be given, but as to"
"whether an assessment becomes a valid one only when “notice of assessment” is"
"given. Hence what was said in this passage was said in orbiter."
"Hence it is clear that giving reasons (letters of intimation as they are sometimes"
"referred to in arguments) is ideally before making an assessment. Hence further"
"there is no “assessment” at the time of giving reasons, unless, as opined by the"
"learned Chief Justice, reasons accompany the  statutory notice. As per section"
"163(5)  the  time  bar  has  to  be  counted  from  the  “assessment”.  This  is  a  valid"
"“assessment,” not an “estimate.” Therefore it cannot be the letter giving reasons"
"or a letter of intimation, because there cannot exist an “assessment” at the stage"
"of the said letter. The “assessment” comes later after the taxpayer, is given the"
"statutory notice of assessment."
"The same principal adopted in  Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax and"
"D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, that “assessment” becomes valid only"
"when statutory “notice of assessment” is given, was followed in the Indian Case"
"of The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth Khemchand Thaoomal"
"and  others,  1923  decided  in  the  Court  of  the  Judicial  Commissioner,  Sind,"
"Reports  of  Income  Tax  cases,  Vol.  I  (1886-1925)  printed  at  the  Madras  Law"
