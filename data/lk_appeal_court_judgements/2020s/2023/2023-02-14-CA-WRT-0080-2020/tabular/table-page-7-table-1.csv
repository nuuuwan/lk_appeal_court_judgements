"This Court is mindful of the fact that the acquisition took placed in 1978"
"and the deed of gift marked as P2, by which the Petitioner claims title to"
"the  land  was  executed  in  2009.  After  the  acquisition,  the  land  is  vested"
"with the State and the Original owner did not have the title to gift the land"
"to  the  Petitioner  by  deed  P2,  therefore,  it  is  well  established  that  the"
"Petitioner has no title to the land in dispute. In these circumstances, the"
"Petitioner has no locus-standi to proceed with this Application."
"Moreover, as per prayer (c), the Petitioner, under section 39 (1) of the Land"
"Acquisition Act, is seeking to revoke the vesting Order marked P11, and in"
"prayer (d), under section 39 (A) of the said Act,  seeking a Mandamus to"
"divest the land to the Petitioner. If the Court grants the relief in prayer (c),"
"the relief in prayer (d) cannot be granted. Similarly, if relief in prayer (d) is"
"granted, relief in prayer (c) cannot be granted. The said inconsistency in"
"the  prayers  to  the  Petition  is  also  an  impediment  to  the  instant  Petition"
"being proceeded with."
"In these circumstances, I see that there is no basis to issue notices on the"
"Respondents.  Thus,  I  refuse  to  issue  notices  on  the  Respondents  and"
"dismiss the Application without costs."
"Application dismissed."
