"following police investigation led to the arrest of the Accused, who was found in possession of"
"a set of keys to the house and a mobile phone."
"Conversely,  the  defense  asserted  that  the  Accused  had  left  the  residence,  leaving"
"behind his bicycle, to stay at his cousin's house. He claimed that there had been no animosity"
"between him and the Deceased."
"Upon  considering  the  evidence  presented  by the  prosecution,  it  becomes  clear  that"
"there is no direct evidence against the Accused. While both the Deceased and the Accused"
"resided  in  the  same  house  and  the  Accused  was  found  with  a  set  of  keys  and  a  Nokia"
"cellphone,  there  is  no  substantiated  evidence  to  prove  that  the  phone  belonged  to  the"
"Deceased."
"Additionally,  we  observe  that  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  no  other  person"
"lived in or visited the house at that time. Moreover, no evidence exists to show that only the"
"Deceased and the Accused had keys to the residence."
"I am of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish sufficient evidence. The"
"only inescapable conclusion is that the Accused is not proven to have committed the murder"
"of Mohomed Subair Athm Abul Sathar."
"Therefore, we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt"
"that  the  Accused  committed  the  murder.  Accordingly,  we  set  aside  the  conviction  and"
"sentence, and we acquit the Accused."
"This Appeal is allowed."
