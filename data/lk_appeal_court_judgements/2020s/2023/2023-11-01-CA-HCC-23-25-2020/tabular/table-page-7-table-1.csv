"into her legs and not into the private part of the virtual complainant. If such, a fact took"
"place and existed, it was within the power of the accused to come out with that explanation"
"and to refute the charge of rape. Though the accused made a dock statement he has failed"
"to explain away the incriminating circumstances and prima facie case established against"
"him by indulging in any such explanation. Then as wise and prudent judges often observe"
"in  those  circumstances  both  common  sense  and  logic  induce  any  Court  to  come  to  the"
"conclusion  that  the  accused  did  not  come  out  with  such  an  explanation  because  such"
"circumstances  never  existed.  The  accused  in  his  utterly  deficient  dock  statement  has"
"merely stated thus.     කිසි  ෙැරද්දක් ක්ේ නැ ැ. ්ප ෙති ත යි තර ට කියො ති්බේ්ේ. කිත්සිරි"
"ස ග  ්ේ කිසි  ෙරදක් වී නැ ැ. That is the bare and the deficient dock statement made by"
"the accused. In view of the deficiency in the dock statement, this Court is entitled to draw"
"the presumptions and inferences arising from such a deficiency in terms of the speeches"
"of Lord Ellenborough in Rex v. Cochrane-Gurney’s Reports 479 and of Justice Abbott in"
"Rex v. Burdet (1820 4 Band Alderman 95 at 120).”"
"In  the  present  case,  the  evidence  indicates  that  all  three  Accused  individuals"
"boarded the bus, brandished a manna knife, issued death threats, and forcibly removed"
"the deceased during broad daylight, within a crowded bus where members of the public"
"were witnesses. Shortly after this incident, the discovery of the deceased's body occurred,"
"and the Accused failed to provide any explanation for the incriminating evidence."
"Considering the  evidence presented,  it  becomes evident that  the  only conclusive"
"and inescapable inference the court can draw is that all three Accused were responsible"
"for the murder of the deceased individual."
"The  next  question  that  arises  is  when  the  proceedings  move  forward,  the  Trial"
"Judge  should  issue  a  comprehensive  judicial  order.  This  question  was  considered  by"
"Justice, S. Thurairaja PC, J in The Attorney General v. Daradadagamage Chandraratne,"
