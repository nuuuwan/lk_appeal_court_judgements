"Meanwhile, the 2nd Accused brandished a manna knife in an attempt to stab the"
"deceased, but another passenger intervened, wresting the knife from the said Accused's"
"grasp. All three Accused then collectively removed the deceased from the bus, placing him"
"inside a nearby parked lorry. It's worth noting that PW01 identified this lorry, as it was"
"frequently used for transporting goods to the aforementioned market."
"As  they  escorted  the  deceased  away  from  the  bus,  the  Accused  informed  the"
"passengers that they were taking him to the police due to his alleged involvement in a"
"stabbing incident at the Baduruliya Market. Consequently, the passengers refrained from"
"intervening in the abduction."
