"loading on board the ship, and the other of exporting."
"However, Section 16 is a deeming provision."
"N.S. Bindra has stated the following on deeming provisions in a Statute17:"
"‘Where the legislature says that ‘something should be deemed to"
"have been done’ which in truth has not been done, it creates a"
"legal fiction and, in that case, the court is entitled and bound to"
"ascertain  for  what  purposes  and  between  what  persons  the"
"statutory fiction is to be resorted to and full effect must be given"
"to  the  statutory  fiction  and  it  should  be  carried  to  its  logical"
"conclusion.’"
"It is further stated, citing Gajraj Singh v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal18:"
"‘ (…) that legal fiction is one which is not an actual reality but"
"which  the  law  recognizes  and  the  court  accepts  as  a  reality."
"Therefore, in case of legal fiction the court believes something"
"to  exist  which  in  reality  does  not  exist.  It  is  nothing  but  the"
"presumption  of  the  existence  of  the  state  of  affairs  which  in"
"actuality is non-existent. The effect of such a legal fiction is that"
"a position which otherwise would not obtain is deemed to obtain"
"under the circumstances.’"
