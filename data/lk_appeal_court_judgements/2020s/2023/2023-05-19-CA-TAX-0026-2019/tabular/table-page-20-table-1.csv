"However, as I have already stated in this judgment, marine bunker fuel which"
"is consumed by the ship on its journey may not reach a foreign destination."
"Yet, in my view, for marine bunker fuel to be treated as having been exported,"
"it should be supplied to a ship that is outbound from Sri Lanka. It is obvious"
"that  a  ship  that  leaves  the  territory  of  Sri  Lanka  will  not  stay  in  high  seas"
"indefinitely. It should reach a foreign port. If the same ship returns to a Sri"
"Lankan port due to some unforeseen or catastrophic event, the supply could"
"still be treated as an export, but not otherwise."
"The Appellant cited the judgment of this Court in the case of Nanayakkara v."
"University of Peradeniya25 wherein S. N. Silva J., (as he then was) held as"
"follows regarding the manner in which tax exemptions must be interpreted:"
"‘A necessary corollary of applying the rule of strict construction to determine"
"liability under a taxing statute, is that any provision granting an exemption"
"from such liability is to be given its full effect. Exemptions are provided for by"
"the Legislature for the purpose of giving a measure of relief to a person who"
"would  otherwise  be  liable  to  tax  under  the  general  rule.  Therefore,  no"
"restriction should be placed on such provisions by way of interpretation so as"
"to defeat the purpose of granting such exemption.’"
"The view expressed by our Courts in the above case and in a line of authorities"
"was that tax exemptions also should be strictly interpreted as other provisions"
"of a taxing statute."
"However,  the  Appellant,  citing  the  following  extract  from  the  more  recent"
"decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Government of Kerala v."
"Mother  Superior  Adoration  Convent26,  argued  that  exemptions  claimed  by"
"taxpayers are ‘beneficial and promotional exemptions’ and therefore, have to"
"be liberally interpreted:"
"“[…]  the  rule  regarding  exemptions is that  exemption  should  generally  be"
"strictly 
interpreted  but  beneficial  exemptions  having 
their  purpose  as"
"encouragement  or  promotion  of  certain  activities 
should  be 
liberally"
"interpreted. This composite rule is not stated in any particular judgment in so"
"many words. In fact, majority of the judgements emphasise that exemptions"
"are to be strictly interpreted while some of them insist that exemptions in fiscal"
"statues are to be liberally interpreted giving an apparent impression that they"
"are contradictory to each other. But this is only apparent. A close scrutiny"
