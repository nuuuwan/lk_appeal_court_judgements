"it will be substituting the language chosen by Parliament with"
"some other form of words and in an attempt at wide survey, some"
"essential  factor  will  be  omitted  or  some  inessential  factor  be"
"substituted or added."
"Hence, I am of the view that it is unsafe to rely on the interpretations given in"
"other statutes to the word ‘export’, especially in interpreting a fiscal statute"
"enacted for fiscal purposes. Therefore, on the available material, I will proceed"
"to decide within the words of the Inland Revenue Act itself."
"The Appellant advanced a further argument citing the judgement of the Indian"
"Supreme Court State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. Shanmugha Vilas"
"Cashew  Nut  Factory  and  Others21  and  a  judgment  of  the  United  State"
"Supreme Court Empresa Siderurgica, S. A. v. Country of Merced22 that the"
"above two judgments affirm the position that goods which have entered the"
"stream  of  export  are  in  fact  exports.  Accordingly,  it  was  contended  that"
"lubricants that enter the bonded warehouses have entered the export stream"
"and must not be denied tax exemptions given to the exports under the Inland"
"Revenue Act."
"H
owever,  as  I  have  already  stated  elsewhere  in  this  judgment,  petroleum"
"products  are  imported  to  Sri  Lanka  and  kept  in  bonded  warehouses  until"
"supplied to the ships. Any other product exported from Sri Lanka will enter"
"the bonded warehouses  once those are ready to be exported.  Accordingly,"
"like any other product, lubricants kept in the bonded warehouses cannot be"
"considered to have entered the stream of export."
"T
he Legislature itself has recognized petroleum gas or petroleum products as"
"a product exported from Sri Lanka23. Being a country, which does not have"
"petroleum  resources,  it  is  obvious  that  the  export  of  petroleum  products"
"referred to in Section 42 (1) (b) has to be petroleum products imported and re-"
"exported.  However,  it  is  a  known  factor  that  Sri  Lanka  does  not  re-export"
"petroleum products to other countries. Therefore, invariably, the export meant"
"by section 42 (1) (b) has to be the supplies made to ships and/or air crafts etc."
