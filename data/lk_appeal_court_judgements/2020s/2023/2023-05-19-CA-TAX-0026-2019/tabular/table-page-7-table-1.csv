"Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [C.A.]9. The facts of the case are"
"set out below. Under Section 106 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act  No. 10 of"
"2006, the taxpayer was required to file the return of income on or before the"
"30th  day  of  September  immediately  succeeding  the  end  of  that  year  of"
"assessment.  Accordingly,  if  the  Assessor  does  not  accept  the  return  and"
"proceeds to make an assessment, the Assessor has to make the assessment on"
"or before the 30th of September 2009, after the expiry of eighteen months from"
"the end of the year of assessment. Accordingly, the taxpayer filed the return"
"within the prescribed time frame. In this instance before the 30th September"
"2008. Subsequently, by Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009,"
"the  Legislature  extended  the  period  for  a  taxpayer  to  file  a  return  by  two"
"months, until 30th November 2008, and the time period for the Assessor to"
"make an assessment by six months, until 31st of March 2010. By the time the"
"taxpayer has already submitted his return before the 30th day of September,"
"under Section 106 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, the principal"

"amended by amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 which was brought into operation"
"with effect from 31st March 2009. As regards Section 27 of Amendment Act"
"No 19 of 2009, certain Sections have retrospective effect as of the dates set"
"out therein, but Section 163 (5) is not included.  The Court of Appeal held that"
"Section 163 (5) being a procedural law the amendment to the said Section has"
"a retrospective effect and the taxpayer does not have a vested right in having"
"his assessment made under the law on which he filed his return and therefore,"
"the assessment is not time-barred."
"On  appeal,  the  Supreme  Court  considered  the  matter  in  detail  and  held"
"otherwise."
"Under Article 75 of the constitution, the legislature has the power to make"
"laws, including laws having retrospective effect."
"As  a  general  rule,  amendments  to  the  procedural  laws  are  deemed  to  have"
"retrospective  effect.  The  amendments  made  to  substantive  provisions  are"
"always  with  prospective  effect  unless  specifically  made  retrospective.  His"
