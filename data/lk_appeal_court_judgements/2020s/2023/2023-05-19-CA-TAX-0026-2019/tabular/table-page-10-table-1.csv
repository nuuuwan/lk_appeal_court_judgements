"accepting the return only on the 27th November 2013 with a calculation of the"
"total  tax  payable.  As  I  have  already  stated  above  in  this  judgment,  it  is"
"common ground that the assessment was made on the 27th November 2013."
"The learned Senior Additional Solicitor General for the  Respondent argued"
"that the essence of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Seylan"
"Bank v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [S.C.]13 is that since the"
"taxpayer  could  not  make  use  of  the  benefit  of  the  additional  two  months"
"granted to submit the return by the amendment, the Respondent also is not"
"entitled  to  make  use  of  the  additional  six  months  granted  to  make  the"
"assessment. She relied on the following observations made by the Supreme"
"Court ‘…the law should not be interpreted to give an advantage to an assessor"
"and  deprive  a  taxpayer.  Article  12  (1)  of  the  Constitution  states  that  ‘all"
"persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of"
"the law’. Hence, the amendments made to section 163 (5) (a) read with section"
"106 (1) of the principal Act should be interpreted to secure the rights of both"
"taxpayers and assessors of the Department of Inland Revenue’.  However, in"
"my view, this is only a passing remark in the judgment and therefore, an obiter"
"dictum.  The  ratio  decidendi  is  on  the  interpretation  of  Section  27  of  the"
"Amending Act. As  such,  the  learned  Senior Additional  Solicitor  General's"
"argument is not well-founded."
"In light of the aforementioned facts, it is clear that the Assessor failed to make"
"the assessment on or before the 31st of March 2013. Hence, I hold that the"
"assessment is time-barred."
"Accordingly, I answer the first question of law in the affirmative, in favour of"
"the Appellant."
