"for and enforced according to the new form of procedure. Alterations in the"
"form of procedure are always retrospective unless there is some good reason"
"or other why they should not be.’"
"Although the amendment Act was certified on the 31st March 2009, the dates"
"on which the amendments made by the said amending Act should come into"
"force are expressly set out in Section 27 of the amendment Act No. 19 of 2009."
"Accordingly,  His  Lordship  scrutinized  Section  27  and  held  that  only  the"
"Sections referred to in Section 27 (1) to (5) of the amending Act would operate"
"with retrospective effect from the specified dates, and the Sections that are not"
"referred to would operate with prospective effect from the 1st of April 2009,"
"in terms of Section 27 (6) of the amending Act wherein it is enacted that other"
"than the amendments specifically referred to in Section 27 (1), (2), (3), (4) and"
"(5), shall come into force on 1st April 2009. Consequently, His Lordship held"
"that the amendments made to Sections 106 (1) and 163 (5) (a) by amendment"
"Act No. 19 of 2009 have no application to the year of assessment 2007/2008."
"Therefore, the opinion expressed by the Supreme Court was based on the fact"
"that the acts to be performed under these sections  are linked to the  year of"
"assessment. These findings are further supported by the title of Act No. 10 of"
"2006 which reads thus; ‘An Act To Provide For The Imposition Of Income Tax"
"For Any Year of Assessment (…)’. As such it is clearly manifested that the"
"purpose of the Act is to tax income on a year-by-year basis."
"The phraseology of Section 56 of Amendment Act No. 22 of 2011 is almost"
"identical to Section 27 of Amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 which was subject"
"to  scrutiny  by  the  Supreme  Court.  The  provisions  which  should  have  the"
"retrospective operation are specifically set out whereas the other provisions"
"should have the prospective operation, from 1st April 2011."
"Consequently, in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of"
"Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue  [S.C.]12  the"
"amendment made to Section 163 (5) by Amendment Act No.22 of 2011 which"
"came into operation with effect from 1st April 2011 should not apply to the"
"case at hand where the year of assessment is 2010/2011."
"Accordingly, the Assessor should have made his assessment on or before the"
"31st March 2013. The Assessor sent his letter communicating reasons for not"
