"Lordship  Justice  Priyantha  Jayawardena,  P.C.","in  his  judgment  cited 
the"
"judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur",""
"& others v. State of Maharashtra & others10 wherein it was held;",""
"(i)","A  statute  which  affects  substantive  rights  is  presumed  to  be"
"","prospective 
in  operation  unless  made 
retrospective,  either"
"","expressly or by necessary intendment, whereas a statute which"
"","merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is textually"
"","impossible,  is  presumed  to  be  retrospective  in  its  application,"
"","should not be given an extended meaning and should be strictly"
"","confined to its clearly defined limits;"
"(ii)","Law  relating  to  forum  and  limitation  is  procedural  in  nature,"
"","whereas law relating to right of action and right of appeal, even"
"","though remedial, is substantive in nature;"
"(iii)","Every litigant has a vested rights in substantive law, but no such"
"","right exists in procedural law;"
"(iv)","A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied"
"","retrospectively,  where 
the 
result  would  be 
to  create  new"
"","disabilities or obligations, or to impose new duties in respect of"
"","transactions already accomplished; and"
"(v)","A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates"
"","new rights and liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in"
"","operation,  unless  otherwise  provided,  either  expressly  or  by"
"","necessary implication."
