"Furthermore, it is my considered opinion that the export of bunker fuel, which"
"would  be  consumed  by  a  ship  during  its  journey,  is  different  from  the"
"traditional  export  of  cargo  where  the  goods  are  exported  to  a  specified"
"recipient in an overseas destination."
"A
nother  perspective  argument  is  that  the  intention  of  the  Legislature  in"
"introducing the  legislative provisions  relevant to  this  case  is not fiscal,  but"
"economic, and was to increase foreign reserves by encouraging export, which"
"in return brings in foreign exchange. Therefore, the Appellant’s sale of marine"
"bunker fuel, a transaction in foreign currency, constitutes an export."
"H
owever, in my view, this may be one of several criteria which could be taken"
"into consideration in deciding whether a transaction is an export or not but,"
"not the decisive factor. There may be many more local transactions done in"
"foreign currency that would not constitute an export."
"T
he TAC arrived at the conclusion that the Appellant’s sale of marine bunker"
"fuel  to  foreign  vessels  cannot  be  treated  as  an  export  and  therefore,  the"
"Appellant is not entitled to the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 and"
"51 of the Inland Revenue Act, as amended, on the ground that the goods need"
"to have a foreign destination necessitating an importer; export and import need"
"to go in pairs."
"H
owever, this Court is of a different opinion on the above issue, and as stated"
"above in this judgment the test is whether the marine bunker fuel is supplied"
"to ships leaving the Sri Lankan territory to a foreign destination."
"Nevertheless, the final conclusion of the TAC as well as of this Court is that"
"the  Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  the  concessionary  tax  rates.  Therefore,  no"
"prejudice to the substantial rights of the Appellant or a failure of justice has"
"occurred due to the difference of opinion of the TAC and this Court on the"
"above issue."
"I therefore answer the second questions of law in the negative, in favour of"
"the Respondent, for the purpose of this case."
"Thus, having considered all the arguments presented to this Court and in view"
"of  the  above  analysis  I  answer  the  two  questions  of  law  in  the  following"
"manner."
