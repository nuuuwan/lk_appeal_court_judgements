"meaning of words used in an Act of Parliament in the definition"
"clause  of  other  statutes  dealing  with  matters  more  or

"cognate,  even  when  enacted  by 
the  same 
legislature.  Even"
"otherwise,  the  definition  of  an  expression  contained  in  one"
"enactment cannot furnish any safe guideline for determining the"
"scope  and  contents  of  the  same  expression  used  in  different"
"context in a separate enactment. (…) Where a definition is given"
"in an Act, it should be confined as a general rule to interpret the"
"word defined for that Act only and not explain the meaning of"
"the word in another statute, particularly when the two statutes"
"are not in pari materia. The definition given in a statute is for"
"effectuating the provisions of that statute and not for effectuating"
"the  provisions  of  another  statute.  A  definition  given  in  an  Act"
"cannot  be  used 
for  purposes  of  another  Act.  The  material"
