"imposition  of,  a  tax  on  the  sale  or  purchase  of  goods  where  such  sale  or"
"purchase takes place - in the course of the import of the goods into, or export"
"of goods out of, the territory of India’ (emphasis added)."
"The  other  provisions  considered  by 
the  Indian  Supreme  Court  are  also"
"different from the Sri Lankan provisions."
"The relevance of statutory provisions outside the Inland Revenue Act is also"
"dealt with separately, elsewhere in this judgment."
"Be  that as it may, the following observations made by the Indian Supreme"
"Court in the above judgment regarding the definition of the word ‘export’"
"(reproduced below), are relevant to the matter in issue;"
"‘The word export may conceivably be used in more senses than one. In one"
"sense, ‘export’ may mean sending or taking out of the country, but in another"
"sense, it  may  mean  sending goods  from one  country to another.  Often,  the"
"latter involves a commercial transaction but not necessarily. The country to"
"which the goods are thus sent is said to import them, and the words ‘export’"
"and ‘import’ in this sense are complimentary.’"
"In order to explain the above difference, Hidayathulla J., used an illustration"
"where goods ordered by the health authorities to be destroyed by dumping"
"them in the sea, and for that purpose are taken out of the territories, cannot be"
"said to have been exported. On the contrary, if the goods are put on board a"
"ship bound for a foreign country but, for some reason dumped in the sea, they"
"can still be said to have been exported, even though they do not reach their"
"destination. Therefore, it appears that in both instances, though goods have"
"been taken out of the territory, the first example does not constitute an export"
"whereas the second example does."
"Hidayathulla  J.,  explained  the  difference  between  the  two  scenarios  in  the"
"following manner."
"‘The difference lies in the fact that whereas the goods, in the first example,"
"had no foreign destination, the goods, in the second example, had. It means"
"therefore, that while all exports involve a taking out of the country, all goods"
"taken out of the country cannot be said to be exported. The test is that the"
"goods  must  have  a  foreign  destination  where 
they  can  be  said  to  be"
"imported.’ (emphasis added)"
