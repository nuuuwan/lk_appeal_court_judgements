"dated  01.08.2022  and  pleading  that  the  order  of  the  High  Court  is  irregular,"
"illegal  and  contrary  to 
law,  the  petitioner  pleads  the 
following  exceptional"
"circumstances before this Court."
"1.  The 
petitioner 
avers 
that 
the 
suspects 
have 
been 
treated  with"
"discrimination  where  the  4th  and  the  5th  suspect  has  been  granted  bail"
"while the petitioner and the 2nd suspect languish in remand custody."
"2.  The respondent has concocted or falsified facts against the petitioner."
"In  the  event  the  circumstances  averred  are  deemed  to  be  of  such  exceptional"
"nature  warranting  an 
intervention, 
this  Court  will  exercise 
its  revisionary"
"jurisdiction against the impugned order of the High Court."
"However, in considering the first averment, this Court is of the observation that"
"the  circumstances  of  the  suspects,  although  transpired  in  the  same  series  of"
"events, cannot be treated as the same, as the suspects in question, namely the"
"2nd and the 3rd suspects, were caught in the act of packaging heroin along with"
"the electronic weighing equipment used for the said purpose. The 2nd suspect was"
"in possession of 32.1 grams of heroin and the 3rd suspect i.e. the petitioner was"
"in  possession  of  28.450  grams  of  heroin  which  amounts  to  a  commercial"
"quantity."
"The  above  circumstances  of  the  suspects  evince  the  gravity  of  the  offence"
"committed and as such the treatment of other suspects in this regard does not"
"amount to exceptional circumstances as the 4th suspect was granted bail under"
"the Covid 19 circular issued on 13.08.2021 and the 5th suspect was granted bail"
"as he was not in possession of illegal substances at the time of arrest."
"As such, it is the view of this Court that the primary pleading of the petitioner"
"that  the  suspects  have  been  treated  with  discrimination  is  without  credit  and"
"refutable as the circumstances surrounding the suspects cannot be treated alike."
"The  pure  quantity  of  heroin  possessed  infers  a  commercial  purpose  for  such"
"possession  of  drugs  and 
the  utensils  recovered  during 
the  arrest 
further"
"buttresses the gravity of the offence and the commercial nature of the act which"
"manifests a prima facie case against the two suspects."
