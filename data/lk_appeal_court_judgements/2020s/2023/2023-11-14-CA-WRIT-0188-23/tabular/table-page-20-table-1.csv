"invoked. The Petitioners are abusing or misusing the Writ Jurisdiction for private contractual"
"matters and collateral or extraneous purposes."
"Learned President's Counsel for the 8th and 9th Respondent says that the Petitioners are guilty"
"of  laches.  The  Leaseholders  have  written  to  the  NBRO,  and  verified  the  truth  of  the  NBRO"
"report, and also received further clarification as to the ruinous state of the subject building. The"
"subject  building  is  in  a  ruinous  state,  and  also  is  partially  demolished.  It  is  true  that  not"
"completing the demolishing of the building poses grave threat to the safety and well-being of"
"the occupant, and the public."
"The principles governing interim relief are not in favour of the Petitioners. It is my view that the"
"Learned Magistrate properly, duly, and lawfully made the impugned order. Hence, there is no"
"valid matter to be considered under the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court."
"For the reasons stated above, the Petition dismissed with cost."
