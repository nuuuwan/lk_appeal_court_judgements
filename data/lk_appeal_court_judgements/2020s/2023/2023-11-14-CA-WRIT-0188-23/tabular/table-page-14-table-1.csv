"In Kishore Samrite v. State of UP., (2013) 2 SCC 398, the Indian Supreme Court clearly indicated"
"principles that govern the obligations of a litigant as follows,"
"""(i) Courts have, over the centuries, frowned upon litigants who, with intent to deceive"
"and mislead the Courts, initiated proceedings without faults disclosure of facts and"
"came  to  the  courts  with  'unclean hands'.  Courts  have held that  such  litigants  are"
"neither entitled to be heard on the merits of the case nor entitled to any relief"
"(ii) The obligation to approach the Court with clean hands is an absolute obligation and"
"has repeatedly been reiterated by this Court."
"The person seeking equity must do equity. It is not just the clean hands, but also clean mind,"
"clean heart and clean objective that are the equal fundamentals of judicious litigation. Wide"
"jurisdiction  of  the  court  should  not  become  a  source  of  abuse  of  the  process  of  law  by  the"
"disgruntled litigant. Careful exercise is also necessary to ensure that the litigation is genuine,"
"not  motivated  by  extraneous  considerations  and  imposes  an  obligation  upon  the  litigant  to"
"disclose the true facts and approach the court with clean hands. No litigant can play 'hide and"
"seek' with the courts or adopt 'pick and choose'. True facts ought to be disclosed as the Court"
"knows law, but not facts."""
