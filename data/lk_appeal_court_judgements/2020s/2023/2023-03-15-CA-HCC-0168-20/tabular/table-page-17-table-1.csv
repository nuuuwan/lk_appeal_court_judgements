"In this matter, the learned DSG conceded that the victim has spoken about only"
"one incident of intercrural sex committed by the appellant towards her, although"
"the 2nd and the 3rd count against the appellant has been formulated on the basis"
"of two such acts committed on two occasions. The learned DSG agreed that she"
"is in no position to defend the conviction of the appellant against the 3rd count"
"preferred against him."
"It is clear from the  evidence that the victim has spoken about one incident of"
"intercrural sex, although it appears that the grave sexual abuse towards her has"
"been a continuous process. However, since the victim has spoken about only one"
"incident of intercrural sex, I find no basis for the appellant to be convicted for"
"the 3rd count preferred against him. I find that the learned High Court Judge was"
"misdirected as to the evidence adduced at the trial when it was determined that"
"the witness has stated about two occasions where the appellant committed acts"
"of intercrural sex."
"Although it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the"
"learned High Court Judge has made use of the statement made by the victim to"
"police in that regard, I have no basis to agree. It is true that the witness has not"
"spoken  about  two  separate  occasions  of  intercrural  sex,  but  she  has  spoken"
"about  sexual  advances  made  by  the  appellant  towards  her  from  time  to  time."
"However, she has given firm and cogent evidence on one occasion where she was"
"subjected to intercrural sex. It appears that the learned High Court Judge has"
"misdirected in this regard. Since the prosecution is now conceding that the 3rd"
"count against the appellant has not been proved. I find that such a misdirection"
"has  not  caused  any  prejudice  to  the  appellant  or  has  occasioned  a  failure  of"
"justice."
"Article 138 of the Constitution is the general provision upon which the Court of"
"Appeal has been provided with the appellate jurisdiction."
"The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution reads as follows;"
