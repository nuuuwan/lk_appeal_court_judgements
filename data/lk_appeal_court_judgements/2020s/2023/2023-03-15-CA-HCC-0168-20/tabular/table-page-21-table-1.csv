"whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt or else,"
"whether the defence taken up by an accused person has created a reasonable"
"doubt  in  that  regard,  or  has  provided  a  reasonable  explanation  against  the"
"evidence placed before the Court by the prosecution."
"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  dock  statement"
"made by the appellant and the evidence of the two witnesses, including the son"
"of the appellant, in order to consider whether it has created a reasonable doubt"
"on the cogent and trustworthy evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove the"
"charges  against  the  appellant.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  drawn  his"
"attention  to  the  fact  that  although  the  appellant  has  made  certain  allegations"
"against his wife and PW-03 Tekla in his dock statement, he has failed to confront"
"the said witnesses when they gave evidence in Court under oath in that regard."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge was correct in his determination that"
"the allegations made by the appellant against the said two witnesses are clear"
"afterthoughts  which  have  not  created  a  doubt  in  their  testimony.  The  learned"
"High Court Judge has well considered the evidence of the son of the appellant to"
"conclude that his evidence cannot be relied upon, and the evidence of Ariyawathi"
"as well, by giving clear reasons as to why he is rejecting the evidence of those"
"witnesses."
"For  the  reasons  considered  as  above,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  above  considered"
"grounds of appeal as well."
"I find that the appeal is devoid of any merit in relation to the first and second"
"count  preferred  against  the  appellant.  Therefore,  I  affirm  the  conviction  in"
"relation to the said counts and dismiss the appeal of the appellant up to that"
"extent."
"However, for the reasons aforesaid, I allow the appeal in relation to the conviction"
"of the appellant for the 3rd count preferred against him, as it cannot be allowed"
"to stand. Therefore, I acquit the appellant on the 3rd count preferred against him."
