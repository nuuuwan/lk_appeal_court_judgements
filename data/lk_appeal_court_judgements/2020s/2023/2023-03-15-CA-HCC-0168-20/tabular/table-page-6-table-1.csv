"It had been suggested to her that she was uttering something that did not occur,"
"and because her father assaulted her due to the birthday card received by her"
"from a boy."
"It had been suggested further that after going to the mother and the attempts"
"made  by  them  to  obtain  the  school  leaving  certificate  did  not  materialize,  the"
"victim and her mother went to the police and made a false complaint against the"
"appellant and that is the reason why she could not remember some of the details"
"of the incidents which are against her."
"The mother of the victim (PW-02) in her evidence has narrated what led to her"
"leaving  the  husband  and  the  children  in  2009.  It  was  her  evidence  that  her"
"married life was a miserable one where she was subjected to frequent cruelty,"
"and she was forced to leave the house on the day where there was a function to"
"celebrate the attainment of puberty of the victim. It was her evidence that she"
"came to know later that her husband has taken the children from Ratnapura to"
"his home village and had admitted them to a school in Morapitiya. She has not"
"visited  them  in  Morapitiya  because  of  her  fear  for  the  life  at  the  hands  of  the"
"appellant."
"She has received an information from a fellow villager of the appellant somewhere"
"in the latter part of 2011 or early part of 2012 that her daughter was severely"
"beaten up by the appellant. It was her evidence that she made a complaint to"
"the police and Child Protection Authority but could not get the children back to"
"her and the police wanted her to go and live with the appellant."
"Subsequently,  in  early  2012,  she  has  received  a  phone  message  from  her"
"daughter stating that she cannot live with her father and to take her back. As a"
"result of that, she has gone with some known persons to the school where the"
"victim was studying and taken the victim under her care. She has been forced"
"to  live  with  a  relative  and  later  has  gone  to  work  in  a  garment  factory  while"
"looking after the victim."
