"For the reasons given as above, I find no reason to accept that this is a story"
"concocted at the instigation of the mother of the victim and her paramour, hence"
"no merit in the considered ground of appeal."
"I am in agreement with the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  cited  irrelevant  judgements  when  he  discussed  the"
"concept of reasonable doubt in his judgement."
"The cited judgement Ramaswamy Chetty Vs. Uduma Lebbe Marikkar 5 NLR"
"310  is  a  matter  that  has  been  decided  on  a  promissory  note  in  a  civil  action"
"where it has been decided that no reasonable doubt exist as to the bona fides of"
"the defence and it is the duty of the District Court to permit the defendant to"
"appear  and  defend  the  case  without  security.  The  cited  case  Moses  Vs.  The"
"State (1999) 3 SLR 401 is a case where a failure by a trial Judge to give reasons"
"in the judgement was considered."
"However, I am unable to agree with the contention that the learned High Court"
"Judge was misdirected as to the concept of reasonable doubt that needs to be"
"considered in a criminal case. It is clear that what the learned High Court Judge"
"has considered was that in a criminal case, beyond reasonable doubt does not"
"mean without any iota of doubt."
"For  matters  of  clarity,  I  would  now  reproduce  the  relevant  portion  of  the"
"judgement which appears at page 6 and 7 of the judgement (at page 354 and"
"355 of the appeal brief)."
