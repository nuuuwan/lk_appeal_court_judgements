"Having considered the fact that the appellant has been sentenced to a rigorous"
"imprisonment periods of 18 years each on each of the two counts to be effective"
"consecutively to each other, which amounts to 36 years in prison, I am of the"
"view that it is a sentence that is not warranted,  given the maximum sentence"
"that can be imposed to a person convicted for such an offence and also given the"
"fact that the offences have been committed during a same period of time."
"Hence, I order that the two sentences imposed on the 1st and the 2nd count shall"
"run concurrently to each other."
"The  fines  imposed  in  relation  to  the  1st  and  the  2nd  count  and  the  default"
"sentences as well as the compensation ordered and the default sentence shall"
"remain the same."
"Having considered the fact that the appellant has been in incarceration from his"
"date  of  conviction,  it  is  also  ordered  that  the  sentence  shall  deem  to  have"
"commenced from the date of his conviction namely, 21st July 2020."
