"defence, and also by remanding the appellant until the conclusion of"
"the evidence."
"It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned"
"trial  Judge  was  misdirected  as  to  the  burden  of  proof  and  the  concept  of"
"reasonable  doubt  in  a  criminal  case.  Referring  to  the  views  expressed  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge at page 07 of the judgement (page 355 of the appeal"
"brief),  it  was  his  view  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the"
"reasonable doubt concept in relation to civil actions and therefore has come to"
"wrong conclusions by determining that a mere doubt is not a reasonable doubt."
"It was the position of the learned Counsel that the learned High Court Judge has"
"referred to the facts that was not in evidence at page 18 and 19 (at page 366 and"
"367 of the appeal brief) of the judgment, but are in the statement made by the"
"victim  to  the  police  and  had  come  to  wrong  conclusions  which  vitiates  the"
"findings of the learned High Court Judge."
"Commenting on what the learned High Court Judge has stated at page 44 of the"
"judgement (page 392 of the appeal brief) where it has been stated that when the"
"appellant made his dock statement, although he has made several allegations"
"against  the  witnesses,  when  the  relevant  witnesses  were  giving  evidence,  the"
"appellant has failed to confront them with such. It was his position that such a"
"determination  amounts  to  shifting  of  the  burden  of  proof  to  the  appellant."
"Referring to what has been stated at page 57 (at page 405 of the appeal brief) it"
"was his view that the learned trial judge has shifted the burden of proof again"
"when it was stated that “එකී ලිංගික අතවර කිරීමේ ක්‍රිොව පිළිබඳ සාධාරණ සැකෙක් ඇතිමවන කිසිඳු"
"කරුණක් විත්තතිෙ මගින් අනාවරණෙ මනාකරයි.”"
"Pointing out several instances of the evidences of the victim, it was the position"
"of the learned Counsel that her evidence has several infirmities and omissions"
