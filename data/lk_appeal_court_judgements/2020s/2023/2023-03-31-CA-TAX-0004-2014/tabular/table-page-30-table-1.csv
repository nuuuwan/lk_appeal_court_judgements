"the  Legislature  is  to  encourage  people  to  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the"
"BOI,  invest  a  minimum  sum  of  Rs.  15  million  and  provides  vocational  or"
"practical training in the specified fields to be eligible for VAT exemption. The"
"Legislature has thus, regarded that any such institution that has entered into"
"an  agreement  with 
the  BOI,  made  such 
investment  and  provided  any"
"vocational  or  practical 
training  as  a  separate  category  of 
“Educational"
"Establishment” to be eligible for VAT exemption. The VAT Act does not include"
"the words “tertiary education” or “vocational education” in section 83 of the"
"VAT  Act  and  the  VAT  Act  only  refers  to  the  words  “vocational  or  practical"
"training”  in paragraph (d) of the definition “Educational Establishment”.  Had"
"the legislature intended to provide the exemption only to any institution that"
"has registered under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, it could have"
"easily referred to the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act in paragraph (d) of"
"the definition “Educational Establishment”."
"[70] The Legislature has not made any reference in the VAT Act to the Tertiary"
"and Vocational Education Act, and thus, the argument of the Respondent that"
"the absence of  such  specific reference is not necessary to be guided by the"
"requirement of registration under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act as"
"a condition for the VAT exemption has no merit."
"In pari materia principle-on the same matter and on the same subject"
"[71] I will now turn to the in pari materia principle relied on by Mr. Gunatilleke."
"The principle of in pari materia means in connection with the same matter on"
"the  same  subject  and  thus,  a  subsequent  legislation  can  be  looked    at  to"
"ascertain  proper  interpretation  to  be  put  upon  earlier  Act  when  there  is"
"obscurity or ambiguity (State of Bihar Versus S.K. Roy 1966 (4) TMI 72 S.C). The"
"principle of part material is explained in ""Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes"""
