"section,  shall  not  in  any  case  exceed  three  months  at  a  time  and"
"twenty four months in the aggregate."
"The  plain  reading  of  section  83  (1)  as  it  stands  now  clearly  establishes  that  a"
"person suspected or accused of an offence under section 54 A and section 54 B"
"of  the  Ordinance  shall  not  be  released  on  bail  by  the  High  Court  except  in"
"exceptional circumstances."
"However, the above provision is subject to the provisions of section 84, 85 and"
"subsection (2) of section 83."
"Therefore,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  granting  of  bail  by  a  High  Court  under"
"exceptional circumstances for a suspect or an accused in terms of this section"
"shall have to be read in conjunction with the above sections."
