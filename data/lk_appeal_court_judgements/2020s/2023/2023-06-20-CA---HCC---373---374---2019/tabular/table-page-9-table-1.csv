"such  evidence  to  be  consistent  with  such  an 
inference.  But  must  be  the  only"
"conclusion  possible.  Merely  because  the  specific  offence  with  which  the  unlawful"
"assembly is charged is not proved. It does not mean that the common object of the"
"unlawful assembly should be held to be non-existent. In order, to find the common"
"object of an unlawful assembly at the beginning, it is not a legitimate method merely"
"to take all the actual offence  committed  by it in the course of the riot and to infer"
"that  all  these  were  originally  party  of 
its  common  object.  The  conclusion  must"
"normally be based on more evidence than the mere acts themselves‚Äù."
"In the instant matter according to page 522 of the brief the finding and the sentencing"
"of the trial judge is not at all justifiable because nowhere in the evidence is it shown"
"that there were five accused who had shared a common object and out of the accused"
"found  guilty  even  along  with  the  deceased  accused  the  numerical  number  of  the"
"assembly  is  only  three  and  all  accused  have  been  acquitted  on  the  charge  based  on"
"common intention."
"Therefore,  we  find  the  conviction  and  sentencing  of  the  trial 
judge  to  be  highly"
"unreasonable and erroneous."
"At  this  stage  learned  Counsel  appearing  for  the  respondents  strenuously  urged  that"
"Court may consider the case under section 436 of Code of Criminal Procedure but we"
"are  unable  to  do  so  because  if  so,  the  learned  Attorney  General  should  have  taken"
"action to file papers at the time of conviction and not wait until the accused appellants"
"have done so."
"As such the instant appeals by the numbers 373 and 374 of 2019 are hereby allowed"
"and we set aside the convictions and the sentences of both the appellants entered by"
"the trial judge."
