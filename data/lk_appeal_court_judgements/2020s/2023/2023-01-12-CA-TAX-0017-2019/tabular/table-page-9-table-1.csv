"underserved areas15. According to the TRC's own disbursement guidelines,"
"construction of towers and base stations in specified areas is an investment"
"made by a Domestic PSTN Operator16. My point of view too is that it is an"
"investment made by the Appellant to enhance the services supplied to their"
"subscribers. The principal ground on which the TAC concluded that the"
"appellant  is  providing  a  service  to  the  TRC  is  that  the  towers  and  base"
"stations are built in specified areas in accordance with the guidelines issued"
"by the TRC17. The TAC further observed that the amount paid by the TRC"
"to  the  Appellant  is  not  a  voluntary  payment  made  to  each  and  every"
"Domestic PSTN Operator and the payment would be received only upon"
"fulfilment of the requirements of the TRC. Thus, the TAC determined that"
"there is a contractual obligation to be fulfilled by the Appellant to receive"
"the disbursement18. It is common knowledge that even a dwelling house is"
"built according to the specifications of the local authority. Simply because"
"one  cannot  say  that  there  is  a  contractual  obligation  towards  the  local"
"authority."

"PSTN Operator builds towers and base stations in these areas, the Domestic"
"PSTN Operator is entitled to claim two-thirds of the  TDC lying  in their"
"name, in the TDC fund. It is true that the TRC determines the unserved and"
"underserved areas and specify the parameters of towers and base stations."
"Yet, those are not built on the request of the TRC. The Domestic PSTN"
"Operators builds those on their own accord, in order to enhance the service"
"provided  to  their  customers.  Therefore,  this  can  never  be  a  criterion  to"
"determine that the Appellant supplies a service to the TRC."
"Moreover, towers and base stations are built in specified areas as well as"
"in other areas. But a disbursement from the TDC fund will be made only in"
"respect of towers and base stations built in specified areas."
"The Respondent, referring to the Note to the Financial Statements of the"
"Appellant in the working file, which is not available in the brief, submitted"
"that  the  money  received  is  referred  to  in  it  as  a  government  grant.  The"
"Respondent argued that in a grant there is no possibility for the grantor to"
