"The Respondent submitted that since the asset of the towers remains in the",""
"hands of the Appellant, a lesser amount, two-third of money lying to the",""
"credit of the Appellant, was agreed as the consideration for the construction",""
"of towers and base stations8. I see no merit in the foregoing and it is also",""
"inconsistent  with  the  principles  of  VAT  recovery.  The  Respondent  also",""
"argued that passing of the ownership of the towers is not a requirement in",""
"a context where there is a supply of services9. The Respondent's position",""
"in  this  matter  is  that the  Appellant's predecessor  supplied  the tower  and",""
"base station construction service to the TRC. In such a case, it is obvious",""
"that the ownership should pass to the TRC at the end of construction.",""
"The Respondent relied on the judgement of the European Court of Justice",""
"in","the  case  of  Vodafone  Potugal-  Communicacoes  Pessoais  SA  v."
"Authoridade  Tributaria e Aduaneira10  and  argued  that  the payment of a",""
"predetermine amount such as in the instant case constitute a consideration",""
"for a supply of services under the VAT Act. It was further submitted that",""
"the 
term","‘supply  of 
services’  has  been  construed  widely 
in  other"
"jurisdictions.  The  facts  of  the  aforementioned  case  are  that  Vodafone",""
"offered its customers special promotions, provided that customers continue",""
"to  obtain Vodafone's  services  for  a predetermined period.  Failure of the",""
"customers","to  comply  with 
the  above  condition  obliged 
them 
to  pay"
"Vodafone the predetermined amount. The Court held that the payment of",""
"a  predetermined  amount  constitutes  the  consideration  for  the  services",""
"provided by Vodafone to its customers.",""
"However,  it  is  clear  that  the  facts  in  the  above  case  are  significantly",""
"different","from 
the 
case 
at 
hand. 
Vodafone, 
which 
was 
a"
"telecommunications","service  provider,  was  contracted 
to  provide 
its"
"services  to  customers  whereas  in  this  case,  none  of  these  services  were",""
"provided to the TRC. I am therefore of the view that the judgement of the",""
"abovementioned case has no application to the facts of the instant case.",""
"In light of the above analysis, it is clear that the amount reimbursed by the",""
"TRC does not represent the value of a taxable supply of services under the",""
"VAT Act.",""
"A further aspect which must be examined by the Court is that the basic",""
"principle  of  VAT","is 
that 
the 
tax 
is 
levied  on 
the 
final  consumer."
