"international call facilitated by an operator4. Regulations setting out the rate"
"of the levy are made under Section 22 of the Finance Act. Section 23 and"
"26  provides  for  the  issuance  of  guidelines  for  the  implementation  and"
"giving effect to the provisions of the Act."
"The tax on international inbound calls is levied on the basis of two separate"
"fees, 
namely, 
Incoming 
Local 
Access 
Charge 
(ILAC) 
and"
"Telecommunications  Developing  Charge 
(TDC)  and  credited 
to 
the"
"respective fund. The operator may claim two-third of the funds in the TDC"
"fund  lying  in  the  name  of  such  operator,  for  the  development  of  their"
"telecommunication  network  in  unserved  and  underserved  areas  of  Sri"

"Accordingly,  Suntel 
(Private)  Limited  was  granted 
a 
sum  of  Rs."
"67,220,330/-  on  the  11th  of  May  2010  for  their  investment  in  specified"
"areas."
"As  I  have  already  stated  above  the  Assessor  issued  the  assessment  in"
"question in respect of this amount."
"Analysis"
"The  Assessor  was  of  the  view  that  the  said  sum  of  Rs.  67,  220,  330/-"
"received  by  the  Appellant  from  the  TRC  is  a  government  grant  for  the"
"investments made in the North and East which in terms of Section 2 of the"
"VAT Act is received in the course of carrying on or carrying out a taxable"
"activity. The Assessor was of the view that any supply which is not a supply"
"of goods is a supply of services within the meaning of the VAT Act6. In"
"my view, this can by no means be sustained."
"In contrast to the foregoing, the CGIR confirmed the assessment relying on"
"one of the objectives outlined on the TRC website, ‘to promote rapid and"
"sustained development of domestic and international telecommunication"
"facilities.’ It was stated that construction of towers is one way of promoting"
"development of domestic and international telecommunication facilities7."
"Accordingly, the receipt from the TRC was treated as consideration for a"
"supply made to the TRC by the Appellant."
