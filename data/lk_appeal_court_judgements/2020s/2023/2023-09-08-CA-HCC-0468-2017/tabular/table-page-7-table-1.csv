"CA-HCC 0468/2017"
"In  the  parcel  recovered  from  the  Appellant  weighed  about  80  grams  of"
"substance."
"However,  when  the  productions  were  taken  to  the  Government  Analyst"
"Department, a notable difference had been noted in the parcel. According to"
"the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as P27 in the High"
"Court  Trial,  the  weight  of  parcel  mentioned  as  85.43  grams.  This  is  5.43"
"grams in excess to the original weight. Hence the Appellant argues that the"
"weight difference creates a serious doubt in the prosecution case."
