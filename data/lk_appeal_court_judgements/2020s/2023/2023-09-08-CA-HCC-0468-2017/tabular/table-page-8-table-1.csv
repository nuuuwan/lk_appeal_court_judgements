"When 
this  Court 
invited 
the  Respondent 
to  explain  regarding  weight"
"discrepancy  transpired 
from  the  evidence,  the  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor"
"General  following  the  best  traditions  and  highest  standard  admitted  the"
"weight discrepancy in the production and further added that he is unable to"
"explain the reason."
"In  this  regard,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  had  made"
"general  comments  about  weight  discrepancies  in  cases  of  this  nature.  In"
"absence  of  the  evidence  led  regarding  this  particular  point;  the  comment"
"made by the Learned High Court has no doubt caused great prejudice to a"
"fair trial. The relevant portion is re-produced below:"
