"house from the kitchen door and went to the front as the witness and the family followed"
"him.  She  could  identify  the  persons  at  the  gate  from  the  street  light,  as  they  were"
"neighbors.  At  the  gate,  there  was  an  exchange  of  words  between  the  deceased  and  the"

"This piece of evidence had established in this case that 3rd and 4th Accused were"
"indeed  neighbors,  therefore  there  arises  a  motive  for  the  said  Accused  to  attack  the"
"deceased.  PW1  in  her  evidence  claims  there  was  a  three-wheeler  stopped  at  the  gate,"
"which she recognized to have belonged to the 5th Accused, who she claims was sitting in"
"the  driver's  seat.    The  deceased,  then  got  into  a  three-wheeler  on  his  own  and  they"
"proceeded  from  the  house.  In the  meantime,  the  third  and  the  fourth  Accused  persons"
"took steel rods from a nearby land belonging to them and followed the three-wheeler."
"Seeing this, she and the rest of the family of the deceased has also run after the"
"two Accused. The three-wheeler stopped about 25 yards from the house, and the deceased"
"got off from the three-wheeler. According to PW1, by this time all six Accused were there."
"When the deceased got off, the 1st Accused chased him off to the middle of the road and"
"hit his leg with a rod. The deceased fell down, at which point the fourth Accused hit the"
"deceased with a steel rod three times, yelling; (On page 133 of Brief) ""උඹ  ොපේ පන්ද""."
"PW1 claims that the fourth Accused hit the deceased on the head, followed by the"
"first Accused."
