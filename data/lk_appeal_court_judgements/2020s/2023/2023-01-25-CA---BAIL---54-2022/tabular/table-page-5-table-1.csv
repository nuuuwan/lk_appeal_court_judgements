"suspect is the fact that the suspect had not threatened the victim nor a"
"witness of the substantive matter."
"But although the suspect is of school going age the conduct of the suspect"
"appears to be far more superior to a school boy."
"Hence  upon  consideration  of  the  submissions  of  both  parties  it  is  the"
"opinion  of  this  Court  that  the  instant  application  for  bail  should  be"
"allowed  and  the  suspect  in  the  instant  matter  should  be  enlarged  on"
"suitable conditions of bail."
"Therefore, we direct the learned Magistrate to enlarge the suspects on"
"suitable conditions of bail."
"As such the instant application for bail allowed."
