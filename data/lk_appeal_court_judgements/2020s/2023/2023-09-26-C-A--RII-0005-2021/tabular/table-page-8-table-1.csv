"The above case further affirms the seminal duty of a trial judge to evaluate and examine"
"the  documents  and  evidence  presented  before  a  court,  prior  to  arriving  at  a  just"
"determination.  This 
is  paramount  because, 
in 
the  absence  of 
such 
thorough"
"examination,  unjust  deprivation  of  property  rights  to  individuals  occurs.  The  unjust"
"deprivation of property rights to an individual is unacceptable as every human being"
"has a natural right to property, therefore, the law must ensure the protection of such"
"rights rather than hindering the enjoyment of such rights. Furthermore, in a partition"
"matter, if the court erroneously deprives an individual of a property, it would cause a"
"flagrant violation of their rights, as it is possible, that the deprived property may be the"
"individual’s sole property."
"In English courts it was held in many cases that a judge should not rely solely on the"
"pleadings or statements in the plaintiff's complaint. Instead, the judge should consider"
"the  evidence  and  documents  introduced  during  the  trial  to  arrive  at  a  fair  and  just"
"decision. (Ross v. Caunters  [1979] 3 WLR 131) and in Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932]"
"AC 562:This landmark case established the importance of considering the evidence and"
"facts presented during the trial. In this case, the House of Lords emphasized the need"
"for reasoned judgments that explain the basis for a judge's decision. It highlighted that"
"a judge should rely on the evidence and not be swayed solely by the plaintiff's allegations"
"Moreover, the lax consideration of evidence or negligence of a trial judge is taxing upon"
"the parties due to the unnecessary consumption of time and waste of money.  Therefore,"
"the  aggrieved  litigants  face  the  consequences  of  the  errors  made  by  the  court.  It  is"
"further  noteworthy 
that, 
in  such  an 
instance, 
the  aggrieved 
litigants  are  not"
"compensated 
for 
the  unnecessary  consumption  of 
time  and  money.  Thus, 
it 
is"
"imperative  that  a  trial  judge  examines  and  evaluates  the  evidence  and  documents"
"diligently, in order to ensure the due administration of justice."
"In the case of Mather v. Tamotharam Pillai (1908) 6 NLR 246, the Full Bench of the"
"Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Layard decided more than 110 years ago that"
"“A partition suit is not a mere proceeding inter partes to be settled of consent, or by the"
"opinion of the Court upon such points as they choose to submit to it in the shape of issues."
"It is a matter in which the Court must satisfy itself that the plaintiff has made out his title,"
"and  unless  he  makes  out  his  title  his  suit  for  partition  must  be  dismissed.  In  partition"
"proceedings the paramount duty is cast by the Ordinance upon the District Judge himself"
