"In 
light  of 
the  above  analysis,  I  am 
inclined 
to  accept 
the  Appellant’s"
"contention that his failure to declare the deposit in his assets and liabilities list"
"was  due  to  inadvertence  and  the  USD  1.7  million  remitted  to  the  Hatton"
"National  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  from  Deutsche  Bank  of  Singapore  by 
the"
"Appellant was not income earned within the year of assessment 2003/2004,"
"except the interest income for which the Appellant has paid income tax."
"Accordingly, I answer the second question of law in the negative and the third,"
"fourth, 5 (a), and 5 (b) questions of law in the affirmative, in favour of the"
"Appellant."
"Whether  one  and  the  same  Assessor  should  reject  the  return,  make  the"
"assessment and issue the Notice of Assessment."
"Another argument put forth by the Appellant is that the same Assessor who"
"rejected the return was required to proceed with the assessment and issue the"
"Notice of Assessment21."
"The Appellant's argument above is based on the fact that the Assessor who"
"signed  the  intimation  letter  is  not  the  Assessor  who  signed  the  Notice  of"
"Assessment. The Appellant's argument was founded on the words, ‘(…) where"
"an Assessor (…) does not accept a return (…) and makes an assessment (…),"
"he shall communicate (…) his reasons for not accepting the return’, in the"
"proviso  of  Section  134  (3)  of 
the  IR  Act.  Consequently,  the  Appellant"
"submitted  that  in  the  case  at  hand  the  assessment  has  been  rejected  by  the"
"Assessor Mr. Prabath Pushpakumara and the Notice of Assessment has been"
"issued by Senior Assessor Mr. E. Bandara. However, Section 134 (3) does not"
"stipulate that the Notice of Assessment should be issued by the same Assessor"
"who made the assessment. All that is set out in the proviso of Section 134 (3)"
"is  that  the  Assessor  who  makes  the  assessment  should  communicate.  the"
"reasons for not accepting the return to the taxpayer, in writing."
"T
he requirement  for issuing a Notice of Assessment is specified in Section"
"135 of the IR Act. Section 135 also does not require the Assessor who made"
"the assessment and communicated the reasons for not accepting the return to"
"issue the Notice of Assessment."
