"the Appellant, would create an absurdity in situations such as the retirement"
"or death of an Assessor, after making an assessment and before the Notice of"
"Assessment is signed and dispatched. Although tax laws must be interpreted"
"strictly, I do not believe that such strict interpretations are justified when there"
"is no advantage or disadvantage for either party."
"Accordingly, it is my considered view that there is no statutory requirement"
"under the IR Act for the Assessor who made the assessment and rejected the"
"return to issue the Notice of Assessment."
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  I  answer  the  eighth  question  of  law  in  the"
"negative, in favour of the Respondent."
"Whether the assessment is time barred?"
"The  Appellant  submitted  his  return  of  income  for  the  year  of  assessment"
"2003/2004 on the 5th October 2004. A return must be submitted on or before"
"30th November of the year of assessment immediately succeeding that year of"
"assessment. Section 134 (5) (a) of the IR Act requires that an assessment must"
"be  made  not  later than  three  years  after  the  end of  the year  of  assessment."
"Accordingly, the three-year time period for making an assessment ends on the"
"31st  March  2007. The  foregoing  facts  are  not  in  dispute25. The  date  of  the"
"Notice of Assessment is 16th March 200726. The Appellant stated that although"
"the Notice of Assessment is dated 16th march 2007, it is evident from the letter"
"dated 12th July 2007 written to the Appellant by Mr. R. M. Jayasinghe, Deputy"
"Commissioner, that the Notice of Assessment posted was not delivered to the"
"Appellant as  of  12th July 200727. According to the Appellant, the Notice of"
"Assessment was received by him only on the 12th July 2007. Consequently,"
"the Appellant submitted that the assessment exceeded the three-year statutory"
"time limit."
"It appears that the Appellant has made the above submission on the basis that"
"an assessment is made in terms of Chapter XVIII of the IR Act only upon"
"service of the Notice of Assessment on the assessee."
