"The Appellant also relied on the judgement in the case of D. M. S. Fernando"
"v Mohideen Ismail22  in support of this argument."
"Although the Appellant has not specifically stated as such, it appears to me"
"that  the  Appellant  has  relied  on  the  following  observations  made  by  His"
"Lordship Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon in the aforementioned case which"
