"the  Appellant  for  the  disputed  remittance  during  the  year  of  assessment"
"2003/2004. However, I observe that the letter dated 19th January 2007 issued"
"by  the  Inland  Revenue  Department  does  not  absolve  the  Appellant  of  his"
"income tax liability up to the year of assessment 2005/2006. In the said letter,"
"while acknowledging the amount paid as interest, the CGIR has advised the"
"Appellant to settle his income tax liability with the Assessor up to the year of"
"assessment  2005/2006.  Therefore,  I  am  unable  to  agree  with  the  above"
"submission  of  the Appellant. Yet,  the  fact  remains  that  this  amounts  to  an"
"acknowledgement  by  the  CGIR  to  the  effect  that  the  Appellant  held  the"
"questionable amount in his account at Deutsche Bank, Singapore, and earned"
"interest prior to the year of assessment 2003/2004. Moreover, it is important"
"to  note  that  in  the  aforementioned  letter,  the  Commissioner  (Investigation"
"Branch) did not reject the claim of the Appellant that the monies in his account"
"in  Singapore  were  not 
income  earned  within 
the  year  of  assessment"
"2003/2004."
"The TAC observed that the onus is on the Appellant to prove by documentary"
"evidence that the income in question was earned abroad.    and paid income"
"tax abroad on the income, by submitting a certificate from the tax authority"
"concerned19. However, in my view, it is not incumbent upon the appellant to"
"prove  that  he  paid  tax  abroad.  All  the  Appellant  has  to  prove  is  that  the"
"remittance  in  question  is  not  income  earned  within  the  year  of  assessment"
"2003/2004  and 
the  Appellant  has  discharged 
the  aforesaid  burden  by"
"submitting a letter from Deutsche Bank20 of Singapore which confirms that"
"the funds were held in his bank account even prior to 1st April 2002. The TAC,"
"although  referred  to  the  above  letter  in  its  determination,  did  not  give  due"
"credit to the said letter."
"The TAC citing Section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance observed that since"
"the Appellant has made the Respondent believe that by an oversight, money"
"lying to the credit of the Appellant was not intimated to the Respondent, the"
"principle of estoppel has no application in the instant case. However, since the"
"Appellant has not denied his previous stand subsequently, I am of the view"
"that Section 115 has no application at this instance."
