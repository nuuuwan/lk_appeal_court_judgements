"Assessor,  although  on  an  erroneous  basis,  disclosed  the  facts  on  which  he"
"based his assessment and the reasons why he rejected the return. Therefore,"
"in my view the TAC did not err in law or misdirect itself by holding that the"
"reasons for rejecting the return had been communicated to the Appellant."
"Accordingly,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  aforementioned  submission  of  the"
"learned Counsel for the Appellant that the onus is on the Assessor to prove the"
"validity of the assessment is on the Assessor has no merit."
"In  view  of  the  above  analysis,  I  answer  the  ninth  questions  of  law  in  the"
"negative, in favour of the Respondent."
"I will next consider whether the Appellant, the taxpayer, has discharged the"
"onus of proving the assessment is erroneous."
"Whether the remittance of USD 1.7 million to the Hatton National Bank of"
"Sri  Lanka  from  the Appellant’s  account  at  Deutsche  Bank  of  Singapore"
"subject to income tax?"
"The following analysis is in respect of the second, third, fourth, 5 (a) and 5 (b)"
"questions of law."
"The Appellant’s contention is that USD 1.7  million remitted to his account"
"was already capital in the hands of the Appellant  in the year of assessment"
"2003/2004.  In support of the  above contention the Appellant submitted the"
"letter of the Managing Director of the Deutsche Bank, Singapore, dated 13th"
"February 2007 which reads thus13; ‘We hereby confirm based on your written"
"instruction,  we  had  remitted  USD  1.7  million  to  Hatton  National  Bank,"
"Homagama Branch, Sri Lanka on the 30th September 2003 out of the funds"
"held in your bank account maintained at Deutsche Bank A. G. Singapore prior"
"to 1st April 2002.’"
"It was also submitted that there is no evidence whatsoever for concluding that"
"the foreign currency at issue was earned abroad during the year of assessment"
"2003/2004. Accordingly, it was submitted that the CGIR’s finding that Rs. 164"
"million was an income earned by the Appellant during the period 1/4/2003 to"
"31/3/2004 is unfounded."
