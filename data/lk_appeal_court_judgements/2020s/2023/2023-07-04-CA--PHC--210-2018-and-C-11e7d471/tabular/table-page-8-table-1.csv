"Furthermore,  the  learned  high  Court  Judge  has  taken  into  consideration  that  the  lease"
"agreement dated 26.10.2015 entered by the Appellants had been executed after the date on"
"which the dispute has arisen on 16.10.2015."
"It  is  clear  that  since  the  dispute  relates  to  premises  bearing  no  16,  Seethawaka  Road,"
"Avissawella,  the  matter  in  issue  falls  within  the  ambit  of  section  68  of  the  Primary  Court"
"Procedure Act."

"statements made by the  1st Respondent on 02.11.2015 and 17.11.2015, the incident took"
"place on or about 09.10.2015, and the 1st Appellant was in the possession of the disputed"
"premises against the approval of the 1st and 2nd Respondents."

"dispossession of the 1st Appellant by the 1st and 2nd Respondent from the disputed premises."

"regarding the said incident until the 1st Appellant made the complaint to the Police regarding"
"the unlawful dispossession."
"According to the complaint dated 16.10.2015 by the 1st Appellant,"
