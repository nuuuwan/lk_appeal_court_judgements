"In the case of Sinha Cement (Pvt) Ltd Vs Director Central Investigation Bureau"
"Sri Lanka CA Writ Application No: 128/2017, Justice C. P. Kirtisinghe held"
"as follows;"
"“In  any event,  the  availability of an  alternative remedy does not prevent  this"
"court from issuing a Writ in a case of excess or absence of jurisdiction. In the"
"case  of  Kanagarathna  Vs  Rajasundaram  (1981)  1  SLR  492  Samarakoon  CJ."
"held that  the availability of an alternative remedy does not prevent the court"
"from issuing a Writ of Prohibition in cases of excess or absence of jurisdiction."
"In  the  case  of  Sirisena  Vs  Kotawara  Udagama  Corporative  Society  Ltd.  51"
"NLR 262 Gratien J. held that there is “no doubt a well-recognized principle of"
"law that the Supreme Court will not as a rule make an order of Mandamus or"
"Certiorari  where 
there 
is  an  alternative  and  equally  convenient 
remedy"
"available to the aggrieved party. But the rule is not a rigid one.” In that case,"
"it was held that even though an alternative remedy was also available, a Writ"
"of Certiorari would lie to quash the proceedings of a tribunal which flagrantly"
"exceeded the limited statutory powers conferred on it.”"
"When  considering  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  decide  that  the  availability  of"
"alternative remedies does not prevent the petitioners from seeking redress in"
"these Writ applications."
"For the reasons enumerated in this judgment, we decide the forfeiture of the"
"subject consignment of sugar under section 119 of the Customs Ordinance"
"is  without 
jurisdiction  and  null  and  void. 
  Therefore,  the  petitioner 
is"
"entitled  to  the  relief  as  prayed  for  in  paragraph  (b)  and  (d)  of  the  prayer  to"
"the petition."
