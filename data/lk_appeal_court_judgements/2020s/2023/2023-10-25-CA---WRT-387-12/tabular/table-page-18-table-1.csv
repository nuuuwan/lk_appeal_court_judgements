"cannot avoid the liability.  In this case, the matter to be decided is whether"
"the  forfeiture  of  the  goods  by  the  customs  is  correct  in  law.    Whether  the"
"bank  is  liable  to  pay  the  seller  is  not  an  issue  in  this  application,  and"
"therefore, court forms no opinion in that regard."
"On  behalf  of  the3rd  respondent,  it  was  quoted  certain  parts  of  the  evidence"
"given  by  K.  Gnanasekaran  and  tried  to  impute  that  the  manager  of  the"
"Seylan  Bank  branch  at  Grandpass,  and  Wee  Tiong  knew  about  the  fraud"
"committed  by  K.  Gnanasekaran.    Gnanasekaran  himself  is  the  fraudster."
"There  was  no  charge  against  the  6th  respondent  or  the  petitioner.    The"
"Seylan  Bank  was  not  even  allowed  to  cross-examine  any  of  the  witnesses."
"Counsel 
for  the  petitioner  was  also  not  allowed  to  complete  his  cross-"
"examination of the witness, K. Gnanasekaran."
"The  2nd  respondent  decided  as 
follows; 
“At 
this  stage, 
I  come 
to 
the"
"conclusion  that  sufficient  questions  have  been  asked  from  the  suspect  K."
"Gnanasekeran  and  now  I  call  upon  the  prosecution  to  read  out  the  three"
"statements  of 
the  other  suspect,  R.M.E.R.B.  Rathnayake 
recorded  on"
"6/10/2012, 
11/10/2012 
and 
16/10/2012.”The 
counsel 
for 
the 
3rd"
"respondent  in  this  application  submitted  that  the  2nd  respondent  had  to"
"make 
the  above  decision  because, 
the  counsel 
for 
the  petitioner  had"
"repeatedly asked the same question at the custom inquiry. However, the 2nd"
"respondent did not mention that he stopped the cross-examination because"
"the question was repeatedly asked by the counsel. But he only observed that"
"sufficient  questions  had  been  asked.  Counsel  for  the  respondents  did  not"
"provide  any  examples  of  the  repeated  questions  to  this  court.  There  is  no"
"legitimate  reason  for  the  2ndrespondent  to  curtail  the  cross-examination  of"
"the defence counsel. This amounts to a breach of rules of natural justice."
"When  considering  the 
facts  of  the  case,  the  evidence  of  Gnanasekaran"
"cannot  be  used  to  impute  any  allegation  against  the  petitioner  or  the  6th"
"respondent bank. The 3rdrespondent's above argument cannot be sustained."
"The  3rd  respondent  submitted  in  the  written  submission  that  the  original"
"BLs had been endorsed in the name of the 5th respondent when the BL was"
"handed over to the shipper, and the title of the goods was already passed to"
"the 5th respondent. This argument was not pleaded in the objections and not"
"taken up at the argument. If the BL was endorsed in the name of the buyer,"
"the question arises as to why the buyer stole the documents from the Seylan"
"Bank. Even if the BL was endorsed, the petitioner’s intention was to hand it"
"over to the buyer through the 6th respondent Bank when the buyer had paid"
"the selling price to the Bank."
"Availability of an alternative remedy"
"It  has  been  submitted  by  the  State  that  the  Petitioner  should  be  sued"
"against the buyer and the collecting Bank, and it has failed to do so."
