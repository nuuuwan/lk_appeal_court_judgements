"For  the  reasons  stated  as  above,  I  hold  that  the  sentence  imposed  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge on the accused was illegal and cannot be allowed to"
"stand. I hold that there was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to hold"
"that since the second and the third accused had been sufficiently punished for"
"two of the counts, he is not going to sentence them for the other two counts for"
"which they were found guilty."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  should  have  considered  the  fact"
"that  he  is  sentencing  the  accused  after  a  full  trial.  I  find  no  basis  for  the"
"learned High Court judge to decide that  no punishment would be imposed on"
"the  other  counts  for  which  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  accused  were  found  guilty,"
"because they were punished sufficiently for one count."
"Accordingly, I set aside the sentence imposed on the accused,  as it cannot be"
"allowed to stand, and sentence them as follows."
