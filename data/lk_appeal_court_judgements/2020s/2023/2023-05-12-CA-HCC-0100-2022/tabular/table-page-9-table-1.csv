"In  this  case  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  not  only  considered  the"
"evidence of PW1 and PW3, but also considered other corroborating evidence"

"Considering  the  appeal  grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant  in  this  case,  I"
"conclude those are totally devoid of merit."
"Hence,  I  am  of  the  view  that  there  are  no  reasons  to  interfere  with  the"
"judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Balapitiya.  For  the  reasons"
"stated  above,  I  affirm  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  imposed  on  the"
"Appellant."
"Therefore, the Appeal is dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High"
"Court of Balapitiya along with the original case record."
