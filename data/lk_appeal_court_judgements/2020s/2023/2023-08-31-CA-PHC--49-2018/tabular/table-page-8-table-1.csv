"“Sohoni in his treatise on the Indian Criminal Procedure, 1973, Vol.2, 18th Edition at page"
"1331 describes that the proviso to Section 145 of the Indian Criminal Procedure which could"
"boast  of  parentage  over  its  Sri  Lankan  counterpart  in  Section  66  of  the  Primary  Courts"
"Procedure  Act  No.44  of  1979  is  founded  on  the  principle  that  forcible  and  wrongful"
"dispossession is not to be recognized under the Criminal Law. The word ""dispossessed"" means"
"to be out of possession, removed from the premises, ousted, ejected or excluded. Even where"
"a person has a right to possession, he cannot do so by taking the law into his hand. That will"
"make it a forcible entry otherwise that in due course of law. It would be a case of both forcible"
"and wrongful dispossession.”"
"Therefore, it is the considered view of the court that the 1st party Respondent was forcibly"
"dispossessed from the disputed premises by the Appellant on 22.12.2017. As such, in terms"
"of Section 68(3) of the Act, the 1st party Respondent had been forcibly dispossessed within a"
"period  of  two  months  immediately  before  the  date  on  which  the  information  was  filed"
"(05.01.2018 ) under Section 66 of the Act. Hence, the 1st party Respondent is entitled to the"
"possession  of  the  disputed  premises  and  the  1st  party  Respondent  is  entitled  to  restore  the"
"possession of the premises in dispute. Since this is the position that was held by the learned"
"Magistrate and the learned Provincial High Court Judge, we see no reason to interfere with"
"the Order dated 21.03.2018 by the learned Provincial High Court Judge as well as the Order"
"dated 16.03.2018 by the learned Magistrate. Thus, this appeal is dismissed with costs."
