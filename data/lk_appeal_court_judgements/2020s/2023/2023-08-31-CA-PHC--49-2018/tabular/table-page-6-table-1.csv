"possession of the premises in question to the 2nd party Respondent and vacated the premises"
"without informing the lessor, the 1st party Respondent."
"It appears that the 1st party Respondent was totally unaware of the conduct of the Lessee, and"
"the she was unaware of the testamentary Action instituted by the 2nd party Respondent. Since"
"the 1st party Respondent was not a party to the purported Testamentary Action instituted in"
"the District Court of Mt. Lavinia, she had commenced agitating to regain possession of the"
"leased property."
"In these circumstances, it is apparent that there was a likelihood of a breach of peace being"
"threatened,  therefore, the  Police  has filed an information under Section 66 of the  Primary"
"Court Procedure Act No 44 of 1979."
"The learned Magistrate who was acting as a Primary Court Judge inquired about the dispute"
"by  way  of  Affidavits,  Counter  Affidavits  and  other  documents.  Consequently,  the  learned"
"Magistrate  had  delivered  the  Order  on  16.03.2018  and  held  in  favour  of  the  1st  party"
"Respondent and held that the 1st party Respondent is entitled to the possession of the disputed"
"premises in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order,  the  2nd  party  Respondent-Petitioner  had  invoked  the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Kalutara and it is seen that the learned"
"High Court Judge too held against the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner and decided that the"
"2nd party Respondent-Petitioner has no right to possess the premises in suit and since there is"
"no merit in the said revision application to revise the order of the learned Magistrate. Hence,"
"the application of the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner was dismissed."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  dismissal  of  the  revision  application  the  2nd  party  Petitioner-"
"Petitioner (Appellant) [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] has preferred this"
"appeal seeking to set aside the order made by the learned High Court Judge as well as the"
"Magistrate."
"It  is  worthy  to  note  the  findings  of  the  learned  Magistrate  that  although  the  2nd  party"
"Respondent  was  issued  a  probate,  it  does  not  prove  that  the  2nd  party  Respondent  was  in"
"possession  of  the  disputed  premises  for  the  relevant  period  of  time  material  to  the  instant"
"action. On the other hand, probate is issued in a Testamentary action to administer the estate"
"of the deceased person. As such, obtaining a probate is not a fact to prove possession of the"
"disputed premises in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Code Procedure Act."
