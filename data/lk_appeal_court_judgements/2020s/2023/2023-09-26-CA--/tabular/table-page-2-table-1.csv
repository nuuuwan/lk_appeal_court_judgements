"Menaka Wijesundera, J."
"T
he instant matter has been filed to set aside the Judgment dated 26/11/2018 of High Court of"
"Ratnapura."
"The  Accused-Appellant  has  been 
indicted  for  two  charges  of  grave  sexual  abuse. 
  At  the"
"conclusion  of  the  trial,  the  learned  trial  Judge  had  convicted  the  Accused-Appellant  for  both"
"charges  and  has  passed  a  sentence  of  12  years  rigorous 
imprisonment  with  a 
fine  and"
"compensation 
for  each  charge. 
  The 
terms  of 
imprisonment  has  been  ordered 
to 
run"
"concurrently."
"When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned President’s Counsel for the Accused-"
"Appellant stated that he is only contesting the sentence and not the conviction.  He brought to"
"the notice of Court that the incident had taken place in January 2006 which is nearly 17 years"
"ago.  He further said that the Accused-Appellant is repenting his actions."
"The  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  also  made  submissions. 
  He  objected  for  sentence  being"
"varied."
"Considering the submissions of both parties, we observe that the date of offence had been in"
"2006  and  trial  had  been  concluded  in  2018  therefore  17  years  have  lapsed  since  the  date  of"
"offence up to date and from the date of offence it had taken nearly 12 years to conclude the"
"trial hence during this passage of time many changes in the life of any human being takes place"
"which is also common to the appellant and the victim."
"In  the  case  of  C.  A.  Revision  No.  CA[PHC]APN/141/2013  decided  on  25/03/2015,  Justice"
"Chithrasiri had said as follows."
"“Sentencing is an important aspect in the administration of criminal Justice system. The"
"sentence  ranges  from  death  penalty  to  the  mere  censure  in  the  former  of  good  behavior  or"
"probation.    There  are  multiple  considerations  relevant  to  the  determination  of  sentence.  The"
"most important consideration is the seriousness of the crime.”"
"In the instant case we observe that the victim had been around 10 years of age at the time of"
"the offence.  But, considering the date of offence which had been in the year of 2006 and the"
"trial had concluded in the year 2018."
