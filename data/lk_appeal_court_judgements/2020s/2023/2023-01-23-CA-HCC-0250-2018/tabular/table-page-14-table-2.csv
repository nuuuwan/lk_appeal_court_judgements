"For matters of clarity, I think it is appropriate to reproduce the fourth limb of"
"section 294 which reads thus;"
"294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is"
"murder-"
"Fourthly-  IF  the  person  committing  the  act  knows  that  it  is  so"
"imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or"
"such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act"
"without  any  excuse  for  incurring  the  risk  of  causing  death  or  such"
"injury as aforesaid."
