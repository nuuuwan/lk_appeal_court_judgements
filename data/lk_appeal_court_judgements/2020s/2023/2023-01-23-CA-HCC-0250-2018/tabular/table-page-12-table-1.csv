"Accordingly,  I  hold  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  misdirected  as  to"
"the 1st count preferred against the respondent when it was determined that the"
"said count was defective, in acquitting the respondent of count one."

"sections 104 and 296 of the Penal Code."

"Penal Code reads as follows;"
