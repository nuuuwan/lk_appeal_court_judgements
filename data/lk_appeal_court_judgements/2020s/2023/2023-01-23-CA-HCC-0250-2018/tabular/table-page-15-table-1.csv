"Although this was a matter not argued during the appeal, I am of the view that"
"the 2nd counts should be a count that needs to be considered as an alternative"
"count  to  the  1st  count  preferred  against  the  respondent  for  the  purposes  of"
"sentencing, as both the counts refer to the one and the same incident. I am of"
"the  view  that  the  1st  count  was  a  count  based  on  the  conspiracy  and  the"
"abatement, while the 2nd was a count based only on the abatement."
"Hence, I set aside the sentence imposed upon the respondent on the 2nd count"
"and sentence her as below."
"On count one, I sentence her to five years rigorous imprisonment and to a fine"
"of  Rs.  25000/-.  In  default  of  paying  the  fine,  she  shall  serve  a  period  of  six-"
"month simple imprisonment."
"On  count  two,  I  make  no  sentencing  order  on  the  basis  that  this  needs  to  be"
"considered  as  an  alternative  count  to  the  1st  count  preferred  against  her,  for"
"which she was sentenced."
"On count three, the respondent is sentenced to death."
"On count four, the respondent is sentenced to death."
"On count five, the respondent is sentenced to death."
"On count six, the respondent is sentenced to death."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Colombo  is  directed  to  follow  the  necessary"
"procedural steps as required by law, before the pronouncement of the sentence"
"of death on the respondent."
