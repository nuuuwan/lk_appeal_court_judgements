"the accused in a language which he understands."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  a  careful  reading  of  the  section  and  the  illustration"
"provided,  would  amply  demonstrate  that  the  1st  count  preferred  against  the"
"respondent  was  in  conformity  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act."
"The  offence  of  conspiracy  and  abatement  has  been  clearly  mentioned  and"
"described so that the respondent could understand the basis upon which she"
"has been charged, since the intended purpose of the actions of the respondent,"
"which was the murder of Minister Devananda was not achieved. I find that the"
"prosecution  has  correctly  charged  the  respondent  in  terms  of  section  108,"
"mentioning it as the punishable section."
"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well  described  the  purpose  of"
"section  108  of  the  Penal  Code  in  paragraph  71.1  of  his  judgment.  However,  I"
"am in no position to agree with the learned High Court Judgeâ€™s determination"
"that  a  conspiracy  cannot  take  place  to  not  to  do  something  punishable  with"
"death,  and  therefore,  the  1st  count  preferred  against  the  respondent  was"
"defective."
"The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well  considered  the  evidence  and  has"
"correctly  determined 
that 
there  was 
a 
conspiracy 
to  murder  minister"
"Devananda and the respondent was part of the that and she aided and abated"
"in  order 
to  achieve 
that  purpose.  After  determining  so, 
there  cannot  be"
"justification  in  stating  that  section  108  does  not  cover  a  situation  where  a"
"conspiracy 
to  not 
to  do  something.  Section  108 
is  a  section  based  on"
"abatement and not on conspiracy."
