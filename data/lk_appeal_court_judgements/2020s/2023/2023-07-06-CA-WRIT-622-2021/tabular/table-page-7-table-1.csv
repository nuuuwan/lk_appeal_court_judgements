"subdivision. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the reason given by the 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents, on the basis of the purported public protest, to vary or suspend their original"
"decision is not reasonable and further, this is a fit case to employ the doctrine of ultra vires"
"against the impugned decisions."
"In light of the above findings, I take the view that the decisions of the 2nd Respondent which"
"are reflected in the letters dated 04.12.2019 (‘P16’) and 05.12.2019 (annexure to the said ‘P16’)"
"are unreasonable and irrational. Thus, I proceed to grant only a writ of certiorari as prayed"
"for in paragraph (c) of the Prayer of the Petition of the Petitioners. Anyhow, I am not inclined"
"to  issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  as  prayed  for  in  the  Prayer  of  the  Petition  as  the  Pradeshiya"
"Sabha is duty bound to fulfil any lawful request made by the Petitioners. No relief has been"
"sought against the 3rd to 6th Respondents by the Petitioners."
"Application partly allowed."
