"accordingly, the said subject land can be considered a private land. The Land Commissioner"
"General by his letter dated 12.12.2019 ('P17') has communicated the same information to the"
"Pradeshiya  Sabha.  The  Pradeshiya  Sabha  approved  eight  plans  by  which  the  subdivisions"
"have been authorized. The plan numbers and dates of such approval are described in the letter"
"marked  'P16'  (and  the  annexure  to  'P16').  The  Petitioners  have  annexed  several  receipts"
"marked 'P25' in proof of payment of assessment tax in respect of the subject land."
"The contention of the 1st and 2nd Respondents is that the suspension of permission to subdivide"
"the  subject  land  is  well  within  the  powers  of  the  Local  Authority.  Referring  to  the  letter"
"marked 'P22' the said 1st and 2nd Respondents submit that an environmental resort was to be"
"constructed on the subject land as a result of a unanimous decision taken by the Pradeshiya"
"Sabha, based on a proposal submitted to the Pradeshiya Sabha to reacquire the subject land."
"By  letter  dated  20.12.2020  ('1R3')  Land  Commissioner  General  has  informed  the  District"
"Secretary,  Galle,  that  there  is  a  possibility  of  acquiring  the  subject  land,  if  the  Pradeshiya"
"Sabha  deems  it  necessary.    However,  it  is  apparent  that  no  steps  have  been  taken  by  the"
"Ministry of Lands to acquire the subject land and it is obvious that such acquisition should be"
"carried out under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act."
"The purported unanimous decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha has been taken on the 17.12.2019"
"and no evidence has been submitted to Court in view of implementing the said decision during"
"the  last  three  and  a  half  years.  It  appears  that  any  final  determination  of  this  Application"
"would not be an impediment to the Respondents to proceed with acquisition, if necessary,"
"following the correct procedure under the law."
"Section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance No. 21 of 1901 stipulates the manner in which any"
"proclamation,  order,  or  notification  issued  by  an  authority  upon  whom  such  power  is"
"conferred  to  do  so,  may  be  amended,  varied  or  rescinded.  Although  a  public  authority  is"
"empowered to change his or her original decision under the provisions of the said Section 18,"
"legitimate  reasons  should  be  given  prominence.  I  take  the  view  that  mere  approval  by  the"
"Pradeshiya Sabha for a development activity is not sufficient and it is not reasonable to vary,"
"rescind or suspend a valid decision of a public authority, when such resolution or the approval"
"is not adequately and appropriately implemented within a reasonable period of time for the"
"benefit of the public. Thus, the circumstances of this case do not warrant this Court to accept"
