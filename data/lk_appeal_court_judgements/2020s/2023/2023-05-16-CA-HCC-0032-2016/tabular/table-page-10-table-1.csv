"In this case, evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defence did"
"not  reveal  any  mitigatory  circumstances  that  had  existed  at  the  time  of"
"committing the offence. Hence, this ground of appeal also devoid any merit."
"Considering  the  evidence  led  in  this  case  and  guided  by  the  judgements"
"mentioned above, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which"
"the judgement delivered by the learned  High Court Judge on  29/02/2016"
"against  the  Appellant  can  be  interfered  upon.  Therefore,  the  appeal  is"
"dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High"
"Court of Chilaw along with the original case record."
