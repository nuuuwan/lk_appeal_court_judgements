"could  be  said  the  1st  respondent  who  claims  to  be  an  authoritative  of  the"
"Plantation  Management  Monitoring  Division  – Ministry  of  Plantation  can  be"
"considered as a competent authority, thereby the Quit Notice is valid as per"
"the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act."
"The counsel for the respondent in his submissions contends that the question"
"whether the land in dispute is within the control of Land Reform Commission"
"or Plantation Management Company is a matter of fact. The counsel reiterates"
"that in this instant case the land in concern is vested with the JEDB, and the"
"JEDB gave the said land on lease to Watawala Plantation. As per  1R1 lease"
"agreement  it  is  admitted  that  the  land  is  under  the  control  of  Plantation"

"are  all  documents  corresponding  to  the  Land  Reform  Commission.  The"

"the  Land  Reform  Commission  to  obtain  a  conveyance  in  2014.  And  thus,"
"emphasizes on his legitimate expectations to be in possession of the said land."
"Accordingly,  it  could  be  said  that  the  petitioners’  legitimate  expectations"
"should be vested with the Land Reform Commission and not against the 1st"
"respondents. However, the counsel for the respondent during his submissions"
"emphasized on the fact that the petitioner relies on the documents of the Land"
"Reform Commission but has not made the Land Reform Commission a party"
"to the case."
"The case of Dominic v Minister of Lands and others (2010) 2 SLR page 398"
