also 
to 
Kumburegedara 
Lokubanda 
and"
"Kumburegedara Rambanda. As I have already stated above, the permit holder"
"Kumburegedara Gunrathnabanda’s heirs are his wife Meragalge Anulawathie,"
"his son Kumburegedara Ajith Kumarasinghe, the 5th Respondent, and his two"
"daughters  Kumburegedara  Nirosha  Damayanthi 
and  Kumburegedara"
"Sandeepa  Jayamenike.  Late  Gunarthnabanda’s  wife  and 
two  daughters"
"consented to the alienation of the land in the name of  5th Respondent Ajith"
"Kumarasinghe.  However, 
the  Divisional  Secretary  alienated 
the 
land 
to"
"Lokubanda  and  Rambanda  as  well, 
in 
the  extents  stated  above 
in 
this"
"judgment. Ajith Kumarasinghe did not resist alienating the land to Lokubanda"
"and Rambanda.  The Petitioner himself admits that the 5th Respondent’s father"
"late  Gunarathnabanada  and  Ukkurala’s 
two  elder  sons  Lokubanda  and"
"Rambanda  occupied 
the 
land  after 
the  demise  of  Ukkurala15.  The  5th"
"Respondent also admitted that the two male children of Lokubanda reside on"
"the land belonging to Lokubanda16."
"Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  Divisional  Secretary,  considering  the  long-"
"continued  possession  of  Lokubanda  and  Ram  Banda,  with 
the 
implied"
"acquiescence  of  the  heirs  of  the  late  Gunarathnabanda  has  alienated  the"
"aforementioned two portions of land to Lokubanda and Ram Banda."
"Hence, I am of the view that the decision of the Divisional Secretary reflected"
"in ‘P 9(i)’ and ‘P 9(ii)’ are rational and reasonable."
"It appears that late Rambanda who got two portions of the subject matter on"
"‘P 9(i)’ and ‘P 9(ii)’ and Sandeepa Jayamenike, the youngest daughter of the"
"late Gunarathnabanda, along with the Petitioner, has subsequently requested"
"from the Commissioner General of lands to divest the land to the Petitioner17."
"However, as I have already analysed in this judgment, there is no legal basis"
"for such an alienation."
"Ukkurala died in the year 1978 (‘P 2’). As I have already stated above in this"
"judgement  Ukkurala’s  nominated  successor  was  Gunarathnabanda.  The"
"Petitioner  made  this  application  on  the  basis  that  there  was  no  nomination"
"made by Ukkurala. Interestingly, the Petitioner marked time until the death of"
"his two elder brothers and once became the surviving eldest son decided to"
