"the year of making plans ‘P 1(a)’ and ‘P 1(b)’ as the date on which the permit"
"was issued. Be that as it may, according to the ledger maintained in respect of"
"the aforementioned two allotments of land, the date on which the two lands"
"were allotted is 20th October 19509."
"More 
importantly,  although 
the  Petitioner  submitted 
that  Ukkurala  died"
"without making a nomination, the above ledger clearly states that Ukkurala"
"nominated  his  son  Gunarathnabanda  as  his  successor  on  the  23rd  October"
"1958."
"As I stated before in this judgment, Ukkurala died on the 26th November 1978"
"(‘P 2’ and/or ‘5 R 3’). According to Section 84 (b) of the Land Development"
"Ordinance  Gunarathnabanda  being  the  nominated  successor  is  entitled  to"
"succeed to the land by obtaining a permit from the Government Agent under"
"the Provisions of Land Development Ordinance. However, no permit obtained"
"by  Gunarathnabanda 
in 
terms  of  Section  85  of 
the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance  was  brought  to  light  in  this  application.  Ordinarily,  in  terms  of"
"Section 84, if the nominated successor fails to succeed to the land upon the"
"death  of 
the  permit  holder, 
the 
land  should  be  deemed 
to  have  been"
"surrendered to the state. However, in the instant case, Gunarathnabanda was"
"issued with two Grants in terms of Section 19 (6), read along with Section 19"
"(4)  of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance  for  the  two  allotments  of  land,"
"subsequently10. The documents ‘5 R14’ and ‘5 R 15’ are the extracts of the"
"register in which these two Grants are registered. The two allotments of land"
"are depicted in plans ‘P 1(a)’ and ‘P1(b)’."
"T
he aforementioned two Grants had been issued on the 3rd May 1983, after"
"the death of Gunarathnabanda on the 18th March 1983. Therefore, as admitted"
"by all the parties, these two Grants are invalid. Be that as it may, a grant under"
"Section 19 (4) would be issued to a permit holder in respect of the land of"
"which he is in occupation. Accordingly, it is obvious that  Gunarathnabanda"
"would  have  been  the  permit  holder  who  was  in  occupation  of  the  subject"
"matter. Above all, the letter of the Divisional Secretary of Medirigiriya marked"
"‘P 10’ confirms that according to the ledger, Gunarathnabanda succeeded to"
"the land on the 31st October 1979."
