"and repute prior to his birth12. The Petitioner denied the above contention of"
"the 5th Respondent13."
"According to ‘P 8’, the 5th Respondent Ajith Kumarasinghe’s birth certificate"
"was amended under Section 27A of the Births and Deaths Registration Act"
"No.  40  of  1975,  as  amended,  by  inserting  the  particulars  of  his  father,"
"Kumburegedara Gunarathnabanda. The amendments had been made on the 7th"
"June  1983.  Gunarathnabanda  died  on  the  18th  March  1983.  The  learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner argued that since the amendment has taken place"
"after the death of Gunarthnabanda it is invalid. However, alterations in a Birth"
"Certificate can be made to bring it in conformity with the legitimate status of"
"a person, where by virtue of operation of the provisions of section 3 of the"
"Legitimacy Act, No. 3 of 1970, that person is rendered legitimate14. According"
"to  Section 3  of  the  Legitimacy Act  No.  3 of  1970,  a valid  marriage  would"
"render legitimate any child procreated by the parties prior to such marriage."
"Accordingly, it appears that the Registrar General has acted according to law."
"On  the  other  hand,  the  Petitioner  has  submitted  the  letter  ‘P  13’  from  the"
"Central Record Room of the Registrar General’s Department stating that the"
"amendment is not reflected in the copy available to them.  May be that the"
"amendment  made  by  the  Additional  District  Secretary  upon  the  powers"
"delegated by the Registrar General in terms of Section 27 (a) of the Act is not"
"reflected in the copy available with the Registrar General."
"Be that as it may, the legitimacy of the 5th Respondent, a matter where the"
"facts are in dispute is not a matter to be determined in this writ application."
"Above all, Section 114 (d) of the Evidence Ordinance provides that Court may"
"presume that official acts have been regularly performed."
"In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the decision of the Divisional"
"Secretary of Medirigiriya alienating the rights of the land of Gunarathnabanda"
"to the 5th Respondent on the basis that he is a child of Gunarathnabanda is not"
"ultra vires."
"The Divisional Secretary proceeded to issue the two documents ‘P 9(i)’ and"
"‘P  9(ii)’,  alienating  the  rights under  the  Grant,  not only  to  Kumburegedara"
