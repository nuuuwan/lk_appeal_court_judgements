"According 
to 
the 
document  marked 
‘P 
12(i)’, 
the 
aforementioned"
"Kumburegedara Lokubanda and Kumburegedara  Rambanda are children of"
"the  late  Ukkurala. According  to  the  Petitioner,  the  Petitioner  is  the  eldest"
"surviving son of Ukkurala. As I have already stated above in this judgment,"
"the succession of the land alienated to  the  late  Gunarathnabanda  should be"
"according 
to 
the  order  of  priority 
in 
the  Third  Schedule  of 
the  Land"
"Development Ordinance. The 1st preference is for the sons and the 2nd is for"
"the  daughters.  The  brothers  come  below,  the  7th  preference  in  the  line."
"However, in this instance, the Divisional Secretary has alienated the land to"
"the 5th Respondent who is the male child of the late Gunarathnabanda, and to"
"the two brothers of Gunarathnabanda, over the two daughters. In my view, the"
"two  daughters  of 
the 
late  Gunarathnabanda,  Nirosha  Damayanthi,  and"
"Sandeepa 
Jayamenike 
should 
get 
preference 
over 
the 
brothers 
of"
"Gunarathnabanda. Assuming that the brothers are entitled, the Petitioner being"
"the 
eldest 
surviving 
son 
should  get  preference  over  Lokubanda 
and"
"Rambanda. However, since the late Gunarathnabanda died leaving his widow"
"and three children, the brothers are not entitled to succeed unless the former"
"fails to succeed."
"As I  mentioned earlier, the late  Gunarathnabandas’s wife Anulawathie, and"
"the  two  daughters,  Nirosha  Damayanthi  and  Sandeepa  Jayamenike  have"
"renounced their right to succeed by their letters addressed to the Divisional"
"Secretary, marked ‘5 R 11’."
"Next, I will consider the facts presented to this Court on the entitlement of 5th"
"Respondent Ajith Kumarasingha to succeed to the land. Gunarathnabanda got"
"married to Anulawathie (‘P 4’) on the 12th July 1982 and the 5th Respondent"
"was born on the 8th June 1977 (‘P 8’). On the face of the two documents, it"
"appears  that  the  5th  Respondent  Ajith  Kumarasinghe  is  born  before  the"
"marriage between  Gunarathnabanda  and Anulawathie. The Petitioner  stated"
"that 
the  5th  Respondent  Kumburegedara  Ajith  Kumarasinghe 
is  not  a"
"legitimate  child  of  the  late  Gunarathnabanda  and  alleged  that  he  tampered"
"with his birth certificate interpolating Gunarathnabanda’s name as his father."
"In reply, the 5th Respondent Ajith Kumarashinghe stated that he was born in"
"an 
intimacy  between  Gunarathnabanda  and  Anulawathie  prior 
to 
their"
"marriage. Further stated that his parents cohabited and were married by habit"
