"circumstances which shock the conscience of Court to have the revisionary jurisdiction of the"
"Provincial High Court invoked."
"In view of the aforesaid reasons, I hold that learned Primary Court Judge has properly exercised"
"jurisdiction under section 69 of the Primary Courtsâ€™ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. As such, the"
"learned Magistrate  is empowered  to make  an  order declaring that  the  2nd  Party-Respondent-"
"Respondent-Respondent is entitled to use 10 feet wide roadway pertaining to the instant action."
"Therefore, the learned High Court Judge was right in refusing to intervene with the order dated"
"20.06.2017 of the learned Magistrate/ Primary Court Judge."
"As it was revealed that a civil case is pending in the District Court of Gampaha over demarcation"
"of boundaries, parties are entitled to get a permanent solution to the impugned dispute from the"
"relevant civil court."
"Thus, I refuse to interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge. Therefore, the appeal"
"stands dismissed."
"Appeal dismissed with costs."
