"The appellant had called the jewelry shop owner to give evidence and he had"
"said that the police officers who conducted the raid never came to his shop"
"to weigh the productions which has cut across the story of the prosecution,"
"but the learned trial judge had not considered the impact of the evidence of"
"the jewelry shop owner he had merely referred to the evidence of the defense"
"witnesses and had said that they had not been able to give any acceptable"
"evidence but he had not given any reasons for the same."
"According to the evidence of the prosecution the witnesses had gone to the"
"shop and had spoken to the owner of the shop and had said in evidence that"
"the owner was known to them. Therefore, although the learned Counsel for"
"the appellant said that he was not contesting the chain of productions of the"
"prosecution the evidence of the jewelry shop owner in fact places the chain"
"of productions also in doubt because his evidence casts a doubt whether the"
"prosecution  witnesses  really  went  to  the  shop  to  weigh  the  productions"
"which  is  in  fact  the  beginning  of  the  chain  of  productions.  Therefore,  the"
"learned trial judge by not considering these aspects deprives the appellant of"
"his  right  for  a  fair  trial  which  is  enshrined  in  the  Constitution.  Cross  on"
"Evidence 5th edition page 29 has said that “a judge has the overriding duty in"
"every case to secure a fair trial “. But in the instant case the failure of the trial"
"judge to consider the case for the defense and state very clearly whether he"
"accepts it or rejects  it and his failure to consider the improbabilities in the"
"version of the prosecution with regard to the timeline involved in the case"
"and the discrepancies in the story of the prosecution between its witnesses is"
"a clear denial of the right of the appellant for a fair trial."
