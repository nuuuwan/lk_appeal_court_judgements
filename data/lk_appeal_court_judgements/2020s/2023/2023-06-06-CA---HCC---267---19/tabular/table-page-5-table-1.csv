"corroboration is invariable made to be highly improbable and unlikely in"
"the light of the above mentioned discrepancies which the trial judge had"
"failed to consider."
"The second ground of appeal raised by the appellant is the time frame led"
"by the prosecution being highly improbable."
"According  to  the  main  witness  in  the  prosecution  the  appellant  had"
"arrived at the scene at 2.45 to Hikkaduwa and the party had arrived at the"
"jewelry shop at 5.30 in the evening which had been at Kaluwella and they"
"had  reached  police  station  only  by  10.30  in  the  evening  after  the  raid"
"which had been only 1 kilo meter away from the jewelry shop."
"Therefore, the Counsel for the appellant averred that it is highly unlikely"
"that the police officers took such a length of time to travel the distance"
"indicated in evidence."
"Upon perusal of the brief and the evidence this Court also has to agree"
"that if  the distance between the jewelry shop  and the Galle  police  was"
"only one meter away and how was it that the officers took time from 5.30"
"to  10  30  to  travel  that  distance  of  one  kilo  meter  even  if  the  weighing"
"process took a long time."
"It is a well understood principle of criminal law that the party making the"
"allegation must prove the same beyond a reasonable doubt, but if there"
"arises  a  doubt  with  regard  to  the  prosecution  story  the  benefit  of  the"
"doubt must be given  to the accused. But in the instant matter  the  trial"
"judge had failed to analyze the improbability of the situation."
