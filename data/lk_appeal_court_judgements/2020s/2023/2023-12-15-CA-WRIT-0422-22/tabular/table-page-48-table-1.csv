"at any person in particular, the routine application of the policy to persons in the same category"
"can give rise to an 'expectation' of similar treatment."
"Legitimate Expectation means that a person may have a reasonable expectation of being treated"
"in a certain way by administrative authorities owing to some consistent practice in the past or an"
"express promise made by the concerned authority. According to this doctrine, a public authority"
"can be made accountable in lieu of a legitimate expectation. Thus, the doctrine of Legitimate"
"Expectation pertains to the relationship between an individual and a public authority."
"Legitimate expectation is not a legal right. It is an expectation of a benefit, relief or remedy that"
"may ordinarily flow from a promise or established practice. The term 'established practice' refers"
"to  a  regular,  consistent  predictable  and  certain  conduct,  process,  or  activity  of  the  decision-"
"making authority. The expectation should be legitimate, that is, reasonable, logical, and valid."
"Any expectation which is based on sporadic or casual or random acts, or which is unreasonable,"
"illogical, or invalid cannot be a legitimate expectation. Not being a right, it is not enforceable as"
"such.  It  is  a  concept  fashioned  by  courts,  for  judicial  review  of  administrative  action.  It  is"
"procedural in character based on the requirement of a higher degree of fairness in administrative"
"action, as a consequence of the promise made, or practice established. In short, a person can be"
"said to have a 'legitimate expectation' of a particular treatment, if any representation or promise"
"is made by an authority, either expressly or impliedly, or if the regular and consistent past practice"
"of the authority gives room for such expectation in the normal course."
"Therefore, it can be said that this doctrine is a form of a check on the administrative authority."
"When  a  representation  has  been  made,  the  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectation  imposes,  in"
"essence, a duty on public authority to act fairly by taking into consideration all relevant factors"
"relating to such legitimate expectation. It also adds a duty on the public authority not to act in a"
"way to defeat the legitimate expectation without having some reason of public policy to justify it"
"doing so."
"Applying the same principle in Aruna Roy vs. Union of India (2002) 7 SCC 368 it was held that it"
"is for Parliament to take a decision on a national education policy one way or the other, court"
"cannot take a decision on the good or bad points of an educational policy. Court can intervene in"
"the implementation of policy only if it is against any statute."
"Wade  and  Forsyth  Administrative  Law  10th  Edition  deals  with  the  power  of  issuing  Writs  of"
"Certiorari and Prohibition when the lower Tribunal has acted in excess of Jurisdiction is as follows;"
"On pages 214 and 215, it says;"
"“where there is a breach of natural justice”"
"On pages 372 to 379, it says;"
"“where there is a lack of fair hearing”"
"On pages 405 to 408 it says;"
"“if the decision is bias.”"
"Article 140 of the Constitution prescribes the Law under which this Court can issue Writs in the"
"nature of Certiorari and Prohibition."
