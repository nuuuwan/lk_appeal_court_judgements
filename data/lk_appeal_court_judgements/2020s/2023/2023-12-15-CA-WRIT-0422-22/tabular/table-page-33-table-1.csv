"The  Public  Services  United  Nurses  Union  v  Montague 
Jayewickrema,  Minister  of  Public"
"Administration and others 1988, 1 S.L.R. 229 where it was held that;"
"""1)  Although  the  origin of  government  service is  contractual, once  the  appointment  is"
"made,  the legal position  of  a  government  servant  is  one of  status  and  his  powers  and"
"duties are exclusively determined by law and not by agreement. Under Article 55 of the"
"Constitution,  the  government  can  make  unilateral  alterations  that  may  affect  the"
"contractual  relationship  of  a  public  officer  with  the  Government,  yet  there  must  be"
"observance of form and procedure."
"(2)  The  Establishment  Code  has  been  issued  by  Government  in  the  exercise  of  the"
"legislative power vested in the Cabinet of Ministers under Article 55 (4) and has statutory"
"force. Though ad hoc determinations may be made by the Cabinet in a few matters it is"
"essential  that  provisions  relating  to  salary  increments,  leave,  gratuity,  pension,  super"
"annuity,  promotion  and  every  termination  of  employment  and  removal  from  service"
"should be in the form of rules which are general in operation though they may be applied"
"to a particular class of public officers. Further when existing general rules are sought to"
"be  altered  this  too  must  be  done 
in  the  same  manner  and  following  the 
identical"
"procedure for their formulation, namely, by enacting an amending rule. """
"A classification to pass muster must be based both on intelligible differentia and such differentia"
"must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved."
"In the case of Aruna Roy vs. Union of India (2002) 7 SCC 368 it was held that it is for Parliament"
"to  take  a  decision  on  a  national  education  policy  one  way  or  the  other  and  that  Court  can"
"intervene in the implementation of policy if it is against any statute."
"In  such  circumstances,  the  aforesaid  policy  decision  is  a  blatant  violation  of  the  statutorily"
"provisions as morefully set out in these submissions and the petition and that the said policy"
"decisions were evidently not taken to the benefit of any patients. If the impugned decisions are"
"not  quashed,  the  crisis  would  be  worsened,  and  the  citizen  would  be  denied  timely-needed"
"treatment,  and  the  state  health  system  would  be  collapsed.  Therefore,  it  is  my  view  that  the"
"impugned decision is ex facie arbitrary, illegal, ultra vires, unreasonable and irrational."
"In view of the above facts, it was argued that the arbitrary change of government policy further"
"violates the right to equal treatment of the petitioners as per Article 12 (1) of the Constitution."
"This Court's attention is drawn to the case of Dayaratne vs.  Minister of Health and Indigenous"
"Medicine 1999 (1) SLR 393 where Amarasinghe J. held that; ""when a change of policy is likely to"
"frustrate the legitimate expectations of individuals, they must be given an opportunity of stating"
"why the change of policy should not affect them unfavourably. Such procedural rights have an"
"important  hearing  on  the  protection  afforded  by  Article  12  of  the  Constitution  against  equal"
"treatment  arbitrarily, 
invidiously, 
irrationally,  or  otherwise  unreasonably  dealt  out  by  the"
"Executive. An expectation is considered to be legitimate where it is founded upon a promise or"
"practice by the authority that is said to be bound to fulfil the expectation. """
