"fill the vacancies of the Petitioners to this application. If the Petitioners intend to maintain this"
"application, it is paramount to cite the PSC a party to the application."
"I do not agree with the said argument as the petitioners never sought any relief against the PSC."
"The  Public  Service  Commission  and 
its  members  are  not  necessary  parties.  Accordingly,"
"necessary  parties  are  before  this  Court,  which 
is  not  fatal  to  the  maintainability  of  this"
"application."
"Article  55(1)  of the  Constitution  stipulates  that the  Cabinet  of  Ministers shall  provide for  and"
"determine  all  matters  of  policy 
relating 
to  public  officers, 
including  policy 
relating 
to"
"appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal. In terms of Article 55(3)"
"and  Article  55(5),  the  appointment,  promotion,  transfer,  disciplinary  control,  and  dismissal  of"
"public officers shall be vested in the Public Service Commission (PSC) subject to the provisions of"
"the  Constitution.  Learned  ASG  argued  that  the  PSC  shall  be  responsible  and  answerable  to"
"Parliament  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Standing  Orders  of  Parliament  for  the"
"exercise and discharge of its powers and functions."
"The  petitioners  state  that  ""in  the  said  circumstances  the  policy  decision  of  the  Cabinet  of"
"Ministers to reduce the compulsory retirement age to 60 (regarding doctors services) followed"
"by document marked P9 is.........."". Hence they admit that what is sought to be quashed is a policy"
"decision."
"This  is  a  policy  decision outlined by His  Excellency the President  of the Democratic  Socialistic"
"Republic of Sri Lanka in the Interim Budget Speech marked as A 2 annexed to the Statement of"
"Objections. Accordingly, it was proposed to reduce the retirement age of public sector and semi-"
"governmental employees to 60 years. Those who have been employed beyond 60 years of age at"

"293/2007 decided on 28th November 2012, Justice Gooneratne quoted the De Smith's 'Judicial"
"Review' (6th edition), it was held, inter alia, (at pages 423 to 426):"
"""It is clear that the reasons given must be intelligible and must adequately meet the substance"
"of  the  arguments advanced.  It  will  not  suffice  to  merely recite a  general  formula  or restate  a"
"statutorily  prescribed  conclusion.  It 
is  also  preferable 
if  reasons  demonstrate  a  systematic"
"analysis has been undertaken by the decision maker""."
"The petitioners were granted a special privilege owing to the sui generis nature of the technical"
"skills and expertise possessed by the Petitioners. Thus, the arbitrary decrease of the compulsory"
"age  of  retirement  which  had  been  entrenched  for  a  period  of  time  violates  the  legitimate"
"expectations of the Petitioners."
"The strongest argument raised by the petitioners were the Doctrine of legitimate expectation. It"
"is basically aimed at admirative authorities abusing their discretion contrary to the expectation"
"of  individuals.  It  ensures  legal  certainty  as  people  ought  to  have  planned  their  life  secure  in"
"knowledge of the consequences of their action. Perception of legal certainty deserves protection."
"Public perception of legal certainty becomes negative when the authorities on their own have"
"given assurances which give rise to their expectations and later arbitrarily infringe the same."
