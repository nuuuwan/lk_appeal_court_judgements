"counsel for Elmer submits, correctly in my view, that we should adopt”."
"[Emphasis added in this judgment]"
"Therefore, in Ashville Investments vs. Elmer Contractors, it was a question of"
"considering both the, mistake leading to notification and misrepresentation or"
"misstatement leading to damages, as matters “in connection with” the contract."
"The term in question, in this case, “to set up/conduct and operate its business"
"to manufacture solid rubber wheels with plastic steel rims…”, is different."
"Setting up is something taking place at the beginning. Conducting and operating"
"follows it. Those two concepts too are different. But the concept in question in"
"this  case 
is  selling  capital  assets.  That  does  not 
fall  under  “setting  up”,"
"“conducting” or “operating”. Selling the machinery is the opposite of “setting up”."
"It is the ceasing of “conducting” and “operating”."
"Hence  Ashville 
Investments  vs.  Elmer  Contractors  does  not  help 
the"
"appellant."
