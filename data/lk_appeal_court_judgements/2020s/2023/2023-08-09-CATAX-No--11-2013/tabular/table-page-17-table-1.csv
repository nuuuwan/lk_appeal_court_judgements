"As  stated 
in  paragraph  22  of 
the  appellant’s  Written  Submissions  dated"
"27.09.2019 it is stated at page 12 of the determination of the TAC,"
"“Therefore, in the present case, the profits made by selling property, plant"
"and machinery is to be recognized as an income under section 25(3)(b) and"
"not under section 25(3)(a) as determined by the respondent…”"
"But the position of the appellant, as adverted to in paragraph 23, et seq., of the"
"said Written Submission is that neither section applies, as there was no evidence"
"of granting an allowance for depreciation."
"The appellant reiterates, that, in order to apply section 25(3)(b), as determined"
"by the TAC the granting of a depreciation allowance is a precondition."
"This argument is refuted in the further Written Submissions of the respondent"
"dated 15.03.2022. It is stated,"
"“The appellant is distorting this section [section 25(3)] by suggesting that"
"the 
liability 
[to]  pay 
income  tax 
is  conditional  upon  the  grant  of  a"
"depreciation allowance. This is NOT what the section says….The Assessor"
"does not grant a depreciation allowance on his own accord. A depreciation"
"allowance must be claimed by the taxpayer.  There is no material before"
"Your Lordships’ Court to show that such an allowance was ever claimed."
"Indeed,  if  the  appellant’s  argument  was  correct  (which  it  isn’t)  then  an"
"absurdity will result: you can evade liability with respect to the proceeds"
"from  the  sale  of  capital  assets  by  simply  not  claiming  a  depreciation"
"allowance”."
"The Inland Revenue Ordinance of Hong Kong [Chapter 112] in its first section,"
"under Part 06 on “Depreciation, etc.” provides,"
"“(1) Where any person is, at the end of the basis period for any year of"
"assessment, entitled to an interest in a building or structure which is a"
"commercial building or structure and where that interest is the relevant"
"interest in relation to the capital expenditure incurred on the construction"
