"Upon perusal of the brief at page 67 we find that he says that it was either the"
"2nd or the 3rd appellant who had told him that they killed the deceased but he"
"had not been able to say which one of them. The Counsel for the respondents"
"also conceded to this fact, but he said that he is not relying on this confession"
"because a confession made by one accused cannot be used against the other to"
"which this Court also agrees to."
"But at page 67 we observe that he had said that all three appellants had told"
"him that not to divulge any information with regard to hearing the cries of a girl"
"from  the  abandoned  house  near  the  check  point.  He  also  had  been  cross"
"examined to the effect that there were prostitutes who had come to the very same"
"house but he does not say that on that day he saw a prostitute coming in to the"
"house."
"Other witnesses had been led to show that the appellants had been on duty on"
"the fateful day."
"Hence the learned Counsel for the respondents added that it is very clear that it"
"was only the appellants who had been present on that day in the house with a"
"female whose identity was not known."
"The mother of the deceased whose evidence in the trial under section 33 of the"
"Evidence  Ordinance  had  been  marked  in  the  trial,  had  said  that  on  the  30th"
"September the victim had left home on the bicycle to see the aunt and as she did"
"not return in the evening, she had gone to the Kondeveli check point to inquire"
"about her on the 1st October."
"In the meantime, she had heard from Pushpakaran that he had seen the victim"
"at the check point on the 30th around 3pm. She further says that even her sister"
"had confirmed that she had left her place around 3pm but since the sister did"
"not  give  evidence  it  amounts  to  hearsay  evidence  Thereafter,  she  complained"
"formally on the1st and the investigations had commenced."
"The  Military  police  had  taken  the  appellants  and  the  witness  Nishantha  and"
"Ariyadasa as suspects and later the witnesses Nishantha and Ariyadasa were"
"made witnesses."
"Hence on the 7th of October the Military police had lodged an investigation in to"
"the complaint and all the officers who had been on duty on the fateful day had"
"been taken in to custody and interrogated. This investigation had led to a dead"
"body being discovered from a toilet pit which had been only 50 meters away from"
"the resting place of the appellants while they had been on duty on the  fateful"
"day."
"The father of the deceased had identified the body on a special mark of the victim."
