"The post mortem had been done in Colombo and the cause of death had been"
"identified to be due to blunt trauma to the face neck and the pelvis area. But the"
"time death is not known."
"Hence  the  Counsel  for  the  respondents  averred  that  the  dead  body  of  the"
"deceased had been exhumed from  a toilet pit which had been very close to the"
"resting  place  of  the  appellants  within  24  hours  of  witness  Ariyadasa  seeing  a"
"female  going  in  to  the  resting  place  of  the  appellants  and  from  where  he  had"
"heard cries of a female and from which place, he had seen a dead body lying on"
"the floor."
"But Court is mindful of the fact whether it is enough to draw the inference that"
"the female who was seen going in to the resting place of the appellants was the"
"deceased and no one else, and when Court questioned the learned Counsel for"
"the respondents about this, he could not give a clear answer."
"A witness by the name of H Nishantha who also had been an army soldier and"
"who  had  been  on  duty  on  the  next  day  which  had  been  the  1st  October  had"
"revealed that the 1st appellant who had led them had told him to dispose a dead"
"body of a girl and he done so as he was a superior officer. He had wanted him to"
"get the assistance of the 2nd appellant. They had dumped the body of a female in"
"to a toilet pit, near the house which had been used as a resting place and from"
"this location the police had later recovered the body of the deceased. He does not"
"say that the body was taken out of the resting place but it had been outside . He"
"had not been able to view the body at the time of the disposing of the body. The"
"1st appellant had been near the disposal sight and it is he who had given them"
"the instructions."
"One of the grounds of appeal raised by the Counsel for the 2nd appellant"
"was that the evidence of this witness is highly unreliable because he was"
"unable to identify the sheet in which the body had been wrapped."
"But upon close scrutiny of the evidence from page 301 he says very clearly that"
"whatever he had to dump in the toilet pit was wrapped in a red color sheet and he"
"had  been  consistent  although  he  had  been  lengthily  cross-examined  and  the"
"defense had  marked  a contradiction  where he had said  that  in  the Magistrates"
"Court that he could not recall the type of the wrapping."
"Hence the Counsel for the 2nd appellant strenuously tried his level best show this"
"Court that the identification of the bed sheet in which the body had been wrapped"
"was unreliable but we find that before the trial Court he had been very specific in"
"the identification of the sheet which is the only nexus between the disposal of the"
"dead body and the recovery and that it was the body of the deceased."
