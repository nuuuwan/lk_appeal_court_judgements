"But we find that in this instance the jury if properly directed would not have found"
"the second and the third appellants guilty."
"As such we find the verdict of the jury is entirely perverse and bad in law as such,"
"we allow the appeals of the 2nd and the 3rd appellants and as there is evidence"
"which  can  be  considered  against  the  1st  appellant,  we  order  a  retrial  to  beheld"
"against the 1st appellant."
"We are aware of the time which had passed after the commission of the offence,"
"but  in  the  interest  of  justice  we  are  compelled  to  order  a  retrial  against  the  1st"
"accused appellant."
