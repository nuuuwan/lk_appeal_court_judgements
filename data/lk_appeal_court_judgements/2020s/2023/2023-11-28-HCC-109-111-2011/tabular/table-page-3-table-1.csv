"raped and murdered by the appellants  on or about 30.9.1996. The appellants"
"had been on duty at Kondaveeli check point on the Jaffna Palelei Road."
"According to witness Upali Ariyadasa who had been a soldier at the time of the"
"incident the 1st appellant had been their Copral and the 2nd appellant also had"
"been  a  soldier  like  him  and  the  3rd  had  been  a  Copral  attached  to  the  above"

"near the check point and which had been used as a resting place for the officers"
"on duty at the check point."

"been produced before the Magistrate."

"exactly told him that the girl seen going in to the house was killed ."
