"“D.H  Wijewardena  Associate  (Pvt)  Ltd  is  not  an  entity  registered  with"
"the  SLIA”  and  thus  the  said  company  “does  not  come  under  the"
"definition of practice under the SLIA, therefore regulations are directly"
"not applicable to the said company” (page 9 of the report). Therefore, it"
"appears  that  the  investigating  committee  concluded  that  the  22nd"
"respondent  did  not  violate  SLIA  regulations  after  considering  all"
"relevant factors."
