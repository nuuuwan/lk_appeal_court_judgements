"Ltd., and Two Others v. Aboosally, Former  Minister of Labour &"
"Vocational  Training  and  Others  -  (1997)  2  Sri  L.R  137  stated  that"
"“the remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors"
"or  to  substitute  a  correct  order  for  a  wrong  order.  Judicial  review  is"
"radically different from appeals, when hearing an appeal, the Court is"
"concerned with the merits of the decision under appeal. In appeal, the"
"appellate  Court  can  modify,  alter,  substitute  or  rescind  the  order  or"
"decision under appeal. (Vide Article 138 of the Constitution that gives"
"the  forum  jurisdiction  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  for  the  correction  of  all"
"errors in fact, or in law, committed by Courts of first instance, tribunal"
"or other institution.) In Judicial review, the Court is concerned with its"
"legality  and  cannot  vary,  modify,  alter  or  substitute  the  order  under"
"review.  On  appeal,  the  question  is  right  or  wrong,  on  review,  the"
"question is lawful or unlawful. Instead of substituting its own decision"
"for that of some other body as happens when an appeal is allowed, a"
"Court on review is concerned only with the question whether the act or"
"order under attack should be allowed to stand or not.”"
