"e.  The evidence led before the inquiry has not been properly considered."
"Objections of the respondents"
"The  1st  and  2nd  respondents  were  not  informed  that  the  petitioner  was"
"running at a loss,  and the documents  P2 (a),  P2 (b), P2(c),  and P2 (d) were"
"not submitted at the inquiry."
"The  employees  who 
joined 
the  petitioner  prior 
to 
the  year  2000  were"
"transferable only to another branch of the petitioner company and there was"
"no provision in the contract of employment to transfer the employees to any"
"entity  within  the  Group  of  Companies  to  which  the  petitioner  company"
"belongs."
"The petitioner had raised a preliminary objection that the services of the 3rd"
"to  the  221st  respondents  had  not  been  terminated  and  that the  1st  and  2nd"
"respondents  had  no  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into  the  matter  under  TEWA."
"The  2nd  respondent having  considered  the  preliminary  objection,  had  made"
"an  order  to  proceed  with  the  inquiry.    Then,  the  petitioner  filed  a  Writ"
"application  against  that  order  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  that  application"
"was  subsequently  withdrawn  by  the  petitioner.  That  fact  is  manifested  by"
"the document marked ‘Y’."
"At  the  conclusion  of  the  inquiry  held  under  TEWA,  the  2nd  respondent"
"submitted a report together with its recommendations dated 30.12.2010 and"
"the  1st  respondent  approved 
the  said  recommendation  on  14.01.2011."
"However, before the decision of the 1st respondent was communicated to the"
"petitioner,  the  petitioner  had  by 
letter  dated  21.09.2010  written  to  the"
"former  Minister 
regarding 
this  matter  and 
requested  a 
fair  decision."
"Thereafter,  both  parties  had  been  summoned  on  several  occasions 
for"
"meetings with the Minister.   On 18.01.2014, eight employees withdrew the"
"complaint  lodged  under  TEWA.    Despite  the  former  Minister’s  intervention"
"and lapse of four years, the petitioner was unable to resolve the matter with"
"the  remaining  employees.  Consequently,  a  decision  was  taken  by  the  1st"
"respondent on 26.01.2015 to dispatch the order for the petitioner."
"The  finding  made  consequent  to  the  inquiry  that  termination  had  occurred"
"as  a  result  of  the  closure  of  the  petitioner  which  is  the  matter  within  the"
"jurisdiction  of  the  1st  respondent.    The  transfers  were  found  to  have  been"
"made to different employees and were contrary to the terms of the contract"
"of  employment  entered  into  between  the  petitioner  and  the  3rd  to  221st"
