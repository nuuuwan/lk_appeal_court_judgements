"The","Supreme
Court,
in

case
of

Vs. Mohamed
Ali"
"(1981-1SLR-P262-SC), held that",""
"","“The powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are very wide and the"
"","Court can in a fit case exercise that power whether or not an appeal
lies."
"","Where the law does not give a right of appeal and makes the order final, the"
"","Court
of Appeal may nevertheless
exercise
its powers of
revision, but
it"
"","should do so only in exceptional circumstances. Ordinarily,
the Court will"
"","not
interfere by way of review, particularly when the law has expressly given"
"","an aggrieved party an alternate remedy such as the right
to file a separate"
"","action
except when
non-interference will
cause
a
denial
of
justice
or"
"","irremediable harm…………………… The fact
that a Judge's order is merely"
"","wrong is not a sufficient ground for exercising the powers of revision.”"
"In the light of","the foregoing determinations,
it
is settled law that
the existence of"
"exceptional","circumstances
is
a pre-condition for
the
exercise of
the powers of"
"revision. The practice of","the Court
to insist upon the
existence of
exceptional"
"circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law",""
"and crystalised into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed. The Petitioner in",""
"the instant Application has not established exceptional circumstances warranting",""
"the exercise of","revisionary powers of
this Court, and therefore,
the Application is"
"liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.",""
