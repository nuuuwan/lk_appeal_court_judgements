"Court. Adequate documents have not been tendered to substantiate the purported"
"bad health condition of the Petitioner."
"In
these
circumstances,
it
is
the
view of
this Court
that
the Petitioner
in this"
"Application
failed
to
put
forward
any
acceptable
reasons
to
not
invoke
the"
"appellate jurisdiction of
this Court under
section 62 (1) of
the Muslim Marriage"
"and Divorce Act No. 13 of 1951 (as amended)."
"Moreover,
it
is
trite law that
the revisionary jurisdiction of
this Court should be"
"invoked within a reasonable time as it
is an extraordinary jurisdiction provided by"
"law, exercised only at
the discretion of the Court. The instant revision Application"
"has been filed after
seven months
from the date of
the impugned Order of
the"
"Board of Quazi and the delay is not explained to the satisfaction of this Court. It is"
"to be noted that
the law assists
those that are vigilant with their
rights, and not"
"those that sleep thereupon (Vigilantibus dormentibus non jure subveniuent)."
"Furthermore,
the Supreme Court
in Shanmugavadivu Vs. Kulathilake2 observed"
"that “the
requirements of Rules 3 (1)
(a) and 3 (1)
(b) are
imperative.
In the"
"circumstances of
the case,
the Court of Appeal had no discretion to excuse the"
"failure of the plaintiff to comply with the Rules”."
"In the case of UDA Vs. Ceylon Entertainment Ltd.,3 the Supreme Court held that"
"“the appellant
failed to file in the Court of Appeal duly certified copies of material"
"documents as
required by Rules 3(b)
read with Rule 3(a) of
the Supreme Court"
"Rules. It is settled law that Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules must be adhered to”."
"In the instantApplication,
in terms of Rule No. 3 (b) read with 3 (a) of the Supreme"
"Court Rules,
the Petitioner has not
tendered a copy of
the Order of
the learned"
"Quazi which
is
a
vital
document
to
this Application, without
the
same
the"
"contention of the Petitioner cannot be substantiated."
"Be
that
as
it may,
the Board
of Quazi
has
rightly
observed the
fact
that
the"
"Petitioner, having signed the case record, had consented before the learned Quazi"
"to pay the amount
in dispute as child maintenance. Moreover,
the Board of Quazi"
"was of the opinion that
the learned Quazi had taken into consideration the income"
"of
the Petitioner before making the impugned Order.
In those circumstances,
it
is"
"2 2003-1SLR-215"
"3 2004-1SLR-95."
