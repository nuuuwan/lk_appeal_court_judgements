"the  owner  of  the  bakery  came  to  the  bakery  in  the  afternoon,  scolded  both  of"
"them and said that they should leave if they cannot work in the bakery."
"The position of the appellant had been that he left the bakery  as a result and"
"after  staying  for  few  days  at  his  previous  wifeâ€™s  house,  found  employment  in"
"another bakery and after about 7 days, the owner of the bakery and some others"
"came and took him to the police station. He has denied that he has anything to"
"do with the burn injuries suffered by the deceased and had claimed innocence"
"in that regard."
"It is clear from the Judgement pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of"
"Gampaha that the learned High Court Judge has been very much considerate of"
"the basic principles of evidence that need to be adhered to when evidence of a"
"case of this nature is evaluated. The learned High Court Judge has determined"
"that this is a matter where a dying declaration should be considered and has"
"drawn  his  attention  to  the  matters  that  needs  to  be  considered  in  such  a"
"situation."
"The learned High Court Judge has evaluated the evidence in that context and"
"had found that the evidence as to the dying declarations that the deceased had"
"allegedly  made  to  several  witnesses  and  to  the  police  officer  who  recorded  his"
"statement are cogent and reliable. The learned High Court Judge has considered"
"the defence taken up by the appellant and had determined that it did not create"
"any doubt as to the evidence of the prosecution witness. The evidence of the JMO"
"has  been  well  considered  since  the  cause  of  death  has  been  determined  as  a"
"condition  called  septicemia,  and  has  determined  that  the  occurring  of  such  a"
"condition was due to the deliberate  actions of the appellant  where  his actions"
"fall within the ambit of section 294 3rd limb. The appellant has been convicted"
"on that basis."
