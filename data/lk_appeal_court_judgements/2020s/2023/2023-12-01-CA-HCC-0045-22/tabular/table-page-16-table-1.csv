"It is clear from the Judgement of the learned High Court Judge that the evidence"
"has  been  considered  with  the  relevant  legal  requirements  in  mind  and  the"
"relevant  conclusions  have  been  reached  after  duly  analyzing  the  evidence,  for"
"which I find no reason to disagree."
"The  evidence  of  PW-07,  the  police  officer  who  recorded  the  statement  of  the"
"deceased clearly establishes the fact that he was able to speak and narrate what"
"happened  to  him.  The  deceased  has  made  a  dying  declaration  to  him,  which"
"clearly demonstrates that the statement has been made without any prompting"
"or influence."
"For the reasons considered above, I am of the view that the relying on the dying"
"declarations  that  have  been  made  by  the  deceased  to  determine  the  charge"
"against the appellant had been done after considering the evidence in accordance"
"with the law."
"Hence, I find no merit in the considered ground of appeal."
"The 3rd Ground of Appeal :-"
"In the 3rd ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant contends about"
"the productions taken over by the police during their investigations."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  productions  were  not  an  essential  requirement  in"
"proving the charge against the appellant and the prosecution has not relied on"
"productions to prove the charge."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  correctly  considered  the  issues  that  had"
"arisen during the trial in relation to the productions in its correct perspective. It"
"is the view of this Court, that even if there were no productions at all, given the"
"facts and circumstances and the evidence led in the trial provides a sufficient"
"basis  to  conclude  that  the  charge  has  been  proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt"
"against the appellant."
