"Colombo  General  Hospital,  the  deceased  was  able  to  talk,  suggesting  that  the"
"evidence of PW-01, which says that the  deceased  talked to him before he was"
"admitted to the hospital cannot be believed."
"However, I am in no position to agree with that contention. When reading the"
"evidence of PW-01 as well as that of PW-03, it becomes amply clear that what"
"the PW-01 had stated before the trial Court was the truth as to what happened"
"on that day. It may well be that the deceased had spoken to his employer just"
"before he was admitted to the hospital for medical care. He may not have spoken"
"thereafter  for  some  time  until  he  was  in  a  position  to  speak  after  receiving"
"treatment for his injuries. That does not mean that the evidence of PW-01 was"
"not cogent enough to accept as the truth. I am not in a position to believe that"
"the evidence in that regard as contradictory."
"Although the learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the evidence of"
"the witnesses was contradictory, I find no basis to consider as such. It is clear"
"from the evidence that the witnesses have spoken about what they saw and what"
"they heard from the deceased. The fact that there had been a previous quarrel"
"in the evening of the day of the incident had been an admitted fact which has"
"provided a corroboration as to the sequence of events that had happened on that"
"day. The evidence of PW-01 clearly indicates that the appellant was present when"
"he left his establishment after advising both the deceased and the appellant over"
"the dispute they had. It has been clearly established that after the incident, the"
"appellant was nowhere to be seen until he was arrested by the police some days"
"after the incident."
"I find no basis to accept the appellantâ€™s explanation that he left his job after his"
"employer told him to leave if he cannot work. The  evidence  of other witnesses"
"clearly establishes it was not the case, but the appellant was present until they"
"found that the deceased was set on fire. Even the evidence of PW-05 who was"
"another employer of the bakery who saw the deceased on fire speaks about the"
"appellant not being present when he looked for him at the time of the incident."
