"The 2nd Ground of Appeal:-"
"The 2nd ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant is based"
"on  the  premise  that  there  are  several  discrepancies  with  regard  to  the  alleged"
"dying declaration of the deceased."
"Before  considering  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  about  the  alleged"
"discrepancies,  I  would  now  proceed  to  consider  the  manner  in  which  a  dying"
"declaration  or  declarations  of  a  person  can  be  considered  as  evidence  in  a"
"criminal trial."
"In terms of section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance, statements by persons who"
"cannot  be  called  as  witnesses  are  relevant  under  certain  circumstances.  The"
"relevant section 32 (1) reads as follows."
