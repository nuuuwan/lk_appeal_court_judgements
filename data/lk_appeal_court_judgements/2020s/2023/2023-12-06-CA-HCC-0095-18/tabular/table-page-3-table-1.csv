"Thereafter  CI  Rajakaruna  had  taken  over  the  production  at  15.30  hours  on"
"22.7.2013 and had kept it in the safe until it has been sent to the Government"
"Analyst."
"One of the main grounds raised by the appellant  had been that the there had"
"been a break in the chain of productions."
"Upon perusal of the brief, we find that PS 50181 Jayatilleke’s number had been"
"rewritten over in the note book of PW1 and thereby the Counsel for the appellant"
"alleged that the notes had been tampered with."
"PW1 had been very lengthily cross-examined including other witnesses and they"
"had  been  found  fault  with  that  it  has  not  been  altered  according  to  police"
"regulations."
"But one has to be mindful of the fact that these notes had been put at about"
"4.30 in the morning at which time any normal human being is likely to make"
"mistakes, and this had been gone in to by the trial judge very carefully at page"
"318 of the judgment."
"Therefore, we see no breaking of the chain because it is only a human error and"
"we all as human beings are susceptible to such errors."
"The next point raised by the Counsel for the appellant is that the trial judge had"
"taken over the role of a prosecutor."

"defense and the prosecution both to ask questions if they wish to, but they have"
"not done so. The other times had been at pages, 219,244 ,258,254,263 and 284"
"according to which all had been not less than three  questions and all for very"
"good reason ."
"The Counsel for the appellant cited several judgements where it has been held"
"that the trial judge should not take the role of the prosecutor but in this instance,"
"we find that it had not been so and that the Counsel for the appellant has made"
"a baseless allegation."
"At this point we draw our attention to the case of Hattuwan Pedige Sugath"
"Karunaratne vs The Attorney General SC Appeal 32-2020 decided on 20 10"
"2020  by  Aluviuare  J  it  has  been  held  that  “Judges  have  a  duty  and  are"
"required to control the proceedings….and to intervene where necessary to"
"ensure the proceedings are conducted in a faire manner to all parties. In"
