"this respect the judges should follow the proceedings closely and should be"
"alive to the events unfolding before them‚Äù."
"As such in the instant matter we see no unfair interference by the trial judge but"
"instead he had been very vigilant in ensuring a faire trial to the appellant."
"The third ground of appeal raised by the Counsel for the appellant was that the"
"trial judge had failed to consider the dock statement made by the appellant. This"
"to we find is baseless because the trial judge had very carefully considered the"
"contents in the dock statement. (pages 323-325)."
"Therefore,  we  find  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant are all baseless and without merit."
"But  upon  consideration  of  the  evidence  led  at  the  trial  for  the  case  for  the"
"prosecution we find that the prosecution has led cogent evidence which had been"
"very  lengthily  cross-examined  but  the  witness  had  stood  the  test  of  cross-"
"examination very well and the prosecution had built up a very formidable case"
"for the prosecution."
"The defense had suggested to the witnesses that the so-called raid had not taken"
"place at the given time but before and at that time the appellant had been beaten"
"up by the police."
"This position had been put to the witnesses and the appellant also had taken up"
"the same in the dock statement, but the case for the prosecution had been very"
"formidable and consistent."
"Thereby the trial judge had upon analyzing all the evidence led by the defense"
"and  the  prosecution  had  found  the  appellant  guilty  for  the  charges  in  the"
"indictment."
"As such we see no merit in the grounds of appeal raised by the Counsel for the"
"appellant. Hence the instant appeal is dismissed."
