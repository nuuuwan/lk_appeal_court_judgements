"(PHC)  Appeal  No. 
In  Sadi  Banda  v  The  Attorney  General  CA"
"03/2013 dated 25.07.2014 the Court observed follows:"
"“Nevertheless,  the  Learned  Magistrate  has  confiscated  the  lorry.  I"
"am  of  the  view,  before  making  the  order  of  confiscation  Learned"
"Magistrate  should  have 
taken 
into  consideration,  value  of 
the"
"timber  transported,  no  allegations  prior  to  this  incident  that  the"
"lorry had been used for any illegal purpose, that the appellant and"
"or 
the  accused  are  habitual  offenders 
in 
this  nature  and  no"
"previous  convictions,  and 
the  acceptance  of 
the 
fact 
that 
the"
"Appellant  did  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the  transporting  of"
"timber without a permit. On these facts the Court is of the view that"
"the confiscation of the lorry is not justifiable”"
