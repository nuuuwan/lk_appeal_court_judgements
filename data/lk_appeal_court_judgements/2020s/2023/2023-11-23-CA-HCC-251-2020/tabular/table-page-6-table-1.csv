"1)  A  dock  statement  is  evidence  but  that  it  is  not  subjected  to  cross"
"examination and is unsworn,"
"2) if it is believed it must be acted upon,"
"3) if it creates a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution it must"
"be acted upon,"
"4) the dock statement of one accused must not be used against the other."
"As such we see a certain amount of bias in the mind of the trial judge in"
"analyzing the case for the defense which is a denial of a fair trial to the"
"appellant which is provided for in the Constitution itself."
"It has been held in the case of by Justice Rodrigo in James Silva Vs. Republic"
"of Sri Lanka 1980 (2) SLR 167."
"“A  satisfactory  way  to  arrive  at  a  verdict  of  guilt  or  innocence  is  to"
"consider  all  the  matters  before  the  court  adduced  whether  by  the"
"prosecution or by the defense in its totality without compartmentalizing"
"and, ask himself whether as prudent man, in the circumstances of the"
"particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or not - see"
"the Privy Council Judgement in Jayasena vs. Queen 72 NLR 313.”"
"Hence in the instant matter we find that if it is considered as a prudent man"
"as stated above the victim not mentioning the sexual harassment not even to"
"the mother when she has had so many opportunities and the exitance of a"
"boy  friend  simultaneously  to  her  stay  at  the  appellants  house  should  have"
"been considered more seriously by the trial judge rather than merely believing"
"every detail narrated by the victim."
"As such we see an  undue bias on the  part of the trial judge and an overly"
"sympathetic  attitude  towards  the  victim  which  we  think  has  caused  grave"
"prejudice to the case for the defense and it has deprived the appellant of a"
"fair trial which is guaranteed in our Constitution."
"As such we are compelled to set aside the conviction and the sentence entered"
"by the trial judge."
"As such we allow the instant appeal."
