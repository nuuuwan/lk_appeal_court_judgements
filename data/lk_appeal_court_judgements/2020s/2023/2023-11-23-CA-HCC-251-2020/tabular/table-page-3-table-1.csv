"but with her boy friend she has had sex more or less during the same time with"
"consent."
"The Dr Dassanayake who has examined her is the person who has revealed her"
"experience with the boy friend for the very first time in the entire case, and by"
"that  time  the  evidence  of  the  victim  had  been  concluded.  The  medico  legal"
"examination form had been marked as P1 and the medico legal report had been"
"marked as P2."
"But we note that the trial judge had chosen to  disregard this evidence on the"
"basis that there is a contradiction between P1 and P2 because the doctor had"
"failed to mention the boyfriend in the history of the medico legal report..."
"But  what  is  most  important  is  that  the  existence  of  the  boy  friend  and  her"
"dealings with him simultaneously to the purported activities with the appellant"
"shakes the creditworthiness of the victim."
"At the examination it has been revealed that she had been 10 weeks pregnant"
"but the fetus had been aborted."
"The evidence of the prosecution is that while she had been in the house of the"
"appellant the victim had been visited by her mother on a regular basis but she"
"had not told the mother nor anyone else the behavior of the appellant until she"
"had been found pregnant by the doctor."
"The  victim  had  been  in  a  different  house  before  being  diagnosed  of  being"
"pregnant, and in that house, she had been there for nearly a month according"
"to the victim and in that house has had developed headaches and the mother"
"had taken her to the doctor on the 1st of November."
"The mother of the victim had corroborated in the way the victim was introduced"
"to the house of the appellant and how frequently she visited the victim and also,"
"she had in fact had stayed as an inhouse maid in the house of the appellant."
"But she has contradicted in the period of time the victim had been in the house"
"of a neighbor of the appellant with the narration of the victim."
"Hence the prosecution has led the evidence of the mother of the victim, the doctor"
"and the police and when the defense was called the appellant has made a dock"
"statement denying the allegation."
"The defense had called many witnesses and they had said that during the time"
"the  allegation  was  made  there  had  been  several  maids  in  the  house  of  the"
"appellant  and      the  victim  had  not  divulged  the  purported  activities  of  the"
"appellant to anyone of them which is surprising."
