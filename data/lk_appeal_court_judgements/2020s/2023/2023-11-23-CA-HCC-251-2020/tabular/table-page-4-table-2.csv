"But upon perusal of the evidence of the prosecution and the defense we find the"
"following factors,"
"1)  The victim who had been according to her had been raped many times by"
"the appellant has not divulged the matter to her mother or to any one else"
"when she has had so many instances to do so, which is a little thought"
"provoking."
"2)  The victim has said in evidence that her experience with the appellant was"
"her very first experience sexually but the history given by her to the doctor"
"has contradicted the same."
"3)  Hence the question arises whether she can be believed."
"4)  The  mother  of  the  victim  has  said  that  she  and  her  elder  daughter  had"
"once come to the house of the appellant to take the victim home but the"
"victim had refused, therefore again the question arises as to why the victim"
"did not respond to the request of the mother and the sister if she had been"
"abused by the appellant."
