"It  is  evident  that  the  prosecution  had  not  led  any  evidence  to  the  effect  that  the  8th  accused-"
"appellant had benefited or connived in the commission of the said misappropriation. However, the"
"only evidence placed against the 8th accused-appellant is the alleged introduction of the account"
"holders. Therefore, these counts have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution"
"had  only  placed  evidence  against  the  8th  accused-appellant  based  on  the  testimony  of  Namal"
"Liyanagunawardena, who had testified with regard to the ""introduction endorsement"" written by"
"the Manager, Noel Wijendra in the mandate of the current accounts opened by the partners and"
"directors of the companies named above."
"Even in the said circumstances, the prosecution had not placed any evidence with regard to any"
"relationship between the 8th accused-appellant and any of the alleged account holders. At the trial,"
"there is evidence that the then Manager of the Pan Asia Bank, Kotahena Branch, Noel Wijendra,"
"prior  to  joining  the  Pan  Asia  Bank,  was  employed  as  the  Manager  of  the  Nations  Trust  Bank,"
"Colpetty Branch.  It  is  also  evidence  that  the  allegedly  fraudulent  current  account  holders  were"
"prior  customers  of  Nations  Trust  Bank  who  were  known  to  Noel  Wijendra.  Therefore, 
it 
is"
"paradoxical to state that the 8th accused-appellant had introduced them to Pan Asia Bank. In such"
"circumstances, the learned Trial Judge had not considered the alternative inferences which could"
"been drawn from the acts and actions of the Kotahena Pan Asia Bank Manager Noel Wijendra and"
"the other employees of the bank, including the prosecution witness Namal Liyanagunawardena."
"The learned Trial Judge had also incorrectly assumed the extent of the authority and the influence"
"wielded  by  the  8th  accused-appellant  as  a  customer  of  the  Pan  Asia  Bank  Kotahena  Branch,"
"wrongfully and erroneously inferring that the 8th accused-appellant had interfered and intervened"
"with  the  process  of  opening  of  the  accounts.  Thereafter  the  transactions  in  such  accounts  in"
"circumstances where there is no evidence to show that such customers were ever known to the"
"appellant. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge had only assumed that the 8th accused-appellant was"
"influential 
in  the  actions  of  the  Bank  Manager  Noel  Wijendra.  The 
learned  Trial  Judge  had"
"completely  disregarded the  possible  connivance  on  the part  of  the  bank  and  its  senior officers"
"namely, Namal Liyanagunaweardena, Siyumi Fernando, S. Premanath, Lilesha Athauda and other"
"employees as accessories to the criminal misappropriation committed by the customers."
"Even the plea of guilt tendered by the other 8th accused-appellant had been used or had prejudiced"
"the finding of the learned Trial Judge in convicting the 8th accused-appellant for the first count and"
"the  other  counts  in  the  indictment  without  a  fragment  of  evidence  to  prove  the  8th  accused-"
"appellant had acted in furtherance of a common design. The prosecution had not established a"
"common design on the part of the 8th accused-appellant and any of the other accused persons."
"The majority of the companies referred to in the indictment were in existence even prior to the"
"time period referred to in the indictment."
"Therefore, 
the  allegation  against 
the  8th  accused-appellant  had  not  been  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt to establish that the 8th accused-appellant is involved in the conspiracy and in"
"the  commission  of  the  alleged  offence  of  misappropriation.  The  8th  accused-appellant  had  not"
"been properly and legally convicted based on cogent, proper evidence and reasoning. When the"
"specific counts against the 8th accused-appellant have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt,"
"the  conviction  of 
the  appellant 
for  committing 
the  offence  of  conspiracy 
is  completely"
"misconceived and untenable."
"In establishing the offence of conspiracy, the following must be borne in mind."
