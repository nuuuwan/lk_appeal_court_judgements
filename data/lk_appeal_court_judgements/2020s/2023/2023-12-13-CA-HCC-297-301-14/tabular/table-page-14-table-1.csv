"crucial evidence to arrive at a just and fair decision."
"xi.  
The  learned  Trial  Judge  who  delivered  the  judgment  had  been  prejudiced  from  the"
"commencement of the Trial and had not properly evaluated all the evidence."
"According to the available evidence at the trial, the 8th accused-appellant is a proprietor and a"
"businessman who had been involved in several business ventures in Sri Lanka. It is evident that the"
"appellant was a director of K Port (Pvt) Ltd, which initiated the launch of Sri Lanka's first rail-driven"
"dry port in the year 2004. The learned Trial Judge in the judgment had specifically emphasized that"
"the prosecution, in order to establish the alleged counts against the appellant, had mainly relied"
"upon  the  evidence  of  the  witnesses 
from  the  Pan  Asia  Bank,  Kotahena  Branch.  Namely,"
"Prosecution Witness Namal Liyanagunawadena, in place of (PW 125), The General Manager of Pan"
"Asia Bank, Kotahena Branch Noel Wijendra, Prosecution Witness Lilesha Athawuda, in place of PW"
"134 Cashier S. Premanath and PW 135 Rajeev Perera."
"The prosecution had failed to place the evidence of Noel Wijendra (PW 125) - Manager of the Pan"
"Asia  Bank  Kotahena  Branch  -  who  had  been  originally 
listed  as  a  prosecution  witness.  The"
"prosecution also failed to place the evidence of PW 134 S. Premanath - one of the cashiers of the"
"Pan Asia Bank Kotahena Branch  - originally listed as a prosecution witness. Both these persons"
"were reported to have absconded. In the above circumstances, on 03.09.2009, the prosecution"
"had made an application to the learned Trial Judge to substitute PW 125 and PW 134 with Namal"
"Liyanagunawardena and Lilesha Namindi Athawuda to testify and had added them as witnesses."
"Thereupon, the appellant objected to the said application. However, the learned Trial Judge had"
"decided that the appellant could object to the testimony of the added witnesses at the time of"
"testifying."
"The added witness Namal Liyanagunawardena (PW 125) had testified to the effect that the Pan"
"Asia Bank, Kotahena Branch was declared open on  28.11.2003. He had been transferred to the"
"said branch only in the first week of November 2003 and was surprisingly retransferred in August"
"2004 to the Wattala Branch of Pan Asia Bank. The witness Namal Liyanagunawardena had stated"
"that  the  appellant  Kamil  Kuthubdeen  and  11  other  customers  had  been  invited to  the  opening"
"ceremony  of  the  Pan  Asia  Bank  Kotahena  Branch  on  28.11.2003.  He  further  states  that  the"
"customers  who  were  invited  to  the  opening  ceremony  had  collectively  deposited  100  million"
"rupees on the same day."
"The prosecution  also had  led  the  evidence  of  added  witness  Namal  Liyanagunawardena to  the"
"effect that several current accounts have been opened by individuals allegedly introduced by the"
"appellant. It is important to note that such evidence is solely based on the mandates prepared,"
"endorsed and authorized by the then General Manager of the Pan Asia Bank, Kotahena Branch,"
"namely Mr. Noel Wijendra and the other employees of the said bank including the witness Namal"
"Liyagunawardena.  Although  Namal 
Liyagunawardena 
has 
stated 
that 
the 
hand-written"
"endorsements  of  Mr.  Noel  Wijendra  placed  on  the  mandates  of  the  above-mentioned  current"
"accounts indicate that the alleged applicants had been introduced by the appellant, by contrast, it"
"is undisputed that there is no signature or handwriting of the appellant on the said mandates."
"The  prosecution  also  alleges  that  the  monies  misappropriated  by  the  alleged  fraudulent  VAT"
"refund  claims  have  been  deposited  to  the  above  current  accounts  of  the  applicants  ""who  are"
"allegedly introduced by the appellant"". The above evidence is solely based on the ""endorsements"
