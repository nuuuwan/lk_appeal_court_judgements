"inquire whether the two persons are independently pursuing the same end or they have come"
"together to pursue the unlawful object. The former does not render them conspirators but the"
"latter  does.  For  the  offence  of  conspiracy,  some  kind of  physical  manifestation  of agreement  is"
"required to be established. The express agreement need not be proved. The evidence as to the"
"transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful act is not sufficient."
"A conspiracy is a continuing offence which continues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or"
"frustrated by choice of necessity. During its subsistence whenever any one of the conspirators does"
"an act or series of acts, he would be held guilty."
"In straightening out the above, I refer to Ajav Agarwal v. Union of India and Ors, JT (1993) 3 SC 203,"
"wherein it was held:"
"""It  is  not  necessary  that  each  conspirator  must  know  all  the  details  of  the  scheme  nor  be  a"
"participant at every stage. It is necessary that they should agree to the  design or object of the"
"conspiracy. conspiracy is conceived as having three elements: (1) agreement; (2) between two or"
"more persons by whom the agreement is effected; and (3) a criminal object, which may be either"
"the ultimate aim of the agreement or may constitute the means or one of the means by which that"
"aim  is  to  be  accomplished.  It  is  immaterial  whether  this  is  found  in  the  ultimate  objects.  The"
"common law definition of 'criminal conspiracy' was stated first by Lord Denman in Jones' case that"
"an indictment for conspiracy must ""charge a conspiracy to do an unlawful act by unlawful means"""
"and was elaborated by Willies, J. on behalf of the judges while referring the question to the House"
"of  Lords  in  Mulcahy  v.  Reg  and  House  of  Lords  in  unanimous  decision  reiterated  in  Quinn  v."
"Leathern: ""A conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement"
"of two or more, to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a"
"design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into effect, the very"
"plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties, promise against promise, actus contra"
"actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful; punishable of for a criminal object, or for the use of"
"criminal means.‚Äù"
"The Supreme Court of India Mohd. Khalid vs. State of West Bengal [2002(7) SCC 3341 (supra) held"
"the legal position thus:"
"""We cannot overlook that the basic principle which underlies section 10 of the Evidence Act is the"
"theory of agency. Every conspirator is an agent of his associate in carrying out the object of the"
"conspiracy. section 10, which is an exception to the general rule, while permitting the statement"
"made  by  one  conspirator  to  be  admissible  as  against  another  conspirator  restricts  it  to  the"
"statement  made during the  period  when  the  agency subsisted.  Once  it  is  shown  that  a  person"
"became snapped out of the conspiracy, any statement made subsequent thereto cannot be used"
"as against the other conspirators under section 10."""
