"The prosecution has totally failed  to establish that the claims for VAT refunds in question were"
"false,  the  most  important  element  in  the  case.  This  is  the  most  important  element  that  the"
"prosecution  must  establish,  since,  without  any  proof  that  the  claims  made  were  false,  a  case"
"answerable by the accused does not arise. It was the argument of the learned counsel for the 5th"
"accused-appellant that the case of the 5th accused must be considered separately from others."
"It is important to focus whether there was a burden on the prosecution to show that there was"
"""no  production""  or  was  the  burden  on  the  defence  to  show  that  ""there  was  production""?  The"
"learned High Court Judge remarks that, as production was a matter within the knowledge of the"
"5th accused person, the 5th accused should have produced evidence to show production. This is a"
"misinterpretation of the relevant principle. A burden on an accused to establish something within"
"his exclusive knowledge cuts in only where the prosecution has established all relevant ingredients"
"of an offence including the matter in question and cannot be relied upon to supply a missing link"
"in  the  prosecution  case.  In  other  words,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  accused  only  where  there  is"
"evidence led by the prosecution that would lead to a contrary conclusion, if not for an explanation"
"by the accused."
"The prosecution cannot keep blanks in its case to be filled with the knowledge or assistance of the"
"accused  especially  `blanks'  which  the  prosecution  ought  to  have  found  evidence  to  fill  in.  The"
"conspiracy charges the prosecution has also failed to establish a meeting of minds between the 5th"
"accused and any of the other accused which is essential to prove a conspiracy. It applies to other"
"appellants too. In the circumstances, the conspiracy charge must fail and it results in the vitiation"
"of the basis on which the charges have been joined."
"The joinder of charges is illegal and is highly prejudicial to the accused.  The prosecution has also"
"failed to establish a common intention among the 1st, 4th and 5th accused. On that account, too,"
"counts 8 and 9 must fail."
"There  is  no  evidence  implicating  the  5th  accused-appellant  in  any other way.  In  the  absence  of"
"proof that the VAT refund claims were false, the prosecution has failed to establish that there was"
"no production during the period relevant to the charges. It is very clear that there is no case against"
"the 5th accused-appellant."
"In the circumstances, the 5th accused-appellant should be acquitted and discharged from this case."
"In the indictment, the following counts were preferred against the 6th accused appellant who was"
"tried in absentia but defended by a learned counsel."
"Count No. 1"
