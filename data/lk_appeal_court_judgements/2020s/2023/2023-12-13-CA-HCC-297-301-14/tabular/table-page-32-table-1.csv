"one  of  criminality with adequacy  of  knowledge of any existing fact  necessary  for  the  proposed"
"offense. Such an intention is meant to assist, encourage, promote and facilitate the commission of"
"a crime with the requisite knowledge as aforesaid.’"
"Suresh v State of U.P. ((2001) 3 SCC 673) held that,"
"‘Looking at the first postulate pointed out above, the accused who is to be fastened with liability"
"on the strength of Section 34 IPC should have done some act which has nexus with the offence."
"Such an act need not be very substantial, it is enough that the act is only for guarding the scene"
"for facilitating the crime. The act need not necessarily be overt, even if it is only a covert act it is"
"enough, provided such a covert act is proved to have been done by the co-accused in furtherance"
"of the common intention. Even an omission can, in certain circumstances, amount to an act. This"
"is the purpose of Section 32IPC. So, the act mentioned in Section 34 IPC need not be an overt act,"
"even an illegal omission to do a certain act in a certain situation can amount to an act, e.g. a co-"
"accused,  standing  near  the  victim  face-to-face  saw  an  armed  assailant  nearing  the  victim  from"
"behind with a weapon to inflict a blow. The co-accused, who could have alerted the victim to move"
"away to escape from the onslaught deliberately refrained from doing so with the idea that the"
"blow should fall on the victim. Such omission can also be termed as an act in a given situation."
"Hence an act, whether overt or covert, is indispensable to be done by a co-accused to be fastened"
"with the liability under the section. But if no such act is done by a person, even if he has common"
"intention with the others for the accomplishment of the crime, Section 34 IPC cannot be invoked"
"for convicting that person. In other words, the accused who only keeps the common intention in"
"his mind, but does not do any act at the scene, cannot be convicted with the aid of Section 34 IPC."
"Participation  in  the  crime  in  furtherance  of  the  common  intention  cannot  conceive  of  some"
"independent criminal act by all accused persons, besides the ultimate criminal act because for that"
"individual act, the law takes care of making such accused responsible under the other provisions"
"of the Code. The word ""act"" used in Section 34 denotes a series of acts as a single act. What is"
"required under law is that the accused persons sharing the common intention must be physically"
"present  at  the  scene  of  occurrence  and  be  shown  not  to  have  dissuaded  themselves  from  the"
"intended criminal act for which they shared the common intention."
"Culpability under Section 34 cannot be excluded by mere distance from the scene of occurrence."
"The presumption of constructive intention, however, has to be arrived at only when the court can,"
"with judicial servitude, hold that the accused must have preconceived the result that ensued in"
"furtherance of the common intention.’"
"A Division Bench of the Patna High Court in Satrughan Patar v. Emperor, AIR 1919 Pat 111 held"
"that  ‘it  is  only  when  a  court  with  some  certainty  holds  that  a  particular  accused  must  have"
"preconceived or premeditated the result which ensued or acted in concert with others in order to"
"bring about that result, that Section 34 may be applied."""
"In Lallan Rai v. State of Bihar, [(2003) 1 SCC 2681, it was observed thus,"
"""The above discussion in fine thus culminates to the effect that the requirement of the statute is"
"sharing the common intention upon being present at the place of occurrence. Mere distancing"
"himself from the scene cannot absolve the accused — though the same however depends upon"
"the  fact  situation  of  the  matter  under  consideration  and  no  rule  steadfast  can  be  laid  down"
"therefore."""
