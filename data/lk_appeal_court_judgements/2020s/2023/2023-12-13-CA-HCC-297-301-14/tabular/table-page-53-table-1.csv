"S
ince the learned Counsel for the appellants formulated separate grounds of appeal, I will now"
"proceed to consider the said grounds of appeal separately from each other."
"Although  separate  grounds  of  appeal  were  raised,  the  1st  count  preferred  against  them  was  a"
"common count against all the accused before the High Court, including the appellants."
"The  common  1st  count  preferred  against  them  was  a  count  based  on  conspiracy,  where  the"
"appellants were charged with conspiracy to commit the offence of criminal misappropriation of"
"the monies belonging to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), or aiding and abetting to commit"
"the  same  and or  agreeing  to  commit  with  a  common  intention  and or conspired to  commit  or"
"aided  and  abetted  the  said  offence  and  as  a  result  of  the  said  conspiracy,  committed  criminal"
"misappropriation  pertaining  to  public  money  to  the  value  of  Rs.  3,996,008,151.55  (රුපියල්"
"තුන්සිය අනූනම ක ෝටි හැට ලක්‍ෂ අටදහස් එ ිය පනස් එ යි සත පනස් පහයි), and"
"thereby committing the offence of criminal misappropriation in terms of section 386 read with"
"sections  113B  and 102 of  the  Penal  Code, punishable  in  terms  of  section  5  (1)  of  the  Offences"
"Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as amended by Amendment Act No. 76 of 1988 and 28"
"of 1999."
"I am of the view that before considering the grounds of appeal separately, it would be prudent to"
"consider the essential ingredients of the charge of conspiracy and the law relating to it, along with"
"the provisions relating to abetment to commit criminal misappropriation."
"Section 113A of the Penal Code defines the offence of conspiracy in the following manner."
