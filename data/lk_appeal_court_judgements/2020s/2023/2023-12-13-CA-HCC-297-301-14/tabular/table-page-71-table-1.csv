"not have been favourable to the prosecution, and was also of the view that not calling the said"
"witness had caused a grave prejudice to the 8th accused-appellant."
"The learned President’s Counsel was vocal that the only basis for the conviction of the 8th accused-"
"appellant  had  been  that  it  was  he  who  introduced  the  persons  who  opened  accounts  used  to"
"deposit the VAT refund cheques obtained from the IRD, and was of the view that without calling"
"bank manager Noel Wijendra, there was no way for the prosecution to establish that fact, and the"
"learned High Court Judge was misdirected when the evidence given by Namal Liyanagunawardena"
"was accepted to come to the findings against the 8th accused-appellant."
"His  submissions  were  mainly  pointed  towards  suggesting  that  it  was  the  bank  manager  Noel"
"Wijendra who should be held responsible for the opening of these accounts, whereas, not calling"
"him to give evidence shall have to be considered fatal for the prosecution’s case. He also pointed"
"out that none of the cheques issued by the IRD has been deposited to the account maintained by"
"the  8th  accused-appellant  at  the  Pan  Asia  Bank-  Kotahena  Branch  and  monies  deposited  to  his"
"account through other bank accounts cannot be considered as depositing the money belonging to"
"the IRD as stated by the prosecution."
"Admitting that the 8th accused-appellant had a close connection with the 1st accused, it was his"
"submission that it does not mean any conspiracy with him to commit misappropriation of state"
"property."
"The learned President’s Counsel submitted that the appeal of the 8th accused-appellant should be"
"allowed as the prosecution has failed to prove the charges against him beyond reasonable doubt."
"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"I will now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal urged by the 8th accused-appellant together"
"as they are interrelated."
"The primary focus of the submissions made by the learned President’s Counsel was that Namal"
"Liyanagunawardena was not a competent witness to speak about the actions of Noel Wijendra"
"who was not called as a witness, hence, any documents identified and attributed to Noel Wijendra"
"cannot be considered as evidence."
"In other words, the learned President’s Counsel has relied on the best evidence rule under the"
"English law, where it was considered that the best evidence must be given to prove a particular"
"fact."
"There can be no doubt that the manager of the Kotahena branch of Pan Asia bank during the time"
"relevant  to  the  charges  in  the  indictment  against  the  8th  accused-appellant  would  be  the  best"
"person who can provide the best evidence relating to the charges since the main contention of the"
"prosecution  had  been  that  it  was  the  8th  accused-appellant  who  introduced  persons  based  on"
"forged identities to open accounts in the name of the companies relating to the charges."
"However, I must emphasize that the English rule of the best evidence is no longer the norm under"
"the English law as well as our law."
"E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in the book, ‘The Law of Evidence’- Volume 1 at page 42 considers the"
"present applicability of this rule under the English law principles in the following manner;"
