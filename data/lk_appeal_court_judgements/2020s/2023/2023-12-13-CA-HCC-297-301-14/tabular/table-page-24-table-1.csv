"should agree to do a single illegal act. It may comprise the commission of a number of acts. Under"
"section 43 of the Indian Penal Code, an act would be illegal if it is an offence or if it is prohibited"
"by law."""
"In Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab, [1977] 4 SCC 540 the rule was laid as follows:"
"'The very agreement, concert or league is the ingredient of the offence. It is not necessary that all"
"the  conspirators  must  know  each  and  every  detail  of  the  conspiracy  as  long  as  they  are  co"
"participators in the main object of the conspiracy. There may be so many devices and techniques"
"adopted to achieve the common goal of the conspiracy and there may be division of performances"
"in the chain of actions with one object to achieve the real end of which every collaborator must"
"be aware and in which each one of them must be interested. Unity of object but plurality of means"
"and several offences may be committed by some conspirators even unknown to others. There must"
"be unity of object or purpose but there may be plurality of means sometimes even unknown to"
"one another, amongst the conspirators. In achieving the goal several offences may be committed"
"by some of the conspirators even unknown to the others. The only relevant factor is that all means"
"adopted and illegal acts done must be and purported to be in furtherance of the object of the"
"conspiracy  even  though  there  may  be  sometimes  misfire  or  overshooting  by  some  of  the"
"conspirators.'"
"In Mohammad Usman Mohammad Hussain Maniyar and Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, [1981] 2"
"SCC  443,  it  was  held  that,  “for  an  offence  under  section  120B  IPC,  the  prosecution  need  not"
"necessarily prove that the perpetrators expressly agreed to do or cause to be done the illegal act,"
"the agreement may be proved by necessary implication."""
"After referring to some judgments of the United States Supreme Court and of the Supreme Court"
"of India in Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab, [1977] 4 SCC 540, and Ajay Aggarval v. Union of India,"
"[1993]  3  SCC  609  the  court  in  State  of  Maharashtra  v.  Som  Nath  Thapa,  [1996]  4  SCC  659"
"summarized the position of law and the requirements to establish the charge of conspiracy,  as"
"under:"
"""The aforesaid decisions, weighty as they are, lead us to conclude that to establish a charge of"
"conspiracy knowledge about indulgence in either an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means is"
"necessary. In some cases, intent of unlawful use being made of the goods or services in question"
"may be inferred from the knowledge itself This apart, the prosecution has not to establish that a"
"particular unlawful use was intended, so long as the goods or service in question could not be put"
"to any lawful use.”"
"The charge of conspiracy can often be proved only by an inference from the subsequent conduct"
"of the parties in committing some overt acts,"
"In this regard, it has been held in, Attorney General Vs Potta Naufer 2007 ( 2) SLR 144 as follows:"
""" With respect to the degree of proof, it has been held in Queen v Liyanage, that the question is"
"not whether the inference of conspiracy can be drawn but whether the facts are such that they"
"cannot reasonably admit any other inference but that of conspiracy. As the evidence in support of"
"a charge of conspiracy is often circumstantial, the actual facts of the conspiracy may be inferred"
"from the collateral circumstances of the case. A charge of conspiracy can often be proved only by"
"an inference from the subsequent conduct of the parties in committing some overt acts, which"
"tend so obviously towards the alleged unlawful results as to suggest that they must have arisen"
