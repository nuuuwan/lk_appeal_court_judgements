"misappropriate  money  belonging  to  the  State.  The  8th  accused-appellant  had  been  one  of  the"
"persons who had introduced the 6th accused-appellant to open accounts."
"The main argument put forward by the learned President’s Counsel on behalf of the 6th accused-"
"appellant was that the prosecution has failed to establish that the 6th accused is the person who"
"opened the accounts attributed to him using a false identity by the name of Mohammed Nazeer"
"Carder."
"He pointed to the evidence of PW-250 who was one of the police officers investigated into the"
"matter,  where  it  has  been  stated  that  he  showed  the  photocopy  of  the  National  Identity  Card"
"marked as PN-42 (i) during the trial, to the parents of the 6th accused and they only identified the"
"photograph in the said photocopy, but stated that they know nothing about the name and the"
"address contained in the said identity card. The learned President’s Counsel was of the view that"
"cannot be termed as a positive identification of the 6th accused."
"The learned President’s Counsel pointed out that the mentioned father and the mother of the 6th"
"accused were never called to give evidence, and the evidence led by the prosecution as to the"
"identity of the 6th accused had been limited to the above piece of evidence only."
"It was his contention that although cheques issued from the entities mentioned in the charges"
"using the accounts opened using the name of Nazeer Carder had been deposited to the account"
"of  the  6th  accused  maintained  at  the  Seylan  Bank  Pettah  branch  since  the  cheques  have  been"
"issued  by  private  entities,  there  was  no  evidence  to  substantiate  the  fact  that  the  money"
"transferred  was  the  money  belonging  to  the  State,  and  hence  it  cannot  be  termed  as  public"
"property."
"He was also of the view that there was no evidence to show that the 6th accused was part of the"
"conspiracy  and  there  was  no  evidence  to  show  that  the  6th  accused  acted  with  the  common"
"intention with others to misappropriate the monies mentioned in the charges."
"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal of the 6th Accused appellant"
"It has not been disputed that by producing fraudulent VAT claims to the IRD under the names of"
"the bogus companies relating to the charges against the 6th accused, VAT refund cheques had been"
"obtained from the IRD."
"There is no doubt that the 1st accused, being a higher official of the IRD, and the 2nd accused, also"
"being an official of the IRD, had facilitated this fraudulent scheme to issue cheques on the basis of"
"VAT refunds. It was also undisputed that the accounts opened under the names of Progarment,"
"Euro Clothing, and Kobe Apparels had been opened using forged National Identity Cards, and one"
"of the persons who opened those joint accounts under the name of Mohammed Nazeer Carder"
"had used an Identity Card number issued to another person called Karunaratne. The official who"
"has given evidence on behalf of The Registrar of Persons has confirmed that the NIC used under"
"the name of Mohammed Nazeer Carder was a fraudulent document."
"As contended correctly by the learned President’s Counsel, it was necessary for the prosecution to"
"establish that the person mentioned as Mohammed Nazeer Carder was one and the same person"
"as the 6th accused-appellant, namely, Mohommed Moudjood Ameer Irshad, in order to prove the"
"charges attributed to him."
