"document or  record or other communication was made by the person who is purported"
"to have made it and similarly, shall presume the genuineness of any electronic signature"
"or distinctive identification mark therein."
"The above section clearly provides for the admission as evidence, the documents marked P-222"
"and P-223 as they are electronically generated documents that were in the possession of the Board"
"of Investment (BOI) to establish that there had been no exports by South Lanka Garment Industries"
"(Pvt) Ltd."
"Other  than  the  argument  that  the  said  documents  cannot  be  produced  without  following  the"
"provisions of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, there had been no challenge to"
"the  information  contained  in  the  electronic  record.  Therefore,  the  trial  Court  is  duty-bound  to"
"presume the truth of the information."
"I find no basis for the argument that the provisions of Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of"
"1995 shall still be applicable to a document of this nature. Section 22 of the Act clearly provides"
"that the said Evidence (Special Provisions) Act have no applicability to the documents produced in"
"terms of the Act."
"The relevant section 22 of the Act reads as follows."
