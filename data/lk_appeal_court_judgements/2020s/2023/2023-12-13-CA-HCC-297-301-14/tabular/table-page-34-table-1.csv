"Count 9 
- 
5th  accused  of  having  committed  criminal  misappropriation  of  a 
sum  of  Rs."
"157,854,483.65  during  the  period  01.02.2004 to  31.08.2004  acting  with a  common"
"intention with the 1st, 2nd and 4th accused."
"The 5th accused, being the owner of the garment manufacturing company South Lanka Garments"
"(Private) Limited (""South Lanka""), made false claims for Value Added Tax (VAT) refunds paid on the"
"'inputs' used in the manufacture of his products. The case for the prosecution was that the 5th"
"accused's company, South Lanka Garments, had made false claims for VAT refunds and thereby"
"misappropriated the sums mentioned in the charges. The prosecution attempted to establish that"
"the claims for VAT refunds were false by showing that there was no production at the factory. It"
"was an essential element that the prosecution had to establish."
"The 5th accused was tried in absentia. It is clear from the circumstances that the 5th accused was"
"not a fugitive from justice. At the time he left the country, even a statement had not been recorded"
"from him. He had no reason whatsoever to anticipate that a criminal investigation of this nature"
"would take place. He was receiving medical treatment abroad and his condition necessitated his"
"continued stay overseas. It was revealed that at the time the 5th accused left the country, he was"
"not a person wanted by the police. The fact that the police had not even recorded a statement"
"from him, proves this."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  5th  appellant  states  that  this  is  different  from  a  situation  where  a"
"suspect flees the country after institution of action or interrogation by the police. The indictment"
"was presented even without ascertaining his position. This is a serious irregularity which vitiates"
"the charges and proceedings against the 5th accused."
"The burden of the prosecution however, the absence of an accused, even where such absence is"
"deliberate and intended to evade liability, would not lessen the burden that lies on the prosecution"
"to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with established principles. The absence"
"of the accused does not exempt the prosecution from compliance with any of the requirements of"
"the law with respect to the burden of proof. The prosecution's burden to establish that there was"
"no production at the factory. The most important element the prosecution has to establish is that"
"the claims alleged to have been made by South Lanka for VAT refunds were false. The only way the"
"prosecution could do that was by proving that there was no production using the inputs in respect"
"of which claims were alleged to have been made, either due to the nonexistence of the company"
"or due to nonproduction. In respect of South Lanka, the existence of the company was admitted"
"by the prosecution. It only attempted to establish that there was no production during the period"
"relevant to the charges.  Thus, in the case of South Lanka, it was essential for the prosecution to"
"prove that the company did not produce any garments."
"The  prosecution  called 
three  witnesses 
for 
this  purpose.  They  were  Mohammed  Luthuf,"
"Hemalatha Hettiarachchi who was the Grama Niladharini of the area in which the factory of South"
"Lanka was situated, and R.M. Karunarathne, an Executive Director of the Board of Investment.  As"
"witness Luthuf had been abroad for a long time including the period relevant to the charges, the"
"prosecution did not proceed to elicit from him about the activities of South Lanka during the period"
"relevant to the charges."
"The learned High Court Judge in her judgement has wrongly concluded that this witness has, in"
"fact, testified to the effect that the factory was closed down during the period and that there was"
"no production. This conclusion is grossly contrary to the evidence of the witness.  While counts"
