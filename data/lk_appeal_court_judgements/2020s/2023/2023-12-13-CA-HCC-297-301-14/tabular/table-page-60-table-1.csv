"Consideration of the 1st and the 2nd Grounds of Appeal"
"As the 1st and the 2nd grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider both the"
"grounds of appeal together."
"The fact that the sums mentioned in counts 8 and 9 had been deposited to the account of the 5th"
"accused-appellant was not a disputed fact in this action. Therefore, it is clear that the cheques"
"relating to the said sums had been issued on the basis of VAT refund."
"The prosecution has led evidence to establish that, in fact, there was no production in the garment"
"factory  called  South  Lanka  Garment  Industries  (Pvt)  Ltd  during  the  relevant  period.  As  I  have"
"considered  before,  the  prosecution  has  relied  on  the  Grama  Niladhari  of  the  area,  namely,"
"Hemalatha Hettiarachchi, to show that there was no such production. The prosecution has also"
"called a former employee of the said garment factory to speak about the same fact."
"The contention of the learned Counsel for the 5th accused-appellant was on the premise that the"
"Grama  Niladhari  relied  on  hearsay  evidence  to  come  to  her  conclusions  that  there  was  no"
"production  in  the  garment  factory.  However,  it  is  amply  clear  from  the  evidence  of  the  Grama"
"Niladhari as well as the former employee of the factory that both of them had actually gone to the"
"factory  and  had  observed  that  there  was  no  production  going  on.  The  Grama  Niladhari,  in  her"
"investigations, had found that, in fact, there was no production for the last several years. It would"
"not have been necessary for the Grama Niladhari to determine the truthfulness of her findings by"
"going  inside  the  factory  as  any factory that  had been  closed  for  several years  can  be  visible  to"
"anyone who goes near it."
"The evidence of the former employee of the factory was also to the same effect. Although both of"
"them have gone near the factory after the relevant dates mentioned in the charges, that would"
"not  mean  that  their  observations  of  not  having  productions  prior  to  their  visits  were  wrong"
"conclusions. I find no reason to accept that their evidence amounts to hearsay, as the evidence"
"clearly shows that it was not."
"Apart  from  the  above  evidence,  the  earlier  mentioned  officer  from  the  BOI  had  given  clear"
"evidence  and  established  before  the  Court  that  there  had  been  no  exports  by  South  Lanka"
"Garment  Industries  (Pvt)  Ltd  during  the  period  relevant  to  the  charges.  The  official  who  gave"
"evidence on behalf of the Sri Lanka Customs had also confirmed the same. Therefore, I am of the"
"view that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that VAT refund payments had"
"been made to the 5th accused-appellant in a situation where there was no basis to claim a VAT"
"refund."
"The evidence of the Deputy Commissioner of the IRD, PW-17 Rajaratnam, who has spoken about"
"the  relevant  procedures  that  should  be  adopted  for  an  exporter  to  become  entitled  to  a  VAT"
"refund, clearly establishes the fact that the 5th accused-appellant had no right to claim a VAT refund"
"under any circumstances."
"This  Court  is well  aware  that  in  a  criminal  case of  this  nature, an  accused  person has  to  prove"
"nothing. It is up to the prosecution to prove the case against an accused person beyond reasonable"
"doubt. Any weaknesses in the case of the defence cannot be taken against an accused person as"
"the burden of proof still remains with the prosecution."
