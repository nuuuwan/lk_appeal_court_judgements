"process for over a century and today it is not true that the best evidence must be given,"
"though its non-production where available may be a matter for comment and may affect"
"the weight to be attached to the evidence that is produced in its stead.”"
"In the case of Vanderbona Vs. Perera (1985) 2 SLR 62 at 67, the Supreme Court recognized the"
"fact that the best evidence rule is now whittled down, and though the non-production of the best"
"evidence may be a matter for comment or may affect the weight of the evidence that has been"
"produced, it is not true that the best evidence must be given to prove a fact."
"It is clear from the evidence led in this case that the originally named PW-125 in the indictment,"
"namely, Noel Wijendra, has left the country and cannot be contacted. At the investigation stage,"
"he has given statements to the police and had assisted in the investigations. It appears that after"
"considering  the  relevant  statements  and  the  investigations  carried  out  in  that  regard,  the  Hon."
"Attorney General has decided to make him a witness."
"The only assumption that can be reached under the circumstances would be that there was no"
"material  before  the  Hon.  Attorney  General  to  treat  Noel  Wijendra  as  an  accused  in  this  case,"
"although  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  took  pain  to  create  a  picture  that  he  was  also  an"
"accessory to the whole scheme of fraudulent Vat refund claims. Namal Liyanagunawardena who"
"has  given  evidence  in  place  of  Noel  Wijendra  had  been  no  stranger  either  to  the  8th  accused-"
"appellant or to the operations of the Pan Asia Bank- Kotahena Branch. He had known manager"
"Noel  Wijendra  even  previously  when  he  was  working  in  another  bank  with  him  and  was  well"
"conversant with the writing and signature of Noel Wijendra."
