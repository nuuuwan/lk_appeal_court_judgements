"i.  The  inference  of  common  intention  should  not  be  reached  unless  it  is  a  necessary  inference"
"deducible from the circumstances of the case.â€™"
"T
he law in Sri Lanka follows the view expressed by the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghose vs"
"King-Emperor;  AIR  1924  Cal  545  in  which  it  was  observed  that  where  each  of  several  persons"
"commits a different criminal act, each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all,"
"each  of  them  is  liable  for  each  such  act  as  if  he  did  it  alone.  As  per  the  dictum  in  King  Vs."
"Mudalihamy; 47 NLR 139 the effect of the application of section 32 is that the casual effectiveness"
"of the act of each accused to produce the harm is no longer treated as a relevant consideration."
"The  operation  of  the  section  preconceives  a  shared  intention  by  all  the  accused  but  does  not"
"depart from the principle that each accused is punished based on his or her individual intention."
"The section also requires that a criminal act be conducted by each of the accused in furtherance"
"of the common intention of all."
"There  exists  an  important  distinction  between  a  common  intention  and  the  same  or  similar"
"intention  or  common  object.  While  each  of  the  accused  may  have  a  similar  intention  with  a"
"common object in view, this does not attract the application of section 32 of the Code. The same"
"intention becomes a common intention only when it is shared by all. This principle emerges clearly"
"in R Vs. Ranasinghe; 47 NLR 373 and the judgment of Weeramantry J. in Wilson Silva v. The Queen;"
"76 NLR 414, in which he pronounced that ""... the crucial distinction they (the jury) should have in"
"mind was that, even if this was a simultaneous attack such attack should have been in consequence"
"of a sharing of intentions ..."""
"In a case of murder against all the accused where the accused are sought to be made liable on the"
"basis of section 32, the common intention must necessarily be a murderous common intention. In"
"a similar vein in the instant matter at hand, when criminal misappropriation is concerned as per"
"section 386 of the Penal Code, it must be proved that the accused harboured the relevant degree"
"of dishonesty in misappropriating property."
"In King V. Asappu; 50 NLR 324, several persons were accused of being responsible for an attack"
"which caused the death of the victim."
"Dias  J.  in  his  judgment  laid  down  the  rules  that  in  order  to  justify  the  inference  of  common"
"intention  there  must  be  evidence,  direct  or  circumstantial,  either  of  pre-arrangement  or  a"
"prearranged plan or a declaration showing common intention or some other significant fact at the"
"time of the commission of the offence. This principle has also been recognized in the Indian case"
"of Mahbub Shah V. Emperor (1925) (A. C. 118)."
"The distinction between common intention and common object was emphasized by Basnayake"
"C.J. in Ekmon. In King V. Appuhamy; 46 NLR 128  Sansoni, J. observed that ""a common object is"
"different from a common intention in that it does not require prior concert and a common meeting"
"of minds before the offence is committed."
"Significantly, in Wasalamuni Richard v The State,76 NLR 534, eyewitness testimony was conclusive"
"only against the 1st and 2nd accused. The evidence against 3rd accused the younger brother of"
"the 1st accused was circumstantial in that he was present on the road at the time of the abduction"
"at the time and place of the killing and at the direction of the 1st accused he prevented the witness"
