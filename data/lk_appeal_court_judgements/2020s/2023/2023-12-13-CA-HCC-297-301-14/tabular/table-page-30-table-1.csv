"from leaving the scene of the crime. The court in this case held that the circumstantial evidence"
"against him was sufficient in the absence of any explanation tendered by him with regard to his"
"presence, to establish that he acted in furtherance of a common murderous intention shared with"
"the other accused as his presence was a participating presence."
"In  Weerasinghe  v  Kathoramahathamby,  several  indicia  were  used  by  the  court  in  coming  to  a"
"conclusion of common intention. The fact that the accused had arrived together at the scene of"
"the crime, that one accused was carrying an explosive substance and used it without protest from"
"the  other  accused,  that  the  other  accused  had  taken  action  in  furtherance  of  their  common"
"intention, and that they all made away upon the approach of officers, were considered relevant by"
"a court in determining liability based on common intention."
"It is clear that the case against each person must be considered separately and that the application"
"of section 32 of the Code is attracted only upon the fusion of the relevant mens rea by reference"
"to a common intention. While Sri Lankan courts have consistently held that mere presence at the"
"scene of the crime does not by itself support an inference of common intention. Basnayake, C.J. in"
"Vincent  Fernando  has  clarified  that  this  principle  does  not  extend  to  a  person  whose  act  of"
"standing and waiting is itself a criminal act in a series of criminal acts done in furtherance of the"
"common  intention  of  all.  Reference  is  made  to  the  observations  of  Lord  Summers  in  Barendra"
"Kumar Ghose (supra)that ""even if the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door it is to"
"be remembered that in crimes as in other things, they also serve who only stand and wait."""
"Section 31 of the Penal Code the word ""act"" denotes as well a series of acts as a single act. The"
"""presence of the accused"" in terms of Section 32 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code and the ""presence"
"of the accused"" requirement under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be compared with the"
"following Indian authorities."
"In Tukaram Ganpat Pandare vs the State of Maharashtra on 6 February 1974 the Supreme Court"
"of India observed that mere distance does not free one from liability under Section 34, essentially"
"implying  that  presence  at  the  scene  of  the  commission  of  the  criminal  act  is  not  a  necessary"
"requirement to prove common intention. Rather, the essence of the section is ""criminal sharing"""
"which may be evidenced either through active presence or even with distance."
"Mere  distance from  the scene  of  crime  cannot  exclude  culpability under Section  34  which  lays"
"down  the  rule  of  joint  responsibility  for  a  criminal  act  performed  by  a  plurality  of  persons.  In"
"Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. The King- Emperor (1924) 52 IA 40: AIR 1925 PC 1, the Judicial Committee"
"drew into the criminal net those 'who only stand and wait. This does not mean that some form of"
"presence, near or remote, is not necessary, or that mere presence, without more, at the spot of"
"crime, spells culpability. Criminal sharing, overt or covert by active presence or by distant direction,"
"making out a certain measure of jointness in the commission of the act is the essence of section"
"34."
"In Ramaswami Ayyangar and Ors vs State of Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court of India held â€˜In the"
"case of an offence involving physical violence, it is essential for the application of S. 34 that the"
"person who instigates or aids the commission of the crime must be physically present at the actual"
"commission of the crime for the purpose of facilitating or promoting the offence, the commission"
"of which is the aim of the joint criminal venture. The ""act"" spoken of in S. 34 includes a series of"
"acts as a single act. It follows that the words ""when a criminal act is done by several persons"" in S."
"34,  may  be  construed  to  mean  ""when  criminal  acts  are  done  by  several  persons"".  The  acts"
