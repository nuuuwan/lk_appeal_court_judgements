"be observed that no such Constitutional provision is to be found either in the ‘1948 Soulbury"
"Constitution’ or the ‘First Republican Constitution of 1972.”"
"It is my considered view that in this action, even if the learned High Court Judge had elaborated"
"more on the evidence and analysed it more substantially, the ensuing result would have been the"
"same, as held by the learned High Court Judge."
"Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  no  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  appellant,  nor  has  it"
"occasioned a failure of justice due to the alleged misdirection in the judgment."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  no reason  to  interfere  with  the  conviction  and  the"
"sentence of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo."
"Accordingly, the appeals of the 5th, 6th, and 8th accused-appellants are dismissed for want of any"
"merit."
"The convictions and the sentence affirmed."
