"The prosecution was unsuccessful in proving all the elements of the offence beyond reasonable"
"doubt."
"The infirmities in the judgment support the contention that the finding of the learned trial judgeâ€™s"
"judgment is unsound in law. For the reasons set out above, I conclude that the learned trial Judge"
"had  misdirected  herself  by  failing  to  evaluate  the  said  material  in  favour  of  the  5th,  6th  and  8th"
"accused-appellants."
"I, therefore, decide to set aside the conviction and sentence dated 26.09.2014."
"The appeal of the 5th, 6th and 8th accused-appellants are allowed. Three of them are acquitted"
"from all charges in the indictment."
