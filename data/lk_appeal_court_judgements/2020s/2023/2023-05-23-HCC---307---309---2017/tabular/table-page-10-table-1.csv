"the  witnesses  are  not  to  be  disturbed  lightly  in  appeal  â€œ  but  in  the"
"instant  case  in  view  of  the  glaring  contradictions  in  the  prosecution"
"case  and  the  appellants  had  been  denied  a  fair  trial  in  view  of  the"
"inadequate consideration of the case for the defense by the trial judge"
"and  the  presence  of  others    at  the  scene  apart  from  the  appellants"
"creates  a  reasonable  doubt  in  the  case  for  the  prosecution  which"
"according to the fundamentals of criminal law has to be given to the"
"appellants."
"As  such  the  instant  appeal  is  allowed  and  the  conviction  and  the"
"sentence of the trial judge is hereby set aside."
