"In 
terms  of  Article  55(3)  of 
the  Constitution, 
the  appointment,  promotion, 
transfer,"
"disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers shall be vested in the PSC, subject to the"
"provisions of the Constitution and such power shall be delegated to a committee of the PSC"
"or to a public officer. It appears that in terms of Article 61B, the PSC of which the role and"
"powers  are  constitutionally  entrenched  is  empowered  to  make  rules  relating  to  the  public"
"service.  Nevertheless,  the  E-Code  has  been  issued  with  the  approval  of  the  Cabinet  of"
"Ministers  and  our  courts  have  constantly  decided  that  the  E-Code  has  statutory  force  (see"
"Gayani  Amitha  Wickramasekara 
v  Dharmasena  Dissanayake  Chairman,  Public  Service"
"Commission and Others SC/FR/257/16 decided on 05.11.2021, Abeywickrama v Pathirana and"
"others 
[1986]1  Sri  LR  120  and  Public  Service  United  Nurses  Union  v  Minister  of  Public"
"Administration and others [1988] 1 Sri LR 229 ). However, the E-Code should not reflect any"
"conflict in reference to the provisions of the said Rules regarding the appointment, promotion"
"and disciplinary control of public officers. In light of the above, a public servant is bound to"
"follow  the  provisions  of  the  said  Rules  and  the  E-Code  and  he  should  always  uphold  the"
"highest standards of conduct, honesty and probity in discharging his public duties. Similarly,"
"it cannot be assumed that the effect of the aforementioned section 173(VI) of the said Rules"
"will be undermined by section 1.3 of Chapter V of the E-Code."
"Even in the alleged letter of demand marked ‘P22’ it is stated that the Petitioner has remained"
"to work at SLPA because he had a genuine expectation and understanding that his request"
"for release from public service would be approved by the Secretary to the Ministry of Health."
"It is abundantly clear that the Petitioner giving 3 days' notice (including two days during the"
"weekend)  has  commenced  employment  at  SLPA  without  duly  securing  his  release  from"
"public  service.  Such  conduct  of  the  Petitioner  amounts  to  an  obvious  violation  of  the"
"respective provisions of the E-Code and the said Rules."
"The conduct of the Petitioner in the instant Application in my opinion can be viewed as a"
"non-compliance  of  Rules  for  his  own  benefit  on  an  alleged  expectation.  I  simply  cannot"
"understand  how  a  public  officer  could  abandon  his  substantive  post  based  on  an  alleged"
"‘expectation’  and  an  ‘understanding’,  regardless  of  how  genuine  it  appears  to  be  to  him."
"Clause 05 of the format of a letter of appointment reflected in Appendix 03 of the said Rules"
"of the PSC emphasizes that a public officer has no right to engage himself in a job in any other"
