"In light of the above and upon perusal of the relevant Gazette Notifications, I am convinced"
"that the 2nd Respondent is vested with the powers in regard to the disciplinary control of the"
"Public  Health  Inspectors  attached  to  MRI  including  the  Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  has  not"
"formulated  any  contrasting  view  in  relation  to  the  provisions  spelled  out  in  the  aforesaid"
"Gazette Notifications."
"The  stand  maintained  by 
the  Petitioner 
throughout 
these  proceedings 
is 
that 
the  1st"
"Respondent’s decision to issue a letter of vacation of post and also not to release the Petitioner"
"from the public service is unlawful, arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The basis for such"
"contention of the Petitioner is that he has informed the 1st Respondent by letter marked ‘P17’"
"(dated 30.04.2021) the fact that he would report to work at SLPA with effect from 03.05.2021,"
"anticipating the approval concerning the request made by him for release from public service."
"The rules relating to the release of a public officer on appointment to another post in the public"
"service and to a post outside the public service are stipulated in Chapter XII of the Procedural"
"Rules1 (published on 14.12.2022) of the PSC. On a careful perusal of those Rules, it implies"
"that it is mandatory for a public officer to secure his release from the appointment he holds"
"before  accepting  a  new  post  either  within 
the  public  service  or  outside.  It 
is  clearly"
"demonstrated in section 173(VI) of Chapter XII of the said Procedural Rules ('Rules'), that"
"unless otherwise decided as a Government policy, the appointing authority shall not refuse to"
"release an officer who seeks to better his future prospects unless, where disciplinary action"
"against  the  officer  is  in  progress,  or  is  contemplated  against  him.  The  said  current  Rules"
"published in 2022 illustrate the word ‘contemplation of disciplinary action’ even to include a"
"preliminary investigation. In the instant Application, the subject disciplinary inquiry against"
"the Petitioner has presumably passed early steps and arrived at the domestic inquiry stage. It"
"is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner places reliance on section 1.3 of Chapter V of the"
"Establishments  Code 
(E-Code)  which  describes  certain  grounds  where 
the  appointing"
"authority will not refuse to release an officer, who seeks to better his prospects under normal"
"circumstances."
