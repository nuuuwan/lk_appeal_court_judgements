"without  any  malice  or  ulterior  motive  consequent  upon  the  Petitioner  boarding  a  vessel"
"without lawful authority while he was serving as a public servant. The Respondents state that"
"they possess disciplinary authority over the Petitioner and deny any usurpation of the powers"
"of the Health Service Committee of the PSC. The other main contention of the Respondents"
"is that the Petitioner has participated in the respective domestic inquiry for 2 years and did"
"not at any stage challenge the legal authority of the Respondents to conduct the same. Placing"
"reliance on the judgement of this Court in Sunethra Rupasinghe v. D. S. K. Pushpakumara of"
"the Sri lanka Hockey Federation and Others CA/WRIT/627/2021 decided on 08.06.2022, the"
"Respondents assert that the Petitioner has failed to adduce any reasons as to why he has not"

"Appeal in terms of section 7.4 of Chapter V of the E-Code and section 174 of the said Rules."
"The  Petitioner  urged  that  the  instant  Application  be  considered  by  this  Court  without"
