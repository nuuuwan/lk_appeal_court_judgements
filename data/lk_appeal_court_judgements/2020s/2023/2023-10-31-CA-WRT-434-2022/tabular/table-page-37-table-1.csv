"66)","It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  1st  Respondent  was  a  nominated  Member  of"
"","Parliament.    Her  Party  was  elected  upon  the  franchise  of  the  citizens’  voting  right."
"","Therefore, there is a duty cast upon the 1st Respondent to be transparent and accountable"
"","to the public."
"67)","Unlike government servants, a Members of Parliament are elected by the peoples’ vote."
"","They are maintained by the tax payers’ money and the public funds.  Therefore, they"
"","should be accountable to the public. The Petitioner and also the public have a legitimate"
"","expectation  that  when  they  are  casting  the  votes,  the  person  to  whom  the  votes  are"
"","casted is a citizen of Sri Lanka and/or their votes are used to nominate a National List"
"","Member who is a citizen of Sri Lanka."
"68)","On that, I do not see any bar, difficulty or obstruction for the 1st Respondent to divulge"
"","her citizenship right to the court.  However, the 1st Respondent had taken up objections"
"","and has not divulged her citizenship right."
"69)","In  the  event,  the  1st  Respondent  had  produced  documents  to  support  her  citizenship"
"","right that the Petitioner could not have maintained this Application.  However, the 1st"
"","Respondent’s denial had strengthened the Petitioner’s prima facia case against the 1st"
"","Respondent."
"70)","As I have stated before, the Counsel for the 1st Respondent relied on the argument that"
"","the statement made by the 1st Respondent to the Criminal Investigations Bureau cannot"
"","be used against her.  It should be noted that the 1st Respondent made her statement to"
"","the Criminal Investigation Bureau on 31st October 2022, at the time she was holding"
"","the position of a State Minister. Moreover, the 1st Respondent never alleged that the"
"","statement was involuntary or made under duress."
"71)","Therefore, I am conscious of the fact that there was no duress, threat or influence when"
"","she was making the said statements to the Criminal Investigation Bureau."
"72)","On that, the narrow view is that the 1st Respondent’s integrity, honesty, transparency"
"","and accountability are questionable as she had failed to produce any document or satisfy"
"","the  court  to  counter  the  prima  facia  case  put  forward  by  the  Petitioner  against  her"
"","citizenship right."
"73)","Beside 
these  facts,  President’s  Counsel  Shavindra  Fernando  appeared  for 
the  1st"
"","Respondent raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner has failed to follow the"
"","Rule  No.3.1(a)  of  the  Court  of Appeal  Rules  to  tender  original  documents  or  duly"
"","certified documents as per the said Rules."
