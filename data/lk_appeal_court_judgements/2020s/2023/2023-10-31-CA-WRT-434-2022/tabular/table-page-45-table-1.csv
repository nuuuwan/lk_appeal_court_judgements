"102)","I 
too  agree  relating 
to  obtaining 
the  1st  Respondent’s  passport,  producing  birth"
"","certificate  should  be  investigated  and  decided  by  the  aforesaid  Magistrate’s  Court"
"","proceedings."
"103)","However, this Application is a Writ of Quo Warranto.  As following the principles of"
"","the Writ of Quo Warranto, this Court has issued notice to the 1st Respondent."
"104)","The Petitioner had produced sufficient material to show that the 1st Respondent has not"
"","obtained Sri Lankan Citizenship and/or has renounced her British Citizenship."
"105)","It is a manifest ground, in a Writ of Quo Warranto for the 1st Respondent to counter and"
"","satisfy the Court that she is a citizen of Sri Lanka.  Further, being a Parliamentarian, the"
"","1st  Respondent  should  be  transparent  and  should  have  shown  her  genuineness  with"
"","regard to her Sri Lankan Citizenship."
"106)","As  against 
the  documents  and 
the  material  produced  by 
the  Petitioner, 
the  1st"
"","Respondent had failed to prove that she is a citizen of Sri Lanka."
"107)","The 1st Respondent has an obligatory right towards the Petitioner and the public as she"
"","is holding a public office maintained by the tax payers’ money and funds of the public."
"108)","Therefore, I emphasis being a Member of Parliament, the 1st Respondent should be an"
"","example and transparent and accountable to the public."
"","When  referring  to  case  laws,  it  is  clear  that  the  aforesaid  ground  has  been  further"
"","substantiated by British judgements on accountability and the proper administration of"
"","justice."
"","A  classic  example  is  provided  by  the  case  of  R  v  Festus  Onasanya  and  Fiona"
"","Onasanya.27  Fiona  Onasanya  (‘Onasanya’)  was  both  a  solicitor  by  profession  and  a"
"","Labour Member of Parliament. Yet, at the Central Criminal Court in London, she was"
"","convicted  by  a  jury  of  perverting  the  course  of  public  justice  by  providing  false"
"","information to the authorities about the identity of a car that had been driven beyond"
"","the  speed  limit. Addressing  Onasanya  in  his  Sentencing  Remarks,  dated  29  January"
