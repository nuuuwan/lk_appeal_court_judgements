"of course, due to its discretionary nature. A court has to examine any Writ application, having"
"considered  the  merits  of  the  case  and  the  question  of  an  issuance  of  a  Writ  apart  from  the"
"Petitioner's ipse dixit, the Petitioner does not have an iota of evidence that would substantiate"
"his claim against the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner has come before this Court without any"
"prudence, while failing to comply with the Supreme Court Rules."
"Therefore, it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that this entire application before this Court"
"is a blatant show of the mala fides on the part of the Petitioner. The Petitioner is before this"
"Court  with  malintent,  in  a  vexatious  attempt  to  bring  disrepute  to  the  1st  Respondent  and"
"tarnishing her good name, in pursuit of the Petitioner's personal agenda."
"In the totality of the foregoing circumstances, the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the relief"
"sought  before  this  Court,  and  the  1st  Respondent  moves  that  this  Court  to  dismiss  this"
"Application, which is without any legal basis or merit."
