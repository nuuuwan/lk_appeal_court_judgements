"measures  related  to  the  arrests  under  the  offenses  of  the  Immigration Act. The  proceedings"
"before the Chief Magistrate's Court of Colombo have since been laid by."
"The decision of the learned Magistrate in not issuing a warrant for arrest is keeping in line with"
"numerous decisions of this Court in which this Court, in applications for judicial review, have"
"considered whether a Magistrate has the power to issue a warrant of arrest even in cases where"
"the Police can make an arrest without a warrant. These decisions have ultimately led to the"
"quashing and staying of orders of arrest issued by the Magistrate's Court."
"The 1st Respondent draws the attention to the decisions of this Court in C.A. (Writ) Application"
"No.63/2020  [Sandesh  Ravindra  Karunanayake  Vs.  Hon. Attorney  general  and  5  Others],"

"evidence of an offence, as alleged by the Petitioner, committed by the 1st Respondent or that"
"there is prima facie suspicion of the same, as the 1st Respondent has not been arrested to date"
"or named as a suspect in the Magistrate's Court case. Therefore, it is clear that the Petitioner is"
"attempting to circumvent the ordinary course of criminal procedure and compel this Court to"
"make an order that would in  effect  bring ruin and disrepute to  the 1st Respondent  based on"
"claims made argumentum ad hominem."
"In these circumstances it is legally untenable and indefensible to issue a Writ of Quo Warranto"
"especially considering the fact that key facts remain in dispute and the investigation has not"
"even  passed  the  threshold  stage  of  making  the  1st  Respondent  a  suspect  or  arresting  the  1st"
"Respondent on the grounds of reasonable suspicion."
"What has been sought from the Court of Appeal is a Writ of Quo Warranto and it is established"
"that such writs are discretionary remedies of Court. Even if this Court was to find in favour of"
"the  Petitioner,  as  the  relief  sought  are  discretionary  remedies,  Court  is  bound  to  consider"
"whether  the  Petitioner  has  satisfied  court,  as  regards  the  grounds  on  which  a  Writ  of  Quo"
