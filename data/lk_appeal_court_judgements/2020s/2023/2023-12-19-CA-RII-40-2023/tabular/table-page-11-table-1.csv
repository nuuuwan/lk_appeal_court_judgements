"Attorney-at-Law for the respondent, it was pointed out by Counsel for the"
"respondent in open Court on 5.8.81 that the application for Leave to Appeal"
"was out of time. This statement has not been denied by the petitioner, so"
"that even though the petitioner was well aware that her application for Leave"
"to Appeal was out of time, she took no prompt steps to file an application"
"for revision until the 23rd October, 1981. The order sought to be revised is"
"dated 6.3.81 and in view of the inordinate delay of over seven months to file"
"the application for revision No. 1265/81, it must be dismissed'."
