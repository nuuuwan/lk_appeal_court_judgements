"'The respondents have not been in any manner prejudiced by the fact that"
"the  appellant  in  applying  for  the  typed-written  copy  paid  only  Rs.  20/-"
"instead of Rs. 25/-. Nonetheless we have in mind that the hearing was, as"
"a matter of indulgence, by way of revision. In the ultimate result we have"
"the satisfaction of knowing that we have interfered with the judgment of the"
"Learned District Judge substantially on a point of law only'."
