"Coming back to the facts of the case, although the plaintiff respondent has stated"
"in  its  Statement  of  Objections,  that,  the  defendant  signing  a  proxy  while  in"
"remand custody shows, that, he could have given instructions to his lawyer to"
"file papers to obtain leave to appear, this Court is of the view, that, whereas a"
"proxy  could  be  send  to  the  remand  prison  for  the  signature,  it  is  not  only  a"
"difficult thing but an almost impossible thing to obtain meaningful instructions"
"while the defendant was in the remand custody."
"Therefore the defendant had a valid reason to move for time on 14.09.2023."
"Now the section 11(2) says,"
"“(2)  The  Court  shall  not  grant  the  defendant  any  further  time  to  make  an"
"application  to  enable  the  defendant  to  seek  leave  to  appear  and  show  cause"
"against such decree nisi”."
"This was the main reason which led to the learned Additional District Judge to"
"refuse to grant time. Whereas she is not at fault on the face of the section, under"
"the powers of revision and restitutio in integrum this Court can consider whether"
"the Legislature intended the abrogation of the Rules of Natural Justice, in that,"
"the Rule “Audi Alteram Partem” in enacting the above provision."
"On the basis of the references to the “RULE OF LAW” and “INDEPENDENCE OF"
"JUDICIARY” in capital letters in the Preamble to the Constitution of 1978, this"
"Court is of the view that the Parliament will not intend and therefore a legislation"
"would  not  be  interpreted  to  shut  out  a  party  from  legal  proceedings  pending"
"against him when he has a valid and reasonable reason to move for further time."
