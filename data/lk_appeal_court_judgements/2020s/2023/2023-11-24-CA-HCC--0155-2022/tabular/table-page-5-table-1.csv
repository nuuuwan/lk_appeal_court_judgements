"CA/HCC/0155/22"
"In the indictment filed by the prosecution, it had only referred to the act of"
"fingering into the vagina of the victim by the Appellant. But when the victim"
"giving evidence before the High Court, she restricted her evidence to the act"
"of  licking  her  vagina  by  the  Appellant  only.  Hence,  immediately  after  the"
"conclusion  of  victim’s  evidence, 
the  Learned  State  Counsel  with 
the"
"permission of the Court amended the indictment from  the  act fingering to"
"licking of her vagina. As such, the indictment was read to the Appellant again"
"after the amendment. Although an opportunity was awarded to the Appellant"
"to  cross  examine  the  victim  over  the  amendment  to  the  indictment,  the"
"Learned Counsel for the defence had waived that opportunity. (Page 159 of"
"the brief)"
"The  basic  foundation  in  a  criminal  trial  is  the  charge.  By  charging,  an"
"accused  is  provided  information  as  to  the  nature  of  the  allegation  levelled"
"against him. The charge must identify the act committed by the accused, the"
"law alleged to have been violated by him and particulars pertaining to the"
"alleged offence must be specified in the charge."
"It is the profound duty of a prosecutor to  frame the charge/s after careful"
"consideration  of  evidence  available  in  the  case  at  the  time  of  drafting  the"
"charge. The requirements of a valid charge are set out in Sections 164 and"
"165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979."
"In  the 
first  ground  the  Learned  President’s  Counsel 
for  the  Appellant"
"contended  that  the  date  of 
incident  has  not  been  established  by  the"
"prosecution."
"In the indictment the date of offence mentioned as “between 01st April 2018"
"and  30th  April  2018”.  The  victim  giving  evidence  had  clearly  said  that  the"
"incident had taken place during the April school vacation of the year 2018."
"As per the Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979,"
"the  Appellant  had  been  given  reasonable  notice  the  time  of  incident.  For"
"clarity the Section 165 of CPC is re-produced below:"
