"B. Sasi Mahendran, J."
"The present application, which is the result of a prolonged legal battle stemming"
"from  the  ineptitude  of  the  State  officials  concerned,  is  a  complete  waste  of  time  and"
"resources and serves as an example of the type of conduct that cannot be tolerated; it is"
"not  the  conduct  of  diligent,  conscientious  State  officials,  entrusted  with  powers  and"
"functions 
in  the  expectation  that  they  would  exercise  those  powers  and 
functions"
"diligently  and 
conscientiously. 
  The  Respondent  authorities  have  also  displayed"
"contemptuous conduct by their utter disregard for  Court orders. This contemptible and"
"frankly appalling conduct will be elaborated on in the course of this judgment."
"The Petitioners who are siblings, are before this Court seeking, inter alia, a Writ"
"of Mandamus to compel the 6th Respondent (the District Secretary, Hambantota) to rectify"
"the error in the permit (bearing No. 17343 dated 29th June 1949 - “X2”) issued to their late"
"father, namely one Kadimachcharige Jandiris (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “the"
"permit holder”) under the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935, as amended. This"
"error was discovered only when a commission was re-issued by the District Court in 2018,"
"more  than  seventy  years  after  the  permit  was  issued,  to  determine  the  quantum  of"
"compensation payable to the 1st to 4th Respondents for the developments they had done"
"on that land. The error is that the particular Lot number referred to in the permit (Lot 38"
"in Final Village Plan No. 636) is in fact a roadway and not the allotment of land that was"
"alienated to the Petitioners’ father. A mistake that managed to stay hidden over the years,"
"despite,  as  explained  below,  the land  having been  assessed  on  a  commission issued  by"
"Court prior to its re-issuance in 2018. The Petitioners made this application to compel the"
"relevant  Respondent  authorities  to  rectify  this  error  in  the  permit  by  identifying  the"
"actual land referred to in the Schedule of the permit, with its definitive boundaries, and"
"to compel the registration of the 1st Petitioner (eldest son of the permit holder) as successor"
"to that land, under his late father’s permit."
"The background of this application in its chronological order, as narrated in the"
"Petition, is as follows."
"A dispute involving the Petitioners’ father, the 1st Respondent, and three others"
"resulted in the Police instituting an action in the Magistrate’s Court of Tissamaharama"
"in 1980  (Cases bearing No. 518 and  519).  At  the  behest  of  the learned  Magistrate,  the"
"parties agreed to a settlement whereby the 1st Respondent was entitled to occupy the land"
"(the corpus alienated under the permit) for a period of two and a half years, to set off a"
"debt  of  Rs.  4000/-  the  Petitioners’  father  owed  the  1st  Respondent.  The  1st  Respondent"
