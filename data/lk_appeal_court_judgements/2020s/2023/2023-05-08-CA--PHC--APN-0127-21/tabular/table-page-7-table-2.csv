"section 422 (4) of the CPC. It appears that the learned Magistrate was too"
"quick in sentencing the appellants.”"
"It is my considered view that although the above-considered case was in relation"
"to  a  Magistrate  Court  order,  the  applicable  provision  in  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure Act is the same. I find that although the  learned High Court Judge"
"has correctly followed the procedural steps as mentioned in section 422(1) of the"
"Code, the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when it was ordered that"
"in  default  of  paying  the  sum  mentioned  in  the  bail  bond,  the  petitioner  shall"
"serve a prison term of two years."
"As  considered  above,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  should  have  ordered  the"
"attachment  and  sale  as  provided  for  in  section  422(2)  and  if  it  fails  only,  the"
"provisions of section 422(4) should have been applied. There again, the penalty"
"should  have  been  for  a  simple  imprisonment  term  which  may  extend  up  to  6"
"months and not as ordered by the learned High Court Judge."
"Under the circumstances, this Court has no option but to set aside the learned"
"High  Court  Judge’s  order  up  to  the  extent  of  vacating  the  order  where  it  was"
"stated that the forfeited amount should be recovered as a fine and in default, the"
"petitioner shall serve a two-year prison term."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  is  directed  to  follow  the  provisions  of  section"
"422(2)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  in  order  to  recover  the  forfeited"
"amount and to act under section 422(4) only if the amount cannot be recovered"
"in terms of section 422(2)."
