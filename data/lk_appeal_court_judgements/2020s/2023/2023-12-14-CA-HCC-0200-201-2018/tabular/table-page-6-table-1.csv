"In Mohmood v Western Australia [2008] 232 CLR 397 the Court held that:"
"“…where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to"
"give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question"
"is  not  whether  the  jury  may  properly  each  conclusion  about  issues  of"
"fact  but  whether,  in  the  circumstances,  they  should  be  entertain  a"
"reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused”."
