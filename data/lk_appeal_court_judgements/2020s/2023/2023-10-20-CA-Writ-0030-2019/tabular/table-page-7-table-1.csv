"In the case of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferiee &J"
"Jafferjee  (Pvt)  Ltd12  (S.C.)  His Lordship J. A. N. de Silva (as his Lordship"
"then  was)  in  setting  out  some  of  the  conditions  precedent  to  the  issue  of"
"mandamus,  it  was  held  that  the  applicant  must  have  a  legal  right  to  the"
"performance of the legal duty by the parties against whom the mandamus is"
"sought13.  Accordingly, the foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal"
"right14."
"As  a  result,  based  on  the  above  analysis,  I  am  clearly  of  the  view  that  the"
"Petitioner has failed to establish the existence of  a legal right towards him."
"Consequently, the performance of the legal duty by the Respondents towards"
"the Petitioner does not arise."
"Conclusion"
"In view of the reasoning provided above in this judgement in respect of the"
"matter  in  issue,  I  hold  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  legitimate"
"grounds to issue the writs prayed for in the Petition. Therefore, I refused to"
"issue the writ of mandamus prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer of the"
"Petition, and consequently, the writ of prohibition prayed for in paragraph (c)"
"of the prayer of the Petition as well."
"I  would  hold  that  the  Petitioner's  application  must  fail.  Consequently,  the"
"application is dismissed. No costs."
