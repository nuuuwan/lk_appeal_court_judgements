"Petitioner  made  a  claim  to  the  two  lands  after  the  demise  of  Podihamine7."
"However, the Petitioner  states that  there was no favourable response to his"
"request from the Respondents."
"When the matter remains as such the Petitioner has become aware that there"
"is a move to transfer the ownership of the two lands to the 3rd Respondent who"
"is a brother of deceased Subasingha. It is also stated that the 3rd Respondent"
"made several attempts to forcibly enter into the two lands and to dispossess"
"the Petitioner."
"The Petitioner alleges that the 1st and 2nd Respondents ignored the Petitioner’s"
"request and deliberately delayed registering the Petitioner as the lawful owner"
"of the two lands while making attempts to transfer the lands in the name of"
"the 3rd  Respondent on  the  basis that  the 3rd  Respondent inherited  the  same"
"under  the  LDO.  The  Petitioner  claims  that  the  nomination  made  by  late"
"Subasingha is still in force and therefore, the 3rd Respondent is not entitled to"
"succeed under the LDO. The Petitioner has also demanded the 2nd Respondent"
"to register him as the lawful owner of the two lands by the letter of demand"
"dated 10th October 2018 marked (‘P 13’)."
"Accordingly, the Petitioner states that the aforementioned acts and/or failures"
"of the  1st  and 2nd  Respondents  to  register  the name of the  Petitioner  as  the"
"lawful owner of the two lands are illegal, unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, ultra-"
"vires, violative of the principles of natural justice and contrary to the principles"
"of reasonableness. Thus, the Petitioner prays for the writs mentioned earlier"
"in this judgment."
"Analysis"
"Admittedly, Bamunusingha Arachchilage Subasingha was issued with the two"
"Grants ‘P 1’ and ‘P 2’ in the year 1995. Kariyawasam Wickremarachchilage"
"Podihamine was the lawful wife of Subasingha (‘P 8(c)’). According to the"
"Petitioner,  Subasingha  and  Podihamine  adopted  the  Petitioner as  their  own"
"son.  However,  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  challenged  the  legality  of  the"
"adoption. There is no material before the Court to establish that the Petitioner"
"was  legally  adopted.  The  biological  father  of  the  Petitioner  (‘P  8(a)’)  is"
"Kariyawasam Wickremarachchilage Gunarathne. Gunarathne is a brother of"
"Podihamine. Therefore, the relationship between Subasingha and Petitioner is"
"uncle and nephew. The Petitioner applied to succeed to the land on the ground"
