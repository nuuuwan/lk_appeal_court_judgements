"The petitioner has come before this Court seeking to challenge the above order"
"of the learned High Court Judge by way of a revision application on the basis"
"that the procedure followed by the learned High Court Judge after deciding to"
"forfeit the bail bond was not according to the law, and hence, it amounts to an"
"illegal order."
"In other words, the petitioner has not challenged the decision to forfeit his bail"
"bond, but the recovery procedure the learned High Court Judge has decided to"
"follow in the above-mentioned order."
"For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce in its entirety, the relevant section"
"422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which provides for the procedure on"
"forfeiture of bonds."
