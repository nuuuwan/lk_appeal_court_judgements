"United Kingdom. As such, the revision application filed by the 2nd Party-Respondent"
"had been heard ex-parte by the learned High Court Judge who had made an Order"
"in favour of 2nd Party-Respondent setting aside the Order of the Primary Court. By"
"the said Order, the learned High Court Judge had restored the 2nd Party-Respondent"
"to the possession of the disputed property."
"It was contended by the 2nd Party-Respondent that 1st Party-Petitioner had not given"
"sufficient and acceptable reasons for the delay in filing this application in revision."
"It is imperative to note that summons in relation to the revision application filed in"
"the Provincial High Court of the Northern Province holden in Jaffna was not served"
"on the 1st Party-Petitioner to her address in the United Kingdom and this was not"
"disputed by the 2nd Party-Respondent. Therefore, the 1st Party-Petitioner could not"
"have preferred an appeal within the prescribed period."
"Moreover, the 1st Party-Petitioner had given reasons and substantiated the delay in"
"filing the instant revision application to this Court."
"It is observable that the 1st Party-Petitioner had not preferred an appeal against the"

"and in the corresponding affidavit that the said Order was not served on  her. This"
"was not disputed by the 2nd Party-Respondent. Therefore, it is apparent that the 1st"
"Party-Petitioner could not have preferred an appeal within the prescribed period."
"The  1st  Party-Petitioner  had  given  reasons  to  substantiate  the  delay  in  filing  the"
"instant  application  to  this  Court.  Since  we  hold  that  the  impugned  Order  of  the"
"learned High Court Judge is erroneous, it is apparent that great injustice has been"
"caused  to  the  1st  Party-Petitioner  which amounts to a  miscarriage  of justice  that"
"shocks the conscience of Court. Although there was a delay in making the revision"
"application, the 1st Party-Petitioner is entitled to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction"
"of  the  Court  of  Appeal  against  the  Order  of  the  High  Court  as  exceptional"
"circumstances exist."
"The  1st  Party-Petitioner  has  proved  that  the  impugned  property  was  under  her"
"control and in her possession from the date she was given it as dowry and that she"
