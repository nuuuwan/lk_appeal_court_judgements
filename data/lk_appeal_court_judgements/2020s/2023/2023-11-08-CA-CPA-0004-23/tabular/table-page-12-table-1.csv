"Under the circumstances, I am of the view that this is a fit and proper case where"
"the  discretionary  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  should  be  exercised  in"
"order to prevent a miscarriage of justice."
"Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 16-12-2022 pronounced by the learned"
"High Court Judge of Kegalle and the order dated 28-09-2020 pronounced by the"
"learned Magistrate of Warakapola, as both the orders cannot be allowed to stand."
"I direct that the vehicle numbered 226-4461 shall be released to the petitioner"
"forthwith."
"The  Registrar  of  the  Court  is  directed  to  communicate  this  judgement  to  the"
"Magistrateâ€™s Court of Warakapola for necessary compliance, and to the Provincial"
"High  Court  of  the  Sabaragamuwa  Province  Holden  in  Kegalle  for  necessary"
"information."
