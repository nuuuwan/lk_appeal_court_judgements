"","Now, money spend in creating or acquiring an income- producing concern"
"","must be capital expenditure. It is invested to yield future profit; and while"
"","the  outlay  does  not  recur  the  income  does.  There  is  a  great  different"
"","between money spent in creating or acquiring a source of profit, and"
"","money spent in working it. The one is capital expenditure, the other is"
"","not. The reason is plain; in the one case it is spent to enable the concern"
