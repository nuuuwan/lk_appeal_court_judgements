"and Investment Co. was allowed and I think rightly allowed, to be deducted"
"from profits. But when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all,"
"but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the"
"enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the"
"absence  of  special  circumstances  leading  to  an  opposite  conclusion)  for"
"treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but"
"to  capital.  For  this  view  there  is  already  considerable  authority.  Thus,"
"moneys expended by a brewing firm with a view to the acquisition of new"
"licensed  premises,  Southwell  vs.  Savill  Brothers; 
“flitting  expenses”"
"incurred 
in  transferring  a  manufacturing  business  to  new  premises,"
"Granite Supply Association vs. Kitton; costs incurred in promoting a Bill"
"which was dropped on the desired facilities being obtained by agreement,"
"A. G. Moore & Co. vs. Hare; and expenditure incurred by a ship building"
"firm in deepening a channel and creating a deep water berth (not on their"
"own  property)  to  enable  vessels  constructed  by  them  to  put  out  to  sea,"
"Ounsworth vs. Vickers, Ltd., have been held to be in the nature of capital"
"expenditure  and  not  to  be  deductible  under  the  Income  Tax  Acts;  and"
"Rowntree & Co. vs. Curtis is to the same effect. I think that the principle"
"to be deduced from this series of authorities rests on sound foundations"
"and may properly be adopted by this House”."
"“With regard to that judgment of Lord CAVE, the remarks of ROMER, L.J.,"
"in the case of Anglo Persian Oil Co. vs. Dale (1932, 1 K. B. D. 124 at p."
"145) are of sufficient importance to be repeated here. After referring to the"
"lack of certainty as to permissible deductions furnished by the terms of"
"the Act and to numerous and not easily reconcilable tests suggested by"
"the Judges in past cases, he continued:"
"“At  the  end  of  the  year  1925,  however,  all  these  authorities  were"
"considered by the House of Lords in British Insulated & Helsby Cables vs."
"Atherton  and  the  law  applicable  to  such  cases  at  the  present  was,  as  it"
