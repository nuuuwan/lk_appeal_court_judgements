"","“A little reflection will show that two questions arise (a) whether the act"
"","to  which  the  expenditure  is  attached  is  performed  in  the  production  of"
"","income and (b) whether the expenditure is linked to it closely enough. Now"
"","at first sight it would appear that only acts necessary to earn the income"

"","“As pointed out above businesses are conducted by different persons in"

"","looked  to.  If  it  is  performed  for  the  purpose  of  earning  income  then  the"
"","expenditure attendant upon it is deductible.  This is illustrated by cases"
"","such as Commissioner for Inland Revenue v. Thompson (1935, T.P.D. 166,"
"","see particularly p.171) and Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery v. Bruce (1915,A.C."
