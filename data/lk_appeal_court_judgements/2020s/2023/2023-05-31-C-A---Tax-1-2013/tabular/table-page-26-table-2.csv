"contained  in  section  18(1)(a)  of  that  particular  statute  and  not"

"producing  the  gross  income”  only  applicable  to  the  word"
"“expenses” and not to “outgoings”. This exactly was what His"
"Lordship  the  Chief  Justice  Basnayake  decided  in  categorizing"
"“outgoings” as one and “expenses incurred by the assessee in the"
"production of the profits or income” as two."
