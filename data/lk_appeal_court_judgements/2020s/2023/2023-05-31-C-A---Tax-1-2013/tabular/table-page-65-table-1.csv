"","""The effect of the word 'exclusively' is to preclude a deduction if it appears"

"","Ltd 1987(3) SA 453(A) this Court adopted the analysis of ROMER LJ in"

"","of expenditure and its effect as outlined in LORD BRIGHTMAN's speech"
"","in Mallalieu's  case.  Applying  the  principles  thus  enunciated,  this"
"","Court  held  that  the  taxpayer  who  had  made  a  large  charitable"
"","donation  which 
it  sought 
to  deduct 
from 
its 
income  as  an"

"","it did not have a dual purpose, namely a philanthropic as well as a"
"","business  purpose;  the  deduction  was  therefore  disqualified  by  the"
"","provisions of sec 23(g). [The emphasis was added in this judgment]"
