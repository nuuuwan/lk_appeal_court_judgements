"disallowed by the Commissioner on the basis that the expense had not"
"been incurred in the production of the taxpayer’s income. In effect, the"
"expenses were incurred at the behest of the American holding company"
"and  therefore,  could  never  actually produce  income. On appeal to the"
"Supreme Court of Appeal, Conradie JA (the other four judges concurred with"
"his  judgment)  found  a  link,  which  was  not  regarded  as  too  remote,"
"between  the  continued  trade  of  the  taxpayer  and  the  expenditure  at  the"
"behest of its holding company”."
"(25)  In  Solaglass Finance Limited vs. Commissioner for Inland Revenue, 1991"
"(2)  SA  257,  53  S.  A.  T.  C.  1,  the  facts  were  similar  to  the  present  case."
"Goldswain and Swart says about this case,"
"“See  also  Solarglass  Finance  Limited  v  CIR  where  a  similar  decision  was"
"given in regard to loans made by a subsidiary company to other companies"
"in the group at the behest of its holding company”."
"This  judgment  is  important,  not  only  to  define  the  term,  “incurred  in  the"
"production  of  income”,  but  also  to  the  argument  of  the  expenses  being"
"“capital in nature”, which was taken up by the TAC, albeit without notice to"
"the appellant and hence the respondent cannot rely upon, on the basis of"
"the violation of the rule audi alteram partem, which is addressed in the next"
"section of this judgment, but adverted to here, to err on the side of caution."
"(26)  Like  in  the  present  case,  there  was  a  Holding  company  and  subsidiary"
"companies. One such company was acting as the “Financier” of the group."
"The matter arose due to loans given. But the question was not in respect of"
"interest payments. It was regarding losses caused due to the non payment"
"of certain loans."
"A.  S.  Botha  J,  wrote  the  leading  judgment,  Nicholas  and  Nienaber  JJ.,"
