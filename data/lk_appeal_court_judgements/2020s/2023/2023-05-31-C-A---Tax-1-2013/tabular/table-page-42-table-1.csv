"","necessarily  leads  to  accidents  in  which  third  parties  are  injured  and  in"
"","respect  of  which  appellant  has  to  pay  damages,  consequently  such"
"","damages are a deductible expenditure.  It is possible that this argument"
"","can be refuted upon more grounds than one, but I shall only mention the"
"","following  one:  there 
is  nothing 
in  the  stated  case  to  show  that  the"
"","appellant’s  method  of  conducting  his  business  necessarily 
leads 
to"
"","accidents 
and 
it  would 
be 
somewhat 
surprising 
if 
there  were."
"","Consequently,  the  basis  of  Mr.  Rosenberg’s  argument  disappears  and  it"
"","cannot be supported”."
"","“Mr.  Rosenberg’s  next  contention  was  that,  if  the  damages  were  not"
"","deductible, as an expenditure, they were deductible as a loss. The word"
"","“loss”  has  several  meanings  and 
its  meaning 
in  section  11(2)(a) 
is"
"","somewhat obscure. In relation to trading operations the word is sometimes"
"","used to signify a deprivation suffered by the loser, usually an involuntary"
"","deprivation, whereas expenditure usually means a voluntary payment of"
"","money. When trading operations cause damage to third parties and this"
"","damage  has  to  be  made  good,  then  the  payment  which  is  made  in"
"","satisfaction of such damage (and possibly even the pre existing liability to"
"","make such payment) may properly be called a loss, but when the payment"
"","has  been  made  then 
it  can  also  properly  be  called  an  expenditure."
"","Consequently, it is not clear to me that the word “losses”, if used in this"
"","sense 
in  section  11(2)  of 
the  Act,  means  anything  different 
from"
"","“expenditure”. The word “loss” is also sometimes used as the antonym of"
"","“profit”, but then it denotes the final result of a trading operation after the"
"","expenditure has been deducted and it seems inappropriate to speak of a"
"","loss, in that sense, in conjunction with expenditure, as something which"
"","is  incurred  in  the  production  of  income.  If  any  income  at  all  (i.e.,  any"
"","return) is produced by a trading operation, then clearly the expenditure"
"","and the loss, in that sense, cannot both be deducted from the income in"
"","order  to  arrive  at  taxable 
income,  because 
it  would  entail  a  double"
