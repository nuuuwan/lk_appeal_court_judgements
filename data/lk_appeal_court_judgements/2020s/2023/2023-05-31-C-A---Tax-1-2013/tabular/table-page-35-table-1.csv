"For instance, in Hancock vs. General Reversionary and Investment Co. Ltd.,"
"(1919, 1 K. B. 25) it was held that the payment of a lump sum, the value"
"of an annuity, to a servant on his retirement from service was a deductible"
"expense. By analogy payments under the Workmen’s Compensation Act"
"are sometimes periodical payments and are made in respect of incapacity"
"by injury, whereas a pension is usually paid on account of incapacity by"
"reason of age. In principle it is difficult to see any distinction. (page 248)"
"For these reasons I am of opinion that the amount paid as compensation"
"under  the  Workman’s  Compensation  Act  to  the  widow  of  the  driver  are"
"deductible under section 11(2) of the Income Tax Act of 1925”. (page 248)"
