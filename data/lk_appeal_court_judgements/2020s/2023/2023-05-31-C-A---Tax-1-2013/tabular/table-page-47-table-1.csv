"An accident is such and an interest payment of a loan obtained is also similar."
"The writers state,"
"“Furthermore,  by  2003 
the 
judiciary,  unlike  SARS, 
[South  African"
"Revenue Services]  appeared to have recognised the absurdity of some of"
"its  previous  decisions  and  had  subtly  begun  to  widen  the  ambit  of  the"
"phrase to take into account the economic, social, statutory and even the"
"requirements  of 
its  shareholders  and  other  stakeholders 
that  have"
"emerged over the past 40 years or so”."
"Scribante Case:-"
"They  cite,  Commissioner 
for  South  African  Revenue  Services  vs.  Scribante"
"Construction (Pty) Ltd., 2001 (2) SA 601(E). 62 S. A. T. C. 443."
"“C:SARS  v  Scribante  Construction  (Pty)  Ltd  is  a  useful  guide  as  to  the"
"judicial  meaning  of  the  phrase  “in  the  production  of  the  income”  in  a"
"situation when a dividend declared to a shareholder is converted to a loan"
"account on which interest is payable. Half of the dividend declared by the"
"company was credited to the shareholder’s account as an interest-bearing"
"loan. The other half was credited to the same account as an interest free"
"loan.  On  appeal  against  the  Commissioner’s  decision  not  to  allow  the"
"deduction for the interest incurred on the interest bearing portion of the"
"loan account, the court held that the purpose of the loan to the company"
"by its shareholders was to further enhance the already healthy position of"
"the taxpayer. In addition, the company’s financial profile improved. This"
"enabled it to obtain future business and earn interest for the taxpayer. The"
"loan  in  issue  had,  therefore,  produced  income  to  the  advantage  of  the"
"company and the interest incurred was held to be “in the production of the"
"income” and thus deductible in the determination of its taxable income”."
