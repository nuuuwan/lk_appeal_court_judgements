"deduction of so much of the expenditure as is a loss. A trading operation"
"may, however, sometimes produce no income at all. In such a case a loss"
"is incurred in attempting to produce income and not “in the production of"
"income”. Such a loss would, however, be deductible from income earned"
"by the taxpayer in other trading operations and it may be that the word"
"“losses”  was  inserted  in  section  11(2)(a)  in  order  to  sanction  such  a"
"deduction. If the taxpayer earned no other income his loss could probably"
"be set off in future years as an “assessed loss” in terms of section 11(3)”."
