"section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, Gunawardena J. in the case of"
"Iqbal Vs Majedudeen and Others (1999) 3 SLR 213 has held as follows,"
"“The test for determining whether a person is in possession of any corporeal"
"thing, such as a house, is to ascertain whether he is in general control of it.”"
"Gunawardena  J.  has  further  observed  as  follows,  “Salmond  observes  that  a"
"person  could  be  said  to  be  in  possession  of,  say,  a  house,  even  though  that"
"person is miles away and able to exercise very little control, if any.”"
"If you use the premises for a business purpose or to provide a service to the"
"people, that is deemed to be possession and that is sufficient to establish one’s"
"possession  to  that  premises 
if  that  person  had  the  general  control  of  the"
"premises.  Therefore, 
just  because  the  2nd  party  had  rented  out  a  house"
"elsewhere  one  cannot  come 
to 
the  conclusion 
that 
they  have  given  up"
"possession in the premises in suit."
"The learned Magistrate had taken into consideration the Grama Seva Reports"
"dated 15.02.2014 as a factor establishing the possession of the 2nd party. The"
"learned High Court Judge has observed that there is no reference to the months"
"of January, November and December 2013 in those reports. Those Grama Seva"

"that both the 1st and 2nd Respondents of the 2nd party are residing in the address"
"of the premises in dispute. In 2 ව 3 it has been reported that the 1st Respondent"
"in the 2nd party is residing for a period of 10 years within the Grama Niladhari"
"division. In 2 ව 5 it has been reported that the 2nd Respondent in the 2nd party is"
"residing  within  that  Grama  Niladhari  division  since  her  birth.  In  reply  to  the"
"averments  contained  in  paragraph  11  of  the  affidavit  of  the  2nd  party  where"
"there is a reference to the aforementioned Grama Niladhari certificates, the 1st"
"party in his cross affidavit had only stated that the 2nd party in their application"
"to the Debt Conciliation Board had given the address of their new residence as"
"their address. The 1st party had not stated that, during the relevant period the"
"2nd party resided elsewhere within that same Grama Niladhari division. As the"
"Grama Niladhari had reported that 1st Respondent of the 2nd party is residing"
"within  that  Grama  Niladhari  division  for  a  period  of  10  years  and  the  2nd"
"Respondent of the 2nd party is residing within that Grama Niladhari division since"
"the date of her birth and as the Grama Niladhari had reported that both of them"
