"Magistrate had to decide was whether the 1st party was dispossessed within a"
"period  of  two  months 
immediately  prior  to  the  date  of  the  filing  of  the"
"information.  The 
learned  Additional  Magistrate  had  refused  to  accept  the"
"version of the 1st party that there had been a dispossession. He had come to the"
"conclusion that on the date of the filing of the information by the Police â€“ on"
"22.01.2014, the 2nd party and the intervenient party had been in possession and"
"handed over the possession to them."
"According to the complaint the 1st party had made to the Police on 13.01.2014"
"the dispossession had taken place in December 2013. But in his affidavit to the"
"court, 
the  1st  party  had  contradicted 
this  position  and  stated 
that 
the"
"dispossession  took  place  towards  the  end  of  November  2013  and  he  was  in"
"possession up to 22.11.2013. The agent and the caretaker of the 1st party one"
"Nilame 
in  his  statement 
to 
the  Police  had  stated 
that 
the 
incident  of"
"dispossession  occurred  towards  the  end  of  October  2013.  This  statement  is"
"contradictory  to  the  statement  the  1st  party  had  made  to  the  Police  on"
"13.01.2014 and also to the statement that the 1st party had made in his affidavit."
"The  date  of  dispossession  the  1st  party  had  mentioned  in  his  affidavit  is  also"
"contradictory to the date of dispossession the 1st party had mentioned in his"
"complaint to the Police. Therefore, the evidence placed before the court by the"
"1st  party  is  inconsistent  per  se  and  also  inconsistent  inter  se  and  the  learned"
"Magistrate  could  not  have  placed  reliance  on  that  evidence  on  this  material"
"point. In his affidavit the 1st party had stated that he made a complaint to the"
"police  on  22.11.2013  informing  that  the  second  party  had  entered  in  to  the"
"premises. He had further stated that on that day the second party entered into"
"the premises unlawfully and dispossessed the 1st party. However, the 1st party"
"had failed to tender a certified copy of that complaint to court. If the 1st party"
"was dispossessed on that day and he made a complaint to the police on that day"
"regarding dispossession there is no reason why the 1st party could not furnish a"
"certified copy of that complaint to court to show that he was dispossessed on"
"that day. But the 1st party had failed to do so. Therefore, the court can presume"
"under 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance that the evidence that could be and is"
"not  produced  would  be  unfavourable  to  the  person  who  withholds  it.  In  his"
"complaint to the police on 13.01.2014 the 1st party had never mentioned that"
"he had made a complaint earlier on 22.11.2013 regarding dispossession. If the"
"1st party had made a complaint on 22.11.2013 and informed police that he was"
"dispossessed there is no reason why the police should not have filed information"
"under 
section 
66(1) 
of 
the 
Primary 
Courts, 
Procedure  Act
