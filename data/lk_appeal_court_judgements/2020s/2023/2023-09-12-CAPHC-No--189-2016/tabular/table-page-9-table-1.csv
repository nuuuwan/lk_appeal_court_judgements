"conclusion that the 2nd party was in occupation of the premises in dispute during"
"the relevant period. The Grama Niladhari of the area is an official witness and"
"an impartial witness who has no interest in this case and what he has stated in"
"his reports regarding the residence of parties living within his division cannot be"
"brushed  aside 
lightly.  On  the  other  hand,  the  statements  made  by  Sarath"
"Muditha, Chaminda Pushpakumara, Nilame, Chandrasena etc. in favour of the"
"1st party are not statements made in any official capacity and one cannot say"
"that they are independent witnesses. Therefore, much weight cannot be given"
"to the statements made by those witnesses."
"In deciding the case in favour of the 1st party the learned High Court Judge had"
"observed the fact that in the electricity bill of the premises in dispute for the"
"month  of  September  –  October  marked  පැ25  the  meter  reading  was  0."
"Therefore, the learned High Court Judge has come to the conclusion that there"
"had been no consumption of electricity in the house during the relevant period."
"Based on that finding the learned High Court Judge has come to the conclusion"
"that  the  2nd  party  had  given  up  possession  and  vacated  the  premises. 
In"
"examining  the  water  bills  of  the  premises,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"observed the fact that although there had been a consumption of 13 units in"
"August  and  11  units  in  September  it  had  dropped  to  6  units  in  November."
"Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had come to the conclusion that no one"
"had been in occupation of the premises on the 15th of November."
"According to the water bill marked 2 ව 11 there had been a consumption of 9"
"units of water in the premises. In comparison to the consumption of 13 units in"
"August and 11 units in September, it is not a significant decline. The fact that"
"there had been a consumption of 9 units in November shows that someone had"
"been  in  occupation  of  this  premises  and  he  had  used  water.  Therefore,  one"
"cannot come to the finding that no one had been in occupation of the premises"
"on 15th November. Although there is a 0-meter reading in electricity during the"
"period  of  15th  September  -  16th  October  (In  පැ25)  one  cannot  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the 2nd party was not in possession of this premises during the"
"relevant  period.  The  period  relevant  to  this  case 
is  the  period  between"
"22.11.2013 – 22.01.2014. පැ25 is an electricity bill issued prior to that period. In"
"any event, if the 2nd party was residing in their new rented-out house and only"
"using this premises for medical treatment during day time, they may not have"
"used  electricity  at  all.  But 
it 
is 
important  to  note  that  there  had  been  a"
"consumption  of  11  units  of  water  during  this  period  which  means  that  this"
"premises  was  occupied  by  someone.  On  the  other  hand,  the  electricity  bill"
