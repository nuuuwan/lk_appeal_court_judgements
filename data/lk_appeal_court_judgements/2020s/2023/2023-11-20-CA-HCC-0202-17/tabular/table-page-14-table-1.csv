"I am unable to find any evidence in the appeal under consideration to determine"
"as  such,  other  than,  if  the  version  of  events  as  stated  by  the  prosecution"
"witnesses are to be believed, that the appellant engaged in offering the services"
"of females as  prostitutes by accepting money."
"As  considered  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  such  evidence  is  insufficient  to"
"establish a charge in terms of section 360A(1) of the Penal code."
"Accordingly,  I  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  of  the  appellant  as  it"
"cannot be allowed to stand, and acquit her of the charge preferred."
"Appeal allowed."
