"After having considered the relevant decisions and the legislative provisions, it"
"has been determined that;"
"“In order to establish the offence of procuration it must be proved that the"
"person  procured  was  not  a  prostitute  before  the  alleged  procuration.  The"
"burden is on the prosecution to establish that fact beyond reasonable doubt,"
"the  degree  of  proof  required  in  criminal  cases,  which  is  an  evidentiary"
"burden.  I  do  not  think  that  one  could  say  that  there  is  a  legal  burden  to"
"establish that fact by placing the testimony of the person procured before"
"the  Court.  This  Court  also  appreciates  the  challenge  the  prosecution  may"
"face  in  discharging  its  burden  in  instances  where  a  person may  fairly  be"
"said to be living in whole or in part on the earnings of prostitution, that is to"
"say  when  there  is  parasitic  relationship  between  the  prostitute  and  ‘the"
"tout,’ ‘the bully,’ ‘protector’ or the ‘pimp’ as one may call the other.”"
