"decision of the Inquirer is in full effect, and stands until the verdict of the"
"appeal in derived. One cannot say that the original decision is invalid on"
"the mere basis of a pending appeal that has been preferred."
"Thus, in the instant Application, it is clear for the reasons set out above,"
"the  original  decision  of  the  Inquirer  and  the  punishments  derived  from"
"such a decision does not go into abeyance on the mere basis that an appeal"
"has been preferred by the Petitioner. The punishment of a restriction on"
"promotions for a period of 5 years as per the Disciplinary Code is still in"
"force.  On  that  basis,  the  decision  of  not  calling  the  Petitioner  for  the"
"interview is justifiable on the part of the Respondent Board."
"On the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the Application without cost."
"No cost."
"Application dismissed."
