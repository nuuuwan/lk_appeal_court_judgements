"According to the evidence of Kalyani Katunga who had been in the deceased house and"
"who is the sister of the previous witness had seen the tall man stabbing the deceased and"
"she had identified him in the parade and in the dock."
"The other assailant had been near the cycle when she had come out of the house after"
"seeing the stabbing of the deceased."
"It had been suggested to her in cross examination that she is lying and furthermore that"
"she had failed to state to police that in the morning of the day of the incident she had seen"
"the short assailant going in front of their house in a suspicious manner."
"The brother of the deceased had informed the matter to the  police. The investigative"
"officers had given evidence and upon the conclusion of the case for the prosecution the"
"defense had been called and both the appellants had made statements from the dock in"
"which they had pleaded ignorance of the incident and had denied totally the identification"
"at the parade."
"The trial judge in her evaluation of the evidence had basically reproduced the evidence led"
"by the prosecution and had said that she relies on the evidence of the identification parade"
"in spite of the absence of the notes pertaining to the parade and had concluded that in the"
"light  of  the  cogent  evidence  led  by  the  prosecution the  defense had  not  placed an"
"acceptable version to Court and had moved to convict the appellants."
"But we  observe that to  arrive at  this decision she had sought corroboration from the"
"statements made to the police by the witnesses and furthermore had failed to consider"
"the omissions and the contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution."
"One  of  the  main  grounds  of  appeal  is  that  the  prosecution  failed  to  produce  the"
"identification parade notes as  evidence during the  trial. The  prosecution had led  the"
"evidence of the acting Magistrate who had conducted the raid but she had given evidence"
