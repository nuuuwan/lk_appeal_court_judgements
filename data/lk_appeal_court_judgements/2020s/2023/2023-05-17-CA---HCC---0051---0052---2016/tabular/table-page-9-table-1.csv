"The judgement further refers to the special conditions that may have prevailed at the time"
"of the identification which may have affected the identification which can have a bearing"
"on the dock identification."
"As such as mentioned above this  Court disregarded the evidence of the identification"
"parade for the reasons stated above  what this Court has to consider is whether the dock"
"identification of the witnesses is sufficient to prove the allegations levelled against the"
"appellants. But  as  already discussed above  the  mentally  daunting experience of  the"
"deceasedâ€™s wife had to undergo during the incident, that is having to witness her husband"
"being killed while having the security of her young children in mind and with the incident"
"taking place within a matter of a seconds makes it extremely unsafe to accept her evidence"
"against the appellants for the first time in the dock."
"The other witness is the sister of the deceased wife who had in fact had walked in to the"
"scene at the noise of the shooting also had identified the appellants for the first time in"
"the dock as the evidence of the parade has already been disregarded , also is unsafe to act"
"for the reasons sated above."
"Therefore, we observe that the learned trial judge had failed to consider all these aspects"
"but had decided that the prosecution had led very cogent evidence without observing the"
"above mentioned matters. Hence it would have been better if the trial judge had been"
"guided by law and facts rather than emotions and sympathy which we all like to practice"
"but not while on the bench."
"As such we allow the instant appeal and set aside the conviction and the sentence of the"
"appellants."
