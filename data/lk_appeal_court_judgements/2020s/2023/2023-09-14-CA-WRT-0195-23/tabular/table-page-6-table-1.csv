"The foregoing clause of P20 will cause material prejudice to the members"
"of the 1st Petitioner Union. In these respects, it appears to this Court that,"
"if  the  interim  Orders  are  not  issued,  prejudice  will  be  caused  to  those"
"employees."
"In these circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that this is"
"a  fit  and  proper  case  to  issue  notices  on  the  Respondents  and  to  grant"
"interim Orders until the final determination of this Application."
"Thus, the notices are issued on the Respondents and the Interim Orders"
"as prayed for in paragraphs (i), (m) and (n) of the prayers to the Petition"
"are issued until the final determination of this Application."
