"the fact that the petitioner’s 2nd application was made in respect of a resources"
"site  different  to  the  resources  site  identified  in  the  1st  application.  When  this"
"fact was brought in by the respondents in their objections, the petitioner failed"
"to  provide  a  clear  answer  as  to  whether  it  was  the  same  resource  site  or  a"
"different resource site."
"The petitioner in this application stated that it has taken various steps to start"
"an  Energy  Project,  to  obtain  approval  from  various  State  agencies  and  to  buy"
"some lands.  The petitioner wants to consider the above steps taken and claim"
"priority  to  the  petitioner  over  the  36th  respondent 
in  granting  provisional"
"approval  for  its  2nd  application.    However,  at  the  same  time  petitioner  argues"
"that  when  granting  provisional  approval,  priority  should  be  given 
to  an"
"applicant considering only the date of the application."
"The  1st  respondent  stated  that  it  was  found,  that  a  one-year  period  was  not"
"sufficient for most applicants to obtain necessary authorisations."
"In terms of the current guidelines an applicant who has not been able to obtain"

"(i) 
development

guidelines 
on 
renewable 
energy 
projects 
and"
"disseminating them among prospective investors;"
"(ii) development of guidelines in collaboration with relevant state agencies,"
"on evaluation and approval of on-grid and off-grid renewable energy projects."
"The  1st  respondent  has  legal  authority  under  the  Act  to  make  guidelines  on"
"renewable energy projects.  It is not unfair to give priority to the applicants who"
"have  obtained  provisional  approval  and  were  not  able 
to  obtain  all 
the"
"necessary  approvals  from  various  agencies  but  have  taken  up  various  steps"
"towards fulfilling all the conditions that are set by the 1st respondent. Probably,"
"such  applicants  may  have  invested  money  in  the  project  and  completed  some"
"groundwork. 
In  such  a  situation
