"the aid of the Court must have clean hands, meaning that they must"
"not have engaged in any wrongful or illegal conduct themselves."
"The  doctrine  of  clean  hands  has  its  roots  in  equity,  a  branch  of"
"common  law  that  seeks  to  prevent  unfairness  or  injustice.  The"
"doctrine  of  clean  hands  was  one  of  the  principles  of  equity  that"
"evolved  over  time.  It  was  based  on  the  maxim  “he  who  comes  into"
"equity must come with clean hands.” The maxim is premised on the"
"idea  that  a  person  who  seeks  the  aid  of  the  Court  must  not  have"
"engaged  in  any  wrongful  conduct  that  would  disqualify  them  from"
"receiving relief."
"The  application  of  the  principle  has  been  extrapolated  into  the  Sri"
"Lankan legal sphere through cases such as Gamini Dissanayake v."
"M. C. M. Kaleel and Others1 where eight members of a political party"
"were  expelled  froth  the  party  for  signing  an  impeachment  motion"
"against the President who was their party leader, without a hearing."
"The decision was challenged. The Supreme Court held that two out"
"of the eight Members of the Parliament who were Cabinet Ministers"
"were  guilty  of  unmeritorious  conduct  for  violating  the  principle  of"
"collective responsibility and therefore were disentitled from obtaining"
"relief due to the lack of clean hands."
