"In  view  of  the  above  facts,  the  Respondents  submits  that  the  land"
"which 
the  Petitioner  has  occupied  has  been  done  so  on  an"
"unauthorized basis. Further, as the Petitioner was not considered to"
"be a low-income earner the land has to be disposed to the Petitioner"
"by charging the value of the land, thus the 6 perches was valued at"
"rupees  600,000/=  by  the  Valuation  Department  (1R4,  1R5,  1R6)."
"Thus, as per Circular No 2014/01 the Petitioner is only entitled to"
"obtain  6  perches  from  the  land  in  question.  In  response  to  the"
"averments that the transfer was made without being communicated"
"to the Petitioner is fraudulent, arbitrary and amounts to ultra vires,"
"it is argued by the Respondents that the Board of Directors of the 1st"
"Respondent  approved  the  decision  to  dispose  25.22  perches  of  the"
"said land to the 7th Respondent with approval of the subject Minister."
"Once the due payments were settled by the 7th Respondent, the said"
"portion of land was disposed (1R15). Thus, the reasoning set out for"
"such a transfer has been provided for by the Deputy Chairman of the"
"1st Respondent Committee as being that, post a meeting with H. E."
"the President, it was directed that such land should not be disposed"
"other than for the wellbeing of the pilgrims who visit Katharagama,"
"thus as a result this land has been transferred to the 7th Respondent"
"to  provide  accommodation 
to  devotees  who  visit  Katharagama"
"(1R23)."
"Taking  cognizance  to  the  above  facts,  this  Court  views  that  as  the"
"land in question is State land the discretion of transferring the land"
"rests  within  State  with  adherence 
to  circumstantial 
facts,  and"
"circulars, legislations and direction by the State. In view of such, the"
"said land was transferred to the 7th Respondent in line with the view"
"of H. E. The President, who post a meeting directed that such bare"
"lands  should  not  be  disposed  other  than  for  the  wellbeing  of  the"
