"Further, this Court also notes that the relationship that exists between the"
"Petitioners and the 1st Respondent is purely contractual as it is based on a"
"loan agreement.  In this regard Ismail, J in De Alwis v Sri Lanka Telecom2"
"states as follows:"
"""The  decision  sought  to  be  quashed  is  a  decision  founded  purely  on"
"contract.  This  was  a  decision  taken  wholly  within  the  context  of  the"
"contractual relationship between the parties and not in the exercise of the"
"powers of a public authority. Neither Certiorari or Mandamus will lie to"
"remedy the grievances arising from an alleged breach of contract."""
"Furthermore, a distinction between contractual and public duties has been"
"provided for by Wade,"
"""A distinction which needs to be clarified is that between public duties"
"enforceable  by  mandamus,  which  are  usually  statutory,  and  duties"
"arising  merely  from  contract.  Contractual  duties  are  enforceable  as"
"matters  of  private  law  by  the  ordinary  contractual  remedies,  such  as"
"damages, injunction, specific performance and declaration. They are not"
"enforceable by mandamus, which in the first place is confined to public"
"duties........."" 3"
"""
Powers derived from contract are matters of private law and outside the"
"scope of prerogative remedies"" 4"
