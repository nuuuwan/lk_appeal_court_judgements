"“Weeramantry on ""The Law of Contracts"" 1999 reprint, vol. 1 at page"
"300 enunciates the rule as follows:"
"I
n accordance with the rules of Justus error the Court would not readily"
"come to the aid of a person who states that he did not sufficiently attend"
"to  the  terms  of  a  contract  or  did  not  read  it  sufficiently  carefully,  or"
"altogether neglected to read the document containing the contract. Thus,"
"where a person who is neither illiterate nor blind signs a deed without"
"examining its contents, he would not, as a general rule, be permitted in"
"Roman  Dutch  Law  to  set  up  the  plea  that  the  document  is  not  his.  If"
"however, without negligence, a person executes a document in ignorance"
"of its true nature, he may repudiate it, and this repudiation holds good"
"even as against 3rd persons who have in good faith acted upon it as a"
"genuine expression of intention."""
"T
herefore, negligence on the part of the 2nd defendant-respondent is not"
"an excuse to deny liability and burden on his part. The 2nd defendant-"
"respondent did not make use of numerous opportunities as aforesaid to"
"repudiate the agreement…”"
