"Section 28 (2) of the Act provides for a situation where the Court orders a sum"
"as compensation in its own motion and as to the methodology of recovery in such"
"a situation, and not for a situation that has occurred in this matter."
"The learned High Court Judge has well-considered the default sentence imposed"
"by the learned Magistrate and had to come to a right conclusion that it was not"
"according  to  the  law.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  reduced  the  default"
"sentence in order to make the order of the learned Magistrate fall in line with the"
"applicable law."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  no  reasons  to  interfere  with  the"
"judgement of the learned High Court Judge of Vavuniya as well as the Order of"
"the learned Magistrate of Mullaitivu."
"Accordingly, the application for revision is dismissed as it is devoid of merit."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the High"
"Court  of  Vavuniya  and  to  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Mullaitivu  for  information"
"purposes."
