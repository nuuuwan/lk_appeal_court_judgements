"It was the position of the learned Counsel that the purpose of the above Act was"
"not to provide compensation in this type of instances, and if one to consider that"
"the  learned  Magistrate  has  acted  in  terms  of  section  28  of  the  Act,  it  was"
"imperative on learned Magistrate to follow the procedure laid out in section 28"
"(2)  of  the  Act.  It  was  his  contention  that  the  proceedings  before  the  learned"
"Magistrate clearly establishes the fact that the order for compensation was not"
"based on the Act contemplated by the Hon. Attorney General, therefore, the order"
"was palpably wrong and illegal."
"The  learned  Counsel  cited  the  case  Nirosh  Amantha  Amadoru  Vs.  Attorney"
"General CA (PHC) APN 128/15 decided on 23-11-2016 and the case of W. H."
"Thulyananda  Senananda  Vs.  Attorney  General  CA  (PHC)  APN  28/2014"
"decided on 07-07-2014 in support of his contention."
"It was the position of the learned State Counsel that when the petitioners were"
"charged  before  the  Magistrate  on  28-11-2017,  the  petitioners  as  well  as  the"
"aggrieved party had been represented by their respective Attorneys-at-Law and"
"since  the  count  preferred  against  them  was  a  count  that  can  be  settled,  the"
"petitioners  wanted  to  pay  the  amount  mentioned  in  the  charge  sheet  and  the"
"complainant was willing to accept the same by way of a settlement."
"It  was  the  view  of  the  learned  State  Counsel  that  the  petitioners  happened  to"
"plead  guilty  under  those  circumstances,  and  the  sentence  imposed  on  them"
"being a mere fine of Rs. 1500/= each would also reflect that fact."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  State  Counsel  that  although  the  learned"
"Magistrate had not mentioned under what provision of law, he is ordering Rs."
"950,000/=  as  compensation,  since  the  law  provides  for  that  in  terms  of  the"
"Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No.4 of 2015,"
"it was not an illegal order. The learned State Counsel contended that since the"
"learned High Court Judge has well considered the relevant legal provisions and"
"had reduced the default sentence to fall it in line with the law, there is no basis"
