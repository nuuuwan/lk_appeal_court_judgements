"It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that PW-01 was"
"the only eyewitness to the incident and this was an incident happened around"
"8.30 in the night. Relying on the evidence of the investigating officer who had"
"stated that the streetlight was not functioning when he went to the scene of the"
"crime and the fact that the investigating officer has not stated whether there was"
"a  wedding  function  nearby,  it  was  his  position  that  a  serious  doubt  arises"
"whether witness PW-01 has clearly identified the appellant as the assailant."
"Referring  to  the  medical  evidence  it  was  his  position  that  there  had  been  6"
"injuries to the deceased, but PW-01 speaks only about 1 attack which also shows"
"that he has failed to see what happened at the time of the incident. It was his"
"position  that  relying  on  the  sole  eyewitness  to  convict  the  appellant  for  the"
"offence of murder was not safe due to the discrepancies in the mode of identity"
"and the doubt arises in relation to the identity should be considered in favour of"
"the appellant."
"The submissions of the learned DSG on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General was"
"that  there  is  no  doubt  as  to  the  identity  of  the  appellant  as  the  person  who"
"attacked the deceased. He pointed out to the fact that the deceased, the appellant"
"and  PW-01  were  well  known  to  each  other  and  PW-01  had  first  identified  the"
"appellant through the light emanating from the headlight of the motorbike. Being"
"a person well known to him, there would have been no difficulty for PW-01 to"
"identify the appellant positively was the submission of the learned DSG."
"It was his contention that there was no discrepancy between the evidence of the"
"JMO as to the injuries he observed and the evidence of PW-01, if one takes the"
"evidence in its totality rather than compartmentalizing it."
