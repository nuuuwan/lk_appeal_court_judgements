"[115] A perusal of the TAC brief reveals that the Appellant has not produced"
"the statement of accounts before the TAC and identified the claimed outgoings"
"incurred in the performance of its business operation and maintained separate"
"accounts for interest income and interest expenses separately as required by"
"section 106 (11) of the IRA 2006. No submission was made during the course"
"of  the  argument  that  the  Appellant  had  maintained  separate  accounts  and"
"identified the outgoings incurred for the purpose of the business of the Appellant"
"in relation to Sri Lanka development Bonds."
"[116]  Unlike  in  the  case  of  P.D.  Rodrigo  v.  CGIR  (supra),  the  issue  in  the"
"present case is about the deductibility  of interest expenses  incurred either in"
"the  production  of 
interest 
income  or  outgoings,  not  being 
incurred 
in 
the"
"production of profits and income. In any event, in the case of P.D. Rodrigo v."
"CGIR  (supra), 
the  amount  of 
the  expenses  was  clearly 
identified  by 
the"
"assessee and the assessor from the exempt income derived from the services"
"[117] The Appellant who claims that the expenses claimed do not relate to the"
"production of profits or income but outgoings must maintain separate accounts"
"and 
identify  such  expenses  separately 
in 
the  statement  of  accounts.  No"
"material had been produced by the Appellant to identify the nature of expenses,"
"whether incurred in the production of profits or income, or outgoings incurred in"
"the performance of business operation by the Appellant in the performance of"
"its  business  generating  non-taxable  exempt 
income,  which  has  not  been"
"separately identified by the Appellant in its audited statement of accounts."
"[118] In my view, the Appellant has failed to identify the nature of the expenses"
"claimed by it and show that it has actually incurred expenses in the performance"
"of  its  business  operation  in  relation  to  Sri  Lanka  Development  Bonds  and"
"include 
them  separately 
in 
the  audited  statement  of  accounts.  For 
those"
"reasons, I hold that the Appellant is not entitled to deduct the interest expenses"
"claimed by it under the provisions of section 25(1) (f) of the IRA 2006."
