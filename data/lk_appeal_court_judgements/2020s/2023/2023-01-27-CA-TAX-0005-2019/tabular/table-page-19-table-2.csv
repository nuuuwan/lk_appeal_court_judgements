"section specifically mentions other outgoings. The word “outgoings” in this"
"context,  must  be  construed  as  outgoings  other  than  those  specifically"
"mentioned. ....”"
"[52] Apart from the outgoings as deductions, a taxpayer can also rely on the"
"expenses  incurred  in  the  production  of  income  to  be  claimed  as  deductions,"
"which  are  all  outgoings  but  all  outgoings  are  not  expenses  incurred  in  the"
"production of the profits or income. Based on the reasoning of Basnayake, C.J."
"in Hayley and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra), stated"
"that the term “outgoing” is wider than the term “expense” and while the word"
"“expense” is limited by the words “incurred in the production of the profits or"
"income”, the word “outgoing” is not limited by those words."
"[53] On the analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case, Basnayake,"
"C.J., held that while the loss suffered by burglary was not an expense incurred"
"in producing the profits of the business, the loss was an outgoing deductible"
"under Section 9 (1) in ascertaining the profits or income. Sinnetamby, J. in the"
"same  case,  while  agreeing  that  the  word  “outgoing”  is  wider  than  the  term"
"“expense”, stated that it must not be limited to voluntary payments, but would"
"also include involuntary outgoings such as petty theft by subordinates (p. 177)."
"Sinnetamby, J.  stated however, that the “outgoings” must be of such a nature"
"as would come within the meaning of the expression “incurred in the production"
"of profits” (supra).  Sinnetamby, J. held that the loss suffered by the assessee"
"must  be  regarded  as  incidental  to  the  assessee’s  business  and  thus,  it  was"
"deductible under Section 9 (1) of the Ordinance."
"[54]  The  only  disagreement  of  the  views  expressed  by  Basnayake,  C.J.  and"
"Sinnetamby, J. related to the question whether or not the “outgoings” must be"
"limited  by  the  words  “incurred  in  the  production  of  profits  or  income”.  The"
"proposition of Basnayake, C.J. was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Rodrigo"
"v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2002) 1 Sri LR 384, where Bandaranayake, J."
"(as she then was) with Sarath N. Silva, C.J. and Ismail, J. agreeing observed"
"at page 390:"
