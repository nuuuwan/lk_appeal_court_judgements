"","1.  The word “includes” is generally used in interpretative clauses in order to"
"","enlarge  the  meaning  of  words  or  phrases  occurring  in  the  body  of  the"
"","statute and when so used these words or phrases must be construed as"
"","comprehending,  not  only  such  things  as  they  signify  according  to  their"
"","natural 
import,  but  also 
those 
things  which 
the 
interpretation  clause"
"","declares that they shall include;"
"","2.  But, the word “includes” is susceptible of another construction, which may"
"","become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to show that it was"
"","not merely employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance"
"","of the words or expressions defined. It may be then, equivalent to mean"
"","and include and, in that case, it may afford an exhaustive explanation of"
"","the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must invariably be attached"
"","to these words or expressions;"
"","3.  Under the third category, the word “includes” is merely enumerative and in"
"","such  cases,  the  term  is  placed  preceding  the  word  “includes”  and  is"
