"(b) they must be expenses incurred in the production of the profits or"
"income; and"
"(iii) 
they  must  be  not  deductions  prohibited  under  Section  26 
in"
"ascertaining profits, and income (excluded deductions from the general"
"deduction in Section 25 (1)."
"[94]  The  Supreme  Court 
in  Rodrigo  v.  Commissioner-General  of 
Inland"
"Revenue (supra), observed that Section 24 (1) (g) read with Section 23 (1) of"
"the Act, show that-"
"(a) all outgoings and expenses incurred by a person in the production of"
"income from any source could be incurred as deductions-Section 23(1);"
"(b) any disbursement or expenses which was not spent for the purpose of"
"production  of  profits  and  income  cannot  be  deducted  as  specified  in"
"Section 24(1)(g)."
"[95]  Having  identified  the  combined  effect  of  the  two  sections,  the  Supreme"
"Court held that (i) the general deduction provision in Section 23 (1) is restricted"
"by the general prohibition provision in Section 24 (1) (g); and (ii) although all"
"outgoings  and  expenses  incurred  are  deducted  under  Section  23  (1),  any"
"amount  which  was  not  expended  for  the  purpose  of  producing  the  income"
"cannot be deducted (p. 395)."
"[96]  It  is  crystal  clear  that  the  Supreme  Court  in  Rodrigo  v.  Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue (supra), only considered the combined effect of the"
"two general provisions, namely, the general deduction provision-positive rule,"
"and the general prohibition of deduction-negative rule. It held that the general"
"deduction provision in Section 25 (1) (positive rule) is restricted by the general"
"prohibition of deduction provision in Section 26 (negative rule). This principle"
"that  Sections  25  (1)  and  26  should  be  read  together  on  the  basis  of  the"
"judgment  in  Rodrigo  v.  Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue  (supra)  is"
"consistent with the position taken by the Appellant in the present case, and in"
"my view, it is the correct interpretation of the said two provisions. This principle,"
"however, did  not  prevent  the Tax  Appeals Commission from  considering  the"
"distinction  between 
the  specific  deduction 
in  Section  25  (1)  (k)  and 
the"
"prohibition of deduction in Section 26 (2)."
"[97]  However,  the  Supreme  Court  in  Rodrigo  v.  Commissioner  General  of"
"Inland  Revenue  (supra)  was  not  invited  to  consider  the  interpretation  of  the"
"Privy Council decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income"
"Tax,  Trinidad  &  Tobago  (supra)  or  the  relationship  between  any  specific"
"deduction provision such as Section 25 (1) (f) and the general prohibition on"
"deduction provision such as Section 26 (1) in the present case."
