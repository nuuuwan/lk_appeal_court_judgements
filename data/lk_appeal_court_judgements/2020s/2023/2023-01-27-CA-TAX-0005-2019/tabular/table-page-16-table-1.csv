"2006 cannot claim to deduct the direct interest expenses incurred for the same"
"business  of  investing  in  Sri  Lanka  Development  Bonds  when  there  is  no"
"material to show that the DTAA provisions are in conflict with the provisions of"
"the IRA 2006. It cannot be said thus, that the provisions of the DTAA override"
"the  IRA  2006,  or  that  there  is  a  discrimination  in  treating  the  non-resident"
"Appellant  comparably  placed 
in  similar  situations  and  under 
the  same"
"circumstances in the source country (Sri Lanka) so that the non-discrimination"
"provision in Article 25 may be attracted."
"[40]  The  deductibility  or  non-deductibility  of  expenses  or  outgoings  are"
"governed by the provisions of section 25(1) and section 26 of the IRA 2006."
"The Appellant further relies on the provisions of the IRA 2006 and claims that"
"the  interest expenses are  deductible  under section 25(1)(f) of the  IRA  2006"
"whether it was incurred in the production of income or not and section 26(1)(g)"
"is inapplicable. If so, the Appellant cannot now contend that the provisions of"
"the IRA 2006 are in conflict with the provisions of the DTAA on the deductibility"
"of 
the 
interest  expenses  or 
that 
there 
is  a  discrimination 
in 
treating 
the"
"Appellant as a non-resident permanent establishment than the resident person"
"of Sri Lanka placed on the same conditions and under same circumstances,"
"both in fact and law, as it applies to a resident."
"[41]  For  those  reasons,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  deduction  of  the  interest"
"expense  claimed  by  the  Appellant  is  governed  by  the  provisions  of  the  IRA"
"2006 and not by the provision of Article 7(3) of the DTAA."

"[42]  Now  I  shall  consider  the  two  arguments  of  Mr.  Ameen  that  even  if  it  is"
"assumed that the deductibility of interest income is governed by the provisions"
"of  the  IRA  2006,  (i)  the  interest  expenses  claimed  by  the  Appellant  is  an"
"“outgoing”  which  is  not  limited  to  expenditure  incurred  in  the  production  of"
"profits or income, and therefore, it includes items irrespective of whether or not"
"they are “incurred in the production of profits or income”; and (ii) the interest"
"expenses claimed by the Appellant   attract section 25(1)(f) as it is a special"
"rule of deduction despite section 26(1)(g). He first relied on the decision of the"
