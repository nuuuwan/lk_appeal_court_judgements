"that the profits and income from each such unit or undertaking or such trade,"
"business,  profession  or vocation  as  the  case  may  be,  may  be  separately"
"identified‚Äù."
"[111] In my  view, the  proper test is to consider whether or not the expenses"
"were  really  incurred  in  the  performance  of  the  operation  of  the  business,  as"
"outgoings not necessarily being incurred in the production of profits or income"
"in relation to Sri Lanka Development Bonds, and if so, whether they have been"
"separately 
identified 
in 
the  statements  of  accounts.  Where 
the 
interest"
"expenses are truly and really linked to the business operation of the Appellant"
"and identified them separately in the accounts, the argument that the taxpayer"
"is getting a double advantage, both from the tax exemption from interest income"
"and deduction of expenses has no merits."
"[112] However, where the taxpayer who got its interest income exempted from"
"tax, under section 13(xxx), fails to show that it truly and really incurred expenses"
"as  outgoings 
to  perform 
the  operation  of 
its  business  and 
identify 
them"
"separately  in  the  accounts,  he  cannot  have  a  dual  benefit  from  both  the  tax"
"interest  exemption  and  deduction  of  interest  expenses.  If  it  is  allowed,  the"

"of deducting the expenses not incurred and linked to its business operation as"
"an outgoing, though not necessarily being incurred in the production of income."
"Has  the  Appellant  really  incurred  expenses  in  the  performance  of  its"
"business operation?"
"[113]  Now  the  crucial point  is whether or not  the  Appellant  has  satisfied that"
"truly  and 
really 
incurred  expenses  as  outgoings 
in 
the  carrying  on  or"
"performance  of  its  business  operations  in  relation  to  Sri  Lanka  Government"
"Bonds, and identified them separately in the accounts. The assessor has stated"
"in his letter dated 22.11.2013 that (i) the expenditure incurred in the production"
"of such interest income and the expenses claimed should be clearly identified"
"separately; (ii) the Appellant has failed to identify the expenses incurred in the"
"production of exempt interest in relation to Sri Lanka Government Development"
"Bonds. He allowed the interest income claimed by the Appellant under section"
"13(xxx) but disallowed the deduction of interest expenses, said to have been"
"incurred from investment in Sri Lanka Development bonds."
"[114] The assessor  has  calculated  the expenses on  a  pro  rate  basis since  it"
"was not possible for him separately identify the interest expenses claimed by"
"the Appellant as follows:"
