"[62] Mr. Ameen referred to the Privy Council decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds"
"v. Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) and argued that"
"the use of the word “including” in Section 25 (1) enlarges the meaning of the"
"words or phrases contained in the statute. He submitted that if the intention was"
"to  make  the  list  exhaustive,  the  legislature  would  not  have  used  the  word"
"“including”'  only,  but  would  have  used  the  word  “means”  or  the  expression"
"“means and includes” therein."
"[63] It is significant to identify the context in which the word “including” has been"
"used  by 
the 
legislature  at 
the  end  of 
the  body  of  Section  25 
(1).  The"
"interpretation of the term ""including"" at the end of the body of Section 25 (1)"
"becomes paramount and therefore, one has to understand the true intent of the"
"legislature and put a proper construction to the same. In relation to the meaning"
"to  be  given  to  the  word  ""including"",  the  Appellant  and  the  Respondent  have"
"cited various definitions and judgments where the word “including” or “includes”"
"or “mean and include” is used in different contexts. For a proper comprehension"
"of  the  term  ""including"",  one  should  examine  the  views  taken  by  courts  in"
"different jurisdictions."
"[64] The word ""includes"" has different meanings in different contexts. Standard"
"dictionaries  assign  more  than  one  meaning  to  the  word  ""include"".  Webster's"
"Dictionary  defines 
the  word  ""include""  as  synonymous  with  ""comprise""  or"
"""contain"". According to Black’s Law Dictionary (West, 4th Ed., 2009) at p. 905,"
"the  word  “including” may,  according  to  context,  express  an enlargement  and"
"have the meaning of and or in addition to or merely specify a particular thing"
"already included within general words."
"Extensive Construction"
"[65]  It  is  well-settled  that  when  the  interpretation  clause  used  an  inclusive"
"definition, it would be generally expansive in nature and thus, it seeks to enlarge"
"the meaning of the words or phrases used in an interpretation clause, unless it"
"manifests  a  contrary  intention  very  clearly  (P.  M.  Bakshi,  Interpretation  of"
"Statutes,  First  Edition,  2008,  pp.  242-243).  In  such  case,  the  word  “include”"
"must  be  construed  as  comprehending,  not  only  such  things  as  they  signify"
"according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation"
"clause  declares 
that 
they  shall 
include 
(Commissioner  of 
Inland  Tax  v."
"Banddarawathie Fernando Charitable Trusts (63 N.L.R 409). Generally, when"
"the  word  ""include""  is  used  in  a  definition  clause,  it  is  used  as  a  word  of"
"enlargement, and in that sense, the term “include” would suggest definition to"
"be extensive and not restrictive."
"Exhaustive Construction- “means and includes”"
