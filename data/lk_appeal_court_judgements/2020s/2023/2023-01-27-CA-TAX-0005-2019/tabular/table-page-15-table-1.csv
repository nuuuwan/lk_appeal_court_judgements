"[","38] In Johnson And Johnson (Private) Limited v. The Commissioner General"
"of Inland Revenue (supra), this Court further held:",""
"","116-This principle requires that the permanent establishments’ business"
"","activities shall be compared with the similar business activities (same type"
"","of business) of the hypothetical resident person, and if both are involved"
"","in  similar  business  activities, 
the  non-resident  shall  not  be 
treated"
"","differently or both resident and non-resident shall be treated in the same"
"","way 
(.  Secondly,  by 
the  application  of 
the  ordinary 
tax 
laws  and"
"","regulations, both law and fact, the comparison must be made between the"
"","permanent  establishment  and 
the  hypothetical 
resident  company 
to"
"","ascertain whether they are in the same circumstances. If the domestic tax"
"","law/regulations subject a permanent establishment to additional taxation"
"","compared to a hypothetical resident placed under the same circumstances"
"","in the source country, the non-discrimination provision in Article 25 may"
"","be attracted;"
"","117-Thirdly,  the  test also  requires a  comparison to be  made between a"
"","permanent  establishment  and  a  hypothetical 
resident  company  with"
"","regard  to  the  imposition  and  exemptions  of  the  tax  liability  to  ascertain"
"","whether  the  two  can  be  placed  under  the  same  conditions.  If  both  are"
"","placed under the same conditions, a permanent establishment, shall not"
"","be 
treated  differently  as  both  hypothetical 
resident  and  permanent"
"","establishment (non-residents) shall be treated in the same way;"
"","118-The  comparison  between 
the  permanent  establishment  and 
the"
"","hypothetical resident company for the purpose of affording relief from the"
"","non-discrimination clause of the DTAA, shall be thus, made subject to the"
"","imposition  and  limitations  laid  down  in  the  domestic  law  of  the"
"","source country  subject  further,  to  the  extent of  inconsistency  with"
"","Treaty terms. This also means that where the provisions of the domestic"
"","tax law are inconsistent with the provisions of the DTAA, the provisions of"
"","the DTAA will prevail;"
"","119-All what is required is that the provisions of the domestic tax law, shall"
"","be  interpreted  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  DTAA,  otherwise,  the"
"","domestic tax law would be rendered meaningless and redundant. This is"
"","based on the principle that a DTAA exists to avoid double taxation, not to"
"","impose taxes as it is not an exercise in tax avoidance but avoidance of"
"","double  taxation.  The  DTTA  rules  merely  alter  the  legal  consequences"
"","derived  from  the  tax  laws  of  the  Contracting  States, either  by excluding"
"","application  of  the  provisions  of  the  domestic  tax  law  where  DTAA  rules"
"","apply or by obliging one or both of the Contracting States to allow a credit"
"","against their domestic tax for taxes paid in other States”."
