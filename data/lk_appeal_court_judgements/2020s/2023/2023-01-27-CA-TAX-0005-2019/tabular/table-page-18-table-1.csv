"However,  there  is  a  distinction  between  “outgoings”  and  “expenses”  for  the"
"purposes of Section 25 (1) of the IRA 2006."
"[48]  In  the  New  Shorter  Oxford  English  Dictionary  on  Historical  Principles"
"(Clarendon  Press,  1993,  Volume  2)  at  p  2038,  “outgoing”  is  defined  to  be"
"“expenditure, outlay”. The Black’s Law Dictionary (West, 9th Ed, 2009) at 658"
"defines  the  term  “expense”  as  “an  expenditure  of  money,  time,  labour,  or"
"resources 
to  accomplish  a 
result;  especially,  a  business  expenditure"
"chargeable  against  revenue  for  a  specific  period”.  “Expenditure”  in  turn  is"
"defined  by  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  as  “(i).  The  act  or  process  of  paying  out;"
"disbursement; (ii). A sum paid out”."
"[49] The Appellant contended that an interest expense in question need not be"
"incurred in the production of income for it to be deductible under Section 25"
"(1) of the Inland Revenue Act, relying on the decision in Hayley and Company"
"Ltd  v.  Commissioner  of 
Inland  Revenue 
(supra)  and  Rodrigo  v.  The"
"Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) that while all expenses are"
"outgoings, all outgoings are not expenses and thus, outgoings are not limited"
"by the words “incurred in the production of the profit or income”."
"[50]  The  meaning  of  “outgoings”  was  examined  by two  Sri  Lankan  cases  in"
"Hayley  and  Company  Ltd  v.  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  (supra)  and"
"Rodrigo v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra). In this regard, it must be"
"noted that the decision of the Supreme Court in Hayley and Company Ltd v."
"Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) was followed by Bandaranayake J,"
"(as she then was) in Rodrigo v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra). The"
"decision  in  Hayley  and  Company  Ltd  v.  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue"
"(supra)  that  dealt  with  the  general  deduction  rule  in  Section  9  (1),  specific"
"deduction  rule 
in  sub-sections  (1)  -(i)  of  Section  9  (1) 
thereof,  and 
the"
"prohibition of the deduction rule in Section 10 (c) of the Income Tax Ordinance"
"(Chap 188), is instructive."
"Hayley and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue"
"[51] In Hayley and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra),"
"Basnayake  C.J.,  drew  a  distinction  between 
the  word 
“outgoings”  and"
"“expenses”  in  Section  9  (1)  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance  of  Ceylon  and"
"considered 
their 
relationship  and 
limitations.  This  case  considered 
the"
"question  whether the  loss  suffered by  the burglary  was  an  “outgoing” under"
"Section  9  (1)  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance  of  Ceylon  for  the  purpose  of"
"ascertaining the profits or income of the Company from its trade or business."
"Basnayake, C.J. explained the distinction between the word “outgoings” and"
"“expenses” at p. 175 as follows:"
