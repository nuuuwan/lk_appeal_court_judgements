"had taken any measures to look out to why the vehicle has not reached"
"home by the evening, as the alleged charge was claimed stating the lorry"
"was taken to custody at ‘night’."
"This too draws the courts attention to consider that the appellant has"
"not taken any satisfactory precautionary measures to prevent the use"
"of the vehicle for the commission of the said offence."

"that  “the  registered  owner…who  has  the  control  over  the  vehicle  is"
"required to satisfy court that he had taken precautions to prevent the"
"commission of the offence and that the offence was committed without"

"clearly  evident  through  the  examined  evidence  that  the  appellant  has"
"not been able to successfully establish on a balance of probability that"
"she  took  the  necessary  measures  of  precautions  to  prevent  the  said"
"offence."

the  offence"
"committed is not sufficient to discharge the burden cast on a registered"
"owner of a vehicle."
