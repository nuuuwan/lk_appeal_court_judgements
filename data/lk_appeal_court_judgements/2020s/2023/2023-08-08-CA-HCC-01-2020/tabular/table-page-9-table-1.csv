"or palpably false, in which case it could be rejected without even considering the evidence"
"for the prosecution.”"
"We hold that the evidence of the defense has not created any reasonable doubt in"
"the prosecution’s case"
"On a perusal of the judgement of the learned  trial judge, it is evident that the"
"judge  thoroughly  considered  all  the  material  evidence  presented  at  the  trial  by  both"
"parties. The evidence provided by the Accused was also scrutinized and carefully assessed"
"by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge further elaborated on the reasons for"
"disbelieving the defence’s version of the case."
"For  the  above  said  reasons  I  find  that  the  Accused  has  failed  to  convince  this"
"court  that  the  said  conviction  cannot  be  reached  with  the  evidence  led  before  the  trial"
"court, therefore this court dismisses the appeal and affirm the sentence and conviction."
