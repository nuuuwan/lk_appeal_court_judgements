"We are mindful of the observation made by W.L Ranjith Silva J with regard to"
"the evidence of the defense in the case of Don. Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha v."
"Attorney General, CA 303/2006, decided on  11.07.2012,  His Lordship held that;"
"â€œWhether the evidence of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient to"
"create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum or in isolation because it needs to be"
"considered in the totality of the evidence that is in the light of the evidence for the"
"prosecution as well as the defence. it is wrong to assume that under no circumstances"
"should the evidence of the prosecution be considered but the evidence for the prosecution"
"should not be compared with the dock statement as it is against the fundamental"
"principles of law and will amount to shifting the burden of proof. Yes I do admit that the"
"dock statement should not be compared with the evidence for the prosecution but in"
"deciding whether the dock statement is sufficient to create a doubt the judge must be"
"m
i
ndful of the evidence for the prosecution. Finally having considered the case for the"
"prosecution as well as the dock statement it is only then the learned Judge can decide"
"whether or not the dock statement is sufficient to create a doubt in the case for the"
"prosecution. One cannot isolate or disregard the prosecution case completely and consider"
"only the dock statement in deciding whether the dock statement is sufficient to create a"
"doubt provided it is so obvious that the dock statement is only a bear denial or is irrational"
