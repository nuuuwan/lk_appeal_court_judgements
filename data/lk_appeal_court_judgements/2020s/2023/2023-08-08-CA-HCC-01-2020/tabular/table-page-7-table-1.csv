"It should be noted that PW1 failed to mention in his testimony that he had received"
"the production from PW11 and handed it over to the Government Analyst."
"Our courts pay close attention to the chain of custody of evidence and the inward"
"journey  of  production.  The  Prosecution  must  provide  irrefutable  evidence  to  prove  the"
"chain of custody beyond reasonable doubt. Although PW1 did not inform the court that he"
"had received the evidence from PW11 and handed it over to the Government Analyst, both"
"PW11 and the Government Analyst, an independent witness, have confirmed that PW1"
"was indeed the individual who handed over the evidence to the Government Analyst."
"This position is further reinforced by the following evidence: according to PW11,"
"the production was handed over to PW1 at 1:45 pm, and the Government Analyst stated"
"that she received the production at 3:00 pm. Therefore, we do not find any doubt regarding"
"the  chain  of  custody.  The  defense  filed  further  written  objections  on  July  7,  2023,"
"including:"
"a)  The unexplained van and the timing of the receipt of information and departure"
"from the Maligakanda Police. Upon reviewing PW1's testimony, he stated that the"
"van belonged to a friend and that the police station was a short distance away."
"b)  The reason for going to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB)"
"c)  The actuality of the police officers actually go to the PNB."
"The defense counsel noted that the police had a weighing scale when they left the"
"station.  It  is  important  to  note  that  PW1,  who  led  the  team,  lacked  experience  with"
"conducting raids; this was his first raid as a leader. We find no fault in PW1 going to the"
"PNB, given his inexperience with using the weighing scale. The Accused himself admitted"
"in his dock statement that he was taken to the PNB."
