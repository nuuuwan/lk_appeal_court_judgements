"[86] It seems to me that the attention of the Court of Appeal has not been"
"adequately drawn to the scope of section 112(1) of the Inland Revenue Act,"
"No. 28 of 1979, which is identical to section 11A(1) of the TAC Act. The Court"
"of  Appeal  in  The Commissioner General v.  Koggala Garments (Pvt) Ltd"
"(supra), has paid little attention to section 112(1), which allows any person"
"aggrieved  by  the  BOR  decision  to  invoke  the  appellate  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Court of Appeal. I am of the view that it is section 11A(1) that has granted"
"the Appellant to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal by"
"way of case stated on a question of law unless that right is expressly taken"
"away by a subsequent enactment or by the Constitution, that right exists ."
"[87] At this stage, it is relevant to note  that the right of appeal by way of a"
"case  stated  is  a  substantive  right  given  to  any  person  aggrieved  by  the"
"decision of the TAC in terms of section 11A(1) of the TAC Act.  When that"
"right  has  already  vested  with  the  parties  on  the  date  the lis  (proceedings)"
"commenced in the TAC,  that right cannot be denied to such party who seeks"
"remedies  to  violated  rights,  unless  that  right  has  been  taken  away  by  a"
"subsequent  enactment,  if  it  so  provided  expressly  and  not  otherwise.  The"
"only condition is that the Appellant must fulfill the procedural requirements"
"set out in the second part of section 11A(1)."
