"","[92] From the decisions cited above, the following principles clearly emerge:"
"","1.  The legal pursuit of a remedy, suit, appeal and second appeal are really"
"","but steps in a series of proceedings all connected by an intrinsic unity"
"","and are to be regarded as one legal proceeding;"
"","2.  The  right  of  appeal 
is  not  a  mere  matter  of  procedure  but 
is  a"
"","substantive right;"
"","3.  The institution of the suit carries with it the implication that all rights of"
"","appeal then in force are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of"
"","the career of the suit;"
"","4.  The  right  of  appeal  is  a  vested  right  and  such  a  right  to  enter  the"
"","superior court accrues to the litigant and exists as on and from the date"
"","the lis commences and although it may be actually exercised when the"
"","adverse judgment is pronounced;"
"5.","Such right is to be governed by the law prevailing at the date of the"
"","institution of the suit or proceeding and not by the law that prevails at"
"","the date of its decision or at the date of the filing of the appeal;"
"","6.  This  vested  right  of  appeal  can  be  taken  away  only  by  a  subsequent"
"","enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and"
"","not otherwise (Emphasis added) (see-Satya Nand Jha and Ors. v. Union"
