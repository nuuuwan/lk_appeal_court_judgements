"[44] Samarakoon C.J. in D.M.S. Fernado v. A.M. Ismail (supra) made the following"
"statement at pp. 193-194:"
"“A duty is now imposed on the Assessor not only to give reasons for non-"
"acceptance of a return, but also to communicate them to the assessor. ..…."
"The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the"
"amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at"
"the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and"
"has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the"
"reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving"
"o
f
 reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the"
"amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed."
"More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is the"
"i
ndication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of"
"f
i
x
i
ng the Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop"
"and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a"
"r
e
t
urn should state his reasons and communicate them. His reasons must be"
"communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated"
"i
ncome. Any later communication would defeat the remedial action intended"
"by the amendment” (emphasis added).’ (Emphasis added)."
