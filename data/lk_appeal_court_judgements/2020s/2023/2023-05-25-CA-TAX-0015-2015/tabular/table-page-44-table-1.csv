"submitted  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  relate  to  the  validity  of  the  notice  of"
"assessment, which is a question of law that arises on the case stated  under"
"section 11A(1). That annulment of assessment is a decision that is part and"
"parcel of the case stated [see- section 11A(2)] and thus, all the questions of"
"law that pertain to that decision arise on the stated case for the opinion of"
"this Court. In addition, the legislature has clearly provided in section 11A(6)"
"that the Court of Appeal has powers to hear and determine “any question"

"section 11A(2), which includes almost all the questions of law submitted by"
"the TAC for the opinion of this Court."

"prefer an appeal. In the instant case, the right of appeal by way of a case"
"stated, is a substantive right granted under Section 11A (1) of the TAC Act."
"That  right  is  exercised  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  terms  of  the  powers"

"[107] On the other hand, the judicial authorities support the view that the"
"questions  of  law  are  not  restricted  to  the  stated  case,  or  to  the  question"
"formulated by the TAC and therefore, the Court of Appeal is not precluded"
"from considering any point upon which the actual decision of the TAC might"
"be upheld or annulled."
"[

"the case of R.M. Fernando v Commissioner of Income Tax (Reports of Ceylon"
