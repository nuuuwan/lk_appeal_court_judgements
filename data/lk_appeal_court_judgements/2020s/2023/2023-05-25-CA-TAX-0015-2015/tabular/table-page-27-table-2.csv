"Forsyth, page No. 260). In Union of India and Anr. v. Paras Laminates (P) Ltd."
"[1990]186ITR722(SC), it was held as follows:"
"â€œThe powers of the Tribunal are no doubt limited. Its area of jurisdiction is"
"c
l
early defined, but within the bounds of its jurisdiction, it has all the"
"powers expressly and impliedly granted. The implied grant is, of course,"
"l
i
m
i
ted by the express grant and, therefore, it can only be such powers as"
"are truly incidental and ancillary for doing all such acts or employing all"
"such means as are reasonably necessary to make the grant effective. As"
"s
tated in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (11th edn.) ""where an Act"
"confers a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such"
"acts, or employing such means, as are essentially necessary to its"
"execution""."
