"legislature  to  use  the  words  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  “may  hear  and"
"determine any question of law arising on the stated case”, and it could have"
"easily  used  the  words  “..”any  question  of  law  arising  on  the  assessment"
"determined by the Commission”."
"[102] Second, the Respondent contended that the use of the words “”and”"
"in the second line of section 11A(6) restrict the  meaning of the words “any"
"question of law” and thus, “any question” in section 11A(6) is restricted to"
"the words  “confirm, reduce, increase or annul of the assessment determined"
"by the commission”, and nothing more. The Respondent fails to understand"
"however, that section 11A(6) only refers to the appellate powers of the Court"
"of Appeal to determine any question of law arsing on the stated case,  and"
"the  use  of  the  word  “and”  in  the  second  line  of  section  11A(6),  does  not"
"restrict  the  words  “any  question  of 
law”  to  the  determination  of  the"
"substantive matters of the assessment."
"[
103] On the other hand, the word “may” after the word “and” in the second"
"line  and  the  word  “or”  in  the  fifth  line,  after  the  words  “confirm,  reduce,"
"increase, or annul the assessment determined by the Commission” confirm"
"the position that the legislature has intended to provide two distinct powers"
"to the Court of Appeal in appeal by way of case stated in the determination"
"of the questions of law."
"[
104] In my view, the second part of section 11A(6) is not restricted to the"
"words  “confirm,  reduce, 
increase,  or  annul  the  assessment”  unless  the"
"legislature has expressly provided that the right of any aggrieved party to"
"invoke  the  appellate 
jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under  section  11A(1) 
is"
"restricted to the determination of the substantive matters of the assessment"
"determined  by  the  TAC.  On  the  contrary,  the  legislature  has  granted  a"
"substantive right of appeal by way of case stated to the Appellant to invoke"
"the appellate jurisdiction of this Court on any question of law arising on the"
"case stated (facts and  law determined by the TAC) for the opinion of the"
"Court of Appeal.  As noted, in the present case, the assessment was annulled"
"on the ground that the notice of assessment is invalid because it was not in"
"conformity  with  the  mandatory  requirements  under  section  194(1)  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act."
"[
105]  Aggrieved  by  the  said  annulment  of  the  assessment,  the  Appellant"
"preferred  an  appeal  by  way  of  case  stated  and  the  questions  of 
law"
