"assessor.    Thereafter,  the  taxpayer,  by  letter  dated  10.08.1977,  forwarded  a"
"statement disclosing an additional income and other information with a view to"
"finalising his income tax matters with an explanation for non-disclosure of this"
"additional income earlier. The taxpayer had another interview with the assessor"
"in  January  1978  and  in  October,  1978.  The  taxpayer  made  payments  towards"
"settling the liability arising from the additional income disclosed., but after the"
"interview with the Deputy Commssioner in October, 1978, the taxpayer received"
"no further communication."
"[37]  In  1979,  the  taxpayer  received  a  notice  of  assessment  dated  30.03.1979"
"showing a larger amount of assessable income and wealth than was returned or"
"declared by him and the said notice of assessment was posted on 21.04.1979."
"Under  such  circumstances,  the  taxpayer  sought  a  writ  of  certiorari  and/for"
"prohibition quashing this assessment. The Revenue (Respondents) relied on a"
"copy of a letter dated 04.04.1979 allegedly sent by the assessor to the taxpayer"
"stating  “reasons  for  rejecting  the  returns  and  accounts  have  already  been"
"intimated to you…” The Respondents were however, unable to prove that such"
"a letter was sent to the taxpayer, or to give evidence as to how and when the"
"letter was sent. The Respondents also filed an affidavit which stated, inter alia,"
"that “at these in his return and statement for the relevant year of assessment will"
"not be accepted”."
