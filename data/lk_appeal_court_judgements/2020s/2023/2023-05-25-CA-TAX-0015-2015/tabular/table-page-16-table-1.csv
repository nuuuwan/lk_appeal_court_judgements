"[
31] The The Respondent’s complaint is that (i) when the Respondent provided"
"an explanation by its letter dated 12.09.2008, the assessor did not explain the"
"requirements 
that 
the  Respondent  needs 
to 
satisfy 
to  qualify 
for 
the"
"exemption; (ii) the assessor did not give reasons  why the explanation cannot"
"be accepted and therefore, the letter dated 12.09.2008, cannot be the reasons"
"for issuing assessment. The Respondent further complains that the words “The"
"company has apparently not satisfied certain requirement necessary to qualify"
"for that exemption” in letter dated 02.09.2008 imply that the assessor was not"
"certain with regard to what are the requirements that the Respondent needs"
"to satisfy for the exemption. For those reasons, the Respondent argues that"
"the assessor has not communicated the reasons for not accepting the return"
"of under section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[32] It is crystal clear that the assessor by letter dated 02.09.2008  has provided"
"reasons as to why the investment does not qualify for the exemption under"
"section 21G of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended). By the said letter dated"
"02.09.2008, 
the  assessor  has  not  confirmed 
the 
rejection  but  given  an"
"opportunity  to  the  Respondent  to  give  his  clarification  with  regard  to    his"
"findings before 13.09.2008, but stated that unless no satisfactory explanation"
"is  given  before  that  date,  the  assessment  will  be 
issued  disallowing  the"
"exemptions. (see-the paragraph before the last sentence). The Respondent by"
"letter dated 12.09.2008 acknowledged the assessor’s letter dated 02.08.2008"
"and clarified the issues raised by the assessor by stating it is entitled to the"
"exemption under section 21G of the Inland Revenue Act (pp. 30-33 of the TAC"
"brief). The assessor did not accept the Respondent’s clarification stating that"
"they are not in line with the respective provisions."
"[33]  The  assessor 
thereafter,  by 
letter  dated  12.09.2008, 
informed 
the"
"Respondent  that  the  returns  were  not  accepted  as  per  the 
letter  dated"
"02.09.2008,  as  the  explanation  contained  in  the  letter  of  the  Respopndent"
"dated 12.09.2008 are not in line with the respective provisions. The said letter"
"dated 16.09.2008 (p. 36 of the TAC brief)."
"[34] It is crystal clear that the assessor by letter dated 02.09.2008 gave reasons"
"in  detail  for  the  rejection  of  the  returns  and  by  the  second  letter  dated"
"16.09.2008  confirmed  the  rejection  of  the  return  of  income  referring  to  the"
"letter dated 02.09.2008, which provided reasons in detail.  The TAC in holding"
