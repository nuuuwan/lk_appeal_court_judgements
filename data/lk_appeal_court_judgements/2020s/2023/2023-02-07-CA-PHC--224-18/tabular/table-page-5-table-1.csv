"However, it is settled law that Section 68 (3) becomes applicable only if the Judge"
"of the Primary Court can come to a definite finding that some other party had been"
"forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on"
"which  the  information  was  filed  under  Section  66  of  the  Act  [Ramalingam  Vs."
"Thangarajah 1982 2SLR 693]. This position has been cited in the recent Judgment"
"of  Ranjith  Mervyn  Ponnamperuma  Vs.  Warahena  Liayanage  Viraj  Pradeep"
"Kumara De Alwis and Others [CA PHC 71/2008], decided on 12.06.2020."
"It is in evidence that premises in dispute was occupied by 1st and 2nd Appellants and"
"the mother of the 1st Appellant after the demise of their father."
"According to the statement made by the 1st Appellant on 16.05.2013 to Baddegama"
"Police Station, the 1st Appellant had been living in the disputed premises with his"
"mother and had left the disputed premises on 18.03.2013 after quarrelling with his"
"mother. Thereafter, his mother had continued to live in the premises in dispute and"
"later  the  mother also  had  left  the  premises  in  dispute  due  to  many  interruptions"
"made by the 1st and 2nd Appellants."
"Since  the  Respondent  had  to  keep  the  premises  occupied,  the  Respondent  had"
"placed  a  caretaker,  namely  one  T.G.  Dayananda,  to  look  after  the  premises  in"
"question. The 1st Appellant had attacked the said T.G. Dayananda who was looking"
"after  the  premises  and  he  had  been  admitted  to  the  Intensive  Care  Unit  at  the"
"Karapitiya Hospital upon sustaining severe injuries. This resulted in a non-occupancy"
"of the premises in question."
"However, the Respondent had padlocked the premises in dispute to keep the 1st and"
"2nd Appellants away. It is observable that 1st Appellant neither accepted nor denied"
"the  occupancy  of  the  premises  in  question  by  the  said  T.G.  Dayananda  and  the"
"Appellants had taken a silent position in this regard."
"Furthermore,  keys  to  the  premises  in  dispute  were  not  in  the  possession  of  the"
"Appellants  throughout  this  sequence  of  events  and  the  1st  Appellant  himself  has"
"stated that his mother refused to give him the keys to the premises in dispute."
"It is worthy to note the statement made by the 1st Appellant on 16.05.2013 to the"
"Baddegama Police Station;"
