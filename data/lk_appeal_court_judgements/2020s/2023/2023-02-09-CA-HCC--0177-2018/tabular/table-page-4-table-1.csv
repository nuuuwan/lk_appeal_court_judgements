"Appellant, the learned High Court Judge called for the defence. The Appellant"
"gave a statement from the dock and called two witnesses including his wife"
"in support of his case. Thereafter the prosecution had called witness PW13"
"in rebuttal."
"In  every  criminal  case  the  burden  is  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  case"
"beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this nature"
"the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt but"
"also  ensure,  with  cogent  evidence  that  the  Appellant  had  committed  the"
"offence."
"In this case I consider it is prudent to address the appeal ground challenging"
"the chain of production which is very vital aspect in drug related offences. In"
"the third ground of appeal the Counsel contended that the prosecution has"
"failed to prove the chain of production beyond reasonable doubt."
"Proving the chain of production is a very important task for the prosecution"
"in a drug related case. If investigating officers do not do their duty properly,"
"the chain of production can be successfully challenged in the trial. This is"
"because the prosecution always relies on evidence gathered by police officers"
"in cases of this nature."
