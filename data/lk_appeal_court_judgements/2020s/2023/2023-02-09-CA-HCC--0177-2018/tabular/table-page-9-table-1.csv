"by the Appellant creates a reasonable doubt over the prosecution case, I set"
"aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  of  Colombo  dated  16/11/2018  on  the  Appellant.  Therefore,  he  is"

"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
