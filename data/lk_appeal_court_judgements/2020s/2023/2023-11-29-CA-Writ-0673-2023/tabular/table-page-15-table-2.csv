"Now, I will draw my attention to Section 4 and 5 of the Arbitration Act, No."
"11 of 19951. The said Sections read as follows;"
"‘Any dispute which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration"
"under  an  arbitration  agreement  may  be  determined  by  arbitration"
"unless  the  matter  in  respect  of  which  the  arbitration  agreement  is"
"entered 
into 
is  contrary 
to  public  policy  or, 
is  not  capable  of"
"determination by arbitration.’2"
"‘Where 
a 
party 
to 
an 
arbitration 
agreement 
institutes 
legal"
"proceedings  in  a  court  against  another  party  to  such  agreement  in"
"respect of a matter agreed to be submitted for arbitration under such"
"agreement, 
the  Court  shall  have  no 
jurisdiction 
to  hear  and"
"determine  such  matter 
if 
the  other  party  objects 
to 
the  court"
"exercising jurisdiction in respect of such matter.’3"
