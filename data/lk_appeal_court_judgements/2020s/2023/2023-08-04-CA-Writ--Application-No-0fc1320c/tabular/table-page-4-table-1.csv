"Legality of the Forfeiture of Ceramic Items"
"The Petitioners argue that the Customs authorities had resorted to forfeiting the ceramic"
"items instead of mitigating the forfeiture based on the wrongful assumption that a license"
"from the Import Control Department must be produced in respect of the imported goods"
"and that the Petitioners had failed to produce any such license. However, it is apparent"
"that the said items were forfeited primarily on the basis that such items were not declared"
"under the provisions of the Customs Ordinance. Whether an item is licensable or not is"
"immaterial  when  forfeiting  any  imported  goods  if  the  items  imported  have  not  been"
"declared to the Customs authorities in the first place. Hence, the applicability of Regulation"
"4 of the Gazette Extraordinary marked X5 is immaterial in the given instance since there"
"already  were  sufficient  grounds  for  the  forfeiture  of  the  ceramic  items  as  they  were"
"undeclared. Thus, I am of the view that the Petitioners have been misdirected in law in"
"submitting that the said Gazette Extraordinary marked X5 shall be applicable in the given"
"circumstances."
