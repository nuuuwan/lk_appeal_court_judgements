"context. The Petitioners submit that the Director General of Customs can mitigate any type"
"of forfeiture irrespective of the gravity of the forfeiture at his discretion if he deems such"
"forfeiture or penalty as unduly severe in terms of Section 163 of the Ordinance."
"163. In all cases in which under this Ordinance any ships, boats, conveyances, goods, or other things"
"have become liable to forfeiture or shall have been forfeited, and in all cases in which any person"
"shall have incurred or become liable to any penalty, it shall be lawful for the Director-General, should"
"he deem such forfeiture or penalty unduly severe, to mitigate the same; but all cases so determined"
"by the Director-General shall nevertheless be liable to revision by the Minister. (Emphasis added)"
