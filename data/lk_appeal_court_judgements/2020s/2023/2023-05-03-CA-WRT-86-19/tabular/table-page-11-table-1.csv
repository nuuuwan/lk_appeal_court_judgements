"T
he  doctrine  of  frustration  could  not  be  applied  here  for  the  reasons"
"stated above, and thus I hold that this is not a cessation of employment"
"as captioned in the letter P7(b), but termination of employment of the"
"respondents 4 to 15 by the petitioner. As the termination of employment"
"is not in accordance with Section 2 of the Act, I hold further that it is"
"an  unlawful  termination  of  employment.  In  the  circumstances,  the"
"petitioner  company  is  liable  to  pay  compensation  to  the  4th  to  15th"
"respondents as correctly determined by the commissioner of labour in"
"a situation where reinstatement was not possible."
