"the  construction  of  a  building.  If  the  petitioner  has  constructed  a  building"
"having  a  permit  to  do  so,  he  should  have  also  possessed  a  certificate  of"
"conformity from the Municipal Council. However, the petitioner has failed to"
"produce  a  certificate  of  conformity  or  any  letter  to  that  effect  issued  by  the"
"Municipal  Council.    The  position  of  the  1st  and  6th  respondents  is  that  the"
"building constructed by the petitioner is an unauthorized construction.    The"
"petitioner has failed to produce evidence to show that he has ever obtained a"
"permit from the 1st respondent for the construction. The petitioners have not"
"followed the law in this regard."
