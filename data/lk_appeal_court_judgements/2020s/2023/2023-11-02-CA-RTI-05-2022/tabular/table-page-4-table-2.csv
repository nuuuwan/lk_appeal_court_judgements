"CA/RTI/01/2020, CA minute 28.06.2023 where the following was held:",""
"","“Another  justification  for  this  view  of  the  Court  is  that,  in  general,  a  tribunal  or"
"","commission that decides disputes between two parties would not be made a party"
"","in  a  higher  appeal  forum  or  court.  The  purpose  of  an  appeal  is  to  review  the"
"","decisions made by the lower tribunal or  commission, and  the parties involved in"
"","the original dispute are typically the ones who bring the appeal and are considered"
"","the  parties  in  the  higher  appeal  forum  or  court.  The  commission  itself  would  not"
"","typically be directly involved as a party in the appeal process. When a commission"
"","or tribunal delivers its order, it is considered functus officio, meaning its jurisdiction"
"","over  the matter is exhausted.  If  an  appeal  is  available  against  the commission’s"
"","order,  the  aggrieved  party  may  initiate  the  appeal  process  in  the  higher  court  or"
"","forum according to the proper procedure. In this scenario, the RTI Commission is"
"","not typically required to defend its own determination before the Court of Appeal"
"","or it is not so required by the RTI Act. The appeal process focuses on reviewing the"
"","decision  made  by  the  RTI  Commission  based  on  the  evidence  and  material  that"
"was  presented","to 
them  during 
the  proceedings  before 
the  commission.  This"
"","examination  involves  the  scrutiny  of  the  acts  of  the  Public  Authority,  or  the  lack"
"","thereof, in determining whether the rights provided under the applicable law have"
"","been protected by the Public Authority and to make a direction accordingly.”"
