"pertinent to highlight that the RTI law expects independent, transparent, impartial, and"
"unbiased decisions from all the officers who hold custody of information. This, however,"
"does  not  mean  that  access  to  information  can  be  granted  without  imposing  any"
"limitations. Hence, there has to be an equilibrium between the two possible courses of"
"action."
"Accordingly, the equilibrium between granting access to information and denying access"
"to information has to be maintained to safeguard the constitutionally guaranteed rights"
"of  the  citizens  while  upholding  the  spirit  of  the  RTI  Act.  Therefore,  the  Information"
"Officer at the primary stage, the Designated Officer at the secondary stage, and the RTI"
"Commission at the tertiary stage are required to maintain a balance between the rights"

"intervene.  One  of  the  major  reasons  for  intervention  was  to  assist  this  Court  in  the"
"appeal  process.  However,  it  is  the  opinion  of  this  Court  that  as  the  Commission  is"
"required to state reasons for its decisions (as per Section 32 of the Act) the Commission"
"is not called upon a second time to defend its reasoning.  Hence, the Commission is not"
"required to justify its reasoning a second time during the appeal process (they may be"
"called upon to do so during a Writ application, a point which will be discussed later in"
"this Order).  In any event, this Court is empowered to call any records or documents"
"from  the  Commission,  if  necessary,  as  per Article  145  of  the  Constitution,  hence  the"
