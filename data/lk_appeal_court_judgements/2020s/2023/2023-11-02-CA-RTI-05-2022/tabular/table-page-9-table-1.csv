"Commission  is  not  required  to  be  made  a  party  to  the  dispute  in  order  to  assist  the"
"Court by providing necessary records or documents as averred by the Commission."
"Moreover, the counsel for the intervenient petitioners has stated, that the Commission"
"seeks to intervene in the appeal process to ensure that, in the event of either party being"
"absent  or  unrepresented,  the  material  facts  of  the  case  will  be  duly  disclosed  to  the"
"court.  In  this  regard,  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  even  if  a  party  is  absent  or"
"unrepresented in the appeal process, the Commission is not expected to safeguard the"
"rights of such party, nor does this Court expect the Commission to defend the rights of"
"one party. This is in consideration of the fact that the Act expects the Commission to"
"maintain impartiality when the dispute is concerned. Further to this point, it would be"
"pertinent  to  add  that  the  purpose  of  an  appeal  is  to  have  an  impartial  and  objective"
"review  of  the  Commission’s  decision.  Allowing  the  Commission  to  be  a  party  could"
"introduce  bias  or  a  conflict  of  interest,  making  it  challenging  to  ensure  a  fair  and"
"independent  review.  Therefore,  to  ensure  a  seamless  and  unbiased  review  of  the"
"Commission’s  decision  by  this  Court  as  a  higher  forum  tasked  with  providing  an"
"objective review, the Commission is not required to be made a party to the appeal."
"Moreover, the interpretation of the applicable provisions of the Act does not envision the"
"involvement of the Commission during the appeal process before this Court. According"
"to Section 34(1) of the Act, any party aggrieved by the decision of the Commission may"
"appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal.  Section  34  (1)  stipulates  that:  “(1)  A  citizen  or  public"
"authority  who  is  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the  Commission  made  under  section  32,"
"may appeal against such decision to the Court of Appeal within one month of the date on"
"which such decision was communicated to such citizen or public authority.”"
"Thus,  according  to  the  procedure  laid  down  in  the  Act,  any  party  aggrieved  by  the"
"Commission’s decision may make an appeal application to this Court. That is to say,"
"either  the  aggrieved  Public Authority or  the  Appellant  who  requested  the information"
"may appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, this process as envisioned under Section"
"34 of the Act does not require the Commission to be made a party to the dispute."
"It is further noted by this Court that Section 11 of the Act has awarded the Commission"
"a legal personality “that can sue and be sued in its corporate name”. However, this does"
