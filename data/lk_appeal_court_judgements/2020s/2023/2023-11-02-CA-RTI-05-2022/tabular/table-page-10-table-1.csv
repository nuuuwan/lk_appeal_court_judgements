"not imply that it is mandatory to make the Commission a party  to every appeal  filed"
"against its order. Therefore, since an appeal filed under Section 34(1) of the Act does"
"not  require  or  provide  for  the  active  participation  of  the  Commission  in  an  appeal"
"process, the Commission is not required to intervene in an appeal process. Moreover, if"
"such  an application is allowed, it  will  subvert the general practice  concerning  appeal"
"mechanisms  established  under  other  areas  of  law  such  as  Tax  appeals  and  similar"
"appeals where neither the Tax Appeal Commission nor the such authority is named as"
"a party."
"Consequently, this Court opines that, as per the prevailing legal framework, there exists"
"no  mandate  necessitating  the  Commission  to  be  added  as  a  party  to  the  appellate"
"proceedings. Instead, the Commission may be added as a party for the sole purpose of"
"receiving notice of said appeal, without entitlement or obligation for active participation"
"in the appellate process, which is not mandatory."
"At this juncture, this Court takes note of the nature of the application itself to decide"
"that the intervention of the Commission in this appeal process is unnecessary. In order"
"to elaborate this point, one could refer to the distinction between an appeal process and"
"the process involved in a writ application."
"An appeal is a legal process where a higher court reviews a decision made by a lower"
"court  or  judicial  body.  This  process  is  governed  by  statutes  or  laws  that  outline  the"
"procedures for challenging a decision. In an appeal, the parties involved in the original"
"case  (e.g.,  plaintiff  and  defendant)  are  typically  the  parties  in  the  appeal.  The  higher"
"court reviews the case based on errors in law, procedure, or application of facts. Writ"
"jurisdiction, on the other hand, involves the ability of a higher court to issue writs, such"
"as mandamus, certiorari, habeas corpus, quo warranto, or prohibition. The purpose of"
"a writ is  to ensure  that justice is served and that the lower authority  acts within  the"
"bounds of its jurisdiction and follows the correct legal procedures."
"The  appeal  primarily  involves  the  parties  from  the  original  case.  However,  in  writ"
"jurisdiction, the  judicial institution becomes a party to the application,  as the writ  is"
"directly addressed to  the institution or the  individual exercising authority,  seeking  to"
"correct any procedural mistake or jurisdictional error. Further, in response to an appeal,"
