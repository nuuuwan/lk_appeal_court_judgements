"by the actual parties to the case. In summary, maintaining a clear separation between"
"the parties to the original case and the Commission in the appeal process helps uphold"
"the adversarial system, preserves the hierarchical structure of the judiciary, ensures an"
"objective review, promotes efficiency, and allocates responsibilities appropriately."
"Conclusion"
"In  conclusion,  this  Court  finds  that  in  appeals  filed  under  Section  34(1)  of  the  Act,"
"naming the commission as a respondent is not mandatory. Even if any party chooses to"
"involve the Commission as a party, it should be limited to providing notice of such an"
"appeal. The law does not mandate or grant the Commission the right to be added as a"
"party to file objections and defend its own decision."
"Therefore, in the present application, where the Commission seeks to intervene and be"
"added as a party to file objections, it is the considered view of this Court that such an"
"application cannot be allowed."
"Intervention application is dismissed."
