"aforementioned field visit report reveals that it includes, to a greater degree, only the views",""
"and  recommendations  of  various  participating  government  officials.  I  am  puzzled  by  the",""
"recommendation  therein  to  acquire  the  land  of  the  Petitioner  as  a  consequence  of  her",""
"application for permission to put up a dwelling.",""
"The view expressed by the Divisional Secretary of Hingurakgoda in the said Report is that no",""
"permission could be granted in favour of the Petitioner.  However, no legal basis has been",""
"disclosed to that effect by the said Divisional Secretary. In the meantime, the Project Legal",""
"Consultant  queries  whether  the  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation  has  the  power  to",""
"regulate  the  other  institutions  whose  approval  may  be  required  to  grant  permission  for  a",""
"development  activity.  The  said  Legal  Consultant  has  observed","in  the  Report  that  the"
"Petitioner  owned  about  ten  acres  of  land  and  an  opportunity  should  be  accorded  to  the",""
"Petitioner  to  put  up  a  structure  using  either  planks  or  stilts.  He  further  opines  that  not",""
"permitting such a structure would cause prejudice to the long-standing title of the Petitioner",""
"and accordingly he recommends granting an opportunity for the Petitioner provided there is",""
"no legal barrier to that effect. Anyhow the representative of the legal division of the relevant",""
"Department and the Director (Reservation Management) have stated in the Report that the",""
"Petitioner should not be allowed to put up a house at the relevant location. One of the reasons",""
"raised by the said two officers was on the pretext that the other landowners of the area would",""
"also tend to make similar applications. The same view has been illustrated in clause 4.21 of",""
"the impugned letter ‘P38’. Moreover, I am unable to find a nexus between the said Ordinance",""
"and the alleged zone referred to in the said report by the name “Praeyrana” (ප්‍රේරන කලාපය)",""
"and  thus,  I  am  not  inclined  to  accept  any  vocabulary  used  by  the  officials  on  their  own",""
"assumptions or for their mere convenience. No reasonable explanation has been given as to",""
"how they have derived the word ‘ප්‍රේරන කලාපය’.",""
"The  primary  defense  taken  by  the  1st  Respondent  to  justify  his  decision  not  to  allow  the",""
"construction commenced by the Petitioner emanates upon the buffer zone of the Minneriya",""
"National  Park.  The  1st Respondent  contends  that  the  subject  land  which  is claimed  by  the",""
"Petitioner is located within the said buffer zone. On the contrary, the aforementioned report",""
"indicates that the area in which the subject land is located is a wildlife habitat. Anyhow, this",""
"court has not received sufficient proof as to whether the subject area is a designated buffer",""
