"out  with  the  approval  of  the  relevant  authorities  within  the  area  adjoining  the  Petitioner’s"
"private land. The Petitioner contends that such construction including houses and buildings"
"is clearly reflected by the photographs marked ‘P39(a)’ to ‘P39(h)’. Generally, fairness is when"
"everyone is treated equally and no one is left out.  I take the view that the Director- General"
"when exercising his powers under section 9A is required to strike a balance, lawfully, between"
"the procedure laid down in section 9A and the rules of fairness. However, I need not lengthen"
"this judgement by analyzing the Petitioner's said second argument in a detailed manner as I"
"have already found that the impugned documents ‘P27’ and ‘P38’ are liable to be quashed."
"In light of the above, I proceed to grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari"
"quashing the decisions reflected in the documents marked ‘P27’ and ‘P38’. Anyhow, I am not"
"inclined to issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus as prayed for in the prayer of"
"the petition, as seeking such relief by the Petitioner certainly goes against her own stand that"
"the  1st  Respondent  has  not  followed  the  proper  procedure  when  refusing  the  Petitioner’s"
"application.  It  is  an  admitted  fact  by  the  Petitioner  that  in  terms  of  section  9A  of  the  said"
"Ordinance, no person or organization, whether private or state shall within a distance of one"
"mile of the boundary of any National Reserve declared by an order made under section 2,"
"conduct any development activity of any description whatsoever, without obtaining the prior"
"written approval (Vide- Paragraph 23 and 25 of the Petition). Based on all the circumstances"
"of this case I need to make an observation that the 1st Respondent is duty-bound to evaluate"
"any  fresh  application  under  section  9A  of  the  Ordinance  in  respect  of  the  subject  land"
"according to law."
