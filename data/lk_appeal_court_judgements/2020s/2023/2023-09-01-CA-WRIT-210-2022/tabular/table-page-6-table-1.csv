"Secondly,  the  Petitioner  asserts  that  there  are  several  houses  and  buildings  located  in  the"
"blocks of land adjacent to that owned by the Petitioner. It is further stated that even at present"
"certain constructions are being carried out with the approval of the relevant authorities, within"
"the area of land adjoining the Petitioner's private land. The Petitioner complains that the 1st"
"Respondent while refusing permission for the Petitioner to construct a dwelling in her land"
"has  failed  to  take  any  steps  against  the  aforesaid  constructions.  Out  of  the  two  points"
"mentioned  above  the  Petitioner’s  cogent  argument  is  that  the  decisions  reflected  in  the"
"impugned documents marked ‘P37’ and ‘P38’ are contrary to law, as the relevant authorities"
"have failed to adhere to the procedure stipulated in the section 9A when they refused to grant"
"permission in respect of the Petitioners request. Now I must examine the effect of section 9A"
"of  the  Ordinance  upon  the  Petitioner’s  request  for  permission  to  put  up  a  dwelling  house"
"within the subject land."
"Section 9A of the Ordinance imposes restrictions on development activity within a distance"
"of one mile of the boundary of any National Reserve. As per the interpretation section [72(1)]"
"a “development activity” means any activity which has an impact on the physical nature of"
"the  land  or  the  natural  biological  phenomenon  of  fauna  and  flora  of  such  land”.  The"
"provisions of section 9A (1) are subject to section 3A (1) which stipulates that no person shall,"
"within one mile of the boundary of a National Reserve, construct a tourist hotel or provide"
"any services or facilities similar to the services or facilities provided by a tourist hotel. It is"
"paramount to note that the permission sought by the Petitioner was to only put up a dwelling"
"house."
