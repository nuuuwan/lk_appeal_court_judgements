"T
hus,  I  take  the  view  that  the  1st  Respondent  has  not  adopted  a  lawful  mechanism  in"
"arriving  at  the  impugned  decision,  especially  in  reference  to  the  question  whether  the"
"relationship between such members and the life insurance institutions are in the nature of"
"contract  for  services/independent  contractors.  Even  this  Court  is  unable  to  assess  and"
"determine  whether  the  members  of  the  2nd  Respondent-Association  come  within  the"
"definition of 'workman' in the Ordinance as there are no evidence before Court to make"
"such determination."
"In the above-mentioned case of Construction Industry Training Board vs. Labour Force Ltd.,"
"Fisher J. has further observed that the question whether a contract is one of service or is a"
"contract  for  services  is  a  question  of  fact.  He  has  further  stated  that  it  is,  'however,  a"
"question of law what are the right tests to be applied in determining whether a contract"
"falls into the one or the other class, and a decision of the tribunal could be upset by this"
"Court if it was of the opinion that the tribunal had applied the wrong tests, in other words"
"had misdirected itself in law,...'"
"Based on the above circumstances, I am inclined to issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the"
"decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  reflected  in  letter  dated  28.10.2021  ('P5')  and  also  the"
"decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  to  register  the  2nd  Respondent-Association  under  the"
"Ordinance. In light of the above, I proceed further to issue a writ of Mandamus directing"
"the 1st Respondent to delete and/or expunge from the Registrar of the Trade Unions, the"
"registration of the 2nd Respondent Association as a Trade Union and also to cancel the"
"respective certificate of registration."
"Application is allowed."
