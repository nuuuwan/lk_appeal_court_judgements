"It is an accepted norm that a person who engages in contract for service or an independent"
"contractor cannot be considered as a regular employee of the person who obtains services"
"(principal party). On a careful perusal of the above interpretation section, it appears that"
"the contract for services is excluded from the said definition. The maxim expressio unius est"
"exclusio alterius (a Latin term literally meaning ""the expression of one thing is the exclusion"
"of the other"") can be adopted here to further clarify my above finding as the said Section"
"has  specifically  used  the  words  'contract  of  service'.  Then  it  is  the  prime  duty  of  the"
"Registrar  of  Trade  Union  (1st  Respondent)  to  independently  be  satisfied  whether  the"
"members of the Association who seek registration come within the definition of workmen."
