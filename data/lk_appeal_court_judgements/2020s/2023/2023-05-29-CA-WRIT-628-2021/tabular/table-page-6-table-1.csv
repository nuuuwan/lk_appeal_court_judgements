"insurer  or  broker  rather  than  drawing  a  salary  periodically  should  be  considered  as  an"
"insurance  agent  under  our  law.  The  interpretation  given  in  the  said  Regulations  of"
"Insurance  Industry  Act  and  the  Rules  made  thereunder,  draw  a  clear  inference  that  a"
"service contract between the insurance agent and insurer should be assumed as a contract"
"for services and not as a contract of service. Anyhow, I take the view that such contract"
"cannot  be  assumed  as  a  contract  for  service  if  such  insurance  agent  gains  additional"
"benefits such as promotions, payments in the mode of a salary or increments thereto or"
"hold designations in the company cadre etc. In other words, the nature of the relationship"
"between the insurance agent and the insurer/broker may convert the relevant contract to"
"a contract of service from the state of contract for service. Certainly, the true nature of the"
"contract  can  be  ascertained  by  employing  the  above  tests  such  as  the  control  test,"
"integration test etc."
"In view of the above judicial precedent and the legal jurisprudence which paved way to"
"identify the types of employment, it appears that an employee cannot be classified as an"
"insurance agent/casual employee/temporary employee/seasonal employee/apprentice/"
"trainee based on a mere format of a written agreement or on a verbal contract. In other"
"words, in order to identify and understand the true nature of such employment, it is not"
"sufficient to specify the category of employment in the contract but it needs an assessment"
"based on the true relationship between the employer and the employee. Thus, a mere label"
"of an 'insurance agent' cannot be considered as an accessory to assess whether such agent"
"would come within the definition of workmen stipulated in the said Ordinance."
"'A  workman  is  governed  by  a  contract  of  service  and  an  independent  contractor  is"
"governed by contract for service. However, the decision as to the nature of the contract to"
"identify  whether  a  person  providing  services  to  an  organization  is  a  workman  under  a"
"contract  of  service  or  an  independent  contractor  under  a  contract  for  service  becomes"
"difficult with globalization, changes in employment methods, flexibilities in employment,"
"developments  in  science  and  technology  and  the  devices  designed  by  employers  to"
"circumvent their obligations. In many cases, employers who have power to include clauses"
"favourable for them due to unequal bargaining power between the parties have included"
"designations  such  as  self-employed  persons,  agents,  consultants,  free-lancers  and  sub-"
"contractors to label the workmen as independent contractors with the belief that they could"
"circumvent  their  statutory  obligations'.  (Vide-  A.  Sarveswaran,  'Who  is  a  Workman?  A"
