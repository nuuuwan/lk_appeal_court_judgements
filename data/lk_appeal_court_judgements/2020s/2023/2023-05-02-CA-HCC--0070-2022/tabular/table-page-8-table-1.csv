"In Dharma Sri Tissa Kumara Wijenaike v. The Attorney General (supra)"
"the court further held that:"
"“In such cases, it would be incumbent upon the judge to set out, with"
"clarity, all the reasons which are relevant and salient for not imposing"
"the mandatory statutory minimum period of 7 years or in the case of a"
"person under 18 years, a mandatory period of 10 years, and the court"
"would have the power to do so as only where the accused is under 16"
"years of age, as the court in its capacity of the upper guardian of each"
"and every child has  the  inherent power  to consider such matters  and"
"reduce the statutorily mandated minimum sentence.”"
