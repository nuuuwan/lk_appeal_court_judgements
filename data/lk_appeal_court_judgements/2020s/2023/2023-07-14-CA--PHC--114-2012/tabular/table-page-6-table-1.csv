"As such, it is also a matter to be determined by a civil court whether the Appellants can claim a"
"servitudanal right by way of necessity or prescription."
"The attention of court was drawn to the affidavit given by one Mahadurage Namaratne [marked"
"as 2ව1]. According to the said affidavit the land occupied by the Appellants is a state land called"
"Walaemba Mukulana in extent of 3 ½ acres."
"The said Namaratne had enjoyed the property since 1990 and has handed over the same to the"
"Appellants for them to apply for a permit in their name from the state. Subsequently, Appellants"
"started enjoying the property since 1999."
"It is seen that, the only access road to the said land enjoyed by the Appellants, lay over the land"
"belonging to the Respondents."
"Nevertheless,  the  Respondents  have  taken  up  the  position  that  the  said  land  occupied  by  the"
"Appellants were not owned by them and it is a state land. Thus, the Respondents contended that"
"the dominant land is a state land, and no prescription will run against a state land even though the"
"Appellants have possessed the same for well over 10 years."
"In  this  respect,  it  is  worthy  to  note  that  the  Appellants  are  claiming  a  right  of  way  over  the"
"Respondents land and not claiming a prescriptive title over the state land."
"Although the dominant land is a state land, it is not a matter to be considered in terms of section"
"66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, since question regarding title of land does not arise."
"The order of the court made in actions instituted under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure"
"Act  are  provisional  orders,  made  to  resolve  the  dispute  temporarily  to  preserve  the  peace"
"between/among the Parties."
"It appears that the learned Magistrate held that no resident, occupying an unauthorised land can"
"claim a servitudanal right by way of prescription."
"It is settled law that under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the Primary Court Judge"
"has no jurisdiction to question or determine the title of the disputed land or the land relating to the"
"dispute."
"Therefore, it is imperative to note that the learned Magistrate had come to an erroneous conclusion"
"that the Appellants are precluded by claiming a right of way over the Respondents land."
