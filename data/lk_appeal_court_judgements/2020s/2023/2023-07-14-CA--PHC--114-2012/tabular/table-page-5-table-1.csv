"It  was  further  submitted  that  the  pathway  which  was  originally  used  by  the  Appellants  was"
"closed by the Respondents and thereafter a new pathway was provided from the same land and"
"the dispute arose after the said new pathway was closed."
"It was the contention of the Appellants that they have been enjoying the disputed pathway as a"
"right of way in the nature of a servitude and the said right has been created by enjoying the same"
"since 1990 by the predecessor of the Appellants up-to date."
"Thus,  the  learned  Magistrate  and  the  learned  high  Court  Judge  had  failed  to  consider  the"
"aforesaid affidavit marked 2ව1, and the Appellants have the right to use the disputed pathway"
"since 1990."
"Furthermore, it was submitted that Gramaniladari has reported in his report that he was aware"
"that the Appellants were enjoying the right of way over Dayawathi’s land."
"Moreover, the Appellants submitted that their supporting affidavits demonstrate that Appellant"
"did not have an alternative roadway other than the disputed pathway."
"However,  it  is  imperative  to  note  that  according  to  the  Appellants  the  roadway  which  was"
"originally  used  was  closed  by  the  Respondents.  Afterwards,  Respondents  provided  a  new"
"pathway. Thus, it seems that the Respondents had given license to the Appellants to use the new"
"pathway."
"The section 72 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act stipulates that,"
