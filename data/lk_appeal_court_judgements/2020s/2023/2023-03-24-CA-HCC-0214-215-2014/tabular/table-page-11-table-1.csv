"In S. Fernando v. H. De Silva 68 NLR 166 the court held that:"
"“In order to sustain the charge based on common intention it is essential"
"that both the accused persons must have participated in the offence, in"
"the sense that they must be physically present at or about the scene of"
"offence”."
"Although the accused did not commit any physical act, yet liability could be"
"imposed on him on the basis that his presence was a participatory presence."
"All these are generally established through circumstantial evidence."
"In this case, when 2nd and 4th accused held the deceased, the 1st Appellant"
"had shot the deceased. At that time, the 2nd Appellant went on to swing the"
"sword on PW2 which was missed twice. This reiterates that the 2nd Appellant"
"was an active participant to the crime."
"Although the Learned High Court Judge did not discuss the law pertaining"
"to common intention in the judgment but had considered and satisfied the"
"participation of the Appellants and the accused in committing the murder of"
"the deceased. The relevant portion is re-produced below:"
"(Page 391 of the brief.)"

"As  this  has  not  caused  any  prejudice  to  the  2nd  Appellant,  this  ground  of"
"appeal also devoid any merit."
"In this case, although the Learned High Court Judge had wrongly used the"
"Lucas Principle to reject the dock statement of the 2nd Appellant, it has not"
"caused any prejudice to his right to a fair trial."
