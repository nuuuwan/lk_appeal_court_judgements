"a violation of their legitimate expectation.1 Nevertheless, as per Circular marked as P-"
"21, the Petitioners are not entitled to vehicle permits even though they were eligible for"

"expectation reasonably entertained by a person  may not be considered as legitimate"
"because of some countervailing consideration of policy or law. Further, clear statutory"
"words override any expectation howsoever founded. Where an expectation is founded"
