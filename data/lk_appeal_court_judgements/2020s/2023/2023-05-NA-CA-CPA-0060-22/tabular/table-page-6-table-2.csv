"For better understanding of the said Regulation, I will now reproduce it, which"
"reads as follows."
"27.  (1)  The  Minister  may  make  regulations  under  this  Act  for  the"
"purpose  of  carrying  out  or  giving  effect  to  the  principles  and"
"provisions of this Act."
"(2) Every regulation made by the Minister shall be published in the"
"Gazette and shall come to operation on the date of such publication"
"or on such later date as may be specified in the regulation."
"(3) Every regulation made by the Minister shall as soon as convenient"
"after its publication in the Gazette be brought before the Parliament"
"for  its  approval.  Any  regulation  which  is  not  so  approved  shall  be"
"deemed to be rescinded as from the date of disapproval but without"
"prejudice to anything previously done thereunder. Notification of the"
"date  on  which  a  regulation  is  deemed  to  be  rescinded  shall  be"
"published in the Gazette."
