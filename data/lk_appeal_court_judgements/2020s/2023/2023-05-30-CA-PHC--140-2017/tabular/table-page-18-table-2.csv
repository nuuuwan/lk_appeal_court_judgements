"The aforementioned observation is supported by the following dictum in, Perera et al v"
"Gunetilike et al 4 NLR.181 p, where His Lordship Bonser C.J. held that:"
"“In a country like this any attempt of parties to use force in the maintenance of their"
"rights should be promptly discouraged, slight brawls readily blossom into riots with"
"grievous hurt and murder as the fruits. It is therefore all the more necessary that"
"courts should be strict in discountenancing all attempts to use force in the assertion"
"of such civil rights as are in dispute in the present case.” [Emphasis added]."
