"In King Vs. Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505, it was held,"
"“Failure on the part of a prisoner or his counsel to take up a certain line of"
"defence  does  not  relieve  the  judge  of  the responsibility  of  putting  the  jury"
"such defence if it arises on the evidence.”"
"I do not find any evidence in the case record to come to such a conclusion by the"
"learned trial Judge. Besides that, the JMO’s evidence is very much clear that the"
"injuries  caused  to  the  deceased  child  who  was  9  years  at  that  time  were"
"essentially fatal under the given context."
"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  correctly  analyzed  the  evidence"
"placed before the Court and had come to a correct finding in that regard when"
"the appellant was convicted for murder in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  ground  of  appeal"
"urged on behalf of the appellant."
"Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the"
"sentence affirmed."
"Judge of the Court of Appeal"
"P Kumararatnam, J."
"I agree."
