"It 
is  submitted 
in  paragraph  90  of 
the  written  submissions  of 
the  04th"
"respondent, that,"
"“…if NSB is allowed to continue as a party in the said legal proceedings, it"
"would constitute a major interference with the activities of the liquidator"
"of  Entrust  Securities  PLC  and  such  would  seriously 
jeopardize  and"
"endanger E. R. Gnanam’s chances of recovering her funds”."
"However,  as  per  the  written  submissions  of  the  petitioner  the  petitioner  was"
"appointed  as  the  Central  Bank  noticed  that  there  had  been  some  dubious"
"transactions and there are question marks whether actually the money came in"
"by some purported creditors, which are matters to be investigated."
"Neither  the  Monetary  Board  of  the  Central  Bank,  nor  the  other  purported"
"creditors,  or  HNB  Finance  PLC,  the  petitioner  in  the  winding  up  case  have"
"objected to the NSB being heard."
"The  petitioner  has  further  submitted  that  there  is  no  clear  demarcation  as  to"
"who 
is  not  a  party  to  winding  up  proceedings.  As  said  already  the  04th"
"respondent’s purported authorities too do not show that a person who has been"
"in the capacity of a “managerial agent” is prevented from being heard."
"It is also submitted that NSB is an interested and vital party which has much"
"information to share both with the court and the Liquidator and it must not be"
"shut out."
"The petitioner also cites, at paragraph 22 of the written submissions, the case of"
"Budhdadasa Kaluarachchi vs. Nilamani Wijewickrema and another [1990] 1 SLR"
"262, at 268, that,"
"“The trend of recent decisions is that the Court of Appeal has the power"
"to act in revision eventhough the procedure by way of appeal is available"
"in appropriate cases”."
