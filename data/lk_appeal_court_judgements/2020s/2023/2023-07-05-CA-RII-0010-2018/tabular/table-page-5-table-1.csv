"an  order  cannot  be  set  aside  under  section  87(3).  The  remedy  of  the"
"plaintiff 
is  a 
final  appeal….Don  Gamini  Abeysundara  vs.  Malalage"
"Gunapala, C. A. No. 676/2001, C. A. minutes dated 19.01.2004."
"Therefore, the petitioner could not have made an application under Chapter XII"
"section 87(3)."
"Hence  what 
is  said 
in  1st  defendant  respondent’s  written  submissions  at"
"paragraph 21 cannot be accepted."
"“21. It is further submitted that in view of the above submissions, the"
"plaintiff ought to have proceeded with his application to vacate the order"
"of the learned trial judge dated 01.11.2017 under the provisions of Chapter"
"XII of the Civil Procedure Code instead of preferring the instant application"
"to  Your  Lordships  Court  as  there  is  an  alternative  remedy  available  to"
"him”."
"The remedy under section 87(3) was not available. What was available was a final"
"appeal.  The  plaintiff  has  not  appealed.  But  a  revision  is  an  available  remedy."
"According to the caption the plaintiff petitioner moves this Court under revision"
"and restitutio in integrum."
"The 1st defendant respondent further submits,"
"“10. On perusal of the journal entries in the case, it will be observed that"
"on  21.02.2018,  the  plaintiff  had  preferred  an  application  under  the"
"provisions of Chapter XII of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 839"
"seeking 
to  set  aside  and  or 
to  vacate 
the  order  dated  01.11.2017"
"dismissing the case of the plaintiff and fixing the case for ex parte trial on"
"the claim in reconvention of the 1st defendant”."
"The above judgment shows that there cannot be an application under Chapter"
"XII, in respect of default, as there was no default. Although there could be an"
"application under section 839 on inherent powers, it is no bar for an application"
"for revision and restitutio in integrum."
