"“The  concept  of  fair  trial  is  a  fundamental  principle  in  every  judicial"
"system. In another sense, the notion of a fair trial secures justice. A trial"
"in criminal jurisprudence is a judicial examination or determination of"
"the issues at the hand of the Court to arrive at a conclusion whether the"
"accused is guilty of the offence or not."
"The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial"
"is  the  observance  of  the  principle  of  equality  of  arms  between  the"
"defence and the prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed"
"throughout  the  trial,  means  that  both  parties  are  treated  in  a  manner"
"ensuring their procedurally equal position during the course of a trial”."
