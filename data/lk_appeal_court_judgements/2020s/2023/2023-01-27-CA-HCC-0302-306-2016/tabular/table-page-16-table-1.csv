"Although it was not necessary for the determination of the appeal, I would like"
"to  comment  on  the  submission  made  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  in"
"relation  to  the  way  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  defence"
"taken up by the 2nd and the 4th accused."
"It  has  been  determined  that  they  have  taken  up  an  alibi  and  that  they  have"
"failed  to  prove  the  same.  This  Court  has  reiterated  again  and  again  that  an"
"alibi is not a defence in its strict sense but a question of fact. When an accused"
"person takes up an alibi, it is settled law that he has no burden of proof of the"
"alibi taken."
"I am in agreement with the learned President’s Counsel on his submission that"
"the position of the 2nd and the 4th accused appellants was not an alibi and the"
"learned High Court Judge was misdirected when it was determined so."
"The position of the 2nd accused appellant had been that he went on a hire with"
"another  person  to  Wellawatte  and  returned  during  the  time  relevant  to  the"
"incident and he was not involved in the murder. The position of the 4th accused"
"appellant  had  been  that  he  did  not  live  in  the  area  and  was  living  elsewhere"
"when this incident happened and he too was not involved in the crime."
"In order to consider a position taken up by an accused person that he was not"
"involved  in  a  crime  and  he  was  elsewhere  as  taking  up  an  alibi,  the  position"
"taken should be a position that there was no possibility with certainty for him"
"to be present and to commit the crime. The time of the crime also needs to be a"
"time  that  can  be  definitely  fixed.  For  an  example,  if  there  is  evidence  to  show"
"that  the  crime  was  committed  at  a  certain  time,  on  a  certain  day  of  a  certain"
"month  and  a  year  at  a  certain  place,  and  if  the  accused  person  takes  up  the"
"position that he was in a different country at the alleged time and the day, and"
"it was not humanely possible for him to be present at the scene of the crime as"
"alleged, such a stand only can be taken up as an alibi."
