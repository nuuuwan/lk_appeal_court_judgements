"the appellants was not safe in the absence of any independent corroboration of"
"the facts that led to this incident."
"I find that the evidence of PW-06, if called, would have given a clear insight as"
"to  the  events  that  unfolded  on  that  day  and  the  incident  of  stabbing  of  the"
"deceased."
"The  evidence  clearly  suggests  that  all  the  previous  incidents  had  been  in"
"relation to the members of PW-06 Nesmullarâ€™s household. Although the PW-01"
"has claimed that the appellants had a grudge against her husband because he"
"visited  Croos 
in  remand  prison,  who  was  a  murder  suspect,  there 
is  no"
"evidence to suggest that it was the reason for the incidents that took place on"
"the day of the incident."
"According 
to 
the  evidence, 
the  appellants 
focus  had  been 
the  household"
"members  of  PW-06  on  that  day.  When  the  house  of  PW-06  was  attacked,  she"
"had  been  at  home.  She  was  the  next-door  neighbour  of  the  deceased.  In  my"
"view she would have been the best independent witness that should have been"
"called by the prosecution in order to clarify doubts in relation to the evidence of"
"PW-01  and  PW-02  as  alleged  eyewitnesses  to  the  incident  of  stabbing  of  the"
"deceased.  Had  she  given  evidence,  the  fact  that  whether  all  the  five  accused"
"were 
participants 
of 
the 
crime  would 
have 
been 
clearly 
established"
"independently to the evidence of PW-01, and the fact that whether PW-01 and"
"PW-02 went after the assailants as they claimed in Court."
"I am of the view that without sufficient corroboration of the evidence of PW-01"
"and 02, there was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to conclude that"
"the  prosecution  has  proven 
the  charges  against 
the  appellants  beyond"
"reasonable doubt given the considered infirmities in the evidence of the alleged"
"eyewitnesses."
