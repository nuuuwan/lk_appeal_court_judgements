"CA/HCC/44/22"
"In the above cited judgments, the Court has highlighted the importance of"
"proving the production evidence in a drug related trial."
"Although  there  is  a  missing  link  in  the  production  which  was  sent  to  the"
"Government  Analyst  Department,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his"
"judgment had not taken into cognisance of this fact."
"This  missing  link  got  further  aggravated  of  the  issue  of  the  receipt  by  the"
"Government Analyst Department. After receiving the production from PW12"
"the Government Analyst Department had issued the receipt stating that it"
"received two parcels from PW12. The said receipt was marked as P-9 by the"
"prosecution."
"14 days after receiving the production, PW 14, the Government Analyst had"
"issued an amended receipt dated 20.04.2016 stating that the Government"
"Analyst  had  received  only  one  parcel.  Even  though  the  amended  receipt"
"which was marked as P-10 dated 20.04.2016, the same had been received"
"by the Court on 29.06.2016."
"Although the Government Analyst report was dated 27.05.2016, the Court"
"had  received  the  same  on  03.06.2016.  This  is  evident  as  the  Government"
"Analyst had sent the second receipt after the report was prepared and sent"
"to Court which is approximately after one month. This too had escaped the"
"attention of the Learned High Court Judge."
"According to the prosecution, the raid was done without specific information."
"According  to  PW1,  who  knew  the  Appellant  earlier  had  arrested  after  only"
"checking her clenched fist. But she was never subjected to a body check even"
"though a woman police constable (PW8) was included in the raiding team."
"Even the WPC was not utilized to escort the Appellant to jewellery shop when"
"PW1 had weighed the production. Only PW1 and PW2 escorted the Appellant"
"to the jewellery shop."
"Although PW1 admitted that he knew the Appellant earlier, he had not taken"
"any endeavour to check her house."
