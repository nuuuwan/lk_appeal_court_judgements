"According  to  PW1  he  had  handed  over  the  production  PR  152/16  on"
"05.04.2016  to  PW5  PC  17812  Ananda.  On  the  following  day  morning,  the"
"production  was  handed  over  to  PW7  PC  18755  Vishvapala.  PW7  again"
"handed over the production to PW 05. On 06.04.2016 PW5 had handed over"
"the  production  to  PW10  PS  28070  Rohana  who  took  the  same  to  the"
"Maligakanda Magistrate Court and produced it under Case No. B/8862/16."
"The  prosecution  had  neither  called  PW10  Rohana  to  give  evidence  nor  led"
"evidence  through  PW5  to  establish  that  PW5  had  received  the  same  from"
"PW10 Rohana. Hence, there is no evidence to show what was returned by"
"PW10 Rohana was the same item that was produced in the Magistrate Court"
"of Maligakanda under PR No. 152/16."
"This  shows  a  clear  break  in  the  custody  chain  which  need  to  be  proved"
"beyond reasonable doubt in a case of this nature. Without a proper chain of"
"custody,  drugs  do  not  come  in  as  evidence.  The  discrepancies  highlighted"
"above cannot be ignored lightly, as the entire case rests on the cogent and"
"unambiguous evidence pertaining to the chain of production."
