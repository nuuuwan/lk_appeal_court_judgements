"land  and  accordingly 
the  Magistrate’s  Court  made  order  granting"
"possession of the said land to the petitioner’s father”."
"The 1st to 3rd respondents are unaware of the above."
"However, in the proceedings in case No. 62071 dated 03.09.1984 of Magistrate’s"
"Court of Horana, in respect of a land called “Arambewatte” between Ekneligoda"
"Indrasumana  Thero  and  Vidanaralalage  Don  Gamini  Ratnayake 
the  said"
"Indrasumana Thero has admitted that the 2nd respondent is in possession and"
"the  2nd  respondent  has  been  placed 
in  possession.  The  said  Don  Gamini"
"Ratnayake is the father of the petitioner. The Marriage certificate of Don Gamini"
"Ratnayake  and 
the  mother  of 
the  petitioner  Withthamperuma  Arachchige"
"Pushpa Nandani has been attached as “P.14”."
"The  Deed  of  Gift  No.  1545  is  attached  as  “X.1”.  In  that  deed  Don  Gamini"
"Ratnayake

"petitioner as his daughter."
"Hence it is clear that the petitioner has shown sufficient relationship in respect"
"of her standing in this case. It is clear that the petitioner and respondents claim"
"the same land. There is no question or dispute in respect of identification. This"
"is not a case by which petitioner claims title to the land. The question is about"
"standing."
"The petitioner  points out that it is stated in Wada & Forsyth (10th Edition) at"
"page 585,586 that,"
