"A similar view was expressed by His Lordship  Justice T.S. Fernando in In"
"Karunaratne v. The Queen, 69 NLR 10 at page 19,"
"â€œIn respect of the second charge of which the appellant has been convicted, Mr."
"Chitty complains, again not without justification, that it would appear that the trial Judge"
"has once again misapprehended a question of law, this time the nature of the offence"
"charged. The second charge is referred to by the learned Judge as "" a straight-forward"
"charge that the Accused being a public servant did solicit from Piyasena a gratification of"
"Rs. 100"". He goes on to say, "" this solicitation is itself an offence "". If by this he meant that"
"a
l
l
 
that the prosecution had to prove was that the public servant did solicit a gratification,"
"I
 fear that one element of the offence under section 19 (c) has been overlooked."
"""Gratification"" has been the subject of definition in the Act (vide . section 90), but"
"throughout carries with it here a sinister and not an innocent connotation. If the words """
"any gratification which he is not authorised by law or the terms of his employment to"
"receive "" are given the widest possible interpretation of which they are capable, then a"
"public servant who accepts a personal gift from a friend, relative or neighbour, or for that"
"matter a birthday present from his wife, would be guilty of an offence under the Act. It"
"would be absurd to have to reduced oneself to the position that such gifts are within the"
"m
i
schiefs which the Act was designed to punish. Some limitation upon the wide words of"
"the section was obviously intended by the Legislature. However wide the words of a"
"statute may appear to be, they must be given an interpretation that accords with the"
"i
ntention of the Legislature. This rule of interpretation is formulated in Maxwell, ibid, at"
