nowledge.  Whatever,  outside  the  scope  of 
‘exclusive  knowledge’,  as  of  the"
"settled  law  in  Sri  Lanka,  is  up  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt.”"
"It is true that the prosecution bears the burden of proving the case against the"
"accused-appellant  beyond  reasonable  doubt. 
  Specifically, 
the  prosecution"
"must prove that the appellant had the intention to kill the deceased."
"In  situations  where  an  individual  is  alleged  to  have  died  in  police  custody,"
"obtaining independent evidence becomes challenging."
"If  we 
take 
the 
incident  as  described  by 
the  appellant 
in 
isolation, 
their"
"explanation  seems  to  be  sufficient  to  create  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  gun"
"went off by accident."
"The 
intention  of  the  accused  must  be 
inferred  by  considering 
the  entire"
"evidence of this case.  The appellant conceded that the deceased succumbed to"
"a  gunshot  discharged  from  the  rifle  held  by  the  second  accused.  The  first"
"accused  was  right  behind  the  second  accused  as  per  the  evidence  of  the"
"defence."
"The deceased was taken into police custody on the 10th of November 1989.  He"
"was  physically  and  mentally  tortured  and  interrogated  extensively  throughout"
"the  period  until  he  was  handed  over  to  the  first  accused.    The  officers  in  a"
"particular  anti-subversive  unit  were  trained  to 
investigate  and 
interrogate."
"Those 
specially 
trained 
police 
officers  with 
all 
their 
expertise 
in 
the"
"investigation  and 
interrogations  regarding  subversion  or 
terrorism,  having"
"tortured the deceased and investigated nearly for three months, had found no"
"incriminating evidence against the deceased. A question arises as to whether it"
"was  possible  for  this  16-year-old  boy  to  bear  the  torture  for  more  than  two"
"months without disclosing the information about hidden weapons."
