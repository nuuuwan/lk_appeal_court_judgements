"In the case of Gauri Shanker Sharma etc. v. State of U.P. etc., AIR 1990 SC 709,"
"the Supreme Court of India held:"
"""....it is generally difficult in cases of deaths in police custody to secure evidence"
"against  the  policemen  responsible  for  resorting  to  third-degree  methods  since"
"they  are  in  charge  of  police  station  records  which  they  do  not  find  difficult  to"
"manipulate as in this case."
".....The  offence 
is  of  a  serious  nature  aggravated  by 
the 
fact 
that 
it  was"
"committed  by  a  person  who  is  supposed  to  protect  the  citizens  and  not  misuse"
"his uniform and authority to brutally assault them while in his custody. Death in"
"police custody must be seriously viewed for otherwise we will help take a stride"
"in 
the  direction  of  police  raj. 
It  must  be  curbed  with  a  heavy  hand.  The"
"punishment  should  be  such  as  would  deter  others 
from 
indulging

"behaviour. There can be no room for leniency."""

"in paragraph 18 of the judgment as follows:"
"''The  courts  are  also  required  to  have  a  change  in  their  outlook  and  attitude,"
"particularly 
in  cases  involving  custodial  trials  and  they  should  exhibit  more"
"sensitivity and adopt a realistic rather than a narrow technical approach, while"
"dealing with the cases of custodial crimes so that as far as possible, within their"
"powers,  the  guilty  should  not  escape  so  that  the  victim  of  the  crime  has  the"
"satisfaction that ultimately the Majesty of Law has prevailed.''"
"In  Munshi  Singh  Gautam  &  others  V.  State  of  M.P.  [AIR  2005  SC  402],  the"
"Supreme Court held that peculiar  type of cases must be looked  at from  a prism"
