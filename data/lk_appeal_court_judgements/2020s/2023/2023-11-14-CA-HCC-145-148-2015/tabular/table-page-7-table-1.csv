"T
he  special  unit  officers  seem  incompetent  compared  to  the  skill  of  the  first"
"accused, in swiftly extracting information about the hidden  weapons from the"
"suspect  within  a  few  minutes  of  interrogation.    I  do  not  think  any  reasonable"
"man would believe the appellants’ story.  Notably, no ‘B’ report or ‘A’ report was"
"filed in any court in Sri Lanka against the deceased."
"The  first  accused  had  been  instructed  to  bring  the  deceased  to  the  Ingiriya"
"police station. The trained officers in an anti-subversive unit, investigating for"
"about  three  months,  had  not 
found  any  evidence  as  to  weapons  or  any"
"involvement of the deceased in any subversive activities. However, the position"
"of the first accused was that the deceased had disclosed a weapon cache within"
"half an hour after taking into custody of the first accused, implying exceptional"
"investigative  skills  on  the  part  of  the  first  accused.  If  this  is  true,  the  first"
"accused should have been a genius.  Yet, there is no evidence at all to support"
"the  notion 
that 
the 
first  accused  was  an  extraordinary 
investigator.  The"
"narrative  of  the  hidden  weapons,  in  my  view,  is  a  fabricated  story  to  hide  the"
"alleged  cold-blooded  murder  of  the  child.  No  weapons  were 
found  by  the"
"accused or the police even after the death of the deceased.  If the deceased was"
"a  member  of  a  subversive  group,  it  is  improbable  that  the  weapons  would"
"remain in the same location over three months. There was  no urgency for the"
"accused to search for weapons on the same day, in the night.  They could have"
"gone there in the daytime of the following day.  It was not even a place close to"
"the deceased’s house.  The learned High Court Judge has rightly rejected this"
"evidence."
"There was no evidence suggesting that the deceased had received any training"
"to  operate  a 
firearm.  Additionally,  there 
is  no  evidence  to  show  that  the"
"appellant  or  any  police  officer  had  arrested  individuals  suspected  of  engaging"
"in any subversive or criminal activities with the deceased."
"The second accused evaded to answer  on  how the  safety lock in the Gun was"
"released or how exactly the deceased was shot.  The appellant’s position is that"
