"in  such  place  and  subject  to  such  conditions  as  may  be  determined  by  the  Minister"
"and  any  such  order  may  be  extended  from  time  to  time for a  period  not  exceeding"
"three months at a time.”"
"As correctly submitted by the Petitioner our Courts have subjected these sections to intense"
"judicial certainty. In Weerawansa vs. The Attorney General and others(2000) 1 SLR 387 his"
"Lordship Justice Fernando has held, Amarasinghe J. and Dheeraratne J. conquering  that( at"
"page 401);"
"“  an  arrested  person  must  be  produced  before  a  Magistrate,  before  the  period  of"
"seventy-two hours allowed by section 7(1) comes to an end unless a detention order"
"has been made ‘under’ section 9(1), such an order can only be made if ‘the minister"
"has reason to believe or suspect that [such] person is connected with or concerned in"
"any unlawful activity’. Not only must the Minister of Defence, subjectively, have the"
"required  belief  or  suspicion,  but  there  must  also  be,  objectively,  ‘reason’  for  such"
"belief.  While  Article 13(2)  permits  detention  only  upon  a  judicial  order,  section  9(1)"
"allows a Ministerial order. However, being an order, which results in a deprivation of"
"liberty, it must be made with no less care and consideration."
"The  Minister’s  order  does  not  depend  on  the  validity  of  the  preceding  arrest  and"
"detention. Even if such arrest and detention were invalid, nevertheless at the time the"
"detention order was made the Minister did have reason to believe or suspect that the"
"detainee  was  ‘  connected  with  or concerned  in  any  unlawful  activity’  the  detention"
"order and subsequently detention would be lawful.”"
"The question before us is whether any of the offences disclosed/alleged by ‘P1’ reproduced"
"above come within the definition of Section 02 of the PTA which is also reproduced above."
"In my opinion ‘P1’ does not contain any such allegation/offence as the respondents do not"
"contend that the Magistrate of Mount-Lavinia is a specified person or that the Magistrates"
"Court of Mount-Lavinia is a security area, specified by a gazette issued under the provisions"
"of the PTA. In any event such material was not submitted before us."
