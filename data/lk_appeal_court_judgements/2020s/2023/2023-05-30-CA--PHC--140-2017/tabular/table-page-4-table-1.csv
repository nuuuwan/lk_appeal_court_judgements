"Ganemulla   on 24.01.2015 stating that the appellant is using the respondent’s 10 feet"
"road way (which does not belong to the appellant) way to enter the appellant’s land. The"
"inquiry by the Police commenced on 26.01.2015 and 12.02.2015 respectively and in the"
"meantime  the  road  in  question  was  barricaded  by  the  respondent  to  prevent  the"
"appellant from using it.  Thereafter, the appellant made a complaint to the Police Station"
"on 20.03.2015 against such action of the respondent. An inquiry was held in respect of"
"the  said  complaint  made  by  the  appellant.    However,  as  the  appellant  has  claimed"
"prescriptive rights over the disputed road way which was blocked by the respondent, a"
"direction  by senior  police  officer  was made to  settle  the  matter  by  filing  a  Section  66"
"application in the Primary Court."

"respondents,  the  learned  Magistrate  by  the  order  dated  30.07.2015,  held  that  the"
"petitioner does not have a right of way over the disputed road. The learned Magistrate"

"30.07.2015,  the  appellant  filed  a  revision  application  in  the  High  Court  of  Gampaha"
