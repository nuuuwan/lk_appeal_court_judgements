"moved  for  an  acquittal  of  the  appellant  on  the  basis  that  the  prosecution  has"
"failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant."
"Making submissions before this Court on behalf of the respondent, it was the"
"view of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) that in order to prove a charge"
"of cheating, it becomes necessary for the prosecution to prove that the person"
"concerned was deceived fraudulently and dishonestly induced to do or not to do"
"the act mentioned in the charge."
"It was his view that since the appellant has admitted having received the money,"
"his claim that the money was received for a different purpose has no basis. It"
"was his contention that the learned High Court Judge has considered the defence"
"evidence and the defence put forward by the appellant in order to find whether"
"it has created a reasonable doubt or has provided an explanation in relation to"
"the allegation against the appellant, in view of the admissions. It was his position"
"that the learned High Court Judge has not predetermined the matter, but has"
"only considered the evidence in the manner required in a criminal case."
