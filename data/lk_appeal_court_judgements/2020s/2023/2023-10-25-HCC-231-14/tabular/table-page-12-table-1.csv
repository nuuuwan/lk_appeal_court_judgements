"The King v Andree [1941], 42 NLR, 495, on page 500, His Lordship Soertsz J, held that:"
"“In regard to this contention, under our law the position appears to be, as I have"
"pointed out, that it is not necessary to prove agreement, either directly or inferentially. It"
"is  sufficient  to  prove  that  the  accused  acted  together with a common purpose for  or  in"
"committing an offence.”"
"(Emphasis added)"
"The above-said judgements were referred by Justice Dep, P.C, J (as he was then), in"
"the case of Mazur Ivegen and another v A.G, S.C App TAB/1/2015, decided on 08.12.2016."
"In  Tillakaratne  and  others  v  A.G  [1989],  2  S.L.R,  54  on  page  61,  His  Lordship"
"Wijeratne J held that;"
"“Conspiracy can ordinarily be proved only by a mere inference from the subsequent"
"conduct of the parties in committing some overt acts which tend so obviously towards the"
"alleged unlawful acts as to suggest that they must have arisen from an agreement to bring"
"it about."
"In Ratanlal and Dhirajlal proposed the following thesis in The Indian Penal Code"
"30th Edition re-print 2009 on page 193;"
"“It  should,  however,  be  remembered  that  where  there  is  no  direct  evidence,  for"
"example  through  the  evidence  of  an  approver,  and  the  case  for  the  prosecution  is"
"dependent on circumstantial evidence alone, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove"
"and establish such circumstances as would lead to the only conclusion of existence of a"
"criminal conspiracy and rule out the theory of innocence.”"
"Ratanlal and Dhirajlal(supra) followed the case of Dadasaheb Bapusaheb Naik and"
"Etc. vs State of Maharashtra [1981], 1982 Cr LJ 856, it was held;"
"“Admittedly, this is a case wherein the prosecution rests entirely on circumstantial"
"evidence for proving the alleged criminal conspiracy between accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 to"
"cheat the Zilla Parishad and/or the panchayat Samiti. Parner by preparing false accounts."
"It appears that the investigating agency thought that the circumstances referred to above"
"were  sufficient  enough  to  establish  a  clinching  case  of  conspiracy  without  any  direct"
"evidence.  In  cases  of  conspiracy,  though  it  is  true  that  direct  evidence  other  than  that"
