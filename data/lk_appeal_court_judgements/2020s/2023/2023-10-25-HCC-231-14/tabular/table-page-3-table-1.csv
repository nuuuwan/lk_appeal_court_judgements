"a  result  of  this  collusive  scheme,  three  counterfeit  deeds  were  prepared  through  the"
"agency of these impersonators."
"The prosecution presented its case through the evidence of nineteen witnesses and"
"submitted  documentary  evidence,  designated  as  Exhibits  A1  to  A46,  before  resting  its"
"case.  Conversely,  the  second  defendant  took  the  stand  and  offered  evidence  from  the"
"witness  box,  led  the  evidence  of  six  additional  witnesses,  and  marked  documents  as"
"Exhibits V1 to V22 before closing the defense's case."
