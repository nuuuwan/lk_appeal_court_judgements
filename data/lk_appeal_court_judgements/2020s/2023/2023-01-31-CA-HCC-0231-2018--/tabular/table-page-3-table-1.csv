"According  to  his  evidence,  he  has  been  released  from  remand  custody  a  day"
"before this incident took place. He was in remand custody as a suspect in a case"
"of murder."
"On  the  day  of  the  incident,  while  being  in  the  company  of the  three  deceased"
"persons, several persons have come and fired at them using a firearm he referred"
"to as a machine gun. He says that after firing at two of the deceased persons,"
"the appellant fired at the person called Berty who was in front of him and the"
"mentioned Berty fell on him. As a result, both of them fell onto the ground. As"
"there  was  blood  all  over  him,  he  has  pretended  as  if  he  too  got  shot,  which"
"resulted in the assailants running away from the scene of crime believing that"
"their target was achieved. He has given evidence saying that when he looked at"
"the persons who were fleeing, he saw the appellant, the 2nd accused indicted and"
"several others, getting into a three-wheeler and fleeing from the scene."
"He has stated that after the incident, he went into hiding fearing for his life and"
"made a statement to the police three months after the incident. He has explained"
"further  that  while  in  hiding,  he  informed  about  the  incident  to  the  Officer-in-"
"charge of the police station over the phone, informing that he will come and make"
"a statement later due to his fear of being attacked. However, the mentioned OIC"
"who has given evidence as PW-09 has denied that PW-01 gave him a call and"
"informed of his difficulty to come to the police station. He has specifically stated"
"that if such an information was provided, he would have definitely made notes"
"of it and proceed with his investigations."
"The position taken up by the appellant as well as the 2nd accused indicted had"
"been that they were never involved in this crime. They have claimed that they"
"were never arrested nor any statement was recorded from them, and they came"
"to  know  that  they  are  being  charged  for  the  crime,  only  after  they  received"
"summons from the High Court, requiring them to appear before the Court. They"
"have denied any involvement in this crime."
