"At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated"
"one  ground  of  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"convicted  the  appellant  without  considering  the  reasonable  doubts  that  have"
"been created as to the involvement of the appellant to the crime."
"In her submissions, she relied mainly on the belatedness of the statement made"
"by  the  only  alleged eyewitness  to  the  incident  contending  that  relying  only  on"
"such a witness is highly unsafe, given the facts and the circumstances that led"
"to the charges being laid against the appellant and the other person indicted."
"The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) having considered the facts"
"and the relevant circumstances, brought to the notice of the Court that, in fact,"
"the  appellant  and  the  other  person  indicted  had  never  been  arrested  and"
"statements recorded by the police. Having considered the procedure followed by"
"the police to investigate the matter and conduct the non-summary proceedings"
"on the basis that the appellant and the other person cannot be apprehended, it"
"was his view that he is in no position to agree with the way the investigations"
"that had been conducted in this matter."
"Under the circumstances, he agreed that the appellant has not been afforded a"
"fair trial in accordance with the due process of the law and therefore, relying on"
"a witness who has made a belated statement was not safe to conclude that the"
"charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant."
"As pointed out by the learned Counsel for the appellant as well as the learned"
"SDSG,  this  is  a  matter  where  the  conviction  has  been  solely  based  on  the"
"evidence of PW-01, who was the only witness who speaks about the involvement"
"of  the  appellant  and  the  other  person  to  the  crime.  Therefore,  it  becomes"
"necessary for this Court to consider whether the evidence of PW-01 was reliable"
"and  trustworthy  to  rely  on  his  evidence  alone  for  a  conviction.  In  view  of  the"
"appellantâ€™s contention that he was unaware that he was an accused or even a"
"suspect in this matter, and he came to the High Court only upon summons is"
"concerned, it is also necessary to find out the reasons for such a situation."
