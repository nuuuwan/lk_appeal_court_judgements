"Court has predicated his claim on the same underlying factual transaction and has requested"
"nearly identical reliefs. However, it needs to pay special attention to the relief sought by the"
"Petitioner in the instant Application to get the order of the USAB marked 'Z' quashed."
"As such, I must examine the factual foundation for the relief sought in the proceedings before"
"the USAB. The Petitioner submitted the Application to the USAB under Section 16 of the"
"Universities Act No.16 of 1978 and the Petitioner has reproduced the contents of paragraph"
"31 of the FR Application (marked 'X') in the Application to the USAB as well. Thus, it appears"
"that the said Application to USAB also has been made in respect of the issues and causes of"
"action  similar  to  the  proceedings  in  the  FR  Application  and  the  writ  Application.  Despite"
"such findings, it is important to note that the USAB by its' decision delivered on 13.10.2020"
"('Z') has dismissed the Application of the Petitioner on the basis that the USAB in terms of"
"Section 86 of the Universities Act was not competent to quash an appointment already made"
"and also to make an order that another candidate be appointed. I am mindful of the fact that"
"no estoppel/res judicata would legitimize an action which is ultra vires. In such context, I am"
"convinced that the USAB has not pronounced an illegal or unreasonable order which needs"
"evaluation at a merit stage of the instant Application."
"In the circumstances, it is apparent that the factual foundation for the reliefs sought in each"
"of the above proceedings are similar and I am satisfied that all three of the above proceedings"
"have been initiated based on the same course of dealings between the same parties. In other"
"words, the Petitioner has sought reliefs from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and the"
"USAB on the same cause of action upon which the principles of res judicata elaborated above"
"can  be  employed  easily.  Although  the  conclusion  of  the  proceedings  before  USAB  is  not"
"material to my findings on res judicata, it is paramount to note that the proceedings before"
"the Supreme Court in the said FR Application have been concluded. This Court may not be"
"able  to  adopt  the  principles  of  res  judicata  in  a  writ  application,  in  an  event  where  the"
"proceedings before the Supreme Court were not concluded."
"It needs to be stressed that the Petitioner has failed to give adequate and appropriate reasons"
"for  maintaining  the  FR  Application  and  the  writ  Application  parallelly.  With  the  modern"
"trends  and  the  complexity  of  issues  in  present day  society while  recognizing  the  right  of  a"
"litigant to procure similar reliefs through multiple adjudications, I must emphasize that it is a"
