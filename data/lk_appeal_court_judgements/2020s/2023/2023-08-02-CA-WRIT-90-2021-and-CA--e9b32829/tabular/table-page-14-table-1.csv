"Supreme Court in the said FR Application takes a decision unfavourable to the Petitioner."
"The  Petitioner  has  waited  almost  2  years  until  some  favourable  consequential  or  ancillary"
"decision  was  taken  and  therefore,  the  delayed  Application  for  judicial  review  cannot  be"
"assumed to be reasonable."
"The special circumstances of this case imply that the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the initial"
"threshold requirement in order to warrant this Court to issue formal notice of this Application"
"to the Respondents. Therefore, upholding the preliminary objections dealt with in this order,"
"I proceed to refuse this Application."
