"Construction Ltd. v. Om Prakash & Ors decided on 20.04.1998 the Supreme Court of India has"
"held; ""We certainly, cannot approve of any attempt on the part of any litigant to go ""forum shopping""."
"A litigant cannot be permitted `choice' of the `forum' and every attempt at ""forum shopping"" must be"
"crushed with a heavy hand""."
"I shall now try to deviate to a certain extent from the traditional definition given to abuse of"
"process through forum shopping. It would be convenient for me to describe this by referring"
"to the law in respect of transferring of cases on various lawful grounds. Superior Courts have"
"considered  the  aspect  of  a  judge  being  biased,  among  other  reasons,  in  order  to  make  a"
"determination  regarding  the  transfer  of  cases.  The  eloquent  words  of  Wanasundera,  J.  in"
"Hewamanne v De Silva [1983] 1 Sri L.R. 1 at 24 are apt here."
