"It is clear from the above reasoning that because of the other weapons allegedly"
"carried by the appellants, and based on the personal knowledge of the learned"
"High  Court  Judge,  they  have  been  found  guilty  rather  than  after  a  proper"
"analysis of the evidence against them with regard to the charge preferred."
"I am of the view that although there is merit in several other grounds of appeal"
"urged as well, considering them separately would not be necessary as the appeal"
"should succeed on the above considered matters alone."
"Therefore,  this  Court  has  no  option,  but  to  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the"
"sentence imposed against the appellants."
"The next matter that needs the consideration of the Court is whether this is a fit"
"and proper case to send for a re-trial as urged by the learned SDSG."
"This  is  an  offence  that  has  been  allegedly  committed  some  10  years  ago,  the"
"indictment of this matter has been filed  in 2016 and the judgement has been"
"delivered  in  the  year  2017.  Considering  the  passage  of  time  and  the  other"
"relevant facts and the circumstances into account, this Court is of the view that"
"this is not a case fit to order for a re-trial."
"Accordingly, the appellants are acquitted of the charge preferred against them."
"The appeal allowed."
