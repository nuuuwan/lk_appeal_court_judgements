"De Sampayo, J. quoted from page 1892 of the 2nd Volume of Gour on Penal"
"Law where it has been stated that,"
"“Possession to be criminal must be actual or exclusive for criminal liability"
"does not attach to constructive possession…from this it follows that where"
"property is found in a house in the possession of it for the purpose of this"
"offence unless there is evidence of exclusive conscious control against them."
"This  passage  is  a  comment  on  the  provision  of  the  Penal  Code  as  to  the"
"receipt  or  retention  of  stolen  property,  but  the  principle  appears  to  be"
"applicable generally.”"
