"In the case of Caderamanpulle and others Vs. Caderamanpulle and others 2005"
"(1) SLR 397 a preliminary objection was taken to the effect that the failure of the"
"Petitioner  to 
file  certified  copies  of  the  documents  which  amounts  to  a"
"noncompliance of Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules"
"of  1990 
is  fatal 
in  a  Leave  to  appeal  application  and  the  Leave  to  appeal"
"application should be rejected on that ground. This court held that the Rule 3 of"
"the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990. The court held that the"
"court  has  no  power  to  dismiss  a Leave  to  appeal  application in  limine  on  the"
"Petitioner’s failure to produce certified copies of documents."
"Amaratunga J. held as follows;"
