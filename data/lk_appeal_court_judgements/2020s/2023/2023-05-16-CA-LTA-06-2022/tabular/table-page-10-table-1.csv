"The learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Respondents has drawn our attention to"
"the  averments  contained  in  paragraph  5  of  the  petition  and  states  that  the"
"registration  with  the  Register  General  and  payment  of 
income  tax  has  no"
"relevance whatsoever. Averments in paragraph 5 states that the trust which is"
"the subject matter of this case is registered in the Register General’s department"
"as a private express trust and it is subject to income tax. That is a relevant fact"
"to  show  that 
it 
is  an  express  trust.  The 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiffs-"
"Respondents  has  stated  that  the  Respondents  have  no  opportunity  to  file"
"objections to say their side of the story. Although there is no requirement to file"
"a statement of objections in a leave to appeal application the Respondents can"
"do  so  with  permission of  court  if they  desire  to  do  so.  Therefore,  there  is  no"
"merit in the 3rd preliminary objection."
"The Plaintiffs-Respondents have taken up the position that the Petitioners have"
"failed to comply with Rule 3(1)(a) read with Rule 3(15) of the Court of Appeal"
"(Appellate  Procedure)  Rules  of  1990  because  of 
their 
failure 
to  annex"
"documentary proof of the appointments of the 8th to 12th Petitioners as trustees"
"of the trust which is the subject matter in this case."
"Rule 3(1)(a) reads as follows,"
"“Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powers"
"vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 and 141 of the Constitution shall be"
"by  way  of  Petition,  together  with  and  affidavit  in  support  of  the  averments"
"therein,  and  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  originals  of  documents  material  to"
"such application (or duly certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where"
"a petitioner is unable to tender any such document, he shall state the reason for"
"such inability and seek the leave of the Court to furnish such document later."
"Where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this rule, the Court may"
"ex mero motu or at the instance of any party dismiss such application.”"
"Rule 3(15) reads as follows,"
"“These rules shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to applications made to the Court of"
"Appeal under any provision of Law other that Article 138, 140 and 141 of the"
"Constitution,  subject  to  any  direction  as  may  be  given  by  the  Court  in  any"
"particular case.”"
