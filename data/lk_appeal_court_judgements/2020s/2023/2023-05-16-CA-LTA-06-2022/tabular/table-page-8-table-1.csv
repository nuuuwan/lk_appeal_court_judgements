"“Without prejudice to the above preliminary objections and the contention of"
"bias, the parties framed admissions and issues on 19.03.2022 and issues No. 26"
"and 27 were raised by the Petitioners as preliminary issues of law…….”"
"The Learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Respondents submitted that the assertion"
"that the Petitioners raised issues and recorded admissions without prejudice to"
"their objection on bias is futile. The Wakfs Tribunal had rejected the allegation"
"of bias and that order was not canvased before this court. The Petitioners cannot"
"raise that objection again. The Learned Counsel submitted that nowhere in the"
"proceedings before the Wakfs Tribunal was it recorded that the Petitioners had"
"proceeded  to record  that  the  admissions and  issues  without  prejudice  to the"
"above preliminary objections and contention of bias. That is not a suppression"
"of a material fact or a misrepresentation but a legal position taken up by the"
"Petitioners  in  their  petition.  The  allege  misrepresentation  or  the  suppression"
"should relate to a material fact. A mere misrepresentation or a suppression is"
"not sufficient. A material fact is something which is material for the Judge to"
"decide a case. Here, there is no such material fact and that objection must fail."
"I will  proceed to consider the 3rd objection next. It  was the submission of the"
"Learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Respondents that a party is required to set out"
"a  plain  and  concise  statement  of  the  grounds  of  objections  under  section"
"758(1)(d) of the Civil Procedure Code and therefore, there is no necessity for"
"background information. Therefore, containing matters that are not relevant to"
"the order and which are factual and evidential are violative of section 758(1)(d)"
"of the Civil Procedure Code."
"Section 758(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows;"
"758(1) The Petition of appeal shall be distinctly written upon good and suitable"
"paper, and shall contain the following particulars:-"
"(a) the name of the court in which the case is pending;"
"(b) the names of the parties to the action;"
"(c ) the names of the appellant and of the respondent;"
"(d) the address to the Court of Appeal;"
