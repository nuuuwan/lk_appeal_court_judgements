"prejudicially  affected  by  the result  of the  appeal  should  be  made  parties and"
"unless they are the petition of appeal should be rejected. That was case of non-"
"joinder  of  necessary  parties  in  an  appeal.  In  that  case  the  caption  became"
"defective due to the non-joinder. In this case the caption has become defective"
"due to the misjoinder of 8th to 12th Petitioners who are not parties in the court"
"below. Therefore, the rationale in Ibrahim Vs Beebee will apply to this case as"
"well. This judgment was followed in Suwarishamy Vs Thelenis 54 NLR 282 where"
"it  was  held  that  where  in  an  appeal,  a  necessary  party  has  not  been  made  a"
"Respondent,  the  appeal  will  be  dismissed  unless  the  defect  is  not  one  of  an"
"obvious character which could not reasonably have been foreseen and avoided."
"These two cases were decided under the Old Civil Procedure Code where the"
"section 759(2) of the present Civil Procedure Code was not there. Section 759(2)"
"of the present Code reads as follows;"
"“In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any appellant in"
"complying  with  the  provisions  of  the  foregoing  sections,  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"may,  if  it  should  be  of  opinion  that  the  respondent  has  not  been  materially"
"prejudiced, grant relief on such terms as it may deem just.”"
"In the case of Nanayakkara Vs Warnakulasuriya 1993 (2) SLR 289 Kulatunga J."
"(with G.P.S. De Silva CJ. and Wijetunga J. agreeing) held that the power of the"
"court to grant relief under section 759(2) of the Code is wide and discretionary"
"and is subject to such terms as the court may deem just. Relief may be granted"
"even if no excuse for non-compliance is forthcoming. However, relief cannot be"
"granted  if  the  Court  is  of  opinion  that  the  respondent  has  been  materially"
"prejudiced in which event the appeal has to be dismissed."
"The  principles  applicable  to  the  exercise  of  this  power  have  been  clearly  laid"
"down  by  Bandaranayake  J.  Fernando  J.  and  Kulathunge  J.  in  three  separate"
"judgements in the case of Martin Vs Suduhamy 1991 (2) SLR 279."
"When  one  compares  the  Old  Civil  Procedure  Code  with  the  present  Code  on"
"grounds  of  rejection  of  the  petition  of  appeal  a  more  liberal  view  has  been"
"incorporated by section 759(2) of the present Civil Procedure Code. The law as"
"it  stood  earlier  was  very  strict  in  its  application  and  had  made  mandatory"
"provisions with regard to provisions relating to a notice of appeal, petition of"
