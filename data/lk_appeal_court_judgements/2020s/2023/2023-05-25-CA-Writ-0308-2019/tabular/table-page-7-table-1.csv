"Accordingly,  based  on  the  above  policy  of  the  government,  the  Petitioners"
"have  entered  into  various  agreements  with  third  parties  to  distribute  and"
"exhibit films. Further, it is submitted that the Petitioners have heavily invested"
"their  funds  in  the  industry.  According  to  the  Petitioner,  when  the  matter"
"remains  as  such  unexpectedly  the  1st  Respondent,  by  letter  dated  19th  June"
"2018 (‘P 14’) informed the 4th Petitioner to immediately stop its operation of"
"distribution of films3."
"Thereafter,  the  4th  Petitioner  together  with  three  other  distributing  circuits,"
"filed the District Court action bearing No. DSP 99/2018 (‘P 16’) against the"
"1st Respondent, in the District Court of Colombo on the 26th June 2018, on the"
"basis of violation of the contract with the 1st Respondent, seeking inter-alia"
"enforcement of the said agreement. The learned District Judge had refused to"
"issue an interim injunction restraining the 1st Respondent, NFC, from giving"
"effect to the letter dated 19th June 2018 (‘P 14’). According to the Petitioner,"
"the order of the District Judge is appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court"
"and  the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  has  already  granted  an  interim  order"
"restraining the operation of 1st Respondent’s letter ‘P 14’. Hence, it is clear"
"that the same matter pertaining to ‘P 14’, the authority of the NFC to distribute"
"and supply films in Sri Lanka under the NFC Act is being agitated before the"
"District  Court  as  well.  Later  on,  the  Petitioner  has  come  to  know  that  the"
"impugned decision of the 1st Respondent marked ‘P 14’ was communicated to"
"the NFC pursuant to a direction given by the Minister of Cultural Affairs4."
"This is an admitted fact by the Respondent5."
"As I have already stated above, the Petitioner’s contention is that the decision"
"to revoke the importation, sale, distribution, and supply of film by the circuits"
"is illegal and bad in law."
"The Respondent’s contention is that the relief sought by the Petitioner in this"
"application has been rendered futile by the Cabinet decision marked ‘1 R 1’"
