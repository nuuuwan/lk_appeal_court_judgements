"Yeo in their book titled “Criminal Law in Sri Lanka” at page 255 state that:"
"“Some public servants such as the police and military personnel have an"
"important role to play in maintaining law and order or pursuing justice"
"in a civil society. The law imposes certain duties on these public servants"
"which,  along  with  the  powers  which  go  with  them,  are  not  normally"
"accorded to ordinary civilians. There will invariably be occasions when,"
"in the discharge of these duties, the public servant causes harm which"
"constitute  an  offence.  There  will  also  be  circumstances  when  public"
"servants meet physical resistance when performing their duties, and the"
"Penal Code gives them a number of protections. Generally speaking, the"
"special protections afforded to public servants are the result of the ‘Law"
"and  Order’  objectives  of  19th  century  British  interests  in  India  and"
"outlying colonies”."
