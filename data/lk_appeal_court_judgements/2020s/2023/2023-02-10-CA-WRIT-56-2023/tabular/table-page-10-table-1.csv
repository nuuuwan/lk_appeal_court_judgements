"the said learned Counsel  submitted that the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka  also has no"
"capacity to release extra water in order to facilitate such process."
"I need to examine at this stage whether the above-mentioned incapacity of the CEB would"
"pave the way to relinquish the CEB from the liability of not complying with the directions"
"issued  by  the PUCSL  in  ‘P22’.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  United"
"Nations Disaster Risk Reduction Offices define ‘institutional capacity’ as the capability of an"
"institution to set and achieve social and economic goals, through knowledge, skills, systems,"
"and institutions. While institutional capacity is often mentioned in development contexts and"
"is  well  understood  in  general  terms,  it  can  be  difficult  to  define  in  specific  terms  and  in"
"measurable ways.1 Various scholars have given several definitions for institutional capacity"
"and accordingly, it has been identified even as the ability and competence of an institution to"
"carry out mandated operations and produce outcomes by deploying the necessary resources"
"within an appropriate structural context2."
"The PUCSL being the regulatory body is ought to take a practical approach when assaying"
"the institutional limitations or capacity of the Licensee before making strict directions. There"
"may be numerous occasions where the regulatory body should not take decisions on its own"
"without consulting specialists with related expertise. I am convinced that the scheme of the"
"PUCSL Act is to strike a proper balance among the respective public institutions by way of a"
"coordinated effort for the benefit of the consumers. The Preamble of the said Act declares that"
"it’s an Act for the establishment of the PUCSL to regulate certain utilities industries pursuant"
"to  a  coherent  national  policy.  If  the  PUCSL  issues  a  direction  without  assaying  the  said"
"institutional  capacity  of  the  Licensee  and  also against  the  coherent  national  policy,  then  a"
"reasonable  doubt  arises  whether  such  direction  is  practical  and  also  sometimes  whether"
"lawful."
"Although,  this  Court  is  bound  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  in  terms  of  Article  140  of  the"
"Constitution, I trust that this Court is competent to take notice of the severe economic crisis"
"prevailed in the Country very recently and the immense suffering underwent by the people."
