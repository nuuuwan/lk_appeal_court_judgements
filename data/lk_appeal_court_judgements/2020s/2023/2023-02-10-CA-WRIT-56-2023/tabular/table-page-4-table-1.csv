"regard is reproduced in the said letter."
"“The  Board  also  directed  the  General  Manager  to  seek  permission  from  the  PUCSL  for  the"
"“scheduled power interruptions” explaining clearly the difficulties faced in obtaining fuel from"

"to continue with planned power interruptions until further notice.”"
"The primary relief sought by the PUCSL is for a writ of Certiorari quashing the said decision"
"of the CEB reflected in ‘P23’. A writ of Mandamus is also sought to direct the 1st to 4th and"
"the  6th  Respondents  to  comply  with  the  agreement  and  undertaking  made  at  the  Human"

"Now, I need to examine the reasons given by CEB for not complying with the said direction"
"‘P22’ of the PUCSL. The background to the reasons given in the aforesaid letter ‘P23’ can be"
