"This Court is not competent to assess and pronounce whether the effects of the said economic"
"crisis  has  ceased  or  diminished  by  now.  Following  the  judicial  precedent  laid  down  by"
"Superior  Courts,  the  Court  of  Appeal  exercises  an  unfettered  discretion  in  judicial  review"
"subject to the said Article of the Constitution. Therefore, I take the view that this is a fit and"
"proper  case  to  adopt  the  notion  of  institutional  capacity  when  reviewing  the  impugned"
"decision  of  the  CEB.  The  cornerstone  of  this  notion  should  be  that  an  adequate  and  a"
"reasonable  explanation  based  on 
the 
institution’s 
incapacity,  particularly  on 
the  non-"
"availability  of  resources  and  expertise,  should  be  taken  into  consideration  by  a  regulatory"
"body  before  making  any  adverse  order  against  a  Licensee  upon  a  non-compliance  of  a"
"direction issued by such regulatory body. This notion should be adopted only in rare occasions"
"like in this case and no public institution should take refuge under this defence after misusing"
"public power by mismanagement or maladministration."
"Moreover, the circumstances of this case lead this Court as well to delegate a considerable"
"portion  of  its  decision  making  power  upon  the  availability  of  resources  of  the  respective"
"institution/  electricity 
industry 
to  another  organ  of 
the  Government  which  has 
the"
"specialization  and  the  expertise.  The  PUCSL  not  challenging  the  institutional  incapacity"
"reflected in the letters of the CEB at an appropriate forum facilitated me to boldly embrace"
"the notion of institutional incapacity in the instant Application."
"Hence, I take the view that no interim order as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition could"
"be issued. The principles of balance of convenience can be clearly employed in making this"
"decision as the issuance of an interim order would cause irreparable damages to the CEB and"
"eventually,  majority  of  the  public 
including  the  students  who  are  sitting 
for  the  A/L"
"Examination will have to be in dark for several months in the near future. This Court is unable"
"to allow such damage to be caused by clinging on to narrow interpretations of law relating to"
"judicial review."
"Having  considered  the  issuance  of  interim  relief,  it  is  important  to  ascertain  whether  this"
"Petition can be further maintained. As mentioned earlier, the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  Petitioner  in  no  uncertain  terms  admitted  that  this  Application  would  be  rendered"
"nugatory  if  no  interim  relief  is  issued.  Thus,  once  the  interim  order  is  rejected,  I  need  to"
