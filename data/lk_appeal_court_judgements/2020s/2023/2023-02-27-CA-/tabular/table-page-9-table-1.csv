"for the Petitioners submitted that the 5th Respondent's Leningrad Diploma could not be regarded"
"as being a degree in Engineering, or its equivalent, as it was a qualification in Geology, and not"
"in Engineering as understood in Sri Lanka. The Respondents produced details of the subjects"
"offered for that Diploma, and Counsel submitted that these could not be considered equivalent"
"to those prescribed for a local degree in Engineering. It is not for us to determine, on the"
"merits,  whether  the  Diploma  conferred  by  the  Leningrad  Institute  of  Mining  was  the"

"during her Bachelor of Business Administration degree programme  (as per P29) and"
"she has a Diploma in Microsoft Office conducted by the ITS Computer Centre in Jaffna"
