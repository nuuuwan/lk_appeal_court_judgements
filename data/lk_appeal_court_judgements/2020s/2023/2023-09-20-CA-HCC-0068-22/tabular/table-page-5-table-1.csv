"by the learned High Court Judge in his judgement, there is a difference in the"
"time of arrest between the evidence of PW-01 and PW-03. The learned High Court"
"Judge has also observed the discrepancy in the evidence as to the place of sealing"
"of the production mentioned by the two witnesses and also of the fact whether"
"the house belonging to the appellant was searched or not at the time of the raid."
"It  needs  to  be  noted  that  the  stand  taken  by  the  appellant  when  PW-03  was"
"cross-examined  had  been  very  much  different  to  the  stand  she  took  up  when"
"PW-01 was cross-examined in that regard."
"It had been suggested to her that the productions were recovered from a table"
"inside of the house, which the witness has denied. It has also been suggested to"
"her that at the time of the arrest, the appellant was not seated in front of her"
"house,  but  was  washing  her  pots  and  pans  in  the  house.  It  had  also  been"
"suggested  that  the  parcel  taken  from  the  table  was  handed  over  to  her  by  a"
"person called Ichchi, which was also denied by the witness."
"According to PW-03â€™s evidence and that of PW-01, it has been revealed that a"
"sum  of  Rs.  12500/=  of  various  denominations  had  been  recovered  from  the"
"possession of the appellant in the second parcel found by PW-03 in the right-"
"hand side pocket of the dress worn by the appellant, and the said money has"
"been  duly  entered  in  the  productions  register  of  the  Grandpass  police  and"
"handed over to the Court."
"As  I  have  considered  before,  there  had  been  no  material  discrepancy  in  the"
"evidence  of  PW-01  and  PW-03  as  to  the  raid  conducted  by  them  and  the"
"procedures followed in that regard."
"The prosecution has called the relevant witnesses to prove the chain of custody"
"of the productions and at the trial, the parties have recorded several admissions"
"in  terms  of  section  420  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act.  The  following"
"admissions had been recorded."
