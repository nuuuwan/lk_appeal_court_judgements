"Gunawardena. It may well be she is known as Priyangani to her peers which may"
"be the reason why PW-01 referred to her by that name. It is abundantly clear"
"from her evidence that she had been a part of the raiding party and her evidence"
"had been cogent and credible."
"It is well settled law that if a party wishes to challenge the evidence of a witness"
"and put forward another proposition, the relevant witness has to be confronted"
"with that position. In the matter under consideration, the appellant  has never"
"suggested that it was not the PW-03 who searched her and assisted the raid in"
"arresting her on the date of her arrest. Therefore, I find no merit in the considered"
"ground of appeal."
"Ground of Appeal 02:-"
"Although it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the"
"prosecution has failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt against the"
"appellant, I have no basis to agree with the said contention. It is trite law that a"
"trial Court has to consider the evidence in its totality be it by the prosecution or"
"by the defence and come to a finding whether the prosecution has proved its case"
"beyond reasonable doubt."
