"In the case of Siddeek Vs Jacolyn Seneviratne16 Soza J. observed that, “The Court will"
"have regard to the special circumstances of the case before it before issuing a writ of"
"certiorari.  The  writ  of  certiorari  clearly  will  not  issue  where  the  end  result  will  be"
"futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.”"
"In Ratnasiri and others Vs Ellawala and others17 what was sought to be quashed was"
"the  decision  said  to  have  been  made  by  the Transfer  Board,  to  whom  the  power  of"
"transfer has been delegated by the Public Service Commission. However, the Public"
"Service Commission had approved and adopted the decision of the Transfer Board and"
"no relief has been sought against that decision. Justice Saleem Marsoof, P.C., P/CA (as"
"he then was) held that it would be futile to grant the reliefs prayed for since it would"
"still leave intact the decision of the Transfer Board."
"Considering all the above-stated facts and circumstances, I hold that there are no merits"
"in this Writ Application to grant the reliefs sought by the Petitioner Company and that"
"should be dismissed. Accordingly, I dismiss the Application. The Petitioner Company"
"will pay Rs. 100 000/- to the IRD as costs of this Application."
"Application dismissed with costs."
