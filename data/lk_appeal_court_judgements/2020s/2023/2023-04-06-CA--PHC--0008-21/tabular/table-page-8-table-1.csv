"It  is  also  very  much  evident  that  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Ampara  was  also"
"knowledgeable of the distinction and the cases decided by the Court of Appeal in"
"that  regard,  when  he  decided  to  release  the  vehicle  used  in  transporting  the"
"illegally cut soil while ordering the show cause relating to the loader used in the"
"offence of digging earth soil as to why it should not be confiscated."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge in his well-considered judgement has"
"considered all the angles of the arguments presented on behalf of the appellant"
"in coming to his finding that he has no basis to interfere with the order of the"
"learned Magistrate."
"Although  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  that  a  loader  is  a"
"vehicle and a vehicle cannot be confiscated under the terms of the Act, as I have"
"stated before, it is a matter that has to be considered subjective to the facts and"
"the circumstances of each case."
"The learned Counsel for the appellant stated at the very outset of the appeal that"
"he is not contesting the facts of the matter. It is clear from the charge against"
"the 1st accused in the Magistrate Court of Ampara, that he had been charged for"
"digging soil using the mentioned loader for which he has pleaded guilty. Although"
"a loader is a vehicle that needs registration in terms of the provisions of the Motor"
"Traffic Act, it becomes necessary to consider the literal meaning of a loader in"
"order to determine whether it falls under the strict interpretation of a vehicle or"
"though it may have registered as a vehicle under the Motor Traffic Act, it can fall"
"under a different definition."
"The meaning attributed to the word loader in the Oxford dictionary is that “a"
"machine or a person that loads something.”"
"The  meaning  given  in  the  Cambridge  dictionary  is  that  “a  machine  used  for"
"putting  heavy  goods  onto  a  vehicle  so  they  can  be  transported,  or  the"
"vehicle used to transport them.”"
