"on 19-02-2016, given the facts and the circumstances relevant to the appeals"
"considered by their lordships."
"In  both  the  above-mentioned  instances,  the  vehicles  that  had  been  used  for"
"transportation of mines and minerals had been confiscated, whereas the facts"
"and the circumstances in the matter under appeal is very much different."
"As  determined  by  Salam,  J.  in  Nishantha  and  Three  Others  Vs.  The  State"
"(supra), there is no provision that has specifically mentioned that a vehicle used"
"in the commission of an offence in terms of the Mines and Mineral Act can be"
"confiscated. His Lordship has made this determination after well considering the"
"provisions of similar Acts where the vehicle confiscation has been permitted."
"However, it is my considered view that there should be a distinction between an"
"Act which specifically mentions that a vehicle used in commission of a crime is"
"subjected  to  confiscation  and  an  Act  which  has  omitted  the  term  ‘vehicle’  but"
"has specifically mentioned that any mineral, machinery, equipment or material"
"used in or in connection with the commission of that offence would be subjected"
"to be forfeited to the State."
"It is my view that even a vehicle registered in terms of the provisions of the Motor"
"Traffic Act that has been used as  machinery or equipment to commit an offence"
"under the Act, other than transporting the mineral can, fall under the category"
"of a machinery or equipment, which would be subjected to confiscation."
"It  is  abundantly  clear  that  from  the  very  outset  of  this  action,  the  Officer-in-"
"Charge of Damana Police had been well aware of the distinction between a vehicle"
"and machinery or equipment used in the commission of an offence under the"
"provisions of the Act. That may be the very reason why he has formulated two"
"separate charges against the two accused charged before the learned Magistrate"
"of Ampara. He has preferred the first charge only against the first accused for"
"digging earth soil without a valid permit using the loader vehicle mentioned in"
"the charge sheet. The second charge preferred against the second accused had"
"been on a different basis of transporting the soil in a truck without a valid permit."
