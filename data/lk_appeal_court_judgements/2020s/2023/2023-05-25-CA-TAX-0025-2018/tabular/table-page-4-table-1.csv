"","correctness of such nullification of assessment made by the TAC, in terms of"
"","section 11A(1) of the TAC Act, and if not, whether the jurisdiction of the Court"
"","of Appeal is governed by section 11A(6) of the TAC Act, and if so, whether the"

"","such nullification of assessment made by the TAC, in terms of section 11A(6)"
"","of the TAC Act;"
"","3.  Third,  if the annulment of the assessment is found to be erroneous, whether"
