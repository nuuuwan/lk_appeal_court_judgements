"[34] Let me turn to Garikapati Veerayya: v. N. Subbiah Choudhry , AIR 1957 SC"
"540,  wherein  a  suit  was  instituted  on  April  22,  1949,  and  the  right  of  appeal"
"vested in the parties thereto on that date was to be governed by the law as it"
"prevailed on that date. That is, on that date, the parties acquired the right, if"
"unsuccessful, to go on in an appeal from the Special Court to the High Court"
"and from the High Court to the Federal Court, provided the conditions thereof"
"were satisfied in that case. It was held that unless that right had been taken away"
"only  by  a  subsequent  enactment,  if  it  so  provided  expressly  or  by  necessary"
"intendment, and not otherwise."

"right which vests in a litigant at the date of the filing of the suit, and cannot be"
"taken away unless the legislature expressly or by necessary intendment says so; (ii)"
"an appeal is a continuation of the suit, and it is not merely that a right of appeal"
"cannot be taken away by a procedural enactment which is not made retrospective,"
"but the right cannot be impaired or imperilled nor can new conditions be attached"
"to the filing of the appeal; (iii) nor can a condition already existing be made more"
"onerous or more stringent so as to affect the right of appeal arising out of a suit"
"instituted prior to the enactment. This is because the  right to file an appeal is"
"crystallized on the institution of the application of the suit in the first instance."
"[36] From the decisions cited above, the following principles clearly emerge:"
