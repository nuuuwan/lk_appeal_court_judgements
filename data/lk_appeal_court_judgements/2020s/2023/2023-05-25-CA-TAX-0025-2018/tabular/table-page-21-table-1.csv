"[46] First, the  words in the first part of section 11A(6) “Any two or more Judges"
"o
f
 
the Court of Appeal may hear and determine any question of law arising on"
"the stated case”, is consistent with position in section 11A(1) that the questions"
"of law  arise on a case stated, and the Court of Appeal can answer any question"
"of law arising on the case stated. If the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is"
"restricted to the substantive matters of the assessment as contended by the"
"Respondent, there was no need for the legislature to use the words that the"
"Court of Appeal “may hear and determine any question of law arising on the"
"stated case”, and it could have easily used the words “..”any question of law"
"arising on the assessment determined by the Commission”."
"[
47] Second, the Respondent contended that the use of the words “”and” in"
"the  second  line  of  section  11A(6)  restrict  the    meaning  of  the  words  “any"
"question of law” and thus, “any question” in section 11A(6) is restricted to the"
"words  “confirm, reduce, increase or annul of the assessment determined by"
"the  commission”,  and  nothing  more.  The  Respondent  fails  to  understand"
"however, that section 11A(6) only refers to the appellate powers of the Court"
"of Appeal to determine any question of law arsing on the stated case,  and the"
"use of the word “and” in the second line of section 11A(6), does not restrict"
"the  words  “any  question  of  law”  to  the  determination  of  the  substantive"
"matters of the assessment."
"[
48] On the other hand, the word “may” after the word “and” in the second"
"line  and  the  word  “or”  in  the  fifth  line,  after  the  words  “confirm,  reduce,"
"increase,  or  annul  the  assessment  determined  by  the  Commission”  confirm"
"the position that the legislature has intended to provide two distinct powers"
"to the Court of Appeal in appeal by way of case stated in the determination"
"of the questions of law."
"[49] In my view, the second part of section 11A(6) is not restricted to the words"
"“confirm, reduce, increase, or annul the assessment” unless the legislature has"
"expressly  provided  that  the  right  of  any  aggrieved  party  to 
invoke  the"
"appellate  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under  section  11A(1)  is  restricted  to  the"
"determination  of  the  substantive  matters  of  the  assessment  determined  by"
"the TAC. On the contrary, the legislature has granted a substantive right of"
"appeal  by  way  of  case  stated  to  the  Appellant  to 
invoke  the  appellate"
"jurisdiction  of  this  Court  on  any  question  of  law  arising  on  the  case  stated"
"(facts and law determined by the TAC) for the opinion of the Court of Appeal."
"As  noted,  in  the  present  case,  the  assessment  was  annulled  on  the  ground"
