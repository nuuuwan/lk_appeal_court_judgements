"Commissioner-General was time barred for two reasons:"
"1.  No  valid  acknowledgement  of  the  receipt  of  the  appeal  in  terms  of"
"section  165(6)  of  the  TAC  Act  and  that  the  determination  of  the"
"Commissioner-General  has  not  been  made  within  a  period  of  2  years"
"from the date of the receipt of the appeal;"
"2.  The assessor had no legal authority to sign the acknowledgement of the"
"appeal and therefore, the determination of the Commissioner-General is"
"time barred."
