"appellant, as the case may be;"
"[19] This section has the following two limbs:"
"1
.  Any party who preferred an appeal against the decision of the TAC may make"
"an application requiring the TAC to state a case on a question of law for the"
"opinion of the Court of Appeal (substantive right of appeal by way of case"
"stated);"
"2.  Such application shall be made in writing and delivered to the secretary to"
"the  Commission,  together  with  a  fee  of  one  thousand  and  five  hundred"
"rupees,  within  one  month  from  the  date  on  which  the  decision  of  the"
"Commission  was  notified  in  writing  to  the  Commissioner-General  or  the"
"appellant, as the case may be. (procedural conditions for the exercise of such"
"statutory right)."
"[20] The second part of section 11A(1)  is a conditional one, that consists of a"
"mandatory requirement of entertaining and making the application to the TAC,"
"but that is a piece of procedural legislation, and it does not fall within the realm"
"of substantive law set out in the first part of section 11A(1). The TAC Act, in the"
"second part of section 11A(1) sets out the following procedural requisites of a"
"valid application to the TAC to state a case on a question of law, and unless such"
"requisites are satisfied, the application may not be entertained by the TAC, and"
"such  application  for  a  statutory  right  of  appeal  by  way  of  case  may  not  be"
