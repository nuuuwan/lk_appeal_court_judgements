"not, of course precluded from considering  any point upon which the actual"
"decision of the Board might be upheld, no matter what might have been"
"their reasons for arriving at that decision‚Äù."
"[56] In my view any finding of fact (and law) determined by the TAC constitutes"
"a  case  stated  and  any  question  of  law  can  arise  on  such  case  stated  and,"
"therefore, the Court of Appeal is entitled to ""hear and determine the question"
"or questions of law arising on such a case transmitted under this Act.  On the"
"other hand, the Court of Appeal can hear any question of law that is not set set"
"out in the case stated, if the determination of such point will either confirm or"
"annul the actual decision of the TAC, irrespective whether or not the whether"
"reasons to arrive at such question were considered by the TAC, provided that it"
"was a matter for consideration before the TAC."
"[57] Accordingly, it is absolutely clear that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal"
"is not limited only to a question of law that relates to the substantive matters"
"determined by the TAC, but the jurisdiction extends to any question of law that"
"arise on the case stated in respect of which the appellant has chosen to invoke"
"the appellate jurisdiction of this Court of Appeal in terms of section 11A(1) of"
"the TAC Act."
