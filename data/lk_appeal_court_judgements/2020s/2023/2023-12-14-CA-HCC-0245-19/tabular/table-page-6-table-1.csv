"The Learned High Court Judge himself called for the medical certificate from the"
"psychiatrist but without any inquiry, he had allowed the Prosecution to lead evidence and"
"thereafter found the Accused guilty of murder."
"I
t  will  be  convenient  to  refer  at  this  stage  to  those  provisions  of  the  Criminal"
"Procedure  Code  which have  a  bearing on the question  of procedure  arising  for Medical"
"Condition  at  the  commencement  of  the  trial  Chapter  XXXI  of  the  Criminal  Procedure"
"Code."
"Section 375(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 read as follows;"
"“if any person committed for trial before the High Court appears to the Court at"
"his trial to be of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making this defence, the"
"jury or (where the trial is without a jury) the Judge of the High Court shall in the first"
"instance try the fact of such unsoundness and incapacity, and if satisfied of the fact shall"
"find accordingly and thereupon the trial shall be postponed.”"
"There's no evidence to establish that the Learned High Court Judge had a voir dire"
"inquiry to find out whether the Accused is competent and fit to undergo his trial."
"I
 hold that the failure to hold an inquiry as required in section 375 (1) is a violation"
"of  the  fundamental  principle  of  Criminal  Procedure.  There  is  evidence  by  Dr.  Sunil"
"Pushpakumara Kandapola Arachchige who examined the Accused twice and a complaint"
"made by the deceased stating Accused had a long history of mental illness. The Learned"
"High  Court  Judge  could  have  acted  under  sections  376  to  379  and  he  would  have"
"proceeded as directed by Chapter XV. Instead of following the procedure the Learned High"
"Court Judge proceeded the trial and convicted the Appellant for the Murder."
"S
ince  the  Accused  is  convicted  and  sentenced,  we  set  aside  the  conviction  and"
"sentence imposed by the High Court Judge. We hold that the Learned High Court Judge"
"has failed to follow the procedure laid in the Criminal Procedure Code as the Accused has"
"failed  to  understand  the  charges  against  him.    Therefore,  we  set  aside  the  conviction"
"imposed on 02.07.2019."
