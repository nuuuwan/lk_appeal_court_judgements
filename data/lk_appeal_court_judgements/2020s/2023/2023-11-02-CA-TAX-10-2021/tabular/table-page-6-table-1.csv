"to the resident company is unnegotiable. At this instance, the burden is on the"
"Appellant 
to  showcase 
that 
the 
respondent  company 
is  not  profiting  or"
"produces less than ordinary profits. From the perusal of the TAC determination"
"and 
other 
assessment 
records 
it 
is 
evident 
to 
this  Court 
that  Rs."
"1,175,570,925/- is indicated to be the profit for the relevant years. This Court"
"notices 
that 
the 
Appellant 
claims 
a 
different 
amount, 
larger 
(Rs"
"1,357,403,648/-)  than  the  amount  mentioned  in  the  case  stated  to  be  the"
"royalty 
payment. 
There 
is  no 
reference 
to 
this 
amount 
in 
the 
TAC"
"determination as well. The Appellant moves on to base their submissions under"
"Section  82  relying  on  this  subsequent  amount  claiming 
it 
is  98%  of  the"
"Respondent  companyâ€™s  profit.  This  Court  is  confused  why  this  subsequent"
"amount has been brought in later at this stage, as it is not the mandate of this"
"Court to determine on questions of fact. However, in the interest of clarity and"
"as 
this 
fact 
is 
essential 
to 
interpret  above-mentioned 
legal  provisions,"
"considering  submissions  of  the  Respondent  and  company  audited  accounts,"
"this  Court  agrees  to  the  position  of  the  Respondent  that  the  amount  of  Rs"
"1,357,403,648/-  the  Appellant  is  relying  on  as  the  royalty  paid,  is  the  royalty"
"provision  and  not 
the  actual  royalty  paid,  which 
is  Rs.  585,  880,132/-."
"Therefore,  this  Court  deems  the  submissions  of  the  Appellant  under  this"
"provision to be mistaken, groundless and unsubstantiated."
"The Appellant refers to Section 103 of the IR Act together with S. 82 as well;"
"S. 103 - Where an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner is of the opinion that any"
"transaction which reduces or would have the effect of reducing the amount of tax"
"payable  by  any  person  is  artificial  or  fictitious  or  that  any  disposition  is  not  in"
"fact given effect to, he may disregard any such transaction or disposition and the"
"parties to the transaction or disposition shall be assessable accordingly"
"The submission of the Appellant is that as under S. 82(2) 98% of the profit was"
"transferred  to  the  New  Zealand  Milk  Brands  Ltd,  it  amounts  to  a  fictitious"
