"LARC itself in the first instance had invited him and with his participation had considered all the"
"material and arrived at a decision to pay the sum that is reflected in P21. This has been conveyed"
"to the Petitioner who after considering it, had agreed to the awarded sum. Subsequently, when the"
"Super LARC had decided to reconsider the award, they had once again informed the Petitioner to"
"come for an inquiry which was postponed. However subsequently, they had held a meeting and"
"arrived at the impugned decision without informing the Petitioner. In our view, the second decision"
"contained in P28 and communicated to the petitioner by P22 clearly violates the rules of natural"
"justice and the principle of audi alteram parte."
"We also find that the Respondents are estopped from denying the presence of the Petitioner for the"
"second inquiry as they themselves had notified the Petitioner to be present for the first inquiry and"
"also notified the Petitioner to be present for the second inquiry. However, there is no material to"
"demonstrate that the Respondents  have informed  the Petitioner to  be present  for the postponed"
"second inquiry that was held on 12.12.2017. This position was never contested by the Respondents."
"In  our  view,  this  ground  alone  is  sufficient  for  this  Court  to  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the"
"procedure adopted in arriving at the second decision which is impugned and reflected in P22 is"
"faulty and has to be quashed. In this regard, we have considered the judgments on fair hearing and"
"rules of natural justice and audi alteram parte."
