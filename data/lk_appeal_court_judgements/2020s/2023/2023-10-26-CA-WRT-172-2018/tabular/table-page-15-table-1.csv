"narrowing  or  inadequate  accessibility  to  the  Petitioner’s  land  as  a  ground  under  the  injurious"
"affectation. However, the learned Counsel for the Respondent strenuously argued that it was so"
"and it was substantiated with reference to the Petitioner’s appeal to the Super LARC. He further"
"contended that the late discovery of the availability of another access road was the main ground"
"for reducing the value of compensation."
"The Petitioner had sought to impugn the decision in P22 not only on the grounds that it violated"
"the rules of natural justice and the lack of fair hearing, but also urged that the Petitioner had a"
"legitimate expectation to get a fair hearing before the award was suspended. They also submitted"
"that in view of the fact that the Respondents have decided to come to the second hearing on the"
"basis  of  an  audit  report,  it  amounts  to  dictation  and  abdication  of  powers  of  the  Super  LARC."
"However, as this Court has held with the Petitioner on his original ground and decided to quash"
"the decision on the basis of violation of the rules of natural justice and lack of fair hearing, this"
"Court does not intend to go into the other grounds canvassed."
