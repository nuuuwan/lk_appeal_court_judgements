"Investment Co Vs. Johannesburg Town Council 1903 TS 111 at"
"115, enunciated that;"
"“Whenever a public body has a duty imposed upon it by statute,"
"and disregards important provisions of the statute, or is guilty of"
"gross irregularity or clear illegality in the performance of the duty,"
"this Court may be asked to review the proceedings complained"
"of and set aside or correct them.”"
"In this scenario, the decision marked as P18 is within the purview of"
"the  Payment  of  Gratuity  Act,  No.12  of  1983,  and  therefore,  the"
"grounds upon which the impugned decision is being challenged are"
"devoid  of  merits  and  misconceived  in  law.  Thus,  the  Application  is"
"dismissed. I make no order as to costs."
