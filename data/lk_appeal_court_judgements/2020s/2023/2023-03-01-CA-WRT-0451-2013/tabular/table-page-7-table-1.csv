"Act, even with an agreement, which is less favorable to the workman,"
"the  employer  is  not  permitted  to  implement  such  an  agreement,"
"which reads thus;"
"10  (1)” Where the gratuity payable to a workman is governed by"
"a collective agreement, award of an Industrial Court or arbitrator"
"under  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act  or  any  other  agreement,  the"
"computation of such gratuity in respect of his services shall be"
"made in accordance with the terms of such collective agreement,"
"award of an Industrial Court or arbitrator or other agreement as"
"the case may be, provided that the gratuity or terminal benefits"
"set  out  therein  are  more  favourable  to  the  workman  than  the"
"gratuity payable under this Act.”"
"In this scenario, the Petitioner cannot now take up the position that"
"the acceptance of the gratuity by the 4th Respondent on a later date"
"estops the 4th Respondent from agitating his statutory rights."
"In  a  nutshell,  admittedly,  the  4th  Respondent  is  entitled  to  the"
"gratuity for the said period and whereas the Petitioner Bank failed to"
"pay the same to the former on time. In the instant Application the"
"Petitioner does not challenge the computation of the surcharge in the"
"document marked P18. Hence, it is manifestly clear that there is a"
"breach  of  statutory  duty  by  the  Petitioner.  Failing  to  make  the"
"statutory payments by the employer to the employees is illegal. The"
"principle  of  illegality  is a  fundamental aspect  of  administrative  law"
"that governs the actions of administrative agencies and other public"
"bodies.  It  refers  to  the  idea  that  an  administrative  action  that  is"
"contrary to the law, or otherwise illegal, can be challenged and set"
"aside by Courts."
"The principle of illegality is closely tied to the concept of procedural"
"fairness, which requires that administrative decisions be made in a"
"fair and impartial manner. If an administrative action is found to be"
"procedurally unfair, it may also be considered illegal and subject to"
"review by Courts."
"Where a statute gives a public authority power to perform an action"
"and  the  public  authority  acts  outside  its  jurisdiction,  its  action"
"becomes illegal. Therefore, in such instances the court may declare"
"its action as ultra vires by reason of it being illegal. Innes CJ in the"
