"It  was  the  main  contention  of  the  3rd,  4th  and  5th  Respondents  that  the  1st  Respondent-"
"Petitioner-Appellant  had  failed  to  comply  with  the  Supreme  Court  Rules  and  that  the  1st"
"Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had not shown the existence of exceptional circumstances"
"to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court to revise or set aside the"
"Order of the learned Additional Magistrate made under Section 69(1) of the Primary Courtsâ€™"
"Procedure Act."
"In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd [1987] 1 SLR 5"
"it was held that it is settled law the exercise of revisionary powers of the Appellate Court is"
"confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention."
"Furthermore, it has been observed in superior court decisions that superior courts have always"
"declined  to  entertain  revision  applications  when  exceptional  circumstances  have  not  been"
"averred in those applications."
"It is imperative to note that the learned High Court Judge held the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-"
"Appellant  had  not  satisfied  court  that  exceptional  circumstances  exist  to  exercise  the"
"revisionary powers of court."
"Hence, the learned High Court Judge has judiciously dismissed the revision application made"
"by the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. Thus, we see no reason for us to interfere with"
"the said dismissal of the application."
"Thus, this appeal is dismissed with tax cost."
