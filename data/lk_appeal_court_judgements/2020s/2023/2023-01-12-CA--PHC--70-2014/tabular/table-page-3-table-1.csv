"Prasantha De Silva, J."
"Judgment"
"The Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station-Kandy had filed an information in the Additional"
"Magistrate’s  Court  of Kandy  in  case  bearing  No.  55160  in  terms  of  Section  66(1)  (a)  of  the"
"Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, with regard to a roadway which had been used"
"by the 1st Respondent and had been obstructed by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents."
"It is seen that the learned Additional Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge"
"had  taken  all  necessary  steps  stipulated  in  the  Primary  Courts’  Procedure  Act.  After  the"
"conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Additional Magistrate had made an Order on the 24th of"
"January 2013 and held that 1st and 2nd Respondents were not entitled to have a servitudanal"
"right of way over the land of 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents."
"Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 1st Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary"
"jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Kandy. It appears that the learned High Court Judge"
"had observed the learned Additional Magistrate had correctly identified the dispute amongst"
"parties as one relating to a roadway, which comes within the purview of Section 69(1) of the"
"Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"Upon the evidence placed before the learned Additional Magistrate, it was revealed that the"
"1st Respondent-Petitioner is a licensee of 3rd, 4th, 5th Respondents and had been living in the"
"back  yard  of  the  land  owned  by  the  said  Respondents  with  a  separate  access  through  Sri"
"Dhammadhassi Mawatha. Apparently, the dispute has arisen among the parties as the 3rd, 4th,"
"and 5th Respondents had put up a gate to the entrance of their land to protect and safeguard"
"the property from being used by strangers."
"As such, it is observable that the learned Additional Magistrate had come to the correct finding"
"of facts and law and held with the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents determining that 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents are not entitled to a servitudanal right of way over the disputed road way across"
