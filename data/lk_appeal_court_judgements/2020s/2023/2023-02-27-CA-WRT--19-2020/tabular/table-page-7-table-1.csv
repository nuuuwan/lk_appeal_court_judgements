"Exchange  Act  is  vested  with  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka.  Section  2(1)  of  the  former  Act"
"states that the Central Bank “as the agent of the Government” is “responsible” for carrying out"
"the provisions of the Act, whilst Section 2(1) of the new Act states that the Central Bank “as"

"included  foreign  currency.  In  contrast,  the  Foreign  Exchange  Act  does  not  explicitly  contain"
"such a provision. If one stops at that point, then it appears that the Customs Ordinance will"

"only for such purpose, up to such limits and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed"
"by the Ministry by an Order published in the Gazette. [emphasis added]"
"The Minister (that is the Minister assigned the subject of Central Bank (Section 33))"
