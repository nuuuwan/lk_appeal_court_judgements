"The  Petitioners,  an  Indian  and  two  Sri  Lankans,  were  arrested  by  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs at the Bandaranaike International Airport under the Customs Ordinance No. 17 of"
"1869, as amended, for allegedly attempting to fraudulently remove foreign exchange from Sri"
"Lanka, while they were in the transit area/lounge. They were produced before the Magistrate’s"
"Court of Negombo and remanded for the duration of the investigation under Section 127A of"
"the Customs Ordinance. Subsequently, the Petitioners were released on bail by the Provincial"
"High Court holden in Negombo, under Section 127C of the Customs Ordinance. While matters"
"remained as such, the Petitioners were summoned for an inquiry in terms of Section 8(1) of the"
"Customs Ordinance. The Petitioners raised a jurisdictional objection to the conducting of the"

"in  open  court  on  16th  March  2022),  are  whether  the  Sri  Lanka  Customs  has  jurisdiction  to"
"conduct this inquiry in relation to matters involving foreign currency and whether the Customs"
