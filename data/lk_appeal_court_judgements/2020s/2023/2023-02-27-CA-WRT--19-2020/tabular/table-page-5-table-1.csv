"via Sri Lanka. He departed from India on the 12th of July 2018 and arrived in Sri Lanka on the"
"same day at around 10:40 am. The connecting flight to Singapore was at 1:55 am on the 13th of"
"July. The 2nd and 3rd Petitioners, Sri Lankans, entered the airport on the 12th of July, intending"
"to travel to, respectively, India and Thailand. The 2nd and 3rd Petitioners claim that they each"
"had in their possession a sum of foreign currency which they had declared at the behest of the"
"Customs officials; the 2nd Petitioner claims to have had 4300 Euros and the 3rd Petitioner claims"
"to have had 4300 Euros and 800 USD. These sums of money did not exceed the threshold at"
"which a declaration ought to have been made."
"The Petitioners were observed by the Customs Officers on CCTV cameras (as set out"
"in  the  report  of  the  Superintendent  of  Customs  “X4”  and  further  reports  presented  to  the"
"Magistrate’s Court “P2(b)”). This was on the basis that the Customs obtained information that"
"some person was collecting foreign currency notes from other passengers leaving Sri Lanka in"
"the transit area/lounge. The Respondents contend that the 1st Petitioner had in his possession"
"foreign  currency  to  the  tune  of  LKR    48,761,538.39/-.  It  is  also  contended  by  the  Customs"
"Officers that, some foreign currency notes in his possession bore the same serial numbers of"
"foreign currency notes that were previously in the possession of the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners. The"
"2nd  and  3rd  Petitioners  admit  that  they  handed  over  the  total  sum  of  8700  Euros  to  the  1st"
"Petitioner so that the latter could purchase electronic items from Singapore for the former. The"
"Petitioners were questioned and then arrested by the Customs Officers, acting under Section"
"127 of the Customs Ordinance. All three Petitioners were alleged to have acted in contravention"
"of  Sections  12,44,  and  107A  of  the  Customs  Ordinance  read  with  Section  8  of  the  Foreign"
"Exchange Act together with the Regulations promulgated thereunder. As mentioned above, the"
"Petitioners  who  were arrested  were  subsequently  produced  before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  of"
"Negombo and remanded on the 14th of July, under Section 127A of the Customs Ordinance (vide"
"journal entry dated 14th July 2018 – “P2(A)(i)” on page 96 of the Brief). They were granted bail"
