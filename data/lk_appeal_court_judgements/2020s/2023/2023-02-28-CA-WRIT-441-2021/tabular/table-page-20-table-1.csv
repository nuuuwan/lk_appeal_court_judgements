"The 1st Respondent gives much weight to certain assertions made by the COI to justify his"
"decision to forward an indictment against the Petitioner. One of such observations made"
"by the COI (p.718 of the docket) is that although, the Petitioner was advised of the day on"
"which the evidence of several witnesses from the three State Banks would be led, neither"
"the Petitioner nor his Counsel appeared before the COI on the particular day. I am of the"
"view  that  the  Petitioner  and  the  1st  Respondent  are  raising  arguments  on  the  said"
"observations  to  interrogate  on  whether  the  COI  has  not  complied  the  rules  of  Natural"
"Justice when issuing the Report."
