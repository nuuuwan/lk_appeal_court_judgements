"Case before the High Court-at-Bar"
"After  serving  the  indictment  to  the  accused  in  the  High  Court-at-Bar  case  bearing  No."
"HC(TAB) 2445/2021 and before the matter was taken up for trial, preliminary objections"
"have been raised by some of the accused. The such preliminary objections raised on behalf"
"of the 1st, 4th, 5th and the 6th Respondents have been rejected by the High Court-at-Bar."
"But  the  preliminary  objection  raised  on  behalf  of  the  7th  Respondent  was  taken  into"
"consideration by Court. The argument in the High Court-at-Bar in respect of the objection"
"was whether a charge under the Offences Against the Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982,"
"as amended (Public Property Act) could be framed against a legal person. The High Court-"
"at-Bar considering all submissions has arrived at a conclusion that no charges under the"
"Public Property Act could be framed against a legal person and further, no charge on the"
"offence  of  abetting  can  be  maintained  based  on  an  alleged  offence  under  the  Public"
"Property Act against a legal person. As such, the accused have been discharged by order"
"dated 06.12.2021 in respect of the offences described in charges bearing Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to"
"11 of the indictment."
"The Petitioner tendering to Court a copy of the said order dated 06.12.2021 along with his"
"counter  affidavit  submitted  that  the  decision  made  by  the  1st  Respondent  to  indict  the"
"Petitioner and/or exhibit information against the Petitioner does not disclose an offence"
"in terms of Section 5(1) of Public Property Act read with Sections 102 and 303 of the Penal"
"Code. It was informed that the Attorney General has lodged an appeal against the said"
"order of the High-Court-at-Bar and one of such applications are still pending before the"
"Supreme Court."
"Reliefs against the decisions of the COI"
"One of the reliefs sought by the Petitioner is for a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions"
"made  in  the  said  Report  of  the  COI  as  described  in  paragraph  (g)  of  the  prayer  of  the"
"Petition.  The  Petitioner  asserts  that  he  was  not  questioned  by  the  COI  at  any  stage"
"regarding the auction held on 29.03.2016 & regarding the meeting held on 28.03.2016 and"
"as such the COI never questioned the Petitioner regarding the subject matter of the case"
"before  the  High  Court-at-Bar.  The  COI  has  called  witnesses  of  the  three  State  Banks"
"namely, Bank of Ceylon, Peopleâ€™s Bank and National Savings Bank after the testimony of"
"the Petitioner before the COI was concluded."
