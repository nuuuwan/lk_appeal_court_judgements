"In  The  Attorney  General  vs.  Sivapragasam  et  al,  60  NLR  468,  Sansoni  J.  referring  to  the"
"prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General has said; (at page 470 & 471);"
"""Mr.  Nadesan  argued  that  it  is  not  open  to  a  Crown  Counsel  who  claims  to  appear  and"
"conduct a prosecution to say that he is not leading evidence. He went so far as to say that no"
"prosecutor, not even the Attorney-General, has a discretion in the matter; and that if there is"
"evidence available he must lead it, and if he does not lead it he ceases to appear and conduct"
"the prosecution and the complainant or his pleader would then be entitled to prosecute and"
"lead evidence.  With respect, I entirely disagree with this proposition. The logical result of"
"accepting it would be to place a duty on prosecuting counsel to lead evidence even when he"
"knows that all the available evidence will fail to establish the charge against the accused. No"
"prosecuting counsel with any regard for the Court or his own position as an officer of justice"
"need follow such a course. The only object of leading evidence for the prosecution is to establish"
"the ingredients of the charge, and if counsel is not satisfied in his own mind that the totality"
"of the evidence available will achieve that result, he will be failing in his duty to the Court"
"and to the accused if he were to insist on a fruitless recording of evidence and a senseless waste"
"of time. It is quite wrong to suppose that a prosecuting counselâ€™s duty is a mere mechanical"
"leading of evidence regardless of the object for which evidence is led. If he is satisfied that the"
"evidence is insufficient to prove the charge and insists on leading evidence, how can he in"
"conscience ask the Court to convict the accused?"""
