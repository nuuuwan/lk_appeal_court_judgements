"One  can  simply  argue  based  on  a  Sinhala  glossary  that  the  word  ‘material’  includes"
"information  (ත ොරතුරු)  and  matters  ( රුණු).  But  I  am  doubtful  whether  the  word"
"‘evidence’ is embodied without any ambiguity within the word ‘material’. Anyhow, the"
"legislature has used similar words in Section 26(1)(c) of the COI Act by which the Attorney"
"General has the authority in the conduct of an inquiry or investigation under the COI Act"
"to  examine  any  witness  summoned  by  the  Commission,  if  it  appears  to  him  that  the"
"evidence  of  such  witness  is  material  to,  or  has  disclosed  information  relevant  to,  the"
"investigation or inquiry as the case may be."
