"","‘Some  of  the  grounds  for  judicial  review  of  the  prosecutorial  powers  of  Director  of  Public"
"","Prosecutions under the Constitution of Fiji, which are similar to the powers of the English"
"","and Nigerian Attorneys-General, were listed in Matalulu v. DPP1. In a passage that was"
"","cited and endorsed by the Privy Council in Mohit2, and adopted by the House of Lords in R"
"","(Corner House Research and another) v. Director of the Serious Fraud Office (the BAE case)3,"
"","the Supreme Court of Fiji stated that a purported exercise of power would be reviewable if it"
"were made:",""
"1.","In excess of the DPP’s constitutional or statutory grants of power – such as an attempt to"
"","institute proceedings in a court established by a disciplinary law …."
"","2.  When, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, the DPP could be shown to have"
"","acted under the direction or control of another person or authority and to have failed to"
"","exercise his or her own independent discretion – if the DPP were to act upon a political"
"","instruction the decision could be amenable to review."

"4.","In abuse of the process of the court in which it was instituted, although the proper forum"
"","for review of that action would ordinarily be the court involved."
"","5.  Where the DPP has fettered his or her discretion by a rigid policy – eg one that precludes"
"","prosecution of a specific class of offences.’"
