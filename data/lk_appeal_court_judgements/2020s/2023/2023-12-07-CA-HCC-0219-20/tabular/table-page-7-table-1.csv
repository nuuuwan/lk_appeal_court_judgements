"the  prosecution  ought  to  have  allowed  the  witness  to  testify  freely  without  prompting  or"
"leading,  so 
that 
the  credibility  of 
the  witness  could  have  been  properly  evaluated."
"Immediately  after  witness  Vasudevan  had  referred  to  the  purported  conversation,  the"
"Learned State Counsel had shot the question “කව්ද මරුවා කිව්වව්?”Suggesting that the name of"
"the deceased transpired during the conversation which was not the case. The Learned State"
"Counsel should never have asked this question and on the other hand ought not to have been"
"permitted by the Learned High Court Judge as up to that point of his evidence, Vasudevan"
"had not referred to the identity of the dead person."
"In response to this question, Vasudevan answered “Uma-Devi”."
"The manner of questioning not only diminishes the evidentiary value of the testimony"
"but  also tarnishes the  testimonial  trustworthiness  of  the witness,  as one could reasonably"
"expect the witness to have come out with the name “Uma-Devi” on his own, if that name was"
"referred to in the conversation between Salam and the accused-appellant."
"………….."
"Here again, I observe that the manner in which this witness had been questioned by"
"Up  to  this  point  of  questioning,  the  witness  had  never  said  that  both  the  accused"
"applicant and the deceased 2nd accused had approached him to pawn an item of jewelry."
"The question (referred to above) suggests to the witness that both of them (Salam and"
"the accused-appellant) in fact had come to his shop to pawn jewelry."
"Thus, 
the  manner  of  questioning  referred 
to  above  has 
thereby  substantially"
"diminished the probative value of the testimony. “"
"With the above observation by Justice Aluwihare about leading questions, when we"
"consider  the  question  put  forward  by  the  prosecution, soon  after  prosecutrix  said that she"
"couldn’t remember anything as she was unconscious. What the Court can gather is that the"
"prosecution wants  the witness to say  to  the  Court  that  the  Accused has  inserted  his  male"
"organ into the vagina to prove the charge of rape, by doing so the question arise whether she"
"was a trustworthy witness."
