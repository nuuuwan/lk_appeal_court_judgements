"Q : witness, inside what, did thus Accused keep his male organ?"
"A:  He kept it in my vagina."
"Q : Witness, for how long did the Accused keep his male organ inside your vagina and do it"
"in that manner?"

"In my view, this question is clearly a leading question, as it suggests that the name of the"
"deceased was referred to by the 2nd accused in the course of the alleged conversation."
"……………."
"I also wish to state that the manner in which the prosecution has led evidence in this"
"case by the prosecution is not desirable. Vasudevan is a belated witness by a considerable"
"time gap and who had also had some displeasure with the accused-appellant. In this context"
