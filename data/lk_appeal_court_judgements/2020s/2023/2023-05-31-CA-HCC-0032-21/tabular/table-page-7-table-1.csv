"The position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) was that there was"
"no basis for the appellant to maintain a stand that he acted exercising his right"
"of private defence. Referring to the evidence of the eyewitnesses and also to the"
"medical evidence, it was his position that the deceased has attempted to evade"
"being  attacked,  which  resulted  in  him  receiving  most  of  the  injuries  that  has"
"been described by the JMO as defensive injuries."
"Under the circumstances, it was his position that given the facts of this matter,"
"it would not attract the provisions of the exceptions in terms of section 294 of"
"the Penal Code and the appeal should be dismissed."
