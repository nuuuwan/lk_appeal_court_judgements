"to confront him. I find that his position acceptable since he has gone along with"
"his wife to the house of the deceased, which suggests that he had been provoked"
"due to the alleged affair and he wanted to confront the deceased in front of his"
"wife."
"Although the appellant has claimed that he went there to hand over his wife to"
"the  deceased,  the  uncontradicted  evidence  of  the  wife  of  the  deceased  clearly"
"establishes the fact that he was armed with a knife and had threatened her with"
"death  to  her  husband.  After  a  short  while,  the  appellant  had  confronted  the"
"deceased, and in the ensuing confrontation, the deceased has sustained the fatal"
"injury which resulted in his death. It is evidence that at that instance also he"
"was with his wife."
"The evidence where it has been stated that the deceased also took an iron rod in"
"his  hand  is  clearly  an  action  when  he  faced  with  the  confrontation  of  the"
"appellant. There is no evidence to show that he has used the iron rod to attack"
"the appellant other than using it to defend himself as clearly suggested by the"
"injuries sustained to his hands."
"However, it is my view that the evidence clearly suggests that the appellant has"
"acted under the provocation in his belief that the deceased was carrying on an"
"affair with his wife. It appears that he has lost his self-control due to that reason."
"There had been no previous enmity between the parties. The evidence provides"
"a clear picture that there was no time gap between the alleged finding of a phone"
"by the appellant and his going to the house of the deceased with his wife and"
"later confronting the deceased."
"In a criminal case it is necessary to consider the evidence of the prosecution and"
"that of the defence on an equal footing and in its totality and come to a finding"
"in that regard."
