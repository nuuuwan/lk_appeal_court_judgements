"forward  by  the  appellant  that  he  acted  in  the  exercise  of  his  right  of"
"private defence."
"In other words, the main contention of the learned President’s Counsel was that"
"the appellant was forced to cause injuries to the deceased acting in self defence"
"because the deceased attacked him using an iron rod. It was his contention that"
"he should have the benefit of the defence of the right of private defence in terms"
"of section 89 of the Penal Code which says that, “Nothing is an offence which is"
"done in the exercise of the right of private defence.”"
"The learned President’s Counsel was specific that he is not relying on exceptions"
"mentioned  in  section  294  of  the  Penal  Code,  where  culpable  homicide  is  not"
"murder if it can be shown that the actions of the appellant fall under exception"
"1 or exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code."
"The learned President’s Counsel relied heavily on the injuries found on the body"
"of the deceased to claim that the injuries to the fingers and hands of the deceased"
"are  injuries  caused  when  the  appellant  attempted  to  grab  the  iron  rod,  the"
"deceased  was  attempting  to  use  against  him.  It  was  his  contention  that  the"
"evidence  led  in  this  action  clearly  suggests  that  the  appellant  acted  using  his"
"right of private defence and the learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate"
"or consider that aspect in his judgement. On that basis, he argued strenuously"
"that the conviction should be overturned and the appellant should be acquitted"
"of the charges."
"However,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  also  admitted  that,  at  the  trial,  the"
"evidence of the wife of the deceased has not been challenged at material points,"
"and at one point, took up the position that the appellant may have exceeded his"
"right of private defence."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  cited  the  judgement  of  The  Queen  Vs.  S.  A."
"Jogrest Perera 70 NLR 27 to substantiate his argument."
