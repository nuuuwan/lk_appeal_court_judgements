"had been clearly defined by the JMO by expressing the opinion that 10 out of"
"the  11  injuries  are  defensive  injuries  which  means  that  the  deceased  has"
"attempted to avoid him being attacked by the appellant."
"I am in no position to agree with the contention that the injuries observed by the"
"JMO  on  the  fingers  and  hands  of  the  deceased  are  injuries  sustained  by  him"
"when the appellant attempted to take the iron rod from the deceased, as there"
"was no evidence placed before the Court to come to such a conclusion."
"For  the  reasons  considered  as  above,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  ground  of  appeal"
"raised by the learned President’s Counsel."
"It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  before  the  trial  Court  that  the  appellant  has"
"maintained the position that the incident occurred as a result of him discovering"
"an illicit affair between his wife and the deceased. It had been his position that"
"he  wanted  to  confront  the  deceased  along  with  his  wife  and  hand  over  her  to"
"him,  and  that  was  the  reason  why  he  went  to  the  deceased’s  house  and  later"
"confronted the deceased while he was driving the hand tractor."
"In  giving  evidence  under  oath  before  the  Court,  he  has  maintained  the  same"
"position,  but  has  claimed  that  when  he  confronted  the  deceased,  it  was  the"
"deceased  who  attempted  to  assault  him  with  an  iron  rod,  which  resulted  him"
"attacking the deceased using the knife he was carrying. I have already decided"
"that  being  the  aggressor  and  being  the  person  who  was  armed,  when  he  first"
"confronted the deceased, the appellant has no basis to claim that he exercised"
"his right of private defence."
"Although the appellant has not directly taken up the position that he acted due"
"to  being  deprived  of  self-control  by  grave  and  sudden  provocation,  where  his"
"action would fall under section 297 of the Penal Code, which amounts to culpable"
"homicide not amounting to murder, it is trite law that there is a duty cast upon"
"the trial Judge to consider whether there is evidence before the Court to come to"
"such a conclusion."
