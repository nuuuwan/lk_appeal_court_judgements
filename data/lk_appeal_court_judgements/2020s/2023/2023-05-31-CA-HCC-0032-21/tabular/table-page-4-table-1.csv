"inquest, he stated that the deceased attempted to grab a club from the toolbox"
"of the tractor while this confrontation was taking place."
"PW-04 in his evidence in chief has stated the same thing, but the Counsel who"
"represented the appellant has confronted him in his cross-examination on the"
"basis that he has failed to mention that fact to the police."
"Under cross examination PW-03 has stated that he came to know later that the"
"incident was due to a clandestine affair between the deceased and the wife of the"
"appellant."
"According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), he has observed"
"11 cut and stab wounds on the body of the deceased. The1st cut injury was near"
"the left shoulder while the 3rd to 11th cut injuries had been in the hands of the"
"deceased.  Injury  number  02  which  was  the  fatal  stab  wound  had  been  at  the"
"heart of the deceased and the JMO has opined that the said injury number 02"
"was essentially a fatal injury where death would be inevitable within a short span"
"of time."

"prosecution case, he has chosen to give evidence under oath."
"It had been his evidence that on the day of the incident, he came home to have"
"a cup of tea after attending to his vegetable cultivation around 10 a.m., and saw"
"a  mobile  phone  in  the  bedroom  of  the  house.  Upon  inspecting  the  phone,  he"
"discovered that  it was a phone belonging to the deceased. It was his evidence"
"that there was a rumour in the village about an illicit affair between the deceased"
"and his wife, and when he confronted his wife, she admitted that it was given by"
"the deceased to her. Due to anger, he smashed the phone, and it had been his"
"evidence that he informed his wife that he would hand over her to the deceased"
"and took her in his bike to the house of the deceased. Unable to find the deceased"
"in  his  house,  he  returned  but  saw  him  coming  driving  a  land  master  and"
"confronted him."
