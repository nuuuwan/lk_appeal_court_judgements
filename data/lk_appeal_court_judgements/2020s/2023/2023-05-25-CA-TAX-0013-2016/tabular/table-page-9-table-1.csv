"Romesh de Silva and Mr. Gunathilleke referred us to those two questions decided"
"by the TAC upon which the assessment was annulled by the TAC (other than the"
"issue of the writ),  and both Counsel addressed us on those two questions decided"
"by  the  TAC,  and  the  separate  issue  about  the  proper  remedy  available  to  the"
"Appellant. We are now invited to express the opinion by Mr. Romesh de Silva on"
"those two questions of law decided by the TAC, and the availability of the proper"
"remedy, while taking the stand that the answer to all three questions cannot set"
"aside the TAC decision.   Though the words “reasons are not  communicated “are"
"not specifically stated in the first part of the question of law No. 1,  it is undisputed"
"that the only questions that were raised before the TAC by way of a preliminary"
"objection and decided by the TAC were the aforesaid two questions. When the"
"question of law No. 1 refers to the words “a question of law”, it is obvious that"
"the TAC referred to the said two questions decided by them in its determination"
"and sought our opinion on those two questions, one of which is that the reasons"
"were  not  communicated  to  the  respondent.  For  those  reasons,  I  hold  that  the"
"question of law No. 1  includes the question  whether the TAC erred in holding"
"that  the  reasons  were  not  communicated  and  it  sought  our  opinion  on  that"
"question as well, though not specifically mentioned in those words"
"[18]  In  any  event,  any  failure  on  the  part  of  the  TAC  to  include  any  specific"
"question  of  law  on  whether  the  reasons  were  communicated  or  not,  does  not"
"preclude the Court of Appeal from considering such question specifically raised"
"and considered by the TAC. It is any question of law arising on the stated case"
"that may be heard and determined by the Court of Appeal, but the power of the"
"Court  of  Appeal  is  not  confined  to  the  questions  of  law  are  not  confined  the"
"questions identified in the Case Stated. I  am fortified with  my view by the judicial"
