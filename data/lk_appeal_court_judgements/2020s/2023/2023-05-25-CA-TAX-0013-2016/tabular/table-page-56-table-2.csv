"very root of the matter and is independent of the quantum. It concerns the"
"very exercise of power and is a fit matter for Writ jurisdiction. An application"
"f
or Writ of Certiorari is the proper remedy.’"
"[142] It is to be noted that that  was a case where the taxpayer applied to the"
"Court of Appeal by way of a writ to quash the assessment on the ground that"
"the assessor did not give written reasons for rejecting the return. The Court"
"of Appeal granted the writ of certiorari quashing the notice of assessment"
"and  the  CGIR  appealed  to  the  Supreme  Court.  In  that  case,  the  taxpayer"
"exercised his right of appeal to the CGIR and raised the time bar objection"
"and  thereafter  the  taxpayer  appealed  to  the  TAC.  Thereafter,  the    CGIR"
"appealed to the Court of Appeal therefrom. The principal issue, in that case,"
"was  the  duty  of  the  assessor  to  give  reasons  in  terms  of  the  mandatory"
"provisions of the Inland revenue Act. The Supreme Court has only considered"
"the  duty  on  the  part  of  the  assessor  to  communicate  the  reasons  to  the"
"taxpayer and it did not consider (i) the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to"
"hear and determine any question of law that was decided by the Board; and"
"(ii) the validity of any annulment of the assessment without considering the"
"substantive matters. Hence, the Supreme Court stated that “An application"
"f
or Writ of Certiorari is the proper remedy” , but it did not say that it is the"
"only remedy. Hence, it is not binding on us in the present case."
"[143] It is not in dispute that the TAC has got authority to rule on its own"
"jurisdiction, including ruling on any objection with respect to the existence"
"or  validity  of  the  assessment,  in  addition  to  substantive  matters  of  the"
"assessment.  If  a  jurisdictional  question  or  the  extent  thereof  is  disputed"
"before a tribunal, the tribunal must necessarily decide it unless the statute"
"provides  otherwise.  (See  Judicial  Review  of  Administrative  Law  by  H.W.R."
