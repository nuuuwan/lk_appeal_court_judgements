"[104] On the other hand, the word “may” after the word “and” in the second"
"line  and  the  word  “or”  in  the  fifth  line,  after  the  words  “confirm,  reduce,"
"increase, or annul the assessment determined by the Commission” confirm"
"the position that the legislature has intended to provide two distinct powers"
"to the Court of Appeal in appeal by way of case stated in the determination"
"of the questions of law."
"[
105] In my view, the second part of section 11A(6) is not restricted to the"
"words  “confirm,  reduce, 
increase,  or  annul  the  assessment”  unless  the"
"legislature has expressly provided that the right of any aggrieved party to"
"invoke  the  appellate 
jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under  section  11A(1) 
is"
"restricted to the determination of the substantive matters of the assessment"
"determined  by  the  TAC.  On  the  contrary,  the  legislature  has  granted  a"
"substantive right of appeal by way of case stated to the Appellant to invoke"
"the appellate jurisdiction of this Court on any question of law arising on the"
"case stated (facts and  law determined by the TAC) for the opinion of the"
"Court of Appeal.  As noted, in the present case, the assessment was annulled"
"on the ground that the notice of assessment is invalid because it was not in"
"conformity  with  the  mandatory  requirements  under  section  194(1)  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act."
"[
106]  Aggrieved  by  the  said  annulment  of  the  assessment,  the  Appellant"
"preferred  an  appeal  by  way  of  case  stated  and  the  questions  of 
law"
"submitted  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  relate  to  the  validity  of  the  notice  of"
"assessment, which is a question of law that arises on the case stated  under"
"section 11A(1). That annulment of assessment is a decision that is part and"
"parcel of the case stated [see- section 11A(2)] and thus, all the questions of"
"law that pertain to that decision arise on the stated case for the opinion of"
"this Court. In addition, the legislature has clearly provided in section 11A(6)"
"that the Court of Appeal has powers to hear and determine “any question"
"of law” arise on the stated case submitted to the Court for its opinion under"
"section 11A(2), which includes almost all the questions of law submitted by"
"the TAC for the opinion of this Court."
"[107] In view of the aforesaid decisions referred to in paragraphs 90-92 of"
"this judgment, the right of appeal is  a vested right in the first instance, but,"
"the legislature by express words can always change the nature of right to"
"prefer an appeal. In the instant case, the right of appeal by way of a case"
"stated, is a substantive right granted under Section 11A (1) of the TAC Act."
