"in a clear and comprehensive manner as to to why the Respondent was not"
"qualified for the exemption under section 21G. He referred to the letter of"
"the assessor dated 02.09.2008, and submitted that the assessor has set out"
"reasons why the Respondent was not entitled to the exemption;"
"2.  The TAC erred in its determination that the non-reference to the section"
"renders the assessment invalid. His submission was that in terms of section"
"135 of the Inland revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000, the assessor has mentioned"
"the amount of income and the amount of tax charged and therefore, the"
"assessor  has  complied  with  the  relevant  requirements.  He  referred  to"
"section 164 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 and section 195(1)"
"of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006  and submitted that notice of"
"assessment  will  not  be  affected  by  reason  of  any  failure  to  mention  the"
"section under which the notice of assessment was issued as it the substance"
"and not the form that matters;"
"3.  The TAC cannot annul an assessment purely on a procedural matter without"
"going into the substantive questions of imposition of the tax payable."
