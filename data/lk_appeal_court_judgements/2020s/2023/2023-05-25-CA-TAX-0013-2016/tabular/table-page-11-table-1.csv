"decision of the Board might be upheld, no matter what might have been"
"their reasons for arriving at that decision‚Äù."
"[21] In my view any finding of fact (and law)  determined by the TAC is part of"
"the  case  stated  and  any  question  of  law  can  arise  on  such  case  stated  and"
"therefore, the Court of Appeal is entitled to ""hear and determine the question or"
"questions of law arising on such a case stated, whether any question is set out"
"in the case stated transmitted to the Court of Appeal or any party failed to make"
"an  application  to  add  such  question  where  that  question  arises  on  the  case"
"stated and decided by the TAC.  Accordingly, I  am of the view that in the present"
"case,  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  not  precluded  from  considering,  the  question"
"whether the TAC erred in law in holding that the reasons for not accepting the"
"retun of income were not communicated, even if no specific question of law was"
"not set out in the case stated transmitted to this Court by the TAC."
"[22] For those reasons,  I hold that the contention of the Respondent that the"
"Court of Appeal cannot decide the question whether the TAC erred in holding"
"that the reasons were not communicated to the Respondent is highly technical"
"in nature and I reject that contention."
