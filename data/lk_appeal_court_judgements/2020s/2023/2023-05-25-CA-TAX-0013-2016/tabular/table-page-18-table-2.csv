"","failure to give reasons is fatal to the assessment. The Respondent relies on the"

"I","smail v Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra)."
"","“Before  I  deal with the changes brought about by the amendment of  the"
"","Revenue  Law,  No.  30 of  1978,  I  would refer to the bounds within  which  an"
"","Assessor could  have  rejected  and  substituted his own  assessment  under"
"","section  93  and  section  94  of  the  Inland Revenue  Law  prior  to  1978.  The"
"","courts  have  considered  the  far reaching arbitrary powers granted to an"
"","Assessor under the existing law  in  several cases and  have from time to time"
"","commented on the improper  approach  made  by  assessors  in  exercising"
"","those  powers. The  areas  of  dispute  between  an  assessor  and  assessee"
"","would  necessarily  revolve  around  the  reasons of the Assessor for, and the"
"","basis  of  his  making  the  arbitrary  assessment  of  income  or wealth. But"
"","the  assessee  was  completely  in  the  dark  in  regard  to  the reasons  or"
"","basis  for  not  accepting the return even when the notice of  assessment  was"
"","served  on  him  under  section  95.  An  assessee, when  he filed his appeal"
"","could therefore not formulate his grounds of  appeal  except  in  general  terms."
"","However,  under  the  provisions dealing  with  the,appeal  in  section 97  (2)"
"","he was obliged to set out the  precise  grounds  of  such  appeal  and"
"","necessarily  he  had  to confine  himself  to  such  grounds  when  the  appeal"
"","was  considered by the  Commissioner” (p. 170)."
"","I

case  he  proposes to  use  against the  assessee the result of  any   private"
"","enquiries  made  by  him, he    must communicate    to    th e    assessee"
"","the    substance   of   the information   so  proposed   to   be   utilized  to"
"","such an  extent as  to   put   the   assessee  in   possession  of   full  particulars"

 the   case he   is  expected   to   meet  and   should further give him"
"","ample opportunity to meet it, if possible (p. 171)"
