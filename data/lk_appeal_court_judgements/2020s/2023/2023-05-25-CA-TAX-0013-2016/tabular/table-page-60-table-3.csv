"[156] In these circumstances, I answer questions of law as follows:"
"1.  The TAC erred in law when it decided that the reasons for not accepting"
"the return of income were not communicated to the Respondent, and"
"that the  section under which the notice of assessment was issued was"
"not  mentioned  in  the  notice  of  assessment.  The  TAC  erred  in  law  in"
"deciding to annul the assessment without going into the substantive"
"matters of the assessment, upholding the preliminary objection."
"T
he TAC is, however, entitled to consider both factual matters as well"
"as legal matters in its determination."
