"CA PHC APN 63-2022"
"In  Nasher  v.  Director  of  Public  Prosecution  [2020]  VSCA  144  the"
"court held that:"
"“a  combination  of  delay,  onerous  custodial  conditions,  and  the"
"relative  weakness  of  the  prosecution  case  may,  when  considered"
"with 
all 
relevant 
circumstances, 
compel 
the 
conclusion 
that"
"exceptional circumstances have been established”. [Emphasis added]"
"Upon  perusal  of  the  Government  Analyst  Report,  the  production  had"
"been  received  by  them  on  22.04.2021  and  the  analyst  report  was"
"received by the Magistrate Court, Galle on 04.10. 2021.Although nearly"
"19  months  passed  after  receiving 
the  Government  Analyst  Report,"
"which 
is  one  of  the  deciding 
factors 
in  a  case  of  this  nature,  the"
"prosecution is unable to forward indictment to the High Court to date."
"This is a very serious laps on the part of the prosecution."
"The 
right 
to 
trial  without  undue  delay 
is 
found 
in  numerous"
"international and regional human rights  instruments; for example, the"
"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14(3)(c), the"
"American  Convention  on  Human  Rights 
(Article  8(1), 
the  African"
"Charter  on  Human  and  People’s  Rights 
(Article  7(1)(d),  and 
the"
"European  Convention 
for 
the 
Protection 
of  Human  Rights 
and"
"Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1)."
"When  a  person 
is  kept 
in 
remand  without 
filing  charges 
for  a"
"considerable  period  of  time,  he  or  she  should  be  released  on  bail"
"pending indictment. Otherwise, this will lead to prison overcrowding."
"Hence, I consider the delay more than two years in remand falls into the"
"category 
of 
excessive 
and 
oppressive 
delay 
considering 
the"
"circumstances  of 
this  case.  Considering  other  matters  which  had"
"escaped  the  attention  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Galle,  the"
"suspect  has  very  good  exceptional  circumstances 
to  consider 
this"
