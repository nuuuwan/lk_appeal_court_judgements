"person  without  an  order  from  the  Magistrate  is  contained  in  section  32(1)  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, thereby section 32(1)(b) and section 32(1)(d), state as"
"follows;"
"32.  (1)  Any  peace  officer  may  without  an  order  from  a  Magistrate  and  without  a"
"warrant, arrest any person –"
"(a) ….."
"(b)  who  has  been  concerned 
in  any  cognizable  offence  or  against  whom  a"
"reasonable  complaint  has  been  made  or  credible 
information  has  been"
"received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned;"
"(c)  …."
"(d) who has been proclaimed as an offender;"
"The use of the word ""may"" in the statutory provision ex facie indicates that it is a discretionary"
"power  vested  with  the  peace  officer  to  arrest  a  person  without  an  order  of  a  Magistrate.  A"
"discretionary power that he ought to exercise with caution balancing the interests of all parties"
"in  a  manner  that  does  not 
infringe  a  person's  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  under  the"
"Constitution. The petitioner is raising the issue solely based on the allegation that having all the"
"resources available and with the necessary orders from his superior officers in charge, the 4th"
"respondent  has 
intentionally  and  wilfully  failed 
in  preventing  the  attacks  on  the  peaceful"
"protesters who were at the “MainaGoGama” and “GotaGoGama” on 09.05.2002."
"The Criminal Investigations Department is still carrying out the necessary investigations into the"
"matter  concerned  under  magisterial  supervision 
in  case  number,  MC  Fort  B22046/  2022."
"Therefore,  the  arrest  of  a  person  in  relation  to  an  already  ongoing  investigation  is  something"
"the  officers  of  the  Criminal  Investigations  Department  has  to  do  having  due  regard  to  due"
"process  of  the  law.  It  is  the  discretionary  power  given  to  them  by  statute.  The  law  does  not"
"require the officers of the Criminal Investigations Department to act in a particular manner, but"
"only  requires  them  to  act  on  the  statutory  power  and  arrest  a  person  when,  they  form  an"
"opinion concerning any cognizable offence or a reasonable complaint has been made in respect"
"of  such  person  or  credible 
information  has  been  received 
in  respect  of  such  person  or  a"
"reasonable suspicion exists in respect of him."
"The petitioner submits the following latest authority in support of his argument;"
"Premachandra vs. Major Montegue Jaywaickrema 1994 (2) SLR 90. It was held that ""There are"
"no  absolute  or  unfettered  discretions 
in  public 
law;  discretions  are  conferred  on  public"
"functionaries  in  trust  for  the  public,  to  be  used  for  the  public  good,  and  the  propriety  of  the"
"exercise of such discretions is to be judged by reference to the purposes for which they were so"
"entrusted."""
"Besides,  the  aforesaid  obsolete  principle  mentioned  on  the  written  submissions  of  the  4th"
"respondent has now been over ruled and thus the following has been written in the same book"
"by the same author (Dr. Sunil Cooray) at page no. 988;"
"""But in modern law no discretion is absolute. Every discretion conferred by law is a public trust,"
"to  be  exercised  for  the  purposes  for  which  it  has  been  conferred-by  statute,  and  the  proved"
