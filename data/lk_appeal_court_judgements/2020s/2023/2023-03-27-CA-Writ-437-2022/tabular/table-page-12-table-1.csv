"and not to others"""
"As  the  House  of  Lords  ruled  in  Pasmore  vs.  Oswaldwistle  ULD.C.  (1898)  4.C.  387  (per  Lord"
"Halsbury);"
"“The principle that where a specific remedy is given by a statute, it thereby deprives the"
"person who insists upon a remedy of any other form of remedy than that given by the"
"statute, is one which is very familiar, and which runs through the law”"
"Lord Watson in Barraclough v Brown (1897) 4. C. 615 stated;"
"“The right and the remedy are given uno flatu and the one cannot be dissociated from"
"the  other...  It  cannot  be  the  duty  of  any  Court  to  pronounce  an  order  when  it  plainly"
"appears that, in so doing, the Court would be using a jurisdiction which the legislature"
"has forbidden it to exercise.”"
