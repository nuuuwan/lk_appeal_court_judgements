"Commerce and Others (SC Appeal No. 177/15 decided on 31.08.2018j as follows;"
"This is also the position maintained by Dr. Cooray in Principles of Administrative Law;"
"""every discretion conferred by law is a public trust, to be exercised for the purposes for"
"which it has been conferred by statute, and the proved factual situation in a given case"
"may  be  such  that,  in  keeping  with  the  purpose  for  which  such  discretion  has  been"
"conferred  by  the  statute,  the 
law  discerns  a  duty  to  exercise  that  discretion 
in  a"
"particular manner and that duty will be enforceable by mandamus."" (Volume II, 3rd edn,"
"page 847)."
