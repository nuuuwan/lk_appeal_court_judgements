"The learned Additional Solicitor General contended that the petitioner"
"is  not  entitled  to  the  allowance  for  the  period  from  28.03.2012  to"
"01.03.2014  because  at  that  time,  the  petitioner  was  not  the  Head  of"
"Mission, but as stated in the order of the AAT, the petitioner was serving"
"as Deputy Head of Mission in Iran. Even according to paragraph 5(h) of"
"the petition, the petitioner was placed as the Deputy Head of Mission at"
"the Embassy in Iran. He was appointed as the Ambassador of Sri Lanka"
"to Iran in 2015.07.15."
