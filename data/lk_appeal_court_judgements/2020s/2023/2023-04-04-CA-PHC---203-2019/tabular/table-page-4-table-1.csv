"be  taken  as  an  appeal  in  the  true  sense,  but  in  fact  as  an  application  to  examine  the"
"correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the High Court Judge in the"
"exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not under the guise of an"
"appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the evidence led in the main case‚Äù."
"It is to be observed that the main reason for the learned High Court Judge to have dismissed the"
"revisionary  application  of  the  Appellant  was  because  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  establish"
"exceptional grounds needed to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court."
"It  is  trite  law  that  revisionary  powers  can  be  considered  and  exercised  only  when  there  are"
"exceptional circumstances pleaded by the Petitioner."
"In this instance, Court draws the attention to the revision application dated 29.03.2019 made"
"by the Appellant to the Provincial High Court of Kandy. In the present Appeal, the Appellant has"
"averred  exceptional  circumstances  in  paragraph  12  of  the  Petition  to  invoke  the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction of the High Court."
"Therefore,  this  court  will  consider  whether  the  exceptional  grounds  substantiated  by  the"
"Appellant are sufficient for the Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court."
"In this respect, it is submitted that this court should look into whether the learned High Court"
"Judge has properly exercised his duty to ascertain whether any injustice or prejudice is caused"
"to a Party or whether there is a miscarriage of justice by the order of the learned Magistrate. The"
"Court  of  Appeal  is  not  empowered  to  correct  the  errors  made  by  the  learned  Magistrate"
