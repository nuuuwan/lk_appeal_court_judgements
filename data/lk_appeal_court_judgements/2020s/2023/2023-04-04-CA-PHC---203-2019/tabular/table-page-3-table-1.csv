"Prasantha De Silva, J"
"Judgment"
"The officer in charge of the police station – Gampaha had filed an information in terms of Section"
"66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 [hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’] on"
"the  complaint  made  by  the  1st  Party,  alleging  that  the  2nd  Party  had  obstructed  the  access  to"
"roadway in the 1st Party’s residential premises by erecting a fence."
"The  learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired  into  the"
"matter delivered his order dated 21.02.2019 in favor of the 1st Party.  The learned Magistrate"
"held that the 1st Party is entitled to use the disputed roadway and ordered the 2nd Party to remove"
"the  fence  which  has  been  erected  on  the  roadway,  obstructing  the  access  to  the  1st  Party’s"
"residential premises."
"Being aggrieved by the said order the 2nd Party-Petitioner invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of"
"the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden at Kandy in case bearing no. Rev 43/19"
"–  by  way  of  Petition  dated  29.03.2019.  The  1st  Party-Respondent  had  filed  Statement  of"
"Objections to the said application and thereafter, the Parties were heard by the Learned High"
"Court Judge."
"After the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the said revision"
"application of the 2nd Party-Petitioner by his order dated 08.11.2019."
"Being dissatisfied by the said order of the learned High Court Judge, the 2nd Party-Petitioner-"
"Appellant [hereinafter referred to as ‘the Appellant’]  had preferred this appeal, seeking to set"
"aside  the  said  order  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  and  the  order  made  by  the  learned"
"Magistrate held against the Appellant."
"It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  learned  Magistrate  had  correctly  determined  that  the  dispute"
"between  the  Parties  relating  to  land  comes  within  the  purview  of  Section  69  of  the  Primary"
"Courts’ Procedure Act."
"Since this appeal emanates from an order of the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High"
"Court of Kandy exercising revisionary jurisdiction against the order of the learned Magistrate, it"
"is not the task before this Court to consider an appeal against an order made under Section 66"
"of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"In Nandawathi and another Vs. Mahindasena [(2009) 2 SLR 218] it was held that"
