"of Civil Appeals (“P33a” on page 618 of the Brief). All parties were informed to be present"
"at the land on the 4th of December 2018."
"The  Petitioners  claim  that  to  their  surprise  the  2nd  and  4th  Respondents  moved"
"Court to make a special application (“P34” – 17th January 2019). It was brought to the"
"notice of the Court that when the officer of the Valuation Department visited the land to"
"execute the commission it was discovered that the allotment of land, viz. Lot 38 in the"
"Final Village Plan No. 636, alienated under the permit issued to the permit holder is a"
"roadway, and the Respondents are in possession of Lot 37B in the Final Village Plan No."
"636. The Respondents prayed for a declaration that the buildings constructed by them do"
"not fall within the scheduled property and to declare that the judgment was based on an"
"error. A letter dated 28th January 2019 issued by one S.M. Abeywickrama, District Valuer,"
"Valuation  Department  (Southern  Provincial  Office  -II)  to  the  Registrar  of  the  District"
"Court of Tissamaharama notes that Lot 38 is a road (“P36”)."
"The  Petitioners’  contention  is  that  despite  this  error,  which  must  surely  be  a"
"clerical error, the Schedule in the Plaint has definitive boundaries with an identifiable"
"extent,  and  the  learned  District Judge  has  not  referred  to  the  Lot  number  but  instead"
"referred to the scheduled property itself. It is also averred that at the trial the land was"
"admitted.  The  Petitioners  had  written  to  the  7th  Respondent,  copying  the  5th  and  6th"
"Respondents  to  inquire  into  this  matter  and  rectify  the  error.  The  7th  Respondent  had"
"referred the matter to the 5th Respondent for an examination to be conducted and a report"
"to be submitted thereon (“P42” dated 7th May 2019). The 5th Respondent in response to"
"that letter noted that the 9th Respondent (the District Valuer, Valuation Department) had"
"informed him that Lot 38 is a road, and therefore no valuation could be provided (“P45”"
"dated 6th December 2019)."
"Therefore,  the  Petitioners  are  at  present  before  this  Court  seeking  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus  to  compel  the  6th  Respondent  to  rectify  this  error  on  the  permit;  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus to compel the 6th Respondent through the 10th Respondent to demarcate the"
"boundaries of the land by reference to the metes and bounds of the scheduled property; a"
"Writ of Mandamus compelling the 5th, 6th, 7th Respondents, or any one of them, to name"
"the  1st  Petitioner  as  successor  to  the  land  of  the  original  permit  holder;  a  Writ  of"
"Prohibition to prevent the 1st to 4th Respondents from taking steps to apply for a permit"
"for Lot 37B."
