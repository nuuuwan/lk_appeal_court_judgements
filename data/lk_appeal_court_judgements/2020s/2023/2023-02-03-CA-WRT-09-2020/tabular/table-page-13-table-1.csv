"expect ordinary lay persons to whom land has been alienated to undertake surveys, as"
"that is an onus falling on the issuing authorities. It is for this reason that the statement"
"found in paragraph 22 of the Statement of Objections of the 5th to 10th Respondents which"
"seems to cast such a burden on the litigant and unfairly  find fault with such litigant is"
"unacceptable.  The  suggestion  that  it  is  the  Petitioners’  fault  for  waiting  seventy-plus"
"years  since  the  issuance  of  the  permit  to  lodge  this  application  is  abhorrent.  The"
"statement verbatim reads:"
"“….. and that the application of the Petitioner before Your Lordships’ Court has been filed after 70"
"after issue of permit and 34 years of the Petitioner seeking succession thereto and after several"
"rounds of litigation purportedly to settle private interests thereon, to ascertain the correctness of"
"the corpus/state land as identified in the permit which has been issued, is both frivolous and futile,"
"and  the  Petitioner  is  moreover  guilty  of  lashes  without  any  conceivable  justification  for  the"
"unexplained and inordinate delay in seeking a remedy in writ.”"
"This statement is in complete ignorance of the fact that the description of the land"
"found  in  the  respective  Schedule  was,  as  quoted  above,  drafted  by  the  State  Officials"
"themselves;  the  Schedule  as  found  in  the  action  instituted  in  terms  of  the  State  Land"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, unauthorised occupants."
"The Petitioners in filing their Plaint have relied on the Schedules prepared by the relevant"
"State Officials."
"It  must  also  be  noted  that  the  Land  Development  Ordinance  as  originally"
"conceived did not contain a provision for a survey of the land to be undertaken prior to its"
"alienation under a permit. It was only by an amendment in the year 1981 (by Amendment"
"Act No. 27 of 1981) that the Legislature insisted on a survey to be carried out prior to"
"lands being alienated on permits. This Section (Section 19(3)) provides that additionally,"
"the Government Agent shall cause the land alienated on such a permit to be surveyed by"
"the Surveyor-General, and the extent and description (by reference to metes and bounds)"
"of the land so surveyed shall be inserted in such permit."
"It is therefore conceivable that such a provision would have been included because"
"there would have been many issues, similar to the error found in the present application,"
"relating to the lands originally alienated, i.e., lands alienated at a time when such surveys"
"were  not  insisted.  Therefore,  it  is  inconceivable  to  now  place  the  entire  blame  on  the"
"permit  holder,  a beneficiary  under this  Ordinance  in 1949,  entitled  to  this land  on  the"
"ground that he belonged to an economically disadvantaged group."
