"It appears that the Legislature, in its wisdom, recognizing human fallibility, has"
"made provisions for the correction or rectification of flawed instruments issued under the"
"Ordinance. In terms of Section 20 of the State Lands Ordinance:"
"Where  it  appears  to  a  prescribed  officer  that  any  instrument  of  disposition  (whether"
"executed before or after the commencement of this Ordinance) contains any clerical or other error"
"or requires amendment in respect of the description of the land comprised therein or in respect of"
"the inscription or recital of the name or designation of the grantee or of any other material fact,"
"such  error  may  be  rectified  or  such  amendment  may  be  made  by  an  indorsement  on  such"
"instrument of disposition signed by such prescribed officer and the grantee; and any indorsement"
"so signed shall be sufficient for all purposes to rectify the error or to effect the amendment; and the"
"instrument  on  which  any  such  indorsement  is  made  shall  have  effect  as  though  it  had  been"
"originally issued or executed as so rectified or amended. [emphasis added]"
"A request has been made by the Petitioners to the Land Commissioner (“P41”) to"
"do so. The Statement of Objections does not address this."
"It  must  be  noted  that  the  permit  has  not  yet  been  cancelled.  Therefore,  the"
"Respondent  authorities  can  act  in  terms  of  Section  19(3)  of  the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance,  in  causing  a  survey  of  the  respective  lands  to  be  undertaken,  along  with"
"Section 20 of the State Lands Ordinance to rectify their mistake."
"Therefore, on a review of the entire history of this case, it appears that the present"
"trouble arises from the ‘original sin’ which is the absence of a description of the allotment"
"of land, with reference to its boundaries, alienated under the permit. Second, when Courts"
"have ordered the eviction of unlawful, unauthorised occupiers of land, that has not been"
"carried out. Third, the Land Commissioner’s abdication of responsibility by passing the"
"buck to the courts, when that matter could have been resolved administratively. Fourth,"
"the failure of the relevant Respondent authorities to take steps to rectify the error in the"
"permit issued by them."
"The argument that the permit holder was not issued an allotment of land, but a"
"road, is illogical. This is because permits are issued, and it can be judicially presumed in"
"this case to have been issued, at a Land Kachcheri in which the selection is made as to"
"which person is entitled to the allotment. To be eligible to participate at such Kachcheri"
"the candidates should have occupied or claim to occupy the land. It would be illogical for"
"them to occupy or claim occupation of a road. Further, it is the Respondent authorities"
"who prepared the Schedules to eject the Respondents under the State Lands (Recovery of"
"Possession) Act, and also sought to cancel the permit on the ground that the permit holder"
