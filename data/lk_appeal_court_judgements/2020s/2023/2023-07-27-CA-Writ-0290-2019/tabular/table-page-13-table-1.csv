"of Section 40 of the Act, once an Order under Section 38 is published in the"
"Gazette, by virtue of that Order, the land is vested in the State with effect from"
"the date on which the Order is published. Section 40 A provides that an Order"
"under Section 38 published in the Gazette is conclusive evidence of the title"
"of the State to the land."
"The Proviso of Section 38 read along with Section 38 A of the Act provides"
"that at any time after a notice under Section 2 and/or 4 is exhibited, on the"
"ground of urgency, the Minister may by Order published in the Gazette direct"
"the acquiring officer to take immediate possession of the land on behalf the"
"state."
"According to Section 41 (b) of the Act, if a declaration under Section 5 has"
"not been published in terms of Section 5 (1) of the Act, prior to the making of"
"the  Order  under  the  Proviso  to  Section  38  for  the  taking  of  immediate"
"possession  of  any  land,  such  a  declaration  should  be  made  and  published."
"However, as I have  already stated above in this  judgment, no material  was"
"produced by the Respondents that the declaration under Section 5 (1) has been"
"published as provided in the Section."
"Be that as it may, upon careful consideration of Sections 38 and 40 of the Act,"
"it is clear that it is the Gazette notification published under Section 38 A, read"
"along with Proviso of Section 38 that vest the land absolutely in the State."
"Conclusion"
"As I have already analysed above in this judgment, the Gazette notification"
"under Section 38 A is published in respect of the land depicted in advanced"
"tracing No. Maha/UDP/98/892. Consequently, the land vested in the State is"
"the  land  depicted  in  the  above  plan.  However,  in  tracing  No.  Maha/  UDP-"
"BS/2010/299  (‘P  10’)  the  Government  Surveyor  has  identified  Lot.  B  as  a"
"portion acquired by the State, based on plan No. 5059 made on the 21st March"
"2000. As  stated  above,  the  aforementioned  plan  No.  5059  had  been  made"
"subsequent to the publication of the Order in the Gazette under Section 38 A"
"on the 7th January 1999 (‘P 42’). Therefore, in my view, the issue of whether"
"lot B in tracing No. Maha/ UDP-BS/2010/299 (‘P 10’) is acquired by the State"
"cannot be precisely be determined without superimposing advanced tracing"
"No.  Maha/UDP/98/892.  Furthermore,  whether  Lot.  B 
in  plan 
‘P  10’"
"constitutes  part  of 
the  Petitioner’s 
land  could  be  ascertained  only  by"
