"The learned High Court Judge has concluded that learned Magistrate has analyzed and evaluated"
"the evidence placed before the Magistrate’s Court and had come to the correct finding of fact and"
"law in dealing with section 68(1) and 68(3) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. The 1st and 2nd"
"Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioners have invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court against the"
"said Order of the learned High Court Judge."
"Although  Section  74(2)  of  the  Primary  Courts’ Procedure  Act  does  not provide  a  right  of  appeal"
"against  the  Order  of  the  learned  Magistrate/Primary  Court  Judge,  by  operation  of  law,  right  of"
"appeal  is  conferred  against  an  Order  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  exercising  revisionary"
"jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court. However, it is seen that 1st and 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-"
"Petitioners [hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners] have not preferred an appeal against the Order"
"of the learned High Court Judge but filed a revision application on 27.01.2021 instead."
"It is trite law that revision is an extraordinary jurisdiction vested in Appellate Courts, which can be"
"exercised  under  exceptional  circumstances,  if  no  other  remedy  is  available.  Since  revision  is  a"
"discretionary remedy, it will not be available unless the application discloses circumstances which"
"shock the conscience of Court."
"It has been held in the case Rustom Vs Hapangama [ 1978-1979 2 SLR 225]  that court can intervene"
"by way of a revision even where right of appeal is available but the revisionary jurisdiction can only"
"be  invoked  under  exceptional  circumstances.  The  powers  by  way  of  revision  conferred  on  the"
"Appellate Court are very wide and can be exercised regardless of whether an appeal has been taken"
"against an Order of the original Court or not. However, such powers should be exercised only in"
"exceptional circumstances and as to what such exceptional circumstances are is dependent on the"
"facts of each case."
"It is to be noted that the Petitioners have pleaded exceptional circumstances in paragraph 13 of the"
"Petition;"
