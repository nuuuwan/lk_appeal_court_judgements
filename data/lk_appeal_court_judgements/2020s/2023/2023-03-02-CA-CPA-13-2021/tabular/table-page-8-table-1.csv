"miscarriage of justice has been caused to a party. The Court of Appeal is not empowered to correct"
"errors  made  by  the  learned  Magistrate.  However,  Court  of  Appeal  has  to  determine  whether  the"
"learned High Court Judge has properly exercised his duty when ascertaining whether any injustice"
"was caused to a party or whether any miscarriage of justice has occurred by the Order of the learned"
"Magistrate. By invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of Court, the aggrieved party can challenge the"
"legality of an Order but not the correctness of an Order."
"In view of the aforesaid judicial pronouncements, it clearly manifests that existence of exceptional"
"circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of revisionary powers. In the instant case, since 1st"
"and 2nd Petitioners have not properly pleaded or established exceptional circumstances for Court to"
"act in revision, we are unable to exercise revisionary jurisdiction of Court to have the impugned"
"order of the learned High Court Judge dated 25.01.2021 revised or set aside."
"Hence,  the  application  for  revision  made  by  1st  and  2nd  Respondents-Petitioners-Petitioners  is"
"dismissed with costs."
