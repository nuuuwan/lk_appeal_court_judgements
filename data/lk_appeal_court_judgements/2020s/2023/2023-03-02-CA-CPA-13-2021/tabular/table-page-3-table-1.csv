"After having concluded the inquiry of the alleged dispute, the learned Magistrate who was acting as"
"the  Primary  Court  Judge  had  delivered  the  order  on  09.07.2018  and  held  in  favour  of  the  said"
"Petitioners by directing 1st and 2nd Respondents to hand over the vacant possession of the disputed"
"premises to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Petitioners."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order,  1st  and  2nd  Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioners  invoked  the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo."
"Having heard the oral submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, the learned High Court"
"Judge had made his Order dated 25.01.2021 and refused to interfere with the impugned Order of"
"the learned Magistrate."
"Being  dissatisfied  with  the  said  order  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  1st  and  2nd  Respondent-"
"Petitioner-Petitioners  had  preferred  a  revision  application  to  this  Court  seeking  to  have  the  said"
"orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge revised or set aside."
"The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents had filed an information on 25.05.2017 in"
"the Magistrate’s Court of Colombo in terms of section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act"
"No. 44 of 1979. It was amended later and an amended affidavit dated 12.06.2017 had been filed."
"The preliminary objection that there is no provision in the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act enabling"
"a party to a dispute to file an amended Petition/affidavit under Section 66(1)(b) of the said Act had"
"been raised on behalf of 1st and 2nd Respondents-Petitioners. With regard to the said preliminary"
"objection, it is worthy to note that there is no prohibition to amending a petition by parties expressly"
"provided in Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"It  was  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioners  that  Magistrate’s"
"Court and High Court had made a fundamental error in failing to reject the said amended affidavit,"
"that Magistrate’s Court and High Court had considered the application of the 1st 2nd 3rd Petitioner-"
"Respondent-Respondents on the basis of the said affidavit and that it should be rejected in limine as"
"the Orders made by the Magistrate’s Court and High Court are vitiated by this fact alone."
"It should be noted that, 1st and 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioners had argued that the learned"
"Magistrate  has  failed  to  address  this  preliminary  objection.  Further,  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondent-"
"Petitioner-Petitioners had maintained this preliminary objection in their revision application to the"
"High Court dated 16.07.2018. The learned High Court Judge too had not addressed his mind to the"
"said preliminary objection."
"However, in the case of Hewawitharana Vs. Themis De Silva [63 NLR 68 at 72] it was quoted with"
"approval dictum of Mahamood J. in Narsingh Das Vs. Mangal Dubey [1983] 5 Allahabad 163 at"
