"Saharan in collaboration with an organization called ISIS attempting to organize"
"groups within Sri Lanka in order to commit a crime."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  whether  the  organization  called  ISIS  was  a"
"proscribed organization within Sri Lanka or not is immaterial for the purpose of"
"filing an indictment against the petitioner in terms of section 05 of the PTA. It is"
"a matter for the prosecution to prove that fact, if it becomes a relevant fact to"
"prove the charge against the petitioner only at the trial stage of the action."
"It is also clear from the indictment; the intention of the Hon. Attorney General"
"has been to charge him for the offence mentioned on the basis of the penalty for"
"failure to give information as provided for in section 5 of the PTA where a specific"
"penalty has been provided."
"In terms of section 5 (1) (a) of the PTA,"
