"In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekara (1997) 2 SLR 365, it"
"was held that;"
"“Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has"
"been  occurred  due  to  a  fundamental  rule  of  procedure  being  violated,  but"
"only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of"
"justice.”"
"As considered above, I am of the view that no positive miscarriage of justice has"
"been  occasioned  to  the  petitioner  due  to  the  order  of  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge to overrule the preliminary objection raised on behalf of him."
"The application for revision is, therefore, dismissed."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward a copy of this judgement to the"
"High Court of Gampaha for necessary information."
"Judge of the Court of Appeal"
"P. Kumararatnam, J."
"I agree."
