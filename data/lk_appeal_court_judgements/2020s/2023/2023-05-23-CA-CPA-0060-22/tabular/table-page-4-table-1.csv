"It is on the basis of being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has come"
"before this Court."
"At the hearing of this matter, the main argument of the learned Counsel for the"
"petitioner was that the charge against the petitioner is on the basis that he failed"
"to  provide  information  to  the  authorities  that  the  person  mentioned  in  the"
"indictment  was  in  the  process  of  organizing  groups  in  collaboration  with  the"
"organization called ISIS, but during the relevant time period mentioned in the"
"indictment, the said organization named ISIS was not a prohibited organization"
"in Sri Lanka."
"He drew the attention of the Court to the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2223/3 of"
"the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka dated 13-04-2021, where it has"
"been declared that any person who conspires to commit or attempts, abets or"
"engages in any conduct in preparation to commit an offence in contravention of"
"Regulation 3 of that Regulations, commits an offence, and shall on conviction by"
"the  High  Court  of  the  Western  Province  established  under  Article  154P  of  the"
"Constitution  holden  in  Colombo,  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of  imprisonment  not"
"exceeding 10 years. The Gazette has provided the list of proscribed organizations"
"for which the regulations become applicable."
"The term ISIS is the reference to the organization called the Islamic State of Iraq"
"and  Syria  alias  Al-Dawlah  al-Islamia  Dawlah  Islamia,  which  is  one  of  the"
"organizations proscribed."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  Counsel  that  the  mentioned  ISIS  was  not  a"
"prohibited  organization  during  the  time  relevant  to  the  charge  against  the"
"petitioner. The charge preferred against him was a charge unknown to the law,"
"hence, there was no basis for the Hon. Attorney General to prefer an indictment"
"against the petitioner."
"It  was  his  contention  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Gampaha  was"
"misdirected  as  to  the  relevant  legal  principles  when  the  preliminary  objection"
"was overruled."
