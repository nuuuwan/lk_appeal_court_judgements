"The Learned High Court Judge had rejected the evidence of the  Accused on the"
"basis that both the 2nd   deceased and the two children were found inside the house with"
"burned injuries."
"In the instant case, it is imperative to note that the prosecution has heavily relied"
"on  the  dying  declaration  made  to  the  Police  officer  (PW11)  by  the  1st  deceased  and"
"deceased  wife  (Tekla  Kumari)  to   PW1  and  PW2  concerning  the  cause  of  death.  These"
"statements were  deemed  admissible  and  relevant  under  Section  32 (1)  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance.  Before  we  analyze the  evidence presented  to  us, we must consider  how  the"
"Courts have historically interpreted and accepted the concept of a dying declaration."
"We are mindful of the judgments relied by Justice Sisira De Abrew on considering"
"the admissibility of the dying declaration as an item of evidence against the Accused in"
"the case of Ranasinghe v Attorney-General [2007], 1 S.L.R 218, His  Lordship Sisira De"
"Abrew held that:"
"“Are  these  the  words  used  by  the  deceased?  Are  these  the  words  used  by  the"
"witness or is this a mixture of words used by both the witness and the deceased? Learned"
"trial Judge should have been mindful of these questions."
"When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence against an Accused"
"person in a criminal trial the trial Judge or the jury as the case may be must bear in mind"
"the following weaknesses. (a) The statement of the deceased person was not made under"
"oath. (b) The statement of the deceased person has not been tested by cross-examination;"
"vide King v Asirivadam Nadat and Justinpala v Queen.  That the person who made the"
"dying declaration is not a witness at the trial.”"
"F
urther held that:"
"“As  there  are  inherent  weaknesses  in  a  dying  declaration  which  I  have  stated"
"above, the trial Judge or the jury as the case may be must be satisfied beyond reasonable"
"doubt on the following matters. (a) Whether the deceased, in fact, made such a statement."
"(b) Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and accurate. (c) Whether the"
"statement made by the deceased person could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. (d)"
"Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying declaration could be"
"accepted beyond reasonable doubt. (e) Whether witness is telling the truth. (f) Whether"
"the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged declaration was made.”"
