"Justice H.N.J. Perera,  (as he was then ) in Ananda v. Attorney General, 2015 (1)"
"SLR 158, held that:"
"“It  is  well  settled  that  dying  declarations  can  form  the  sole  basis  of  conviction"
"provided that it is free from infirmities and satisfies various tests."
"In Khushal Rao V. State of Bombay  It was held that it is well settled that though a dying"
"declaration  must  be  approached  with  caution  for  the  reason  that  the  maker  of  the"
"statement cannot be subjected to cross-examination, there is neither a rule of law that a"
"dying declaration cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated."
"It  is  also  settled  in  all  these  cases  that  the  statement  should  be  consistent"
"throughout if the deceased had several opportunities of making such dying declarations,"
"that is to say, that if there are more than one dying declaration, they should be consistent."
"If a dying declaration is found to be voluntary, reliable, and made in fit mental condition,"
"it can be relied upon without any corroboration.”"
