"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  considered  the  entire  evidence  and  came  to  the"
"finding that there is no sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the 2nd and 3rd Accused"
"for  the  murder,  and  he  has  correctly  concluded  that  the  prosecution  has  established"
"beyond reasonable doubt that 1st accused is guilty of the murder of all of the deceased."
"In this context, and for the reasons more fully described above, we are of the view"
"that there is no necessity to interfere with the conviction of the Accused. We, therefore,"
"affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed upon the Accused."
"We dismiss this appeal."
