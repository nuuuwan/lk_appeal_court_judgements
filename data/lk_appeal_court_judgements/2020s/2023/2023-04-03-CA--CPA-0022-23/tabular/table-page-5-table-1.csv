"It is the view of this Court that although this Court finds nothing wrong in the"
"learned High Court Judgeâ€™s direction that the petitioner should be indicted for"

"subsection  (2)  is  the  trial  where  the  person  who  has  given  false  evidence  has"
"been  charged  and  not  the  trial  where  the  person  has  allegedly  given  false"
"evidence."
"Such a trial can take place only after the conclusion of the trial where such a"
"person has allegedly given false evidence and after an indictment is filed against"
"him in the High Court."

"charge or an indictment is preferred against such a person and not before."
"In terms of section 14 of the Act, the legislature in its wisdom has only described"
"the offence under which a person who has given false evidence can be charged"
"stating that the charge should be for intentionally giving false evidence in a stage"
