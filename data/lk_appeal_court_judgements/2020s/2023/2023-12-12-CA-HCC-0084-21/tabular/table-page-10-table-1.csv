"The explanation (ii) to section 363 of the Penal Code which describes the offence"
"of rape reads as follows;"
"(ii) Evidence of resistance such as physical injuries to the body is not"
"essential to prove that sexual intercourse took place without consent."
"Although the evidence of the prosecutrix had been that, she attempted to resist"
"the appellant, that does not mean that there should be essential injuries on her"
"as  the  evidence  has  to  be  considered  in  its  totality,  given  the  facts  and  the"
"circumstances."
"In the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney General (supra), it was held;"
"“The  law  as  it  stands  today  in  this  country  certainly  does  not  expect  the"
"innocent victims of a sexual crime to struggle with the assailant valiantly"
"that would not result in the victim sustaining injuries. Under the amended"
"Penal Code Act No. 22 of 1995 the legislature has categorically expressed"
"this view by way of explanation (ii) of section 363 of the Penal Code.”"
"For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the  grounds of appeal"
"urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant in relation to the probability and"
"the credibility of the evidence placed before the Court."
"One other matter contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that"
"the  appellant  was  not  afforded  a  fair  trial  because  of  the  questioning  by  the"
"learned trial Judge when the prosecutrix gave evidence before the Court."
"I  find  no  basis  under  any  circumstances  to  conclude  that  the  questions  put"
"forward by the Court when prosecutrix was giving evidence has caused prejudice"
"towards the appellant."
"A trial Judge has a right to pose questions to a witness in order to discover or to"
"obtain  proper  proof  of  relevant  facts  in  terms  of  section  165  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance."
