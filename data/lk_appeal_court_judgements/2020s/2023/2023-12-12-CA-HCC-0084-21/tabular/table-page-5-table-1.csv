"The female police officer who recorded the statement of the prosecutrix at the"
"police station has observed that the prosecutrix was in a disturbed state when"
"she made her statement."
"According to the evidence of the JMO, the history given by the prosecutrix was"
"very much consistent with the evidence of the prosecutrix as to what happened."
"Although the JMO has not observed any obvious signs of rape on her body and"
"any other injuries, he has expressed the opinion that the alleged incident cannot"
"be excluded as the prosecutrix had given birth to a child and has had regular"
"sexual contact with her husband."
"It is clear from the cross-examination of the witnesses that an attempt has been"
"made to tarnish the character of the prosecutrix on the basis that she and her"
"husband became intimate with each other as a result of a missed phone call and"
"she was pregnant before they got married."
"The prosecution witness number 03, the manager of the estate was dead at the"
"time  this  matter  was  taken  up  for  trial.  However,  the  prosecution  had  led  the"
"deposition he made before the Magistrateâ€™s Court at the non-summary inquiry"
"in terms of section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"It is clear from the deposition that when he entered the estate on the day of the"
"incident,  namely,  on  28-10-2013,  the  prosecutrix  has  come  to  him  and  had"
"informed that she was raped by the appellant. He has instructed her to go and"
"make a complaint to the police."
"As I have stated before, the line of the defence of the appellant has been consent."
"However, when called for a defence at the end of the prosecution case, he has"
"made  a  dock  statement  and  had  stated further  that  when  he  came  out  of  the"
"house of the prosecutrix, the manager  saw him and since  the manager had  a"
"dispute with him, he instigated the prosecutrix to go and make a complaint to"
"the police."
