"fact forgotten that fact, and had only remembered it when it was put to her in"
"cross-examination."
"She has answered the questions put to her as to why she did not inform the wife"
"of the appellant that the appellant was trying to come into her house by saying"
"that as soon as she received the call, the appellant entered the house, leaving"
"her no time to react to the phone call. She has well explained the reasons as to"
"how the appellant knew her phone number as her husband has given it to the"
"appellant for him to contact them in a case of need."
"There had been no injuries on the body of the prosecutrix although she claims"
"that the appellant pushed her onto the floor and raped her after removing her"
"clothes. It appears that this submission and been on the basis that it was not"
"probable  for  an  incident  of  this  nature  to  happen  without  any  injuries  to  the"
"prosecutrix, unless it was with consent."
"However, I am of the view that a victim not having injuries on her body is in itself"
"not a reason to doubt the evidence of a victim of rape. The prosecutrix has well"
"explained  the  way  the  incident  happened  and  the  line  of  questioning  had  not"
"created any doubt as to the occurrence of the incident. It has been suggested to"
"her that she did not shout at the time of the incident as it happened with consent."
"It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  that  as  soon  as  the  incident  occurred  and  the"
"appellant had left the scene, the prosecutrix has informed the incident to the 1st"
"person  she  met,  namely  PW-03.  Thereafter,  she  has  informed  her  husband"
"promptly, as soon as he arrived home. If the incident happened with the consent"
"of  the  prosecutrix,  there  was  no  reason  for  her  to  promptly  complain  to  the"
"manager  of  the  estate  and  to  her  husband.  PW-02,  the  husband  of  the"
"prosecutrix  has  given  clear  evidence  saying  that  there  was  no  basis  for  the"
"allegation that his wife had an affair with the appellant as they were living in the"
"estate only for 3 weeks. It is clear from the evidence that soon after the incident,"
"they have left the estate to live elsewhere, which shows that they wanted to get"
"away from the place of the incident."
