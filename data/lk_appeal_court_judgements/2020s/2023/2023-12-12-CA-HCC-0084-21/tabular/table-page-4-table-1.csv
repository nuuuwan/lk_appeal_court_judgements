"Although the prosecutrix has stated that this happened after about three months"
"after they arrived at the estate, it is clear from the evidence of the husband that"
"in fact this incident has happened 3 weeks after their arrival."
"On the day of the incident, the husband of the prosecutrix has left for work. After"
"her husband left, the appellant has forcibly entered the house, had got hold of"
"the prosecutrix and had raped her. He has left the house after threatening her"
"with death and informing her not to divulge this incident to anyone."
"However, soon after the incident, she has heard the manager of the estate coming"
"in  his  motorcycle  and  she  had  gone  and  informed  him  of  the  incident.  The"
"manager (PW-03) has instructed her to make a complaint to the police. After her"
"husband arrived home for lunch about 12 noon, she has informed him about the"
"incident  and  both  of  them  have  gone  to  the  police  station  and  has  made  a"
"complaint."
"She  has  been  admitted  to  the  hospital  and  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (JMO)"
"has examined the victim on the following day, namely, 29-10-2013."
"It is clear from the line of cross-examination on behalf of the appellant that he"
"has not denied he had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix. His position had"
"been  that  it  happened  with  the  consent.  The  prosecutrix  has  denied  that  she"
"gave  any  consent  to  the  appellant  or  she  had  any  affair  with  the  appellant  as"
"claimed  by  him.  During  the  cross-examination  it  has  been  revealed  that  the"
"appellant  has  given  a  call  to  the  prosecutrix  before  he  came  into  the  house."
"Although  the  prosecutrix  has  stated  that  she  or  her  husband  had  no  mobile"
"phones  with  them  at  the  time  of  the  incident,  it  is  clear  from  the  answers"
"provided by her that she has forgotten about that in her evidence in chief, but"
"has remembered the fact that she had a phone with her only upon  when that"
"fact was put to her by the defence."
"The husband of the prosecutrix (PW-02) has confirmed that, when he came home"
"for  lunch,  his  wife  was  crying  and  getting  dressed.  When  inquired  about  the"
"reasons, she has divulged that she was raped by the appellant."
