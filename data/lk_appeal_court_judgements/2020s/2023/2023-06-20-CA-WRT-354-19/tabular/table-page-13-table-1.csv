"In this way, the argument between Mr. Upul Alwis and Mr. Udaya"
"Kumara continued clamorously."
"Even  after  coming  to  the  room,  the  heated  argument  between"
"Mr. Upul Alwis and Mr. Udaya Kumara took place for about five minutes"
"in an impassioned tone. At that time, I observed how both of them tried"
"to hit each other. At this time, the few foreigners in the room and the few"
"local  passengers  went  out  immediately  as  if  in  panic.  At  this  time,  the"
"other  authorized  officers  who  were 
there,  senior  authorized  officer,"
"Mr. Keerthisena, and I tried to calm the situation by placing the two on"
"opposite  sides.  Here, 
I  stopped  this  quarrel  about 
three  times  and"
"strongly  told  Mr.  Udaya  Kumara  to  leave  immediately.  Mr.  Upul  Alwis"
"was also told strongly."
"Mr.  Alwis  may  have  displayed  aggressive  behavior  at 
that 
time."
"However, if the petitioner had not been quarrelsome and only Mr. Alwis"
"had  been  disruptive,  there  would  have  been  no  need  for  the  other"
"officers to ask the petitioner to leave that place. It should be noted that"
"this dispute arose as a result of the petitioner stepping down from his"
"counter  to  have  a  snack  and  a  cup  of  tea  without  permission.  As  a"
"senior officer, Mr. Alwis had the right to question the petitioner about"
"why he had left his counter before his scheduled break. However, before"
"Mr.  Alwis,  the  petitioner  asked  Mr.  Alwis  why  he  was  abusing  the"
"petitioner, which resulted in the discord between the petitioner and the"
"Senior Authorized Officer, Mr. Alwis. Such behavior in a place like an"
"airport create a bad image regarding the standard of discipline of the"
"officers in our country even to foreigners."
