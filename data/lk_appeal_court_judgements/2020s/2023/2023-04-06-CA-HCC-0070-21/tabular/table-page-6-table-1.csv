"The Grounds of Appeal"
"The learned Counsel for the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal for"
"the consideration of the Court."
"1.  The appellant was denied a fair trial."
"2.  The prosecution has failed to prove the identity of the appellant."
"3.  The prosecution failed to prove the dying declaration of the deceased."
"4.  The  charge  was  not  proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt  against  the"
"appellant."
"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"As the grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider all the"
"grounds together."
"The argument that the appellant was denied of a fair trial was on the basis that"
"the evidence establishes that witness number 01 has made two statements to"
"the police, but only one statement had been provided to the appellant at the trial."
"Referring to the provisions of section 147 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,"
"it was the position of the learned Counsel that the police have failed to provide"
"the first statement allegedly made by PW-01 to the police at any stage of the non-"
"summary  inquiry  or  along  with  the  indictment.  It  was  his  view  that  this  has"
"denied  a  fair  trial  for  the  appellant,  as he  had  no  opportunity  of  studying  the"
"alleged first statement made by PW-01 to the police."
"However,  I  find  no  basis  to  conclude  that  PW-01,  who  was  the  wife  of  the"
"appellant had made two written statements to the police. It is abundantly clear"
"that the two statements referred to by the witness in her evidence refer to the"
"oral statement she may have given to the police soon after the incident and the"
"statement recorded by the police after the death of her husband. It appears that"
"the police have not taken steps to record a formal statement from her initially,"
