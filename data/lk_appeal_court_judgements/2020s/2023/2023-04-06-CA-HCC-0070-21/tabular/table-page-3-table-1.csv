"Subsequently,  he  has  been  arrested  and  produced  before  the  High  Court  of"
"Kegalle on 8th October 2020, wherein the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle"
"has pronounced the death sentence on the appellant on the 30th March 2021."
"It  needs  to  be  noted  that  although  when  the  appellant  was  arrested  and"
"produced, he has given an opportunity to explain his absence from the Court in"
"terms  of  section  241  (3)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  it  has  been"
"informed to the Court that he is not making an application in terms of the said"
"section."
"The appellant has preferred an appeal challenging both the conviction and the"
"sentence on 13th April 2021, almost 10 years after the conviction but within14"
"days after the sentence."
"At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) raised"
"an objection as to the maintainability of this appeal on the basis that the appeal"
"has been preferred out of time."
"However, it is the view of this Court that since the sentence has been pronounced"
"only on the 30th March 2021, there exists no basis to conclude the appeal has"
"been filed out of time as contended by the learned DSG, although the appeal is"
"against both the conviction and the sentence."
