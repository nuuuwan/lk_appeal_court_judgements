"but had done so only after the death of the deceased, which was the statement"
"handed over to the appellant."
"It appears that the learned Counsel for the appellant in formulating a claim that"
"a  fair  trial  has  been  denied  to  his  client,  in  an  attempt  to  give  a  different"
"interpretation to the evidence of PW-01, for which I find no merit. I find that at"
"the trial, the position taken up on behalf of the appellant had been that witness"
"number 01 made only one statement to police and that was after the death of"
"her husband, and not that she made two statements as stated by her in evidence."
"The position taken up by the appellant had been that she had made a belated"
"statement to police,  and not that she made a statement immediately after the"
"incident."
"When  it  comes  to  the  argument  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the"
"identity  of  the  appellant  as  the  perpetrator  of  the  crime  is  concerned,  there"
"cannot be any doubt that the deceased has informed his wife and several other"
"fellow villagers soon after the incident that it was Korala who stabbed him."
"It  is  very  much  clear  that  the  person  known  as  Korala  in  the  village  was  the"
"appellant. Although PW-08 mentions about another person called Korala, he was"
"a  person  of  old  age  and  cannot  be  regarded  as  the  person  mentioned  by  the"
"deceased  as  the  person  responsible  for  his  injuries.  The  appellant  has  never"
"taken up the position at the trial Court that he is not the person referred to by"
"the  witnesses  as  Korala.  Being  a  fellow  villager  and  a  person  known  to  the"
"deceased as well as the other witnesses, there was no question as to whether the"
"deceased has failed to identify the person who stabbed him as the incident has"
"happened in broad daylight."
"Soon after the incident, PW-03 who was also a relative of the appellant has seen"
"him coming in a motorbike while holding a knife in his mouth. He has stopped"
"his bike and had talked to PW-03, where he had stated that “මම කදන්කනකුට වැඩක්"
"දුන්නා” which is very much consistent with the evidence of other witnesses."
