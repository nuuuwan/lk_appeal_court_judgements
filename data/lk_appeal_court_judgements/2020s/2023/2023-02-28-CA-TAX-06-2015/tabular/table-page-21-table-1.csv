"Mrs.  Vivionne  Gunawardena  vs.  Hector  Perera,  Officer  in  Charge,  Police"
"Station, Kollupitiya and others S.C. Application 20/1983 was an application"
"filed in respect of an alleged violation of a fundamental right, where Mrs. Vivionne"
"Gunawardena alleged, among other things, that she was unlawfully arrested by"
"the OIC of Kollupiya Police Station. The IGP, the 02nd respondent filed an affidavit"
"from one Vinayagam Ganeshananthem, Sub Inspector, to the effect that he and"
"not the 01st respondent who arrested Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena because she"
"had  no  “permit”  to  go  in  a  procession.  Although  Mrs.  Vivionne  Gunawardane"
"countered this position, the Supreme Court consisting of a three Judge bench"
"did  not  believe  her,  but  believed  the  affidavit  of  Vinayagam  Ganeshananthem"
"and  decided  that  the  petitioner’s  fundamental  rights  have  been  violated  as"
"Vinayagam Ganeshananthem is “guilty” of unlawfully arresting her."
"Vinayagam Ganeshananthem then petitioned to the Supreme Court requesting"
"to  set  aside  the  said  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  itself,  as  he  was  only  a"
"witness (on affidavit) and he was not informed before finding him “guilty” and"
"therefore the rule audi alteram partem is violated. This second case was decided"
"by a Seven Judge bench of the Supreme Court, including the incumbent learned"
"Chief Justice. The decision was divided 05 to 02 and the majority decided against"
"Vinayagam Ganeshananthem."
"The  appellant  cites  a  better  case,  Cooper  vs.  Wandsworth  Board  of  Works"
"(1863) 143 ER 414 at page 20, paragraph 10.14 of the said written submissions,"
"but as this Court recollects, the oft quoted example of the God and Adam was"
"not uttered in that case [as the said written submission claims] but, the ancient"
"case in which it was uttered in 1723 was mentioned in the unreported case of"
"Fountaine  v.  Chesterton,  by  Megarry  J.  In  John  vs.  Rees  and  others,  1969,"
"Chancery Division. Meggary J., referring to the above judgment said as follows,"
