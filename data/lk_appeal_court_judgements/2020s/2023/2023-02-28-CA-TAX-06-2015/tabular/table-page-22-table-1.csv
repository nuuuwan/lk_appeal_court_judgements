"to  a  case  concerning  an  avowed  expulsion  from  a  political  party  which"
"came before me some three weeks after the conclusion of the argument in"
"this case, namely, Fountaine v. Chesterton. It may be that there is other"
"authority on the point that I have in mind: but none was cited to me in"
"that case or in this. The decision was briefly reported in ""The Times"" on"
"August 20, 1968, and 112 S.J. 690: but I gather from the asterisk attached"
"to the latter report that no full report is likely to appear, at any rate in the"
"Weekly Law Reports. Accordingly, it may be convenient if I set out as best"
"I can from my notes the passage in that judgment which I have in mind‚Äù."
