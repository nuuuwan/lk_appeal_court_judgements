"U. de Z. Gunewardane J., in Fernando  vs. Ceylon Brewerys Ltd., [1998] (3)"
"SLR 61 observed,"
"“The question whether provision in a statute is mandatory or directory is"
"not capable of generalization but when the legislature has not said which"
"is which, one of the basic tests for deciding whether a statutory direction"
"is mandatory or directory is to consider whether violation thereof is penal"
"or  not.  It  has  been  the  traditional  view  that  where  disobedience  of  a"
"provision is expressly made penal it has to be concluded that the provision"
"is mandatory whereas if no penalty is prescribed non compliance with the"
"provisions of a statute may held to be directory”."
