"The  appellant  has  submitted,  at  page  36  paragraph  12  of  the  final  written"
"submissions,  that,  in  letters  of  the  Secretary  to  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"dated 18th January 2012, 23rd July 2012 and 14th March 2014 it is not set out"
"what is the shortfall, which the appellant has allegedly not provided."

"so  informing  because  25%  has  to  be  deposited  at  the  time  of  the  filing  of  the"
"appeal  and  not  thereafter.  However,  the  section  7(1)  proviso  (b)  or  any  other"
"provision does not spell out the consequences of a non furnishing of 25% deposit"

"Secretary or the Tax Appeals Commission from accepting any deficiency, if any,"
"before the hearing of the appeal."
