"“113.  The  tax  payer  appellant  states  that  there  is  a  violation  of  the"
"principles of natural justice since the CGIR was heard on this matter. But"
"what actually the letter dated 30.12.2014 which is challenged, reflects is"
"that  over  5  months  after  the  letter  rejecting  the  appeal  was  sent  to  the"
"appellant. The TAC has sought the views of the CGIR and THE CGIR HAS"
"CATEGORICALLY STATED THEREIN THAT IT IS NOT PROPER TO GIVE"
"THEIR  VIEWS  ON  RELISTING.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  there  is  no"
"violation of the principles of natural justice and in fact, the CGIR has acted"
"honourably and refused to comment”."
