"[55] It is not in dispute that the Appellant has not registered in terms of the"
"provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act and no action has been"
"taken  by 
the  Director-General  of 
the  Tertiary  Education  and  Vocational"
"Educational Commission against the Appellant for the failure to register the"
"Appellant’s 
institute  under  the  provisions  of  the  Tertiary  and  Vocational"
"Education Act."
"[56]  The  Appellant  has  been  granted  approval  by  the  BOI  to  conduct  and"
"operate  an  Information  Technology  Training  Institute  for  offering  degrees,"
"diplomas and certificates duly affiliated to APIIT, Malaysia under section 17 of"
"the BOI Act, and the Appellant has invested a minimum sum of Rs. 15 million"
"in respect of its business.  If these conditions are satisfied, the Appellant would"
"be entitled to income tax exemption for a period of time as determined by the"
"BOI."
"[57] It is relevant to note that the words “tertiary” and “education” are found"
"only  in  the  Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Act,  but  such    words    are  not"
"found  in  the  definition  of  “Educational  Establishment”  in  paragraph  (d)  of"
"section 83 of the VAT Act.  The only common word in both Acts is the word"
"“vocational”.  The  VAT  exemption  is  applicable  if  the  Appellant  has  provided"
"“vocational  or  practical  training”  in  the  fields  referred  to  in  the  definition  of"
"“Educational  Establishment”  in  paragraph  (d)  of  section  83  of  the  VAT  Act."
"There 
is  no  requirement  to  prove  that  the  Appellant  provides  both  the"
"“vocational and practical training” to qualify for the VAT exemption under the"
"VAT Act. Accordingly, in the present case, the requirement of “vocational  or"
"practical training” in the field of information technology  is the basis of the VAT"
"exemption.  On  the  other  hand,  the    requirement  of  “tertiary  or  vocational"
"education” is the basis of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act."
"[58]  There  is  nothing  to  indicate  in  the  VAT  Act  that  the  VAT  exemption  is"
"inapplicable  to  any  BOI  approved  undertaking  unless  such  undertaking  has"
"registered under the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act"
"or  provided  “tertiary  or  vocational  education”  within  the  meaning  of  the"
"Tertiary and Vocational Education Act."
"[59] If it was the intention of the legislature that the VAT exemption is subject"
"to the registration of the educational institution under the provisions of the"
"Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Act,    it  could  have  easily  referred  to  the"
"Tertiary and Vocational Education Act.  It is not in dispute that the VAT Act or"
"its subsequent amendments make no reference to the Tertiary and Vocational"
