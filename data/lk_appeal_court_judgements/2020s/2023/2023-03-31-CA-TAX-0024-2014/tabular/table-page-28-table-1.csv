"“The  rule  is,  that  whenever,  there  is  a  particular  enactment  and    general"
"enactment in the same statute, and the latter,taken in its most comprehensive"
"sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment must be operative,"
"and the general enactment must be taken to affect only the other parts of the"
"statute to which it may properly apply”."
