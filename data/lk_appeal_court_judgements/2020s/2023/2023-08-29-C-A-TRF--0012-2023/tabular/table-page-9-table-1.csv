"21.  When  the  evidence  was  given  by  the  witnesses  as  per  the  proceedings"
"dated  8th  November  2022  page  31,  Witness  No.1,  the  wife  of  the"
"deceased  person  of the  accident  pertinent  to  this  action,  had  specified"
"that she was taken to the 1st Accused-Petitioner’s house."
"22.  Subsequently,  Prosecution  Witness  No.3  had  complained  to  the  High"
"Court Judge in open court, that he was threatened to give evidence in"
"favour of the Accused-Petitioner."
"23.  Furthermore,  as  per  the  proceeding  dated  22nd  February  2023,  the"
"State  Counsel  had  made  an  application 
to  make 
the  Prosecution"
"Witness No.2 an adverse witness as per the evidence given by him."
"24.  These 
facts  are  part  and  parcel  of 
the  proceedings  of  Case  No."
"HCV/2923/2019.   The High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal had made an"
"order  on  23rd  February  2023  page  76  of  the  same  day’s  proceedings."
"On that, he had specifically given reasons for the grounds on which he"
"is ordering to investigate the matters pertinent to the interference of the"
"Prosecution Witnesses."
"25.  Following  the  said  proceedings,  any  person  will  be  able  to  follow  the"
"orders  given  by 
the  High  Court  Judge,  considering 
the  situation"
"prevailing  before  him.  On  that,  I  do  not  see  any  bias  or  that  the  High"
"Court Judge is not impartial towards the Accused-Petitioner."
"26.  On 
the  other  hand, 
the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  as  per 
the"
"proceedings had taken measures to conclude this case expeditiously."
"27.  Therefore, granting short dates to conclude this matter is not a ground"
"for the Accused-Petitioner to raise that the High Court Judge is biased."
