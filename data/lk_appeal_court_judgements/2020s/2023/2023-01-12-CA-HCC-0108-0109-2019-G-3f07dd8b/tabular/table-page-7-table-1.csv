"13.  There  is  neither  any  inconsistency  nor  any  contradiction"
"between  the  evidence  of  the  PW1  and  the  police  officer"
"who visited the crime scene on the layout of the house, as"
"submitted 
by 
the 
learned 
President’s  Counsel. 
The"
"evidence of the PW1 was that, it was the front room where"
"you  can  see 
the  sitting 
room  when  you  enter.  The"
"evidence  of  the  police  officer  (PW8)  was  that,  she  was"
"shown  the  front  room  by  the  PW1  as  the  place  in  which"
"she  was  sexually  abused.  One  can  enter 
that 
room"
"through  the  veranda.  Hence,  I  find  that  the  grounds  of"
"appeal No. 1 and 2 are devoid of merit."
"14.  The 
Learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the 
appellants"
"submitted  that,  counts  No.  5  and  6  should  fail  because"
"the  offence of  rape was  not  proved, as penile penetration"
"into  the  vagina  was  not  proved.  The  Learned  President’s"
"Counsel 
further  submitted 
that, 
the  medical  evidence"
"does not corroborate vaginal penetration."
"15.  To  complete  the  element  of  penile  penetration,  the  penis"
"need not be inserted deeply into the vaginal passage. It is"
"sufficient that the penis enters beyond the labia majora to"
"the vulva. In cross examination, the PW1 in her evidence"
"said (at page 114 of the brief);"
