"“In 
the 
Indian  setting, 
refusal 
to  act  on 
the"
"testimony of  a  victim of sexual  assault  in  the  absence"
"of  corroboration  as  a  rule, 
is  adding 
insult 
to 
the"
"injury.”"
"21.  Upon carefully scrutinizing the evidence of the PW1, I am"
"of 
the  view 
that 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  was"
"entitled  to  act  upon  her  evidence  without  any 
further"
"corroboration.  Hence,  the  ground  of  appeal  No.  3  should"
"necessarily fail."
"22.  Although  no  specific  ground  of  appeal  was  raised,  the"
"learned 
President’s 
Counsel 
submitted 
that, 
the"
"prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  counts  1  and  2  beyond"
"reasonable  doubt,  as  they  failed  to  prove  that  the  PW1"
"was  kidnapped 
from 
lawful 
guardianship. 
It 
is 
the"
"contention  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that,  the"
"prosecution failed to call the father of the PW1, although"
"he was listed as a witness in the indictment."

"General 
for 
the  respondent 
that, 
the  prosecution  has"
"called the mother of the PW1 to prove the element of lack"
"of consent by the guardian."
"24.  According to the particulars of the offences in counts No.1"
"and  2  of  the  indictment,  it  is  alleged  that  the  PW1  was"
"kidnapped 
from  the 
lawful  guardianship  of  Rajapaksa"
"Arachchige  Gunasiri.  He  is  the  father  of  the  PW1,  whose"
"name  appears  in  the  list  of  witnesses  as  witness  No.  4."
"Section  352  of  the  Penal  Code  that  defines  kidnapping"
"from lawful guardianship provides that, whoever takes or"
"entices  any  minor  under  sixteen  years  of  age  if  a  female"
"without  the  consent  of  such  guardian  is  said  to  have"
"kidnapped such minor from lawful guardianship."
"25.  The  particulars  of  the  offences  in  counts  No.  1  and  2"
"clearly  mention  that,  the  said  R.  A.  Gunasiri  was  the"
"lawful  guardian  of  the  PW1.  Thus,  it  is  incumbent  upon"
