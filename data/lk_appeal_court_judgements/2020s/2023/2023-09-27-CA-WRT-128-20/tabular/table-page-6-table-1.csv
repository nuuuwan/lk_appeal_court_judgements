"Lanka  for  the  Sand Nourishment  Project  (marked  '1R11').  The  Cabinet  had"
"approved this request on 18.10.2018 (marked '1R12')."
"In  determining  whether  necessary  requirements  imposed  by  the  regulatory"
"authorities and the requirements under the law have been complied with, this"
"Court observes as follows."
"The 1st Respondent had requested the renewal of Environmental Approval for"
"offshore sand mining and the Beach Nourishment Project from the CEA (2nd"
"Respondent) after Cabinet approval (marked '1R4'). The CEA had responded"
"on  06.06.2018  (marked  'IR5'),  indicating  that  a  similar  project  occurred  in"
"2014  to  nourish  Unawatuna  Bay  with  200,000m3  of  sand  mined  from  the"
"same location, 5-10 km away from Ratmalana â€“ Moratuwa DS Administration"
"boundary. The CEA observed that the present project is an alteration to the"
"original proposal due to differences in the transfer route and the quantity of"
"sand to be dredged. The 1st Respondent replied on 07.06.2018 (marked '1R6'),"
"providing  clarifications 
for  queries  raised  by  the  2nd  Respondent.  This"
"response  addresses 
issues  such  as  environmentally  protected/sensitive"
"habitats, precautionary measures, and impacts on fisheries. After obtaining"
"Cabinet Approvals, it is submitted that the 1st Respondent had conducted a"
"comprehensive Feasibility Study for the extraction of 800,000 m3 of sand and"
"the beach nourishment project. A Feasibility Study Report (1R13) has been"
"prepared, 
covering 
project 
details, 
environmental 
impacts,  mitigation"
"measures,  and  legal  requirements.  It  concludes  that  the  proposed  beach"
"nourishment  project  has 
the 
least 
impact  compared 
to  other  coastal"
"stabilization  measures  and  is  considered  the  most  environmentally  friendly"
"solution in coastal engineering."
"Accordingly, the environmental approval which was requested by letter dated"
"28.05.2018 has been granted by the CEA on 20.06.2018 (marked '1R20'). It"
"is also noted that the Industrial Mining License has been issued by the GSMB"
"for the period of 26.03.2019 to 25/3/2020 (marked 'R21')."
