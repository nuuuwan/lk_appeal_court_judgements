"consider it as a legitimate expectation when the basic ingredients necessary"
"for the formation of a legitimate expectation are lacking."
"Therefore, although the Petitioner asserted that his experience and his services"
"in the permanent cadre are not different from his previous duties, this cannot"
"be considered for the appointment to the post if the Petitioner lacks the basic"
"qualifications to apply for the position."
"The Petitioner's claims against the PSC."
"The  petitioner  stated  that  the  PSC  had  not  given  him  a  hearing  before  the"
"decision to revoke his appointment was made. The petitioner testified that his"
"letter  of  appointment  does  not  give  the  employer  discretion  or  the  right  to"
"terminate his services without due process. Furthermore, the PSC did not rely"
"on  Rule  56  of  Procedural  Rules,  Volume  I,  Appointment,  Promotions  and"
"Transfer of Public Officers, issued by the Public Service Commission in terms"
"of Article 61B and 58 (1) of the Constitution and published in Extra Ordinary"
"Gazette Notification No. 1589/30 dated February 20, 2009, the only provision"
"on which the PSC could have relied had the petitioner in fact been guilty of"
"providing  false  and  erroneous  information  or  documents.  The  Petitioner"
"argued that even if the decision is based on Rule 56, it expressly provides that"
"a right to be heard should be granted. The petitioner stated that the PSC did"
"not invoke Rule 56 as there was no fraud, mischief or misrepresentation on"
"the  part  of  the  Petitioner.  It  was  also  stated  that  the  PSC  disregarded  the"
"Petitioner’s experience and his services. Finally, the Petitioner stated that he"
"has been demoted and/or punished for no fault of the Petitioner17."
"The Respondent contended that the jurisdiction of this Court to inquire into,"
"pronounce  upon  or  in  any  manner  call  in  question  any  order  or  a  decision"
"made by the PSC is ousted by Article 61 A of the Constitution which reads as"
"follows;"
"‘61A. Subject to the provision of Article 59 and of Article 126, no court or"
"tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon"
"or  in  any  manner  call  in  question  any  order  or  decision  made  by  the"
"Commission, a Committee or any Public Officer, in pursuance of any power"
