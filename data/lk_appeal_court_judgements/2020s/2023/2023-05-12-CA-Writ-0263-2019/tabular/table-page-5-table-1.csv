"of the 14th Respondent, PSC informed the Petitioner that his appointment is"
"cancelled  with  immediate  effect  since  he  does  not  possess  the  minimum"

"informed the Ministry of Justice that  the PSC sanctioned the release of the"

Prison  Guard8.  Consequently, 
the"

"released the Petitioner from the post of Community Corrections Officer to the"
"post of Prison Guard9. According to the Petitioner, he was placed at the first"
"step of the salary scale of the post of Prison Guard having deferred twenty-"

"applied to the post of Community Corrections Officer as an internal candidate,"
"he had suppressed material information pertaining to his satisfactory service"
"record  immediately  preceding  the  five  years  period  from  the  date  of  the"
