"and according to the Petitioner, was informed that the property No. 54, Palali"
"Road, Thirunelweli, Jaffna had been owned by a person who was alleged to have"
"had links with the LTTE. Petitioner states that he was a bona fide purchaser of"
"the property and he had no link, connection or association with the LTTE. On"
"29th August 2016 the predecessor in office of the 1st Respondent had issued the"
"letter marked P9 cancelling the liquor license issued to the Petitioner citing the"
"provisions of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1721/2 dated 29.08.2011 which is"
"marked P10. The Petitioner states that he made several appeals both verbally"
"and in writing to transfer the liquor license to another premises owned by the"
"Petitioner  in  close  vicinity  to  the  present  business  premises.  The  Petitioner"
"states that he had a legitimate expectation to the effect that the liquor license"
"issued to carry on business at the present business premises will be transferred"
"to the other premises owned by the Petitioner. Petitioner states that this liquor"
"license  was  originally  transferred  from  Giriulla  to  the  present 
locality.  The"
