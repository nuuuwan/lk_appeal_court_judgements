"“When  an  order  has  been  made  absolute  under  section  100  or  section  101  the"
"Magistrate shall give notice of the same to the person against whom the order was"
"made and shall further require him to perform the act directed by the order within"
"a time specified in the notice and inform him that in case of disobedience, he will"
"be liable to the penalties provided by subsection (2) of section 100”."
"It is evident that the Court can only make a conditional order absolute ex-parte"
"under section 100 (2) when the party, notice being served, does not appear or   if"
"a party against whom a conditional order is made, obeys the order without any"
"condition. 
In  any  other  time,  an 
inquiry  must  be  held  when  making  the"
"conditional  order  absolute.  Furthermore,  under  section  102  when  an  absolute"

"recommendations  within  2  months.  Therefore,  this  Court  identifies  the  order"
"made on 11.12.2014 as the conditional order under section 98 of CCPA."
"Furthermore,  a  key  contention  of  the  proceedings  at  the  HC  stage  has  been"
