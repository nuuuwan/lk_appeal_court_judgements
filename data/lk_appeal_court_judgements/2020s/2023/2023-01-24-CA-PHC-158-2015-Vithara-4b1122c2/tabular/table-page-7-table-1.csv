"of  Criminal Procedure Act (hereinafter referred  to  as  CCPA) in the Magistrate’s"
"Court of Matara in terms of purported complaints by 1-7 1st party-respondents-"
"respondents (hereinafter referred to as respondents). The complaints were made"
"on the basis that the activities of the company were injurious to the health of the"
"community  and  that  the  company  has  not  obtained  required  approvals  from"
"authorities.    Upon  considering  the  inspections  and  submission  the  learned"
"Magistrate  of  Matara  ordered  on  11.12.2014  to  implement  certain  practical"
"recommendations  by  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  for  the  company"
"premises within a time period of two months."
"The MC has ordered the appellant to submit a report on 2.4.2015 to assess the"
"compliance  to  court  ordered  recommendations.  The  case  has  been  fixed  for"
"7.5.2015, but the learned Magistrate did not make an order but entered a journal"
"entry that inter alia ‘the case will be taken up for inquiry under section 101 of the"
"CCPA’. A revisionary application was filed in the Matara HC on the basis that the"
"learned Magistrate has erred in law by fixing the case for taking evidence under"

"order on 11.12.2014 and the High Court  further set aside the 7.5.2015 order of"
"the  learned  Magistrate    using  its  revisionary  jurisdiction.  High  Court      further"
"ordered to consider the appellant to have violated a conditional order under the"
"CCPA as all the recommendations had not been implemented by the appellant by"
"that time as mentioned in 11.12.2014 order."
"The only contention that has arrived upon this Court is to assess the validity of"
"the order of the HC dated 30.06.2015. At the inquiry the counsel appearing for"
"the  appellant  submitted  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  correctly"
"applied law, thereby the order is bad. The Deputy Solicitor General appearing for"
"the State was in the view that 11.12.2014 order by the MC is duly made following"
"the correct procedure. The DSG conceded that the matter is still at the section"
