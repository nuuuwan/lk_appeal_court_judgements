"The  corresponding  legislation  in  India  contains  in  Rule  9  (2)  of  the  customs’"
"valuation (determination of price of imported goods) Rules of 1988 which reads"
"as follows;"
"“9. Costs and Services."
"(2) For the purpose of sub section (1) and sub section (1A) of section 14 of the"
"Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962) and these rules, the value of the imported goods"
"shall be the value of such goods, for delivery at the time and place of importation"

"(a) the cost of transport of the imported goods to the place of importation."
"(b) loading, unloading and handling charges associated with the delivery of the"

"(c) ………”"
"There  is  a  fundamental  difference  between  the  aforementioned  provisions"
"contained in the Indian Legislation and the provisions contained in Article 8 (1)"
"(e) of Schedule E of the Sri Lankan Customs Ordinance (as amended). The Rule"
"9 (2) of the Indian rules applicable to the situation refers to the word “at”. That"
"rule refers to unloading charges associated with the delivery of the imported"
"goods at the place of importation. But Article 8 (1) (e) of Schedule E of the Sri"
"Lankan  Customs  Ordinance  refers  to  the  word  “to”.  The  Indian  Legislation  is"
"somewhat similar to the legislation contained in the sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3"
"of  Schedule  E  of  the  Customs  (amendment)  Act  No.  83  of  1988  which  was"
"repealed by the Customs (amendment) Act No. 2 of 2003. Therefore, the ratio"
"decidendi  in  Garden  Silk  Mills  Ltd  and  Anr  Vs  Union  of  India  and  Ors  is  not"
"applicable to this situation."
"Section 51 of the Customs Ordinance (as amended) reads as follows;"
"“51. In all cases when the duties imposed upon the importation of articles are"
"charged according to the value thereof, the respective value of each such article"
"shall be stated in the entry together with the description and quantity of the"
"same, and duly affirmed by a declaration made by the importer or his agent on"
"a form of such size and colour as may be specified by the Director – General by"
"notification  published  in  the  Gazette,  and  such  value  shall  be  determined  in"
"accordance with the provisions of Schedule E, and duties shall be paid on a value"
"so determined.”"
