"(2)  The President of the Court of Appeal in consultation with the Chief Justice, may issue directions"
"from time to time pertaining to appeals, applications in revision and restitutio in integrum pending"
"in the Court of Appeal on the date of the coming into operation of this section, to be removed for"
"hearing  and  determination  to  an  appropriate  High  Court  established  by  Article  154P  of  the"
"Constitution.  Any  such  direction  may  be  made  by  reference  to  the  year  in  which  the  appeal  or"
"application,  as  the  case  may  be,  was  filed  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  such  High  Court  shall  be"
"vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeal or application, as the case may be, in"
"accordance with the provisions of section 5A of this Act, as if such appeal or application was filed"
"directly in such High Court."
"Section  5C  deals  with  appeals  from  the  Judgments  and  Orders  of  the  Provincial  High  Court"
"exercising appellate and revisionary jurisdiction. According to this section, there is only one direct"
"appeal to the Supreme Court and this appeal also is subject to leave being first obtained from the"
"Court."
"Generally, courts are expected to follow the plain meaning of the statute, however, in this case,"
"there  seems  to  be  a  lacuna  in  statutory  construction  as  to  whether  revisionary  jurisdiction  was"
"intended to remain with the Court of Appeal or not under section 5C of the Act. Therefore, this"
"court  will  have  to  look  beyond  the  literal  interpretation  of  the  statute,  towards  the  purpose  of"
"introducing the Amendment Act No. 54 of 2006."
"In the case of Chairman and Members of Debt Conciliation Board v Ranepura Devage Hector"
"J
ayasiri [SC Appeal No.134/14 SC Minutes 14.07.2020] court in interpreting an Amendment to"
"the  Debt  Reconciliation  Act  -  Amendment  Act  No.  29  of  1999  interpreted  the  Act  based  on  the"
"purpose of the Amending Act, which was to prevent weaker borrowers from corrupt lenders."
