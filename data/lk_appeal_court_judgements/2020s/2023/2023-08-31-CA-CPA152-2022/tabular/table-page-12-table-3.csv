"Here I would also revisit Justice Salam’s interpretation of the Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal"
"where it was stated that,"
"‘Prior to 1978, an appeal from a District Court had to be preferred to the (then) Supreme"
"Court.  The  Court  of  Appeal  as  is  presently  constituted  being  the  creation  of  the  1978"
"Constitution was conferred with exclusive civil appellate jurisdiction with a special right"
"of appeal to the Supreme Court, at the instance of an aggrieved party, subject to the leave"
"of the Court of appeal or the Supreme Court first had and obtained.’"
