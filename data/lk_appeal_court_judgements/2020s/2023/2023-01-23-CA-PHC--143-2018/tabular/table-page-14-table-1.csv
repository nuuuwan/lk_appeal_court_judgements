"interpretation that there was an equal possibility that the offence was committed without the"
"knowledge as with knowledge."
"Notwithstanding  all  this,  one  may  say  that  the  appellant  may  well  have  known  of  the"
"commission of the offence. But that is a mere hypothesis which does not have the support of"
"the evidence. It may arguably be said that there is a doubt or a feeling of uncertainty as to the"
"truth of the appellant's version that the offence was committed without his knowledge. But, if"
"the truth must be told, in my own mind, there is even a greater doubt as to whether it was"
"committed with his knowledge. Of the two versions, viz that the offence was committed with"
"the knowledge and without knowledge, the latter version is more probable even though there"
"may be, perhaps, a doubt in regard to the truth of it. In general, of the two versions of events,"
"one version can be accepted as the more probable version even when there is doubt in regard"
"to the very version that is upheld as the more probable version for if there is not even a doubt"
"in regard to it, that version must be held to be proved beyond a doubt which high degree of"
"proof is not cast, by the law, on the appellant in this case."
"The facts designated above are not, by their very nature, the sort of facts which of themselves"
"exclude or imply distinctly the existence of the fact sought to be proved - the fact sought to be"
"proved by means of these facts being that the appellant had knowledge of the commission of"
"this particular offence of which his driver was convicted in the Magistrate's Court of Pilessa, for"
"that matter, the said facts particularized or designated above are, so to say, natural facts in that"
"they neither imply nor exclude the fact sought to be proved - the fact sought to be proved is,"
"as stated above, that the appellant had knowledge."
"Both the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge had clearly drawn the inference"
"that the said facts showed that the relevant offence was committed with the knowledge of the"
"appellant.  It  is  true  that  the  burden  was  on  the  appellant  to  prove  that  the  offence  was"
"committed  without  his  knowledge,  but  the  facts  enumerated  above  from  which  both  the"
"learned Magistrate and the  learned High Court Judge had concluded that the appellant had"
"knowledge  had,  at  best,  some  remote  conjectural  probative  force,  if  any.  Those  facts  may,"
"perhaps,  make  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  to  the  effect  that  the  offence  was  committed"
"without his knowledge somewhat doubtful or suspenseful but they do not possess the force or"
"probative value even cumulatively, of making the fact that the offence was committed without"
"the knowledge of the appellant less probable than that it was committed with the appellant's"
"knowledge for those facts have no clear bearing on the disputed question of knowledge or lack"
"of it on the part of the appellant and do not enable one to draw a firm or decided inference in"
"regard thereto - one way or the other."
"As would appear from the sequel each one of these facts relied on by the Judges in the Courts"
"below  does  not  even  when  amalgamated  exclude  lack  of  knowledge  on  the  part  of  the"
"appellant although those facts enumerated above and relied on by the Judges in the Courts"
"below to attribute knowledge to the appellant may, perhaps, leave the matter in some doubt"
"although the probability of the veracity of the appellant's evidence that he had no knowledge"
"does not disappear in consequence thereof."
"Although  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  had  no  knowledge  is  on  the"
"appellant, he being the owner, yet that question of whether or not he had knowledge, needless"
"to say, has to be decided on the totality of the evidence available to Court. As stated above,"
