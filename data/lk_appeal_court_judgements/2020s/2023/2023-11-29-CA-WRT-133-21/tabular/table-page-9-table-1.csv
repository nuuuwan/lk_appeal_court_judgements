"that by 2021 there would be 5 vacancies in each class that existed from Grade"
"1, in addition to the 45 slots of each additional classroom of Grade 6 dedicated"
"for taking in students who succeed in the Grade 5 scholarship examination."
"H
owever,  the  Petitioners  have  failed  to  sufficiently  establish  that  there  has"
"illegal, 
improper  conduct  with  regard  to  admissions 
been  ultra  vires  or"
"impacting  the  year  2021,  particularly  admissions  of  Grade  6.  And  also,"
"whether the Petitioner would have been able to be admitted to such schools,"
"if so. While it is established by the Annual Audit Report of the National Audit"
"Office (marked ‘P11’) that an excessive number of students than the permitted"
"number,  have  been  admitted  to  certain  schools 
in  2019,  such 
finding"
"regarding 2019 cannot be directly imputed or considered for the year 2021."
"I
t  is  also  contended  by  the  Petitioners  that  while  they  have  obtained  high"
"marks, the cut-off marks for the year 2020 is higher than previous years. This"
"Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  cut-off  marks  of  a  particular  year  cannot  be"
"compared  with  cut-off  marks  of  the  previous  years  to  form  any  conclusive"
"opinion, as the difficulty of the examination and capability of students vary"
"from year to year amongst various other factors. Therefore, the position that"
"cut-off marks of a particular  year is higher or lower than another holds no"
"material ground for reasoning unless all and several other relevant factors in"
"that regard can be taken into consideration in addition to details on available"
"slots."
"F
or the above reasons, I dismiss the Application of the Petitioners and make"
"no order as to the costs of this Application."
"A
     
pplication dismissed, No Costs."
