"absent without leave from 22.11.2017 and reported back to work on 18.12.2017. However, the"
"Petitioner  had  taken  off  from  the  hospital  on  the  very  same  day  without  obtaining  necessary"
"permission.  Although 
the  Petitioner  has 
requested  permission 
to 
resign 
from  service  by"
"19.12.2017,  his  request  was  not  administratively  processed  as  he  was  absent  from  service"
"without  leave.  The  Petitioner  was  discharged  from  service  on  30.09.2020  under  the  clause  of"
"‘service no longer required’."
"It is common ground that the Petitioner has been suffering from depression during the period of"
"his  service  in  the  Sri  Lanka  Air  Force.  The  Petitioner  has requested to resign  from  Sri  Lanka  Air"
"Force  by  way  of  a  letter  dated  08.11.2017  on  medical  grounds.  However,  the  Petitioner  was"
"absent  from  service  without  leave  from  22.11.2017.  Petitioner’s  absence  from  service  without"
"obtaining  leave  had  caused  his  request  for  resignation  to  not  be  administratively  processed."
"These  circumstances  are  reflected  in  the  letter  dated  05.01.2018  marked  R5.  Therefore,  it  is"
"apparent  such  a request  for resignation  could  not  be  considered  in respect  of  a  person  who  is"
"absent from the service of the Sri Lanka Air Force without leave."
"Although the Petitioner had taken off from the hospital on 18.12.2017 without permission, once"
"again on 19.12.2017, immediately afterwards the Petitioner had made another request to resign"
"from the service on medical grounds. Consequently, the Petitioner was informed by the Sri Lanka"
"Air  Force  that  no  measure  could  be taken  in respect  of  the application made  by  the  Petitioner"
"seeking  medical  pension  as  he  has  been  considered  absent  from  service  without  leave  by  the"
"letter dated 05.01.2018 marked R5. Furthermore, the Petitioner was advised to report to the Sri"
"Lanka  Air  Force  immediately  for  any  further  steps  to  be  taken  to  discharge  the  Petitioner  in"
"accordance with the Air Force Law and Regulations by the said letter R5."
"It is pertinent to note that if specific criteria are laid down in the statute, authorities are bound to"
"follow such criteria. It is further observed that the Petitioner has not acted or complied with the"
"instructions  given  by  the  said 
letter  marked  R5  which  he  had  a  duty  to  comply  with.  The"
"Petitioner’s failure to comply with such instructions had caused the Respondents to discharge the"
"Petitioner under the clause of ‘service no longer required’ on 06.02.2020 by letter marked P9 in"
"terms  of  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  Since  the  Petitioner  has  not  complied  with  the"
"instructions  given  in  the  letter  R5  and  owing  to  his  failure  to  inform  his  inability  to  report  to"
"service to the relevant authorities, if in fact he was incapable of reporting, it is observed that the"
"Petitioner  has  not  come  before 
this  court  with  clean  hands.  Writ 
Jurisdiction  being  a"
"discretionary  remedy,  the  conduct  of  the  applicant 
is  also  relevant,  and  his  conduct  may"
"disentitle him to the remedy.1"
"Hence it is clear that the Sri Lanka Air Force has acted  in response to the request made by the"
"Petitioner in a fair and reasonable manner considering the health condition of the Petitioner and"
"giving due attention to the applicable laws and regulations of the Sri Lanka Air Force by its letter"
"marked R5. In the instant application, it must be acknowledged that the authorities are under an"
