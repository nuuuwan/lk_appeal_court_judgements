"The Petitioner in this application is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the letter of  discharge"
"from the service under the clause ‘service no longer required’ dated 06.02.2020 marked P9 and"
"letter dated 16.06.2020 refusing the Petitioner’s request for the pension marked P11 and a Writ"
"of  Mandamus  requiring  the  Respondents  to  reinstate  the  Petitioner  and  then  dismiss  the"
"Petitioner from service subject to the relevant medical pension schemes and gratuity. The factual"
"matrix of the case is as follows."
"The Petitioner joined the Sri Lanka Air Force in 2008 and was appointed to Air Force Presidential"
"Security Unit. The Petitioner states that while he was following a Course at Palali Air Force Base"
"on a day in February 2014, he was suddenly admitted to the Palali Base Hospital and later taken"
"to the Katunayake Air Force Hospital on the following day. It is submitted that the reason for such"
"admission to the aforesaid hospitals was unknown to the Petitioner. The Petitioner had been kept"
"at the Katunayake Air Force Hospital for over one week and was referred to a psychiatrist. Since"
"the  Petitioner  was  not  allowed  to  meet  or  contact  anyone  and  had  no  way  out  of  the  said"
"situation,  Petitioner 
claims 
that  he  was  depressed. 
The  Petitioner 
further 
states 
that"
"subsequently he has been sent back to the Palali Camp stating that he was not suffering from any"
"ailment."
"Thereafter,  the  Petitioner  was  transferred  again  to  the  Presidential  Security  Unit.  Again,  on  or"
"about  20.10.2014  the  Petitioner  met  with  an  accident  and  had  to  take  treatment 
in  the"
"Ratmalana Air Force Camp Hospital for over two months. The fact that the Petitioner was forced"
"to stay away from work had mentally affected him and was treated for depression. The Petitioner"
"sought  permission  to  resign  from  the  Sri  Lanka  Air  Force  on  medical  grounds  on  or  about"

"was absent without leave. Thereafter the Petitioner had been dismissed from service under the"
"clause  ‘service  no  longer  required’  by  the  letter  dated  06.02.2020  marked  P9.  By  the  letter"
"marked  P11,  the  Petitioner  has  also  been  informed  that  his  request  for  a  pension  cannot  be"
"accommodated in terms of the existing Air Force Law.  The Petitioner submits that his dismissal"

"natural justice."

"Palali medical section on 21.01.2014 as the Petitioner was not in a mentally fit position to follow"
