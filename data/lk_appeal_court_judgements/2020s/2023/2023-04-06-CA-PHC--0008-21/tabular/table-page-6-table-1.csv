"It was the position of the learned State Counsel that the decided cases pointed"
"out  are  cases  where  the  vehicles  used  in  transportation  of  soil  or  sand  were"
"confiscated. It was her contention that the decided Court of Appeal cases which"
"determined that a vehicle used in the transportation of any material that falls"
"within the interpretation of the Mines and Minerals Act, would not be subjected"
"to a confiscation order, is different to the facts and the circumstances of the case"
"under appeal. It was her view that the facts and the circumstances reveal that"
"the  loader  used  in  the  commission  of  the  offence  had  been  used  not  for  the"
"purpose of transportation but as a machinery to dig earth soil and to load the"
"same to the vehicle which transported the soil. It was her position that it was the"
"very reason why two separate charges have been framed against the two accused"
"before the learned Magistrate, for which they have pleaded guilty."
"For  the  better  understanding  of  this  judgement,  I  would  now  reproduce  the"
"section 63 B (1) of the Mines and Minerals Act as amended by Amendment Act"
"No. 66 of 2009."
