"Thus,  if  the  Appellant  in  this  application  wishes  to  establish  his  legal  rights  to  the"
"disputed portion of land, this is not the forum to adjudicate legal right of parties relating"
"to the land in dispute."
"In the case of Nandawathi and others v Mahindasena5 it was held that,"
"“When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in"
"the High Court, the High Court can exercise only the legality of that Order and"
"not the correction of that Order”."
"It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. that;"
"“I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances"
"should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application"
"to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the"
"High Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal"
