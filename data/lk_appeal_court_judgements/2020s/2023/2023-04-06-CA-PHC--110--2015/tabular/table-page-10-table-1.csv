"the learned High Court Judges to direct parties to the competent civil courts to have their"
"legal rights in question adjudicated and possession of the rightful owners established."
"In the case of Rasheed Ali v Mohomed Ali and Others,11  it was held that the powers of"
"revision could be used only in exceptional circumstances. A merely wrong order made by"
"a  judge  or  wrong  reasons  given  for  the  order  by  a  judge  alone  does  not  amount  to"
"exceptional circumstances."
"Although  there  is  no  right  of  appeal  against  the  order  of a  Magistrate  acting  in  the"
"capacity of a Primary Court Judge exercising jurisdiction in terms of Section 66 of the"
"Primary Courtsâ€™ Procedure  Act, revisionary jurisdiction is permissible in exceptional"
"circumstances  where  any  injustice  or  a  miscarriage  of  justice  has  been  caused  to  a"
"party. The Court of Appeal is not empowered to correct errors made by the learned"
"Magistrate.  However,  Court  of  Appeal  has  to  determine  whether  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge has properly exercised his duty when ascertaining whether any injustice"
"was caused to a party or whether any miscarriage of justice has occurred by the Order"
"of  the  learned  Magistrate.  By  invoking  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  a  Court,  the"
"aggrieved party can challenge the  legality of an order but not the  correctness of an"
"order."
"Therefore, the learned High Court Judge was correct in refusing to intervene with the"
"order dated 20.06.2017 of the learned Magistrate/ Primary Court Judge."
"In view of the aforesaid judicial pronouncements, it clearly manifests that existence of"
"exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of revisionary powers."
"It is seen in the averments of the Petition of Appeal that the Appellant had purchased"
"the  subject  matter  of  the  instant  action  by  deed  of  transfer  bearing  no  3998  on"
"26.02.2014 from the 5th Respondent in this Appeal."
"Apparently,  the  1st  Respondent  namely  Anura  Samarajeewa  and  the  5th  Respondent"
"namely Sriyanie Manel Dharmadasa are husband and wife."
"According to the Police complaint made by the said 5th Respondent wife alleging that"
"the 1st Respondent had beaten her, and the Police had filed case bearing No B527/14"
"on 11.03.2014. Consequently, the 1st Respondent was remanded until 14.03.2014 and"
"he was bailed out on 14.03.2014."
