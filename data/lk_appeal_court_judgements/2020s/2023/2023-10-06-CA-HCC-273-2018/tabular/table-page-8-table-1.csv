"Thereafter the trial judge had referred to the circumstantial evidence and has"
"itemized the circumstances which had arisen against the accused in the case of"
"the prosecution."
"In  a  case  based  on  circumstantial  evidence  the  prosecution  lends  itself  to  a"
"reasonable inference that either the accused or another could have committed"
"the act, the prosecution must exclude the other effectively in order to attach"
"responsibility to the accused for that act. This has been discussed in the cases"
"of The Queen vs Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, Kuruppaiah Serveys vs The King"
"1960 52 NLR 227 and in many others."
"In the instant matter the trial judge had discussed the adverse circumstances"
"pertaining to the accused at page 382 and has concluded that the circumstantial"
"evidence led at the trial draws the irresistible inference that the appellant and"
"no other committed the murder of the deceased."
"The counsel for the appellant raised three grounds of appeal which we have"
"discussed above but we see no merit in the same. As such the instant appeal"
"is dismissed and the conviction and the sentence of the appellant is here by"
"affirmed."
