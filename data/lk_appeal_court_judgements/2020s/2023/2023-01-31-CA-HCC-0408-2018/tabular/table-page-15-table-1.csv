"be dismissed as there is no merit in the pleaded grounds of appeal. Hence, I"
"affirm the conviction and sentence of the Appellant and proceed to dismiss"
"his appeal."
"Further,  in  this  case  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  sentenced  the"
"Appellant on counts 6,7,8 and 9 as well. As the said counts are alternative"
"counts to counts 2,3,4 and  5, I set aside the sentence imposed on counts"
"6,7,8 and 9."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
