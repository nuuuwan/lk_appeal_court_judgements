"""A tribunal exercising quasi-judicial functions is not bound to adopt a particular procedure"
"in the absence of statutory provision. In some situations, the tribunals have to act within"
"certain limits. However, it needs to observe certain minimum standards of natural justice"

"The need to follow the principles of natural justice is an accepted norm in Sri Lankan courts"
"and tribunals as well as in the world over for several decades. I am of the opinion that the"
"need  to  follow  principles  of  natural  justice  has now  become  part  of the  Sri  Lankan  law."

"AC 237 at 276, where it was ""held that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of"
"hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to"

"The suspension, issued by the DGHS, dated 12/12/2022, produced marked as P19, without ever"
"having afforded the 2nd Petitioner Hospital an opportunity of being heard prior to the suspension"
"being issued, is a clear violation of the principles of audi altera partem, and in gross violation of"
"the principles of Natural Justice, which renders such decision voidable."
"This position if further supported by Wade & Forsyth, ""Administrative Law"", 11th Edition, page 374,"
"as follows:"
"""Violation  of  natural  justice  is  then  to  be  classified  as  one  of  the  varieties  of  wrong"
"procedure, or abuse of power, which transgress the implied conditions which Parliament is"
"presumed to have intended. Just as a power to act ""as he thinks fit"" does not allow a public"
"authority  to  act  unreasonably  or 
in  bad  faith,  so 
it  does  not  allow  disregard  of  the"
"elementary  doctrines  of  fair  procedure.  Thus,  violation  of  natural 
justice  makes  the"

"""The basic requirement of this maxim is that each party must have a reasonable notice of"

"answering (if he can) any arguments put forward against it. This requirement of natural"
"justice applies to all statutory functions i.e. administrative judicial or quasi-judicial, because"
"where holders of power have been assigned duty to decide he rights of individuals, those"
"likely to be affected must be given the opportunity of having their say. This is a procedural"
"propriety"""
"In addition, it is my view that suspending the 2nd Petitioner Hospital, as a knee jerk reaction, to a"
