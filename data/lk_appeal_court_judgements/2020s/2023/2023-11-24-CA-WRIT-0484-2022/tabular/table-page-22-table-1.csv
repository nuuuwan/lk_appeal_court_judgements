"DGHS provides his consent, in writing. To any person above the age of 21 years, for the removal,"
"during his lifetime, from his body of non-regenerative tissue. All such transplantation of kidneys,"
"carried out at the 2nd Petitioner hospital, have been undertaken pursuant to the relevant consent"
"being  approved  from  the  DGHS,  prior  to  such  surgeries  being  undertaken.  In  fact,  the  files"
"pertinent to the Complainant Donors, and their relevant consent forms, issued under the hand of"
"the  DGHS,  has  been  annexed  to  Prof.  Ravindra  Fernando,  Chairman  of  the  Ethical  Review"
"Committee, produced marked as X-11, dated 08/01/2023."
"As such, it is blatantly obvious that the 2nd Petitioner Hospital, had acted well within the scope and"
"ambit  of  section  7  of  the  Transplantation  of  Human  Tissues  Act,  by  submitting  all  relevant"
"documentation to the DGHS, for his due consent, and approval prior to the surgeries being carried"
"out at the Hospital."
"The only penal provision contained in the Transplantation of Human Tissues Act, is contained in"
"section 17, which stipulates that anyone buying, selling disposing of, or otherwise dealing in, either"
"directly or indirectly, for valuable consideration, without the prior written approval of the Ministry"
"of Health, shall be guilty of an offence, and on conviction after a summary trial before a Magistrate,"
"be liable to imprisonment of either description for a period not exceeding two years or to a fine"
"not exceeding one thousand five hundred rupees or to both such imprisonment and fine."
"As such, even if at all, if one were to merely allege, that the 2nd Petitioner Hospital has engaged in"
"an alleged kidney scam, then the proper course of action, would be to seek a conviction before the"
"Magistrate's Court, in term of section 17 of the Transplantation of Human Tissues Act, and not to"
"recklessly,  and  callously  issue  a  temporarily  suspension,  suspending  all  kidney  transplantation"
"surgeries  at  the  2nd  Petitioner  Hospital,  merely  on  a  purported  media  expos√©.  In  fact,  further"
"fuelling fire to the situation, are the multiple of media statements that have been made by the"
"officials of the Ministry of Health, on 24/11/2022 and 05/12/2022, had made statements that a"
"decision had been made to suspend kidney transplantation surgeries at the 2nd Petitioner Hospital,"
"when in fact no such notice of such allegations, or purported suspension had even remotely been"
"communicated  to  the  2nd  Petitioner  Hospital,  although  the  Hospital,  had  on  its  own  volition,"
"written to the DGHS, seeking clarifications on the issue, produced marked as P12."
"The  first  notice  that  the  Ministry  of  Health,  was  entertaining  the  purported  allegation,  was  by"
"letter, bearing reference No. PHSD/B/KT/INVES/2022, dated 08/12/2022, produced marked as P17,"
"whereby the Hospital was merely asked the details of the Directors of the Hospital, the Ethical"
"Review Committee, and kidney transplantation surgeons at the hospital, and a mere 4 days, later,"
"i.e.  on  12/12/2022,  without  having  carried  out  any  form  of  investigation,  and  thus  in  blatant"
"disregard  to  the  trite  principles  of  natural  justice,  issued  the  temporary  letter  of  suspension,"
"produced marked as P19."
"There is no provision in law to issue such a suspension of surgeries. This court had most pertinently"
"questioned the Respondents, as to the particular provisions, upon which the impugned suspension"
"letter had been issued. However, whilst the Respondents had made several submissions, as will"
"more fully be alluded to hereinafter, the Respondents, had failed to provide, with clarity, and/or"
"certainty, the precise provisions upon which such action had been taken."
