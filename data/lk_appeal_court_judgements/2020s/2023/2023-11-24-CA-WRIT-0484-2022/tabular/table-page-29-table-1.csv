"The  very  1st  recommendation  itself,  called  for  a  proper  criminal  investigation  be  carried  out  to"
"come to a final conclusion on whether an 'organ racket' had taken place in the hospital. Thus, it is"
"evident that the committee has not arrived at any conclusive factual findings against the Hospital."
"To continue with this suspension, pending the conclusion of an open-ended criminal investigation,"
"with  no  time  frame  or  end  in  sight,  would  be  tantamount  to  a  permanent  suspension,  and  is"
"therefore perverse and cannot be upheld by this Court."
"The recommendation in the Report, made 6 months following issuance of the impugned letter of"
"suspension (P19), is effectively to continue with the suspension until such time as the conclusion"
"of all relevant investigation, inquiries, as well as the conclusion of any legal proceedings that may,"
"or may not be instituted. Clearly then, even at this stage there is insufficient material to conclude"
"that the Hospital had committed wrongful acts. Therefore, it is evident at the time the impugned"
"suspension  was  issued,  there  was  no  material  whatsoever  for  Ministry  of  Health  to  arrive  at  a"
"prima facie conclusion that a wrong had been perpetrated. So far, the Respondents have failed to"
"demonstrate the matters relied on to issue the suspension made on 12/12/2022."
"Thus,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  argued  that  the  Statement  of  Objections  filed  on"
"behalf of the 1st to 5th Respondents, and more particularly the Report, produced marked as 1R6"
"thereto is blatantly a self-serving document, seeking to rationalize and validate ex post facto, the"
"impugned decision, retrospectively, and invalid, illegal, has not basis in Law."
"It is evident from the foregoing the impugned suspension P19 has been issued:"
