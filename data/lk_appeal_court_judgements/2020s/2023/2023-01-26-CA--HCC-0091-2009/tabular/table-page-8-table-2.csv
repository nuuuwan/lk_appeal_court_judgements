"It was the contention of the learned Judge of the High Court that misdirection relating to the"
"principles governing the evaluation of circumstantial evidence cases."
"Page 264 of the appeal brief is as follows;"
"“…You have to decide whether they gave false or true evidence from the witness box"
"based on their age and dispositions. During the trial evidence given by an eye witness"
"is considered as primary evidence and direct evidence. That is to say if a person gives"
"evidence that 'I saw the offence occurring' it is called direct evidence. But most of the"
"offences occur unseen. It is very rare for people to be direct witnesses. Offences like"
"murder, sexual molestation, and rape occur where no one sees it. If a person says that"
"'I saw that' he becomes an eye witness of that incident. Otherwise, circumstances for"
"an offence to occur, evidence to prove this, or the basis to prove this offence is called"
"circumstantial evidence. That is to say that this offence must be proved through the"
"circumstantial evidence such as early activities and plans made by him, and how he"
"behaved  after  that.  You  have  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  evidence  given  by  these"
"witnesses in respect of this offence are circumstantial evidence.”"
"Page 265 of the appeal brief is as follows;"
"“… As it was stated by the State Counsel, it is considered by circumstantial evidence"
"that an offence is proved ascertaining the alleged involvement of the accused persons"
"by linking the evidence as a chain of causation given before this court by the witnesses."
"If a strong opinion is created in your mind that this offence was committed by these"
"accused persons according to the evidence given, certainly and continuously as a chain"
"of causation, it should be considered as one proved beyond reasonable doubt. If so,"
"you can decide them as guilty. If there are any discontinuance or break in the chain of"
"causation, you have to release them giving them the benefit of doubt.”"
"“Now I wish to explain the law relating to the evidence given by the witnesses in this"
"case. The charge against these two accused persons is that on or about the 16th of"
"October 1985 in Akkaraippattu within the jurisdiction of this court they committed an"
"offence of murder causing death to Razeek, punishable under section 296 read with"
"section 32 of the Penal Code.”"
