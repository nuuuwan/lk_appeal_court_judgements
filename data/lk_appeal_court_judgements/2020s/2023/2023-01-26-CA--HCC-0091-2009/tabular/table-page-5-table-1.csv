"incident is proved we have to think whether that incident occurred beyond reasonable"
"doubt or not, and whether that incident is proved or not.”"
"When  the  learned  trial  Judge  expressed  his  views  and  indicated  “If  they  remained  silent,"
"wouldn't it mean that an offence isn't proved” the Jury must have got the implied message to"
"convict the accused-appellants. It is my view that by using the said words the learned trial"
"Judge has misdirected the Jury. Not only that, further the learned counsel for the 1st accused-"
"appellant specifically mentioned that the principle of Ellenborough Dictum was not properly"
"followed and explained to the Jury in his address, by the learned trial Judge."
"In considering the force and effect of circumstantial evidence, in a trial for murder, the fact"
"that the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused loses a considerable part of"
"its significance if the prosecution has failed to fix the exact time of the death of the deceased."
"When I consider the items of circumstantial evidence led at the present trial, I am of the view"
"that the prosecution had not put forward a strong case against the appellant. The case put"
"forward  by  the  prosecution  against  the  appellant  is  very  weak.  It  is  necessary  to  consider"
"whether prosecution case attracts the dictum of Lord Ellenborough. In Rex vs. Cochmne and"
"others, Lord Ellenborough remarked;"
"""No person accused of a crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct or of"
"circumstances of suspicion which attach to him, but, nevertheless, if he refuses to do"
"so, where a strong prima facie case has been made out, and when it is in his power to"
"offer  evidence,  if  such exist,  in explanation  of  such  suspicious  circumstances  which"
"would show them to be fallacious and explicable consistent with his innocence, it is a"
"reasonable  and  justifiable  conclusion  that  he  refrains  from  doing  so  only  from  the"
"conviction that the evidence so suppressed or not adduced would operate adversely"
"to his interests."""
"In 1938, the Supreme Court of Ceylon in Inspector Arendstz vs. Wilfred Pieris, 10 Ceylon Law"
"Weekly 121 laid down that;"
"“once the prosecution has made out a strong prima facie case, and when it is within"
"his  own  power  to  offer  evidence,  if  such  exist,  in  explanation  of  such  suspicious"
"appearances  which  would  show  them  to  be  fallacious  and  explicable  consistently"
"with his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable conclusion that he refrains from"
"doing so only from the conviction that the evidence so suppressed or not adduced"
"would operate adversely to his interest.”"
"The  thrust  of  this  passage  is  that  the  burden  of  proof  upon  the  prosecution  is  merely  to"
"establish a “Strong Prima Facie case”, and at which point in the proceedings the burden would"
"shift to the defence requiring him to answer that prima facie case established against him."
"Failure to do so would provide the court with proof of his guilt for the offence charged. This"
"passage is quoted with the authority of a secondary source, namely Wills on Circumstantial"
"Evidence  (7th  Edition  at  page  314).  Wills  claimed  that,  the  said  passage  which  the  author"
"quotes from Lord Ellenborough’s judgment in Rex vs Lord Cohrane and Others, could be found"
"at page 479 of Gurney’s Reports."
"Gurney  was  a  scribe  who  was  engaged  by  the  court  to  report  on  the  proceedings.  The"
"complete text of the report expands into just over 600 pages in print and could be found at"
