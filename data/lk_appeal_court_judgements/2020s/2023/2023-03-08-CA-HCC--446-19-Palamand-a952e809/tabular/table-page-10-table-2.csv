"grave. By the time PW 7 finished taking her statement, her condition had been such"
"that  she  was  not  in  a  position  to  sign  the  statement,  and  PW  7  had  to  get  her"
"fingerprint instead."
"Considering the above, it can be considered that the deceased was in serious apprehension"
"of death when making all three declarations."
"In three dying declarations to three different persons, the deceased was consistent that the"
"appellant set fire to her. All three declarations were made voluntarily, and even the defence"
"does not contend that the deceased was attempting to cover up the truth. On the contents"
"of the dying declarations, the only contention of the defence was the discrepancy between"
"the  police  statement  and  evidence  at  the  Retrial  of  PW  2,  on  the  point  of  the  appellant"
"holding the head of the deceased with his legs when setting fire to her."
"This was also included in the dying declaration of the deceased to PW 7, and even if not, the"
"facts of whom and how the crime was committed are clear and consistent across all three"
"declarations. The statement was brief and identified the ""assailant"". They were certainly not"
"the result of tutoring or prompting, as the statements were made within a short period of"
"the  crime,  and  there  was  no  one  to  tutor  or  prompt  her.  None  of  the  witnesses  had  any"
"motive to do so either. As per the evidence of the JMO, as corroborated by the witnesses to"
"whom the dying declarations were made, the deceased was in a fit state of mind at the time"
"of making the declarations. That she requested her  step sister to look after the children is"
"also a factor which supports her clarity of mind at the time in spite of her physical pain."
"The  appellant  can  be  convicted  based  solely  on  the  dying  declarations.  However,  in  the"
"instant case, there is corroborative evidence, especially from PW 1, PW 2, PW 5 and PW 10."
"PW1 confirmed the time and the status of the deceased as she came running for help, and"
"identified  the  appellant  as  the  person  living  with  the  deceased.  PW  2  also  identified  the"
"appellant  and  the  situation  of  the  deceased  at  the  time.  The  evidence  of  PW  10  and  the"
"productions (kerosene can and kerosene lamp) corroborate the declaration of the deceased"
"on how she was burnt."
