"held 
in  his 
judgement  and  also  admitted  by  the  appellant 
in  his  Written  Submission"
"(paragraphs 13 and 14), the statements made by the deceased to PW 1, PW 2 and PW 7 are"
"relevant facts in terms of section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance."
"In the judgement of Shudhakar Vs State of M. P. (2012) 7 SCC 569 which is a case where the"
"accused  husband  poured  kerosene  oil  on  the  deceased  wife  and  set  her  ablaze,  on  dying"
"declarations thus:"
"“The 'dying declaration' is the last statement made by a person at a stage when he is"
"sick  in  serious  apprehension  of  his  death  and  expects  no  chance  of  his  survival.  At"
"such  times,  it  is  expected  that  a  person  will  speak  the  truth  and  only  the  truth."
"Normally  in  such  situations,  the  courts  attach  the  intrinsic  value  of  truthfulness  to"
"such statement. Once such a statement has been made voluntarily, it is reliable and"
"is not an attempt by the deceased to cover up the truth or falsely implicate a person,"
"then the courts can safely rely on such a dying declaration and it can form the basis"
"of  conviction.  Where  the  version  given  by  the  deceased  as  dying  declaration 
is"
"supported  and  corroborated  by other  prosecution  evidence,  there  is  no  reason  for"
"the courts to doubt the truthfulness of such dying declaration.”"
"In the same judgement, the judgement of a similar case Lakhan Vs. State of M. P. Criminal"
"Appeal  No.  2297  of  2009,  where  the  deceased  was  burnt 
  by  pouring  kerosene  oil, 
is"
"referred to;"
"“This  court  has  considered  time  and  again  the  relevance/probative  value  of  dying"
"declarations recorded under different situations and also in cases where more than"
"one dying declaration has been recorded. The law is that if the court is satisfied that"
"the  dying  declaration  is true  and  made  voluntarily  by the deceased,  conviction  can"
"be  based  solely  on  it,  without  any further  corroboration.  It  is  neither  a  rule  of  law"
"nor  of  prudence 
that 
a  dying  declaration 
cannot  be 
relied  upon  without"
"corroboration. When a dying declaration is suspicious, it should not be relied upon"
"without having corroborative evidence.”"
"“The court has to scrutinize the dying declaration carefully and must ensure that the"
"declaration  is  not  the  result  of  tutoring,  prompting  or  imagination.  The  deceased"
"must  be 
in  a  fit  state  of  mind  to  make  the  declaration  and  must 
identify  the"
"assailants.  Merely  because  a  dying  declaration  does  not  contain  the  details  of  the"
"occurrence, it cannot be rejected and in case there is merely a brief statement, it is"
"more reliable for the reason that the shortness of the statement is itself a guarantee"
"of  its  veracity.  If  the  dying  declaration  suffers  from  some  infirmity, it  cannot  alone"
"form the basis of conviction. Where the prosecution version differs from the version"
"given in the dying declaration, the said declaration cannot be acted upon.”"
