"the  University  and  damaged  the  employer  and  employee  relationship  during  his"
"period of probation imposed upon him. The Respondents further contend that the"
"employer is not required by law to adduce any reasons for the discontinuance of a"
"probationer. Therefore, it is claimed that the actions of the Respondents at all times"
"material to this application were strictly within the four corners of the law and the"
"termination  of  the  services  of  the  Petitioner  during  the  probationary  period  is"
"justifiable, equitable, reasonable, was based on good faith and best interest of the"
"University."
"The  appointment  of  the  Petitioner  to  the  post  of  Registrar  and  termination  of"
"services."
"The  Petitioner  has  been  appointed  to  the  post  of  Registrar  of  the  University  of"
"Peradeniya with effect from 24.10.2020 as evidenced by the letter of appointment"
"P2. As per the said letter of appointment above post is permanent and subject to a"
"probation period of one year from the date of assumption of duties. The Petitioner"
"has accepted the appointment in the post of Registrar on the terms and conditions"
"specified therein placing his signature on the P2 and assumed duties in the said post"
"from  26.10.  2020  as  per  the  letter  P2a.  The  services  of  the  Petitioner  have  been"
"terminated with effect from 26.09. 2021 as per the letter of termination P9."

"served in University Administration in different capacities for more than 27 years."
"However,  the  appointment  of  the  Petitioner  to  the  post  of  Registrar 
is  not  a"
"promotional  post  but  a  new  appointment  that  was  made  pursuant  to  the  paper"
"advertisement  dated  28.07.2019(11R19)  published 
in  the  newspaper  and  the"
"University website. In terms of Section 74 of the Universities Act where a person,"
"whose appointment has been confirmed, is subsequently appointed otherwise than"
"by way of a promotion, to another post, his subsequent appointment shall, in the"
"first  instance,  be  for  a  probationary  period  of  one  year,  and  shall  thereafter  be"
"subjected to confirmation by the Governing Authority. As mentioned above in terms"
