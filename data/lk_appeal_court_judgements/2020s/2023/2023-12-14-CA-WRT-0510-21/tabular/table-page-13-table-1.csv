"Accordingly, it is apparent that where it is revealed by a preliminary investigation that"
"there  exists  prima  facie  evidence  that  a  university  employee  has  acted 
in  an"
"improper  manner,  the  Council  of  the  University  should  take  steps  to 
issue  a"
"statement  of  charges,  call  upon  such  employee  to  show  cause  and  conduct  a"
"disciplinary inquiry in respect of such alleged misconduct irrespective of whether he"
"/she is a probationer. Since Section 1:4 of Chapter XXII of the Code does not make a"
"distinction in respect of the applicability of provisions, including said Section 8:2 of"
"Chapter XXII of the Code, to the probationary employees, it is apparent that a charge"
"sheet should be issued in case where a prima facie case of improper conduct of a"
"probationer 
is  revealed  at  the  respective  preliminary 
investigation.  Hence,  the"
"argument of the Respondents that there is no legal requirement to hold a formal"
"disciplinary inquiry for probationers under the provisions of the Establishment Code"
"of the University has no merit. In the instant case, a preliminary investigation was"
"held against the Petitioner and a decision was taken to hold a formal disciplinary"
"inquiry against the Petitioner based on his improper conduct."
