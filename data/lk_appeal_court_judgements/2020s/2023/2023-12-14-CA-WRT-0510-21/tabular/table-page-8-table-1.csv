"letter dated 01.07.2021 marked P8. Nevertheless, no such formal disciplinary inquiry"
"was  held.  As  the  matters  remain  such,  the  Petitioner  was  informed  by  the  Vice"
"Chancellor  by  his 
letter  dated  27.09.2021  marked  P9  that  the  Council  of  the"
"University  at  its  508th  meeting  held  on  26.09.2021  unanimously  decided  not  to"
"confirm the Petitioner in the post of Registrar of the University of Peradeniya and to"
"terminate his services with effect from 26.09.2021. The Petitioner claims that the"
"said  conduct  of  the  Council  to  terminate  his  services  without  holding  a  formal"
"disciplinary inquiry is arbitrary, ultra vires, and contravenes the principle of natural"
"justice. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this"
"Court  and  moves  this  Court  to  issue  Writs  of  Certiorari  against  the  1st  to  28th"
"Respondents quashing their decision to terminate the services of the Petitioner by"

letter  marked  P5  and  Writs  of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st  to  28th"
"Respondents to hold a formal disciplinary inquiry as informed by the letter marked"
"P8 and directing the 1st to 28th Respondents to reinstate and confirm the Petitioner"
"in the post of Registrar."

"The  Respondents  contend  that  after  considering  the  contents  of  the  audit  query"
"bearing No.CLP/KD/J/PU/2020/41 dated 28.12.2020,  the Council of the University"
"appointed  a  committee  to  investigate  the  matter  and  the  Petitioner  was  sent  on"
"compulsory 
leave.  Further,
