"AAT  that  the  Petitioner  failed  to  lodge  an  appeal  within  time  is  erroneous.  By  that"
"Circular permission has been granted till 30.09.2011 to the Government Officers who"
"could  not  prefer  appeals  under  Articles  58(1)  and  155A,  of  the  Constitution  for  the"
"reason  of  the  nun-functioning  of  the  PSC  and  NPC.  The  PSC Circular  No.  04/2011"
"applies to the Government Officers who could not appeal as the NPC and the PSC were"
"defunct.  But  in  the  instant  Writ  Application,  the  appeals  had  been  made  by  the"
"Petitioner  against  the  Disciplinary  Order  to  the  NPC  on  10.12.2007  and  against  the"
"decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to the PSC on 25.09.2011. Therefore, the Circular"
"which should be applied to the Petitioner is Circular No. 03/2012 and not Circular No."
"04/2011. Under the said  circumstances, the Court cannot accept the argument of the"
"learned Counsel for the Petitioner."
"After the Cabinet of Ministers decided to dismiss the appeal, the Petitioner made an"
"appeal to the PSC by annexure A4 requesting to reconsider the decision of the Cabinet."
"The PSC referred that appeal to the NPC and by the letter dated 23.08.2017 marked A5"
"which the Petitioner sought to quash by this Writ Application, the NPC informed the"
"Petitioner that since the Cabinet of Ministers being the appellate authority already had"
"dismissed his appeal, it could not interfere with the decision of the Cabinet. Therefore,"
"it is evident that in A5, no decision has been intimated to the Petitioner taken by the"
"NPC about the appeal referred to it by the PSC other than informing him that it cannot"
"interfere with the decision of the Cabinet. It is important to mention that the appeal of"
"the Petitioner to the AAT which this Writ Application relates  emanates from A5. In"
"addition to that, there is no decision taken by the PSC for the Petitioner to appeal against"
"to the AAT. Under the above-stated circumstances, since the PSC has not taken any"
"decision and the NPC has not intimidated any of its decisions on A5 to the Petitioner,"
"he has no right to prefer an appeal from the PSC to the AAT and the NPC to the AAT"
"respectively."
"Article 61A of the Constitution provides that;"
