"the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 would be limited to a review"
"of the decision of the AAT, and would not extend to quashing decisions of the PSC or"
"of a committee or public official to whom the powers of the PSC have been delegated."

"In  the  case  of  Mohamed  Ismail  Wahabdeen  Vs  His  Lordship  Jayantha  Jayasuriya,"
"Chairman, Judicial Service Commission3, Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J. held as follows;"
"“On a careful perusal of the provisions of the said Article 61A, it is apparent that a"
"wider  spectrum  of  indemnity  has  been  conferred  to  the  PSC  precluding  even  the"
"issuance of prerogative writs against the PSC by the Court of Appeal in as much the"
"said  article  specifically  spell  out  the  words  “no  court  or  tribunal”.  Therefore,  it"
"appears  that  the  legislature  has  made  a  clear  distinction  between  Article  111K  and"
"61A. However, in terms of the said Article 61A, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court"
"under Article 126 (along with the jurisdiction of AAT) has not been precluded. Identical"
"provisions can be seen in Article 155C of the Constitution which deals with immunity"
"in  reference  to  NPC,  which  was  introduced  by  the  same  17th  Amendment  to  the"
"Constitution.”"
