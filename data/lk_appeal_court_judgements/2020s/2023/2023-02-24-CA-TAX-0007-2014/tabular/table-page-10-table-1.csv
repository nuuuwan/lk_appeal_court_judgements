"control the corporate assets24."
"The aforementioned distinction can be extended to joint ventures as well."
"The parent companies are the legal owners of joint ventures. Joint ventures"
"are  established  by 
the  partners  and  may  at  with 
some  degree  of"
"independence. The legal ownership and effective control in joint ventures"
"can be separated. Even in equally owned joint ventures, the management"
"need not be equally shared25."
"In a joint venture, the parent companies contribute not only the capital, but"
"also 
the  non-capital 
resources 
such  as  material,  management,  and"
"technologies.  These  are  normally  stipulated

formal  contracts  and"
"agreements  among  the  partners.  In  addition,  there  are  also  some  other"

"Incorporated  and  Another27  where  consideration  was  given 
to 
the"
"possibility that there could be instances where the holder of more than 50%"
"of  the  shares  does  not  have  control.  Accordingly,  it  was  argued  that"
"shareholding is never looked at in isolation in order to ascertain whether a"
"shareholder  has  a  controlling  interest  and  an  individual  shareholder  can"
