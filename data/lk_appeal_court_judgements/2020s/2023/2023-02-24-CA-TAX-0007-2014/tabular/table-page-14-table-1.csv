"It was submitted that the Appellant is the single largest shareholder having"
"48% of shares and, together with the associate company having 79% of the"
"shareholding. Therefore, it was argued that the other shareholders having"
"only 21% of the shares can never be regarded as the owner of KVC Ltd. It"
"was submitted that even in the ordinary sense it is offensive to the English"
"language to ascribe ownership to anyone else other than the Appellant."
"Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  note  that  no  threshold  shareholding  is"
"prescribed in paragraph (i). Acquiring ownership of the enterprise is the"
"express requirement and no percentage of shareholding is prescribed. As I"
"have already stated above in this judgment, by amendment Act No. 12 of"
"2004, the Legislature removed the term ‘partner or a joint venturer’ from"
"the  existing  definition  of  the  term  acquires  and  added  it  to  clause  (ii),"
"leaving acquiring ownership of the enterprise as an owner in clause (i). The"
"issue  of  ownership  percentage  arises  when  acquiring  ownership  of  an"
"enterprise  as  a  partner  or  joint  venture  partner.  Therefore,  in  my  view,"
"clause (i) applies to a single shareholder company."
"Accordingly,  I  hold  that  the  Appellant  cannot  succeed  its  claim  under"
"clause (i) as well."
"Another argument advanced by the Appellant is that under Section 21 E of"
"the  IR  Act,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  to  approve  the  terms  of  every"
"acquisition  and  therefore,  it  is  the  Ministry  of  Finance  that  decides  the"
"availability of the exemption. It is true that by letter dated 19th June 2006"
"Director General (Fiscal Policy) of the Ministry of Finance and Planning"
"has confirmed that the Appellant, Samson and Sons (Pvt) Ltd has complied"
"with the conditions set out in Section 21 E of the IR Act and consequently"
"qualified for the three years tax holiday. Yet, all that Section 21 E provides"
"is that the rehabilitation of the enterprise has to be done subject to the terms"
"approved by the Ministry and not that the Ministry of Finance has to decide"
"on the availability of the income tax exemption. Therefore, in my view, the"
"Ministry of Finance may have confirmed that the rehabilitation has been"
"done according to the approved terms enabling the party being entitled to"
"claim the exemption but, the decision on the entitlement under the IR Act"
"is a matter to be decided by the Inland Revenue Department."
"In light of the preceding analysis of facts and law relevant to this case I am"
"of the view at the TAC did not err in holding that the Appellant has failed"
"to satisfy the entitlement to the income tax exemption, and therefore, not"
"entitled to the reliefs under Section 21 E of the IR Act."
