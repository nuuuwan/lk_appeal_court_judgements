"challenged  the  above  position35.  Further,  the  Respondent  submitted  that"
"there is no evidence to establish that the Appellant acquired management"
"rights  of  KVC  Ltd.  In  response  the  Appellant  submitted  that  without"
"acquiring management rights, the operations of KVC Ltd could never have"
"been recommenced."
"The TAC was of the view that the Appellant has only 48% shares and the"
"associate  company  has  31%  shares;  as  such,  the  Appellant  has  neither"
"controlling interest nor management rights of KVC Ltd36. The TAC was"
"also of the view that to acquire ownership, the Appellant should have the"
"controlling interest or in the alternative, management rights. The Appellant"
"contended that in determining whether a party has a controlling interest,"
"shareholdings of other shareholders voting together have to be considered."
"Accordingly,  it  was  argued  that  the  TAC  should  have  considered  the"
"shareholding  of  the  Appellant’s  associate  company  as  well.  However,"
"control is not the only test of ownership. Friedman advocates that control"
"is not a  strict and automatic consequence of ownership, but a variety of"
"mechanisms  that  are  available  to  firms  for  exercising  effective  control."
"Control can be exercised by legal forms or influenced through the wide"
"range of resources...37”"
"May be DSI Ltd is an  associate company  of the Appellant. However, it"
"remains a distinct entity. Therefore, to succeed in its claim, the Appellant"
"must establish that the Appellant and its associate company were involved"
"in the joint venture of rehabilitating KVC Ltd as partners. However, there"
"is no evidence such as board resolutions in place to establish this course."
"On  the  other  hand,  no  evidence  was  adduced  to  establish  that  the  joint"
"venture partner provided any other resources. Above all, there is no share"
"certificate in the brief to prove that DSI Ltd owned 31% shares of KVC"
"Ltd.  In  the  case  of  RPC  Plantation  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd.  v."
"Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue38  this  Court  observed  that  a"
"Court dealing with a case stated referred by the TAC will be guided by the"
"facts as reflected in the record before Court, in determining the questions"
"of law before it. Accordingly, the Court must decide the matters at issue"
"based on the available evidence."
