"near that place, he has stopped some distance away, but had continued to scold"
"the deceased. This has angered the deceased and he has picked up two rocks"
"and  had  confronted  the  appellant.  In  the  ensuing  scuffle,  the  appellant  has"
"stabbed the deceased and the deceased also has attacked the appellant with a"
"rock he has picked up from the ground."
"According to PW-03â€™s evidence, the appellant also has received grievous injuries"
"to  his  face  and  had  fainted.  The  deceased  had  been  taken  to  the  hospital"
"subsequently where he was pronounced dead."
"It is the view of this Court that the above facts taken cumulatively establishes"
"that  the  attack  on  the  deceased  by  the  appellant  was  not  a  premeditated"
"intentional act done with the intention of causing the death of the deceased. It"
"sufficiently  proves  that  due  to  the  illegal  activities  of  the  deceased,  which  he"
"carried out in a house claimed by the appellant, the initial provocation was by"
"the deceased, although it may not be a sudden provocation. It is the refusal by"
"the  deceased  to  stop  carrying  out  the  illegal  selling  of  illicit  liquor  that  has"

"It is the view of this Court that due to the cumulative provocation and the events"
"of the given day, and due to the heat of passion, the appellant has committed"
"this act where the deceased received a stab wound, which had been proved fatal."
"The Judicial Medical Officer who has conducted the postmortem has categorized"
"this  injury  as  an  injury  that  could  cause  the  death  in  the  ordinary  course  of"
"nature,  but  not  as  an  injury  that  would  be  essentially  fatal.  The  evidence"
"establishes that the delay in taking the injured deceased to the hospital may also"
"have been a reason for the death of the deceased person due to haemorrhage."
"Under the circumstances, it is my view that convicting the appellant in terms of"
"section 296 of the Penal Code is not warranted. I am of the view that if considered"
"in  the  correct  perspective,  there  was  ample  evidence  before  the  trial  Court  to"
"convict the appellant in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code under exception"
"1  of  section  294.  Accordingly,  I  set  aside  the  conviction  of  the  appellant  and"
