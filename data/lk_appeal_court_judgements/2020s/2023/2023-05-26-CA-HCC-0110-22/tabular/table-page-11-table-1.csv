"In the judgement of Premalal Vs. The Attorney General (2000) 2 SLR 403, it"
"was held,"
"Per Kulatilaka, J.,"
"“Our judgements interpreted the phrase ‘sudden provocation’ to mean that"
"provocation should consist of a single act which occurred immediately before"
"the killing so that there was no time for the anger to cool and the act must"
"have been such that it would have made a reasonable man to react to the"
"manner as the accused did."
"Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where courts have"
"taken  a  more  pragmatic  view  of  the  mitigatory  plea  of  provocation…in  a"
"series  of  cases  court  look  into  the  consideration  of  the  prior  course  of"
"relationship between the accused and his victim.”"
