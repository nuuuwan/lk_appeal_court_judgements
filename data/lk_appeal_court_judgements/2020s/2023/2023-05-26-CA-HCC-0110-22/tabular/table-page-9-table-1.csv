"It is the view of this Court that the appellant can succeed in his argument if there"
"was evidence to establish that the incident falls within exception 1 of section 294"
"of the Penal Code as exhibited before."
"It  clearly  appears  from  the  judgement  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the"
"Counsel who represented the appellant at the trial had, rather than pleading the"
"general exceptions of section 294, has pleaded the special exception as described"
"in  section  89  of  the  Penal  Code,  where  it  has  been  stated  that  nothing  is  an"
"offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence."
"As the wording of the section clearly suggests, if it can be established that an"
"action  of  an  accused  person  was  done  in  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private"
"defence,  there  cannot  be  a  conviction  against  such  a  person,  but  only  an"

"appellant can be considered in terms of the said exceptions."
"It is my considered view that there is a clear distinction between section 89 of"
"the penal code and exceptions mentioned in section 294, which are exceptions"

"person fall within any of the exceptions mentioned in section 294 of the Penal"
"Code, such an accused person cannot be acquitted on the basis of right of private"
"defence,  but  can  only  be  convicted  on  the  basis  of  culpable  homicide  not"
"amounting to murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code."
"It  clearly  appears  from  the  judgement  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"considered the evidence to find that whether there was a basis to conclude that"
"the injury caused to the deceased was an act by the appellant in exercising his"
"right of private defence based on the last confrontation between the two, where"
"the evidence shows that both the stabbing and the deceased hitting the appellant"
"with a rock occurred simultaneous to each other. On the basis that there was no"
