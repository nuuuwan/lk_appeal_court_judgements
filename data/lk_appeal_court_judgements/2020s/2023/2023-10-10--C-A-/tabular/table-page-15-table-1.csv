"12)","The Petitioners were made aware, that the “Marking Scheme for Interview"
"","of  Recruitment  to  Superintendents’  Service  from  Field  Technical  Service"

further  stated 
that  Petitioners  have  not  been 
informed  of 
the"
"","outcome  of  the  said  interview  despite  attempts  by  the  Petitioners  to"
"","ascertain  the  final  results.  Thus,  the  Petitioners  have  also  requested"
"","under Right to Information."
"14)","The  Petitioners  have  become  aware

effect 
in 
law,
