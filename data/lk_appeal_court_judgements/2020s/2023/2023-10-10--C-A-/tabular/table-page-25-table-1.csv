"“There  are  several  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court  where  it"
"has  been  held  that  the  ouster  clause  would  be  of  no  effect  if"
"the  order 
is  made  by  an  officer  who  does  not  have 
legal"
"authority  to  do  so.  In  such  case  the  decision  is  null  and  void"
"and  the  preclusive  clause
