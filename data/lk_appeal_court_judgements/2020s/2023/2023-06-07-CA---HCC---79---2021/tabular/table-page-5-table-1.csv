"The  Counsel  for  the  prosecution  strenuously  argued  that  in  spite  of  all  these"
"infirmities that the story for the prosecution is worthy of acceptance but we are"
"unable to agree with her because we believe that in a criminal case the burden is"
"on  the  prosecution  to  prove  its  case  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  and  not  the"
"accused ."
"The Counsel for the appellant further averred that the history recorded by the"
"doctor is contrary to the findings of his, and we too observe that it is so and we"
"find  that  the  trial  judge  had  narrated  evidence  of  the  prosecution  but  had  not"
"analyzed the same because had he done so he  was bound to have noticed the"
"infirmities mentioned above."
"As such we find the story of the prosecution to be highly improbable and that they"
"had not exercised their duty in proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt."
"As such we set aside the conviction and the sentence of the trial judge and we"
"allow the instant appeal."
