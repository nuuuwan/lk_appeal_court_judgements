"It  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  the  informant  had  not  provided  the  name  or  a"
"detailed  description of the  Accused.  We  also  observe that the  team of  officers  travelled"
"during broad daylight armed with a T-56 gun. Even though there were several houses in"
"the  vicinity,  only  PW1  noticed  the  house  with  an  opened  door  where  the  Accused  was"
"found residing. The explanation provided was that the other house was locked, leaving"

"It is also important to note that PW1 received the information regarding the illicit"
"activities at 11:45 am but only reached the house at 13:00 pm, leaving a notable gap in"
"the timeline."
"Upon  arrival,  the  Accused  was  searched  in  front  of  the  house.  PW1  did  not"
"investigate the house further after recovering the illicit drugs from the Accused, deeming"
"it unnecessary due to the absence of any other occupants. The Accused was arrested at"
"13:15 pm, and after spending 10 to 15 minutes at the location to record the entry in their"
"book, they left the place at 13:30 pm."
"In a significant detail, PW1 stated that he did not open the pink cellophane bag,"
"asserting  that  his  expertise  was  sufficient  to  identify  the  brown  powder  in  the  bag  as"
"heroin. This claim might raise questions about the exact identification process used."
"Further, PW1 indicated that the distance between the place of arrest and the pawn"
"shop  was  1  ½  km.  Since  it  was  a  Sunday,  the  shop  was  closed;  thus,  PW1  had  to"
"communicate with a worker who resided there to open the shop and complete the process"
