"order  was  not  challenged  by  exercising  the  available  remedy  of  revision"
"application.  After three years and four months of issuing the certificate,"
"the petitioner filed this writ application asking to quash both the certificate"
"and the Magistrate Court proceedings. Hence, it is apparent that the time"
"to challenge the certificate has passed. The learned Magistrateâ€™s order has"
"not been challenged by way of a revision application. Now, what remains"
"is only to implement the order of the learned Magistrate."
