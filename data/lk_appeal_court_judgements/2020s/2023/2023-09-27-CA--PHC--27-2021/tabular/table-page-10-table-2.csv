"It  is  settled  law  that  the  mode  of  proof  in  an  inquiry  of  this  nature  is  on  the"
"balance of probability. It is also settled law that there is no strict requirement of"
"how many witnesses should be called to establish a fact before a Court of law."
"Even if only a single witness has given evidence, as in the case under appeal, if"

"in this instance."
"There can be no argument that the words used in the proviso of section 40 (1) of"

"a  strict  interpretation  and  any  claimant  of  a  vehicle  should  prove  that  all"
"precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle being used in the crime was taken"
"by him."
"However, it needs to be noted that what is meant by all precautions stated in the"
"section had not been given an interpretation in the statute itself."
