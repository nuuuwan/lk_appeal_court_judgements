"assessment  was  made.  On  appeal,  CGIR  and  TAC  confirmed 
the"
"assessment."
"The fundamental question of law to be decided in this case is whether the"
"Appellantâ€™s  acquisition  of  shares  of  KVC  Ltd  falls  within  the  scope  of"
"Section 21 E (i) or 21 E (ii)."
"Both 
parties 
agreed 
that 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
judgement 
in"
"CA/Tax/0009/2014 
are 
binding 
on 
cases 
CA/Tax/0007/2014,"
"CA/Tax/0008/20146.  Even 
in 
the  written 
submissions 
filed  by 
the"
"Appellant 
in  CA/Tax/0009/2014, 
the  Appellant 
conceded 
that 
the"
"judgement  in  the  aforementioned  case  would  apply  to  connected  cases"
"since all three cases concern the same issue as to whether the Appellant is"
"entitled to claim the three years tax exemption on profit and income under"
"Section 21 E7."
"At the argument, both parties made a common oral submission in respect"
"of 
the 
three 
cases 
CA/Tax/0007/2014, 
CA/Tax/0008/2014 
and"
"CA/Tax/0009/2014 
and 
relied  on 
the  written 
submission 
filed 
in"
"CA/Tax/0009/2014."
"Statutory provisions"
"In the interest of clarity, I will reproduce Section 21 E of the IR Act which"
"is subject to scrutinization by both parties."
