"Following the case of Jagathsena and others v G.D.P Perera and others [1992], 1"
"S.L.R 375, His Lordship Ranasinghe, J held,"
"â€œThe mere presence of a person in an assembly does not render him a member of"
"an unlawful assembly, unless it is shown that he said or did something or omitted to do"
"something which would make him a member of such unlawful assembly. The prosecution"
"must place evidence pointing to each accused having done or said something from which"
"the inference could be drawn that each entertained the object which is said to be the"
"common object of such assembly. Omnibus evidence must be carefully scrutinized to"
