"material which would enable the Judge to hold that in the ordinary course of nature the"
"injury or injuries caused by a particular accused were sufficient to cause death as opposed"
"to a mere likelihood of causing death. E.g.: Attorney General vs. Somadasa. In this case"
"no single  injury  caused  by  any  single  accused has  created  an  antecedent  probability  of"
"death. According to medical evidence only a combination of injuries no. 3, 7 and 8 inflicted"
"by different accused persons has resulted in probability of death resulting in the normal"
"course of events due to shock and haemorrhage. Therefore the charge of murder should"
"fail, as against all 03 accused persons in respect of their individual acts. As to the mens"
"rea of the accused at the time of the assault there is no conclusive proof whether any one"
"or more of the accused were harbouring an intention to cause the death of the deceased."
"If  they  so  intended  they  could  have  easily  caused  a  necessarily  fatal  injury  to  a  more"
"vulnerable part of the body such at the neck or the heart. Resolving the doubt in favour"
"of  the  Accused  I  hold  that  each  of  the  accused  committed  the  offence  and  inflicted  the"
"respective  injuries  on  the deceased with the knowledge that  he is  likely  by  such  act  to"
"cause  death.  Therefore  the  more  appropriate  finding  is  a  conviction  for  the  offence  of"
"culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of knowledge, punishable under"
"section 297 of the Penal code.‚Äù"
"Therefore we hold that there is no clear evidence to show that the cut injuries"
"inflicted by the 1st Accused resulted in the death of the Deceased."
"Next, we must examine whether an unlawful assembly was indeed constituted by"
"the three Accused with the aim of perpetrating an assault on the Deceased. The onus is"
"on  the  Prosecution  to  demonstrate  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  Accused  were"
"active participants and that they harboured a common object. Mere presence at the scene"
"of the crime is insufficient to sustain a charge."
