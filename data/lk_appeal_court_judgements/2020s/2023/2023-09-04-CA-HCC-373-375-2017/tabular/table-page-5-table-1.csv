"individuals approaching from the direction of Kaddulla. However, only five people entered"
"his  property.  He  was  able  to  identify  four  of  the  five  Accused  by  name.  Notably,  PW1"
"stated that the 2nd Accused was related to PW2, although this detail was conspicuously"
"absent from her witness statement. He observed that the 1st Accused was armed with a"
"sword, while the 3rd Accused had a knife; he could not confirm what weapons, if any, the"
"other Accused carried."
"PW1 heard his daughter-in-law shouting from inside the house. Subsequently, he"
"heard a noise coming from the vicinity of the kitchen. Upon investigation, he found his"
"son's lifeless body near a jack tree, observing that his son's shoulder had been severed."
"The 1st Accused then approached PW1 and swung a sword in his direction, asking, ""ත ෝ"
"ත ොතෙද යන්තන්"" (""Where are you going?""). Stupefied by the events, PW1 was momentarily"
"immobilized.  After  witnessing  the  tragic  scene,  he  immediately  rushed  to  the  police"
"station."
"During his cross-examination, PW1 stated that he returned home from work at"
"6:30 p.m. on the fatal day and sat on the foundation, from where he had a clear view of"
"the well. At that time, PW2 had left for a neighboring house. He claimed not to have seen"
"PW2,  despite  her  statement  in  her  own  cross-examination  that  she  was  also  at  the"
"foundation.  When  questioned  by  the  defense  as  to  whether  he  witnessed  the  entire"
"incident involving the Deceased being attacked, he initially denied it but later changed"
"his answer to confirm that he did. It is noteworthy that this was not the first instance"
"where PW1 went back from his testimony. When further probed by the Counsel for the 3rd"
"Accused about whether the 3rd Accused was carrying a pole, PW1 confirmed, but later he"
"stated that he saw the 3rd Accused had a knife. PW1 further stated that he saw four people"
"holding the Deceased when they emerged from the house. After witnessing this horrifying"
"event, he proceeded to the police station without informing his wife about the incident."
"Counsel for the Accused argued that the Learned Trial Judge erred in law by inadequately"
"analyzing the evidence presented before him, applying the theory of photographic memory"
"to excuse the witnesses' inconsistencies and contradictions. Upon review of the evidence"
"of  PW1  in  the  light  of  the  vital  contradiction  found  in  this  evidence,  we  are  unable  to"
"accept the Learned High Court Judge's view on accepting this evidence."
