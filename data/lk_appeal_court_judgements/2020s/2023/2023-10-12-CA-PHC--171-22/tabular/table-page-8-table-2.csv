"offence."
"Therefore, the present statutory requirement is when the owner of the vehicle is"
"a third party, an order of confiscation shall not be made if such owner proves to"
"the satisfaction of the Court that he or she has taken all precautions to prevent"
"the use of such vehicle for the commission of the offence."
"As  considered  correctly  by  the  learned  Magistrate  as  well  as  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge, the mode of proof shall be in the balance of probabilities."
"However, I am not in a position to agree with the determination of the learned"
"Additional  Magistrate  of  Negombo  that  although  the  registered  owner  gave"
"evidence and justified her actions, she failed to call her brothers and even her"
"husband to substantiate her evidence."
"I must emphasize that a person, not calling any other witnesses to substantiate"
"his or her evidence in itself should not provide a basis to reject the said evidence,"
"as there is no requirement of calling a particular number of witnesses to prove a"
"fact."
"The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus;"
