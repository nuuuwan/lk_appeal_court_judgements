"up  a  legal  objection  to  it.  A  person  who  conducts  himself  in  such  a  manner"
"cannot claim that his delay should be excused."
"In the case of Sudharman De Silva Vs. The Attorney General (1986) 1 SLR 9,"
"it was held that the right of appeal is a statutory right and even a person who"
"absconds the trial has a right to prefer an appeal against the conviction and a"
"sentence in terms of section 14 of the Judicature Act."
"However,  it  was  held  that  in  an  application  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  where  the"
"exercise  of  its  discretion  is  invoked,  contumacious  conduct  on  the  part  of  the"
"appellant  is  a  relevant  consideration  as  in  the  instant  application  before  the"
"Court."
"Be that as it may, when it comes to the facts that had been elicited by way of"
"evidence  before  the  trial  Court  and  the  judgement  pronounced  by  the  learned"
"High Court Judge of Embilipitiya is concerned, I am not in a position to agree"
"with the learned Counsel’s contention that the conviction should have been in"
"terms of section 297 of the Penal Code. I find that the learned High Court Judge"
"has  well  considered  whether  there  was  any  evidence  to  bring  the  charge  of"
"murder down to that of a culpable homicide not amounting to murder. She has"
"found that the petitioner has come looking for the deceased armed with a knife"
"and  had  attacked  the  deceased.  Considering  the  evidence  placed  before  the"
"Court, the learned High Court Judge has determined that this was an intentional"
"act which would not fall under the exceptions of section 294 of the Penal Code."
"The learned High Court Judge has also considered the petitioner’s failure to give"
"a reasonable explanation as to the highly incriminating evidence placed before"
"the Court against him which shows that the offence committed by the petitioner"
"was murder and nothing else."
"Although  the  petitioner  has  stated  right  to  private  defence  as  one  of  his"
"exceptional grounds, there was no material before the trial Court to consider the"
"facts and circumstances in such a manner."
