"approval  of  the  Competent  Authority,  which  is  the  Public  Service  Commission  in  the  instant"
"application is a mandatory requisite for the revision of the age of retirement to be effective."
"The  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  for  the  petitioners  argued  that  the  revision  of  the  age  of"
"retirement  to  63  years  was  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  as  the"
"appointing  authority.  The  age  of  retirement  of the  public  sector  is  a matter  of policy  and  the"
"Cabinet  of  Ministers  is  vested  with  the  power  in  terms  of  Article  55  of  the  Constitution.  The"
"justifications for the revision is entailed in the Cabinet Memorandum dated 17.05.2021, the most"
"compelling reason which precipitated the same was the onset of Covid-19 which demanded an"
"immediate cadre expansion in order to counter the effects of the global pandemic."
"Learned Additional Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that at the"
"time  the  instant  Application  was  filed  the  Petitioners  did  not  have  a  subsisting  legal  right  to"
"compel the Respondents to set the age of retirement at 63 years. No legitimate expectation can"
"arise in view of the many revisions to the compulsory age of retirement and a change of national"
"policy. He further says that the Petitioners cannot compel the Respondents to contravene the"
"law and the Petitioners have not established that a public duty is cast upon the Respondents to"
"revise the age of retirement to 63 years."
"It is important to note that Section 2 (1) of the Public and Judicial Officers (Retirement) Ordinance"
"No. 21 of 1917 confers powers on the Governor-General to make rules for compulsory retirement"
"of public or judicial officers."
"Section 2(1) reads as follows;"
"""The Governor-General may make, and when made may revoke, vary or amend, rules regulating"
"the age at which, the reasons for which, and the conditions subject to which, public or judicial"
"officers shall be required to retire from the public or judicial service."""
"In terms of the Rules promulgated thereunder, the age of compulsory retirement of every public"
"or judicial officer shall be sixty years."
"Rule 1 stipulates as follows;"
"""1. (I) The age of compulsory retirement of every public or judicial officer shall be sixty years:"
"a. Provided, however, that the age of compulsory retirement shall-in the case of Presidents of"
"Rural  Courts  who  are  not  lawyers,  be  fifty-five  years;  in  the  case  of  matrons,  nursing  sisters,"
"nurses and midwives in the Department of Health Services, be fifty years."""
"Rule 1 sub-rule (2) stipulates a proviso which reads as follows;"
"""(2) Notwithstanding anything in paragraphs (1) of this rule, the competent authority may, if the"
"authority considers it expedient, extend the employment of any public officer beyond the age of"
"compulsory retirement if,"
"(a) the Head of the Department in which he is employed considers that his services should be"
"retained in the interests of the service; or"
"(b) where that officer is Head of a Department, the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry to which"
"that Department is attached considers that his services should be retained in the interest of the"
"service."
