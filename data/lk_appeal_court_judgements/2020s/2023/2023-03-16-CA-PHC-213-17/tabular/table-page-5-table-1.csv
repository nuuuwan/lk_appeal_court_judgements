"When perusing the Magistrate Court's case record, the Analyst examined the sample and made his report"
"on  the  5th  day  of  2015.  This  indicates  that  the  report  had  come  to  Court  within  a  short  time.  The"
"prosecution pointed out that the time taken by the Analyst to report back was two months. However, for"
"18 more months, the report was kept away from the 2nd Accused."
"The prosecution argued that the accused was served a copy along with the charge sheet, therefor he was"
"aware  that  the  report  would  be  marked  in  evidence.  If  the  Accused  was  interested,  he  could  have"
"requested from Court to send the remaining sample to the Analyst. When the Appellant had not exercised"
"his right, he cannot now seek relief from this Court."
"To accept the prosecution's argument, they should satisfy that summons contained a copy of the report"
"even though Section 44(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that sending a copy of the Case"
"record  does  not  bear  witness  to  sending  a  copy.  The  amended  charge  sheet  holds  the  names  of  two"
"witnesses and three documents named Idiripathkirima in Sinhalese."
"An argument was formed by the prosecution that it is not late, even now, for the Appellant to request to"
"send a sample. What he should have done on the day he objected to the marking of [P3] was to request"
"from Court to send the other half to an Analyst."
"As pointed out by the Appellant, after a delay of eighteen months, the sample will not hold the evidential"
"value. Iodine will change due to sunlight and other external reasons."
"For centuries, this country's criminal law principles held that let a hundred guilty go free rather than one"
"innocent  person  is  punished.  This  rule  made  judgers  to  be  very  careful  when  the  Court  exercises  its"
"powers in imposing punishments. The verdict should be pronounced not on a balance of probability but"
"beyond a reasonable doubt."
"When a person is handed over the charge sheet and evidence taken on the same day, there is no time to"
"object or request from Court to send a sample to the Analyst."
