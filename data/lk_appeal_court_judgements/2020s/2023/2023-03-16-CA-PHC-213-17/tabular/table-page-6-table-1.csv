"According to the record, the amended charge sheet was read in Court and given to the 2nd Accused (The"
"Appellant) on the 4th of January 2016. On that same day, P.W.1 had given evidence, and the prosecution"
"had sought permission to mark the document as [P3]."
"The prosecution must take all steps to prove its case. Any doubt should be read in favour of the Accused"
"person. The owner of the benefit of the doubt is the Accused person."
"Since the prosecution had failed to prove that a copy of the report was sent along with the charge sheet"
"or that the Accused was given a copy before the 4th of January 2016, the Respondents had not complied"
"with mandatory provisions of the Food Act."
"Therefore, we allow the appeal."
