"Court observes that this argument is substantiated by the Petitioner's own conduct when subsequent"
"to an audit, it sent an amended return disclosing the same. Hence, they argued the Petitioner is"
"guilty  of  willfully  or  fraudulently  failing  to  make  full  and  true  disclosure  of  all  material  facts"
"necessary  to  determine  the  amount  of  tax  payable,  and  accordingly,  they  argued  that  what  is"
"relevant in this instance is Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act, whereby it empowers the Assessor to"
"make an assessment. Irrespective of the time limit stipulated under Section 33 (1). The contention"
"of the Petitioner is the notice of the assessments marked 31-A to 36-H bears the date of issue as"
"26.05.2009. Therefore, they argue even if it is to be construed that what is applicable is section 33"
"(2) still the assessment is time-barred."
