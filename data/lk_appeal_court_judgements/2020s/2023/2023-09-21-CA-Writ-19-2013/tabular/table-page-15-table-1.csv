"and utilized. Hence, we are not inclined to concede to the contention of the Petitioner that the chain"
"of “supply” concludes with the decision to indemnify and not with the payment. In our view, the"
"said contention of the Petitioner seems to have been brought up for the purpose of attracting section"
"7 (1) (c). However, as stated above we wish to disagree with the said submission of the Petitioner."
"It is not disputed that the payments were received in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, we hold that in this"
"instance, once the insurer makes the payment to indemnify the loss only then loss is consumed or"
"utilized. Hence in our view, the loss has been consumed within Sri Lanka. Thus, we are not inclined"
"to accept the argument of the Petitioner that section 7 (1) (c) is attracted in this instance. In our"
"view, in this case, section 7 (1) (c) has no application as the necessary grounds required to invoke"
"the said section does not exist."
"It is also pertinent to note that the legislature in its wisdom has decided to make the “indemnity"
"due” liable for VAT by operation of law. Hence it is considered a supply of services for the purpose"
"of bringing it under section 2 of the Act."
