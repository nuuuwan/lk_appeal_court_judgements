"submitted to the TAC other than the decision, as the complete proceedings before the TAC are not"

"disputing or challenging the decision of the TAC on the basis that the decision of the TAC was"
"made without adequate material before it or has considered matters which was not before it. In our"

"Respondents whether the TAC has come to the decision pertaining to the time bar with the material"
"before it or not, becomes a disputed fact. Especially in view of the fact that the Petitioner has failed"
"to submit the full proceedings before the TAC. The writ court will be reluctant to act on disputed"
"facts."
