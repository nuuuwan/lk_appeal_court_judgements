"refer to the interpretation of “supply of services” under section 83 of the VAT Act. The said Act"
"interprets the supply of services as follows,"
"“
Supply of service” means any supply which is not a supply of goods but includes any loss incurred"
"in a taxable activity for which an indemnity is due”"
"B
oth parties are not at variance and it is clear as per the above interpretation that the “insurance"
"indemnity due” is taxable as it was due for disruption of a taxable activity, that is the supply of"
"electricity. However, the  Petitioner  contends that  the insurance indemnity should be  zero-rated"
"under section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act. This Court also wishes to note that for section 7 (1) (c) to"
"be invoked, the service has to be taxable. Both the Counsels were not at variance that the insurance"
"indemnity due is liable for tax."
"However, the Petitioner’s argument is based on section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act and it is their"
"contention that though it is liable, the amount needs to be zero-rated by operation of law namely"
"under section 7 (1) (c). The said section reads as follows;"
"Section 7 (1) (c) A supply of -"
"(c) any other services, being a service not referred in paragraph (b), provided by any person"
"in Sri Lanka to another person outside of Sri Lanka to be consumed or utilized outside of Sri"
"Lanka shall be zero rated provided that the payment for such services in full has been received"
"in foreign currency from outside Sri Lanka through a bank in Sri Lanka"
"As per section 83 by operation of law, the loss incurred in a taxable activity for which an indemnity"
"is  due is  caught  up as  a  supply of services.  It  is  observed that the Petitioner incurred  a loss in"
"generating  power  when  his  power  plant  caught  fire.  The  petitioner  was  engaged  in  the  taxable"
"activity  of  generating  and  supplying  power.  The  Respondent  argued  that  as  per  the  insurance"
"contract at the relevant time, the indemnity was due to the Petitioner. It is not disputed that the"
"Petitioner was paid by the insurer in foreign currency from outside of Sri Lanka. As submitted by"
"the  Petitioner,  he  has  been  paid  USD  14,755,970  in  respect  of  property  damage  and  USD"
"12"
