"20,515,156  in  respect  of  business  interruption.  The  Petitioner  contends  that  the  said  indemnity"
"amounting  to  the  sum  of  USD  35,271,126  was  paid  in  several  installments  from  June  2004  to"
"August 2006."
"The Petitioner’s contention is that though the loss to the Petitioner occurred in Sri Lanka, to come"
"within the meaning of “supply of services” in the said chain of events, the insurer had to decide"
"whether an indemnity was due or not. His contention is that the decision to indemnify or not was"
"taken  by  the  insurer  in  a  country  that  is  not  Sri  Lanka.  Hence  the  argument  that  though  an"
"indemnity was due, the supply of services as per the definition of the Act had not taken place until"
"the decision was taken to indemnify. The Petitioner’s contention is that said supply of services"
"comes to a conclusion when the decision to indemnify is taken."
"It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner's contention cannot be accepted  as the insurer taking a"
"mere decision is not when the indemnity becomes due. The parties to the insurance contract have"
"come to an agreement to indemnify the loss when the loss occurs.  For that, the insured has paid a"
"premium.  Accordingly,  in  our  view,  the  moment  the  event  that  triggers  the  loss  occurs  the"
"indemnity becomes due as per the agreement. If we are to subscribe to the Petitioner's contention"
"there will be a number of practical difficulties. For example, if the insured makes a decision not to"
"indemnify then as per the contract there will be litigation. In such an event indemnity would not"
"be due till the court case is concluded and a decision taken. Then the question of time bar will be"
"attracted."
"Another ground why we can't accept the Petitioner's argument is that if the indemnity is due only"
"when the insurer makes a decision to indemnify, the resulting position would be that till then there"
"is no indemnity which would be contrary to the entire insurance agreement."
"In response to the above argument of the Petitioner, the Respondent argued that section 7 (1) (c)"
"has no application to the present case before us."
