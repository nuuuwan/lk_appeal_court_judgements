"Conclusion"
"As mentioned earlier in this judgment, we find the Petitionerâ€™s submissions pertain to an appeal"
"rather than attacking the procedure and the process to obtain the relief in a writ application."
"After  hearing  the  lengthy  submissions  of  both  parties  and  after  considering  all  the  documents"
"presented to the Court, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish any ground"
"to  avail  itself  of  the  remedy  afforded  by  the  writ  jurisdiction.  The  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"demonstrate to  this  Court  that the decision of the TAC is ultra vires without  jurisdiction and a"
"nullity."
"Accordingly,  for  the  reasons  stated  above,  we  find  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  challenge  the"
"impugned decisions to the satisfaction of this Court. We see no reason to interfere with the decision"
"of the TAC. Therefore, we are not inclined to grant the relief prayed by the Petitioner. We dismiss"
"this application without cost."
