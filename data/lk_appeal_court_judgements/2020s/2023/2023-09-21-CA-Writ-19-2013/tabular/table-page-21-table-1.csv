"Court also finds that there is no evidence before us as to when the assessment was made pertaining"
"to notice of assessments 36-A to 36-H. While the Respondents submit that the assessments were"
"made  within  the  time,  the  Petitioners  argue  against  it.  Thus,  making  the  date  of  making  the"
"assessment a disputed factor. This matter will be discussed elsewhere in this judgment."
"However, this Court has gone through all the material submitted to the Court and interestingly we"
"find that subsequent to the returns being rejected, an audit has taken place. In the said audit, it has"
"been  found  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  disclose  the  insurance  indemnity  obtained  and  the"
"receipt of interest of late payment from the CEB, which caused the returns to be rejected, and for"
"the Respondents to consider that the Petitioner has failed to make full and true disclosure of all the"
"facts. It is not disputed that this has been conveyed to the Petitioner subsequently."
"Petitioner  argues  that  for  Section  33  (2)  to  operate,  there  should  be  a  willful  nondisclosure."
"Pertaining to this, the Petitioner has cited a number of authorities. We find as per the said section"
"33(2) it is not only the Petitioner’s willful act but even a fraudulent act is sufficient. As argued by"
"the Respondents it is not disputed that the Petitioner has failed to disclose in his original returns,"
"the  receipt  of  indemnity  or  the  late  payment  interest  by  the  CEB.  Subsequent  to  the  audit,  the"
"Petitioner has submitted amended returns which for the first time discloses the insurance indemnity"
"and the late payments, and has requested to accept the amended returns. However, this has occurred"
"subsequent to the audit. If this conduct is not a fraudulent act the petitioner should have explained"
"this  subsequent  conduct  of  requesting  to  accept  the  amended  returns  to  the  court  which  the"
"Petitioner has failed to do."
"The Petitioner also argued that even if the said amounts received as indemnity and late payment"
"interest are subjected to VAT the late payment interest received should be exempted."
"The assessor subsequent to the audit by letter P35 had indicated to the Appellants that the original"
"returns submitted without disclosing the indemnity due and the late payment interest amounts to"
"the appellants’ failure to make a full and true disclosure. The Petitioner’s contention while denying"
"the  said  allegation  is  that  there  was  a  considerable  time  period  that  had  lapsed  and  several"
"communications had been exchanged between the parties before the sending of P35 and therefore"
"it was argued that the sending P35 is an afterthought by the Respondent to activate the application"
"of section 33(2) of the VAT Act."
