"Now I need to advert to the provisions of the said Public Examinations Act, which specifically"
"stipulates that a question paper that is set for any public examination shall, for the purposes"
"of the said Act, be a secret document from the time such paper is set until the lapse of half an"
"hour from the time fixed for the commencement of the answering of such paper by candidates"
"at the relevant examination. Any person who is appointed to set a question paper or a person"
"who is appointed to read answer scripts and assign marks to them is considered an 'examiner'"
"according to the interpretation section of the said Act. In terms of Section 13, if any person,"
"fraudulently  or  dishonestly  communicates  any  information  regarding  the  identity  of  any"
"examiner appointed or to be appointed to set any question paper, or any information relating"
"to the transmission of question papers or answer scripts, to any person who is not a person to"
"whom  he  is  authorized  to communicate  such  information,  he  shall  be  guilty  of  an  offence"
"under this Act. Every person entrusted with any power, duty or function in connection with"
"any public examination should take and subscribe an oath of secrecy. In light of the above, it"

"examinations to maintain a high degree of secrecy therein."

"raised  by  the  Petitioner  highlighting  the  said  errors  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  finality  on  the"
"question as to whether this Review Court could grant any of the reliefs as prayed for in the"
"prayer."
"It is apparent that there is no specific denial by the Respondents to the effect that no errors"
"prevailed at all in the said chemistry paper. On a careful perusal of the report marked 'R7' it"
"implies that several experts after consideration have expressed views on several problematic"
"questions and answers of this chemistry paper. Based on the facts and circumstances of this"
"case, I cannot completely abstain from making any comment to the effect that no erroneous"
"questions were contained in the said chemistry paper. Apart from the alleged errors referred"
"to above, it is pertinent to note that the text in the ‘instructions’ cage on the 1st page of the"
"question paper marked 'P2' declares that the said question paper consists of 9 pages whereas,"
"it consisted of only 8 pages. Even a mistake of this nature would easily create confusion in"
