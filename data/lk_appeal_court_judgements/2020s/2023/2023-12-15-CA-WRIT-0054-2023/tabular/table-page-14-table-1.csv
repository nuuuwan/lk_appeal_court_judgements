(Retirement)  Ordinance  No.11  of  1910,  as  amended"
"(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'Ordinance'), and the rules formulated thereunder.",""
"In terms of section 1 (1) of the Ordinance, the retirement age of every public officer, including",""
"the Petitioners to the present Writ Application, is 60 years of age. It was further argued by the",""
"learned  Counsel  for  the  Added  Respondents  that  by  the  present  Writ  Application  the",""
"petitioners are seeking an Order from this Court to extend the age of their retirement from 60",""
"years to 63 years of age in direct violation of existing law.",""
"When the law states that the compulsory age of retirement of all public officers including the",""
"Petitioners","is  60  years  of  age,  the  Petitioners  cannot  entertain  any  expectation  which"
"contravenes the law and seek to be retired at the age of 63 years. On behalf of the Added",""
"Respondents, it was submitted that, it is trite law that there can be no legitimate expectation",""

"","""Next, as mentioned earlier, the law, as it presently stands, is that an assurance given"
"","ultra vires by a public authority, cannot found a claim of a legitimate expectation based"
"","on that assurance. But it has to be recognised that there may be many instances where"
"","a  petitioner  who  relies  on  an  assurance  given  by  a  public  authority  or  one  of  its"
"","officials, reasonably believed that the public authority or official who gave it to him"
"","was acting lawfully and within their powers. It is also often the case that an individual"
"","who  deals  with  a  public  authority  will  find  it  difficult  to  ascertain  the  extent  of  its"
"","powers  and  those  of  its  officials.  In  such  cases,  much  hardship  will  be  done  to  an"
"","individual who bona fide relies on an assurance given to him by a public authority or"
"","one  of  its  officials  and  is  later  told  the  assurance  he  relied  on  and  acted  upon,"
"","sometime with much effort and at great cost to him, cannot be given effect to because"
"","of  a  flaw  regarding  its  vires.  In  such  instances,  the  principle  of  legality  comes  into"
"","conflict with the principle of certainty and, the law as it stands now, is that the illegality"
"","of the assurance will defeat the value of certainty which contends that the assurance"
"should be given effect.""",""
"At this stage it is important to note that in Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya vs. Sri Lanka Hadabima",""
"Authority, the Supreme Court held;",""
"","""Now I will consider the effect of the said decision of the Cabinet of Ministers with"
"","regard to the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal. As pointed out earlier under Article"
"","42  and  55  of  the  Constitution,  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  are  performing  executive"
"","functions under the Constitution and their decisions can be either policy decisions or"
"","administrative decisions or both. Accordingly, the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers"
"","other than the policy decisions are amenable to judicial review."""
