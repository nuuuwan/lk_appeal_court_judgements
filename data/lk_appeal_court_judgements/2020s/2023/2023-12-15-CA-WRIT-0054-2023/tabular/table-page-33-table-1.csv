"It is Crystal clear that Article 61A removes from the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal a matter"
"in  which  orders  or  decisions  made  by  the  Commission  or  any  Committee  or  officer  who"
"exercises  delegated  power  of  the  Commission.  In  the  present  case,  ex  facie,  there  is  no"
"attempt to impugn any order or decision of the Public Service Commission. It is important to"
"focus only on that point. Thus, the preliminary objection raised by the respondents entirely"
"misconceived."
"Attention  of  this  court  is  drawn  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  who  appears  for  the"
"petitioners that according to the caption the only parties are the Minister and Secretaries of"
"the Health and Public Administration, the other Members of Cabinet, Cabinet Secretary, the"
"Secretary to the President and the Attorney General. The Public Service Commission is not"
"made a party to this case and no reliefs are sought against them. Thus, it is baffling as to how"
"the purported preliminary objection could be taken in this case. Therefore, we decide that the"
"preliminary objections raised by the respondents are misconceived."
"The Writ of Certiorari sought is to quash P 21 and P 35 the underlying decision made therein."
"P 9 is a decision made to compulsorily retire all government officers at 60 years of age. Thus,"
"the preliminary objection is entirely inappropriate to this case and it must fail."
"It 
is  the  contention  of  the  respondents  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  being  the"
"appointing authority of the Petitioners and the nursing service has consequentially granted"
"the approval to fill the vacancies of the Petitioners to this application. If the Petitioners intend"
"to maintain this application, it is paramount to cite the PSC a party to the application."
"I do not agree with the said argument as the petitioners never sought any relief against the"
"PSC. The Public Service Commission and its members are not necessary parties. Accordingly,"
"necessary  parties  are  before  this  Court,  which  is  not  fatal  to  the  maintainability  of  this"
"application."
"Article 55(1) of the Constitution stipulates that the Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and"
"determine  all  matters  of  policy  relating  to  public  officers, 
including  policy  relating  to"
"appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal. In terms of Article"
"55(3)  and  Article  55(5),  the  appointment,  promotion,  transfer,  disciplinary  control,  and"
"dismissal of public officers shall be vested in the Public Service Commission (PSC) subject to"
"the provisions of the Constitution. Learned ASG argued that the PSC shall be responsible and"
"answerable  to  Parliament 
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Standing  Orders  of"
"Parliament for the exercise and discharge of its powers and functions."
"The  petitioners  state  that  ""in  the  said  circumstances  the  policy  decision  of  the  Cabinet  of"
"Ministers  to  reduce  the  compulsory  retirement  age  to  60  (regarding  doctor’s  services)"
"followed  by  document  marked  P9  is.........."".  Hence  they  admit  that  what  is  sought  to  be"
"quashed is a policy decision."
"This is a policy decision outlined by His Excellency the President of the Democratic Socialistic"
"Republic of Sri Lanka in the Interim Budget Speech marked as A 2 annexed to the Statement"
"of Objections. Accordingly, it was proposed to reduce the retirement age of public sector and"
"semi-governmental employees to 60 years. Those who have been employed beyond 60 years"
