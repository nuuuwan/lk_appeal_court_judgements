"It is evident that according to P8[1], all Nurses, all Medical Officers and all Dental Surgeons’"
"retirement age was reported to be at 63. In the aforesaid circumstances it is clear that nurses,"
"medical officers and specialists were treated in the same way. Thereafter by Gazette 2309/04"
"dated  05.12.2022  the  retirement  age  of  all  government  officers  was  reduced  to  60.  The"
"doctors  and  medical  specialists  filed  several  writ  applications  in  this  Court  bearing  No.  CA"
"WRIT  420/2022,  CA  WRIT  421/2022,  CA  WRIT  422/2022,  CA  Writ  473/22  and  CA  WRIT"
"54/2023. Interim orders in the above matters were granted by this Court. The State gave an"
"undertaking that the retirement age of medical specialists and doctors would be 63."
"In the circumstances the petitioners argued that the retirement age of all doctors should be"
"same as retirement age of consultant doctors and medical specialists. In these circumstances"
"the petitioners request that this Court should quash the gazette which sets the retirement age"
"at 60."
"Attention  of  Court 
is  drawn  to  the  following  documents  by  the  petitioners,  which  are"
"uncontroverted:"
"(a) 
Document marked P13 annexed to the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioners."
"(b) 
Document marked P14, as at 31.03.2023 total number of vacancies has increased from"
"2307 to as at 31.12.2022 to 2835."
"(c) 
Document marked  P14  -  several  letters  confirming  the  existing  vacancies  as  at  year"
"2023."
"In  those  circumstances 
it 
is  our  view  that  there 
is  a  grave  shortage  of  doctors 
in  the"
"government sector. In that event the impugned age of retirement is imposed, this problem"
"will be severely exacerbated."
"In any event new entrance to the doctor’s service will not resolve the shortages of doctors"
"caused by the compulsory retirement. In view of the compulsory retirement, most if not all"
"doctors  are  Grade 1  and  Supra  Grade  doctors.  Training  new doctors  cannot  fill  the  void of"
"sudden exclusion of the Grade 1 and Supra Grade medical doctors. The arguments raised by"
"the respondents are illogical, irrational and stands no logic. Therefore, it is important to note"
"that with the compulsory age of retirement at age 60 is implemented in respect of doctor’s"
"service, there will be severe shortage of skilled and senior most doctors in the country. The"
"Respondents have not proposed a solution for the aforesaid."
"According to the Respondents, the age of retirement is set by Rules made under the Public"
"and  Judicial  Officers  (Retirement)  Ordinance.  However,  this  Court  observe  that  the  age  of"
"retirement of public servants is in fact set by the pensions minute and amendments made"
"thereto."
"It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that in law, the Pension Minute is the"
"instrument that fixes and changes the age of retirement. The Respondents now belatedly in"
"these  proceedings  take  the  view  that  the  age  of  retirement  is  set  by  A1-  a  Rule  made  in"
"accordance  with  a  1910  Ordinance  called  the  Public  and  Judicial  Officers  (Retirement)"
"Ordinance."
