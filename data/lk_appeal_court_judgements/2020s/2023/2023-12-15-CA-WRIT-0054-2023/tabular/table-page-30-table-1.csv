"In terms of the aforesaid powers and in terms of the previously mentioned the PSC has granted"
"its approval to fill the vacancies of categories on doctors as it is evinced in documents A 6 (a),"
"A 6 (b), A 6 (c), A 6 (d) and A 6 (e) attached to the Statement of Objections. Therefore, this"
"Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine this application to quash the decision"
"made by the PSC to fill these vacancies either with or without the PSC being made a party to"
"this instant application."
"The said jurisdiction objection is based on the provisions of Article 61 A of the Constitution,"
"which reads as follows;"
"""61 A. Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126, no court or tribunal"
"shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner"
"call in question any order or decision made by the Commission, a Committee, or any"
"public  officer,  in  pursuance  of  any  power  or  duty  conferred  or  imposed  on  such"
"Commission,  or  delegated  to  a  Committee  or  public  officer,  under  this  Chapter  or"
"under any other law""."
"The  learned  ASG  argued  that  this  Application  is  an  indirect  challenge  to  the  said  approval"
"granted by the PSC. It is trite law that, one cannot do something indirectly, which he cannot"
"do directly. The Doctrine of Colourability forbids the Petitioners from doing indirectly, what"
"they  cannot  do  directly.  This  has  been  recognized  in  several  cases  including  the  case  of"
"Bandaranayake vs. Weeraratne 1981 (1) SLR 10 where Samarawickrema J stated as follows;"
"""There is a general rule in the construction of Statutes that what a court or person is"
"prohibited from doing directly, it may not be done indirectly or in circuitous manner."""
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents  submits  that  the  Petitioners'  appointment  and"
"retirement are elements that establish that the Petitioner is seeking to affect a performance"
"which plainly and squarely falls within the purview of the PSC. Therefore, this Application and"
"the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners will be resulted in challenging the said approval of the"
"PSC, for which the Court of Appeal does not have jurisdiction. The Petitioners cannot invoke"
"the writ jurisdiction of this Court in an indirect manner to overcome the constitutional ouster."
"If  the  Petitioners  have  any  grievance,  that  ought  to  have  been  submitted  to  the  Supreme"
"Court. The Respondents say that in these circumstances, the instant Application ought to be"
"dismissed in limine."
"The provisions of Article 140 of the Constitution is very clear that the Court of Appeal is vested"
"with the power to hear Writ Applications subject to the provisions of the Constitution, which"
"reads as follows;"
"""140. Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal shall have full power"
"and authority to inspect and examine the records of any Court of First Instance or tribunal or"
"other  institution  and  grant  and  issue,  according  to  law,  orders  in  the  nature  of  writs  of"
"certiorari, prohibition,  procedendo,  mandamus and  quo  warranto against  the  judge  of  any"
"Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution or any other person""."
"The Article 61A is a Constitutional ouster and only the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to"
"hear and determine the applications which involves any order or decision made by the PSC, a"
