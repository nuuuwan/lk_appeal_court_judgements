"The Respondent’s position in the instant action is that Article 35 of the Constitution"
"which confers constitutional immunity on the President from suit ousts the jurisdiction"
"of this Court. In Karunathilaka and another v. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner"
"of Elections and others8, Fernando J. held that,"
"""I hold that Article 35 only prohibits the institution (or continuation) of legal"
"proceedings against the President while in office; it imposes no bar whatsoever"
"on proceedings (a) against him when he is no longer in office, and (b) other"
"persons  at  any  time.  That  is  a  consequence  of  the  very  nature  of  immunity;"
"immunity is a shield for the doer, not for the act. A very different language is"
"used when it is intended to exclude legal proceedings which seek to impugn"
"the act. Article 35, therefore, neither transforms an unlawful act into a lawful"
"one nor renders it one which shall not be questioned in any Court."""
"In the instant action, the Petitioner has neither challenged the Order of the President nor"
"made him a party to the action. He challenges only the manner in which the Summary"
"Trial proceedings were held and takes up the position that it is ultra vires, against the"
"principles of consistency, contrary to law and the Sri Lanka Navy Order, in violation of"
