"Trial on 01.09.2021 in the event the Petitioner’s appeal to His Excellency the President"
"has  been  transmitted.  On  03.08.2021,  His  Excellency  the  President  approved  the"
"sentence imposed on the Petitioner."
"By way of preliminary objections, the Respondents have raised that the Petitioner is not"
"entitled 
to  maintain

legality  of 
the"
"convictions of courts-martial or Summary Trials. The position of the Respondents is"
"that 
the  conviction,  sentence,  and 
the  decision  of 
the  President  are
