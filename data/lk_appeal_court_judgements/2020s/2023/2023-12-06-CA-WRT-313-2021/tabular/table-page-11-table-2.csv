"CJ  in  Mallikarachchi  vs.  Siva  Pasupathy9  explained  the  rationale  of  the  immunity"
"granted to the President as follows:"
"‘…the President is not above the law. He is a person elected by the people and"
"holds  office  for  a  term  of  six  years.  The  process  of  election  ensures  in  the"
"holder  of  the  office  correct  conduct  and  a  full  sense  of  responsibility  for"
"discharging properly the functions assigned to him. It is, therefore, necessary"
"that  special  immunity  must  be  conferred  on  the  person  holding  such  high"
"executive office from being subject to legal process or legal action and being"
"harassed  by  frivolous  actions.  If  such  immunity  is  not  conferred  only  the"
"prestige, dignity and status of the high office would be adversely affected but"
"the  smooth  and  efficient  working  of  the  Government  of  which  he is  the head"
"would be impeded. That is the rationale for the immunity cover afforded to the"
"President’s actions both official and private.”"
