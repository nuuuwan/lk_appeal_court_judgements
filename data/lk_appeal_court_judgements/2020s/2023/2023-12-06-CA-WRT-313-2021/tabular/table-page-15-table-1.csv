"The first recommendation mentioned as (we') pertains to the offence of consumption of"
"narcotic substances (cannabis) which the Petitioner asserts that he categorically pleaded"
"not  guilty  at  the  Summary  Trial.  The  second  recommendation  mentioned  as  (wE')  is"
"regarding the sale of foreign cigarettes for which the Petitioner had pleaded guilty. The"
"learned President’s Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that since the Petitioner"
"pleaded not guilty to charge ^we'& the burden of proving the charge lay entirely on the"
"prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The position of the Respondents is that there is"
"no such burden of proof on the prosecution owing to the reason that the Petitioner has"
"initially pleaded guilty to both charges. The relevant copy of the Commanding Officer’s"
"Defaulter  Book  marked  as  R-7(a)  and  the  relevant  copy  of  the  Executive  Officer’s"
"Defaulter Book marked as R-7(b) include the two charges against the Petitioner which"
"are recorded as Petitioner had pleaded guilty and found guilty. As per R-7(a), the charge"
"(we') is recorded as to be punished by a warrant and the charge (wE') is to be punished"
"by  admonition.  In  contrast,  the  proceedings  of  the  Summary  Trial  dated  09.03.2021"
"marked as R-6 only contain the charge (we') and as per the said document, the Petitioner"
"has pleaded guilty to the charge (we'). There is neither a record in R-6 that the Petitioner"
"has pleaded guilty to charge (wE') nor to be punished by admonition. At the end of the"
"trial, the Petitioner had moved to submit written submissions. The written submission"
"marked  as  P-4  also  addresses  only  one  charge  but  does  not  elaborate  in  clear  and"
"specific  terms  as  to  what  charge  he  had  pleaded  guilty  to.  According  to  the  written"
"submissions,  it  was  the  first  offence  which  the  Petitioner  had  committed  during  his"
