"powers granted? On an appeal, the question is ‘right or wrong? On review, the"
"question is ‘lawful or unlawful’?”"
"Rights of appeal are always statutory. Judicial Review, on the other hand, is the"
"exercise of the court’s inherent power to determine whether action is lawful or"
"not and to award suitable relief. For this no statutory authority is necessary;"
"the court is simply performing its ordinary functions to enforce the law…"
"Judicial review is thus a fundamental mechanism for keeping public authorities"
"within due bounds and for upholding the rule of law. Instead of substituting its"
"own decision for that of some other body, as happens when on appeal, the court"
"on review is concerned only with the question whether the act or order under"
"attack should be allowed to stand or not.”"
