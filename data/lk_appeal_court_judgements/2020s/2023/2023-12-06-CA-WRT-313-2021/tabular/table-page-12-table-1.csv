"justice  cannot  stand  out.  Wade  and  Forsyth’s,  ‘Administrative  Law’10  is  apposite  to"
"quote in this regard:"
"“It is a cardinal axiom that every power has legal limits. If the Court finds that"
"the power has been exercised oppressively or unreasonably, or if there has been"
"some  procedural  failing…  the  act  may  be  condemned  as  unlawful.  Although"
"lawyers  appearing  for  government  departments  have  often  argued  that  some"
"Act confers unfettered discretion on a minister, they are guilty of constitutional"
"blasphemy. Unfettered discretion cannot exist where the rule of law reigns."
"The same truth can be expressed by saying that all power is capable of abuse"
"and  that  the  power  to  prevent  abuse  is  the  acid  test  of  effective  judicial"
"review.”"
