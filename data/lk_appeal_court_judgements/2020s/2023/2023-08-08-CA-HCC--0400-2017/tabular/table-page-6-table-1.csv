"to beat the victim in the absence of her husband who used to come home"
"once  in  three  months.  Due  to  this  cruel  treatment,  her  life  had  become"
"miserable. According to the victim the ill-treatment had started after about"
"two  years  of  her  coming  to  the  Appellant’s  house.  Further  she  had  been"
"threatened not to reveal it to anybody."
"As the 1st Accused and the Appellant were acquitted from 1st and 2nd charges"
"respectively in the indictment, the evidence pertains to 1st and 2nd charges"
"will not be considered in this appeal."
"PW2, the mother of the victim corroborated the evidence given by the victim"
"how she went to Appellant’s house and returned. She further said when the"
"victim was brought back home by the Appellant’s husband, she had noticed"
"injuries all over the victim’s body. Due to injuries sustained on her face, she"
"could not even identify the victim properly. Further, hearing her cries, her"
"brother,  PW3  had  come  there  and  after  seeing  the  victim’s  appearance  he"
"had  punched  the  Appellant’s  husband’s  face.  As  the  Appellant’s  husband"
"sustained injuries on his lip, he had run away from the scene after leaving"
"the victim. Due to fear of police, she had first taken the victim to the hospital."
"While corroborating the evidence of PW2, PW3 had further said that he had"
"noticed injuries on victim’s body when he went to victim’s house hearing the"
"cries of PW2."
"PW4, the Doctor who had examined the victim had given very comprehensive"
"evidence under three categories of injuries noted on the victim’s body. As he"
"had  noted  number  of  injuries  on  her  body,  he  had  not  counted  their"
"numbers. Blunt weapon injuries had been noted all over victim’s body. The"
"second category blunt injuries had been noted on front chest and face of the"
"victim. The third category sharp weapon injures had been noted on back of"
"the  chest  of  the  victim.  He  could  not  express  an  opinion  about  the  age  of"
"injuries,  but  he  was  certain  that  the  injuries  could  have  been  inflicted  at"
"least two weeks before the examination. In the history given to the doctor,"
