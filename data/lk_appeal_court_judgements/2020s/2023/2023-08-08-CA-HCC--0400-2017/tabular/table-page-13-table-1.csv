"Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  very  extensively  considered  the  evidence"
"adduced by the defence. The Appellant had given evidence from the witness"
"box and was subjected to cross examination. She had vehemently denied the"
"charge in her evidence. Further,  the defence had called two witnesses but"
"that evidence too failed to create a doubt on the prosecution case."
"Hence, this ground also has no merit."
"In this case, the victim was under the vicious clutches of the Appellant. She"
"had fallen victim to ill-treatment as she was taken to Appellant’s house by"
"her husband. She had suffered both physically and mentally until she was"
"taken  back  home.  She  was  15  years  old  when  she  started  living  with  the"
"Appellant and her ordeal continued until she was taken back home."
"In this case when the victim gave evidence on 04.03.2014, she was 29 years"
"and married to a differently abled person and blessed with two children. Her"
"husband does not have a permanent job nor she employed either. The family"
"is living in a hut. The victim is 38 years old now."
"The Appellant was 48 years old when she gave evidence on 28.03.2017 and"
"she  is  54  years  old  now.  The  date  of  offence  was  between  03.09.1999  to"
"25.10.1999.  Nearly  23  years  passed  after  the  offence  being  committed."
"Hence, sending the Appellant to jail will not serve any purpose considering"
"all the circumstances of the case."
"Although minimum mandatory sentence of 2 years has been stipulated for"
"the offence committed under Section 308(A)(2) of the Penal Code as amended,"
"considering the circumstances mentioned above I  decided to  replace the  2"
