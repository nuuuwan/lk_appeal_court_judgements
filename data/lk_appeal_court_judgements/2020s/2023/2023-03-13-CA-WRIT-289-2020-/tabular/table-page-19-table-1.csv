"Respondent  authorities  which  gives  rise  to  such  an  expectation.  In  the  instant  case,"
"factors such as them being paid the same as permanent employees or assigned duties in"
"the Water Board as done for permanent employees have not crystallised into the standard"
"expected  by  law  for  the  expectation  to  be  legally  protected,  in  the  absence  of  a  clear"
"promise or practice. Their contracts of employment made it clear that they were hired on"
"a temporary basis for the duration of their contract."
"Further,  the  Respondent  Board  notes  that  the  Petitioners  have  been  recruited"
"after  the  completion  of  a  project  to  other  projects  for  the  duration  of  those  projects."
"However,  it  maintains  the  position  that  the  Petitioners  were  always  employed  on  a"
"contract basis. This is not uncommon or a strange occurrence. Firstly, the term “project”"
"itself denotes a collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular"
"aim. This means one cannot expect a project to continue in perpetuity.  (In terms of the"
"Management Services Circular No 01/2019 (“1R8”), issued by the Ministry of Finance, a"
"project  was  defined  as  “a  planned  set  of  interrelated  tasks  to  be  executed  over  a  fixed"
"period  of  time  and  within  certain  costs  and  other  limitations  to  achieve  a  particular"
"objective/s”. Secondly, hiring employees on a contractual basis for various projects is well"
"within reason. If a person is hired for a particular project, and such person’s performance"
"is satisfactory to the employer, the employer would prefer to keep such person until the"
"life  of  that  project  terminates,  and  if  there  are  opportunities  where  such  employee’s"
"services can be made use of in another project, any prudent employer would prefer that"
"employee for the job. In a scenario where the employee, such as in the present case, has"
"served the relevant authority during the life of a project and seen it to completion, we do"
"not think it is reasonable for the employee to compel the employer to hire the employee"
"for  some  other  project  if  there  are  no  projects  or  if  there  are  no  vacancies  in  ongoing"
"projects. Perhaps, there may be a moral obligation that a generous employer may render"
"in the form of an ex gratia payment or finding employment for the hard-working employee"
"elsewhere, but that would be at the discretion of each employer, and that remains purely"
"a moral consideration; that is a matter of conscience rather than a legal obligation."
"In the latter circumstance in which the Petitioners claim a legitimate expectation"
"has  arisen  (i.e.  their  apparent  treatment  as  permanent  employees),  if  what  had  been"
"sought was fulfilment of an expectation of being considered in the pool of candidates for"
"the  new  recruitment  or  merely  to  be  interviewed,  instead  of  the  expectation  of  being"
"recruited itself, the unenviable judicial task of balancing competing interests would have"
"been easier to perform and the scales may have tilted in favour of the Petitioners."
