"Hettiarachchi and Chanima Wijebandara v. Sunil Hettiarachchi SC FR 228/2018 and SC"
"FR  229/2018  SCM  18.06.2020  as  examples.  In  this  regard,  the  fundamental  rights"
"jurisdiction is not trammelled by the criteria for the issuance of mandamus; there is no"
"necessity  therefore  to  demonstrate  a  right  and  a  corresponding  duty,  unlike  the  writ"
"jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution, when granting a"
"writ of mandamus. It is then a distinction that must be borne in mind when analysing the"
"legitimate  expectations  jurisprudence  since  it  is  a  distinction  that  is  capable  of  being"
"overlooked."
"Most  recently,  her  Ladyship  Murdu  Fernando  P.C.  J.  recognised  this  subtle"
"distinction in Dayanthi Dias Kaluarachchi v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation SC Appeal"
"43/2013 SCM 19.06.2019 :"
"“I  re-iterate  the  observations  of  JAN  de  Silva  J.,  quoted  above  that  the  foundation  of"
"mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not grant a writ of mandamus to enforce"
"a  right  which  is  not  legal  and  not  based  upon  a  public  duty.  Judicial  intervention  based  upon"
"legitimate  expectation  should  not  be  used  as  a  tool  for  enforcing  a  right  purely  of  an  equitable"
"nature.”"
"The question we are grappling with is whether the criterion of mandamus should"
"be  sacrificed  on  the  altar  of legitimate  expectations.  Whether  a  legitimate  expectation,"
"such as in the present case, can be enforced through a writ of mandamus is doubtful. This"
"is an issue that merits further consideration."
