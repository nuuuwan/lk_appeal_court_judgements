"Despite the finding of a legitimate expectation, that expectation in order to be legally"
"enforceable must withstand any countervailing consideration that is thrown at it."
"It  must  also  be  noted  that  subsequent  to  these  Circulars,  recruitment  and  filling"
"vacancies was regulated by Circulars of the Ministry of Finance such as DMS/Cir/2020"
"dated 21st February 2020 (“1R4”), which is alluded to in DMS/Cir/2020 dated 26th October"
"2020 (“1R5”)."
"Nonetheless, we are of the view that the standard of protection this expectation would"
"garner is that of the first standard set out in the aforesaid Coughlan test. That is, these"
"expectations would only amount to a mandatory relevant consideration on the part of the"
"authorities. There is evidence to suggest that the authorities had considered it, as set out"
"in paragraph 16 of their statement of objections. Although, the circulars were issued in"
"2014  and  2019, and  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Treasury,  given  the  present  economic"
"predicament  of  the  country  we  cannot,  regrettably,  in  the  absence  of  any  material"
"demonstrating the continuity of the Treasury’s concurrence, insist the implementation of"
"the  circulars.  This  is  also  due  to  the  subsequent  circulars  that  have  suspended  and/or"
"regulated recruitment to the public service."
"We are of the view that it is a vital consideration that we cannot ignore and that it"
"deals with a polycentric question involving finite resources. It is with situations such as"
"the  present  in  mind  that  Lord  Laws  observed  in  R  v.  Department  of  Education  and"
"Employment, ex p Begbie [2000] 1 WLR 1115, that the first and third categories are not"
"“hermetically  sealed”.  We  cannot,  as  the  learned  Judge  said,  don  the  garb  of  a  policy"
"maker. His Lordship Arjuna Obeyesekere J. in Captain (Temporary) H.D.C. Perera v. Lt."
"Gen N.U.M.M.W. Senanayake & Ors (supra) observed:"
"“This is especially so in relation to the first and third categories, where a policy decision,"
"as stated in the first category may have the effect of depriving a previously promised substantial"
"benefit, as envisaged by the third category.”"
"In  addition,  the  Petitioners  contend  that  by  the  conduct  of  the  Respondent"
"authorities,  such  as  by  treating  them  as  similar  to  permanent  employees,  whenever  a"
"project came to an end, assigning them to a new project would give rise to a legitimate"
"expectation that they would be made permanent. However, we are unable to agree with"
"this  contention  since  in  these  circumstances  we  are  not  satisfied  that  a  legitimate"
"expectation  can  be  generated.  As  noted above,  there  must be a  clear,  unequivocal, and"
"unambiguous  representation  from  the  relevant  authority,  in  this  case,  the  relevant"
