"","Secondly, if an expectation is deemed to be legitimate there are three approaches,"

"whether the expectation was only a mandatory relevant consideration. If the expectation",""

"considered at all as a relevant consideration, and if it has not been so considered at all,",""
"quash the decision to resile from the expectation for want of taking into account a relevant",""
"consideration. If the expectation has been considered, but if it appears to Court that the",""
"failure to enforce the expectation, in the circumstances of the case, was so unreasonable",""
"(in the Wednesbury unreasonable sense) the decision to resile from the expectation can",""
"be quashed. The second, exclusively dealing with procedural legitimate expectations, the",""
"Court would require that represented process be carried out, provided the expectation is",""
"not  outweighed  by  an  overriding  reason.  Third,  dealing  exclusively  with  substantive",""
"legitimate  expectations,  the  Court  must  determine  whether  the","frustration  of  the"
"expectation was so unfair that it was tantamount to an abuse of power. Inherent in this",""
"approach as well is the task of weighing the claimant’s expectation against the overriding",""
"reason submitted by the authority for its change in direction. These three approaches as",""
"described in the case of Coughlan (supra) are thus:",""
"","“(a)  The  court  may  decide that  the  public  authority  is  only required to  bear  in  mind its"
"previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight, it thinks right, but no more, before",""
"deciding  whether  to  change  course.  Here  the  court  is  confined  to  reviewing  the  decision  on",""
"Wednesbury grounds.",""
"","(b) the court may decide that the promise or practice induces a legitimate expectation of,"
"for example, being consulted before a particular decision is taken. Here it is uncontentious that the",""
"court itself will require the opportunity for consultation to be given unless there is an overriding",""
"reason  to  resile  from  it.  In  which  case  the  court  will  itself  judge  the  adequacy  of  the  reason",""
"advanced for the change of policy, taking into account what fairness requires.",""
"","(c) Where the court considers that a lawful promise or practice has induced a legitimate"
"expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural, authority now establishes that",""
"here too the court will in a proper case decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that",""
"to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power. Here, once the legitimacy of",""
"the expectation is established, the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness",""
"against any overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy.” [emphasis added]",""
