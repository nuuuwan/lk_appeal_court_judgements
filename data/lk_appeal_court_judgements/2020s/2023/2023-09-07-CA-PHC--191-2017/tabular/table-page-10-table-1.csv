"Ramanathan Chettiar v. Wickramarachchi and Others [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 395]"
"emphasises this in the following manner:"
"The doctrine of stare decisis is no doubt an indispensable foundation upon"
"which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It"
"provides at least some degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in"
"t
he conduct of their affairs as well as a basis for orderly development of legal"
"rules. Certainty in the law is no doubt very desirable because there is always"
"t
he danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts,"
"settlements of property and fiscal arrangements have been entered into."
"Further there is also the especial need for certainty as to the criminal law."
"While the greatest weight must be given to these considerations, certainty"
"must not be achieved by perpetuating error or by insulating the law against"
"t
he currents of social change. When the precedent is plainly and admittedly"
"wrong, the obligation to follow ceases because then the judge has a greater"
"obligation to preserve the rule of law."
"There cannot be any difficulty in understanding the underlying rationale: in"
"order to be a binding precedent, the judgment must be according to the law.‚Äù"
