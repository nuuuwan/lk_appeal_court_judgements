"“…  In  principle,  there  ought  to  be  no  categorical  rule  requiring  the  exhaustion  of"
"administrative remedies before judicial review can be granted. A vital aspect of the rule"
"of law is that illegal administrative action can be challenged in court as soon as it is"
"taken  or  threatened.  There  should  be  no  need  first  to  pursue  any  administrative"
"procedure or appeal in order to see whether the action will in the end be taken or not."
"An administrative appeal on the merits of the case is something quite different from a"
"judicial determination of the legality of the whole matter. This is merely to restate the"
"essential difference between review and appeal, which has already been emphasized."
"The only qualification is that there may occasionally be special reasons which induce"
"the court to withhold discretionary remedies where the more suitable procedure is an"
"appeal, for example, whereas an appeal is already in progress,' or the object is to raise"
"a test case on a point of law… (at page 600)."
"… In the past three decades, case law has produced a crop of judicial statements which"
"conflict with the principle just explained. It has been said  that, where there is  some"
"right  of  appeal,  judicial  review  will  not  be  granted  'save  in  the  most  exceptional"
"circumstances';  and  that  the  normal  rule  is  that  the  applicant'  should  first  exhaust"
"whatever other rights he has by way of an appeal'. A decision of the Court of Appeal"
"goes  further  and  suggests  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  point  of  law,  the  existence  of"
"alternative  dispute  mechanisms  or  statutory  complaint  procedures  is  sufficient  to"
"preclude judicial review. These propositions have been prompted by the rapid growth"
"of  applications  for  judicial  review  and  a  judicial  desire  to  limit  them.  The  Law"
"Commission also supports them and favours a general rule requiring the exhaustion of"
"alternative remedies before judicial review is allowed…” (at page 602)"
