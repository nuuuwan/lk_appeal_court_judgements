"occupation on the happening of some event as a necessary consequence... It was not"
"meant  to  obtain  possession  of  a  land  which  the  State  has  lost  possession  of  by"
"encroachment or ouster for a considerable period of time by ejecting a person in such"
"possession."""
"Section  3  of  the Act,  before  the Amendment  No.29  of  1983  was  brought  in  was  as"
"follows;"
"“Where  a  competent  authority  is  of  the  opinion  that  any  person  is  in  unauthorized"
"possession or occupation of any State land the competent authority may serve a notice"
"on such person in possession or occupation thereof, … requiring such person to vacate"
"such land … and to deliver vacant possession of such land to such competent authority"
"or other authorized person as may be specified in the notice on or before a specified"
"date.” (emphasis added). After the decision of Senanayake vs. Damunupola (supra), by"
"the Amendment, section 3 of the main Act was repealed as follows;"
"""Where a competent authority is of the opinion"
"(a) that any land is State land; and"
"(b)  that  any  person  is  in  unauthorized  possession  or  occupation  of  such  land,  the"
"competent authority may serve a  notice on such person  in  possession  or occupation"
"thereof,  …  requiring  such  person  to  vacate  such  land  …  and  to  deliver  vacant"
"possession of such land to the such competent authority or other authorized person as"
"may be specified in the notice on or before a specified date”. (emphasis added)."
"Therefore, it is clear that after the Amendment, if the opinion of the competent authority"
"is  that the land in  question is  State land the competent authority could  take steps to"
"recover the possession of the land in terms of the Act. Therefore, the Court refuse to"
"accept the said argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners."
