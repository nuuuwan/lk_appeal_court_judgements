"case decided based on an application for a writ, a similar remedy granted upon"
"discretion of the Court, it was held:"
"“A  Writ  of  Certiorari  is  issued  at  the  discretion  of  the  Court.  It  cannot  be"
"held be a writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. The exercise of"
"this  discretion  by  Court  is  governed  by  certain  well  accepted  principles."
"The Court is bound to issue it  at the instance of a party aggrieved by the"
"order of an inferior tribunal except in case where he has disentitled himself"
"to  the  discretionary  relief  by  reason  of  his  own  conduct,  submitting  to"
"jurisdiction, 
laches,  undue  delay  or  waiver…  The  proposition  that  the"
"application of writ must be sought as soon as injury is caused is merely an"
"application  of  the  equitable  doctrine  that  delay  defeats  equity  and  longer"
"the  injured  person  sleeps  over  his  rights  without  any  reasonable  excuse"
"the chance of his success in writ application dwindles and the Court may"
"reject  a  writ  application  on 
the  ground  of  unexplained  delay…  An"
"application  for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  should  be  filed  within  a  reasonable"
"time.”"
