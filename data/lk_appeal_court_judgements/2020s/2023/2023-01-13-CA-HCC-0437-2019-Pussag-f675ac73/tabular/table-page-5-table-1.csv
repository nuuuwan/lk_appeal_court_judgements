"","trial  Judge  has  violated 
the  provisions  enumerated 
in"
"","section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Section"
"","203  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  provides  that,"
"","after  the  cases  for  the  prosecution  and  the  defence  are"
"","closed,  the  Judge  shall  forthwith  or  within  10  days  of  the"
"","conclusion of the trial, record the verdict."
"8.","This provision was discussed at length and was interpreted"
"","in  case  of  Sinha  Rathnathunga  v.  The  State  [2001]  2"
"","SLR 173 it was held that, the provisions of section 203 of"
"","the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  are  directory  and  not"
"","mandatory. In the instant case, after the conclusion of the"
"","evidence for  the prosecution  and  defence,  the learned  trial"
"","Judge who heard the evidence was elevated to the Court of"
"","Appeal.  Thereafter,  the  learned  trial  Judge  who  succeeded"
"","him  has  decided  to  record  further  final  submissions  from"
"","both parties without any objections from either party. It is"
"","pertinent 
to  note 
that,  even 
the  defence  Counsel  who"
"","appeared 
for

has  moved 
for

"","Judge  who  has  delivered 
the 
judgment 
to  deliver 
the"
"","judgment,  no  application  has  been  made  by  any  of  the"
"","parties  or  more  specifically  by  the  defence,  to  even  recall"
"","any of the witnesses for cross examination. I am mindful of"
"","the fact that taking nearly 12 months to deliver a judgment"
"","is  undesirable.  However,  in  this  instance,  neither  has  it"
"","caused  any  prejudice  to  the  appellant  nor  has  it  caused"
"","any  failure  of  justice.  Hence,  this  ground  of  appeal  also"

"","Counsel 
for  the  appellant, 
I 
find  that  the 
learned  trial"
"","Judgeâ€™s  analysis  of  the  evidence  has  been  very  brief  and"
"","insufficient.  The  learned  trial  Judge  has  summarised  the"
"","evidence from page 1-16 of his  judgment (page 436-451 of"
