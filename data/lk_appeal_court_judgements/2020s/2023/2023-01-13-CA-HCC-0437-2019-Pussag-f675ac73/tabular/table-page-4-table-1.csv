"","parking  the  vehicle,  they  came 
to  the  Thalawathugoda"
"","junction  and  stationed  themselves  at  the  bus  stop,  about"
"","25 meters away from the junction. Hence, I do not find any"
"","material  contradiction 
regarding 
the  place  where 
they"
"","conducted  the  raid,  in  a  way  that  affects  the  credibility  of"
"","the  two  witnesses.  Therefore,  I  find  that  this  ground  of"
"","appeal has no merit."
"5.","Ground of appeal no. 2"
"","The 
learned  Counsel 
for 
the  appellant  submitted 
that,"
"","although the raid was conducted on 31.05.2011, the parcel"
"","of heroin that was alleged to have been in the possession of"
"","the  appellant  was  handed  over 
to 
IP  Rajakaruna  on"
"","02.06.2011.  The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  for  the"
"","appellant  submitted  that,  as  it  was  the  weekend,  the  PW1"
"","has  sealed  the  parcel containing  heroin and  has  kept  it in"
"","his personal locker before handing it over to IP Rajakaruna,"
"","who was in charge of productions at the narcotics bureau."
"6.","According  to  the  evidence  of  the  PW1,  after  sealing  the"
"","productions, he has kept it within his safety locker until it"
"","was handed over to IP Rajakaruna. Although he was cross"
"","examined  at  length,  he  was  never  questioned  about  any"
"","tampering  done  or  even  with  regard  to  the  possibility  of"
"","tampering  with 
the  heroin  parcel  while 
it  was 
in  his"
"","custody.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that,  when  the"
"","PW1  was 
cross 
examined, 
the  defence  Counsel  has"
"","suggested  to  the  PW1  that  the  heroin  parcel  was  found"
"","inside  the  roof  of  the  house  they  checked  at  Pannipitiya,"
"","which  the  witness  denied.  The  prosecution  has  clearly  led"
"","evidence  on  the  inward  journey  of  the  production,  which"
"","was  not  challenged  by  the  defence.  Hence,  this  ground"
"","should necessarily fail."
"7.","Ground of Appeal No. 3"
"","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that,  the"
"","learned  trial  Judge  has  taken  about  one  year  after  the"
"","conclusion of the trial, to deliver his judgment. Therefore, it"
"","is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  that,  the  learned"
