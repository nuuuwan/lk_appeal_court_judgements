"[1990]  1  SLR  280  it  was  held  that,  the  proviso  to  section"
"334(1)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  procedure  Act  clearly  vests"
"the discretion in the court to decide on the matter in terms"
"of  the  evidence  adduced 
in  the  trial  court. 
In 
‘Mannar"

it 
is  sufficient 
for 
the  accused

"However,  it  was  held  that,  a  reasonable  jury  if  properly"

"The appellant, in his unsworn statement from the dock has"
"said  that  he  was  arrested,  taken  to  a  rubber  plantation,"
"assaulted  and  was
