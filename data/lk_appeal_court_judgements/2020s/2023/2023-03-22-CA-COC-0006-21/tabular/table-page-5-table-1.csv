"the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall"
"each  be  a  superior  court  of  record  and  shall  have  all  the  powers  of  such  court"
"including the power to punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the court"
"itself or elsewhere,  with imprisonment or fine or both  as  the court  may deem fit."
"The power of the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of"
"any other court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph (1)(c) of this Article,"
"whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere: Provided that  the"
"preceding provisions of  this Article shall not prejudice or affect  the rights now or"
"hereafter vested by any law in such other court, tribunal or institution to punish for"
"(Emphasis  added)  Thus,  the  Court  of  Appeal 
is  clearly 
contempt  of 
itself.”"
"conferred the jurisdiction to entertain contempt of court committed at any other"
"court. However, in a matter as the one at hand, where determining the contempt"
"of  court largely depends  on  findings, perusal and examinations at lower  Court"
"trial,  it  is  plausibly  more  appropriate  for  such  a  forum  to  determine  on  the"
"contempt of court matter as well."
"This  position  was  comprehensively  analysed  in  the  case  of  Meththanda  vs"
"Kushan Fernando   (2006) 1 Sri LR 290 , where the Court of Appeal resorted to"
"Section 55 (1) of the Judicature Act, proviso of section 105 (3) read with 183B of"
"Civil  Procedure  Code  and  stated  that  the  inherent  jurisdiction  on  contempt  of"
"court of superior courts shall not prejudice the specific jurisdiction conferred to"
"lower courts by above mentioned provisions when dealing with contempt of court"
"by 
falsified  affidavits.  Section  55 
(1)  of 
the  Judicature  Act  has  endowed"
"jurisdiction  on  contempt  of  Court  to  lower  courts  where  it  states  that  “every"
"District Court, Small Claims Court and Magistrates’ Court shall, for the purpose of"
"maintaining its proper authority and efficiency, have a special jurisdiction to take"
"cognizance  of,  and  to  punish  with  the  penalties  in  that  behalf  as  hereinafter"
"provided, every offence of contempt of court committed in the presence of the court"
"itself and all offences which are committed in the course of any act or proceeding"
"in  the  said  courts  respectively,  and  which  are  declared  by  any  law  for  the  time"
"being in force to be punishable as contempt of court (Emphasis added). Therefore,"
"for the purpose of maintaining proper authority and efficiency any contempt of"
"court  committed  at  lower  court  proceedings  shall  be  entertained  by  the  such"
"court."
