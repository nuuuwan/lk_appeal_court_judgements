"are February 2004, March 2004, April 2004, May 2004, June 2004, August 2004, October 2004,"
"and November 2004. There were 3 questions that were considered by the TAC namely,"
"•  Whether the 8 assessments made were time-barred,"
"•  Whether the total proceeds of the insurance claim received amounting to USD 35,271,126"
"could  be  taxed  under  2004/2005  at  the  rate  of  15%  or  the  total  loss  for  which  the  said"
"compensation payment was received, should be considered as zero-rated supply, and,"
"•  Whether  the  delay  charges  collected  at  Rs.  50,893,989  could  be  assessed  as  a  taxable"
"supply or is it to be considered exempt from VAT."
"The TAC has given due consideration pertaining to the time bar raised on the assessments. The"
"decision of the TAC states as follows; ‘the representative of the Appellant in his written submission"
"dated 18.03.2012 has stated the date of all notices of assessment as 26.05.2009 and the date of"
"their receipt by the Appellant on 29.06.2009. However, the representative of the Appellant has not"
"furnished any documentary proof to  support those dates  mentioned in the written submissions,"
"which are quite different from the dates as stated by the respondent."
"The date of signing the eight notices of assessment was 22.12.2008 and the date of serving those"
"notices of assessments was 19.01.2009, as submitted by the Respondent. On this basis, all eight"
"assessments have been made within a period of 5 years from the end of the respective tax period,"
"for the purpose of the section 33 of the VAT Act”"
"This Court observes that the TAC has considered the said grounds in its order and has come to the"
"conclusion while giving reasons as to how it arrived at the said decision. It is the contention of the"
"Petitioner  that  no  material  has  been  submitted  to  the  TAC  by  the  CGIR  regarding  the  dates"
"pertaining to the assessment. Accordingly, they argued that the said dates were not known to them"
"and that there was no material place before the TAC, for the TAC to come to such a conclusion."
"The learned ASG In response denied this allegation. This court observes that to ascertain the exact"
"dates of the assessments neither party has submitted the said assessments before this Court."
