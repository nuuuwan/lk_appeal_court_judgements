"utilized outside of Sri Lanka therefore the services have to be zero-rated. They argued that the"
"utilization and consumption of the loss occurred when the decision to indemnify was made in the"
"Head Office of the insurer in the USA. Thus, the argument that section 7 (1) (c) should be applied."
"It is also pertinent to note that no evidence was submitted to demonstrate whether the insurer acted"
"through an agent in Sri Lanka."
"It was the Respondent's contention that for the Petitioner’s argument on indemnity to take effect,"
"the loss has to be consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka, but when the determination was made"
"to indemnify and payments were made in Sri Lanka, it amounts to the loss being consumed or"
"utilized in the country."
"It was further argued that for the said proposition of the Petitioner to be good, the Petitioner had"
"to export the loss. Hence, they argued, what matters in this interpretation is whether there was a"
"suffering of a loss to which an indemnity was due to a recipient who was subject to paying VAT."
"It is also observed that in this instance, the insurer is not a VAT-registered entity. Accordingly, as"
"per the Petitioner's argument based on the interpretation section of the Act if it is the insurer who"
"provides  the  services  to  the  insured  for  the  loss  suffered,  then  the  insurer  being  a  non-VAT"
"registered person will not qualify for payment. However, the legislature in its wisdom has decided"
"to include the “indemnity due” to the loss of a “taxable activity” to be a supply of services. Thus,"
"subjecting it to the charging section namely section 2 of the VAT Act. In our view, for the section"
"to be given a purposive interpretation, in this instance, the words “supply of services” cannot be"
"given the meaning as contended by the petitioners to fall in line with section 7 (1) (c)."
"Further, it was the contention of the Respondent that if the Petitioner’s contention of the application"
"of section 7 (1) (c) is to take effect, the Petitioner in his returns should have declared the indemnity"
"due as it was within his knowledge at the time of sending the returns, but has failed to do so. The"
"Respondent also argued that the fire had occurred in Sri Lanka and the payments had been received"
"in Sri Lanka."
"On careful analysis, we are of the view that the supply of services, as per the interpretation means"
"the “loss incurred in a taxable activity for which an indemnity is due”. This Court has already dealt"
"with the question of when the “indemnity is due”. Accordingly, in our view, it is only when the"
"insurer pays the insured, that the insurance contract comes to an end and the service is consumed"
