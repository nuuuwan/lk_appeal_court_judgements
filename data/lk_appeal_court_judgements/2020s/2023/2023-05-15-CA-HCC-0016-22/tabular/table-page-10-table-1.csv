"It is clear from the evidence of the victim, that when she divulged what happened,"
"it  was  not  only  to  her  mother  but  to  PW-03  as  well,  whom  she  referred  to  as"
"mother’s elder sister, in the company of both of them. The evidence of the mother"
"is clear that it was her sister (PW-03) who questioned the child and the victim"
"narrated  what  happened  to  PW-03  in  her  presence.  PW-03’s  evidence  further"
"corroborates this position. I find no infirmity in the evidence of the said witnesses"
"in this regard."
"In her evidence, the victim has stated that she did not inform what happened to"
"her to the doctor, but told it in front of the doctor to her mother who was near"
"her when the medical examination took place. It is very much understandable"
"that a child of 9 years of age would prefer to talk in front of her own mother when"
"asked  about  a  horrific  experience  like  this,  rather  than  speaking  directly  to  a"
"stranger. It is clear from JMO’s evidence that the child had been suffering from"

"the mother. I find no reason to conclude that there is a discrepancy between the"
"evidence of PW-01 and the JMO."
"For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the 2nd ground of appeal"
"as well."
"The Third Ground of Appeal: -"
"It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  serious  contradictions  in  the"
"identification of the appellant as the perpetrator of this crime."
"He relied on the portion of the evidence of the victim where she has stated that"
"when  the  appellant  first  came  to  the  house  and  knocked  at  the  door,  she"
"questioned him as to who, for which the person who came told that he is a friend"
"of  her  father.  It  was  his  contention  that  this  shows  that  the  perpetrator  was"
"unknown  to  the  victim  child  and  if  that  was  so,  there  should  have  been  an"
