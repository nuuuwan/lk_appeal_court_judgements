"it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of"
"the moment."
"The Fifth Ground of Appeal: -"
"I find no merit whatsoever in the contention that the learned High Court Judge"
"has failed to consider the admissions made by the appellant at the trial in his"
"sentencing order."
"The admissions by the appellant had been with regard to the birth certificate of"
"the victim child, the competency of the JMO to give evidence and other incidental"
"matters and on nothing else."
"For a person convicted for an offence of this nature, the minimum mandatory"
"sentence would be a rigorous imprisonment period of not less than 7 years and"
"not exceeding 20 years, in addition to a fine and ordering of compensation."
