"The First Ground of Appeal: -"
"It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that there exists a"
"doubt whether PW-01 has given a short history of what happened to her to the"
"JMO as stated by him in the Medico-Legal Report marked P-02."
"It was pointed out that PW-01 in her evidence before the trial Court had stated"
"that  she  did  not  make  any  statement  to  the  doctor.  At  a  later  stage  of  her"
"evidence, she has stated that it was the mother who said. It was also pointed out"

"Counsel that it was a clear misdirection as to the provisions of section 32 (2)."
"I have no reason to disagree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the"
"appellant in relation to the comments that had been made by the learned High"
