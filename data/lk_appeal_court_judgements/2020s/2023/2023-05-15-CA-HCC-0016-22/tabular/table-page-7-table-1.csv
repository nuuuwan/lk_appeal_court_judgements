"Court Judge admitting the said P-02-අ, purportedly in terms of section 32 (2) of"
"the Evidence Ordinance."
"Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance is a section where statements, written or"
"verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found,"
"or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be"
