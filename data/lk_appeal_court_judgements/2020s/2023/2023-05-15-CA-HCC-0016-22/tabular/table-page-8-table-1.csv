"provides only the history relevant to the examination of the patient as whatever"
"stated to him in relation to the perpetrator of a crime would not be evidence in"
"that regard in a Court of law."
"I find that in order to substantiate that, he in fact took down the notes in the"
"manner  he  stated  in  his  evidence,  the  JMO  has  produced  the  Medico-Legal"
"Examination Form, which has been subsequently marked as P-02-à¶…."
"Since whatever stated by a victim to a JMO in giving the history of the incident,"
"is not corroborating the evidence of a victim, but only a matter where consistency"
"of  a  statement  by  a  witness  can  be  established,  I  do  not  find  the  mentioned"
"misdirection by the learned High Court Judge as a matter that  has a vitiating"
"effect on the other findings in the judgment."
"When it comes to the argument that PW-01 has stated in her evidence that she"
"did not say as to what happened to the doctor, it is clear that the learned Counsel"
"for the appellant is taking only a small portion of the evidence by PW-01 in its"
"isolation."
"The victim had been 9 years and 3 months old when she had to experience this"
"horrific  grave  sexual  abuse.  She  has  received  serious  injuries  to  her  anus  as"
"revealed by the MLR. The JMO has clearly expressed the mental condition of a"
"victim of sexual abuse, especially a young victim and the behavioural pattern of"
"such a victim to the Court. Evidence of PW-02, the mother of the victim and that"
"of PW-03, clearly establishes the behaviour of the victim after she had to endure"
"this grave sexual abuse, which has led them to believe that she has attained age."
"It was subsequent to that, and upon questioning only, the victim has come out"
"as to what happened to her. Under cross examination in Court, she has stated"
"that  she  cannot  remember  whether  she  spoke  to  the  doctor.  When  asked"
"repeatedly, she has stated that it was to the mother who was present when the"
"doctor examined her, she narrated what happened. Upon probing further, she"
"has stated that she did not give a statement to the doctor."
