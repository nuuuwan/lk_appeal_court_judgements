"procedure prescribed in law must be followed."
"In Fernando v. Sybil Fernando [1997] 3 Sri LR 1 (SC) the court held that,"
"“If a party is dissatisfied with his registered attorney, he is at liberty to revoke the"
"proxy filed in court and either appoint some other attorney or act for himself. If the"
"registered attorney dies, or is removed or suspended or otherwise becomes incapable,"
"he may either appoint some other attorney or act for himself. However, that must be"
"done in the manner prescribed by sections 27 and 28 of the Civil Procedure Code, for"
"justice, in my view, requires that the work of a court must be conformable to laws,"
"including civil procedure laws.”"
