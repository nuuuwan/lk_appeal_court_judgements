"The following Grounds of Appeal are raised on behalf of the Appellant:"
"1.  The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the element of"
"implied consent in the impugned judgment as the victim had admitted"
"that he was 17 years of age at the time of the incident."
"2.  Even the medical evidence is suggestive of the consent of the part of"
"the victim as there were no injuries observed by the Judicial Medical"
"Officer suggestive of force."
"3.  The Learned High Court Judge has erroneously applied Ellenborough"
"Dictum in the impugned judgment."
