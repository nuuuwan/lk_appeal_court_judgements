"A.  â€œWe propose that a common time table should be laid out for the moving of the courts to"
"Kotawila and construction of the Lawyers Office Complex."
"B.  All the court houses should be moved together. The proposed piecemeal basis of moving would"
"cause great inconvenience to litigants as well as the Attorneys. As you are well aware, lawyers"
"who are practicing in original Courts are the same who practice in higher Courts and that"
"will cause immense hardships to lawyers as well as to litigants."
"C.  We have come to know that now there is a proposal for the Government to give the building"
"of the Lawyers offices to some agency from whom the lawyers will be able to rent the office"
"spaces. We would like some assurance about the rent which could be charged by such agency"
"which could bearable especially by junior lawyers."
