"as I understand the matter-is not to be determined by the building or place in which he sits,"
"but by the capacity in which he purports to act.”"
"Amarasinghe J. has illustrated several judgements where the relevant judges have taken"
"decisions  sitting  at  their  chambers;  judge’s  residence  and  at  the  crime  scene  based  on"
"several circumstances. An examination of case law shows that  the interpretation of the"
"words ‘convenient place’ has not been extended to an instance where the State as a policy"
"decision/administrative decision has decided to relocate the buildings of courts to another"
"location. On a careful perusal of such judicial precedent and the effect of Section 5(3), it"
"implies that every judge is possessed with the power to hold Court at any convenient place"
"within  his  territorial  jurisdiction  on  special  circumstances  on  temporary  basis  and  that"
"power cannot be exercised to change the place of the ‘building’ which constitutes Court"

"of Matara, marked ‘X’ (annexed to the motion dated 12.12.2022), by which he attempted"
"to  express  consensuses  among  the  learned  judges  of  Matara  to  shift  the  existing  Court"
"premises to the said New Complex. He submits that the relocation of the court premises"
"can be done even only with such consensuses of judges in terms of the proviso to the said"
"Section 5(3). I simply cannot agree with the assertions of the learned ASG as the judges"
"cannot  possess  an  unfettered  discretion  under  the  proviso  to  Section  5(3)  to  change  or"
