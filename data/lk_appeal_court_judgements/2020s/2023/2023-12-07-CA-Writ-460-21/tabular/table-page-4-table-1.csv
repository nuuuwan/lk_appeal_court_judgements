"25.08.2011(P5), each heir of the original lessee Mr. Gunadasa had been informed to"
"submit the necessary documents in order for the 1st Respondent to transfer the said"
"shares to each heir. In response to the said letter, the Petitioner has submitted the"
"required documents to the 4th Respondent. However, the 5th-8th Respondents had"
"failed to comply with the said letter marked P5. As such, yet again the Petitioner and"
"the other heirs of the original lessee Mr. Gunadasa had been informed to submit the"
"necessary documents within 14 days from the letter dated 22.03.2017 (P6) as they"
"have failed to respond to the said letter P5. In response to the said letter P6, the"
"Petitioner has forwarded the letter dated 06.04.2017 (P7), whereby the Petitioner"
"had claimed that the officers of the NHDA are delaying the process of transferring"
"the impugned property and accordingly has requested the 1st Respondent to transfer"
"her  share  of  the 
impugned  property  without  delay.  The  Petitioner  states  that"
"although she submitted all necessary documents to the 4th Respondent as requested"
"for by letter P6, no response was received."
"Thereafter, 
the  Petitioner  has  submitted  her  grievance 
to 
the  Parliamentary"
"Commissioner  for  Administration.  Through  the  Parliamentary  Commissioner  for"
"Administration,  the  Petitioner  had  come  to  know  that  the  2nd  Respondent  has"
"decided  to  transfer  the  disputed  property  to  the  5th  Respondent  in  terms  of  the"
"provisions of Circular No.2018/දේ. /කළ. /02 dated 30.06.2018 (P13/1R6) which has"
"come  into  effect  from  23.04.2018.  Further  pursuant  to  a  response  received  in"
"respect of a right to information application, the Petitioner had got hold of the letter"
"P18 issued by the 3rd Respondent to the 4th Respondent. Thereby, the Petitioner had"
"come  to  know  that  the 
impugned  property  had  been  transferred  to  the  5th"
"Respondent in terms of Circular No.2018/ දේ. /කළ./01 marked P12/1R5.  However,"
"the Petitioner states although the parties who claimed the property in question were"
"asked  to 
inform  the  above  transfer  by  said 
letter  P18,  the  Petitioner  was  not"
"informed."
"In the above context, the Petitioner contends that the above Circular No. 2018/ දේ."
"/කළ./01  marked  P12/1R5  has  no 
retrospective  effect  and 
therefore  has  no"
"application in respect of deciding the entitlements of the heirs of the original lessee"
"Mr. Gunadasa to the impugned property. Hence, it is claimed that the decision of the"
"1st Respondent to transfer the disputed property to the 5th Respondent is invalid. In"
"view  of  the  said  contention,  the  Petitioner  has  requested  the  2nd  Respondent  to"
"transfer her entitlement of 1/5 undivided share of the property in question to her"
