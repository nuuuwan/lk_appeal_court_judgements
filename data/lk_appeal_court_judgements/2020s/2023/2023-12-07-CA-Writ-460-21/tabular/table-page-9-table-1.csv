"July 2020.   The said Circulars P12/1R5 and /or P13/1R6 have no provision to give"
"retrospective effect. Accordingly, the Petitioner submits that the decision of the 2nd"
"and 3rd Respondents contained in the P18 to act on the Circulars P12/1R5 and /or"
"P13/1R6 which came into effect in 2018 without retrospective effect is illegal and"
"ultra vires.   It is further claimed that the 1st-4th Respondents should have adopted"
"the procedure laid down under Circular No. 2011/දේ. /කළ./05(1R4) in determining"
"the rights of the heirs of the original lessee Mr. Gunadasa to the property in question."
"It is observed that the 1st-4th Respondents could not arrive at a decision in respect"
"of the property in question under Circular No. 2011/දේ. /කළ./05(1R4) while it was"
"in  effect  as  the  relevant  conditions  under  the  said  Circular  were  not  satisfied."
"However,  when 
the  Circular  No.2018/  දේ./කළ./01 
(P12/1R5) 
and  Circular"
"No.2018/දේ./ කළ./02 (P13/1R6) came into effect in 2018, the same enabled the 1st-"
"4th Respondents to make a decision in respect of rights over the impugned property."
"The rights of the 5th Respondent over the land could be determined by the 1st-4th"
"Respondent  under  the  said  Circular  No.2018/දේ.  /කළ./01(P12/1R5  and  Circular"
"No.2018/දේ./කළ./02 (P13/1R6). Thus, it appears that the provisions under Circular"
"P12/1R5  or  P13/1R6  were  not  applied 
in 
retrospective  effect  by 
the  1st-4th"
"Respondent."
"The  Petitioner  asserts  that  the  principle  of  retrospective  effect  must  be  applied"
"based  on  the  event  of  the  original 
lease-holder's  demise.  Nevertheless,  these"
"Circulars 1R4, P12/1R5 and /or P13/1R6 involved in the instant application apply to"
"the  procedure  in  the  execution  of  deeds  and  not  in  respect  of  the  accrual  of"
"entitlement to the property. The basis for the alienation of property specified in the"
"1R4 is different from the basis specified in the P12/1R5 and /or P13/1R6. Anyhow"
"the parties failed to obtain their entitlement as per Circular 1R4 at the time it was"
"effected. The 5th Respondent has proved possession of the property subsequent to"
"the 
issuance 
of 
Circular  No.2018/  දේ. 
/කළ./01 
(P12/1R5) 
and 
Circular"
"No.2018/දේ./කළ./02 (P13/1R6) in order to secure a deed of execution in his favour."
"Therefore  the  5th  Respondent  has  relied  on  the  said  1R5  and  1R6  Circulars"
"prospectively and independent of any retrospective application over the rights of any"
"other parties."
"Further, in terms of the Section 8 of the National Housing Development Act NHDA"
"has the authority to decide in whose favour the deed of transfer should be executed"
