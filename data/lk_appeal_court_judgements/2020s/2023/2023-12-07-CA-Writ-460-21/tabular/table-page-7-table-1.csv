"obtaining a Deed of Transfer in respect of a land, the entitlement of the heirs of such"
"deceased 
lease-holder  to  the  respective 
land  should  be  accepted  by  the  1st"

"When  the  facts  of  the  instant  case  are  taken  into  consideration,  it  appears  that"
"pursuant to the death of the original lease-holder, the Manager (Colombo South)"
"had caused to send the letters marked P5 and P6 to the Petitioner and the other"
"heirs, requiring them to submit the documents specified therein in order to effect"
"the respective deeds of transfer. It is observed that the said letters P5 and P6 are"
"addressed to all heirs of the deceased original lease-holder and that they indicate"
"that all heirs should submit the relevant documents for the 1st Respondent to arrive"
"at  a  decision.  It  is  on  common  ground  that  all  heirs  of  the  original  lessee  Mr."
"Gunadasa did not submit the relevant documents as required under letters P5 and"
"P6. Thus, it appears that all conditions that were required to be satisfied in order for"

"the  prevailing  law,  the  1st  Respondent  could  not  have  issued  a  Deed  of  Transfer"
"transferring an undivided 1/5 share of the property in question to the Petitioner."
"Moreover, the Respondents submit that after the demise of the original lessee Mr."
"Gunadasa,  his  widow,  the  Petitioner’s  mother  along  with  the  6th -8th  Respondents"
"submitted  affidavits 
indicating  their  consent  to  have  the  property 
in  question"
"transferred in the name of the 5th Respondent. In support of said position, the 1st -"
"4th  Respondents  submitted  documents  1R1(i) -1R1(iv).  Further,  the  content  of  the"
"letter P11 also supports the said position. However, said endeavour had failed in view"
"of  the  Petitioner’s  objection.  Hence,  the  Petitioner  is  stopped  from  denying  the"
"applicability  of  the  same  procedure  in  respect  of  the  Petitioner’s  application  in"
"respect  the  transferring  of  undivided  1/5  share  to  the  Petitioner.  In  the  above"
"circumstances, I am inclined to accept the stance of the 1st- 4th Respondents that"
