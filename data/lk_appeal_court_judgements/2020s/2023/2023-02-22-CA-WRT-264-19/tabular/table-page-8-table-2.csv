"In Biso Menike v. Cyril de Alwis2, Sharvananda J held that:"
"“The proposition that the application for writ must be sought as soon as"
"injury  is caused  is  merely  an  application of  the equitable doctrine  that"
"delay  defeats  equity  and  the  longer  the  injured  person  sleeps  over  his"
"rights without any reasonable excuse the chance of his success in writ"
"application dwindles and the Court may reject a writ application on the"
"ground of unexplained delay.”"
