"have been dismissed in limine.”"
"In  this  context,  I  observe  that  the  Petitioners  have  been  negligent  in  not"
"addressing the Court in a timely manner and that they have slept over their"
"rights,  if  any,  without  any  reasonable  excuse  whatsoever.  Therefore,  as"
"identified above, the Petitioners’ prayer for grant of Writs by prayers (c) and"
"(d) being substantial relief sought in their Petition, cannot be granted due to"
"severe laches. This Court also observes that the rest of the relief sought by"
"the Petitioners are consequential to the said relief thereto and thus will not"
"be entitled to such."
