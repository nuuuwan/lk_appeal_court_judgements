"Decision (P6), granting additional marks to the graduate trainees"
"was made on 26-02-1997. It is pertinent to note that the date of"
"implementation of the said Cabinet Decision was not stipulated in"
"P6.  The  interview  for  the  post  of  Assistant  Superintendent  of"
"Customs 
Grade 
II 
was 
held 
on 
13-05-1997. 
For 
the"
"implementation 
of 
the 
said  Cabinet  Decision, 
the 
Public"
"Administration Circular No. 13/1997  (P7) was issued on 13-06-"
"1997. As per P7, the date of implementation of P6 is 13-06-1997."
"In  these  circumstances,  the  Petitioner  was  not  entitled  to  the"
"benefit of P6 as the date of implementation of the same was after"
"the interview that he faced. It appears to this Court that there is a"
"delay in issuing Circular P6. However, it has not been challenged"
"before  the  Court  of  law.  Hence,  ex-facie,  the  Petitioner  is  not"
"entitled to the benefits set out in P6 and P7."
"Moreover, it is pertinent to note that only the graduate trainees are"
"entitled  to  the  benefit  of  additional  marks  in  terms  of  Cabinet"
"Decision P6, and that permanent employees are not subject to P6,"
"which reads;"
"“……..Cabinet Paper 97/0379/100/007, a Memorandum dated 22-"
"“Employment 
of  Graduate 
01-1997 
by 
the 
President 
on"
"Trainees” – approval was granted for the recommendations in the"
"Memorandum.”"
"It 
is  established 
that, 
the  Petitioner  was  appointed 
to 
the"
"permanent and pensionable post of Tax Officer, Excise Directorate"
"of Sri Lanka Customs with effect from 01-01-1997 (P3/R1). Since"
"the Petitioner was not a graduate trainee at the time of the Cabinet"
"Decision  P6 
(26-02-1997),  he 
is  not  entitled  to 
the  benefits"
"stipulated therein. In these respects,  I am inclined to accept the"
"contention  of 
the 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
that 
the"
"Petitioner is not entitled to any relief in terms of P6 and P7."
"Furthermore,  at  the  relevant  time  period  (1997),  the  appointing"
"authority  of  the  Assistant  Superintendent  of  Customs  was  the"
"Public  Service  Commission.  Accordingly, 
the  Public  Service"
"Commission 
had 
issued 
appointment 
letters 
to 
selected"
"candidates. As per P4, the applications were called for the post of"
