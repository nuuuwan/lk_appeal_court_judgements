"E
ven the Tax Appeal Commission has decided this question in the same way. It"
"says in its determination,"
"“It is to be noted that in section 17(2)(a)(ii) even though some terms such"
"as 
“agriculture”, 
“agro  processing”, 
“non 
traditional  products”  and"
"“deemed  export”  are  defined,  the  phrase  “industrial  and  machine  tool"
"manufacturing”  is  not  defined.  Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  look  for  a"
"meaning  to  be  attributed  to  this  phrase  “industrial  and  machine  tool"
"manufacturing”. 
It  would  appear  that 
in  the  phrase  “industrial  and"
"machine tool manufacturing” the main item referred to is the term “tool”"
"and  the  words  “tool  manufacturing”  is  qualified  by  the  words  industrial"
"and  machine.  Therefore 
in  this  phrase  “industrial  and  machine  tool"
"manufacturing”  the  term  “tool”  can  be  understood  to  mean  either  an"
"“industrial tool” or a “machine tool””."
