"The court further said,"
"“Mr. Elphinston [who appeared for the state] attempted to invoke the aid"
"of a confidential note dated the 23rd March 1919 wherein the Mukhtiarkar"
"had made the calculation of the assessment and as this was done before"
"the expiry of the year, he argued that the tax was charged within the year."
"This argument has no substance in it. It is unarguable that the contents"
"of a confidential document were communicated to the assessee, nor"
"is it even alleged that the latter was aware before the end of the year"
"that he was chargeable with any super tax”. (page 27)"
