"In regard to this question, the learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant has"
"argued  in  oral  submissions  that,  an  “industrial  tool”  does  not  mean  only  a"
"screwdriver  or  a  wrench,  etc.,  but  it  includes  cables.  Certain  notes  from  the"
"internet have been produced to show that cables and wires are also classified as"
"“tools”."
