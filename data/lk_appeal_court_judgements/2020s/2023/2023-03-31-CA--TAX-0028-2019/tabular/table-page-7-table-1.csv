"term used was not “tool” as the Tax Appeal Commission thought but “industrial"
"tool manufacturing”."
"T
he use of the prefix “industrial” before the term “tool manufacturing” alters its"
"ordinary meaning."
"T
herefore  it  is  clear  that  the  appellant  is  entitled  to  the  exemption  from  tax"
"because  it  is  engaged  in  “industrial  tool  manufacturing”  which  is  a  “specified"
"undertaking”."
"H
owever, the question of law No. 03 is not correctly formulated, in the sense, it"
"should have referred not to “industrial  manufacturing”, but to “industrial tool"
"manufacturing”. Hence while the said question of law has to be answered in the"
"negative,  the  answer  must  accompany  with  an  explanation  that  the  term"
"“industrial and machine tool manufacturing” can be interpreted as “industrial"
"tool manufacturing” and “machine tool manufacturing”, in which the appellant’s"
"product comes within the former."
"T
he question of law No. 03 is,"
"“Can the interpretation of ‘industrial manufacturing’ as determined by the"
"Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that “it has a very wide"
"connotation”?"
"But it would appear that now this question will not arise because the answer to"
"question  of  law  No.  02  (a)  is  not  that  it  is  “industrial  manufacturing”  but"
"“industrial tool manufacturing”."
"Hence this question has to be answered as “Does not arise, in view of the answer"
"given to question of law No. 02 (a)”."
