"h.  However,  the  said  contracts 
failed  to  specify  who  these  associate"
"companies  were  and 
in  particular,  whether  they  were  the  above-"
"named  company  as    sought  to  be  claimed  by  the  petitioner  at  the"
"inquiry;"
"i. 
In 
this 
connection 
it  was 
found 
that 
these 
so-called  associate"
"companies  were  separate  legal  entities  from  the  petitioner  and  that"
"consequently  any  transfer  would  be  tantamount  to  the  3rd  to  221st"
"respondents  being  employed  by  a  different  employer  to  the  petitioner"
"which the law does not permit;"
"j.  Accordingly, finding had been correctly made that the services of 3rd to"
"221st had been wrongfully terminated by the petitioner consequent to"
"the closure of its business."
