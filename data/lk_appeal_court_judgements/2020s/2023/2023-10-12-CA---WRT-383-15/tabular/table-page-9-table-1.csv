"terminated. The employees had complained to the Commissioner of Labour."
"In these circumstances, the intervention of the 1st and 2nd respondents was"
"a  duty  cast  on  them 
in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  the  Termination  of"
"Employment  of  Workman 
(Special  Provisions)  Act  No.  45  of  1971  as"
"amended.  In  these  circumstances,  the  petitioner  cannot  say  that  the  1st  or"
"2nd respondents have acted outside their power."
"The  petitioner  filed  an  application  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Writ  Case  No."
"285/2009  seeking  a  mandate  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  decision  of  the  1st"
"respondent marked P10 in that case. By P 10, the 2nd respondent overruled"
"the  preliminary 
objection 
of 
the  petitioner 
that 
there  had  been  no"
"termination of employment and therefore, the Commissioner of Labour had"
"no  jurisdiction  to  hold  an  inquiry  under  the  provisions  of  TEWA.  The  2nd"
"respondent  by  order  P  10  held  that  he  had  the  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into"
"the matter as a case of termination of employment.  However, the petitioner"
"has  withdrawn 
that 
application 
and 
the 
application  was 
pro-forma"
"dismissed.  As  such,  the  petitioner  has  virtually  conceded  that  there  was  a"
"termination and is now precluded from taking up a position that the 1st and"
"2nd respondents have no jurisdiction to hold an inquiry under and in terms"
"of the provisions of TEWA."
"The  1st  and  2nd 
respondents  have  not  ordered 
the  petitioner 
to  pay"
"compensation to all the employees. The decision of the 2nd respondent does"
"not apply to 24 employees who had resigned, 09 employees who had vacated"
"posts,  06  employees  who  had  served  less  than  180  days  and  8  employees"
"who  had  withdrawn 
their  complaint 
in  2014. 
  The  report  of 
the  2nd"
"respondent 
refers 
to  227  out  of  a 
total  of  266  employees  who  had"
"complained  under  the  Act,  and 
the  order  correctly  refers  only 
to  219"
"employees.  As  such,  the  order  is  not  arbitrary,  capricious  or  unreasonable"
"as alleged by the petitioner."
"If  the  petitioner  was 
incurring 
losses  and  was  unable  to  continue  the"
"operations  in  the  factory  and  intended  to  close  the  factory,  it  could  have"
"been  informed  to  the  Commissioner  of  Labour,  and  the  matter  could  have"
"been  resolved  in  an  amicable  way.  The  conduct  of  the  petitioner  itself  was"
"not reasonable in this regard and, therefore, does not deserve to have a Writ"
"of Certiorari, which is a discretional remedy."
"In the case of Biso Menika vs. Cyril de Alwis and Others [1982)1 Sri LR 368,"
"Sharvananda J (as he then was) stated,"
"â€œA  Writ  of  Certiorari  is  issued  at  the  discretion  of  the  Court.  It  cannot  be"
"held  as  of  right  or  one  issued  as  a  matter  of  course.  But  exercise  of  this"
"discretion  by  Court  is  governed  by  certain  well-accepted  principles.  The"
