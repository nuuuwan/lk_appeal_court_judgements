"The first Petitioner is a Company which imports accessories for the garment industry and"
"exports value-added goods under the Temporary Imports for Export Processing (TIEP) and"
"Bonding Facility scheme. The 2nd Petitioner is a director of the 1st Petitioner Company. The"
"Petitioners state that they ordered certain goods from a Chinese exporter. However, the"
"exporter had loaded certain packages of undeclared cosmetics, two Ceramic Commodes"
"and three Ceramic Wash Basins into the container. It is said that the said cosmetic packages"
"which were supposed to have been shipped to Dubai had been mistakenly loaded into the"
"container by the exporter and the said ceramic bathroom fittings had been sent free of"
"charge for the personal use of the directors of the 1st Respondent Company without their"
"knowledge.  The  Petitioners  conceded  that  those  items  had  not  been  declared  in  the"
"Manifest, Bill of Lading, Delivery Order, Packing List or Commercial Invoice. Consequently,"
"Sri Lanka Customs invoking Sections 12,43 and 107 of the Customs Ordinance has forfeited"
"the entire consignment by its Order dated 02.06.2021 including the items which had been"
"duly declared under the said consignment (inventoried items no.1 to 12,16,17,18 and 21)"
"as  those  items  had  been  used  to  cover  or  conceal  the  goods  which  had  not  been  duly"
"declared.  However,  the  declared 
items  were  subsequently  released  on  a  mitigated"
"forfeiture of Rs.5,000,000/= in terms of Sections 163 and 166B of the Customs Ordinance."
"Despite  the  said  ceramic  items  not  being  duly  declared,  the Petitioners  claim  that  such"
"items  could  have  been  returned  to  the  Petitioners  with  a  penalty  or  mitigated  without"
"forfeiting  by  resorting  to  terms  of  the  Import  Control  Regulation  No.3  of  2021  bearing"
"Gazette  Notification  No.  2214/56  dated  11.02.2021  marked  X5.  The  Petitioners  further"
"contend that the cosmetic items which were forfeited could have been mitigated at the"
"discretion of the Director General of Customs without destroying them. Accordingly being"
"aggrieved by the above order dated 02.06.2021 of the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner seeks"
"intervention of this court inter alia by way of Writs of Certiorari to quash the impugned"
"order dated 02.06.2021, Writs of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to mitigate"
"the forfeiture in respect of the said ceramic bathroom fittings (inventoried items no.19 and"
"20) and the cosmetic items (inventoried items no.13,14 and 15) and to release the one"
"million  cash  deposit  and  four  million  bank  guarantee  tendered 
in  order  to  clear  the"
"impugned  consignment  and  Writ  of  Prohibition  prohibiting  1st  to  4th  Respondents  from"
"claiming destroying charges from the Petitioners."
"It is on common ground that the impugned ceramic bathroom fittings and cosmetic items"
"which had not been declared in the Manifest, Bill of Lading, Delivery Order, Packing List or"
"commercial  Invoice,  were  shipped  along  with  the subject  consignment  exported  by  the"
"Petitioners."
