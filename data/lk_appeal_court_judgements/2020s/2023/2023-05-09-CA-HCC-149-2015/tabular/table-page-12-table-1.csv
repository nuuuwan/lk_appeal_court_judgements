"“It is no doubt true that per se absconding is not enough to prove the guilt of the person"
"who  has  absconded.  But  it  comes  in  as  an  important  piece  of  corroborative  evidence,  if  there  is"
"other evidence to prove the connection of the accused with the crime. In this case, the accused ran"
"away to Pakistan after the commission of the murder and came back from there after 40 days. The"
"accused gave no plausible explanation for his absence. The motive on the part of the accused to"
"commit the murder of the deceased was established. The absconding of the accused for such a long"
"period  was  taken  into  consideration  by  the  court  and  the  accused  was  convicted  on  charge  of"
"murder under s302, IPC 1860.”"
