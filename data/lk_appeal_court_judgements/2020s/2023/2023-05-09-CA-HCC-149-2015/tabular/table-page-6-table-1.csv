"court  could  act  on  that  evidence  as  being  reliable.  In  other  words  what  is  necessary  is  some"
"additional evidence direct or circumstantial, rendering it probable that the accomplice’s story is"
"true and reasonably safe to act upon, and such evidence has the effect of connecting or tending to"
"connect the particular accused with the crime.” [emphasis added]"
"However, for this principle to be applicable it is imperative that the witness must"
"first  be  identified  as  an  accomplice.  Who  an  accomplice  is  has  been  the  subject  of"
"discussion in the following line of cases:"
"Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in De Saram v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2002]"
"1  SLR  288  cited  with  approval  the  definition  of  an  accomplice  set  out  in  Wharton  on"
"Criminal Evidence. An accomplice is thus:"
"“a person who knowingly, voluntarily and with common intent with the principal offender"
"unites in the commission of a crime. The term cannot be used in a loose or popular sense so as to"
"embrace  one  who  has  guilty  knowledge  or  is  morally  delinquent  or  who  was  an  admitted"
"participant in a related but distinct offence. To constitute one an accomplice, he must perform some"
"act or take some part in the commission of the crime, or owe some  duty to the person in danger"
"that makes it incumbent on him to prevent its commission.” [emphasis added]"
"In W.M.M. Kumarihami v. Galagamage Indrawansa Kumarasir & Others SC TAB"
"Appeal  No.  02/2012  SC  Minutes  02.04.2014  her  Ladyship  Shiranee  Thilakawardane  J."
"cited the definition given in Chetumal Rekumal v. Emperor [1934] AIR 183,"
"“An  accomplice  is  one  who  is  a  guilty  associate  in  crime  or  who  sustains  such  relation  to  the"
"criminal  act  that  he  could  be  charged  jointly  with  the  accused.  It  is  admittedly,  not  every"
"participation in a crime which makes a party an accomplice in it so as to require his testimony to"
"be confirmed.”"
"Her Ladyship further observed:"
"“Thus, the idea that all acts pertaining to a crime can make a party an accomplice is ill-"
"founded.”"
"A person merely assisting in the disposal of the body of the deceased in respect of"
"whom a charge of murder is made cannot be considered an accomplice within the meaning"
"of Section 114(b) of the Evidence Ordinance. Buttressing this proposition are the cases of"
"King v. Peiris Appuhamy 43 NLR 412 and Queen v. Ariyawathie 59 NLR 241."
