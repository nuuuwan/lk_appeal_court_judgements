"“The combined result of Sections 133 read with illustration (b) to Section 114 of Evidence"
"Act is that the Courts have evolved, as a rule of prudence, the requirement that it would be unsafe"
"to convict an accused solely based on uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. The corroboration"
"must be in relation to the material particulars of the testimony of an accomplice. It is clear that an"
"accomplice would be familiar with the general outline of the crime as he would be one who has"
"participated in the same and therefore, indeed, be familiar with the matter in general terms. The"
"connecting  link  between  a  particular  accused  and  the  crime,  is  where  corroboration  of  the"
"testimony of an accomplice would assume crucial significance. The evidence of an accomplice must"
"point to the involvement of a particular accused. It would, no doubt, be sufficient, if his testimony"
"in  conjunction  with  other  relevant  evidence  unmistakably  makes  out  the  case  for  convicting  an"
"accused.”"
