. Sasi Mahendran, J."
"The Accused-Accused (hereinafter referred to as “the Accused”) was found guilty"
"in the High Court of Gampaha of murder and punished with death under Section 296 of"
"the Penal Code. This an appeal preferred by the said Accused impugning the conviction."
"T
he Accused,  along with the  2nd  Accused, was indicted  before  the High Court of"
"Gampaha on two counts; the second, for which he was found guilty, was for committing"
"the  murder  of  one  Hasitha  Kelum  Madawala,  which  is  an  offence  punishable  under"
"Section 296 of the Penal Code read with Section 32 of the Penal Code."
"Both, the Accused and the 2nd Accused opted for trial by a judge. The Prosecution"
"led the evidence of twenty-one witnesses and drew its case to a close. The Accused gave a"
"dock statement. Two witnesses gave evidence for the Defence."
"A
t the conclusion of the trial the learned Trial Judge convicted the Accused and"
"sentenced him to death for count two (vide judgment and sentence dated 14th August 2015,"
"respectively on pages 1006 and 1079 of the Brief).  The 2nd Accused was convicted for the"
"first  count  (that  the  Accused  and  himself  conspired  to  commit  the  murder  of  the  said"
"Hasitha Kelum Madawala, liable to be punished under Sections 113B, 102, 32 read with"
"Section 296 of the Penal Code) and punished with five years rigorous imprisonment and"
"a  fine  of  Rs.  25,000/-  with  a  default  term  of  one-year  simple  imprisonment.  Being"
"aggrieved  by  the  aforesaid  conviction  and  sentence  the  Accused  preferred  the  instant"
"appeal.  In passing it must be observed that the sentence passed upon the 2nd Accused is"
"erroneous in law, and it is evidently so on the face of the record. However, since neither"
"the Attorney General nor the 2nd Accused appealed that conviction and sentence it would"
"be unfair to the 2nd Accused for us to delve into this matter."
