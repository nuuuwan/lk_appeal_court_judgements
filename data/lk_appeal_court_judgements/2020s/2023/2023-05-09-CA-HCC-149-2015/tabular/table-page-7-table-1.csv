"An  observation  of  his  Lordship  Soza  J.  in  Attorney  General  v.  D.  Seneviratne"
"[1982] 1 SLR 302 at p. 328 is pertinent to the facts of the instant case:"
"“Glanville Williams in his Textbook of Criminal Law (1978) p. 285 defines accomplices as"
"parties in different degree of complicity to a crime and adds “Accomplices consist of the perpetrator"
"and the accessories”. This indeed is the primary and natural meaning of the term. The perpetrator"
"is the person who in law commits the offence. A person who incites or helps the commission of an"
"offence by the perpetrator is an accessory. But help given after the commission of the crime does"
"not make the helper an accomplice."
"While  a  co-perpetrator  and  an  accessory  before  the  fact  clearly,  are  accomplices,  an"
"accessory after the fact is not necessarily always  so. The principal danger in the evidence of an"
"accomplice  is  that  he;  may  be  tempted  to  purchase  immunity  by  currying  favour  with;  the"
"prosecution and implicating another while reducing his own role in the offence. But no such danger"
"exists in the case of. an accessory, after the fact. Indeed the interest of an accessory after the fact"
"should be to establish the innocence of the principal offender not his guilt.”"
"In the facts of the present case, the role played by PW1 and PW2 cannot be treated"
"as that of an accomplice for the reason that, their role was, if at all, to assist the Accused"
"to  disappear  following  the  murder.  There  is  no  evidence  to  establish  that  they  had"
"knowledge  of  the  Accused’s plans to  commit  this  heinous  crime.  As  such, we  are  of  the"
"view that they are not “accomplices” within the meaning of the law. Consequently, there"
"does not appear to be a need for corroboration in material particulars as required by the"
"wisdom of Section 114(b) of the Evidence Ordinance or that of the common law."
