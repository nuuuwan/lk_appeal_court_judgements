"“ a)must be an admission, that  is,  a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests  an"
"inference  as  to  any  fact  in  issue  or  relevant  fact  within  the  meaning  of  Section  17(1)  of  the"
"ordinance:"
"b) It may be made at any time;"
"c
) It must be made by a person accused of an offence;"
"d
)It must state or suggest the inference that he committed the offence."
"This  definition  tallies  substantially  with  Stephen's  definition  of  a   “confession”  as  an"
"admission made at any time by a person charged with a crime stating or suggesting the inference,"
"that he committed that crime.”"
"In the notable judgment of Anandagoda v. the Queen  64 NLR 73  at 79 the Privy"
"Council laid down the test to determine whether a statement is a confession. The relevant"
"excerpt of the judgment reads:"
"“The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a"
"reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made"
"it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested"
"the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it"
"must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts…"
"The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether"
"the  words  of  admission  in  the  context  expressly  or  substantially  admit  guilt  or  do  they  taken"
"together in the context inferentially admit guilt? A useful definition of a “ confession ” is to be found"
"in Wigmore’s Law of Evidence. Section 821 page 930 quoting from a judgment of Wolverton J. in"
"State v Porter 32 Or. 135, 49 Pac. 964 : “ We take it that the admission of a fact, or of a bundle of"
"facts, from which guilt is directly deducible, or which within and of themselves import guilt, may"
"be  denominated  a  confession,  but  not  so  'with  the  admission  of  a  particular  act  or  acts  or"
"circumstances which may or may not involve guilt, and which is dependent for such result upon"
"other facts or circumstances to be established. It is not necessary that there be a declaration of an"
"intent to admit guilt; it is sufficient that the facts admitted involve a crime, and these import guilt,"
"or, as put by Mr. Wharton, “ I am guilty of this ” ; and this imports the admission of all the acts"
"constituting  guilt  ’.  It  is  necessary,  however,  that  the  accused  should  speak  with,  an  animus"
"confitendi, or an intention to speak the truth touching the specific charge of guilt; and when he,"
"with such intention, narrates facts -constituting a crime, the guilt becomes matter of inference, a"
"resultant feature of the narration without an explicit declaration to that effect. So that we conclude"
