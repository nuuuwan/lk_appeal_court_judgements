"the Accused had called him, his evidence remained unshaken in cross-examination. There"
"was no denial that the Accused had called. Further, there were no suggestions to the effect"
"that it was not the Accused who spoke to him, or that he was lying."
"W
e  are  of  the  view  that  the  statements  uttered  by  the  Accused  to  two  different"
"witnesses are of a confessionary nature."
"Justice  V.R.  Krishna  Iyer  in  Nandhini  Satpathy  v.    P.L.Dani  (1978)  2SCC  424"
"notably  remarked  “Confession  is  a  potency  to  make  crime  conclusive”.  A  statement"
"recently referred to in the judgment of his Lordship Priyantha Fernando J. in Artygala"
"Vithanage Indika Ruwan Kumara v. the Attorney General CA- HCC188/2016 CA Minutes"
"23.09.2019."
"We are mindful of a school of thought that a sense of caution must be exercised in"
"dealing with extra-judicial confessions. However, as mentioned above, the statements of"
"a confessionary nature, in the instant case, are only one piece of a puzzle, which must be"
"read in conjunction with all the facts pointing in the direction of the Accused. It is not the"
"sole basis for conviction. Further, the defence has not been able to impeach the veracity"
"of the statements made by the Accused to the two witnesses. It must also be noted that"
"the statements appear to be voluntary and of his free will."
"Subsequent Conduct"
"Section  8  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  makes  subsequent  conduct  of  a  party,  an"
"offence  against  whom  is  the  subject  of  the  proceeding,  relevant  if  it  influences  or  is"
"influenced  by  any  fact in issue or  relevant  fact.  As  the  learned  author  Coomaraswamy"
"notes (at p. 233) there must be a “departure with intent to defeat or delay the arrest. It is"
"to go out of the jurisdiction of the court or to conceal oneself to avoid legal process.”"
"I
n  the  instant  case,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  conduct  of  the  Accused  is  mere"
"absconding, similar to that of the tendency of an innocent person to evade arrest when"
"suspected of grave crimes; “an instinct of self-preservation in an average human being”"
"(Woodroffe  and  Ameer  Ali  in ‘Law  of  Evidence’  p.  815).  The learned  authors  citing  the"
"cases of Mureed v State of Rajasthan (1980) 5 Raj Cr C 387, p. 391 and Rameshwar  v."
