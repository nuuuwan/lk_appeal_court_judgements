"The  main  ground  of  appeal  by  the  appellant  is  that  the  charge  in  the"
"indictment is in violation of section 165 of the CPC. The said section is as"
"below,"
"“The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the"
"alleged offence and as to the person against whom and as to the thing in"
"respect  of  which  it  was  committed  are  reasonably  sufficient  to  give  the"
"accused notice of the matter with which he is charged with and to show"
"that the offence is not prescribed”."
"Therefore from the above it is very clear that the particulars in the charge is"
"very important for the accused to understand the  charge which has been"
"levelled against him and the specific time is also very important for another"
"additional reason as for the accused person to understand that the offence"
"with which he has been charged with is not prescribed, and  when a time"
"period is given the accused is unable to do that and anyway if he takes up"
"the defense of an alibi he is unable to do  so when he does not know the"
"exact date on which he had been charged with. But of course, the CPC has"
"made  one  exception  under  subsection  2  of  section  165  in  which  the  time"
"and the quantity can be stated in gross sums in offences of criminal breach"
"of trust and criminal misapplication. But in the instant matter it is a sexual"
"offence and the definite date is important for the accused to formulate his"
"defense."
"The  trial  judge  had  justified  the  instant  matter  by  quoting  section  174  of"
"the  CPC  which  this  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  it  has  no  bearing  for  the"
"instant matter because it refers to matters in which charges can be joined"
"which has been committed within the span of one year and to be tried in"
"one indictment."
