"The  doctor  who  had  examined 
the  victim  had  given  evidence  and"
"according to her the victim had been examined and the history recorded"
"on 8.6.2016 but according to  the  victim  as  mentioned  above he  had not"
"given a case history to the doctor hence there is a contradiction between"
"the  doctor  and  the  victim  but  according  to  the  doctor  the  first  incident"
"had taken place on 2016.6.8 but whereas according to the indictment the"
"period referred to begins in 2015 .6.8 to 2016.8.6 which again is contrary"
"to medical evidence and other evidence it runs more than  to 12 months"
"which is contrary to provisions in the CPC."
"The mother who had been called to give evidence also refers to the date of"
"the incident as being on 8.6.2016 and not in 2015, and the mother says that"
"she  noticed  a  difference 
in  the  behavior  of  the  victim  and  then  she"
"questioned him but according to the victim it is the teacher who had told"
"her  about  the  incident,  which  creates  a  yet  another  discrepancy  in  the"
"prosecution evidence."
"The prosecution has led the evidence of the investigative officers and had"
"closed the case for the prosecution."
"The defense had been called and the appellant had made a dock statement"
"and he had denied the whole allegation and he had said that an incident in"
"the nature of the allegation could not have happened in his house because"
"it is always frequented by his children. He had said that he had been falsely"
"implicated  because  there  had  been  an 
issue  with  the  victimâ€™s  mother"
"regarding  some  water  supply.  The 
trial 
judge  had 
rejected 
the  dock"
"statement  on 
the  basis 
that 
it  only  substantiates 
the  version  of 
the"
"prosecution."
