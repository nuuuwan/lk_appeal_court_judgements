"Court should insist on those words being explained and exemplified. The Court relied upon the"
"observation made by Bertram C.J. in the case of Alwis Vs. Perera (21 N.L.R. 321) (full bench) in"
"which it states that;"
"""I wish very much that the District Judges - I speak not particularly, but generally- when"
"a witness says, ""I possess"" or ""we possess"", or ""we took the produce"" would not confine"
"themselves  merely  to  recording  the  words  but  would  insist  on  those  words  being"
"explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon the present practice of"
"simply recording these words when stated by the witnesses and would see that such facts"
"as the witnesses have in their minds are stated in full and appear in the record."""
