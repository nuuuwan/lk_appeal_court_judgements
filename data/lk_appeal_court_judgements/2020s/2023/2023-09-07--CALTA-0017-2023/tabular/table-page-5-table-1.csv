"would mean that, regardless of the decision of this court, this case will continue at the District"
"Court of Nuwara Eliya. Furthermore, as the next step in a trial such as this is to consider granting"
"of  an  interim  order  and  as  at  all  the  levels  of  the  trial,  orders  of  the  District  Court  can  be"
"appealed,  it  would  be  heavily  prejudicial  for  the  Defendant  to  have  to  travel  all  the  way  to"
"Colombo every time an appeal is filed by the Petitioner when an appeal can just as easily lie to"
"a  court  that  is  much  closer  to  the  land  (tea  estate)  in  question.  Thus,  it  would  cause  undue"
"hardships to the Defendant if this case is heard by the Court of Appeal."
"I will now briefly analyse the discretion given to the Court of Appeal to transfer the cases to the"
"relevant Provincial High Court exercising Civil appellate jurisdiction under the Act No. 19 of"
"1990 as amended."
"The Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to transfer the case to an appropriate Provincial High"
"Court  under  Section  5D(1)  [reproduced  below]  of  the  High  Court  of  Provinces  (Special"
"Provinces) Act No. 19 of 1990 as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006"
"Section 5D(1) Where any appeal or application in respect of which the jurisdiction is"
"granted to a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution by section 5A of"
"this Act is filed in the Court of Appeal, such appeal or application, as the case may be"
"transferred  for  hearing  and  determination  to  an  appropriate  High  Court  as  may  be"
"determined by the President of the Court of Appeal and upon such reference, the said"
"High Court shall hear and determine such appeal or the application, as the case may be,"
"as if such appeal or application was directly made to such High Court."
"Therefore, it is my considered opinion that since the introduction of the High Court of Provinces"
"(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006 the Court of Appeal"
"should be cautious in exercising the concurrent jurisdiction it shares with the Provincial High"
"Court.  If  the  Court  of  Appeal  allows  all  appeals  filed  by  Petitioners  purely  because  of  their"
"counsel being in Colombo or for a supposed convenience of the Petitioner alone, then that would"
"open a flood gate of litigation in Court of Appeal, which would severely reduce the effectivity of"
"the Provincial High Court system introduced under Act No. 19 of 1990 (as amended). The sole"
"purpose of introducing Section 5D(1) and Section 12(a) in Act No. 19 of 1990 is to avoid this"
"practice."
"As such the Court of Appeal has discretion to transfer cases to the Provincial High Court where"
"any appeal or application in respect of cases for which the jurisdiction granted to a High Court"
"established by Article 154P of the Constitution read with section 5A of Act No. 19 of 1990 is"
