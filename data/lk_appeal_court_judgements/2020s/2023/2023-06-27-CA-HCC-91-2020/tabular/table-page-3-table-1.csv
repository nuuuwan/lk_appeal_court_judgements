"","Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Accused preferred"
"","this appeal to this Court. The Learned Counsel appearing for the Accused submitted the"
"following grounds of appeal:",""
"Ground of Appeal",""
"","a.  The  learned  trial  judge  of  the  high  Court  has  failed  to  consider  the"
"","intrinsic infirmities of the Prosecution Case; particularly as to the charge"
"","in the indictment and the evidence of an alleged rape: and the said failure"
"","vitiates the said judgment, conviction and sentence."
"","b.  The learned trial judge of the High court has failed to appreciate that the"
"","ingredients of the offence of rape and those of the offence of grave sexual"
"","abuse  are  different;  and  therefore,  the  said  Judgment,  conviction  and"
"","sentence are bad in law."
"","c.  The learned judge of the High Court has erred in law in failing to conclude"
"","that  the  Appellant  was  not  guilty  of  the  offence  with  which  latter  was"
"","charged."
"","d.  The learned judge of the High Court  has failed to take in to account the"
"","contradictory positions of the judicial medical officer in the observations"
"","contains in “P1” and the evidence given by the said witness at the trial."
"","e.  The  said  judgment  and  conviction  are  contrary  to  law  and  the  evidence"
"","adduced  at 
the 
trial  and  hence,  are  completely  unreasonable  and"
"","unjustified  as  the  learned  High  Court  judge  has  failed  to  conclude  that"
"","there was no evidence warranting the conviction of the Appellant of the"
"","charge in the indictment; for the prosecution has failed to establish its case"
"","beyond reasonable doubt."
"f.","The  learned  trial  judge  has  misdirected  herself  by  concluding  that  the"
"","Appellant  has not denied the charged leveled against him or he has not"
"","challenged  the  evidence  led  by  the  prosecution  by  establishing  that  the"
"","same is false evidence."
