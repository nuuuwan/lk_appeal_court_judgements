"“It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial judge who hears and"
"sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal. The findings of this case are based"
"largely on credibility of witnesses. I am therefore of the view that there was no reasonable"
"basis upon which the court of appeal could have reserved the findings of the trial judge”"
