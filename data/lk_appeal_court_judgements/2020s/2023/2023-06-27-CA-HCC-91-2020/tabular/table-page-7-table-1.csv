"truthful witness."
"G
enerally, where  the  prosecution evidence  is based on a single  eye witness,  our"
"courts have insisted upon corroboration."
"In Sunil and Another vs. Attorney General 1986 1 SLR 230,"
"“Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring corroboration"
"is otherwise credible. If the evidence of the witness requiring corroboration is not credible"
"his  testimony should  be  rejected  and  the  accused  acquitted.  Seeking corroboration  of  a"
"witness’s  evidence  should  not  be  used  as  a  process  of  inducing  belief  in  such  evidence"
"where such evidence is not credible.”"
"W
hen  we  consider  the  evidence  of  the  judicial  medical  officer,  we  can  clearly"
"identify PW1 evidence was corroborated with an expert opinion, rendering her evidence"
"credible. According to the doctor who examined the prosecutrix, there were injuries to her"
"thighs and labia majora, and there was a contusion measuring at 1.5cm-2.cm on her labia"
"minora, along with some swelling and redness around the area. There was no rapture of"
"her  hymen,  nor  any  injuries  to  her  hymeneal  tissues,  therefore  there  is  no  vaginal"
"penetration. Even so, the medical officer in his expert opinion has given evidence saying"
"the injuries are likely caused by penile friction and rough contact around the area."
"A
s  the  evidence  of  the  prosecutrix  is  credible,  that  is  to  say  her  evidence  was"
"convinced  to  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  that  she  is  speaking  the  truth,  with  the"
"evidence of the doctor, the learned High Court Judge has no other option but to convict"
"this Accused."
"R
egarding the defence version, the Accused made a dock statement and has taken"
"up  an  alibi,  which  notably  was  not  suggested  to  PW1  or  to  her  mother  during  cross"
"examination.  The  alibi  is  merely  mentioned  by  the  Accused.  Therefore,  learned  Trial"
"Judge has correctly rejected his defence."
"W

"credibility of the witnesses. Our courts are reluctant to interfere with the findings unless"
