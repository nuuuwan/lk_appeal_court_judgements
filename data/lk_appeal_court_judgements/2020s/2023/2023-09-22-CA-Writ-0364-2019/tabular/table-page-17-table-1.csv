"nominee,  Dr.  P.  Lakshaman  and  Mr.  S.  Rangarajah,  both 
the  Council"
"Nominees, Mrs D. Thabotharan, Head/ AHS (as an observer). Accordingly,"
"the subcommittee comprises the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, the Heads"
"of the Pathology and Biochemistry departments, one other academic, and two"
"other members. The Vice-Chancellor, who is also an academic, had been the"
"Chairperson.  The  post  in  question  was  in  the  Medical  Faculty,  and  it  is"
"apparent 
that 
the  majority  of 
the  members  are  from 
that  faculty.  The"
"qualifications of the four applicants had been evaluated by this subcommittee"
"as well and recommended that only the 37th Respondent is eligible to be called"
"for an interview and none other."
"T
he  Petitioner’s  argument 
that 
the 
subcommittee 
that 
short-listed 
the"
"applicants  who  should  be  called  for  the  interview  did  not  consist  of  any"
"medical academic, medical professional allied health science professional is"
"defeated by his own document, the annexure to ‘P 12’."
"T
he Petitioner submitted to this Court a comparison between the curriculum"
"of the degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences and the degree in Agricultural"
"Science,  prepared  by  him,  marked  as  ‘P  7’.  The  5th  and  7th  Respondents"
"submitted 
the  document  marked  ‘R  3’  containing 
the  B.Sc.  Agriculture"
"curriculum for the year 1998 and the curriculum for the Bachelor of Science"
"degree  in  Medical  Laboratory  Sciences  marked  ‘R  4’.  However,  as  it  was"
"correctly observed by the USAB, this Court also does not have the expertise"
"to  pronounce  upon 
the  relevancy  of 
the  subjects  without  any  external"
"assistance  such  as  expert  evidence. This  Court  lacks  such  evidence  in  this"
"application. Therefore, as it was observed by Professor Wade in his treatise"
"Administrative Law and in the judicial precedence of this country which I have"
"cited above in this judgment, it is best for this Court to leave it to competent"
"personnel."
"T
he 5th and 7th Respondents also submitted a report prepared by the Head of"
"the Unit of Allied Health Science Ms. D. Thabotharn (‘R 2’) on the relevancy"
"of the B.Sc. Agriculture degree to the B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Sciences"
"curriculum.  Based  on  the  analysis,  the  Head  of  the  unit  of Allied  Health"
"Sciences has expressed the view that most of the subjects in the agriculture"
"curriculum deal with plants, cultivation, crops, seeds, weeds, animals, poultry,"
"dairy, meat, fish production, soil science, and food science whereas, the M.Sc."
"in Medical Laboratory Sciences curriculum deal with the Laboratory analysis"
