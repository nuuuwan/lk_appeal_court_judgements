"analysed.  The  Petitioner  stated  that  this  should  have  been  done  before  the"
"selection was made."
"T
he  Petitioner  being  aggrieved  by 
the  decision  of 
the  Council  of 
the"
"University of Jaffna, appointing the 37th Respondent to the position of Senior"
"Lecturer  (Grade  II)  in  Medical  Laboratory  Sciences  and  not  calling  the"
"Petitioner  for  the  interview,  has  lodged  a  complaint  with  the  University"
"Services Appeals Board, (hereinafter referred to as the ‘USAB’) initially and"
"thereafter, on the direction of the USAB has submitted a formal appeal on the"
"13th of March 2017 (‘P 12’). The USAB has inquired into the appeal and by"
"its  order  dated  7th  of  May  2019  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Petitioner."
"According to the Petitioner, the reasons provided in the Order dismissing the"
"appeal was that ‘the USAB has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to"
"pronounce 
the  correctness  of 
the  University  authorities.  There 
is  no"
"irregularity or illegality in respect of the decision’ (‘P 17’)."
"T
he Petitioner alleges that the Order of the USAB contains only re-production"
"of  what 
transpired  at 
the 
inquiry  and 
there  were  no 
its  own  findings"
"whatsoever. Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  contended  that  the  USAB  failed  to"
"consider the evidence as well as the documents filed before it. Consequently,"
"the Petitioner submitted that the order of the USAB is arbitrary, capricious,"
"mala fide, and against the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner."
