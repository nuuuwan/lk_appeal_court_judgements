"In the case of Ranasinghe Vs. The Attorney General (2007) 1 SLR 218, the"
"accused-appellant was convicted for the murder of his mother-in-law and was"
"sentenced  to  death.  On  appeal,  it  was  contended  that  the  trial  Judge  has  not"
"considered the inherent weaknesses of a dying declaration."
"Held:"
"1. When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence against"
"an accused person in a  criminal trial, the trial judge or the jury must bear"
"in mind the following weaknesses."
"a.  The statement of the deceased person was not made under oath."
"b.  The  statement  of  the  deceased  has  not  been  tested  by  cross-"
"examination."
"2. The trial Judge or jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the"
"following matters."
"a. Whether the deceased in fact made such a statement."
"b. Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and"
"accurate."
"c.  Whether the statement made by the deceased could be accepted"
"beyond reasonable doubt."
"d.  Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying"
"declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt."
"e.  Whether the witness is telling the truth."
"f.  Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged"
"declaration was made."
"The  evidence  of  PW-12  clearly  indicates  that  he  has  not  recorded  what  the"
"deceased told him in its exact words, but has recorded it in his own words. I am"
"of the view that such a recording would not qualify as a dying declaration made"
