"I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has over relied on the evidence"
"of  PW-12  despite  the  obvious  drawbacks  of  his  recording  of  the  alleged  dying"
"declaration to justify the infirmities in that relation."
"I am in no position to agree that there was  evidence corroborating the alleged"
"dying  declaration  when  in  fact  there  was  no  evidence  which  proves  beyond"
"reasonable  doubt  that  the  post-conduct  of  the  appellant  amounts  to  any"
"corroboration of the dying declaration."
"I find that if the evidence of PW-01, PW-03 and that of PW-12 was considered in"
"its correct perspective, there was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to"
"determine that the prosecution has proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt"
"against the appellant."
"For the reasons as set out above, I find strong merit in the grounds of appeal"
"urged by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel, and is of the view that the prosecution"
"has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt."
"Accordingly, I allow the appeal of the appellant and set aside the conviction and"
"the sentence dated 17-12-2021 by the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota."
"The appellant is acquitted of the charge preferred against him."
