"circumstances in itself do not establish guilt."
"In the case of Queen Vs. M. G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350, it was held,"
"“Suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt, nor does the proof of any"
"number of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its burden of"
"proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and compel"
"the  accused  to  give  evidence  or  call  evidence.  We  are  unable  to  reconcile"
"what the learned Judge said earlier in his summing up with what he said"
"in  the  passage  to  which  exception  is  taken.  The  burden  of  establishing"
"circumstances which not only establishes the accused’s guilt but are also"
"inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution throughout the"
"trial.”"
