"state.  The scope of the inquiry before the Magistrate court is limited to strictly two grounds, (i) He"
"has no jurisdiction to go beyond what has been mandated by the Act; and (ii) the Magistrate should"
"not call evidence from the competent authority in support of the Application."
"In  view  of  the  aforesaid,  the  technical  objection  raised  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent-Petitioner-"
"Appellant in terms of section 3(1)(b) of the Act on the requirements of 30  daysâ€™ notice does not"
"absolve the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant of his liability for not vacating the state land as required"
"by the Quit Notice."
"Therefore,  the  learned Magistrate  has  correctly  held  with  Applicant-Respondent-Respondent  and"
"made an order to eject the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant from the impugned premises."
"As such, I hold that the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant did not have any exceptional grounds to"
"invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Kegalle to revise the order of the learned"
"Magistrate dated 17.09.2015."
"Thus,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  correctly  dismissed  the  application  of  the  Respondent-"
"Petitioner-Appellant. We see no reason for this court to interfere with the said order of the learned"
"Magistrate  Court  Judge  dated  17.09.2015  and  order  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  dated"
"09.08.2018."
"Therefore, this appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000."
