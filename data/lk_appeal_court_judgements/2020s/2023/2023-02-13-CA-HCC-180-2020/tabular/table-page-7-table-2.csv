"It is clear from the indictment that the learned High Court Judge had amended"
"the  penal  sections  of  the  charges  accordingly  to  read  as  section  5(2)  of  the"
"Offences Against Public Property Act. I do not find any reason to disagree with"
"the procedure adopted by the learned High Court Judge as it has been provided"
"for in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"However,  the  issue  arises  when  reading  what  was  stated  in  the  judgement  as"
"contended  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant.  It  is  clear  that  when  the"
"learned  prosecuting  State  Counsel  made  the  application  to  amend  the  penal"
"section of the charges, the judgement has already been prepared and ready to"
"be pronounced on that day, as it was the date fixed for the pronouncement of"
"the judgement. It appears that after the said amendment was made, read and"
"explained  to  the  accused,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  straight  away"
"proceeded to pronounce the judgement."
"In  the  judgement  which  appears  on  page  451  of  the  appeal  brief,  the  learned"
"High Court Judge has commenced by reproducing the nine charges under which"
"the appellant was indicted as stated in the original indictment upon which the"
"trial proceeded to its conclusion, where the penal section has been mentioned as"
"section 5(1) of the Offences Against Public Property Act."
"Section 5(1) of the Offences Against Public Property Act is the section whether a"
"person misappropriates or causes the criminal breach of trust in relation to a"
"public property can be punished."
"As  the  Penal  sections  of  the  nine  charges  had  been  amended  by  the  time  the"
"judgement  was  pronounced,  the  judgement  should  mention  the  nine  charges"
