"When considering the evidence placed before the Court, it is apparent that the"
"appellant had been arrested not while committing the act but subsequently on"
"a tip-off. There had been no identification parade held to identify the appellant"
"by the officers of the bank who transacted with him. Only a dock identification"
"has been made. As pointed out at the hearing of this appeal, the prosecution has"
"merely asked the witnesses to identify the appellant without first clarifying from"
"whether  they  are  in  a  position  to  identify  the  person  who  pawned  jewellery,  if"
"seen again and the basis for such an identification. As there is a tendency for a"
"witness to believe that the accused person may be the person who committed"
"the crime, such a dock identification is highly unreliable which cannot be a basis"
"for a conviction."
"Although the indictment speaks about a one single officer being cheated on all"
"nine occasions, the evidence had been that apart from five occasions, two other"
"officers also have been cheated. It appears that in the indictment, it has been"
"only mentioned that one bank official has been cheated on all nine occasions."
"Given  the  time  period  that  has  lapsed  and  the  mentioned  infirmities  in  the"
"evidence and the investigations, I am of the view that this is not a fit and a proper"
"case to send for a retrial."
"Therefore, I acquit the appellant of the charges preferred against him."
"The appeal allowed."
