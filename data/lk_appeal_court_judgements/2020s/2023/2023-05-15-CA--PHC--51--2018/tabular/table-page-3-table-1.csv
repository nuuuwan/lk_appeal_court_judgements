"The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having satisfied that there"
"was a breach of peace threatened or likely to be threatened due to a dispute over a roadway,"
"issued notice on the 1st and 2nd Respondents."
"It was alleged by the Petitioners that both Respondents had obstructed the roadway which"
"was  used  by  the  Petitioners  and  their  predecessors  for  more  than  70  years  to  go  to  their"
"cultivated lands and houses. The portion of the disputed road was seized and narrowed by"
"erecting concrete poles by the Respondents."
"The  learned  Magistrate  had  taken  up  the  matter  for  inquiry  and  allowed  parties  to  file"
"Affidavits and Counter Affidavits with annexed documents and also written submissions."
"It was the position taken up by the Respondents that they had not obstructed the impugned"
"roadway and had stated that the Petitioners had never used a roadway as referred to in their"
"affidavit and the Petitioners had only used a footpath."
"The learned Magistrate delivered the Order on 15.09.2015 in favor of the Petitioners and"
"directed the Respondents to remove all obstructions caused by them."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order,  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondent–Petitioners  had  moved  in"
"Revision  to  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Sabaragamuwa  holden  in  Ratnapura  seeking  to"
"revise or set aside the said Order of the learned Magistrate."
"Apparently, the learned High Court Judge having considered the Revision application, held"
"against  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondent–Petitioners  and  affirmed  the  Order  of  the  learned"
"Magistrate dated 15.09.2015."
"The 1st and 2nd Respondent – Petitioner - Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the"
"“Appellants”), being dissatisfied with the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, had"
"preferred this appeal praying to set aside the Order dated 04.01.2018 by the learned High"
"Court Judge and the Order dated 15.09.2015 of the learned Magistrate,"
"It is noteworthy that the Appellants have prayed for a declaration that 1st – 6th Petitioner –"
"Respondent– Respondents are entitled to use the disputed roadway as a footpath. Therefore,"
"the dispute among the parties is relating to a roadway which is in existence."
"As such, the learned Magistrate had correctly dealt with the matter and decided in terms of"
"Section 69(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"In terms of Section 69(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, it is the duty of the Primary"
"Court Judge to determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject of the dispute"
"and make an Order under Section 69(2)."
