"The main relief sought by the Petitioner in this Application is for a declaration"
"that, the cancelation of the lease agreement is bad in law and seeking to issue"
"a Writ of Certiorari to quash the same. The said lease agreement was cancelled"
"on the basis that the Petitioner failed to pay the rent. It appears to this Court"
"that,  the  central  issue  to  be  determined  in  this  Application  is  whether  the"
"Petitioner  has  violated  the  terms  of  the  said  lease  agreement.    Hence  it  is"
"abundantly  clear  that  the  facts  are  in  dispute.  Wherefore  to  establish  the"
"contention of the Petitioner and the Respondent pertaining to the purported"
"violation of the terms and conditions of the lease agreement these issues are"
"to  be  established  through  oral  and  documentary  evidence  before  the  trial"
"court where the original civil jurisdiction lies."
"I
n this regard, I refer to the judgment of Thajudeen Vs. Sri-Lanka Tea Board5"
"where the Court of Appeal held that;"
"“
Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts is subject"
"to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a"
"suit where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses"
"so that the Court would be better able to judge which version is correct, a Writ"
"will  not  issue.  Mandamus  is  pre-eminently  a  discretionary  remedy.  It  is  an"
"extraordinary, residuary and suppletory remedy to be granted only when there"
"are no other means of obtaining justice. Even though all other requirements for"
"securing the remedy have been satisfied by the applicant, the Court will decline"
"to  exercise  its  discretion  in  his  favour  if  a  specific  alternative  remedy  like  a"
"regular action equally convenient, beneficial, and effective is available.”"
"F
or the foregoing reasons, I uphold the preliminary objection and accordingly,"
"dismiss the Application with cost of Rs. 75,000/-."
