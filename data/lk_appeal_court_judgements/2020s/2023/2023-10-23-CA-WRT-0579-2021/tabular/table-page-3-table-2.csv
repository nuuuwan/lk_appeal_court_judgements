"ex  parte  London  Electricity  Joint  Committee  Co  (1920)  Ltd:  CA  1923"
"Atkin LJ described the scope of the prerogative Writs."
"“writs deal with questions of excessive jurisdiction, and doubtless in their"
"origin dealt almost exclusively with the jurisdiction of what is described"
"in ordinary parlance as a Court of Justice. But the operation of the writs"
"has extended to control the proceedings of bodies which do not claim to"
"be,  and  would  not  be  recognized  as,  Courts  of  Justice.  Wherever  any"
"body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting"
"the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess"
"of  their  legal  authority  they  are subject  to  the controlling jurisdiction of"
"the King’s Bench Division exercised in these writs.”"
