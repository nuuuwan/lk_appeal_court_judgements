"Although the law of trust is not directly involved in the issues of the instant Application, I"
"observe  that  a  trust  is  generally  considered  as  a  fiduciary  relationship  in  which  one  party"
"known as a trustor gives another party, the trustee; the right to hold title to property or assets"
"for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary. The Clause 34 of the constitution of the Fund"
"stipulates that all investments, all its earnings and income should be kept under safe custody"
"by the Board as the sole guardian of the said trust."
