"It is abundantly clear that the property of the Statutory Boards and Public Corporations are"
"within  the  definition  of  ‘public  property’  under  the  said  Act.  The  said  Board  has  been"
"incorporated by virtue of the Coconut Development Act No. 46 of 1971 (as amended). Thus,"
"it is no doubt that the money belonging to the Board is well within the purview of the Act and"
"the dicta of the above judgement has no relevancy to the instant Application. Anyhow, the"
"issue here is whether the money held by the Board in the capacity as a trustee or as a guardian"
"would become ‘public property’ under the Act. Both, the learned President’s Counsel for the"
"Petitioner and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents made submissions"
"on the above point of law. Now, I must consider whether this Court could resolve this issue"
"at this threshold stage without calling for affidavits of the Respondents."
