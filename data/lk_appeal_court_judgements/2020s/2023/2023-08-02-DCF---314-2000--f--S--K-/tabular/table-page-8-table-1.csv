"According to the said report Y1 it seems that the surveyor Mr. Ramakrishnan had not properly"
"identified the subject land and its boundaries. It seems to me that, instead Mr. Ramakrishnan had"
"just  indicated  the  boundaries  as  informed  by  the  Plaintiffs  to  match  the  land  described  in  the"
"schedule to the Plaint and also the land described in the Plaintiffs’ title deeds."
"It is in evidence that the Plaintiffs were unaware of the identity of the subject land since they did"
"not know the boundaries of their land described in the schedule to the Plaint."
"It is apparent that the surveyor had surveyed the land where the Defendants were in possession"
"and named the four boundaries according to the Plaintiff’s title deeds and the land described in"
"the schedule to the Plaint in order to fit into the Defendant’s land in the instant case."
"The learned District judge did not consider why the Plaintiffs moved for a 2nd commission or why"
"the surveyor disregarded the application for super imposition."
"It is pertinent to note, that the Plaintiffs had not called the said surveyor Mr. Ramakrishnan to"
"adduce evidence and explained about executing of the said two commissions and prepared plans"
"X and Y, and reports X1 and Y1 respectively."
"The burden of proving the identity of the land and proving the title claimed by the Plaintiffs rests"
"squarely and fairly with the Plaintiffs."
"It is well settled law that in a vindicatory action the burden of proof rests upon the Plaintiffs to"
"prove his title including the identity of the boundaries."
"However, it is clear that the Plaintiffs had failed to identify the land described in the schedule to"
"the Plaint. As such, Plaintiffs’ action should fail on that ground alone."
"Although the learned Trial Judge pronounced a lengthy judgement of about 33 pages, the only"
"form of analysis of the burden of proof of the Plaintiffs’ case is only confined to the last three pages."
