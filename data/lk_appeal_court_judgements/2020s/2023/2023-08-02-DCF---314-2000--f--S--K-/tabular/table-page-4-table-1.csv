"Judgement"
"The Plaintiff instituted an action bearing no 4221/L in the District court of the Ratnapura seeking"
"a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the Plaint. Plaintiffs had sought an"
"interim injunction in the first instance and a permanent injunction, restraining the Defendant and"
"his servants, agents and anyone coming under him from gemming in the said land, until the final"
"determination of this case."
"It appears that the application for interim injunction was supported on 11.07.1980 and the court"
"granted  an interim injunction ex-parte and issued notice on the  Defendant. Consequently, the"
"Defendantâ€™s  proxy  was  filed  on  11.07.1980  and  he  had  objected  to  the  issuance  of  interim"
"injunction. However, interim injunction was not dissolved by the learned District Judge."
"It  is  to  be  noted  that  on  16.03.1980  counsel  for  the  Plaintiffs  had  moved  for  a  commission  to"
"survey the land claimed by the Plaintiffs."
"At this stage counsel for the Defendant had informed court that the land which the Defendant"
"claims and is in possession is depicted in plan bearing no 416 dated 22.08.1980.The counsel for"
"the Defendant had made an application to super impose the said plan on the commissioned plan"
"moved by the Plaintiffs."
"The said Commission was returned by the licensed surveyor S. Ramakrishan with plan bearing no"
"1436 dated 29.12.1980 to court."
"The said 1st commissioned plan and the report was marked and produced in evidence as X and X1"
"respectively."
"Although the counsel for the Defendant moved to super impose the said plan bearing no. 416"
"dated 22.08.1980, which depicts the land claimed by the Defendant - it was not super imposed"
