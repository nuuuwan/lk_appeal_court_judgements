"Act No 65 of 2009 Forest Ordinance (Amendment) Section 25 (2) A specially refers to  “Any"
"person who allows” the use of vehicles to be found culpable. It is my view that the prosecution"
"did  not  in  any  manner  find  the  Appellant  to  have  ""allowed""  his  vehicle  to  be  used  in  the"
"commission of the offence. The prosecution did not deem him to be culpable resulting in him"
"not being charged."
"The Appellant was not charged under section 25(3) of the said act for aiding and abetting in"
"the commission of the offence. This in itself is ex facie evidence that the Registered owner had"
"no knowledge of the offence being committed."
"As  mentioned  earlier  in  Atapattu  Mudiyanselage  Sadi  Banda  and  3  others  vs.  Officer-in-"
