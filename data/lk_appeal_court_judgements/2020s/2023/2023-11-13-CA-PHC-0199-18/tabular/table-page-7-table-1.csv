"As  such, the  legislature has  unequivocally  cast  a  burden  on  a  claimant of  a  vehicle  inquiry"
"under the Forest Ordinance to dispense the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the Court"
"that he, having ownership of the vehicle concerned, had taken all precautions to prevent the"
"use of such vehicle for the commission of the offence. It must be noted that the requirement"
"of proving that all precautionary measures have been taken by such third party making a claim"
"against a confiscation, is unique to the Forest Ordinance in comparison with other legislations"
"with 
similar  provisions  at 
this 
juncture, 
the 
following  observation 
in 
Samarasinghe"
"Dharmasena  vs.  W.  P.  Wanigasinghe  CA(PHC)  197/2013  CA  Minute  dated  22.01.2019 
is"
"applicable;"
"""..it is well settled law that in a vehicle inquiry the claimant has to discharge his burden"
"on  a  balance  of  probability.  According  to  section  40  of  the  Forest  Ordinance  (as"
"amended) it is mandatory to prove on a balance of probability that the owner took"
"every possible precaution to prevent the vehicle being used for an illegal activity....it is"
"amply clear that simply giving instructions to the driver is insufficient to discharge the"
"burden cast on a vehicle owner. """
"Therefore,  ""merely  giving 
instructions  alone  will  not  fall  under  the  possible  preventive"
"measures  ought  to  be  taken  by  a  vehicle  owner""  CA-PHC-139-15  Page  8  of  10,  dated"
"20/09/2022."
"As held in S. D. N. Premasiri vs. Officer in Charge, Mawathagama CA (PHC) 46/2015 Court of"
"Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018 ""...it is imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that"
"the vehicle owner in question has not only given instructions but also has taken every possible"
"step to implement them""."
"In Cadar Bawa Jennathul Farida vs Range Forest Officer and Others C.A PHC 94/2017 minute"
"dated 05.07.2019, it was held that;"
""" it is trite law that mere giving instruction is not sufficient to discharge the burden"
"cast on a vehicle owner under the Forest Ordinance."""
"The Act does not mean that the owner of vehicle should sit beside the vehicle round the clock"
"and should control all the activities of the driver. The burden cast upon the owner is to prove"
"to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such"
"vehicle for the commission of the offence."
