"be  almost  practically  impossible  for  the  prosecution  to  disprove  them  for  such  facts  are"
"virtually although, perhaps, not exclusively within personal knowledge of the appellant."
"The vehicle shall necessarily be confiscated if the owner fails to prove that the offence was"
"committed without the knowledge but not otherwise. If, as contended by the learned Counsel"
"for the respondent, the Magistrate was given a discretion to consider whether to confiscate"
"or not - the Magistrate could confiscate even when the offence was committed without the"
"knowledge of the owner taking into consideration other damnable circumstances apart from"
"the knowledge or lack of it on the part of the owner. The arguments too can recoil on the"
"profounder.  That  argument  was  an  invitation  to  confiscate  for  that  would  have  been  the"
"necessary and inexorable consequence of the acceptance of that argument."
"It is important to note that the judgement of the learned Magistrate and the learned High"
"Court Judge had caused a higher loss to the appellant who is not even a part to the case, than"
"the punishment prescribed for those who engaged in the offence and to those who aided and"
"abetted. Therefore, the order confiscating the said vehicle is unreasonable and unjust on the"
"face of it, as it had caused an undue loss for an innocent third party."
"It  is  my  view  that  the  said  order  is  contrary  to  the  principles  of  natural  justice  due  to  its"
"inequitable nature. At the same time, it is not proportionate to the offence, since the value of"
"the vehicle exceeds both the maximum value of the fine prescribed in the Forest Ordinance"
"and the value of the alleged stock of timber. Considering the above facts, the order of the"
"Learned Magistrate is errored in fact as well as errored in law."
"I decide to make that on the totality of the evidence led at the inquiry before the learned"
"Magistrate it ought to have been held, in the least, that it was more probable than not that"
"the relevant offence was committed without the appellant's knowledge. One cannot let one's"
"prejudices influence the judgment of the case. They may be sinners; perhaps, of that there is"
"no mistaking of course, according to my thinking. But a Judge has to recompense even evil"
"with justice."
"The appeal is allowed and the order made by the learned High Court judge on  25.10.2018"
"upholding  the  learned  Magistrate's  order  dated  09.02.2018  is  hereby  vacated.  The  lorry"
"numbered 47-8525 is ordered to be returned to the appellant immediately."
"Appeal allowed. No order for cost."
