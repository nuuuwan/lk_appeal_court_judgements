"circumstances  of  the  case.  The  extent  and  the  limitations  of  the  precautions  would  vary"
"between cases where the owner himself actively engages in the business for which the vehicle"
"is  used  and  the  owner  simply  hires  his  vehicles  for  business  purposes  without  actively"
"engaging in such activities. The fact whether the vehicle is given for hire or used for private"
"purposes or any other business purpose should also be taken into consideration."
"Due to those circumstantial differences, an equal level of precaution should not be expected"
"from a vehicle owner. It is evident that the vehicle owner in this matter had a very limited"
"control over the vehicle which in turn limits his capacity to take precautionary measures and"
"the  Learned  Magistrate  should  not  have  expected  higher  degree  of  precautions  which  is"
"impractical under these circumstances."
"The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the owner of the vehicle is a businessman."
"He had purchased the vehicle for the purpose of his business. The accused person was working"
"as a driver for the past few years and never have engaged in any illegal activity. Therefore,"
"there  was  no  reason  for  the  appellant  to  suspect  the  accused  driver  by  any  means.  The"
"accused driver takes the vehicle for external hires with the permission of the owner. This has"
"been an ordinary practice, and therefore raised no doubts on the mind of the appellant about"
"such activity."
"The learned Judge of the Provincial High Court has erred in refusing to follow the judgement"
"of Court of Appeal in case number CA (PHC) Appeal Number 03/2013, which is relevant to the"
"circumstances of the present matter."
"The  appellant  urged  the  learned  High  Court  judge  to  follow  the  judgement  of  this  Court"
"delivered in Atapattu Mudiyanselage Sadi Banda vs OIC Police Station Norton Bridge CA (PHC)"
"Appeal No 03/2013 decided on 25.07.2014 due to its factual similarity. In that case following"
"circumstances have been considered by this court on the order of confiscation"
