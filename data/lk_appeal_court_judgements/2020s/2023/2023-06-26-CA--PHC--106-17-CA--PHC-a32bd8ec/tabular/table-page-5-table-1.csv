"Appellants, the 1st Respondent had begun his own business namely an ‘Air BnB’ rental hotel"
"and had begun to rent out rooms to tourists."
"In this instance, it is significant to note that after hotel ‘Jessica Beach Anjelo’ was destroyed"
"by Tsunami disaster on 26.02.2004, Appellant had visited Sri Lanka on 28.01.2016, only 11"
"years from the date of the Tsunami. As the hotel building ‘Jessica Beach Angelo’ was destroyed"
"due to Tsunami disaster there was nothing left to look after other than the land in dispute by"
"the 1st Respondent-Power of Attorney holder under the impugned Power of Attorney."
"There  was  no  evidence  to  support  that  after  the  destruction  of  the  hotel  building  ‘Jessica"
"Beach Anjelo’ the Appellants had constructed another building to continue the hotel business."
"It is worthy to note that the Respondents in Primary Courts of Tangalle, took up the position"
"that the Respondents have been in possession of the impugned land in dispute, and that they"
"have been carrying on a hotel business therein namely ‘Tangalle Beach Paradise Villa’. It is"
"apparent that on 22.02.2016 the Respondents had been forcibly evicted by the Appellants"
"from the said hotel."
"The Appellants had submitted that 1st Respondent being the Power of Attorney holder is an"
"agent  of  the  1st  Appellant.  However,  the  1st  Respondent  had  been  acting  against  the"
"instructions of the Appellant and going against his capacity as an agent by starting his own"
"business on a hotel and renting out rooms without the permission of the Appellant."
"Therefore,  the  Appellants  had  contended  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  failed  to"
"consider the fact that ‘principal is in possession through his agent and the agent cannot assert"
"against the principal that the agent is in possession on his own right."
"In this respect, the court draws attention to the position taken up by the 1st Respondent in the"
"instant case."
"After the original building was destroyed (the building carrying out the business of ‘Jessica"
"Beach  Anjelo’)  on  26.12.2004  from  Tsunami,  the  1st  Appellant  had  informed  the  1st"
"Respondent to vacate the disputed land. The 1st Respondent had not acceded to the request,"
"and subsequently the 1st Appellant had left the country."
"Thereafter, the 1st Respondent had built a complete hotel on the subject land namely ‘Tangalle"
"Breach Paradise Villa’. Therefore, it is clear that despite the objection of the Appellants the 1st"
"Respondent has been in adverse possession of the land in dispute and built hotel Tangalle"
"Beach Paradise Villa."
