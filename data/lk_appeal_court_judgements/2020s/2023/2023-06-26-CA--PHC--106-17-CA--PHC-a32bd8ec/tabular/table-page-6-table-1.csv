"As  such, 
the  principal  and  agent  relationship  between 
the  1st  Appellant  and 
the  1st"
"Respondent before Tsunami regarding the hotel business “Jessica Beach Anjelo” had come to"
"an end due to the destruction of the hotel building."
"In  any  event,  the  learned  Primary  Court  Judge  cannot  determine  on  the  existence  of  a"
"Principal-Agent  relationship  between 
the  1st  Appellant  and 
the  1st  Respondent 
in  an"
"application under section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act no 44 of 1979. It is a matter"
"which solely rests within the competent jurisdiction of a civil court."
"As such, if the 1st Appellant has any right to the subject matter of the instant action, it has to"
"be  adjudicated  by  a court  exercising  competent  civil  jurisdiction.  It  is  observable  that  the"
"learned High Court Judge in her judgement had urged the Parties to determine rights over"
"the subject matter in a competent civil court."
"It was submitted that after several years later the  1st Appellant had come  to Tangalle  and"
"stayed in the hotel run by the 1st Respondent and the 1st Appellant had paid for the stay and"
"did not raise any dispute regarding the rights of the hotel."
"On 28.01.2016 the 1st and 2nd Appellants and the 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent"
"[hereinafter referred to as the 3rd Respondent] had visited the said hotel and quarreled with"
"the 1st and 2nd Respondents stating that the Appellants also have a right to the hotel. Later the"
"Appellants apologized for their behavior and wanted to reserve three rooms."
"Since there were no rooms available at that time Appellants were referred to another hotel."
"It  seems  that  the  Appellants  and  the  3rd  Respondent  had  again  visited  the  said  hotel  on"
"08.02.2016 and booked three rooms to stay for 14 days."
"While staying at the hotel, the Appellants and the 3rd Respondent quarreled with the 1st and"
"2nd Respondents on the  assumption that they also have a right to the impugned hotel and"
"demanded the Respondents to hand over the hotel to them."
"It was submitted by the Respondents that the Appellants and the 3rd Respondent did not leave"
"the hotel after 14 days as agreed upon on 22.02.2016 and thereby 1st and 2nd Respondents"
"had been forcibly dispossessed of the subject matter by the Appellants and the 3rd Respondent."
"Furthermore, the Appellants had made a Complaint to the Tangalle Police station stating that"
"the Respondents had attempted to assault them. Consequently, the Police had reported facts"
"against the Respondents under section 84 of the code of Criminal Procedure Act and under"
"these  circumstances  the  Appellants  had  illegally  taken  possession  of  the  impugned  hotel"
"premises on 22.02.2016."
