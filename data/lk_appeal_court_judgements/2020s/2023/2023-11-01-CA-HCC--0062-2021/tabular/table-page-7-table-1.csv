"E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy in his “Law of Evidence” Volume 2 Book 2 at page"
"658 has stated referring to child witness;"
"“There  is  no  requirement  in  English  law,  that  the  sworn  evidence  of  a"
"child witness needs to be corroborated as a matter of law. But the jury"
"should be warned, not to look for corroboration, but of the risks involved"
"in acting on the sole evidence of young girls and boys, though they may"
"do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence…….This requirement is"
"based on the susceptibility of children to the influence of others and to"
"the surrender to their imaginations”."
"At page 659 it states “As regards the sworn testimony of children, there"
"is no requirement as in England to warn of the risk involved in acting on"
"their sole testimony, though it may desirable to issue such  a warning,"
"though the failure to do so will generally not affect the conviction”."
