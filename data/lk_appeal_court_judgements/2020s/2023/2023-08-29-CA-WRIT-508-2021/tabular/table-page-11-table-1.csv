"Another  grievance  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  formal  disciplinary  inquiry  has  not  been"
"conducted by a public officer in terms of Clause 17.6, 17.9 and 17.7 of Chapter XLVIII of the"
"E-Code and the objection raised in that regard has not been considered by the inquiry officer."
"In a scenario where the Board of Directors of the ITN has not fully adopted all the provisions"
"of the E-Code, I am not inclined to make any decision here solely on the above provisions of"
"the E-Code. I am mindful of the fact that the E-Code, especially its' Volume II, deals with the"
"disciplinary control of all public officers other than public officers referred to in Articles 41,"
"51, 54 and 114(6) of the Constitution and members of the tri forces. I do not doubt the inherent"
"powers of this Court to consider the provisions of the E-Code in order to establish a criterion"
"that  should  have  been  adopted  during  the  process  of  decision-making  at  the  said  formal"
"disciplinary inquiry. However, based on the circumstances of this case I am not  convinced"
"that this is a fit case for me to formulate such a criterion to arrive at any finding in relation to"
"the proceedings of the said inquiry."
"Now  I  must  advert  to  inquire  into  the  assertions  of  the  Petitioner  who  claims  that  he  has"
"obtained prior approval for the ‘cricket commentary’. He relies on the contents found in the"
"documents marked 'P8' to 'P10'. The dispute in the instant application revolves around the"
"provisions of clauses 9 and 10 of the contract of employment marked 'P2A'. The issues relating"
"to legal, ethical and business strategy can be included in any contract of service and it is not a"
"novel  concept  in  the  law  of  contract.  Accordingly,  any  employee  to  agree  to  refrain  from"
"engaging or participating in another undertaking or activity which competes with the current"
"employment or business is a usual condition in regard to their fiduciary duty to the company."
"Such  a clause  in  the  contract  of  service  is  vital  to  any  employer.  An  employee  is  certainly"
"bound by a non-compete clause, provided such conditions are clearly stipulated in a contract"
"of service. It is abundantly clear that clauses 9 and 10 of the contract of employment marked"
"'P2A'  comes  within  the  ambit  of  a  'non-compete  agreement'.  Thus,  obtaining  or  granting"
"approval to engage in competing activities and undertakings should be done in a responsible"
"manner by an authorized officer. Hence, the defense taken by the Petitioner relying on the"
"documents 'P8' to 'P10' cannot be accepted as such documents do not disclose any lawfully"
"granted  approval  by  an  appropriate  authority.  No  sustainable  nexus  is  seen  between  the"
"Working  Director  who  has  placed  an  endorsement  on  ‘P9’  and  the  absolute  management"
"authority of ITN."
