"considering all such judgments, including the decision in  Devendra Budalge Sudesh Lalitha"
"Perera  case,  has  decided  in  the  said  W.  G.  Chamila  case  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  the"
"discretionary  power  to  exercise  the  writ  jurisdiction  even  on  a  question  arising  out  of  a"
"contract  of  employment  if  the  disciplinary  order  of  a  public  authority  was  in  breach  of"
"statutory restrictions/provisions and also if the public authority has taken a decision assuming"
"a jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction by violating a statutory"
"requirement which eventually comes under any of the established grounds of judicial review."
"The Petitioner contends that he is entitled to come before this Court and seek relief by way of"
"writs of certiorari if there is a statutory flavour within the relationship between the parties and"
"also there exists a violation of natural justice by the public authority. Hence, it is important"
"to assess whether the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents have violated any statutory provisions or"
"rules  of  natural  justice  when  making  the  aforesaid  disciplinary  orders  in  reference  to  the"
"contract of employment between the Petitioner and the ITN."
"The Petitioner in order to justify his Application to this Court for Judicial Review submits"
"five main reasons: 1) the formal disciplinary inquiry has been conducted in a biased and unfair"
"manner, 2) the charge sheet is ex facie defective, 3) the disciplinary order dated 14.07.2021"
"marked 'P18' was issued by the 2nd Respondent, who is not the disciplinary authority, 4) the"
"prosecution failed to prove at the inquiry that the Petitioner has not obtained prior approval"
"for  the  disputed  radio  commentary,  and  5)  the  3rd  Respondent  has  failed  to  consider  the"
"objections raised by the Petitioner at the inquiry."
"The Petitioner raises the above first argument that the formal inquiry has been conducted in"
"a biased and unfair manner due to the rejection of his application at the inquiry to summon"
"Mr. Dhanushka Ramanayake (former Working Director of ITN) and similarly, allowing the"
"prosecution to give evidence based on the personal documents of the Petitioner which were"
"not  listed  under  the  list  of  documents  in  the  charge  sheet.  Nonetheless,  it  appears  that  the"
"Petitioner also has not duly listed the said Mr. Ramanayake as a witness. Now a question"
"arises whether this Court should analyze the full evidence led at the said domestic inquiry to"
"inquire  about  the  lists  of  witnesses  etc.  filed  by  parties  and  also  the  circumstances  that"
"prevailed  at  the  inquiry  stage  perhaps  upon  which  the  3rd  Respondent  Inquiry  Officer  has"
"arrived at the impugned decisions."
