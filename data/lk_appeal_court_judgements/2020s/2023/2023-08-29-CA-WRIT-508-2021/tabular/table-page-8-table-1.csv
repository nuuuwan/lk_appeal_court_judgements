"Further, the Petitioner submits that allowing the prosecution to lead evidence on his personal"
"documents without amending the list of documents would amount to a violation of Clause"
"14.8  of  Chapter  XLVIII  of  the  Establishments  Code  ('E-Code').  As  opposed  to  the  said"
"argument, 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents contend that the Board of Directors of the ITN by way"
"of a board resolution (see 'R5') has decided to adopt the provisions of Volume II of the E-"

"conflict  that  emanates  during  these  proceedings  between  the  1st  Respondent,  Chairman  of"
"ITN and the 2nd Respondent, General Manager upon the impugned disciplinary orders."
