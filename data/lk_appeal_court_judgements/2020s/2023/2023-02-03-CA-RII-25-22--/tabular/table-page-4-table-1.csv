"Order dated 28th October 2022 (“P5”), refused this application. As alluded to above, it was"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge’s  contention  that  Section  241(3)  required  the  personal"
"attendance of the Accused himself."
"Although  the  revision  of  the  order  “P5”  has  not  been  prayed  for  specifically,  we"
"observe that there was no necessity to do so. This is because the initial decision to try the"
"case against him in absentia, as explained below, was a nullity. It is trite law that if that"
"decision is a nullity then every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad. We wish to"
"make an observation on the order “P5”. In the light of the scheme of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure  Act,  there  is  a  discretion  conferred  on  the  High  Court  Judge  to  determine"
"whether  the  personal  attendance  of  the  accused  can  be  dispensed  with,  if  the  accused"
"makes an application seeking the same. In the facts of the instant case, the learned High"
"Court Judge does not appear to have exercised that discretion. Although the High Court"
"Judge recognises the fact that the Accused could not fly back, and thus appear personally,"
"because  he  was in  foreign  custody, as  submitted  by  his  lawyer,  the  learned  Judge  has"
"rigidly insisted on personal attendance. The circumstances of the case being such, that"
"discretion should have been exercised in his favour and an application through his lawyer"
"should have been allowed."
"The  dictum  of  his  Lordship  Sharvananda  C.J.  in  Sudharman  De  Silva  v.  The"
"Attorney General [1986] 1 SLR 9 (at p. 14) is worth pondering on:"
"“If  the  legislature  permits  an  accused who  jumps  bail  with  impunity  and  absconds  from"
"the trial against him to be defended by an attorney-at-law at such trial and gives its sanction to"
"such  a  trial,  it  can  only  be  on  the  basis  that  even  an  absconding  accused  is  entitled  to  the"
"fundamental right of being heard by an attorney-at-law at a fair trial.”"
"We are of the view that this is a case in which the learned High Court Judge could"
"have  exercised  his  discretion  under  Section  241(3)  and  permitted  the  Petitioner’s"
"Attorney-at-Law to appear on his behalf."
