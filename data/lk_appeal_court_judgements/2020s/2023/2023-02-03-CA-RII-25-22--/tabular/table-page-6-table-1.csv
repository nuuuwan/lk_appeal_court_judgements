"Petitioner had left the country in 1979 (vide page 35 of the brief - proceedings dated 13th"
"March 2007)."
"In the facts of the instant case, the Petitioner cannot and could not be deemed to"
"have “absconded”. We are of the view that without being notified or produced before any"
"Court it would be unreasonable to expect the Petitioner to be aware of such a case pending"
"against him, or that one was going to be instituted. When we perused the record, we did"
"not see any statement recorded of his either, which shows that he was not aware of the"
"case.  The  Petitioner  has  not  averred  anything  to  the  contrary.  If,  however,  there  is"
"evidence,  which  is  not  forthcoming  in  the  instant  application,  that  the  Petitioner  was"
"aware or evidence to show that it was reasonable in all the circumstances for him to have"
"known, then an inference can be drawn that he was absconding to avoid the trial."
"The facts of this case certainly qualify as an exceptional circumstance that shocks"
"the conscience of this Court  and warrants an exercise of revision. Given our conclusion"
"that there was no basis to commence the trial in absentia, it is in the interests of justice"
"that we set aside the order dated 13th March 2007 (“X6”) by which the learned High Court"
"Judge directed the case to be tried in the Petitioner’s absence under Section 241(1)(b) of"
"the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the judgment (“X14”) and sentence (“X15”) dated 10th"
"November  2016,  and  all  warrants  issued  on  the  Petitioner,  and  consequent  orders,"
"including “P5” dated 28th October 2022."
"We order trial de novo.  We remit the matter back to the High Court for trial de"
"novo against the 1st Accused (the Petitioner) namely Jayasekara Mudiyanselage Gamini"
"Jayasekara alias Jayasekara Gamini Wasantha."
"The Registrar is directed to remit the record back to the High Court of Colombo,"
"along with this judgement."
