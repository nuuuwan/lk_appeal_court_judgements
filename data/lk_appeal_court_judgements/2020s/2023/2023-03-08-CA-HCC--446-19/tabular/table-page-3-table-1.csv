"II. 
The 
learned  trial  Judge  had  failed  to  properly  analyse  the  evidence  and  to"
"consider whether the elements of the offence were proven beyond reasonable"
"doubt based on the evidence adduced"
"The  trial  commenced  on  27.07.2011  and  the  appellant  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to"
"death  on  19.03.2014.  On  appeal,  the 
judgment  and  sentence  were  set  aside  on  the"
"technicality  of  the 
learned  trial  Judge  not  adopting  section  48  of  the  Judicature  Act"
"appropriately  in  the  proceedings  and  a  Retrial  was  ordered  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  on"
"23.05.2018.  The  Retrial  commenced  on  12.11.2018  and  the 
judgment  convicting  the"
"appellant was pronounced on 01.02.2019. It is important to note that the instant appeal is"
"on the said judgment of the Retrial."
"The case for the prosecution was that the appellant was having a de facto relationship with"
"the deceased, and the appellant said the deceased ablaze in the early hours of the morning"
"on 14.04.2008. The deceased died on 18.04.2008. The prosecution was essentially based on"
"three  purported  dying  declarations  made  by  the  deceased;  one  to  PW  1  who  was  a"
"neighbour,  one  to  PW  2  who  was  a  step  sister  of  the  deceased  and  one  to  the  police"
"sergeant  PW  7  who  claims  that  a  statement  of  the  deceased  was  recorded  by  him  at  the"
"Nawagattegama Hospital on 14.04.2008 around 05.05 pm."
"It is evident that the deceased had been living together with the accused-appellant and her"
"two children. PW 1, a neighbour, lived in a house about 200 meters away. Around 12 am on"
"14.04.2008, the deceased had come running in flames towards PW 1's house, shouting that"
"""Antony"" (the Appellant) had set fire to her. PW 1 woke up on hearing the shouts, and then"
"splashed  water  on  the  deceased  to  put  out  the  fire.  Thereafter,  on  the  request  of  the"
"deceased, PW 1 had gone to the house of the step sisters of the deceased (PW 2 and PW 3)."
"They  arranged  a  lorry  from  a  neighbour,  and  took  the  deceased  to  the  Nawagattegama"
"Hospital.  The Police commenced investigations, based on the statement given by PW1. On"
"the way to the hospital,  the deceased had been speaking with her  step sisters, PW 2 and"
"PW 3."
"PW 2 gave evidence at the trial, and PW 3 gave evidence at the Retrial. At the Retrial, PW 2"
"stated that the deceased said that the appellant set fire to her and held her head with his"
"legs until she burnt."
