the  partners  and  may  at  with 
some  degree  of"

"can be separated. Even in equally owned joint ventures, the management"
"need not be equally shared22."
"In a joint venture, the parent companies contribute not only the capital, but"
"also 
the  non-capital 
resources 
such  as  material,  management,  and"
"technologies.  These  are  normally  stipulated 
in 
formal  contracts  and"
"agreements  among  the  partners.  In  addition,  there  are  also  some  other"
"resources  provided  by 
the  partners  without  contracts, 
such  as 
the"
"knowledge  and  skills  embodied 
in 
the  managers,  expertise  or  staff"
"employed by the partners."
"The  Appellant  cited  the  judgment  of  the  House  of  Lords  in  the  case  of"
"Barclays  Bank  Ltd  v  Inland  Revenue  Commissioners23  wherein  it  was"
"observed that controlling interest should mean ‘either the power to cast a"
"majority of votes according to the register or a power to cast a majority"
"taking 
into  account  vote  of  other  shareholders’  and  argued 
that 
in"
"determining whether or not have a controlling interest, the shareholding of"
"other shareholders voting together has also to be considered."
"Further,  the  Appellant  cited  Game  Group  PLC  v  Electronic  Boutique"
"Incorporated  and  Another24  where  consideration  was  given 
to 
the"
"possibility that there could be instances where the holder of more than 50%"
"of  the  shares  does  not  have  control.  Accordingly,  it  was  argued  that"
"shareholding is never looked at in isolation in order to ascertain whether a"
"shareholder  has  a  controlling  interest  and  an  individual  shareholder  can"
"still have a controlling interest with less than 50% shareholding, provided"
"collectively has more than 50% shareholding.25"
"Be that as it may, having 51% shareholding is a threshold requirement for"
"all three scenarios under clause (ii). Therefore, to succeed in a claim under"
"clause (ii), acquiring a minimum of 51% ownership of the enterprise must"
"be  proven  with  management  rights;  or  as  a  partner  or  partner  in  a  joint"
"venture."
