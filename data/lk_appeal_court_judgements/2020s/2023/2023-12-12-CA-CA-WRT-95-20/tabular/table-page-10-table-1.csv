"resignation letter marked P-9 written in her own handwriting. According"
"to  the  4th  respondent,  the  very  reason  for  resigning  from  the  petitioner"
"company was misappropriating company funds by using a bogus cheque."
"Apart from that, the 4th respondent has written the letter P-7 expressing"
"her consent to pay back any amount to the company if it is found in the"
"audit  that  she 
is 
liable  to  pay  such  amount. 
In 
letter  P-7,  the  4th"
"respondent  stated  that  she  will  resign  from  the  company  because  the"
"wrong that she has done to the company cannot be rectified. In addition,"
"in the letter P-13, the 4th respondent informed the General Manager of the"
"petitioner  company  to  deduct  from  her  gratuity  entitlement,  the  festival"
"loan  and 
the  sundry 
loan 
that  she  had  obtained.  Accordingly, 
the"
"petitioner forfeited 4th respondent’s gratuity as it was apparent that the 4th"
"respondent has misappropriated funds of the petitioner. Misappropriation"
"is  a  ground for  forfeiting  gratuity  under  Section  13  of  the  Payment  of"
"Gratuity Act. One of the arguments raised by the learned Counsel for the"
"respondents  was  that  even  with  the  consent  of  the  employee,  statutory"
"entitlement  of  gratuity  cannot  be  deducted.  That  argument  could  be"
"considered, however, not by the 3rd respondent but by the Labour Tribunal"
"because, the jurisdiction to decide the correctness of forfeiture of gratuity"
"is vested only with the Labour Tribunal. Therefore, the 3rd respondent’s"
"decision to continue with the inquiry and his  consequent  determination"
"were made without jurisdiction."
