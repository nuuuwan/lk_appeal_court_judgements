"termination of employment of the 4th respondent. As stated above, in the"
"case  of  A  Baur  and  Company  Limited  Vs.  Commissioner  of  Labour  and"
"others it was observed that the resignation submitted by the employee is"
"also one of the modes of a lawful termination of employment. Apart from"
"that, the following portion of the aforesaid Baur case clearly demonstrates"
"that irrespective of whether it was a resignation or a termination otherwise,"
"the  3rd  respondent  had  no  authority  to  determine  this  matter  because"
"determining whether Section 13 was correctly invoked or not is a matter"
"for the Labour Tribunal."
