"It is to be noted that a divisional bench of this Court or the Supreme Court"
"has not decided that the aforesaid Court of Appeal judgment is wrong. The"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  respondents  states  that  it  is  wrongly  decided."
"Since it is a judgment of the Court of Appeal and has no binding effect on"
"this bench, I wish to consider the said argument of the learned Counsel"
"for the respondents."
