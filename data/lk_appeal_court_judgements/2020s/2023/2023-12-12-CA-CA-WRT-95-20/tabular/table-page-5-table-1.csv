"this  manner  even  with  the  consent  of  the  recipient,  unless  expressly"
"permitted by law. Therefore, the aforesaid respondents submitted that the"
"certificate  issued  by  the  2nd  respondent  is  correct  in  law  and  urged  the"
"petitioner’s application to be dismissed."
"T
he  main  issue  to  be  determined  first  in  this  matter  is  whether  the"
"Commissioner of Labour has the jurisdiction to make the determination"
"contained  in  P-21.  If  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  has  jurisdiction  to"
"inquire  into  this  issue  only,  it  becomes  necessary  to  address  the  other"
"issues raised on behalf of both parties."
"T
he contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner was that 1st, 2nd"
"or 3rd respondents have no jurisdiction to consider  the issue of whether"
"forfeiture of gratuity is correctly done and the jurisdiction has been vested"
"with the Labour Tribunal by the amendment introduced to the Payment of"
"Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 (as amended by Acts No. 41 of 1990 and No."
"62 of 1992)."
"T
he contention of the learned Counsel for the 1st to 3rd and 5th respondents"
"was that Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act has no application to"
"the payment of gratuity in respect of the 4th respondent because Section"
"13 applies when an employee’s services were terminated by the employer"
"on  disciplinary  grounds  and  not  when  an  employee  has  resigned  from"
"employment as in this case."
"D
isregarding the objection taken by the petitioner, the 3rd respondent, the"
"Labour Officer continued with the inquiry and determination was made on"
"the basis that he has jurisdiction to inquire and determine this matter as"
"there was no termination of employment of the 4th respondent."
