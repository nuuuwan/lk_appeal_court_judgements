"The balance undevided 2/3rd from the subject land was bought by the said B.A. Gaimini the"
"Appellant from the heirs of another owner."
"In the year 1990, one Heenbanda made a complaint to the police station against B.A Gamini,"
"the  Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant  [hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Appellant]"
"alleging criminal trespass into the subject land in the instant action."
"Thereafter, the said B.A Gamini, being the accused in the said criminal trespass case bearing"
"no 14244 M.C. Warakapola had been prosecuted. Eventually, the accused B.A Gamini was"
"discharged from the said case upon certain conditions."
"According to those conditions, the said Heenbanda undertook to institute a civil action to get"
"his rights to the subject land in question within a period of 3 months. Similarly, during this"
"three-month  period,  both  parties  agreed  not  to enter  the  premises  in  suit.  In  the  event  of"
"failure to file a civil action within a period of three months, the accused B. A Gamini is to be"
"declared entitled to the possession of the land in question."
"Apparently, the said Heenbanda had instituted a partition action bearing no. 254456/P in"
"the District Court of Kegalle naming seven Defendants including the said B.A Gamini as the"
"7th Defendant."
"After the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge held that the said Heenbanda is"
"entitled to an undivided 12/120 share and the 7th Defendant the said B. A Gamini is entitled"
"to an undivided 30/120 share."
"However, the said B. A Gamini, the 7th Defendant had appealed against the said judgment in"
"the said partition action to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kegalle. The impugned Judgment"
"of the District Judge was set aside by the Civil Appellate High Court on 15.02.2010, on the"
"basis that both the Plaintiff Heen Banda and the 7th Defendant B. A Gamini had not proved"
"their title to the disputed subject land. Nevertheless, Appellate court does not say that fact of"
"possession by 7th Defendant is wrong, but only states that title has not been proven."
"Therefore, in view of the said Judgement of the District Judge with regard to possession of"
"the 7th Defendant (Appellant) should stand."
"As such, it was the contention of the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant that although the said"
"partition action was dismissed, it will not affect the decision made by the learned District"
"Judge that the 7th Defendant (Appellant) is in possession of the subject land."
"In view of the observations of the learned District Judge in his Judgment, the 7th Defendant"
"(Appellant) was in possession from the time of institution of the partition action, which was"
"within a period of 3 months from 21.11.1990."
