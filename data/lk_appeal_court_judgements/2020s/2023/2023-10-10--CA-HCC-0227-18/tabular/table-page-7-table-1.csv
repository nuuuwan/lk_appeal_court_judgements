"married  woman  and  the  trial  judge  also  had  observed  the  same.  The  first  thing  a  normal"
"married woman would have done was to first told the son to call the farther and then she"
"herself would have first gone to see as to what happened to the man who had gone to sleep"
"with her. Hence the behavior of the appellant after the incident is very suspicious and is very"
"much out of the ordinary which only raises a reasonable doubt as to her innocence."
"The daughter in her evidence had said that she had met the 1st accused in the company of the"
"mother and the mother who is the appellant had asked her whether they could bring the 1st"
"accused home when the father dies, but the daughter had replied that the deceased is yet to"
"die.  But  she  had  not  said  the  same  to  the  police  according  to  the  evidence  given  in  cross"
"examination. But considering her age and the agitation she may have been undergoing at that"
"time, one cannot expect perfect revelation of facts at the time she made a statement to the"
"police."
"The driver who had untied the appellant had said in evidence that the appellant had been"
"tied very loosely and the piece of rope which had been used for the tying had been identified"
"in Court."
"A friend of the appellant who had said in evidence that the appellant has had an illicit affair"
"with a navy officer named Rohana, and that she had warned her to stop it as she was a married"
"woman with children but the appellant had said that she would die without him, and six days"
"later the deceased had died. But she had made the statement to police one month later but"
"she says that the delay was because that she was living away from the scene of crime and that"
"she had told only her husband and it got delayed to be conveyed to the family of the deceased."
"The  police  had  received  the  1st  complaint  on  the  22nd  morning  and  they  had  commenced"
"investigations immediately. The police had said in evidence that the house of the deceased"
"and the appellant had no sign of any house break although a robbery had been reported.  All"
"windows and doors had been intact. On the arrest of the 1st accused jewelry of the deceased"
"had been recovered and the same had been identified by the son of the deceased."
"Upon the conclusion of the prosecution case the appellant had made a statement from the"
"dock. According to which she says that she was misled by the Magistrate and the police to"
"make a statement on the hope of being made a state witness. But we find that the proposition"
"of a state witness is considered much later in investigations of a case hence we see no truth"
"in  the  statement  and  we  consider  the  contents in    the dock  statement to  be  a  mere  after"
"thought . As such we are of the opinion that the rejection of the dock statement by the trial"
"judge is very correct."
"As such we find ample circumstantial evidence implicating the appellant to find her guilty for"
"the charges 1,3 and the contents of the confessionary statement in fact only facilitates these"
"circumstances and those circumstances are as follows,"
