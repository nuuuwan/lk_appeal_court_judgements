"In the case of The Queen vs Ghanaseeha Thero and others 73 NLR  154, it has been held"
"that”  when  considering  a  confession  made  by  accused  persons  to  a  Magistrate  under"
"section  134  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  were  free  and  voluntary,  not  only  facts"
"proceeding the confessions but also facts which immediately followed the making of the"
"confession are relevant.”"
"In section 127 (3) it says that if the Magistrate has reason to believe that there was no threat"
"or inducement, only the confession should be recorded and this reason to believe is that"
"the Magistrate need not have positive proof that there was no threat or inducement but"
"whether it appears to be that there was no threat or inducement, hence it is at a lesser"
"degree than having positive proof of an inducement or threat. This has been discussed in"
"the case of S Vivekananda   and another vs S Selvaratnam 79 NLR 337 and it has referred to"
"confessions recorded under section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance and discusses at length"
"the  need to  ascertain  that  the  confession  was made  without  any  type  of  inducement or"
"threat."
"Therefore, in the in the instant matter we find that the , Magistrate had conducted the inquest"
"and  at  that  time  upon  questioning  the  appellant  she  had  felt  suspicious  and  had  ordered"
"further investigations and when the appellant had been produced before her on the 23rd of"
"October  the  appellant  had  stated  that  she  wanted  to  make  a  confession  and  when  the"
"Magistrate had explained to her the legal implications the appellant had still been on the same"
"footing and she had explained further and had said that the world must know the truth so"
"that women in future will not get caught to men and fall in to trouble. The Magistrate had"
"spoken to her very patiently and had made engage in some religious activities and later only"
"she had spoken to her. Thereafter she had been given time to think till the 29th, but on the"
"request  of  the  appellant  she  had  been  produced  on  the  26th  and  then  too  she  had  been"
"explained and given time to rethink her position but still she had been adamant to make a"
"confession . Therefore, the Magistrate had taken steps to explain all the legal impediments in"
"making a confession and furthermore the trial judge also had very succinctly considered all"
"these aspects in his judgment."
"The Magistrate had been cross examined by the defense as to why she was not sent to be"
"examined by physiatrist and she had said that the appellant had looked very normal and had"
"not appeared to be in want of phsyatric treatment."
"Therefore, in view of the ingredients in section 127 of the CPC it is the opinion of this Court"
"that it gives the Magistrate the discretion to decide as to whether the accused is fit to make"
"a statement and the significant word is “fit” which gives the discretion for the magistrate to"
"decide  and  the  section  nowhere  had  said  that  the  Magistrate  who  was  involved  in  the"
"investigations cannot record a statement under section 127 of the CPC."
