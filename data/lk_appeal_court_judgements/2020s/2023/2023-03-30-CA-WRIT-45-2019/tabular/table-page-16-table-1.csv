"(whether on account of an act or omission in such official capacity, or to obtain"
"relief against him in such capacity, or otherwise)."
"5 (2)  A public officer may be made a respondent to any such application by reference to"

"of justice, for amendment of pleadings, fresh or further notice, costs, or otherwise,"
"in respect of any such omission, defect or irregularity."

"successor being made a respondent, by reference to his official designation only,"
"in terms of sub-rule (2)."

"made a respondent by reference to his official designation (and not by name),"
