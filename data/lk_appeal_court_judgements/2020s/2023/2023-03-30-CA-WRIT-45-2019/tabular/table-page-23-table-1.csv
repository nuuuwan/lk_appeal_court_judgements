"UOI,  AIR  1983  Cal  273  is  a  case  where  the  High  Court  (in  India)    directed  the  telephone"
"authorities to restore the connection within a week when the telephone of the applicant was"
"wrongfully disconnected in spite of him paying his dues regularly."
"B
y perusing the above legal literature and the judgements on the evolution of Mandamus, to"
"my mind, the tool of Mandamus has been used many a time not only against the individual"
"public servants but at certain instances even against the local government institutions such as"
"county councils/borough councils. Hence, a reasonable question arises in my mind on what"
"grounds our Courts, such as in Haniffa’s case, have attempted to limit the expansion of this"
"prerogative remedy completely overlooking the systematic progress in the relevant field of law"
"and  the  environment  which  prevailed  at  the  birth  of  Mandamus.  The  scope  of  remedy  in"
"administrative law has been expanded with a considerable degree of judicial activism for the"
"last three decades. At a time where the judges take a liberalized or progressive stand in their"
"judicial creativity to control public power, I possibly cannot understand why we still need to"
"cling  to  primitive  principles  on  Mandamus  whereas  the  English  courts  themselves  have"
"already broken the traditional parameters and taken drastic measures to use Mandamus as a"
"powerful tool to issue orders in the mandatory nature against juristic persons such as local"
"government institutions. The Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide 2022 in England26"
"specifically provides in its  Clause 12.2.1 that a mandatory order is an order the Court can"
"make to compel a public body to act in a particular way."
"I
t is essential to bear in mind the socio-political factors in the country to a certain extent when"
"judges  exercise  their  jurisdiction  in  order  to  review  the  public  power.  The  removal  from  a"
"post, dismissal and transfers are in the hands of administration or sometimes it’s a prerogative"
"of the executive subject to limitations. It cannot be assumed that holding a high post for a"
"long period would be available all the time in public service as well as at semi-governmental"
"institutions.  Such  premise  should  not  be  a  hindrance  for  an  individual  to  recourse  to  the"
"remedy  under  Mandamus  when  he  or  she  seeks  to  get  the  public  duties  executed.  I  am"
"attracted to the words of His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena in Methodist Trust Case where"
"he has addressed exactly the same point;"

"Offices (“ACOs”) across England and Wales."
