"I found the following passage in a publication by Lewis & Clark Law Review;"
"“In its earliest uses in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, mandamus served as a"
"charge from the Crown to a third party with no option of return2. An option of return"
"in this context would give the party subject to the mandamus an opportunity to come"
"to court and explain why the commanded action could not or should not take place3."
"Later  into  the  fifteenth  century,  mandamus  offered  individuals  a  way  to  petition"
"Parliament for redress, most commonly restoration to public office, and it eventually"
"came to be known as a “writ of restitution4”. Next, it grew into its modern use as an"
"original writ, offering a legal remedy in the form of a command from King’s Bench5.”"
