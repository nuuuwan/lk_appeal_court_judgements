"and has not been misled or prejudiced any party. Hence, the Review Court should have the"
"sole discretion to decide, upon satisfaction, that such respondent who is a natural person or a"
"juristic person or otherwise, has been sufficiently identified and described for the purpose of"
"making  a  mandatory  order  which  can  be  enforced.  This  emphasized  the  fact  that  such"
"discretion of the Review Court should exist even in an application for substitution of parties"
"in applications for Mandamus."
