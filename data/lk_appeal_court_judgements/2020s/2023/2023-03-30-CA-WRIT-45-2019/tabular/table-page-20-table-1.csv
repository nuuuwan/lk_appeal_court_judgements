"Senaratne23 is clearly obiter dicta; thus, the judgment of Marsoof J. is not an authority to say"
"that writ of Mandamus is an exception to Rule 5. The Court in that case further held;"
"“Is the judgement in Haniffa’s case a well-considered Judgement? This is a nagging question for"
"me……….The observation in Haniffa’s case that “If such a person fails to perform a duty after"
"he has been ordered by Court, he can be punished for contempt of Court” presupposes the position"
"that if mandamus is issued against a juristic person as opposed to a natural person, in case of a"
"violation, the juristic person cannot be dealt with for contempt of Court. This is not correct. When"
"a writ of mandamus is issued against a juristic person the parties who must obey it are those in"
"control of the affairs of the juristic person, and in case of a violation, they can be dealt with for"
"contempt."
