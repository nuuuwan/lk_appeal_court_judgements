"Defendants  were  allocated  144/1680  and  92/1680  undivided  shares  respectively.  The  4th  and  5th"
"Defendants were allocated an undivided 46/1680 share each and 6th, 7th ,8th Defendants were given"
"an undivided 20/1680 share each, 9th and 10th Defendants were also allocated an undivided 80/1680"
"and 40/1680 share respectively. It is relevant to note that the learned District Judge has kept 192/1680"
"share unallotted."
"After delivering the said Judgement, 13th -16th Defendants had been added as Party Defendants on their"
"application by petition dated 20.11.1995. The said 13th -16th Defendants had drawn the attention of"
"Court to paragraph 11 of the plaint. It is specifically stated that Plaintiff is unaware who the owners of"
"192/1680 share are. It was further stated that the said 192/1680 share should be kept unallotted until"
"the claimants come forward to claim their rights."
"It was further submitted on behalf of the Appellants that it is clear from the petition filed by 13th to 16th"
"Defendant-Appellants that original owner whom they are claiming title from was not disclosed by the"
"Plaintiff in his plaint nor evidence adduced in this regard.  The Plaintiff has simply stated in paragraph"
"11 of his plaint that he is unaware of the owners. However, at the inquiry, the Plaintiff seems to had"
"known all the owners pertaining to unallotted share."
"It  was  further  submitted  that  13th  to  16th  Defendant-Appellants  have  proved  that  they  have  certain"
"entitlements  to  the  said  unallotted  share.  By  the  evidence  of  the  Plaintiff  and  the  Petitioners,  it  was"
"elicited that there are proper heirs to the unallotted shares. The only arguments which were leveled"
"against the Petitioners was that a fuller pedigree was not shown before Court by them. However, the"
"Petitioners had established that there are proper heirs to the unallotted shares. Therefore, the Petitioners"
"sought to file amended papers in the  District Court showing the  fuller pedigree  and to have  a fresh"
"inquiry before the District Court to establish their rights to the said unallotted shares."
"As there are no objections by the Plaintiff-Respondent and other Defendant-Respondents, we allow the"
"said application of the Petitioners and send this case back to the District Court of Walasmulla. We direct"
"the learned District Judge to allow the Petitioners to file amended statement of claim and to have a fresh"
"inquiry in order to decide the entitlement of Petitioners to the unallotted 192/1680 share.  Further, we"
"direct the learned District Judge to conclude this matter with minimum delay."
