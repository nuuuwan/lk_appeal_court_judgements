"possessed  or  trafficked  by  a  person  is  less  than  10  grams,  the  relevant  High"
"Court  has  no  option  but  to  release  such  a  person  on  bail  after  12  months  in"
"custody, unless the Attorney General  has acted and had obtained an order in"
"terms of section 85 of the Ordinance as amended by the Amendment Act No. 41"
"of 2022. It is the view of this Court in any case, even if such an order has been"
"obtained, no person shall be detained in custody for more than 24 months if the"
"pure quantity of the dangerous drug is less than 10 grams, unless the accused"
"has been tried, convicted and sentenced by a competent Court."
"For  the  purposes  of  these  provisions  as  considered  earlier,  “dangerous  drug”"
"means Morphine, Cocaine, Heroin and Methamphetamine."
"As the alleged pure quantity of the dangerous drug possessed and trafficked by"
"the 1st accused in the case under consideration was 9.426 grams of Heroin, and"
"he had been in remand custody from the date of his arrest on 16-10-2019 and"
"he has not been tried, convicted and sentenced, it is the view of this Court that"
"the learned High Court Judge has been misdirected as to the relevant law, when"
"bail was refused for the 1st accused."
"It is the view of this Court that the 1st accused is entitled to be released on bail"
"in  terms  of  the  relevant  law,  as  it  stands  now,  for  the  reasons  as  considered"
"above.  Hence,  this  court  finds  that  the  petitioner  has  established  sufficient"
"exceptional circumstances for this Court to intervene with the order dated 01-"
"03-2023 of the learned High Court Judge of Panadura."
"Accordingly,  the  order  dated  01-03-2023  is  hereby  set  aside  as  it  cannot  be"
"allowed to stand."
"The 1st accused is granted bail on following bail conditions."
