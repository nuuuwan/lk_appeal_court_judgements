"said Commission to the National Police Commission. The National Police"
"Commission  on  24-01-2017  decided  to  remove  the  Rs.  30,000/-  fine"
"imposed  by  the  Inspector  General  of  Police  and  affirmed  the  rest  of  the"
"aforesaid punishment. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner"
"preferred an appeal to the AAT, whereas the AAT by Order dated 23-10-"
"2018 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Disciplinary Order of the IGP"
"marked  as  P20.  In  these  circumstances,  the  Petitioner  states  that  the"
"Order of the AAT is arbitrary, capricious, illegal, unreasonable, irrational"
"and against the rules of natural justice."
"It is pertinent to be noted that this is not an appeal and this is a judicial"
"review.  How  does  one  differentiate  between  an  appeal  and  a  judicial"
"review? In a judicial review proceeding we challenge the way in which the"
"decision  was  made,  rather  than  whether  the  decision  or  the  conclusion"
"reached is correct. In this way, judicial review is not really concerned with"
"the  conclusion;  it  focuses  more  so  on  the  procedures  that  have  been"
"followed.    A  review  is  not  a  statutory  right  of  the  people  and  is  at  the"
"discretion of the court, which can reject the request.  A review is based on"
"procedural irregularity, impropriety, irrationality, and illegality. In judicial"
"review the Court will not annalize the evidence adduced and whether the"
"decision  was in accordance with the  evidence adduced, which has to be"
"considered in an appeal."
"With an Appeal, you can challenge the courtâ€™s decision by appealing it at"
"a higher court than the one that passed the verdict. An appeal is a plea for"
"the matter to be  judged again. An appeal is requested to ask the higher"
"court to change the decision of the lower court. The decision of the lower"
"court can stay the same or the Higher Court can change it."
