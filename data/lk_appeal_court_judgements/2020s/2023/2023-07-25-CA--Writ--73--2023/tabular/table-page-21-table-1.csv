"probability of the petitioners succeeding in their challenge against the tax   deduction. If"
"the court believes the petitioners’ case has a high likelihood of success, it may be more"
"inclined to grant the stay order."
"As I mentioned above, the specific considerations and requirements for obtaining a stay/interim"
"order against tax deduction may vary depending on the circumstances of each case."
"I find it prudent to decline the issuance of an interim order against the respondents. This decision"
"is based on several reasons. In the event that the court decides to grant an interim order at present"
"and subsequently, upon completion of comprehensive arguments and determines to dismiss the"
"application put forth by the petitioners, the petitioners shall be obliged to refund the said amount"
"to the tax authority. This cumulative sum is expected to be of significant magnitude. Under such"
"circumstances, the petitioners may be exposed to substantial detriment, surpassing the potential"
"damages that could arise from the issuance of an interim order at this juncture."
"The above stance is supported by the following judgements."
"In the case R (on the application of Prudential plc and another) v Special Commissioner of Income"
"Tax (2013) UKSC 1 the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom considered the circumstances in"
"which a stay of tax assessments could be granted pending an appeal. The court held that a stay"
"order could be issued if there was a real prospect of success in the appeal and the taxpayer would"
"suffer irreparable harm if the stay order was not granted. The court emphasized the importance"
"of balancing the interests of the taxpayer and the tax authority."
"Similarly, in the case of R (on the application of Haworth) v Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs"
"(2021) UKSC 25 the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom considered the criteria for granting a"
"stay  of  tax  collection  pending  the  determination  of  a  judicial  review.  The  court  held  that  the"
"taxpayer must show a good arguable case and a real possibility of substantial injustice if the stay"
"was  not  granted.  The  Court  also  emphasized  the  need  to  consider  the  public  interest  and  the"
"balance of convenience."
"These judgements provide insight into the factors that English courts consider when determining"
"the issuance of a stay order against tax collection."
"In a recent judgment, CA/WRIT/354/2022 decided on 14.10.2022 Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. stated"
"“The  Judges  exercising  the  jurisdiction  in  judicial  review  have  enlarged  the  scope  of  granting"
