"The petitioners state that in this context that all judicial officers shall not fall within the category"
"of  ""Employment"",  and  neither  do  such  judicial  officers  receive  any  ""Employment  Income""  as"
"interpreted and contemplated under and in terms of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 as"
"amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022. In these circumstances that"
"subsequent to the imposition of the provisions of the said Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No."
"45  of  2022  the 
judicial  officers  are  at  present  considered  as 
falling 
into  the  category  of"
"""Employment"" and the salaries of such judicial officers are considered as ""Employment Income"""
"by the respondents in this instant application, which amounts to being irrational, unreasonable"
"and ultra vires."
"The petitioners state that such an ultra vires application of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act"
"No. 45 of 2022 shall also clearly impose a direct threat against the Rule of Law, the Doctrine of the"
"Separation of Powers, the independence and impartiality of the judicial officers. It is established"
"law that the judicial service is not a service in the sense of ""Employment"", that the Judges are not"
"employees, and that as members of the Judiciary, they exercise the sovereign Judicial Power of the"
"State. The petitioner argued that it has also been established that Judges, at whatever level they"
"may be, represent the State and its authority unlike the administrative executive or the members"
"of the other services. Accordingly, it has been held therefore that members of the other services"
"cannot be placed on par with the members of the Judiciary, either constitutionally or functionally."
"The petitioners state that moreover the 1st and 2nd respondents shall not even be deemed to be"
"the employer of the judicial officers. The petitioners state that in lieu of the services rendered by"
"judicial officers they receive their appropriate amounts of due allowances and salaries which shall"
"not be liable to be subject to taxation. In those circumstances the Inland Revenue Department has"
"issued  a  ""Guideline  for  Employers  on  deducting  Advance  Personal 
Income  Tax  (APIT)  from"
"Employment Income"" dated 22nd December 2022. The petitioners further state that the 1st and"
"2nd  respondents  shall  not  be  permitted  in  law  to  make  any  such  deductions  of  any  Advance"
"Personal Income Tax (APIT) pertaining to the judicial officers of Labour Tribunals and proceed to"
"remit the same to the 3rd respondent."
"The petitioners state further that judicial officers shall be entitled to an official residence, official"
"vehicle,  driver's  allowance  and  other  allowances  which  shall  not  be  subjected  to  taxation.  The"
"respondents  by  taking  the  steps  to  deduct  the  aforementioned  Advance  Personal  Income  Tax"
"(APIT) from the said income of judicial officers are acting arbitrarily, irrationally, unreasonably and"
"ultra vires. Accordingly, the petitioners state that therefore the 3rd respondent shall be placed on"
"a  public  duty  to  duly  return  any  such  Advance  Personal  Income  Tax  (APIT)  monies  which  are"
"baselessly deducted from the income of judicial officers under and in terms of the Inland Revenue"
"Act No. 24 of 2017 as amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022."
"The highly escalated increase in the level of taxation applied to the income received by the judicial"
"officers under and in terms of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 as amended by the Inland"
"Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022 would amount to the said judicial officers having to pay"
"an approximate sum of Rs. 1,500,000/- annually in the form of Income tax. This would clearly result"
"in  amounting  to  low  and  inadequate  remuneration  been  provided  to 
judicial  officers  in  this"
"Country."
