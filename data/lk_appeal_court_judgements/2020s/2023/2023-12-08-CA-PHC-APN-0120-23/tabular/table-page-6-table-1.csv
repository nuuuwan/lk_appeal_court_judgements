"CA PHC APN 120-2023"
"The Learned High Court Judge in his well-considered order considered"
"the heath condition of the Petitioner very extensively and given reasons"
"as  to  why  he  refused  the  application  for  bail  pending  appeal  of  the"
"Petitioner.  Further,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  directed  the"
"Registrar of Embilipitiya High Court to inform that the Petitioner should"
"be  sent  for  necessary  treatments  and  if  the  doctor  recommends,  the"
"Petitioner should be taken to the recommended hospital/s for necessary"
"clinics."
"Hence,  considering  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  and  the  punishment"
"imposed on the Petitioner by the Learned High Court Judge, I consider"
"this is not an appropriate case to issue notice to the Respondents. The"
"only remedy available to the Petitioner would be to make an application"
"before the Court to fix the main appeal to an early date considering the"
"circumstances of this case."
"Hence, we refuse notice in this case."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the"
"High Court of Embilipitiya for information."
