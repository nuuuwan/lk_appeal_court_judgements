"In her cross-examination, DW01 mentioned that she was arrested between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m."
"after her house was investigated and later taken to the police station by PW1. They then took her to the"
"specified address at around 1:30 to 2:00 p.m. and asked her to identify the Accused’s house. She was"
"subsequently transported back to the police station by jeep. She further stated that she was asked to"
"accept the case related to an unknown identity card and was fined Rs. 3500."
"The  primary  issue  for  consideration  in  this  appeal  is  whether  PW1's  witness  testimony  is"
"improbable. If so, the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the test of probability regarding the"
"prosecution’s version."
"Probability, in the context of legal matters, is defined as follows:"
"According  to  Murray’s  English  Dictionary,  probability  means  ""the  appearance  of  truth  or"
"likelihood of being realized, which any statement or event bears in the light of present evidence."""
