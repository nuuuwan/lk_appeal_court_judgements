"Upon applying the Test of Probability and Test of Improbability to the aforementioned facts, it"
"becomes evident that the evidence presented through the Prosecution's narratives cannot be deemed"
"credible."
"It is worth noting that DW1, the Accused’s wife, testified that she was arrested between 9:00 to"
"10:00 a.m. and subsequently taken to the Accused’s house, after which she was returned to the police"
"station.  Considering  the  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution,  it  becomes  apparent  that  PW1's"
"testimony lacks veracity. In light of these circumstances, we find that the defense's narrative appears"
"more plausible than that of the prosecution. Therefore, on these grounds and for the reasons detailed"
"above, we overturn the conviction and sentence."
"This appeal is allowed."
