"successful interview conducted years later, is untenable as it would not accurately reflect the"
"individual's  qualifications  and  approval  status  at  the  time  of  the  second  interview.  The"
"progression of time and the evolution of circumstances necessitate treating each recruitment"
"process  as  a  discrete  event,  thereby  upholding  the  integrity  of  the  selection  process  and"
"ensuring fairness in appointments. Based on such circumstances, I am not inclined to uphold"
"the contention of the Petitioner that the USAB have abdicated the power vested in them by"
"law when issuing its order marked ""P56""."
"In light of the foregoing, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed"
"for in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application."
