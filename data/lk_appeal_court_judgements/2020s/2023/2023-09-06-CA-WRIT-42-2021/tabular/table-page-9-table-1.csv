"court  with  sufficient  evidence  to  prove  that  the  above  mentioned  tasks  are  unique  to  the"
"position of a Lecturer (Probationary) and are not expected to be performed by an individual"
"in the position of an “Instructor (Grade II)”. As opposed to such arguments the Council and"
"the  University  asserts  that  the  performance  of  the  Petitioner  at  the  aforementioned  2nd"
"interview process was different from that of the 1st, which took place six years earlier."
"In light of the above what needs resolution by this Court in the instant Application is whether"
"the Petitioner is entitled to get his appointment (""P54"") antedated based on the outcome of"
"the initial interview held on 19.05.2014. Hence, this court is required to examine the following"
"questions:"
"I. 
Whether  the  petitioner  is  entitled  to  raise  a  claim  based  on  the  initial  selection"
"process which was compelled to be abandoned by the University?"
"II. 
What  is  the  effect  of  abandoning  or  canceling  a  selection  process  relating  to"
"recruitment of the University staff?"
"III. 
Has the Petitioner waived his rights by exhausting his entitlement of reapplying for"
"the same post and facing a distinct interview?"
"IV. 
Can the Petitioner seek relief based on the recommendations made following the"
"initial  interview,  without  challenging  the  abandonment  of  the  initial  selection"
"process?"
"The  primary  relief  sought  by  the Petitioner  is  to  quash  the  USAB  order  dated  19.05.2020."
"(“P56”) and also the decision taken by the Council that there shouldn't be any change in the"
"date of the Petitioner’s appointment as Lecturer (Probationary). The Petitioner has appealed"
"to  the  USAB  seeking  similar  reliefs.  Additionally,  the  Petitioner 
is  seeking  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus  in  order  to  get  the  appointment  of  the  Petitioner  antedated.  However,  it  is"
"paramount to note that the Petitioner is not challenging the decision of the authorities to call"
"for fresh applications for the appointment to the relevant post by re-advertising the same. In"
"other words, the abandonment of the initial process relating to the selection of candidates is"
"not being challenged."
"It is significant that the process of selection of a candidate does not consist of a single step but"
"includes an interview, a practical examination etc., particularly according to the scheme of"
