"For the reasons mentioned above, I take the view that a plea of antedating an appointment"
"placing  reliance  on  a  previous  selection  process  cannot  subsequently  be  invoked  in  a  case"
"where such candidate has opted to undergo a fresh selection process for the same post, unless"
"the relevant public authority has taken decisions against statutory restrictions or exceeding its"
"jurisdiction. A candidate who becomes successful during such a subsequent selection process"
"should  not  be  able  to  raise  claims  upon  his  purported  rights  allegedly  emanating  from  a"
"previous  process  of  selection  that  took  place,  without  first  protesting  or  challenging  the"
"abandonment  of  the  said  previous  selection  process.  Readvertising  or  calling  for  fresh"
"applications for the same posts amounts to an abandonment of the initial selection process if"
"there are no special circumstances available to deviate from such  a proposition. The initial"
"instance, wherein the candidate faced an interview but did not secure final approval for the"

"success in the latter interview should not serve as a basis for antedating the appointment to"
"the date of the initial refusal of the appointment. Doing so would undermine the integrity of"
"the  distinct  interview  processes  and  compromise  the  principle  of  meritocracy  that  governs"
"appointment decisions. It is essential to recognize that candidates evolve over time, acquiring"
"new skills, experiences, and perspectives. As such, the decision to appoint following a later"
"interview reflects the candidate's updated qualifications and suitability for the position at that"
"juncture."
"Similarly, although this court finds that there has been serious mismanagement on the part of"
"the said University with regard to the cancellation of the 2nd and 3rd interviews and not being"
