"In the case under appeal, the evidence of the registered owner that she had no"
"knowledge of the offence being committed and she took precautions to prevent"

"all  precautions  to  prevent  the  use”  needs  to  be  interpreted  in  a  pragmatic"

"its owner. If a Court is to look for all the possible precautions that an owner of a"
"vehicle can take in a given scenario, there can always be some other precautions"
"that could have been taken which in my view was not the purpose of enacting"
"the relevant provisions as to the confiscation of a vehicle."
