"[47] The Carltona doctrine thus, applies where a statute has conferred a power"
"on a Minister, and it is practically impossible for the Minister to exercise such"
"power personally, he may, in general, act through a duly authorised officer of"
"his department without having a formal delegation to do so. It recognises the"
"principle that the functions of a Minister are so multifarious that the business"
"of government could not be carried on if he were required to exercise all his"
"powers personally. Thus, the official is treated as the ministerâ€™s alter ego, and to"
"that extent, his decision is regarded as those of the Minister."

"and  it  has  been  judicially  recognised  in  the Commissioners of Customs and"
"Excise v. Cure & Deeley Ltd. (1962) 1 QB 340 at p 371  that the Commissioners"
"of Customs and Excise were in a position parallel to that of Ministers:"
