"result. Surely a dairy company ""exports” butter, and a fruit cannery ""exports”"

ts manufactures, whether it ships the goods to its own order in another"

exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it accounts."
"t is to be observed however that s 129B is solely concerned with the actions"
"of  vendors.  In  our  opinion  a  vendor  may  export  either  by  taking  or  by"
"sending. There will be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports"
"by taking, as for example in the case of an ordinary contract”."
"[239] Thus, Turner J., stated that the question whether  the respondent or the"
"passengers,  who  is  to  be  regarded,  for  the  purposes  of  s 129B,  as  having"
"""exported” the goods which it sold to the travellers. Referring to the meanings"
"of the word— (1) taking the goods out of the country, and (2) sending them or"
"causing them to be sent out—the choice between them depends on the answer"
"to the question: What operation was it that the section is obviously designed to"
"subsidise? On this approach to the matter, it seemed clear to to Turner J. that it"
"is respondent's operation which was meant to receive the reward offered by the"
"statute."
