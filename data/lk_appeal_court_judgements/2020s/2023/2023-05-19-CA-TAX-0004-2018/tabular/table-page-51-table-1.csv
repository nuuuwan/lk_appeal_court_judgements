"1.","If is necessary implication from the language employed that the legislature"
"","intended a particular section to have a retrospective operation, the courts will"
"","give 
it  such  an  operation  because

is  obviously  competent

"2.","If,  on 
the  other  hand, 
the 
language  employed  by 
the 
legislature 
is"
"","ambiguous or not clear and explicit, the court must not give a construction"
"","which would take away vested rights, or in other words, should treat the Act"
"","as  prospective

Interpretation  of  Statutes,  p."
