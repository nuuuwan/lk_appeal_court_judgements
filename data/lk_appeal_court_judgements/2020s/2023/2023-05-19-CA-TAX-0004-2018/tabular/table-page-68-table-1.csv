ffect of section 56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011"
"[172] Section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011 clearly provides that the amendments"
"made to the principal enactment by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No."
"22 of 2011, other than the amendments specifically referred to in the proviso to"
"section 56 of the said Act, shall come into force on April 1, 2011. The legislative"
"intention is to ensure that the amendments that are specifically referred to in the"
"proviso to section 56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011,"
"operate with retrospective effect from the dates specified therein while all other"
"amendments made to the principal enactment, including the amendments made"
"to  section  163(5)  operate  with  prospective  effect  from  April,  1,  2011.  If  the"
"legislative 
intention  was  to  extend  the  period  given  to  the  assessor 
from"
"31.03.2012  to  30.11.2012  for  any  year of  assessment  prior  to  01.04.2009,  there"
"was  no 
reason 
for 
the 
legislature 
to  provide 
in  express 
terms 
that 
“the"
"amendments  made  to  the  principal  enactment  including  section  163(5)  by  the"
"provisions of the Act No, 22 of 2011, other than the amendments referred to in"
"section 56, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1,"
"2011. If a gap is disclosed in the Legislature, the remedy lies is an amending Act,"
"and  not  in  a  usurpation  of  the  legislative  function  under  the  thin  disguise  of"
"interpretation and read words into the section which are not there, by a judicial"
"interpretation and to defeat the intention of the legislature."
"[173]  Although 
the  amendment  made 
to  section  163(5)  of 
the  principal"
"enactment is of a procedural nature, and is presumed to have retrospective effect,"
"the presumption of retrospectivity has been excluded or rebutted by the express"
"provision in section 56 of the same Act. Section 56 expresslly provides that the"
"amendment  made 
to  section  163(5)  applies  with  prospective  effect 
(w.e.f."
"01.04.2011) and thus, it is not possible for the assessor to extend the time period"
"for making the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010 from 31.03.2012"
"to 30.11.2012."
"[174] A perusal of the decision in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy"
"Foundries Ltd.  and the relevant provisions of section 154 or 155 of the Income"
"Tax Act of India reveal that the is nothing to indicate that the limitation provisions"
"of  the  Income  Tax  Act  of  India  restrict  the  effective  date  of  the 
limitation"
