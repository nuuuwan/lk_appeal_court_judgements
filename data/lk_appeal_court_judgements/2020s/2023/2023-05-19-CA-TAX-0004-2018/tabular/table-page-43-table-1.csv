"[115] The next crucial question is to consider, even if the assessment was made on"
"26.11.2012,  whether  the  assessment  should  have  been  made  on  or  before"
"31.03.2012 and if so, whether the assessment made on 26.11.2012  is nevertheless"
"time barred under section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended)."
"[116]  During  the  course  of  the  further  argument  on  the  applicability  of  the"
"judgment of the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of"
"I
n
l
and Revenue SC Appeal No. 46/2016 decided on 16.12.2021, Dr. Felix submitted"
"that  even 
if  the  assessment  was  made  on  26.11.2012,  as  submitted  by  the"
"Respondent, the applicable law for the year of assessment 2009/2010 commenced"
"on  01.04.2010  and  ended  on  31.03.2010  and  thus,  the  statutory  amendment"
"applied 
in  respect  of  the  said  year  of  assessment  was  the 
Inland  Revenue"
"(Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, which applied to any year of assessment on or"
"after 1, April 2009.  He further submitted that section 27 of the Inland Revenue"
"(Amendment)  Act,  No.  19  of  2009,  which  changed  the  time  bar  relating  to"
"assessment, but it did not provide that the amendment made to section 163(5) of"
"the principal enactment had retrospective effect. Dr. Felix strenuously argued that"
"the 
Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act.  No.  22  of  2011  came 
into  effect  on"
"01.04.2011,  which  further  changed  the  time  bar  relating  to  assessment,  but  it"
"applied  to  any  year  of  assessment  on  or  after  01.04.2011  and  the  amendment"
"made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 had"
"no  retrospective effect in terms of section 56 of the said Act, No. 22 of 2011."
"[117] He further submitted that the said amendment was prospective in nature,"
"which has no effect on any year of assessment prior to 1, April 2011 and section"
"56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 did not provide that"
"the  amendment  made 
to  section 
  163(5)  of 
the  principal  enactment  had"
"retrospective  effect.  He  submitted  that  even  if  the  assessment  was  made  on"
"26.11.2012, it was time barred within 2 years from the end of the relevant year of"
"assessment 2009/2010 (i.e., by 31.03.2012) in terms of section 163(5) of the Inland"
"Revenue  (Amendment)  Act,  No.  10  of  2009.  He  relied  on  the  decision  of  the"
"Supreme Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue"
"(supra) in support of his contention."
"[118] On the other hand, Mr. Wigneswaran submitted that (i) the  Inland Revenue"
"Act, No. 10 of 2006 provided that no assessment shall be made after the expiry of"
"18 months from the end of the immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e."
"until 30th September of the following year; (ii) this section was amended by the"
"Act No. 19 of 2009 which provided that no assessment shall be made after the"
