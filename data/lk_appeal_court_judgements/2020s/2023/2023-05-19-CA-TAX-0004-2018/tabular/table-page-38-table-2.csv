"That section again draws a clear distinction between the assessment and the"
"notice of assessment and shows that they are different, the assessment being in"
"no way dependent upon the service of the notice‚Äù [emphasis added]."
"[98] The ratio of the decision was that the assessment is different from the notice"
"of  assessment,  and  it  is  in  no  way  dependent  on  the  service  of  the  notice  of"
"assessment. When the Inspector of Taxes signed a  certificate in the assessment"
"book  stating  that  he  had  made  an  assessment, 
is  good  evidence  that  an"
"assessment  had  been  made  under  the  Taxes  Management  Act.  The  reason  is"
"obvious. It  has the effect of fixing the Inspector of Taxes to a definite position,"
"and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter, echoing the quoted"
"words used by Samarakoon C.J. in D.M.S. Fernando v A.M. Ismail (p. 194).  But, the"
"fact that the assessment is made when the certificate recording its  entry in the"
"assessment book is signed by the Inspector of Taxes cannot be taken into account"
"in  displacing  the  distinction  between  the  making  of  the  assessment  and  the"
"sending of  the notice of assessment under the Inland Revenue Act."
"[99]  The  Inland  Revenue  Act  of  Sri  Lanka  goes  a  step  forward  and  imposes  a"
"mandatory  statutory  obligation  on  the  assessor  who  made  the  assessment  to"
"communicate  his  reasons 
in  writing  to  the  taxpayer  why  his  return  was  not"
"accepted. The assessor who makes the assessment in Sri Lanka need not produce"
"any  assessment  register  to  establish  that  an  assessment  was  made  when  he"
"communicated the assessment, with his reasons in writing to the taxpayer under"
"his signature,  why he is not accepting the return."
"[100] In England, the certificate made by the Inspector of Taxes in the assessment"
"book may fix the Inspector of Taxes to a definite position that an assessment has"
"been made under the provisions of the Taxes Management Act. In Sri Lanka, once"
"the assessment made by the assessor is communicated to the taxpayer in writing"
"(by registered letter dated 09.09.2013) signed by the assessor with reasons for not"
"accepting the return, the assessor is fixed to a definite position that an assessment"
"had  been  made,  which  cannot  be  changed  or  chopped  thereafter.  When  that"
