"Revenue Act,  the delivery of goods shall be after customs clearance, i.e., after"
"the goods have cleared all local customs and all other legal formalities and are"
"kept ready for delivery to the shipâ€™s tanks, the Appellant would qualify for the"
"concessionary tax rates specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue"
"Act."
"[230] In my opinion, the concept sought to put in service in CIT v. Silver and"
"Arts Palace (supra)  cannot be applied to the facts of this case and  therefore,"
"the submission of customs clearance (bill of entry) per se does not constitute"
"an Appellant an exporter of the bunker fuel under sections 42 of 52 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)."
"Use of Foreign Currency"
"[231] The learned Counsel for the Appellant  citing the Exchange Control Act,"
"No.  24  of  1953,  as  amended,  submitted  that  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  is"
"permitted by the Central Bank to accept foreign currency payments for supplies"
"of marine bunker fuel  to ships travelling in international waters  supports the"
"position of the Appellant that the sales undertaken by the Appellant are not"
"local sales but are in fact exports. He submitted that it is an offence to accept"
"foreign  currency  for  a  local  sale  and  therefore,  this  transaction  should  be"
"construed to be an export."
"[232]  On  the  other  hand,  the  Central  Bank  has  powers  to  permit  any  person"
"under Section 7 of the Exchange Control Act, to make any payment to, or for"
"the credit of a person resident outside Sri Lanka or make any payment to or for"
"the credit of a person resident in Sri Lanka. In my view the mere fact that the"
"sale of bunker fuel was paid for in foreign currency does not necessarily render"
"it an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act."
