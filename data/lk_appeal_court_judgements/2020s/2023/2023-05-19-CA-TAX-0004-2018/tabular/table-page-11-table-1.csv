"266)].  As  held  in Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1999), the  emphasis"
"ought to be on the consequences of non-compliance, and asking the question"
"whether Parliament can fairly be taken to have intended total invalidity."
"[24] Although the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended)"
"was  amended  by  Parliament  twice  and  increased  the  period  within  which  the"
"appeal is to be determined by the Commission from 200 days to 270 days with"
"retrospective  effect,  the  legislature  in  its  wisdom  did  not  specify  any  penal"
"consequence  or  any  other  consequence  of  non-compliance  of  the  time  bar"
"specified in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.  Had the legislature"
"intended that the non-compliance with section 10 to be mandatory, it could have"
"easily  included  a  provision  with  negative  words  requiring  that  an  act  shall  be"
"done in no other manner or at no other time than that designated in the section"
"or  a  provision 
for  a  penal  consequence  or  other  consequence  of  non-"
"compliance."
"[25]  The  object  sought  to  be  attained  by  section  10  of  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  Act  has  been  designed  primarily  to  expedite  the  appeal  process"
"filed before the Tax Appeals Commission, which was established by an Act of"
"Parliament, and the Commission shall comprise retired Judges of the Supreme"
"Court or the Court of Appeal, and those who have gained wide knowledge and"
"eminence in the field of Taxation."
"[26]  The  legislature  has,  from  time  to  time,  extended  and  reduced  the  time"
"period  within  which 
the  appeal  shall  be  determined  by  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission,  but  it  intentionally  and  purposely  refrained  from  imposing  any"
"consequence for the failure on the part of the Tax Appeals Commission to adhere"
"to the time limit specified in section 10. It is crystal clear that these procedural"
"time  limit  rules  have  been  devised  by  the  legislature  to  facilitate  the  appeal"
"process by increasing and reducing the time period within which such appeals"
"shall be concluded. The provision for the determination of an appeal by the TAC"
"within  a  period  of  270  days  from  the  commencement  of  its  sittings  for  the"
"hearing  of  an  appeal.  It  has  been  designed  to  regulate  the  duties  of  the  Tax"
"Appeals Commission by specifying a time limit for its performance as specified"
"in section 10 of the Act."
"[27]  The  legislature  could  not  have  intended  that  the  time  limit  specified  in"
"section 10 is mandatory when the parties had no control over those entrusted"
"with the task of making the determination under section 10 of the Tax Appeals"
