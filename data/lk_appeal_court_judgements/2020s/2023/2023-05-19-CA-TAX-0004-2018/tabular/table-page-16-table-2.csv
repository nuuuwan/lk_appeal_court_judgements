"and Revenue, CA/TAX/0049/2019, decided on 26.03.2021, this Court held:"
"[
19] In this modern-day administration, with expansion of powers and"
"multifarious functions exercised by public officers, the Commissioner-"
"General cannot be expected, as the head of the Inland Revenue Department"
"to attend to all and perform each and every function himself. As there may"
"be thousands of taxpayers in Sri Lanka, it cannot be expected that the"
"Commissioner-General shall perform each and every task himself, unless"
"the Inland Revenue Act itself has specifically empowered to him to exercise"
"such function personally I do not see any such intention reflected in the"
"l
anguage, scope or object of section 165 (6) of the Act. I do not think that"
"the Parliament intended such a result‚Äù."
