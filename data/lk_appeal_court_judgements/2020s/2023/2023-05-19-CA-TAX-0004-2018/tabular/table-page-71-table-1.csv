"[181] On the other hand, the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that",""
"the Appellant’s transactions do not constitute “exports” under any of the four",""
"legal standards or tests that are recognized as characteristics of an export such",""
"as (i) there  should be an act of taking out of Sri Lanka; (ii) the goods must reach",""
