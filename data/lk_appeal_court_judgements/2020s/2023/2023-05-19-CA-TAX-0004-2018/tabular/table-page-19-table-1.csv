"broadly the principle at page 560, as follows:"
"â€œ
I

the administration of government in this country, the functions which are"
"g
i
ven to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers, because"
"they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no"
"m
i
n
i
s
ter could ever personally attend to them. To make the example of the"
"present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this"
"country by individual ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation"
"meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the"
"matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers"
"a
r
e
 normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible"

o
f
 
the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were"
"not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the"
"decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer"
"before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his"
"authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior"
"s
tanding that he could not be expected competently to perform the work,"
"the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system"
"o
f
 departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that"
"m
i
n
i
s
ters, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are"
"committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the"
"p
l
ace where complaint must be made against them"".[Emphasis added]."
