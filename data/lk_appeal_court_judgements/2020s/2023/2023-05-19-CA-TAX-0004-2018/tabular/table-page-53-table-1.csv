"Retrospectivity and Prospectivity in Amending Acts"
"[140] It is relevant to note that where a repeal of  statutory provision dealing"
"with  substantive  rights  is  followed  by  new  legislation  by  enactment  of  an"
"amending Act, such new legislation is prospective  in operation. (Texmann, p."
"863).  Such  an  amendment  will  not  affect  the  substantive  or  vested  rights  of"
"parties  unless  it  is  made  retrospective  expressly  or  by  necessary  implication."
"(supra).  Thus,  an  amendment  of  substantive  law  is  not  retrospective  unless"
"expressly laid down or by necessary implication inferred (Bhagai Ram Sharma v."
"Union of India AIR 1988 SC 740). An amending Act that deals with substantive"
"rights is only retrospective if there is a clear indication in the legislative language"
"to that effect."
"[141] I would now proceed to examine whether section 163(5) of the  amending"
"Act (Act, No. 22 of 2011) is retrospective as urged by learned counsel for the"
"Respondent, and thus, whether the assessor is given a new lease of life to extend"
"the  period  given  to  make  the  assessment  from  31.03.2012  to  30.11.2012.  A"
"perusal of the amendments made to the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No."
"22  of  2011  reveals  that  they  deal  with  both  procedural  and  substantive"
"amendments.  The  amendments  made 
to  section  163(5)  of 
the  principal"
"enactment  are  prima  facie,  presumed  to  have  retrospective  effect  and  the"
"question is whether such presumption of retrospectivity applies to the present"
"case, in view of section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011."
"[142] It was contended on behalf of the Respondent that the purpose of the"
"Amending Act was designed to give more time to the assessor as the assessor"
"had only 1 year and 4 months to make the assessment in terms of the previous"
"Act, which was highly inadequate. It was also submitted that the new Act was"
"passed  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  an  omission  in  the  previous  act,  and"
