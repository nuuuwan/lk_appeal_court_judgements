"[112]  It  is  crystal  clear  that  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  contemplates  a  distinction"
"between the making of the assessment and the serving of the notice of assessment"
"and the validity of the assessment in no way depends on the notice of assessment."
"It  is  the  making  of  an  assessment  that  has  to  be  considered  to  determine  the"
"question  of  time  bar  under  section  163(5)  and  not  the  serving  of  the  notice  of"
"assessment.
