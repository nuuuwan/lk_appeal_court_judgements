"practically it cannot be done as the assessment must first be made followed by"
"a notice of assessment. His Lordship Janak de Silva, J at page 8 stated:"
"“Section 163(1) and (2) of the 2006 Act provide for making of assessment of"
"any person while section 164 requires a notice of assessment to be given to"
"a
 
person who has been so assessed. Therefore, Court rejects the submission"
"made by the learned counsel for the Appellant that no lawfully valid"
"assessment can be made without first serving a valid notice of assessment."
"There is no requirement to give notice of assessment before making an"
"assessment. Practically, it cannot be done as the assessment must first be"
"made followed by a notice of assessment..."
"The time bar to making of an assessment is set out in section 163(5) of the"
"2006 Act. The section clearly states that “no assessment” shall be made after"
"the time specified therein. Given that the 2006 Act recognizes a distinction"
"between an “assessment” and a “notice of assessment”, it would have been"
"convenient for the legislature to refer to the notice of assessment” rather"
"than “assessment” in section 163(5) of the 2006 Act. On the contrary, it has"
"been made effective for the posting of the “notice of assessment” is the"
"relevant date for the purpose of determining the time bar making an"
"assessment. Court determines that the date of making the assessment is the"
"relevant date for the purpose of determining the time bar.”"
