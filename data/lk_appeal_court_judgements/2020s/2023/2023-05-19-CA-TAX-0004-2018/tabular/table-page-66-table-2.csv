"express provision in the same Act (Shyam Sunder v. Raj Kumar (2001) 8 SCC 24)."
"In Shyam Sunder v. Raj Kumar (supra), it was stated:"
"“From the aforesaid decisions the legal position that emerges is that when a"
"repeal of an enactment is followed by a fresh legislation such legislation does"
"not effect the substantive rights of the parties on the date of suit or"
"adjudication of suit unless such a legislation is retrospective and a court of"
"appeal cannot take into consideration a new law brought into existence after"
"the judgment appealed from has been rendered because the rights of the"
"parties in an appeal are determined under the law in force on the date of suit."
"However, the position in law would be different in the matters which relate"
"to procedural law but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned"
"they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment. We are,"
"therefore, of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is"
"f
o
l
l
owed by fresh legislation by an amending Act, such legislation is"
"prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or vested rights of"
"the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary"
"i
ntendment. We are further of the view that there is a presumption against the"
"r
e
trospective operation of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed"
"to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary,"
"but an amending Act which affects the procedure is presumed to be"
"r
e
trospective, unless amending Act provides otherwise” (emphasis added)."
