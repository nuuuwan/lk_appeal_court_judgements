"[76]  It  was  absolutely  clear  that  after  the  two  interviews  were  held  and  the"
"additional income and other information with an explanation for not disclosing"
"them  earlier,  were  sent  to  the  assessor  by  the  taxpayer,  the  assessor  did  not"
"communicate in writing with his reasons for not accepting the return as required"
"by section 93(2) of the Act. The Respondents (Revenue)  were unable to to prove"
"that a letter dated 04.04.79 was sent to the taxpayer with reasons for rejecting"
"the returns, and accordingly, the notice of assessment dated 30.03.1979  was sent"
"to  the  taxpayer  without communicating  reasons  for  not  accepting the  return  in"
"total non-compliance with the provisions of section 93(2) and 93(C)(3) of the Inland"

"[77]  In  the  present  case,  however,  the  letter  of  the  assessor  dated  26.11.2012"
"states “Please treat that this letter is issued in terms of section 163 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006”. (See -letter of the assessor dated 26.11.2012 at p."
"43 of the TAC file). There was no complaint whatsoever that the reasons for not"
"accepting the return were not communicated to the Appellant by the assessor"
"and the complaint was that it was received on 06.12.2012 (p. 49 of the TAC brief)."
"In fact, the letter dated 26.11.2012 with reasons for not accepting the return has"
"been sent to the Appellant before the notice of assessment dated 30.11.2012 was"
"sent to the Appellant. The Appellant admits that the notice of assessment dated"
"30.11.2012  was  received  on  18.12.2012.  Accordingly,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"circumstances under which Victor Perera, J.  made the above quoted statement"
"is not applicable to the facts of the present case."

"Revenue appealed to the Supreme Court against the said order of the Court of"
