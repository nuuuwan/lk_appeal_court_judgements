"[10]  On  the  other  hand,  Mrs.  Jameel  submitted  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  in"
"Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue  (supra),  held  that  the"
"hearing  means  the  date  of  the  actual  oral  hearing,  which  constitutes  ratio"
"decidendi,  and  that  the  statement  made  by  Gooneratne  J.  was  only  an  obiter"
"dicta,  and  not  the  ratio  decidendi.  She  submitted  that  the  determination  has"
"been made within a period of 270 days from the date of the commencement of"
"the actual oral hearing and therefore, the TAC determination is not time barred."
"She further submitted that the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not spell out"
"any sanction for the failure on the part of the TAC to comply with the time limit"
"set  out  in  section    10  of  the  Act.  Her  contention  was  that  the  word  “shall”  in"
"section  10  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  the  provision  is  mandatory  unless"
"non-observance will result in the object of the provision being frustrated and the"
"sanction is statutorily spelled out in the Tax Appeals Commission Act."
"Statutory Provisions"
"[11] The time limit for the determination of the appeal by the TAC was originally"
"contained  in  section  10  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act,  No.  23  of  2011,"
"which stipulated that the Tax Appeals Commission shall make the determination"
