l
and Revenue  (supra)  reveals  that  the  Supreme  Court  judgment  has  the"
"following two parts."
"1. Although the amendment made to section 163(5) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009"
"is presumed to have retrospective effect, such presumption of retrospective"
"effect  will  not  apply  when  the  express  provision  in  section  27(6)  of  the"
"amending Act excludes the applicability of the general presumption (i.e. that"
"procedural laws be given  retrospective effect) and hence, the amendment"
"made to section 163(5) will operate with prospective effect from 01.04.2009"
"for  the  year  of  assessment  2007/2008  in  terms  of  section  27(6)  of  the"
"amending Act;"
"2
. The taxpayer had furnished the return prior to the amending Act came into"
"force, and thus, a right had accrued to the taxpayer under section 163(5) (a)"
"to have an assessment made within 18 months from the end of that year of"
"assessment. If the year of assessment is extended with retrospective effect,"
"it would only benefit the assessor but it deprived the taxpayer who is unable"
"to  file  a  return  within  the  extended  period  under  section  106(1),  that"
"infringes  Article  12 
(1)  of 
the  Constitutio 
that  guarantees 
the  equal"
"protection of the law;"
