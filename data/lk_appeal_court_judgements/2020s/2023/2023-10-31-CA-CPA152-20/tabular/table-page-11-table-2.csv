"ayasiri [SC Appeal No.134/14 SC Minutes 14.07.2020] court in interpreting an Amendment to"
"the  Debt  Reconciliation  Act  -  Amendment  Act  No.  29  of  1999  interpreted  the  Act  based  on  the"
"purpose of the Amending Act, which was to prevent weaker borrowers from corrupt lenders."
"It  is  true  that  the  court  in  interpreting  statutes  must  give  life  to  the  intention  of  the"
"legislature. In doing so, if the language is plain, the court must give effect to them. If the"
"words are not capable of limited construction, apply the words as they stand. It is also"
"correct to say that this amendment was brought to strengthen the weak borrower against"
"the hitherto corrupt lender and to counter his subterfuges. Thus, there is no doubt that in"
"constructing the provisions of the amending Act Judges should suppress the mischief and"
"advance the remedy."
