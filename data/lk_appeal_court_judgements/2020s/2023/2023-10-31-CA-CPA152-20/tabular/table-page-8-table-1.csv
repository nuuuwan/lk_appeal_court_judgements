"It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  impugned  revision  application  is  made  against  the  Judgment"
"pronounced by the Provincial High Court exercising Civil Appellate Jurisdiction under Section 5A"
"of  the  High  Court  of  the  Provinces  (Special  Provisions)  Act  No.  19  of  1990  as  amended  by"
"Amendment Act No. 54 of 2006."
"It has to be observed that Act No. 19 of 1990 provides for the Provincial High Court to exercise"
"Jurisdiction  over  orders  made  by  the  Magistrate’s  Court,  Labour  Tribunal,  Agrarian  Service"
"Tribunal, and orders made under the Primary Court Procedure Act."
"Pursuant to Section 5C of the said Act No. 54 of 2006, an appeal lies directly to the Supreme Court"
"with  leave  first  being  obtained  against  the  judgment  or  order  of  the  Provincial  High  Court"
"exercising  civil  appellate  jurisdiction  under  Section  5A  of  the  said  Act.  Thus,  it  appears  that  a"
"specific remedy is provided by the said Act itself."
"It is significant to note that no jurisdiction was granted over civil matters that the District Court"
"has taken cognizance of. Therefore, it is my considered view that the powers of revision granted to"

"cognizance does not include judgments and orders from the District Courts for which an appeal lie"
"directly to the Supreme Court."
"The above reasoning of the Petitioner is rooted in the analysis given by Aluwihare PC. J. in the case"
"of Wijesiri Gunawardane & Others v. Chandrasena Muthukumarana & Others [supra]. Here I"
"will  primarily  note  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  bound  by  the  precedence  of  the  Supreme  Court,"
"however, the Court of Appeal is allowed a distinguish judgment of a Supreme Court on a point of"
"law based on an interpretation of different statutory provisions and case law which may have not"
"been brought to the attention of the Supreme Court at the time of making such judgment."
"It is worth noting that there are several judgments pronounced by the Court of Appeal which has"
"not been brought to the notice of the Supreme Court when determining the said case."
"In the case of G.K.D. Stephan Gunaratne v Maddumage Thushara Indika Sampath CA (PHC)"
