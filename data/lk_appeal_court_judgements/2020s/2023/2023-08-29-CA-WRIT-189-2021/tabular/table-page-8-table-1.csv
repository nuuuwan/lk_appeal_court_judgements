"school to the Government should be taken into consideration and the total number of"
"vacancies in the School should accordingly be divided among different religions and"
"categories mentioned in Clause 7.1 in P-4(a). As per the journal entry dated 21.03.2022,"
"the Petitioner has filed a document in Court by way of a motion issued by the Ministry"
"of Education indicating the details about the students admitted to Grade 1 of Kingswood"
"College  in  the  year  2021. According  to  that  document,  the  total  number  of  students"
"admitted for the year 2021 was 140; out of them, 3 students were non-Christians. In"
"terms of Clause 7.1 of P-4(a), 50% of the total number of students should be admitted"
"based on residence and therefore out of 140 students 70 should be residents of proximity"
"to the School. On that basis in terms of P-4(d), 8% of 70 should be Methodist students."
"Therefore, the total number of Methodist students admitted to Grade 1 of the School"
"for 2021 should be 6. Nevertheless, even though there are no provisions in P-4(d) to"
"consider the students based on non-Christian, only 3 students had been admitted under"
"all  six  categories  mentioned  in  Clause  7.1  in  P-4(a).  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the"
"decision  taken  by  the  1st  Respondents  to  accommodate  3  students  based  on  non-"
"Christian is against the Circular issued by the Ministry of Education marked as P-4(a)"
"and  guidelines  marked  as  P-4(c)  and  the  directions  mentioned  in  P-4(d).  The  1st"
"Respondent does not argue that there is any other school other than Kingswood College"
"in which the child could have been admitted based on residence. Considering all the"
"above-stated  facts  and  circumstances,  I  hold  that  the  decisions  of  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Respondents marked as P15 and P17 respectively not to be admitted the child of the"
"Petitionerâ€™s son are illegal and ultra vires. Therefore, the Court decides to issue a Writ"
"of Certiorari quashing the said decisions of the 1st and 2nd Respondent and issue a Writ"
"of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to admit the child to a Grade which the"
"students  admitted  to  Grade  1  in  2021  are  now  studying  before  the  next  school  term"
