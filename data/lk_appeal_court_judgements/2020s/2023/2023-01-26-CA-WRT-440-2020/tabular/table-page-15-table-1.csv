"There are no findings either by the Supreme Court or Committee against"
"the Petitioners."
"I  further  observe  that  if  the  1st  Respondent  is  of  the  opinion  that  the"
"Petitioners  are  responsible  for  the  allegations,  the  1st  Respondent  could"
"have easily called for explanations, issued a charge sheet and held a formal"
"inquiry prior to the removal. No such actions had been taken prior to the"
"removal  of  the  Petitioners  from  their  positions  in  the  SLMC  which  is  a"
"blatant disregard of the principles of natural justice and rule of law. Since"
"there  is  no  specific  provision  in  the  Medical  Ordinance,  empowering  the"
"Minister to revoke the appointments of the members of SLMC, if a member"
"is corrupt to the limit of abusing his position in the Council, there is no"
"option  for  the  Minister  but  to  adhere  to  the  principles  of  natural  justice"
"before revoking his appointment. It is observed by this Court that, even if"
"there  are  provisions  in  law,  empowering  the  authorities  to  remove  a"
"member from his position, the authorities can do so only within the scope"
"of the principles of natural justice. The recommendation of the Committee"
"was 
that 
the 
responsible  officers  and  Council  members  should  be"
"terminated to restore the independence and function of SLMC8. It appears"
"to this Court that, in terms of the recommendation of the Committee, the"
"1st  Respondent  has  not  taken  any  steps  to  ascertain  the  responsible"
"Officers  or  Council  members.  Moreover,  I  am 
inclined  to  accept  the"
"submissions of the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners that the"
"1st Respondent (The Minister) has not complied with the recommendation"
"made by the Committee requesting the President and the Council to hold"
"the election immediately for the four vacant posts."
"I  shall  now  deal  with  the  doctrine  of  pleasure  advanced  by  the  learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  7th,  8th  and  9th  Respondents.  The  learned"
"President’s  Counsel  submits  that  the  Petitioners  were  appointed  to  the"
"SLMC at the pleasure of the predecessor of the 1st Respondent Minister,"
"and  therefore,  they  can  also  be  removed  at  the  pleasure  of  the  1st"
"Respondent Minister."
"At  this  point,  the  attention  of  this  Court 
is  drawn  to  the 
letters  of"
"revocation  wherein  it  is  stated  that  appointments  of  the  Petitioners  are"
"revoked on the basis that they are responsible for the allegations leveled"
"against  the  SLMC  and 
failed  to  perform  their  duties. 
In  short,  the"
"Petitioners have been removed from their posts by the 1st Respondent only"
"8 Page 9 of the report marked P11."
