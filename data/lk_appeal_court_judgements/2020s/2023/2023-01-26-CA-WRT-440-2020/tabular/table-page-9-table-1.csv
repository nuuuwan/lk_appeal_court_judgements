"Section 19D of the Medical (Amendment) Act No. 30 of 1987 empowered"
"the  1st  Respondent  (Minister)  to  appoint  a  person  to  inquire  into  any"
"complaints  made  against  the  SLMC  and  its  performance,  which  reads"
"thus;"
"“19D (1) The Minister may on receipt of a complaint in that behalf, direct"
"any  person  to  inquire  into  the  affairs  of  the  Medical  Council  and  the"
"performance by it, of its duties under this Ordinance."
"(2) Where such inquiry as is referred to in subsection (1) is held, every"
"member  of  the  Medical  Council,  and  every  member  of  the  staff  of  the"
"Medical Council shall upon being requested to do so by the person holding"
"the inquiry, furnish such information within his knowledge with regard"
"to the work and affairs of the Medical Council and produce such registers"
"or documents in his custody, as that person may require.”"
"In respect of the Applications in hand,  by virtue of Section 19D of the said"
"Act, the 1st Respondent had appointed a Committee comprising of the 2nd"
"to  6th  Respondents  to  inquire  into  the  complaints  leveled  against  the"
"SLMC.  As  such,  It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  said  Committee"
"appointed by the 1st Respondent is in terms of the provisions of the Medical"
"Ordinance."
"However,  it  is  alleged  by  the  Petitioners  that  the  conduct  of  the  said"
"Committee is unfair and in violation of the principles of natural justice. As"
"per  the  Report  of  the  Committee  appointed  by  the  1st  Respondent,  the"
"Government  Medical  Officers  Association  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the"
"GMOA) is the main complainant against the SLMC1 . It is pertinent to be"
"noted that the 5th Respondent (Dr. Maithree Chandrarathna) who was a"
"member  of  the  said  Committee  was  an  active  member  of  the  Election"
"Committee of the GMOA. The 6th Respondent (Dr. Dharshana Sirisena), a"
"member  of  the  Inquiry  Committee  was  also  an  active  member  of  the"
"Specialist  Transfer  Board  Committee  of  the  GMOA.  The  President  of  the"
"SLMC (1st Petitioner in 422-20) and a member of SLMC (3rd Petitioner in"
"422-20) raised these concerns with the 1st Respondent Minister by their"
"respective letters marked as P5(a) and P5(b). The P5(a) reads as follows;"
