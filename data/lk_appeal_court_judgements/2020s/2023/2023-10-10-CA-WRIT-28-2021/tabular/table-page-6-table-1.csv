"Whether the Period of Probation Relating to the Petitioner Can be Extended Beyond Three Years"
"The Chapter VIII of the said Rules (‘P5’) deals with the a.) period of probation, b.) period of"
"acting and c.) confirmation of appointment. According to Clause 94 of the said Rules, the"
"appointing  authority  shall  subject  newly  appointed  public  officers  to  a  post  in  the  public"
"service (of the Uva Province) to a probationary period of 3 years. The salient feature of the"
"said clause is that every such public officer should mandatorily be subjected to a probationary"
"period of 3 years. A question arising from one aspect of the Petitioner’s arguments, in the way"
"in which such arguments are formulated, is whether the period of probation can be extended."
"Clause 99 of the Rules stipulates a procedure that needs to be followed during the 1st and 2nd"
"years  of  the  probation.  In  view  of  those  provisions,  a  final  review  report  in  relation  to  the"
"probationer  should  be  submitted  along  with  the  1st  and  2nd  year  reports  to  the  appointing"
"authority at least three months prior to the expiry of the period of probation. During the three"
"years  of  probation,  it  is  expressly  intended  that  three  review  reports  be  made  accessible."
"According  to  the  said  Clause  99,  before  the  probationary  period  expires,  the  appointing"
"authority  is  required  to  evaluate  all  three  reports  and  issue  an  order  either  confirming  or"
"extending the probationary period."
"Therefore,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  the  period  of  probation  after  three  years  from  the"
"appointment  can  be  extended.  The  provisions  relating  to  such  extensions  beyond  the  first"
"three years are stipulated in Clause 101 of the  Rules. The Petitioner states that it is apparent"
"from reading ‘P20’, ‘P21’, and ‘P22’ that no proper extensions of the probation period have"
"been made under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the said Rules. It is clearly a misconception"
"to raise such an argument by reading the provisions in Clause 101 in isolation without reading"
"it together with the other pertinent provisions in the said Chapter VIII of the Rules.  What is"
"clearly meant in the said Clause 101 is that, the appointing authority has the power to extend"
"the period of probation by one year at a time subject to a maximum period of 03 years if the"
"officer is not fit and suitable for confirmation. The appointing authority may even defer the"
"officer’s increments."
"Even  under  section  11:7  of  the  Establishments  Code  (E-Code),  if  an  officer  is  not  judged"
"during  the  first  three  years  of  the  probation  as  fit  and  qualified  for  confirmation  either  his"
