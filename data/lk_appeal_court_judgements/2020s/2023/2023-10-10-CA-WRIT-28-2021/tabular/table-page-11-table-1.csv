"authenticated  as  a  consequence  to  the  decisions  taken  by  the  Governor  or  the  Uva-PSC."
"Therefore, I cannot accept the proposition of the Petitioner that the decisions reflected in the"
"letters such as “P3”,”P20”,”P21”,”P22” are bad in law. Although the Petitioner seeks a writ"
"of  Certiorari  against  ""P22"",  no  reasons  are  given  by  the  Petitioner  to  justify  her  challenge"
"against the said letter ""P22""."
"Conclusion"
"In  light  of  the  above,  there  is  no  necessity  to  make  an  additional  effort  to  analyze  the"
"objections in the preliminary nature raised on behalf of the Respondents and also the issues"
"such  as  the  availability  of  alternative  reliefs,  contractual  relationship,  etc.  I  see  no  valid"
"grounds, in view of the reasons given above, to grant any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer"
"of the Petition of the Petitioner. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the Application. I order no"
"costs."
