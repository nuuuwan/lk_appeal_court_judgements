"appointment can be terminated or the period of probation can be extended subject to other"
"specific provisions of the E-Code."
"Hence, I hold that the period of probation relating to the Petitioner can be extended beyond"
"the first three years provided that a proper assessment is carried out as per the provisions in"
"the Rules or the E-Code."
"Whether  the  Extension  of  the  Period  of  Probation  Made  Effective  under  and  in  Terms  of    the"
"Provisions Of  the Establishment Code is Illegal"
"The Petitioner contends that the extension of the probationary period of her employment for"
"a period of one year with effect from 28.03.2019 to 27.03.2020 (Vide “P20”), is bad in law."
"The reason given for such an assertion is that the said extension was carried out under sections"
"11:7 and 11:10 of Chapter II and section 10:4 of Chapter VII of the E-Code as appears in the"
"said letter “P20”.  The Petitioner’s argument is based on the preamble portion  of the said"
"Rules which declares  that the E-Code provisions should be applicable for matters which are"
"not covered under the Rules in “P5”. Sections 11:5, 11:7 and 11:10 of Chapter II of the E-"
"Code,  among  other  provisions,  deal  with  the  extension  of  the  probationary  period  beyond"
"three years."
