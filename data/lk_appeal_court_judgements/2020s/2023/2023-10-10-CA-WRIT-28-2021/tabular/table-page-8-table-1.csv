"It is true that the particular provisions of the E-Code are noticeable on the face of the letter"
"marked “P20”. But it is significant to observe that many provisions spelled out in the Rules"
"are notably similar to that of the E-Code, although not identical. It appears that the extension"
"of the period of probation is substantially covered under the Rules and however, one cannot"
"possibly overlook the fact that the basic concept of those provisions of the Rules is embodied"
"in the particular provisions of the  E-Code. Furthermore, the above E-Code provisions also"
"permit the appointing authority to extend the period of probation subject to an assessment."
"The only explicit difference that can be seen between the respective provisions of the Rules"
"and  the  E-Code  is  that  the  Rules  have  identified  a  specific  3-year  period  up  to  which  the"
"probationary status can be extended upon the completion of the first three years."
"Based on the circumstances of the instant Application the nexus or the relationship between"

"argument of the Petitioner. Hence, I take the view that it is not fair to employ the doctrine of"
"ultra  vires  to  issue  an  order  quashing  “P20”  solely  based  on  the  visibility  of  the  E-Code"
"provisions on the face of the said letter “P20”. The several steps taken by the Respondents"
"under and in terms of the Rules during the decision making process relevant to the instant"
"Application are not opposed effectively by the Petitioner. Similarly, the Petitioner has failed"
"to  provide  to  Court  the  adequate  material  opposing  the  assessments  carried  out  by  the"
"respective  Respondents.  I  observe  that  no  substantive  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the"
"Petitioner  due  to  the  inclusion  of  the  E-Code  provisions  in  the  document  ""P20,""  as  the"
"ultimate  outcome  would  remain  unchanged  even  if  the  Respondents  were  to  refer  to  the"
"specific Rules."
