"N. Bandula Karunarathna J."
"The 2nd accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted before the"
"High Court of Gampaha with the 1st accused person and 2 others who are dead by now for"
"attempted murder, gang rape and causing the death of 5 persons in the same family, on or"
"about 19.05.2007 at Mahawatta, Delgoda, within the jurisdiction of Gampaha High Court for"
"an offence punishable under section 296, 364 (2) (උ) and 300 of the Penal Code."
"Altogether, there were 8 charges in the indictment. At the time the indictment was served"
"before  the  High  Court  of  Gampaha,  the  two  accused  persons  namely  Mallikaarachchilage"
"Upatissa and Welivita Liyanage Don Mahesh Lasantha Perera were alive. Both of them were"
"charged under section 32 for the murders of  Thilakarathna (farther of PW 1), Ramyalatha"
"(mother of PW 1), Dilshan Maduwantha (brother of PW 1), Sajintha Lakshan (brother of PW"
"1) and Prabavathee (grandmother of PW 1)."
"The trial against the appellant commenced before the High Court Judge of Gampaha without"
"a jury on 29.08.2011, and at the conclusion of the said trial, the learned High Court Judge had"
"convicted the 2nd accused-appellant and sentenced him to death. Being dissatisfied with the"
"said conviction and sentence, the 2nd accused-appellant had preferred this appeal to the Court"
"of Appeal seeking to set aside the conviction and sentence imposed upon him. The 1st accused"
"person was acquitted and discharged from all counts in the indictment."
"The appellant had been indicted on the legal principle of 'common intention' under section"
"32 of the Penal Code which it is worded as follows;"
"'When  a  criminal  act  is  done  by  several  persons  in  furtherance  of  the  common"
"intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it"
"were done by him alone'"
"The 7th count has been preferred on the basis of `gang rape.' Thus, unlike prior to the year"
"1995, consequent to the amendment 22 of 1995 coming into force, an accused who becomes"
"liable  under  section  364(2)  for  gang  rape,  faces  a  heavy  sentence  even 
if  he  had  not"
"performed the principle act but had only abetted one or more of the perpetrators."
"Prosecution led direct evidence through Dinusha Madhurangi (PW 1) the subject of counts 6,"
"7 & 8. Other direct and circumstantial evidence too were placed by the prosecution to prove"
"their case. Upon the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the defence was called. The"
"appellant gave evidence subject to cross examination and called other witnesses as well. At"
"the conclusion of a trial, a trial Judge is able to consider direct and circumstantial evidence"
"that had been placed before him. The learned trial Judge is also legally permitted to draw"
"inferences based on such evidence as justice may demand. In the instant case, the trial Judge"
"had the opportunity to consider all these evidence."
"According to the direct evidence placed by the prosecution, on 19.5.2007 witness Madhurangi"
"(PW 1) had been asleep at home with her parents, siblings and the grandmother when the"
"incident happened. The appellant and the 1st accused had dragged her into the sitting room"
"where she had been attacked with a ‘manna knife’ on her head. She had been conscious when"
"her  clothes  were  removed  by  them.  But  thereafter  she  had 
fallen  unconscious.  The"
"prosecutrix had received treatment at the General Hospital in Colombo for 8 long months."
