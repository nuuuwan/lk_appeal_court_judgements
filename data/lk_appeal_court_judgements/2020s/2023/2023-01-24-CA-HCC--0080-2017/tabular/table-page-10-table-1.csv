"when  PW  1  was  subject  to  a  medical  examination,  she  should  have  informed the hospital"
"police or the doctor about the 2nd accused-appellant. In the medico-legal report (MLR) which"
"was filed in this case as P 10, it is clearly stated in its short history that PW 1 states that she"

"If she knew the 1st and the 2nd accused persons as villagers, she could have stated that they"

"appellant should be acquitted on this ground alone."
"The evidence against the 1st and the 2nd accused persons are the same. The only difference is"

"accused-appellant was known and seen by the victim noon and night as a person who lived in"
"the same area where the victim and her family was residing. In this situation the identity of"
"the 2nd accused-appellant by the identification parade is not according to law to make that"
"the sole criterion to convict the 2nd accused-appellant."
