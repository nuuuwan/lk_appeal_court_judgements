"beyond  reasonable  doubt  against  the  1st  accused  person.  Therefore  the  1st"
"accused person had been acquitted."
"It is important to note that in the decision of acquitting the 1st accused person, the fact that"
"he had not been identified at the Identification Parade was the criteria and the reasoning."
"Both  the  1st  and  the  2nd  accused-appellants  were  accused  of  the  same  charges.  The  2nd"
"accused-appellant was identified at the parade. Both accused were identified by the victim"
"when  she  was  giving  evidence  in  court.  The  conviction  of  the  2nd  accused-appellant  was"
"because he was identified at the identification parade. The acquittal of the 1st accused person"
"was the non-identification of him at the parade."
"It is the contention of the learned counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant that the identification"
"of the 2nd accused-appellant was based on contaminated evidence. When the 1st witness gave"
"evidence  in  the  High  Court,  both  accused  persons  were  identified.  The  1st  witness  in  her"

"held. The purpose of an identification parade is to identify an offender when the victim states"
"that she does not know the offender but states that if she sees him  again, she can identify"
"such person."
"Identification parades are not held to identify an offender who is known to the victim. If the"
"person is living in the same village and even had visited the victim's house previously, there"
"was no point of having and identification parade."
"When the Magistrate who conducted the identification parade was called to give evidence it"
"was stated in the evidence that the 2nd accused-appellant had stated that the child lives close"
"by and the child had seen the accused morning and noon."
