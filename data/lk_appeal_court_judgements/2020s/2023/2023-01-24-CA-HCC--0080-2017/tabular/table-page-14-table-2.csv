"Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;"
"‘Proved;"
"A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the"
"court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a"
"prudent  man  ought,  under  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  case,  to  act"
"upon the supposition that it exists."
"Disproved;"
"A fact is said to be disproved when, after considering the matters before it, the"
"court either believes that it does not  exist, or considers its non-existence so"
"probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular"
"case, to act upon the supposition that it does not exist."
"Not proved;"
"A fact is said not to be proved when it is neither proved nor disproved.’"
