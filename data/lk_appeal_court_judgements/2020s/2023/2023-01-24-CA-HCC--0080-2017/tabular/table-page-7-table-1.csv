"In the case of Queen vs. Sivanatam 68 NLR 350 it was held that ""it is a suspicious circumstance"
"if a witness is shown a photograph before he attends an identification parade."""
"The  case  above  states  that  showing  a  photograph  is  suspicious  prior  to  the  identification"
"parade. Then how suspicious it is when PW 1 had seen the 2nd accused-appellant morning and"
"noon?"
"The process of identification of a person who is known to a witness by name or otherwise is"
"described  as  “recognition”  as  opposed  to  “identification”.  Situations  of  “recognition”  are"
"considered more satisfactory than instances of identification. However, even in situations of"
"“recognition”  the  court  should  analyse  the  evidence  of  the  witness  who  claims  that  the"
"accused is a known person and examine whether the evidence is satisfactory to bring home"
"a conviction."
"In K. Don Anton Gratien vs The Attorney-General, C.A 226/2007 decided on 01.07.2010, the"
"Court of Appeal analysed the evidence of the sole eye witness who claimed that he knew the"
"accused, and arrived at the conclusion that the evidence was unsatisfactory. Therefore, the"
"court held that the evidence is not sufficient to establish the identity of the appellant to the"
"required standard namely, beyond reasonable doubt."
"To establish the identity of an accused, it is not mandatory the witness should have known"
"him by his name or otherwise, prior to the incident. Even in a situation where a witness had"
"seen a person at an incident for the first time, his evidence in court identifying the accused in"
"the dock as the person whom he saw at the incident should not be rejected merely because"
"the witness had neither seen him before nor had known his name prior to the incident. A"
"‘dock  identification’  is  a  valid  form  of  identification.  However,  time  and  again  courts  have"
"been mindful of the danger in convicting an accused solely based on a ‘dock identification’."
"At page 256 in Volume 1 “The Law of Evidence” by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in the context of"
"“dock identification”, it is observed as follows;"
"“This practice is undesirable and unsafe and should be avoided, if possible”."
"Court  of  Appeal  in  Munirathne  &  Others  vs  The  State,  2001  (2)  SLR  382  observed  the"
"undesirability of conviction based on dock identification."
"In  K.M.Premachandra  &  others  vs  The  Attorney-General,  C.A.  39-41/97,  decided  on"
"13.10.1996, set aside the conviction of one accused whose conviction was based on a dock"
"identification was set aside."
"In Roshan vs The Attorney-General, 2011 (1) SLR 364 at 377, it was held;"
