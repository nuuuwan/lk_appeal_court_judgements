"supplying of financial services for the purpose of the VAT treatment under section"
"25A(1) of the Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act."
"[147] In my view the investment activities of the Appellant were an integral part"
"of  the  life  insurance  business  with  an  investment  element  conducted  by  the"
"Appellant  and  the 
interest 
income  from 
investments  form  part  of  the 
life"
"insurance business. The interest income was received for the purpose of mere"
"enhancement of the value of the premium income by realizing a security which"
"is not done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of the business"
"of  supplying  of  financial  services  with a profit‐making purpose of a trading"
"company."
"[148]  The  interest  income  received  from  investment  of  premium  income  in"
"securities  and  other  similar 
instruments  generated  an 
income 
to 
the 
life"
"insurance  fund  which  may  ordinarily  give  rise  to  an  inference  that  it  was  a"
"taxable  business  income  for  the  purpose  the  income  tax  law,  which  is  totally"
"different  from  the  treatment  of  VAT  on  financial  services  under  the  VAT  Act."
"Even if the income from investment is treated as an income from life insurance"
"business  within  the  meaning  of  the  income  tax  law,  for  the  purpose  of  VAT"
"liability,  it  must  be  proved  that  the  Appellant  supplied  a  financial  service  as"
"defined in section 25F, and that such financial service was done in the business"
"of supplying financiall services. In the present case, both requirements are not"
"satisfied."
"[149] The TAC, in my view, has totally failed to consider that the life insurance is"
"not  a 
financial  service  enumerated 
in  section  25F  so  as 
to  constitute  a"
"chargeable financial service. The TAC has further failed to consider that the  life"
"insurance business is exempted from VAT and therefore, any value addition is"
"exempted from VAT in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule to"
"the  VAT  Act.  The  TAC  has  failed  to  consider  that  the  investment  of  the  life"
"insurance policy holders’ monies in Treasury Bills and other similar instruments"
"is  to  ensure  security  for  the  policy  holder  and  to  enhance  the  value  of  the"
"policyholders’ 
fund  and  not  as  granting 
loans  to  the  Government,  policy"
"holders,  staff  or  other  financial  instrument  holders  etc.  The  TAC  has  failed  to"
"consider 
that  no  evidence  has  been  placed  before 
the  assessor  or 
the"
"Respondent  or  the  TAC  that  the  Appellant  was  carrying  on  the  business  of"
"supplying financial services defined in section 25A(1)(ii) read with section 25F of"
"the  VAT  Act  or  the  interest  income  was  received  from  such  other  investment"
"business not related to life insurance business."
