"[65] Referring to section 140 (10), His Lordship Gooneratne J. states as follows:"
"“Based  on  Section  140  of  the  Act,  No.  38  of  2000,  the  legislature  intended  the"
"word ‘hearing’ to mean an oral hearing; ........."
"Section 140 (10) provides that the Board shall confirm, reduce, increase or annul"
"the  assessment  ‘after  the  hearing’  of  the  Appeal.  It  is  therefore  patently  evident"
"that  the  word  “hearing”  used  consistently  in  Section  140  of  Act  No.  38  of  2000"
"means an “oral hearing” and no more”."
"[
66]  It  is  manifest  that  the  main  argument  advanced  by  Dr.  Shivaji  Felix  before"
"Gooneratne J. was that as the legislative intention was to dispose of both appeals"
"within  a  total  period  of  four  years  and  the  time  limit  of  2  years  will  begin  to"
"operate from the date on which the Petition of Appeal is received by the Board"
"of Review and not from the date of the oral hearing. It is crystal clear that the"
"issue before His Lordship Gooneratne J. was whether the legislature intended that"
"the hearing used in the second proviso to section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act,  No.  38  of  2000  (as  amended),  for  the  calculation  of  a  two-year  time  period"
"commences from the date of the oral hearing as contended by the State or from"
"the date of the Petition of Appeal received by the Board of Review as contended"
