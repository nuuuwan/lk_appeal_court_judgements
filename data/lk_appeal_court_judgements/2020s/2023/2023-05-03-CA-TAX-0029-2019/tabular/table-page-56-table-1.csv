"assessee.  It  is  the  assessee  who  carries  on  a  business  who  is  liable  to  pay  tax"
"under  the  head  of  business.  It  is  rather  significant  to  notice  the  difference  in"
"language in Section 10, and Section 9. Section 9 deals with tax under the head"
"of  property  and  that  tax  is  payable  by  an  assessee  who  is  the  owner  of  the"
"property.  So,  in  the  case  of  property,  what  is  emphasised  by  the  Legislature  is"
"ownership. In the case of business, what is emphasised is not the ownership of"
"the business, but the fact of the business being carried on by the assessee"
"[emphasis added]."
