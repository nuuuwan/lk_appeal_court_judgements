"[110] It is not in dispute that Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued"
"under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923 (as amended) and Treasury"
"Bonds  which  are  medium 
to 
long 
term  debt 
instruments 
issued  under 
the"
"Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937 (as amended). It is not in"
"dispute 
that 
Treasury 
Bonds 
and 
Treasury 
Bills 
are government 
debt"
"securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka  and they  earn periodic interest"
"until  maturity.    Mr.  Gunetilleke  submitted  that  none  of  the  above  mentioned"
"activities  are  part  of  the 
life 
insurance  or  general 
insurance  business  of  the"
"Appellant, but they form part of the separate investment income of the Appellant"
"that  fall  within  “loans,  advance  or  credit”  in  section  25F  (g)  of  the  VAT  Act.  He,"
"apparently,  sought  to  restrict  the  life  insurance  to  the  “pure  premium  income”"
"received from the policy holders and treat the interest component of life insurance"
"received 
from  the 
investment  of  premium 
income  as  a  “separate 
investment"
"business” for the purpose of imposing VAT on financial services."
"[111]  Mr.  Nihal  Fernando  however,  submitted  that  the  insurance  business  is  a"
"highly regulated business and the life insurance business consists of a number of"
"activities.  He  submitted  that  the  lise  insurance  includes:  (a)  the  acceptance  of  a"
"premium; (b) creating a life insurance fund and making investments using the said"
"fund 
in  accordance  with  applicable  regulations;  (c)  meeting  the  management"
"expenses; (d) payment of bonuses and ultimately paying the policy holders upon"
"maturity and/or occurrence of a covered incident. He further submitted that in life"
"insurance business, when the premium is received, it is accounted for as a liability"
"and not an income and the said premium goes into a life insurance fund which has"
"to be returned to the policy holder upon maturity of the policy with bonuses or on"
"the occurrence of an event covered by the policy. His contention was that the life"
"insurance  business  is  not  merely  to  accept  a  premium  and  to  return  after  the"
"policy  maturity  or  on  the  occurrence  of  an 
insured 
incident  as 
it 
is  a  highly"
"regulated  business.  His  contention  was  that  a  premium  which  is  received  by  the"
"Appellant  in  life  insurance  is  not  consumed  during  the  year  like  in  the  case  of"
"general insurance but becomes accumulated in a fund."
"[112]  The  determination  of  this  aspect  of  the  case  is  limited  to  the  question"
"whether the interest income received by the Appellant is tied to the life insurance"
"fund  with  an  investment  element,  or  it  was  received  from  a  separate  investment"
"business,  which  is  unrelated  to  the  policy  holders’  monies  included  in  the  life"
"insurance  fund.  In  this  context,  it  is  necessary  to  look  at  the  nature  of  the  life"
"insurance  contract  and 
its 
investment  portfolios 
in  carrying  on  the 
insurance"
