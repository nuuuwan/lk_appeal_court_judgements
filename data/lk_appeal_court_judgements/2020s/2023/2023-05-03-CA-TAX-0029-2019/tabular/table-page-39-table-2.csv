"242 states:"
"“Generally, when the definition of a word begins with “means” it is indicative of"
"the fact that the meaning of the word has been restricted: that is to say, it would"
"not  mean  anything  else  but  what  has  been 
indicated 
in 
the  definition"
"else……Therefore,  unless  there  is  any  vagueness  or  ambiguity,  no  occasion  will"
"arise  to 
interpret  the  term 
in  a  manner  which  may  add  something  to  the"
"meaning  of  the  word,  which  ordinarily  does  not  mean  by  the  definition  itself,"
"more  particularly,  where 
it 
is  a  restrictive  definition”
