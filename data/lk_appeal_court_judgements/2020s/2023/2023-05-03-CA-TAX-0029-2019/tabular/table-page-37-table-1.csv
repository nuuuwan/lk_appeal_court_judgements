"financial  services”  is  not  tenable.  Therefore,  these  transactions  fall  under  the"
"definition of “supply of financial services” set out in section 25F of the VAT Act”."
"Exemption of life insurance from VAT"
"[95] Now, I desire to consider the question whether the life insurance business is"
"specifically excluded from the supply of financial services as defined in section 25F"
"of the VAT Act. Mr. Nihal Fernando, submitted that in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II"
"(b)  of  the  First  Schedule  to  the  VAT  Act,  life  insurance  was  specifically  excluded"
"and  when  VAT  on  financial  services  was  introduced,  the  legislature  deliberately"
"reproduced all items from item (a) to (h) of (x) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule. He"
"submitted,  however,  that  the  legislature  deliberately  left  them  out  and  did  not"
"reproduce  the  item  (i)  of  (x)  of  Part  II  (b)  of  the  First  Schedule,  namely  the  life"
"insurance.  His  contention  was    that  the  legislature  did  not  intend  to  define  life"
"insurance business as part of supply of financial services under section 25F of the"
"VAT Act."
"[96] Mr. Gunetilleke, however, argued that after the VAT on financial services was"
"introduced by the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 2003 and further amended by"
"the subsequent VAT  (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004, VAT on  financial services"
"applied  “notwithstanding”  the  provisions  of  Chapters  I,  II  and  III  and  item  (xi)  of"
"the  First  Schedule.  He  argued  that  what  was  taxable  as  “financial  services”  under"
"Chapter  IIIA  of  the  VAT  Act  is  not  defined  in  section  25F  of  the  VAT  Act  and,"
"therefore, the activities in subparagraphs (a) to (g) are taxable as financial services,"
"notwithstanding the fact that these same items appear under item (xi) in Part I of"
"Schedule 1. In view of Mr. Gunetilleke’s submission that VAT on financial services"
"applied  to  the  Appellant  “notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Chapters  I,  II,  III  and"
"item  (xi)  of  the  First  Schedule,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  whether  the  exemption"
"for  life  insurance  set  out  in  item  (x)  (i)  of  Part  II(b)  of  the  First  Schedule  is"
"inapplicable to life insurance."
"[97] Section 8 of the VAT Act provides that the supply of goods and services in the"
"First  Schedule  to  the  VAT  Act  are  not  taxable  unless  zero  rated  under  section  7."
"Prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  VAT  on  financial  services,  item  (xi)  (i)  of  the  First"
"Schedule  to  the  VAT  Act,  No.  14  of  2002  excluded  life  insurance,  “Agrahara”"
"Insurance  and  crop  and  livestock  insurance”  from  VAT.  VAT  on  financial  services"
