"Whether investments in securities and other financial instruments fall within"
"the phrase “loan, advance or credit in section 25F(g) of the VAT Act"
"[107] Mr. Gunetilleke however, submitted that while life insurance is excluded from"
"VAT,  the  VAT  on  financial  services  is  calculated  having  separated  the  premium"
"income received from the Appellant’s life insurance  business which is VAT exempt."
"He  submitted  that  the  activities  in  question  relate  to  investment  income  of  the"
"Appellant,  which  fall  within  “loans,  advance  or  credit”  in  section  25F,  which  is"
"chargeable with VAT. He argued that the activities set out in subparagraphs (a)-(g)"
"of  section  25F  are  taxable  as  financial  services,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  life"
"insurance is not listed in section 25F of the VAT Act.  It was the contention of Mr."
"Gunetilleke 
that  certain  activities  of 
the  Appellant’s  business,  namely, 
the"
"activities in subparagraph 25F(g)-“the provision of any loan , advance and credit”"
"falls  within  the  definition  of  financial  services  in  terms  of  section  25F  of  the  VAT"
"Act.  He  submitted  that  none  of  the  fifteen  activities  identified  by  the  assessor  is"
"life or general insurance business, but are investment income falling within “loan,"
"advance and credit” in section 25F(g) of the VAT Act."
"[108] He strongly relied on the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance, No. 7"
"of  1937 
(as  amended)  and 
submitted 
that  when 
the  Government 
issued"
"securities, it is raising  a loan and thus, any person who purchases  such securities"
"issued by the Government is providing a loan to the Government. His submission"
"was  that, 
in  addition  to 
investment  of 
life 
insurance  business 
in  government"
"securities, the Appellant was also involved in the provision of interest bearing loan,"
"advance  and  credit  using  other 
investments  which  are  also 
liable  to  VAT  on"
"financial services. Mr.  Gunetilleke, thus submitted that, therefore, the Appellant is"
"liable for VAT on financial services  under Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act."
"Provision of Loan, advance or credit"
"[109] It is not in dispute that the provision of loan, advance or  credit constitutes"
"financial  services  as  defined  in  section  25F  of  the  VAT  Act.  The  provision  of  any"
"loan,  advance  or  credit  is  wide  enough  to  encompass  activities  such  as-  (a)  loan"
"facilities 
(that 
include  the  granting  of  credit  or  secured  or  unsecured  credit"
"facilities,  the  receipt  of  fees  received 
in  respect  of  such  services,  charges  for"
"making arrangement for the granting of credit; (b) provision of credit facilities that"
"include  purchase  or  repurchase  arrangements  and  credit  of  the  investments  in"
"stocks, investments or business purposes."
