"whether it was made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for"
"profit-making. Lord Justice Clerk further stated that:"
"“….it is not enough that the gain arose in the operation of business; it must also"
"have  arisen  pursuant  to  the  carrying  out  of  a  scheme  for profit-making.  Put"
"another way, the distinction is between the profit that arises when property has"
"been committed to a business as part of its stock in trade and is then realised in"
"the  course of  trading  operations  and  the  gain  that  arises  from  a  realisation  of"
"property not so committed. The former is taxable income, the latter not”."
