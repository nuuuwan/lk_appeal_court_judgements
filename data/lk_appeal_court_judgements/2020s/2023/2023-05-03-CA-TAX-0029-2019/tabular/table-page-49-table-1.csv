"principles  developed  incrementally  by  case  law.  The  fact  that  certain  gains  are"
"attributable 
to 
investments  held 
in 
statutorily  mandated 
insurance 
funds"
"cannot automatically divest  the  relevant  tribunal  of  its  proper  role  in  deciding"
"whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the gains are properly attributable to"
"the 
revenue 
or 
capital 
account.  Otherwise, 
any 
regulatory 
body  would"
"theoretically be able to determine the taxation of companies. This runs counter to"
"the 
fact 
that 
regulatory 
frameworks  are  often 
shaped  by 
intricate  policy"
"considerations which may have little or nothing to do with tax."
"Moreover, the distinction between the insurance fund and the shareholders’ fund,"
"whilst relevant, cannot be determinative of the tax treatment of particular assets"
"or investments. Clearly, gains arising from the shareholders’ fund could be taxed"
"as income as well. In our judgment, insurance companies (whether holding assets"
"in the insurance fund or shareholders’ fund) should only be taxed according to the"
"ordinary  principles  of  revenue  law,  albeit  the  holding  of  an  asset  in  a  particular"
"fund  may  be  a 
relevant factor in  ascertaining  whether 
the 
investment  was"
"intended to be held as a capital asset”."
