"Referring to the speech of Lord Denning MR, Lord Simonds said at page 841: “It"
"appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin"
"disguise of interpretation”, Lord Simonds further stated at 841:"
"“The  duty  of  the  court  is  to  interpret  the  words  that  the  legislature  has  used;"
"those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power and duty of the"
"court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited. If a gap"
"is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act and not in a usurpation of the"
"legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation”."
