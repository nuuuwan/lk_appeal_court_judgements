"[74] In the light of the above discussion, I am of the opinion that, the portion of"
"the  statement  of  Gooneratne  J.  in  question  cannot  have  the  character  of  a  ratio"
"decidendi but a mere  casual statement or observation or remark which does not"
"form the part of the legal principle upon which the case was decided and thus, it"
"has no authoritative value."
"[75] For those reasons, I have no reasons to disagree with the decisions of Janak"
"de  Silva,  J.  in  Stafford  Motor  Company  Limited  v.  The  Commissioner  General  of"
"Inland  Revenue  (supra)  and  Kegalle  Plantations  PLC  v.  Commissioner  General  of"
"Inland Revenue (supra).  For those reasons, I am in agreement with the reasoning"
"of  His  Lordship  Janak  de  Silva  J. 
in  the  above-mentioned  decisions  that  the"
"statement of His Lordship Gooneratne J. in  Mohideen v. Commissioner General of"
"Inland  Revenue  (supra)  is  obiter  dicta  statement  and  the  time  limit  specified  in"
"section 10 is not intended to be mandatory."
"[76]  We 
took 
the  same  view 
in  our 
judgments 
in  Mr.  S.P.  Muttiah  v.  The"
"Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue,CA/TAX/46/2019,decided  on  26.06.2021"
"and Amadeus Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. CGIR (C.A Tax 4/19 decided on 30.07.2021. In Mr."
"S.P.  Muttiah  v.  The  Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue  (supra),  we  further"
"held 
that 
“If  we 
interpret 
the 
legislative 
intent  of  Section  10 
from 
its  mere"
"phraseology,  without  considering  the  nature,  purpose,  the  design,  the  absence  of"
"consequences  of  non-compliance  and  practical  impossibility,  which  would  follow"
"from  construing  it  one  way  or  the  other,  it  will  tend  to  defeat  the  overall  object,"
"design,  the  purpose  and  spirit  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act”  (pp77-78).  We"
"further  held  that  the  directory  interpretation  of  section  10  is  consistent  with  the"
"object, purpose and design of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, which is reflected"
"in  the 
intention  of  the 
legislature.  We  held  that 
if  a  gap 
is  disclosed 
in  the"
"Legislature,  the  remedy  lies  is  an  amending  Act,  and  not  in  a  usurpation  of  the"
"legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation."
"[77]  For 
those 
reasons, 
I  hold 
that 
the  determination  of 
the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission in the present case is not time barred and thus, I answer the Question"
"of Law No. 1 in favour of the Respondent."
"Questions of Law Nos. 2-9"
"[78] The questions of law, 2-9 are closely connected to each other and therefore,"
"they will be dealt with together in this judgment. Mr.   Nihal Fernando submitted"
"that  for  the  Appellant  to  fall  within  the  charging  section  (s.  25A  of  the  VAT  Act),"
