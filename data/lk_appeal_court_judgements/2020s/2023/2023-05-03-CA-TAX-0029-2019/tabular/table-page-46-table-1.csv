"least, an investment (Malcolm A. Clarke, The Law of Insurance Contracts, 5th Ed. P"
"16). What distinguishes it from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield,"
"depends  on  the  contingencies  of  human  life  (Supra).  Any  activity  which  involves"
"the investment of the customers’ premiums, carry an element of risk for the insurer"
"of  the  life  insurance  product  or  which  can  properly  be  seen  as  an  insurance  risk"
"(Supra). Such an operation might be regarded as an activity which is related to the"
"maintenance  and  preservation  of 
life 
insurance 
fund  and  payment 
to 
the"
"customers by way of bonuses and other corresponding  benefits to the insurer."
"[117] The insurer to carry on business requires authorization under the Regulation"
"of  Insurance  Industry  Act,  No.  43  of  2000,  and  therefore,  it  is  only  the  insurer"
"effecting  life  insurance,  who  is  exempt  under  the  provisions  in  the  VAT  Act  (S."
"Balaratnnam,  VALUE  ADDED  TAX  IN  SRI  LANKA,  p.  606).  Now  the  question  is"
"whether 
the 
regulatory 
framework  provided 
in 
the  Regulation  of 
Insurance"
"Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 prevents the Appellant from carrying on the business"
"of financial services defined in section 25A(1)(ii) of the VAT Act."

"[118] I desire now to examine the Appellant’s argument vied the regulatory regime"
"established  by  the  Regulation  of  Insurance  Industry  Act  does  not  permit  the  life"
"insurance company to engage  in finance business, and therefore,  the Appellant’s"
"life  insurance  business  is  distinct  from  the  business  of  carrying  on  the  supply  of"
"finance  services.  Mr.  Nihal  Fernando  strongly  relied  on  the  provisions  of  the"
"Regulation  of 
Insurance 
Industry  Act,  No.  43  of  2000  and  argued 
that 
the"
"insurance  business 
is  a  separate  and  distinct  business  which  prohibits  a 
life"
"insurance company to engage in  the finance business unless approval is obtained"
"from 
the 
Insurance  Board.  He 
further 
submitted 
that 
there 
is  no  material"
"whatsoever,  that  the  Appellant  was 
involved 
in  other  business  activities  and"
"therefore, the entire interest income of the Appellant should be treated as having"
"received from the life insurance business."
"[119]  Section  12  of  the  Regulation  of  Insurance  Industry  Act  provides  that  no"
"person  shall  carry  on  insurance  business  in  Sri  Lanka  unless  such  person  has"
"registered under the Act and that no registered person shall carry on any form of"
"business other than insurance business unless such person is permitted to carry on"
"financial services business. Section 12 provides:"
