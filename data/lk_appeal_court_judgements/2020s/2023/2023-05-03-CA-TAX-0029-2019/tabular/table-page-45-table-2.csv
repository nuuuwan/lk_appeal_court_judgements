"test):",""
"","1. a contract whereby, for some consideration, the insured secures some benefit,"
"","usually but not necessarily, the payment of  money, upon the happening of"
"","some event. It must be a contract for the payment of a sum of money or for"
"","some corresponding benefit;"
"2.","the  event  must  involve  some  amount  of  uncertainty,  either  that  the  event"
"","will ever happen or at the time at which it will happen;"
"3.","the  event  must  be  adverse  to  the  interest  of  the  insured,  such  that  the"
"","payment meets some loss or other detriment on the happening of the event"
"","i.e. there must be an insurable interest in the subject matter (otherwise the"
"","contract is one of wager);"
"4.","in the case of life insurance, the interest is not the measure of loss."
