"ordinary  principles  of  revenue  law,  albeit  the  holding  of  an  asset  in  a  particular"
"fund  may  be  a 
relevant factor in  ascertaining  whether 
the 
investment  was"
"intended to be held as a capital asset”."
"[124] In my view, the purpose of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act is for the"
"regulation of the insurance business for the protection of policy holders’ deposits"
"in  investments  and  the  prohibition  of  insurance  companies  from  engaging  in"
"financial services without authorization. The VAT liability of an insurance company"
"is  solely  determined  by  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  through  the  VAT  Act"
"which is interpreted by the Courts and relevant tribunals.  Now the question is to"
"consider  the  relationship  between  the 
insurance  business  and  the 
investment"
"income derived from the policyholders’ premium income in the life insurance fund"
"and the relevant VAT liability arising therefrom. It is necessary to consider whether"
"the 
investment  activities  carried  out  by  the  Appellant  were  required  to  earn"
"income for the purpose of carrying on its insurance business and if so, whether the"
"activities  carried  out  by  the 
insurance  must  be  held  to  be  a  part  of  the 
life"
"insurance business"
"The role of investment income in the life insurance business- the Investment"
"is part of the life insurance"
"[125] The crucial question is whether the interest income was a mere enhancement"
"of  value  of  the  premium  income  of  the  life  insurance  fund  from  investment  by"
"realizing a securities and other financial instruments. If not, the question is whether"
"it was made in the course of carrying on the business of supplying of the financial"
"services for sole profit-making defined in section 25F(g).  In determining the scope"
"of  VAT,  it  is  therefore  necessary  to  draw  a  distinction  between  the  life  insurance"
