"New Zealand Ltd: (1999) 19 NZTC 15,135 stated:"
"“The  principle  expressed 
in  the  Californian  Copper  Syndicate  case  has  been"
"applied  time  and  time  again 
in  considering  the  taxability  of  gains  on  the"
"realisation  of  investments  by  banks  and  insurance  companies.  The  nature  of"
"banking and insurance requires businesses in those fields to invest a substantial"
"part of their funds in readily realisable investments in order to meet, in the case"
"of banks, the demands of their customers and, in the case of insurers, the claims"
"of  policy  holders.  The  realisation  of  such  assets  is  a  normal  step  in  carrying  on"
"the banking (or insurance) business or in other words it is an act done in what is"
"truly the carrying on of the business”.  [Ibid 15,138]."
