"create a reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution. He averred that"
"although the Magistrate had concluded that the Petitioner had driven at"
"a  very  high  speed that  there  is  no reliable evidence adduced by  the"
"prosecution  to  establish  this 
fact. 
  Hence,  he  submitted  that  the"
"prosecution had failed to  establish the  charge of  criminal negligence"
"under Section 298 of the Penal Code."
"The  Counsel  further  averred  that  even 
if 
the  contention  of 
the"
"prosecution that the Petitioner had gone mostly on the left hand side of"
"the road and caused this accident that it is not sufficient to prove the high"
"degree  of  negligence  which  is  necessary to  prove  the  charge  under"
"Section 298 of the Penal Code.  He further said that there were no break"
"marks on the road or on the grass by the side of the road.  Therefore, his"
"main contention was that there was no sufficient evidence to prove the"
"charge under Section 298 of the Penal Code for which the Magistrate had"
"convicted the Petitioner for 01-year rigorous imprisonment."
"The Counsel appearing for the Respondents stated at the very outset that"
"he  is  surprised at  the  submissions of  the  Counsel for  the  Petitioner"
"because, in the High Court, the Petitioner had very clearly stated that he"
"would  not  be  canvassing  the  conviction  of  the  Magistrate  but  only"
"challenging the sentence imposed under Section 298 of the Penal Code."
"Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had referred to that position in"
"his  order  and  had  considered  only  the  sentence 
imposed  by  the"
"Magistrate."
"On perusal of the  proceedings in  the  High  Court, this Court also can"
"observe that the submission of the Counsel for the Respondent is correct."
"But we note that before this Court, the Counsel for the Petitioner did not"
"at least mention the position he had taken up in the High Court.  It is a"
"well-established  principle  of 
law  that  when  a  party  file  a  revision"
"application, the  parties is invoking the  discretionary powers of Court."
"Therefore, all parties must divulge all facts relating to the application.  It"
"is said that the party filing a revision application in  Court must come"
"before Court with clean hands.  But here we observe that it had not taken"
"place."
"But nevertheless, in the interest of justice we observe that the learned"
"Magistrate in  the Magistrateâ€™s Court had considered the evidence led"
"before him.   The Magistrate had observed that the accident pertaining"
"to the instant matter had been a head on crash and the jeep driven by"
