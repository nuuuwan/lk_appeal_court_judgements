"the  Petitioner  had tried  to  overtake  a  vehicle  and  at  that  point the"
"motorcyclist who had come from the opposite direction had collided with"
"the jeep.  The cyclist had been caught under the front right tire of the"
"jeep. 
  The  Magistrate  had  disregarded  the  evidence  given  by  the"
"Petitioner  on  the  contradictions  and  the  omissions 
in  his  police"
"statement.    Hence,  he  had  decided  that  the  vehicle  driven  by  the"
"Petitioner had been mostly on the right side of the road as a result of"
"which it had collided with the motorcyclist who had been coming on the"
"opposite side and had caused the death of the motorcyclist."
"Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that there is no illegality or any"
"exceptional conclusion which is contrary to law or to the facts of the case"
"in the order of the Magistrate.  Although the Petitioner had failed to be"
"consistent in his submissions in the High Court and before us, considering"
"facts and the law pertaining to the instant matter, we see no exceptional"
"reason or illegality to reverse the order of the learned Magistrate and the"
"learned High Court Judge.  But we note that the incident had taken place"
"as way back as in 2001.  Therefore, although the conviction of the learned"
"Magistrate is affirmed in view of the changes that may have taken place"
"in the life of the Petitioner, we vary the sentence imposed by the learned"
"Magistrate in the first charge of the rigorous imprisonment of 01 year to"
"be  suspended  for  10  years  to  be  operative  from  the  date  of  the"
"conviction.  The rest of the sentences imposed by the learned Magistrate"
"for the charge under Section 298 and for other charge under the Motor"
"Traffic Ordinance to  remain as it  is.  Subject to  the  said variation, the"
"instant application for revision is dismissed."
