"same”."
"Here too, what is referred to is the “decision” as against the “determination” of"
"the Commission."
"What shall the Court of Appeal do when it receives such a case stated? Section"
"11A.(6) says,"
"“11A. (6) Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and"
"determine  any  question  of  law  arising  on  the  stated  case  and  may  in"
"accordance with the decision of the Court upon such question, confirm,"
"reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined by the Commission,"
"or  may  remit  the  case  to  the  Commission  with  the  opinion  of  the"
"Court,  thereon.  Where  a  case 
is  so  remitted  by 
the  Court,  the"
"Commission shall revise the assessment in accordance with the opinion"
"of the Court”."
"Hence, any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may,"
"(i) 
determine any question of law arising on the stated case,"
"I
t does not say may determine the “determination” of the Commission."
"(ii) 
confirm,  reduce,  increase  or  annul  the  assessment  determined  by"
"the Commission,"
"or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion of the 
(iii)"
"Court, thereon."
"T
his  may  or  may  not  be  on  the  “determination”  of  the  Commission,"
"because the term “thereon” refers to “any question of law arising on the"
"stated case”."
