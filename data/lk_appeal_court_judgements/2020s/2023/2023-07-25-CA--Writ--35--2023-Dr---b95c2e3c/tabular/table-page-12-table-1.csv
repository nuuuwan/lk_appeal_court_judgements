"Therefore, even on a consideration of the balance of convenience I am of the view that the balance"
"of  convenience  lies  in  favour  of  the  petitioners  as  the  damage  that  would  be  caused  to  the"
"petitioners would be greater than that to the respondents. Therefore, I am of the view that this is"
"a fit case to extend the interim order prayed for in prayer (f) to the petition dated 23.01.2023 until"
"the final determination of the petitionersâ€™ application."
"Respondents can file their objections on or before 31.08.2023."
"Counter objections can be filed on or before 07.09.2023."
"Arguments on 22.09.2023 and 26.09.2023 at 1.30 p.m."
"This court, strongly of the view that the final judgement should be delivered within 3 months from"
"today."
