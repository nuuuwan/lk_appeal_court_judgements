"The following passage in 'Administrative Law' by Wade and Forsyth (11th Edition, Oxford)"
"at p. 373, referring to procedural justice is very much apt here:"
"""Just as the courts can control the substance of what public authorities do by means of the"
"rules relating to reasonableness, improper purposes, and so forth, so through the principles of"
"natural justice they can control the procedure by which they do it......It is true that the rules"
"of natural justice restrict the freedom of administrative action and that their observance costs"
"a certain amount of time and money. But time and money are likely to be well spent if they"
"reduce friction in the machinery of government; and it is because they are essentially rules for"
"upholding fairness and so reducing grievances that the rules of natural justice can be said to"
"promote efficiency rather than impede it."""
