"respect of the said acquisition and such gazette notifications are marked as ‘3R1’, ‘3R4’"
"and ‘3R5’ respectively."
"One of the arguments raised by the Petitioner is that the above section 7 Notice (‘3R5’) is"
"invalid and/or of no force or avail as far as the ‘Walauwwa’ is concerned. The contention"
"of the Petitioner is that the lot No. 507 described under item 56 of the said Notice does not"
"in any manner whatsoever refer to the 'Walauwwa'. It is submitted that in the absence of a"
"due notice providing a proper description of the 'Walauwwa' the 3rd Respondent's action"
"of requiring (by ‘3R6’) the Petitioner to attend the inquiry in relation to the payment of"
"compensation was arbitrary and or unfounded and or not in accordance with law."
"In spite of the above, the Petitioner strenuously argues that when a building is declared a"
"protected monument the entire premises is protected under the Antiquities Ordinance and"
"not only the building itself. Similarly, the Petitioner contends that the Respondents have"
"failed to follow the expressed procedure laid down in section 43A of the said Ordinance."
"The Petitioner further argues that in terms of section 48 of the said Ordinance, the term"
"'archaeological  heritage’  refers  to  a  wide  array  of  places  and  the  ‘Walauwwa’  falls  well"
"within the ambit of an archaeological heritage."
"In such a backdrop, I must examine whether the 4th Respondent or other Respondents"
"have followed the due procedure prescribed in the said Ordinance.  By virtue of section"
"43A  of  the  Ordinance,  it  is  required  that  the  Director  General  of  the  Department  of"
"Archaeology issues a report and also cause an impact assessment survey to be carried out"
"prior to any encroachment taking place on or near a protected monument."
"Section 43A-"
