"The Petitioner also asserts that the said vibration test was conducted on a particular day"
"between two public holidays when there has been reduced traffic movement along the said"
"road. Another allegation against the said NBRO report is that the purported scientists who"
"have placed their signatures therein have not identified themselves and further, it does not"
"confirm that those persons have actually carried out the respective vibration test."
"On a careful perusal of the said NBRO Report, it is implied that the concluding remarks"
"of  the  unidentified  Coordinating  Scientists  referred  to  ‘Type  3’  structures  which  are"
"considered as ‘single and two-storied houses and buildings, made of lighter construction,"
"using  lightweight  materials  such  as  bricks,  cement  block  etc.  not  designed  to  resist"
"earthquakes’.  It  can  be  assumed  easily  that  the  ‘Walauwwa’  comes  within  the  ‘Type  4’"
"structure  stipulated  in  the  said  Report.  As  per  Table  03  of  the  said  Report  the  Type  4"
"structures are: ‘structures that, because of their sensitivity to vibration do not correspond"
"to those listed above 1, 2 & 3, & declared as archaeologically preserved structures by the"
"Department of Archaeology’."
"As opposed to the Petitioner's above arguments the Respondents assert that the vibration"
"will  have  no  impact  on  the  protected  monument  irrespective  of  the  type  of  structure"
"whether it is Type 3 or Type 4. Anyhow, no substantive reason has been provided by the"
"Respondents as to why the said Coordinating Scientists have not specifically referred to"
"Type 4 structures when they arrived at the conclusion therein. I am unable to accept the"
"proportion  of  the  Respondents  right  away  as  it  is  not  fair  to  interpret  the  opinions  or"
"phrases  in  the  Report  prepared  by  so-called  experts  merely  on  assumptions  without"
"scientific  or  other  factual  explanations.  This  Court  is  unaware  as  to  why  there  are  two"
"categories namely Type 3 and Type 4 and different gauges depicted under the column -"
"“Vibration in ppv (mm/sec)” in the said Table 03."
"In  contrast  to  the  said  NBRO  Report,  the  Petitioner  places  reliance  on  three  reports"
"submitted by one Eng. Anuradha De Silva marked ‘P15’, ‘P17’ and ‘P23’.  Eng. De Silva’s"
"professional opinion upon the contents of the aforesaid NBRO Report has been set out in"
"‘P23’. Referring to increasing traffic in the future, Eng. De Silva has predicted an increase"
"in vibration levels over the time and accordingly, he states that vibration testing cannot be"
"used with any certainty as a definite tool to predict future vibration impacts. Further, he"
"has  observed  that  the  contractor  has  failed  to  take  remedial  measures  to  minimize  the"
"impact on the structures during the proposed development due to the failure to monitor"
"the vibration levels at the right phase of construction. In addition to several contentions of"
