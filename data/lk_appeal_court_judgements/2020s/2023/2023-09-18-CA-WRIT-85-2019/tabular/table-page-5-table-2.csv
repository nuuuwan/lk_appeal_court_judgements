"(4) The provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the"
"contrary in any other law."
"The Petitioner submits that on a bare reading of the Respondents' objections, it does not"
"appear that any report and/or impact assessment survey has been carried out by the 4th"
"Respondent- Director-General of Archaeology. Anyhow, the Assistant Director (Central)"
"of  the  Department  of  Archaeology  by  letter  marked  ‘’4R1’  has  informed  the  Chief"
"Engineer of the RDA that he had submitted a report after visiting the relevant site. Further,"
"the said Assistant Director recommended the road development project be carried out only"
"after a vibration test conducted by an appropriate institution confirming the fact that no"
"damage would be caused to the ‘Walauwwa’ due to such development work."
"The attention of this Court was drawn by the Respondents to the Report issued after a"
"vibration test conducted by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) which"
"has  been  tendered  to  Court  by  way  of  a  motion  dated  19.05.2022.    The  Petitioner's"
"disagreement with the said Report is mainly twofold. Firstly, he submits that the NBRO"
"has issued the said Report without notice to the Petitioner and only in the presence of one"
"witness.  Secondly,  he  claims  that  the  said  NBRO  Report  has  not  identified  the  type  of"
"structure correctly."
"The Petitioner complains that only two officers (though the Report states that four officers"
"were  present)  arrived  at  the  site  for  the  said  Vibration  test  and  entered  the  premises"
"deceiving the caretaker, stating that they were from the so-called “AG office” (Vide ‘P22’)."
