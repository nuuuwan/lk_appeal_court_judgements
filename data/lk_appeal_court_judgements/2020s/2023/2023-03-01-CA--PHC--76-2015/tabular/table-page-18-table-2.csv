"to be afterwards asserted, in either of these cases lapse of time and delay"
"are most material.” (At page 341)"
"In  the  case  of,  Liyanage  &  Another  vs  Ratnasiri  -  Divisional  Secretary,  Gampaha  &"
"Others  [2013]  1  SRI.L.R,  Supreme  court  recognized  the  maxim,  Vigilantibus  non"
"dormientibus jura subveniunt, which means law assists only those who are vigilant and"
"not those who sleep on their rights. It is the responsibility of the individual to be"
"aware of their rights and to take the necessary steps to protect them. Accordingly,"
"individuals who are not vigilant in protecting their rights may not be able to rely on"
"law to assist them."
"The 2nd and 3rd Appellants have neither joined the revision application in the High"
"Court nor initiated their own applications by way of revision. Therefore, 2nd and 3rd"
"Appellants are guilty of laches and they have slept over their legal rights without"
"providing a proper explanation for doing so. The 2nd and 3rd Appellants are therefore"
"not entitled to come before this court now and file an appeal to the Judgement of"
"the High Court as they have acted as if they waived off their right to proceed with"
"invoking revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court,  which also  indicates that they"
"are satisfied with the decision of the Magistrate’s court."
"Since the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate,"
"if Court of Appeal accepts the appeals made by the 2nd and 3rd Appellants against"
"the Order of the High Court, it amounts to an appeal preferred against the Order of"
"the learned Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in terms of section 66 of the Primary"
"Courts’  Procedure  Act,  which does not  provide  a right  of  appeal.  Hence,  it  is  my"
"view that 2nd and 3rd Appellants are precluded from filing petitions of appeal against"
"the  Order  of  the  High  Court  exercising  revisionary  jurisdiction  against  the  Order"
"made under Part VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No.44 of 1979."
"Therefore,  we  are  not  inclined  to  entertain  the  appeals  made  by  the  2nd  and  3rd"
"Appellants."
