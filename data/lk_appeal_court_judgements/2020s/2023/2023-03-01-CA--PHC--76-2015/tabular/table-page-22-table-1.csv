"â€œRevision is a discretionary remedy; it is not available as of right. This power"
"that flows from Art. 138 is exercised by the Court of Appeal, on application"
"made  by  a  party  aggrieved  or  ex  mero  motu,  this  power  is  available  even"
"where there is no right of appeal. The Petitioner in a Revision application only"
"seeks the indulgence of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice. He does not"
"assert  it  as  a  right.  Revision  is  available  unless  it  is  restricted  by  the"
"constitution or any other law""."
