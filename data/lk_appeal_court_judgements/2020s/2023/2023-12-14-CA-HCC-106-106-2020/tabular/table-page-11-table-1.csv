"Punchibanda v. The Queen 74 NLR 494,  Sirimane, J  in held that;."
"“The  evidence,  in  our  view,  falls  short  of  establishing  a  common-murderous"
"intention shared by the appellants."
"Learned Crown Counsel submitted that if the 2nd and the 3rd Accused appellants"
"had  formed  a  common  intention  with  the  1st  Accused-appellant  to  merely  assault  the"
"deceased, and if the 1st Accused-appellant stabbed him to death, then, even if the 2nd and"
"the 3rd Accused-appellants had no knowledge that the 1st Accused-appellant was armed,"
"or that he would use the knife to kill the deceased, still, they (the 2nd and the 3rd Accused-"
"appellants) would be guilty of murder. In other words, that under section 32 of the Penal"
"Code a person can be found guilty of murder on the basis of common intention, even if"
"that person did not share a murderous intention with the person who actually committed"
"the act, if the act was done in furtherance of a common intention to commit some other"
"offence. No authority was cited to us for this proposition. On the contrary, our Courts have"
"always held that a common murderous intention must be shared before a person can be"
"convicted of murder on an application of section 32. (see e.g. King v. Assappu)"

"that;"
"“It is manifest that learned trial Judge has used the term common intention only in one"
"solitary passage in his judgment at page 181, He has culpably failed to consider the acts"
"of participation on the part of each one of those Accused separately, to analyse these acts"
"and relate them to the principles of law relating to common intention and having regard"
"to their respective acts to determine whether they were actuated by a common intention."
"Justice Dias in King v. Asappu (1) laid down the principles that it is the bounden duty of"
"the trial Judge to indulge in this process and that the same duty prevails even when the"
