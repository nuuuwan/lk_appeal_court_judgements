"Basnayake, CJ in The  Queen v. Vincent Fernando 65 NLR 265 held that,"
"A person who does a criminal act by himself is liable for that act if it offends any"
"provision of the penal law. The above section does not deal with the liability of a person"
"for the criminal act he himself does but with his liability for the criminal acts of others."
"What  are  the  prerequisites  of  such  liability?  Several  persons  must  have  a  common"
"intention  to  do  a criminal  act,  they  must  all  do  that  act  in  furtherance  of  the  common"
"intention of all. In such a case each person becomes liable for that act in the same manner"
"as if it were done by him alone. By virtue of the definition of "" act "" in section 31 of the"
"Penal Code, the application of the section also extends to a series of criminal acts done by"
"several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. There are more cases which"
"fall within the extended application than within the unextended. Now where a series of"
"criminal acts is done by several persons, each act would be done either jointly or severally."
"But whether the criminal acts in the series of criminal acts are done jointly or severally if"
"each criminal act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all each of the persons"
"sharing the common intention and doing any act in the series of criminal acts is not only"
"liable for his own act but is also liable for the acts of the others in the same manner as if"
"it were done by him alone. For instance, if a man is done to death by several blows struck"
"by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each person is liable not"
"only for the blow dealt by him but he is also liable for each of the blows dealt by the others"
"in the same manner as if all the blows were dealt by him alone, and where death results"
"from the blow of one of them and it appears that the common intention of all was to cause"
"death, each of those who did criminal acts in furtherance of the common intention of all"
"is liable for the at of the person whose blow resulted in the death of the deceased. It is not"
"necessary to prove who struck the fatal blow. A person who merely shares the criminal"
"intention,  or takes  a fiendish delight  in  what is  happening  but  does no criminal act  in"
"furtherance of the common intention of all is not liable for the acts of the others. To be"
"liable under section  32 a mental sharing  of  the  common  intention  is not sufficient, the"
"sharing must be evidenced by a criminal act. The Code does not make punishable a mental"
"state however wicked it may be unless it is accompanied by a criminal act which manifests"
"the state of mind. In the Penal Code words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal"
"omissions (s. 30). What has been stated above in regard to criminal acts therefore apply"
"to illegal omissions as well. (emphasis added)"
