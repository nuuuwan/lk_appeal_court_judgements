"Q: Are there possibilities for the said abrasion from 1-6 to occur while a person is kept"
"tied or while pulsing that person in that position with force."
"A
:  Yes.  Both  the  3rd  and  6th  external  injuries  had  similar  marks.  External  injuries"
"No,01,02,04,05  had  been  caused  by  using  a  weapon  with  a  rough  surface  or  with  a"
"weapon is used on the body."
"The above said medical evidence corroborates with the evidence of PW1’s version"
"that PW1 had seen the way the Accused assaulted the deceased with blunt weapons."
"Therefore, this court accepts PW1’s Evidence as reliable and truthful."
"T
he other point taken in by the Defence is whether the learned High Court Judge"
"has rightly evaluated the dock statement. In this regard, the relevant excerpt from the"
"judgement is reproduced below. (On page 449 – 451 of the translated Brief – Judgment"
"dated 03.05.2017);"
"The Dock Statement of the 1st accused corroborated most of the evidence of the"
"prosecution witnesses. This is a charge made of torture. It is important that the accused"
"had not mentioned anything about the charge in his dock statement."
"The  2nd  accused  in  his  dock  statement  had  denied  that  he  was  engaged  in"
"assaulting or threatening Sumanan and denied the torture charge. The dock statement of"
"the  2nd  accused  made  above  corroborated  most  of  the  evidence  of  the  Prosecution"
"witnesses."
"The Court rejects the claim of the accused that he did not engage in torturing."
"The  3rd  accused  and  the  8th  accused  had  given  dock  statements.  Their  dock"
"statements are that of credibility."
"The 4th, 5th, and the 6th accused having made the dock statement, had denied the"
"charges. Their dock statements are found to be unreliable. Therefore the Court rejects the"
"dock statement as unreliable."
