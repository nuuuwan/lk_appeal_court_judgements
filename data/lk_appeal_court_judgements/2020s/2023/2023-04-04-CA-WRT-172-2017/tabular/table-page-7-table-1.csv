"The Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Director general of"
"the Authority had the power to approve the decision contained in the document"
"marked P81. As the Petitioners did not possess the basic required qualifications"
"for the post on 01.01.2005 according to the SOR of 2005 which is applicable on"
"that day, the former Director General could not have backdated the promotions"
"of  the  Petitioners  to  take  effect  from  01.01.2005.  Such  a  decision  which"
"becomes ultra vires can create unnecessary complications in the administrative"
"setup of the Authority and the utilization of the public funds. The incumbent"
"Director General is not bound to follow the decision of his predecessor in office"
"which is wrong and ultra vires and if the incumbent Director General implements"
"the decision that act also becomes ultra vires."
"The legal right and the legitimate expectation of the Petitioners"
"Legitimate  expectation, 
in  general  terms,  was  based  on  the  principles  of"
"procedural fairness and was closely related to hearings in conjunctions with the"
"rules  of  natural 
justice.  D.J.  Galigan 
in  his  treatise 
‘Due  Process  and  Fair"
"Procedures. A study of Administrative Procedure 1996’ at page 320 observes as"
"follows;"
"“In one sense legitimate expectation is an extension of the idea of an interest."
"The duty to procedural fairness is owed, it has been said, when a person’s rights,"
"interests, or legitimate expectations are in issues.”"
"David Foulkes in Administrative Law, 8th edition, Butterworths 1995 at page 290"
"states  that  a  promise  or  an  undertaking  could  give  rise 
to  a 
legitimate"
"expectation.  He  states  thus,  “The  right  to  a  hearing,  or  to  be  consulted,  or"
"generally  to  put  one’s  case,  may  also  arise  out  of  the  action of  the  authority"
"itself. This action may take one or two, or both forms, a promise (or a statement"
"or undertaking) or a regular procedure. Both the promise and the procedure are"
"capable  of  giving  rise  to  what 
is  called  a 
legitimate  expectation,  that  an"
"expectation of the kind which the courts will enforce.”"
"H.W.R.  Wade  and  C.F.  Forsyth  in  their  text  book  on  Administrative  Law  (11th"
"edition) at pages 450 to 452 observe as follows,"
"“It 
is  not  enough  that  an  expectation  should  exist: 
it  must 
in  addition  be"
"legitimate. But how is it to be determined whether a particular expectation is"
"worthy  of  protection?  This  is  a  difficult  area  since  an  expectation  reasonably"
