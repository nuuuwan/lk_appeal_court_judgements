"Petitioners did not have the requisite minimum qualifications to be promoted"
"to that post."
"The  Petitioners 
in  their  count  of  affidavit  state  that  they  had  the  basic"
"qualifications for the post in terms of the SOR in 2005 when the applications"
"were called."
"The case of the Petitioners is that they had the minimum qualifications required"
"for the post in terms of the SOR of 2005 at the time when the applications were"
"called  and  the  Respondents  deny  that.  According  to  the  Respondents  the"
"Petitioners  did  not  have  the  required  minimum  qualifications  for  the  post  in"
"terms of the SOR of 2005 when the applications were called and the Petitioners"
"acquired the minimum required qualifications only after following the training"
"program organized by the RDA and awarding a certificate which is recognized by"
"the  Sri  Lanka 
Institute  of 
Information  Technology.  The  burden 
is  on  the"
"Petitioners to satisfy this court that they had the basic minimum requirements"
"to qualify for the post at the time the applications were called. If they fail to do"
"so, their case fails. When one compares the basic qualifications necessary for"
"the  post  as  specified  in  paragraph  11  of  the  petition  with  the  qualifications"
"disclosed  by  the  Petitioners  in  paragraphs  4,5,6  and  7  of  the  petition  and"
"specified in the certificates annexed there to, one cannot come to the conclusion"
"that the Petitioners had the basic required qualifications to apply to the post in"
"terms  of  the  SOR  of  2005,  at  the  time  the  applications  were  called.  In  the"
"document marked P81 which is heavily relied by the Petitioners and which is"
"their own document, the Deputy Director (Administration) had  observed that"
"the  Petitioners  were  promoted 
in  2010  although 
they  had  passed 
the"
"examination in 2008. As  per usual practice the promotions should have been"
"effected soon after the examination results were released. He has also referred"
"to the fact that the Petitioners underwent a 6 months training program prior to"
"their sitting for the exam. Those observations imply that the Petitioners did not"
"have  the  basic  qualifications  for  the  post  at  the  time  the  applications  were"
"called. Otherwise, there is no necessity for him who mention the fact that the"
"promotions should have been effected soon after the release of the examination"
"results.  That  shows  that  the  Petitioners  did  not  have  the  basic  qualifications"
"prior to the passing of that examination. The Petitioners in paragraph 19 of the"
"petition states that the following paragraph of the board paper No. 1043/2007"
