"112.2006 Thommeyahakuru Somasiri vs. Republic of Sri Lanka. decided on the11.02.08 held:"
"“In a criminal case it is difficult for the prosecution to find direct evidence to establish the"
"murderous intention. The murderous intention must be understood from the factors such as,"
"p
l
ace of injury, the weapon used, number of injuries, gravity of the injury and the force used"
"by the assailants”."
"In my view, to establish a murderous intention the authority held by His Lordship"

"evidence  with  regard  to  the  murderous  intention  of  the  Accused  In  such  a  case,  medical"
"evidence is very helpful to find out whether the Accused had a murderous intention to cause"
"the death of the Deceased. In line with the reasoning given in the above judicial authorities."
"If we apply the above dictum the injury caused on the neck of the Deceased and the"
"force  used  by  the  Accused  it  is  possible  to  establish  that  the  Accused  had  a  murderous"
"intention. In other words, the medical evidence establishes that the Accused had a murderous"
"intention to cause the death of the Deceased."
"Now  we  have  to  consider  whether  the  dock  statement  made  by  the  Accused  has"
"created  reasonable  doubt.  According  to  the  dock  statement,  the  Accused  stated  that  the"
"deceased had a knife and he had started the fight and his version not was put forward to any"
"witnesses."
