"n the case of C.Chenga Reddy and others v. State of A.P.(1996) 10 SCC"
"193 the court held that:"
"“In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is that the"
"circumstances  from  which  the  conclusion  of  guilt  is  drawn  should  be"
"fully  proved  and  such  circumstances  must  be  conclusive  in  nature."
"Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be"
"no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further the proved circumstances"
"must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused and"
"totally inconsistent with his innocence”."
