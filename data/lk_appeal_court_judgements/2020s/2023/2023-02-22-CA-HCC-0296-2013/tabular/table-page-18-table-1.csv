"scene, it was the appellant who has explained what happened to him. At that","",""

"He has given a similar explanation he gave to PW-08 as to what happened. He","",""

"Since such a weapon was not to be found at the scene, the Government Analyst","",""
"as he should have, has conducted several tests using similar types of weapons","",""
"to eliminate any doubt that one of the cartridges found may have been used in a","",""

"found near the scene of crime. The Government Analyst has well explained before","",""
"the trial Court the procedure he followed in that regard and the scientific theories","",""

"I am unable to find any merit in the argument that the learned High Court Judge","",""

"The learned High Court Judge has accepted his report as evidence only after well","",""
