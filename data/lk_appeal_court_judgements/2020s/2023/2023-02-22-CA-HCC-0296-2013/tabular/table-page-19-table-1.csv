"The Government Analyst has well explained the distances he has given as to the"
"distance  from  which  the  firing  at  the  deceased  had  taken  place.  He  has  well"
"explained  the  entry  point  found  on  the  mosquito  net  and  the  head  of  the"
"deceased and the exit wound. His opinion that the shot has been fired from a"
"very close-range, contrary to the claim made to him by the appellant that it was"
"fired from outside the room had been based on scientific findings which have not"
"been shaken at any point."
"In his evidence, the Government Analyst has well explained that he did not rely"
"on what the appellant said, but relied on his expert knowledge to come to his"
"findings, for which I find no reason to disagree with."
"Apart from the evidence of the Government Analyst, the Judicial Medical Officer"
"Dr. Alwis, who was one of the most experienced Judicial Medical Officers of the"
"country at that time, too, has given clear evidence to establish that the shot had"
"been fired at a close range which indicates that it has been fired from within the"
"room."
"I am in no position to agree with the contention that the learned trial Judge failed"
"to  consider,  matters  in  favour  of  the  appellant  as  the  matters  pointed  out  as"
"matters that favoured the appellant are not evidence that can be considered as"
"favourable  to  the  appellant,  or  else,  has  created  any  doubt  in  the  evidence"
"presented by the prosecution."
"As contended correctly by the learned SDSG, I am in agreement that this is a"
"clear-cut  case  where  the  dictum,  what  is  known  as  the  Ellenborough  dictum,"
"which in my view has now become a part of our law of evidence, should come"
"into play."
"The  said  Ellenborough  dictum  attributed  to  Lord  Ellenborough  in  Rex  Vs."
