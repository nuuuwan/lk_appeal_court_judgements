"curtain. The picture marked Y-6 ආ establishes that the 2nd cartridge found by"
"PW-08 was kept in a trophy that was among several other trophies."
"I  am  in  no  position  to  agree  with  the  contention  that  failure  by  Sirithilake  to"
"observe  a  second  cartridge  as  a  failure  in  proper  investigations  or  even  a"
"subsequent introduction. Sirithilake, in his evidence has stated that he had no"
"experience in conducting murder investigations or recording observations. This"
"had been his first visit to a scene where a murder has taken place. Under the"
"circumstances,  it  is  clear  that  Sub-Inspector  Sirithilake  was  not  the  officer"
"responsible for recording the observations, although he has made his notes in"
"that regard. It may not be possible for a person to observe a cartridge in a trophy"
"among several similar trophies under normal circumstances. Therefore, there is"
"nothing  improbable  in  PW-08  observing  the  2nd  cartridge  at  the  scene  of  the"
"crime when he was conducting his investigations."
"Any investigator with experience can come to a preliminary finding as to whether"
"a  person  is  telling  the  truth  or  otherwise  by  comparing  an  explanation  to  the"
"observations and the evidence available before him. When the appellant claimed"
"that an intruder came inside the house, fired at him, which hit his wife and fled,"
"any investigator would look whether there are signs that a person has forcibly"
"entered the house as claimed. The investigator had not found any signs of forced"
"entry or signs of someone going out of the house."
"As the appellant has claimed that the intruder fired from in front of his room"
"towards him who was inside of it, the investigator has to check whether when"
"such a firing was done, the possibility of it striking the head of the deceased who"
"was sleeping on the bed."
"I am in no position to agree with the learned President’s Counsel’s contention"
"that the PW-08 saying in his evidence that the appellant acted and showed him"
"how the incident occurred, would amount to showing that the investigator looked"
"at it as only a piece of acting, and did not believe it from the very outset with a"
"prejudiced mind."
