"incident  had  happened,  it  was  his  view  that  given  the  strong  circumstantial"
"evidence  against  the  appellant,  this  was  a  clear  case  where  the  Ellenborough"
"dictum shall become applicable."
"It was his view that even the last seen theory and the lucus principle shall also"
"become applicable in this matter."
"This 
is  a  case  where  the  accused  has  absconded  and 
failed  to  offer  any"
"explanation against the charge preferred against him. It was the position of the"
