"directed WPC 8041 Anusha (PW7) to search the woman as he observed something in her"
"right-side  pocket.  PW7  searched  the  pocket  and  found  a  pink  cellophane  bag  that"
"contained a brown powder. Upon inspection by PW1, this was suspected to be heroin."
"The  Accused  was  arrested  at  1450  and  the  cellophane  bag  was  put  inside  an"
"envelope  and  retained  by  PW1.  PW1  kept  the  envelope  in  his  possession  until  they"
"reached the station. On their way back, they stopped at Dedigama Pawn Center to weigh"
"the heroin. This was done by PW1 in the presence of PW2, PW7, and the Accused. When"
"weighed with the cellophane bag, it was recorded as 20g and 100mg. The cellophane bag"
"was then put back in the envelope and sealed. They then arrived at CCD, and PW1 made"
"an entry at 16.35. Thereafter, the Accused and the production were handed over to the"
"reserve police officer, and the production was entered into the PR book and sent to the"
"government analyst. PW1 in his evidence identifies this reserve police officer as, PS 27675"
