"When considering the manner the Accused was caught by the officers, PW1 claims"
"that she abruptly turned away upon seeing the officers and that conjured up his suspicion."
"As stated by PW1 (on page 119 of the Brief – proceedings dated 28/052019):"
"“
උ  -  අකේ  දිශාවට  එන්න  ආපු  ඒ  තැනැත්තිය  එක  පාරටම  ඇකේ  දකුණු  අත  පැත්තට  තිබුනු  ඒ  මහල්  නිවාස"
"සංකීර්ණය කදසට ගමන් කිරීම සම්බන්ධව මට සැක හිතුර්ා.”"
"Is  this  narration  probable?  We  must  take  note  of  the  fact  that  she  was  not"
"randomly stopped in the street and searched, but rather it was her ‘suspicious conduct’"
"observed  by  PW1  which  led  to  the  search.  In  relation  to  this  particular  point,  we  may"
"observe the events in Siddick v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [2005] 1 SLR 383, in which the"
"main witness (who was a customs officer) had searched the Accused on suspicion roused"
"by the fact that the accused was wearing ill-matching shoes. To reiterate the words of his"
"Lordship Imam J., “Nazeer in his evidence stated that what roused his suspicion was that"
"the Accused at the time of detection was attired in a dark blue suit and wore ill-matching"
"pair of brown shoes. …by virtue of his job was entrusted to question and check suspicious"
"looking persons, by virtue of which he arrested the Appellant.”"
"Further, on the matter of probability, the defense raises the question of whether it"
"was likely for the officers to not search the house of the Accused. According to PW1, such"
"an exercise would have been pointless as the news of the Accused being arrested would"
"have  quickly  spread.  As  stated  by  PW1  (on  page  128  of  Brief  –  proceedings  dated"
"28/05/2019):"
"“
උ  -  ඒක  වත්තක්.  ජනාකීර්ණ  ප්‍රකේශයක්.  මහල්  නිවාස  සංකීර්ණයක්  ඒක.  මිනිසේු  කගාඩක්  ගැවකසන"
"ප්‍රකේශයක්.  අන්තුරුව  සේවාමීනි  එතන  තියාකගන  ඇයව  පරික්ෂා  කරලා  සේවාමිනි  කම්  සම්බන්ධව  කචෝදනාව"
"කියවලා  දීලා  අතඩංගුවට  ගත්තට  විනාඩි  ගර්නාවක්  ගත  කවනවා.  ඒ  අවසේථාකේ  නිවස  පරික්ෂා  කරන එකක්"
"කිසිම කත්රුමක් නැහැ කියලා මකේ අවකබෝධකේ හැටියට මට කත්රුර්ා සේවාමීනි.”"
"At this point, we must also be mindful of the fact that they were only patrolling in"
"the Satthamma Watta as a part of their daily duty. It is because of this, the prosecution’s"
"version  of  the  fact  that  the  Accused  was  spotted  walking  towards  the  police  seems"
"probable.  Further,  given  that  it  is  a  notorious  area  for  drug  activity,  it  is  reasonably"
