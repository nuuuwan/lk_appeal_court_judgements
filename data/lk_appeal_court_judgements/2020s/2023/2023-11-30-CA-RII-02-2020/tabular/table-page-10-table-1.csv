"No one contend, that, the procedure followed in this case from the institution of"
"the plaint, up to the entering of the judgment and the  interlocutory decree on"
"24th February 1997 was wrong. Since there was no wrong, there was no accrual"
"of a right to a remedy. The only exception to this was the medical certificate of"
"the 04th defendant because it was permitted under section 48(4)(a)(iv).  It does"
"not seem to this Court because of the fact that the 04th  defendant having not"
"tendered a list of documents and witnesses and having tendered his purported"
"medical certificate of malaria after a lapse of eight months from the trial, that,"
"his application was genuine. But it is too late in the day to argue so, because,"
"even  a  partition  action  is  still  civil  litigation  and  evidence  could  be  adduced"
"without being verified for their truth and veracity on admissions. That was how"
"the  medical  certificate  was  admitted.  But,  the  “wrong”  established  by  that"
"admission of the medical certificate is limited, limited under section 48(4)(d) by"
"the words, “the pleadings and any further pleadings  which are relevant to"
"the claim set up in the petition only,”, which  does not allow the filing of a"
"statement of claims by the 05th defendant."
"The 04th defendant did not plead any deed in his petition dated 03.11.1997 (at"
"page 177 of the original case record). But the 04th  defendant in his purported"
"statement of claims dated 06.03.2000 had purported to plead several deeds, No."
"1924  dated  06.11.1924,  No.  16933  dated  23.06.1909,  No.  1126  dated"
"06.11.1933 and No. 2026 dated 06.01.1994. He further said that although he"
"had  pleaded  deed  No.  2018  the  vendors  therein,  the  aforesaid  K.  A.  Dona"
"Rupawathie and M. A. Percy Perera do not have title. Hence the 04th defendant"
"purported to set up an entirely new pedigree that he never pleaded in his petition,"
"which he cannot do under the section."
"Thereafter a 09th defendant too has filed an Amended Statement of Claims dated"
"25th September 2002."
