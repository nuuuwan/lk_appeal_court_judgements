"natural  justice  which  makes  it  incumbent  on  this  Court,  despite"
"technical objections to the contrary, to do justice. """
"Ranasinghe J., referring to the judgment of Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950)"
"52 NLR 409, while being on the minority will not diminish its value.  It shows"
"how the then Supreme Court, exercised the power of restitutio in integrum, even"
"against a judgment of its own. Today, such a power is vested, hence, not only"
"under  Article  138  of  the  Constitution,  but  also  on  the  hierarchical"
"arrangement of courts and in the mode of exercise of the powers of Courts,"
"referred to by the learned Chief Justice, in relation to Article 169(2) in the"
"present Court of Appeal."
