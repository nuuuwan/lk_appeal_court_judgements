"On perusal of the provisions of the Section 10(1) of the Customs Ordinance and also the"
"provisions added thereto by the said Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013, it implies that the"
"power of the Customs officials to levy duties has not been undermined by Sections 10(1A)"
"to 10(1C). The said Sections 10(1A) to 10(1C) only provide a mechanism to deal with a"
"situation where there is a dispute relating to the imposition or exemption of customs duty"
"as mentioned above. The said Regulation 2(v) which is a subordinate legislation stipulated"
"in the said Gazette has not been amended by way of a further regulation or by the said"
"Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013 or by any other written law."
"It is necessary to bear in mind that the Regulations in the Gazette have been promulgated"
"not under the provisions of the Customs Ordinance but under the BOI Law. Similarly, the"
"Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013 is in respect of the Customs Ordinance. I am mindful of"
"the  fact  that  the  regulatory  clause  promulgated  by  the  relevant  minister  freezes  the"
"statutory clause enacted by Parliament to limit the operation of the provisions of the said"
"Section  10.  Perhaps,  the  relevant  minister  when  promulgating  those  Regulations  has"
"referred only to the original Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance. However, neither the"
"Parliament  nor  the  relevant  minister  referred  to  in  the  BOI  Law,  has  given  thought  to"
"amend those Regulations in the Gazette, when enacting the said Amendment Act No. 9"
"of 2013.  Hence, I have no option other than rejecting the proposition of the Respondents"
"that  the  application  of  Sections  10(1A)  to  10(1C)  of  the  Customs  Ordinance  has  an"
"impediment for the operation of the said Regulation 2(v) of the Gazette."
"‘Duty’ under Customs Ordinance vis-à-vis CESS"
"Now, I advert to examine whether CESS described in Sri Lanka Export Development Act"
"No. 40 of 1979 ('SLED Act') should be taken into consideration as a tax or a duty distinct"
"to ‘duty’ referred to in Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance when Regulation 2(v) of the"
"said Gazette becomes operative. This is imperative since the Respondents allege that the"
"goods imported by the Petitioner under CUSDEC No. 12970 contained items upon which"
"the CESS should be imposed."
"In terms of Section 14(1) of the said SLED Act ‘there shall be charged, levied and paid a"
"cess  at  such  rates  as  may  be  determined  by  the  Minister  from  time  to  time,  with  the"
"concurrence of the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance, by Order published in the"
"Gazette, on such imports and exports specified in the Order’. The Petitioner has submitted"
