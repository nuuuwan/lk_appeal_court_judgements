"Giving due consideration to both above judgements and in light of my above findings, I"
"take the view that an investor who imports goods under a BOI agreement would be liable"
"to pay CESS for any goods imported unless such goods are exempted from CESS by an"
"order of the relevant minister or it is expressly excluded in the BOI agreement with prior"
"approval. The CESS is a levy distinct to the Customs duties referred to in Section 10 of the"
"Customs Ordinance and further, the CESS is levied under a separate written law (SLED"
"Act) which is not excluded in terms of Section 17 of the Customs Ordinance. In such a"
"backdrop, an appropriate branch of the Government must have the authority to inquire"
"into  related  goods  which  are  imported  against  the  terms  of  such  BOI  agreements.  The"
"Agreements entered into with BOI in the instant case do not illustrate any such exclusion"
"or exemption of CESS in favour of the Petitioner."
"It is apparent that none of the Agreements entered into between the Petitioner and the BOI"
"exempt the Petitioner from paying CESS and it is the duty of the Petitioner to obtain prior"
"approval, if necessary, from relevant authorities in that regard."
"Anyhow, the final question which arises here is whether Sri Lanka Customs has authority"
"to revisit the classification prescribed by the BOI.  As per the decision of Dr. Shirani A."
"Bandaranayake  CJ.  in  the  above  Ceylon  Quartz  Industries  (Private)  Limited  case,  any"
"Governmental authority to examine the correctness of any declaration is subjected to the"
"condition that such authority should be exercised in the manner as directed by none other"
"than the BOI. It can be assumed on the strength of the above two judgements in Ceylon"
"Quartz  Industries  (Private)  Limited  and  Onril  (Pvt.)  Limited  cases  that  the  Sri  Lanka"
"Customs should have the power to use their authority under the Customs Ordinance when"
"an investor (who enters into an agreement with BOI) imports any goods different to the"
"prescribed specification or  such investor engage in unlawful importation in violation of"
"the respective BOI agreements."
"Most importantly it is observed that the issue on CESS is not involved in both the above"
"two judgements. The contention of the Petitioner is that the BOI has repeatedly informed"
"the Sri Lanka Customs that the consignment of goods in terms of CUSDEC No. 12970"
"were part and parcel of the essentials of the particular Cleanroom."
