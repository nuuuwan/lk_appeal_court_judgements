"give a negative effect to the substance of the said Section 10 and its proviso. The mandate"
"of  Regulation  2(v)  is  only  to  spell  out  that  the  Section  10  shall  not  apply  to  the  goods"
"mentioned  in  the  said  Regulation  and  it  is  a  provision  applicable  only  for  specific"
"agreements  signed  with  the  BOI  under  the  BOI  Law.  The  Section  10  of  the  Customs"
"Ordinance is not a subordinate legislation and the intention of the legislature embodied in"
"Section  10,  cannot  be  completely  changed  or  discarded  by  misinterpreting  the  said"
"Regulation 2(v). Thus, non applicability of Section 10 will not affect the due operation of"
"Section 14(1) of the SLED Act. In other words, CESS can be levied even on an occasion"
"when Section 10 of the Ordinance is not applicable in respect of agreements under Section"
"17 of the BOI Law and moreover, the CESS should be identified as a tax distinct from"
"customs duties spelt out in the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance."
"This position is further elaborated by the provisions of Section 14(6) of the said SLED Act"
"which stipulates that the CESS imposed under the said Section shall be in addition to any"
"import duty or export duty or any other CESS levied under any other written law. Such"
"independent identity of CESS will not be affected even with the provisions of Section 14(4)"
"of the same Act."
