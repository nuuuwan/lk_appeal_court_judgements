"commenced  in  the  year  2018  and  accordingly,  the  Petitioner  has  obtained  approval  to"
"import  related  plants  and  machinery  on  duty  free  basis.  The  syrup,  tablet  and  capsule"
"manufacturing plants were also included in the said project. Setting up of an EU GMP1"
"Cleanroom Compliant facility was supposed to be a part of the said manufacturing plant."
"The  Petitioner  asserts  that  the  BOI  has  granted  approval  to  import  equipment  for  a"
"complete Cleanroom under HS Code 8479.89.90 for which CESS is not applicable and"
"the respective consignment contained only the equipment essentials for the Cleanroom."
"The allegation against the Petitioner was that the Petitioner had failed to declare 14 plastic"
"containers  which  do  not  fall  within  the  above  HS  Code.  Anyhow,  the  Petitioner’s"
"contention is that such items are storage devices to be kept in the stainless-steel cupboard"
"and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents manifestly violating the agreements between the BOI"
"and  the  Petitioner  have  decided  that  the  said  consignment  was  subjected  to  CESS."
"Referring  to  the  letters,  marked  'P23'  to  'P25',  the  Petitioner  states  that  the  BOI  has"
"informed Sri Lanka Customs that the contents of the subject consignment imported under"
"CUSDEC No. 12970  were part of the machinery of the manufacturing plant and it’s under"
"the classification of HS Code 8479.89.90."
"The basic question which needs resolution in the instant Application is whether it is lawful"
"for Sri Lanka Customs to inquire into the classification of the subject goods imported by"
"the Petitioner when such goods have been already classified as HS Code 8479.89.90 by"
"the  BOI.  Similarly,  it  needs  consideration  whether  Sri  Lanka  Customs  could  exercise"
"powers under Customs Ordinance in order to classify imported goods when such goods"
"have been imported in terms of an agreement with the BOI under Section 17 of the BOI"
"Law."
"Regulations under BOI Law"
"The  Greater  Colombo  Economic  Commission  Regulations  No.  1  of  1978  have  been"
"published  in  Gazette  Extraordinary  No.  8/2  on  31.10.1978  ('Gazette').  The  Regulation"
"2(v) of the said Gazette implies that the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance shall not"
"apply  to  any  goods,  wares  and  merchandise  imported  into  Sri  Lanka  by  virtue  of  an"
"agreement entered into between an enterprise and BOI under Section 17 of the BOI Law."
