"In this scenario, the Petitioner by letters dated 23-12-2019 and 07-03-2020 marked as"
"P20 and P21 requested the 2nd Respondent to restore the Development Permit marked"
"P11, whereas the 2nd Respondent failed to respond to those letters."
"In  these  respects, the  Petitioner  asserts that  he  has  a  proprietary  right  and  legitimate"
"expectation to develop his land as per the Development Permit marked P11, and without"
"any reasonable and justifiable grounds the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have prevented"
"the  Petitioner  from  developing  his  land  by  temporarily  canceling  the  Development"
"Permit  marked P11, which  is  illegal, unlawful and  ultra-vires. The Petitioner  further"
"asserts that the refusal to restore the said Permit by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents is"
"unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal and tainted by malice."
"Alex Carroll, Constitutional and Administrative Law, (9th edn, Pearson 2017) p 322."
"“A  government  official  who  causes  injury  through  a  deliberate  misuse  of  power"
"commits the tort of misfeasance in public office. Some conscious or malicious element"
"of abuse must be present. Also, the perpetrator must have intended to inflict injury or"
"have been aware that it would be the likely consequence of their actions. In Three Rivers"
"District Council v Bank of England (No. 3) [1996] 3 All ER 558, the tort was said to be"
"committed where a public officer:"
"(a) performed or omitted to perform an act with the object of injuring the plaintiff (i.e."
"where there was targeted malice);"
"(b) performed an act which he knew or ought to have known he had no power to perform"
"and which he knew would or could injure the plaintiff.”"
"In those circumstances, the Petitioner is seeking a mandate in the nature of a Writ of"
"Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondents contained"
"in  the  letter  dated  12-06-2018  marked  P14  to  temporarily  cancel  the  Development"
"Permit dated 12-02-2018 marked P11 and a Mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus"
"directing the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondents to restore the said Development"
