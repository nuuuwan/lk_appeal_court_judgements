"the  discovery  of  the  offence  or,  where  that  person  has  been  absent  from  Sri  Lanka"
"during such period, within one year after his return to Sri Lanka.’"
"As per the Charge Sheet ‘P3(a)’, the alleged offences have been committed by the Petitioner"
"during the period between 30.08.2017 to 04.07.2018. The records of Summary of Evidence"
"have been submitted on 13.05.2019 along with the circumstantial letter, charge sheet, list of"
"documents  and  list  of  witnesses  by  the  Naval  Officer  In-Charge  (‘NOIC’)  of  Hambantota."
"The records of Additional Summary of Evidence (‘P3(b)’) in respect of the alleged misconduct"
"of the Petitioner have been submitted on 15.11.2019. The same NOIC of Hambantota by his"
"letter dated 14.11.2019 addressed to the 1st Respondent has expressed his opinion that there"
"was  enough  evidence  to  substantiate  a  prima  facie  case  against  the  Petitioner  as  per  the"
"amended Charge Sheet. As a consequence, a Court Martial has been convened on 28.12.2020."
"In terms of the said Section 26, the trial against a person subject to Naval law should take"
"place within a period of 3 years from the date of the discovery of the offence or where that"
"person has been absent from Sri Lanka during such period, within one year after his return to"
"Sri Lanka. It is apparent that the proceedings against the Petitioner should commence afresh"
"before  the  fresh  Court  Martial  that  will  be  convened  as  a  consequence  to  the  undertaking"
"extended by the 1st Respondent during the proceedings of the instant Application."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner as well as the learned Additional Solicitor"
"General who appears for the Respondents agreed to confine the arguments of this Application"
"only to the question whether the Petitioner would be able to make a claim under Section 26"
"of the Navy Act when the Commander of Navy convenes a fresh Court Martial as already"
"agreed. As both learned Counsel have invited this Court to confine the examination only to"
"the  above  question,  the  Petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  take  a  stand  that  this  Court  has  no"
"jurisdiction to inquire and determine the time bar issue pertaining to the said Section 26 as"
"claimed in the written submissions of the Petitioner. Hence, what needs consideration of this"
"Court  is  whether  the  Petitioner  is  entitled  to  take  refuge  under  the  provisions  of  the  said"
