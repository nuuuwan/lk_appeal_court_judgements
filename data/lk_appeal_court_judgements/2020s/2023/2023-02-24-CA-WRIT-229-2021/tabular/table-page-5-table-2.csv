"Bonser C.J. in Sidoris Silva vs. Palaniappa Chetty 5 NLR 289 has identified judicial acts and"
"ministerial acts during the judicial process. In the said case, the Court has held;"
"“It appears that this case came on originally before Mr. Mason, who was then District Judge,"
"and he tried one of the issues first, viz., the issue as to the title to the garden, and the result of this"
"trial,  in  the  opinion  of  Mr.  Mason,  was  that  the  plaintiff  had  made  out  his  case,  and  he"
"accordingly gave judgment in his favour, and adjourned the hearing of the other issues to another"
"day.  Before  that  day  arrived  he  ceased  to  be  District  Judge,  and  was  succeeded  by  Mr."
"Roosmalecocq. Mr. Roosmalecocq found that the plaintiff was clearly entitled to the house, but"
"declined to enter up a decree in accordance with his predecessor's judgment as to the garden, on"
"the ground that "" if Mr. Mason failed "" to have a decree entered according to the judgment, he"
"alone was "" responsible."""
"It  seems  to  me  that  he  took  an  erroneous  view  of  his  duty.  The  drawing  up  of  a  decree  is  a"
"ministerial act, not a judicial act. It is merely stating in legal  language the judgment already"
"delivered, and that that judgment was delivered by his predecessor makes no difference. The decree"
"can be drawn up by any person who for the time being was holding the office of District Judge.”"
