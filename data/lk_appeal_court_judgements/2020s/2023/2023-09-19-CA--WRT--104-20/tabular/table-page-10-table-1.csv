"Argument - I"
"The Debt Conciliation Board has the jurisdiction to ascertain whether in"
"fact the Transfer Deed is an Outright Transfer or a Mortgage."
"T
he learned counsel for the 10th respondent pointed out that according to"
"paragraph 13 of the petition, the 1st  to 4th respondents have considered"
"the acknowledgement of the Deed bearing No. 4142 as a technical error,"
"acted abusing their powers, and refused to dismiss the application of the"
"10th respondent on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.  However, the learned"
"counsel  contended  further  that  even  if  the  Deed  bearing  No.4142  is"
"assumed to be a duly executed transfer deed, according to Section 21A of"
"the  Debt  Conciliation  Ordinance,  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board  has  the"
"jurisdiction to ascertain whether the transfer deed is in fact an outright"
"transfer or a mortgage. Therefore, he submitted that even under the said"
"circumstances, the Board has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this"
"matter."
"T
he  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was  that  the"
"property subject to this application had been transferred to the petitioner"
"by the 10th respondent after the institution of the instant application and"
"thus the Debt Conciliation Board has no jurisdiction to hear this matter."
"The learned Counsel submitted further that according to the proceedings"
"dated 23.11.2018, the 10th respondent firmly acknowledged the execution"
"of the Deed bearing No. 4142 and he has not taken a single step to rectify"
"the said acknowledgement if it is wrongly recorded. In the circumstances,"
"the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended  that  it  is  erroneous  to"
"hold by the Board on 05.09.2019 that it is a technical error made on the"
"part of the proceedings."
