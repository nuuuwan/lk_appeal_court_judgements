"Argument - VI"
"The  petitioner  cannot  maintain  this  application  because  of  the  undue"
"delay."
"T
he instant application has filed nearly nine months after the impugned"
"order  dated  05.09.2019.  So,  there  is  a  delay  in  filing  the  application."
"Stating his illness and inability to get ready with the application due to the"
"Covid -19 pandemic situation, the petitioner urged to consider the delay"
"as an excusable delay."
"T
he learned counsel for the 10th respondent contended that the petitioner,"
"not the learned counsel, has intentionally misled this Court in explaining"
"his medical condition in order to justify the delay."
"As it is not a very long delay and the issue pertaining to this application is"
"a legal issue with regard to the jurisdiction of the Debt Conciliation Board,"
"I decide to consider the merits of this application without dismissing it on"
"the ground of delay in making the application."
"A
rgument - IV"
"If a writ of certiorari is issued quashing the impugned order, steps taken"
"in terms of Section 29 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance becomes futile."
"I
t is my view that whatever steps that were taken by the Board, if they were"
"taken without jurisdiction, those steps could not be allowed to stand. This"
"is not a situation where the issuance of the writ becomes futile. Therefore,"
"the aforesaid futility is not a reason to consider in issuing or not issuing"
"the writ of certiorari prayed for in the petition."
