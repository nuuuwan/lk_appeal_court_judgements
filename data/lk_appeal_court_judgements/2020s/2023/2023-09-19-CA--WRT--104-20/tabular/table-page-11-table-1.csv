"I  am  of  the  view  that  when  the  10th  respondent  states  that  he  has  no"
"connection to the Transfer Deed bearing No. 4142, there is no purpose in"
"ascertaining whether the deed had been executed as an outright transfer"
"or mortgage. According to the position taken up by the 10th respondent,"
"first, it should be decided whether, in fact, the 10th respondent transferred"
"the property by executing Deed bearing No. 4142 or whether the said deed"
"is not an act of the 10th respondent. However, it is to be noted that this"
"issue must be decided by a Court with competent jurisdiction to determine"
"that issue and not by the Debt Conciliation Board."
