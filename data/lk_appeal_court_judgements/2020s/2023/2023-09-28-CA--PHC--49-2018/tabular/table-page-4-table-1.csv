"It appears that the said information was based on a police complaint made by Don Prabhath"
"Samaru Jayasinghe. According to the said complaint he had come to lawful possession of the"
"disputed premises as a lessee under a valid lease executed on 21.09.2017 with the 1st party"
"Respondent namely Hasha Shiromani Ralapanawa."
"The said lessee has been paying rent for the disputed premises until the 2nd party Respondent"
"arrived  at  the  premises  on  21.12.2017  and  claimed  that  he  had  lawful  ownership  of  the"
"disputed premises."
"Apparently, the said Don Prabhath Samaru Jayasinghe [Lessee] had voluntarily vacated the"
"premises  and  handed  over  the  keys  to  the  2nd Party  Respondent  with  the  assistance  of  the"
"Petitioner."
"The said lessee had handed over the premises in dispute to the 2nd party Respondent since he"
"had claimed legal ownership to the property."
"As such, the 2nd party Respondent contended that there is no forcible dispossession, or any"
"breach of peace threatened to exercise jurisdiction in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Court"
"Procedure Act."
"It is a settled law that when the Police filed information in terms of Section 66(1)(a) of the"
"Primary Court Procedure Act, unlike in Section 66(1)(b), the learned Magistrate would treat"
"such a situation as having arisen from a threatened breach of the peace."
"It was held in the case of Velupillai and Others Vs. Sivanathan [1993(1) S.L.R 123] under"
"Section  66(1)(a)  of  the  Primary  Courts  Procedure  Act,  the  formation  of  the  opinion  as  to"
"whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely is left to the Police."
"The Police officer is empowered to file an information if there is a dispute affecting land and"
"a breach of the peace is threatened or is likely to be threatened. The Magistrate need not carry"
"out an inquiry as to whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely to be threatened in"
"such a situation and hence, such an inquiry is left with the Police."
"Therefore, the 2nd party Respondent is precluded by taking up the position that there was no"
"breach  of  the  peace  threatened  or  likely  to  be  threatened  between  the  parties  to  exercise"
"jurisdiction  under  Section  66  of  the  Primary  Court  Procedure  Act.  Thus,  the  objection  in"
"respect of the maintainability of the instant action, when there is no breach of the peace, is"
"unsustainable in law. Hence, the said objection stands dismissed."
