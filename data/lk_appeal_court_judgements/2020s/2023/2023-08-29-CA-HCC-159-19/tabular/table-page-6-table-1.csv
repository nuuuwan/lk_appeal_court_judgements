"PW15, P.S. 17037 Wijeratna, stated that he received the production from PW12"
"on December 24, 2013. He then handed over the production to the Government Analyst"
"and received receipt no. CB. 6144/13."
"According  to  PW16  Wajira  Jayasekara,  the  Government  Analyst,  PW15  had"
"transferred the production to the Government Analyst department."
"Upon evaluating the evidence presented to the Learned Trial Judge, we find that"
"he  correctly  analyzed  the  evidence  concerning  the  chain  of  production.  Further,  we"
"conclude that the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no"
"opportunity for tampering with the production until it reached the Government Analyst."
"Therefore, we hold that no doubt has been cast on this basis."
"We affirm that the prosecution has proven the charge against the Accused beyond"
"a reasonable doubt.  The  evidence  presented  in  court  was consistent with  regard  to  the"
"charge,  and  the  Accused's  evidence  did  not  cast  any  doubt  against  the  prosecution's"
"version. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction, and this appeal is dismissed"
