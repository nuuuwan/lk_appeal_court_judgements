"command  by  the  court  ordering  the  performance  of  a  public  legal  duty.18  Mandamus  is  a"
"command issued by a court to an authority directing it to perform a public duty belonging to"

"when  (a)  a  legal  duty  is  imposed  on  the  authority  in  question  and  it does  not  perform  the"
"same; and (b) the petitioner has a legal right to compel performance of this duty.19"
"It is observed that in order to issue a writ of Mandamus, the court must be satisfied of the"
"existence  of  a  public  duty  owed  and  an  existing  legal  right  in  the  petitioner  to  have  it"
"performed. Therefore, it will not be available conditionally or for the performance of merely"
"moral duties. The court must take cognisance of the distinction of a duty and a privilege or"
"discretion as a Mandamus exists only where a duty lies. A duty and privilege found in a statue"
"may be distinguished to a large extent by examining the language of the statute."
