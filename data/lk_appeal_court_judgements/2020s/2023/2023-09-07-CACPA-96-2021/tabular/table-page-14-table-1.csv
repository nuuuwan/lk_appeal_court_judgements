"The term ‘bulk sale’ is defined in section 61 of the Act to mean,"
"“bulk sales” in relation to the sale of electricity means the sale of electricity in bulk by"

"As such, it seems that the present endeavour by the Petitioner includes bulk sale of electricity"
"[schedule  I  of  A11(a)]  and  the  Petitioners  are  governed  by  bulk supply transmission"
"guidelines formulated by the PUCSL [A11(b)]."
"Therefore, the relevant sections given and items in schedules I, II and III mutatis mutandis"
"applies  to  transmission  licensees  (including  the  Petitioner)  as  they  apply  to  supply  of"
"electricity by a distribution licensee."
"The term mutatis mutandis is defined in the Blacks’ Law dictionary as, “all necessary changes"
"having been made; with necessary changes in points of detail” in essence, with the necessary"
"changes having been made or with consideration of the respective differences, similar terms"
"apply with relevant changes being made in respect of the differences."
"Therefore, this Court will now consider whether item 9 Schedule II is such a provision that"
"should apply to transmission licensees with necessary changes being made. Necessary change"
"in  this  case,  would  be  to  allow  the  transmission  licensee  the  same  right  to  invoke  the"
"jurisdiction of the Magistrate in an Application for forced entry."
"As I have reiterated above, item 7 and 8 clearly provides transmission license holder the same"
"right to entry as a distribution license holder, however, due to an omission in item 9, same"
"legal redress is not permitted for a transmission license holder if item 9 is interpreted as a"
"standalone provision. This would defeat purpose of item 7 and 8 of Schedule II as well as the"
"ability of the transmission license holders to exercise their rights."
