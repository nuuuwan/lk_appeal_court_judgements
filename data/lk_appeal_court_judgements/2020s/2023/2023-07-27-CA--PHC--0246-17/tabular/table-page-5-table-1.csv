"It  is  also  abundantly  clear  that  the  appellant  had  no  basis  to  challenge  the"
"judgment  when  he  filed  the  application  in  revision  before  the  Provincial  High"
"Court. The learned High Court Judge has well considered the factual and legal"
"provisions in that regard, and had correctly dismissed the application."
"Accordingly,  I  find  no  reasons  to  interfere  with  the  judgment  of  the  learned"
"Magistrate of Samanthurai as well as the judgment of the learned High Court"
"Judge of the Provincial High Court of Eastern Province holden at Kalmunai."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  appellant  has  filed  this appeal  before  this"
"Court, not for anything else, but to cause the maximum possible harassment to"
"the respondent, knowing very well the strength of his appeal."
"The appeal is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High"
"Court of Kalmunai and the Magistrate Court of Sammanthurai for information."
