"from the 3rd respondent considering the evidence available in the said case of Ranjith Keerthi"
"Tennakoon. This court held:"
"""Moreover, we observe that the Petition of the petitioner does not divulge any abuse of"
"process or malafides, unreasonableness, excess of jurisdiction on the part of the 1st or"

"Wade on Administrative Law – 11th Edition at Page 259 is as follows;"
"“An  element  which  is  essential  to  the  lawful  exercise  of  power  is  that  it  should  be"

"is  strictly  applied,  even  where  it  causes  administrative  inconvenience,  except  in  cases"
"where  it  may  reasonably  be  inferred  that  the  power  was  intended  to  be  delegable."
"Normally  the  Courts  are  rigorous  in  requiring  the  power  to  be  exercise  by the  precise"
"person or body stated in the statute….”"
