"However,  the  compliance  to  CA  Rules 
is  of 
imperative 
importance 
for  the"
"sustenance  of  the  application.  There  is  a  plethora  of  authorities  decided  by"
"superior courts on the matter of adherence to CA rules. In R. A. Ranasinghe v"
"A.  G.  CA/PHC/185/2011  CA  Minute  dated  05.08.2015,  the  matter  of  non-"
"compliance of the rules was discussed with a line of authorities to hold that “."
"Non-compliance with the Rules is fatal to the application. Parties who invoke the"
"jurisdiction of the Court cannot ignore the Rules and then ask to be heard. It is to"
"the  best  interest  of  the  administration  of  Justice  that  Judges  shall  not  ignore  or"
"deviate  from  the  procedural  law  and  decide  matters  on  equity  and  justice  Dr."

"Others  (1997)  3  SLR  12  -  there  is  the  substantive  law  and  the  procedural  law."

"rationale behind such mandatory compliance is the interest of justice, the parties"
"to an application shall first and foremost respect such procedural law to maintain"
"order and justice duly."
"Furthermore, in the case of Koralage vs. Marikkar Mohamed and others (1988)"
"2 SLR 299, it was held, “compliance of the Rules is a mandatory requirement and"
"non-compliance  is  a  material  defect  in  the  application  and  cannot  maintain  the"
