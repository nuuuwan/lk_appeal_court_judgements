"exhaustively stated, it must be decided whether, in addition to physical control, he has or"
"ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess or knowledge that he does possess,"
"what is in fact a prohibited substance. The above reasoning in my view is a rational"

"which have been held to be relevant to conclude whether a person has acquired possession"
"for the purposes of a particular rule of law. Some of the factors enlisted by him are; (a)"
"degree of physical control exercised by person over a thing, (b) knowledge of the person"
