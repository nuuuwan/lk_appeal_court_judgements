"And we are mindful that such a large quantity of Heroin should be considered for"
"the purpose of trafficking."
"The presence of the Accused in the said room under the circumstances sufficient"
"to establish beyond reasonable doubt that they were possessing and trafficking Heroin."
"The parcel was found in the commonplace."
"However, in the dock statement, all the Accused offered no explanation whatsoever"
"for their involvement in the crime."
"Upon  examination  of  the  dock  statement  provided  by  the  Accused,  it  becomes"
"patently  and  manifestly  clear  that  they  have  failed  to  create  doubt  regarding  their"
"connection to this crime. In other words, court expects that when incriminating evidence"
"is adduced against the Accused, the Accused to give a reasonable explanation to the court."
"if he fails the court would presume that there was no such explanation available to him."
