"grantee, as required under Section 68 of the LDO. Furthermore, the Petitioner"
"has expressly refused to succeed by the affidavit (‘1 R 4’) dated 21st February"
"2016, submitted to the 1st  Respondent (‘1 R 4’).  It was also stated that the"
"Petitioner  reaffirmed  the  above  position  in  the  statement  made  on  the  2nd"
"October 2016 at the inquiry conducted by the 1st Respondent (‘1 R 6’)."
"The Respondents contended that the Petitioner suppressed the aforementioned"
"affidavit and the statement made at the inquiry. Accordingly, it was submitted"
"that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression of material facts and on the said"
"ground alone the Petition should stand dismissed."
"According to the Respondents,  since the Petitioner failed and/or refused to"
"succeed in terms of Section 68 (2) of the LDO, the right to succeed should be"
"in accordance with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule, read along with Section 72"
"of the LDO. As a result, the 4th Respondent being the eldest male child should"
"succeed."
"Accordingly, the Respondents submitted that they have acted lawfully, and the"
"decision to certify the devolution in the name of the 4th Respondent is valid in"
"law."
"Analysis"
"Firstly, I will consider the aforementioned two preliminary objections raised"
"by the Respondents."
"As I have already stated above, the Respondents contended that a Grant issued"
"by His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka in terms of Section 19 (4) of the"
"LDO cannot be challenged in a Court of law, in terms of Article 35 (1) of the"
"Constitution."
"According to Section 19 (4) of the LDO,10 a permit holder shall be issued a"
"Grant in respect of the land of which he is in occupation if such permit holder"
"has fulfilled the conditions stipulated in the Section. The authority to make"
"decisions under the Section is granted to the Government Agent and to the"
"Land Commissioner. However, the Grants are issued under the hand of His"
"Excellency the President. There is no requirement in the LDO that a Grant"
"should be issued under the hand of the President. Be that as it may, Section 22"
