"Yet, for completeness, I will consider the merits of the Petitioner's application"
"as well."
"The Respondents argued that although the Grant ‘1 R 2’ was signed by the"
"President on the 10th October 1996, it was registered only in 2006, after the"
"death of Ukkuralage Gunasekara. It is true that Grants should be registered in"
"terms of Section 29 of the LDO. However, there is no provision in the LDO"
"to  the  effect  that  a  Grant  is  invalid  unless  it  is  registered.  In  contrast,  a"
"nomination or cancellation of a nomination of a successor under the LDO is"
"invalid  unless  it  is  registered21.    Therefore,  in  my  view,  the  Grant  ‘1  R  2’"
"should  be  valid  in  law  from  the  date  of  issue.  The  registration  is  only  a"
"formality."
"The Respondent submitted circular No. 2020/2 concerning Grants issued by"
"the Commissioner General of Lands under the LDO. According to Clause (2)"
"of the same when the grantee dies after His Excellency the President places"
"his  signature  to  the  Grant,  the  Grant  has  to  be  considered  as  valid  and  the"
"spouse or the next of kin should succeed to the land."
"However, when there is a nomination made, the nominee should succeed. As"
"it was held in the case of Piyasena v. Wijesinghe and others22 the nomination"
"of a successor under the permit becomes converted to a nomination under the"
"Grant  when  a  Grant  is  issued  to  a  permit  holder. Therefore,  even  after  the"
"issuance of the Grant ‘1 R 2’, the nomination made in the permit ‘P 1’/ ‘1 R1’."
"by Ukkuralage Gunasekara should continue."
"There  was  no  material  before 
the  Court  as 
to  whether 
the  spouse  of"
"Ukkuralage  Gunasekara  was 
living  or  not  at 
the 
time  of  his  death."
"Furthermore, it was not an issue before  the Court as to whether his spouse"
"failed to succeed to the land. Therefore, this Court need not labour on those"
"matters.  The  only  issues  before  the  Court  are  whether  the  Petitioner,  the"
"nominated successor,  failed or refused to succeed within six months  of  the"
"death of Ukkuralage Gunasekara23 and/or whether the Petitioner entered into"
"possession of the land within the said period."
