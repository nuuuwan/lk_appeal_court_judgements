"‘35 (1) While any person holds office as President, no proceedings"
"shall be instituted or continued against him in any court or tribunal"
"in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him either in"
"his official or private capacity.’  (emphasis added)"
"In the case of Karunathilaka v. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of"
"Elections  (S.C.)12  M.D.H.  Fernando  J.,  (G.P.S.  de  Silva  C.J.  and  D.P.S."
"Gunasekara J., agreeing) made the following observations with regard to the"
"application of Article 35 of the Constitution."
"‘What  is  prohibited  is  the  institution  (or  continuation)  of  proceedings"
"against the President. Article 35 does not purport to prohibit the institution"
"of proceedings against any other person, where that is permissible under any"
"other law. It is also relevant that immunity endures only ""While any person"
"holds  office  as  President"".  It  is  a  necessary  consequence  that  immunity"
"ceases immediately thereafter; (…) I hold that Article 35 only prohibits the"
"institution (or continuation) of legal proceedings against the President while"
"in office; it imposes no bar whatsoever on proceedings (a) against him when"
"he  is  no  longer  in  office,  and  (b)  other  persons  at  any  time.  That  is  a"
"consequence of the very nature of immunity: immunity is a shield for the doer,"
