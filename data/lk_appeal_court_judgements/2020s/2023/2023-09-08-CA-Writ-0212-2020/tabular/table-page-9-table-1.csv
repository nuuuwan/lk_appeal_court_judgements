"having signed the affidavit ‘1 R 4’ and stated that her previous statement made"
"on the 10th August 2016 to the effect that she did not sign ‘1 R 4’ is false15."
"Again,  the  Petitioner  has  written  an  undated  letter  to  the  1st  Respondent"
"denying having signed the affidavit referred to above. The petitioner's conduct"
"is seriously questionable under the given circumstances."
"Be that as it may, the Petitioner’s own letter dated 18th December 2018 marked"
"‘P 5b’, written to His Excellency the President, clearly establishes that she had"
"been aware that the 4th Respondent had obtained the Grant in his name at least"
"by the date of her letter. Even from the date of the letter ‘P 5b’, one year and"
