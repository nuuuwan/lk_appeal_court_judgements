"Subsequently, along with DW2, they visited PW2's home to discuss the accusation. The"
"Accused denied the claim and recommended that they lodge a police complaint instead of"
"making  unfounded  allegations.  DW1  conceded  that  she  was  unaware  of  any  romantic"
"relationship between the Accused and the prosecutrix at the time of the incident, learning"
"about it only later on."
"I am mindful of the observation made by Justice Sisira De Abrew J in Savinda v"
"Republic of Sri Lanka [2010], 1 S.L.R 32 at page 37, His Lordship held that;"
"“Learned SSC pointed out that he was arrested whilst hiding on the ceiling of the"
"appellant's  house.  She  tried  to  contend  that  he  went  into  hiding  because  of  the  guilty"
"mind. But when considering this contention one must one forget the fact that his wife was"
"present at the time of the arrest. No man will admit in the presence of his wife that he"
"committed sexual intercourse on a woman with or without consent.”"
"For  the  reasons  outlined  above,  we  believe  that  there  is  no  merit  in  any  of  the"
"grounds of  appeal presented  by  the  Counsel  for  the  Accused.  Consequently, we,  of this"
"court, find no justification to interfere with the findings, conclusions, or judgment of the"
"learned High Court judge dated 10.09.2020.  We therefore dismiss this appeal."
