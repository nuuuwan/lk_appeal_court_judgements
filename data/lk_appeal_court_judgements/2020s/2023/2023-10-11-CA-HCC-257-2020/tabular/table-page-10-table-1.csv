"Later,  around  5:30  p.m.,  PW2  approached  him  on  the  playground,  querying  if  he  had"
"harassed her daughter. He replied that he hadn't. After returning home, he informed his"
"wife  (DW1)  about  PW2's  allegation.  The  Accused,  DW1,  and  DW2  then  went  to  PW2's"
"residence  to  discuss  the  accusation.  Upon  their  arrival  at  PW2's  home,  DW1  told  PW2"
"that her husband hadn't harmed the prosecutrix and suggested that if they believed the"
"allegations,  they  should  report  it  to  the  police.  In  his  evidence,  the  Accused  neither"
"mentioned a secret affair with PW1 nor challenged the false accusation while at PW2’s"
"residence."
"In his cross-examination, when PW2 questioned the Accused about the incident, he"
"believed  it  referred  to  him  pushing  her  away  during  their  conversation.  He  further"
"confirmed that no specific allegations were hinted at him. Additionally, he mentioned that"
"when he visited PW2’s house later that day, he did not inquire about the accusation. He"
"later avoided approaching the police due to fear but claims to have voluntarily reported"
"to  the  police  station  later.  Upon  reviewing  the  evidence  provided  by  the  Accused,  it  is"
"apparent that he has contradicted what he stated earlier during his examination-in-chief."
"This clearly indicates a lack of consistency in his evidence, making it unreliable. When"
"examining the Accused's account, his reason for evading the police and not immediately"
"reporting to the station is implausible. If he genuinely did not commit such a grievous act,"
"then  why  did  he  refrain  from  approaching  the  police?  Furthermore,  during  his  cross-"
"examination, he indicated understanding PW2's inquiry as relating to him pushing PW1,"
"resulting  in  her  fall.  If  he  truly  believes  in  his  innocence,  his  absence  from  the  police"
"station  on  12.08.2009  seems  improbable.  Moreover,  the  Accused  did  not  mention  the"
"alleged  secret  affair  with  the  prosecutrix  when  he  was  at  PW2’s  residence.  This  detail"
"wasn't  revealed  to  PW2  until  the  trial.  We  find  no  logical  reason why  this  prosecution"
"witness would concoct such a lie to implicate the Accused. When contrasting the evidence"
"provided by PW2 with that of the Accused regarding what PW2 had questioned him about,"
"PW2's evidence appears consistent, whereas the Accused's does not"
"DW1,  Dulika  Priyadharashani  Mendis  (wife  of  the  Accused  and  relative  of  the"
"victim), testified that the prosecutrix and her family had a very close relationship with"
"her own family. DW1 mentioned that if the prosecutrix claimed she never interacted with"
"the  appellant,  it  was  a  blatant  falsehood.  This  was  because  the  prosecutrix  frequently"
"visited their home, assisting the appellant with household chores and childcare. On the"
"day  in  question,  the  Accused  informed  her  of  PW2's  claim  that  he  had  harmed  the"
"prosecutrix. When she inquired about the truth of this allegation, her husband denied it."
