"after 48 hours from the incident. In her expert opinion, she noted that lacerations are not"
"commonly observed during consensual intercourse. However, they are more likely to occur"
"when force is involved."
"The evidence presented by PW3 directs our attention to the brief history provided"
"by  the  prosecutrix,  the  injuries  observed  in  her  female  genitalia,  and  the  conclusions"
"drawn based on her expert opinion. Taking into account the brief history provided by PW1"
"to PW3, which highlighted that she was subjected to sexual abuse through intercrural sex"
"by the Accused forcibly, we find that this account remains consistent with all the evidence"
"we have reviewed above. Given the testimonies of PW2, PW5, PW6, and PW7, as well as"
"the medical report by PW3, we see no reason to doubt PW1’s account of her experience"
"A similar situation arose in the case of D. Tikiribanda v A.G [2010] B.L.R, CA case"
"no. 64/2003 decided on 06.10.2009, His Lordship W.L Ranjith Silva held that;"
"“The history given in the medical report is also consistent with the version of the"
"victim.  Although this  may  not  be  corroboration  in  the  strict  sense  it  could  be  taken  as"
"evidence consistent and thus form to some extent, corroboration and is admissible under"
"section 157 of the Evidence Ordinance. In addition to what I have already stated, in the"
"light of consistency in the evidence of the victim, of her mother and the medical report"
"which lend credence to the version of the victim, the discrepancy, if there is any, in the"
"evidence of the two witnesses on this point, could be easily ignored.”"
"Based on PW3’s expert opinion, the observed injuries and their pattern align with"
"the brief account provided by PW1. It was evident that the Accused exerted significant"
"force during penetration. After considering all these aspects, I am of the opinion that this"
"witness's testimony is reliable and can be accepted."
