"For instance, in K.R. KARUNARATNE .VS. THE STATE- 78 .NLR- 413, In Page"
"419 His Lordship RAJARATNAM, J observed"
"“ At this stage therefore the delay of 10 years to finally conclude this matter is in"
"my view a very relevant circumstance to be taken into consideration before allowing the"
"sentence of 2 years imprisonment to operate immediately. I am not aware of any case"
"where an accused person has been kept in suspense for so long a period due to no fault"
"of his own. The accused has always been present in Court and ready to receive justice at"
"the hands of Court. He has made no contribution to the delay. If there has been such an"
"earlier case I should imagine there would have been better reasons for the delay. The"
"fact  that  I  am  unable  to  lay  my  hands  on  any  precedent  does  not  deter  me  from"
"considering this delay in the circumstances of this particular case as a relevant factor for"
"the imposition of an appropriate sentence”."
