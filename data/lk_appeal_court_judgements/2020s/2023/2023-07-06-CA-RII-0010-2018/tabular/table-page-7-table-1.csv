"“5. Where a party has established that he had acted bona fide and done"
"his  best,  but  was  prevented  by  some  emergency,  which  could  not  have"
"been anticipated or avoided with reasonable diligence from being present"
"at the hearing, his absence may be excused and the matter restored. The"
"Court cannot prevent miscarriages of justice except within the framework"
"of  the  law:  it  cannot  order  the  reinstatement  of  an  application  it  had"
"dismissed, unless sufficient cause for absence is alleged and established."
"It cannot order reinstatement on compassionate grounds. Inasmuch as it"
"is a serious thing to deny a party his right of hearing, a court may, in"
"evaluating the established facts, be more inclined to generosity rather"
"than being severe, rigorous and unsparing”."
