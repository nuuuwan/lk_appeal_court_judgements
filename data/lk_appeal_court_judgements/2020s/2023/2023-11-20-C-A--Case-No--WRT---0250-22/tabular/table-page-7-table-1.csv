"A
ccording 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
clause 
of 
the 
agreement, 
the 
only"
"requirement to terminate the monthly tenancy is to give one month's"
"notice. 
In  such  circumstances, 
the  petitioners  could  not  have  a"
"legitimate  expectation 
that 
they  would  be  permitted 
to  possess"
"and/occupy the said premises peacefully and without any disturbances"
"in 
the  absence  of  a  clear  breach  of 
the  conditions  of 
the 
lease"
"agreements because it is clearly stated in the lease agreements that the"
"monthly tenancy could be terminated by giving one month’s notice. To"
"terminate  the  tenancy  by  giving  one  month's  notice,  breach  of  any"
"condition in the agreement is not required. The UDA has leased out the"
"premises,  and  when  they  want  to  take  back  possession,  the  only"
"requirement to be fulfilled is to give one month's notice. Therefore, both"
"arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the"
"petitioners  had  a  legitimate  expectation  and  the  competent  authority"
"has not formed the opinion under Section 3 of the Act in a reasonable"
"way cannot be accepted. It is apparent that  every step that has been"
"taken  up  to  the  stage  of 
issuing  quit  notices  has  been  done 
in"
