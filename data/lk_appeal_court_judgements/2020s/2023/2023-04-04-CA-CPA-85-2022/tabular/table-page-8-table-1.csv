"under section 24 (1) of the Act. The Court of Appeal or the High Court is not the"
"proper forum and has no jurisdiction to entertain such objections."
"Therefore,  it  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  with  regards  to  the  preliminary"
"objections of the petitioners, the submission that the lack of a written directive"
"renders  the  indictment  bad  in  law  cannot  be  maintained  as  the  Commissionâ€™s"
"directive is required in commencing the investigations as per Section 11 of the"
"CIABOC and an indictment served under Section 11 only requires the fulfillment"
"of  the requisites delineated under Section 12  of the CIABOC as established by"
"the Supreme Court. Therefore, an additional attachment of a written directive by"
"the Commission in order to serve an indictment is not intended by the law. As"
"such, the first submission of the petitioners cannot be maintained. Furthermore,"
"pertaining to the forum chosen to raise an objection against the defectiveness of"
"the  indictment  served  is  inappropriate  as  this  Court  lacks  the  jurisdiction  to"
"challenge  an  indictment,  such  an  application  must  be  made  by  way  of  a  writ"
"before the Supreme Court as mandated by Section 24 (1) of the CIABOC Act."
"Therefore, this Court observes that the learned High Court Judge of     Colombo"
"has  correctly  dismissed  the  preliminary  objections  of  the  petitioners  and  thus"
"affirms the order dated 21.02.2022."
"Application dismissed."
