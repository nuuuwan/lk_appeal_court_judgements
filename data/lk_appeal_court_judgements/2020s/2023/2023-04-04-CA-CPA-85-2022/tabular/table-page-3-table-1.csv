"This is a revision application against the order dated 21.02.22 delivered by the"
"learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden"
"in  Colombo.  The  accused-petitioners  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  petitioners)"
"aggrieved  by  the  said 
impugned  order,  has  preferred  this 
instant  revision"
"application to this Court in order to set aside the said order."
"The facts of the case are as follow. The petitioners were the accused of the High"
"Court of Colombo case bearing no. HCB/32/2017. The Director General of the"
"Commission  to  Investigate  Bribery  or  Corruption  framed  14  charges  under"
"Sections 19 (c) read with Section 25 (3) of the Bribery Act and Section 113 (a) of"
"the  Penal  Code  against  the  said  accused  or  the  petitioners  of  the 
instant"
"application.  However,  when 
this  matter  was 
fixed 
for 
trial  on  or  about"
"26.08.2019,  the  1st  accused-petitioner  brought  up  the  following  preliminary"
"objections:  1)  The  sanction  given  by  one  Commissioner 
to  commence  the"
"investigation and file charges in court is contrary to law. 2) The case must fail in"
"ab initio as it has failed to satisfy the law. 3) The Attorney-General cannot appear"
"on behalf of the Respondent. The aforesaid matters were fixed for argument and"
"the petitioners filed the written submissions consequently. However, prior to the"
"matters being taken up for argument, the respondent withdrew the lower court"
"case filed at the High Court of Colombo which engendered the following revision"
"applications  CA/PHC/APN/16/2020 
and  CA/PHC/APN/18/2020, 
thereby"
"rendering the above applications redundant."
"Thereafter the petitioners were indicted for the second time on 29.06.2021 under"
"the case bearing no. HCB/115/2021, under the same 14 charges framed by the"
"Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption. Consequently, the petitioners"
"took up the following preliminary objections on 13.12.2021."
