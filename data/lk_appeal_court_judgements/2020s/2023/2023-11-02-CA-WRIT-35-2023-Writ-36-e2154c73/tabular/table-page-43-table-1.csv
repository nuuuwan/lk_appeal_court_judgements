"confidence in the court, especially among the general public who are legally required to pay"
"taxes.  Further, if I were to offer the interpretation that was previously stated in this judgment,"
"it would inevitably give rise to a situation analogous to ‘self-serving’ which is in my opinion"
"fundamentally inappropriate and dilutes the quality of judicial discipline."
"Given  this  context,  I  take  the  view  that  the  current  case  is  not  an  appropriate  venue  for"
"debating whether a judge falls within the purview of an employee under section 83A of the"
"aforementioned  Inland  Revenue  Act  and  therefore  obliged  to  pay  APIT.  Hence,  I  should"
"refrain from overstepping the boundaries of judicial discipline by interpreting the said section"
"83A solely for the benefit of judges at a time when the Government of Sri Lanka has taken a"
"policy decision to enhance their revenue through APIT."
"However, this doesn’t in any way compromise the inherent powers of this Court and it is only"
"a matter of assaying whether the inherent powers of this Court should be exercised to interpret"
"the said section 83A here on the footing that judges are not the employees of anybody. This"
"is not a fit case to use the inherent powers of this Court to interpret section 83A based on the"
"arguments formulated by the Petitioners. Anyhow it must be stressed that this Court will not"
"hesitate at any time to give an interpretation lawfully to section 83A if there is a clear threat"
"to the independence of the judiciary."
"It is not only the judges who should uphold the independence of the judiciary but arguably it"
"is also the bounded duty of the remaining two limbs of the Government, namely the Executive"
"and the Legislature to facilitate the enshrinement of the independence of the judiciary. When"
"the judges refrain from interpreting the provisions of the legislation, such as what is spelled"
"out in section 83A, merely to maintain judicial discipline, as in this case, in my view, it is at"
"the  discretion  of  the  other  two  limbs  of  the  Government  to  take  the  lead  in  resolving  the"
"grievances relating to the remuneration of the judges. The learned President’s Counsel for the"
"Petitioners ardently and delicately placed before this Court the grievances faced by the judges"
"due  to  APIT.  As  such,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Executive  and  the  Legislature  may  take"
"cognizance of such grievances, to avoid erosion of the independence of the judiciary while"
"balancing the constraints in the country’s economy. The economic distress faced by the judge"
