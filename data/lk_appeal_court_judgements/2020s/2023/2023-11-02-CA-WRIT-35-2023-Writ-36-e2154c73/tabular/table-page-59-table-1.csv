"The effect of inflation on compensation, as envisaged by the Framers was considered at length"
"by Chief Justice Warran Earl Burger in United States vs. Hubert L. Will, 1980, 449 U. S."
"471 at page 483. According to Madison’s notes the tentative arrangement of the draftsmen"
"was  to  provide  that  the  Congress  could  neither  increase  nor  decrease  the  compensation  of"
"judges.  Gouverneur  Morris  raised  the  question  of  inflation  and  it  was  finally  agreed,  as"
"Hamilton wrote,"
"“…What might be extravagant today might in half a century become penurious and"
"inadequate. It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to"
"vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances; yet under such"
"restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the"
"individual for the worse.” The Federalist No. 79, pages 491 – 492 (1818)."
"Repeating what Chief Justice Burger quoted in Hubert L. Will, Justice Scalia said (Hatter,"
"page  584)  that,  “Since  Hamilton  thought  that  the  Compensation  clause  “put  it  out  of  the"
"power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [judge] for the worse”."
"There  are  factors  other than  tax,  as  Justice  Scalia  explained,  [Hatter, page  583]  that  could"
"affect the “value” of compensation although they are not elements of compensation itself. He"
"cited as examples, inflation, rates charged by government owned utilities, or import duties"
"that increase consumer prices. He said that, the Framers had this distinction well in mind and"
"gave the example of Hamilton writing in The Federalist No. 79, page 473 (C. Rossiter ed."
