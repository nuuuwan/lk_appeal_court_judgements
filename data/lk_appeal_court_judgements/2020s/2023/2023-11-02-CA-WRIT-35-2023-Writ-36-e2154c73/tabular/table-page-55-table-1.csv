"“The Government contends that Congress could reduce compensation as long as it did"
"not  “discriminate”  against  judges,  as  such,  during  the  process.  That  the  “freeze”"
"applied to various officials in the legislative and Executive Branches, as well as judges,"
"does  not  save  the  statute,  however.  This  is  quite  different  from  the  situation  in"
"O’Malley vs. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, 59 S. Ct. 838, 83 L. Ed. 1289 (1939). There"
"the Court held that the Compensation clause was not offended by an income tax levied"
"on Article III judges as well as on all taxpayers; there was no discrimination against"
"the plaintiff judge. Federal judges, like all citizens, must share “the material burden of"
"the government…” Id., at 282, 59 S. Ct., at 840. The inclusion in the freeze of other"
"officials who are not protected by the Compensation clause does not insulate a direct"
"diminution in judges’ salaries from the clear mandate of that clause; the Constitution"
"makes no exception for “nondiscriminatory” reductions. Accordingly, we hold that"
"the  statute  with  respect  to  Year  1,  as  applied  to  compensation  of  members  of  the"
"certified class, violates the Compensation clause of Article III”. (page 486, paragraph"
"226)"
