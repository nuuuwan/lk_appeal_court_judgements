"the  term  ""engagement""  to  those  obligations  which  the  law  imposes  on  a  man  without  the"
"intervention of any contract, either on the part of the obligor or the obligee, an engagement"
"to do or omit to do something amounts to a promise. Thus, the essential feature of the word"
"'engage' is a contract between two individuals."
"It is anathema to Article 4 of the Constitution if the conclusion is reached that the President"
"is the employer of the judge. The President does not contract with a judge. There is no meeting"
"of  the  minds  between  the  President  and  the  appointee.  The  President  does  not  engage  the"
"judge. It is important to note that the President appoints the judge and the President's role"
"ceases thereafter."
"The discipline of the judge is in the President ""on the recommendation of the Judicial Services"
"Commission"". The President himself has no real powers of disciplinary control and he must"
"always act on the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission (JSC). Neither the"
"President nor the JSC have any power to discipline a judge when he is acting as qua judge."
