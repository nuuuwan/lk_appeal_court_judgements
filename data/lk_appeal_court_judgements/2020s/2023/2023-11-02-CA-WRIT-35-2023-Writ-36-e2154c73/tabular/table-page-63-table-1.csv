"Hence, it appears, beyond any doubt, that, the majority decision of the court in Hatter, that"
"the  Medicare  tax  is  not  an  infringement  of  the  Compensation  clause  violates  its  own"
"declaration that,"
"“We  concede  that  this  Court  has  held  that  the  Legislature  cannot  directly  reduce"
"judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries."
"See 449 U. S., at 226”."
"The error it committed was, that, in the majority decision (at page 571) it was said, that,"
"“But  a  tax  law,  unlike  a  law  mandating  a  salary  reduction,  affects  compensation"
"indirectly, not directly.”"
"As it was said earlier in this judgment, only an act reducing the “value of” compensation, [not"
"reducing compensation itself] to explain further, something which is not an element of the"
"compensation itself, can escape the effect of the word “directly.”"
"Otherwise,  it  violates  the  first  proposition  above  referred  to,  based  on  the  Compensation"
"clause."
"This becomes clear from what Justice Scalia says at the end of page 585 and at the end of that"
"section of his dissenting opinion as,"
"“Had  Congress  simply  imposed  the  Medicare  tax  on  its  own  employees  (including"
"judges) at the time it introduced that tax for other working people, no benefit of federal"
"employment would have been reduced, because, with respect to the newly introduced"
"tax, none had ever existed. But an extension to federal employees of a tax from which"
"they had previously been exempt by reason of their employment status seems to me a flat"
"out  reduction  of  federal  employment  compensation”.  [Emphasis  in  “bold”  print"
"added, but emphasis in “italics” is in the original]"
"The principle is, hence, if there was no conferral of compensation, there cannot be a reduction"
"too. But a benefit that was available “by reason of their employment status,” if reduced, will"
"be a reduction of compensation."
