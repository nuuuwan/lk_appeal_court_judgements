"""withholding  tax""  or  ""tax  payable  by  withholding""  in  any  such  provisions  of  this  Act  shall,"
"subject to such modification, be deemed to be a reference to the ""Advance Personal Income Tax.""."
"The Petitioners' contention is that in terms of the said section 83A(1), only an employer shall"
"deduct APIT from his employee and thus the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice has no power"
"or authority to deduct APIT from the judges. The Petitioners state that such deduction is ultra"
"vires; unreasonable; etc."
"The other facet of the Petitioners’ argument is that it is a control test, in the classical terms"
"which is primarily used to determine whether a person is in employment or not. It is further"
"submitted that if one person has no control over how a person performs his duties, that person"
"is not an employer and within these parameters, judges are not in employment. In this sense,"
"the Petitioners referring to the definition given to the word “employer” in the Inland Revenue"
"Act No.24 of 2017 contend that, if there is no person who engages or remunerates then there"
"is  no  employer;  and  similarly,  there  is  no  person  who  engages  a  judge.  In  addition  to  the"
"above, the Petitioners assert that no person remunerates a judge since the salaries of the judges"
"of  the  High  Court  in  terms  of  section  7  of  the  Judicature  Act  shall  be  charged  on  the"
"consolidated fund. In summary, the Petitioners’ contention is that no one employs a judge"
"nor does anyone remunerate a judge and, in such circumstances, there is no employer for a"
"judge within the meaning of the said Inland Revenue Act."
