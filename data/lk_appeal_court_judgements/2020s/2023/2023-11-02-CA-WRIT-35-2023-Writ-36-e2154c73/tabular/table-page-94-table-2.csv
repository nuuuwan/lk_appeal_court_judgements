"Through  this  quoted  extraction,  the  legislative  intention  has  been  made  explicit  where  it"
"expressly admits the fact that judicial officers are subject to tax. However, a caveat has also"
"been expressed where the relevant authorities are requested to consider that drastic changes"
"are not made to the lifestyle of judicial officers as a result of taxation.  Further, the fact that"
"judicial officers are subjected to tax is buttressed by paragraphs 40 and 42 of the petition in"
"the case WRIT-35-23 as highlighted by the learned DSG."
"Concluding remarks"
"The  Constitution  is  the  supreme  law  of  the  land  and  as  per  Article  3  of  the  Constitution,"
"sovereignty lies in the people and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the government; thus,"
"the power of the people is exercised through the three pillars of the government, namely the"
"executive, legislature and the judiciary. Therefore, the judiciary is only one such pillar of the"
"government which exercises the judicial power of the people."
"The regulation of taxation by laws passed and implemented by the three pillars of government"
"serves the best interest of society. However, the efficacy of fulfilling such a task lies in the"
"principle  of  separation  of  powers  enshrined  within  the  Constitution.  As  the  learned  DSG"
"states in his submission “the legislature has the purse, the executive has its sword, and the judiciary"
"has the public confidence”: though akin to a slogan, it aptly describes the separation of powers"
"within  a  government  system.  Accordingly,  the  three  branches  of  the  government  are  to"
"operate independently from one another, and there shall be no interference of one in the other."
"There shall only be checks and balances between these three branches. This principle, which"
"is  provided  by  the  Constitution,  safeguards  the  independence  of  the  judiciary  in  a  delicate"
"balance."
