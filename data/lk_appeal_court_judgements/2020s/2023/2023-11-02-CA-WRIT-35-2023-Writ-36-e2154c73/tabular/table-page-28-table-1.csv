"In the present case, neither the petitioners nor the Judgesâ€™ Association concerned have been"
"consulted or been given an opportunity to present their views. It reflects a clear violation of"
"the rules of natural justice. It is axiomatic that aggrieved persons are entitled to be heard."
"Justice  A.  R.  B.  Amersinghe  held  in  the  case  of  Sarath  Amunugama  vs  Karu  Jayasuriya,"
"Chairman  UNP  and  others  2000  (1)  SLR  172  at  188  cited  R  vs.  Chancellor  University  of"
"Cambridge to say the following;"
"""As far as the law is concerned, we have in Sri Lanka in this area closely followed the common"
"law which, from very early times, recognized the right to a fair hearing. In R. v. Chancellor"
"of the University of Cambridge, (16), support for the right to a hearing was based by Fortescue"
"J. on the events in the Garden of Eden;"""
"""I remember to have heard it observed by a very learned man upon such an occasion, that"
"even God himself did not pass sentence upon Adam before he was called upon to make his"
"defence.  'Adam',  says  God,  'where  art  thou'?  'Hast  thou  not  eaten  of  the  tree,  whereof  I"
"commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?' And the same question was put to Eve also""."
"The  learned  President's  Counsel  submits  on  behalf  of  the  petitioners  that  judges  have  a"
"legitimate expectation that their salary will not in any way be reduced during their tenure as"
"judges.  The  Executive  cannot  interfere  with  the  salaries  of  judges  already  determined  by"
"Parliament. In the present case, the salary of the judges determined by Parliament has been"
"reduced  by  the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Justice.  The  judges  have  fashioned  their  lives  in  the"
"expectation that their actual salaries and remuneration will not be reduced during their tenure"
"of office. The charging of APIT is in breach of the legitimate expectations of the judges. It is"
"unreasonable that the remuneration of a judge be reduced during his tenure of office."
"The argument raised by the respondents regarding laches cannot be taken up at this stage of"
"the case. The respondents raised the same preliminary objection at the support stage, and this"
"Court issued notices. Thus, the said preliminary objection cannot be taken at this stage. It is"
"trite law that laches does not prevent a court from judicially reviewing a nullity."
"In Biso Menike vs Cyril de Alwis 1982 (1) SLR 368 on page 379, Justice Sharvananda held"
"that  laches  would  not  disentitle  the  petitioner  to  relief  where  the  decision  impugned  is"
"manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction."
