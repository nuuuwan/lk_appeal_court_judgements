"In the present judicial proceedings, this Court is presented with three compelling applications,"
"each filed by- members representing the learned High Court Judges, other Judicial Officers of"
"the Court of First Instances, and Judicial Officers of the Labour Tribunals. Throughout the"
"course of these proceedings, all parties involved, have eloquently presented comprehensive"
"and complete submissions on multiple occasions. In the matter before this Court, I have had"
"the privilege of reviewing the comprehensive draft judgment of His Lordship Justice Sobhitha"
"Rajakaruna. I wish to express my concurrence with the ultimate conclusion reached by Justice"
"Rajakaruna in this case. However, I am inclined to offer a separate and distinct perspective"
"concerning the interpretation of the concepts surrounding employer-employee relationships"
"and the broader notion of employment under the purview of the Inland Revenue Act, along"
"with  the  other  important  arguments  presented  by  the  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  and  the"
"learned Deputy Solicitor General."
"Nevertheless,  I  must  respectfully  dissent  from  the  views  expressed  by  His  Lordship  the"

"and academic interest, warrants the issuance of a separate judgment to elucidate the nuances"
"that have arisen during the course of the arguments."
