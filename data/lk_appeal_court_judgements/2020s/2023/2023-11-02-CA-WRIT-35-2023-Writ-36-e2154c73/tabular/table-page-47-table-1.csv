"Supreme Court has held that the instant amendment to the Inland Revenue Act which has"
"enacted APIT is Constitutional."
"As such although the judiciary is unique and is exercising the judicial power of the people the"
"Parliament  by  enacting  national  policies  is  exercising  the  legislative  powers  of  the  people"
"which is applicable to all members of the society and the members of the judiciary are also"
"part of that."
"As such if any party is to be exempted from being liable for tax, then the specific law passed"
"by the public policy must say so. But in the instant case the relevant act has not said so, hence"
"the  judiciary  also  like  any  other  member  of  society  to  whom  public  policy  applies  comes"
"within the provisions of the act."
"As  such  I  am  of  the  view  that  as  stated  by  His  Lordship  Justice  Rajakaruna  the  instant"
"application should be dismissed."
