"called upon to contribute on a non-discriminatory basis, directly or indirectly, to the State"
"coffers along with other members of the public despite the differences identified above.”"
"“In addressing these points, it is apposite to refer to the dissenting judgment of Justice Holmes,"
"with whom Justice Brandeis concurred, in Evans v. Gore (Supra. at page 265) where he held:"
"""The exemption of salaries from diminution is intended to secure the independence of judges,"
"on the ground as it was put by Hamiltion in the Federalist, (No. 79) that ""a power over a"
"man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will""."
"“That  is  a  very  good  reason  preventing  attempts  to  deal  with  a  judge's  salary  as  such,  but"
"seems to me no reason for exonerating him from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he"
"shares will all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot"
"be possibly made an instrument to attack independence as a judge. I see nothing in the purpose"
"of this clause of the Constitution to indicate that the judges were to be a privileged class, free"
"from bearing their share of the cost of the institution upon which their well-being if not their"
"life depends. We are of the view that the reasoning in the above cases is logical and instructive"
"on the issue of taxes on the salaries of judges. When a tax is applied across the board, as in"
"this case, without directly or indirectly targeting the judges, it cannot be said to be an intrusion"
"into  the  independence  of  the  Judiciary.  Taxes  are  one  of  the  main  revenue-generating"
"measures to enhance public finance. Facilities are open to all citizenry including judges of the"
"superior courts and judicial officers within the meaning of Article 111M of the Constitution.”"
"Learned counsel  for the respondents  further says that there is no logical reason to exempt"
"judges from making their contribution to the public coffers along with the other members of"
"the community. To that extent, the classification is permissible. Judges should have the same"
"obligations as other citizens on taxing matters. The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No."
"45  of  2022  was  certified  on  18.12.2022,  and  the  resolution  marked  as  P1  was  made  on"
"28.12.2022, while the application was filed only on 23.01.2023 just prior to the payment of"
"salaries  in  the  government  sector.  The  notice  of  the  application  was  handed  over  only  on"
"23.01.2023,  which  is  inadequate  notice  for  a  matter  of  this  nature.  In  all  of  the  aforesaid"
"circumstances, the respondents state that the petitioners are not entitled to the relief prayed"
"for  in  the  petition.  Learned  counsel  for  the  respondents,  moves  to  dismiss  the  petitioners'"
"application."
