"The Respondents contend that the corresponding entry in Column II in reference to the phrase"
"""A Government Institution” in Column I includes any person who pays remuneration and"
"thus unambiguously, judges fall within the said category of ‘other persons’ (as opposed to the"
"individuals listed in the said Column II) who pay remuneration."
"The reliefs sought in the instant Application by the Petitioners are for orders in the nature of"
"writs  of  Certiorari,  Prohibition  and  Mandamus.  Undoubtedly,  a  review  application  of  this"
