"the society at large when choosing where to draw the line to ascertain the group of persons"
"who should be exempted from APIT or any other taxes."
"In this regard, I simply cannot keep a blind eye on the Respondents’ submissions based on"
"the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in the relevant Special  Determination as described"
"above.  When  exercising  the  discretionary  jurisdiction  the  courts  ought  to  be  guided  by"
"justifiability, appreciating the public policy to a greater extent than demeaning such policies"
"for a mere benefit towards a smaller group of the society regardless of the high rank assigned"
"to such smaller group in the table of precedence in the country. Therefore, I need to convert"
"my examination to the key issues in this case focusing on the sociology of law."
"‘The  sociology  of  law  refers  to  the  sociological  study  of  law  and  law-related  phenomena,"
"whereby  law  is  typically  conceived  as  the  whole  of  legal  norms  in  society  as  well  as  the"
"practices  and  institutions  that  are  associated  with  those  norms’  (Vide  -  Mathieu  Deflem;"
"“Sociology of Law”, Oxford Bibliography4). ‘Law and sociology show similarities but also"
"important contrasts in the way they are constituted as intellectual fields and in their strengths"
"and  weaknesses  as  such.  Law's  particular  weaknesses  have  allowed  sociological  ideas  to"
"invade  legal  thought  in  certain  contexts  and  conditions’  (Vide  -  Roger  Cotterrell,  “Law's"
"Community:  Legal  Theory  in  Sociological  Perspective”  [1997],  published  by  the  Oxford"
"University Press; at chap.3 pp.41–72.)."
"Upon an independent study I have done on the above aspects of law, I must concentrate at"
"this juncture, on the judicial discipline which is a significant facet of the administration of"
"justice. An ethical question arises as to whether it is incumbent upon this Court to assume the"
"role of interpreting the respective law relating to APIT. It is obvious that this case primarily"
"revolves  around  issues  related  to  the  intricacies  of  remuneration  and  benefits  provided  to"
"members of the judiciary including me, my sister and my brothers on this panel of judges."
"One may even raise the issue of nondisclosure of such interest of the judges who are hearing"
"this Application. If this Court were to rule that judges are not obligated to pay taxes without"
"a statute clearly expressing the legislative intent, it could potentially lead to a loss of public"
