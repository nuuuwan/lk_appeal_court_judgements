"Even though the judges are referred to as the holders of ""public offices"", in Sri Lanka, there is"
"a clear distinction between ""judicial office"" and ""public office""."
"In  S  and  Others  vs  Van  Rooyen  and  Others  (General  Council  of  the  Bar  of  South  Africa"
"Intervening)  (2002 (8) BCLR 810, the South African Constitutional Court held;"
"""Judicial  officers  ought  not  to  be  put  in  a  position  of  having  to  do  this  or  to  engage  in"
"negotiations with the Executive over their salaries. They are judicial officers, not employees,"
"and  cannot  and  should  not  resort  to  industrial  action  to  advance  their  interests  in  their"
"conditions  of  service.  That  makes  them  vulnerable  to  having  less  attention  paid  to  their"
"legitimate concerns in relation to such matters, than others who can advance their interest"
"through normal bargaining processes open to them."""
"In Gilham (Appellant) vs Ministry of Justice (Respondent) [2019] UKSC 44, the Supreme"
"Court of the United Kingdom held:"
"""For the reasons given earlier, it is impossible to regard the Judiciary as employed under or"
"for the purposes of the Ministry of Justice.  They are not civil servants or the equivalent of"
"civil servants. They do not work for the ministry."""
"The Australian High Court held in ""Re Australian Education Union & Australian Nursing"
"Federation; Ex Parte Victoria (""AEU case"") (1995) 69 ALJR 451 (7 April 1995)"
"""In our view, also critical to a State's capacity to function as a government is its ability, not"
"only to determine the number and identity of those whom it wishes to engage at the higher"
"levels of government but also to determine the terms and conditions on which those persons"
"shall be engaged. Hence, Ministers, ministerial assistants and advisers, heads of departments"
"and high-level statutory office holders, parliamentary officers and judges would clearly fall"
"within this group. The implied limitation would protect the States from the exercise by the"
"commission  of  power  to  fix  minimum  wages  and  working  conditions  in  respect  of  such"
"persons  and  possibly  others  as  well.  And,  in  any  event,  ministers  and  judges  are  not"
"employees of a State."""
