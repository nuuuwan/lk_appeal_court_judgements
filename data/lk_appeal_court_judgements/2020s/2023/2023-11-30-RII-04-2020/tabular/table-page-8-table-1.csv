"continues to exist. This interpretation, as we find, is in accord with Section"
"108 of the Act. It is reflectible that in Vannattankandy Ibrayi’s case, the"
"two-Judge Bench observed that the rights stand extinguished as on the"
"distinction  of  the  demise,  for  there  is  destruction  of  the  superstructure"
"and  in  its  non-existence  there  is  no  subject  matter.  Thus,  the  land  has"
"been kept out of the concept of subject matter. In our considered opinion,"
"the Court in the said case failed to appreciate that there are two categories"
"of subject-matters, combined in a singular capsule, which is the essence"
"of  provision  under  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act  and  not  restricted  to  a"
"singular one, that is, the superstructure. In T. Lakshmipathi (supra) the"
"Court took note of the fact that the land and superstructure standing on"
"it as a singular component for the purpose of tenancy. It is in tune with"
"the  statutory  provision.  Therefore,  we  agree  with  the  proposition  stated"
"therein to the affect that “in the event of the tenancy having been created"
"in  respect  of  a  building  standing  on  the land,  it  is  the  building  and  the"
"land which are both components of the subject-matter of demise and the"
"destruction of the building alone does not determine the tenancy when the"
"land  which  was  the  site  of  the  building  continues  to  exist”.  On  the"
"touchstone  of  this  analysis,  we  respectfully  opine  that  the  decision"
"rendered in Vannattankandy Ibrayi (supra) does not correctly lay down"
"the law and it is, accordingly, overruled”."
