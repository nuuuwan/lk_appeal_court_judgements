"low-income 
families  who  had  been  adversely  affected  by 
floods  and"
"landslides  in  the  area.  In  proof  of  the  above  fact,  the  1st  to  4th,  and  7th"
"Respondents submitted the letter of the 1st Respondent dated 15th May 2018"
"marked as ‘R 5’. In the said letter, the 1st Respondent states that the allotments"
"of land were to be distributed to the persons affected by floods and landslides."
"Accordingly, this Court is satisfied that there was an urgency in acquiring the"
"land to accommodate the persons affected by floods and landslides. Section"
"38  A  of  the  Act  empowers  the  Minister  to  make  an  Order  to  take  over"
"immediate possession of the land on the ground of urgency. According to the"
"proviso to Section 38, such an Order could be made only at any time after a"
"Notice under Section 2 or a Notice under Section 4 is exhibited. In the instant"
"application, as I have already stated above, both the Section 2 Notice and the"
"Section 4 Notice had been exhibited. Accordingly, the Minister acting under"
"Section 38 A of the Act has published Notice ‘P 20’ in the Gazette notification"
"No. 2086/20 dated 3oth August 2018."
"Consequently,  the  1st  Respondent  proceeded  to  take  over  possession of  the"
"land acquired, through the Magistrate’s Court4."
"Another ground alleged by the Petitioner in support of its application is that"
"the  1st 
to  3rd  Respondents  abruptly  switched 
to  Section  38  A,  without"
"following  the  standard  procedure  under  Land  Acquisition  Act.  However,"
"admittedly, the 1st to 3rd Respondents have followed the procedure set out in"
"Sections 2 and 4 of the Act. Proviso (a) of Section 38 provides that at any time"
"after a notice under Section 2 is exhibited or any time after a notice under"
"Section  4 
is  exhibited,  where 
it  becomes  necessary 
to 
take 
immediate"
"possession of any land on the ground of urgency, the Minister may make an"
"order of possession under Section 38 A of the Act. Therefore, in a case where"
"there is an urgency, the Minister need not follow the standard procedure and"
"is statutorily empowered to make an Order under Section 38 A of the Act. As"
"I have stated above in this judgment, the Respondents have satisfied this Court"
"that  there  was  an  urgency  of  resettling  the  persons  affected  by  floods  and"
"landslides."
"The Petitioner has made a point that the land acquired is not suitable for the"
"construction  of  houses  or  other  buildings.  However,  other  than  the  bear"
"statement of the Respondents, no other evidence was produced by Petitioner"
