"The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st to 4th and 7th Respondents"
"advanced an argument that the Petitioner has no locus standi to maintain this"
"application. Admittedly, the Petitioner is a leaseholder for a period of fifty-"
"three years from the date of the lease ‘P 5’."
"The Oxford Dictionary of Law defines the English meaning of the Latin term"
"locus standi – ‘a place to stand’"
"The Black’s Law Dictionary defines it as – ‘the right to bring an action or to"
"be heard in a given forum’."
"In the case of Sonali Fernando v. A. G.6 His Lordship A. W. A Salam J, stated"
"that ‘… In law, locus standi is generally understood to be right to bring an"
"action, to be heard in Court, or to address the Court on a matter before it…’"
"In the case of Premadasa v. Wijeyewardena and others7 stated that ‘… The"
"law as to locus standi to apply for certiorari may be stated as follows: The"
"writ can be applied for by an aggrieved party who has a grievance or by a"
"member of the public. If the applicant is a member of the public, he must have"
"sufficient interest to make the application…’"
"In the case of A.R. Perera and others v. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka"
"and  another8  stated  that  ‘The  Court  would  not  listen,  of  course  to  a  mere"
"busybody who was interfering in things which did not concern him. But it will"
"listen to anyone whose interests are affected by what has been done.’"
"In light of the foregoing, since the Petitioner’s lease holding rights are affected"
"by the acquisition, I am of the view that the Petitioner has locus standi to have"
"maintained this application."
"Another argument advanced by the Respondents is that the Petitioner is guilty"
"of laches. The Extraordinary Gazette notification ‘P 20’ was published on the"
"30th August  2018  and  the  Petitioner  instituted  these  proceedings  on  the  4th"
"January 2019, within four months and five days. Therefore, I am of the view"
"that there is a considerable unexplained delay in instituting these proceedings"
"seeking to quash the Gazette notification ‘P 20’."
