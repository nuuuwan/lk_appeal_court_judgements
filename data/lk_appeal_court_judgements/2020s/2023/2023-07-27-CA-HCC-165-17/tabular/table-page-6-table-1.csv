"In  R  v  Boyesen  82  AC  768,  Lord  Scarman  held:  â€œThey do not arise for"
"consideration in this appeal. Possession is a deceptively simple concept. It"
"denotes a physical control or custody of a thing plus knowledge that you"
"have it in your custody or control. You may possess a thing without knowing"
"or comprehending its nature: but you do not possess it unless you know you"
"have it. I would adopt the description of possession given by Lord"
