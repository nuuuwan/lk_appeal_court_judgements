"Court Judge who evaluated the evidence has accepted the evidence as they were"

"T
he Accusedâ€™s version."
"The Accused elected to testify under oath. She stated that she was coerced"
"into going to India by Nimal who blackmailed her with a set of indecent photos"
"taken of her by Nimal and he had promised to hand over the photo with a negative"
"every time she returned from India. According to her, she had visited India five"
"times  with  Nimal,  and  on  her  return  journey  she  was  given  a  bag  each  time,"
