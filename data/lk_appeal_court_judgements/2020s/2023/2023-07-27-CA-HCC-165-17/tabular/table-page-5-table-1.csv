"Lord Wilberforce in Warner v. Metropoliton Police Commissioner (1968) 52"
"Criminal Appeal Report 373.  Held that;"
"“The question, to which an answer is required, and in the end a jury must"
"answer it, is whether in the circumstances the accused should be held to have"

"c
i
rcumstances- to use again the words of pollock and wright, possession in the"
"common law, P. 119- the ‘modes or events’ by which the custody commences and"
"the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating them to typical"
"s

tuations, that they must consider the manner and circumstances in which the"
"substance, or something which contains it, had been received, what knowledge or"
"means of knowledge or guilty knowledge as to the presence of the substance, or as"
"to the nature of what has been received, the accused had at the time of receipt or"
"thereafter up to the moment when he is found with it; his legal relation to the"
"substance or package (including his right of access to it). On such matters as these"
"(
not exhaustively stated) they must make the decision whether, in addition to"
"physical control, he has, or ought to have imputed to him the intention to possess,"
"or knowledge that he does possess, what is in fact a prohibited substance. If he has"
"this intention or knowledge, it is not additionally necessary that he should know"
