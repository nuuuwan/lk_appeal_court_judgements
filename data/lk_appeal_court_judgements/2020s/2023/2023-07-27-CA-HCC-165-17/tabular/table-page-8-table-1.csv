"●  The  Accused  admits  that  she  herself  had  packed  the  sarees  into  the"
"empty suitcase which was handed to her by Upananda."
"●  The Accused had known and subsequently given the combination “000”"
"to PW1 to open the suitcase."
"●  The  Accused  has  also  mentioned  that  she  has  travelled  to  India  on"
"several occasions and on every time she had been handed a suitcase to"
"be brought to Sri Lanka."
"We have taken these facts into consideration and upon applying the dictum"
"of Lord Wilberforce which was followed in our courts referred to above, we are of"
"the view that the prosecution has succeeded in establishing  that the Accused did"
"possess the requisite knowledge required for the purpose of proving the charges in"
"the indictment."
"For the above-said reasons, this Court is of the view that the grounds of"
"appeal raised by the Accused are without merit. We see no reason to interfere with"
"the  judgement  dated  30th  of  July  2017.  The  conviction  and  the  sentence  are"
"affirmed, and the appeal is accordingly dismissed."
