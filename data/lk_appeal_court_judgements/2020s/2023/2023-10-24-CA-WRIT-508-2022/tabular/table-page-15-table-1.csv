"a  promise  or  practice  by  the  authority  that 
is  said  to  be  bound  to  fulfil  the"
"expectation."
"In  general  terms,  a 
legitimate  expectation  arises  when  a  public  authority  makes  a  promise,"
"representation, or commitment to an individual or a group of individuals, and these individuals rely"
"on that promise to their detriment. In my view if the public authority subsequently acts in a way"
"that goes against the legitimate expectation, it may be subject to judicial review. The cases in which"
"it can be said that an established practice or policy gives rise to an expectation of consistent or equal"
"treatment.  Even  if  the  terms  of  the  policy  do  not  amount  to  a  promise  aimed  at  any  person  in"
"particular, the routine application of the policy to persons in the same category can give rise to an"
"'expectation' of similar treatment."
"Legitimate Expectation means that a person may have a reasonable expectation of being treated in"
"a  certain  way  by  administrative  authorities  owing  to  some  consistent  practice  in  the  past  or  an"
"express promise made by the concerned authority. According to this doctrine, a public authority can"
"be  made  accountable 
in 
lieu  of  a 
legitimate  expectation.  Thus,  the  doctrine  of  Legitimate"
"Expectation pertains to the relationship between an individual and a public authority."
"Legitimate expectation is not a legal right. It is an expectation of a benefit, relief or remedy that may"
"ordinarily flow from a promise or established practice. The term 'established practice' refers to a"
"regular,  consistent  predictable  and  certain  conduct,  process  or  activity  of  the  decision-making"
"authority.  The  expectation  should  be 
legitimate, 
that 
is,  reasonable, 
logical  and  valid.  Any"
"expectation which is based on sporadic or casual or random acts, or which is unreasonable, illogical"
"or invalid cannot be a legitimate expectation. Not being a right, it is not enforceable as such."
"It is a concept fashioned by courts, for judicial review of administrative action. It is procedural in"
"character  based on  the requirement  of  a  higher  degree of  fairness  in  administrative  action, as  a"
"consequence of the promise made, or practice established. In short, a person can be said to have a"
"'legitimate expectation' of a particular treatment, if any representation or promise is made by an"
"authority, either expressly or impliedly, or if the regular and consistent past practice of the authority"
"gives room for such expectation in the normal course."
"Therefore, it can be said that this doctrine is a form of a check on the administrative authority. When"
"a representation has been made, the doctrine of legitimate expectation imposes, in essence, a duty"
"on  public  authority  to  act  fairly  by  taking  into  consideration  all  relevant  factors  relating  to  such"
"legitimate expectation. It also adds a duty on the public authority not to act in a way to defeat the"
"legitimate expectation without having some reason of public policy to justify it doing so."
"Applying the same principle in Aruna Roy vs. Union of India (2002) 7 SCC 368 it was held that it is"
"for Parliament to take a decision on a national education policy one way or the other, court cannot"
"take  a  decision  on  the  good  or  bad  points  of  an  educational  policy.  Court  can  intervene  in  the"
"implementation of policy only if it is against any statute."
