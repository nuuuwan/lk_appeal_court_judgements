"However,  His  Excellency  the  President 
in  the 
Interim  Budget  Speech-2022  dated  30.08.2022"
"proposed certain reforms to the Public Sector, which included a revision to the compulsory age of"
"retirement of public officers being placed at 60 years. Pursuant to the above Budget proposal, by"
"Circular dated 14.09.2022 (marked P 7) the compulsory age of retirement of all public officers were"
"revised to 60 years. The Cabinet of Ministers by their decision dated 23.09.2022 (marked A 4) has"
"granted 
its  approval  to  the  recommendations  contained 
in  the  Cabinet  Memorandum  dated"
"09.09.2022 to restrict the age of retirement of Public Officers to 60 years. The said decision of the"
"Cabinet  of  Ministers  was  followed  by  the  Gazette  Extraordinary  bearing  number  2309/04  dated"
"05.12.2022 (marked P9) the Minutes of Pensions pertaining to the compulsory age of retirement of"
"all public officers was made 60 years with effect from 01.01.2023 inclusive of the nursing service."
"The Petitioners aver inter alia that the document under challenge marked P 9 is contrary to various"
"representations made by the Respondents and responsible officers of the State. The said document"
"marked P9 reflecting the Minutes of Pensions is harmful to the health sector of the country and is"
"contrary to the legitimate expectation of the nurses to serve until the age of 63 years."
"The  Petitioners  in  paragraphs  25,  26  and  27  of  their  amended  Petition  set  out  their  grievances"
"against any revision of the age of retirement from 63 as follows;"
"25. The Petitioners further state that relying on the said document marked P3 setting the"
"compulsory age of retirement at age 63, several nurses had taken loans and adjusted their"
"expenditure on the expectation that the said nurses would be employed until they reach the"
"age 63."
"26. The Petitioners further state if the said Gazette marked P 9 is left to be operative on the"
"nursing  service, 
the  officers  who  would  be  subject  to  compulsory  retirement  as  at"
"01.01.2023 will be left without any form of remuneration whatsoever until the pension is"
"duly computed and approved to be paid upon following the necessary laws, regulations and"
"protocols of the State."
"27. The Petitioners further state that upon submitting the necessary papers the procedure"
"would consume over four to six months wherein the officers representing the nursing service"
"affected by the said Gazette marked P 9, would be left without any form of remuneration"
"whatsoever."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent  argued  that  the  Petitioners'  entire  case  appears  to  be"
"premised on a purported legitimate expectation and the alleged frustration thereof. The Public and"
"Judicial Officers (Retirement) Ordinance, No. 11 of 1910 (as amended) and Rules made thereunder"
"govern  the  age  of  retirement  and  the  procedure  to  be  adopted  in  the  event  a  revision  is  made"
"effective. Pursuant to Rule 1(2) of the said Rules, the compulsory age of retirement for judicial and"
"public officers has been determined to be 60 (sixty) years and may be extended by the Competent"
"Authority in the interest of service. In terms of Rule 5 of the said Ordinance, the approval of the"
"Competent  Authority,  which 
is  the  Public  Service  Commission 
in  the 
instant  application 
is  a"
"mandatory requisite for the revision of the age of retirement to be effective."
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the revision of the age of retirement"
"to  63  years  was  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  as  the  appointing"
"authority. The age of retirement of the public sector is a matter of policy and the Cabinet of Ministers"
"is vested with the power in terms of Article 55 of the Constitution. The justifications for the revision"
