"In  this  case,  it  is  common  ground  that  the  Appellant  was  a  police  officer"
"coming under category of a public servant. The prosecution had proven that"
"the Appellant being a public servant did solicit and accepted the gratification"
"as disclosed by PW1. The Appellant was found guilty of only the 2nd and the"
"4th  counts  after  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  found  the  prosecution’s"
