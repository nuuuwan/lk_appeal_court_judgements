"innocence. This is the “Golden Thread” that was discussed in Woolmington"
"v. DPP [1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:"
"“Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is"
"always  to  be  seen,  that  it  is  the  duty  of  the  prosecution  to  prove  the"
"prisoner’s guilt…… If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there"
"is  a  reasonable  doubt,  created  by  the  evidence  given  by  either  the"
"prosecution  or  the  prisoner…...the  prosecution  has  not  made  out  the"
"case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.”"
