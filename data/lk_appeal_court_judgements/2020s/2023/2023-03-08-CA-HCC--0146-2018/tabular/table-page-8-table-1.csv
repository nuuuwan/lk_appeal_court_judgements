"The Appellant admitted that he obtained the services of PW1 as an informant."
"On the date of the incident, the Appellant had gone to Kudamaduwa where"
"he was building a house. According to him, he had received a call from PW1"
"regarding  an  information  pertains  to  drugs.  When  he  went  and  met  the"
"complainant to obtain the information, he saw a van coming in that direction."
"Having  thought  that  this  may  be  a  trap  to  arrest  him,  he  fled  the  scene"
"immediately with his pillion rider. He denied that he accepted any money on"
"that day as claimed by PW1."
"On analysing the dock statement of the Appellant, he had gone to the place"
"of incident upon called by PW1 to pass an information. This clearly indicates"
"that  good  cooperation  had  existed  between  the  Appellant  and  PW1.  The"
"conduct of the Appellant after running away from the scene and not reporting"
"to  his  police  station  clearly  strengthens  the  prosecution’s  story.  Further"
"surrendering to court thorough an Attorney-at-law, further strengthens the"
"prosecution’s version. Being an experienced police officer, he failed to even"
"to inform to his higher officers why he decided to surrender to the court. His"
"conduct has been highly suspicious in this case."
"The conduct of the accused before and after the crime is also very relevant"
"as  circumstantial  evidence.  From  the  circumstantial  evidence  available"
"before it, the court can draw inference and arrive at its conclusion."
"Learned High Court Judge in his judgment has very extensively considered"
"the stand taken by the Appellant in his judgment. The Learned High Court"
"had given plausible reasons as to why he rejected the dock statement of the"
"Appellant. The relevant portion is re-produced below:"
