"In light of the foregoing, this court vacates the learned Magistrate's order dated 29.07.2015,"
"finding that the learned Magistrate had erred in law and fact by assuming that the Cemeteries"
"and  Burial  Grounds  Ordinance  deals  with  possession  of  a  burial  ground  and  granting"
"possession  to  the  ‘Proper  Authority’.  This  court  holds  that  such  a  manifest  error  in  law"
"amounts  to  exceptional  grounds  required  to  invoke  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Provincial High Court.  Therefore, the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Puttalam"
"dated 22.11.2016, which affirms the learned Magistrate's order, is also hereby set aside."
"Furthermore,  pursuant  to  Section  68(3)  of  the  Primary  Courts  Procedure  Act,  this  court"
"orders the possession of the disputed premises (cemetery) to be granted to the Appellants (the"
"Church of Ceylon)."
"Hence, the Appeal is allowed."
