"Maduwantha, ran away with the other daughter. She claimed to hear shouting from the"
"house  and while  she could  not  make  out what  they  were  saying  exactly,  she  heard  the"
"deceased call out her name."
"After some time, she reunited with her eldest son near the entrance and they both"
"returned to the house. She stopped at the gate in fear for her life as PW2 went inside and"
"checked. PW2 told her that the deceased had fallen on the floor. They tried to look for a"
"three-wheeler to take the deceased to the hospital. Both failed to find one. By the time"
"PW1 returned to the gate PW2 had returned with some Police Officers."
"PW1 identified the voice of the person who yelled the words “maranawa, kotanawa,"
"kapanawa” as the Accused. The Accused had been living with the family of the deceased"
"for  two  years.  Further,  she  indicated  that  she  had  an  intimate  affair  during  this  time"
"which continued after the Accused left their home. It is further contended by PW1 that"
"she met the Accused at hospital on the day of the murder when the Accused visited her"
"husband who had been hospitalized following an attack by unknown persons. (According"
"to PW1 this was due to an illicit affair the deceased had with an individual named Kumari,"
"who was also visiting the deceased at the time PW1 went to see him.)"
"PW2  in  his  evidence  narrates  a  similar  story.  Though  in  contrast  to  PW1’s"
"evidence, PW2 claims that PW1 was not at the scene when the yelling of those words was"
"heard as she had gone to take a bath when they heard the shouting. On returning to the"
"house after running away first when he heard the voice, though unable to see in the dark,"
"PW2 heard the deceased shout ""ammo"" near the living area who then asked PW2 to take"
"him to the hospital. PW2 claims that he could not get close as he heard a voice telling him"
"""avoth maranawa, kotanawa"". It should be noted that in both instances although he heard"
"the voice, he could not identify the voice on either occasion."
"PW5,  namely  Kanakaratnam  Rajesh,  is  a  person  known  to  the  deceased  and  a"
"neighbour who resided at his sister's house 500m away from the deceased's residence. In"
"his evidence, PW5 stated that the two daughters of the deceased came to their house at"
"19.30-1945hrs saying ""nande nande mama enawa passen"". PW5 claims that he took steps"
"to hide the children. Around 19.45-20.00hrs the Accused then came to the house asking if"
"the  children  came.    PW5  opened  the  door  and  saw  the  Accused  trying  to  hide  a  knife,"
"which after a scuffle he took from the Accused but gave back to him since it was pointed"
