"as one  of the robbers only a few days after the robbery.”"
"I
n Bhagtu v. Emperor, Criminal law Journal Vol.29 1928 page 758, it was held:"
"“Now remains the question of Santa Singh’s evidence. He says that while he was running"
"away, he recognized Bhagtu and two other persons, with whom we are not concerned, by their"
"voices. Now if this statement was to be believed then it would not be necessary at all to consider"
"the evidence of Baru, the   approver, because that alone would  be direct evidence of the  complicity"
"of Bhagtu in the murder of Inder Singh. But there are difficulties in the way of prosecution before"
"i
t
 
can induce this court to accept the evidence of Santa Singh. Santa Singh, immediately after the"
"attack of Inder Singh’s party commenced., ran away to the Railway Station for protection, and it"
"does not appear that he mentioned  the names of these three persons, whom he has named now, to"
"any  one of the Railway employees at the Railway Station, as some of the assailants of Inder Singh."
"Immediately after the attack he met Banta Singh Lambardar who deposes that he does not know"
"i
f
 Santa Singh made any statement to this effect. Besides, to recognize a person in a pitch dark"
"n

sky experiment, and, even if Santa Singh’s statement be accepted for what it is worth.”"
"Sri  Lankan  jurisprudence  is  not  unfamiliar  with  the  use  of  voice  identification"
"evidence in criminal trials. For instance, his Lordship Sisira de Abrew J. in Hatangalage"
"Ariyasena v. Attorney General CA 68/2011 decided on 21.2.2013, considered this point (at"
"p. 5):"
"“Next question that arises for consideration is whether the accused appellant could be"
"convicted on voice identification…The accused appellant, prior to the separation from his wife, was"
"l
i
v
i
ng in his wife's house which was in the same land where the ancestral house was located."
"Kalyani was living in the ancestral house. She says that the accused appellant and Nalani were"
"l
i
v
i
ng together for several months. The accused appellant made utterances which I have referred"
"to earlier. When I consider all these matters I hold the view that there was no difficulty for her to"
"i
dentify the voice of the accused appellant.”"
"His  Lordship  cited  the  following  passage  from  the  judgment  of  Kirpal  Singh  v."
"State of Uttar Pradesh AIR (1965) 712 in which Justice Shah held:"
"“It is true that the evidence about identification of a person by the timbre of his voice depending"
"upon subtle variations in the overtones when the person recognizing is not familiar with the person"
