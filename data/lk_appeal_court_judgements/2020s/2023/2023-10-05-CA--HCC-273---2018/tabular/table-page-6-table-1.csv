"“An  accused  of  murder,  alleges  that  grave  and  sudden  provocation  he  was"
"deprived of the power of self-control. The burden proof is on A”."
"In the case of The King vs James Chandrasekera 44 NLR page 97, Howard CJ"
"held that “In regard to section 105, the expression “burden of proving” is used"
"in the sense of introducing evidence and not burden of establishing a case, for"
"the latter remains throughout the trial on the prosecution. The burden of proof"
"in section 105 is an evidentiary provision. All that the section says is that the"
"duty  of  making  a  general  or  a  special  exception  a  fact  in  issue  is  on  the"
"accused.”"
"Therefore,  in  the  instant  case  the  prosecution  is  alleging  that  the  deceased"
"disappeared after visiting the appellant and thereafter his body was found and"
"the appellant is admitting that the deceased visited the appellant. But he says"
"that there were two other people with the deceased at the time of the visit."
"Therefore, if the accused is to substantiate his denial in an acceptable way it"
"would have been most prudent for the appellant to place the evidence of those"
"two people with whom the deceased had visited him or at least have mentioned"
"their names. This does not by any means suggest that an accused has to prove"
"his innocence."
"Furthermore, in the instant instance the  prosecution has made an allegation"
"against the appellant, with uncontradicted lengthily cross examined evidence"
"that the deceased was last seen in the company of the appellant and later he"
"had been found dead and the appellant had confessed to the relatives of the"
"deceased that he killed the deceased. Therefore, the only irresistible inference"
"that can be drawn from these circumstances is that the appellant committed"
"the offence of murdering the deceased."
"The dock statement made by the appellant does not create any doubt in the"
"case of the prosecution. It has been held in many of our cases that when a dock"
"statement is made that it has to be acted upon if the court believe the version"
