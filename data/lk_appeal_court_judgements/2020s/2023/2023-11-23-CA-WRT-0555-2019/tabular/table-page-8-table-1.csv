"Act, 
the  Minister 
referred 
the  dispute 
to 
the  4th  Respondent,"
"Arbitrator."
"In these circumstances, I hold that despite the question of payment"
"of  gratuity  to  the  5th  to  14th  Respondents  had  arisen  after  their"

"provisions  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act.  In  these  circumstances,"
"under Section 4 (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Minister has"
"powers  to  refer  any  industrial  disputes  to  an Arbitrator.  It  is  to  be"
