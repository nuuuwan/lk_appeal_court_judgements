"In  B.R.R.A.  Jagath  Pramawansha  v.  The  Attorney  General  CA  Appeal  No."
"173/2005, decided on 19.03.2009, his Lordship Sisira de Abrew J. analysed a few of the"
"leading authorities on this point thus:"
"""Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that in a"
"case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be drawn, such an inference must be"
"the one and only irresistible and inescapably conclusion that the accused committed the offence."
"When the evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and inescapable"
"conclusion that can be arrived at is that the accused committed the murder..."""
"Similarly, His Lordship Sisira de Abrew J. in Sudu Hakuruge Jamis and another"
"v. The Attorney General, CA 204/2010 decided on 13.11.2013, held further:"
"""Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that in a case of"
"c

rcumstantial evidence if the Court is going to arrive at a conclusion that the accused is guilty of"
"the offence, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that"

"The main contention of the Accused was that the learned Trial Judge arrived at"
"the conclusion that the Accused is the murderer without analyzing the evidence of PW1,"

"In his treatise ‘Law of Evidence’ (Volume 1) E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy (at page"
"257), sets out the principle of voice recognition thus:"
"""Some witnesses purport to identify a person by his voice. It is not safe to rely on such"
"i
dentification and the liability to error is great. This is particularly so when the identification was"
"done at night. But when the accused was intimately known to the witness, who identified him by"
"h
i
s
 
voice and gait, the Supreme Court of India declined to hold that the identification was unsafe."
"In South Africa, voice identification parades have been held with dubious results."""
"T
he following judgments were used to buttress the views of the learned author: In"
"Nga Aung Khin v. Emperor   AIR (1937) Rangoon 407 BA:"
"“
Now it is never safe to rely on the identification of a person by his voice. One is always"
