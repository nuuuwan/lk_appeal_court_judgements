"who claimed that he knew the accused, and arrived at the conclusion that the evidence was"
"unsatisfactory. Therefore, the court held that the evidence is not sufficient to establish the identity"
"of the appellant to the required standard namely, beyond reasonable doubt.”  [emphasis added]"
"On the  subject  of  voice  identification,  we  may  also  refer  to  the  foremost  text  on"
"criminal law Archbold (2019 Ed.) 14-71, which states at page 1862:"
"""Where voice identification (now commonly referred to by speech scientists as ""speaker"
"comparisons"") is in issue, the jury should be given the full Turnbull warning, appropriately"
"modified: R v Hersey (1998) Crim.L.R. 281, CA; Phillips v. DPP (2012) UKPC 24; (2013) Crim.L.R."

kely to be reliable when carried out by experts (as to which, see below) using acoustic,"
"spectrographic and sophisticated auditory techniques: R v. Flynn and St John (2008) EWCA Crim"
"970; (2008) 2 Cr.App.R. 20); accordingly, a warning to a jury should be even more stringent than"
"that given in relation to visual identification: R v Roberts (2000) Crim.L.R. 183, CA.”  [emphasid"

"In R v. Hersey (1998) Crim.L.R. 281 it was held:"
"“There was not a great deal of authority on how a judge should direct a jury in respect of voice"
"i
dentification. A judge should direct the jury on the basis laid down by the court of appeal and in"
"the judicial studies board specimen directions in respect of visual identification, but tailored for"
"the purpose of voice identification or recognition. That would follow, suitably adapted, the"
"guidelines in Turnbull (1976) 63 Cr.App.R. 132. It was vital that the judge spelt out the risk of"
"m
i
staken identification and the reason why a witness may be mistaken, pointed out that a truthful"
"w
i
tness may yet be mistaken, and dealt with the strengths and weaknesses in the case before him."
"In this case, the judge dealt fully with the issue in his summing up.”"
"The judgment of R v. Kris Ronald Flynn [2008] EWCA Crim 970 provides a helpful"
"discussion on the issue of voice identification. The judgment considered the evidence of"
"experts in voice identification (first category) and the evidence of lay witnesses (second"
"category). The Court of Appeal observed:"
"“The first category, expert evidence, in this field can be of two types: firstly, auditory"
"analysis and secondly acoustic/spectrographic analysis. The second category of evidence falls into"
"a
 
group described by the experts in this case as lay listener evidence. The latter requires that the"
"w
i
tness possesses some special knowledge of the suspect that enables him or her to recognise the"
"suspect's voice. The most common example of such evidence is the knowledge of a close relative or"
"friend. However, there are other persons who may acquire sufficient special knowledge by their"
"familiarity with the suspect's voice. For example, a person may acquire such familiarity by the"
