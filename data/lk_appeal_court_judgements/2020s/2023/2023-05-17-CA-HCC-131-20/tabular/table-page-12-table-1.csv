"We are mindful of the utmost importance of correct identification of an Accused in"
"a criminal trial primarily for the severity of the penalties imposed, which curtails one’s"
"liberty. In the recent judgement of Dassanayake Lekamlage Somapala alias Gangabada"
"Sudu  and  others  v.    Attorney  General,  CA  208-210/2011  decided  on  02.09.2014,  his"
"Lordship Anil Goonarathne J. echoed our concern:"
"“A very important aspect of a criminal trial is that the perpetrators of the crime need to be"
"i
dentified with certainty. Absence of identity of accused would be fatal to the prosecution case. The"
"l
earned High Court Judge has merely referred to the items of evidence of the declaration (P5) but"
"has not considered its probative value.”"
"As  there  must  be  an  abundance  of  caution  that  must  be  exercised  in  carefully"
"combing through the evidence and given the absence of any guidance similar to that of"
"the Turnbull principles, this Court is of the view that it would be in the interests of justice"
"and  clarity  to  set  out  certain  safeguards  to  assist  a  court  that  is  tasked  with  the"
"unenviable  task  of  having  to  determine  conviction  or  acquittal  of  an  Accused  which  is"
"based on voice identification (or “ear witness evidence” as referred to in legal literature)."
"Having examined several foreign authorities on this point we are of the view the primary"
"safeguard that can be gleaned from the same is the availability of evidence to establish"
"the relationship between the Accused and the witness. As noted in the aforesaid judgment"
"of R v. Kris Ronald Flynn: “So far as lay listener evidence is concerned, in our opinion, the"
"key to admissibility is the degree of familiarity of the witness with the suspect's voice.”"
"Legal literature also points to a similar safeguard: The only precondition, if one can call"
"it  that,  is that  the  Crown must  lay  a foundation for  the witness’  ability to  identify  the"
"voice (by adducing evidence that the witness had more than fleeting exposure to the voice"
"outside of the criminal encounter in circumstances where the witness could connect the"
"voice  to  a  particular  person) 
(vide  Christopher  Sherrin, 
‘Earwitness  evidence;  the"
"reliability of voice identifications’ Osgoode Hall Law Journal 52.3 (2015) : 819-862.)"
"With the foregoing in mind, we will now consider whether the learned High Court"
"Judge has correctly analysed the evidence of PW1 who claims to have identified the voice"
"of  the  Accused,  and  examine  whether  the  evidence  is  satisfactory  to  bring  home  a"
"conviction.  We will reproduce the relevant portion of the judgement in this regard (on"
"page 350 of the Brief):"
