"omission as a measure to maintain the vehicle's privacy. He recalled that post-raid, while"

"of the officers occupying the backseats. The motorcycle was taken into custody by PW3."
"He confirmed that the substance was weighed in the presence of the other officers and the"
"Accused, before proceeding to the police station. It was acknowledged that the time taken"
"post-arrest  and  the  time  spent  at  the  jewelry  shop  for  weighing  the  substance  were"
"accurately accounted for, affirming that the raid was properly conducted."
"Considering the evidence provided by PW1, we find his testimony truthful and consistent,"
"making him a reliable witness whose evidence can be accepted."
