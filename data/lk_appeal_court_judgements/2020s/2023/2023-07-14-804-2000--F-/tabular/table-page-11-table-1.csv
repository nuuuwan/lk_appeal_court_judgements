"It is worthy to note that according to the assessment register 6වි1 from 1986 onwards, owners"
"name has been changed and it indicates for the year 1986 successors of L.J.R De Silva and for"
"the period of 1987-1990 Erin Malkanthi De Silva’s name appears on the register."
"The said Malkanthi De Silva is the 4th Defendant-Appellant who gave evidence before the learned"
"District Judge. It is observable that in cross-examination the said witness the 4th Defendant could"
"not describe the boundaries of the subject land."
"Court draws the attention to the plan submitted by the contesting Defendants, bearing no 397"
"dated 04.09.1985 marked as 4වි1 and produced in evidence. The said plan depicts lot ‘D’ in plan"
"bearing no 5402 dated 30.03.1940 [P2] made by M.S De Silva licensed surveyor and filed of"
"record  in  District  Court  of  Colombo  Case  no  617/P  which  is  in  the  lot  allocated  to  Richard"
"Vincent Mendis in the said final partition decree of the District Court of Colombo case bearing"
"no 617/Partition."
"The said lot ‘D’ was subdivided into lots 1,2,3,4 and 5 by plan bearing no 397 dated 04.09.1985"
"[4වි1]. Therefore, it is apparent that the Defendant-Appellants had admitted that the impugned"
"corpus is lot ‘D’ depicted in the final partition plan bearing no 5402 dated 30.03.1940 [P2]. This"
"is tantamount to an admission that the original owner of lot ‘D’ is Richard Vincent Mendis."
"Since the Plaintiff has proved her title, it is the burden of the Defendant-Appellants to prove their"
"prescriptive right to the subject matter."
"According to Section 03 of the Prescriptive Ordinance, proof of exclusive possession by a title"
"adverse to or independent of that of the plaintiff is an essential element to prove prescriptive title."
"Hence,  it  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  Defendant-Appellants  had  not  proved  the  necessary"
"ingredients to claim a Prescriptive title to the subject matter of the instant action. Apparently,"
"the Defendant had failed to establish that said Lindamulage John Richard De Silva had acquired"
"a Prescriptive title to the subject land."
"It is noteworthy that the preliminary plan bearing no 6305 dated 20.03.1993 and report were"
"marked  as  ‘X’  and  ‘Y’  respectively,  by  the  contesting  Defendants  in  cross-examination  of  the"
"Plaintiff."
"It is seen that the boundaries of Plan ‘X’ tallies with the corpus described in the schedule to the"
"Plaint. Nevertheless, the extent surveyed in Plan X is 38.9 Perches and the extent of Lot ‘D’ in"
"Plan marked as [P2] described in the schedule to the Plaint is 29.85 perches."
