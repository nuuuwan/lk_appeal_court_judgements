"The report [X1] states that the boundaries are shown by 3,4,5,6,7 Defendants. Since the extent"
"surveyed  is  more  than  9.05  perches  had  been  surveyed  extra  and  included  to  the  corpus."
"However, the surveyor had superimposed Lot ‘D’ in Plan ‘P2’ on Plan ‘X’. Therefore, it is clear"
"that the 4th to 11th Defendants are in possession of the adjacent land to Lot ‘D’."
"It  is  to  be  observed  that  the  title  deeds  marked  as  4වි2,  4වි4,  4වි5  and,  4  වි6  relied  upon  by"
"contesting Defendants, referred to a Plan bearing no 397 dated as 02.09.1985 [4වි1]. However,"
"court observes that the report pertaining to the said Plan [4වි1] was not produced in evidence"
"nor filed of record."
"It is worthy to note that since those title deeds were executed in the year 1985 and assuming"
"that the contesting Defendants encroached upon to lot ‘D’ and commenced adverse possession"
"in  1985,  and  since  the  Plaintiff  instituted  the  instant  partition  action  on  30.03.1992,  the"
"contesting  Defendants  have  not  proved  that  they  have  exclusively  possessed  the  corpus  with"
"defined  boundaries  for  a  period  of  10  years  to  establish  prescriptive  possession  to  acquire"
"prescriptive right."
"Therefore,  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  contesting  Defendants  had  not  proved  the  necessary"
"ingredients to establish their prescriptive possession to claim a prescriptive right to the corpus"
"in dispute."
"Hence, it clearly manifest that the learned District Judge had come to the correct findings of fact"
"and law and held against 4th to 11th Defendant-Appellants. As such, we see no reason to interfere"
"with the judgment of the learned District Judge of Panadura dated 17.08.2000. Therefore, the"
"appeal is dismissed with costs."
