"“As the evidence was presented to the Jury at the trial, the statements contained in the dying"
"deposition P9 formed to a very large extent the foundation of the case against the accused,"
"and it was in our opinion imperative that they should have been adequately cautioned that,"
"when considering the weight to be attached to this evidence, they should appreciate that the"
"statements of the deponent had not been tested by cross-examination."
"The reliance was also placed on the decision in Justinpala v. Queen [1964], 66 NLR, 409, His"
"Lordship T.S Fernando J held that:"
"“While  the  necessity  of  a  direction  in  regard  to  corroboration  of  a  dying  declaration  or"
"deposition  must  depend  on  the  particular  circumstances  of  each  case,  we  think  the  jury’s"
"attention should  ordinarily be  drawn to  the fact  that the  declaration or  deposition,  as  the"
"case may be, has not been tested in the usual mode available to a party affected by it, viz. by"
"cross  examination.  There  may,  of  course,  be  other  ways  of  testing  the  truth  of  such  a"
"statement,  as  for  example,  by the  presence  or absence of  other evidence  corroborating  the"
"statement. In this apparent conflict of decisions of this Court, we prefer to follow the earlier"
"decision in Asirvadan Nadar’s case (supra) in so far as it requires a trial judge to direct the"
"jury in regard to the absence of cross-examination.”"
"Further Justice Sisira De Abrew held that in the case Ranasinghe v Attorney-General [2007]"
"(Supra):"
"“As there are inherent weaknesses in a dying declaration which I have stated above, the trial"
"Judge  or  the  jury  as  the  case  may  be  must  be  satisfied  beyond  reasonable  doubt  on  the"
"following matters,"
"(a) Whether the deceased, in fact, made such a statement,"
"(b) Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and accurate,"
"(c) Whether the statement made by the deceased person could be accepted beyond   reasonable"
"doubt,"
"(d) Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying declaration could be"
"accepted beyond reasonable doubt,"
"(e) Whether witness is telling the truth,"
