"said “මාපිටිගම සල්ලි ප ාියට පෙන ලකී පිහිපයන් ඇන්නා” He took down what the deceased said in a"
"piece  of  paper  and  entered  them  in  the  crime  book  (CNB).  The  CNB  was  produced  before"
"court and has been subjected to cross examination. Paragraph 113 contained the said dying"
"declaration.  It  was  further  revealed  from  the  evidence  that  while  the  three-wheeler  was"
"halted in the police station, sergeant Sirisena upon the instruction of the OIC went to the"
"three-wheeler and questioned the deceased as to what happened. Then the deceased made"
"the said dying declaration and he proceeded to take it down. Thereafter sergeant Sirisene"
"advised the persons who accompanied the deceased to admit the deceased to hospital.”"
"“Hence it is understandable from the said evidence that sergeant Sirisena’s said visit was not"
"made  in  order  to  record  the  dying  declaration  of  the  deceased.  At  the  cross  examination"
"sergeant Sirisena said that since the deceased was in a critical condition with heavy bleeding"
"he promptly proceeded to take down the dying declaration in a piece of paper and thereafter"
"he entered the dying declaration in the CNB. In the aforesaid circumstances I do not find any"
"irregularity caused  in  the course  of the  recording  of the  dying  declaration  which  would  be"
"prejudicial  to  the  substantial  rights  of  the  Appellant.  When  the  authenticity  of  the  dying"
"declaration is not blameworthy it is admissible evidence against the Appellant.”"
"We note that all three witnesses indicated that the Deceased had told them that Sasi shot"
"him. These dying depositions were made at different times. The question arises: should the"
"statement made remain consistent throughout?"
"In  the  Indian  case  of  Smt.  Kamala  Vs.  State  of  Panjab  (1993)  1  SCC  1,  His  Lordship  K."
"Jayachandra Reddy, J held that:"
"“It is also settled in all those cases that the statement should be consistent throughout if the"
"deceased had several opportunities of making such dying declarations, that is to say, if there"
"are more than one dying declaration they should be consistent. If a dying declaration is found"
"to be voluntary, reliable and made in fit mental condition, it can be relied upon without even"
"any  corroboration.  In  a  case  where  there  are  more  than  one  dying  declaration  if  some"
"inconsistencies are noticed between one and the other, the court has to examine the nature"
"of the inconsistencies namely whether they are material or not. In scrutinising the contents"
"of various dying declarations, in such a situation, the court has to examine the same in the"
"light of the various surrounding facts and circumstances.”"
