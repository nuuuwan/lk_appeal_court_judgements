"Later Justice Ranasinghe, J (as was then ) in  Jajathsena and Others v. G,D,D."
"Perera, Inspector,1992  (1) SLR 371. Has relied on the above judgment and held that"
"“The principles laid down by the authorities, referred to above, make it clear: that,"
"although the findings of a Magistrate on questions of fact are entitled to great weight, yet,"
"it  is  the  duty  of  the  Appellate  Court  to  test,  both  intrinsically  and  extrinsically  the"
"evidence led at the trial: that, if after a close and careful examination of such evidence,"
"the Appellate Court entertains a strong doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the Appellate"
"Court must give the accused the benefit of such doubt."
"Therefore, we hold that there is a clear misdirection by the High Court Judge."
"The next question arises, concerning the probability of evidence of PW02."
"According to PW02, she has identified the 1st Accused through his voice and even"
"when she saw him upon opening the door. PW01 is the person who asked PW02 to open"
"the door.  PW01 states that even though he has known the Accused for 15 years he couldn’t"
"identify  him  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  It  is  strange  to  note  that  although  PW01  and"
"PW02 were present at the incident only PW02 was able to identify him. Both witnesses"
"were present at the time PW02 identified the Accused."
"The Conduct of PW02 is not that which is expected of a prudent, reasonable person."
"In the position of PW02 who claims to have known the Accused for the last 15 years, at"
"the least she could have asked the accused inquiring about the purpose for him to come"
"that night with unknown individuals, or would have told her husband about the accused"
"or when she saw the gun she should have shouted."
"We  are  mindful  that  before  the  incident  they  had  gone  to  a  neighbor's  house  to"
"watch the match. Because the 1st witness couldn’t identify the 1st Accused whom he had"
"known  for  about  15  years,  where  the  PW02  states  that  she  opened  the  door  upon"
"recognizing the Accused voice creates doubt."
"Further,  we  observe  the  conduct  of  PW02,  without  informing  her  husband,  and"
"inquiring about the Accused creates doubt as to whether they were present at the time of"
"that incident."
