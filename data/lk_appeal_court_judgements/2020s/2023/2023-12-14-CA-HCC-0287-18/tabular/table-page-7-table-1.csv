"Ismail, J in Wijepala v. The Attorney-General, 2001 (1) 46 in page 58,"
"“Learned  President's  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted,  however,  that  the"
"testimony  of  Senaratne  was  completely  untrustworthy  and  of  such  poor  quality  that  a"
"conviction  against  the  appellant  cannot  possibly  be  sustained  in  law.  His  testimonial"
"trustworthiness on vital aspects relating to the incident was assailed in an attempt to cast"
"a doubt even in regard to his presence at the time the deceased had received the fatal stab"
"injury."
"……………"
"Senaratne  stated  in  his  evidence  that  he  took  his  injured  son  in  a  car  to  the"
"hospital.  The  Gramasevaka  Jayapala testified  that  he  provided  his  car for  the  purpose"
"and that he himself accompanied Senaratne and his injured son in the car to the hospital."
"Although  the  Gramasevaka  testified  that  Senaratne  was  known  to  him,  there  is  no"
"evidence that Senaratne revealed the identity of the assailant to him that night or even"
"thereafter.  The  failure  of  Senaratne  to  inform  the  Gramasevaka  of  the  identity  of  the"
"assailant therefore raises a serious doubt in regard to the presence of Senaratne at the"
"scene  of  the  incident  and  his  claim  to  have  identified  the  appellant  as  the  assailant."
"Applying the test of spontaneity, his belatedness reduces the weight of his evidence and"
"affects his credibility."
"………"
"The evidence of Senaratne who was the sole eyewitness to the incident is open to"
"suspicion.  The  trial  judge  has  failed  to  appreciate  that  his  evidence  in  regard  to  the"
"identity of the appellant has not been supported by any other item of evidence. There is"
"therefore a strong doubt as to the guilt of the appellant and, as such, the benefit of the"
"doubt should have been given to the appellant. The Court of Appeal has erred in affirming"
"the conviction without adequately testing the evidence of Senaratne. For these reasons, I"
"allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The conviction and"
"sentence imposed on the appellant by the High Court are set aside and the appellant is"
"acquitted."

"“These facts are not corroborated by the witness's mother, his sister or by Piyal. In"
"fact Ak's testimony was directly contradicted by the two of them."
