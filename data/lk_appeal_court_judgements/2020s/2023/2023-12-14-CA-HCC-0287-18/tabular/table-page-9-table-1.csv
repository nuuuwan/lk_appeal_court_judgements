"Using this test, a strong doubt, as I have stated, has been created in my mind that the"
"conviction is right, and the benefit of this doubt must be reckoned in favour of the accused."
"The conviction is set aside and the accused acquitted.‚Äù"
"Considering the evidence led by PW02 we note that she has failed to inform her"
"husband who was with her at the time that she identified the first Accused. And also it is"
"strange to note that PW01 who has known the 1st Accused sometimes could not identify"
"the 1st Accused at that time. Therefore, this raises serious doubt regarding the presence"
"of both witnesses at the scene of the incident."
"Further, we observed that any reasonable person would ask in these circumstances"
"at night, that is when a known person comes with an unknown person, what are you doing"
"here? Why have you come? According to PW02 she never questioned the 1st Accused."
"The Learned Trial Judge ought to have addressed to his mind all these improbable facts."
"I hold that the trial judge has failed to appreciate that the evidence of PW02 regarding"
"identity with regards to the 1st Accused was improbable."
"Therefore, we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond"
"reasonable doubt."
"For the above-mentioned reasons conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High"
"Court Judge is set aside. And Accused is Acquitted."
"Appeal Allowed."
