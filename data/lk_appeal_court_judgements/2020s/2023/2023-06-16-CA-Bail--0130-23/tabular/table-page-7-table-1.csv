"CA BAL 130-2023"
"It is pertinent to quote the remarks made by the Hon.Minister when the"
"Bill  of  PTA 
(Amended)  Act  No.12  of  2022  was  presented 
to 
the"
"Parliament. The Minister remarked as follows:"
"“Having  regard  to  all  the  changes  which  have  taken  place 
in  our"
"country during the last 43 years, we have whittled down the provisions"
"of  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Act,  diminished  its  rigidity  in  a  manner"
"that  is  appropriate  to  the  present  stage  of  development  of  Sri  Lankan"
"society.  We  have  stopped  short  of  abolishing  it  altogether.  That  is  too"
"extreme  a  step  and 
lacks  a  sense  of  balance”.(Colum-788  of 
the"
"Hansard)."
"“…..when  you  take  the  Amendments  a  whole,  in  combination,  I  make"
"bold to say that the cumulative effect of these Amendments is to make a"
"very substantial improvement of the existing law…….I can convince any"
"objective 
fair-minded  person 
that 
these  Amendments,  without  any"
"extraneous agenda, will make a profound impact upon the existing laws"
"of this country and that these Amendments will significant further the"
"cause of human rights and human freedom in Sri Lanka”. (Colum-780"
"of the Hansard)."
"“…….the existing position in our country is that there can be and there"
"had  been,  in  some  cases,  unfortunately,  and  interval  as  long  as  six"
"months  or  nine  months  between  one  date  of  trial  and  another,  this"
"means  that  the  person  who  is  subject  to  the  Determination  Order  is"
"languishing in custody for unjustifiably long period because the trial is"
"taking so long” (Colum-781 of the Hansard)."
"Hence, when interpreting the provisions in the PTA amended Act No.12"
"of  2022,  not  only  it  should  reflect  the  intention  of  the  Legislature,  but"
"also reflect the true meaning of the words used in the Statute."
"The main objection taken by the Respondent is that in view of Section"
"15 B of PTA has no application in this matter since the indictment has"
"been already served on the accused in the High Court at Bar."
