"The Learned High Court Judge had accurately analysed and considered the"
"evidence presented by both parties and arrived at a proper finding."
"Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, I conclude that the"
"prosecution has proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. I further conclude"
"that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the decision of"
"the Learned High Court judge of Colombo dated 21/03/2019."
"Hence, the appeal is dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
