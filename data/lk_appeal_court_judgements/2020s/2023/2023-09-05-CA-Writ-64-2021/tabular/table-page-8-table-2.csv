"‘public’ may be subject to judicial review in respect of those powers and duties even when"
"they are not statutory or prerogative."
"Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law,5th Ed., page 49 states;"
"Two definitions of ‘public’ can be discerned in the Datafin Case. First, there is the extent to which the"
"body  operates  under  the  authority  of  the  government  or  was  established  by  the  Government  or,"
"presumably, by some other recognized public authority. Secondly is performed against a background"
"of statutory powers even though there is no specific statutory or prerogative authority for the power"
"which is sought to review. Both these approaches involve some link between the Government or the"
"legislature, and the body in question…the current approach of the courts is to consider whether the"
"body  is  woven  into  the  fabric  of  public  regulation  or  governmental  control  of  an  activity  or  is"
"integrated into a system of statutory regulation, but for its existence, a governmental body would"
"have assumed control over the activity regulated by the body under challenge.”"
