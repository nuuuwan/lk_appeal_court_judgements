"Smith Maxwell, Page 305 states,"
"“When exercising a discretionary power, a decision maker may take into account a range of lawful"
"considerations. Some of these are specified in the statute as matters to which regard may be had."
"Others are specified as matters to which regard may not be had.  There are other considerations"
"which are not specified but which the decision maker may or may not lawfully take into account.  If"
"the exercise of discretionary power has been influenced by considerations that cannot lawfully be"
"taken into account, or by the disregard of relevant considerations required to be taken into account"
"(Expressly or Impliedly), a court will normally hold that the power has not been validly exercised…”"
