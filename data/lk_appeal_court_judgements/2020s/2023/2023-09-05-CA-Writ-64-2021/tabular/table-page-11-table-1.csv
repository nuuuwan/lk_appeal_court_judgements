"It  is  of  utmost  importance  for  a  director  to  disclose  his  interests,  if  any, in  respect  of a"
"matter  to  be  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  including  himself.  Failure  to  do  so  may"
"imply  a  lack  of  honesty  and  sincerity  on  the  part  of  the  5th  Respondent  and  the  only"
"inference that could be drawn is the 5th Respondentâ€™s bad faith."
"Section  10A  of  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation  Act  No.  28  of  1961(as  amended)"
