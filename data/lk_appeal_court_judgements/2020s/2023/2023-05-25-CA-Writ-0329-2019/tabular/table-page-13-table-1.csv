"In Ishak v. Laxman Perera, Director General of Customs and others14 it was"
"held  that,  ‘where  there  is  an  alternative  procedure  which  will  provide  the"
"applicant  with  a  satisfactory  remedy  the  Courts  will  usually  insist  on  an"
"applicant exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial review’."
"‘the alternative procedure to be exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review"
"is in accord with judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy"
"of last resort.’"
"I am mindful that there had been instances where our Courts have provided"
"relief  through  writs  where  the  contractual  or  commercial  character  of  the"
"transaction is  overshadowed  by an administrative  malady  that  needs  to  be"
"remedied15. But this is not such a case. The impugned decision, in this case,"
"is based on the interpretation of the statute, NFC Act, and on the change of"
"government policy upon Cabinet Decision ‘1 R 1’."
"Conclusion"
"Having considered the arguments presented to this Court by all the parties, I"
"am of the view that the reliefs sought by the Petitioners have become futile by"
"the subsequent Cabinet Decision ‘1 R 1’."
"Furthermore, in the instant case, prerogative remedies cannot be invoked in"
"respect of the termination of the contract."
