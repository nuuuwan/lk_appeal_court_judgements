"Another  matter  which  needs  the  attention  of  this  Court  is  the  fact  that  the"
"Cabinet approved the rescinding of the agreements subject to the approval of"
"the Attorney  General  and without  prejudice  to the  actions  already  taken  in"
"terms of Circular ‘P5 (i)/ P 5(ii)’. It is true that Respondents have failed to"
"disclose any document to the effect that the Attorney General has concurred"
"with the imputation of the policy of the Cabinet of Ministers. However, in"
"paragraph (a) 1 of the Cabinet Memorandum dated 13th March 2020, under"
"the  heading  of  ‘observations’,  it  is  specifically  stated  that  the  Attorney"
"General has advised the NFC to cancel the Circular mentioned in proposal No."
"4.1, Circular No. DMS/360/NFC/P dated 17th June 1999 under the heading of"
"‘National Film Policy and Guidelines’, issued by the Secretary to the Ministry"
"of Finance and Planning. Accordingly, the above submission of the Petitioner"
"is devoid of merit. Moreover, the Cabinet decision dated 5th May 1999 upon"
"which Circular ‘P  5 (i)/ P 5(ii)’ was issued had also been cancelled by the"
"subsequent Cabinet decision ‘1 R 1’."
"Another potential  argument  is that even if the concurrence of the Attorney"
"General  is  obtained  the  agreement  entered  into  by  the  NFC  with  private"
"circuits  falls  within  the  phrase  ‘actions  already  taken  in  terms  of  the  said"
"Circular’ in the Cabinet decision. The Cabinet decision ‘1 R 1’ states that the"
"said decision should be without prejudice to the actions already taken in terms"
"of the Circular. Obviously, this should be any action already taken under the"
"agreements entered pursuant to Circular P 5(i)/P 5(ii). In my view, any one"
"should  not  be  allowed  to  interpret  the  agreement  itself  as  an  action  under"
"Circular ‘P 5 (i)/ P 5(ii)’, concerning the Petitioners."
"In light of the foregoing analysis, I am of the view that Petitioner’s application"
"has become futile."
"In  the  case  of  Rathnasiri  and  others  v.  Ellawala  and  others  Marsoof  J.,"
"observed that ‘a Writ will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile’"
"In Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne and others7 Soza J., observed that the ‘the"
"writ of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result will be futility,"
"frustration, injustice, and illegality’"
