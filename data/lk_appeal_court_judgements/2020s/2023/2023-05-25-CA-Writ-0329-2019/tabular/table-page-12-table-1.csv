"In the case of Jayaweera v. Wijeratne10 His Lordship G.P.S. de Silva J., (as"
"His Lordship then was) observed, ‘Where the relationship between the parties"
"is  a  purely  contractual  one  of  a  commercial  nature  neither  certiorari  nor"
"mandamus will lie to remedy grievances arising from an alleged breach of"
"contract or failure to observe the principles of natural justice even if one of"
"the parties is a public authority.’"
"Further, it was observed that ‘the fact that the parties are amenable to writ"
"jurisdiction would not change the character of the decision if the decision is"
"made in exercise of the power springs from contract’."
"In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte11 it was held that ‘The"
"Writ will not issue for private purposes, that is to say for the enforcement of a"
"mere private duty stemming from a contract or otherwise. Contractual duties"
"are enforceable by ordinary contractual remedies such as damages, specific"
"performance, or injunction. They are not enforceable by Mandamus which is"
"confined to public duties and is not granted where there are other adequate"
"remedies."
"Further,  in  Gawarammana  v.  The  Tea  Research  Board12  it  was  held  that"
"‘powers derived from contract are matter of private law. The fact that one of"
"the  parties  to  the  contract  is  s  public  authority  is  not  relevant  since  the"
"decision sought to be quashed by way of certiorari itself was not made in the"
"exercise of any statutory power’."
"It  was  observed  in  the  case  of  De  Silva  v.  Sri  Lanka  Telecom13,  ‘Neither"
"Certiorari nor Mandamus will lie to remedy the grievances arising from an"
"alleged breach of contract’."
"It is trite law that prerogative writs are discretionary remedies, and therefore,"
"not entitled to invoke when there is an alternative remedy available."
