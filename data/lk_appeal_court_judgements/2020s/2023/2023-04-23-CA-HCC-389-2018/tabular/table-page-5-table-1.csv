"Another  ground  urged  by  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant 
is  the 
lack  of"
"accurate  and  consistent  identification  of  the  appellant  because  according"
"to the prosecution the incident had taken place around 6.30 in the evening"
"and  according  to  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant  there  was  no  evidence  of"
"proper  illumination,  at  the  home  when  the  incident  is  supposed  to  have"
"taken place."
"But  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondents  urged  strenuously  that  the"
"evidence of the victim was cogent and at the time of the incident the victim"
"had  not  been  suffering  from  any  mental  disability.  The  Counsel  for  the"
"respondents  further  averred  that  as  with  regard  to  light  the  appellant  is"
"supposed to have come to the scene on a motor bike and if that is so there"
"is a possibility of the bike of the appellant having the night lamps on. But"
"this submission of the Counsel for the respondent this Court observes to be"
"mere conjecture and there is no evidence to that effect. Therefore, at this"
"point 
this  Court  recalls 
that 
the  victim 
in  her  evidence 
in  chief  had"
"identified the accused by name only at the fifth attempt by the prosecution"
"which  we  note  to  be  is  not  very  spontaneous,  but  being  waivered.  This  is"
"further  highlighted  by 
the 
fact 
that 
the  victimâ€™s 
identification  of 
the"
"appellant  to  the  mother  is  slightly  different  that  with  the  identification"
"given to the doctor."
"The  evidence  of  the 
investigative  officers  had  been  that  the  place  of"
"incident had been shown by the victim and she had shown a rubber estate"
"in which the illumination had to be obtained via the torches they had been"
"carrying. Therefore, the available illumination at the time of the incident is"
"not  supported  by  any  evidence  of  the  prosecution.  The  victim  and  her"
"mother  had  not  been  questioned  on  the 
illumination  at  the  place  of"
