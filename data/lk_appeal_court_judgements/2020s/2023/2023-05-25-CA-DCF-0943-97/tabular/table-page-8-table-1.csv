"Nevertheless, no points of contest have been raised at the trial before the District Court"
"on the mortgage bond."
"In the case of Lairis Appu Vs. Tennakoon Kumarihamy4 Sinnetamby, J., held as follows;"
"“Our Registration Ordinance provides for the registration of documents and not for the"
"registration of titles. If it had been the latter, then, from whatever source the title was"
"derived,  registration  by  itself  would  give  title  to  the  transferee.  When,  however,"
"provision is made only for the registration of documents of title, the object in its simplest"
"form, is to safeguard a purchaser from a fraud that may be committed on him by the"
"concealment or suppression of an earlier deed by his vendor. The effect of registration"
"is  to  give  the  transferee  whatever  title  the  vendor  had  prior  to  the  execution  of  the"
"earlier unregistered deeds”."
"The learned President’s Counsel also argued that to be entitled to the benefit of prior"
"registration,  the  competing  deeds  should  be  executed  by  the  same  person  and  since"
"P4/P5 had been executed by Luwishamy but not by the original owner Allis, P4/P5 had"
"not  originated  from  the  ‘same  source’.  Therefore,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"argued that P4/P5 is not entitled to acquire the benefit of prior registration over 9V1."
"To  substantiate  that  argument,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  cited  the  authority,"
"James Vs. Carolis5. In that case, A conveyed the land to B. After A’s death, his heir C"
"transferred his inheritance rights of the property from A to D. That transfer deed was"
"registered before the registration of B’s deed. In an action between B and D, the court"
"had held that since D’s deed was registered before B’s deed, D is entitled to the benefit"
"of prior registration. When considering the above facts of that case, it is clear that ‘same"
"source’ means any person who belongs to the chain of title to the land but not the same"
"4 (1958) 61 N.L.R. 97."
"5 17 NLR 76."
