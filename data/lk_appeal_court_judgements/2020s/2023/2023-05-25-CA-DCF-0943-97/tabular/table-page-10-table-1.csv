"registration of an instrument does not confer on it any effect or validity it would not"

"same source "" originated in the application of the Registration Ordinance to competing"

"the  ‘same  source’  and  the  Court  cannot  agree  with  that  argument  of  the  learned"
"President’s  Counsel.  Under  the  above-stated  circumstances,  I  hold  that  there  are  no"
"merits  in  the  arguments  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  appearing  for  the  10th"

"Plaintiff as costs of this Appeal."
"Appeal dismissed with costs."
