"deed marked as P4/P5 had been registered in 1900 that deed is not entitled to acquire"
"the  benefit  of  prior  registration  over  the  10th  Defendant’s  title  deed  marked  as  9V2"
"which was registered in the Land Registry subsequent to P4/P5 for the reason that the"
"title which flows on P4/P5 is not from Allis but from Luwishamy."
"The learned Counsel appearing for the 10th Defendant also relying on section 7 of the"
"Registration of Documents Ordinance argued that ‘same source’ does not mean that the"
"competing deeds should be executed by the same person but could be any other person"
"who is in the line of succession. Therefore, the position of the learned Counsel for the"
"Plaintiff  was  that  since  Allis’s  rights  had  devolved  on  P1  on  Luwishamy,  the  deed"
"marked as P4/P5 which Luwishamy had executed should be considered as originated"
"from the ‘same source’."
"Section 7 (1) of the Registration of Documents Ordinance as applicable to the instant"
"action is as follows;"
"“An instrument  executed or made on or after the 1st  day of  January 1864, … shall,"
"unless it is duly registered under this Chapter, …  be void as against all parties claiming"
"an  adverse  interest  thereto  on  valuable  consideration  by  virtue  of  any  subsequent"
"instrument which is duly registered under this Chapter …”"
"In the instant case, Allis had mortgaged his rights to Hendrick in 1895 by the mortgage"
"bond  marked  as  9V1 which  was  registered  in  the  Land  Registry.  Thereafter,  Allis’s"
"rights to the property had been transferred to Luwishamy on the Fiscal’s Conveyance"
"executed  in  1910  marked  as  P1.  P1  was  not  registered  in  the  Land  Registry.  The"
"Registration  of  Documents  Ordinance  is  concerned  with  the  priority  of  deeds  and  it"
"does not invalidate the unregistered instruments."
