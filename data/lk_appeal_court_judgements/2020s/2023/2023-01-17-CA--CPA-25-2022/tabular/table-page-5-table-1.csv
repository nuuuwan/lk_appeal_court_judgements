"But  the  evidential  value  of  the  recoveries  made  on  the  statement  of  the"
"suspect is to be considered at trial stage but the question to be considered"
"now  is  whether  the  remanding  of  the  suspect  is  fair  in  view  of  the  facts"
"revealed at the investigations. But in the recently decided judgment of the"
"Supreme Court SC Appeal 53 of 2022 has held that morality should not be"
"considered in an application for bail. The said Judgement reads as follows,"
"“……………………….morality as a yardstick in an application for or revision in"
"relation to an offence committed under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous"
"Drugs  ordinance,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  erred  in"
"considering  morality  as  a  yardstick  or  an  exceptional  ground 
in  an"
"application  for  revision 
in  relation  to  an  offence  committed  under  the"
"Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.”"
"As such we see no exceptional ground urged by the Counsel for the suspect"
"hence the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed."
