"the Appellant the counsel argued that prosecution witnesses were called before one Magistrate"
"and the judgment was by another Magistrate.  Therefore, at the time of writing the judgment,"
"the Judge lost the opportunity to observe the demise of the witness.  Thus, amounting to an"
"unfair evaluation of evidence."
"E
ven though the Plaint was amended in criminal cases there is no provision to do so.  Once the"
"Plaint is filed in court the Judge must frame charges.  The charges can be amended but not the"
"Plaint.  At the time of framing charges, the Judge did so because he was satisfied that there"

"It could have been considered a difficult station while there was the war, but 2013 was not a"
"time when there was any problem in the country.  However, one must remember that a delay"
"of nearly three years cannot be considered simple ground.  For such a delay to be considered"
"an exceptional ground, there should be more arguments to shock the conscience of the bench."
"The judicial mind should be touched to accept the reasons given warrants for consideration."
