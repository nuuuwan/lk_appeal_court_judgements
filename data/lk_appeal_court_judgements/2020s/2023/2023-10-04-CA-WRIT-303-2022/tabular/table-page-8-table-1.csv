"In  addition  to  the  above,  the  Petitioners  sought  in  argument  that  the  Commissioner  is"
"entrusted with the powers of a District Court under the provisions of sections 12, 13, 14 and"
"17B of TEWA, for the purposes of any inquiry conducted by him under the said Act. The"
"Petitioners referring to section 17 of the Act argue that there remains a requirement to conduct"
"an inquiry by the Commissioner consistent with the principles of natural justice.1"
"On  a  careful  perusal  of  the  provisions  of  the  TEWA,  it  appears  that  two  instances  can  be"
"possibly  envisaged  in  respect  of  termination  of  employment  under  this  Act.  Firstly,  an"
"employer  may  terminate  the  employment  of  workmen  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  in"
"section 2(1) of TEWA2 and the second instance would be that the employer terminates the"
"employment  of  workmen  duly 
following 
the  provisions  of 
the  said  section  2(1).  The"
"termination referred to in the instant Application falls into the above second limb as the 3rd"
"Respondent 
(employer)  has  duly  obtained  permission 
from 
the  Commissioner  before"
"terminating the employment of the respective workmen. However, the question that needs to"
"be  resolved  in  this  Application  is  whether  the  Commissioner  has  exercised  his  discretion"
"lawfully when granting such permission to the 3rd Respondent."
"At this stage, it is important to note that the requirement of holding an inquiry under section"
"12 of TEWA by the Commissioner, as he may consider necessary, emanates only when an"
"employer commits an offense identified by the TEWA. Section 2(3), spells out the offense for"
"which any person will be found guilty by failing to comply with any decision made by the"
"Commissioner under section 2(2). Similarly, section 7(1) and 14 also identifies two respective"
"offenses under the Act, whereas the offense of contempt3 is recognized in section 17B(1)(b)."
"There is no doubt that the Commissioner, in reference to the case at hand, has not conducted"
"any  inquiry  on  any  matter  emanated  under  the  aforesaid  sections  in  which  the  particular"
