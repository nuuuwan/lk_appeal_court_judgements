"offenses  have  been  identified.  In  other  words,  the  Commissioner  has  not  inquired  into  an"
"offense committed under the TEWA, either by the Petitioners or the 3rd Respondent."
"It is obvious that the word ‘inquiry’ has not been embodied anywhere in section 2 of TEWA"
"and instead specifies a requirement of affording the workman an opportunity to be heard.   I"
"do not intend here to examine whether affording an opportunity to be heard would eventually"
"amount to an inquiry or not and it is because such an aspect doesn’t necessarily fall within"
"the  ambit  of  this  judgement.  Anyhow,  it  can  be  assumed  that  there  is  a  clear  distinction"
"between the requirement of the workman being heard as per in section 2(2) and holding an"
"inquiry  upon  an  offense  committed  under  the  TEWA.  I  arrived  at  this  finding  due  to  the"
"discretionary nature of the power conferred on the Commissioner by the legislature when he"
"grants or refuses approval on an application seeking permission for termination. The power"
"bestowed on the Commissioner to make such a decision has been described as an ‘absolute"
"discretion’ of the Commissioner. It appears that the Parliament has given more prominence"
"to the absolute discretion of the Commissioner than holding a usual inquiry prior to granting"
"or refusing permission under section 2(2) and this point of view is further supported by the"
"special ouster clause introduced in section 2(2)(f)4. Anyhow, I do not intend to hold that the"
"Commissioner  should  not  follow  the  principles  of  natural  justice  when  he  exercises  his"
"absolute discretion under the said section as such discretion is absolutely not unfettered."
"In terms of section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance, the Court of Appeal, when exercising"
"its  powers  under  Article  140  of  the  Constitution  may  review  impugned  decisions  on  the"
"matters stipulated in section 22(a) and (b) of the said Ordinance, even in the presence of an"
"ouster clause. However, in terms of section 2(2)(f) any decision made by the Commissioner"
"under section 2(2) shall not be called into question even by way of a writ application. Anyhow,"
"in this regard, I need to draw my attention to the judgment of Mark Fernando J. (in agreement"
"with  Dheeraratne  J.  Wadugodapitiya  J.)  in  Atapattu  and  others  v.  People's  Bank  and  others"
