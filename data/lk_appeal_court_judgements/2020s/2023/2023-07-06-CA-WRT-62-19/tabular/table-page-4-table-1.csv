"sheet comprising of six charges. A formal disciplinary inquiry was conducted"
"following the issuance of the aforementioned charge sheet. The Petitioner was"
"found guilty of five out of the six charges."
"U
pon the conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry, the Commissioner General of"
"Motor Traffic, with the approval of the Secretary to the Ministry of Transport"
"(documented  as  'R1'),  terminated  the  Petitioner's  services  with  effect  from"
"23.11.2009."
"F
ollowing  this,  the  Petitioner  filed  an  appeal  (documented  as  'R2')  with  the"
"Public  Service  Commission  against 
the  aforementioned  Order 
of 
the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Motor  Traffic,  which  upheld 
the  decision 
to"
"terminate the Petitioner's services."
"A
t this juncture, the Petitioner had also sought relief from the Supreme Court"
"in  this  regard  in  case  no.  SC/FR/109/2012,  to  no  avail  whatsoever  as  the"
"Court  had  observed  that  the  Petitioner  was  able  to  suitably  seek  other"
"remedies available."
"T
he Petitioner being aggrieved by the Order of the Public Service Commission,"
"made an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) which by order"
"dated 11.09.2018 (marked ‘P12’) decided to reinstate the Petitioner along with"
"the imposition of certain other conditions. The order reads as follows:"
"""Therefore,  I  mitigate  the  punishment  of  dismissing  the  Appellant

"by the PSC by letter dated 12.02.2013 as foilows;"
"a.  Reinstate  the  Appellant  in  service  from  a  future  date  treating  the"
"period of absence as no pay leave"
"b.  Reduce his salary by û2 increments"
"c.  Severely  reprimand  him  to  be  extremely  vigilant  in  performing  his"
"duties in future; and"
"d.  Transfer  him  out  of  the  Department  on  Motor  Traffic  to  another"
"Department, where a vacancy exists.”"
"I
t is the view of this Court that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has"
"heard the appeal and observed the Petitioner to be guilty. However, opted to"
"mitigate  the  severity  of  the  dismissal  penalty  initially  imposed  by  both  the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Motor  Traffic  and  the  Public  Service  Commission"
"(PSC).  However,  this  mitigation  is  contingent  upon  the  specific  conditions"
"outlined 
in  points 
(a) 
to 
(d). 
It 
is 
important 
to  acknowledge 
that
