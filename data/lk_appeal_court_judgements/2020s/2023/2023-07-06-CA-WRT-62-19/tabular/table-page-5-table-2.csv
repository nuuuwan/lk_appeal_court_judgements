"Rajakaruna J. observed as follows:","",""
"","“Having  considered  the  jurisdiction  of  the  AAT,  now,  it  is  important  to",""
"","take into consideration the parameters of the jurisdiction of this Court in",""
"","regard to an order of AAT. In Kalamazoo Industries Limited vs. Ministry",""
"","of Labour and Vocational Training (1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 235, which was an",""
"","application for judicial review against an award made by an Industrial",""
"","Arbitrator. Although, the instant application deals with an order made by",""
"","the AAT, I am of the view that the findings of the said judgement which",""
"","distinguishes an “Appeal” and “Judicial Review” should be followed here",""
"","as  the  present  task  of  this  Court  is  to  review  an  order  of  AAT.  F.N.D.",""
"","Jayasuriya J. in the said judgement has held that at p.249;",""
"“","This court must keep prominently in forefront that it is exercising in this",""
"","instance  a  very  limited  jurisdiction  quite  distinct  from  the  exercise  of",""
"","appellate jurisdiction. Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an award",""
"","made by an arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an award only",""
"","if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction which he does",""

"","natural justice or pronounces an award which is eminently irrational or",""
"","unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality. The remedy by way of certiorari",""
"","cannot be made use of to correct errors or to substitute a correct order for",""
"","a wrong order and if the arbitrator's award was not set aside in whole",""
"or in part, it had to be allowed to stand unreversed.”","",""
"","“It is pertinent to refer to the principles laid down by Prof. H. W. R. Wade",""
"","on  “Administrative  Law”  12th  edition  at  pages  34  to  35  wherein  the",""

"","On  review,  the  question  is  lawful  or  unlawful  .  .  .  judicial  review  is  a",""
