"Discussing the chain of title is different from identifying whether the document is valid. For a deed"
"to be valid, the person who transfers it must have ownership. Discussing the ownership is not a"
"venture to discuss the title as in a civil case."
"W
hen perusing the learned Magistrateâ€™s order and submissions, the land in question was owned"
"by  Nuwara  Eliya  Tea  Company  .Under  the  Land  Reforms  Act,  it  was  acquired  by  the  Land"
"Reforms Commission. By Gazette No.815/10 dated 21.04.1994, this land was vested in the Sri"
"Lanka Plantation Corporation. The Sri Lanka Plantations Corporation leased a lease agreement to"
"Kelani Valley Plantations Limited."
"W
hen  writing  deed  No.5038,  the  Land  Reform  Commission  had  alienated  the  land  to  State"
"Plantation Corporation. In such a situation, if the Land Reform Commission wanted the land back,"
"he should act under Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Commission Law, whereby steps should"
"be taken to cancel the order of vesting on the Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation."
"T
he  learned  Magistrate  had  considered  the  legal  advice  given  by  the  Attorney  General  to  the"
"Minister in charge, which shows that the Land Reform Commission had no right to confer the land"
"on the third party in respect of lands vested with the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation."
"G
iving thought to the legal advice from the Attorney General, the learned Magistrate concluded"
"that the Land Reform Commission had executed the Deed when it had no right to do so. Therefore,"
"the Deed becomes an invalid document which will not come under a valid written authority."
"T
he learned Magistrate had considered the opinion of the Attorney General given to the Minister"
"in  charge of the subject  matter. No one can argue  that  considering the opinion of the Attorney"
"General, among other things, leads to a study of a chain of titles.   When considering the documents"
"placed  before  the  Magistrate,  he  had  carefully  considered  and  analyzed  the  documents  in  his"
"judgment. He concluded that the Deed was not a valid written document before the law."
