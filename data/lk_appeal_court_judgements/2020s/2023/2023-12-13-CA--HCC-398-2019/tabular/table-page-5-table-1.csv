"Before we analyze the evidence of the prosecution, we are mindful of the 3rd and"
"4th counts related to the possession and trafficking of morphine."
"According  to  the  evidence  of  Sandhya  Rajapaksha  PW08    Government    Analyst"
"has stated that heroin is made from opium. According to her, Opium is first converted to"
"morphine and thereafter subjected to acetylene to change to heroin, which is also known"
"as  Diacetyl Morphine."
"Due to the time factor, Diacetyl Morphine can turn back into Morphine. (Here 15"
"months  were  taken  to  analyse  the  production).  Therefore,  there  is  a  possibility  that  a"
"particular  production  would  have  been  changed  into  morphine  before  analyzing  the"
"production. In other words, 74mg of Morphine found by the Government Analyst would"
"have been reformed from heroin during the said time from the drugs recovered."
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  failed  to  consider  this  fact  and  convicted  the"
"Accused for Counts 3 and 4."
"Therefore, the conviction and sentence for the 3rd and 4th Count could not be sustained."
"The main ground urged by the Counsel for the Accused is that the prosecution had"
"failed to establish the chain of Custody, a break in the chain of production being sent to"
"the Government Analyst."
"According to the Prosecution, the accused was arrested on the 19th of August 2008"
"at  a  checkpoint  on  the  Dehiwala-Wellawatte  bridge  consequent  to  being  subjected  to  a"
"random search. The officers were able to recover the alleged 2.6 grams of Heroin from the"
"Accused."
"According to the prosecution, they found a green shopping bag in his Denim pocket"
"which contained 9 white shopping bags each of them containing 40 packets of heroin. This"
"amounts to 360 packets in total."
"After arresting the Accused PW01 along with  PW02 PC 68801 Saman took him to"
"the Wellawatte police station and was handed over to PW04  Jayathunga along with the"
"production."
"The  productions  have  been  separately  marked  as  PR  84/08  -  87/08.  Productions"
"have been purportedly sealed using PW01 and the Accused signature, but no police seal"
"has been used."
