"age."
"2.  The  deceased  was  identified  by  the  relatives  by  the  clothing  found"
"with the remains."
"3.  There was a single ante-mortem rib fracture which may have been"
"caused  by  the  blunt  force.  (This  could  have  been  caused  by  blow"
"from a fist)"
"4.  There  was  no  evidence  of  fatal  injuries  in  bones  to  establish  the"
