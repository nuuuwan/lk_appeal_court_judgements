"the owner. However, the Petitioner has failed to provide any document certified by"
"a Notary expressing the consent of the owner."
"It seems that the Petitioner’s claim is completely based on possession, and he relies"
"upon  the  judgement  of  case  No.  L/489/13  marked  A3.  Then  the  question  arises"
"whether  document  A3  could  be  considered  as  a  document  that  fulfilled  the"
"requirements as of the Rule No.13 of Exercise Notification No.902."
"The judgement in P3 pertains to an agreement that the Petitioner entered into to"
"occupy  a  premises.  However,  the  Petitioner  has  not  presented  said  agreement"
"before the court, so it cannot be determined whether the owner of the premises has"
"given  the  required  consent  as  per  Rule  No.13(b).  Further,  the  plain  reading  of"
"judgement A3 does not mention anything about the owner’s consent to carry out"
"the  business  on  the premises.  As  per  the  said  judgment,  the  Petitioner  has  been"
"granted only a limited right to possess the relevant premises to the extent of the"
"value  of  the  improvements  made  to  the  property.  Further,  the  occupation  under"
"document A3 is prone to disturbance (contrary to Rule 13(b)) as the Petitioner has"
"only the right of Jus Retentionis which means that they only have the right to retain"
"the  property  until  the  value  of  any  improvements  made  is  settled.  Therefore,  it"
"cannot be assumed that the proposed business can be carried out undisturbed in"
"the relevant premises."
"Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to establish that there is an arguable ground for"
"judicial review. In Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon v. Hon Attorney General & Others, CA"
"Writ /417/2021 decided on 03.11.2021, this court held that an application for judicial"
"review, at the stage of notice, demands that a court seized of an application for notice"
"should  consider  whether  the  case  is  suitable  for  full  investigation  at  a  hearing  at"
"which  all  parties  have  been  given  notice.  (see  R  V.  Secretary  of  State  for  Home"
"Department exp Begum (1990) COD 107, A.M. Chaminda Bandara Adikari v. Kapila"
"Adikari,  Chief 
Inspector  of  Police  CA/Writ  Application  216/2020  decided  on"
"25.08.2020 at p.140) The court will take into account the question of whether the"
"application  for  notice  relates  to  a  matter  that  ought  to  be  resolved  after  full"
"argument."
"This  court 
in  S.  Ravindra  Karunanayake  v.  Attorney  General  &  others  CA  Writ"
"63/2020- decided on 07.07.2020 has held “whether there is an arguable ground for"
