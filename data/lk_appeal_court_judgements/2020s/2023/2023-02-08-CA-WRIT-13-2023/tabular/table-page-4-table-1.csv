"I take the view that the said Clause 20 of the Rules empowers the Corporation to interdict"
"any employee upon an arrest of such employee even before conducting an inquiry as those"
"provisions do not prescribe any pre-condition to be fulfilled before such interdiction. That"
"is merely because when an employee is taken into custody by Police, by operation of such"
"Rules, he shall be regarded interdicted from service from the date of his detention. Thus,"
"in my view, the Corporation in such instances is not bound to be satisfied that there is a"
"prima facie case against the employee before interdicting him."
"For the purpose of challenging the said impugned Charge Sheet, the Petitioner takes the"
"same  stand  that  the  said  Charge  Sheet  has  been  issued  before  concluding  the  relevant"
"investigations. This Court has constantly decided that when the facts are in dispute and in"
"order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit or"
"at an inquiry where the parties would have ample opportunity to examine their witnesses."
"The Court would interfere in respect of such an inquiry only if the statutory procedure laid"
"down is insufficient to achieve justice or in an event such procedure has been blatantly"
"violated."
"The Petitioner still has ample opportunity to challenge any decision of the Respondents"
"after the investigations (including the domestic inquiry) are over. The interdiction will not"
"be a presumption of guilt and it cannot be considered as a punishment. The interdiction is"
"one of the foremost processes used upon an appropriate criteria to initiate investigations"
"in to allege misconducts. (See-W. G. Chamila vs. Urban Development Authority and others,"
"CA/WRIT/215/2022 decided on 26.10.2022)"
"In passing, I wish to highlight here the following passages by H. W. R. Wade and C. F."
"Forsyth under the topic of  ‘no evidence rule’ in ‘Administrative Law’ (11th Edition) Oxford"
