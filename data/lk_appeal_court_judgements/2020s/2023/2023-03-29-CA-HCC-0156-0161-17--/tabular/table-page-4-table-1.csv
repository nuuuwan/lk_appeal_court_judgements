"It was his evidence that upon inspecting the rear seat, he found a hand grenade"
"wrapped in a cloth on it."
"Thereafter, PW-01 had taken steps to arrest all the occupants of the vehicle on"
"the basis that they possessed an offensive weapon. This has led to the indictment"
"against them."
"It needs to be noted that although PW-01 speaks of finding the hand grenade on"
"the  rear  seat  in  his  examination  in  chief,  under  cross-examination,  he  also"
"speaks of finding it  above the rear seat  of the three-wheeler,  which leads to a"
"conclusion that it was found in the space behind the rear seat. However, PW-"
"02â€™s evidence was that it was found on the rear seat."
"It appears from the judgment, that the learned High Court Judge has convicted"
"all  the  six  appellants  on  the  basis  that  the  joint  possession  of  the  offensive"
"weapon is proven against them beyond reasonable doubt."
