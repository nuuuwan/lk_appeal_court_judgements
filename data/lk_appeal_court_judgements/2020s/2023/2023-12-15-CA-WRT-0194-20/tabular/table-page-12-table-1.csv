"Therefore, in determining whether to issue the writ of mandamus as prayed in"
"paragraph (b) of the Petition against the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the Court"
"must primarily ascertain whether the locations where the disputed flower pots"
"are positioned qualify as common spaces."
"The Petitioner has produced his title deed marked as ‘P 1’. As per ’P1’, the"
"Petitioner  is  identified  as  the  proprietor  of  condominium  unit  number  6,"
"bearing  assessment  No.  81  A  2/4,  located  on  the  2nd  floor,  as  depicted  in"
"condominium plan No. 9797 dated 12th December 1995, prepared by M.C.L.C"
"Perera, a Licensed Surveyor."
"The  3rd  Schedule  to  the  deed  defines  and  describe  the  statutory  common"
"elements  and  the  other  common  elements  delineated  and  described  in  the"
"condominium plan. The statutory common elements encompass the land and"
"building  including  the  open  spaces  appurtenant  to  condominium  property;"
"foundation,  columns,  girders,  beams,  supports,  main  wall  and  roof  of  the"
"building; installations for central services such as electricity, telephone, water"
"pipes etc."
"The other common elements are described as CE 1 to CE 17. It is clear that"
"some of those common elements are limited to certain units whereas only few"
"are common to all twelve units."
"Upon  consideration  of  those  common  elements  outlined  in  the  deed  it  is"
"apparent that CE 1, CE 4 and CE 9 are common to all twelve units, while the"
"rest  are  limited  to  certain  units.  As  previously  mentioned,  the  Petitioner's"
"condominium parcel is designated as unit No. 6. Consequently, the Petitioner"
"has entitlement to use common elements CE 1, CE 2, CE 3, CE 4, CE 6, CE9,"
"and CE 11 only."
"Among these common elements, CE 1 and CE 2 represent the land and ground"
"floor of the building, CE 4 denotes the stairway and lift, and CE 9 signifies"
"the stairway leading to the 4th floor. CE 6 and CE 11 encompass the corridor,"
"passage,  and  common  area  access  on  the  2nd  floor,  utilized  collectively  by"
"units 5, 6, 7, and 8 on that floor. Notably, CE 11 specifically designates the"
"terrace exclusively used for the Petitioner's unit 6 on the 2nd floor."
"However, according to the description of common elements in the deed ('P1'),"
"the Petitioner does not hold the right to use any common elements on the 3rd"
"floor. The common elements allocated to the 3rd floor are marked as CE 7, CE"
"12, CE 13, CE 14, and CE 15. As per the Petitioner's title deed ('P 1'), none of"
"these common elements on the 3rd floor fall within the Petitioner's entitlement."
