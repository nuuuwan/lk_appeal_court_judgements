"Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmorbd de Poigns5.  Although this case deals"
"with a writ of prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable to all cases"
"of writs or injunctions. In this case, a Divisional Court without dealing with"
"the merits of the case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had"
"suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court"
"of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a"
"suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it"
"was justified in refusing a writ of prohibition without going into the merits of"
"the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful"
"disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go into the merits of"
"the application, but will dismiss it without further examination’.  (emphasis"

"(NIFNE) and others6 it was observed that,"
"‘When a litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters"

"360  the  Court highlighted  this  contractual  obligation  which a  party  enters"
"into with the Court, requiring the need to disclose uberrima fides and disclose"
"all material facts fully and frankly to Court. Any party who misleads Court,"
"misrepresents facts to Court or utters falsehood in Court will not be entitled"
"to obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established proposition of law, since"
"Courts expect a party seeking relief to be frank and open with the Court. This"
"principle  has  been  applied  even  in  an  application  that  has  been  made  to"
"challenge a decision made without jurisdiction. Further, Court will not go into"
"the merits of the case in such situations7. Vide Rex v. Kensington Income Tax"
"Commissioners; Princess Edmond De Polignac Ex-Parte - (1917) 1 KB 4868."
"…
 In the result,[1] on both these aforesaid points, I hold that the petitioner"
"has failed to make a full and frank disclosure of all material facts. Hence, by"
"this conduct the petitioner had violated his contractual obligation to Court to"
