"""Hence  to  determine  the  nature  of  the  goodwill  in  any  given  case,  it  is"
"necessary  to  consider  the  type  of  business  and  the  type  of  customer"
"which  such  a  business 
is 
inherently 
likely 
to  attract  as  well  as 
the"
"surrounding circumstances.... The goodwill of a business is a composite"
"thing  referable  in  part  to  its  locality,  in  part  to  the  way  in  which  it  is"
"conducted and the personality of those who conduct it, and in part to the"
"likelihood  of  competition,  many  customers  being  no  doubt  actuated  by"
"mixed motives in conferring their custom."""
"[50]  In  M/SS.C.  Cambatta  and  Co.  Private  Ltd.  vs.  Commissioner  of  Excess"
"Profits Tax, Bombay,961 AIR 1010, the Indian Supreme Court stated:"
"“It will thus be seen that the goodwill of a business depends upon a variety"
"of circumstances or a combination of them. The location, the service, the"
"standing of the business, the honesty of those who run it, and the lack of"
"competition  and  many  other 
factors  go 
individually 
it,  and  the  lack  of"
"competition and many other factors go individually or together to make up"
"the  goodwill,  though  locality  always  plays  a  considerable  part.  Shift  the"
"locality,  and  the  goodwill  may  be  lost.  At  the  same  time,  locality  is  not"
"everything.  The  power  to  attract  custom  depends  on  one  or  more  of  the"
"other 
factors  as  well. 
In 
the  case  of  a 
theatre  or  restaurant,  what 
is"
"catered, how the service is run and what the competition is, contribute also"
"to the goodwill” (paragraph 15)."
"[51] It is not in dispute that the Appellant as a finance company was, inter alia,"
"carrying on the business of a pawnbroker and lending money on the pledge of"
"the  article.  It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  pawning  business  was  the  intangible"
"asset  of  the  appellant  and  the  appellant  carried  on  the  pawning  business"
"using  the  brand  “LOLC  Ransavi”  and  using  the  initial  equity  via  investments"
"as integral part of its business operations. The said brand is associated with"
"its  business  and  goodwill  for  future  economic  benefit  and  long-lasting  value"
"and therefore, it is a capital asset of the Appellant."
"[52] There is no material whatsoever, to show that the original intention of the"
"appellant to acquire the pawning business using initial equity via investments"
"was  changed,  or 
that 
the  original 
intention 
from  one  of 
investment  was"
"changed to a profit-making scheme by reselling it at a profit in the course of"
"trade or business so as to make it profit-making business."
"[53] On the scrutiny of the facts of the case, including the case flow statement,"
"it  is  revealed  that  during  the  year  of  assessment,  the  appellant  had  sold  its"
"total  pawning  portfolio  and  goodwill  to  the  value  of  Rs.  1,790,641,246/-  and"
"that the profit made from  the  sale  of  pawning  portfolio  and  goodwill  was  Rs."
"610,000,000/- (p. 24 of the TAC brief). It had been calculated in the following"
"manner:"
