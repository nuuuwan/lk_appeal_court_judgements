"""The  goodwill  of  a  business  is  the  benefit  which  arises  from  its  having"
"been  carried  on  for  some  time  in  a  particular  house,  or  by  a  particular"
"person or firm, or from the use of a particular trademark or trade name."""
"[46]  The  question  whether  a  receipt  derived  from 
the  sale  of  goodwill 
is"
"taxable or not depends upon the circumstances and facts of each case. Any"
"amount  received  in  respect  of  the  sale  of  the  goodwill  of  a  business,  is  a"
"receipt of a capital nature and is not taxable provided that the seller originally"
"purchased  the  business  in  order  to  derive  an  income  from  the  carrying  on"
"thereof  and  not  for  the  purpose  of  resale  at  a  profit  (Silke  on  South  African"
"Income  Tax  93rd  Ed.    P  54).  As  long  as  the  goodwill  is  a  fixed  amount,  it"
"partakes  of  the  nature  of  capital,  irrespective  of  whether  it  is  one  sum  or  in"
"periodic instalments (Ibid)"
"[47] However, where it is clear from the terms of an agreement that a payment"
"is not received for the sale of goodwill but merely for the right of use thereof"
"for a certain period on the expiration of which the goodwill is to revert to the"
"owner, 
then  such  payment 
is 
in 
the  nature  of 
income  (I.T.C.  No.  66,  2"
"S.A.T.C. 259). Court decisions have suggested that goodwill can be classified"
"as  a  capital  asset.

"Margarin,  Ltd.  (3),  Lord  Macnaghten  at  pp.  223  and  224  made  the  following"
"observations:"
"""What  is  goodwill?  It  is  a  thing  very  easy  to  describe,  very  difficult  to"
"define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and"
"connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom."
"It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from a"
"new  business  at  its  first  start......  if  there  is one  attribute  common  to  all"
"cases  of  goodwill 
it 
is 
the  attribute  of 
locality.  For  goodwill  has  no"
"independent existence. It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to"
"a  business.  Destroy  the  business,  and  the  goodwill  perishes  with  it,"
"though  elements  remain  which  may  perhaps  be  gathered  up  and  be"
"revived again."""

"""My  opinion

that  while 
it  cannot  be  said

"necessarily inseparable from the premises or to have no separate value,"

"whatever its value may be, should be treated as an enhancement of the"
