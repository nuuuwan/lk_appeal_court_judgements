"any document to substantiate his finding except  to refer to the words “profits"
"on sale” in the statement of accounts of the Appellant."
"[62] It is true that the sale of the pawned article is occasioned by the action of"
"the  Pawn-broker  where  the  pawner  defaults  the  payment  and  discharges  of"
"loan  or  redemption  (Karnataka  Pawn  Brokers  Assn.  and  Others  v  State  of"
"Karnataka and Others (S.C. decided on 29.10.1998). p/ 18). The pawner who"
"pledges  the  article  with 
the 
licensed  pawnbroker,  not  only  parts  with 
the"
"possession of the pledged article in favour of the pawn-broker, but by virtue of"
"such pledge parts with the rights he held to sell the pledged article in case of"
"default of payment and discharge of loan or redemption of the article pledged"
"within  the  time  stipulated  by  the  contract  or  by  the  provisions  of  the  Pawn"
"Brokering  Act.  (Kandula  Radhakrishna  Rao  and  Others  v  The  Province  of"
"Madras, 2 STC 121)."
"[63]  The  question  of  sale  of  gold  arises  by  the  default  of  the  pawner  in"
"redeeming the pawned articles and therefore, it is incorrect to state that they"
"are  engaged  in  the  business  of  buying  and  selling  property  contrary  to  the"
"contract 
or 
other 
statutory 
provisions

the  Pawn  Brokering  Act"

"[64]  It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  Appellant  who  acquired  gold  stocks  for  the"
"purpose of holding them as an investment and carrying on pawning business"
"with the intention of capital appreciation in the course of its pawning business."
"The  enhanced  value  of  the  gold  stocks  of  the  Appellant  can  be  regarded  as"
"fixed  capital  assets.  The  Appellant  held  its  gold  stocks  for  the  purpose  of"
"pawning  business  for  some  time  as  an  investment  and  disposed  of  them"
"during the year of assessment for Rs. 50,222,075/-."
"[65] The gold investment made by the Appellant in gold stocks for its pawning"
"business does not constitute its stock-in-trade but represents fixed assets and"
"the profit derived from the realization of the sale of gold  stocks thus, attracts"
"capital gain, irrespective of whether it is a short-term capital gain. It would not,"
"in  my  view,  attract  income  tax  as  “profits  and  income”  or  “profit” or  “income”"
"under section 3(a) of the IRA 2006."
"Is  the  gain  or  profit  derived  from  the  Treasury  Bonds  in  the  nature  of"
"capital gain or a trading profit?"
"[66]  The  Appellant’s  contention 
is 
that 
the  Appellant 
invested 
in 
treasury"
"bonds,  which  are  held  by  the  company  for  the  purpose  of  earning  interest"
"income  and  the  gain  arising  from  the  sale  of  treasury  bonds  was  a  non-"
"recurring transaction. The Appellant submitted that it invested its excess funds"
"in  the  treasury  bonds  with  a  view  to  earn  interest  income  over  a  period  of"
