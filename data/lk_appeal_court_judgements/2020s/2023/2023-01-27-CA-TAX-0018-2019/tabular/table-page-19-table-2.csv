"this  contention  is untenable  and  does  not  hold  any  validity  or  credibility"
"as there is no provision in the Act prohibiting the transaction between two"
"related parties…”."
"[57] It is manifest that the Appellant had sold its intangible capital asset of the"
"pawning portfolio (brand and goodwill) to LOLC Micro Credit Ltd   in relation to"
"the  assessment  made  against  LOLC  Micro  Credit  Ltd.  On  a  perusal  of  the"
"statement  of  accounts  or  the  documents  filed  on  record  reveals 
that  the"
"Appellant  being  involved  in  the  business  of  pawn  brokering  had  made  an"
"investment and sold the entire pawning business to LOLC Micro Credit Ltd."
"[58] A perusal of the statement of accounts further reveals that the disposal of"
"the  brand  and  goodwill  had  been  done  by 
the  company  as  an 
isolated"
"transaction  not  in  the  course  of  the  Appellant’s  ordinary  business  of  profit-"
"making  scheme.  The 
intention  and  motive  behind 
the 
transaction  do  not"
"appear to be one of the profit-making such as buying and selling the pawning"
"portfolio. 
In  the  present  case, 
the  statement  of  accounts  or  documentary"
"evidence in the present case, however, does not support a conclusion that the"
"object of the transaction was to buy and sell the intangible brand and goodwill"
"of the Appellant."
"[59] 
In 
the  circumstances, 
the  TAC  was  wrong,  without 
identifying 
the"
"character  and  the  circumstances  of  the  transaction  in  holding  that  after  the"
"abolition of the capital gain, any gain or profit received by the appellant for the"
"sale of brand should be considered as income falling under section 3(a) of the"
"IRA 2006."
"Is  the  gain  or  profit  derived  from  the  sale  of  gold  investment  in  the"
"nature of capital gain or a trading profit?"
"[60]  The  question  whether  such  gain  derived 
from 
the  sale  of  pawning"
"business is taxable or not also depends upon the nature and character of the"
"transaction. The answer to this question will decide whether the profit it made"
"from the sale constitutes an ordinary trading income or capital gain."
"[61] The assessor has categorized the sale of gold investment in a sum of Rs."
"50,222,075/-  as  a  profit  on  the  basis that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  explain"
"under which section of the IRA 2006, the Appellant claimed the exemption of"
"gain derived from the sale of gold investment. The  CGIR has taken the view"
"that  as  the  Appellant was  engaged  in  the  finance  business  which  deals  with"
"pawning  and  trading  etc.,  the  particular  gain  or  profit  could  be  treated  as"
"“profits and income” earned in the business of a finance company and hence,"
"the Appellant is liable for income tax. The CGIR has, however, not referred to"
