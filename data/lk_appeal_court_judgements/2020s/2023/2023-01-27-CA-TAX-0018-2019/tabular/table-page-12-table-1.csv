"[29]  On 
the  other  hand,  Revenue 
(income) 
in  a  company 
is  what 
that"
"company  receives 
from 
the  normal  business  operations 
from 
the  sale  of"
"goods  or  services  less  operating  expenses  or  sale  proceeds.  However,  a"
"revenue receipt does not create a liability or reduces the assets of a company"
"and it is always a recurring in nature and earned during the normal course of"
"business.  It  affects  the  profits  or  losses  of  a  business  (supra).  Examples  of"
"revenue  receipts  include  revenue  earned  by  selling  out  products  or  services"
"provided,  discounts 
received 
from  vendors, 
interest, 
rent  and  dividends"
"received services, etc. (supra)."
"[30]  The  key  differences  between  a  capital  receipt  and  a  revenue  receipt"
"based on the above-mentioned sources can be summarized as follows:"
"1.  a capital receipt is non-recurring in nature whereas a revenue receipt is"
"recurring in nature;"
"2.  a capital receipt either reduces the companyâ€™s assets or creates liability"
"for the company whereas a revenue receipt will not create such liability"
"or reduces its assets;"
"3.  a  capital  asset  is  usually  fixed  and  non-routine  whereas  a  revenue"
"receipt is routine and not fixed;"
"4.  a  capital  asset  is  derived  from  a  non-operational  source  whereas  a"
"revenue receipt is derived from operational sources;"
"5.  a  capital asset  will not  be used  to  distribute profits  whereas a  revenue"
"receipt  will  be  used  to  distribute  profits  after  deducting  the  expenses"
"incurred to earn the revenue;"
"6.  a  capital  receipt  is  found  usually  in  the  balance  sheet  of  a  company"
"whereas  the  revenue  receipt  is  found  in  the  income  statement  of  a"
"company."
"Distinction  between  a  profit  or  gain  in  the  nature  of  capital  gain  and"
"adventure in the nature of trade- guidelines from judicial authorities"
"[31]  The  first  question  to  be  asked  about  any  receipt  is,  this:  is  it  a  trading"
"receipt  or 
is 
it  a  capital  receipt?  There 
is,  however,  no 
infallible 
test 
for"
"deciding  whether  a  particular  receipt  is  capital  or  trading  income.  Now  the"
"question  is  how  to  distinguish  the  profits  derived  by  the  Appellant  from  the"
"sale  of  pawning  portfolio,  gold 
investment  and  government  bonds  and"
"categorize them either as a capital gain or a trading profit."
"[32]  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  character  and  the  circumstances  of  the"
"particular  transaction  will  indicate  with  a  definiteness  that  certain  profits  are"
"profits  of  an  adventure  in  the  nature  of  trade  or  are  capital  accretions  to  an"
"investment (Balaratnam, supra). Income Tax, Wealth Tax and Gifts Tax, 1979"
"(p.  132).  For  that  purpose,  all  the  relevant  facts  attaching  to  the  transaction"
