"[21] Lord Buckmaster in  Leeming v. Jones (H. M. Inspector of  Taxes) [1930]"
"UKHL TC15 again emphasizes at p. 357, the fact that: -"
"""… an accretion to capital does not become income merely because the"
"original capital was invested in the hope and expectation that it would rise"
"in value; if it does so rise, its realisation does not make it income."""
"[22] Lord Viscount Dunedin at page 359, emphasized the distinction between"
"an isolated transaction and a transaction which is in the nature of a business"
"having  quoted  the  well-known  words  of  Lord  Machination  in  the  Attorney-"
"General v. London Country Council4 T.C. 265 at p. 293 ""that income-tax was"
"a tax on income"" and that capital accretion cannot constitute ""profits or gains"""
"within  the  meaning  of  the Income-tax  Act.  In  Californian  Copper  Syndicate"
"(Limited and Reduced) v. Harris, decided on (1904) 5 T.C. 159 at page 165,"
"Lord Justice Clerk lucidly sums up a well settled principle as follows: -"
"""...Where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it,  and"
"obtains  a  greater  price 
for 
it 
than  he  originally  acquired 
it  at, 
the"
"enhanced  price  is  not  profit  in  the  sense  of  Schedule  D  of  the  Income"
"Tax  Act  of  1842  assessable 
to 
income-tax.  But 
it 
is  equally  well"
"established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion"
"of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a"
"realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the"
"carrying on, or carrying out, of a business."""
"[23] The  distinction between  the  capital and income  was further emphasised"
"in  Thornhill  v.  The  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax,  Reports  of  Ceylon  Tax"
"Cases Vol. 1. The main question in Thornhill v. The Commissioner of Income"
"Tax,  (supra)  was  whether  the  sum  of  Rs.  19,622.19  was  received  by  the"
"Appellant 
in 
respect  of  his  estate  under 
the  Tea  and  Rubber  Control"
"Ordinance (Chapter 188) as tea and rubber coupons to which he was entitled"
"under 
the  said  Ordinance,  and 
realised  by 
the  sale  of 
these  coupons"
"constituted profit or income within the meaning of Section 6 (1) (a) or 6 (1) (b),"
"or whether it represented the realisation of capital."
"[
24]  Soertsz,  J.  in  that  case  referred  to  the  statement  made  in  Tennant  v."
"Smith  (1892)  A.C.  150 
that  “for 
income  tax  purposes, 
‘income’  “must  be"
"money  or  something  capable  of  being  turned  into  money”.  Soertsz,  J.  held"
"however,  that  this  statement  needs  qualification  as  all  money  and  all  things"
"capable  of  being 
turned 
into  money  are  not  necessarily  “income” 
for 
tax"
"purposes.  Soertsz,  J.  referred 
to  the  following  essential  characteristics  of"
"“income” identified by Cunningham and Dowland in their Treatise on Land and"
"Income  Tax  and  Practice,  at  p.  128  and  held  that  these  essential  elements"
"provide  adequate  tests  by  which  to  ascertain  whether  a  particular  receipt  is"
"“income” or not within the meaning of the Income Tax Ordinance:"
