"must  be  considered  and 
the 
total 
impression  examined 
to  come 
to 
the"
"conclusion  as to the  source under which  the  resulting  profits  are assessable"
"(Supra). 
The 
decided 
cases 
however, 
provide 
some 
guidelines 
in"
"differentiating whether a particular profit or gain (receipt) is in the nature of a"
"capital gain or a trading profit."
"Intention"
"[33] One of the most important tests that laid down by the courts, where the"
"receipt consists of the realized proceeds of an asset which has been disposed"
"of, is the intention with which the asset was acquired. The application of this"
"test 
involves  a  consideration  of  all 
the  circumstances  surrounding 
the"
"acquisition of and the method with the particular asset. (Silke on South African"
"Income  3rd  Ed.  P.  27).  For  example,  if  a  lawyer  sells  of  his  law  books,  the"
"proceeds  would  be  of  a  capital  nature  since 
the  books  were  originally"
"acquired not for the purpose of resale at a profit but to hold as a fixed capital"
"asset  in  his  practice.  (supra).  On  the  other  hand,  the  profits  derived  by  a"
"bookseller from the sale of books would be an income since the books were"
"acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit (supra)."
"[34]  This  proposition  can  be  well  illustrated  from  the  South  African  case  of"
"Overseas Trust Corporation Ltd v C.I.R. 1926 A.D. 444, where it was held that"
"if  in  the  course  of  a  scheme  for  profit  making,  an  asset  is  acquired  for  the"
"purpose of resale at a profit, the proceeds derived from the sale of such asset"
"constitute  revenue  derived  from  capital  productivity  employed  to  earn  such"
"revenue,  and  are  of  an  income  nature.  On  the  other  hand,  if  an  asset  is"
"acquired to produce an income in the form of rent or dividends and not for the"
"purpose of resale at a profit, the proceeds derived from a subsequent disposal"
"of such asset are of a capital nature (supra). ."
"Change of intention"
"[35] On the other hand, the position may be different in regard to the question"
"whether  the  receipt  is  of  a  capital  nature  or  income  nature,  when  there  is  a"
"change  of  intention  on  the  part  of  the  assessee  in  regard  to  the  use  of  a"
"particular asset acquired by the assessee. Thus, where an original intention of"
"buying such property for resale at a profit may be changed into one to hold it"
"as  an  investment,  and  any  proceeds  derived  from  a  subsequent  resale  of"
"such  property  would  be  a  capital  nature  as 
the  owner  has  changed  his"
"intention from one of profit-making scheme into one of investment."
"[36] On the other hand, if an original intention of acquiring property was not for"
"resale at a profit but for investment, may be changed to one of carrying out a"
"scheme  of  profit-making,  and  any  proceeds 
from  subsequent  sale  of  the"
