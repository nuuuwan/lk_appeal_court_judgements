"property  would  be  a  trading  income  as  the  owner  has  changed  his  intention"
"from one of investment to a profit-making scheme."
"Fixed capital and floating capital"
"[37]  The  other  test  appears  to  be  the  fixed  capital  versus  floating  capital  in"
"that a fixed capital means property which the owner of the business wishes to"
"keep 
in  his  own  possession  as  a  means  of  earning  continuous  profits,"
"whereas the floating capital is property he means to turn into profits by selling"
"at 
the  earliest  possible  moment  (Silke  on  South  African 
Income,  supra),"
"Accordingly,  receipts  derived  from the  sale of fixed  capital,  where  that  is not"
"the business carried on, would be receipts of a capital nature (C.I.R. George"
"Forest  Timber  Co.  Ltd  (1924)  A.D.  516).  This  proposition  can  be  illustrated"
"from  the  following  examples.    A  delivery  van  is  part  of  the  fixed  capital  of  a"
"bakery  and  the  proceeds  resulting  from  the  sale  of  the  van  would  be  capital"
"receipts whereas the bread in the bakery is part of the floating capital and its"
"sale to the consumer would be a trading profit (supra)."
"[38] In the South African case of C.I.R. v. Niko (1940) A.D. 416, the question"
"was whether an amount realized for stock-in-trade when a business is sold is"
"a  receipt  of  a  capital  nature  or  income  nature.  It  was  held  that  the  stock-in-"
"trade which was acquired and owned by Niko to resell at a profit represented"
"his floating capital and the proceeds resulting from a sale of the stock-in-trade"
"form part of Niko’s “gross income”."
"Isolated transactions"
"[39]  Any  frequency  or  isolated 
transaction  which  is  not  carried  on  in  the"
"course of business is not necessarily free from income tax but such frequency"
"transaction not in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business may provide"
"a  guide  in  determining  whether  a  transaction  is  one  on  capital  or  revenue"
"nature  (Silke  on  South  African  Income,  p.  32).  The  question  whether  an"
"isolated transaction not in the course of business is in the nature of a capital"
"or  revenue  depends  on  the  profit-making  intention  behind  the  transaction"
"(supra, p. 32)."
"[40]  Accordingly,  where  a  person  buys  a  property  with 
the 
intention  of"
"reselling it at a profit and any such profit made would be taxable even though"
"such  person  does  not  ordinarily  carry  on  any  business  of  buying  and  selling"
"property  and  even  though  the  transaction may  be  an  isolated one  (supra,  p."
"32).  The 
test 
is 
that 
if 
the  profit  arises  out  of 
trading, 
it 
is 
taxable"
"notwithstanding the fact that the transaction is one of isolated one (Stephen v."
"C.I.R. (1919) W.L.D. 1). This means that the fact that a transaction is isolated"
"is not decisive to decide whether the receipt is the capital or income and what"
