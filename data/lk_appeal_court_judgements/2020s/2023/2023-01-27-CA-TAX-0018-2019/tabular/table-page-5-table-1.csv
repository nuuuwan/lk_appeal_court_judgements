"sale  of  treasury  bonds  should  be  considered  as  income  falling  under"
"section 3(a) of the IRA 2006;"
"2.  The TAC erred in not considering that a capital gain is not a receipt that"
"falls within “profits and income” as defined in section 3 of the IRA 2006,"
"and as such capital gain arising from the sale of brand, gold investment"
"and  sale  of  treasury  bonds  is  not  liable  to  income  tax  under  the  IRA"
"2006;"
"3.  The TAC erred in not considering that it is only  a profit that falls within"
"section 3  of  the  IRA  2006  that  is chargeable  with  income  tax,  and it  is"
"not every profit of a company that is liable for income tax;"
"4.  The  TAC  failed  to  consider  that  a  capital  gain  arising  after  31.03.2002"
"should not be liable to income tax as the capital gain was not included"
"within the definition of “profits and income” or “profits” or “income” in the"
"IRA 2006, which applied to the year of assessment 2010/2011 relevant"
"to this appeal;"
"5.  The  TAC  failed  to  consider  that  the  sale  of  the  pawning  portfolio  and"
"gold investment is a capital gain, and the profit generated from the sale"
"of such investment is not income under section 3(a) of the IRA 2006;"
"6.  The TAC failed to consider that the treasury bonds are financial assets"
"of 
the  Appellant  and 
the  Appellant 
invested 
in  purchasing 
treasury"
"bonds  for  earning  an  income  from  the  interest  derived  from  them,  and"
"therefore, the TAC failed to consider that the Appellant was not involved"
"in  buying  and  selling 
treasury  bonds 
in 
the  course  of 
its  business"
"activities."
"[8]  On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Milinda  Gunatilleke  submitted  that  the  TAC  was"
"correct 
in  dismissing 
the  appeal 
filed  by 
the  Appellant 
for 
the 
following"
"reasons:"
"1.  The profits received from the sale of brand, gold and treasury bonds fall"
"within 
the  ambit  of 
trading  profit  which 
is 
liable 
to 
tax,  and 
in 
the"
"absence of an express exemption of capital gain from the application of"
"the  charging  section,  the  profits  earned  from  the  sale  of  brand,  gold"
"investment  and 
treasury  bonds  will  become 
liable 
to 
tax  as 
trading"
"income or trading profits under section 3(a) of the IRA 2006;"
"2.  The  Appellant’s  Accountants  Ernst  &  Young  has  classified  the  income"
"from  the  sale  of  the  pawning  brand  as  “profits”  on  pawning  portfolio"
"trading  profits  are  not 
sale”  and  not  as  a  capital  gain,  and  where"
"expressly exempted from income tax, the profits derived from the sale of"
"brand, gold investment and treasury bonds become chargeable to tax;"
