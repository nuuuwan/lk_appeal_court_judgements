"its  properties  were  vested  with  the  board  of  trustees,  to  which  the"
"petitioners had no connection. In the circumstances, it appears that the"
"petitioners have misrepresented the material facts to this court in the"
"aforesaid  manner  in  order  to  create  a  link  to  the  trusteeship  of  the"
"public  trust.  Without  creating  such  a  link,  the  petitioners  have  no"
"acceptable basis to state that one of them is the manageress of the said"
"Ayurveda Hospital at present, another petitioner is the chief occupant"
"of the premises at present, and after the death of Dr. Umakanthan, his"
"wife,  the  3rd  petitioner,  succeeded  to  the  deceased  personâ€™s  rights  as"
"trustee and manager of the said public trust."
