"The  vital  matter  that  arises  from  the  said  document  marked  “X”  was"
"that  it  was  only  a  proposed  scheme  of  management  tendered  to  the"
"district  court  of  Jaffna  on  behalf  of  the  defendants.  However,  it  is"
"evident from the  order of  the district court, dated 29.04.1983 (one of"
"the documents pertaining to R-1), that Dr. A Umakanthan has not been"
"appointed as a member of the Board of Trustees by the said order of the"
"district court and some other seven persons have been appointed as the"
"board of trustees. Dr. A Umakanthan’s name had only been mentioned"
"in the proposed scheme of management submitted by the defendants."
"Therefore,  the  assertion  of  the  petitioners  that  Dr.  Umakanthan  was"
"appointed as the Chief Trustee and Manager of the ""Nayanmarkaddu"
"Ayurveda Vaidyasalai"" in the petition is a total misrepresentation of the"
"facts,  as  contended  by  the  learned  state  counsel  because  the  district"
"court  did  not  appoint  Dr.  Umakanthan  as  a  member  of  the  board  of"
"trustees."
