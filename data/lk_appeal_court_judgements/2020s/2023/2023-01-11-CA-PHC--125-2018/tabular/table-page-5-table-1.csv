"Order. As such, the learned Magistrate had correctly ordered to have the boundaries"
"of the access roadway as before, prior to the dispute between parties arose."
"Therefore, it clearly shows that the learned Magistrate had made the Order on the"
"assumption that the 1st Respondent-Respondent is entitled to use the disputed road"
"to her land."
"It is relevant to note that  the impugned Order of the Magistrate was executed on"
"11.07.2016.  The  learned  Magistrate  in  her  Order  dated  01.06.2016  had  directed"
"parties to adjudicate the matter in a civil forum. However, it was not disclosed by"
"either party that a civil case had been instituted in respect of the impugned dispute"
"in this matter."
"The revisionary jurisdiction can be exercised if there is no other remedy available."
"Since the Petitioner-Appellant had not resorted to the available remedy, revision is"
"not available to the Petitioner-Appellant."
"Therefore,  in  view  of  the  aforesaid  reasons,  it  is  observable  that  there  is  no"
"miscarriage of justice or any injustice caused to the Petitioner-Appellant to invoke"
"the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court. Moreover, the Petitioner-"
"Appellant had not disclosed that exceptional circumstances warrant to invoke the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court."
"As such, the learned High Court Judge had dismissed the revision application of the"
"Petitioner-Appellant.  Thus,  we  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  Order  dated"
"10.07.2018 of the learned High Court Judge and the Order dated 01.06.2016 of the"
"learned Magistrate."
"Hence, the appeal is dismissed with tax cost."
