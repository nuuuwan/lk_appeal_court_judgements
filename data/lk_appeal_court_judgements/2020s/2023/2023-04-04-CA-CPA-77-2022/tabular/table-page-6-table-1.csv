"2.  Interpretation of Section 13 of the CIABOC Act."
"Section 13 of the CIABOC Act stipulates the discretionary  power vested  within"
"the  Commission 
to  determine  whether 
to  obtain 
the  service  of  an  officer"
"authorized  by 
the 
commission  or  an  attorney-at-law  authorized  by 
the"
"commission in  order  to  conduct  the  prosecution  on  behalf  of  the  Commission."
"Section 13 delineates two categories of persons who could be authorized by the"
"Commission to conduct a prosecution on behalf of the Commission, namely: An"
"Officer  of  the  Commission  authorized  by  the  Commission;  An  attorney-at-law"
"specially authorized by the Commission."
"An  officer  of  the  Attorney  General’s  Department  retained  for  the  purpose  of"
"prosecuting a case by the Commission would fall under the second category, i.e.,"
"an attorney-at-law specially authorized by the Commission. This reinforces the"
"above discussed concept of discretion vested with the Commission to enlist an"
"appropriate prosecutor to for the case at hand in furtherance of justice. In such"
"a situation, the said counsel is proceeding on the directions and instruction of"
"the Commission as opposed to that of the Attorney General. This is most clear in"
"the event that an indictment is withdrawn during the proceedings of a bribery"
"case.  In  such  an  instance,  the  officer  of  the  Attorney  General’s  Department"
"appearing  on  behalf  of  the  Commission  cannot  unilaterally  initiate  such  a"
"withdrawal. Such withdrawal must be sanctioned by the Commission. Moreover,"
"in the event of a conflict of interest, the AG or any other party cannot appear on"
"behalf  of  the  Commission  related  to  that  particular  matter  and  when  such  an"
"event  transpires,  the  AG  or  any  other  Officer  appearing  on  behalf  of  the"
"Commission is required to inform of such a conflict of interest to the Commission"
"and abstain from participating in that matter."
"As  such,  the  Commission  may  decide  to  opt 
for  an  officer  outside  of  the"
"Commission if, inter alia:"
