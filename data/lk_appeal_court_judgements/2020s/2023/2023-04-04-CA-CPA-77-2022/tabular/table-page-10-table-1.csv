"6.  The  precedent  set  by  Land  Reform  Commission  v.  Grand  Central"
"Limited"
"In  the  landmark  judgment  of  Land  Reform  Commission  v.  Grand  Central"
"Limited [1981] 2 Sri. L.R. 147 (CA), [1981] 1 Sri. L.R. 250 (SC) it was established"
"that the Attorney General cannot appear in his private capacity viz appearing as"
"a private counsel and can only appear in his official capacity as Attorney General."
"At the Supreme Court, it was iterated by His Lordship Chief Justice Samarakoon"
"Q.C.  that,"
"“………. the Attorney-General of his Country is the leader of the Bar and the highest"
"Legal Officer of the State. As Attorney-General he has a duty to Court, to the State"
"and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly independent and to act impartially"
"with the sole object of establishing the truth. It is for that reason that all Courts in"
"this Island request the appearance of the Attorney- General as amicus curiae when"
"the Court requires assistance, which assistance has in the past been readily given."
"That image will certainly be tarnished if he takes part in private litigation arising"
"out of private disputes. I cannot but agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal"
"that there are constraints on the Attorney-General engaging in private practice in"
"the civil law as well as the criminal law. It is regrettable that the State has sought"
"to  act  counter  to  tradition,  (prudence  and  propriety)  in  granting  the  Attorney-"
"General  and  his  law  officers  the  right  of  private  practice.  Justice  is  the  loser"
"thereby. No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love"
"the  other:  or  he  will  hold  to  one  and  despise  the  other.  No  Attorney-General  can"
"serve both State and private litigant”."
"This Court believes that the instant matter can be clearly distinguished with the"
"circumstances of the Land Reform Commission matter. In the above case when"
"the then Attorney General S. Pasupathi was inquired as to in which capacity he"
"appeared, he stated that he appeared in his private capacity of an Attorney-at-"
"Law.  The  petitioners  have  mistaken  the  ratio  of  these lines of  judgment which"
"barred  the  Attorney  General  from  appearing  in  his  personal  capacity.  It  is"
"unambiguously  well  settled  law  that  the  Attorney  General  cannot  appear  for"
"private  parties;  however,  the  persistent  matter  discussed  at  above  cases  was"
