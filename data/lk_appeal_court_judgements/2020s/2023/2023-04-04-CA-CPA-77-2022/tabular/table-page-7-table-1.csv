The unavailability of the officers of the Commission to entrust the matter"
"at hand due to their engagement in another matter."
"In the aforementioned instances or any other reason, the Commission deems fit,"
"the  Commission  has 
the  discretion 
to  authorize  any  officer  outside 
the"
"Commission  to  prosecute  on  behalf  of  the  Commission.  This  is  in  no  way  a"
"derogation  of  the 
independence  of  the  Commission  but  an  exercise  of  the"
"Commission’s  discretion.  Although,  the  above-mentioned 
instances  are  not"
"exhaustive, it sheds light on the practical realities, the Commission encounters"
"when dealing with bribery and corruption."
"Therefore,  it  is  within  the  discretion  of  the  Commission  to  decide  whether  to"
"entrust the task to an officer of the Commission or to an outsider depending on"
"the requirement at the time. If this Court were to hold that the retention of an"
"officer of the Attorney General’s Department by the Commission for the purpose"
"of prosecution is illegal or otherwise irregular, it would amount to a restriction of"
"the  Commission’s  independence.  In  any  event,  as  discussed  previously,  the"
"instant forum of revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is ill-equipped to"
"pass judgment on the exercise of the Commission’s discretion."
