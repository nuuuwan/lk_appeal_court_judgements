"whether  the  Attorney  General  can  appear  in  his  “personal  capacity”  for  the"
"matters  of  government  bodies  or  agencies.  As  quoted  above  the  Court  has"
"maintained  the  line  of  precedent  that  the  Attorney  General  cannot  appear  in"
"personal  capacity.  However,  it  is  unclear  in  the  instant  matter  whether  the"
"petitioners  are  contending  that  the  Attorney  General  appeared  in  his  personal"
"capacity  as  an  Attorney-at-Law  disregarding  his  official  status  or  whether  he"
"prosecuted in his official capacity as the Attorney General."
"Nevertheless,  the  petitioners  contend  in  the  written  submissions  that  under"
"Section 12 of the CIABOC Act it is only the Director General of the Commission"
"that can institute proceedings under the Act. This is well settled law and has no"
"necessity  to  be  discussed  in  the  instant  application  as  the  Commission  has"
"properly directed to institute proceedings through the Director General as evident"
"from submissions made in the present matter. Instead, it is the prosecution by"
"the Attorney General that is at issue here."
