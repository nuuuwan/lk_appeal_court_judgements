"invoked  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the  Central  Province"
"holden  in  Kandy  in  case  bearing  No.  Rev/35/2012  seeking  to  have  the  said  order  of  the"
"learned Magistrate revised or set aside. The Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent had taken up"
"the  position  that  the  commissioner  of  local  government  is  not  the  competent  authority  to"
"institute proceedings under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act."
"It is relevant to note, the learned High Court Judge having inquired into the matter had held"
"that the impugned land does not belong to the Kadugannawa Urban Council. Therefore, the"
"Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner  (Appellant)  does  not  have  the 
locus  standi  to  institute"
"proceedings for recovery of possession under the Act. Accordingly, he has upheld the position"
"of  the  Respondent-Petitioner  and  revised  the  said  order  of  the  learned  Magistrate  dated"
"08.03.2012."
"Being  aggrieved  by 
the 
said  Order, 
the  Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner 
(Appellant)"
"(hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  ‘Appellant’)  has  preferred  this  appeal  seeking  to"
"have  the  order  dated  03.09.2013  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  set  aside.  It  was  the"
"contention of the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the"
"‘Respondent’) that the impugned land was not vested with the Kadugannawa Urban Council"
"and  that  Appellant  is  not  the  competent  authority  to  institute  proceedings  for  recovery  of"
"possession  under  section  5  of  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act.  Thus,  it  was"
"contended  that  the  Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner  (Appellant)  has  no 
locus  standi  to"
"institute proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court of Kandy."
"On behalf of the Respondent it was contended that at no point of time was the impugned land"
"vested with the Kadugannawa Urban Council and that Appellant, has no right or title to the"
"land.  On behalf of the Appellant, it was submitted that the impugned land is a state land, and"
"the competent authority is the Commissioner of Local Government of Central Province."
"The attention of Court was drawn to Section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession Act)."
"Thereby, the Respondent cannot question in the Magistrate’s Court whether the Appellant is"
"in fact the competent authority, or whether the subject matter is a state land as contemplated"
"in section 9 of the Act (cursus curiae)."
"Section 9 states"
