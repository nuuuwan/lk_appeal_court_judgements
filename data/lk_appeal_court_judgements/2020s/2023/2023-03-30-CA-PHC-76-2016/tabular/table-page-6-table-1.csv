"Obeysekere referring to the above judgement in SC Appeal No. 250/2014 mentioned above"
"held that,"
"“The above reasoning of the Supreme Court reflects the correct legal position for the"
"factual  situation  where  the  Competent  Authority,  having  formed  an  opinion  that  a"
"particular land is State land, issues a quit notice, and thereafter files an application for"
"ejectment in the Magistrate's Court. In such a situation, the learned Magistrate cannot"
"question the legality or reasonableness of such opinion, nor can the learned Magistrate"
"consider the title of the person who is sought to be ejected. As stated earlier, the scope"
"of  the  inquiry  before  the  Magistrate's  Court  is  circumscribed  by  the  provisions  of"
"Section 9, so that the learned Magistrate can only inquire from the respondent, as to"
"whether he has a valid permit or written authority of the State granted in accordance"
"with any written law and if so, whether such permit or authority is in force. If the"
"respondent cannot say 'yes' to both, the learned Magistrate does not have any choice,"
"and is required to issue the order for ejectment. This is the strict legal regime put in"
"place  by  the  Act,  which  has  been  referred  to  in  Divisional  Secretary  Kalutara  and"
"another vs Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa."
"Justice Obeysekera, however, went on to state in that case,"
"“This Court therefore takes the view that when exercising its jurisdiction in terms of"
"Article 140, it is entitled to consider the reasonableness and the legality of the basis on"
"which the Competent Authority formed his opinion as required by Section 3(1) of the"
"Act.”"
