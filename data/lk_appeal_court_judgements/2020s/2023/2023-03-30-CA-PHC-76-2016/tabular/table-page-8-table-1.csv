"authority of the State, granted according to any other written law which is currently in force."
"It is relevant to note that no such permit or any written authority had been produced at the"
"inquiry before the Magistrate. Thus, the Respondent had not discharged the burden cast on"
"him in terms of Section 09 of the Act.  As such, the  leaned Magistrate  has been correct in"
"making an order to eject the Respondent."
"Hence,  it  is  apparent  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  properly  evaluated  the"
"applicable  legal  provisions  in  the  said  Act  but  misled  himself  and  come  to  an  erroneous"
"conclusion and held against the Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner (Appellant)."
"The learned Magistrate has made his Order dated 08.03.2012 within the purview of the said"
"provisions  of 
the  State  Lands  Recovery  of  Possession  Act.  Therefore, 
the  Respondent-"
"Petitioner-Respondent cannot challenge it on the basis of illegality or any impropriety. Thus,"
"the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent is not entitled to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of"
"the  High  Court  as 
there  are  no  exceptional  circumstances 
for  Respondent-Petitioner-"
"Respondent to have the Order of the learned Magistrate set aside."
"As such, I hold that the learned High Court Judge has erred in law and made the Order dated"
"03.09.2013 erroneously. Therefore, we set aside the said Order of the learned High Court"
"Judge and affirm the order of the learned Magistrate dated 08.03.2012."
"Hence, we allow this appeal."
"Appeal allowed."
