"The  following  new  sections  84  and  85  were  also  inserted  immediately  after"
"section  83  of  the  principal  enactment  by  the  same  amendment,  which  reads"
"thus."
"84. A suspect or an accused who has not been tried and has not been"
"convicted  and 
sentenced  by  a  Court  under 
the  provisions  of"
"subsection (1) of section 54A and section 54B, shall not be detained"
"in custody for a period exceeding twelve months from the date of his"
"arrest."
"85.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section  84,  on  application"
"made  in  that  behalf  by  the  Attorney-General  to  the  High  Court"
"established under Article 105 or a High Court established by Article"
"154P  of  the  Constitution  such  Court  may,  for  good  and  sufficient"
"reasons that shall be recorded, order that a suspect or an accused who"
"has  not  been  tried  and  has  not  been  convicted  and  sentenced  by  a"
"Court  under  the  provisions  of  subsection  (1)  of  section  54A  and"
"section 54B, be detained in custody for a period in excess of twelve"
"months:"
"Provided  that,  the  period  of  detention  ordered  under  this  section,"
"shall not in any case exceed three months at a time and twenty-four"
"months in the aggregate."
"The  plain  reading  of  section  83  (1)  as  it  stands  now  clearly  establishes  that  a"
"person suspected or accused of an offence under section 54 A and section 54 B"
"of  the  Ordinance  shall  not  be  released  on  bail  by  the  High  Court  except  in"
"exceptional  circumstances.  However,  the  above  provision 
is  subject  to  the"
"provisions of section 84, 85 and subsection (2) of section 83."
