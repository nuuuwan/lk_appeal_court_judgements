"dispute  and  that  he  was  dispossessed  by  the  2nd Respondent  (Rohitha  Sanjeewa  Arambewela)  on"
"26.07.2007 from the premises in dispute."
"The learned Additional Magistrate/Primary Court Judge has held in terms of Section 68(3) of the"
"Act  that  the  deceased  1st Appellant  was  dispossessed  by  the  2nd  Respondent  within  a  period  of  2"
"months immediately before the date on which the information was filed by the Police on 26.07.2006."
"Therefore, as the learned Additional Magistrate has come to the correct findings of fact and law and"
"held in favour of 1, 2, 3 Respondent-Respondent-Appellants, we see no reason why the learned High"
"Court  judge  interfered  with  the  said  order  dated  05.12.2011  of  the  Additional  Magistrate  of"
"Kandy.  As such, the learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself and come to an erroneous"
"conclusion,  when  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  decided  that  2nd  Respondent  is  entitled  to  the"
"possession of the disputed premises."
"Therefore, we set aside the order dated 25.02.2014 made by the learned High Court Judge of the"
"Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Kandy and affirm the order of the Additional"
"Magistrate dated 05.12.2011."
"Court  directs  to  eject  the  2nd  Respondent-Rohtiha  Sanjeewa  Arambewela  from  the  premises  in"
"dispute and place 1A, 2, 3 Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in possession of the premises on behalf"
"of the deceased 1st Appellant."
"Hence, we allow the Appeal of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants."
"Appeal allowed."
