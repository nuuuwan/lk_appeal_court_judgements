"Under 
the  said  circumstances, 
the  Court  will  not  consider 
the  above-mentioned"
"argument of the learned President’s Counsel."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  to  the  Court  that  the"
"Respondents had failed to communicate or to publish the purported marking scheme"
"pertaining to the interview prior to the interview or even after the interview was held."
"The Petitioner had averred that even though, she had made requests under the Right to"
"Information Act by P21, P24 and P26, she was not provided with the marking scheme"
"marked  as  R6/8R-38.  The 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  appearing 
for 
the"
"Respondents argued that the marking scheme and criteria need not be disclosed prior to"
"the  interview  and  that  the  fairness  and  justification  of  an  interview  are  judged  on"
"whether the same criteria had been applied to all candidates and whether they had been"
"given the same opportunities."
"In the case of B.S.E.M. Perera Vs Victor Perera, Inspector General of Police and 22"
"Others,2 considering the same matter Justice Sathya Hettige held as follows;"
"“…And  as  such  I  do  not  see  that  any  injustice  or  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the"
"petitioner at the Interview as all the candidates have been assessed by the interview"
"board in good faith without any discrimination. I do not agree with the submission"
"made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioners were prejudiced as"
"marking  scheme  was  made  known 
to 
the  candidates  prior 
to 
the 
interviews…”"
"(Emphasis added)."
"Hence, after perusing the facts and circumstances of the case at hand, this Court is not"
"satisfied that the failure of the Respondents to communicate or to publish the purported"
"marking  scheme  prior  to  the  interview  or  even  after  the  interview  has  caused  any"
"injustice or prejudice to the Petitioner."
