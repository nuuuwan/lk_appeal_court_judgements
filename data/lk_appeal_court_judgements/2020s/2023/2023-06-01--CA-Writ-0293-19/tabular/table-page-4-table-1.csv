"names in the Land Ledgers maintained in the Land Registry. In the Petition to this Application,"
"no reliefs have been sought against naming the mother of the Petitioner as the Permit-holder in"
"the Permits marked as P7 and P8 and the Grantee in the Grants marked as P5 and P6."
"The position of the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents is that in terms of the Sale"
"of  State  Lands  (Special  Provisions)  Law  after  Puncirala  had  been  selected  to  alienate  the"
"subject matter of the action, the Permits marked as P7 and P8 had been prepared but before the"
"Permits were issued to him he had died. Therefore, in the Permits and in the Ledgers maintained"
"by the 1st to 4th Respondents in respect of the subject lands were altered by entering the name"
"of Punchirala’s widow, Nandawathi as the Permit-holder. Thereafter, the Grants marked as P5"

"marked P5 and P6 were issued to Nandawahi and after issuing the Grants she had nominated"
