"In the case of W.M Sirisena vs. Attorney General BASL Law Journal 1999 Vol VIII part 1/35 at page"
"72, decided on 22.03.1999, it was held;"
"“In this particular case no contradictions and omissions have been proved or marked, and"
"the learned trial Judge having had the benefit of the demeanour and deportment of the"
"witness,  has  been 
impressed  by  the  witness's  testimonial,  trustworthiness  and  has"
"accepted his evidence as creditworthy and truthful.”"
"Justice  Colin  Thome  in  Jagathsena  vs.  Bandaranaike  1984  (2)  SLR  observed  that  in  evaluating"
"evidence  even 
in  such  a  situation,  the  trial 
Judge  must  give  his  specific  attention  and"
"consideration to the all-important factor of the witness's demeanour and deportment, in the"
"witness box."
"In the light of the judgments mentioned above it is my contention that the learned trial Judge"
"had  no  material  to  determine  the  credibility  of  the  main  two  prosecution  witnesses.  In  the"
"totality  of  the  aforesaid  circumstances,  the  prosecution  has  not  discharged 
its  burden  of"
"establishing the charges of possession and trafficking of heroin against the  accused-appellant"
"beyond a reasonable doubt."
"It is unsafe to act upon the prosecution's unreliable evidence. The conviction and the sentence"
"cannot be substantiated by law or on the evidence led before the trial Court."
"Therefore, we find that the conviction cannot be upheld. We decide that the accused-appellant"
"not guilty for both charges in the indictment and allow the appeal."
