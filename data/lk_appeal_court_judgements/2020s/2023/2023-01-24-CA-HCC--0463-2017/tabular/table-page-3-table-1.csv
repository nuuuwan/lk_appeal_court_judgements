"Police Inspector Chandana (PW 1) who was attached to Kotahena Police Station had organised a",""
"sudden patrol at the area of Wadullawatta. This raid was organised without receiving a tip-off",""
"from an informant and without having proper information. Thereafter, PW 1 called a team of",""
"police officers attached to the Kotahena Police Station and left the station at 2.30 pm in a white",""
"colour Dolphin van bearing number 58-0093. They arrived at Wadullawatta area at about 2.50",""
"pm and stopped the vehicle and waited at a by-road.",""
"The appellant was walking on the road towards the said van. PW 1  got off from the van  and",""
"caught the appellant just as he was passing the said van. When he was searched, PW 1 found a",""
"pink colour cellophane bag inside the side pocket of his short. The appellant was arrested at 3.10",""
"pm. After that, PW 1 had taken the appellant to the Police Narcotic Bureau with the other police",""
"officers at 4.05 pm. The gross quantity  of heroin was 40.330 grams. Thereafter, the  accused-",""
"appellant was taken to the Kotahena police station at about 4.40 pm.",""
"Only two witnesses gave evidence regarding the detection, and other police officers were called",""
"to testify about the chain of custody. The Government Analyst in his report stated that the gross",""
"weight of the parcel he received was 40.2 grams and according to the said report the net weight",""
"of heroin is 10.7 grams.",""
"At the closure of the case for the prosecution, the appellant opted to give a statement from the",""
"dock in which he denied the charges levelled against him. He further denied that no such parcel",""
"of  heroin  was  recovered  from  his  possession  and  also  stated  that  he  was  falsely  implicated.",""
"According to the appellant on the day in question the police had initially come and searched his",""
"house when he was at home, and thereafter they left. Subsequently, the police had come back",""
"to his house after searching some shanties in the same area. At this point the police had arrested",""
"him and taken him to the police station. At the police station, his signature has been obtained in",""
"respect of the parcel.",""
"In the cross-examination, the  learned counsel for the  appellant suggested to the prosecution",""
"witnesses that the appellant was arrested at his house. It was denied by the witnesses.",""
"The learned counsel for the respondent submits that the alterations made to the notes cannot",""
"be considered in isolation as no suggestion was made as to the implications of this, such as the",""
"raid never having been conducted or the officers being elsewhere at the time.",""
"Learned counsel for the respondent argued that proceeding to investigate a drug related offence",""
"is not always instigated based on receiving information. It is a common practice of the police to",""
"engage  in  patrol,  upon  which  it  is  possible  to  encounter  offenders.  It  is  not  a  mandatory",""
"requirement to search or question multiple people in the vicinity prior to making an arrest. The",""
"differing evidence submitted by PW 1 and PW 6 as to how the  appellant came to the road is",""
"attributable to varying powers of observation of the individuals.",""
