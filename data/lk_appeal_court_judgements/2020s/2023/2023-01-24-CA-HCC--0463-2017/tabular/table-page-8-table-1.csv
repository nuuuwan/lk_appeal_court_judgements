"According to PW 1's evidence, soon after the appellant had passed the driver's seat situated on",""
"the right side of the van, he had alighted from the vehicle and arrested the appellant at the far",""
"end of the van. At the time of arrest, the appellant could not have passed the van. In contrast to",""
"the  above,  PW  6  had  stated  in  his  evidence  that  PW  1  arrested  the  appellant  soon  after  the",""
"appellant passed the driving seat of the van. PW 1 was in the left side of the front seat of the",""

"PW 1 admitted that he put his hand into appellant's front pocket of the short and found a pink",""
