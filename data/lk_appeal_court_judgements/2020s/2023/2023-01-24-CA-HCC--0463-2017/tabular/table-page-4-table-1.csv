"The  behaviour  of  the  appellant,  that 
is  him  walking  towards  the  police,  was  regarded  as"
"improbable  for  a  guilty  individual  to  resort  to  such  behaviour.  Logic  dictates  that  turning  or"
"running away upon seeing the police would immediately alert them. It is clear that the appellant"
"resorted  to  such.  Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  says  that 
it  was  observed 
in  the"
"prosecution witness’s evidence that they were amply corroborated and were consistent per se"
"and inter se. This has been discussed extensively by the learned trial Judge. Evidence of all the"
"prosecution  witnesses  regarding  material  facts  and  especially  the  chain  of  custody  had  been"
"corroborated."
"It was held in Attorney General vs. Devunderage Nihal 2011 (2) SLR 409 that, it cannot be stated"
"as  a  rule  of  thumb  that  the  evidence  of  a  police  witness  in  a  drug  related  offence  must  be"
"corroborated  in  material  particulars  where  police  officers  are  the  key  witnesses.  If  such  a"
"proposition  was to be  accepted  it  would  impose  an  added  burden on the prosecution  to  call"
"more than one witness on the back of the indictment to prove its case in a drug related offence,"
"however satisfactory the evidence of the main police witness would be."
"In Devunderage Nihal vs. The Attorney Genereal  SC/SPL/LA No.100/2010 dated 03.01.2019 , it"
"was held that this court is mindful of the fact that the witnesses testify before the trial Judge and"
"it is the trial Judge who would have the benefit of observing the demeanour and the deportment"
"of the witnesses. It is the trial Judge who would have the benefit of observing the manner in"
"which a witness faces the cross examination."
"Hence, in the absence of any other infirmities, having considered all these matters, if the trial"
"Judge forms the opinion that the witness is credible, I do not think the trial Judge has any other"
"option, other than to accept the evidence and to act on it. Hypothetically, if the rationale of the"
"Court of Appeal expounded in this case is applied, when a single police officer whilst on duty acts"
"on a tip-off that a person is engaged in an illegal activity, takes action and apprehends the person"
"so  engaged  in  the  illegal  activity with  a  prohibited  substance, no  prosecution  can  be brought"
"about against the person who was engaged in the said illegal activity, as there would be no other"
"witness to corroborate the police officer who made the detection."
"Although the learned counsel for the respondent relies on the above mentioned Devunderage"
"Nihal case, the facts and the circumstances are different in the present case."
"It  is  true  that  section  134  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  explicitly  lays  down  that  ""no  particular"
"number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact"", those witnesses"
"should explain the raid confirming the probability of the incident."
"It  was  held 
thus 
in  Devunderage  Nihal  vs.  The  Attorney  General.  SC/Appeal  154/2010"
"03.01.2019: “In fairness, it must be stated that the Court of Appeal had referred to the principle"
"that there is no necessity for a party to summon more than one witness to prove a fact. Learned"
"Judges of the Court of Appeal also had been mindful of the fact that, what matters is ""not the"
"quantity or the volume but the quality of the evidence"", the principle laid down in section 134"
"of the Evidence Ordinance is as follows;"
