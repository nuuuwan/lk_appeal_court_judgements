"It was held in Watawalakankanamlage Martin vs. The Attorney General;Court of Appeal Case No."
"HCC  260/2015  dated  05.11.2019  that  more  importantly  the  proviso  to  section  48  which  was"
"brought  by  the  amended  Act  No.  27  of  1999  provides  for  the  accused  in  a  criminal  case  to"
"demand that the witnesses whose evidence were recorded be re-summoned and reheard."
"That clear provision is made to avoid any prejudice that would cause to the accused and also to"
"give the accused person a fair trial. Although the appellant was represented by counsel in the"
"High Court, no application was made to re-summon or rehear any of the witnesses. After waiving"
"his right to demand to re-summon or rehear the witnesses, now at the appeal stage the appellant"
"cannot claim that he was prejudiced or was deprived of a fair trial."
"The learned trial Judges have had due regard for the preceding evidence in the case and have"
"duly adopted such and it is on this basis that the Judges have the discretion and entitlement to"
"proceed as they see fit. The appellant vis-a-vis section 48 have the right to make certain demands"
"and if this right conferred upon the accused has been blatantly disregarded, it is unjust to allow"
"the appellant at this stage to invoke its application and the corresponding benefit."

"legislature was clear when the amended Act No 27 of 1999 to the Judicature Act was enacted. It"
"is  to  expeditiously  continue  and  conclude  the  cases.  To  avoid  any  prejudice  to  the  accused"
"persons in criminal cases, proviso to section provides for the accused to demand if he so wishes"
"to recall the witnesses before the successor Judge. That gives the accused an opportunity to a"
"fair trial."
"The learned counsel for the respondent argued that in the instant case, defence had not made"
"any request before the successor Judge to recall any of the witnesses who testified before his"
"predecessor.  Hence,  the  contention  of  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the  appellant  was"
"deprived of a fair trial is untenable. This ground of appeal has no merit."

"Mohamed Inpas. Vs. the Attorney General. C.A. No. HCC No.130-132/2017 dated 28.08.2020, it"
"was held that lastly this Court proceeds to examine the validity of the complaint by the appellants"
"that there was no proper adoption of evidence under section 48 of the Judicature Act."
"Learned President's Counsel invited attention of Court to the proceedings of 21.05.2013, where"
"the  succeeding  trial  Judge  had  proceeded  to  hear  evidence  of  the  medical  witness  but  no"
