"“Provided that in any such case, except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial,"
"either party  may  demand  that  the  witnesses  be re-summoned  and  re-heard,  in  which"
"case  the  trial  shall  commence  afresh.  There  has  been  no  prejudice  caused  to  the"
"appellant, as encapsulated within the section was an opportunity for the accused person"
"to call for witnesses, which the accused has chosen not to act on. It is unreasonable to"
"claim at this stage, that there has not been compliance with section 48 to the satisfaction"
"of the appellant. It is clear that there has been proper adoption of the proceedings by"
"each  succeeding  Judge  and  the  contention  of  the  appellant  should  not  be  allowed  to"
"stand.”"
