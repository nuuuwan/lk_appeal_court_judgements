"different trial Judge, who was succeeded by the 2nd trial Judge, who in turn had proceeded from"
"the point the trial was adjourned by his predecessor on 21.05.2013."
"It is correct that there is no record confirming of any adoption of proceedings before the said"
"succeeding  Judge.  He  too  had  been  succeeded  by  a  third  trial  Judge  on  17.11.2015,  who"
"eventually delivered the impugned judgment. What is important here is that the proceedings"
"were  properly  adopted  before  the  2nd  succeeding  trial  Judge,  and  in  fact  a  witness,  whose"
"evidence had already been led before his immediate predecessor, was recalled by the said trial"
"Judge, upon an application of the appellants made under section 48. On 01.06.2017, the said"
"trial Judge delivered his judgment, after the defence case was heard by him in its entirety. Hence,"
"this Court is of the view that there is proper adoption of evidence by the trial Court, as mandated"
"by section 48 of the Judicature Act (as emended). It is my contention that considering the above"
"evidence, this ground of appeal too therefore fails."
"The learned counsel for the accused-appellant says that the learned High Court Judge has failed"
"to consider the test  of probability in evaluating the  credibility of evidence of the prosecution"
"witnesses.  It is important to note that in assessing the question of probability, the learned High"
"court Judge has failed to advert to the factual circumstances. There was no first information or"
"any other information received regarding the offence. PW 1 organised only a sudden patrol. The"
"Dolphin van was parked on a by-road which turns to Wadullawatta Janapadaya at 2.50 pm with"
"eight police officers in the van."
"It is evident that Wadullawatta Janpadaya is a highly populous area which has a huge number of"
"shanties. The police officers waited inside the van for 20 minutes at the place mentioned. The"
"appellant was the one and the only person arrested in the said patrol. The police carried out the"
"patrol even without having proper information, and the appellant was the only person searched"
"by the police officers."
"There was nothing on record to suggest that the police had even questioned or searched any"
"other person who was walking on the road. For me it is highly improbable and implausible that"
"only one person had been searched during the sudden patrol where 40.33 grams of heroin were"
"found. The description of evidence of PW 1 and PW 6 were different from each other as to how"
"the appellant came to the road. PW 6 stated that the appellant came from “watta” to the right"
"side of the road and he crossed the road. However, PW 1 stated that the appellant came straight"
"on the road."
"It was disclosed that PW 1 was in uniform and was sitting on the left side of the front seat inside"
"the van. When the police saw the appellant walking towards the van, the distance between both"
"parties were 25 - 30 meters. PW 6 admitted that the appellant was able to see the police officers"
"who were inside the van. In addition, PW 6 states that the appellant had come forward on the"
"middle of the road. Wadullawatta colony was 200 m away from the place at which the van was"
"parked, the appellant had walked towards the police van without running away."
"It is my view that this behaviour of the appellant is highly improbable. If the appellant had heroin"
"in his pocket, it would have been more reasonable to presume under section 114 of the Evidence"
"Ordinance that normal human conduct would have required a rational person, however arrogant"
"the  suspect  may  be,  to  have  taken  necessary  safety  precautions  in  order  to  avoid  arrest  and"
"detection. It is highly improbable that a suspect would have walked towards the van upon seeing"
