"called “Annasigalahena”. There is no doubt that the land which is referred to as"
"“Nayakadewatta”  by 
the  Plaintiffs  and 
the 
land  which 
is 
referred 
to  as"
"“Annasigalahena” by the Defendants is one and the same land depicted in that"
"plan."
"The case of the Plaintiffs is that the land in dispute was inherited by their mother"
"Lamahamy by paternal inheritance. The case of the Defendants is that the land"
"in dispute was owned by their father Hinni Appuhamy by long and continued"
"possession.  The  evidence  reveal  that  Hinni  Appuhamy  was  a  native  of  Galle"
"which is far away from the village where the corpus is situated and therefore"
"could not have inherited land in this area. It is not the case of the Defendants"
"that  Hinni  Appuhamy  purchased  this  land.  Their  case  is  that  he  became  the"
"owner of this land by long and continued possession. On the other hand, Lama"
"Ethana was a native of this village and she had the opportunity of inheriting land"
"in  the  area.  Although 
it  had  been  wrongly  suggested  to  the  3rd  Plaintiff"
"Rathnasekera in cross examination that the deed marked පැ2 does not refer to"
"the 
inheritance  of  Lamahamy,  පැ2 
refers 
to 
the  paternal 
inheritance  of"
"Lamahamy. In the schedule to that deed, it is specifically mentioned that the"
"subject matter of that deed  “Nayakadewatta” is a land which Lamahamy had"
"inherited through paternal inheritance. The witness Rathnasekera had stated in"
"his evidence that Lamahamy inherited this land from her father Punchirala. As"
"Lamahamy  is  a  native  of  that  village  there  is  a  strong  probability  for  such  an"
"inheritance. On the other hand, the case of the Defendants is that the land in"
"dispute  was  owned  by  their  father  Hinni  Appuhamy  by  long  and  continued"
"possession. The 1st Defendant Sirisena has stated in his evidence that the land"
"shown as lots 1, 2, 3 in the plan marked පැ1 is a portion of land which belonged"
"to the estate known as “Alupola State Plantation”. By saying so the 1st Defendant"
"had attempted to show that the land in dispute was not a land which belong to"
"Lama  Ethana’s  father  Punchirala  and  Lama  Ethana  could  not  have  inherited"
"same. In the same time, he has attempted to show that Hinni Appuhamy had"
"prescribed to this portion of land which belong to Alupola State Plantation by"
"long  and  continued  possession.  As  the  learned  District  judge  has  correctly"
"observed the 1st Defendant had not mentioned  the fact that a portion of the"
"land  (lots  1,  2,  3)  belonged  to  Alupola  State  Plantation, 
in  his  amended"
"statement  of  objections.  Although  the  1st  Defendant  has  stated 
in  cross"
"examination  that  the  corpus  in  dispute  falls  within  the  plan  of  the  Alupotha"
"estate and further stated that the Gramasewaka of the area had that plan the"
"Defendants had not taken any steps to produce such a plan in evidence to show"
