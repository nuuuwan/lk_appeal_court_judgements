"In the circumstances, I take the view, based on the legal provisions referred to above and"
"on the circumstances of this case, I cannot assume that the amendments introduced to the"
"Guidelines in the said Clauses 12 and 132 have been adopted exceeding the jurisdiction"
"and  by  violating  a  statutory  requirement  which  eventually  comes  under  any  of  the"
"established grounds of judicial review. For the reasons setout above, I am of the view that"
"the Cabinet has the authority to amend the existing Guidelines as mentioned above and"
"the Petitioners & the Chairman have failed to establish that the impugned decisions are"
"guilty of an illegality. Further, no viable legal ground has been presented by the Petitioners,"
"for this Court to declare the impugned amendments to the Guidelines ultra vires."
"In view of the foregoing, I take the view that there are no other facts and circumstances of"
"this  case  which  need  examination  on  affidavits  of  the  Respondents  at  a  final  hearing."
"Further, I am convinced that there is no arguable ground for judicial review which has a"
"realistic  prospect  of  success  which  warrants  this  Court  to  issue  formal  notice  of  this"
"Application on the Respondents. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this Application."
