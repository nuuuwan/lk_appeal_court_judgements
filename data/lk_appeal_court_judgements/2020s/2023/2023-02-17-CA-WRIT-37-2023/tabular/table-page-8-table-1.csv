"of the power purchase cost date from the transmission licensee. The Petitioners complain"
"that such provisions disrupt the general powers of PUCSL to hold a public hearing in order"
"to investigate and determine a tariff hike."
"The other main concern of the Petitioners is based on the impugned amendment by which"
"the  PUCSL  will  be  compelled  to  take 
immediate  action  when  the  Cabinet  grants,"
"considering the National importance, special approval for a revision of price and tariffs"
"based  on  a  transmission  and  distribution  cost.  The  Petitioners  contend  that  the  said"
"amendment overrides the general powers of the PUCSL as it will be bound to effectuate"
"such decisions of the Cabinet with immediate effect."
"The Court heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners in support of this Application and"
"the learned Additional Solicitor General (‘ASG’) who appears for the 1st, 1A and 3rd to 25th"
"Respondents  opposing  the 
instant  Application.  On 
the  date  of 
the  support  of 
this"
"Application, the PUCSL-1st Respondent was absent and unrepresented and however, the"
"learned Counsel who represented the Chairman of PUCSL-2A Respondent (‘Chairman’)"
"sought to make submissions only on behalf of the said Chairman but not on behalf of the"
"PUCSL. The Chairman was present in Court without a proxy or sanction of the PUCSL."
"The learned Counsel for the said Chairman clearly indicated that he was supporting the"
"Application of the Petitioners. Thus, this Court is unable to accept the issues raised by the"
"said Chairman as the opinion of the PUCSL, however, the submissions made on behalf of"
"the  said  Chairman  may  provide  an 
influential  effect  when 
this  Court  arrives  at  a"
"conclusion in this Order."
"The learned ASG referring to several provisions of law submits that the relevant Minister"
"has  the  power  to  formulate  Guidelines  and  the  Cabinet  has  not  taken  any  unlawful"
"decision in reference to the affairs mentioned in the instant Application."
"Now,  I  need 
to  consider  whether 
this  Court  should 
fully  consider 
the 
facts  and"
"circumstances of this case on affidavits of the Respondents at a final hearing or whether"
"there 
is  an  arguable  case  which  warrants  this  court  to 
issue  formal  notice  on  the"
"Respondents at this threshold stage."
"Primarily, what needs consideration of this Court is whether the relevant Minister or the"
"Cabinet has the power to amend the Guidelines and whether the amendments approved"
"thereto by the Cabinet are lawful."
