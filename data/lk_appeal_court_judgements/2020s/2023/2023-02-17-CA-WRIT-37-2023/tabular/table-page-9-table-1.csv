"Copies  of  two  legal  opinions  expressed  by  the  Attorney  General  on  28.07.2022  and"
"04.11.2022 are annexed to ‘P12’. Those opinions have been issued under the heading of"
"“Request for clarifications on the powers vested with the Minister in-charge of the Electricity Industry"
"on revision of electricity tariffs”. Those opinions of the Attorney General illustrate the legal"
"background  to  his  reason  why  the  PUCSL  is  duty  bound  and  obliged  to  give  effect  to"
"policy Guidelines issued with the approval of the Cabinet."
"In terms of Section 5(1) of the Electricity Act, the relevant Minister shall have the power"
"to formulate general policy guidelines in respect of the electricity industry. The  Section"
"5(3) of the said Act provides that the Minister has the authority to  forward the general"
"policy  guidelines  formulated  under  subsection  (1)  to  the  Cabinet  for  its  approval.  All"
"amendments sought to be made to the guidelines approved by the Cabinet, shall also be"
"required  to  be  approved  by  the  Cabinet.  The  Minister  by  virtue  of  Section  5(2)(d),  in"
"formulating  the  general  policy  guidelines,  should  take  into  consideration,  among  other"
"matters,  pricing  policy in  respect  of  the supply  of electricity  to  facilitate  the  sustainable"
"economic growth."
"As per Section 30(1)(a) of the PUCSL Act, the Cabinet of Ministers shall in consultation"
"with the Minister in charge of a public utilities industry, formulate where it sees fit, general"
"policy guidelines and issue such guidelines to the PUCSL through the Minister, inter alia,"
"on any matter identified in or under such industry Act for which general policy guidelines"
"may be made."
"The Section 30 of the Electricity Act deals with tariffs whilst the section 30 of the PUCSL"
"Act  deals  with  Policy  Guidelines.  In  terms  of  Section  30(2)(b)  of  the  Electricity  Act,"
"transmission and bulk sale tariffs and distribution and supply tariffs, as the case may be,"
"shall, in accordance with conditions specified in the relevant licence permit the relevant"
"licensee  to  recover  all  reasonable  costs  incurred  in  the  carrying  out  of  the  activities"
"authorized by its licence on an efficient basis."
"The provisions in Section 30(2)(c) of the Electricity Act is also pertinent to the issues of"
"this  Application  and  in  terms  of  such  provisions  the  PUCSL  is  duty  bound  to  approve"
"transmission and bulk sale tariffs and distribution and supply tariffs in accordance with"
"the  policy  guideline  approved  by  the  Cabinet under  Section  5.  Hence,  I  am  inclined  to"
"accept the contention of the learned ASG that neither the Electricity Act nor the PUCSL"
