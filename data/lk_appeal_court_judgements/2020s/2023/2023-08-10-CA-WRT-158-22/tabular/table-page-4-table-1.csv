"Nevertheless, since the Petitioner has taken over the apparel manufacturing facility owned by the"
"4th Respondent on lease from 01 May 2016 onwards by the Transaction Agreement marked P2,"
"when determining the liabilities of the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent in respect of payment of"
"statutory dues, it is imperative to take into account the terms and conditions within the agreement"
"P2 as well as the relevant statutory provisions."
"In terms of Clause 1.3.1. of the agreement marked P2 the Petitioner has agreed to employ 118"
"employees  of  the  4th  Respondent  Company  who  were  listed  in  Schedule  4  of  the  P2  on  fresh"
"contracts of employment commencing from 01 May 2016 (the effective date of the P2) on new"
"terms and conditions. Although the Petitioner claims that the 3rd Respondent’s name is not listed"
"in Schedule 4 of P2, it is observed by this Court that the 3rd Respondent’s name is also among said"
"employees  listed.  (See  item  no.15  of  the  Schedule  of  P2).  In  terms  of  Clause  1.3.2.  of  P2,  the  4th"
"Respondent is liable to settle all the statutory dues up to the effective date in respect of the said"
"employees. In spite of this arrangement, it must be noted that the payment of gratuity is a liability"
"imposed on the Employer by statute.  The written law pertaining to this is included in Section 5(1)"
"of the Payment of Gratuity Act."
