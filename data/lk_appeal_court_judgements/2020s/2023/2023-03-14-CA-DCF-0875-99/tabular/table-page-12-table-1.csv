"property in dispute. The burden is on the Defendants to prove their prescriptive"
"claim on a balance of probability of evidence."
"One  of  the  requisites  of  a  prescriptive  claim  is  to  prove  adverse  possession."
"Therefore, the Defendants must prove that they and their predecessors in tittle"
"were in adverse possession. That the Defendants and their predecessors in title"
"have possessed the corpus by a title adverse to or independent of that of the"
"Plaintiffs."
"In the case of Fernando Vs Wijesooriya 48 NLR 320 Canekeratne J. explained"
"the concept of adverse possession as follows;"
"“There  must  be  a  corporeal  occupation  of 
land  attended  with  a  manifest"
"intention to hold and continue it and, when the intent plainly is to hold the land"
"against the claim of all other persons, the possession is hostile or adverse to the"
"rights of the true owner. It is the intention to claim the title which makes the"
"possession of the holder of the land adverse; if it be clear that there is no such"
"intention there can be no pretence of an adverse possession.”"
"In the case of Naguda Marrikkar Vs Mohamadu 7 NLR 91 cited by the learned"
"Counsel  for  the  Defendants-Appellants  the  Judicial  Committee  of  the  Privy"
"Council held that, in the absence of any evidence to show that the possessor got"
"rid of his character of agent he was not entitled to the benefit of section 3 of"
"Ordinance No. 22 of 1871."
"For  the  reasons 
I  have  stated  earlier  Hinni  Appuhamy  could  never  have"
"commenced  adverse  possession  against  Lama  Ethana  and  the  Plaintiffs  who"
"were  his  wife,  children,  stepsons  and  stepdaughters  and  there  is  no  positive"
"evidence of an overt act which demonstrate that Hinni Appuhamy got rid of the"
"character of a licensee. Therefore, the prescriptive claim of the Defendants must"
"necessarily fail on that ground alone."
"Another  requisite  of  a  prescriptive  claim  is  to  prove  undisturbed  possession."
"Prescriptive possession is statutorily required to be undisturbed. In the case of"
"Simmon Appu Vs Chriatian Appu (1895) 1 NLR 228 Withers J. commented on"
"the concept of undisturbed possession as follows;"
"“Possession is disturbed either by an action intended to remove the possessor"
"from the land or by acts which prevent the possessor from enjoying the free and"
"full use of the land of which he is in the course of acquiring the dominion, and"
"which convert his continuous into a disconnected and divided user.”"
