"Hinni Appuhamy.  There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  Hinni  Appuhamy  chased"
"away  Lama  Ethana  from  matrimonial  home  and  Lama  Ethana  was  forced  to"
"leave matrimonial home due to the acts of Hinni Appuhamy. On the other hand,"
"the balance of probability of evidence show that Lama Ethana had gone to reside"
"in a house situated in a land which belong to Hinni Appuhamy which is situated"
"in the close vicinity. The 3rd Plaintiff had stated in his evidence that Lama Ethana"
"and  the  children  went  to  reside  in  a  land  called  “Annasigalawatta”  which  is"
"situated below (යටි පැත්ත ) the land which is in dispute. This land was owned"
"by  Lama  Ethana  and  thereafter  it  was  transferred  to  Hinni  Appuhamy.  Hinni"
"Appuhamy built the house which was standing thereon. Lama Ethana and the"
"children  came  to  reside  in  that  house.  This  evidence  is  corroborated  by  the"
"contents of the deed marked පැ3 which shows that Lama Ethana had owned a"
"land in the name of “Annasigalawatta” and later she had transferred the same"
"to  Hinni  Appuhamy.  According  to  the  3rd  Plaintiff  it  is  to  this  land  that  Lama"
"Ethana  had  come  to  reside  and  she  had  occupied  the  house  built  by  Hinni"
"Appuhamy.  This  act  of  Lama  Ethana  shows  in  no  uncertain  terms  that  the"
"relationship between Lama Ethana and Hinni Appuhamy had not come to an end"
"although it was not cordial. Lama Ethana must have left the matrimonial home"
"with a displeasure as she was not willing to share the matrimonial home with"
"another woman who was her husband’s mistress but her conduct shows that"
"her relationship with her husband never seized. Otherwise, she would not have"
"gone to occupy a house which belong to her husband and Hinni Appuhamy had"
"never  made  any  attempt  to  drive  her  away  from  that  house.  Under  those"
"circumstances Hinni Appuhamy could not have commenced adverse possession"
"against Lama Ethana even after she had left the matrimonial home. In any event"
"Hinni  Appuhamy  could  not  have  had  adverse  possession  against  3rd  to  6th"
"Plaintiffs who were his own children. Evidence show that the 6th Plaintiff was"
"residing in the corpus for a long period even after the death of Lama Ethana. It"
"is  also  evident  that  the  2nd  Plaintiff  had  a  house  within  the  corpus.  The  1st"
"Defendant had admitted that the 3rd Plaintiff was working in the bakery of Hinni"
"Appuhamy which was situated in the corpus. I have dealt with those evidence"
"under a different heading. The evidence show that the 6th, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs"
"were in possession of the corpus after Lama Ethana had left her matrimonial"
"home  and  they  were  in  possession  for  a  long  period  thereafter.  There  is  no"
"evidence to show that Hinni Appuhamy had objected to their possession and"
"taken  any  step  to  eject  them.  That  shows  that  a  cordial  relationship  existed"
"between the Plaintiffs and Hinni Appuhamy even after Lama Ethana had left the"
