"""The conclusion recorded by the Court of First Instance and affirmed by the High"
"Court  is  based  upon  appreciation  of  evidence  and  no  question  of  law  arises  therefrom."
"Normally this Court does not proceed to review the evidence in appeals in criminal cases,"
"unless  the  trial is  vitiated  by  some  illegality or  irregularity  of  procedure  or  the  trial  is"
"held in a manner violative of the rules of natural justice resulting in an unfair trial or"
"unless the judgment under appeal has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice. """
