"acceptable  in  a  background  of  rural  surroundings  in  which  the  incident  had"
"taken place."
"Hence  the  delay  in  lodging  the  complaint  in  the  police  had  been  suitably"
"explained by the prosecution."
"The  victim  being  child  of  six  years  at  the  time  of  the  incident  could  not  be"
"expected to be narrating the incident with an accuracy of an adult and especially"
"when it comes to the date of the offence."
"She had been consistent of the incident in spite of her age and the defense had"
"tried  very  strenuously  to  show  that  the  incident  was  created  for  a  monitory"
"dispute which is hard to believe because the victim had been quite consistent in"
"her narration of the incident."
"Furthermore,  the  defense  made  a  very  big  hue  and  a  cry  about  the  medical"
"evidence noting of a tear in the hymen and the victim stating in the history that"
"the appellant had abused her several times."
"But we note that the doctor had very clearly stated that the observations tally"
"with  the  history  and  the  history  cannot  be  ruled  out  in  comparison  with  the"
"findings."
"As such although the Counsel for the appellant very cleverly tried to draw the"
"picture that the prosecution version was an impossibility, we see no such thing"
"and we are of the opinion that the prosecution version has proved its case beyond"
"a reasonable doubt although the appellant has right along in his defense and in"
"his dock, statement had said that the story for the prosecution was a concocted"
"story. But we are unable to accept the same for the reasons stated above."
"As  such  we  see  no  merit  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Counsel  for"
"appellant, as such, we are compelled to dismiss the instant appeal and affirm"
"the conviction and the sentence of the appellant."
