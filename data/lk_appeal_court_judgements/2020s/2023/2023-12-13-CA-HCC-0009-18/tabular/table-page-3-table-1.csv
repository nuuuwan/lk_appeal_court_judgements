"Subsequently on another day when the mother had returned home from hospital"
"with  the  infant  sister  the  appellant  had  once  more  put  his  hand  in  to  her"
"underwear  which  the  mother  had  seen  partly  and  the  mother  had  questioned"
"her and the appellant and thereafter there had been several fights between the"
"appellant  and  the  victim’s  mother  and  as  a  result  of  which  the  mother  of  the"
"victim had complained to police on the 28th of March 2009."
"The victim had been examined by the Judicial Medical Officer on the 30th of the"
"same month and his evidence also had been led and to the JMO the victim had"
"said in the history that the appellant had kept his genital parts on to hers on"
"several occasions."
"But the doctor had observed an old tear in her hymen and the doctor had said"
"that her  hymen had enlarged  quite  not keeping with her age and he had said"
"that the tear in the hymen is due to penetration but he had also said that it could"
"have taken place if her genital parts had been pressed with a lot of force too often"
"because of her tender age."
"The doctor had not ruled out the history."
"The  prosecution  witnesses  had  been  lengthily  cross  examined  but  they  have"
"stood  the  test  of  consistency  and  credibility  although  the  counsel 
for  the"
"appellant had said very strenuously that it is an improbable story."
"But we observe that the mother of the victim had not complained instantly for"
"reasons she had explained and which are quite acceptable."
"The  belatedness  of  statements  has  been  considered 
in 
the  case  of"
"Arachchige  Mahinda  Dharma  Sri  Muthuarachchi  vs  Attorney  General  CA-"
"485-2017 decided on 24.7.2020 where it has quoted the case of Haramanis"
"vs Somalatha (1998) # Sri L.R. 365 where Jayasuriya J has held that “ the"
"law  in  its  wisdom  requires  that  the  statement  should  be  made  within  a"
"reasonable  time.  The  test 
is  whether 
it  was  made  as  early  as  could"
"reasonably be expected in the circumstances and whether there was or was"
"not time for tutoring and concoction”."
"In the instant matter it has been explained by the victim and the mother that"
"after the mother of the victim got to know there had been many fights between"
"the mother and the appellant and thereafter the families of both parties had tried"
"to settle the matter which is most natural, and failing all those only the complaint"
"had been logged."
"The Counsel for the appellant tried valiantly to show that the delay was due to"
"the tutoring and the concocting of the story but as stated above the witnesses of"
"the  prosecution  had  explained  well  as  to  why  the  delay  was  which  is  most"
