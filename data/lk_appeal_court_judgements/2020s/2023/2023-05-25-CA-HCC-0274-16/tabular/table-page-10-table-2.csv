"ඉස්සරෙට එන පුද්ගලයාෙ විමේසිංෙ මෙතා අල්ලා ගත්තතා.”"
"(At page 149 of the appeal brief)"
"At nowhere in his evidence, PW-02 has explained why he changed his evidence"
"given in his evidence in chief as to the information received to match what was"
"stated by PW-01 in his evidence."
"Apart  from  the  above,  the  prosecution  witnesses  have  stated  that  after  the"
"arrest of the appellant, they took him to his house only to inform a household"
"member that the appellant was arrested, but they did not search his house. It"
"is  doubtful  as  to  why  the  raiding  party  did  not  search  the  house  of  the"
"appellant after going there, as it would be the normal procedure of PNB officials"
"when a person is arrested allegedly for trafficking Heroin."
"It is the view of this Court that taken all these instances cumulatively, a doubt"
"invariably would arise in relation to the reliability of the evidence given by the"
"witnesses in Court."
"I am in no position to agree with the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor"
"General (DSG) that such hypothetical situations should not be considered as it"
"can also be the way the witnesses said that the informant engaged with them"
"and showed the appellant, enabling them to arrest him."
