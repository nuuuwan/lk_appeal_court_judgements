"learned trial Judge with a prejudicial mind, I find it would not be necessary to"
"consider  the  said  ground  of  appeal  further  as  the  appeal  by  the  appellant"
"would be successful on the earlier considered grounds of appeal."
"Accordingly,  I  allow  the  appeal  and  acquit  the  appellant  of  the  charges  for"
"which he was convicted."
