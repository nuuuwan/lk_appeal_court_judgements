"In Ajith Samarakoon v The Republic of Sri Lanka [2004], 2 SLR 209, His Lordship Justice"
"Jayasuriya held:"
"“Just because the statement of a witness is belated the Court is not entitled to reject"
"such testimony.  In applying  the  Test  of  Spontaneity the  Test  of  Contemporaneity  and  the"
"Test of Promptness the Court ought to scrupulously proceed to examine the reasons for the"
"delay. If the reasons for the delay adduced by the witness are justifiable and probable the"
"trial Judge is entitled to act on the evidence of a witness who had made a belated statement.”"
"In  the  case  of  Dharmasiri  v  The  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  [2012]  1  S.L.R  268,  Her"
"Ladyship Shirani Tilakawardane, J held that:"
"“Two critical tests before considering belated evidence as reliable evidence are: firstly"
"reasons for delay and secondly, whether those reasons are justifiable.”"
"Taking into account the foregoing observations, I am convinced that the explanations"
"given for  the delay  in  presenting evidence  are credible.  As  a result,  I find  the information"
"offered  by  these  witnesses  to  be  both  reliable and creditworthy.  Therefore,  we dismiss  the"
"objection raised by the Learned Counsel for the Accused regarding any purported delay."
"PW13, O.I.C Ratnasingham, indicated that the first complaint was received from PW1"
"and  that  she  also  identified  the  location  of  the  incident.  After  making  the  necessary"
"observations,  he  escorted  PW1  to  the  hospital  for  admission,  and  her  grandmother  was"
"designated to look after her during her stay."
"Upon  cross-examination,  the  Defense  Counsel  inquired  about  Udayakumar.  PW13"
"clarified that PW1 had not mentioned him, as her complaint was specifically focused on her"
"father's alleged misconduct. He confirmed that after obtaining PW1's account, her mother's"
"statement was subsequently documented"
"According  to  the  testimony  of  PW12,  Dr.  Jayantha  Herath,  who  conducted  the"
"medical examination of PW1, he noted that her hymen exhibited a 'crescentic' form. Due to"
"its elastic nature, the likelihood of detecting injuries is minimal. Dr. Herath further opined"
"that the possibility of two fingers being inserted into the prosecutrix's genitalia could not be"
"conclusively ruled out."
