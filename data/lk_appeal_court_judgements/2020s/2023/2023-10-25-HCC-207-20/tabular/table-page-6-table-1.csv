"In  the  matter  of  PW2,  Udayakumar  Agalya  (aunt  to  PW1  and  sister-in-law  to  the"
"Accused,  residing  in  proximity),  she  attested  that  PW1  approached  her  in  the  afternoon"
"concerning an incident involving her father. On the basis of her understanding, she suspected"
"that the issue related to child abuse. She elaborated that, owing to the fragile health condition"
"of PW1's mother, she neither reported this to the police nor confronted the Accused; instead,"
"she left PW1 at her grandmother's residence. PW2 corroborated PW1's testimony regarding"
"her mother's health condition, specifying that her reticence to inform her stemmed from the"
"likelihood of aggravating her condition. PW2 has also furnished a statement to the police."
"During her cross-examination, she confirmed that her awareness of the incident came"
"after  PW1  confided  in  her.  Through  this  corroborative  evidence,  it  is  manifest  that  the"
"prosecutrix promptly reported the incident to PW2. The defense counsel contested that there"
"was  a  delay  in  presenting  this  evidence,  but  such  an  argument  is  belied  by  the  prompt"
"reporting to PW2."
"When  considering  the  contention  whether  the  evidence  of  a  belated  witness  can  be"
"accepted or not, we shall observe the cases considered by Justice Sisira De Abrew in the case"
"of Anandappan Vishawanadan v AG, SC Appeal 15/2018, decided on 12.2.2021, His Lordship"
"held that:"
"“I hold that court should not reject the evidence of a witness who has made a belated"
"statement  to  the  Police  if  the  delay  has  been  explained.  In  the  present  case  the  delay  in"
"making the statement to the Police has been explained. Thus the decision of the learned trial"
"Judge to accept the evidence of witness Murugase Ravindran cannot be found fault with.”"
"In Sumanasena v Attorney General [1999], 3 SLR 137, His Lordship Justice Jayasuriya"
"held:"
"“""Just  because  the  witness  is  a  belated  witness  the  Court  ought  not  to  reject  his"
"testimony on that score alone and that a Court must inquire into the reason for the delay and"
"if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court could act on the evidence of"
"a belated witness.”"
