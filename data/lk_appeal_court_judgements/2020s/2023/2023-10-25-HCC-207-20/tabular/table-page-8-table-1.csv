"In his cross examination, we note that the defense put forward the disturbing question"
"of whether PW1 had engaged in self-indulgence to gain sexual pleasure, PW12 stated that"
"according to his observation as mentioned there is a possibility of the insertion of two fingers"
"and  PW12  further  claimed  that  it  is  unusual  for  a  child  of  this  age  to  engage  in  self-"
"indulgence, he further elucidated that the veracity of the situation could often be ascertained"
"through a brief patient history, affirming that they rely on the patient's own account for this"
"purpose."
"In my assessment, I deem the line of  inquiry advanced by the Defense to be wholly"
"unfounded. To insinuate that a child of such a young age and vulnerable state could partake"
"in dishonorable actions and subsequently fabricate accusations against her own father is both"
"derogatory and baseless."
