"test of locus standi in a Quo Warranto application. His Lordship Yapa J. in Dilan Perera"
"v. Rajitha Senaratne [2000] 2 SLR 79 (at pages 100 and 101) held:"
"“
any person can challenge the validity of an appointment to a public office irrespective of"
"whether any fundamental or other legal right of that person is infringed or not. But the Court must"
"be satisfied that the person so applying is bona fide in his application and that there is a necessity"
"i
n
 public interest to declare judicially that there is an usurpation of public office…. Even though"
"the applicant may not be an aspirant to the office, nor he has any interest in the appointment, he"
"can still apply as an ordinary citizen. A member of a municipal body or a mere rate payer can"
"challenge the right of a member to sit as a member in a municipality. Any person though not"
