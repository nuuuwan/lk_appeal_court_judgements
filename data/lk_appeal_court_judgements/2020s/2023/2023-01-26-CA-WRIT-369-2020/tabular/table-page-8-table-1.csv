"The reason we feel it is important to stress this distinction will be made clear in"
"the paragraphs to follow after we have set out an explanation of the Writ of Quo Warranto."
"M
. P. Jain and S.N. Jains’ ‘Principles of Administrative Law’ (7th Edition Volume"
"2 at page 2345) define Quo Warranto thus:"
"“The writ of quo warranto is used to judicially control executive action in the manner of"
"making appointments to public offices under relevant statutory provisions. Through this writ,"
"appointment of a person to a public office can be challenged if the person concerned is not qualified"
"to hold the office in question, or if his appointment suffers from any legal flaw.”"
"C
.K. Thakker in ‘Administrative Law’ (at page 434) notes:"
"“Quo warranto literally means ‘what is your authority?’ Quo warranto is a judicial remedy"
"against an occupier or usurper of an independent substantive public office or franchise or liberty.”"
"D
r. Sunil F.A. Coorey’s ‘Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka’ (4th Edition"
"Volume II at page 1056) explains:"
"“An order in the nature of a writ of quo warranto is applied for to have it declared by Court"
"that someone who is in de facto possession of a public office is not de jure entitled to it because his"
"e
l
ection or appointment to it is a nullity for some reason (or else because the public office in"
"question does not exist in law.) In such an application the person whose election/ appointment to"
"a
 public office is being challenged as being invalid, is called upon to show by what valid authority"
"(
appointment/election) he claims to be legally entitled to that public office. Such an order is also"
"available to have it declared by Court that someone who was earlier de jure entitled to a public"
"o
f
f
i
ce and who earlier exercises the powers of that office, has since become disentitled to such public"
"o
f
f
i
ce on account of some supervening circumstance”."
"I
n Dilan Perera (supra), his Lordship Yapa J. (at page 100) observed:"
"“Quo warranto is a remedy available to call upon a person to show by what authority he"
"c
l
a
i
ms to hold such office. Therefore, the basic purpose of the writ is to determine whether the"
"holder of a public office is legally entitled to that office. If a person is disqualified by law to hold"
"statutory office the writ is available to oust him.”"
"T
he  importance  of  the  distinction  between  those  remedies  is  that,  as  can  be"
"inferred  logically  from  the  above  explanations,  the  Writ  of  Quo  Warranto  can  only  be"
"invoked if the usurper is de facto holding office, even though he is not de jure entitled to"
"it. Meaning that it is only once the usurper assumes office can the remedy be availed of."
