"public officers. This Article, which has remained untouched by any amendment since the"
"promulgation of the original Constitution reads:"
"W
hen a public officer or an officer of a public corporation is a candidate at any election, he"
"shall be deemed to be on leave from the date on which he stands nominated as a candidate until"
"the conclusion of the election. Such a public officer or an officer of a public corporation shall not"
"during  such  period  exercise,  perform  or  discharge  any  of  the  powers,  duties,  or  functions  of  his"
"office. [emphasis added]"
"A
lthough we are mindful that Constitutional interpretation is within the ambit of"
"the Supreme Court, and that it would be ironic if we sitting in a matter dealing with an"
"allegation of usurpation of public office, usurp that power of interpretation, we will refrain"
"from embarking on ascertaining the intention of the framers in including such a provision,"
"we cannot, however, turn a blind eye to that provision which is plain."
"R
elated to this is a pragmatic consideration that weighs in our minds. That is, if a"
"public  officer  of  that  Constitutionally  stipulated  pay  grade  or  above  intends  to  run  for"
"public office at any election, an election which is proclaimed and then completed within a"
"legally mandated period (unless there are force majeure instances such as a Pandemic),"
"by the time the Officer follows the proper channel in order for him or her to resign and"
"completes all the antecedent steps to resignation, such an officer might be deprived of his"
"or her chance to stand for elections. We recognise that public service transcends a mere"
"contract and is a “status” or a “privilege” and that it is a noble service that is constituted"
"upon principles such as impartiality and political neutrality, the wisdom of Article 102"
"goes  somewhat  of  a  distance  to  address  that  pragmatic  consideration  of  the  unfairness"
"that may otherwise be occasioned."
"I
mplicit  in  this  analysis,  and  what  must  logically  follow,  is  that  if  like  in  the"
"present case, where the resignation was accepted only in the interim period between the"
"day of the election and the day of taking oaths, then there is no operative disqualification"
"or continuing violation after the date of taking oaths, unlike in Dilan Perera (supra) or"
"Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe (supra). If the resignation had not been duly accepted"
"by the appointing authority by the time the oaths were taken, then this Writ could have"
"been  granted  as  there  would  have  been  an  operative  disqualification  or  continuing"
"violation  after  the  point  of  time  of  taking  oaths  i.e.  sitting  and  voting.  That  would  be"
