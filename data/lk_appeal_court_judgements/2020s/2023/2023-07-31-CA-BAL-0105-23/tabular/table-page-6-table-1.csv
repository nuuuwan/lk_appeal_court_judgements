"However, it needs to be noted that there are several other instances where the"
"Court  of  Appeal  did  not  consider  the  time  period  a  suspect  person  has  been"
"incarcerated as relevant exceptional circumstances in order to grant bail."
"In the case of CA (PHC) APN No. 9-2010 decided on 19-07-2010, the Court of"
"Appeal  considered  the  facts  reported  by  police  in  the  B-report  as  relevant  to"
"consider  whether 
there  are  exceptional  circumstances 
to  grant  bail 
to  a"
"suspect.  Similarly,  there  are 
judgements,  which  say  that 
facts  cannot  be"
"considered as exceptional circumstances."
"The  above  varied  decisions  by  our  Superior  Courts  clearly  establish  the  fact"
"that whether a certain situation amounts to exceptional circumstances or not,"
"has to be considered on a case-by-case basis, unique to each application before"
"the Court."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  if  the  relevant  B-report  and  other  material"
"placed  before  the  Court  by  the  relevant  investigation  authority,  provides  a"
"sufficient  basis 
to  consider  granting  bail 
to  a  suspect, 
there  exists  no"
"impediment for this Court to consider them as relevant in determining whether"
"exceptional circumstances exist under a given situation."
"In  the  matter  under  consideration,  even  though  the  indictment  dated  14-12-"
"2021  had  been 
forwarded 
to 
the  relevant  High  Court, 
the 
trail  has  not"
"commenced  until  16th  May  2023,  may  be  due  to  the  heavy  workload  of  the"
"Court."
