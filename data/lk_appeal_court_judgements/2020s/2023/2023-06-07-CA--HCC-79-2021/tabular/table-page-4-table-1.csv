"section 110(10) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code has very clearly stated"
"that every statement made by a witness should be dully signed and any alteration"
"made during recording also should be dully initialed by the witness, therefore, the"
"section nowhere states that a minor need not sign a statement made to the police."
"If the statement had not been signed it amounts to the fact that the evidence led"
"in Court is of less value because it amounts to being narrated in Court for the first"
"time which challenges the truthfulness of the evidence. Therefore, we are unable"
"to agree with the Counsel for the respondents."
"The  next  point  raised  by  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant  is  that  the  time  of  the"
"incident had not been established by the prosecution, which the counsel for the"
"respondents also conceded although the victim had said at different times in her"
"evidence  that  the  incident  took  place  in  the  afternoon.  But  she  was  not  very"
"certain about it but if her narration of the incident is being told first time in Court"
"every other thing, she had said creates a doubt in the case for the prosecution"
"which should be held for the benefit of the appellant."
"The  next  point  raised  by  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant  is  the  fact  that  in  the"
"evidence of the victim she says that she was brought home by the appellant from"
"his sister’s house which is also situated nearby. But the evidence of the mother is"
"that  the  appellant  had  brought  both  children  home  from  Kadir’s  house  which"
"throws a serious doubt because if so, how come the appellant had an opportunity"
"to sexually abuse the victim because she had not been alone with the appellant."
"Secondly it throws a serious doubt in the credibility of the evidence of the victim"
"and is contradicting the mother’s evidence which reduces the credibility of the"
"prosecution version and raises a serious doubt with regard to the probability of"
"the story of the prosecution."
