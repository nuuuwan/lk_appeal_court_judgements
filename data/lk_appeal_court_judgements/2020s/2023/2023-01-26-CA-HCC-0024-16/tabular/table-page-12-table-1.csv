"the judgement has  not caused any prejudice to the Appellant.  Hence, this"
"ground also lacks merit."
"Under  the  eighth  ground  of  appeal  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant"
"contends that the items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to"
"support the conviction."
"In  this  case  in  order  to  find  the  Appellant  guilty  of  the  charge,  all  the"
"circumstances must point at the Appellant to show that he is the one who"
"committed  the  murder  of  the  deceased  and  not  anybody  else.  It  is  the"
"incumbent  duty  of  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  same  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt."
"The Appellant in this case admitted that he brought the deceased home from"
"the house of PW1 in the night on the date of the incident. PW2 and PW3 gave"
"evidence to the effect that the Appellant had assaulted the deceased on that"
"night till 10.30 p.m. PW3 had heard the deceased desperately pleading with"
"the Appellant not to harm her. She had also requested the Appellant not to"
"shout  as  some  visitors  were  present  next  door.  The  Appellant  not  only"
"assaulted the deceased but he had scolded her too. Witness PW3 had last"
"heard the desperate wailing of the deceased around 10.30 p.m. Thereafter,"
"nothing was heard from the deceased or the Appellant. The deceased’s naked"
"body was found in her house on the following afternoon."
"The Appellant had brought an axe from PW4, the mother of the deceased two"
"weeks prior to the incident. The investigating officer had recovered the said"
"axe from close proximity to the deceased’s body with blood stains. PW4 had"
"identified the said axe during the trial."
"According to the doctor extensive cut injuries were seen on the neck region"
"of the deceased. Her spinal cord also had been severed."
"The Appellant was arrested by the investigation officer when he was handed"
"over to him by the villagers. A blood-stained shirt and a sarong were found"
"inside a bag carried by the Appellant."
"The Appellant although has raised an alibi in his dock statement, he had not"
"posted  any  question  in  the  cross-examination  for  any  of  the  prosecution"
