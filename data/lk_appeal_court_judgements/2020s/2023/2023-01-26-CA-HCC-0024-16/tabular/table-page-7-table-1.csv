"home intoxicated. Hence, she accompanied the deceased’s daughter who was"
"9 years old at that time."
"PW7, IP/Wijeratna was the chief investigator of this case. When he received"
"the  first  complaint  about  the  murder  from  PW1,  he  had  visited  the  scene"
"along with a team of police officers. In the course of the investigation, a group"
"of people brought the Appellant to the scene of crime. After initial inquiry, he"
"was arrested as a suspect for the death of the deceased. At the time of arrest"
"the  Appellant  carried  a  bag  along  with  him.  A  blood-stained  shirt  and  a"
"sarong were inside the bag. The said items along with other items were taken"
"into PW7’s custody for further investigation."
"When  the  defense  was  called,  the  Appellant  made  a  dock  statement."
"According  to  him,  on  the  date  of  the  incident,  after  accompanying  the"
"deceased home, he had gone to Kokkuvil for mason work after dinner. On"
"the following morning after work, he had gone to a bar to consume liquor at"
"5.00  a.m.  Around  2.00  p.m.  while  consuming  liquor  he  was  caught  and"
"severely beaten by the relations of the deceased. Hence, his position was that"
"he was elsewhere after dinner on the previous night."
"In this case the Appellant did not follow procedures laid down under Section"
"126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 when he pleaded"
"an alibi in his dock statement. Further he had not raised a single question"
"regarding his alibi defense to lay witnesses who gave evidence about beating"
"the  deceased  from  8.30-10.30  p.m.  on  that  fateful  day.  Hence,  the  only"
"conclusion that this court can reach is that the stance taken by the Appellant"
"in  his  dock  statement  is  a  clear  after-thought.  Further  consuming  liquor"
"from 5.00 a.m. in a bar, is a blatant lie uttered by the Appellant."
