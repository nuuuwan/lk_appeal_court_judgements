"natural justice by terminating the grant (sic) No. 279/31 issued in favour of"
"the Petitioner. Accordingly, the Petitioner submitted that the above decision is"
"ultra vires."
"Matters to be determined"
"The fundamental issues before the Court are whether there is an impropriety"
"of procedure in cancellation of the permit issued to the Petitioner and whether"
"the above decision of the 1st Respondent is ultra vires."
"As it was correctly submitted by the 1st to 6th Respondents, ‘P 2’ is not a grant"
"but a permit issued under the L.D.O. The Respondent stated that permit ‘P 2’"
"was given to one Podi Appuhamilage Dayapala whereas the Petitioner named"
"in the caption and the person who has sworn the affidavit in support of the"
"Petition is one G. A. Dayapala and therefore, the application is misconceived"
"in  law.  In  response,  the  Petitioner  stated  that  the  Petitioner's  name  was"
"misprinted because of a technical error. In fact, in the caption of the affidavit"
"and the declarant’s name in the affidavit is printed as G. A. Dayapala whereas"
"in  fact  it  should  have  been  P.  A.  Dayapala.  However,  on  the  Petitioner's"
"national identification card submitted with the petition (‘P 2’), the Petitioner's"
"name is  Podi Appuhamilage  Dayapala.  In  addition,  in  the  counter  affidavit"
"filed by the Petitioner, the name of the declarant is rightly mentioned as Podi"
"Appuhamilage Dayapala."
"As such, I am inclined to accept that the error in the Petitioner's name in the"
"affidavit is a genuine error and does not affect the identity of the Petitioner."
"Above all, the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents did not"
"pursue the above issue at the argument."
"Analysis"
"The Respondents admitted that the permit bearing No. 279/31 was issued to"
"one Podi Appuhamilage Dayapala on the 4th March 1965, under the L.D.O.3."
"The  Respondents  stated  that  since  the  permit  holder,  Podi  Appuhamilage"
"Dayapala breached the conditions of the permit No. 179/31 (‘P 2’), same was"
"cancelled pursuant to Sections 106 and 109 of the L.D.O. Accordingly, it was"
"submitted that the permit (‘P 2’) was cancelled following the due process laid"
"down in the L.D.O. Although, the Petitioner submitted that the permit holder"
