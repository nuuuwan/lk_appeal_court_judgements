"According to the order cancelling the permit, the grounds for cancellation are"
"the failure to reside on the land, failure to develop the land, alienation of the"
"land  and  failure  to  possess  the  land. At  the  argument,  the  learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor General submitted to the Court that although four grounds for the"
"cancellation are mentioned, violation of any of those grounds is sufficient to"
"cause the cancellation. The Petitioner himself admitted that he constructed a"
"building for the funeral endowment society and allowed it to be used by the"
"society6. Accordingly, by his own admission it is established that the Petitioner"
"breached conditions (xv) of the permit ‘P 2’. From the above facts, it is clear"
"that the 1st Respondent arrived at the impugned decision to cancel the permit,"
"having followed the procedure laid down in the L.D.O."
"Conclusion"
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  1st  Respondent"
"followed the procedure in the L.D.O. and availed the Petitioner an opportunity"
"to  be  heard,  prior  to  making  the  impugned  order  cancelling  the  permit."
"Nevertheless, the petitioner, through his own fault, has not made use of them."
"In the result, I am of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to the writ of"
"certiorari and writ of mandamus prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the"
"prayer of the petition."
"I dismiss this application subject to a cost of Rs. 50,000/-."
