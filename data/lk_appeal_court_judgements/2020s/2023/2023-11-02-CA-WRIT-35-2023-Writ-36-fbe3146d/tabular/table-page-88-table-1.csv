"from government servants. The petitioners cited the case; All India Judges’ Association vs"
"Union of India and Others AIR 1993 SC 2493, where the Indian Supreme Court held: “It is"
"not necessary to repeat here what has been stated in the judgement under review while dealing with the"
"same contentions raised there. We cannot however, help observing that the failure to realize the distinction"
"between the judicial service and the other services is at the bottom of the hostility displayed by the review"
"petitioners to the direction given in the judgement. The judicial service is not a service in the sense of"
"‘employment’.  The  judges  are  not:  employees.  As  members  of  the  judiciary,  they  exercise  the"
"sovereign  judicial  power  of  the  State.  They  are  holders  of  public  office  in  the  same  way  as  the"
"members of the council of ministers and members of the legislation.” (emphasis added)"
"According to the abovementioned case cited by the petitioners, it is emphasized that judges"
"do not fall within the ambit of employee. Nevertheless, it further highlights that judges are"
"holders of public office similar to members of the council of ministers and members of the"
"legislation."
"In line with the above observations, it can be noted that the Court System in Sri Lanka is"
"established by the Constitution and the Judicature Act or any other Statute, on the pillar of"
"the sovereignty of the people and therefore the mandate of such institutions is to exercise the"
"judicial  power  of  the  people.  This  is  further  buttressed  by  the  fact  that  judicial  officers  are"
"renumerated from the Consolidated Fund which is established mainly by the money taxed on"
"the general public."
"Therefore,  such  a  link  infers  the  public  character  of  the  service  performed  by  the  judicial"
"officers and as such it can be observed that the judicial officers, albeit not determined as public"
"officers, do hold a public office. In the same light, the courthouses and the services therein"
"performed are for the benefit of the general public at large by utilising public funds.  Hence,"
"the public nature of the services performed by the judicial officers can be brought to light to"
"affirm that a judge does hold a public office and thus can be brought within the purview of"
"‘employment’ as interpreted under the Inland Revenue Act (as amended), thereby enabling"
"the diminution of the remuneration under APIT."
"Remuneration through the Consolidated Fund"
