"independence  of  the  judiciary.  Taxes  are  one  of  the  main  revenues  generating  measures  to"
"enhance public finance. Public services such as free health and free education in this country are"
"run with public finance. They are open to all citizenry including judges of the superior courts and"
"Judicial Officers within the meaning of Article 111M of the Constitution. ln fact, the decision of"

"admitting their children to State schools. Hence there is no logical reason to exempt judges from"
"making  their  contribution  to  the  public  coffers  along  with  the  other  members  of  the"
"community.  To  that  extent,  the  classification  is  permissible.  Judges  should  have  the  same"
"obligations as other citizens on taxing matters.” (Pages 46 – 47) (Emphasis added)"
