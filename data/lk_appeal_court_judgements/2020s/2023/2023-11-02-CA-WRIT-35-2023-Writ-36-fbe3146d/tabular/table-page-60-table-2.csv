"The reader may refer to the fifth proposition."
"(7) The seventh proposition:"
"The  facts  of  Hatter  [in  regard to  Medicare  tax] shows that  it  was  a  reduction  of"
"compensation itself, it reduced a conferral of compensation."
"In Hatter,"
"(1) In 1982 Congress extended Medicare to federal employees,"
"(2) In 1983 Congress required federal employees to participate in social security. It left"
"about 96% of those who were currently employed free to choose not to participate in"
"social  security,  thereby  avoiding  any  increased  financial  obligation.  It  required  the"
"remaining 4% to participate in social security while freeing them of any added financial"
"obligation.  But  it  left  those  who  could  not  participate  in  a  contributory  program"
"without a choice. This last mentioned group consisted almost exclusively of federal"
"judges."
