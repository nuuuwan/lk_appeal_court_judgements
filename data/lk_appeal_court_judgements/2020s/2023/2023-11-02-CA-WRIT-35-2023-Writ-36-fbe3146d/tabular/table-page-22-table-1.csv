"Lifestyle and Social Circles 
:  Judges  often  maintain  a  distinct  lifestyle,  sometimes"
"interacting more within legal circles and being mindful of their public image."
"Judicial officers face challenges, make personal sacrifices, and contribute to society in their"
"own way, just like any other profession. It is essential to remember that judges are still human"
"beings with personal lives, emotions, and experiences. While they may have a unique role,"
"they are part of the society as well. The perception of judges as distinct and separate can vary"
"across  different  cultures  and 
legal  systems.  Ultimately, 
their  distinctness 
lies 
in 
their"
"professional duties and ethical obligations, but they remain integral members of the broader"
"community they serve."
"Learned  President’s  Counsel  who  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  petitioners  argued  that  the"
"independence of the Judiciary is guaranteed through security of tenure, income security and"
"non-interference. As a result, it was argued that judges' salaries cannot be reduced by an act"
"of  the  Executive  or  Legislature.  In  particular,  it  was  submitted  that  Article  108(2)  of  the"
"Constitution which specifically provides that the salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court"
"and the Court of Appeal cannot be reduced and must be read as a limitation on Parliament in"
"determining the salaries of superior court judges and not as an exclusion of the minor judiciary"
"from the general principle that judges' salaries must not be reduced."
"The decision in Senadhira vs. The Bribery Commissioner 63 NLR 313 on page 317 held that"
"""full salaries are absolutely secured to them during the continuance of their commissions""."
"Clause 31 of the Beijing Principles, August 1995 states that the remuneration and conditions"
"of judges should not be altered to their disadvantage during their term of office, except as part"
"of a uniform public economic measure to which the judges of a relevant court, or a majority"
"of them, have agreed."
"There is a general principle that the salaries of the judges shall not be reduced during their"
"term  of  office  which 
is  recognized  by 
judicial  precedent  and 
in  several 
international"
"declarations  and  guidelines.  In 
the 
‘UN  Basic  Principles  on 
the  Independence  of 
the"
"Judiciary’, it is provided in clause 11 that the term of office of judges, their independence,"
"security, adequate remuneration, conditions of service, pensions and age of retirement shall"
"be adequately secured by law. The ""Latimer House Guidelines"" for the Commonwealth, 11.2."
