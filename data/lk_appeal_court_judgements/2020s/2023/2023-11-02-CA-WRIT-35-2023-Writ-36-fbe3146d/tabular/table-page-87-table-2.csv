"N.L.R 77 page 469, where His Lordship Justice Pathirana has quoted Queen v Guardians of"
"St. Martin’s (1851) 17 QB 154, in which it was held that:"
"“This case discusses what the office of a public nature is. Lord Campbell, C.J. said Then, is the"
"office of a public nature? We must look to the functions, and compare them with those which"
"were held to constitute such an office in Darley v. The Queen (12 Cl. & Fin. 520). The House of"
"Lords laid down no criterion in that case; but they held that the office there in question was public"
"within the rule they laid down; and I think the present office is not distinguishable. Whether the"
"district for which it is exercised be a parish, or a hundred, or several parishes in a union, appears"
"to me to form no ground of distinction, if it be an office in which the public have an interest”"
