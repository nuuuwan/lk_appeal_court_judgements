"Scalia’s dissent."
"(5) The fifth proposition:"
"The Question in Evans, 1920, Miles, 1925 and O’ Malley 1939 were inclusion of"
"the salary in “gross income”. Presently, this has to be considered as a reduction of"
"the  “value  of”  compensation,  not  a  reduction  in  compensation  itself,  which  is"
"permissible."
"This is based on the premise, that, Hamilton accepted the power of the Congress to"
"increase the salaries of judges due to inflation."
"Although, it is not perfectly clear, as to how, this is recognized as an empowerment"
"to  reduce  the  “value  of”  compensation,  in  a  manner  akin  to  inflation,  etc.,  the"
"methods  by  which  the  value  of  the  money  is  reduced,  without  infringing  the"
"“compensation clause,” it has become the upshot, the cursus curiae, of American"
"cases. [Justice Scalia, in his dissenting opinion in Hatter too, used “italics” for the"
"words “value of” thus signifying that there is an especial meaning attached to those"
"words]."
