"“In addressing these points, it is apposite to refer to the dissenting judgment of Justice Holmes,"
"with whom Justice Brandeis concurred, in Evans v. Gore (Supra. at page 265) where he held:"
"“The exemption of salaries from diminution is intended to secure the independence of the"
"judges, on the ground, as it was put by Hamilton in the Federalist, (No. 79,) that ""a"
"power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will."" That is a very good"
"reason for preventing attempts to deal with a judge's salary as such, but seems to me no"
"reason for exonerating him from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all"
"others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly"
"be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge. I see nothing in the purpose"
"of this clause of the Constitution to indicate that the judges were to be a privileged class,"
