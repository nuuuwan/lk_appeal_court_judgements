"(iv) Re Australian Education Union & Australian Nursing Federation; ex parte Victoria (1995) 69"
"ALJR 451; [1995] HCA 71; 184 CLR 188; 128 ALR 610:"
"“In our view, also critical to a State's capacity to function as a government is its ability, not only"
"to determine the number and identity of those whom it wishes to engage at the higher levels of"
"government,  but  also  to  determine  the  terms  and  conditions  on  which  those  persons  shall  be"
"engaged. Hence, Ministers, ministerial assistants and advisers, heads of departments and high"
"level  statutory  office  holders,  parliamentary  officers  and  judges  would  clearly  fall  within  this"
"group. The implied limitation would protect the States from the exercise by the Commission of"
"power to fix minimum wages and working conditions in  respect of such persons and possibly"
"others as well. And, in any event, Ministers and judges are not employees of a State.” (para 58)."
