"(8) The eighth proposition:"
"Although in the statement in 01 above there is the word “directly”, that is not to"
"say that a nondiscriminatory tax is permitted."
"It is because the statement in 03 above."
"The decision of the court in Hatter was to allow such a reduction as the Medicare"
"tax as permissible."
"But, as per Justice Scalia’s dissenting opinion, which is based on Hatter’s majority"
"decision accepting Hubert L. Will, 1980, 449 U. S. at 226, (Hatter, page 571) the"
"majority decision of Hatter then becomes contradictory."
"The reason is, because Hatter says salaries of judges cannot be reduced even if the"
"legislature reduces all other salaries [by following Hubert L. Will] and it then says"
"a nondiscriminatory tax is permissible."
