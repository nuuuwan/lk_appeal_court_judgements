"is  also  questionable  on  the  same  basis.  In  terms  of  Section  131  of  the"
"Companies Act17, every company has to submit an annual return at least"
"once every year, including inter alia the details of its shareholding.  Under"
"Section 123, every company that has issued shares should maintain a share"
"register. Section 130 provides that the entry of the name of a person in the"
"share register as holder of a share shall be  prima facie evidence that the"
"title to the share is vested in that person. But there is no presumption of that"
"kind for the annual report. It is therefore apparent that the Appellant failed"
"to produce the most essential documents in support of its claim. I am aware"
"that the burden is on the taxpayer to disprove the correctness an assessment."
"Although  the  dispute  may  be  on  the  reasons  given  by  the  Assessor  for"
"rejecting the return and making an assessment, yet, the onus of disproving"
"the estimate lies on the tax payer. In my view, the Appellant has failed in"
"this instance to disprove the assessment. Therefore, I am of the view that,"
"based on the available evidence, the TAC is justified in holding that DSI is"
"the holding company of the Appellant."
"Therefore, in light of the available evidence, for the limited purpose of this"
"case I answer the first question of law that it is DSI Samson Group (Pvt)"
"Ltd is the holding company of the Appellant within the meaning of Section"
"26 (1)(x) of the IR Act."
"2.  In view of the requirement in Section 26(1) (x) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act No. 10 of 2006 to consider the issued share capital and “reserves”,"
"can  a  negative  Retained  Earnings/  Accumulated  Loss/  Deficit  be"
"considered as “reserves”?"
