"This  Court  has  constantly  taken  the  view  that in  an  application  for  judicial  review,  the"
"stage of notice demands that the Court should consider whether the case is suitable for full"
"investigation at a hearing at which all parties have been given notice. Thus, I hold that the"
"test for prima facie case has not been fulfilled by the Petitioner of the instant Application"
"and accordingly, the Application for formal notice on the Respondents is refused."
