"“This  Court  wishes  to  emphasise,  for  the  avoidance  of  any  doubt  that  the  Competent"
"Authority is not required in terms of the Act to carry out an inquiry of the title of the person"
"who is in unauthorized possession of such land”."
"“……The principle then is that while no inquiry is needed to form an opinion, there should"
"be a rational basis to form the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land. The"
"rational  basis  should  satisfy  the  Wednesbury  test  of  reasonableness.  Thus,  a  Competent"
"Authority would be acting reasonably if he were acting on the basis of a Surveyor General's"
"plan, even if the occupant is claiming prescription. The Competent Authority is not expected"
"to, and indeed is precluded from, carrying out an inquiry”. (Emphasis added)"
