"Permit in respect of the land in dispute."
"Wade and Forsyth in the book Administrative Law1, describe that,"
"“a  Writ  of  Certiorari  is  issued  by  the  Court  to  quash  an  order  passed  by  an"
"inferior court, tribunal, or quasi-judicial authority, whenever the authority has"
"acted in excess of its power, or without requisite jurisdiction, or has violated the"
"principles of natural justice… A quashing order is issued to quash a decision"
"which is ultra vires whereas a prohibiting order is issued to forbid some act or"
"decision which would be ultra vires.”"
