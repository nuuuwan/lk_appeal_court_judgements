"and to the title regarding the said portion of land which is in the extent of 8.11 perches."
"The duty cast upon this Court is to consider whether a writ of Mandamus can be issued"
"against the 3rd and 4th Respondents as prayed for in the Prayer of the Petition."
"In  this  context,  I  need  to  examine  the  involvement  of  the  Urban  Council  in  the  affairs"
"relating to the instant Application. To my mind, the Petitioners’ primary claim emanates"
"from the Deed of Assignment (‘P16’) No. 157 attested by E.M.M.N. Ekanayake Notary"
"Public on 16.01.2018. One of the witnesses to the said ‘P16’ is the Secretary of the said"
"Urban Council.  The said Secretary has placed her signature therein to endorse the said"
"assignment for which purpose the said deed has been executed."
"In  the  said  Deed  of  Assignment,  the  Urban  Council  has  assigned  the  land  morefully"
"described in its schedule which is an extent of 6.29 perches. The said Schedule refers to"
"Lot No.11 of Surveyor General’s Plan No. Mu. Pi. Gam 3072. Based on such Lot No.11"
"another  plan  No.  2923  has  been  made  by  J.M.  Wijewardena  Licensed  Surveyor."
"Significantly, the said Deed of Assignment elaborates the reasons why the block of land"
"morefully  described  in  its  schedule  was  assigned  to  the  Assignee  mentioned  therein."
"According to the conditions depicted in ‘P16’,  the Urban Council referring to the block of"
"land acquired by way of the relevant orders published in the Gazette Extraordinary No."
"1089/18 and No. 1165/19 under the Land Acquisition Act, declares that when acquiring"
"such land under the above Gazette Notifications a portion of land in the extent of 8.11"
"perches  has  been  left  out  without  being  duly  acquired.  Thus,  in  order  to  facilitate  the"
"assignee in ‘P16’ the Urban Council has purportedly released a block of land in extent of"
"8.11 perches from Lot No. 11 of the Surveyor General’s Plan No. Mu. Pi. Gam 3072."
"Although it appears, prima facie, that the Surveyor General's Plan No. Mu. Pi. Gam 3072"
"reflects  an  acquisition  of  land  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  however,  no  adequate"
"material has been presented to the Court to establish any link between  Lot No.11 of Mu."
"Pi. Gam 3072 and Lot No. 03 and 23 of Surveyor General’s Plan No. Gam/ Minu/98/24."
"Hence, this court is unable to arrive at any conclusion as to whether the portion of land"
"assigned under the said ‘P16’ is State land. Moreover, I cannot gather any provision of law"
"on the Urban Council's authority to assign land vested in it under section 44 of the Land"
"Acquisition Act.  In terms of the certificates of handing over possession marked ‘3R5’ and"
"‘3R6’ it is envisaged that only the possession of the said Lot No. 03 and 23 of Surveyor"
