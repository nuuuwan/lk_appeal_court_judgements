"The  1st  Petitioner  claims  that  she  submitted  a  building  plan  to  the  3rd  Respondent-"
"Minuwangoda Urban Council (‘Urban Council’) for approval in November 2018 as she"
"intended  to  construct  a  building  on  the  subject  land.    The  building  plan  has  not  been"
"approved by the said Urban Council and accordingly, she seeks a mandate in the nature"
"of  a  writ  of  Mandamus  directing  anyone  or  more  of  the  Respondents  to  expeditiously"
"conclude the process of approving the said building plan. In addition to the aforesaid relief,"
"the Petitioners are seeking for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing"
"any one or more of the Respondents to hand over free and vacant possession of the said"
"subject  land.  According  to  the  Amended  Petition  dated  21.10.2022,  the  subject  land"
"claimed by the Petitioners is in the extent of 6.29 perches (Acres 0 -Roods 0 -Perches 6.29)."

"published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1089/ 18 on 22.07.1999 (marked ‘P2’/ ‘3R3’) the"
"Lot Nos. 03 and  23 depicted in Surveyor General’s Plan No. Gam/ Minu/98/ 24 made"
"on 13.02.1999 have been acquired by the State. The extent of the said Lot Nos. 03 and 23"
"are hectares 0.01604 and 0.01657 respectively. Whereas, the State has acquired a total of"
"12.89 perches (0.03261 hectares). The contention of the Petitioners is that the husband of"
"the  1st  Petitioner  was  in  possession  of  a  land  in  extent  of  21  perches  from  which  the"
"aforesaid portion of land had been acquired by the State.  Although the balance portion of"
"8.11  perches  has  been  transferred  to  various  parties  subsequently,  the  1st  Petitioner  has"
"made several representations to the relevant authorities claiming compensation in respect"
"of the said portion of land which is in the extent of 8.11 perches. This court is unable to"
"examine and arrive at any conclusion as to who would be entitled to such compensation"
