"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that  the  charge  in  the"
"indictment does not specify the type of the gun, but only refers to a gun of a T-"
"56  variety  and 
the  appellant  was  clearly  misled  because  of 
this 
lack  of"
"information and if he was properly informed of the charge against him, he would"
"not have pleaded guilty to the charge on his own accord. It was the contention"
"of the learned President’s Counsel that because of this misdirection, a fair trial"
"has not been afforded to the appellant, and moved for the setting aside of the"
"conviction and the sentence on that basis."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  when  the"
"appellant pleaded guilty on his own accord, he very well knew that the charge"
"against him was for possessing a T-56 weapon and it cannot be said that the"
"appellant was misled at the time of pleading guilty. However, he conceded that"
"the Government Analyst Report has not specifically mentioned that the relevant"
"weapon sent to the Government Analyst as an automatic gun."
"It was his view that this is a matter that should be clarified by the Government"
"Analyst and he expressed the view that this is a fit matter where a retrial should"
"be  ordered 
in  view  of  the  submissions  made  before  this  Court,  and  the"
"explanation that needs to be obtained for the Government Analyst in relation to"
"the weapon produced before him for analysis."
"As I have stated before, the indictment does not state that the weapon alleged to"
"have been possessed by the appellant is an automatic weapon, but merely says"
"that he had in his possession a gun namely, a T-56 firearm. In the Government"
"Analyst  Report  too,  the  Government  Analyst  has  not  specifically 
identified"
"whether it was an automatic gun or a repeater shotgun but has stated that the"
"weapon comes under the definition of a gun."
"Section  22  (1)  of  the  Firearms  Ordinance  No.  23  of  1916  which  has  not  been"
"amended by Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996 reads as follows."
