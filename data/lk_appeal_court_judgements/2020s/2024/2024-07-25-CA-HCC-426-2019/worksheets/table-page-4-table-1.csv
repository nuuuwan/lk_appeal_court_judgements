"him. When inquired, he has uttered the words that the chain was snatched."
"After  his  admission  to  the  hospital  with  the  help  of  others,  the  deceased  has"
"succumbed to his injuries few hours after the incident."
"PW-01 has failed to identify the knife used in the crime. When she was shown"

"was wearing at the time of the incident, but she is unable to recognize it, as she"
"cannot remember."

"appellant  as  Sandun  in  her  evidence,  when  this  incident  occurred,  he  was"
"unknown to her. It is clear that she has referred to the appellant as Sandun only"

"She has stated that she cannot exactly remember whether the appellant went to"
"the  upstairs  of  the  house  first  and  her  son  went  later,  or  both  of  them  went"

"incident and could not remember much of it due to the tragedy of losing her son."
"The evidence also provides that the deceased had been a 19-year-old youth at"
"the time of his death."

"wearing at the time of the incident."
"According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted"
"the post-mortem, the deceased has received a deep stab wound just below his"
"right  side  armpit,  which  has  penetrated  the  heart  cavity  and  the  lungs.  Apart"
