"Lord Templeman said,",""
"","“In the present case, the inspector who recommends, took one view and"
"","the Secretary of State who decides, took the opposite view. Subsequently,"
"","I. L. E. A. which was the only organization worth considering, disappeared"
"","from  County  Hall  and  from  existence.  By  the  Act  of  1985,  Parliament"
"","decided  to  change  the  organization  of  the  local  government  of  Greater"
"","London  in  a  way  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  made"
"","County  Hall  redundant  for  local  government  purposes.  It  is  not  for  the"
"","court to question the wisdom of Parliament. It is not for the court to order"
"","that the main building shall have a splendid future as the home of local"
"","government and that the owners from time to time of the main building"
"","shall be compelled to let the premises to local government authorities and"
"","no  one  else  and  to  suffer  offices  to  be  occupied  by  public  typists  to  the"
"","exclusion of private typists. Consistently with the Act of 1985, the abolition"
"","of  G.  L.  C.  and  the  abolition  of  I.  L.  E.  A.  and  the  dispersion  of  their"
"","functions,  the  L.  R.  B.  has  secured  and  the  Secretary  of  State  has"
"","approved, that the main building shall have no future as the home of local"
"government.  That","is  a  political  decision  and  the  planning  decision"
"follows inexorably…” (page 755)",""
