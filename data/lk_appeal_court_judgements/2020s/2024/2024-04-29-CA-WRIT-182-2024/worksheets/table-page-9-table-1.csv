"“But, just as with contracts, the ordinary rules must give way where their"
"application becomes incompatible with the free and proper exercise of an"
"authority's  powers  or  the  due  performance  of  its  duties  in  the  public"
"interest. Where the normal principles of justice are forced to give way, hard"
"cases naturally result. As discussed below, it is possible for a citizen to be"
"seriously misled by a public authority in a manner which ought, under the"
"normal rules, to give rise to an estoppel which would compel the authority"
"to stand by its representations; but there may be no legal remedy.” [page"
