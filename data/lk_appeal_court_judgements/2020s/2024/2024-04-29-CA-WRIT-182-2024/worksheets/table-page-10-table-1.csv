"land to a 'tenant.’ (Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries vs. Matthews [1950]"
"1 K. B. 148). The result was the same where the supposed landlord was a"
"local authority which had failed to obtain the requisite consent from the"
"minister, so that the lease was void. Accordingly, the local authority was"
"at  liberty  to  deny  the  validity  of  their  own  'lease',  contrary  to  the  rules"
"which govern private lettings. (Rhyl UDC vs. Rhyl Amusements Ltd [1959]"
"1 W. L. R. 465). No arrangement between the parties could prevent either"
"of them from asserting the fact that the lease was ultra vires and void. Nor"
"can  any  kind  of  estoppel  give  a  tribunal  wider  jurisdiction  than  it"
"possesses. (Secretary of state for employment vs. Globe Electric Thread Co"
"Ltd [1980] A. C. 506)”. [Emphasis added in this order]. [page 278]"
