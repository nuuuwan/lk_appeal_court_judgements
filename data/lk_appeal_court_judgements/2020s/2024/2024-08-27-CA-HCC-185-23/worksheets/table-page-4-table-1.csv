"the appellant during cross examination, such evidence has been accepted by"
"the defence to be truthful. The court is also in agreement. The learned counsel"
"has cited the case of B.R.R.A Jagath Premawansa v Attorney General C.A"
"Appeal 173/2005, which states that, “whenever the evidence given by the"
"witness on a material point is not challenged in cross examination it has to be"
"concluded that such evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent"
"subject however to the qualification that he is a reliable witness”."
"Furthermore, the counsel for the appellant had suggested to the two official"
"witnesses, PW-01 and PW-02, that the accused-appellant had been mistakenly"
"arrested as the real intention of the police was to apprehend the accused-"
"appellant’s brother, who was on open warrant."
"In the case of Wijesekera (Excise Inspector) v Arnolis, (1940) [17 CLW 138],"
"Justice Wijeyewardene has held that “… it is not every kind of doubt the benefit"
"of which an accused person is entitled. An accused person could claim only the"
"benefit of a reasonable doubt. It is always possible to conjure up a doubt of a"
"very flimsy nature. But an accused person cannot be acquitted on the ground of"
"such doubt…The guilt or innocence of an accused person must be determined on"
"evidence and not on some suggestion made in the course of an argument…”"
"The cross-examination of these two witnesses did not give rise to an inference"
"that the witnesses had gone to arrest the brother of the accused, as they"
"vehemently denied the suggestion put forth by the counsel for the appellant."
"Furthermore, the defence was not able to elicit during cross-examination any"
"admission favourable to the position of the defence. The defence had also failed"
"to provide reasons as to why the accused-appellant was arrested for"
"committing the offences of trafficking and possession of Heroin, if it is indeed a"
"mistaken arrest. The prosecution witnesses have been subjected to lengthy"
"cross examination and this court is convinced that they had stood the test of"
"cross-examination very well. And at this point, the prosecution had given"
"evidence that the accused-appellant had absconded using forged documents."
"The Government Analyst, PW-07, in evidence gave an explanation as to the"
"small discrepancy of a matter of milligrammes in the weight of the substance,"
"prior to and after government analysis."
"The trial judge, in his judgement, has correctly analysed all the evidence"
"presented by the prosecution and defence and according to law, found the"
"accused guilty of the second charge of the indictment, which is possession of"
"heroin and had acquitted him of the first charge, which was the trafficking of"
"heroin. The learned State Counsel cited the case of Premathilake v Republic"
"of Sri Lanka 75 NLR 506, which states that a conviction could be based upon"
"the telling evidence of a mass of eloquent circumstances remain unexplained"
