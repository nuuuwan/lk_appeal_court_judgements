"by the accused, no reasonable judge could have any verdict other than that of"
"guilt."
"Since the evidence of the official witnesses has not been refuted by the defence"
"and the fact that evidence given is more than sufficient to find the accused"
"guilty of the crime of possession of heroin, this court rejects all seven grounds"
"of appeal put forth by the counsel for the accused and affirms the judgement"
"and sentence given by the learned trial judge to the accused."
