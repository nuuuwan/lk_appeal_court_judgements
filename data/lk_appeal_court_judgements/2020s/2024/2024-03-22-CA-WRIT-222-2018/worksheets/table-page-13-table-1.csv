"Tennakoon however this is no cause for surprise. “It must be noted that"
"this  is  nothing  new  and  it  was  reported  from  several  areas  including"
"Mahiyanagana and Tirappaney.”"
"Tennakoon believes the problem does not lie in the manner in which the"
"Maharagama  candidates  earned 
their  votes. 
“The  majority  of 
these"
"contestants never came to Maharagama, they never even knew that they"
"are  candidates  for  this  particular  election.  But  they  won  a  considerable"
"number of votes. ….."
"“The problem now is that there are some candidates who do not want"
"to  resign.  These  candidates  have  been  consulting  opinions  of  experts"
"about the next course of action. They are constitutionally elected members"
"and it is up to them to decide whether or not to assume duties as council"
"members.  For  those  seeking  to  become  members  of  the  Maharagama"
"Urban Council when the elected candidate resigns, it will not be an easy"
"task.”"
"“On  the  other  hand  there  may  be  a  repetition  of  what  took  place  in  the"
"Colombo Municipal Council several years ago,” Tennakoon said."
"He referred to the May 2006 elections, where the UNP nominations"
"list for the Colombo Municipal Council was rejected, an independent"
"group contesting under the spectacle symbol secured 23 seats with"
"the  support  of  the  UNP.  “A  Trishaw  Driver  performed  better  than"
"anyone else during these elections and eventually became the mayor."
"We were very watchful of the developments during this tussle. There were"
"several allegations regarding some officers in the CMC. To our surprise no"
"corruption charges were levelled against this gentleman.”"
"“With  such  experiences 
in  mind, 
it 
is  my  opinion  that  this  sort  of"
"environment will come into play in Maharagama as well."
