"matter was fixed for argument for (vii) 16.12.2022. On that day it was re fixed"
"for  (viii)  13.02.2023.  Again  to  (viii)  03.04.2023.  That  was  the  first  day  this"
"matter  came  before  the  Bench  presided  by  me  [accompanied  by  Justice"
"Iddawala] due to reallocation of work after the appointment of the current"
"President, Court of Appeal. The petitioners were absent and unrepresented."
"The counsel for the respondent said that the matter has become academic."
"I  issued  notice  on  the petitioners.  On a subsequent  day  Mr. Panditharatne"
"appeared and submitted that the matter is of public importance."
"Then  it  was  fixed  for  argument  on  25.10.2023,  heard  on  that  day;  and  hence"
"judgment was fixed to be given by me with Justice Iddawala."
"Judgment was fixed for 14.12.2023, having given written submissions date as"
"27.11.2023.  The 
latter  was  a  mention  date.  On 
that  day  no  party  was"
"represented.  On  14.12.2023  junior  counsel  for  the  petitioner  informed  that"
"written submissions were tendered to the registry. There was no appearance for"
"the respondents. On 26.01.2024 that junior counsel for the petitioner consented"
"myself giving the judgment as Single Judge, for it was heard by me and Justice"
"Iddawala. The latter has left judiciary. The Registrar was directed to inform the"
"counsel for the respondents that the matter will be mentioned on 31.01.2024."
"Then after some dates on which there was no appearance for the respondents"
"the judgment was fixed for 22.03.2024."
"The  limited  objections  of  26th  and  27th  respondents  dated  05.05.2022  among"
"other  things  state  that 
in  a  Quo  warranto  application  no  substitution 
is"
"permitted and when the original respondent ceases to hold office, the application"
"becomes 
invalid.  The  objections  of  2,4,15,16,17.19,20,21,22,23,24  and  25"
"respondents were filed on 21.10.2018."
