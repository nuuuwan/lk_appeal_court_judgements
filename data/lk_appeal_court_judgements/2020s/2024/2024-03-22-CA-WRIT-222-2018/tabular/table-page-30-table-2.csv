"","","At the commencement of the hearing both learned President's Counsel for"
"","","the Respondents submitted that the 2nd Respondent had ceased to hold"
"","","office as Chief Minister and that it would be futile to hear and determine"
"","","the appeals. Both learned Counsel for the Petitioners contended that the"
"","","2nd Respondent had ceased to hold office even prior to the grant of special"
"","","leave to appeal, but that no objection was taken at that stage; and that"
"","","special  leave  to  appeal  had  been  granted  on  a  matter  of  great  public"
"","","importance. If the objection of futility is now upheld, the Court of Appeal"
"","","judgement will be regarded as authoritative and binding, in respect of all"
"","","future vacancies in any Provincial Council, and the Commissioner would"
"","","be bound to act on the basis of that judgment, thereby giving rise to fresh"
"","litigation.",""
"","","In  this  case  we  are  not  faced  with  a  situation  in  which  the  impugned"
"","","decision  or  declaration  had  ceased  to  be  operative  before  the  litigation"
"","","commenced  (as  in  Punchi  Singho  v  Perera,)  or  where  an  order  for  relief"
"","","might  be  futile  because  the  official  to  whom  it  was  directed  had  lawful"
"","","authority to revoke it (as in Ramaswamy v Moregoda). On the contrary,"
"","","it is the law's delays which have given rise to the objection of futility."
