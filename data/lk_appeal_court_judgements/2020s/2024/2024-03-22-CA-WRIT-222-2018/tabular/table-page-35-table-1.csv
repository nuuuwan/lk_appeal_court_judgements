"Quoting this passage with approval, Lord Irvine LC has said that when an act or"
"regulation has been pronounced by the court to be unlawful, it is then recognised"
"as having had no legal effect at all. This consequence flows from the ultra vires"
"principle or “equally acceptably” from the rule of law. The Supreme Court has"
"been equally emphatic: an unlawful act was 'null and of no effect. The voidness"
"of  invalid  acts  also  flows  from  the  classic  approach  to  ouster  clauses  and  the"
"necessity of collateral challenge to the rule of law as explained elsewhere. But,"
"as will be seen, an absolute approach to invalidity, although principled and"
"resting upon high authority, poses conundrums that need to be understood"
"in order to be resolved."
