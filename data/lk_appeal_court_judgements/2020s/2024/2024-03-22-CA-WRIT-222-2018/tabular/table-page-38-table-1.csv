"application of Miller) vs. The Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41]. The court having"
"found that it was not precluded by Parliamentary privilege from considering the"
"validity of the prorogation itself. The logical approach to that question is to start"
"at the beginning, with the advice that led to it. That advice was unlawful. It was"
"outside the powers of the Prime Minister to give it. This means that it was null"
"and of no effect.... It led to the Order in Council which, being founded on unlawful"
"advice, was likewise unlawful, null and of no effect and should be quashed. This"
"led  to  the  actual  prorogation,  which  was  as  if  the  Commissioners  had  walked"
"into Parliament with a black piece of paper. It too was unlawful, null and of no"

"the Supreme Court but it is patently impractical as a general approach to"
"the questions of Invalidity, it worked  in this case and will work in many"
"other cases. But for the reasons set out above an invalid act must sometime"
"have legal effect."

"The House of Lords held in 1975 that there is a presumption of validity in"
"favour of a disputed order until set aside by the court. And this is so even"
"where temporary obedience to the disputed order would cause irreparable loss"
"to a party. But their landships have since been held that this presumption was"
"“an  evidential  matter  at  the  interlocutory  stage  and  involved  no  “sweeping"
"proposition that subordinate legislation must be treated for all purposes as valid"
"until  set  aside.”  There  is  no  rule  that  lends  validity  to  invalid  acts  The"
"presumption  of  validity,  therefore,  is  temporary  and  procedural  only,  it"
