"The Petitioner argues that the lack of action from the Council and the Urban"
"Development 
Authority 
constitutes 
a 
violation 
of 
their 
statutory"
"responsibilities  under  the  Urban  Development  Authority Act  and  Planning"
"and Development Regulations, which obligate them to address unauthorized"
"constructions  within  urban limits. He asserts that their continued  inaction"
"has  not  only  exacerbated  his  personal  difficulties  but  also  constitutes  a"
"dereliction  of  their  statutory duties  to  protect  private  property  rights  and"
"enforce building regulations."
"T
he  Petitioner contends  that the 1st  to  4th  Respondents  hold  a  clear legal"
"obligation under the Urban Development Authority Act No. 41  of  1978  and"
"the  Planning  and  Development  Regulations 
to  address  unauthorized"
"constructions, 
including 
issuing  demolition  orders  where  violations  of"
"building plans create obstructions or infringe upon private rights. Section 28A"
"of the Urban Development Authority Act explicitly empowers these authorities"
"to take corrective action, including demolition, where construction  activities"
"violate  approved  permits  or  encroach  upon  legally  designated  spaces.  The"
"Petitioner further argues that the statutory framework, supported by Planning"
"and Development Regulations 2021,  mandates that these authorities ensure"
"compliance,  making 
it  unlawful  for  them  to 
ignore  clear  cases  of  non-"
"compliance, especially when a private right is infringed."
"T
he  Petitioner emphasizes that  he  has  taken  every reasonable  measure to"
"secure enforcement of his rights through administrative channels and argues"
"that the Respondents'  continued  inaction  justifies the Court’s  intervention."
"He asserts that the present application for a Writ of Mandamus seeks only to"
"compel the Respondents to carry out their statutory duties and address the"
"ongoing  harm 
caused  by 
the  unauthorized  constructions 
on 
the  5th"
"Respondent’s  premises.  The  Petitioner  argues  that  if  the  Court  does  not"
"compel  the  Respondents  to  act,  his  legal right to  unobstructed access  will"
"continue to be unlawfully infringed, leading to further irreparable harm."
"I
n  support  of  his  claims,  the  Petitioner  submits  documentary  evidence,"
"including the photographs of  the unauthorized structures (P5(a), P5(b),  and"
"P6),  letters to the authorities (P10(a),  P10(b),  and P11),  and correspondence"
"between the Urban Development Authority and Urban Council regarding the"
"unauthorized  constructions 
(P13).  These  documents  establish 
that 
the"
"Petitioner has a clear legal entitlement to exclusive access to the road,  that"
"unauthorized structures were built in contravention of  approved plans,  and"
"that  the  relevant  authorities  failed  to  act  on  clear  violations  of  statutory"
"building standards."
