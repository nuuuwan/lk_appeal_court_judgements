"T
he 
Petitioner  alleges 
that 
the  5th  Respondent 
has 
erected 
several"
"unauthorized structures on his hotel property that extend onto or encroach"
"upon  the  Petitioner’s  private  access  road.  These  constructions  include  a"
"staircase, exhaust and sewage pipelines, window openings, exhaust fans, and"
"an  extended  roofline,  all  of  which  are  purportedly  inconsistent  with  the"
"approved  building  plan.  The  Petitioner  contends  that  these  unauthorized"
"constructions have disrupted his access, created health and safety hazards,"
"and compromised the enjoyment of his property."
"T
he  documents  provided  by 
the  Petitioner  substantiates  these  claims,"
"particularly  photographic 
evidence  showing 
the  encroaching  structures"
"(P5(a), P5(b), and P6) as well as documentation indicating the lack of approval"
"for 
these  modifications 
from 
relevant  authorities.  Notably, 
the  Urban"
"Development  Authority’s  own 
field  inspection  report  (3R2)  confirms  that"
"certain  constructions  on  the  5th  Respondent’s  property  deviate  from  the"
"approved plan, undermining the 5th Respondent’s assertion of compliance."
"F
urthermore, additional correspondences,  including a letter from the Urban"
"Development  Authority  dated  20.07.2020 
(P11),  document  that  the  5th"
"Respondent  was formally  instructed to  submit  a  revised plan  for  approval,"
"acknowledging  noncompliance  with  planning 
standards.  Despite 
this"
"instruction,  no  conformance  or  amended  plan  was  submitted, 
further"
"indicating a willful disregard for regulatory compliance. This is compounded"
"by continued complaints from  the Petitioner, which received no subsequent"
"enforcement  action  from  either  the  Urban  Development  Authority  or  the"
"Maharagama Urban Council, despite their statutory obligations."
"T
he Court, therefore, finds that the Petitioner has provided sufficient evidence"
"to 
show 
that 
the 
5th  Respondent’s 
constructions 
are  unauthorized,"
"contravening 
both 
local 
planning 
regulations  and 
approved 
building"
"standards. The failure of the 5th Respondent to secure appropriate approval"
"for  these  modifications 
is  an  evident  violation  of  planning 
laws  and  an"
"actionable obstruction to the Petitioner's rightful use of his access road."
"T
he  statutory  obligations  of 
the  Urban  Development  Authority  and  the"
"Maharagama  Urban  Council  are  governed  by 
the  Urban  Development"
"Authority Act No. 41 of 1978 and the Planning and Development Regulations"
"2021.  Section 28A of the Urban Development Authority Act empowers these"
"authorities  to  issue  corrective  measures,  including  demolition  orders,  to"
"address  unauthorized  constructions  within  urban  areas.  Additionally,  the"
"Planning  and  Development  Regulations  delegate  responsibilities  to 
local"
