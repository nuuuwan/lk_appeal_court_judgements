"response to claims regarding waste disposal, he asserts that the hotel adheres"
"to standard waste management practices and that there is no substantiated"
"evidence of improper waste disposal causing any significant inconvenience to"
"the Petitioner or blocking  the access road. Consequently, he argues that the"
"allegations of public health risks and safety hazards are unsubstantiated and"
"intended to unduly hinder the legitimate business operations of the hotel."
"T
he  5th  Respondent  raises  several procedural  objections  to  the  Petitioner’s"
"application  for  a  Writ  of  Mandamus.  He  first  argues  that  the  Petitioner’s"
"application is flawed due to technical deficiencies, specifically noting that the"
"Petitioner’s  affidavit  is  undated,  which  he  claims  fails  to  meet procedural"
"requirements  under 
the  Court  of  Appeal  Rules.  According 
to 
the  5th"
"Respondent, an undated affidavit compromises the validity of the Petitioner’s"
"application.  Additionally,  he contends  that the Petitioner failed to fulfill  the"
"procedural  requirement of  making  a  direct  demand  to  the  relevant public"
"officials—the  1st  to  4th  Respondents—prior 
to 
filing  the  application,  a"
"prerequisite for  mandamus relief. He  asserts that the Petitioner’s  failure to"
"follow this procedural step precludes him from seeking the writ."
"T
he 5th  Respondent  further contends  that the Petitioner’s grievances would"
"be  more appropriately  addressed  in  a  civil  court  rather than  through  writ"
"proceedings.  He argues that the issues  raised pertain primarily to  property"
"and  access  rights,  making this  matter one  of  private dispute rather than a"
"question of public duty warranting mandamus relief. He suggests that a civil"
"court is better suited to address the complexities surrounding property use,"
"ownership  claims,  and  potential  easement  rights,  and 
that  a  Writ  of"
"Mandamus is not the proper remedy under the circumstances. By pursuing"
"this  application,  he claims,  the  Petitioner is  attempting to  misuse the  writ"
"jurisdiction 
to  restrict  the  hotel’s  operations  and 
impose  unwarranted"
"limitations on  his  business,  rather than seeking a legitimate administrative"
"remedy."
"L
astly,  the  5th  Respondent  argues  that  any  interference  with  the  hotel’s"
"structure or business operations would cause significant and irreparable loss,"
"harming his established business interests and disrupting the employment of"
"staff  reliant  on  the  hotel’s  operations.  He  maintains  that  his  business"
"complies with all local regulations, and any order for demolition or structural"
"modification would be both detrimental to his livelihood and unjustified."
