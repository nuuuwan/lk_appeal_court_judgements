"5th Respondent’s  staff regularly place along the road. Additionally, the road"
"is often littered with waste from the hotel, exacerbating hygienic and  safety"
"concerns for the Petitioner and his family. The Petitioner further alleges that"
"unauthorized sewage  and  exhaust  pipes  have  led  to  hazardous  waste  and"
"smoke being directed onto the road, causing not only an obstruction but also"
"potential health hazards. The cumulative impact of these actions has led to a"
"substantial diminishment  in  the  quality of  life  for  the  Petitioner, infringing"
"upon his legal rights and creating significant daily inconveniences."
"T
he Petitioner contends that he has taken all reasonable steps to resolve this"
"matter through  formal  complaints  and  consistent  follow-ups  with  relevant"
"authorities.  On  04.12.2019,  he  filed  a  police  complaint  (P7)  detailing  the"
"interference  caused  by  the  5th  Respondent’s  encroachments  and  seeking"
"assistance to reach an amicable resolution. Following this complaint, the 5th"
"Respondent  assured  the  police  and  the  Petitioner  that  he  would  take"
"measures 
to  mitigate  the  disruptions  and 
ensure 
the  road 
remained"
"unobstructed. However, despite this assurance, the 5th Respondent continued"
"the  unauthorized  use 
of 
the 
road, 
and  no 
corrective  actions  were"
"implemented, forcing the Petitioner to seek further recourse."
"S
ubsequent  to  the  police  complaint, 
the  Petitioner  contacted  both 
the"
"Maharagama Urban Council and the Urban Development Authority – the 1st"
"and 
2nd  Respondents, 
formally 
notifying 
them 
of 
the  unauthorized"
"constructions  and 
requesting  enforcement  action.  On  07.02.2020, 
he"
"submitted a letter to the Urban  Council  (P9)  reiterating his  grievances and"
"requesting intervention. In addition, he filed a letter of demand to the Urban"
"Council  and 
the  Chairman  of 
the  Urban  Development  Authority  on"
"22.06.2020  (P10(a) and P10(b)), setting out the specifics of the encroachments"
"and urging the authorities to uphold building compliance laws."
"I
n response, the Urban Development Authority sent a letter dated 20.07.2020"
"(P11), instructing the 5th Respondent to submit a revised plan that complied"
"with regulatory standards,  noting the unauthorized modifications.  However,"
"despite this directive, the 5th Respondent failed to submit an amended plan,"
"and  the  authorities  did  not  take 
further  action  to  enforce  compliance."
"Additionally,  by 
letter  dated  21.12.2020 
(P13), 
the  Urban  Development"
"Authority  notified  the  Maharagama  Urban  Council  of 
the  unauthorized"
"constructions  and  advised  them  to  take  corrective  steps.  Despite  these"
"documented 
interactions  and 
the  clear 
legal  violations,  no  substantial"
"enforcement  action  was 
taken  by 
the  Urban  Council  or 
the  Urban"
"Development Authority to address the unauthorized structures."
