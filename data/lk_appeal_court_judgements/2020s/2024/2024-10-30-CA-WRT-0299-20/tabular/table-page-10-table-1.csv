"councils  to  monitor  compliance,  enforce  building  standards,  and  address"
"grievances related to unauthorized constructions."
"I
n this case, the evidence suggests that the 1st to 4th Respondents have failed"
"to fulfill their regulatory duties, despite multiple documented complaints and"
"evidence of  unauthorized construction provided  by the Petitioner. The letter"
"from  the  Urban  Development  Authority  dated  21.12.2020 
(P13)  explicitly"
"identifies  the  unauthorized  nature  of  the  5th  Respondent’s  building  and"
"instructs local authorities to ensure compliance. Similarly, correspondences"
"and reports, including the field inspection report (3R2) and directives from the"
"Urban Council (3R8), underscore the regulatory authorities’ awareness of the"
"noncompliance, yet no enforcement action was taken to rectify the situation."
"T
he  Petitioner  has  demonstrated  that  he  attempted  to  resolve  this  issue"
"through administrative channels,  including  filing  complaints  and  providing"
"evidence 
to 
both 
the  Urban  Council,  Maharagama  and 
the  Urban"
"Development Authority. The  Petitioner’s actions  fulfill  the preconditions  for"
"mandamus relief, as  he has  repeatedly sought corrective action  from  these"
"authorities.  Given 
the 
clear 
statutory  duty 
to  address  unauthorized"
"constructions and the Respondents' neglect of this duty, the Court is inclined"
"to  positively 
observe 
the  Petitioner’s 
entitlement 
to  mandamus 
relief"
"compelling  the  1st  to  4th  Respondents  to  enforce  compliance  with  building"
"standards 
by  addressing 
the  unauthorized  constructions 
on 
the  5th"
"Respondent’s property."
"T
he  5th  Respondent  has 
raised  several  procedural  objections 
to 
the"
"Petitioner’s  application  for  a  Writ  of  Mandamus.  These  objections  include"
"assertions that the Petitioner’s affidavit was undated, that no formal demand"
"was made on the 1st to 4th Respondents, and that the matter is better suited"
"to civil court proceedings."
"T
he Court finds  that these procedural objections  are insufficient  to  bar the"
"issuance  of  relief.  First,  an  undated  affidavit,  while  procedurally  irregular,"
"does  not  negate  the  substantive  grounds  for  mandamus  relief,  especially"
"where substantial evidence demonstrates a failure of  statutory duty by  the"
"Respondents.  Secondly,  the Petitioner has  clearly made sufficient  efforts  to"
"engage the Respondents, as evidenced by numerous complaints, letters, and"
"requests for intervention (P7, P9, and P10), which were met with either partial"
"responses  or  inaction.  The  Respondents' 
failure  to  respond  substantively"
"fulfills the demand requirement inherent in a mandamus application."
"T
he argument that the Petitioner should seek recourse in civil court is without"
"merit. Mandamus  is  an  appropriate  remedy here, given  that  the Petitioner"
