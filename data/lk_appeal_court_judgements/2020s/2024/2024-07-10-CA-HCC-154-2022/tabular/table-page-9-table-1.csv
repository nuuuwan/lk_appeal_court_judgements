"I find no basis to consider the alleged failure of the police investigators to record"
"statements from the friends of the victim child with whom she had been playing"
"at the time of the incident or members of the relevant household, as a reason to"
"doubt the evidence of the victim child or to conclude that the prosecution has"
"failed to prove the charges."
"The  evidence  of  the  child  is  clear  that  after  the  incident,  she  came  home  and"
"informed her father about what happened. Thereafter, the father has taken the"
"child to the police and the statement of the child has been promptly recorded by"
"the  police  officers  in  that  regard.  Although  it  appears  that  the  victim  child’s"
"father’s statement has been recorded after a lapse of more than 1 year from the"
"incident,  the  said  lapse  by  the  part  of  the  investigating  officers  cannot  be"
"attributed as a doubt in relation to the evidence led at the Court. The evidence"
"of the victim child as well as her father corroborates the sequence of events and"
"are consistent with each other."
"I find no basis to doubt the evidence of both the witnesses. The evidence clearly"
"establishes the fact that when these incidents occurred, the mother of the victim"
"child was not at home and she was unaware of the incident and would not be"
"able to say anything relevant to the incident proper, other than staying with the"
"child  at  the  hospital.  Therefore,  I  find  no  reason  to  consider  the  failure  of  the"
"prosecution to call her as a witness in terms of section 114 illustration (f) of the"
"Evidence Ordinance as there is no basis to consider if produced, such evidence"
"would be unfavourable to the prosecution’s case."
"When it comes to a history of an incident narrated to a JMO or any other Medical"
"Officer as to an incident, it is settled law that such a history does not amount to"
"corroboration,  but  a  matter  of  consistency  as  to  the  evidence  of  the  relevant"
"witnesses."
