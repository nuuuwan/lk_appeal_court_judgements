"Although the child has attempted to scream, it has not attracted anyone. After"
"the act, the appellant has given two mandarins to her and asked her to go home."
"When she returned home, only her father had been at the house and the child"
"has narrated to him what happened to her. The father has taken her to the police"
"station where she has made a statement, and a doctor has examined her at the"
"hospital."
"The child has been cross-examined on the basis that although an incident may"
"have occurred, she was not sure as to the identity of the person who committed"
"sexual  abuse  to  her.  It  appears  that  this  line  of  cross-examination  has  been"
"based  on  the  evidence  of  the  child  where  she  identified  the  perpetrator  of  the"
"crime only as the uncle (මාමා). However, it is abundantly clear from the evidence"
"of the child that the appellant was not a stranger to her, but a person well known"
"to her, although she has had no regular contacts with him. It appears that the"
"child has come to know the appellant’s name as Wimale (විමලේ) subsequent to"
"the incident, which may have been the reason why she has referred to him as"
"Wimale Maama (විමලේ මාමා) in her evidence."
"The fact that the victim child was a minor under the age of 16 years has been an"
"admitted fact during the trial."
"According to the evidence of the father of the child (PW-02), he has come home"
"around 3.30 in the afternoon after attending to his day’s work. At that time, his"
"youngest son and the wife’s mother had been at home. When inquired about the"
"victim  child,  he  has  been  informed  that  she  went  to  play  at  the  neighbour’s"
"house,  which  was  not  unusual  for  him.  Sometime  later,  the  child  has  come"
"crying with two mandarins in her hand, and has informed that Wimale Maama"
"(විමලේ මාමා) dragged her to the forest and committed a sexual act on her. Since"
"his wife was not home at that time, he has immediately taken the child to the"
"police  station  and  informed  of  the  incident.  The  person  mentioned  as  Wimale"
"Maama (විමලේ මාමා) by the victim child was a neighbour well known to him."
