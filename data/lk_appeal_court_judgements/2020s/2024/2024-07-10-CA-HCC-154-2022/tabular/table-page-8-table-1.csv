"alleged  history  of  the  incident  narrated  by  the  child  to  the  JMO  could  not  be"
"considered since it is clear that it was the mother of the child who has given the"
"history to the doctor. The learned Counsel pointed out the evidence of the victim"
"child in that regard which appears at page 86 of the appeal brief to support his"
"contention."
"The  learned  Counsel  also  invited  the  Court  to  consider  the  failure  by  the"
"prosecution to call the mother of the victim child as a witness in terms of section"
"114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance in favour of the appellant."
"In relation to the improbabilities raised as a ground of appeal, it was contended"
"that if the child was dragged by the appellant as claimed, there should have been"
"injuries  on  her  and  since  there  were  no  injuries,  such  a  narrative  cannot  be"
"considered probable. In relation to the omissions as claimed, it was pointed out"
"that when questioned by the learned Counsel who represented the appellant at"
"the  trial,  the  child  has  stated  that  as  far  as  she  can  remember,  she  told  the"
"uncle’s  name  to  her  father,  whereas  it has  been  pointed  out  that  she  has  not"
"stated that in her police statement."
"In the victim child’s evidence, she has stated that when she refused to go with"
"the appellant, he took her despite her protests and when he removed her clothes"
"and started performing intercrural sex on her, she screamed. When the evidence"
"of the victim child is taken as a whole, it is clear that the screaming of a 6-and-"
"a-half-year-old child when a grown-up person subject her to intercrural sex, may"
"not  be  what  one  that  can  be  expected  to  be  heard  by  a  person  even  a  little"
"distance  away  from  the  place  of  the  incident.  The  evidence  is  clear  that  the"
"incident has occurred in an abandoned house not frequented by the neighbours."
"A person who is committing grave sexual abuse on a child or any sexual act done"
"without  consent  would  normally  make  sure  that  his  actions  are  not  being"
"witnessed  by  anyone,  else  unless  it  is  an  unexpected  sighting  by  a  witness.  I"
"have no basis to agree that the child’s evidence in that regard was improbable or"
"not trustworthy merely because no one has heard her screams."
