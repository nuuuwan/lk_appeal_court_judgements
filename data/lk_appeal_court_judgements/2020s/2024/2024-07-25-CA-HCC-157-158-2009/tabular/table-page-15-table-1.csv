"1995, five years after the incident and the complainant Sarathsena has"
"failed to explain the long delay satisfactorily and cogently."
"In the said case, when the complainant was questioned about the long"
"delay in making the complaint to the police in respect of the robbery"
"that  took  place  on  the  night  of  28.  12.  1989,  he  had  taken  up  the"
"position that the police were not accepting complaints from the public"
"during  the  period.  At  the  same  time,  he  tried  to  explain  the  delay  by"
"saying  that  due  to  the  fear  he  had  that his  family  may  be  destroyed,"
"presumably by the police, he did not make a complaint to the police."
"According to the complainant, it was upon hearing that the government"
"had  requested  the  public  to  make  complaints  in  respect  of  missing"
"persons to the commissions, that he decided to make a complaint."
"The  Court  of  Appeal  held  as  follows:  “We  cannot  accept  this  position"
"taken  up  by  the  complainant  that  till  1995,  he  could  not  make  a"
"complaint to the police with regard to the robbery, due to the reasons"
"given by him as referred to above. Even assuming that during the period"
"1989 to 1990, there was a fear psychosis that prevailed in the country,"
"it is common knowledge that by 1991 conditions had improved and it"
"was possible for any citizen to lodge a complaint at any police station.”"
"As stated previously, the contention of both the learned Counsel for the"
"appellants was that the father of the victim, PW-1 just waited and only"
"after six years and four months, he made a complaint to the police. At"
"this stage, it is vital to consider why the belatedness raises a reasonable"
"doubt on the prosecution case. The main reason is that when there was"
"a  possibility  to  make  a  complaint  immediately  and  the  complainant"
"does  not  make  a  complaint,  a  reasonable  doubt  arises  whether  he"
"fabricated  a  story  and  then  made  a  complaint.  In  the  case  at  hand,"
"PW-1 explained in his evidence, how he attempted to make a complaint"
"to the police. He stated that the very next day of the incident, the 8th of"
"July, he went to the Meegahawatta police station to make a complaint,"
