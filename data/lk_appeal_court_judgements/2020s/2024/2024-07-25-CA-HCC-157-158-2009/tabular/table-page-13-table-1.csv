"The decision of Sumanasena V. Attorney-General – (1999) 3 Sri L.R."
"137 is as follows:"
"“Just because the witness is a belated witness, Court ought not to reject"
"his testimony on that score alone, Court must inquire into the reason"
"for the delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable"
"the Court could act on the evidence of a belated witness”."
"Submitting  the  following  two  decided  cases,  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel for the 1st appellant and the learned Counsel for the 2nd, 3rd"
"and  5th  appellants  contended  that  according  to  these  decisions,  the"
"father of the victim (PW-1) could have made a complaint in 1991, even"
"if it is assumed that the situation of the country was bad in the period"
"that the incident relating to this case occurred."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  2nd,  3rd  and  5th  appellants  cited  the"
"Judgment of  Udagama  V.  Attorney  General – (2000) 2 Sri  L.R.  103,"
"and contended that in this case, even the explanation given for a delay"
"of 15 months had not been considered as an acceptable explanation for"
"the  delay.  In  the  aforesaid  case,  there  were  three  main  prosecution"
"witnesses, namely; Piyaseeli, Karunadasa and Premasiri. Piyaseeli had"
"made a belated statement to the police, 15 months after the incident. It"
"was held that the explanation given by her that the delay was due to"
"the  situation  that  prevailed  in  the  country  is  unacceptable,  for  the"
"reason that her own brother Karunadasa who gave evidence at the trial"
"and  her  mother  Alisnona,  had  made  statements  to  the  police  on  the"
"very  next  day  after  the  incident.  Not  accepting  the  explanation  of"
"Piyaseeli for the delay is apparent in this case. Victim’s mother and her"
"own brother had made statements to the police on the very next day"
"after the incident. Therefore, the Court of Appeal correctly held that if"
"the victim’s mother and her brother could have made statements the"
"very  next  day  after  the  incident,  Piyaseeli  could  have  also  made  a"
"statement without such a delay."
