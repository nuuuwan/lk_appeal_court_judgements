"but the OIC informed that it is not necessary to make a complaint and"
"the OIC had told him to go to the Peliyagoda police station. Then PW-1"
"went to the Peliyagoda police station and met Douglas Peiris (Douglas"
"Peiris is the 1st accused of this case). Then he said “Udayachandra is"
"there, younger son ran away”, but in the Peliyagoda Police Station also,"
"a complaint had not been recorded. These items of evidence have not"
"been  disputed.  Therefore,  it  is  precisely  clear  that  PW-1  went  to  the"
"police stations to make a complaint immediately after the incident, but"
"police had not recorded his complaint. Hence, the argument that PW-1"
"just kept quiet for six years and only after six years, he wanted to make"
"a complaint is completely wrong."
"In addition, citing the case of Jayawardena & others V. The State, both"
"the learned Counsel contended that in this case, it was observed that"
"the conditions had improved in 1991 and it was possible for any citizen"
"to lodge a complaint at any police station. In the case before us, after"
"realizing  that 
it

"made  a  complaint  about  the  disappearance  of  his  son  through  an"
"application  of  Habeas  Corpus  when  the  conditions  had  improved  in"
"1991.  As  the  Case  No.  of  the  Habeas  Corpus  application  is  13/91,  it"
"seems  that  the  said  application  has  been  filed  in  1991.  Hence,  soon"
"after the conditions had improved in 1991, as observed in the aforesaid"
"case of Jayawardena & others V. The State, PW-1 made a complaint to"
"Court  of  Appeal 
the 
through  Habeas  Corpus  application  about"
"disappearance of his son, Rathnachandra."
"When an illegal act is committed by a person and causes injustice or"
"harm to another person, he normally goes to the nearest police station"
"and makes a complaint. However, the police station is not the only place"
"to make a complaint. According to Section 136(1)(a) of the CCPA, on a"
"complaint made orally or in writing to a Magistrate that an offence has"
"been committed, which such court has jurisdiction either to inquire into"
