"However,  facts  of  the  instant  case  are  completely  different  from  the"
"aforesaid case. The father of the victim, PW-1 explained in his testimony"
"in  the  non-summary  inquiry,  the  terrible  situation  prevailed  in  the"
"country at that time. Both of his sons were taken away by the police."
"One of his sons, Udayachandra, was tortured severely, thereafter, kept"
"in  the  Peliyagoda  Police  for  about  two  and  half  months  and  then,  he"
"was  detained  in  the  “Punani  Camp”  for  about  one  and  a  half  years."
"Thereafter  only  he  could  come  home  according  to  his  evidence.  The"
"father  could  not  see  his  younger  son,  Rathnachandra  again,  after  he"
"was taken by the police officers. Not only that, the father, PW-1 stated"
"in his evidence at the non-summary inquiry that he came to know the"
"Attorneys-at-Law  Kanchana  Abeypala  and  Lankapura  were  also"
"murdered  during  this  time.  He  has  instructed  an  Attorney-at-Law"
"Liyanaarachchi to file Habeas Corpus application regarding his younger"
"son,  but  PW-1  learnt  that  the  said  lawyer  had  also  brought  to  the"
"Sapugaskanda Police Station and murdered. In a situation where even"
"the lawyers were murdered in this way and especially when he came to"
"know that the lawyer through whom he wanted to file a Habeas Corpus"
"application  was  also  murdered  in  a  police  station,  it  is  obvious  that"
"PW-1 was not in a  position to make a  complaint to the police during"
"that time."

"Counsel  for  the  2nd,  3rd,  and  5th  appellants  submitted  the  case  of"
