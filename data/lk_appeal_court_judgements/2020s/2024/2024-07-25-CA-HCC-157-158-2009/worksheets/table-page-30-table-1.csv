"In the case of The Queen V. Mahatun - 61 NLR 540 it was held that"
"“Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed"
"by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,"
"each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done"
"by  him  alone.  If  each  of  several  persons  commits  a  different  criminal"
"act, each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each"
"of them is liable for each, such as if it were done by him alone”."
"It was held further; “To establish the existence of a common intention"
"it  is  not  essential  to  prove  that  the  criminal  act  was  done  in  concert"
"pursuant to a pre-arranged plan. A common intention can come into"
"existence without pre-arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the"
"moment”."
"In Sarath Kumara V. Attorney General – C.A. No. 207/2008, Decided"
"on  04.04.2014,  it  was  held  that  “….  once  a  participatory  presence  in"
"furtherance of a common intention is established at the commencement"
"of an incident, there is no requirement that both perpetrators should"
"be physically present at the culmination of the event, unless it could be"
"shown  by  some  overt  act  that  one  perpetrator  deliberately  withdrew"
"from  the  situation  to  disengage  and  detach  himself  from  vicarious"
"liability.”"
