"the  van,  however,  one  police  officer  pointed  a  gun  to  his  chest  and"
"shouted  “නාකියා  යෙදර  ගිහින්  යදාර  වහ  ෙනින්”.  This  is  the  initial  step  of"
"abduction."
"I
n  this  case,  there  is  ample  evidence  about  the  arrest,  torture,  and"
"detention  with  regard  to  the  brother  of  the  victim,  PW-3.  The  Court"
"posed  the  question  to  the  learned  ASG  whether  there  is  sufficient"
"evidence with regard to the victim to prove that he has been kidnapped"
"or  abducted  in  order  to  murder.  I  must  say  that  the  learned  ASG"
"assisted 
this  Court  by  pointing  out  very  clearly,  accurately  and"
"impartially the relevant items of evidence that are necessary to prove"
"the 5th charge."
"W
hen the appellants went to PW-3’s  residence, they got the victim to"
"call his brother PW-3 and then, PW-3 was also taken into custody.    As"
"stated previously, PW-3 also identified 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th appellants as"
"the persons came with some others to arrest him. Although, he did not"
"speak about 1st appellant’s presence at that time, his common intention"
"with  the  2nd,  3rd  and  4th  appellants  is  apparent  from  the  evidence  of"
"PW-1 and PW-2 that the 1st appellant came with the police team when"
"Rathnachandra was taken in to their custody, and in the subsequent"
"morning  around  5/5.30, 
the  1st  appellant  came  with  OIC  Lalith"
"Mahanama and informed PW-1 that his son (victim) escaped from their"
"custody."
"T
he 1st appellant has not given evidence or not made a dock statement."
"A  witness  was  called  on  behalf  of  him  but  the  said  witness  has  not"
"stated anything material to this case. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th appellants"
"have  given  evidence  on  oaths.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"analyzed 
the  defence  evidence  and  correctly  concluded 
that  no"
"reasonable  doubt  casts  on  the  prosecution  case  due  to  the  defence"
"evidence. Another important matter arises from the evidence of the 2nd,"
"3rd, 4th and 5th appellants is that they all speak only about the arrest of"
