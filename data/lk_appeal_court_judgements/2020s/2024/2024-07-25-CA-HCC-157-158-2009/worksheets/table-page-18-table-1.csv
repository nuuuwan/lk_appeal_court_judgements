"Samaradasa Perera stated in his evidence that he gave those two names"
"to the Attorney Mr. Gomes to whom he had entrusted the filing of the"
"Habeas Corpus application. However, PW-1 stated that his Attorney had"
"filed 
the  Habeas  Corpus  application  only  against  Douglas  Peiris."
"Therefore,  not  filing  the  Habeas  Copus  application  against  the  2nd"
