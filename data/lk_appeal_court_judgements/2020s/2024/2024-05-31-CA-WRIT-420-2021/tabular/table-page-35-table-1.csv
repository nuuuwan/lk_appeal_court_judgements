"CA/Writ/420/2021 referring to section 22A (12) of the FFPO asserts that the Sri Lankan"
"elephant is expressly declared as ‘public property’ in terms of the FFPO, and consequently all"
"offences committed against an elephant, including the offence of unlawful possession of an"
"elephant, are punishable under the said Offences Against Public Property Act read together"
"with the provisions of the FFPO."
"The Petitioners contend that Regulation 5(2) of the impugned Regulations is untenable in law"
"and contrary to sections 22A (7), 22A (12) and 23 of the FFPO. Further, the Petitioners submit"
"that Regulation 6(2) is also contrary to section 22A of the FFPO and untenable in law. In"
"addition  to  the  above,  the  Petitioners  challenge  the  Regulations  6(3)4  and  7(1)5  as  well."
"Similarly, several concerns have been raised by the Petitioners in respect of Regulation 8."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners in CA/Writ/420/2021 contends that if a"
"person purportedly owns or has in his custody or possession an elephant or makes use of an"
"elephant, he must mandatorily show that the said elephant is registered and a license has been"
"obtained in respect thereof in terms of section 22A of the FFPO. In the event the elephant is"
"without  registration  and  a  license,  such  purported  custodian/owner  is  deemed  to  have"
"committed a non-bailable offence punishable under section 22A (7) or 23 (1) of the FFPO and"
"the Offences Against Public Property Act. Another important argument raised by the learned"
