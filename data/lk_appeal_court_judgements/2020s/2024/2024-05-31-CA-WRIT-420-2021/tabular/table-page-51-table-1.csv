"However,  I  have  a  reasonable  doubt  as  to  how  the  impugned  regulations  as  prescribed  in"
"Regulation 15 declare that the ‘licence fee’ or ‘licence renewal fee’ should be credited to the"
"Wildlife  Conservation  Fund  without  adhering  to  the  rules/law  relating  to  the  government"
"revenue  of  the  country.    None  of  the  Petitioners  have  substantially  challenged  the  said"
"regulation  and  no  adequate  submissions  have  been  made  upon  the  same.  Therefore,  this"
"Court is unable to make any determination on the said Regulation 15."
"Merits  of  the  Submissions  of  the  Petitioners  and  Respondents  on  the  provisions  of  Part  I  of  the"
"impugned Regulations"
"The  Petitioners  in  CA/Writ/423/2021  and  CA/Writ/431/2021  challenge  inter  alia,  the"
"provisions  of Part I  of  the  impugned  Regulations. The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner in CA/Writ/431/2021 referring to the long title of the FFPO submits that any and"
"all commercial uses of Fauna and Flora shall be deemed to be misuses in terms of FFPO. He"
"further  submits  that  not  even  tamed/domesticated  elephants  can  be  used  for  commercial"
"purposes and such a position is corroborated by the fact that the FFPO does not recognize or"
"provide  for  any  permitted  commercial  uses.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  in"
"CA/Writ/423/2021 submitted that although the intended effect of the FFPO is inter alia the"
"prevention  of  the  commercial  and  other  misuses  of  the  Fauna  and  Flora,  the  impugned"
"Regulations  have  permitted  elephants  to  be  used  for  tourism,  tourist  safari  rides,  towing"
"vehicles, transporting timber, for cinema shooting or any other similar activities."
"For clarity and better adjudication, I must reproduce the provisions which need to be adhered"
"to  by  every  person  who  owns  or  has  in  custody  an  elephant  according  to  Part  I  of  the"
"impugned Regulations."
