"commercial  exploitation  regarding  tamed  elephants  and  such  has  been  further  assured  by"
"amending the long title of the FFPO."
"The learned DSG contends that the inquiry against the perpetrators in reference to tampering"
"with the Register of Elephants maintained by the Director General of Wildlife Conservation"
"was pending and several issues had cropped up due to the incomplete Register since 2015. It"
"must be stressed that the Register of Elephant (‘අලි ප ොත’) was summoned by this Court on"
"our own motion and at that time it was under the custody of the Registrar of the High Court"
"of Colombo. Both my brother and I perused the said Register and the Registrar of this Court"
"subsequently was ordered to return it to the Registrar of the High Court of Colombo. It is"
"noted  that  none  of  the  Respondents  have  tendered  to  court  any  acceptable  evidence  of"
"tampering with the said Register and thus, such alleged assertions have become a mere blanket"
"application without focusing on the elephants who were subjected to the relevant cases in the"
"respective Magistrate’s Courts."
"She  asserts  that  the  impugned  Regulations  were  published  as  no  adequate  measures  were"
"available in the previous set of regulations published in 1991 for the protection and well-being"
"of the tamed elephants. The learned DSG's perspective is that if this Court decides to quash"
"the impugned Regulations, there will be no regulations in place for the protection, well-being,"
"and registration of tamed elephants, as the previous regulations have not only been rescinded"
"but were also never approved by Parliament. Another key argument of the leaned DSG is that"
"the Petitioners are not entitled to challenge the orders of the respective Magistrate’s Court"
"under the provisions of Article 140 of the Constitution."
"Several learned Counsel who appears for the Respondents other than the State officials have"
"not  made  submissions  justifying  the  issuance  of  the  impugned  Regulations  and  its  alleged"
"legality. Those Respondents mainly contend that they have not been identified as suspects in"
"the relevant Magistrate’s Court cases and are not liable for any offense under the FFPO. The"
"inference  that  attempted  to  be  made  particularly  by  the  added  Respondents  is  that  the"
"elephants subjected to the respective Magistrate’s Court cases have not been captured from"
"the jungle."
