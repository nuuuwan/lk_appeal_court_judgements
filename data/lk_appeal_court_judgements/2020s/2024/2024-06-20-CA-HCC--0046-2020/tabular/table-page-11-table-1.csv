"In  Bhargavan  v.State  of  Kerala  AIR  2004  SC  1058  (Supreme  Court  of"
"India)"
"“At para 20: So far as non-disclosure of names to the doctor, same is"
"really  of  no  consequence.  As  rightly  noted  by  the  Courts  below,  his"
"primary duty is to treat the patient and not find out by whom the injury"
"was caused”."
"Although the victim had not revealed to the doctor about the sexual abuse"
"committed  on  her  in  her  history,  the  doctor  had  not  excluded  the  alleged"
"sexual abuse involving the genital area."
"The Learned High Court Judge, while accepting the Medico-Legal Report and"
"Medico-Legal Examination Form marked as P1 and P2 respectively, stated in"
"the  judgement  that  even  though  there  are  certain  mistakes  made  in  the"
"report,  such  errors  can  be  called  as  practical  errors,  which  can  be"
"disregarded."
"As the finding of the doctor is immensely consistent with the evidence given"
"by the victim in court, there is no justification for undervaluing the victim’s"
"testimony in this case."
"Finally, the Counsel for the Appellant submits that the prosecution had not"
"proven their case beyond reasonable doubt."
"In this case, the creditworthiness of the evidence given by the victim did not"
"suffer  at  any  stage  of  the  trial.  No  contradictions  were  highlighted  in  her"
"evidence.  Three  minor  omissions  were  highlighted  are  not  capable  of"
"attacking the core of the case. The learned High Court Judge had considered"
"the evidence given by PW1 with caution and care and correctly held that her"
"evidence is convincing and cogent and sufficient on its own to prove the case"
"against the Appellant."
"The victim’s evidence is further supported by the evidence given by her father"
"P2 and her mother PW3."
