"Hence, the argument put forward by the Learned Counsel under the grounds"
"of  appeal  cannot  be  accepted.  Further,  as  stated  above,  in  this  case  the"
"prosecution had adduced all necessary witnesses to prove their case."
"In  sexual  offence  cases,  corroboration  is  not  a  sine  qua  non  to  secure  a"
"conviction. As long as the victimâ€™s evidence does not suffer from ambiguity"
"or infirmity in a manner which affects the root of the case, there is no bar for"
"the court to act and rely on the said evidence to decide the case."
"Considering  the  evidence  led  in  this  case  and  guided  by  the  judgements"
"mentioned above, I conclude that this is not an appropriate  case in which"
"the judgement delivered by the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura on"
"22/05/2020  against  the  Appellant  can  be  interfered  upon.  I  therefore,"
"dismiss the appeal."
"Considering  all  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  we  order  the  sentence  be"
"effective from the date judgment, i.e.; on 22/05/2020."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High"
"Court of Ratnapura along with the original case record."
