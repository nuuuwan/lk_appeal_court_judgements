"Strengthening  the  Sovereignty  of  People  in  Sri  Lanka23,”  C.  S.  Kodikara"
"reproduces the following quotation,"
"“A  popular  Government,  without  popular  information,  or  the  means  of"
"acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both."
"Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be"
"their  own  Governors,  must  arm  themselves  with  the  power  which"
"knowledge gives.” - James Madison [1822]"
