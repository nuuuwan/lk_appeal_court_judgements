"whom Lord Neuberger P, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson and Lord Hughes"
"agreed) said about “The Constitutional right of access to the courts”, that,"
"“66. The constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the rule"
"of  law.  The  importance  of  the  rule  of law  is  not  always  understood."
"Indications  of  a  lack  of  understanding  include  the  assumption  that"
"the administration of justice is merely a public service like any other,"
"that courts and tribunals are providers of services to the “users” who"
"appear  before  them,  and  that  the  provision  of  those  services  is  of"
"value only to the users themselves and to those who are remunerated"
"for their participation in the proceedings. The extent to which that"
"viewpoint has gained currency in recent times is apparent from the"
"consultation papers and reports discussed earlier.  It is epitomised in"
"the assumption that the consumption of ET and EAT services without full"
"cost recovery results in a loss to society, since “ET and EAT use does not"
"lead to gains to society that exceed the sum of the gains to consumers and"
"producers of these services”."
