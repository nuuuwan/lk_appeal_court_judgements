"Writing the opinion of the Court Chief Justice Sripavan said, among other things,"
"“Thus,  the  “freedom  of  speech  and  expression  including  publication”"
"which includes an implicit right to secure relevant information should be"
"broadly  interpreted  in  the  light  of  fundamental  principles  of  democracy"
"and  the  Rule  of  Law  which  form  the  foundation  of  the  Constitution,"
"subject  however  to  such  restrictions  and  to  the  extent  provided  in"
"the Constitution.”"
