"(b) Article 154(1) of the Constitution and"
"(c)  The fact that having financial control is a “controlling interest”"
"the petitioners Litro Gas Lanka Limited and Litro Gas Terminal Lanka (Private)"
"Limited are “public authorities” under the Right to Information Act."
"For a moment, if it is assumed that the state is company A, SLIC is company B"
"and the present petitioners are company C, we are dealing with a hierarchical"
"structure of companies. Let us break it down:"
"Company A: This is the parent company. It directly owns the majority shares in"
"Company B."
"We can think of it like a family tree: Company A is the grandparent, Company B"
"is the parent, and Company C is the child. Each level of ownership and influence"
"cascades down the chain."
"For instance, if Company A holds a majority stake in Company B, it can appoint"
"members to Company B’s board of directors, participate in significant decisions,"
"and provide financial support when needed. Similarly, Company B exerts similar"
"influence over Company C."
"Here the state holds 99.7 per cent shares of SLIC which in turn holds 99.3 per"
"centum share of Litro Gas Lanka Limited and 100 per cent shares of Litro Gas"
"Terminal Lanka (Private) Limited."
"Hence the petitioners come under the provision in article 154 which says,"
