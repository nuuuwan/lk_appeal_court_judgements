"The petitioner states that any arrest for being involved with the Welikada prison riots would"
"have  substantially  increased  the  security  threat  towards  him  as  8  of  the  most  notorious"
"underworld leaders died in the said arrest and those in the network both within and outside"
"prison would seek to avenge their deaths and the petitioner would naturally become a target."
"Furthermore, after being transferred to Mahara Prison, the petitioner did not have the same"
"level of protection he had when he was at the Intelligence and Security Unit. When he was in"
"the  Intelligence  and  Security Unit,  he  had  a  driver  and two  armed  guards,  protecting  him."
"However, after he was transferred to Mahara Prison, he was deprived of armed protection."
"U
nder these circumstances, the petitioner had to leave Sri Lanka on 22nd January 2018 with"
"no other choice and seek asylum in the United States of America as an extreme measure of"
"having to save his life."
