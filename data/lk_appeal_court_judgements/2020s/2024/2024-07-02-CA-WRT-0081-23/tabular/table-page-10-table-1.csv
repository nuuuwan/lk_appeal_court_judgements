"The petitioner had submitted an appeal to the PSC on 2nd February 2021 bearing no: 244733."
"In the said appeal he has stated as follows and further establishes the fact that he had no"
"intention to vacate his post but had taken a temporary measure to protect his life and liberty."
"It is Important to note that the Secretary to the State Ministry of Prison Reforms and Prison"
"Rehabilitation by letter dated 11th June 2021 and the State Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs"
"and Constitutional Reforms by letter dated 22nd February 2022 to the Secretary to the Public"
"Service  Commission  recommended  that the  petitioner  be  reinstated  back  in  service  in  the"
"Prisons Department."
"Despite the recommendations for the petitioner to be reinstated back into the public service,"
"the PSC rejected the petitioner's appeal as it had been tendered out of time. The PSC with"
"neither hearing nor determining the appeal had rejected the same due to it being outside the"
"time limit for submitting appeals. However, the PSC has the discretion to hear an appeal even"
"if it is filed out of time, given the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the sole basis on which"
"the PSC had chosen to reject the appeal of the petitioner was on the basis that the appeal had"
"been tendered outside the time limit for submitting appeals. Quite apart from the question"
"as to whether a right of appeal should be restricted by the PSC by enforcing a time limit, the"
"rules of the PSC allow that the Commission is able to consider an appeal even though it has"
"been tendered outside the time limits since it is quite evident that the circumstances in which"
"the petitioner had to flee the country are exceptional. There was a real threat to his liberty"
"and to his life. The letter of vacation of post itself was sent to his address in Sri Lanka when"
"he was in the United States. Owing to this, calculation of the time period and rigidly applying"
"that three monthsâ€™ rule is unreasonable and unfair."
"Subsequently, the petitioner preferred an appeal to the AAT."
"The PSC in its observations sent to AAT has admitted that the reason that the petitioner left"
"his service was not because of a mental intention to abandon his post never to return but"
"because  of  the  unlawful  legal  action  that  was  imminent.  Furthermore,  baselessly,  the  PSC"
"continued to harp on and make reference to criminal proceedings against the petitioner even"
"after the petitioner was acquitted of all charges. It is neither the jurisdiction nor the concern"
"of the PSC to ensure that suspects appear in Court. That is the function of the Court itself and"
"the police."
"T
he AAT by its order dated 29th November 2022 refused to recommend that the petitioner be"
"reinstated back in his service and ordered that he be retired from service stating that the PSC"
"does not support his reinstatement in service and further stating that the petitioner did not"
"make a police complaint nor did he inform the Head of the Department of Prisons as regards"
"the threat to his life and that of his family."
