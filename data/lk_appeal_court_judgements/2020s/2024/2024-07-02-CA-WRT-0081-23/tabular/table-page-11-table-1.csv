"A
 portion of the said order is as follows:"
"‘It appears to this tribunal that his service record had been very good, which indicates that he"
"has  had  about  23  commendation  reports.  When  he  vacated  post  he  held  the  post  of"
"Additional Superintendent of Prisons...it is evident that up to a point the appellant would be"
"considered as suitable material for the Department of Prisons. Unfortunately, the VOP came"
"in between and the starting point according to the appellant may have been on prison riot."
"The PSC does not support his reinstatement in services as stated above, which also cannot be"
"disputed so easily.’"
"The said order is bad in law for the reason that the AAT has a duty to consider every aspect"
"of the case and decide for itself. It’s clear that AAT has lamentably failed in doing so and had"
"surrendered its discretion to the PSC, stating that the position of the PSC cannot be disputed"
"so easily. The function of the AAT is to examine issues independently."
"In R v Home Secretary ex parte Walsh [1992] COD 240, the decision of the Home Secretary"
"was quashed as he failed to decide and act upon the issue by himself but adopted the advice"
"of a judge or parole board with regard to prisoners and thus acted as a rubber stamp."
"The AAT has failed to consider that  requiring a person who  is about to be arrested by the"
"police, that he must make a complaint to the police appears to be unfair and even absurd."
"The police would be the last place he would want to go in such circumstances. Moreover, the"
"AAT has failed to appreciate the fact that the petitioner left the country in order to safeguard"
"himself from an illegal, arbitrary, unjust and unfair arrest, they simply accepted the position"
"of  the  PSC  that  there  was  a  valid  VOP.  The  AAT  has  failed  to  appreciate  that  in  fact  his"
"superiors were aware of the threat to his life. Under these circumstances the order of the AAT"
"appears to be irrational and unreasonable."
"The respondents have disregarded the key issues aforementioned that have been raised in"
"this  application  by  the  petitioner.  Furthermore,  the  fact  that  the  petitioner  had  been"
"acquitted from the criminal proceedings against him for murder during Welikada Prison riots"
"which  appears  that  the  petitioner  has  been  falsely  accused  of  and  the  fact  that  two"
"recommendations were sent by the Secretary to the State Minister of Prison Reforms and"
"Prison  Rehabilitation  letter  dated  11th  June  2021,  and the  State  Minister  of  Justice,  Prison"
"Affairs  and  Constitutional  Reforms  to  the  PSC  recommending  the  reinstatement  of  the"
"petitioner back in public service have not been taken into consideration."
"Upon considering all issues raised by both parties in this case, this Court is of the view that"
"the  petitioner’s  failure  to  report  to  duty  cannot  be  treated  as  VOP  and  in  light  of  the"
"extraordinary circumstances of this case, the PSC ought to have considered the petitioner’s"
"appeal and determined it in favour of the petitioner. This Court has further observed that the"
"AAT has merely sailed along with the stance of the PSC by completely failing to exercise its"
"discretion. Thus, by surrendering its power and jurisdiction to the PSC this way the AAT has"
"erred both in fact and in law."
