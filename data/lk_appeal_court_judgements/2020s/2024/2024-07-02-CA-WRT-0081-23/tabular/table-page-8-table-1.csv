The petitioner does not display uberima fides required in coming before this Court."
"V. 
The petitioner's application is misconceived in law."
"It  is  the  view  of  the  respondents  that  the  decision  given  by  the  AAT  is  in  favour  of  the"
"petitioner as the said tribunal had decided to retire the petitioner overturning the decision"
"that had been taken previously to serve notice of VOP on the petitioner. As such there is no"
