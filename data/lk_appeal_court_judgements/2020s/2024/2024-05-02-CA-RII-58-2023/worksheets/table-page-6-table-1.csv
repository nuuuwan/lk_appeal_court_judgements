"proper trial had taken place as the court had not been properly constituted."
"The  following  example  of  restitutio  in  integrum  being  used  as  an  appellate"
"remedy is given by Engelsman. The praetor set aside a decision on account of"
"an error in the formula. It would appear that although the formula was framed"
"correctly in terms of the contentions of the parties it contained an error which"
"could have led only to a wrong decision. An aggrieved party had locus standi"
"and could apply directly to the praetor for relief. The intercession of an official"
"was  unnecessary  in  regard  to  restitutio  in  integrum.  The  remedy  was  wide"
"and  could  be  invoked  in  a  number  of  situations.  For  example  it  could  be"
"granted to creditors who suffered loss resulting from the debtor undergoing"
"capitis  diminutio  minima.  This  form  of  legal  disability  extinguished  all  the"
"contractual debts of the affected party. By virtue of the remedy the praetor"
"restored the rights of action to creditors. The power to grant restitutio in"
"integrum was also held by the emperor. He used the remedy inter alia to"
"set  aside  administrative  decisions  eg.  To  pardon  Roman  citizens  who"
"had  been  deported  (deportio  in  insulam).  As  a  result  of  the  pardon  the"
"citizen was restored to his patria potestas and was said to be restitutus in"
"integrum.‚Äù"
