"","C.A. WRIT 
0312 -2020"
"52)","The  said  matter  was  identified  by  the  Respondents.    06  notices  of"
"","assessments  had  been  issued  to  the  Petitioner  which  is  already"
"","referred to as P1 (a) to P1 (f)."
"53)","The  said  assessment  notices  had  contained  that  the  Petitioner  had"
"","failed  to  submit  the  rent  and  salary  income.    After  the  issuance  of"
"","the 
said 
notices 
as 
the 
Petitioner  had 
not 
responded, 
the"
"","Respondents  had  issued  P2  (a)  to  P2(c)  tax  default  notices  for  the"
"","unpaid  taxes.    The  Petitioner  had  failed  to  honour  the  said  notices"
"","as well."
"54)","As  the  Petitioner  has  evaded  the  payment  after  the  default  notice,"
"","the  Respondent  had  issued  further  notices  and  reminder  letter  to"
"","the Petitioner which is marked and produced as P4 and P5."
"55)","As 
the  Petitioner  has 
failed 
to 
reply 
to 
the  said 
letters, 
the"
"","Respondents  had 
taken  steps 
to 
institute  an  action  before 
the"
"","Magistrate  Court  of  Anuradhapura  based  on  the  certificate  of  tax"
"","default which is marked and produced as P29 (a) and P29 (b)."
"56)","The  said  position  is  strongly  objected  to  by  the  counsel  for  the"
"","Petitioner.    The  position  taken  by  the  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  is,"
"","that 
the  Petitioner  had  already 
settled  all 
the  overdue 
taxes"
"","referenced  in  the  additional  notice  of  assessment.    Therefore,  it  is"
"","illegal and arbitrary to issue such assessment notices for which the"
"","Petitioner is not liable to make any payment."
"57)","Further, the Petitionerâ€™s contention was the statute only provides to"
"","issue 
additional 
assessments 
and 
not 
multiple 
additional"
"","assessments.    The  Petitioner  has  relied  on  P9  notes,  where  the"
"","Petitioner  had  participated  for  an  interview  and  an  assessor  had"
"","considered  the  payments  made  by  the  Petitioner  and  had  granted"
"","reliefs referred to in the said notes."
