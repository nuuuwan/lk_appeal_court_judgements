"","C.A. WRIT 
0312 -2020"
"75)","The 
said  position 
taken  by 
the  Petitioner  had 
failed  as 
the"
"","Petitioner’s  father’s  tax  file  had  been  misplaced  and  could  not  be"
"","traced  and  the  funds  utilized  to  purchase  the  properties  were  not"
"","disclosed  properly  by  the  Petitioner.  As  per  the  Respondents  there"
"","were  no  other  documents  to  prove  that  the  Petitioner’s  father  had"
"","purchased  the  said  properties.  Thus,  the  tax  pertinent  to  the  said"
"","properties had been included in the additional assessments."
"76)  When  considering  the  Petitioner’s  stand  that  multiple  assessments",""
"","had been issued against her cannot be accepted as the Respondents"
"","have  acted  according  to  the  Provisions  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act."
"","After  calling  for  documents  and  interviewing  the  Petitioner  and  the"
"","agent, 
the  Respondents  had  come 
to 
the  conclusion 
that 
the"
"","aforesaid incorrect information and tax returns had been submitted"
"","by the Petitioner."
"77)","The  Respondents  have  issued  1R10  amended  notice  of  assessment"
"","after  deducting  the  payments  made  by  the  Petitioner. 
  Further,"
"","considering the request made by the Petitioner dated 24th July 2020"
"","the amended tax certificates 1R14 and 1R15 had been issued."
"78)","The  Counsel for the Respondents  had relied  that the said amended"
"","assessment  and  tax  certificates  had  been  issued  after  holding  the"
"","interview with the Petitioner and in considering the payments made"
"","after  the  impugned  P9  interview  notes.    To  my  view  those  are  not"
"","multiple assessments or tax certificates."
"79)","The narrow view of the Petitioner is that the Respondents have acted"
"","illegally and issued multiple assessments which cannot be accepted."
"80)","Furthermore, the Petitioner had objected to the assessments prior to"
"","receiving the same."
"81)","On  the  said  grounds,  the  written  objections  sent  by  the  Petitioner"
"","cannot be accepted as an appeal as the assessment notices were not"
"","submitted by the Respondents."
