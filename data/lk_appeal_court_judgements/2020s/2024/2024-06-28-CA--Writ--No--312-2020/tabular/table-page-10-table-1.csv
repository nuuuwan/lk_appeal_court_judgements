"Further,  it  is  interesting  to  read  the  interpretation  given  by  N.S."
"Bindra in his book of Interpretation of Statutes.2"
"Bindra has defined and expressed taxation as follows3;"
"""The  concept  of  a  welfare  state 
is  that  the  state 
is"
"entitled  to  make  a  levy  even  against  the  will  of  the"
"people  sought  to  be  benefited.  Therefore, 
it 
is  of  no"
"relevance that the person sought to be benefited by the"
"Act does not consider it to be so, In a taxing provision if"
"there are two possible constructions of the words of the"
"statute then effect is to be given to the one that favours"
"the  citizen  and  not  the  one  that  imposes  a  burden  on"
"him.  If  there  is  authority  to  impose  taxes  after  doing  a"
"certain  act,  the  State  cannot  impose  the  taxes  unless"
"that  act 
is  done  and 
the  authority  must  show, 
if"
"challenged, that the act was done."
"Thus, in Commissioner Central Excise and Customs"
"v  Larsen  and  Toubro  Ltd  the  Supreme  Court  was"
"required  to  decide  whether  service  tax  could  be  levied"
"upon  indivisible  work  contracts  before  the  Finance  Act"
"of 2007, which expressly made work contracts taxable."
"The  Supreme  Court  answered  the  question  against  the"
"revenue on the reasoning that composite work contracts"
"combine  sale  of  goods  and  services.  Whilst  the  former"
"was  taxable  by  the  States,  the  second  could  be  taxed"
"by  the  Centre.  In  the  absence  of  an  express  legislative"
"demarcation between the Centre and the States, such a"
"tax could not be levied.‚Äù"
