"II)","Has the Petitioner disclosed all her income for the assessment"
"","years 2008/2009 to 2013/2014 as per P29 (a) and (b) notices?"
"46)","The  question  that  had  arisen 
in  the 
instant  Writ  application 
is"
"","whether the Petitioner has defaulted tax payments referred to in the"
"","additional notices of assessment issued by the Respondents which is"
"","marked and produced as P1(a) to P1(f)."
"47)","The  argument  raised  by  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  Petitioner  had"
"","already settled all the payment of taxes which were referred to in the"
"","additional notices and those matters had been looked into by the tax"
"","department at the interview held with the Petitioner by the Assessor."
"","The notes of the said interview are marked and produced as P9."
"48)","However,  the  said  position  was  vehemently  objected  for  and  denied"
"","by the Counsel for the Respondents as P9 does not carry the name"
"","of the person  who conducted the said inquiry and the  Respondents"
"","were confounded by the reliefs granted in P9."
"49)","Therefore, the Respondents have brought to the notice of court that"
"","an assessor cannot grant the reliefs mentioned in P9 and that does"
"","not  prevent  the  Respondents 
from 
issuing  additional  notices  of"
"","assessments based on the information received by the Respondents"
"","and 
after  detecting 
the 
relevant  documents  pertinent 
to 
the"
"","additional 
income 
for  which  the  Petitioner  had 
failed  to  answer"
"","truthfully."
"50)","The Petitioner had submitted tax returns for the years 2008/2009 to"
"","2013/2014  which  are  marked  and  produced  by  the  Respondent  as"
"","1R1 (a) to 1R1 (f)."
"51)","The  question 
that  had  arisen  was  whether 
the  Petitioner  had"
"","submitted accurate information on the said tax returns. On that the"
"","Petitioner  had  deliberately  defaulted  and  evaded  due  payment  of"
"","income tax to the Department of Inland Revenue."
