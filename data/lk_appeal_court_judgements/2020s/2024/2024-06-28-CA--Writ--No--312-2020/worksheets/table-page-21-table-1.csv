"","P19  and  P24  and  the  amended  certificate  of  tax  which  is  marked"
"","and produced as P29(b)."
"90)","These  documents  were  issued  by  the  Respondents  acting  in  their"
"","official  capacity. 
  To  quash  documents 
issued  by  a  government"
"","official  under  Writ  of  Certiorari  the  said  documents  should  have"
"","been issued arbitrarily, illegally or in violation of the principles of the"
"","relevant acts under which the said documents are issued."
"91)","In the instant application on the perusal of the documents and the"
"","interview  notes 
I  do  not  see 
that 
the  Respondents  have  acted"
"","illegally, arbitrarily and/or in violation of the Provisions of the Inland"
"","Revenue Act."
"92)","As  I  have  stated  above,  this  is  a  Writ  application  and  not  a  tax"
"","appeal.    However,  parties  have  gone  beyond  their  limits  explaining"
"","the calculation of the tax to be payable and to quash the tax notices."
"93)","The  main  context  is  to  overview  that  the  Respondents  have  acted"
"","arbitrarily,  illegally  and  or  without  following  the  provisions  of  the"
"","Inland  Revenue  Act  and  issued  P19,  P24  and  P29  (b)  notices  and"
"","amended tax certificate."
"94)","However, 
the  documents 
issued  by 
the  Respondents  had  been"
"","issued 
after 
considering 
the 
assessments 
forwarded 
by 
the"
"","Petitioner.    Further,  the  Respondents  have  acted  upon  considering"
"","the  P9  notes,  a  doubtful 
interview  which  had  been  conducted"
"","without  referring  to  the  assessorâ€™s  name  and  granted  concessions"
"","which under the normal circumstances could not have occurred."
"95)","In  the  said  circumstances  as  I  have  reiterated  above,  I  do  not  see"
"","any  violation  on  the  part  of  the  Respondents  issuing  P19,  P24  and"
"","P29 (b) documents."
"96)","At 
this  stage, 
I  draw  my  attention 
to 
the 
following  decision."
