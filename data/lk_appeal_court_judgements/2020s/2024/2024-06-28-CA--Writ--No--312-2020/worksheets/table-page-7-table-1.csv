0312 -2020"
"24)","However,  the  Petitioner  failed  to  pay  the  taxes  referred  to  in  the"
"","additional  assessment  and  or  appeal  against 
that.  Thus 
the  6"
"","notices of assessments were deemed to be final as per the Provisions"
"","of the Inland Revenue Act."
"25)","Thereafter,  the  Respondents  had  issued  2  notices  of  tax  in  default"
"","and reminders which are marked and produced as P2 (a), P2 (b) and"
"","P3."
"26)","As  the  Petitioner  had  not  honoured  the  tax  default  notices  the"
"","Respondents have informed the Petitioner by P3 document that legal"
"","action will be instituted on the unpaid tax default notices."
"27)","As  the  aforesaid  P3  notice  had  been  flouted  the  Respondents  had"
"","instituted  action  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Anuradhpura  based  on"
"","the certificate of tax in default."
"28)","Even though the Petitioner had failed to appear the Magistrate had"
"","not reissued notice and the case was laid by until the verification of"
"","the Petitioner’s address."
"29)","Further the Respondents have contended that the Petitioner’s letter"
"","dated 29th November 2016 which is marked as P6 (b) had requested"
"","that the assessment issued to the Petitioner be canceled."
"30)","Letters marked as 1R5 and 1R5 (a) are letters of intimation and not"
"","assessments and an appeal sent prior to the assessment cannot be"
"","considered by the Respondents.   The actual assessments are dated"
"","30th November 2016 which is marked as 1R6 and 1R6 (a)."
"31)","On  the  said  grounds,  the  Respondents  had  contended  that  the"
"","Respondents  had 
taken  steps 
to 
recover 
the 
tax  due  by 
the"
"","Petitioner as the assessments had been finalized."
"32)","On that, the Petitioner does not have any legal right for discretionary"
"","remedies  of 
the  Writs  of  Certiorari  and  Mandamus  and 
the"
"","Respondents had moved to dismiss the application of the Petitioner."
