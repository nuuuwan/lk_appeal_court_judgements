0312 -2020"
"","interview  notes,  which  had  been  conducted  without  following  the"
"","proper rules and regulations of the Inland Revenue Act."
"65)","On perusal of P9 document as the Deputy Solicitor General argued"
"","there  is  no  name  of  the  assessor  who  conducted  the  said  interview"
"","with  the  Petitioner  and  the  agent  of  the  Petitioner.    The  manner  in"
"","which the reliefs had been granted cannot be accepted as a normal"
"","interview conducted by an assessor."
"66)","Further, the signature on the said P9 interview notes is not known"
"","to the Respondents."
"67)","Therefore, the said document had created suspicion and doubt that"
"","it  had  been  conducted  by  an  assessor  who  is  not  known  to  the"

"","taken  by 
the 
Inland  Revenue  Department  or 
the  Tax  Appeal"
"","Commission.  This is a Writ application to quash the seizure notices"
"","and to amend the certificate of tax by issuing a Writ of Certiorari. I"
"","will discuss later, if the Respondents had acted in accordance to the"
"","Provisions of the Inland Revenue Act and had not violated any legal"
"","rights  of  the  Petitioner  and/or  no  illegalities  had  been  conducted,"
"","whether the Petitioner has the right to pursue the Writ of Certiorari"
"","in this application."
"70)","However,  the  Petitioner  in  his  petition  and  in  the  submissions  had"
