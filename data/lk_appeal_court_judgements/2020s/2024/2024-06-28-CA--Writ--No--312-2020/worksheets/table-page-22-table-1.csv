It 
is  a  cardinal  maxim 
that  every  power  has 
legal"
"limits,  however  wide  the  language  of  the  empowering"
"Act. If the Court finds that the power has been exercised"
"oppressively or unreasonably, or if there has been some"
"procedural 
failing,  such  as  not  allowing  a  person"
"affected 
to  put 
forward  his  case, 
the  act  may  be"
"condemned  as  unlawful.  There  are  no  absolute  or"
"unfettered  discretions 
in  public 
law;  discretions  are"
"conferred on public functionaries in trust  for the public,"
"to be used for the public good, and the propriety of the"
"exercise of such discretions is to be judged by reference"
"to the purposes for which they were so entrusted”."
