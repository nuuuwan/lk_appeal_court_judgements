"of  the  Supreme  Court  of  India  in  the  matters  of  judicial  review  and  scope  relating  to"
"Government contracts and tenders and deduced the legal principles as under:"
"â€œ(1) The modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative action."
"(2) The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the manner in which the decision"
"was made."
"(3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative decision. If a review of the"
"administrative decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision, without the necessary"
"expertise which itself may be fallible."
"(4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation"
"to tender is in the realm of contract."
"Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the contract is reached by process"
"of negotiations through several tiers. More often than not, such decisions are made qualitatively"
"by experts."
