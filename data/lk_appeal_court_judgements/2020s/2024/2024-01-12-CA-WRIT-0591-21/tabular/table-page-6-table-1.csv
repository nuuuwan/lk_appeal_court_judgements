"“While  the  test  of  bias  is  unsatisfactory  in  application,  clarity  may  be  sought  in  the  actual"

"between the judge and the parties or witnesses is more likely to succeed than one based upon"
"membership of particular organizations or institutes that may be thought to have an interest in"
"the dispute. A line must be drawn between genuine and fanciful cases”"
