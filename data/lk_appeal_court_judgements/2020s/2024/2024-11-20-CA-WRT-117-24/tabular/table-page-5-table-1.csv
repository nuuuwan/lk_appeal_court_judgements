"The main contention of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent had acted in mala fide in"
"these circumstances  and  the issuance of Notice  of Sale and  the  Gazette  Nos.  2368  and"
"2354 are unlawful and ultra vires."
"I
n this context, the Petitioner has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter"
"alia  writs  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  Notice  of  Sale  in  the  Gazette  No.  2368  dated"
"19.01.2024 and the Newspaper Notices dated 22.01.2024 marked as P13(b) to P13(g) and"
"the decision of the 1st Respondent in the Gazette No. 2354 marked as P12(b) to P12(g)."
"T
he main allegation made by the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent failed to provide"
"the Petitioner with credit facilities that were agreed upon in due time. On the other hand,"
"the 1st Res has stated that when the Res agreed to grant the facility of Rs. 33,000,000 by"
"executing the Mortgage Bond No. 05 which is the subject matter of this case. Initially, Rs."
"12,000,000 was granted to the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent on 24.12.2019. To release"
"the  further  credit  facility,  the  Petitioner  was  given  an  undertaking  by  letter  dated"
"18.12.2019  that,  the  Petitioner  needed  to make  certain changes  in  the  Letter  of  Credit"
"marked P4 (b). However, the Petitioner has failed to comply with the said undertaking."
"This was not revealed by the Petitioner in the Petition. Further, in the Counter Affidavit,"
"document marked 1R2 was not challenged by the Petitioner. According to 1R2, it is clear"
"that, the Petitioner has promised to amend the said Letter of Credit submitted to the 1st"
"Respondent before 07.01.2020."
"T
he 1st Respondent alleges that the Respondent could not release any further funds as"
"the  Petitioner  has  constantly  failed  to  comply  with  the  stipulations  and  requirements"
"initiated  by  the  1st  Respondent  to  the  Petitioner.  Since  the  Petitioner  has  defaulted  in"
"making payments, the Overdraft was rescheduled at the request of the Petitioner."
"S
ince the Petitioner has failed to make any payments, the 1staRespondent has taken steps"
"under the said Ordinance. This Court is mindful that, in document marked P15, there is"
"no indication by the Petitioner that, he has paid any amount to settle the Overdraft."
"S
ince the Petitioner has failed to settle the amount, the 1st Respondent had no other option"
"but to send a letter of demand. Therefore, the Respondent has taken steps to recover the"
"sum."
