"“The term mala fides is used, at times, in a broad sense, and, at other times, in a"
"narrow sense. In the broad sense, mala fides may denote an improper exercise of"
"power or abuse of discretion or any of the grounds mentioned below. In one case,"
"the Supreme Court observed;"
"“….mala fide exercise of power does not necessarily imply any moral turpitude as"
"a matter of law. It only means that the statutory power is exercised for purposes"
"foreign to those for which it is in law intended.”"
