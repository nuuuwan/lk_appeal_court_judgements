"section 294 of the Penal Code."
"It  was  his  view  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  that"
"aspect,  although  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  stated  that  there  was  a"
"verbal  altercation  between  the  appellant  and  the  deceased  over  a  deed.  The"
"learned  Counsel  argued  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  misdirected"
"when  it  was  decided  that  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  could  not  be  relied"
"upon, and the basis upon which the appellant was convicted for the offence of"
"murder."
"It was his position that the conviction should have been in terms of exception 4"
"of  section  294  of  the  Penal  Code  on  the  basis  of  an  act  committed  without"
"premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel."
"It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  DSG  that  the  test  should  have  been"
"whether a reasonably prudent man could have committed this type of an act if"
"he  had  no  intention  or  knowledge  of  the  fact  that  his  actions  could  lead  to"
"death of a person."
"However, the learned DSG agreed that the learned High Court Judge has failed"
"to  draw  his  attention  to  the  evidence  available  on  continuous  provocation"
"between  the  parties  and  the  sudden  fight  that  has  occasioned  as  a  result,  on"
"the  day  of  the  incident.  The  learned  DSG  agreed  that  if  the  evidence  was"
"considered in its correct perspective, the conviction should have been in terms"
"of  section  297  of  the  Penal  Code  on  the  basis  of  culpable  homicide  not"
"amounting to murder."
"Having considered the evidence in its totality, I find that this is a matter where"
"the  deceased  who  was  the  father  of  the  appellant  had  been  in  the  habit  of"
"getting  into  quarrels  after  both  of  them  consumed  liquor.  According  to  the"
"evidence  of  the  eyewitnesses,  they  have  not  even  attempted  to  intervene  to"
"prevent the incident that occurred, as it appeared that such incidents had been"
