"fatherâ€™s  request,  the  father  started  to  scold  him  using  foul  language,  which"
"resulted him losing his temper and assaulting the father."
"It  has  been  his  claim  that  he  has  not  assaulted  his  father  previously,  but  on"
"the  day  of  the  incident,  because  of  the  language  used  by  his  father  towards"
"him,  the  assaulting  took  place.  He  has  stated  that  it  was  not  his  intention  to"
"kill his father."
"In the judgement, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of"
"the  eyewitnesses  and  that  of  the  JMO,  and  has  concluded  that  the  evidence"
"had  been  cogent  and  trustworthy.  It  had  been  determined  that  it  was  the"
"appellant who assaulted the deceased, which resulted in his death. The learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  also  correctly  determined  that  prior  to  the  incident,"
"there  had  been  a  verbal  altercation  between  the  appellant  and  the  deceased"
"over a deed."
"Having  considered  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  where  he  has  admitted  that"
"the incident took place, but claimed he had no intention to kill his father, and"
"his  claim  that  the  incident  occurred  as  a  result  of  provocation  and  a  sudden"
"fight, it has been determined that the appellant has lied in his evidence and his"
"evidence  cannot  be  relied  upon.  On  the  basis  that  the  appellant  had  the"
"intention  to  kill  the  deceased,  and  his  failure  to  provide  medical  attention  to"
"him after the assault, it had been determined that the prosecution has proved"
"that  the  appellant  has  committed  the  offence  of  murder,  and  he  has  been"
"convicted as charged."
