"For  the  reasons  considered  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  this  was  a  situation"
"where  it  was  not  safe  to  convict  the  2nd  accused-appellant  for  the  counts"

"Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the 2nd accused-appellant and acquit"
"him of the 2nd and the 5th count of the indictment."
"The appeal allowed."
