"stated  that  when  they  came  inside  the  house,  the  light  inside  the  room  was"
"switched off by them (at page 149 of the appeal brief)."
"When  PW-01  was  cross-examined,  several  contradictions  as  to  her  original"
"statement to police has been marked by the defence."
"The husband of the prosecutrix has given evidence as PW-02. He has confirmed"
"that  someone  came  near  his  house  and  called  him  out  on  the  night  of  the"
"incident. He has also confirmed that from his house to the gate, it was about 30"
"feet and  the persons  who came were near the gate of the house. According to"
"him, he has identified the 1st accused whom he knew as one of the persons who"
"came and called him. The other two were unknown to him."
"When questioned about the light condition, he has stated that there was a light,"
"but the 1st accused wanted it to be switched off, and on his instructions, his wife"
"switched off the light."
"It is clear from the evidence that what the witness has stated was about the light"
"that was available in their house, since it was the prosecutrix who has switched"
"it off. He has not spoken anything about a  streetlight or a light near the gate,"
"situated about 30 feet away from their house."
"Since he could not handover the money as demanded, the 1st accused has forced"
"him to come along with him to the main road and had attempted to extort money"
"from  him,  which  he  could  not  provide.  When  he  returned  home,  his  wife  has"
"informed him that the jewellery she was wearing was robbed and she was also"
"raped."
"He  has  stated  at  the  trial  that  it  was  the  2nd  accused-appellant  and  the  3rd"
"accused who did that."
"He has testified that at the identification parade held in that regard, he identified"
"the 1st accused and the 3rd accused indicted, but not the appellant."
