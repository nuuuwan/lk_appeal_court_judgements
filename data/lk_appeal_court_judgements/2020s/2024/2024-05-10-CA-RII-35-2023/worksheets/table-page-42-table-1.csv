"","On the 27th of March, 1951, clauses 34 to 52 as amended by the Select"
"","Committee  were  ordered  to  stand  part  of  the  Bill.  It  must,  therefore,  be"
"","assumed that sub-sections (2) and (3) were inserted in section 48 to give"
"","effect to the decision of the Select Committee. The result was that the Bill"
"","laid down definitely that the validity of an interlocutory decree canonly be"
"","impeached  on  the  ground  that  the  lis  pendens  in  respect  of  the  action"
"","has not been duly registered or on the ground of want of jurisdiction. On"
"","the same day the Bill was reported with the amendments, read the third"
"","time, and passed.  The second and third readings of this Bill were taken"
"","up in the House of Representatives on the 6th of April, 1951, and passed"
"","without amendment."
"","The history of the Partition Act, therefore, shows that the intention of the"
"","legislature  was  to  give  an  opportunity  to  a  party  who  was  prejudiced  by"
"","an absence of due registration of the lis pendens to impeach the decree."
"","It seems fairly clear that it was not the intention of the legislature to give"
"","this  same  opportunity 
to 
the  other  categories  such  as  mortgagees,"
"","lessees, fidei commissaries, beneficiaries of trusts, etc. In my view, it is to"
"","safeguard  these  categories  whose  rights  may  have  been  extinguished  by"
"","an interlocutory decree that specific provision has been made in section"
"","49 empowering such party by a separate action to recover damages from"
"","any  party 
to 
the  action  by  whose  act,  whether  of  commission  or"
"","omission, such damages may have accrued, and where the whole or any"
"","part of such damages cannot be recovered from any such party, recover"
"","such  damages  or  part  thereof  from  any  other  person  who  has  benefited"
"","by  any  such  act  of  such  party.  The  fact  that  there  is  no  such  specific"
"","provision  to  protect  a  person  who  has  been  prejudiced  by  the  failure  to"
"","register  duly  the  lis  pendens  by  empowering  him  to  bring  a  separate"
"","action  appears  to  me  to  be  an  additional  reason  for  thinking  that  the"
"","impeachment  of 
the 
interlocutory  decree 
referred 
to  by 
the  Select"
"","Committee was to be achieved by such a party being allowed intervention"
