"Burnside  C.  J.  in  Nono  Hami  v.  De  Silva  and  Sir  Alexander  Wood"
"Renton in Jayawardene v. Weerasekera, held that a partition decree"
"is  conclusive  against  all  persons  whomsoever,  and  that  a  person"
"owning  an  interest  in  the  land  partitioned  whose  title,  even  by"
"fraudulent  collusion  between  the  parties,  had  been  concealed  from"
"the  Court 
in  the  partition  proceedings, 
is  not  entitled  on  that"
"ground  to  have  the  decree  set  aside,  his  only  remedy  being  an"
"action  for  damages.  Lord  Cohen  who  delivered  the  judgment  of  the"
"Board went on to say that although the law abhors fraud and equity has"
"an undoubted jurisdiction to relieve against every species of fraud, still to"
"say 
that 
fraud 
vitiates 
everything  obtained  by 
it 
is 
too  broad  a"
"proposition.  When  adequate  relief  can  be  had  at  law  and  when  in  fact"
"there  is  a  full,  perfect  and  complete  remedy  otherwise,  it  is  not  the"
"course to interfere."
"Whatever  the  reason  for  the  saving  of  the  powers  of  revision  and"
"restitutio in integrum in section 48(3) of the Partition Law No. 21 of"
"1977, to say that these powers will not be available outside the area"
"of  fraud  and  collusion  would  be  to  leave  victims  of  miscarriages  of"
"justice where there is no fraud and collusion without remedy15. The"
"expressiounius rule should not be applied where to do so would produce"
"a wholly irrational situation and gross injustice. Further there is nothing"
"to  support  an  inference  of  legislative  intent  on  the  basis  of  the  maxim"
"expressiouniusexclusioalterius.  The  omission 
to  reserve  specially 
the"
"powers  of  revision  and  restitutio  in  integrum  of  the  Supreme  Court  in"
"section  48(1)  of  the  Partition  Law  No.  21  of  1977  does  not  support  the"
"conclusion that these powers that were already there have been impliedly"
"taken away. Nothing less than an express removal of these powers would"
"be required to achieve such a result."
