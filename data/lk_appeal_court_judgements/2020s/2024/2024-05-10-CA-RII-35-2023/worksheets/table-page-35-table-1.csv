"","consequence  from  the  decisions  of  our  Courts  which  refused  to  give  to"
"","the interlocutory decree entered under Section 4 the final and conclusive"
"","effect contemplated by Section 9. It seems to me that the Partition Act of"
"","1951 sought to put an end to the considerable delay occasioned by such"
"","interventions.  Section  48  of  the  new  Act  expressly  provided  that  the"
"","interlocutory  decree  entered  under  Section26  which  I  corresponds  with"
"","the  interlocutory  decree  under  Section  4  of  the  repealedOrdinance  shall"
"","have  a 
final  and  conclusive  effect.  No 
intervention  thereafter  would"
"","ordinarily  be  permitted  and  Section  48  further  provided  that  both  the"
"","interlocutory  decree  entered  under  Section  26  and 
the 
final  decree"
"","entered under Section 36 shall ""be good and sufficient evidence of title of"
"","any person as to any right share or interest awarded therein to him and"
"","be final and conclusive for all purposes against all persons whomsoever"";"

"","any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof oftitle adduced before"

"","sub-section 3 to which I shall refer later."
"","It seems to me that by expressly denying the right of intervention on the"

"","fact  that  all  the  persons  concerned  are  not  parties  to  the  partition"
"","action"",  the  new  Act  sought  to  negative  the  effect  of  any 
failure  to"

in  Section  9  of 
the  Partition  Ordinance,  as"
