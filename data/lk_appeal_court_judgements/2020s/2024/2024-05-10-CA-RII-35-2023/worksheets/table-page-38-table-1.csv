"For  these  and  other  reasons  which  are  not  relevant  to  this  case,  I"
"think  that  in  referring  to  the  interlocutory  decree  in  the  Act  the"
"legislature  had 
in  mind  that 
interlocutory  decree  to  which  no"
"exception  was  attached  and  which  was  unqualified  in  its  scope."
"Therefore,  when  section  70  (1)  went  on  to  provide  for  the  point  of"

"before  the  interlocutory  decree  is  entered,  it  must  be  deemed  to"
"refer  to  an  interlocutory  decree  in  the  normal  case  and  not  an"
"interlocutory  decree  which  was  qualified  by  the  exception  provided"
"in section 48 (3). For, if it is conceded that a person, who comes within"

"far  as  he  is  concerned,  file  another  partition  action  or  a  vindicatory"

"intervene  in  the  same  action  rather  than  be  told  that  even  though"
"his  claim  of  title  is  sound  he  cannot  intervene  as  the  interlocutory"

"intervene  soon  after  the 
interlocutory  decree. 
In  such  an  event  the"
"interlocutory  decree  will,  by  necessary  implication,  have  to  be  set  aside"
