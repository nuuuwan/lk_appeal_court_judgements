"","the view that to permit this would be to unduly prolong partition actions"
"","and thereby defeat the purpose of the new Partition Act."
"","Section 48 (3) restricts the grounds depriving an interlocutory decree of"
"","its  ""final  and  conclusive""  character  to  :  (1)  want  of  jurisdiction  in  the"

"","of one or the other or both these will not take an unduly long time. There"
