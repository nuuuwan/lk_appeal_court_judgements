"","This view derives support from the judgment of T. S. Fernando, J.,  with"
"","whom  Abeyesundere,  J.,  agreed  in  Victor  Perera  v.  Don  Jinadasa1,[1"
"","(1962) 65 N. L. R. 451.]  which I discovered after judgment was reserved"
"","and to which I have drawn the attention of My Lord the Chief Justice and"
"","brother Abeyesundere. The caption reads thus :-"
"","In  partition  suit  No.  7059  R,  who  was  added  as  a  party,  did  not"
"","take  any  action  herself  in  respect  of  the  suit  and  did  not  participate  at"
"","the 
trial.  After 
interlocutory  decree  was  entered  she  attempted 
to"
"","intervene in the suit in order to obtain either a dismissal of the suit or an"
"","exclusion of lots 1 and 2 in the corpus. Her attempt proved unsuccessful."
"","Thereafter she transferred her rights in lots 1 and 2 to V.P. Belying upon"
"","this deed of transfer, V.P. instituted the present action No. 8576 claiming"
"","a declaration of title to lots 1 and 2, citing as defendants all the persons"
"","who had been allotted shares in the interlocutory decree which dealt with"
"","lots 1, 2 and 3 as one corpus. He claimed that, inasmuch as the partition"
"","action  had  not  been  duly  registered  as  a  lis  pendens,  his  right  to  a"
"","declaration of his title was unaffected by the interlocutory decree."
"","Held, that under section 48 (3) of the Partition Act the trial judge"
"","was obliged to address his mind to the question of due registration of the"
"","partition action as a lis pendens."
"","R.  was 
already 
a  party 
to 
the  partition 
action  7059  when"
"","interlocutory decree was entered. Therefore, if that was a valid decree or"
"","the court had jurisdiction to enter it, not only R. but also her successor"
"","in  title  V.P.  would  be  bound  by 
it  and  by  the 
final  decree. 
I  have"
"","examined  the  record  in  8576,  the  issues,  the  learned  District  Judge's"
"","answers to them and the petition of appeal and find that, inter alia, the"
"","following points were before this Court for decision in appeal:"
"","If lis pendens was not duly registered :-"
