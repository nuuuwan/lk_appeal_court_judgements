"Act  were  considered,  I  find  it  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  appeal  under"
"consideration."
"Per Ranjith Silva, J."
"“According to this section it appears that the burden of proving that it was"
"not voluntarily rest on the accused-appellant. But what is important is the"
"language the legislature has used in Section 24 of the Evidence Ordnance."
"It states that ‘when it appears to Courts’ to guarantee the accused person"
"in criminal proceedings absolute fairness. Thus, Section 24 does not require"
"positive  proof  of  improper  inducement,  threat  or  promise  to  justify  the"
"rejection of a confession. If the court, after proper examination and a careful"
"analysis of the evidence and the circumstances of a given case, holds to the"
"view  that  there  appears  to  have  been  a  threat,  inducement  or  promise,"
"though this is no strictly proved, the Court must refuse to receive in evidence"
"the confession. In other words, the burden appears to be, the burden cast"
"by the subsection 2 of section 16 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act is a very"
"light burden because there is not much that the accused has to prove. From"
"the given circumstances of the case, sometimes a court of law may be able"
"to decide whether it appears that the confession was not voluntary.”"
