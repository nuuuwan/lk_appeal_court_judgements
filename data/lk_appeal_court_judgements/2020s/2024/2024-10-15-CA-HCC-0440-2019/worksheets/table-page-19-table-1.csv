"Once the prosecution closed its case, the learned High Court Judge, after having"
"considered the evidence led before him, has decided to call for a defence from the"
"appellant."
"The appellant has made a lengthy dock statement and had stated that he had"
"no reason whatsoever to cause the death of his wife and two children. He has"
"denied  that  he  made  the  section  127  statement  voluntarily,  and  had  made  a"
"lengthy statement to the effect that he was forced to make the statement after"
"being assaulted by the police. He has also referred to several shortcomings in"
"the investigations. In the process of his dock statement, he has admitted that he"
"had a connection with PW-10 for a period of 3 weeks, but has claimed that it was"
"not a reason for him to commit a gruesome act like this. He has claimed that he"
"is innocent of committing the crime."
