"The  1st  piece  of  circumstantial  evidence  against  the  appellant  has  been  his"
"behaviour  towards  PW-06  Roshan,  who  occupied  one  of  the  annexes  of  the"
"house. While he was washing his clothes, at around 6.30 a.m. in the morning on"
"17-12-2012,  the  appellant  has  come  and  knocked  on  his  door.  After  having  a"
"chat with him for few minutes over a vehicle transaction, he has left. About 15"
"minutes later, PW-06 has heard a scream from the main house and when he ran"
"towards the house, he has seen the incident that has occurred."
"In the morning of the 18th, while the inmates of the house were preparing for the"
"funeral arrangements, the appellant has come to his room and had given him an"
"iPad, a laptop bag, and Rs. 200,000/- for safe keeping, and had informed him to"
"give the money to his mother if she asked for it."

"that the appellant carried in his mind, knowing very well of what he did."
"The evidence of the JMO clearly shows that the elder child has died as a result"
"of  manual  strangulation.  It  is  therefore  clear  that  the  appellant  had  been"
"attempting to provide explanations for such an eventuality."
"The fact of PW-01â€™s failure to mention that in his police statement made after the"
"arrest  of  the  appellant  does  not  create  any  doubt  as  to  the  fact  that  such  a"
"statement has been made by the appellant to PW-01 when taking the evidence"
"of PW-01 and PW-06 together. It is quite obvious that for a person overwhelmed"
"with  emotions,  after  seeing  his  sister  and  her  two  children  dead  in  their  own"
