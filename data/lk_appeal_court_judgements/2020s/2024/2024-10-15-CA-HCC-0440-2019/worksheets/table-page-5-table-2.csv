"narration  of  the  defence,  thus,  has  failed  to  properly  consider  the"
"defence, and thereby, had improperly rejected the same."
"In view of the above grounds of appeal, I find that although six separate grounds"
"of appeal were raised by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel, all the said grounds of"
"appeal  revolves  around  the  argument  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove"
"the  charges  against  the  appellant  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  and  the  learned"
"High Court  Judge has failed to consider the evidence in its correct perspective,"
"and  also  failed  to  properly  evaluate  the  defence  put  forward  by  the  appellant,"
"and thereby, a fair trial was denied and a miscarriage of justice occasioned  to"
"the appellant."
"In view of the above, I find it necessary to briefly consider the facts that came to"
"light at the trial before considering the grounds of appeal urged in detail."
