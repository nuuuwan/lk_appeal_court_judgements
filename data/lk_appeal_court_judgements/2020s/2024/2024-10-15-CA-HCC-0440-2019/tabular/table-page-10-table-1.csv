"It has been her evidence that only after the appellant was arrested, she revealed"
"to him at the Mt. Lavinia police station that he was their adopted child."
"In this matter, the domestic servant mentioned by the other witnesses has also"
"given evidence and has corroborated what the PW-02 has stated in Court. PW-"
"05 is a neighbour and a relative of the appellant and also a person who reached"
"the place of the incident, hearing the cries of the appellant and PW-02."
"The next witness of importance is PW-10. By the time she gave evidence in Court,"
"she was a teacher, and during the time relevant to this incident, she had been"
"studying a French Diploma Course in Colombo. She has commenced her studies"
"just  after  completing  her  Advanced  Level  studies  and  used  to  travel  from  her"
"home  in  Marawila  area  to  Colombo  using  public  transport  to  attend  to  her"
"studies. While travelling to Colombo, she has met another boy who introduced"
"himself  as  a  person  attending  classes  as  well,  and  they  have  exchanged  their"
"phone numbers. This has happened during the later part of 2012."
"About a month after this incident, she has started receiving a large number of"
"missed calls for which she has not called back. Thereafter, she has received two"
"SMS  messages  with  her  name  and  other  details,  which  has  resulted  in  her"
"answering the phone. When she inquired as to how he got her number, the caller"
"has informed that he got it from one of his friends, who is attending classes. The"
"caller has informed her that he has seen her and had indicated an interest in"
"commencing an affair with her. He has introduced himself as Madhura and had"
"informed that he is a Manager attached to a private company, and a person living"
"in Kalutara area. He has also given details of his family and introduced himself"
"as a person of 28 years of age. These calls have continued, which has developed"
"into an affair."
"However, she has only met this person three occasions during this episode, and"
"on the 1st day they met, she has travelled with him to Marawila in his car. He"
"has informed her that he is unmarried and is looking forward to start a married"
"life."
