"it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of"
"the moment."
"It was submitted that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the"
"confessional statement made by the appellant in relation to the other evidence"
"led in the case, for which I have no reason to agree."
"It is amply clear from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge has not"
"only based his judgment on the confession, but has independently considered"
"the circumstantial evidence and had considered all the pieces of evidence as a"
"whole in order to reach his final findings."
"Although, motive is not a matter that needs to be proved in a criminal case, the"
"evidence of PW-10 shows a possible motive, though maybe unbelievable to many"
"ordinary  human  beings,  as  a  reason  for  the  gruesome  crime  committed.  Even"
"though  it  was  contended  that  the  behaviour  of  the  appellant  in  attempting  to"
"distance  from  PW-10  may  have  been  due  to  other  reasons,  and  that  aspect"
"should also have been considered by the learned High Court Judge, I find that"
"there was no basis for such a consideration as the evidence clearly provides that"
"his attempts to distance himself from PW-10 had been to cover his past acts and"
"nothing else."
