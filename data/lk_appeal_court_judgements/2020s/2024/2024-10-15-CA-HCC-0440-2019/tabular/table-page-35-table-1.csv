"be  free  from  an  over  emotional  response.  Doubts  must  be  actual  and"
"substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from the"

"reasonable doubt is not an imaginary trivial or a merely possible doubt: but"
"a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of the"
"evidence in the case. The concepts of probability, and the degree of it, cannot"
"obviously be expressed in terms of units to be mathematically enumerated"
"as  to  how  many  of  such  units  constitute  proof  beyond  reasonable  doubt."
"There is an unmistakable subjective element in the evaluation of the degrees"
"of  probability  and  the  quantum  of  proof.  Forensic  probability  must,  in  the"
"last analysis, rest on a robust common sense and ultimately, on the trained"
"intuitions of the Judge. While the protection given by the criminal proceeds"
"to the accused persons is not to be eroded, at the same time, uninformed"
"legitimization  of  trivialities  would  make  a  mockery  of  administration  of"
