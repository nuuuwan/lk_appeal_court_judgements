"“I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ"
"of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a"
"matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has a discretion to deny"
"him  relief  having  regard  to  his  conduct;  delay, 
laches,  waiver,  submission  to"
"jurisdiction  are  all  valid 
impediments  which  stand  against  the  grant  of  relief."
"Applying these principles, I hold that this court is not disposed to grant the Petitioner"
"discretionary  relief  upon  this  application  in  view  of  inordinate  delay  and  laches  in"
"filing the application in Court.”"
