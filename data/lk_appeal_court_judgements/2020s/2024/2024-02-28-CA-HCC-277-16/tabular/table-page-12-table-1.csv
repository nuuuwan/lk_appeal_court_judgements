"The accused-appellant in this case was always ready to return the money"
"that the  complainant gave to him. Even  at the stage of cross-examining"
"PW-1 (the complainant), the counsel who appeared in the high court for"
"the accused-appellant suggested to PW-1 to give him back the Rs. 22 lakhs"
"but PW-1 refused to accept (pages 137 and 138 of the appeal brief). Thus,"
"there is no evidence that the appellant had dishonestly misappropriated"
"the Rs. 22 lakhs that he obtained from the complainant. Hence, I hold that"
"it  has  not  been  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  accused-"
"appellant had dishonestly misappropriated Rs.22 lakhs. I hold further that"
"convicting the appellant for the charge of misappropriation is bad in law."
