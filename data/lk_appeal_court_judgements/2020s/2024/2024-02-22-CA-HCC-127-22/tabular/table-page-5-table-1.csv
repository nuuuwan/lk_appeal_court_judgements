n the case at hand also, although the appellant continuously abused"
"the victim, she had not told about these incidents to her parents. It is"
"clear that one or more of the aforesaid factors may be the reason for not"
"informing her parents of those incidents. One of the main reasons for"
"her silence was fear. PW-1 stated in her evidence that the appellant had"
"threatened her that if she tells these things to her parents, her mother"
"and father would be killed  (page 232 of the Appeal Brief).  Also, PW-1"
"stated  that  once  the  appellant  told  her  “If  she  speaks  about  these"
"things,  both  of  them  would  be  killed”  (page  77  of  the  Appeal  Brief)."
"According to the aforementioned reasons for child’s silence, one of the"
"reasons for PW-1’s silence is that she was afraid of the consequences of"
"speaking about it, either for herself and/or for another member of the"

"no improbability in the prosecution case or there is no reason to draw"
"an inference that the prosecution story is an afterthought for the reason"
"of  PW-1  not  telling her  parents  about  the  sexual  abuses  done  by  the"
"appellant. However, it is apparent from the mother’s evidence that the"
"victim  had  told  her  mother  that  she  cannot  travel  in  the  appellant’s"
