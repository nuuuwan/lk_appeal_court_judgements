"v.  The  Attorney  General  -  Court  of  Appeal  case  No.  CA/85/2013,"
"decided on 25.05.2018, it was observed as follows:"
"“
Time  and  again  courts  have  discussed  the  acceptance  of  evidence  of"
"children of tender ages. Our judges are not there to test the memory of"
"the witness, they are expected to find actual fact and the truth. Witnesses"
"are human beings, they are not memory machines nor robots to repeat"
"the incident as it was. Further, the natural behaviour of human beings is"
"to  forget  incidents,  especially  sad  memories.  No  one  wants  to  re-visit"
"painful  moments  and  keep  detailed  memories  with  them.  We  are  also"
"mindful most of our courts with due respect, are not child friendly.”"
