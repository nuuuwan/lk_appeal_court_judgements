"Petitioner  and  the  7th  Respondent  were  present,  and  their  statements  were  recorded."
"The Petitioner denied signing such a document and handing over the property to the 7th"
"Respondent."
"F
urther, the official who conducted the inquiry observed that the annual permit issued"
"to  the  Petitioner,  was  not  cancelled 
in  accordance  with  Section  106  of  the  Land"
"Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 (as amended), and that the said annual permit"
"was renewed until 2010. The Committee observed that there was a recommendation of"
"the then Divisional Secretary, to grant the long-term lease to the Petitioner. Accordingly,"
"the Petitioner had paid the relevant fees. The said inquiry and findings are marked as"
"P53  in  the  counter  objections. 
  According  to  the  Petitioner,  these  documents  were"
"obtained only consequent to an order made by the Right to Information Commission in"
"an appeal."
"T
hereafter,  by 
letter  marked  as  P28  dated  25.11.2020,  the  then  Provincial  Land"
"Commissioner  of  the  Eastern  Province  informed  the  Commissioner  General  of  Lands"
"recommending  that  the  Petitioner  should  be  given  the  long-term  lease.  Acting  on  the"
"aforesaid  recommendation,  steps  were 
taken 
to 
issue 
the 
long-term 
lease 
to 
the"
"Petitioner."
"However, 
the  7th  Respondent 
complained 
to 
the  3rd  Respondent  by 
letter  dated"
"07.05.2021 with regard to the grant of a long-term lease to the Petitioner. Based on that,"
"the 2nd Respondent directed the 3rd Respondent to hold a fresh inquiry. According to the"
"7th  respondent,  the  Petitioner  had  not  participated  in  the  said  inquiry.  Thereafter,  the"
"Petitioner was informed by letter dated 27.06.2022, to participate in another inquiry on"
"21.07.2022.  Through  his  lawyer,  the  Petitioner  informed  that  he  was  unable  to  be"
"present  on  that  said  date.  Without  considering  his  application,  the  2nd  Respondent"
"directed  the  4th  Respondent  to  prepare  the  documents  recommending  the  long-term"
"lease  to  the  7th  Respondent.  According  to  the  Petitioner,  the  decision  made  by  the  2nd"
"Respondent  to  grant  the  long-term  lease  to  the  7th  Respondent  dated  23.03.2022  is"
"arbitrary 
on 
the 
basis 
that 
there 
existed 
recommendations 
by 
previous  Land"
"Commissioners  (as  demonstrated  by  documents  marked  P28  and  P34)  recommending"
"the issuance of the long-term lease to the Petitioner."
