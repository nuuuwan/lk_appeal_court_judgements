"it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of"
"the moment."
"When considering the evidence of the victim child and the witnesses who gave"
"evidence before the Court, I am unable to find any inconsistency or improbability"
"in the version of events narrated by the witnesses. I find that the learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  well  considered  all  the  relevant  aspects  of  the  evidence  in"
