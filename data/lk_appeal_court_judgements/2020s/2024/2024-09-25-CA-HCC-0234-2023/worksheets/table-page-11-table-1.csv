"Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that in criminal proceedings, the"
"fact that the accused person has a bad character is irrelevant, unless evidence"
"has been given that he has a good character, in which case it becomes relevant."
"The exception to this rule (section 54) is where evidence has been given that the"
"accused  has  a  good  character  i.e.,  where  he  puts  his  character  into  issue  in"
"which case the prosecution is entitled to rebut the evidence of good character."
"However, the character must by clearly put in issue. This may be at the stage of"
"cross-examination of prosecution witnesses."
