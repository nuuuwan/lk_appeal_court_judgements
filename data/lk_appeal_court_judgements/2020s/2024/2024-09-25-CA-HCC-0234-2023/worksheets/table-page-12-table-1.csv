"I am unable to find that the learned High Court Judge has, in anywhere in the"
"judgment, has referred to character evidence against the appellant. Nowhere in"
"the consideration of evidence, the learned High Court Judge had referred to the"
"character,  but  only  what  PW-02  has  come  to  know  from  the  two  children"
"including the victim child. At page 13 of the judgment (page 273 of the appeal"
"brief),  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  commented  on  the  alleged  omission"
"which the defence Counsel has brought to the notice of the Court in relation to"
"the statement made by PW-02 to the police. She has considered that omission"
"in order to consider whether the evidence of PW-02 passes the test of credibility"
"and nothing else."
"Accordingly, I find no merit in the second ground of appeal."
"6th and the 7th Grounds of Appeal :-"
"It was contended that the prosecution has failed to satisfy the Court as to the"
"tests of consistency, probability and inter se and per se contradictions, and also"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  considered  the  defence  evidence  in  the"
"corrects perspective."
"This is a case where the appellant is the own father of the victim child, who was"
"under the age of 9 years during the time she had to face these incidents of grave"
"sexual  abuse  and  rape.  Although  the  indictment  relates  to  one  count  of  rape"
"allegedly committed by the appellant on his own daughter, the evidence led at"
"the trial clearly indicates that it was not an isolated incident, but the victim child"
"had been subjected to repeated grave sexual abuse as well as rape."
"It is my considered view that any evidence in that regard needs to be considered"
"in that context, and in view of the painful task any victim has to undergo when"
"narrating such incidents in open Court against her own father. The learned High"
"Court Judge in her judgment has well considered of the manner such evidence"
"should be considered and has come to correct findings in that regard."
