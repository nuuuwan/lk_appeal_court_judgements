"About  two  days  after  they  returned,  she  has  come  to  know  from  a  neighbour"
"about the sexual harassments faced by the victim child and her elder sister, and"
"when  she  went  and  inquired  from  them,  she  has  come  to  know  about  the"
"incidents faced by the both of them. Thereafter, she has taken the two girls under"
"her care and had taken steps to lodge a police complaint in this regard."
"According to her evidence, when these matters were taken up in the Court, and"
"the two children were to be taken under probation care, out of compassion, she"
"has undertaken to take care of the children and they had been living with her"
"for about 5 to 6 years. Their mother has provided financial support to care for"
"them. Subsequently, because of the complaint that her husband too committed"
"sexual abuse on the child, the child has been handed over to the probation care,"
"but  has  insisted  that  she  still  visits  the  child  and  care  for  her  despite  the"
"complaint against the husband."
"When she was subjected to cross-examination, several alleged omissions in her"
"statement to the police had been brought to the notice of the Court, and it has"
"been  alleged  that  because  she  was  benefiting  out  of  the  money  sent  by  the"
"children’s mother for their upkeep, and in order to stop the children going back"
"to their father, it was she who instigated a false complaint against the appellant."
"It has also been suggested that it was only her husband who  committed  sexual"
"abuse to the child. She has denied the allegations against her."
"According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who marked the"
"Medico-Legal Report in relation to his examination of the child as P-02, the child"
"has given the history of the incident as her father sexually abusing her during"
"night time about three times by using his penis over her vagina. However, the"
"JMO has observed signs of repeated penile penetration of the child’s vagina when"
"he examined her. He has opined that such sexual penetration may have occurred"
"somewhere between two weeks or earlier than the date of examination. He has"
"well explained the medical reasons for his observations and the opinion."
