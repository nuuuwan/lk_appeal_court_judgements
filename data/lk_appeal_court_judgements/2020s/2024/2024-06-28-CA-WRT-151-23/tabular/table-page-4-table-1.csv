"Divisional  Secretary  of  Attanagalla  has  informed  the  Land  Registrar  that  the"
"Land  which  is  subjected  to  the  Deed  of  Declaration  bearing  No  231  depicted  in"
"the said surveyor plan No. 3287 is not a State Land, but it is a private land."
"The  main  argument  put  forward  by  the  Petitioners  are  that  the  Respondents"
"have  the  statutory  duty  to  approve  the  plan  which  was  submitted  by  the"
"Petitioner  and  accept  the  rates  in  respect  of  the  premises  referred  in  the  said"
"plan."
"We are mindful that the Petitioners are claiming the premises on the basis that"
"they have derived the title on the basis of prescription."
"When  we  perused  both  the  Deeds.  Deed  bearing  No  231  was  executed  on"
"14.03.2020, other deed where the 1st Petitioner title bearing No 292 was executed"
"on 23.04.2021. Both the Deeds were recently executed. For that purpose, the 1st"
"Respondent  had  asked  from  the  Petitioners  to  submit  the  relevant  documents"
"that  pertaining  to  the  said  Deeds  from  the  Land  Registry  to  approve  the  said"
"plan.  We are mindful that the particular plan which was marked as “P1” doesn’t"
"indicate the name of the owner of the Land and there is no Assessment Number"
"given to the land."
"One  of  the  objection  taken  by  the  Respondent  is  that,  since  the  2nd  Petitioner"
"claimed his title over the said land on prescription which was recently executed"
"by deed, they are not certain whether any other person will claim the ownership"
"of the said land. To avoid the future dispute over the said land the Respondents"
"needed more time to ascertain and confirm the ownership of the said land, which"
"is depicted in the said plan. Further they stated that the particular plan does not"
"have any reference whatsoever regarding the owner of the said land."
"According to the Respondents, Urban Development Authority Law has power to"
"approve  the    sub  division  of  the  land  which  is  coming  under  a  development"
"activity.  That  means,  whenever  any  person  submit  the  plan  for  building,  the"
"survey plan submitted by them should be approved in accordance with the rules"
"therefore they need more time to confirm it."
