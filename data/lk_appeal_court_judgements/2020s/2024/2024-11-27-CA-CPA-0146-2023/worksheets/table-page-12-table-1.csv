"I am of the view  that it is not only a judgment pronounced by a Court of Law ,"
"but  it is also necessary to show  that the proceeding before the Court was in"
"accordance with the law."
"The next matter that needs consideration is the manner the learned Magistrate"
"has  considered  the  defence  put  forward  by  the  petitioner.  It  appears  that  the"
"learned Magistrate has considered the defence on the basis that the petitioner"
"has decided to make a dock statement when he was called upon for his defence"

"The position in Sri Lanka as to the value that can be attached to a dock statement"
"by an accused was considered in the case of Queen Vs. Kularathne (1968) 71"
"NLR 529."
"The Court referred to King Vs. Vellayan Sittambaram (1918) 20 NLR 257 and"
"Queen  Vs.  Buddharakkita  Thero  (1962)  63  NLR  433  and  expressed  their"
"agreement  with  the  view  taken  in  the  latter  case  that  the  unsworn  statement"
