"E.R.S.R Coomaraswamay in his book the Law of Evidence Volume 01 at page"
"684 referred to bad character in the following manner."
"“Section 54 lays down the general rule that in criminal proceedings, the"
"fact  that  the  accused  has  a  bad  character  is  irrelevant,  except  in  the"
"exceptional  cases  mentioned  therein.  Evidence  may  not  be  given  of  the"
"accused’s previous convictions or misconduct on other occasions for the"
"purpose  of  supporting  and  argument  that  he  is  the  kind  of  person  who"
"would  commit  the  crime  charged.  As  Wigmore  puts  it,  “the  rule,  then,"
"firmly  and  universally  established  in  policy  and  tradition  is  that  the"
"prosecution may not initially attack the defendant’s character”."
"The  desire  for  fair  play  and  even  indulgence  has  led  to  this  rule.  The"
"principle underlying the rule is that hardship is possible, as evidence of"
"bad character may lead the mind of the judge or jury away from the point"
"to  be  decided,  namely,  the  guilt  or  innocence  of  the  accused  person  in"
"regard to the particular offence which he is charged. The main ground is"
"prejudice.”"
