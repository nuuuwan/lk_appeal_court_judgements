"prosecution, the defence must succeed; and that it should not be used"
"against another accused."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  learned  Magistrate  was  misdirected  when  the  dock"
"statement made by the petitioner was determined on a different footing, as I have"
"stated before."
"When  the  petitioner  preferred  the  appeal  against  his  conviction  before  the"
"Provincial  High  Court  of  the  North  Western  Province  holden  in  Kurunegala,  it"
"appears  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  too  has  decided  to  justify  the"
"conviction on the basis that it has not caused prejudice towards the petitioner."
"However, I am of the view that by allowing the character evidence against the"
"petitioner  to  be  led,  as  well  as  allowing  his  previous  conviction  record  to  be"
"known before he was found guilty, a clear violation of the fair trial principle has"
"been occasioned  towards the petitioner, which has not drawn the attention of"
"the learned High Court Judge."
"It is correct  to argue  when the  learned High  Court Judge determined that the"
"learned  Magistrate  has  considered  the  dock  statement  of  the  petitioner  in  the"
"judgment. However, it is the view of this Court that it had been considered not"
"in the manner it should have been considered, which makes the determination"
"in that regard unacceptable."
"For  the  reasons  considered  as  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  petitioner  has"
"established  sufficient  exceptional  grounds  for  this  Court  to  intervene  into  the"
"judgment  of the  learned High Court Judge  of the  Provincial High Court  of the"
"North  Western  Province  holden  in  Kurunegala  and  also  that  of  the  learned"
"Magistrate of Pilassa, as both the said judgements cannot be allowed to stand."
