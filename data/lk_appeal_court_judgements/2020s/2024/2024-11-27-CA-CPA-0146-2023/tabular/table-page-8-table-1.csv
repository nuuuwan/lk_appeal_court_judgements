"He was of the view that the evidence of PW-01 was contrary to the provisions of"
"the  Evidence  Ordinance  where  character  evidence  cannot  be  led  unless  it  is"
"relevant. He submitted that this was a clear violation of the fair trial principle,"
"which has caused prejudice to the petitioner."
"Referring to the judgment, it was also submitted that the learned Magistrate has"
"failed  to  consider  the  defence  put  forward  by  the  petitioner  in  its  correct"
"perspective, and misdirected when it was determined that the accused has failed"
"to break the strength of the prosecution case."
"It was the position of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the same legal"
"matters were pointed out to the learned High Court Judge when this matter was"
"argued before the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in"
"Kurunegala. However, it was his position that the learned High Court Judge was"
"also misdirected when it was determined that what was stated as part of the B-"
"Report as to the previous convictions had not influenced the mind of the learned"
"Magistrate since she has not referred to previous convictions in pronouncing the"
"judgment."
"It was also submitted that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when"
"it was decided to disregard what was stated by PW-01 in his evidence as to the"
"bad character of the petitioner on the basis that it was not a reason to interfere"
"with the judgment of the learned Magistrate. It was pointed out that the learned"
"High Court Judge was misdirected again when the manner in which the learned"
"Magistrate has considered the defence of the petitioner was justified."
"It was the submission of the learned State Counsel that although the previous"
"conviction record of the petitioner has  been  submitted to  Court  before he was"
"found guilty to the charge, since the learned Magistrate who heard the evidence"
"had the judicial mind to disregard irrelevant evidence, that fact has not caused"
"any prejudice towards the petitioner or has denied a fair trial towards him."
