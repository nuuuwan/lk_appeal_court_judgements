"09.05.2017)  wherein  Justice  Padman  Surasena  has  stated  in  his  judgment"
"inter alia that:"
"â€œThis  would be  an  appropriate juncture  to  turn  to  the legal submission"
"made on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The position taken up"
"by the learned Deputy Solicitor General on behalf of them is that a writ"
"cannot  lie  since  the  issue  of  whether  this  organization  is  a  welfare"
"organization or not is a disputed fact."
"I
t is the view of this Court, in the light of the above material, that the 1st"
"and the 2nd Respondents do not appear to have or are in a position to"
"controvert any of the above facts leading to the negation of the proposition"
"that the 3rd Respondent is an employee of the 1st Petitioner. All that the"
"1st and 2nd Respondents have done is to have made a bare statement"
"that  a  writ  cannot  lie  since  the  issue  whether  the  1st  Petitioner  is  a"
"welfare organization or not is a disputed fact."
"I
t must be stressed by this Court that mere denial of a fact by a party or"
"a mere statement that a fact is a disputed fact would not be sufficient to"
"push such a fact under the umbrella of disputed facts. If this Court is to"
"consider such mere denial to be sufficient, this Court would be compelled"
"to refuse the issuance of writs whenever any such statement in the form"
"of 'I deny,' 'I am unaware,' 'I place the burden on the other party to prove,'"
