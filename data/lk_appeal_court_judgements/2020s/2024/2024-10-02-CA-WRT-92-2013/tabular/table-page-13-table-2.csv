"that  a  dispute  can  be  referred  for  settlement  only  if  the  Dispute  arose  while  the"
"relationship  of  Employer-Workman  subsists.  I  would  like  to  draw  attention  to  the"
"observations made by Senanayake, J in the above case."
"“I am unable to agree that the 1st Respondent could act under Section 4 (1), where there"
"was  no  Industrial  Dispute  existing  at  the  time  where  the  workman  ceased  to  be  an"
"employee. An Industrial Dispute must necessarily arise at the time of employment, not after"
"the cessation of employment either voluntarily or by termination. If one were to take the"
"view that there could be an Industrial Dispute after cessation of employment, we would be"
"opening the gateway for all employees to refer matters for arbitration in terms of Section 4"
"(1) of the Act even after passage of a long period.” (at p. 59)…In the circumstances, I hold"
"that the Minister's order referring the purported dispute between the petitioner and the 4th"
"respondent is ultra vires Section 4 (1) of the Act."
