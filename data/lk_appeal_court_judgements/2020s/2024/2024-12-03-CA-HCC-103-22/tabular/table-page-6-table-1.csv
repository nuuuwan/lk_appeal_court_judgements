"The  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that  the  doctor  had  contradicted  the  victim"
"which I have dealt above and this too I do not see any merit which warrants a"
"variation of the final conclusion of the trial judge."
"The  other  disputed  points  of  the  counsel  for  the  accused  appellant  had  been"
"that the statement being belated and the mother not corroborating the victim."
"These  two  disputed points  also  I  have  dealt  above  and  have  concluded  that  it"
"has no merit."
"The learned trial judge in his judgement has referred to the grounds of appeal"
"and he has also considered the contradictions marked by the defence from V1"
"to V17 and has rejected the dock statement of the appellant on the basis that it"
"has not created a reasonable doubt in the evidence of the victim."
"As  such,  considering  the  above  mentioned  material  it  is  the  opinion  of  this"
"court  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  by  the  appellant  has  not  created"
"circumstances to set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial"
"judge."
"Hence, the instant appeal is dismissed and the sentence and the conviction of"
"the appellant are hereby affirmed."
