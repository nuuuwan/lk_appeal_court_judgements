"Court in the judicial hierarchy."
"Another issue raised by the Respondent is that the Appellant failed to outline any"
"exceptional circumstances in the Petition to the High Court that would justify the"
"exercise of the High Court's revisionary jurisdiction. However, the learned High"
"Court Judge did not assess the merits of the application; instead, he rejected the"
"Appellant's application solely on the basis that the High Court lacked jurisdiction"
"over the order made by the learned Magistrate under the State Land (Recovery"
"of Possession) Act."
"Therefore, this Court need not engage with the aforementioned matter."
"Conclusion"
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  order  (ආඥාව)  of"
"ejectment issued by the learned Magistrate under Section 10 of the State Land"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act clearly falls within the scope of Article 154P(3)(b)"
"of the Constitution."
"Therefore,  I  hold  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  erred  in  dismissing  the"
"Revision Application filed by the Appellant on the grounds that the High Court"
"lacks  jurisdiction.  I  set  aside  the  order  of  the  High  Court  Judge  of  Ratnapura"
"dated 3rd August 2016 and direct the sitting judge of the High Court of Ratnapura"
"to hear and determine this application on its merits expeditiously. No costs."
