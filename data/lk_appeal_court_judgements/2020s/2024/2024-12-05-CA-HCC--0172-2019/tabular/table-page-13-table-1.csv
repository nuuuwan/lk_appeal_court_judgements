"CA/HCC/172/19"
"In  this  case  the  raid  was  conducted  on  information  received.  Further,  the"
"raid conducted and the recovery of productions have failed to pass the test"
"of  probability  in  this  case.  If  the  learned  Trial  Judge  had  examined  the"
"evidence presented from the correct perspective, he would have been inclined"
"to accept the testimony provided by the Appellant."
"Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the 1st, 2nd, and"
"3rd  grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant  have  very  serious  impact  on  the"
"prosecution case."
"As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable"
"doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High"
"Court Judge of Colombo dated 20/06/2019 on the Appellant. Therefore, he"
"is acquitted from this case."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
