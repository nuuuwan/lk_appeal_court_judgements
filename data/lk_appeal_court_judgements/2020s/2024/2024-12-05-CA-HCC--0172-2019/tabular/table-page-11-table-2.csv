"In Sisilinona v Balasuriya [2002] 1 SLR 404 the Court held that:"
"“The court must not question the witness in the spirit of beating him down"
"or encourage him to give answers accepting the position put to the witness-"
"It appears that the intention of the trial judge had been not to ascertain the"
"truth  of  the  matter  but  to  obtain  contradictions  which  he  did.  In  the"
"circumstances the conclusions arrived at by the trial judge are untenable.”"
