"CA/HCC/0368-372/18"
"Under Section 138 of the Penal Code, an assembly of five or more persons is"
"an unlawful assembly if it has a common object to contravene domestic law."
"I
n Kulatunga v Mudalihamy (1940) 18 TLR 21 the court held that:"
"“To prove a charge of unlawful assembly punishable under Section 140"
"of the Penal Code against an accused person it must be established that"
"the accused knew the common object; and that he intentionally joined"
"the unlawful assembly and was a member of the unlawful assembly."
"I
n  Samy  and  Others  v  Attorney  General  (Bindunuwewa  Murder  case)"
"[2007] 2 SLR 216 the court held that:"
"“It is settled law that mere presence of a person at the place where the"
"members of an unlawful assembly had gathered for carrying out their"
"illegal common objects does not make him a member of such assembly."
"The presumption of innocence would preclude such a conclusion."
"Hence,  the  case  against  every 
individual  accused  must  be  considered"
"separately and that omnibus evidence of general character must be closely"
"scrutinized in order to eliminate false or mistaken implications for innocent"
"persons."
"The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at paragraphs 54, 55, and"
"56 had very clearly analysed the evidence given by the lay witnesses against"
"Appellants.  Further,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge,  after  considering  the"
"legal  analysis  of  unlawful  assembly,  had  very  correctly 
found  all 
the"
"Appellants  including  3rd  Appellant  and  9th  Accused  guilty  of  the  charges."
"Hence, I find no merit to any of the grounds raised by the 2nd Appellant."
"The  3rd  Appellant  in  his  sole  appeal  ground  contends  that  Learned  High"
"Court  Judge  misdirected  himself  that  the  3rd  Appellant  had  a  motive  to"
"commit  the  murder  and 
failed  to  consider  that  the  3rd  Appellant  was"
"provoked."
