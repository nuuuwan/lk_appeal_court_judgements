"T
he 2nd accused travelled in the van with the appellant. The appellant"
"was in the driving seat and the 2nd accused was in the left front seat."
"The  firearm  and  the  ammunitions  were  under  the  carpet  below  the"
"driving  seat  where  the  1st  accused  was  seated  and  drove  the  vehicle."
"Therefore,  it  has  already  been  decided  that  the  appellant  had  the"
"knowledge about the thing that was under the carpet. The 2nd accused"
"may have noticed that the carpet was protruded than normal or he may"
"have  not  noticed.  There  is  a  doubt  about  the  knowledge  of  the  2nd"
"accused. The benefit of the doubt has to be given to the 2nd accused."
"Therefore, the learned High Court Judge is correct in deciding that there"
"is no evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd accused"
"had  the  knowledge  about  the  firearm  or  the  ammunitions.  Hence,"
"acquittal of the 2nd accused has no impact in deciding the 1st accused-"
"appellantâ€™s case."
