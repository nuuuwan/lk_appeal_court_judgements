"discretion:"
"""In the present instance, as in many others, what comes for determination is"
"a  matter  to  be  settled  by  discretion,  involving  no  law.  It  will,  I  suppose,"
"usually be of an administrative kind; but sometimes it will involve matter of"
"law as well as matter of fact, or even depend on matter of law alone. In such"
"cases [they] will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts. I"
"need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and listen fairly"
"to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything."
"But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as though it were"
"a  trial.  They  have  no  power  to  administer  an  oath,  and  need  not  examine"
"witnesses. They can obtain information in any way they think best, always"
