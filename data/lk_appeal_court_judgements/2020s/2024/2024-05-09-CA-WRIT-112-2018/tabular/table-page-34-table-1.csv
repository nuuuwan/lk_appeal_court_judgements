"informed  the  factory  owner  after  2  or  more  days]  in  which  the  Attorney"
"General  cited  Faleel’s  case,  in  my  judgments  C.  A.  Writ  195  2020  dated"
"22.09.2022, C. A. Writ 196 2022 dated 03.05.2024 and C. A. Writ 198 2020"
"which incidentally will be given today, 10th May 2024, I have been referring"
"to the statement of Fortescue J.; and presently consider delving more on the"
"factual basis of John’s case."
"Firstly, this is what Ismail J., said,"
"“The submission on behalf of the petitioner is that there was no situation of"
"emergency, a critical situation, a destablising factor or a compelling reason"
"to  resort  to  a  holding  operation  by  way  of  a  suspension.  Learned  Counsel"
"referred to the judgment of Lord Denning M. R. in Lewis v. Hefer (3) in which"
"he used the term holding operation after quoting Megarry J. in John v. Pees"
"(4). It arose in this manner. In the course of the submissions in John v. Rees"
"it was the contention of the counsel for the plaintiff that the rules of natural"
"justice apply not only to expulsion or dismissal, but also to suspension from"
"office, and among the cases cited by him were Burn v. National Amalgamated"
"Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland (5),….”"
"Having examined a case decided by Denning L. J., too, which will be referred"
"to in due course, Ismail J., decided that as per the facts in that case a hearing"
"prior to the decision was not necessary."
"But in John vs. Rees itself, [of which I have the original law report from the"
"Judges’  Library]  Megarry  J.,  decided,  that,  the  rule  audi  alteram  partem"
"should have been followed."
"The facts were as follows,"
"“On  March  27,  1968,  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Pembrokeshire,  Mr."
"Desmond Donnelly, was expelled from the Labour Party. Ten days later, on"
"April  6,  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Pembrokeshire  Divisional  Labour  Party"
"(referred to as P.D.L.P.), took place. At the start of the meeting, Mr. James"
