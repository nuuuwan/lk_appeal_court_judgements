"""Even more serious is the violation of the two cardinal principles of natural"
"justice  embodied  in  the  maxims  'audi  alteram  partem'  and  'nemo  judex  in"
"causa sua potest'. The first of these principles postulates a fair hearing before"
"the  rights  of  a  citizen  are  affected  by  a  quasi  judicial  or  administrative"
"decision. In this context, it is now recognised that 'qui aliquid statuerit parte"
"in audita altera acquum licet discerit, haud acquum fecerit' - which means"
"that he who determines any matter without hearing both sides, though he"
"may have decided right, has not done justice. According to the jurisprudence"
"built around the 'audi alteram partem' principal, there should not only be a"
"hearing of both sides, but the hearing should be more than a pretence. The"
"procedure  followed  should  be  fair  and  conducive  to  the  achievement  of"
"justice. In Board of Education v Ricell Lord Loreburn, L. C. in his famo us"
"dictum laid down that a tribunal was under duty to ""act in good faith, and"
"fairly listen to bath sides for that is a duty lying upon everyone who decides"
"anything."" In De Verteuil v Knaqqs it was laid down as follows: ""In general,"
"the requirements of natural justice are first, that the person accused should"
"know the nature of the accusation made; secondly, that he should be given"
"an opportunity to state his case; and thirdly, that the tribunal should act in"
"good faith‚Äù"
