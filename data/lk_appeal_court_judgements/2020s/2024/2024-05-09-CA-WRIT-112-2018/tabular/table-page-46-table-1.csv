"","had been ad libitum, yet a Temporal Court could not grant a mandamus. It is like the case of a"
"","recorder  of  a  corporation  who  was  removeable  at  will,  and  being  displaced  moved  for  a"
"","mandamus, but it was denied. Besides, the constant course and custom of this university warrants"
"","a dis cretionary power amongst them to confer degrees on some, and to degrade others for any"
"","contempt;  and  in  this  case  they  have  done  all  they  could  to  bring  Dr.  Bentley  to  an  easy"
"","agreement;  for  after  the  first  summons  they  sent  another  in  writing  by  their  beadle,  but  the"
"","doctor's doors were then shut, and he would not be seen ; then they adjourned from day to day,"
"","on  purpose  to  give  him 
leave  to  appear,  before  they  would  suspend  him  ;  but  when  he"
"","contemptuously  declined, 
they 
first  suspended  and  afterwards  degraded  him.  Now  as  a"
"","mandamus was  never  yet granted  to admit a man to a  degree  in the  university, after he had"
"","performed all his exercises, so there ought to be none to restore one after a degradation, because"
"","degrees are arbitrarily given by the universities, and so are degradations arbitrarily made; for if"
"","they should by any means rashly admit an unlearned man to a degree, they may  upon better"
"","information degrade him, without taking a traverse to the return of a mandamus, which must be"
"","tried by a jury of lay freeholders. Besides, these degrees are but titles of honour and precedency,"
"","and give no temporal right, and for that reason a mandamus ought not to go ; for if a knight should"
"","be degraded in a Court of Honour, no mandamus would lie to restore him (a), which is a case in"
"","point ; therefore if it should lie in this case, it would introduce a new method to evade [150] the"
"","privileges given by this charter, which was afterwards confirmed by Parliament; and as it hath"
"","been formerly adjudged in the case of Castle v. Litchfield (b), that a certiorari or writ of error will"
"","not lie to correct a judgment given for a contempt, so no mandamus ought to go, which is in effect"
"","the same. If it should be objected, that his degree qualifies him for some temporal employment,"
"","of which he would be incapable without it; now admitting that to be true, yet such employments"
"","are only consequential, and not directly incident to his degree, and therefore ought not to be"
"","regarded. And is another objection should be made, viz. that the doctor would have appeared by"
"","a proctor, but was not allowed so to do; though this may be true, yet it is no objection of weight,"
"","because it might not be the course of their court to admit such appearances, and the universities"
"","have a privilege to proceed according to their own laws, as an encouragement to learning; and if"
"","they have proceeded accordingly, this Court will not interpose. Now take the case as it stands"
"","upon Dr. Bentley's affidavit, there will be no reason to grant a mandamus; for he makes oath, that"
"","he has appealed from the sentence of the University Court; which if true, then there is another"
"","remedy  for  him  to  be  restored,  viz.  by  an  appeal  ;  and  where  there  is  another  remedy,  a"
"","mandamus is never granted. Moreover the doctor made oath, that the university had no power"
"","to  degrade  him  ;  if  so,  then  he  is  not  degraded  for  want  of  a  sufficient  power  so  to  do,  and"
"","consequently a mandamus ought not to go, for it is impossible that a man should be restored to"
"","his degree who was never degraded."
"","But on the  other side it was said, that the merits of this cause ought not to be argued upon a"
"","motion, but upon the return of the mandamus; and for that reason it ought to be granted."
"","The Court. All care shall be taken that justice shall be duly administered in the universities ; but if"
"","they assume an arbitrary power exempt from the jurisdiction of any other Court of Judicature,"
"","then  they  may  do  what  they  please  without  cotitroul  ,  and  where  people  are  under  such  a"
"","government, they are in a very bad condition. But this Court hath a greater regard to the learning"
"","of the universities than to admit the arbitrary sentence of a vice-chancellor to be final. [151] As"
