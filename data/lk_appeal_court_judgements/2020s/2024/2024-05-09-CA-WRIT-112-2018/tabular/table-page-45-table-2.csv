"","","“CASE 94. THE KING against THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. [Referred to, Bonaker v. Evans,"
"","1850, 16 Q. B. 171 ; Marquis of Abergavenny v. Bishop of Llandaff, 1888, 20 Q. B. D. 472.]",""
"","","Time allowed to shew cause to a mandamus. A mandamus lies to restore a member of a university"
"","","to  doctor's  degrees,  from  which  he  had  been  degraded  by  the  University  Court  for  speaking"
"","","contemptuous words of the vice-chancellor, and of the process of the Court.-S. C. 2 Ld. Ray. 1334."
"","S. C. Stra. 557. S. C. Fort. 202.",""
"","","Mandamus to the vice-chancellor, masters, and scholars of Cambridge, to restore Dr. Bentley to"
"","","the  degrees  to  which  he  had  been  admitted  by  the  university,  and  had  been  surreptiously"
"","","degraded (as was suggested), or that they should shew cause why he should not be restored."
"","","The counsel for the university desired time to shew cause why a mandamus should not go, for"
"","","that there were several old books and charters which were necessary to be inspected before they"
"","could shew cause.",""
"","And thereupon the time was enlarged for that purpose.",""
"","And upon another day.",""
"","","It was argued for the university, that by virtue of a charter given to them by Queen Elizabeth, they"
"","","had a Court of Judicature to try and determine all matters arising within their jurisdiction, in which"
"","","Court a plaint was levied by Dr. Middleton against Dr. Bentley, and thereupon a summons was"
"","","sent by the beadle to the doctor, which he received, and spoke contemptuous words of the court,"
"","","for which he was degraded, and from which no appeal would lie; no more than a writ of error"
"","","would lie for imposing a fine by a Temporal Court for a contempt, because every Court of Record"
"","","is entrusted with the final judgment of what shall be a contempt to their anthority; therefore if"
"","","an appeal or a writ of error would lie in such case, it would put the trial of what is a contempt"
"","","[149] to the discretion and judgment of a Superior Court, and to strip an Inferior Court of that"
"","","power which they have by law to judge what is a contempt to them; whereas contempts of the"
"","","authority of Courts are undoubtedly to be judged by the same Courts to whom the contempt is"
"","","offered which is the reason that a writ of error will not lie on a sentence for a contempt to this"
"","","Court ; but then it must be plainly proved. Now the same thing is done by a mandamus after an"
"","","indirect manner as would have been done by an appeal or writ of error, if that would lie ; but as"
"","","an appeal will not lie for a contempt, so neither will a mandamus ; for admitting this degradation"
