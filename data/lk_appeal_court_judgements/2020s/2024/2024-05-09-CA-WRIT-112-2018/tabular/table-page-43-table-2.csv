"the governor and prison officers that they left behind them."""
"Nevertheless, after making all due allowances for an age of semantic laxity"
"I do not think the word “re organize” can be held to comprehend a process"
"which in substance amounts to expulsion without a charge and without"
"an opportunity to meet it. The more indefinite the language, the less apt it"
"is  to  exclude  the  members’  reasonable  expectation  of  being  accorded"
"natural justice.”"
"I also bear in mind the rule that, in general, a failure to give due notice of"
"a  meeting  to  even  one  member  of  a  body  who  is  entitled  to  attend"
"invalidates the decisions of that body: see, for example, Smyth v. Darley"
"(I849) 2 H.L. Cas, 789, concerning the election of an officer, and Young v."

"members of the local Labour Party: and it is clear that this was due not to"
"inadvertence  or  accident  but  to  deliberation.  It  follows  that  the  meeting"
"was not validly constituted, and so its proceedings were void. In the words"
"of Lord Campbell L.C. in Smyth v, Darley, at p. 803, ""even a unanimous"
"election by those who did attend would be void,"""
