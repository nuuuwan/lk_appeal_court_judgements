"is prescribed for by the university, yet that prescription must be presumed to be founded upon a"
"right derived by authority from the Crown; so that a person advanced to the degree of a doctor,"
"&c. may be esteemed to be advanced by the King. There were no degrees among the Grecians or"
"Romans, nor among the first Christians ; they began about the twelfth or thirteenth century, and"
"have been since attended with great privileges and profits, universitatis is the proper Latin word"
"for corporation. A learned man of this university told me, that there were no degrees ever granted"
"there until the university was a corporation. The seminaries for education of youth were antiently"
"held  in  the  cathedrals  of  the  churches  of  the  first  Christians.  Besides,  where  any  person  is"
"degraded for a contumacy, it ought to be by that court to whom the contempt was offered; but it"
"is not pretended by this return, that the vice-chancellor's court had any power to degrade. Neither"
"does it appear that Dr. Bentley was ever summoned to answer this contempt ; and it is against"
"natural justice to deprive a man of his right before he is heard ; therefore if there was a custom"
"so to do, such custom would be absolutely void ; and it is a thing of daily experience to grant"
"prohibitions to Spiritual Courts, if  they deny the defendants a copy of the libel, because  such"
"denial is against natural justice. And now to offer a common instance, viz. suppose an officer of"
"this  Court  should  show  any  contempt  thereof,  could  he  be  deprived  of  his  office  for  such"
"contempt? Certainly he could not. It is true, they who have argued for the university insisted, that"
"the  proceedings  there  are  according  to  the  civil  law,  and  this  they  have  done  to  justify  the"
"suspension, without being summoned to answer the contempt; but it does not appear upon the"
"return (upon which this Court is (164] to judge), that they proceed there by the civil law ; and if"
"so, then the Court must intend that they proceed by the common law, which they have not done,"
"for  there  is  no  manner  of  proof  that  the  doctor  was  surnmoned  to  appear  to  answer  the"
"contempt; and it can never be said, that a court which proceeds according to the common (a) law,"
"shall suspend or degrade a person without being heard or summoned. It is said likewise, that this"
"was not a proceeding by virtue of a charter alone, but by a charter-confirmed by Act of Parliament."
"Now admitting that to be true, it must be granted that convictions, even upon Acts of Parliament,"
"are frequently quashed, for not summoning the persons convicted, though not required by the"
"statute,  because  it  is  still  against  natural  justice  to  convict  without  hearing,  The  want  of  a"
"summons is an objection that can never be got over. Had the custom been returned to deprive"
"without summons, it had been void, as against natural justice. If a justice of peace convict any"
"man without a summons, such conviction is void. I heard a learned civilian say, that God himself"
"would not condemn Adam for his transgression until he had called him to know what he could say"
"in his defence. Gen. iii. 9. Such proceeding is agreeable to justice. Admitting the university has a"
"jurisdiction,  yet  this  Court  will  inquire  what  they  have  done,  and  how  they  have  used  that"
"jurisdiction, as it was done in * Bushel's case, where it was insisted, that the merits of the cause"
"could not be inquired into upon the return of a habeas corpes, but it was over-ruled ; and this"
"Cou-t.cannot affirm the proceedings in this case without over-ruling Bushel's case, and several"
"other authorities of the like nature."
"For which reasons the Court was unanimous in granting a peremptory mandamus; and in Easter"
"term, in the tenth year of George the First, the doctor was restored to his degree."
