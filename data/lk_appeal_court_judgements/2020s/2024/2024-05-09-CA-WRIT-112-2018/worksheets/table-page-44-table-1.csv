"something is obvious,"" they may say, “why force everybody to go through"
"the  tiresome  waste  of  time  involved  in  framing  charges  and  giving  an"
"opportunity to be heard? The result is obvious from the start.” Those who"
"take this view do not, I think, do themselves justice. As everybody who has"
"anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is strewn with"
"examples  of  open  and  shut  cases  which,  somehow,  were  not:  of"
"unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered: of"
"inexplicable conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable"
"determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change. Nor are those with"
"any knowledge of human nature who pause to think for a moment likely"
"to  underestimate  the  feelings  of  resentment  of  those  who  find  that  a"
"decision  against  them  has  been  made  without  their  being  afforded  any"
"opportunity to influence the course of events."
"Let me add this. What was done was, in my judgment, wrong; but there is"
"nothing before me to suggest that it was consciously wrong. I do not for"
"one  moment  say  that  the  N.E.C.  deliberately  or  knowingly  resolved  to"
"ignore the rules of natural justice. There is no evidence before me on the"
"point, but it may very well be that the thought never entered the minds of"
"the members of that committee. I am content to assume that the process"
"of “getting round all problems relating to expulsion"" was not the object of"
"the committee, but merely the contention of the advocate seeking, quite"
"properly,  to  make  the  best  that  he  could  of  what  had  been  done."
"Nevertheless, however innocent the committee, what was done was wrong."
"It  follows  that,  subject  to  any  argument  that  there  may  be  about  the"
"precise  terms  of  the  order,  the  plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the  injunctions"
"sought by the notice of motion.”"
