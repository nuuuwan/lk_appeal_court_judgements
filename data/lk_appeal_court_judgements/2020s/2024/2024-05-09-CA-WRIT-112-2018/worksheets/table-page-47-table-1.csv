"to what has been said, that the degrees in the universities are only honorary ; this is a mistake,"
"for they are blended with a temporal right so far as to deserve  a mandamus to restore a mal"
"degraded. It is true, this might have been a proper objection before the statutes of 21 Hen. 8, c."
"13, and 13 & 14 Car. 2, c. 4, were made, which render a man incapable of a benefice if he had not"
"taken his degrees in some university ; for before those statutes, such degrees were only titles of"
"precedency,  and  the  allowing  them,  or  a  degradation,  was  no  temporal  advantage  or  loss  ;"
"therefore  in such case  the  Temporal Courts had no reason to interpose  ; and this may  be  the"
"reason why the universities degraded ad libitim, and of their constant course so to do. But this is"
"no objection since the making those statutes. Neither shall it be said, that where a corporation"
"has  admitted  a  mal  willingly  to  his  freedom,  that  they  shall  have  power  to  disfranchise  him,"
"because they do not like him ; neither can the universities give degrees to whom they please, and"
"take them away ad libitum. AinI though their counsel have objected against this mandamus, for"
"that they have an exempt and absolute jurisdiction amongst them selves, this seems to be a good"
"reason why it should be granted, though it might have been otherwise if they had shewed that"
"they  had  a  visitor,  to  whom  an  appeal  would  lie  ;  for  probably  that  might  have  excluded  the"
"superintendency of this Court; but to deny a degree to him who had performed all his exercises"
"to qualify him for a degree, would be a great discouragement to learning; and in such case this"
"Court would grant a mandamus to admit him, especially since it is accompanied with a temporal"
"interest. Now admitting it should be enacted by some statute, that a mail should be incapable of"
"such an office if he was not a knight, should not a knight degraded have a mandamus? Certainly"
"he should ; and so had Dr. Bentley in this case."
"The mandamus was granted, and the university made this return:"
