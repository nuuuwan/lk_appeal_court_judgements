"Denning in Kanda v. Government of Malaya, (1962) AC 322 observed that"
"if the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything it must"
"carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made"
"against  him.  He  must  know  what  evidence  has  been  given  and  the"
