"under the provisions of this Act."
"U
nder  both  Acts,  non-registering  a  company  which  engage  in  Finance"
"Business need to registered and licensed. The outcome of violating this"
"requirement  would  end  up  in  a  criminal  prosecution  under  both  Acts."
"Hence  non-registering  Finance  Business  has  been  criminalised  under"
"both acts. Therefore, the offences prescribed in the repealed Act and the"
"new Act are identical and the new Act carry enhanced punishment than"
"the  repealed  Act.  Hence,  the  Petitioner  before  the  High  Court  took  up"
"the  position  that,  notwithstanding  that  with  the  enactment  of  Finance"
"Business Act 42 of 2011, the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988 got"
"repealed,  Section  71(2)  of  the  Finance  Business  Act  No.  42  of  2011"
"leaves  an  opening  for  the  requirement  of  the  registration  of  Finance"
"Companies Act alive and thereby it had continued to be a requirement"
"under the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011. Accordingly, the offence"
"which  is  committed  under  the  Finance  Business  Act  No.  42  of  2011"
"included any violation of the requirement under the Finance Companies"
"Act No. 78 of 1988."
"The Learned High Court Judge, not considering the Section 71(2) of Act"
"No.  42  of  2011,  held  that  Act  No.  42  of  2011  does  no  specifically"
"recognize  a  retrospective  effect  of  its  offences  under  Section  56  of  the"
"same.  It  was  further  held,  that  for  an  offence  to  have  a  retrospective"
"effect,  the  Act  which  created  the  offence  should  specifically  state  the"
"same in the Act."
"But  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  failed  to  consider  the  very"
"specific provision under Section 71(2) of Act No. 42 of 2011 which links"
"the two laws in all instances where it is not inconsistent with the new"
"law. Further, the change of laws should not pave way for the offenders"
