"is  a  gift  of  money  in  addition  to  salary  or  wages  voluntarily  made  to  a  retiring"
"employee for services rendered by him. This imports the conception of a gift or boon"
"otherwise  described  as  ‘ex  gratia’  payment.  In  industrial  law,  this  meaning  has"
"undergone  a  fundamental  change  in its  attribute  of  voluntariness.  Gratuity  can  no"
"longer be regarded as an ex gratia payment or merely as a matter of boon.”"
