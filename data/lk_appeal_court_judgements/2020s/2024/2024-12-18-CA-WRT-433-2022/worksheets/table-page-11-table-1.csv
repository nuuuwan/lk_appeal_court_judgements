"v.  Commissioner  General  of  Labour  and  Others  C.A.  (Writ)  Appl.  No.387/2013  decided  on"
"21.11.2017."
"â€œBy  way  of  another  addendum,  I  must  refer  to  Section  31B(1)(b)  of  the  Industrial"
"Disputes  Act  which  empowers  a  Labour  Tribunal  to  award  gratuity  to  a  workman"
"when he has worked in an industry which has employed less than 15 workmen. By"
"way of contrast, Section 5 of the Payment of Gratuity Act empowers the Commissioner"
"of  Labour  to  oversee  the  payment  of  gratuity  to  a  workman  when  he  has  been"
"employed  by  an  employer  who  has  employed  15  or  more  workmen.  Thus  the"
"underlying  metwand  is  that  there  are  two  regimes  for  payment  of  gratuity.  An"
"employer who employs in terms of the Act is cast upon the liability to pay only if he"
"has employed 15 workmen or more, whereas the regime under the Industrial Disputes"
"Act  empowers  the  Labour  Tribunal  to  award  gratuity  when  there  are  less  than  15"
"employees.  An  additional  jurisdiction  given  to  the  Labour  Tribunal  is  that  if  an"
"employer  who  has  or  has  had  more  than  15  workmen  during  the  period  of  1  year"
"preceding  the  date  of  termination  of  services  of  a  workman  has  terminated  the"
"services of the workman on grounds of misconduct as set out in Section 13, the Labour"
"Tribunal is bound to assess the correctness of the decision. Given that the services of"
"the  5th  Respondent  were  terminated  on  disciplinary  grounds  such  as  fraud  and"
"misappropriation, it would appear that Section 13 of the Act read with Section 31B"
"(1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act would be engaged and consequently it would be"
"the  Labour  Tribunal  which  has  to  go  into  the  correctness  of  the  decision  to  forfeit"
"gratuity. But the gravamen of the contention before this Court is that by letter dated"
