"(b)  the  person  so  deceived  should  be  intentionally  induced  to  do  or  omit  to  do"
"anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and"
"(3) in cases covered by (2) (b), the act or omission should cause or is likely to cause"
"damage or harm to the person induced in body, mind, reputation or property.”"
"This was considered by His Lordship N. Bandula Karunarathna J. (as he was then) in"
"Athputharaja Wijayarajan Vs. Attorney General, Court of Appeal Case No. CA 235/2011,"
"decided on 22.11.2021 and held that;"
"“On evidence led in this case, it is abundantly clear that the main ingredient of the"
"offence  of  cheating  ""deception""  has  not  been  practised  by  the  accused-appellant"
"towards the complainant.”"
"There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  the  Petitioner  has  deceived  the  2nd  Respondent  into"
"parting with a sum of Rs. 16,200,000/-. On the other hand, the Petitioner’s position is that"
"she has transferred the amount to a third party namely Dr. Chaturvedi. Therefore, the"
"Petitioner has not gained anything wrongfully. To prove misappropriation, there should"
"be evidence that the Petitioner has utilized such money for her own use. The documents"
"speak that there is no intention of defrauding."
"Thus,  this  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  criminal  liability  cannot  be  imposed  on  the"
"Petitioner  as  there  is  no  evidence  or  material  whatsoever  to  prove  the  intention  of  the"
"Petitioner to cheat and thereby dishonestly induce the 2nd Respondent to credit the said"
"transaction fee to the Petitioner’s bank account."
"I  am  mindful  of  the  principle  of  the  Writ  of  Prohibition  as  discussed  in  the  following"
"authorities."
