"","“On  the  other  hand,  the  object  of  prohibition  is  prevention  rather  than  cure."
"","Prohibition  is  issued  when  the  proceedings  before  the  concerned  body  are  still"
"","pending and the matter has not been disposed of but is still being considered by"
"","the concerned decision-making body. The function of prohibition is to prohibit the"
"","body concerned from proceeding with the matter further. If proceedings before the"
"","concerned  body  have  come  to  an  end then  only  certiorari  can  be issued  as  there"
"remains nothing to prohibit.",""
"","For  example,  if  a  tribunal  takes  up  for  hearing  a  matter  which  lies  outside  its"
"","jurisdiction,  the  concerned  person  can  seek  a  writ  of  prohibition  from  the  High"
"","Court to prohibit the tribunal from continuing the proceedings further. If, on the"
"other  hand,  the  tribunal  has  already  rendered","its  decision,  then  the  party"
"","concerned seeks a certiorari to quash the decision of the tribunal. There may be a"
"","proceeding before an inferior body where both certiorari and prohibition may lie."
"","If the tribunal has decided something without finally disposing of the matter, then"
"","the  interested  person  can  seek  certiorari  to  quash  what  has  been  decided  and"
"","prohibition  to  stop  the  tribunal  from  proceeding  further  in  the  matter.  Thus,"
"","certiorari and prohibition differ from each other from a functional point of view.”"
