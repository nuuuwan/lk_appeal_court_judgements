"The first is Section 56(1) of the Ordinance, which provides that, “The nomination of"
"a  successor  and  the  cancellation  of  any  such  nomination  shall  be  effected  by  a"
"document  substantially  in  the prescribed  form  executed  and witnessed  in triplicate"
"before  a  Government  Agent,  or  a  Registrar  of  Lands,  or  a  divisional  Assistant"
"Government Agent, or a notary, or a Justice of the Peace.”"
"The second is Section 58(1) which goes on to state that, “A document (other than a"
"last will) whereby the nomination of a successor is effected or cancelled shall not be"
"valid unless and until it has been registered by the Registrar of Lands of the district"
"in which the holding or land to which that document refers is situated.”"
"The final section is Section 60 of the Ordinance, in terms of which, “No nomination ...."
"of a successor shall be valid unless the document (other than a last will) effecting such"
"nomination  ....  is  duly  registered  before  the  date  of  the  death  of  the  owner  of  the"
"holding or the permit-holder.”"
"The cumulative effect of these three Sections is that a nomination carried out in the"
"prescribed manner must be registered by the Registrar of Lands during the life time"
"of the owner or permit holder, for such nomination to be valid."
"The Respondents have filed together with their motion dated 7th June 2019 a copy of"
"the permit ‘P1’ which clearly shows that the name of Manamperige Hamina has been"
"nominated as the successor. However, the Land Ledger pertaining to the said permit,"
"which  has  also  been  submitted  with  the  said  motion,  does  not  contain  the  first"
"nomination made in ‘P1’ of Asilin, or the nomination of Manamperige Hamina. The"
"validity of the nomination of a successor which has not been registered in conformity"
