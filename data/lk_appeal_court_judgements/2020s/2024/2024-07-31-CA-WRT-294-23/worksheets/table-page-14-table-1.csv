"a successor’. Based on that application the names of the appellant and the respondent"
"were  entered  as  successors of  the said  Jamis by  P4 dated  17.06.1993.  It  is  also  not"
"disputed  that  the  said  Jamis  had  died  on  25.05.1994  (P10).  The  contention  of  the"
"learned Counsel for the respondent was that by letter dated 05.04.1994 (V1), the said"
"Jamis had written to the Divisional Secretary, Medirigiriya requesting to nominate"
"the respondent as his successor to the land in question. On the basis of this document,"
"the  said  respondent’s  name  had  been  entered  in  to  the  Register  of  Permits/Grants"
"under the Land Development Ordinance (P5). The said registration has been effected"
"on 22.11.1994."
"According  to  section  60  of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance,  referred  to  above,  a"
"nomination  would  become  effective,  only  if  such  nomination  or  cancellation  is  duly"
"registered before the date of the death of the owner of the holding or the permit-holder."
"It is therefore quite obvious that the nomination of the respondent had been registered"
"on  a  date  several  months  after  the  death  of  the  said  Jamis,  who  was  the  permit-"
"holder.”"
