"Petitionerâ€™s  father  had  nominated  both  the  Petitioner  and  the  6th  Respondent  as  the"
"successors of the said land. This authorization was disputed by the Petitioner."
"Further, the Petitioner contends that she was informed by the letter dated 19.05.2023 issued"
"by  the  Divisional  Secretary  marked  as  P20  that  the  grant/rights  given  on  08.03.2019  was"
"thereby  cancelled  and  the 
land  would  be  divided  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  6th"
"Respondent in equal shares."
"Further, as stated in the petition, the 5th Respondent, Grama Niladhari had tried to enter"
"into the said land to conduct a survey which failed as the Petitioner and her mother were not"
"in the said premises and the gate being locked. The Petitioner further states that when the"
"Petitioner informed by the letter dated 29.05.2023 of her intention to institute legal action"
"against  the  said  decision,  the  2nd  Respondent  informed  that  she  will  proceed  with  the"
"instruction of the Commissioner of General Lands to divide the land and that the Petitioner"
"is free to proceed with the litigation."
"The  contention  of  the  Petitioner 
is  that  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  have  acted 
in"
"contravention  of  the  procedure  laid  down  in  the  Land  Development  Ordinance  and  the"
"principle of natural justice."
"Further,  the  Petitioner  contends  that  the  decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  to  cancel  the"
"certificate  of  ownership  and  divide  the  said 
land  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  6th"
"Respondent in equal shares is ultra vires as they have not followed the proper procedure laid"
"down in the Ordinance."
