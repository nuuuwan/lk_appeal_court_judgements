"the holding or the permit-holder"" the nomination of the defendant; if there be such a"
"nomination is of no effect and does not pass title to her. To overcome this obstacle,"
"learned Counsel for the defendant has called into aid two legal maxims viz: (1) lex non"
"cogit ad impossibilia and (2) the principle of nunc pro tune."
"Further his Lordship held that:"
"“I do not see any reason why the nominations could not be registered before such issue,"
"because  these  lands  had  been  the  subject  matter  of  transactions  even  during  the"
"lifetime of the defendant's mother. In these circumstances, even if this maxim could"
"be  applied  to  a  situation  where  a  nomination  had  not  been  registered  during  the"
"lifetime of the owner, in compliance with the mandatory requirement of Section 60, I"
"do not think that in the circumstances of this case, the application of that maxim is"
"justified.”"

"No. 82/2008, Decided on 26.10.2010 (2012 BLR 248 at page 249) that:"
"One  of  the  questions  that  arose  before  the  District  Court  was  whether  the  said"
"document  marked  as  P5  was  a  valid  document  in  terms  of  the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance."
"It  is  not  disputed  that  the  deceased  Palate  Gedera  Jamis  was  the  original  permit"
"holder and that the land in question was alienated under and in terms of the Land"
"Development  Ordinance  on  25.01.1982  (P3).  Accordingly,  succession  to  such  land"
"would be decided on the basis of the provisions laid down under the Land Development"
"Ordinance. Chapter VII of the Land Development Ordinance deals with the successors"
