"In this case, on perusal of the proceedings it is clear that the Learned High"
"Court Judge had not put questions which are detrimental to defenceâ€™s right."
"Further,  he  had  not  based  solely  his  findings  on  the  questions  put  to  the"
"witnesses by him. Therefore, this ground of appeal also devoid any merit."
"In this case PW1 and PW2 are key witnesses. Their evidence is clear, cogent,"
"and unambiguous. The court considering all other evidence presented by the"
"prosecution, without any hesitation relied on that evidence and convicted the"
"Appellant. Further, their evidence has passed the probability test."
"As the prosecution had proven this case beyond reasonable doubt, I affirm"
"the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge"
"of  Colombo  dated  13.12.2019  on  the  Appellant.  Therefore,  his  appeal  is"
"dismissed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
