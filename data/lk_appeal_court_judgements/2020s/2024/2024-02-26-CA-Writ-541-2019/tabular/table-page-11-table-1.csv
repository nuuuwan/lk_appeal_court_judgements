"petition against the award which was dismissed by a non-speaking order. Thereafter the"
"employer approached the High Court by preferring a petition under Article 226 of the"
"Constitution  seeking  to  quash  the  award  of  the  Labour  Court.  On  behalf  of  the"
"employee, the principal contention raised was that in view of the order of the Supreme"
"Court dismissing the special leave petition preferred against the award of the Labour"
"Court, it is not legally open to the employer to approach the High Court under Article"
"226 of the Constitution challenging the very same award. The High Court decided that"
"the doctrine of election is applicable, and the employer having chosen the remedy of"
"approaching a superior court and having failed therein could not thereafter resort to the"
"alternative remedy of approaching the High Court. This decision of the High Court was"
"put in issue before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the view taken by"
"the High Court was not correct and that the High Court should have gone into the merits"
"of the Writ petition."
"Referring to two earlier decisions, it was further held,"
