"Although  it  was  contended  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to"
"consider the material contraindications of PW-01 and 02, I am unable to agree"
"that  there  were  material  contradictions  between  their  evidence  in  view  of  the"
"admissions made by the appellant in his dock statement."
"The only contradiction marked in relation to the evidence of PW-01 has been a"
"contradiction about what PW-01 has stated in his statement about a thing said"
"by the appellant to his employees when appellant interviewed them."
"Having cross  the PW-01 over and over again on the same points, an omission"
"had  been  highlighted  on  the  basis  that he  did  not  tell  in  his  complaint  to  the"
"Bribery commission that, the money was solicited in order to arrange for him not"
"to pay any money as EPF."
"However,  it  is  abundantly  clear  from  the  evidence  of  PW-01,  when  taken  as  a"
"whole, his complaint had been to the effect that the appellant demanded money"
"so that he can arrange for the EPF payments without requiring him to pay any"
"arrears  of  EPF,  and  not  to  allow  him  to  evade  paying  EPF.  The  documents"
"marked  at  the  trial  show  that  the  appellant  had  in  fact  given  the  necessary"
"application forms to the PW-01 and those applications forms had been completed"
"as required, when the arrest was made. This goes on to show that the transaction"
"had  been  not  to  allow  the  PW-01  to  avoid  paying  EPF,  but  to  help  him  avoid"
"paying any arrears of EPF."
"The only deficiency between the evidence of PW-01 and 02 had been in relation"
"to what occurred when both of them went to meet the appellant. The PW-01 has"
"failed  to mention that when they went to the office of the appellant for the first"
"time, he was not there, but they met him later on the road and came to the office"
"of the appellant when asked by him to come."
"The evidence of PW-02 has been to the effect that it was only after they went to"
"his office for the second time, the appellant spoke to them and informed that he"
"has a meeting and cannot attend to the matter."
