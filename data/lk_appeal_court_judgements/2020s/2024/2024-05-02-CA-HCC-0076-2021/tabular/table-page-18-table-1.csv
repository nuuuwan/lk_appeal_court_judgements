"It  is  my  view  that,  there  was  no  probability  of  video  recording  using  a  mobile"
"phone by the decoy, as it would lead to a suspicion been created about him by"
"the appellant, which may lead to the failure of the raid. It is hard to believe that"
"the decoy being so close to the PW-01 and the appellant, and a person whom the"
"PW-01 has  introduced as his brother-in-law,  and being a police officer,  would"
"make such a move which may jeopardize the whole operation."
"I find no basis to accept that the evidence of PW-01 in relation to the time it took"
"for the investigating officers to arrest the appellant creates an improbability of"
"the version of events as narrated by the PW-01, in view of the admission by the"
"appellant in his dock statement."
"I find no basis to accept the argument that the learned High Court Judge has"
"failed to consider the dock statement of the appellant in the correct perspective."
"I am of the view that, the dock statement has been well considered along with"
"the  evidence  led  in  this  matter  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  rightly"
"concluded that the dock statement, does not create a doubt on the evidence of"
"the prosecution."
"For the reasons considered as above, I find no basis for the second ground of"
"appeal urged either."
"It  needs  to  be  noted  that  it  is  the  same  Judge  who  heard  the  entirety  of  the"
"evidence has pronounced the judgement. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that"
"the learned trial Judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence in its entirety"
"and observing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses."
"In  the  case  of  Alwis  Vs.  Piyasena  Fernando  (1993)  1  SLR  119,  G.  P.  S.  De"
"Silva, J. (As he was then) reiterated that the Court of Appeal would not likely"
"disturb the findings of primary facts made by a trial Judge unless it is manifestly"
"wrong  as  they  have  the  priceless  advantage  of  observing  the  demeanour  of"
"witnesses which the Judges of the Court of Appeal does not have."
