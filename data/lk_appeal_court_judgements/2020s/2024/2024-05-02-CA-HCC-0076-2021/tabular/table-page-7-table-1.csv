"dressed  to  pretend  that  he  has  a  hand  injury.  Once  they  reached  the  labour"
"office, both of them had gone to meet the appellant."
"According to the evidence of PW-01, he has observed that once he saw the decoy,"
"the appellant appeared to have panicked a bit. The appellant has informed them"
"that he has a meeting at the office and to come in the afternoon."
"Around 4.00 p.m., the appellant has called PW-01 and has informed him that"
"the meeting was over and come. When he and the decoy returned  to the labour"
"office, the appellant was not available. When PW-01 called the appellant, he has"
"been informed that he should come near Pinidiya fuel station. When he reached"
"the said fuel station, PW-01 could not see the appellant. This has resulted him"
"giving another call to the appellant. While taking this call, PW-01 has observed"
"the appellant standing near a salon situated nearby, and taking a call."
"Thereafter, the PW-01 and decoy has gone near the place  where they saw the"
"appellant. When the PW-01 met with the appellant, he has acted as instructed"
"and has asked whether the amount can be reduced, for which the appellant has"
"stated that it cannot be done. The appellant  has again promised that his EPF"
"payments will be arranged without the arrears been required to be paid."
"The appellant has informed that he has to go quickly. PW-01 has then gone near"
"the decoy who was pretending to be the brother-in-law of PW-01. After taking"
"the money from the decoy, he has returned again to the place where the appellant"
"was. The appellant without taking the money to his hand has instructed to leave"
"the money between the seats of his motorbike parked nearby. The appellant  has"
"complied. At that moment, the raiding party of the Bribery Commission has come"
"and arrested the appellant."
"Under  cross-examination,  the  learned  Counsel  who  represented  the  appellant"
"has repeatedly asked questions about EPF as well as ETF payments that should"
"have been paid by the PW-01. The position of PW-01 had been that he did not"
"know that he has to pay EPF payments as well, and that was the reason why he"
"did not register himself to pay EPF."
