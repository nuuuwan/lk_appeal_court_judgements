"not come and meet as told, he could have very well told him to come and meet"
"him at his office at the next available day."
"It  clearly  appears  from  the  evidence  that,  the  appellant  being  a  government"
"servant was well aware of the repercussions he will have to face if he was caught"
"taking  a  bribe.  His  actions  clearly  show  that,  once  he  saw  a  stranger  in  the"
"company of PW-01 when he met them at his office on the date of the incident,"
"he has taken care not to accept any bribe or to utter words in relation to that,"
"but only to get out of the situation by stating that  he has a meeting to attend"
"and will call later. That may be the very reason why both the witnesses say that"
"the  appellant  was  inquisitive  about  the  stranger  and  questioned  them  in  that"
"regard."
"However,  it  appears  that  the  greed  for  money  has  overcome  him,  which  has"
"resulted in him calling the PW-01 to come and meet him at the place where the"
"arrest  was  made.  The  appellant  may  have  thought  that,  by  not  taking  money"
"directly to his hand, he will have a better way of explaining his conduct. However,"
"it  is  my  view  that  the  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  has  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt that the money recovered between the seats of the motorbike"
"belonging to the appellant was the money solicited and obtained by him  from"
"PW-01."
"Although PW-01 has stated in his evidence that he saw the decoy video recording"
"what was happening, it was not clear whether he states that in relation to what"
"happened after the arrest of the  appellant  by the bribery  officials  or when the"
"money was being placed on the motorbike as demanded by the appellant."
"However, the evidence in that regard by PW-02, the decoy, had been that he did"
"not video record the incident using his mobile phone. But he has admitted that"
"he made an attempt to take a call to the bribery officials to alert them about the"
"incident. It is quite obvious that, PW-01 may have seen this as video recording"
"of the incident."
