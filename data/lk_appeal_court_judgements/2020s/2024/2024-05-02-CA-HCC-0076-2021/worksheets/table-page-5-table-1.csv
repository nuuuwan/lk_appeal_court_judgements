"Facts in Brief"
"PW-01 has commenced a business of servicing and repairing motorcycles on 03-"
"11-2014. For that purpose, he has employed two persons to assist him in the"
"business."
"Before the incident that led to the indictment, officials from the Employees Trust"
"Fund Board (ETF) have visited his establishment and had informed him that he"
"needs  to  pay  ETF  for  his  employees.  Accordingly,  he  has  registered  himself  to"
"pay ETF and had paid an arrears amount as well. He was in the process of paying"
"ETF as required."
"On 21-03-2017, the appellant to whom PW-01 refers to as ‘Lal Sir’ has visited"
"his  establishment  and  has  informed  that  he  is  from  the  labour  office.  The"
"appellant has inquired whether he is contributing to Employees Provident Fund"
"(EPF) for his employees, and the appellant has answered in the negative."
"After inquiring into the matter, the appellant has informed PW-01 that he will"
"have to pay an arrears of nearly Rs. 150,000/- as EPF payment. The PW-01 has"
"informed that he was unaware that he has to pay EPF as well, and that he has"
"already paid an arrears amount as ETF."
"Thereafter,  the  appellant  had  instructed  him  to  come  to  the  Matara  District"
"Labour  Office  on  the  same  day  with  the  relevant  documents  relating  to  his"
"employees. The appellant has given his phone number to PW-01 as well."
"After  getting  the  necessary  documents  ready,  PW-01  has  given  a  call  to  the"
"appellant and he has informed the PW-01 to come. When PW-01 reached Matara"
"District Labour Office, the appellant was not there, which has resulted in PW-01"
"giving a call to the appellant. The appellant has instructed PW-01 to come near"
"Thudawa, Pinidiya fuel station."
