"He  has  inquired  about  the  injured  hand  of  the  PW-01  and  has  also  inquired"
"about the decoy to which  PW-01 has replied that he is his brother-in-law, and"
"because of the injury, he cannot ride the motorbike and that is the reason he"
"came  along  with  him.  After  coming  out  of  the  labour  office  with  them,  the"
"appellant  has  informed  that  he  has  a  meeting  and  cannot  attend  to  PW-01’s"
"matter now, and  will call him in the afternoon."
"As a result, both of them have returned to the establishment of PW-01 and while"
"waiting there, PW-01 has received a call at  around 4.00 p.m. where he has been"
"informed  to  come  to  the  appellant’s  office.  The  decoy  has  corroborated  the"
"evidence  of  PW-01  as  to  what  happened  thereafter,  and  the  arrest  of  the"
"appellant by the Bribery Department officials."
"When PW-01 was giving evidence, he has stated that after the bribe money was"
"handed over, he saw the decoy taking a call and video recording of the incident."
"However, the stand in that regard by the decoy was that he or his team did not"
"take any video recording equipment for the raid and he did not record what was"
"happening using his mobile phone."
"At the trial, the two employees of PW-01 have also given evidence corroborating"
"that  the  appellant  came  and  inquired  from  them  about  their  salary  and  other"
"information."
"The officer who conducted the investigation and the raid, namely, PW-03 have"
"given evidence providing details of the complaint received by the Commission,"
"the raid conducted, and the investigations carried out in this regard."
"The call record details of the mobile phones of PW-01 and that of the appellant"
"had  been  admitted  in  terms  of  section  420  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure"
"Act."
"At  the  conclusion  of  the  prosecution  case  and  when  the  appellant  was  called"
"upon for his defence, he has decided to make a statement from the dock."
