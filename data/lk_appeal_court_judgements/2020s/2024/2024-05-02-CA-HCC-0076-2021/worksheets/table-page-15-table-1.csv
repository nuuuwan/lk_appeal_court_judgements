"The next ground of appeal urged by the learned President’s Counsel was to the"
"effect  that,  there  was  no  evidence  to  establish  the  case  against  the  appellant"
"beyond  reasonable  doubt,  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  misdirected"
"when it was determined so."
"It was the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that, he concedes that"
"no corroboration is necessary at all the time to prove a fact, but it was contended"
"that the evidence of PW-01 was contradictory, and therefore, his evidence should"
"not have been relied on by the learned High Court  Judge."
"However,  as  I  have  considered  before,  I  do  not  find  a  basis  to  consider  the"
"evidence of PW-01 as unreliable, therefore not trustworthy."
"It was the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that since the money"
"was  not  found  in  the  possession  of  the  appellant,  given  the  facts  and  the"
"circumstances, the incident could well be a setup against the appellant and that"
"fact should have been considered in favor of him. It was submitted that  where"
"any doubt arises in that relation, it should have been considered, and the benefit"
"of the doubt should have gone in favor of the appellant."
"In considering whether this could have been a set up against the appellant, the"
"evidence led by the prosecution and the defence taken up by the appellant needs"
"to be considered as a whole and not in isolation."
"The  appellant  has  admitted  almost  all  of  the  facts  narrated  by  PW-01  in  this"
"regard and also the telephone conversations he had with him, and most of the"
"matters occurred on the day of the incident. But what he has denied was that,"
"he solicited a bribe or he told the PW-01 to place the money between the seats"
"of his motorbike."
"It is an admitted fact that the money was recovered by the officials of the Bribery"
"Commission between the seats of the motorbike."
