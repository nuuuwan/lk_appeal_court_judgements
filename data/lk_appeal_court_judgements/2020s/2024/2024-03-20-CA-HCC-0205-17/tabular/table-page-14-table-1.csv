"(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge"
"with  regard  to  the  acceptance  or  rejection  of  testimony  of  a  witness"
"unless it is manifestly wrong."
"In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:"
"“While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether"
"the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth."
"Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to"
"scrutinize the evidence more  particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,"
"drawbacks  and  infirmities  pointed  out  in  the  evidence  as  a  whole  and"
"evaluate  them  to  find  out  whether  it  is  against  the  general  tenor  of  the"
"evidence  given  by  the  witness  and  whether  the  earlier  evaluation  of  the"
"evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies"
"on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach"
"by  taking  sentences  torn  out  of  context  here  or  there  from  the  evidence,"
"attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating"
"officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection"
"of the evidence as a whole.”"
"For the reasons as considered, I find no basis in the first ground of appeal urged"
"by the learned Counsel for the appellant."
"The 2nd Ground of Appeal:-"
"The argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the chain of custody"
"of productions has not been proved to the satisfaction of the trial Court had been"
"based  on  the  questions  and  answers  given  by  PW-01,  while  under  cross-"
"examination (at page 207 of the appeal brief), and on what was stated by PW-02"
"when he gave evidence in that regard (at page 354 of the appeal brief)."
"For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant portions of evidence."
