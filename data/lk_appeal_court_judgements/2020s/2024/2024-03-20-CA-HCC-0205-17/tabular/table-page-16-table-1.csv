"of PW-02 had been that after checking the substance, it was taken charge by the"
"PW-01. He has stated that he had not made notes as to whether PW-01 kept the"
"productions in his trouser pocket or on is hand. He has stated that he cannot"
"remember whether the substance was put inside the purse or not."
"I find that this is not a basis to consider that there was a break in the chain of"
"custody of the productions. As I have stated before, the productions had been in"
"the custody of PW-01 until they were handed over to the police reserve. Hence, I"
"find no basis to the considered ground of appeal."
"The 3rd Ground of Appeal:-"
"In  the  3rd  ground  of  appeal,  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant  was  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the"
"defence taken up by the appellant in its correct perspective and had considered"
"irrelevant considerations to reject the dock statement of the appellant."
"It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge has"
"well considered the defence taken up by the appellant. After having considered"
"the evidence of the prosecution, the defence taken up by the appellant when the"
"witnesses were giving evidence, and the evidence of the appellant in her defence,"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  come  to  a  conclusion  that  there  is  no"
"possibility  for  the  prosecution  witnesses  to  concoct  a  story  in  this  manner"
"against the appellant."
"He has found that the defence taken up by the appellant has not created a doubt"
"as to the evidence of the prosecution, and has determined that the defence was"
"not consistent, rejecting the defence taken up by the appellant."
"In  a  criminal  case,  the  onus  is  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  its  case  beyond"
"reasonable doubt against an accused. An accused person has no obligation in"
"that regard."
