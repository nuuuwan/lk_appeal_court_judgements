"“A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider"
"all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by"
"the  defence  in  its  totality  without  compartmentalizing  and,  ask  himself"
"whether  a  prudent  man,  in  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  case,  he"
"believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.”"
