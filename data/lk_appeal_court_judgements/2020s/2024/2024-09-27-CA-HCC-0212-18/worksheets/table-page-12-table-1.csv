"case  was  cited  with  approval  in  the  case  of  Boby  Mathew  Vs  State  of"
"Karnataka 2004 3 Cri. L. J.3003"
"Another matter that needs consideration in relation to the evidence is whether"
"there was any possibility for the investigating officers to introduce blood onto the"
"sarong after its discovery. According to the evidence led in this action, the post-"
"mortem of the deceased had been concluded on the 10th and the body has been"
"released  to  the  deceased’s  relatives.  PW-13  has  taken  a  blood  sample  of  the"
"deceased at the time where the post-mortem was held, which has been produced"
"at the police station under PR No. 187/15 on the same day. The arrest of the"
"appellant and the recovery of the sarong as a production has been on the 12th,"
"which shows that the funeral of the deceased as well as the post-mortem had"
"been over by that time, and there would have been no possibility of introducing"
"blood to the sarong recovered."
"I am unable to agree with the contention that there is a credibility issue as to"
"the evidence of PW-03, namely Wasantha Gunathilake. I am of the view that his"
"evidence has to be considered in conjunction with that of PW-02, the daughter"
"of the deceased. The deceased, his family members and the appellant are persons"
"well known to PW-03 and persons who had frequented his boutique, which was"
"situated near the house of the deceased. According to his evidence, the deceased"
"has told him while they were having liquor in the evening, that he is going to visit"
"Manike’s place. The mentioned Manike is the female who lived with the appellant"
"as husband and wife, although they were not legally married. The said Manike"
"is also a relative of the deceased as the deceased’s sister is married to Manike’s"
"brother. When the daughter of the deceased came and inquired about her father"
"on the following day, he has informed her of that fact."
"The evidence of the daughter had been to the effect that  she was informed by"
"PW-03 that her father informed him that Wimalasena (the appellant) invited him"
"to have some liquor and he may have gone there."
