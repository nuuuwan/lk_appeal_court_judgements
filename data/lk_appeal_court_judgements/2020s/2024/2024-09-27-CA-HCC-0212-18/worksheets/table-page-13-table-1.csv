"The evidence of PW-02 and 03 when taken in its totality shows what both of them"
"were  telling  nothing  but  the  truth.  The  PW-03  may  have  forgotten  the  exact"
"details  of  what  he  told  the  daughter  of  the  deceased,  but  it  is  clear  from  the"
"evidence of both the witnesses that the daughter has come to know of the fact of"
"her father going to meet the appellant to his house because Manike mentioned"
"by PW-03 is the person with whom the appellant had been living at that time."
"For the reasons considered as above, I find no merit in the 1st and the 3rd ground"
"of appeal urged."
"The 2nd Ground of Appeal"
"It was contended that the prosecution has failed to prove the chain of custody of"
"the productions based on certain omissions by the police reserve officers, who"
"held the custody of PR No. 187/2015 before it was handed over to the Court for"
"the purpose of obtaining a Government Analyst Report."
"It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  led  before  the  Court  that  several  reserve  police"
"officers have had the custody of the productions relating to this case after they"
"were handed over to the police reserve on 10-08-2015 and on 12-08-2015. It is"
"clear that when the productions were handed over from one officer to another,"
"in some instances, the production numbers have not been recorded properly or"
"not recorded as required."
"However,  what  is  clear  without  a  doubt  is  that  the  said  production  has  never"
"been taken out of the production room of the police station until it was taken to"
"the Magistrateâ€™s Court. There is nothing to show that the said production has"
"been tampered with when it has been taken to the Government Analyst or when"
"opened by the Government Analyst for the purposes of analysis."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge in her judgment has well considered"
"whether there was any possibility of tampering with the productions which were"
"under the police custody and has considered the evidence in that regard to come"
