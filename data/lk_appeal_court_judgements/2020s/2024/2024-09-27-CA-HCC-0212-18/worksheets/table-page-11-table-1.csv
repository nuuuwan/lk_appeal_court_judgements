"According to the evidence of PW-09, the appellant has been arrested on 12-08-"
"2015 at 17.00 hours. The appellant does not deny that the OIC recovered a knife"
"from his house, and a sarong and a baniyan from a clothesline near a water tap"
"of his house. The only difference being his claim that the knife was taken from"
"his wife and the things recovered from the clothesline had no blood on them, and"
"the  denial  that  the  clothes  were  recovered  while  being  hidden  under  a  flower"
"fence."
"It needs to be noted that when PW-09, the OIC who conducted the investigations"
"was  subjected  to  cross-examination  on  behalf  of  the  defence,  contradictory"
"positions had been taken in relation to the discovery of the productions. It has"
"been suggested to him that the sarong and the baniyan were recovered from a"
"basin near the water tap (page 187 of the appeal brief). Again, at page 201 of the"
"appeal brief, it has been suggested to the witness that the brown-coloured sarong"
"and the baniyan were taken by him from a clothesline near the water tap. In the"
"dock statement, the appellant has taken up the position that the OIC instructed"
"another police officer to apply a little from the bottle and prepare it to be taken"
"to the Government Analyst, which is suggestive of attempting to apply the blood"
"of the deceased on the sarong recovered to implicate the appellant."
"However, the best person to answer such an allegation would have been the PW-"
"09, against whom the allegation was made. It appears that no such suggestion"
"had been made to him when he was giving evidence, which shows that the said"
"allegation was an afterthought in order to counter the evidence in that regard,"
"and that of the Government Analyst who has found DNA evidence matching the"
"blood of the deceased to the blood found on the sarong."
