"stated  that  he  was  admitted  to  Buttala  Hospital  on  07-08-2015  and  was"
"transferred to Sirigala Hospital. While receiving treatment at Sirigala Hospital,"
"the  OIC  of  Gonaganaara  police,  namely  Nandana  Samansiri,  has  visited  the"
"hospital on 10-08-2015. After informing that he needs to take a statement from"
"him,  he  has  been  taken  out  of  the  hospital,  and  put  into  a  three-wheeler."
"Thereafter, he has been taken to an abandoned quarry, assaulted and put into"
"a police jeep and taken inside Yala National Park and assaulted further. He has"
"claimed  that  on  13-08-2015,  he  was  forced  to  sign  some  documents  and  was"
"produced before the Wellawaya Magistrate."
"In  relation  to  the  items  that  had  been  recovered  by  the  police  based  on  his"
"statement, it had been his position that the police took the knife from his wife"
"and  the  two  sarongs  were  taken  from  a  clothesline  near  his  house,  and  has"
"claimed that there were no blood marks on the sarong, and he heard the OIC"
"telling the other officer to apply blood on the sarong. He has also claimed that"
"the  two  sarongs  were  washed  and  kept  on  the  clothesline  because  he  was"
"suffering from diarrhoea before he was admitted to the hospital. It had been his"
"position that the OIC of the police station implicated him to an offence which he"
"did not commit."
"On behalf of the defence, the OIC of Gonaganaara police has been summoned to"
"give evidence. He was not the OIC of the police station at the time relevant to this"
"incident. It appears from his evidence that he has been mainly questioned about"
"the  item  of  production  received  by  the  police  station  under  PR  No.  187/2015"
"along  with  other  productions  relating  to  this  case.  The  line  of  examination"
"appears  to  be  to  show  that  the  production  officers,  who  held  the  relevant"
"productions under police custody until it was handed over to the  Magistrateâ€™s"
"Court, have failed to mention the said productions  on several occasions when"
"production custody was handed over from one officer to another. The production"
"produced under PR No. 187/2015 had been the blood sample taken by the police"
"from  the  deceased  person,  which  was  the  sample  that  has  been  used  by  the"
"Government Analyst for DNA comparison."
