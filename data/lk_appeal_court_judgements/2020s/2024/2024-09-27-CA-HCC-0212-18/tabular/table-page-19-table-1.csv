"to  the  deceased.  As  I  have  considered  previously,  there  would  have  been  no"
"possibility  of 
introducing  blood  to  the  sarong  admittedly  belonging  to  the"
"appellant."
"There was no doubt that the knife marked P-06 belongs to the appellant, which"
"has also been recovered from his house."
"Although  the  appellant  has  attempted  to  show  that  he  was  illegally  arrested,"
"severely tortured, and  his signature was taken forcibly, I find no basis to agree"
"with such a contention in view of the cogent evidence led at this trial in relation"
"to the circumstances under which the appellant had been arrested."
"Under  the  circumstances, 
I 
find  that  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"considered  the  circumstantial  evidence  against  the  appellant  in  its  correct"
"perspective and has come to a correct conclusion in that regard."
"Apart  from  the  circumstantial  evidence  considered  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge, I find that the evidence led before the trial Court also provides a motive"
"for  the  crime,  although  motive  is  not  a  thing  that  should  be  established  in  a"
"criminal case."
"According to the evidence of PW-06, the brother of the mentioned Manike, whose"
"real name is Baby Nona, the appellant has suspected the deceased for having an"
"illicit  relationship  with  her.  Although  the  appellant  and  Baby  Nona  were  not"
"legally married, they had been living together as husband and wife for some time"
"before this incident occurred."
"The brother of Baby Nona has also come to know that there had been an incident"
"over  the  deceased  coming  to  the  appellantâ€™s  house  previously  to  collect  empty"
"bottles, which had been his trade where he collected empty bottles from various"
"houses in order to sell them to a collector in the town."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned High Court"
"Judge has correctly considered the circumstantial evidence and had come to a"
"correct  determination 
that 
the  prosecution  has  proved 
the  case  beyond"
