"conviction."
"The Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal"
"Although  several  separate  grounds  of  appeal  were  urged  on  behalf  of  the  two"
"appellants, since both the Counsel raised a ground of appeal on the basis that"
"the learned High Court Judge had failed to consider whether there was evidence"
"to  convict  the  appellants  on  the  basis  of  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to"
"murder,  I  will  now  proceed  to  consider  the  said  ground  of  appeal,  before"
"considering the other grounds of appeal, if necessary."
"I am of the view that if it can be determined that the conviction should have been"
"on the  above-mentioned basis, considering the other grounds of appeal would"
"not be necessary."
"I find that this is a case where most of the facts relating to the reason behind"
"this incident have been admitted by the prosecution witnesses,  as well as the"
"appellants.  It  is  clear  that  the  father  of  the  deceased  had  been  engaged  in"
"providing foreign employment to others and he has failed to secure employment"
"as promised, although he has taken money from the appellants, as well as others"
"in that regard. It is clear that the  appellants have  been frequently  visiting the"
"house with the others claiming to return the money paid by them to the father"
"of deceased. The fact that the two appellants along with two others visited the"
"house on the day of the incident in order to demand the money from the father"
"of the deceased (husband of PW-02) was also not a disputed fact. The fact that"
"when they came to the house, the deceased and some others were playing carom"
"in  front  of  the  house  and  two  other  neighboring  women  enjoying  some  cakes"
"inside the house, were also not disputed."
