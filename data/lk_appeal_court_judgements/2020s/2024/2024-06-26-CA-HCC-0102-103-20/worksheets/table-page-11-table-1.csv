"Although it was contended on behalf of the 1st appellant that the part played by"
"him in the incident does not establish the common intention, I am in no position"
"to agree."
"The relevant section 32 of the Penal Code reads as follows."
"32. When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of"
"common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in"
"the same manner as if it were done by him alone."
"The  evidence  placed  before  the  trial  Court  clearly  establishes  the  fact  that"
"although  the  1st  appellant  may  not  have  inflicted  the  stab  wound  on  the"
"deceased, he was a part of the group that assaulted the deceased. Therefore, it"
"is  clear  that  the  1st  appellant  has  also  acted  in  furtherance  of  the  common"
"intention which resulted in the death of the deceased."
"For the reasons as considered above, I find that considering the other grounds"
"of appeal would not be necessary, since the appeal can succeed in the considered"
"ground of appeal alone."
"Hence,  I  set  aside  the  judgment  dated  04-09-2020  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge of Kuliyapitiya, where the appellants were found guilty for the offence of"
"murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of the  Penal Code as it cannot be"
"allowed to stand."
"Based on the aforementioned reasons, I convict the appellants in terms of section"
"297  of  the  Penal  Code  for  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder  under"
"exception 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code."
"Having  considered  the  facts  and  the  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"punishment for the offence now they stand convicted  should be in terms of the"
"2nd limb of section 297 of the Penal Code."
"Accordingly, I sentence the two appellants for a period of 10 years each rigorous"
"imprisonment, and to a fine of Rs. 25,000/- each."
