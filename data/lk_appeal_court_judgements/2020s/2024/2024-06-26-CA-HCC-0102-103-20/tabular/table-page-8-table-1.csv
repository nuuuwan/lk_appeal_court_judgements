"When  informed  that  the  husband  of  PW-02  was  not  home,  the  fact  that  the"
"appellants and others who came had entered the house and searched it was also"
"undisputed."
"Although how the incident of assault started differs from the version of PW-02"
"and that of the appellants, it is certain that it has started as a result of the issues"
"the appellants had with the husband of PW-02."
"According to the version of PW-02, she had been assaulted by another person"
"who was with the appellants, and her son got involved because of that. According"
"to  the  appellants,  when  they  were  looking  for  the  father  of  the  deceased,  the"
"deceased has told them if they have any issues with the father, to settle it with"
"him, which resulted in the brawl including them, the deceased, and the PW-02."
"Although  the  appellants  have  not  directly  admitted  causing  injuries  to  the"
"deceased, the dock statement of the 1st appellant clearly shows that the deceased"
"had been injured as a result of the brawl they had with him."
"The  evidence  led  before  the  Court  clearly  establishes  the  fact  that  when  the"
"appellants  and  two  others  came  to  the  house  of  the  deceased,  they  had  no"
"intention of harming the deceased under any circumstances. It is therefore clear"
"that the incident where the deceased received a fatal injury has sparked off as a"
"sudden fight due to the appellants being deprived of their self-control as a result"
"of the grave provocation that resulted, although the deceased was not the person"
"who may have caused the initial provocation."
"However,  it  is  clear  that  this  incident  has  resulted  because  of  the  cumulative"
"provocation the appellants may have developed due to the actions of the father"
"of the deceased.  Although PW-02 has claimed in her evidence that the deceased"
"was repeatedly stabbed by the 2nd appellant, in fact, he has received only one"
"injury, which shows that it was a sudden fight and not an intentional attack on"
"the deceased."
