"In prayer (d) the Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing MEPA and CEA"
"to investigate the alleged incident of disposal of toxic wastewater sludge to the sea and"
"other places in violation of the provisions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act and"
"National  Environment  Act  and  regulations  thereto  and  take  necessary  legal  action"
"against all the parties involved. When considering the above-stated facts, this Court can"
"be satisfied that the MEPA and the CEA had taken necessary steps to bring forthwith"
"the  perpetrators  of  the  alleged  incident  before  the  court  of  law  and  deal  with  them"
"according to the provisions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act and the National"
"Environment Act. Under such circumstances, this Court sees no merit in the argument"
"of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that MEPA and CEA had failed to"
"take steps in respect of the alleged incident and therefore, this Court refuse to grant the"
"relief prayed for in prayer (d) to the Petition of this Application. Furthermore, according"
"to the extracts marked as 5R1 to 5R7 produced by the 1st to 5th Respondents regarding"
"the statements recorded of the witnesses and the suspects and the investigations carried"
"out by the Police, this Court cannot agree with the contention of the learned Counsel"
"appearing for the Petitioners that the 4th and 5th Respondents had failed to perform their"
"duty.  In  prayer  (b)  to  the  Petition,  the  Petitioners  are  seeking  a  Writ  of  Mandamus"
"directing the 8th Respondent to indict the perpetrators before the High Court under the"
"Marine Pollution Prevention Act and in prayer (c), a Writ of Mandamus directing the"
"4th and the 5th Respondent to conduct an independent investigation into the said matter"
"and  apprehend  all  parties  involved.  Upon  considering  all  the  above-stated  facts  and"
"circumstances, I am of the view that a necessity does not arise to grant reliefs prayed"
"for in prayers (b) and (c) in the Petition to this Application and therefore refuse to grant"
"those reliefs."
