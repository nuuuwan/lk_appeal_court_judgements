"the productions to the police. She has testified that she was a witness for all the"
"procedural steps as well. At the trial, she has identified the productions and has"
"also identified the appellant as the female she searched and recovered the parcel"
"of Heroin."
"Under  cross-examination,  the  witness  has  admitted  that  she  has  not  made"
"detailed notes about the routes she and her team took on that day, before coming"
"near the lane where the raid  took place, but  has taken up the stand that  it is"
"usually the officer who leads the team who takes such notes."
"The defence has made the same suggestion to the witness as well, denying that"
"the appellant had  any  Heroin. The  witness  has  stated  that  the appellant  was"
"arrested because Heroin was detected from her possession."
"The Government Analyst who has given evidence as  PW-15 has confirmed that"
"the  Government  Analyst  received  the  sealed  parcel  containing  a  substance"
"suspected to be Heroin on 03-02-2014 and she did the analysis on 21-02-2014."
"When weighing the gross quantity of the contents, it has shown a weight of 14.73"
"grams which was  different to the gross  weight stated by PW-01, who  says that"
"when he  got  the contents  weighed at  Dedigama Pawning  Center, it  showed  a"
"weight of  15.1  grams.  However,  the Government Analyst has  clearly explained"
"the probable reasons  for such  a  small weight difference that  can  occur  due to"
"various  factors,  but has stated that since the Government Analyst weighed the"
"productions under strict laboratory conditions, the accurate  weight can vary  in"
"this manner. After analysis, the Government Analyst has  found 4.73 grams  of"
"pure  Heroin in  the  parcel  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department. The"
"Government Analyst has  identified the productions  sent to  the Department at"
"the trial confirming that it was  she who analyzed the contents."
"At the trial, the accused had admitted the chain of custody of productions from"
"the  time  of  detection,  and  accordingly,  that  fact  has  been  recorded  as  an"
"admission in terms of section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
