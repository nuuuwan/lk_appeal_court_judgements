"the appellant was  inside the house when the police team arrived  at her house."
"Therefore,  based  on  that  admission,  as  viewed  correctly  by  the  learned High"
"Court Judge, any minor discrepancy as to where the police team travelled during"
"the day would have no impact whatsoever in the evidence of PW-01 and 09."
"It was  contended that the piece of evidence in relation to the way  the appellant"
"has come and attempted to  turn back  was  not probable. It was  claimed that if"
"that was the case, she should have either attempted to run away or throw away"
"whatever she was carrying."
"However, the clear evidence of PW-01 as well as that of PW-09 in that regard had"
"been that they saw the appellant at a very close range coming out of her house,"
"walking a few feet towards them and turning back after seeing them. PW-01 says"
"that there was  no room for  the appellant to run away  or throw  away what  she"
"was carrying due to the close proximity of the appellant to PW-01 and his team,"
"and they were able to apprehend her within few seconds of their suspicions being"
"raised. Under the circumstances, it is my considered view  that unlike in a case"
"where there was some distance between the raiding party and the suspect when"
"a  suspect  sees  the raiding party,  a  person who  meets a  police  team  at  a  very"
"close range cannot be expected to have the ability to run away or throw whatever"
"he or she was carrying which can be easily observed by the police party or raise"
"their suspicions to a higher level."
"Therefore,  I  am  unable  to  agree  the  earlier  considered  piece  of  evidence  as"
"improbable.  The  learned  Counsel  raised  the  question  whether  a  police  party"
"would  leave  a  9-year-old  child  at  home,  virtually  abandoning  her  without  a"
"guardian as stated by PW-01. However, the evidence is that when they arrested"
"the appellant, there was a girl child who was about 9 years of age at the house."
"Nowhere  in  the  evidence  or  in  the  dock  statement  of  the  appellant,  she  has"
"claimed that the child was  left abandoned by the police after her arrest,  which"
"means that the child has been taken care by someone else after the raid."
