"The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, in its Practice"
"Guidelines under subheading “Parents” states:"
"“In  general,  parents  (or  other  relatives  and  caregivers)  should  not  be"
"present  during  the  interview.  If  a  child  refuses  to  separate,  it  may  be"
"appropriate to allow the caregiver to be present during the initial stages"
"of the interview. The caregiver should be instructed not to influence the"
"child  in  any  way.  If  possible,  he  or  she  should  leave  the  room  prior  to"
"issues of abuse being raised.”"
