"CA/HCC/134/22"
"In his first ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial"
"Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  fact  that  the  child  victim  was  tutored  by"
"PW1, the mother of the child during the video recording and in the second"
"ground the contention of the Appellant is that he was denied a fair trial by"
"presenting  incorrect  transcript  of  the  interview  conducted  by  the  Child"
"Protection Authority."
"In this case, the evidence surfaced during the trial was that the matrimonial"
"relationship  had  been  strained  between  PW1 
(wife)  and  the  Appellant"
"(husband).  The  victim  was  in  the  exclusive  care  of  PW1  when  his  video"
"evidence was recorded. Therefore, risk of undue influence which could badly"
"reflect on the Appellant should be excluded before accepting video evidence."
"In a case of this nature, it is the profound duty of the prosecution to present"
"the original recorded conversation along with an accurate transcript. The use"
"of  a  transcript  raises  critical  issues  of  authentication,  admissibility,  and"
"presentation  during  the  trial.  The  transcript  must  faithfully  reflect  the"
"recording and should not be a blend of the recording and hearsay testimony"
"from those present during the conversation. If inaccuracies in the transcript"
"are compounded by potential bias in the transcription process, the transcript"
"may  be  excluded  from  evidence.  The  crucial  standard  is  the  transcript's"
"accuracy,  as  it  is  essential  for  assisting  all  parties  involved  in  the  trial  in"
"comprehending the content of the recording."
"When this case came up for argument before this Court, the Learned Counsel"
"for  the  Appellant 
informed  this  Court  that  he  had  the  opportunity  of"
"observing the video recording of the evidence of the child which was relied"
"on  by  the  prosecution  as  the  evidence  in  chief  and  the  transcript  of  the"
"evidence  produced  before  the  Court  was  very  much  different  to  the  video"
"recorded evidence of the child and the Learned Counsel requested the Court"
"to play the video when this matter was taken up for argument."
