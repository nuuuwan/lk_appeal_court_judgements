"CA/HCC/134/22"
"In this case, as per the transcript submitted by the Appellant marked as “Z”,"
"it  is  manifestly  clear  that  PW1  who  was present  with  the  child  victim  had"
"intervened and induced the victim to say against the Appellant. This clearly"
"reflects  the  mala  fide  intention  to  fix  the  Appellant  to  the  crime.  As  his"
"Lordship  Abayakoon.  J, 
in  the  above  cited 
judgment  stated  the  video"
"recording evidence can be safely accepted if the interviewer did not intend to"
"fix anybody."
"Also,  above  mentioned  APSAC  Practice  Guidelines 
lays  down  that  the"
"caregiver should be instructed not to influence the child in any way during"
"the interview."
"In this case, the original video recording transcript submitted by the Counsel"
"for  the  Appellant  with  the  leave  of  the  Court  is  quite  different  from  the"
"transcript relied upon the prosecution as the evidence in chief of the victim."
"The  transcript  submitted  by  the  Appellant  clearly  shows  instances  where"
"PW1, mother of the Appellant prompts the child victim to say certain things"
"against  the  Appellant,  whereas,  the  child  victim  himself  does  not  mention"
"anything about the Appellant’s involvement in such acts."
"PW1,  the  mother  of  the  victim  child  admitted  in  her  evidence  that  several"
"complaints  had  been 
lodged  against  the  Appellant  regarding  domestic"
"violence existed between them. A restraining order against the Appellant had"
"been issued by the Learned Magistrate of Mahara. Therefore, it appears that"
"PW1 had a strong motive to fabricate a case against the Appellant through"
"the  victim.  Hence,  I  conclude  that  accepting  and  considering  the  video"
"recording evidence of PW7 against the Appellant had caused great prejudice"
"which certainly vitiates the outcome of the case."
"As the 3rd and 4th grounds are also connected to each other, the said grounds"
"will be considered together hereinafter."
"In the 3rd ground of appeal, the Appellant contended that he was denied a"
"fair  trial  by  convicting  him  by  using  and  perusing  the  Police  Information"
