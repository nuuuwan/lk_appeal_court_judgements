"the  patent  lack  of  jurisdiction  and  latent  lack  of  jurisdiction  and  the  effect  of",""
"such a situation in the following manner.",""
"“Lack  of  competency 
in  a  Court 
is  a  circumstance","that  results 
in  a"
"","judgment or order that is void. Lack of competency may arise in one of two"
"","ways.  A  Court  may  lack  jurisdiction  over  the  cause  of  matter  or  over  the"
"","parties; it may also lack competence because of failure to comply with such"
"","procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by the"
"Court.  Both  are 
jurisdictional  defects; 
the","first  mentioned  of 
these 
is"
"","commonly known in  the law  as ‘patent’ or ‘total’  want of jurisdiction or  a"
"","defectus  jurisdictionis    and  the  second  a  ‘latent’  or  ‘contingent’  want  of"
"","jurisdiction  or  a  defectus  triationis.  Both  classes  of  jurisdictional  result  in"
"","judgments  or  orders,  which  are  void.  However,  an  important  difference"
"","must also be noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is"
"patent,  no  waiver  of  objection  or  acquiescence  can  cure","the  want  of"
"","jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their conduct"
"","to  confer    jurisdiction  on  a  tribunal  which  has  none  would  be  to  admit  a"
"","power in the parties to the litigation to create new jurisdictions or to extend"
"a 
jurisdiction  beyond 
its  existing","limits,  both  of  which  are  within  the"
"","exclusive  privilege  of  the  legislature;  the  proceeding  in  cases  within  this"
"","category  are non coram judice  and  the want of jurisdiction is incurable."
