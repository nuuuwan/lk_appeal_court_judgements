"In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365 it"
"was observed,"
"“Revisionary  powers  should  be  exercised  where  a  miscarriage  of  justice"
"has occasioned due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but"
"only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage"
"of justice.”"
"For  the  reasons  considered  as  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  this  is  a  situation"
"where a clear positive miscarriage of justice has occasioned, where exceptional"
"circumstances  exist  warranting  the  intervention  of  this  Court  to  correct  the"
"said positive miscarriage of justice."
"Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 12-09-2022 marked P-04 and the order"
"dated P-05 of even date, but filed as a part of the case on 22-09-2022, as both"
"those orders cannot be allowed to  stand."
"I  direct  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  shall  proceed  to  hear  this  action"
"commencing from where it stood before this order was pronounced, after taking"
"due procedural steps in that regard."
"The  Registrar  of  the  Court  is  directed  to  communicate  this  order  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo for necessary compliance."
"Judge of the Court of Appeal"
"P. Kumararatnam, J."
"I agree."
