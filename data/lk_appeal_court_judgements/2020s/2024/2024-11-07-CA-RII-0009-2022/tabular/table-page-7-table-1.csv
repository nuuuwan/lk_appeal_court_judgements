"complied  with,  but  there  is  nothing  in  the  record  to  show  at  whose"
"instance the settlement was arrived at."
"I
n the case of Goonawardena vs. Ran Menike and others [2002] 3Sri LR 243,"
"it was held; “that where there has been a settlement or compromise, it must in"
"strict  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  sections  91  and  408  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code.”"
"T
he impugned settlement  did  not conform with the provisions of section 91"
"and section 408 of the Civil Procedure  Code.   The  court was not notified of"
"the impugned settlement by motion. Section 91 of the Civil Procedure Code"
"makes it imperative that “a memorandum in writing of such motion shall be at"
"the same time delivered to the Court.”"
"S
ection 91 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:”"
"91.  Every  application  made  to  the  court  in  the  course  of  an  action,"
"incidental thereto, and not a step in the regular procedure shall be made"
"by  motion  by 
the  applicant 
in  person  or  his  counsel  or  registered"
"attorney,  and  a  memorandum  in  writing of such  motion shall be  at  the"
"same time delivered to the court."
"T
he  impugned  terms  of  the settlement  were  not  informed  to  the  Court  in"
"writing.  As  the  case  record  indicates,  there  was  no  time  for  the  parties  to"
"deliberate  about  the  terms  of  the  settlement.  There  is  no  indication  in  the"
"record 
at  whose 
instance 
the 
settlement  was 
arrived 
this 
at.  By"
"the  rights  of 
the 
settlement, the  petitioner  did  not  gain  anything,  and"
"petitioner were gravely prejudiced. Parties to this case had not complied with"
"the imperative requirements of section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code, and"
"therefore, the settlement can be set aside on that ground alone."
"The argument that motion need not be in writing is not correct.  The terms of"
"settlement lack precision, lack mutual agreement, and are not in conformity"
"with  the  provisions  of  section  91  and  section  408  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code. In the above circumstances, the purported terms of settlement are not"
"valid  in  law.  As  such,  the  terms  of  settlement  dated  26-01-2017  are  set"
"aside."
