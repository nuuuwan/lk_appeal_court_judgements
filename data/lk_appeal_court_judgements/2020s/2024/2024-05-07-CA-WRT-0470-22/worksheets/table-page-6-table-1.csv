"grace on the part of the Court. The fact that the loan was obtained and the Petitioner is"
"in default is undisputed. By this application, filed more than five years ago, the Petitioner"
"has prevented the Bank from recovering its dues through parate execution-a quicker and"
"faster procedure recognised by the law. Banks are not charitable institutions; they are the"
"cornerstones  of  economies. It should  be  understood  that similar  to the  Petitioner  being"
"engaged in a business, granting loans with the expectation of timely repayment is a major"
"part of the ordinary course of business of a Bank. If a Bank is prevented from taking such"
"measures as it is entitled in law to take to protect its interests, the economy of the country"
"would  suffer.  The  Recovery  of  Loans  by  Banks  (Special  Provisions)  Act  was  passed  to"
"assist Banks to fast-track the procedure of debt recovery. There is no place for high-flown"
"technical objections under this Act.”"
"Amaradasa  Liyanage  v.  Sampath  Bank  PLC,  SC  Appeal  No:126/2012,  Decided  on"
"04.04.2014, Tilakawardane,J held that;"
"“The ambit and purpose of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act is, in essence, to recover"
"monies  due  to  the  Bank  while  ensuring  that  the  Bank  does  not  enjoy  an  unjust"
"enrichment. The provisions of the Act, by allowing parate execution, is to facilitate the"
"process of collecting monies due, without lengthy court proceedings, and to do so in a fair"
"and  reasonable  manner.  This  objective  should  therefore  not  be  hindered  by  minor"
"procedural irregularities such as the absence of the signatures of all Board members on"
"the  Certificate  of  Sale,  for  such  minor  irregularities  cannot  have  much  impact  on  the"
"rights of the borrower."
"Minor procedural irregularities cannot, further, be grounds upon which actions may be"
"instituted for such actions would only amount to the abuse of the process of Court which"
"must not be allowed. In the present case, monies due remained unpaid for a total of four"
"years prior to the auction taking place and to challenge the sale of property on the basis"
"of a minor irregularity in documentation will undoubtedly remain unsuccessful.”"
