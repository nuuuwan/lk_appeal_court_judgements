"“By  'Illegality'  as  a  ground  for  judicial  review,  I  mean  that  the  decision-maker  must"
"understand  correctly  the  law  that  regulates  his  decision-making  power  and  must  give"
"effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in"
"the event of dispute, by those persons, by judges by whom the judicial power of the state"
"is exercisable.”"
