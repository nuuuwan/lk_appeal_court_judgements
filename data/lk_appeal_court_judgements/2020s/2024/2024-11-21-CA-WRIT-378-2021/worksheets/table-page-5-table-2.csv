"A.  Rajalingam 
v.  Dissanayake  Mudiyanselage  Udaya  Ranjith,  Municipal","Engineers"
"Department (Planning), Colombo Municipal Council,6 and the Court has clarified the status",""
"of the law on the issue as follows (per Surasena J);",""
"","It is of some relevance to observe that while powers and functions of the UDA Law has"
"","been set out under Part II of the UDA law, a new Part (Part II A) was introduced to the"
"","Law by the UDA (Amendment) Act No. 04 of 1982. The said new Part II A has laid down"
"a detailed ‘Planning Procedure.’",""
"I","t is under the said ‘Planning Procedure’ that section 8 J states that no Government"
"","Agency or any other person shall carry out or engage in any development activity in"
"","any development area except under the authority, and in accordance with the terms"
"","and conditions, of a permit issued in that behalf by the UDA. It was in that backdrop"
"","that Act No. 04 of 1982 amended the UDA Law by inserting the definition of a new"
"","term ‘development activity’ to its interpretation section, which is section 29. Thus, the"
"","concept of ‘development activity’ for the purpose of the UDA Law is nothing but part"
"of ‘Planning Procedure’ described in the Law.",""
"F","urther, it must be borne in mind that section 28 A (3) is also a new section introduced"
"","by UDA (Amendment) Act No. 04 of 1982 to lay down the procedure to be followed in"
"","respect of certain development activities commenced and continued without a permit"
"","or contrary to any term and condition of a permit. Thus, it could be seen that section"
"","28 A (3) has a direct bearing on sections 8 J and 8 K introduced by Act No. 04 of 1982."
"","Therefore, the procedure set out in section 28 A (3) is also indeed a part and parcel of"
"","‘Planning  Procedure’.  Indeed  all  the  above  new  sections  are  found  under  Part  II  A  -"
"‘Planning Procedure’ introduced by Act No. 04 of 1982.",""
"T","herefore, I have no hesitation to concur with the ratio decidendi of the judgment of"
"","the Supreme Court in Muniyandy paneer Selvam’s case that the provisions contained"
"","in  section  28  A  (3)  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  term  “planning”  and  therefore  the"
"","powers, duties and functions referred to therein could be delegated by the UDA to any"
"officer of a local authority.",""
"F","or the above reasons, I am in full agreement with the interpretation given to section"
"","23 (5) of the UDA Law by their Lordships in the cases cited above namely E R M Piyasena"
"Vs  H  M  Wijesooriya,  S  Sivapragasam  and 
two  others  Vs  Robert","Jayaseelan"
