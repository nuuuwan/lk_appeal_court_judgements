"In  a  marriage  registration,  the  parties  who  entered  into  the  marriage"
"provide  the  required  information  for  the  registration.  In  the  marriage"
"certificate of Dharmadasa (R-6) he may have informed the Registrar that"
"his father’s name is Peter Perera. The Registrar of Marriages would not"
"go in  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  that  information.  If  Dharmadasa  had"
"mentioned some other name as his father’s name, that name would be"
"mentioned as his father’s name in his marriage certificate. Therefore,"
"Dharmadasa’s  marriage  certificate  does  not  establish  that  he  is  a"
"legitimate child of Peter Perera. It is obvious that Peter Perera’s name"
"would be mentioned as the grandfather’s name in the birth certificates"
"of Dharmadasa’s children when Peter Perera’s name is entered in the"
"marriage certificate of Dharmadasa as his father. Therefore, the birth"
"certificates of Dharmadasa’s children  also do not  establish that Peter"
"Perera is the father of Dharmadasa. In the circumstances, there is no"
"proof that Dharmadasa is the elder son of Peter Perera."
