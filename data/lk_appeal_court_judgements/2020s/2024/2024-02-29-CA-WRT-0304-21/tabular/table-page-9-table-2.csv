"In  R.A.  Piyaratna  and  Others  v.  Buddhist  and  Pali  University  of  Sri  Lanka  and  Others"
"CA/Writ/133/2022 decided on 10.06.2022 I have observed as follows:"
"“The  Public  Trust  Doctrine  and/or  violation  of  fundamental  rights  or  any  other  ground"
"established through judicial creativity should be adopted in judicial review applications only as"
"a conduit to make a determination by Court ‘subject to the provisions of the Constitution’ and"
"‘according  to  law’.  I  find  that  the  grounds  for  review  in  writ  applications  are  inextricably"
"interwoven with the fundamental rights  recognized by law and however the adoption of such"
"grounds  should  be  carefully  done  by  Review  Courts  subject  to  above  limitations  based  on  the"
"respective jurisdiction of the Court.  Therefore, I am compelled to focus my mind with the issues"
"of the instant application in those lines and not make any determination just on a mere assertion"
"of an infringement of fundamental rights of a person.”"
