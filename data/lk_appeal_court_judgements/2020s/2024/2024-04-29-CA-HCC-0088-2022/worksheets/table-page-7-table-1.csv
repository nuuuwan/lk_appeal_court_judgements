"two persons in the lobby of the hotel and informed them that they were from the"
"PNB  and  that  they  would  be  searched.  When  the  appellant  was  asked  for  the"
"bag, he had reluctantly handed it over to PW-01. Inside the bag, there had been"
"a red-coloured box with a Bata mark, and when opened, PW-01 has found two"
"parcels  with  brown-coloured  powder  in  a  transparent  polythene  cover.  Upon"
"inspection,  she  has  determined  that  the  brown-coloured  powder  contained"
"Heroin."
"Accordingly, PW-01 has arrested the appellant. After the arrest, she has found"
"that the person who accompanied him was Shinaz Mohamed, the 2nd accused"
"indicted."
"Upon questioning, she has come to know that they were occupying room 710 of"
"the hotel which they already knew. PW-01 and her officers have gone to the 7th"
"floor along with the two suspects and has ordered the 2nd accused to open the"
"room. Initially, he had refused, but later he has taken out the key card from his"
"pocket and had opened the door."
"While inside the room, among other things, PW-01 has seen a travelling bag. At"
"that  time,  she  was  having  the  substance  recovered  from  the  appellant  in  her"
"custody. IP Subodha has searched the travelling bag which was a medium sized"
"bag. PW-01 has found the Maldivian National Identity Card belonging to the 2nd"
"accused inside the purse found in the travelling bag. When she opened the outer"
"zipper of the bag, she has found clothes, and after removing the clothes, another"
"zipper  has  been  found  towards  the  bottom  of  the  bag.  When  IP  Subodha  has"
"opened the zipper, a parcel covered in a tulip cover between the two handles of"
"the bag has been found. Inside the parcel, PW-01 has found three smaller parcels"
"covered in polythene bags, and a brown-coloured powder has been observed in"
"all three."
"Having been satisfied that the travelling bag belongs to the 2nd accused, PW-01"
"has proceeded to arrest him as well for possessing and trafficking of Heroin."
