"officer did not follow the instructions given to her."

"have been the CCTV footages as to the incident, and not taking steps to obtain"

"learned High Court Judge’s decision not to analyze the dock statement of the 2nd"
"accused who was acquitted of the charges, was an erroneous decision based on"
"a misdirection as to the relevant law. He made extensive submissions to claim"
