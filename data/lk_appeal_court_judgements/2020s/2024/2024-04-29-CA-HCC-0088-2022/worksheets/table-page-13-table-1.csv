"accused in favour of the appellant who was the 1st accused indicted, a fair trial"
"has been denied for the appellant."
"The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) submitted several decided"
"cases of our Superior Courts as to the manner in which a dock statement should"
"be considered by a trial Court, and the value that can be attached to it."
"He was of the view that a dock statement made by one accused cannot be used"
"against another accused in the same case, either to corroborate or discredit the"
"accused. It was his position that the learned High Court Judge has come to a"
"correct determination in that regard."
"In  relation  to  the  claim  that  the  CCTV  footages  had  not  been  obtained  by  the"
"prosecution, it was his position that the prosecution did not rely on such footage"
"but  on  evidence  available  to  them  in  that  regard.  However,  he  brought  to  the"
"notice of the Court that the management of the hotel where the arrest was made"
"has  informed  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court  that  they  no  longer  have  the  recordings"
"relevant to that day, as it has been removed from the system by an automatic"
"process. He has also explained the controversy as to the Pearl City Hotel and the"
"Pearl Garden Hotel. It was submitted by the learned SDSG that there had been"
"no  material  contradictions  or  omissions  in  relation  to  the  evidence  by  the"
"prosecution witnesses and there was no reason for the prosecution witnesses to"
"concoct a false story against the appellant and the 2nd accused both of whom are"
"Maldivian nationals."
"The learned SDSG moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the basis that the"
"grounds of appeal urged have no merit."
