"The Court held that the Jury must be directed that:",""
"","a.  The statement must be looked upon as evidence, subject to the infirmity"
"","that the accused had deliberately refrained from giving testimony, and"
"","therefore, was not subject to an oath or cross-examination;"
"","b.  If they believe the unsworn statement, it must be acted upon;"
"c.","If  it  raised  a  reasonable  doubt  in  their  minds  about  the  case  for  the"
"","prosecution, the defence must succeed; and that it should not be used"
"","against another accused."
