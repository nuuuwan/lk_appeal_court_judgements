"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  decided  to  acquit  the  2nd  accused  on  that"
"basis.  It  becomes  necessary  for  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  to  consider  the"
"defence  taken  up  by  the  2nd  accused  if  he  finds  that  the  prosecution  has"
"established  a  strong  prima  facie  case  against  the  2nd  accused  in  order  to"
"determine  whether  the  2nd  accused  has  created  a  reasonable  doubt  or  has"
"provided a reasonable explanation as to the facts against him. Since there was"
"no  determination  that  a  strong  prima  facie  case  has  been  established  against"
"him, I find that the learned High Court Judge has correctly determined that it"
"would not be necessary for him to analyze the dock statement made by the 2nd"
"accused indicted."
"I  find  no  merit  in  the  argument  that  the  said  decision  has  denied  a  fair  trial"
"towards the appellant."
"The next matter that needs the attention of this Court is whether it can be stated"
"that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  rejected  the  dock  statement  of  the"
"appellant  unfairly  as  claimed  in  the  3rd  ground  of  appeal  argued  before  this"
"Court."
"The judgment of the learned High Court Judge amply demonstrates that the dock"
"statement has been considered along with evidence placed before the Court and"
"also the stand taken on behalf of the appellant when the relevant prosecution"
"witnesses were giving evidence."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  claim  about  PNB  officials"
"discovering  Heroin  from  a  hotel  called  Peral  Garden  Hotel  at  Katunayake  and"
"whether such a contention has any probability, and has rightly concluded the"
"probable reasons behind such a contention by the accused in the case. It has"
"also been considered whether the alleged failure by the prosecuting authority to"
"lead CCTV camera footage evidence in its correct perspective in order to come to"
"a firm finding has created a doubt as to the prosecution case."
