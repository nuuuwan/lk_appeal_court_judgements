"against  the  accused  by  reliable  evidence.  The  accused  is  entitled  to  the"
"benefit of every reasonable doubt.”"
"In  the  case  of  Karunadasa  Vs.  Officer-in-Charge,  Motor  Traffic  Division,"
"Police Station Nittambuwa (1887) 1 SLR 155, it was stated by Perera, J. that;"
"“It is an imperative requirement in a criminal case that the prosecution must"
"be  convincing,  no  matter  how  weak  the  defence  is,  before  the  Court  is"
"entitled to convict on it. It is necessary to borne in mind that the general rule"
"is that the burden is on the prosecution, to prove the guilt of the accused."
"The prosecution must prove their case apart from any statement made by"
"the accused or any evidence tendered by him. The weakness of the defence"
"must not be allowed to bolster up a weak case for the prosecution. The rule"
"is based on the principle that every man is presumed to be innocent until"
"the contrary is proved, and criminality is never to be presumed.”"
"In the case of The Queen Vs. M.G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350, it was held:"

"held:"
"“Exaggerated  devotion  to  the  rule  of  benefit  of  doubt  must  not  nurture"
"fanciful  doubts  or  lingering  suspicion  and  thereby  destroy  social  defence."
"Justice  cannot  be  made  sterile  on  the  plea  that  it  is  better  to  let  hundred"
"guilty escape,  than  punish an innocent.  Letting guilty escape is not doing"
"justice according to law. Prosecution is not required to meet any and every"
"hypothesis  put  forward  by  the  accused.  A  reasonable  doubt  is  not  an"
