"54. The owner of a holding or permit-holder may make a further nomination in lieu"
"of any nomination which has been cancelled, and a person may be renominated as"
"successor  notwithstanding  the  previous  cancellation  of  the  nomination  of  that"
"person in such capacity."
"Accordingly, this Court is of the view that the cancellation of the Petitionerâ€™s"
"first  appointment  as  the  successor  and  reappointment  of  the  Petitioner  as"
"successor on 02.04.2008 had been affected in terms of the law."
"Nomination of the Petitioner, and the 7th Respondent as Co-Successors"
"It  appears 
from  the  Land  Ledger 
(P6) 
that  the  Petitioner  and  the  7th"
"Respondent were appointed as successors on 17.12.2008, giving an extent of"
"one acre of the land to the Petitioner and half an acre of the land to the 7th"
"Respondent  on  the  request  of  the  permit  holder.  However,  the  Petitioner"
"challenges such nominations of the Petitioner, and the 7th Respondent as co-"
"successors on the basis that the renomination of the Petitioner as successor"
"dated  02.04.2008  had  not  been  duly  cancelled  before 
such  multiple"
"nominations.  As  per  Section  62(1)  of  the  Land  Development  Ordinance"
"cancellation  of  nomination 
in  due  manner 
is  a  mandatory 
statutory"
"requirement before registering a new nomination. Said Section 62(1) reads as"
"follows."
