"Ordinance  emphasizes  the  strict  compliance  of  its  provisions  in  respect  of"
"the cancellation of any nomination or any nomination of a successor. Section"
"75 of the Ordinance stipulates as follows."
"75.  Any  nomination  of  a  successor  and  any  cancellation  of  any 
registered"
"nomination of a successor shall be wholly invalid if such nomination or cancellation"
"in any way contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance."
"Although the Respondents submit that the permit holder had nominated the"
"Petitioner  and  the  7th  Respondent  as  co-successors  on  17.12.2008,  the"
"Respondents have failed to satisfy this Court to the effect that the mandatory"
"statutory requirements were fulfilled in giving effect to such intention of the"
"permit holder."
"In the above context, I am of the view that the endorsement made on the"
"Land Ledger P6 namely “an extent of one Acre to be given to the Petitioner"
"and half an Acre to be given to the 7th Respondent” would not amount to a"
"lawful 
renomination  of 
successors

valid 
cancellation  of"
"nomination 
under 
Land

"law."

is  observed  that  the  nomination  of  co-successors  was  affected  as  a"
"consequence of an inquiry held by the Divisional Secretary of Minipe while"
"the permit holder was alive. The letter annexed with the Petition marked P12,"
"written  by  the  Additional  District  Secretary  of  Kandy  addressed  to  the"
"Petitioner refers that there had been an inquiry on17.12.2008 in respect of"
"the dispute of the subject land where the permit holder Baby Nona and the"
"Petitioner  had  signed 
the  statement  consenting 
to  give  effect 
to 
the"
"nomination whereby one acre of the land to the Petitioner and the half of an"
"acre  of 
land  to  the  7th  Respondent.  In  proof  of  such,  the  1st  to  the  6th"
"Respondents have submitted a copy of a document dated 17.12.2008 signed"
"by  the  permit  holder  and  the  Petitioner  before  the  Assistant  Divisional"
"Secretary of Minipe with a motion dated 24.07.2019 with the permission of"
