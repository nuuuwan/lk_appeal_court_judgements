fter careful consideration, we find that for Section 82(2) to operate the main ingredient"
"is that a  non-resident  person should carry on a business with a resident person. This"
"requirement  is  fulfilled.  However,  the  second  limb  of  the  Section  stipulates  that  the"
"business should be so arranged that the resident person should be left with no profit or"
"less than the ordinary profit which might be expected to arise from the said business."
"A
s per the license agreement the royalty is paid on the basis of a percentage on the net"
"sales price. As the agreement defines net sales price, it is quite clear that the net sales"
"will depend on the market modalities of the country. Hence, if net sales go down the"
"value of royalties paid will have a proportionately low value. This Court is also mindful"
"of  the  provisions  of  Section  104  of  the  IRA  pertaining  to  the  arm’s  length  pricing"
"between international transactions. The violation of arm’s length pricing would allow"
"the Assessor or an Assistant Commissioner to make an assessment as per the provisions"
"of the said Section. However, in this instance that situation has not arisen. As stated"
"previously,  for  Section  82  to  operate,  the  Appellant  should  have  established  that  the"
"resident person has either no profits or less than ordinary profits that are expected to"
"arise from such ordinary business."
"I
n this instance, the entity concerned earned a profit, but the question would be whether"
"it is less than the ordinary profit."
"T
he  Appellant  nor  the  Respondent  have  produced  any  material  and  have  failed  to"
"demonstrate what an ordinary profit is, which would have triggered the invocation of"
"Section  82(2).  It  is  the  contention  of  the  Respondent  that  as  per  the  statement  of"
"accounts the company has a net profit of Rs. 728,546,187 and has also paid income tax"
"worth Rs. 556,512,379. Hence, it is the view of this Court that the resident person in"
"this instance has declared a profit. Then, has the IRD established that the resident person"
"in this instance has declared a profit less than the ordinary profits that are expected to"
"arise from such ordinary business. This Court is unable to find any reasons given by the"
"Appellant to establish that the Respondent has declared a profit less than the ordinary"
"profit other than based on the amount paid as royalty, the statutory income in the audited"
"accounts."
"I
t is also apparent as per the determination of the CGIR it has come to the conclusion"
"on the applicability of Section 82(2) purely on the basis of the connection between the"
"two parties and on the payment of Rs.1,037,513,135 as a royalty payment. It is further"
"stated the said sum is paid from the statutory income. It is also pertinent to note that"
