"of sub-Section (5) of Section 32 or annuity paid by such person;‚Äù"
"As per the CGIR determination, the only ground the CGIR has given for disallowing"
"the royalty is under Section 26(1)(m). This Court will consider the applicability of the"
"said Section. The Section contemplates the ascertainment of profit or income. However,"
"Section  32  stipulates  the  deductions  permitted  from  the  total  statutory  income  in"
"arriving  at  the  assessable  income.  Under  Section  32(5)  royalty  paid  for  the  period"
"stipulated in the said section is deductible.  The taxable period in question is 2010/2011."
"Hence, in our view, there is no material to establish the applicability of this Section. It"
"is pertinent to note that none of the Counsel made submission on the applicability of"
"Section 32(5), other than the Respondent merely submitting that the deduction should"
"be allowed under the said Section. However, whether the royalties paid, fell within the"
"time period stipulated in the Section or not was not addressed by any of the Counsel."
"In the absence of such material and considering the taxable period the Court has come"
"to the above conclusion. This will be further elaborated later in this judgment."
