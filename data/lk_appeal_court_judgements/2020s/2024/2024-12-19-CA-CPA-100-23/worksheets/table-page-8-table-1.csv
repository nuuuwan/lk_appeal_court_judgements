"cheque, which has been dishonoured, has been issued with the intention of not"
"honouring the same."
"In determining so, the learned Magistrate has held that although the petitioner"
"has stated that the cheque for Rs. 500,000/- was issued for a business purpose,"
"the  petitioner  has  failed  to  produce  a  valid  contract  or  other  document  to"
"establish the matter, and it is difficult for the Court to believe that a businessman"
"would enter  into a financial transaction of this nature without entering into a"
"written agreement. It has also been determined that the cheque relating to the"
"cheque clearance notice attached to the plaint is a cash cheque, and there is no"
"proof to show whether it was a cheque given to the petitioner. It has also been"
"determined that although the petitioner has filed a document to show that the"
"accused is a director of the company that issued the cheque, the petitioner has"
"failed to produce a document to show, in fact, whether the accused was a director"
"of the company at the time the cheque has been allegedly issued."
"On the above-mentioned basis, the learned Magistrate has determined that since"
"framing a charge against an accused person is the prerogative of the Magistrate"
"in terms of section 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, she is not in a"
"position to determine that there are reasonable grounds to justify filing action"
"against the accused. It is on the above-mentioned basis; the learned Magistrate"
"has determined that there are insufficient grounds to issue summons."
"With due respect to the manner in which the learned Magistrate has determined"
"not to issue summons, I have no basis to agree with the reasoning given in that"
"regard.  There  cannot  be  any  argument  that  when  a  private  plaint  is  filed,  a"
"Magistrate  needs  to  be  satisfied  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  to  issue"
"summons to an accused person mentioned. However, it is  my view that when"
"determining whether sufficient grounds exist, the Court must look into that in"
"relation to the charge preferred against the accused mentioned."
"In the instant matter, the charge has been framed in terms of section 25 of the"
"Debt  Recovery  (Special  Provisions)  Act  No.  02  of  1990  as  amended  by  Debt"
