"of  the  Court,  which  in  my  view,  was  a  determination  made  without  properly"
"considering the legal principles that govern an application of this nature."
"I am of the view that the petitioner has adduced sufficient exceptional grounds"
"for this Court to intervene and set aside the order dated 03-03-2021 pronounced"
"by the learned Additional Magistrate of Colombo and also the  judgment dated"
"11-07-2023 pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High"
"Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo."
"Accordingly, I set aside both the said order and the judgment as both cannot be"
"allowed to stand."
"I direct the learned Additional Magistrate of Colombo to issue summons to the"
"accused mentioned in the plaint and the draft charge, and proceed therefrom to"
"conclude the matter as expeditiously as possible."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High"
"Court  of  the  Western  Province  Holden  in  Colombo  for  information  and  to  the"
"Magistrateâ€™s Court of Colombo for necessary compliance."
