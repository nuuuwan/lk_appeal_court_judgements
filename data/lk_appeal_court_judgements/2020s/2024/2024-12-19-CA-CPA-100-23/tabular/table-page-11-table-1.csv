"In the case of S.C. Appeal No. 182/2017 decided on 12-01-2023, Aluvihare,"
"P.C., J. expressed the following view."
"“At  this  juncture,  it  would  be  pertinent  to  consider  the  liability  under  the"
"penal provision referred to above. It is clear that the provision is not a strict"
"liability provision and a mental element is part of the offence."
"In an instance where a cheque is dishonoured due to lack of sufficient funds,"
"the  requisite  mental  element  is  knowledge  on  the  part  of  the  accused,"
"whereas when the reason for a cheque to be dishonoured is either the same"
"being countermanded or closure of the account after the cheque was issued,"
"when the mental element that has to be established is one of dishonesty."
"It is my view, that in a prosecution under section 25 of the Act, the reason"
"or the reasons as to the issuance of the cheque is not relevant, as the nature"
"of the transaction is immaterial as far as the offence is concerned.”"
