"case  of  Malinie  Gunaratne,  Additional  District  Judge  Galle  Vs."
"Abeysinghe and Another (1994) 3 SLR 196, where it was held;"
"“When a private plaint is filed, section 139(1) requires a Magistrate to from"
"an opinion as to whether there is ‘sufficient ground for proceeding against"
"some person who is not in custody’. The opinion to be formed should related"
"to the offence, the commission of which, is alleged in the complaint or plaint"
"filed under section 136(1). The words ‘sufficient ground’ embraces both the"
"ingredients  of  the  offence  and  the  evidence  of  its  commission.  Since  the"
"opinion relates to the existence of sufficient ground for proceeding against"
"the  person  accused,  the  material  acted  upon  by  the  Magistrate  should"
"withstand an objective assessment. The proper test is to ascertain whether"
"on the material before the Court, prima facie, there is sufficient ground on"
"which it may be reasonably inferred that the offence alleged in the complaint"
"or plaint has been committed by the person who is accused of it.”"
