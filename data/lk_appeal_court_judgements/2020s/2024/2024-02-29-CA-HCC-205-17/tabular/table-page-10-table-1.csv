"consequences of his conduct when he did certain things directed by the"
"appellant."
"N
ow,  it  is  important  to  consider  who  is  an  accomplice.  In  the  case  of"
"King  V.  Pieris  Appuhamy  –  43  NLR  412,  the  interpretation  given  to"
"“Accomplice” in the Indian case of Rekumal V. Emperor – 1934 AIR 183 is"
"cited as follows: “An accomplice is a person directly or indirectly involved"
"in the commission of a criminal offence.”"
"A
s  PW-1  was  not  mature  enough 
to  understand 
the  nature  and"
"consequence  of  his  conduct,  anything  done  by  PW-1  is  not  an  offence"
"according 
to  Section  76  of 
the  Penal  Code.  Therefore, directly  or"
"indirectly PW-1 could not be involved in commission of a criminal offence"
"and  thus,  he  is  not  an  accomplice.  Accordingly,  the  decision  of  the"
"learned 
judge 
that  PW-1 
is  not  an  accomplice 
is  correct. 
In 
the"
"circumstances, the issue of tendering  a  pardon by the Attorney General"
"would  not  arise.  PW-1  is  also  an  ordinary  witness  and  the  learned  high"
"court 
judge  has  correctly  decided  that  PW-1’s  evidence  need  not  be"
"corroborated to be acted upon his evidence."
"A
t  this  stage,  it  is  also  vital  to  consider  the  Amendment  No.10  of  2018"
"brought 
to 
the  Penal  Code,  although 
the  said  amendment 
is  not"
"applicable to the instant case. By the said amendment, Section 75 of the"
"Penal Code has been amended as follows:"
"S
ection  75  of  the  Penal  Code  (Chapter  19)  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the"
"""principal enactment"") is hereby amended by the substitution -"
"(1) for the words ""eight years"" of the words ""twelve years""; and"
"(2)  in  the  marginal  note  thereof,  for  the  words  ""eight  years"",  of  the"
"words ""twelve years""."
