ccording to Section 76, anything done by a child above eight years and"
"under  12  years  of  age  who  is  unable  to  understand  the  nature  and"
"consequence of his conduct at the time he or she is doing that act, is not"
"an  offence.  As  stated  previously,  the  learned  trial  judge  has  found  that"
"PW-1 had not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and"
"consequences  of  his  acts  when  doing  certain  things  with  the  accused-"
"appellant on his demand."
"W
hen  considering  whether  PW-1  had  attained  sufficient  maturity  to"
"understand the nature and consequence of his conduct, it must be noted"
"that the minor age of the child could be the only reason for a child to not"
"to  have  attained  sufficient  maturity.  However,  the  minor  age  is  not  the"
"only reason for PW-1 to not understand the nature and consequences of"
"the  acts  that  he  did  with  the  appellant.  PW-1  is  not  only  under  twelve"
"years  of  age  but  also  a  victim  of  continuing  grave  sexual  abuse.  The"
"evidence  confirms  that  he  was  a  child  who  had  to  obey  the  abuser  (the"
"accused-appellant)  and  do  things  as  the  accused-appellant  said  mainly"
"because  of  the  fear.  PW-1  has  stated  in  his  evidence  that  the  accused-"
"appellant  threatened  him  that  he  would  be  killed  if  he  says  something"
"about setting fire to the house to anybody (page 93 of the Appeal Brief)."
"Because  of  the  fear,  PW-1  stated  that  he  had  to  obey  the  accused-"
"appellant. In view of the aforesaid factors, it is evident that PW-1 had not"
"acted  with  the  intention  to  commit  a  crime.  It  is  apparent  from  the"
"evidence adduced in the high court that PW-1 was compelled to do what"
"the accused-appellant told him to do. The eleven-year-old boy was not in"
"a  position  to  refuse  to  do  what  the  appellant  directed  him  to  do.  Under"
"these  circumstances,  I  agree  with  the  finding  of  the  learned  high  court"
"judge  that  PW-1  was  not  mature  enough  to  understand  the  nature  and"
