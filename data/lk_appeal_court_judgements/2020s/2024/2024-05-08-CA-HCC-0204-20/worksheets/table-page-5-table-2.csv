"In Rex v Cochrane 1814 Gurney’s Report 479 Lord Ellenborough stated"
"“No person accused of a crime is bound to offer any explanation of his"
"conduct  or  of  any  circumstances  of  suspicion  which  attack  him  but"
"nevertheless if he refuses to do so where a strong prima facie case has"
"been made out, and when it is own power to offer evidence, if such exist"
"in  explanation  of  such  suspicious  circumstances  which  would  show"
"them to be fallacious and explicable consistently with his innocence. It"
"is reasonable and justifiable conclusion that he refrains from doing so"
