"“it would be necessary to show that the injury caused is not a cruel one.”"
"Considering the brutality of the offence, the amount of force used, the gravity"
"as well as the seriousness of injuries, I conclude this is not the case which"
"falls  under  the  Exception  4  to  Section  294  of  the  Penal  Code.  Therefore,  I"
"answer the final ground of appeal in negative."
"Considering all the evidence presented against the Appellant, I conclude that"
"the  prosecution  had  succeeded  in  adducing  highly  incriminating  evidence"
"against the Appellant and thereby has established a strong prima-facie case"
"against  him.  As  such  we  conclude  that  this  is  not  an  appropriate  case  in"
"which  to  interfere  with  the  findings  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  of"
"Hambantota dated 04/09/2020. Hence, we dismiss the Appeal."
"Appeal dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High"
"Court of Hambantota along with the original case record."
