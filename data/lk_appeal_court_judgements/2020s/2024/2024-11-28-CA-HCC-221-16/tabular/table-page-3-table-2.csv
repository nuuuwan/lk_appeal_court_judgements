"Kodagoda  PC,  J,  in  which  the  effect  and  the  impact  of  the  principle  of  reasonable"
"doubt , was stated thus:-"
"“The principle that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"
"and the accused is entitled to an acquittal if there exists a reasonable doubt has"
"been engraved in the criminal justice system of this country and in the rest of the"
"common  law  world.  That  is  to  ensure  that  only  those  actually  guilty  of  having"
"committed  crimes  are  convicted  and 
the 
innocent  are  acquitted.  Thus, 
the"
"application  of 
this  principle  should  cause 
the  advancement  of 
the  primary"
"objective of criminal justice and not frustrate it.”"
