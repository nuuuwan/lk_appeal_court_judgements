"This Court is very much aware of the fact that this pertains to an incident which had"
"taken  place  in  2001  and  the  trial  has  been  concluded  in  2016  but  it  would  be  a"
"travesty  of  justice  if  the  appellant  is  set  free  upon  only  the  consideration  of  the"
"nonapplication of the legal principles by the trial judge."
"As  such,  it  is  the  opinion  of  this  Court  that,  although  much  time  has  passed  since"
"the date of offence, it is  nothing but just and  fair that the instant matter should be"
"sent for a retrial."
"As such, we set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial judge but"
"we order that a retrial be held in the instant and we also order that this be concluded"
"expeditiously without any further delay by the relevant High Court."
