"Considering the above, I see no merit in the argument of the learned counsel"
"for the Appellant as to the first question of law on which special leave was"
"granted.‚Äù (Emphasis added)"
"A
s it was held in the aforementioned Supreme Court decision, in the case"
"at hand also, the age of the accused-appellant at the time of sentencing"
"must be considered. As stated previously, he was 26 years old at the time"
"of sentencing him for the offence of murder. The aforesaid Supreme Court"
"Judgement  had  been  delivered  prior  to  the  Amendment  brought  to  the"
"Penal Code by the Act No. 25 of 2021. By the said amended Act No. 25 of"
"2021, Section 53 of the Penal Code was repealed and the following section"
"was substituted therefor: -"
"53  (1)  Sentence  of  death  shall  not  be  pronounced  on  or  recorded"
"against any person who, is under the age of eighteen years, at"
"the time of the commission of an offence by such person."
"(2)  The  court  shall,  in  lieu  of  sentencing  such  person  to  death,"
"sentence him to be detained in an institution established under"
"any written law for the detention of persons under the age of"
"eighteen  years,  for  a  period  specified  in  the  sentence  and"
"subject to the provisions of such written law.""."
"Hence, it is precisely clear from this amendment also that before the 2021"
"amendment was brought, it had to be considered whether the accused is"
"under the age of 18 years at the time of sentencing and not whether the"
"accused is under the age of 18 years at the time of committing the offence"
"as decided by the said Supreme Court case because the sole intention of"
"bringing this amendment was to apply the age limit of 18 years to the time"
"of commission of the offence."
