"(SOR-2008) marked P27,
the Interview panel has no authority to change the"
"terms or elements of SOR approved by the DMS. The interview panel has to"
"comply with the Scheme of Recruitment
(SOR-2008) marked P27 whenever"

"The
outlined scope of
responsibilities makes
it
abundantly clear
that
the"
"incumbent
in the mentioned position must possess qualifications specifically"
"related to administration and management.
In the absence of any explicit"
"guidance
regarding
the
term 'relevant
discipline' within

Scheme
of"
"Recruitment,
the inclination is to interpret it as synonymous with the subject"
"area
directly
germane
to
the
responsibilities
inherent
in
the post under"
"consideration.
This
interpretation
aligns with
the
evident
emphasis
on"
"qualifications pertaining to administration and management as articulated in"
"the delineated responsibilities for the position. The apparent
injustice lies in"
"the allowance of candidates with unrelated degrees to be considered viable,"
"while candidates possessing relevant qualifications are unfairly sidelined."
"In the context of
the specified recruitment process,
it
is clear that candidates"
"lacking a degree from the relevant discipline will not be considered competent"
"or eligible. This means that the Scheme of Recruitment unequivocally requires"
"individuals
to
hold
qualifications
specifically
aligned with
the pertinent"
"subject area associated with the post under consideration. The emphasis on"
"the
""relevant
discipline""
underscores
the
importance
of
possessing"
"qualifications directly related to the responsibilities and requirements of
the"
"position. The intention is to ensure that candidates selected for the recruitment"
"process have educational backgrounds that align closely with the nature of the"
"role, promoting competence and suitability for the specified position"
