"Magistrate's Court of Negombo in case bearing No. 126/22.
It is against"
"that Order, the instant appeal was preferred by the Petitioner."
"This Court
is mindful
of
the
fact
that
the Respondent has not paid"
"maintenance to the Petitioner and his children from 19-06-2020 up to"
"date.
It appears to this Court that the Board of Quazis has not stated the"
"reasons
for
the
said interim Order.
It
is
settled law that
satisfactory"
"reasons should be given for
the judicial and quasi-judicial decisions. A"
"decision not
supported by
adequate
reasons
is
liable
to be quashed."
"Giving reasons for a judicial decision is an important
feature in todayâ€™s"
"context, which cannot be lightly disregarded. Moreover,
in a situation,"
"where giving reasons have been ignored, such a Court would run the risk"
"of having acted arbitrarily in coming to its conclusion."
"The
Respondent
was
in
arrears
of
maintenance
in
a
sum
of"
"Rs. 2,160,000/- at
the time of
issuing the impugned stay order.
In such"
"a situation,
there is a duty cast upon the Board of Quazis to give strong"
"and cogent reasons to recall the said enforcement certificate, whereas the"
"Board of Quazi has totally failed to do so.
In those circumstances,
it
is"
"the considered view of
this Court
that
the impugned stay order is liable"
"to be quashed on that ground alone. The Board of Quazis has failed to"
"consider
the fact
that
it
is the fundamental duty of
the Respondent
to"
"maintain
his
spouse
and
children,
he
has
ignored
that
duty
and"
"contracted another marriage.
It
is to be noted that
the Board of Quazis"
"has made
the
impugned Order
ex-parte without hearing the Petitioner"
"and thereby failed to adhere to the principle of audi alteram partem."
"It
is borne out
from the proceedings before the learned Quazi,
that
the"
"inquiry
was
held
inter-parte
and
the
Respondent was
heard
before"
"making
his Order.
The Respondent
has
placed
his
signature
on
all"
"proceedings.
The
Respondent was
present
in Court
on
the
day
the"
"maintenance Order was made. Moreover, before issuing the enforcement"
"certificate,
the
learned Quazi had issued a show cause notice
to the"
"Respondent,
returnable
on
15-10-2022.
On
15-10-2022,
since
the"
"Respondent
failed to comply with the Order of
the learned Quazi,
the"
"enforcement
certificate
was
issued.
In
those
circumstances,
it
is"
"abundantly
clear
that
the averment
contained in paragraph 11 of
the"
"amended
Petition
filed
before
the Board
of Quazis
stating
that
the"
