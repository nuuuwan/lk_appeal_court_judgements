"T
he Petitioner’s entire submission is based on two main grounds."
"One  is  that  the  Petitioner  owns  5/6thshares  of  the  Linthotakumbura.  It  is  his  contention"
"that  the  predecessor  to  the  6th  Respondent’s  title  gets  only  1/6th  share,  and  if  the  6th"
"Respondent is to be given a permit under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act,"
"the Regulations prescribed under the said Act  stipulates that  a co-owner who owns less"
"than 2/3rd share of a land has to obtain the consent of owners of 2/3rd share to obtain the"
"licence for gemming. Thereby, it’s his contention that the licence granted under X6 and"
"X21 by the 1st Respondent is bad in law as the said consent had not been obtained."
"H
is second contention is that in any event, the 6th Respondent does not acquire the title as"
"the predecessor in title to the 6th Respondent cannot execute a deed without the consent of"
"the  4th  Respondent  as  the  said  property  is  governed  under  the  provisions  of  Buddhist"
"Temporalities Ordinance."
"T
his Court will now consider the first submission of the Petitioner.  We find the Petitioner"
"has submitted his pedigree marked X1(i). As per the said pedigree, the 6th Respondent’s"
"predecessor gets only 1/6th share. However, this position has been strongly denied by the"
"6th Respondent. In his limited objections, the 6th Respondent too  has submitted his own"
"pedigree. Both parties rely on deeds to substantiate their title. However, it appeared that"
"the said pedigrees differ."
"T
he 6th Respondent in his submissions submitted as per paragraphs 27, 31 and 32 of his"
"limited objections the Petitioner does not get any title."
"It is clear that both parties agree that the original owner MedhankaraUnnanse at the outset"
"also had title to the said land. While the Petitioners say that Venerable Medhankara had"
"only 1/6th share, the Respondents say  down  the line  in  the pedigree  they  have  obtained"
"absolute title."
"I
n the objections of the 6thRespondent, they have pleaded “The land depicted in Schedule"
