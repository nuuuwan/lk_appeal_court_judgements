"the 9th accused indicted, has stated in his dock statement that he took charge of"
"the hotel as his friend who originally had the lease fell ill, and because he had"
"no  knowledge  of  hotel  keeping,  he  handed  over  the  hotel  to  one  of  his  friends"
"Upali Kokila Jayaratne."
"He has claimed that by that time, he was conducting classes throughout Kegalle"
"district and because of that, he used to visit the hotel only 2-3 days a week. He"
"has  claimed  that  on  the  day  of  the  incident  claimed  by  the  police,  he  was  in"
"Anuradhapura with his wife and child in order to fulfill a vow, and came home"
"two days thereafter. He has stated that while conducting his classes as he used"
"to be, the police team arrested him. He has denied any connection to the offence"
"as well."
"In  his  judgment,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  decided  to  acquit  the  1st"
"accused indicted on the basis that the only evidence against him was the fact"
"that he knew the place where the iron safe was thrown and that fact alone is not"
"sufficient to convict him for the offence."
"2nd accused indicted also has been acquitted on the basis that since he was a"
"regular employee of Bogala Graphite Limited, having his fingerprint on the jeep"
"used in the robbery cannot be held against him."
"The 3rd to 8th accused also have been acquitted on the basis that although money"
"have been recovered based on their statements to the police, that money has not"
"been produced before the trial Court, and also section 27 statement relied on by"
"the prosecution can only infer that the said accused knew the places where the"
"money was hidden and that alone is insufficient to convict them."
"However, the learned High Court Judge has proceeded to convict the appellant"
"on the basis that he was the person who had the full control and possession of"
"the hotel, and PW-25â€™s evidence has not been challenged as to the fact that the"
"appellant was in the hotel right throughout on the day of the incident, and left"
"the hotel in the night and returned. He has based his conviction on the evidence"
