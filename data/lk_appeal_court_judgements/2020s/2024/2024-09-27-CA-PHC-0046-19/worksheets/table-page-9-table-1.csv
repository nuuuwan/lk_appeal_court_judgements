"affidavit, but it does not extend to the second part concerning Form ‘C’ set out"
"in the Schedule."
"Thus, it is evident that the legislature, having made Form ‘A’ mandatory in clear"
"terms, intentionally chose not to impose the same requirement for Forms ‘B’ and"
"‘C."
"Furthermore,  Section  3  of  the  Act  does  not  specify  the  details  that  must  be"
"included in a quit notice. The matters that must be included in a quit notice are"
"specified only in Form ‘A’. Section 3 merely outlines the issues on which the"
"competent authority must form an opinion and the subsequent steps to be taken."
"In contrast, Section 5(1) (a) of the Act specifies the matters that must be included"
"in the application to the Court. Even concerning the affidavit, Section 5(2) only"
"requires that the application be supported by an affidavit verifying the matters"
"stated  in  the  application.  Nevertheless,  it  is  apparent  that  the  details  in  the"
"affidavit should correspond with those in the application."
"As previously stated, the legislature, in its wisdom, has made the use of Form"
"‘A’  mandatory,  but  not  Forms ‘B’  and  ‘C.’  This  further  supports  this  Court’s"
"observation that adherence to Form ‘A’ is compulsory, whereas Forms ‘B’ and"
"‘C’ are provided merely as models."
"However,  it  is  always  prudent  to  follow  model  Forms  ‘B’  and  ‘C’  to  ensure"
"accuracy, although it is not mandatory."
"In the case of Kandiah v. Abeykoon11, cited by the Appellant, this Court noted"
"that the Magistrate must ensure that the documents constituting the application"
"for  ejectment,  as  referenced  in  Section  5(3)  of  the  Act,  are  in  the  statutorily"
"prescribed Form."
"However, based on the analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act, it is my"
"considered view that only the quit notice must be in the statutorily prescribed"
