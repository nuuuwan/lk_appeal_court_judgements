"The learned High Court Judge effectively analysed the relevant law, upheld the"
"decision of the learned Magistrate, and dismissed the application for revision on"
"the grounds that the Appellant failed to establish any illegality that would shock"
"the  conscience  of  the  Court.  It  was,  therefore,  concluded  that  there  were  no"
"exceptional circumstances warranting interference with the impugned order of"
"the learned Magistrate."
"In light of the foregoing analysis, I dismiss this appeal, with costs of Rs. 50,000/-"
