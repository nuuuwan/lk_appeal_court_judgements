"Hence,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  the  pending  partition  action  is  not  an"
"impediment to maintain the application for ejectment under the Act."
"Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  pending  partition  action  does  not  an"
"impediment to maintain the application for ejectment under the Act."
"The Appellant presented an additional argument that there is insufficient proof"
"of serving the quit notice."
"The quit notice had been sent on the 6th April 201612. The Respondent produced"
"the registered postal article in proof of the fact that the quit notice was dispatched"
"to the Appellant by registered post13."
"The  Appellant  contended  that  in  the  registered  postal  article  the  date  and  the"
"name and title of the sender are unclear. While it is true that these details are not"
"clearly stated in the registered postal article which was voluntarily produced by"
"the  Appellant,  even  though  there  was  no  statutory  requirement  to  do  so,  it  is"
"important to note that the Appellant has not explicitly denied receiving the notice"
"in  the  affidavit,  filed  in  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court  along  with  his  objections."
"Furthermore, in the application for ejectment and in the affidavit the Respondent"
"states that the quit notice was exhibited in the land as well. As per Section 9(2)"
"of the Act it is not competent for the Magistrate to call for any evidence from the"
"competent authority in support of the application. Moreover, as I have already"
"stated,  the  Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  contest  any  of  the  matters  stated  in  the"
"application other than that he is in possession on a valid permit or other written"
"authority."
"Conclusion"
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  learned  Magistrate"
"correctly dismissed the objections raised by the Appellant and proceeded to issue"
"the order for ejectment."
