"that their actions were justified, including the suspension and the issuance"
"of the charge sheet (marked 'R14', 'R15', 'R16')."
"T
he Respondents also argue that the Project is nearing completion, rendering"
"the Petitioner’s request for relief, including reinstatement, futile."
"I
n  the  aforesaid  context,  Petitioner  contends  that  the  actions  taken  by  the"
"Respondents—specifically  his  suspension  and  the 
issuance  of  a  charge"
"sheet—were  unlawful,  arbitrary,  and  without  any 
legal 
foundation.  The"
"Petitioner  asserts  that  his  role  as  Project  Internal  Auditor  was  governed  by"
"specific contractual terms distinct from those applicable to public officers in"
"the  general  civil  service.  The  relief  sought  through  the  issuance  of  Writs  of"
"Certiorari and Mandamus is grounded on the premise that the Respondents"
"have  acted  in  violation  of  established  legal  principles  and  administrative"
"fairness, thus warranting judicial intervention in favour of the Petitioner."
"C
entral to the Petitioner’s argument is the nature of his employment and the"
"applicability  of  the  Establishments  Code.  The  Petitioner  maintains  that  his"
"appointment  was  governed  by 
the  Management  Services  Circular  No."
"01/2019,  which  specifically  addresses  the  terms  and  conditions  of  project"
"staff, 
including  salary  scales,  contractual  obligations,  and  disciplinary"
"procedures (marked 'P11'). He asserts that the Establishments Code, which"
"primarily  regulates  public  officers,  does  not  apply  to  his  role  as  a  project"
"employee.  The  Respondents’  position  that  the  Petitioner  was  bound  by  the"
"Establishments  Code,  particularly 
the 
requirement 
to 
resign  prior 
to"
"contesting  an  election,  is  therefore  legally  untenable.  The  Petitioner  argues"
"that  his  role  was  explicitly  defined  under  the  terms  of  his  contractual"
"engagement,  and  thus  outside  the  conventional  public  service  structure,"
"thereby exempting him from the provisions cited by the Respondents (marked"
"'P11', 'P27')."
"T
he Petitioner further contends that he had adequately notified the relevant"
"authorities  of  his 
intention  to  contest  the  Local  Authorities  Election 
in"
