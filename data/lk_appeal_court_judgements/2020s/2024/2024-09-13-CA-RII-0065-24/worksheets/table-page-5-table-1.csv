"or where there is some other remedy available (Mapalathan v. Elayavan 41 NLR 115). It is a"
"remedy which is granted under exceptional circumstances and the power of court should be"
"most  cautiously  and  sparingly  exercised,  (Perera  v.  Wijewickrama  15  NLR  411).  A  party"
"seeking  restitution  must  act  with  utmost  promptitude,  Babun  Appu  v.  Simon  Appu  11  NLR"
"115, (Menchinahamy v. Munaweera 52 NLR 411), and before a change has taken place in the"
"position  of  the  parties,  (Sinnethamby  v.  Nallathamby  7  NLR  139).  Where  there  has  been"
"negligence on the part of the applicant seeking relief or his attorney-at-law, restitution will"
"not  be  granted,  (Wickremasooriya  v.  Abeywardene  15  NLR  472).  The  party  invoking  the"
"extraordinary powers of this court must display honesty and frankness. Thus where a party"
"by its own conduct has acquiesced in or approbated the defective proceedings, court will not"
"exercise  its  discretion  to  set  aside  the  impugned  proceedings.  For  it  is  not  the  function  of"
"court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of the consequences"
"of their own folly, negligence or laches, (Don Lewis v. Dissanayake 70 NLR 8)‚Äù"
