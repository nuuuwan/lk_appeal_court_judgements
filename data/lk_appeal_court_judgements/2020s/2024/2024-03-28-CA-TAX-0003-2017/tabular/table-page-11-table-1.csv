"Respondent's  appeal  and  granting 
them  a  hearing.  Therefore, 
it 
is"
"apparent that although the CGIR has continuously maintained the stance"
"that  reasons  need not  be  communicated  to  the taxpayer in this  instance,"
"the  opinion  of  the  Deputy  Commissioner  General  of  Tax  Policy  was  to"
"the contrary."
"The reasons for the determination of the Respondent’s appeal transmitted"
"to the TAC by the CGIR15 signify that the appeal was registered only on"
"the  10th  January  2015.  Therefore, 
it 
is  evident 
that 
the  appeal  was"
"registered after an inordinate delay of one year and fifteen days from the"
"date of receipt of the appeal."
"Thereafter, the Senior Deputy Commissioner, Mr. M.L.J.G. Chandrasiri,"
"in  his  letter  dated  6th  August  2015,  following  an  additional  delay  of"
"almost 
seven 
months, 
requested 
permission 
from 
the 
Senior"
"Commissioner 
(Appeals) 
to 
refer 
the  matter 
to 
the  CGIR  without"
"attempting to reach an agreement within the appeal branch. This request"
"was  made  because  there  were  only  four  months  and  twenty  days  left"
"within  the  prescribed  time  frame16.  However,  the  Senior  Commissioner"
"advised the Senior Deputy Commissioner to schedule a meeting with the"
"taxpayer  promptly  and  attempt  to  reach  a  settlement.  Only  if  unable  to"
"settle, should the matter then be referred to the higher authority17. It was"
"contended  by  the  Appellant  that  a  letter  was  sent  to  the  Respondent"
"summoning  him  for  an  interview  on  the  20th  August  201518.  The  letter"
"requesting the Respondent for an ‘interview’ was counter signed on 13th"
"August  2015, 
seven  days  before 
the  date 
fixed 
for 
the 
interview."
"Thereafter,  the  Senior  Deputy  Commissioner  (Appeals),  in  his  report"
"dated  11th  September  2015,  counter  signed  by  Commissioner  (Appeals)"
"L.M.  Chandrika  Weerakoon,  submitted 
the  appeal 
to 
the  CGIR  for"
"determination. It is important to observe that the appeal report had been"
"prepared  by 
the  same  Senior  Deputy  Commissioner  who  signed 
the"
"aforementioned 
letter 
said 
to  have  been 
sent 
to 
the  Respondent19."
"Therefore,  if  a  letter  was  in  fact  sent  to  the  Respondent  by  the  Senior"
"Deputy Commissioner, undoubtedly, he would have mentioned about the"
"letter in his own appeal report prepared on  the 11th September 2015. As"
"correctly  argued  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondent,  the  letter"
