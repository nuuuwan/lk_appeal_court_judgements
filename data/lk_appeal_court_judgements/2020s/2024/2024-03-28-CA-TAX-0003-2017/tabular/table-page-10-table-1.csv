"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  I  hold  that  when  an  Assessor  rejects  the"
"return of a taxpayer and proceed to make an assessment, the Assessor has"
"a duty to communicate his reasons in writing to the taxpayer."
"In the majority judgement in the case of D.M.S. Fernado and another v."
"A.M.  Ismail13  (S.C.)  His  Lordship  Samarakoon  C.J.,  held  that  rejecting"
"the  return  without  communicating  reasons  goes  to  the  very  root  of  the"
"matter and is ultra-vires."
"The question of law No. 5 is formulated on the basis that the TAC held"
"that reasons for the assessment had to be given. However, I am unable to"
"observe any such finding by the TAC. All that the TAC held was that the"
"Assessor should  communicate to the  taxpayer in writing his  reasons  for"
"not accepting the return. Accordingly, I answer the question of law No. 5"
"that  ‘the  TAC  did  not  err  in  holding  that  reasons  for  not  accepting  the"
"return had to be communicated to the taxpayer’."
"In  consideration  of 
the  above  analysis,  I  affirmatively  conclude 
that"
"question of law No. 6 is answered in the negative, thereby supporting the"
"stance advocated by the Respondent."
"Was a hearing afforded to the Respondent?"
"As  per  Section  165(7)  of  the  IR  Act,  upon  receiving  a  valid Petition  of"
"appeal,  the  CGIR  is  obligated  to  conduct  additional  inquiries  into  the"
"issue and  endeavour to come to an agreement with the taxpayer.  In  this"
"instance  the  CGIR  has  acknowledged  the  Respondent’s  appeal  by  letter"
"dated 26th  December  201314.  The  acknowledgment indicates the  CGIR's"
"recognition of the appeal as a valid Petition of appeal. It is worth noting"
"that

the

"Commissioner  General  of 
Inland  Revenue 
(DCGIR)  by 
the  Deputy"
"Commissioner General  of Tax  Policy  (DCG  (TP)) on 2nd  January  2015,"
"the  latter  addressed  the  primary  concerns  raised  by  the  Respondent's"
"representative. The communication emphasised the importance of issuing"
"a  notification  letter  in  the  event  of  any  alteration  in  the  amount  of  tax"
"payable,  as  the  taxpayer  has  a  basic  entitlement  to  be  informed  of  the"
"reasons for such adjustments."
"Accordingly,  issuing  an  internal  circular  to  the  assessing  branches/units"
"was also recommended to minimise the number of unnecessary appeals."
"Ultimately,  after  addressing 
the  concerns  raised  by 
the  Respondent's"
"representative,
