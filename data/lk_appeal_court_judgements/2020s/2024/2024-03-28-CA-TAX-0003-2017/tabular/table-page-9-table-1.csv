"untenability of the said reasons at the hearing of any appeal that may"
"be preferred by him against the assessment. The return referred to is the"
"return  required  by  section  82  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act.  Under  the"
"Amendment,  what 
the 
taxpayer  should  be 
informed  of  are  only 
the"
"reasons in writing for non-acceptance of his return, but not the ground or"
"basis of the estimate of the assessable income made by the Assessor.’"
"(Emphasis Added)"
"The Appellant’s contention is that, in this instance the Assessor accepted"
"the assessable income in the return but, did not agree with the applicable"
"tax  rate.  Accordingly,  the  Appellant  argued  that  rejection  of  the  return"
"arises only when the assessable income is not accepted. The Appellant's"
"argument stems from the structure of Section 163  (3)  (b) of the IR Act."
"The  Appellant  asserted  that  the  rejection  under  Section  163  (3)  (b)  is"
"succeeded by the estimation of assessable income."
"I  am  disinclined  to  agree  with  the  argument put  forth  by  the  Appellant."
"The income tax return encompasses more than just the assessable income."
"It  encompasses  not  only 
the  assessable 
income  but  also 
the 
taxable"
"income  and 
the 
income 
tax  payable  based  on 
the 
taxpayer's 
self-"
"assessment. The income tax payable is calculated in accordance with the"
"applicable rate. In such a scenario, if the Assessor rejects the tax rate and"
"proceeds to assess and impose a different income tax, it becomes apparent"
"that the Assessor rejects the taxpayer's return. The requirement of giving"
"reasons for not accepting the return is contained in the proviso to Section"
"163  (3)  (b).  The  proviso  refers  to  the  return  and  not  to  the  assessable"
"income. Whenever, a return is not accepted by an Assessor, the Assessor"
"has a duty to give reasons."
"Further,  under  Section  163  (3)  (b)  of  the  IR  Act  the  Assessor  should"
"estimate  the  amount  of  the  assessable  income  and  assess  the  taxpayer."
"As  outlined  in  Section  163  (1),  it  is  the  amount  of  tax  payable  by  the"
"taxpayer that should be assessed. Section 163 (1) reads thus, ‘assess the"
"amount which in the judgment of the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner"
"ought to have been paid  by such person’.  Sub Sections 163 (a)  and (b)"
"also  refers  to  ‘amount  of  tax  so  assessed’.  Hence,  it  is  clear  that  the"
"estimation  of  the  assessable  income  is  the  initial  step  of  making  an"
"assessment, followed by ascertaining the taxable income and computation"
"of income tax payable in accordance with the applicable tax rate."
