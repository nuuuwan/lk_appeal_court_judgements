"established  in  the  case  of  B.W.  Podisingho  v.  P.A.W.  Perera22,  for  this"
"presumption 
to  hold, 
there  must  be 
evidence 
that 
the 
letter  was"
"appropriately addressed and dispatched, which is lacking in this scenario."
"Given the circumstances presented, I am inclined to agree with the stance"
"of 
the  Respondent 
that 
the 
letter 
in  question  was  not  dispatched."
"Moreover,  as  I  have  already  analysed  in  this  judgment,  it  can  never  be"
"considered a notification calling for the hearing of the appeal before the"
"CGIR."
"On the other hand, despite the Respondent presenting the aforementioned"
"letter  from 
the  Postal  Department, 
indicating 
the  disposal  of  postal"
"registration  documents  after 
two  years, 
the 
learned  Counsel  for 
the"
"Respondent argued that new evidence cannot be introduced in the Court"
"of Appeal during a case stated. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is"
"specifically  to  address  and  resolve  any  legal  questions  arising  from  the"
"case  stated23,  not  issues  of  fact.  While  under  limited  circumstances24,  a"
"new  legal  question  may  be  introduced  for  the  first  time  in  the  Court  of"
"Appeal, matters of fact cannot be revisited. Consequently, this court is not"
"empowered 
to 
entertain  new 
factual 
evidence  presented  here 
and"
"determine  whether 
the  notice 
in  question  was 
indeed  served 
to 
the"
"Respondent or not."
"The  Respondent's  argument 
is 
that  he  was  never  summoned  for  an"
"interview.  Furthermore, 
the  Respondent  asserted 
that 
there  was  no"
"evidence  whatsoever  indicating  that  Respondent  fixed  the  matter  for  a"
"‘hearing ‘in terms of Section 165(8) of the IR Act. The above Section also"
"stipulates that if no agreement is reached between the Appellant and the"
"Assessor  or  Assistant  Commissioner,  the  matter  should  be  fixed  for  a"
"hearing. In this case, the Appellant argues that the Respondent failed to"
"appear  for  an  interview  following  the  letter  sent  by  the  Senior  Deputy"
"Commissioner.  Consequently,  the  issue  of  scheduling  the  matter  for  a"
"hearing did not arise."
