"Appellant  informed  the  Court  that  he  would  stand  by  the  previously"
"submitted written submissions. The Counsel for the Respondent moved to"
"file  an  additional  written  submission,  which  was  duly  filed.  Following"
"this, the case was fixed for judgment."
"S
hould the Appellant have invoked writ jurisdiction?"
"T
he learned Counsel for the Respondent contended that this Court  lacks"
"jurisdiction to decide on the questions of law outlined in the case stated."
"T
he crux of the argument is that the Court of Appeal lacks jurisdiction to"
"decide on a case stated when the TAC has not reached a determination on"
"the assessment determined by the CGIR. The Court identified the above"
"argument  as  much  the  same  as  the decision of  this  Court in the  case  of"
"Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue  v.  Koggala  Garments  (Pvt)"
"Ltd3."
"T
he Respondent, relying on the majority judgement in the case of D.M.S."
"Fernado  and  another  v.  A.M.  Ismail4  (S.C.)  argued  that  the  Appellant"
"ought  to  have  invoked  writ  jurisdiction  in  terms  of  Article  140  of  the"
"Constitution.  The  above  was  a  case  where  the  taxpayer  applied  to  the"
"Court of Appeal for a writ to quash the assessment on the ground that the"
"Assessor did not give written reasons for rejecting the return. The Court"
"of Appeal granted the writ and the CGIR appealed to the Supreme Court."
"In the majority judgment, His Lordship Samarakoon C.J. observed that it"
"is a fit matter for writ jurisdiction; writ of certiorari. However, this was"
"not a case like the one at hand where the taxpayer exercised his right of"
"appeal  to  the  CGIR,  then  appealed  to  the  TAC,  and  subsequently  the"
"CGIR appealed to the Court of Appeal against the order of the TAC. The"
"Supreme Court did not consider the provisions regarding appeals such as"
"those in the TAC Act. As such, there are material differences between the"
"facts of the  said  case  and the  case at hand.  Moreover,  it is  important  to"
"note that His Lordship did not hold that writ is the only remedy. All that"
"His  Lordship  observed  was  that  writ  of  certiorari  is  the  appropriate"
"remedy.  It was just  a  passing  remark  made  in  response  to  a  submission"
"made in the case and was an obiter statement."
"T
his  Court  considered 
the  above  argument  of 
the  Respondent  as  a"
"preliminary question of law and held on the 25th May 2023 that this Court"
"has  jurisdiction  to  make  a  determination  on  a  case  stated  even  in  the"
"3 CA/TAX/01/2008, (Court of Appeal minutes dated 05/04/2017)."
"4 (1982) 1 Sri L.R. 222."
"4 
CA No. CA/TAX/0003/2017                                                             TAC/IT/044/2015"
