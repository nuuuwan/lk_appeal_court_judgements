"absence  of  a  determination  made  by  the  TAC  on  the  quantum  of  the"
"assessment."
"C
an the TAC make rulings  on issues that might typically fall under"
"the purview of public law?"
"The  Appellant, 
argued 
that 
the  TAC 
is  not 
competent 
to  make"
"pronouncements on matters falling under the purview of public law such"
"as  audi  alteram  partem.  It  was  submitted  that  the  TAC  is  a  specialised"
"tribunal 
equipped  with 
the 
expertise 
to 
address 
issues 
concerning"
"taxation. The Tax Appeals Commission consists of nine members, three"
"of  whom  are  retired  Judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Court  of"
"Appeal.  The  remaining  six  members  are  persons  with  knowledge 
in"
"taxation, finance, and law."
"However,  the  issue  in  this  matter  is  not  the  non-observance  of  audi"
"alteram partem rule itself, but failure to adhere to a mandatory statutory"
"provision. Therefore, I am of the view that the members of the TAC are"
"competent 
to  decide  as 
to  whether 
the  Assessor  communicated 
the"
"reasons  to  the  Respondent  for  rejecting  the  return  and  also  whether  the"
"CGIR provided a hearing to the Respondent."
"Be  that  as  it  may,  in  the  recent  case  of  The  Commissioner  General  of"
"Inland  Revenue  v.  Classic  Travels  (Pvt)  Limited5  (S.C.)  His  Lordship"
"Aluwihare P.C. J., (Vijth K. Malalgoda P.C. J., and Arjuna Obeyesekere"
"J., 
agreeing) 
considered 
the 
question  whether 
the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  could  dispose  of  a  matter  on  a  preliminary  objection.  The"
"issue  was  failure  of  the  CGIR  to  abide  by  rule  of  natural  justice;  audi"
"alteram partem."
"His Lordship having analysed Section 8 (1) (a) and Section 9 (10) of the"
"Tax Appeals Commission Act6, expressed the opinion that the legislature"
"never 
intended 
to  oust  and  limit 
the 
jurisdiction  of 
the  TAC 
to  the"
"substantive  matter  of  the  assessment.  If  the  legislature  intended  to  limit"
"the jurisdiction of the TAC to decide only the substantive matters of the"
"assessment, then such intention should be expressly provided."
"Commenting  on  preliminary  objections  His  Lordship  observed  that  ‘the"
"advantage  of 
the  preliminary  objections 
is 
to  prevent  unnecessary"
"litigation.  Hence,  the  purpose  of  preliminary  objections  is  not  to  stifle"
"legitimate  adjudication  but  to  dispose  a  matter  expeditiously  when  it  is"
"apparent  that  the  action  cannot  be  maintained.’ 
  In  conclusion,  His"
