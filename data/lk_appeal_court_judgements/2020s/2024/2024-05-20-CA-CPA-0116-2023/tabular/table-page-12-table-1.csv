"In  the  case  of  Siripala  Vs.  Lanerolle  and  another  (2012)  1  SLR  105  it  was"
"observed that several tests have to be applied before the discretion of the Court"
"is exercised in favour of a party seeking the revisionary remedy. It was held that"
"the aggrieved party must come to the  Court with clean hands and should not"
"have contributed to the current situation and such a party should have complied"
"with the law at that time."
"In the case of Liyanage and another Vs. Rathnasiri – Divisional Secretariat,"
"Gampaha and others (2013) 1 SLR 6 the Supreme Court cited and adopted the"
"well-known Latin maxim “Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt” which"
"means  “the  laws  assist  those  who  are  vigilant,  not  those  who  sleep  over  their"
"rights”."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge of Mannar has rightly understood this"
"position  and  has  recognized  the  necessity  for  not  allowing  the  process  of  the"
"Court to be used in whatever the way parties want. The learned High Court Judge"
"has well considered the relevant facts and the circumstances and has come to a"
"correct finding in that regard, which needs no disturbance from this Court."
"I am of the view that the learned Magistrate of Mannar, has gone out of the way"
"to accommodate the petitioner allowing him to establish the requirements of the"
"proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance."
"However, the petitioner has failed to make use of that opportunity and had failed"
"to show due diligence in maintaining his application to release the vehicles to"
"him on the basis that he is the registered owner of the vehicles and he took all"
"necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed. I am also of the"
"view  that,  under  the  circumstances  the learned  Magistrate  has  had  no  option"
"but to order the confiscation of the vehicles, which I find the only correct order"
"that should have been made."
"Accordingly, the revision application filed before this Court is dismissed for want"
"of merit."
