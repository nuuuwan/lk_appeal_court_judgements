"petitioner to establish his claim repeatedly,  the learned Magistrate has decided"
"that the petitioner has failed to establish his claim in terms of section 40(1) of"
"the Forest Ordinance, where the petitioner has failed to appear before the Court"
"as usual to substantiate his claim. This has resulted in the confiscation of the"
"vehicles on 03-08-2023,"

"cannot make use of the discretionary remedy of revision as a tool to get over his"
"own actions."

"case where a writ of certiorari, a similar discretionary remedy as revision was"
"sought."
"It was held by Sharvananda, J. (As he was then),"
