"party,  to  establish  before  the  convicting  Magistrate  that  he  had  taken  all"
"precautions  to  prevent  the  use  of  such  things,  as  the  case  may  be,  for  the"
"commissions of the offence. If the owner proves that fact to the satisfaction of"
"the Magistrate, no confiscation shall be made."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that,  once  an  accused  person  is  found  guilty  for  a"
"forest offence, it was up to the person who claims ownership of a vehicle used in"
"the commission of the offence, to come before the Court and establish that he"
"has taken necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed, which"
"includes establishing that he had no knowledge of the offence being committed."
"It is the view of this  Court  that, once such vehicle or vehicles being produced"
"before a Magistrateâ€™s Court on the basis that such vehicle or vehicles were used"
"in the commissioning of the offence, and once the accused is convicted, it should"
"not  be  the  prerogative  of  the  learned  Magistrate  to  go  after the  owner  seeking"
"him to establish his claim as had happened in this case."
"As  I  have  stated  before,  once  the  vehicles  were  released  on  a  bond  to  the"
"petitioner and after the matter was fixed for inquiry, it is clear that the petitioner"
"being  the  registered  owner  of  the  vehicle  has  shown  scant  disregard  to  the"
"necessity of him having to establish that he had taken necessary precautions to"
"prevent the offence being committed."
"I find that there was no necessity for the learned Magistrate of Mannar to issue"
"notice to the petitioner, when he failed to appear before the Court without a valid"
"reason, or even to issue a warrant against him. If the petitioner fails to appear"
"before the Court and establish his claim, it means that he has failed to establish"
"the requirements of the proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance."
"Even after the learned Magistrate was considerate enough to accept the reasons"
"given by the petitioner for not coming before the Court and fixed the matter for"
"inquiry  again,  the  petitioner  has  claimed  that  he  does  not  have  the  required"
"documents for the inquiry, which has resulted in the learned Magistrate allowing"
"further time for the petitioner to establish his claim."
