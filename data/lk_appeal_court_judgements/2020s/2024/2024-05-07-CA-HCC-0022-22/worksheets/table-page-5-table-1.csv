"he  had  arrived  at  the  correct  conclusion  and  nevertheless  the  position  of  the"
"defense is also highly improbable because if the husband of the deceased had"
"taken club first it could not have landed on the deceased because the deceased"
"and the husband had been standing side by side."
"Hence  on  considering  the  behavior  of  the  appellant  during  and  after  the"
"incident and the nature of the blow alighted on the deceased, and the doctorâ€™s"
"definition of the fatal injury, only points out to the murderous intention of the"
"appellant as a result of which the deceased had died."
"The doctor in describing the fatal injury had said that at the very beginning the"
"fatal  blow  will  not  cause  death  but  eventually  an  edema  of  the  brain  would"
"develop and that would cause his death."
"Hence,  the  nature  of  the  injury  on  the  deceased  is  dangerous  to  life  in  the"
"ordinary course of events."
"Hence the act of the appellant is an offence described under section 295 of the"
"Penal Code but as it does not fall under any of the exceptions to section 294 of"
"the Penal code the trial judge is justified in finding him guilty for murder."
"Hence, we see no merit in any of the grounds of appeal raised by the Counsel"
"for the appellant; as such we see no reason to set aside the judgment and the"
"sentence of the trial judge."
"As such the instant appeal is dismissed."
