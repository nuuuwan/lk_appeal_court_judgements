"the same day he had come back again scolding the deceased husband in filth."
"The  deceased  and  the  husband  had  gone  out  and  the  appellant  had  taken  a"
"club from the fence to the house of the deceased and had attempted to assault"

"had been standing near the husband."
"The deceased had fallen down injured and she had been rushed to hospital and"
"one day later she had succumbed to her injuries."
"The  deceased  person’s  husband  and  another  neighbor  had  given  evidence  at"
"the  trial  and  the  husband  of  the  deceased  had  narrated  the  above  mentioned"
"facts in evidence and had said very clearly that there was no provocation of the"
"appellant by them and that there was no fight."
"But  he  had  been  cross-examined  that  the  deceased  husband  tried  to  assault"
"the appellant and the said blow alighted on the deceased."
"But the husband of the deceased had denied the same."
"The neighbor who had given evidence had said that the deceased was alighted"
"with the blow which was meant to be for the husband of the deceased. But he"
"had very clearly said that there was no provocation or a sudden fight between"
"the  appellant  and  the  deceased  husband  as  suggested  by  the  appellants"

"the deceased and the blow had been dealt with a lot of force and it had caused"
"a head injury on the deceased which had caused her death."
