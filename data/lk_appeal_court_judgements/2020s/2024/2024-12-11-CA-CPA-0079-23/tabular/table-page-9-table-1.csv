"It is also my considered view that in such situations, the person who files the"
"revision application must plead as to the reasons why he did not or could not"

"to provide any reasons in that regard in his petition filed before this Court."
"It is also settled law that any person who comes before this Court seeking the"
"discretionary remedy of revision must establish sufficient exceptional grounds,"
"which needs this Courtâ€™s intervention."

"it was held that,"
