"Answering the preliminary objections, the learned Counsel for the petitioner took"
"up the position that the Hon. Attorney General has failed to file his objections"
"following the Appellate Court Procedure Rules."
"He relied on the case of Gita Fonseka Vs. The Monetary Board of The Central"
"Bank of Sri Lanka (2004) 1 SLR 149 to argue that the preliminary objections"
"should  fail,  as  it  has  not  been  supported  by  an  affidavit.  He  insisted  that  the"
"petitioner  has  submitted  sufficient  exceptional  grounds  in  his  petition,  which"
"needs the intervention of this Court."
"The learned Counsel explained the delay in filing this application stating that the"
"COVID pandemic contributed to the delay. He also submitted several grounds"
"challenging the conviction of the petitioner by the learned Magistrate and also"
"the appellate judgment by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High"
"Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle, stressing that this is a fit and"
"proper case for this Court to intervene and set aside the relevant judgments as"
"justice  demands.  He  also  submitted  that  there  was  no  fair  trial  towards  the"
"petitioner."
"Before moving on any further, I would like to comment on the argument mooted"
"by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  that  the  respondents  have  failed  to"
"follow  Appellate  Court  Procedure  Rules  when 
filing  objections  since 
the"
"objections have not been accompanied by an affidavit."
"I am of the view that the cited case of Gita Fonseka Vs. The Monitory Board of"
"The  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka 
(supra)  has  no  relevance  to 
the  above"
"submission."
"The  cited  case  was  a  matter  where  the  respondent  has  filed  only  an  affidavit"
"instead of a proper statement of objections in relation to an application before"
"the  Court  of  Appeal.  It  has  been  held  that  such  procedure  amounts  to  not"
"following Rule 3(4)(b)(i) of the COURT OF APPEAL (APPELLATE RULES) 1990 and"
"Rule 3(7), where it is necessary for a respondent to file a statement of objections,"
