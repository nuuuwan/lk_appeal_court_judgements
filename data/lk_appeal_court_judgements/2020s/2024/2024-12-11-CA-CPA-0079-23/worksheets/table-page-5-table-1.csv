"respondents raised several preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the"
"application.  However,  this  Court  decided  to  consider  the  said  preliminary"
"objections together with the merits of the application before this Court."
"The  learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that  this  is  a  matter  where  the  proper"
"remedy available for the petitioner was to file an application for Leave to Appeal"
"to the Supreme Court before the Provincial High Court itself, or to seek Special"
"Leave  to  Appeal  from  the  appellate  judgment  of  the  High  Court  from  Their"
"Lordships of the Supreme Court, which the petitioner has failed to do. It was his"
"contention that if the petitioner chooses to file an application for revision against"
"judgment  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  pronounced,  exercising  its  appellate"
"jurisdiction granted in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution, it is the duty of"
"the petitioner to plead before this Court the reasons as to why he did not exercise"
"his  statutorily  guaranteed  remedy.  The  learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that"
"since it has not been explained, the revision application should be dismissed on"
"that ground itself."
"He  also  submitted  that  the  petitioner  has  even  failed  to  provide  exceptional"
"grounds under which he can seek remedy of revision, and what he has stated as"
"exceptional grounds in his petition, cannot be treated as so. It was his view that"
"the  said  grounds  should  have  been  pleaded  in  a  properly  submitted  Leave  to"
"Appeal application before the correct forum."
"It was also pointed out that the petitioner has failed to explain his delay in filing"
"this revision application, which is a matter that disentitles him from seeking the"
"remedy of revision. It was also submitted by the learned State Counsel that the"
"learned  Magistrate  of  Galle,  as  well  as  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  the"
"Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle, has decided the"
"matter  on  its  merit,  and  hence,  there  is  no  basis  to  consider  this  application"
"based on exceptional circumstances."
