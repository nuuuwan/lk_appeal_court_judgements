"…Much of the value of direct evidence of identification will depend on the"
"personal appearance of the subject of identification. Many persons cannot"
"be easily distinguished from others. The liability mistake is greater where"
"the  questionable  identity  is  a  matter  of  deduction  and  inference  and  the"
"expression  of  an  opinion  than  where  it  is  the  subject  of  direct  evidence."
"(Wills, op. cit., 7th edition., pp 197-200)”"
