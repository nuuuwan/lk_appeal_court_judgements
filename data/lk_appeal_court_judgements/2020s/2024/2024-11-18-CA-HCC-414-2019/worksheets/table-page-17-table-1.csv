"to be to expect  an  explanation  of  telling  circumstances,  though  the  failure"
"that  is  commented  on  is  the  failure  of  the  accused to  offer  evidence  and"
"not to give  evidence  himself.  A  partyâ€™s  failure to  explain  damning  facts"
"cannot convert insufficient into prima facie evidence, but it may cause prima"
"facie evidence to become presumptive. Whether prima facie evidence will be"
"converted  into  presumptive  evidence  by  the  absence  of  an  explanation"
"depends on the strength of the evidence and the operation of such rules as"
"that requiring a specially high standard of proof on a criminal charge."""
