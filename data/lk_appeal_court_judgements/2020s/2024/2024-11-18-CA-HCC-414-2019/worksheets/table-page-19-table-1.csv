"I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has convicted the appellant"
"for the counts preferred against him after having considered the evidence placed"
"before  him  and  analyzing  the  same  as  he  should  have  with  the  relevant  legal"
"principles in mind."
"Hence, I find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court"
"Judge."
"Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed for want of merit."
"However, it is quite apparent from the indictment that the nine counts preferred"
"against the appellant had been based on one and the same incident."
"Count No. 1 to 5 had been on the premise that the appellant was a member of"
"an unlawful assembly and that he committed the mentioned offences while being"
"a member of the said assembly in order to fulfill its common object."
"Count No. 6 to 9 has been formulated in terms of section 32 of the Penal Code"
"on the basis that the appellant acted in fulfilling a common intention."
"The only difference between counts 1 to 5 and counts 6 to 9 would be that, to"
"establish counts 1 to 5, the prosecution has to prove that there were 5 or more"
"persons involved in the crime with a common object, whereas in order to prove"
"the charges in terms of counts 6 to 9, there was no necessity to prove the number"
"of persons involved in the crime, but only that there were two or more persons"
"with a common intention."
"Although I find nothing wrong in convicting the appellant on both sets of counts"
"based  on  the  common  object  and  also  on  the  common  intention,  I  find  that"
"sentencing the appellant for all the counts was a misdirection."
"I find that when it comes to sentencing, the learned High Court Judge should"
"have considered 6th to 9th counts as alternative counts to that of 1st to 5th counts."
"If otherwise, it would have  the effect of sentencing a person twice for the same"
"offence he has committed, which is not permitted under the law."
