"Commenting on the manner the PW-03 who was the injured person during the"
"incident  has  identified  the  appellant,  where  he  has  walked  around  the  people"
"who were paraded and stated that the person who caused the injuries  to him"
"had an injury on his hand, stating that is the reason why he is identifying the"
"appellant, it was contended that, the said fact has not been considered by the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge.  It  was  his  view  that  such  an  identity  cannot  be"
"considered as a positive identity."
"The learned President’s Counsel contended further that the learned High Court"
"Judge has justified the holding of the parade on the basis that the appellant has"
"failed to object to the parade. It was his view that it was the responsibility of the"
"prosecution to hold a proper identification parade and the due process has not"
"been followed."
"It was also his contention that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give"

"appellant was. It was also submitted that the evidence led before the High Court"
"shows that after the incident, there had been a discussion among the people who"
"gathered  that  it  was  ‘Julampitiye  Amare’  who  came  and  attacked  the  crowd,"
"which  has  obviously  caused  prejudice  towards  the  appellant  and  may  have"
"helped the witnesses to identify him at the parade."
"Although it was claimed at the hearing of this appeal that the learned High Court"
"Judge has failed to consider and evaluate whether the prosecution witnesses had"
"positively  identified  the  appellant  when  the  offence  was  committed,  I  find  no"
"basis to agree with such a contention."
"While summarizing the evidence of the relevant eyewitnesses, the learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  clearly  considered  whether  their  evidence,  as  to  the  manner"
"they were able to identify the appellant, was cogent enough and probable. It is"
