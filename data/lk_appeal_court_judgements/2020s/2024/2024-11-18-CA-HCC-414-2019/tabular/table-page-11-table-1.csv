"clear from the evidence that when the appellant and several others came to the"
"scene  of  the  crime,  the  appellant  has  not  made  any  attempt  to  conceal  his"
"identity. When he and the other persons reached there, there had been several"
"lights lit since it was a public gathering, although small in number. The words"
"allegedly uttered by the appellant also show that he and others had come there"
"without  fearing  any  repercussions,  believing  that  law  enforcement  authorities"
"will not pursue them. That may be the very reason why he has boldly remained"
"at the scene of the crime for nearly 30 minutes. He has only left the scene after"
"receiving a phone call, which shows that he was instructed by somebody from"
"outside to leave. The fact that the OIC of Katuwana police, who came after the"
"incident, using filthy language towards the victims of the crime for holding the"
"meeting,  rather  than  pursuing  the  criminals  who  orchestrated  the  crime,  and"
"also the reluctance of the police to record a complaint in that regard, establishes"
"further proof as to the reasons for the disregard the appellant has shown for his"
"identity being exposed."
"I am unable to find anything wrong in the manner the learned Acting Magistrate"
"has conducted the identification parade or the manner in which the witnesses"
"were able to identify the appellant. The learned Acting Magistrate has made the"
"relevant  notes  as  to  the  conduct  of  the  parade,  where  the  appellant  has  also"
"informed that he agrees with the conduct of the parade. There is nothing to show"
"that the height or the built of the appellant was the reason for the eyewitnesses"
"to identify him at the parade. The evidence led at the trial amply provides that"
"since the appellant has not made any attempt to conceal his identity, with the"
"aid of the light available at that time, the witnesses have identified him positively"
"based on their observations of the person."
"PW-03, the person who was assaulted by the appellant, has had the advantage"
"of observing him from a close range. That may be the very reason why he has"
"gone  behind  the  persons  who  were  at  the  parade  looking  for  an  obvious  clue,"
"where he has observed as to the injury mark the appellant had."
