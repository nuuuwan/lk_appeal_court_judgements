"those charges, all of which have been denied to the Petitioner at this inquiry."
"n Dharmaratne v Samaraweera and others the Supreme Court held that,"
"The basic standard of fairness implicit in the rules of natural justice required the"
"1st respondent himself, at some stage of his inquiry, to identify the allegation"
"against the appellant, to inform him thereof, and to give him the opportunity"

"proceedings, to analyze the entire evidence to ascertain whether there were"
"allegations against him, to assume that the commission wished to pursue those"
"allegations, and on that basis to request the Commission to allow him to defend"
