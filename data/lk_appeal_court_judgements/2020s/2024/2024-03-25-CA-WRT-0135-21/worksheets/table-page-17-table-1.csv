"Dealing with an inquiry held under Section 18(3) of the Consumer Affairs Authority act,"
"Justice Sripavan (as he then was) held in the case of Nestle Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs"
"Authority and another [2005] 2 Sri LR 138, 141 that;"
"""Though the aforesaid section gives certain amount of discretion to the Authority"
"in  order  to  decide  on  the  increase  of  a  reasonable  price,  the  exercise  of  such"
"discretion necessarily implies good faith in discharging public duty. The abuse of"
"power  or  discretion  constitutes  a  ground  of  invalidity  independent  of  excess  of"
"power.  It  is  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  when  a  power  granted  for  one  purpose  is"
"exercised for a different purpose or a collateral object or in bad faith, the court will"
"necessarily  intervene  and  declare  such  act  as  illegal  or  invalid.  Statutory  powers"
"conferred for public purposes are conferred upon trust and not absolutely. That is"
"to say, that they can be validly used only in the right and proper manner."""
"""The lawful exercise of a statutory power presupposes not only compliance with"
"the substantive and procedural conditions laid down for its performance but also"
"with the implied requirements governing the exercise of the discretion. Thus, all"
"statutory  powers  must  be  exercised  fairly  and  reasonably,  in  good  faith,  for  the"
"purposes  for  which  they  are  given  with  due  regard  to  relevant  considerations"
"without being influenced by irrelevant considerations."""
