"Thereafter, the evidence of PW-06, the attesting witness number 1 to the sales"
"agreement had been led."
"According to him PW-03 had been their company notary and one day the 1st"
"accused had come with the second attesting witness with the deed to the"
"instant land."
"PW-06 had got PW-03 to do a search and PW-03 had told him that the land is"
"being sold for a very minimum amount and that he will give the money"
"personally."
"Thereafter, the 1st accused had brought the 2nd accused and had introduced"
"him as one of the owners."
"Thereafter, the sales agreement had been drawn and, on that day, the 1st"
"accused had not come but the 2nd accused had come with another person"
"impersonating PW-02."
"Thereafter, PW-03 had paid the 2nd accused and PW-06 and the second"
"attesting witness had signed as witnesses and PW-03 had acted as the notary."
"But PW-06 as one of the attesting witnesses had not tried to verify the identity"
"of the owners to the land which was his duty."
"Thereafter, he had started to clear the property along with PW-03 at that point"
"the 1st accused and PW-01 and PW-02 had intervened."
"PW-06 had been lengthily cross-examined and it had been brought to the"
"notice of Court that PW-06 has not told the CID that the 1st accused brought"
"the 2nd accused as the owner and the handing over of money to the 2nd"
"accused."
"Therefore, the most important aspect of the evidence of PW-06 has been"
"subject to a very important omission."
"PW-06 has further high-lighted the fact that for the money transaction the 1st"
"accused had not participated and that was intentional, but this too he has not"
"told the CID."
"Thereafter, the prosecution has led the evidence PW-03, who had been the"
"notary in alleged sales agreement, according to whom he had not known PW-01"
"and PW-02 but the impersonated owners had been introduced to him by PW-06"
"and the deceased second witness namely Sooriayarachchi."
"He says that he checked the IDs of the fictitious owners and he attested the"
"sales agreement and the beneficiary had been his wife and he had given PW-06"
"to develop the land. When the land was being developed, the real owners had"
"intervened and the investigations had begun."
