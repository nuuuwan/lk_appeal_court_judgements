"the owners and that it was PW-06, who introduced him to the land on the deed"
"brought to him by the 1st accused."
"But the 1st accused had said that he advertised and for this advertisement"
"Sooriyaarachchi responded and took him to PW-03 and he handed over the"
"documents to him."
"But the evidence of the 1st accused had not been contradicted but the evidence"
"of PW-06 who had been the link between the 1st accused and the notary had"
"given contradictory evidence."
"The presence of the 2nd accused comes out only in the evidence PW-06 which"
"cannot be relied upon because it has been contradicted which the trial judge"
"had heavily relied on."
"The involvement of the 1st accused is that PW-01 and PW-02 had heavily relied"
"on him and they had handed him over the alleged documents for the sale of the"
"land and the 1st accused had advertised the land and Sooriyarachchi a land"
"broker had approached him and had introduced to PW-03."
"But according to the prosecution version the 1st accused had approached PW-"
"06 and PW-03 with Sooriyarachchi but the evidence of PW-03 is that at the"
"time the impersonation took place and the sales agreement was drawn the 1st"
"accused had not been there."
"Therefore, the evidence against the 1st accused for conspiracy is that he had"
"got PW-01 and PW-02 to sign on empty papers but there is no evidence to say"
"that those papers were used to commit the impersonation because at the time"
"the impersonation took place, the 1st accused had not been at the scene."
"The 1st accused involvement had been only with regard to the agreement of the"
"sale of the land which had been done with the utmost trust of PW-01 and PW-"
"02 and even when giving evidence they do not level any allegation towards the"
"1st accused."
"The learned trial judge had found the 1st accused also guilty, relying heavily on"
"the evidence of PW-06, which had subjected to very important infirmities,"
"which makes him an unreliable witness."
"Therefore, having considered the evidence of both parties, it is the opinion of"
"this Court that the trial judge had failed to appreciate the fact that the"
"attesting witness PW-06, had misled all parties by vouching for the identity of"
"the fake owners, and that the notary also had failed in his duty to ascertain"
"whether the persons who came to sign the sales agreement are the true owners"
"of the land, unless he had an ulterior motive, because he had been the"
"beneficiary of the transaction, which the trial judge had failed to appreciate."
