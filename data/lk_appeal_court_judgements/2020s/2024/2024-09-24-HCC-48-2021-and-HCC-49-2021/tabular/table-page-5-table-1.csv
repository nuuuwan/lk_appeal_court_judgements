"He says that he paid money to the fictitious owners as well and when the real"
"came along he and his wife filed a case in the Mt. Lavinia Courts and paid the"
"real owners and got the land written in the name of his wife. The credibility of"
"this witness had been attached by the defense by bringing to the notice of the"
"Court that he had been accused of various violations of the law as a Notary."
"Nevertheless, it has to be stated that PW-03 has clearly shirked his"
"responsibilities as a Notary."
"Therefore, according to the story of the prosecution, PW-01 and PW-02 has had"
"absolute faith in the 1st accused and PW-01, and PW-02 had given the duty of"
"disposing the subject matter and the 1st accused had approached PW-06."
"PW-06 had said that the 1st accused came to meet him with the 2nd accused"
"and the second witness and the 2nd accused had been introduced as the owner"
"of the land and PW-03, who had been their company lawyer, had wanted to"
"buy this land and an agreement of sale had been drawn in which the 2nd"
"accused and another fictitious person had pretended to be the owners and they"
"had received money. The 1st accused had not been present at this attestation."
"Hence, the 2nd accused has been implicated by PW-06 but his evidence has"
"been subject to a very vital omission, where he had not mentioned at all the"
"involvement of the 2nd accused to the CID and the fact that the 1st accused"
"introduced the 2nd accused to him."
"Hence, although the prosecution has heavily relied on the evidence of PW-06 to"
"implicate the 1st accused and the 2nd accused, he had not been a very reliable"
"witness."
"Furthermore, from the evidence of the prosecution PW-01 and PW-02 had"
"received money for the value of the land from PW-03 and what PW-01 had"
"stressed is that he and PW-02 do not want to go against the 1st accused but to"
"ascertain the real culprits who had impersonated them."
"The culpability of the 1st accused and the 2nd accused had been challenged very"
"seriously by the defense in cross-examination but the trial judge had failed to"
"consider the same."
"The Examiner of Questioned documents had certified that the signatures of the"
"owners are not the real signatures of PW-01 and PW-02."
"Upon the conclusion of the case for the prosecution the defense had been"
"called and the 1st accused had given evidence on oath and had said that he"
"had been married to the sister of PW-01 and PW-02 and they had lived with"
"him after they left the orphanage."
