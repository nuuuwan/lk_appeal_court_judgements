"PW-02 had given the house on the land in question on rent. Then he had"
"befriended them and had made PW-01 and PW-02 contact them and thereafter"
"they also had agreed that PW-01 and PW-02 had owned the land but the sister"
"also has had an undivided right to a portion of the land. As such, another deed"
"had been executed, dividing the land among PW-01, PW-02 and Mahendra"
"Welikala. This deed had been executed by notary Jagath Wimalasuriya, who"
"had been a junior to PW-03."
"Thereafter, PW-01 had wanted to sell the portions of land owned by PW-01 and"
