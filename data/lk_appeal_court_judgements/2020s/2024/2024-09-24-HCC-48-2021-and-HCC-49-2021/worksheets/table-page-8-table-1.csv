"The trial judge had also heavily relied on the evidence of PW-06, which had"
"been subjected to some serious infirmities."
"Therefore, it is the well-considered view of this Court that the prosecution had"
"not proved the charges in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt, hence,"
"the instant appeal is allowed and the first and the second appellants are"
"hereby acquitted of the charges in the indictment."
