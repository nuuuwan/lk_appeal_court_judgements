"The accused had made a statement from the dock according to which he"
"had  admitted  of  going  to  the  house  of  PW2  and  the  whole  sequence  of"
"events  where  he  had  taken  the  victim  to  buy  cigars  and  thereafter,  he"
"had said that he dropped off the child and went back to duty."
"But the next day he had been contacted by PW2, who had told him of the"
"alleged  incident  and  said  that  if  Rs.  100,000  was  given  they  can  settle"
"the  matter  and  because  he  refused  to  do  so  the  instant  allegation  has"
"been made."
"But  it  has  to  be  noted  that  the  prosecution  witnesses,  the  victim  and"
"PW2  when  giving  evidence  in  the  trial  court  they  had  not  been  cross-"
"examined with this position of the accused. The line of cross-examination"
"had been to the effect that the witnesses were lying."
"Hence  the  position  taken  up  by  the  accused  in  the  dock  statement  had"
"not  been  put  to  the  witnesses  in  the  prosecution,  thereby  making  it  a"
"defence based on an afterthought."
"The  counsel  for  the  petitioner  alleged  that  the  trial  judge  had  failed  to"
"consider  the  improbable  story  of  the  prosecution,  which  this  court  has"
"already held that there is no reason to believe that the victim was lying."
"Thereafter, the counsel for the petitioner alleged that it is not safe to act"
"on the uncorroborated testimony of a child witness."
"But  this  too  we  have  found  to  be  without  merit  because  the  victim  had"
"been corroborated by PW2 and the doctor. Hence, that ground raised by"
"the counsel also fails."
"The next ground of appeal raised by the counsel is that the learned trial"
"judge  had  failed  to  observe  that  the  prosecution  had  not  proved  the"
"ingredients  of  the  offence  based  on  the  medical  and  police  evidence"
"(further at pages 197, 198 and 202 of the brief)."
