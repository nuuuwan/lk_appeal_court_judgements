"At  this  point  it  has  to  be  noted  that  the  doctor  had  recorded  a  history"
"given  by  the  victim  to  the  doctor  in  which  he  had  alleged  the  anal"
"intercourse  and  had  spoken  of  an  injury  and  the  doctor  had  observed"
"one on the chest which he had said had been due to some finger mark,"
"which the victim had explained to be of the accused, when he had been"
"holding him tight."
"The  police  could  not  have  observed  any  sign  of  a  struggle  because  the"
"floor  of  the  house  had  been  mud  thatched.  Therefore,  that  ground  also"
"fails."
"As such, it is the opinion of this Court that the grounds of review raised"
"by the counsel for the petitioner is devoid of any merit and the trial judge"
"had  considered  and  had  been  mindful  of  the  all  the  legal  principles"
"raised  by  the  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  the  facts  pertaining  to  the"
"case.  As  such,  it  is  opinion  of  this  court  that  there  is  no  exceptional"
"ground or other lawful basis to act in review as urged by the counsel for"
"the petitioner."
"As such, the conviction and sentence with regard to charges number two"
"and  three  of  the  accused  is  hereby  affirmed  and  the  conviction  and"
"sentence with regard to charge number one is hereby set aside."
