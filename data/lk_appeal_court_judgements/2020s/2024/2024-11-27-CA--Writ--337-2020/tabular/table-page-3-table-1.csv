"The  Petitioner  submits  that  the  surprise  inspection  conducted  on  17  July"
"2020 lacked transparency. While tea samples were collected in the presence"
"of representatives from the factory, the sealing and labeling of these samples"
"were done in secrecy, without allowing the factory’s agents to witness or verify"
"the  process.  The  Petitioner  argues  that  this  compromised  the  chain  of"
"custody, raising doubts about the authenticity and integrity of the samples."
"The Petitioner further contends that these samples were sent for laboratory"
"analysis without its knowledge or consent and that no laboratory reports were"
"provided to the Petitioner during the process."
"T
he inquiry held on 14 August 2020 is described by the Petitioner as being"
"fundamentally  deficient  and  conducted  in  violation  of  natural  justice.  The"
"Petitioner states that it received only two days’ notice for the inquiry, which"
"was insufficient to prepare a defence. During the inquiry, no specific charges"
"were  formally  communicated,  and  the  Petitioner  was  not  given  access  to"
"laboratory  reports  or  other  evidence  used  against  it.  The  Petitioner  also"
"emphasizes  that  it was  denied  the  opportunity  to  cross-examine  witnesses,"
"including the officials who conducted the inspection and any technical experts"
"who analyzed the samples."
"T
he Petitioner highlights that the inquiry was conducted by the Deputy Tea"
"Commissioner, an official of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, thereby violating the"
"principle of nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in their own"
"cause).  The  Petitioner  submits  that  the  inquiry  was  inherently  biased  and"
"conducted  in  a  manner  that  deprived  it of  a  fair  hearing.  Furthermore,  the"
"findings of the inquiry relied heavily on an alleged confession by a temporary"
"employee, R. Prajoth Shanukshan, which the Petitioner asserts is unreliable"
"and was obtained under questionable circumstances."
"T
he Petitioner also challenges the substantive basis of the decision to cancel"
"its  registration.  It  argues  that  the  Respondents  improperly  relied  on  prior"
"allegations from 2017, which were compounded without prejudice and did not"
"result in any conviction or finding of guilt. The Petitioner asserts that such"
"compounded  allegations  should  not  have  been  considered  in  the  present"
"decision. Moreover, independent laboratory reports obtained by the Petitioner"
"confirm that the tea produced at the Craig Estate Tea Factory met premium"
"quality standards during the relevant period."
"F
inally, the Petitioner underscores the severe economic consequences of the"
"Respondents’  actions,  causing  substantial  financial  losses  and  jeopardizing"
"the livelihoods of its employees. The Petitioner contends that the decision was"
"disproportionate, arbitrary, and motivated by improper considerations."
