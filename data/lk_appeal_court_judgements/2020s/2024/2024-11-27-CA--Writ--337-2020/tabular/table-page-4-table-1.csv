"The Respondents’ Contention"
"T
he  Respondents, 
including  the  Sri  Lanka  Tea  Board  and 
its  officials,"
"maintain 
that 
their  actions  were 
lawful,  necessary,  and  conducted 
in"
"accordance  with  the  Tea  Control  Act  No.  51  of  1957.  They  argue  that  the"
"inspection,  inquiry,  and  subsequent  cancellation  of  the  Craig  Estate  Tea"
"Factory’s  registration  were 
justified 
to  ensure  compliance  with  quality"
"standards  in  the  tea  industry  and  protect  the  reputation  of Sri  Lankan  tea"
"exports."
"T
he  Respondents  assert  that  the  surprise  inspection  on  17  July  2020  was"
"conducted  in  line  with  standard  procedures  and  revealed  the  presence  of"
"ferrous sulphate above permissible levels in the tea samples. They contend"
"that the collection, sealing, and dispatch of these samples were carried out"
"transparently  and  that  any  allegations  to  the  contrary  are  unfounded.  The"
"laboratory  reports  confirming  the  contamination  were  relied  upon  in  good"
"faith,  and  the  Respondents  argue  that  these  findings  provided  sufficient"
"grounds for initiating an inquiry."
"T
he Respondents defend the conduct of the inquiry, asserting that adequate"
"notice  was  given  to  the  Petitioner  and  that  the  inquiry  process  adhered  to"
"procedural  requirements.  They  argue  that  the  Petitioner’s  representatives"
"were  present  during 
the 
inquiry  and  had 
the  opportunity 
to  make"
"representations.  The  alleged  confession  by  a  temporary  employee  of  the"
"Petitioner,  which  implicated  the  factory  in  the  use  of  ferrous  sulphate,  is"
"presented by the Respondents as credible evidence supporting the findings of"
"the inquiry."
"T
he Respondents further contend that the decision to cancel the registration"
"of the Craig Estate Tea Factory was taken in accordance with Section 8(2) of"
"the Tea Control Act and was based on the findings of both the inspection and"
"the  inquiry.  They  argue  that  the  cancellation  was  a  necessary  measure  to"
"address  serious  violations  of  quality  standards  and  that  the  Petitioner  had"
"previously been implicated in a similar violation in 2017."
"I
n response to the Petitioner’s claim that it lacked alternative remedies, the"
"Respondents submit that the Petitioner could have appealed the decision to"
"the  Minister  under Section  37(1)(e)  of  the  Tea  Control  Act. They  argue  that"
"this  statutory  remedy  provided  an  adequate  avenue  for  the  Petitioner  to"
"challenge the decision and that the failure to pursue this remedy weakens the"
"Petitioner’s case for judicial review."
