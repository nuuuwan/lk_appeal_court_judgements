"These  procedural  deficiencies  are  not  merely  technical  lapses  but  go  to  the"
"root  of  the  decision-making  process,  rendering  it  fundamentally  unfair  and"
"invalid.  The  violations  of  natural  justice  identified  in  this  case  are  well-"
"established  grounds  for  judicial  intervention,  as  reaffirmed  in  numerous"
"precedents, including University of Ceylon v. Fernando (1960) 61 NLR 505 and"
"Kahatagaha Mines v. Fernando, 78 NLR 273."
