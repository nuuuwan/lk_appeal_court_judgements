"evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden"
"is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to"
"give evidence and explain the circumstances."
"In this case, the case is rest on direct and circumstantial evidence."
"In the first ground of appeal the Counsel for the Appellant contends that the"
"Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the special exceptions in"
"the light of sudden fight and sudden provocation."
"Exception 1 to Section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:"
"“Couplable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the"
"power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, cause the death"
"of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other"
"person by mistake or accident”."
