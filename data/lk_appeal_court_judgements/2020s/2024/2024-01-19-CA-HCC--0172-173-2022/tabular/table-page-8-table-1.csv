"CA/HCC/172-173/22"
"The evidence led at the trial clearly proves the intention of the Appellant at"
"the time of killing. There were two separate incidents had happened on the"
"day of the incident in question. At the time of the incident, according to the"
"evidence led, does not show provocative behaviour of PW3 or the deceased"
"when they were approaching the place of incident."
"The Appellant had failed to take up the position that the deceased or PW3"
"provoked him and he lost his self-control due to such provocation. Even if"
"the initial incident -the scuffle between PW3 and the Appellant-is taken as"
"an act of provocation, there was a cooling off period between the said incident"
"and the act of stabbing with the knife."
"The Learned Additional Solicitor General very correctly contended that if the"
"incident of slapping in the morning is considered as the act of provocation,"
"it was done by PW3 and not by the deceased and the explanation says that"
"whether it is grave and sudden enough depends on the facts of the case. PW3"
"had  slapped  him  twice  because  the  Appellant  had  lied  that  he  didn’t  visit"
"PW3’s  house  the  night  before.  The  Learned  ASG  further  contended  that"
"merely slapping a person twice with the hand doesn’t provoke a reasonable"
"man to commit murder. Hence, he submitted that the Appellant should not"
"be entitled to succeed in this exception of grave and sudden provocation."
"Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code states:"
