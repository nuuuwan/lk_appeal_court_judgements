"","“Lord  Denman  C.J.  There  is  nothing  in  this  case  but  a  great  deal"
"","ofingenuity,and  a 
little  wilful  blindness 
to 
the  actual 
terms  of

"","the  executors  to  enter  into  such  a  contract.  Mr.Williams's  definition  of"

"","means  one  which  confers  what  the 
law  considers  a  benefit  on  the"

the 
obligation

is 
one  which  might

is  not

from 
the  plaintiff.  Now 
that  which 
is  suggested  as

any  way  move 
from 
the 
plaintiff; 
it  moves 
from 
the"

"","not  a  mere  proviso  that  the  doneeshall  take  the  gift  with  theburthens;"

it 
is  an  express  agreement
