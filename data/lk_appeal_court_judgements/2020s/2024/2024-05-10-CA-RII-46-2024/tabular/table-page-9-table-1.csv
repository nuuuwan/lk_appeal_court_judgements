"alongside  other  authoritative  cases  that  have  helped  to  shape  the  doctrine  of"
"contract  formationwill  be  referred  to  here  briefly,  to  represent  certain  basic"
"principles of English law of simple contracts."
"Offer and Acceptance"
"The  bedrock  of  a  simple  contract  is  the  agreement,  which  is  typically  formed"
"through an offer by one party and its acceptance by another. The case of Carlill"
"v.  Carbolic  Smoke  Ball  Company  illuminates  this  principle  distinctly.  In  this"
"case, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company advertised that they would pay Â£100 to"
"anyone who contracted influenza after using their smoke ball according to the"
"instructions  provided.  Mrs.  Carlill  did  just  this  and  claimed  the  reward  after"
"contracting influenza. The Court of Appeal held that the advertisement was not"
"mere puffery but a unilateral offer to the world at large which was accepted by"
"Mrs. Carlill through her performance of the act."
