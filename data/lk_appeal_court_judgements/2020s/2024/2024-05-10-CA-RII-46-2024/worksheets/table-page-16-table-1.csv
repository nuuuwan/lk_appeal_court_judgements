"(2) That the words “ex gratia” in a promise to make a payment, although"
"indicating that pre-existing legal liability was notadmitted, did not carry"
"a necessary or even probable implication that the promise was intended"
"to  be  without 
legal  effect 
(post,  p.  356);  and,  there  beingno  special"
"circumstances whereby such an implication could be given to the words,"
"the  company  had 
failed 
to  establish 
that 
the  parties  affirmatively"
"intended  not  to  enter  into  legal  relations  in  respect  of  the  company’s"
"promise  to  pay 
(post,  p.357).  The  plaintiff  therefore  was  entitled  to"
"recover the contributions paid by the company to the fund for him.”"
