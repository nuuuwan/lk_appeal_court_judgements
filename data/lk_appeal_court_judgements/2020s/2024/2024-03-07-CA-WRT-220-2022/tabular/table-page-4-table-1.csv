"line  to  the  8th  Respondent’s  land  along  the  western  boundary  of  the  Petitioner's"
"property. Accordingly, the 1st Respondent has provided the 8th Respondent the cost"
"estimate for the supply of three-phase electricity supply to the 8th Respondent’s land"
"and the 8th Respondent had made the payment in respect of the said estimated cost"
"for the said electricity supply. Thereafter the 2nd Respondent had sent notices to the"
"Petitioner and the other residents who reside on either side of the roadway seeking"
"a  wayleave  for  a  33Kv  electricity  line  along  the  said  roadway.  The  Petitioner  had"
"objected to the laying of a 33Kv electricity line along the boundary of the Petitioner’s"
"residential  property.  Afterwards, 
the  2nd  Respondent  had 
requested 
the  3rd"
"Respondent  to  hold  an 
inquiry  and  had  sought  permission  to 
install  such  an"
"electricity  line.  Accordingly,  an  inquiry  had  been  held  by  the  Assistant  Divisional"
"Secretary  of  Kaduwela.  After  obtaining 
certain 
clarifications 
from 
the  2nd"
"Respondent  pursuant  to  said  inquiry,  the  3rd  Respondent  had  permitted  the  1st"
"Respondent to lay the 33Kv electricity line using the bundle system along the existing"
"electricity line by his letter dated 01.02.2019 marked P27. A copy of the said letter"
"P27 has also been forwarded to the Petitioner. The Petitioner states that she was"
"unable  to  foresee  the  impact  of  laying  the  electricity  line  due  to  the  ambiguous"
"wording of the said letter and due to her lack of knowledge on the technical aspects."
"At  the  time  said  electricity 
line  was 
laid  along  the  western  boundary  of  the"
"Petitioner’s property on 03.09.2019, the Petitioner had noticed that said electricity"
"line at the closest point is only 125cm and at the furthest point it is 165 cm away"
"from the Petitioner’s house. In terms of the height of the wires, it had been at the"
"level of the second floor of the house. Accordingly, the Petitioner had objected to"
"the laying of an electricity line on their property,  as it posed a serious danger to"
"residents and would decrease the property's market value. This objection had been"
"communicated to the 2nd Respondent via a letter dated 04.09.2019. However, as the"
"issue  persisted,  the  Petitioner  had  filed  a  case  bearing  no.  523/SPL  before  the"
"District Court of Kaduwela making the 1st to 3rd, 8th Respondents and the Attorney"
"General as parties. The Petitioner had been able to obtain an enjoining order and an"
"interim injunction to prevent any further action until the matter is resolved in the"
"said  case.  The  8th  Respondent 
instituted  the  action  bearing  no.  CARI/15/2019"
"seeking to revise the said orders made in the District Court action and CA Transfer"
"Application  bearing  no.  08/2019  seeking  to  have  transferred  the  said  case  to  a"
"different District Court. In the said application bearing no. CARI/15/2019, the Court"
