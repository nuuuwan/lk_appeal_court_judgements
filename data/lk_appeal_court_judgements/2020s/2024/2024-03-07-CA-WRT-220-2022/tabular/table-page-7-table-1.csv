"had  been  constructively 
taken 
into  consideration  by 
the  Assistant  Divisional"
"Secretary of Kaduwela who held the inquiry as evinced by his Report P22. Further,"

"constructing the proposed electrical line with distance limitation as provided under"
"the  Electricity  Act,  assessment  of  the  alternative  economical  electrical  supply"
"methods  (including  underground  supply  method)  and  the  cost  of  such  methods"
"before coming to a conclusion (See P23 and P24). It appears that the 3rd Respondent"
"has afforded a fair hearing and has taken into consideration the relevant facts and"
"circumstances in arriving at a conclusion. The decision of the 3rd Respondent to allow"
"construction  of 
the  electrical 
line  using 
the  bundle  cable  method  has  been"
"communicated to the 2nd Respondent by his letter dated 01.02.2019 (P27) with a"
"copy  to  the  Petitioner.  However,  the  Petitioner  had  not  objected  to  the  3rd"
"Respondent's  decision  regarding  the  laying  down  of  the  electrical  line  using  the"
"bundle  cable  method.  Hence  the  Petitioner  is  estopped  from  objecting  to  the"
"decision of the 3rd Respondent at a subsequent stage."
