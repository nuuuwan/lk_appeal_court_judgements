"In  light  of  the  above,  I  am  not  inclined  to  issue  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  against  the"
"decision  in  P27.  However,  I  take  the  view  that  the  decision  reflected  in  the  P27"
"should be executed in accordance with the Regulations in P40 especially in regards"
"to the distance. Thus, I proceed to issue a mandatory order directing the 1st and the"
"2nd Respondents to comply with the order in P27 but strictly abiding by the rules"
"relating  to  the  distance  in  Regulations  P40.  In  other  words,  the  1st  and  the  2nd"
"Respondents should install the said impugned electrical line while considering the"
"minimum distance from the outermost wall of the building without ignoring even"
"short walls jutting out such as in balconies. Subject to the above, I am not inclined"
"to issue any relief as prayed for in the prayer to the Petition."
