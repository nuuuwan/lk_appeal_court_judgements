"Further, Regulation No.40 specified that no overhead line shall so far as is reasonably"
"practicable, come so close to any building, tree or structure as to cause danger. The"
"said Regulations do not expressly make a difference between wire or cable lines. The"
"said Part 11 of Schedule 2 of P40 specifies the required minimum distance to be"
"maintained. The 2nd Respondent sought to way leave for 33,000 Volts electricity line."
"In the case of an electricity line in which the nominal voltage is between 11,000 Volts"
"to 33,000 Volts a minimum of 3.00 meters of vertical distance (minimum height) and"
"2.00 meters of horizontal distance (minimum width) is to be maintained from the"
"building as per Part 11 of Schedule 2 of P40. The vertical distance would not become"
"an issue in the instant application as the impugned electrical line is not constructed"
"over the Petitioner building."
