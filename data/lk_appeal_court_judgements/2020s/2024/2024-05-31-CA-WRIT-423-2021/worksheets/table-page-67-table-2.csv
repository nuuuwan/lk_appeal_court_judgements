"16.11.1959 are apt here:"
"“With the immense usefulness of the elephant to man and its capacity to be domesticated, we"
"consider that an endeavour should be made to breed elephants in captivity or in the semi-wild"
"state. Money, will of course, be needed for such a purpose, but as we consider it worthwhile we"
"recommend that a State-aided experiment be carried out and an elephant capturing-breeding-"
"and-training  centre  be established,  as  suggested by  the  Sub-Committee  referred  to  earlier.  We"
"would urge that very early steps be taken to ascertain the elephant population and its distribution;"
"also that their migratory routes be determined with a view to confirming the jungle corridors"
"necessary to enable them to pass from one Reserve to another, (as indicated in Appendix 2), or be"
"driven along them when their haunts are threatened by agricultural encirclement."
"We would also urge the banning of licences to individuals for the capturing of elephants for any"
"purpose. Until the Department of Wild Life is able 1to build up an organisation of expert elephant"
"trappers the capture of elephants should be entrusted to the Zoo working in conjunction with the"
"Department of Wild Life."
