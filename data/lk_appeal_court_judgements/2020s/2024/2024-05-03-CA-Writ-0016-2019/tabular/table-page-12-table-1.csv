"The  5th  Respondent  contends  that  as  a  bachelor,  he  resided  on  the  subject"
"premises  at  all  relevant  times,  maintaining,  improving,  and  cultivating  the"
"land at his own expense without objection from any party19. Furthermore, the"
"Petitioner does not assert that his mother, Anthony Amma, took possession of"
"the holding. The Petitioner merely argues that his mother  should have been"
"the legitimate successor to the land20."
"Therefore, the only logical conclusion that this Court could reach is that the"
"spouse of the deceased owner did not take possession of the property within"
"the six-month period following the owner's death. There is no material before"
"the Court indicating otherwise."
"In  the  case  of  Gunawardhane  and  another  v.  K.  A.  Rosalin21  (S.C.)  His"
"Lordship Basnayake C.J., held that upon the failure of the successor to enter"
"into possession within six months prescribed in the LDO, successorâ€™s rights"
"get wiped out."
"In  accordance  with  Section  72  of  the  LDO,  if  the  spouse  or  nominated"
"successor fails to succeed to the holding of an owner, it shall devolve as per"
"Rule 1 of the Third Schedule of the LDO. Pursuant to this, preference is given"
"to  the  sons,  with  the  eldest  son  taking  precedence  over  the  younger  ones."
"Therefore,  the  5th  Respondent,  being  the  eldest  son  of  the  deceased  owner"
"Joseph  Selliah,  should  receive  preference  over  the  younger  son,  Joseph"
"Santiago, the Petitioner."
"The Petitioner claimed that the 5th Respondent has unlawfully transferred the"
"land  allotted to him under a Grant, thereby breaching  specified  conditions."
"These conditions, as outlined in Grant 'P 2', which adheres to the prescribed"
"format,  stipulate  that  the  land,  or  any  part  thereof,  cannot  be  transferred"
"without prior written consent from the Divisional Secretary22."
"The Divisional Secretary acknowledged in his letter 'P 14' that the alienations"
"were given effect with his sanction. Additionally, the details of the approval"
"granted by the Divisional Secretary are explicitly mentioned on the deeds23"
"'P10' and 'P11'."
