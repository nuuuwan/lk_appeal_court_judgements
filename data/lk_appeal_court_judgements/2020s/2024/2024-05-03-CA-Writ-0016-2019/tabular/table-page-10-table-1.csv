"of this, he submitted an affidavit sworn by their father as 'P 23'. Nevertheless,"
"the affidavit does not specify which child was in India."
"The Petitioner contends that according to the LDO, upon their father's demise,"
"their mother should have rightfully succeeded as the legitimate successor, both"
"as the surviving spouse and as the nominee15. The Petitioner alleges that the"
"5th Respondent manipulated the process to acquire the land allocated under"
"the Grant 'P 2'/'1 R 2' and the land allocated under the annual Permit 'P 3'."
"However, the 5th to 10th and 13th Respondents argued that their mother was"
"nominated  as  the  successor  only  in  the  Permit  ('P  1'),  and  there  was  no"
"nomination specified in the subsequent Grant issued for the same land ('P 2'/'1"
"R  2'). They  assert  that  their  mother, Anthony Amma,  has  no  legal  right  or"
"entitlement to be considered as a successor in the subsequent grant. Therefore,"
"they argued that according to Section 72, read in conjunction with the Third"
"Schedule of the LDO, the title to the land allocated under the Grant should"
"devolve upon the 5th Respondent, who is the eldest son of the original owner,"
"Joseph Selliah."
"The  above  argument  presented  by  the  5th  to  10th  and  13th  respondents  is"
"untenable under existing law."
"In the case of Don Agosinno v. Divisional Secretary, Polonnaruwa and others"
"16(S.C.), Chief Justice S.N. Silva, with Justices Jayasinghe and Amaratunge"
"concurring, held that the transition from an initial holding under a Permit to a"
"subsequent Grant is a single process, not two distinct processes. Therefore,"
"the fact that the holder's interest is converted from a Permit to a grant does not"
"alter any nomination previously made by the holder to the relevant authority."
"Consequently,  any  nomination  of  a  successor  under  the  Permit  should  be"
"considered  as  transferred  to  the  Grant.  Justice  J.A.N.  de  Silva,  then  of  the"
"Court of Appeal,  in  the  case  of  Nanayakkara  v.  Jayasooriya  and another17"
"adopted the same perspective, emphasizing that the intention of the allottee"
"should  be honoured. Thus,  the  contention  raised  by  the  5th  to 10th  and  13th"
"respondents lacks merit in light of established legal precedent."
