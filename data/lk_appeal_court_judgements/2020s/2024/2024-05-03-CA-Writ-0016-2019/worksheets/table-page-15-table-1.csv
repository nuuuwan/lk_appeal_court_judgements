"to  appoint/acknowledge/validate the 5th  Respondent  as  the  successor to the"
"grant 'P 2'. Furthermore, in my view the 1st to 4th Respondents have lawfully"
"alienated the land initially assigned to the late Joseph Selliah through lease"
"agreements to the 5th and 7th to 10th Respondents. As a result, there are no valid"
"reasons to issue a writ of certiorari to annul the decision contained in 'P 20' to"
"lease the land to the 5th and 7th to 10th Respondents, nor is there justification"
"for  issuing  a  writ  of  mandamus  to  allocate  the  land  to  Joseph  Selliah's"
"surviving children through lease or other legal means."
"Based  on  the  analysis  presented  in  this  judgment,  there  is  no  grounds  for"
"issuing a writ of certiorari to annul 'P 13' and 'P 20' either."
"Since the Respondents consistently adhered to the law, there is no necessity"
"to issue a writ of mandamus directing the 1st to 4th Respondents to conduct a"
"fresh inquiry to ascertain entitlement to the land alienated under the permit."
"Therefore, granting alternative relief is also unwarranted."
"Above all, as I have already stated in this judgement, this application should"
"be dismissed solely on the basis of inordinate delay."
"Consequently, I hold that the Petitionerâ€™s application must fail. Accordingly,"
"the Writs sought in paragraphs (a) through (i) are thus rejected."
"Application is dismissed subject to a cost Rs 50000/-."
