"Respondent sought instructions from the Provincial Commissioner of Lands"
"through the aforementioned letter marked ('P 14'). Accordingly, by letter dated"
"16th January 2018 (‘P 15’) the Provincial Commissioner of Land advised the"
"1st Respondent that the succession under the LDO is not applicable to the lands"
"alienated  under  the  Crown  Lands  Ordinance.  However,  if  the  heirs  of  the"
"deceased Permit holder are in possession without any conflict, those claims"
"could  be  considered.  Further,  he  has  specifically  stated  that  since  the  5th"
"Respondent is granted the succession of the land alienated under the Grant (‘P"
"2’/’1 R 2’), it is unnecessary to grant another State land to him."
"Despite the aforementioned advice, at a meeting convened on the 17th May"
"2018,  attended  by 
the  Provincial  Commissioner  of  Land, 
the  Deputy"
"Commissioner  of  Land,  Additional  District  Secretary  (Lands),  and  the  1st"
"Respondent Divisional Secretary, it was determined that allocating the land"
"alienated  under  the  Grant  ('P  2'/'1  R  2')  to  the  5th  Respondent  is  lawful."
"However, it was decided that the land alienated under the Permit should be"
"divided and allocated to the individuals currently in possession of it."
"The  details  outlined  above  are  reflected  in  the  1st  Respondent  Divisional"
"Secretary’s letter dated 28th May 2018 ('P 19'). According to the minutes of the"
"meeting held on 17th May 2018, the officers constituting the panel of inquiry"
"decided  to  allocate  the  land  as  follows:  20  perches  each  to  Kandasamy"
"Thayalan,  Kandasamy  Tharshika, 
and  Thyageshwaran  Thushanthi 
for"
"residential  purposes,  and  another  40  perches  for  agricultural  use  to  Selliah"
"Fatima,  the  daughter  of  late  Joseph  Selliah.  Additionally,  20  perches  for"
"residence  and  60  perches  for  agricultural  purposes  were  allotted  to  the  5th"
"Respondent,  Selliah  Thevatheepan.  However,  no  portion  of  the  land  was"
"allocated  to  the  Petitioner,  Joseph  Santiago,  who  consequently  rejected  the"
"decision of the panel of inquiry26. As previously mentioned, the decision of"
"the  panel  of  inquiry  was  to  lease  the  land  to  individuals  who  were  in"
"possession at the time, in accordance with Circular No. 2014/02. Accordingly,"
"since the Petitioner was not in possession of the land, his claim was rejected."
"Conclusion"
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  it  is  my  considered  view,  that  the  1st  to  4th"
"Respondents have acted in accordance with the law when allocating the land"
"alienated to the late Joseph Selliah, to the 5th Respondent. Therefore, there are"
"no grounds to warrant the issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash the decision"
