"dying  declaration  made  by  a  deceased  without  corroborating  under"
"certain  circumstances. 
It  was  held 
further 
that 
it  would  not  be"
"repugnant or obnoxious to the law to convict an accused based solely"
"on a dying declaration. In Kumarasinghe Hettiarachchilage Gamini"
"Sarath  V.  The  Hon.  Attorney  General  –  C.A.  Case  No.  24/2015,"
"decided  on  22.03.2019, 
it  was  held  that  “A  dying  declaration  as"
"evidence can be acted upon without corroboration, if it is found to be"
"true  and 
reliable”. 
In  view  of 
the  aforesaid 
judicial  authorities,"
"Chandralatha’s  dying  declaration  can  be  acted  upon  even  without"
"corroboration as it can clearly be accepted as true and reliable. Hence,"
"it is evident from the said dying declaration that the appellant had shot"
"and murdered Chandralatha and her son Dinesh Prasanna."
"In 
the 
instant  case,  Chandralatha’s  dying  declaration  has  been"
"corroborated by the evidence of PW-4. On the other hand, no reasonable"
"doubt arises in respect of PW-4’s evidence regarding the identity of the"
"accused-appellant  because  her  identification  is  corroborated  by  the"
"dying declaration of Chandralatha. Therefore, it is established from the"
"prosecution  evidence  that  the  appellant  murdered  Chandralatha  and"
"her son Dinesh Prasanna."
"The next matter to be considered is whether the defence of alibi taken"
"up by the appellant has been properly considered by the learned Trial"
"Judge  and  whether 
the  alibi  creates  a  reasonable  doubt  on 
the"
"prosecution case. The position taken up in the alibi had been suggested"
"to  the  prosecution  witnesses  when  they  were  cross-examined.  The"
"defence of alibi taken up by the accused in making a statement from"
"the dock was that he was on official duty at Kotte Municipal Council at"
"that time. Furthermore, the appellant stated that the following day he"
"was  arrested  near  Welikada  Shed  by  a  police  officer  called  “Saman”."
"There was no any other evidence documentary or oral, to show that he"
"was working in the Kotte Municipal Council on that day apart from the"
"statement  made  by  the  accused-appellant  from  the  dock.  However,"
