"appellant.  The  accused-appellant  has  not  been  denied  a  fair  trial.  As"
"the unbelievable alibi and the dock statement do not cast a reasonable"
"doubt on the prosecution case as explained previously, I hold that the"
"evidence presented by the prosecution proves the two charges against"
"the accused-appellant beyond a reasonable doubt."
"Accordingly, the Judgment dated 03.06.2022, the convictions and the"
"death sentence imposed on the accused-appellant is affirmed."
"The appeal is dismissed."
