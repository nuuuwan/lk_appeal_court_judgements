"When the accused were charged before the learned Magistrate of Kuchchaveli,"
"they have pleaded guilty to all three counts preferred against them."
"Based  on  their  own  plea,  the  learned  Magistrate  has  sentenced  them,  and"
"thereafter, has decided to hold an inquiry in relation to the vehicle mentioned as"
"a production on the basis that the 1st and the 2nd count preferred against them"
"are counts under the Forest Ordinance and hence, the earlier mentioned vehicle"
"is subject to confiscation in terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance."
"At  the  inquiry  held  in  that  regard,  the  petitioner  who  had  been  the  absolute"
"owner of the vehicle has come forward and claimed the vehicle. It is clear from"
"the certificate of registration of the relevant motor vehicle produced in the Court"
"that,  the  1st  accused  charged  before  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court  had  been  the"
"registered owner of the vehicle, which explains the application by the absolute"
"owner, rather than the registered owner."
"After the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate of Kuchchaveli by the"
"order dated 23-08-2017 had decided to confiscate the vehicle on the basis that"
"the absolute owner has failed to establish the fact that he had meaningful control"
"over the vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence, and the owner of"
"the vehicle has failed to show that he took the necessary precautions to prevent"
"the offence being committed."
"Being dissatisfied by the said order, the appellant has preferred an application"
"in  revision  in  terms  of  Article  154P  of  The  Constitution  to  the  Provincial  High"
"Court of the Eastern Province Holden in Trincomalee."
"After  hearing  the  application,  the  learned  Provincial  High  Court  Judge  of  the"
"Eastern Province Holden in Trincomalee has dismissed the said application by"
"the  judgment  dated  15-10-2018,  on  the  basis  that  there  are  no  exceptional"
"circumstances for the Court to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate"
"of Kuchchaveli."
"It is against this judgment the appellant has preferred this appeal."
