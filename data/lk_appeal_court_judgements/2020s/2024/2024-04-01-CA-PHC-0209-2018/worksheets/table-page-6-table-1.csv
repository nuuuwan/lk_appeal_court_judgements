"At the hearing of this appeal, the position taken up by the learned Counsel for"
"the appellant was that this was not a charge or charges where section 40(1) of"
"the Forest Ordinance becomes applicable, and hence, the learned Magistrate has"
"ordered an inquiry in terms of the said section without a legal basis. Therefore,"
"the  order  of  the  learned  Magistrate  as  well  as  the  judgment  of  the  learned"
"Provincial High Court Judge has no validity before the law."
"His contention was that, to attract the provisions of section 40(1) of the Forest"
"Ordinance, there must be an allegation or a charge to the effect such tool, vehicle,"
"implement, cattle, or the machine was used in committing the offence mentioned"
"in the charge or charges."
"It was pointed out that though the vehicle in question has been mentioned as a"
"production before the Magistrateâ€™s Court case, no charge has been formulated"
"on  the  basis  that  the  said  vehicle  was  used  in  committing  any  offence.  The"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  moved  for  the  release  of  the  vehicle  on  the"
"basis that it had been confiscated not in accordance with the law."
"The 
learned  State  Counsel  who  represented 
the  complainant-respondent-"
"respondents was of the view that the charge need not explain the modus operandi"
"of  the  accused.  He  was  of  the  view  that  the 
learned  Magistrate  has  well"
"considered who can claim a vehicle under section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance"
"and  has  correctly  come  to  her  decision  after  analyzing  the  relevant 
legal"
"principles which needs no disturbance from this Court."
"He  contended  further  that  the  learned  Provincial  High  Court  Judge  has  also"
"considered  the  relevant  legal  provisions  in  his  judgment  and  had  come  to  a"
"correct  determination  when  it  was  decided  to  dismiss  the  revision  application"
"filed before the High Court. The learned State Counsel moved for the dismissal"
"of the appeal."
