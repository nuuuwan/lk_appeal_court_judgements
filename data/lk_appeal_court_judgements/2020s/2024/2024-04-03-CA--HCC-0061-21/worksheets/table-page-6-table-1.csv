"At  page  471  of  the  judgment  of  the  trial  judge  we  find  that  trial  judge  had"
"unduly and very shockingly had cast an undue responsibility on the appellant"
"to  prove  his  innocence  which  is  not  to  be  found  anywhere  in  the  history  of"
"criminal 
law  prevalent 
in  our  country.  Furthermore,  she  had  cast  undue"
"aspersions  on  the  appellant  for  failing  to  give  evidence  on  oath  and  opting  to"
"make a statement from the dock to which the appellant is  more  than  entitled"
"under the law prevalent in this country."
"But  we  observe  that  the  trial  judge  has  been  naive  to  these  principles  in"
"criminal law."
"Hence, we find that the trial judge had not only failed to consider the defense"
"but has shockingly failed to understand the basic rights of an accused person"
"enshrined in our Constitution."
"As  such,  we  find  that  the  appellant  has  been  denied  a  fair  trial  in  the  trial"
"court."
"Lastly,  the  counsel 
for  the  appellant  has  raised  that  the  trial 
judge  had"
"considered  the  Ellenborough  dictum  and  the  Lucas  principle  wrongly,  by"
"reading  the  judgment  and  by  reading  the  comments  of  the  trial  judge  with"
"regard to these two principles we find that she has grossly misunderstood the"
"said principles and has tried to apply them wrongly thereby causing a serious"
"miscarriage of justice to the appellant."
"As  such,  this  Court  finds  no  reasonable  ground  to  uphold  the  conviction  and"
"the sentence of the trial judge hence, we set aside both the conviction and the"
"sentence  of  the  trial  judge  and  acquit  the  appellant  and  allow  the  instant"
"appeal."
