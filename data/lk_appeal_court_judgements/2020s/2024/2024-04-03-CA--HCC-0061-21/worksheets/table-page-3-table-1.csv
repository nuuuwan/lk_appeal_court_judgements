"had  taken  place  for  about  two  hours  and  the  gang  had  been  covering  their"
"faces."
"But at one point she had said that one person was identified because his face"
"was not covered, but to police she had said that their faces were covered with"
"black cloths."
"Thereafter she had said that the appellant was identified because he had come"
"in the afternoon to collect a beetle leaf but in  evidence, she had said that she"
"had not seen him before."
"Furthermore,  in  evidence  she  had  said  that  she  identified  the  appellant  with"
"the  aid  of  a  torch  but  that  too  she  had  not  told  police  and  an  omission  had"
"been brought to the notice of Court."
"She  had  also  said  that  they  had  occupied  a  small  Cadjan  house  on  Pattie"
"mahattayas  land  and  his  son  was  a  frequent  visitor  to  their  house.  She  had"
"lodged the 1st complaint two days after the incident and she had said that the"
"victims had been very week and that they were taken to the hospital instead, of"
"going to the Police."
"But this Court observes that her evidence had not been very consistent and the"
"form of identification of the appellant appears to be very questionable."
"Thereafter,  the  prosecution  had  led  the  evidence  of  victim  number  2  and"
"witness number 2 namely  Lakmali  who had  corroborated  the mother but she"
"had  very  specifically  said  that  in  the  crowd  who  came  Pattie  Mahattayas  son"
"namely  Udayakumara  had  been  present  and  that  he  dragged  her  out  of  the"
"house and raped her."
"She  had  said  that  at  the  time  they  entered  the  house  she  had  identified  the"
"appellant and the Pattie mahattayaâ€™s son with the aid of the torch light held by"
"her  brother.  But  apparently,  she  had  not  said  the  same  to  the  police.  (165  of"
"the appeal brief)"
"She had further said that she identified the appellant when his face mask fell"
"off but the same, she had not told the police. (167 of the brief)"
"Later in evidence she had denied that the brother had carried a torch although"
"she had said at the beginning that the brother has had a torch and with the aid"
"of the same that she identified the appellant."
"But  to  Court  when  questioned  at  page  170  and  171  the  witness  had  very"
"clearly said that the appellant raping her, she could not say with certainty."
"But  she  speaks  to  the  presence  of  Udaya  kumara  and  he  dragging  her  away"
"and but the said Uadayakumara had been discharged by the Attorney General."
