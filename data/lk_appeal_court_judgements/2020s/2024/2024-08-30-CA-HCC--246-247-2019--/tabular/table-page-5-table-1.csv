"2nd June 2014, His Lordship Mohan Peiris, PC., CJ affirming the Court of"
"Appeal decision held further,"
"“We have taken into consideration the evidence of the brother, Ranjith who"
"implicates Renuka as a person who was concerned with the transaction."
"We are also dissatisfied with the manner in which the O.I.C. (7th Accused"
"Suraweera)  has  given  evidence.  This  Court  therefore  sees  no  reason  to"
"interfere with the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in ordering a re-trial in"
"respect of 1st ,2nd ,3rd and 4th Petitioners. We are however of the view that"
"the Court of Appeal should have gone further in this matter. The evidence"
"in this case materially touches the conduct of the O.I.C of Wattala Police"
"Station and Renuka. We are therefore of the view that in the presentation"
"of the new  indictment  at  the re-trial, consideration must be given by  the"
"Hon. Attorney General as to whether the O.I.C. of Wattala Police Station"
"Suraweera and the officer named Renuka ought to have made accused or"
"cited as witnesses, so as to ensure an effective prosecution.”"
