"“In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must"
"be  satisfied  that  the  evidence  was  consistent  with  the  guilt  of  the"
"accused  and 
inconsistent  with  any 
reasonable  hypothesis  of  his"
"innocence”."
"In Gunawardena v the Republic [1981] 2 SLR 315 the Court held that"
"“Each piece of circumstantial evidence is not a link in a chain for if one"
"link breaks the chain would fail. Circumstantial evidence is more like a"
"rope composed of several cords. One strand of rope may be insufficient"
"to  sustain 
the  weight  but 
three  stranded 
together  may  be  quite"
"sufficient.”"
"In Hanumant v State of M.P [1952] AIR SC 343; 1953 Cri LJ 129 the Court"

"on circumstantial evidence."
"“(i) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn"
"should  be  fully  established.  The  circumstances  concerned  must  or"
"should and not may be established;"
"(ii)  The 
facts  so  established  should  be  consistent  only  with 
the"
"hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, that should not be"
"explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty;"
"(iii) The circumstances should be conclusive;"
