"into account the evidence of the victim child, but by considering the evidence led"
"in the trial in its totality."
"The evidence clearly shows that the victim child was virtually living as an orphan"
"because her mother has passed away when she was young and her father has"
"become an invalid person due to a fall from a tree and a person which appears"
"to be addicted to liquor. The only person who has looked after her appears to be"
"her  grandmother.  Although  the  child  has  attended  school,  when  she  gave"
"evidence at the age of 22, it has been found that she was a person who could not"
"read or write, which shows that the level of care given towards her by her father"
"and the elders of the family, who should have cared for her."
"According to the evidence of the PW-04, who was one of the police officers who"
"conducted investigations into the matter, it was after receiving a 119 message"
"that a child is being repeatedly raped at a house, the  police have commenced"
"their investigations. After commencing the investigations, they have gone to the"
"house of the victim child on 20-05-2007, and had recorded the statement of the"
"grandmother of the child on 23-05-2007."
"In her evidence, PW-01 has stated that she made a statement to the police two"
"weeks after the incident. However, even at that stage, it has been clear that the"
"victim was not certain about the date of the offence. I find that it was under these"
"circumstances the date of offence has been stated as on or about 18-05-2007,"
"in  order  to  give  sufficient  notice  to  the  appellant  as  to  the  allegations  against"
"him."
"There is nothing to indicate that the appellant has been misled or prejudiced by"
"the victim childâ€™s inability to give an exact time or date of the incident, or a reason"
"to conclude that it has created a reasonable doubt as to the evidence of the victim"
"child."
