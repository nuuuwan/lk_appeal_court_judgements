"It  was  contended  that  the  evidence  of  the  victim  where  she  has  stated  at  one"
"point  that  the  appellant  had  intercrural  sex  with  her  and  at  another  point  he"
"inserted his penis into her vagina should have been considered in favour of the"
"appellant on the basis that the victim was not consistent in her evidence, but"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  it  otherwise,  in  favour  of  the"
"victimâ€™s version of events."
"I do not find any basis to consider the above submission as a weakness in the"
"analysis  of  evidence  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge.  The  judgment  clearly"
"provides that the learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the evidence"
"in its totality, and has considered all the relevant factors  to come to a finding"
"that the evidence of the victim was cogent enough for him to believe as truthful,"
"for which I find no reason to disagree. It is amply clear from the judgment that"
"the learned High Court Judge has well considered all the discrepancies alleged"
"in  relation  to  the  evidence  placed  before  the  Court,  and  has  come  to  his"
"determinations with sound reasoning."
"The defence taken up by the appellant has not created an iota of doubt as to the"
"evidence of the victim."
"For the completeness of this judgment, I would like to quote the Indian Supreme"
"Court  judgment  in  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh  Vs.  M.K  Anthoney  (1984)  S.C.J"
"236-1985 Cri. L.J. 493 at 498."
