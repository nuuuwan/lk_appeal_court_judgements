"The 2nd and 4th Defendants have signed the agreement under dispute as Agents"
"of the 1st  Defendant Company and not in their personal capacity.”"
"When they made  an  application before the same  Court, the  Learned  Commercial  High"
"Court Judge informed that, the said order dated 25.11.2019 does not clearly state the fact"
"that, the application to discharge the 2nd and 3rd Defendants has been rejected. Further,"
"he informed that, he lacks jurisdiction to clarify the said order and if they wish, they can"
"seek clarification by invoking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal."
"On  that  premises,  the  2nd  and  3rd  Defendant-Petitioners  have  invoked  the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction of this Court."
"We are mindful that, this is a revision application. Our Courts have considered that,  the"
"revisionary jurisdiction is exercised especially to prevent the miscarriage of justice being"
"done to a person."
"In  Kulatilake  v.  Attorney  General  2010  (1)  SLR  212  His  Lordship  Chitrasiri  J.  held;"
"“It is trite Law that the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court would be exercised if and"
"only if exceptional circumstances are in existence to file such an application. Moreover, it"
"must  be  noted  that  the  Courts  would  exercise  the  revisionary  jurisdiction,  it  being  an"
"extraordinary power  vested in Court,  especially  to  prevent miscarriage  of  justice  being"
"done to a person and/or for the due administration of justice.”"
