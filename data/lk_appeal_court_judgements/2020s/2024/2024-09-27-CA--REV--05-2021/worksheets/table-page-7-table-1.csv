"“The  purpose  of revisionary jurisdiction is  to promote  the  due  administration  of"
"justice and correct miscarriage of justice. But it is well to remember that unlike in"
"an appeal, not every error of fact or law may be corrected in revision. In short, the"
"general  ground  that  the  Judgment  is  incorrect, which is sufficient  to invoke  the"
"statutory right of appeal, does not per se constitute an exceptional ground to invoke"
"the extraordinary jurisdiction of revision. The error complained of shall shock the"
"conscience of the Court.”"
