"‘workmen’ includes a trade union consisting of workmen.”"
"Under Sections 3 and 11 of the said Act, the Commissioner of Labour is"
"empowered to investigate and/or conciliate any industrial disputes arising"
"between  the  employers  and  workmen.  In  the  instant  Application,  the"
"learned  President’s  Counsel  appearing  for  the  Petitioners  states  that  in"
"terms of Clause 7 of the Collective Agreement, between the CEB and the"
"Petitioners,  marked  as  P10,  any  and  all  matters 
concerning 
the"
"employment, employees should be actively made involved in discussions"
"and  should  be  heard  and  allowed 
to  put 
forward 
their  proposals,"
"comments,  feedback  and/or  suggestions  in  such  events.  However,  the"
"CEB,  instead  of  adhering  to  the  said  clause,  secretly  introduced  the"
"impugned  SORP 
(P4)  which  amounts  to  a  violation  of  the  Collective"
"Agreement by the CEB. The Industrial Disputes Act provides a mechanism"
"by which issues pertaining to a Collective Agreement could be resolved. It"
"is borne out from the affidavit tendered by the Petitioners that they have"
"already  invoked  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  in  this"
"regard and several discussions have been held by the Commissioner with"
"the  CEB  and  the  Petitioners.  In  fact,  the  matter  is  pending  before  the"
"Commissioner of Labour. In this scenario, I am of the view that since the"
"Petitioners  have  already  invoked  the  alternative  remedy  provided  in  law"
"and 
the 
same 
is  pending,  before 
the 
final  determination 
of 
the"
"Commissioner of Labour, the Petitioners are not entitled to invoke the Writ"
"jurisdiction of this Court. As such, the instant Application is liable to be"
"dismissed on this ground alone."
"Furthermore,  it  is  settled  law  that  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  compels  the"
"performance of a public duty, as distinct from enforcing a duty of a private"
"nature  such  as  a  contractual  obligation.  Such  duty  to  perform  that  act"
"must be contained in a statute and the applicant should have a legal right"
"to demand performance of such duty. In the case of Jayawardena Vs. The"
"People’s Bank7 the Court of Appeal enunciated that;"
"“There  is  a  distinction  between  public  duties  arising  from  statutes"
"which 
are 
enforceable 
by  mandamus 
and 
contractual  duties"
"enforceable  as  matters  of  private 
law  by  ordinary 
contractual"
