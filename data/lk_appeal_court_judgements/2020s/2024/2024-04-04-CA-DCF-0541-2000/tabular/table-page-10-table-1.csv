"evidence given against the plaintiff by Suvaris has a very scanty value. This"
"witness  never  stated  in  his  evidence  that  he  had  functioned  as  a  watcher"
"and  looked  after  the  land  on  behalf  of  the  3rd  defendant  as  claimed  by  the"
"company  director  Ranatunge.    Therefore,  the  Learned  Additional  District"
"Judge was correct in not accepting the evidence of Suvaris."
"T
he  Learned  Additional  District  Judge  concluded  that  Suvaris  and  the"
"surveyor  called  by  the  third  defendant  were  partial  witnesses.  After  seeing"
"and  hearing  the  witnesses  and  observing  their  demeanour,  the  Learned"
"Additional  District  Judge  reached  that  conclusion  and  we  see  no  reason  to"
"interfere with that finding."
"In  the  case  of  Alwis  v  Piyasena  Fernando  [1993]  1Sri  LR  119,  G.  P.  S.  de"
"Silva, C.J. stated that;"
"""it is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who hears"
"and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal""."
