"22)","I  draw  my  attention  to  page  No,  126  and  129.    The  Appellant  in"
"","this  case  had  stated  that  he  had  purchased  the  vehicle  from  the"
"","2nd Respondent on 3rd February 2011, while the incident pertinent"
"","to  the  charge  sheet,  had  occurred  on  28th  February  2011.    The"
"","forms  MT6  and  MT8  forms  had  been  tendered  to  the  Registrar  of"
"","Motor Vehicles on 15th March 2011."
"23)","On  the 
face  of 
it,  the  Appellant  and  the  2nd  Respondent  had"
"","collusively  acted  to  mislead  Court  by  stating  that  the  Appellant"
"","was  the  owner  of  the  said  vehicle  at  the  time  the  offence  was"
"","committed by the 2nd Respondent."
"24)","The 
Learned  Magistrate 
thoroughly 
considered 
this 
fact 
by"
"","providing a hearing to the Department of Motor Traffic officials and"
"","in reviewing the documents pertinent to registration."
"25)","Therefore,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  the  Learned  Magistrate"
"","had carefully considered the evidence and the documents pertinent"
"","to this action."
