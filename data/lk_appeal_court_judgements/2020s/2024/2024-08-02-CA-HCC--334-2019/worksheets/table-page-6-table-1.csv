"n  the  case  of  McGreevy  v.  Director  of  Public  Prosecution  [1973]  1"
"W.L.R.276 the court held that:"
"“There  is  no  requirement,  in  cases  in  which  the  prosecution’s  case  is"
"based on circumstantial evidence that the judge direct the jury to acquit"
"unless they are sure of the facts proved are not only consistent with guilt"
"but also inconsistent with any other reasonable conclusion. The question"
"for the jury is whether the facts as they find them to be drive them to"
"the conclusion, so that they are sure, that the defendant is guilty”."
