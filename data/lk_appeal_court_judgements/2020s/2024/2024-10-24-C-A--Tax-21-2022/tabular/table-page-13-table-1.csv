"Further, the position of the Respondent is that the dividend income from the subsidiaries"
"forms  the  major  part  of  its  income.  The  learned  DSG  appeared  for  the  Respondent"
"submitted  in  her  oral  submissions  that  82%-87%  of  the  income  of  the  Appellant"
"company derives from such dividend income and argued that if the dividend income is"
"exempted  from  tax,  only  a  minute  portion  of  the  total  income  would  be  liable  to"
"taxation. Therefore, such dividend income should be considered as business income in"
"terms of Section 3(a) of the Act. As reflected in the third question, the Appellant is a"
"holding company and not an investment company. Hence considering the main purpose"
"of  incorporating  the  company,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  dividend  income  does  not"
"constitute profits or income from its business under Section 3(a)."
"Furthermore,  this  Court  observes  that  the  dividend  income  can  be  recognized  as  a"
"separate  income  from  the  primary  income  of  the  Appellant.16  Therefore,  dividend"
"income should be recognized under Section 3(e) and not under Section 3(a) of the Act."
"In Kanagasabhapathi vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue17, it was observed"
"that “in tax cases, it is always necessary to remind oneself that when it is sought to"
"impose a tax on the subject, the burden is always on the revenue authorities to prove"
"that tax is exigible.”. The CGIR has failed to demonstrate that the dividend and interest"
"earned by  the Appellant company has  derived  from  the source of profit  and income"
"defined in Section 3(a) of the Act."
