"Based on the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Commissioner General of"
"Inland Revenue and the TAC have erred in law in failing to recognize that the Appellant"
"company functions as a Holding Company as opposed to an Investment Company. I"
"answer the third question of law in the affirmative and in favour of the Appellant."
"Question of Law IV"
"Were  the  interests  earned  by  the  Appellant  in  the  first  instance,  liable  to  be"
"considered as “income” within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of"
"2006, and not within Section 3(a) of the said Act?"
"Question of Law VI"
"Were  the  dividends  earned  by  the  Appellant  in  the  first  instance,  liable  to  be"
"considered as “income” within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of"
"2006, and not within Section 3(a) of the said Act?"
"The Court will address the fourth and sixth questions of law together as follows."
"The Respondent submitted that the dividend and interest income is the principal source"
"of income of the Appellant and therefore it should be treated as business income of the"
"company in  terms  of Section 3(a) of the  Act. However, this Court  observes that the"
"objective of incorporation of the Appellant company is to engage in business in real"
"estate and property development, management of an investment portfolio and provision"
"of management services, which does not include investment in shares and dividends as"
"a form of business activity."
