"In the instant case the TAC in its determination has observed that, “since the Appellant"
"has formulated the grounds of appeal, it indicates that the Appellant has understood"
"under what reasons the Assistant Commissioner has rejected the returns of income. In"
"this matter, we see that no prejudice has been caused as the Appellant had appealed to"
"the Respondent for the said decision of the Assistant Commissioner. If the Appellant"
"did  not  get  proper  reasons  explaining  the  refusal  of  the  income  tax  return  by  the"
"Assistant Commissioner, they would not be able to make a valid appeal.”"
"In the letter of intimation, by quoting the Memorandum of Association and Auditors"
"Report, the Assistant Commissioner has clearly stated that the reason for not accepting"
"the tax return is that the Appellant is engaged in the business of investing shares of the"
"companies and such dividend and interest income should be treated as a part of trading"
"profit under Section 3(a) and not as a separate source of income."
"Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that an adequate reason has been given by the"
"Assistant Commissioner in the letter of intimation enabling the Appellant to prefer an"
"appeal to the Commissioner. Thus, this Court answered the second question of law in"
"the negative in favour of the Respondent."
"Question of Law III"
"Did the Assessor, the Commissioner-General, and the Tax Appeals Commission,"
"err  in  law  in  failing  to  recognize  that  the  Appellant  functioned  as  a  Holding"
"Company as opposed to an Investment Company?"
