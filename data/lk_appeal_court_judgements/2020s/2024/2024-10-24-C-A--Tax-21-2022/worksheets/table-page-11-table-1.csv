"but  rather  was  holding  the  shares  for  long  durations  which  resulted  in  receiving"
"dividend income over a period of time."
"In the case of CEI Plastics Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue14, the"
"criteria followed was that,"
"“There had been repetitive shareholding transactions which had been carried on"
"systematically in an organized manner. These facts in my view establish that the"
"share trading activity referred to by the Appellant constituted a “business” within"
"the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Act.”"
"This  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  there  had  not  been  such  repetitive  transactions  on"
"investment in shares, hence that does not constitute a “business”  in terms of Section"
"3(a) of the Act. Even though there has been a repetitive receipt of dividend income over"
"time,  since  such  income  is  not  generated  by  the  principal  business  activity  of  the"
"Appellant, it should not be considered taxable income under Section 3(a). Furthermore,"
"this  Court  observes  that  the  Appellant  company  has  been  controlling  the  subsidiary"
"companies  through  shareholding  and  the  Appellant  has  held  more  than  50%  of  the"
"shares of the companies directly or indirectly as a group of companies.15 Therefore, it"
"is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  Appellant  company  is  functioning  as  a  holding"
"company rather than an investment company."
