"her  signature  on  the  assessment  sheet  dated  30.09.2015  and  by  issuing  the  letter  of"
"intimation communicating the reasons for such assessment."
"Considering the above-stated facts and circumstances this Court is of the opinion that"
"the Assessor who assesses and communicates the reasons for such assessment need not"
"be  the  same  person  who  issues  the  Notice  of  Assessment  and  therefore,  this  Court"
"answer the first question of law in the negative and favour of the Respondent."
"Question of Law II"
"Is the Assessment, (and the determination of the Commissioner General, and the"
"determination  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  pursuant  to  same)  liable  to  be"
"quashed and / or annulled inasmuch as the Assessor failed to duly provide reasons"
"for the Assessment as required by Section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No."
"10 of 2006 (as amended)?"
"It  is  the  argument  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  that,  instead  of  giving"
"reasons the Assistant Commissioner in the letter of intimation has given conclusions."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  contends  that  the  reasons  given  by  the"
"Assistant  Commissioner  are  sufficient  for  the  Appellant  to  prefer  an  appeal.  The"
"Respondent relied on the case of Mrs E D Gunaratne vs. Jayawardena and others12"
"where it was held that a clue is given as to where the taxpayer had gone wrong in his"
"return and the reason given is adequate and intelligible to enable him to formulate his"
"grounds to appeal to the Commissioner."
