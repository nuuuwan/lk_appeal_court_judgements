"The 3rd appellant had more or less has corroborated the 1st appellant and he had"
"said that he had gone on the 15th on the calling of the 2nd accused and he had"
"seen the deceased bringing a pestle and trying to assault the 2nd accused and"
"the  2nd  accused  had  told  the  3rd  appellant  to  stay  away  and  he  had  been"
"struggling with the deceased."
"He had seen the deceased fallen and he had seen the 1st appellant then fleeing"
"from the scene on the motor-bicycle and he also had tried to alight the motor-"
"bicycle but had failed and at that point the 2nd accused had started the van of"
"the deceased which had been parked outside and he also had alighted the van"
"and both had fled , and on the way the 2nd accused had thrown the blood stained"
"pestle and he had been dropped off at his residence by the 2nd appellant and he"
"had on next day had with the consent of the parents surrendered to police."
"Hence on analyzing the evidence above, it is an undisputed by both parties that"
"on the 14th and the 15th  of December the appellants and the 2nd  accused had"
"gone to the house of the deceased."
"It is also undisputed that the deceased died on the 15th at his residence in the"
"presence of the appellants and the 2nd accused."
"The  prosecution  who  alleges  that  the  appellants  along  with  the  2nd  accused"
"committed the death of the deceased and the robbery of the motor bicycle of the"
"deceased allege that the appellants along with the 2nd accused shared a common"
"intention to kill the deceased and rob the motor-bicycle of the deceased."
"But the prosecution has rested its case entirely on circumstantial evidence, and"
"if that is so it is a  well-established principle in the law of evidence that if a case"
"is  to  be  proved  on  circumstantial  evidence  the  circumstances  must  draw  the"
"irresistible inference that it was the accuses and no one else who committed the"
"said  offences.  If  the charges  have  been preferred  based  on common  intention,"
"then the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that all accused"
"shared a common intention and the presence of the accused at the scene should"
"not be only a mere presence but a participatory one."
"At  this  point,  we  draw  our  attention  to  the  case  of  Mapalagama  Acharige"
"Ariyaratne vs The Attorney General SC 31-1992 it has been held that “it is"
"settled law that the inference of a common intention must be not merely a"
"possible inference but a necessary inference that is to say an inference from"
"which there is no escape”."
"In the instant case the evidence against the 1st and the 3rd appellants are"
"that as placed by the prosecution are as follows,"
