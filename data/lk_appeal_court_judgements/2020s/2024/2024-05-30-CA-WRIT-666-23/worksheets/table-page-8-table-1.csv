"As far as this case is concerned, it is quite obvious that the 1st  and 2nd respondents,"
"being  Directors  of  Nalin  Enterprises  (Pvt)  Ltd.;  benefited  from  the  facilities  made"
"available to the said company by the petitioner Bank, and to that extent they cannot claim"
"that the mortgages which secured the said facilities fall within the category of ""third party"
"mortgage"" as contemplated in the  majority  judgments of this Court in ""Ramachandra v"
"Hatton National Bank (supra)."
"The  1st  and  2nd  plaintiff  are  integrated  to  Nalin  Enterprises   and  when  Nalin"
"Enterprises sought to obtain facilities from the petitioner Bank the borrowers are in fact"
"the said Nalin Enterprises along with the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs. It would be an exercise"
"totally illogical to seek to differentiate the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs as third party mortgagers"
"within the meaning of Ramachandra v Hatton National Bank (supra).”"
"Amarasekara J in Sunpac Engineers (Pvt) Ltd and another v DFCC Bank and other [ SC"
"Appeal 11/2021 (Supra) at Page 114 held that:"
"“This, the 2nd question of law has to be answered stating that any director of a corporate"
"entity who mortgage his property for a loan obtained by the corporate entity is a borrower"
"within the meaning of Act No. 4 of 1990.”"
