"Since  the  Petitioner  is  a  Director  and  Chairman  of  the  4th  Respondent  he  will  be  a"
"burrower within the meaning of Act No. 4 of 1990."
"Be that as it may, the question has to be considered is whether the property mortgaged"
"by the Petitioner who is the Chairman and what steps has he taken to settle the loan."
"Even after he received the Letter of Demand he has not taken steps to settle the loan."
"According to the section 10 of the said act there is a provision available to stay the auction."
"Section 10"
"(1) If the amount of the whole of the unpaid portion of the loan, together with interest"
"payable and of the moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by the Board under section 13 is"
"tendered to the Board at any time before the date fixed for the sale, the property shall not"
"be sold, and no further steps shall be taken in pursuance of the resolution under section"
"4 for the sale of that property."
"(2) If the amount of the instalment in respect of which default has been made, and of the"
"moneys  and  costs,  if  any,  recoverable  by  the  Board  under section  13 is tendered  to the"
"Board at any time before the date fixed for the sale, the Board may in its discretion direct"
"that the property shall not be sold and that no further steps shall be taken in pursuance"
"of the substitution under section 4 for the sale of that property."
"But the Petitioner has failed to take any steps to prevent the sale. There is no material to"
"be found to establish that the Petitioner has paid at least the unpaid instalment up to the"
"time this action was filed. This section was referred by Chitrasiri J in DFCC Bank (PLC)"
"v.  Fathima  Ruzana  Fakurdeen  and  others.,  SC  Appeal  No.  133/2014,  decided  on"
"24.03.2016,"
"“Sub section (1) above provides for the borrower to prevent the auction being held provided"
"he/she tenders to the Board unpaid portion of the loan together with interest and the costs"
"incurred thereto. Sub section (2) allows the borrower to pay the installment in respect of"
"which default has been made with the moneys and costs recoverable by the Bank and then"
"to request the Board to halt the auctioning of the property mortgaged using its discretion"
"referred to therein. Therefore, it is clear that the borrower should have paid the unpaid"
"instalments  if  he/she  has  not  paid  the  entire  unpaid  amount,  in  order  to  move  under"
"Section 10 of the Act No.4 of 1990.”"
