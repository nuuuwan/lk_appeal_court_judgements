"In view of the above statutory provisions, I find no basis for the learned Counsel’s"
"contention that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration"
"to the appellant’s defence taken up at the trial on the basis of exercising the right"
"of private defence."
"On the contrary, I find that the learned High Court Judge was very much mindful"
"of the legal requirements that should be established if the appellant is to succeed"
"in  his  defence.  With  that  in  mind,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well"
"considered the evidence placed before the Court by the prosecution, as well as"
"the dock statement and the evidence given on behalf of the appellant when he"
"was called upon for a defence."
"The  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  clearly  suggests  that  this  was  a  dispute"
"that arose as a result of the deceased and his son collecting compost fertilizer"
"near  the  common  boundary  between  the  houses  of  the  deceased  and  the"
"appellant. It is clear that due to the dispute, inmates of the appellant’s house"
"have come and protested against the actions of the deceased and his son, which"
"has resulted in a brawl."
"The appellant’s position had been that when he heard the commotion, he came"
"to the place of the incident and saw his sister being attacked by the  deceased"
"using a mamoty. He has claimed in his dock statement that it was the wife of the"
"deceased who carried a kathy knife. His position had been that he was forced to"
"attack the deceased in order to rescue her when the deceased attempted to attack"
"his sister for the 2nd time."
"On  behalf  of  the  appellant,  his  sister  who  has  also  sustained  injuries  in  the"
"incident has given evidence. According to her version of events, it was she who"
"had  brought  the  kathy  knife.  She  has  claimed  that  when  the  deceased  was"
"attempting to attack her with the mamoty, she swung the kathy knife she had"
"in order to escape him, which appears to be a suggestion of claiming that the"
"injuries caused to the deceased may have been a result of her actions."
