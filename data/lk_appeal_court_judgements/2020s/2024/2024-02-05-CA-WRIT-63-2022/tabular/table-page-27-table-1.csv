"D)  The  hospital  is  a  Teaching  Hospital  which  necessarily  requires  the  more  experienced  Acting"
"Consultants as medical students/interns attend these hospitals for training and experience."
"E)  The hospital does not have a second Medical Officer who has expertise in that field which means"
"the sudden departure of the Medical Officer ted there disrupt the services of that facility."
"Further, the learned DSG argues that it would not make sense to send a mere Senior Registrar"
"to respective hospitals for reasons similar to the above as;"
"a)  A Senior Registrar does not have the experience and capability to handle the challenges"
"of such hospitals"
"b)  As Senior Registrars have to travel abroad to complete their foreign training, there could"
"be a situation where these stations fall vacant once again within a short period of time."
"Thus, there would be no continuity of service in these areas."
"Thus,  it  is  observed  that  filling  the  vacancies  through  the  Replacement  List  is  meant  to"
"maintain service continuity at respective hospitals until such vacancies are permanently filled"
"through the Annual Transfers during the ensuing year. The Respondents have highlighted the"
"requirement of filling such vacancies among Officers very much similar to Specialists who"
"have returned to the Country after completing foreign training."
"As it appears to me, the Petitioners as well as the Respondents concede that there are three"
"categories of Medical Officers as mentioned below:"
"(1) Category ‘A’ - The Officers who have returned after foreign training and possess the"
"Board Certification."
"(2) Category ‘B’ - The Officers who have returned after foreign training but are awaiting"
"Board Certification."
"(3) Category ‘C’ - The Officers who have completed all the basic examinations and are"
"awaiting to travel abroad for foreign training (it is noted that they usually stay for a"
"short period and leave the Country  for foreign training at their earliest)"
"Out of the above three categories, the Officers who fall under the categories ‘A’ and ‘B’ remain"
"in a station/post until the Annual Transfer takes place for the following year. The contention"
"of  the  Respondents  is  that  the  Officers  in  the  above  categories  ‘A’  and  ‘B’  are  assigned  to"
"several posts that have become vacant and which cannot be filled until the Annual Transfers"
