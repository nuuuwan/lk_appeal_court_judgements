"Moreover,  this  Court  is  compelled  to  take  cognizance  of  the  fact  that  the  learned  DSG"
"represents  the  Committee  of  the  PSC  which  does  not  raise  any  objections  against  the"
"impugned Replacement List. In other words, the Attorney General in the instant Application"
"amplifies the version of the said Committee of the PSC. It is paramount to note that the said"
"Committee  by  way  of  a  letter  dated  13.07.2018  ('R4')  has  informed  the  Secretary  of  the"
"Ministry of Health that there is no necessity to obtain approval from the said Committee in"
"reference to the Replacement List. I am mindful that, this Court is not competent to inquire"
"into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call into question any order or decision made by"
"the PSC or the said Committee under Article 61A of the Constitution."
"In addition to the above, I am unable to make a sufficient assessment of the present  status"
"relating to each Officer from among the above-named 55 Petitioners. It can be easily assumed"
"that  some  of  the  Petitioners  have  already  left  the  Country  for  foreign  training  or  assumed"
"duties of higher Grades. The impugned Replacement List marked ‘P7’ and ‘P9’ were to be"
"effective  for  the  year  2022.  This  Court  on  12.01.2023  has  decided  that  the  Interim  Order"
"issued on 09.03.2022 has no impediment for the Ministry of Health to advertise the Annual"
"Transfers  of  Specialist  Medical  Officers  and  to  proceed  accordingly  based  on  the  criteria"
"adopted for the year 2022. Further, this Court has taken the expressed view that the Interim"
"Order issued in this case will have no impediment for the Director General of Health Services"
"to give effect to any transfers which in his opinion fall within the category of exigencies of"
"services. Both the above orders have not been challenged by the Petitioners up to date."
"Since  this  Court  suspended  the  impugned  Replacement  List  ‘P7’  and  ‘P9’  until  the  final"
"determination of this Case, I take the view that no prejudice can be caused to the Petitioners"
"in reference to the Annual Transfers which may have been effected for the year 2023. Thus, I"
"am reasonably compelled to assume that the interest of several Petitioners upon the instant"
"Application  have  now  substantially  changed.  This  is  because  some  of  the  Petitioners  may"
"have applied for Annual Transfers for the year 2023 or some of the Petitioners would have by"
"now become eligible even for the Annual Transfers for the year 2024. Therefore, a reasonable"
"question arises as to whether it is a futile exercise for this Court to review impugned decisions"
"contained in the said ‘P7’ and ‘P9’. Nevertheless, I am of the view that there is no necessity"
