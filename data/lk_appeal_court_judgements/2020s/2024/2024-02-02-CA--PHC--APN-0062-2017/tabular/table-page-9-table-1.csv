"For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the said section 24, which reads thus;"
"24. A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal"
"proceeding  if  the  making  of  the  confession  appears  to  the  court  to"
"have  been  caused  by  any  inducement,  threat,  or  promise  having"
"reference to the charge against the accused person, proceedings from"
"a  person  in  authority,  or  proceeding  from  another  person  in  the"
"presence of a person in authority and with his sanction, and which"
"inducement, threat or promise is sufficient in the opinion of the court"
"to  give  the  accused  person  grounds,  which  would  appear  to  him"
"reasonable,  for  supposing  that  by  making  if  he  would  gain  any"
"advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the"
"proceedings against him."
