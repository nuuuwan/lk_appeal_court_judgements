"punishable in terms of the section 5 of the said Act."
"The alleged offence is said to have been committed between the period of 01-05-"
"2004 and 30-04-2005."
"Ironically,  a  second  indictment  bearing  No.  5495/2011  has  also  been  filed"
"against the petitioner based on the same transaction for aiding the mentioned"
"person to get the mentioned goods released, an offence punishable in terms of"
"section 2(2)(11) of the PTA, for which I am unable to understand the rationale"
"behind  filing two separate indictments on the same matter."
"It appears that the parties have consented before the trial Court for the taking"

"At  the  commencement  of  the  trial,  the  indictment  has  been  read  over  to  the"
"petitioner in Tamil language since the petitioner has informed the Court that he"
"is  not  conversant  in  the  Sinhala  language  and  the  petitioner  has  pleaded  not"
"guilty. However, when the first prosecution witness was called to give evidence,"
"it  has  been  agreed  that  he  needs  no  interpretation  of  the  evidence,  which"
"indicates that the petitioner is a person who understands the language of the"
"Court, although he may not be fully conversant of the Sinhala language."
"When  PW-04,  retired  Superintendent  of  Police  Nimal  Ratnayake  was  giving"

"allegedly made by the petitioner to him in terms of section 16 of the PTA  while"
"under police detention as P-06."
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel who represented the petitioner  before the trial"
"Court has objected to the said marking of the statement as evidence on the basis"
"that  the  alleged  statement  was  not  a  statement  made  voluntarily  by  the"
"petitioner."
