"It has been his position that any conversation he had with the PW-04, was in the"

"he could not read, or write. He has stated that he was never asked to write down"
"his statement in the language he preferred."
"The petitioner had been subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution and"
"it appears that the line of the cross-examination had been on the premise that"
"the  petitioner  was  well  conversant  in  Sinhala,  and,  hence,  he  agreed  to  the"
"statement being recorded in Sinhala. It has also been suggested to him that the"
"due process was followed before his statement was recorded."
"Before considering the evidence led at the inquiry in order to come to a finding"
"whether the learned High Court Judge has reached a correct determination as"
"to the voluntariness of the statement alleged to have been made to PW-04 by the"
"petitioner,  I  think  it  is  appropriate  to  draw  my  attention  to  the  relevant  legal"
"provisions in that regard."
"Subjected 
to 
the  exceptions  as  provided  by 
the  Evidence  Ordinance,  no"

"any offence. (Section 25(1) of the Evidence Ordinance)"
"However,  PTA  provides  for  the  receiving  of  such  a  confessional  statement  as"
"evidence at a trial against the maker of such a statement. In terms of section 16"
"of the PTA,  such a  statement made by a suspect while in police custody, to a"
"person who holds a rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police or above, can"
"be accepted as evidence against such person or any other person charged jointly,"
"if  the  statement 
is  not 
irrelevant 
in  terms  of  section  24  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance."
