"“Revision  is  a  discretionary  remedy  and  will  not  be  available  unless  the"
"application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the Court.”"
"In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365, it"
"was observed,"
"“Revisionary  powers  should  be  exercised  where  a  miscarriage  of  justice  has"
"occasioned  due  to  a  fundamental  rule  of  procedure  being  violated,  but  only"
"when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.”"
"I  am  of  the  view  that  this  is  a  case  where  the  PW-04  has  violated  several"
"fundamental rules of procedure, which has occasioned a positive miscarriage of"
"justice towards the petitioner."
"For the reasons considered above, I hold that there was no legally tenable basis"
"for the learned High Court Judge to determine that the statement intended to be"
"marked as evidence by the prosecution in terms of section 16 of the PTA can be"
"admitted as evidence in the case."
"Accordingly, I allow the revision application by the petitioner and set aside the"
"order dated 20-03-2017 of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo, where the"
"statements sought to be marked as P-06 was allowed to be admitted as evidence"
"and reject the said application of the prosecution."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the High"
"Court of Colombo for necessary action."
