"However, the learned High Court Judge, rather than looking at that probability"
"factor in favour of the appellant, has decided that in favour of the prosecution"
"by coming into various surmises and conjectures. It was his view that there was"
"no basis for the learned High Court Judge to come to such findings based on the"
"evidence led in this trial."
"He  submitted  that,  even  the  police  evidence  as  to  the  observation  made  in"
"relation to the place of the incident has established the fact that an incident of"
"this nature cannot happen without any visible injuries to a victim."
"It is correct to say that the victim child has received no injuries as established"
"by the medical evidence. The doctor has clearly opined an incident of this nature"
"can happen without visible injuries or marks. It is an admitted fact that the land"
"on  which  this  incident  has  occurred  is  a  land  with  a  rocky  terrain  and  a"
"cinnamon  growth.  The  police  officer  who  recorded  his  observations  as  to  the"
"place of the crime has observed fallen cinnamon leaves in the place shown as"
"the place where the incident occurred."
"As  pointed  out  correctly  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG),  the"
"evidence of the victim child had been that the appellant carried her to the place"
"of the sexual assault and made her to  lie down, removed her panty, lifted the"
"school uniform she was wearing and committed this sexual abuse act on her."
"This clearly establishes the fact that although it may be a rough surface, it was"
"a surface laid with dead leaves. The evidence also shows that the assailant could"
"not complete his intended sexual assault in full. He has bolted from the place"
"after hearing the mother of the victim."
"The  victim  childâ€™s  evidence  had  been  that  the  appellant  managed  to  place  his"
"penis on her vagina only once, and ran away upon hearing her mother calling"
"her.  This  establishes  the  fact  that  although  the  victim  child  has  stated  she"
"struggled to escape from him after she was laid down on the ground, the actions"
"of the appellant had taken place during a time period of may be few seconds."
