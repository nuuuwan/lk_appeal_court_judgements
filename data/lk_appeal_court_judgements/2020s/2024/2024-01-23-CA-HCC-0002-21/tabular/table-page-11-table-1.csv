"Considering  the  harrowing  experience  as  narrated  by  PW-01,  her  ability  to"
"narrate everything what happened after more than 4 years cannot be expected"
"as of a photographic memory."
"On  the  other  hand,  it  can  be  safely  assumed  that  PW-02,  the  mother  of  the"
"victim, being a much elderly person who may have a better capacity to narrate"
"what she was told by her daughter, was telling the truth in that regard in her"
"evidence.  That  may  be  the  very  reason  why  she  has  observed  some  whitish"
"matter when she examined her child."
"Another matter which has drawn the attention of the learned High Court Judge"
"and contended during the hearing of this appeal was the timeline given by the"
"two witnesses namely the victim child and her mother as to when this incident"
"took place."
"The girl has given clear evidence to state that after she went to the school, she"
"was  taken  to  a  funeral  house  of  a  relative  of  a  staff  member  by  the  school"
"authorities, and on their return, the children were allowed to go home. She has"
"returned home along with another elderly student who lives near their house."
"When she returned home, her parents and other siblings were not at home. She"
"has assumed that her younger sister may have gone to have a bath with their"
"mother."
"According to the evidence of the mother, it was her habit to return home before"
"her  child  comes  home  for  the  day  after  school  around  2.00  –  2.30  p.m.  The"
"mother says that, on this particular day, she received a call from her younger"
"daughter’s  kindergarten  teacher,  informing  her  the  necessity  to  attend  the"
"funeral of a relative of a staff member. Her evidence clearly provides that she has"
"returned home earlier than usual with the intention of attending the said funeral."
"She has seen her daughter’s shoes and the bag in front of their house, which"
"clearly indicates that the daughter has come home earlier than usual, which has"
"prompted her to call for her."
