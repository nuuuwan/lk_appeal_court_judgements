"From  there,  the  child  has  been  taken  to  Embilipitiya  hospital  where  the  child"
"and the mother had made statements to the police in relation to the incident."
"In giving evidence, the child had admitted her birth certificate marked as P-1."
"The  panty  and  the  uniform  worn  by  her  has  been  marked  as  P-2  and  P-3"
"respectively."
"The  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (JMO)  who  examined  the  child  after  she  was"
"admitted to the hospital has not observed any injuries on her body. However, he"
"has opined, based on the history given by the child, that such an incident cannot"
"be overruled. He has also stated that in a situation where the child is laid on a"
"rough surface, there can be abrasions on pressure points of the body if the child"
"attempted to escape or resisted such an incident."
"It needs to be noted that the history given by the victim child to the doctor was"
"consistent with the child’s evidence as to what happened to her. The police officer"
"who conducted the site inspection as to the place of the incident too has given"
"evidence in this matter and had confirmed the geography of the area as stated"
"by the witnesses."
"At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence and when the appellant was called"
"upon for a defence, he has given evidence under oath. He has claimed that he"
"has  nothing  to  do  with  this  incident  and  police  arrested  him  on  the  28th  and"
"assaulted him."
"He  has  been  subjected  to  lengthy  cross-examination  by  the  prosecution.  A"
"contradiction in his evidence in the statement he made to the police in relation"
"to his whereabouts on the day of the incident has been marked as X-1 by the"
"prosecution."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  her  judgement  has  considered  whether  the"
"evidence of the victim child can be believed and whether her and her mother’s"
"evidence corroborates each other."
