"The 3rd ground of appeal is that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected"
"when it was stated that the history given by the child to the doctor when she was"
"examined has corroborated the evidence as to the incident."
"It  is  trite  law  that  the  history  given  in  a  Medico-Legal  Report  can  only  be"
"considered in relation to the consistency of the evidence of a witness."
"It needs to be noted that in a Medico-Legal Report that a doctor or a JMO should"
"submit to the Court, a separate space has been provided to mention the history"
"given by a patient. Taking down such a history becomes necessary for a doctor"
"to express an opinion in relation to his observations of a given situation. I am of"
"the  view  that  the  history  given  by  a  patient  to  a  doctor  becomes  relevant  in  a"
"criminal trial only to establish that the relevant witness has been consistent with"
"regard to the stand as to what occurred in a given situation."
"I am of the view that although the learned High Court Judge has used a wrong"
"word  in  the  judgement  to  indicate  that  the  history  given  to  the  doctor  further"
"corroborates the evidence of the victim child, I do not find any reason to accept"
"that misdirection has caused any prejudice towards the appellant."
"I am of the view that even if considered in its correct perspective, there would"
"not  be  any  difference  as  to  the  final  determination  of  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge as there was ample evidence to prove the charges against the appellant"
"beyond reasonable doubt."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the defence taken"
"up by the appellant and has rejected it with sound reasoning. I do not find any"
"basis to conclude that there was any matter that could have been considered in"
"favour of the appellant in relation to the evidence presented before the Court."
"The learned High Court Judge has considered all the evidence in its totality and"
"has come to a correct finding that the prosecution has proved the case beyond"
"reasonable doubt against the appellant."
