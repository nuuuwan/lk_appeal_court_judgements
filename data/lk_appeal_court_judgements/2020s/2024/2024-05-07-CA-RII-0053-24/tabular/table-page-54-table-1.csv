"","partial  restitution  absence  and  error,  and  further,  all  such  equitable"
"","reasons as rendered it unjust that the act should remain in existence."
"(vii)","In  1562,  by  Octroy12  of  Philip  II13,  the  kinds  of  relief  which  might  be"
"","granted  were  classified  into  two,  viz.,  relief  granted  against  material"
"","rights  which  had  once  been  established  (material  relief),  and  relief  by"
"","undoing  legal  proceedings  which  had  once  become  res  judicata  and"
"","against which no further appeal lay (formal or processual relief). It was"
"","at the same time provided that such formal relief should be granted by"
"","the Judge of (or Court of Appeal) van Holland."
"(viii)","After the eighty years' war between Spain and the Northern Provinces of"
"","the Netherlands had broken out, and the Council of Mechlin had ceased"
"","to  exercise  jurisdiction  in  those  Provinces,  the  States  of  Holland,  by"
"","resolution of May 8, 1573, granted the right to rescind contracts to the"
"","same Hof van Holland, and after the creation of a Supreme Court (Hooge"
"","Raad,  1582)  to  that  high  tribunal.  In  1795,  after  the  abolition  of  the"
"","Supreme Court, it came back to the Hof van Holland."
"(ix)","Though the Supreme Court granted letters of relief, it did not investigate"
"","cases. These were sent by a committimus to the ordinary judge of first"
"","instance,  who  investigated  them  and  granted  or  rejected  the  petition,"
"","and his decision then received the sanction of the Supreme Court. [This"
"","has  the  combined  effect  of  certiorari  –  bring  the  record  to  see  –  and"
"","procedendo – proceed to judgment] [The term “writ” too originated in a"
"","writing addressed to (often) an inferior court. Here the reference is to a"
"","“letter”]"
