"Counsel describes the reason as to why this Court intervened in his own words,"
"as follows,"
"“It  is  notable  that  in  Aussie  Oats  Milling  (Private)  Limited  v  Future"
"Consumer  Limited  and  Another,  Your  Lordship's  Court  allowed  such"
"application  in  restitutio  in  integrum  because  the  Petitioner  therein  had"
"made the requisite application in the Commercial High Court to set aside"
"the Orders complained of therein, and it is only because the Learned High"
"Court  Judge  had  delayed  the  supporting  of  such  application  that  Your"
"Lordships  Court  allowed  the  Petitioner  in  such  matter  to  maintain  the"
"same”."
