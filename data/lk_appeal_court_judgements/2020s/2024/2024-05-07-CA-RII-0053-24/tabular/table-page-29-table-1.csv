"that  an  order  passed  after  hearing  the  parties  would  naturally  be"
"passed upon the material and data placed on the file by either party"
"and, secondly, because such order would provide the appellate court"
"the  benefit  of  the views  expressed  by  the  trial  court  in the  matter,"
"howsoever brief and cryptic such views might be. On the other hand,"
"if an appeal against an ex parte order of injunction is entertained, the"
"aggrieved party would necessarily demand that it should be allowed"
"to  place  on  record  the  material  that  it  seeks  to  rely  upon  and  this"
"would  naturally  turn  the  appellate  court  into  the  trial  court,  and,"
"moreover, the appellate court would not be able to guess as to what"
"the opinion of the trial court would be, if such material were placed"
"before it."" (Ibid, para. 14)."
