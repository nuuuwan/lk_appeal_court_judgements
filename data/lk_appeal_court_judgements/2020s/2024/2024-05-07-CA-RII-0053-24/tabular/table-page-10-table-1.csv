""" How order 
666. An order for an injunction  or enjoining  order made under"
"set  aside  or 
this  Chapter  may  be  discharged,  or  varied  or  set  aside  by  the"
"varied. 
court,  on  application  made  thereto,  by  any  party  dissatisfied"
"with such order.""."
"Let us compare this with what was there prior to the amendment."
"666.  An  order 
for  an 
injunction  made  under  this  Chapter  may  be"
"discharged,  or  varied,  or  set  aside  by  the  court,  on  application  made"
"thereto  on  petition  by  way  of  summary  procedure  by  any  party"
"dissatisfied with such order."
"The missing words are “on petition by way of summary procedure.”"
"Hence, apart from the suspension of the enjoining order to be effected in terms"
"of  section  664(3),  an  injunction  [interim  injunction]  or  enjoining  order  can  be"
"discharged, varied or set aside, by any party dissatisfied with that order,"
"(i) 
on application made thereto"
"(
a) no summary procedure"
"(b) no petition even necessary"
"(c)  on application made"
"S
ection 91 of the Code says"
"“
91. Every application made to the court in the course of an action, incidental thereto, and not a"
"step in the regular procedure, shall be made by motion by the applicant in person or his counsel or"
"registered  attorney,  and  a  memorandum  in  writing  of  such  motion  shall  be  at  the  same  time"
"delivered to the court”."
"So  it  appears,  that,  the  suspension  of  the  enjoining  order,  as  well  as,  the"
"vacation,  etc.,  of  the  enjoining  order,  interim  injunction  or  injunction  can  be"
"done even by way of a motion."
