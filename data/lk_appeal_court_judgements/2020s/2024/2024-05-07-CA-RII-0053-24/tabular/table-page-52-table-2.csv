"costs.  Anyway  Wood  Renton  J.,  in  Haramanis  set  down  those  questions  as"
"“(1) Is it too late to raise the question as to whether or not restitutio in"
"integrum can properly be held to form part of the law of the Colony?"
"(2) If that question should be answered in the negative, can the Roman-"
"Dutch remedy of restitutio in integrum be regarded as part of the law of"
"Ceylon, in view of (a) the absence from the Courts Ordinance and the Code"
"of Civil Procedure of any provision enabling the Supreme Court to grant"
"relief by way of restitutio in integrum (b) the powers of revision enjoyed by"
"the Supreme Court; and further, (c) decisions to the effect that an action"
"to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud or mistake can be brought"
"in the Court which pronounced that judgment?"
"(3)  If  the  remedy  of  restitutio  in  integrum  still  survives  in  Ceylon,  what"
"ought  the  practice  to  be  in  regard  to  (a)  the  bringing  of  applications  for"
"such relief before the Court (i.e. whether ex parte or upon notice), and (b)"
"the  nature  of  the  reference  by  the  Supreme  Court  to  the  court  of  first"
"instance, that is to say, ought the Supreme Court to leave the decision, on"
"the matters referred, to the court of first instance, or to require that any"
"decision  at  which  that  Court  may  arrive  should  be  subject  to  its  own"
"sanction?”"
