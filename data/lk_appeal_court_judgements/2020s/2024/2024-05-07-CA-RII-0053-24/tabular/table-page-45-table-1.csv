"I have quoted above from bk. IV., tit. 6, cl. 17, which states that if it can"
"be shown that grave prejudice had been incurred by a consent judgment"
"of a Court of not supreme jurisdiction, there is no reason why restitution"

"something done illegally, even by a Magistrate. Supposing in this case it"

"urged that surprise was not a valid ground for an application by way"
"of restitution. Here too I cannot agree, for according to the passage"
"from Voet, bk. IV., tit. 6, cl. 17, if grave prejudice has been caused to"
"the  applicant  through  any  cause  whatever8,  there  is  no  reason  why"

"difference  between  that  case  and  the  one  before  us  is  that  here  the"
"petitioner  alleged  the  conduct  and  act  of  the  trial  Judge  himself  as"
