"The grievance of the petitioner for coming before this court, is the exact opposite, that"
"the Commercial High Court did not allow its application to be supported urgently."
"In fairness to that court, however, it must be stated that the said court had taken the"
"case for hearing on the motion of the petitioner on 14th February 2022. However, the"
"learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the petitioner was then, (according to the affidavit of"
"Raghav Gupta of Aussee Oats Milling (Private) Limited dated 14th of February 2022),"
"before Court No. 404 of the Supreme Court appearing in SC/FR/123/16 and his junior"
"counsel sought permission of the Commercial High Court to take the matter later. The"
"said affidavit further states that since there were no other matters pending before that"
"court it ordered to mention the matter on 24th February 2022. It was stated from the"
"Bar that when this happened the time was 10.25 a.m. The said affidavit further states"
"that a motion was filed on 14th February 2022 itself in the said court requesting to call"
"the case on 15th February 2022 but that motion was not allowed. It was said from the"
"Bar that a matter concerning the same subject, case No. CHC 78/2021 CO was to be"
"heard on 15th February 2022."
"As  per  the  paragraph  02  of  the  aforesaid  written  submissions  of  the  respondent,  it"
"instituted the case No. CHC 02/2022/CO on 26th January 2022 and in terms of section"
"224 and 225 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 read with section 520 obtained ex"
"parte interim orders. As per its paragraph 04, the petitioner has made an application"
"on  09th  February  2022,  under  section  521(1)  of  Companies  Act  to  set  aside  and  or"
"revoke or vary the said orders."
"It  appears  that  this  second  application  made  by  the  petitioner  Aussee  Oats  Milling"
"(Private) Limited was the one that came for support on 14th February 2022 and the"
"aforesaid incident narrated in the affidavit of Raghav Gupta took place."
"The petitioner, Aussee Oats Milling (Private) Limited has further stated in its aforesaid"
"affidavit that in case No. CHC 78/2021 CO, the same learned High Court Judge has"
"granted certain interim orders against the respondent."
