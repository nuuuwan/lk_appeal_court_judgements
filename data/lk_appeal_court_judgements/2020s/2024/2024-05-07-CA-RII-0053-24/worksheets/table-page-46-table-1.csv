"In this case decided in 1939 Soertsz J., held, that,"
"“The Supreme Court has no power to revise or review a case decided by"
"itself."
"Relief  by  way  of  restitution  on  the  ground  of  Justus  error  will  not  be"
"granted to a party who has failed to place before the Court matter, which"
"was at his command, if reasonable diligence had been exercised."
"In  order  to  succeed  in  an  application  for  restitution  the  petitioner  must"
"show that the fact was not merely material but of such vital and essential"
"materiality that it must have altered the whole aspect of the case”."
