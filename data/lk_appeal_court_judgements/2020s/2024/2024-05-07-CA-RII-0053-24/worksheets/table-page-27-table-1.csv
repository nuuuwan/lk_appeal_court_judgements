"â€œThe Madras High Court is of the view that the injuncted party must"
"first  exhaust  his  remedy  under  r.  4  before  filing  the  appeal.  The"
"reasons given in support of this view are that Or. 43, r. 1(r) can be invoked"
"only  in  a  case  where  the  lower  appellate  court  makes  a  decision  after"
"hearing the affected party within the meaning of s2(9) and (14) of the Code"
"of Civil Procedure and expresses itself formally so that its reasoning and"
"grounds on which its decision is based could be scrutinized by the higher"
"court, and where an interim or ex parte order is not founded on any reason"
"and  cannot  reasonably  be  characterized  as  a  formal  expression  of  a"
"decision made by a judge and which decision in turn is not based upon"
"intelligible  and  acceptable  grounds,  the  remedy  available  to  a  party"
"affected is under Or. 39, r. 4 and not by invoking the appellate provision"
"under  Or.  43,  r.  1(r).  Of  course,  in  a  case  where  there  is  a  reasoned"
"judgment  after  hearing  the  parties,  and  a  decision  based  on  various"
"grounds is made, one way or the other, by the trial court, then obviously,"
"that would be an appealable order. (Abdul Shukoor Sahib vs. Uma Chander"
"AIR 1976 Mad 350; Ramlingan Naicker vs. Chennakrishna Konar AIR 1983"
"Mad 347). The Karnataka High Court is also practically of the same view;"
"but it does not agree that the right of appeal is dependent upon the"
"distinction between a reasoned order and an unreasoned order. It is"
"true  that  a  party  can  move  an  application  under  Or.  39,  r.  4,  CPC  for"
"vacation or variation of the ex parte order of interim injunction, in case of"
"any concealment or willful misrepresentation. However, the pendency of"
"the matter before the single judge who passed the said order would"
"not  preclude  the  right  of  a  party  to  challenge  an  ex  parte  order  in"
"appeal. Even if the matter is pending before the single judge, if the urgency"
"and circumstances so justified, such an appeal would be entertained. (B."
"L. & Co., vs. Pfizer Products Inc. AIR 2001 NOC 87 (Del)). An unreasoned"
"order of rejection is, it is said, equally appealable. It has also been observed"
"that the right of appeal is available to a stranger also where he is affected"
