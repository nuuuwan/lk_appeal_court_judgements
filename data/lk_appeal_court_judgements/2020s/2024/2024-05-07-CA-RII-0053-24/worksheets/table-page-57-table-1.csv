"remedy  is  open  to  a  party,  the  extraordinary  one  of  restitutio  in"
"integrum cannot be granted."
"(j)  My  attention  has  also  been  called  by  Mr.  Tambyah  to  the  case  of"
"Buyzer v. Eckcrt,4 ((1910) 13 N.L.R.371;2 Cur. L.R.200) decided by"
"my brother Middleton and myself, where we held that where fraud is"
"averred  against  a  judgment,  such  judgment  may  be  set  aside  by"
"restitutio  in  integrum,  or  by  a  suit  in  the  Court  which  passed  the"
"original decree. I may myself have acted on the law as laid down by"
"Sir John Bonser C.J. and Withers J. in Gunaratne v. Dingiri Banda"
"and  by  the  Full  Court  in  Sinnatamby  v.  Nallatamby,  and  in  other"
"cases which have not been reported; It might well have been found"
"too late even for the Full Court, and it is certainly too late for a Bench"
"of two judges, in the slate of the law as I have outlined it above, to"
"hold that the remedy of restitutio in integrum ought no longer to be"
"recognized."
