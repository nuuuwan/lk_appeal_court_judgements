"“6  Vacation  of  ex  parte  injunction.  -In  Rameshwar  Dass  v.  Brij"
"Bhushan, AIR 1988 HP 31 at 32 (per P. D. Desai, C. J.),"
"it was observed as follows:-"
"The  counsel  for  the  respondents  tried  to  sustain  the  order  on  the"
"ground  that  an  express  power  is  vested in  the  Court  under Order"
"XXXIX  Rule  4  to  discharge  or  vary  or  set  aside  any  order  of"
"injunction on an application made thereto by any party dissatisfied"
"with such order and if in an application for temporary injunction or"
"in any affidavit supporting such application, a party has knowingly"
"made  a  false  or  misleading  statement  in  relation  to  a  material"
"particular and the injunction was granted without giving notice to"
"the  opposite  party,  the  Court  has  no  option  but  to  vacate  the"
"injunction unless, for reasons to be recorded, it considers that it is"
"not necessary so to do in the interest of justice and that, therefore,"
"on  the  facts  and  in  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  the  trial  Court"
"was within its powers to vacate the ad interim relief granted ex parte"
