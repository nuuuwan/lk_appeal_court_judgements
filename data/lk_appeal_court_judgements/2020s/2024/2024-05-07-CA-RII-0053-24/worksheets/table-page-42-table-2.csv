"certain  circumstances  where  the  ordinary  Courts  were  powerless  to"
"relieve.”"
"The  above  dicta  also  show,  with  respect,  the  doubts  that  existed  on  the  very"
"nature and scope of the remedy in the early days of the last (20th) century. The"
"last  two  quotations  amply  demonstrate,  it  is  submitted,  that,  the  remedy  was"
"understood as a power especially delegated by the sovereign to the court which"
"exercised it; and as Grenier A. J., specifically referred to, a “policy” of limiting"
"the  remedy  to  one  of  last  resort  “where the  ordinary  courts were  powerless  to"
"relive” was mentioned. However, unfortunately, no authority was cited for this"
"alleged “policy” in Roman Dutch Law, except, that, it could have been “taken for"
"granted’,  as  an  off  shoot  of  the  origin  of  the  remedy  on  the  authority  of  the"
"sovereign. So were English writs."
