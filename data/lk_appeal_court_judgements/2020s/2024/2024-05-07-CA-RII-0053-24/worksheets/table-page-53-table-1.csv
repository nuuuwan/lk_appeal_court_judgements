"case which is referred to below in point form.",""
"(i)","Under  the  civil  law,  where  a  person  suffered  a  legal  prejudice  by  the"
"","operation of law, the prætor having personally inquired into the matter"
"","(causae cognitio) in the exercise of his imperium, which enabled him to"
"","consider  all  the  actual  facts  of  the  case,  might  issue  a  decree  re-"
"","establishing  the  original  legal  position,  that  is  to  say,  replacing  the"
"","person injured in his previous condition."
"(ii)","In Roman law restitutio in integrum was the removal of a disadvantage"
"","in law which had legally occurred. It was a protection against justice (as"
"","distinguished  from  an  action  against  injustice),  which  was  rendered"
"","necessary on account of the practical impossibility of taking legally, in"
"","advance,  all  the  circumstances  into  consideration  that  in  reality  may"
"","occur. (Sohm's Institutes of Roman Law, s. 56, 111, Burge, 2nd ed., vol."
"","4, chap. 1.)"
"(iii)","The restitution thus granted by the praetor in jure was then followed by"
"","the judicium rescissorium, that is, the trial and decision of the action"
"","which had been thus restored. The judicium rescindens itself, i.e., the"
"","proceeding which resulted in the restitution, was invariably conducted"
"","and concluded by the praetor himself."
"(iv)","In  Roman  law  restitutio  in  integrum  was  divided  into  two  classes,  (i)"
"","restitutio minorum (under 25 years of age) and (ii) restitutio majorum"
"","(25 years and upwards), in cases of absentia, metus, dolus, and error."
"(v)","The remedy was received into the Roman-Dutch law in a wider form."
"(vi)","Restitutio  was  not  only  granted  to  minors.  It  might  be  granted  to  any"
"","one,  either  in  toto,  on  the  grounds  of  metus,  dolus,  absentia,  and"
"","minority, or partially, on the ground that the damage suffered exceeded"
"","the  value  of  what  was  obtained  through  the  transaction  by  half  (ob"
"","laesionem  enormem).  Van  der  Linden  gives  as  additional  grounds  for"
