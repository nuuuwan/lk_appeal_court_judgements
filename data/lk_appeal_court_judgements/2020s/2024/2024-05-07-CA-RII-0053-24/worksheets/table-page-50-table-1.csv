"of taking legally, in advance, all the circumstances that in reality may"
"occur. The remedy was granted by the Praetor who himself conducted the"
"proceeding  in  which  judicium  rescindens  might  ultimately  be  granted."
"Abeysekera v. Haramanis Appu (1). The remedy was received into Roman"
"Dutch  Law  in  wider  form,  where  restitutio  in  integrum  was  primarily"
"intended for relief from contracts on the ground of minority, error, fraud"
"and duress. Relief by way of restitutio in integrum was also granted from"
"the  effect  of  an  order  in  judicial  proceedings.  Phipps  v.  Bracegyrdle  (2)."
"Vander  Linden  groups  cases  when  relief  could  be  obtained  under  two"
"heads.  (a)  Relief  relating  to  the  original  matter  itself  (substantial  relief);"
"relieving a party from any act or contract and replacing him in his former"
"situation on the ground of his having been induced through fear, fraud,"
"minority, error, absence or other sufficient reasons to do the act against"
"which he prays relief. (b) Relief relating merely-to some omission or error"
"in the process of pleading, (judicial relief).‚Äù"
