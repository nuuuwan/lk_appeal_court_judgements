"Indian cases of Ghosh v. Damodar Valley Corporation, AIR 1953 Cal. 581 and Parraju"
"v. General Manager B.N. Rly. AIR 1952 Cal. 610.”"
"I
n Dr. Puvanendran and another v Premasiri and two others 2009 (2) Sri. L.R. 107 it"
"was held that the Court will issue a writ only if the major facts are not in dispute and"
"the legal result of the facts are not subject to controversy."
"F
urther, it is observed that any balance payment if any as claimed by the Petitioner"
"could  be  made  only  after  considering  the recommendations  of  the  appointed"
"Committee who exercised its discretion. In Abeyratne v Minister of Lands and Others"
"S.C. (Spl)LA No. 197/08 SC Minutes: 01.06.2009, Sarath N. Silva C.J., emphasizing the"
"clear distinction between the two remedies of Certiorari and Mandamus quoted the"
"excerpts 
from  Administrative  Law  by  Wade  and  Forsyth 
(Ninth  Edition)  and"
"pronounced 
that,  “obligatory  duties  must  be  distinguished 
from  discretionary"
"powers.  With the latter, Mandamus has nothing to do”.  His Lordship Chief Justice"
"reiterated  that Mandamus  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  exercise  of  discretionary"
"power."
"The Cabinet arrived at its decision on 03.03.2010 based on Document P18B which is"
"intact. Furthermore, it is observed that the Petitioner has sought to quash only the"
"decision 
reflected 
in  P46  but  not 
the 
respective 
recommendations  made 
in"
"Document P18B or the said Cabinet Decision. Hence, any order to be delivered to"
"quash 
the  said  decision 
in  P46  would  not  have  any  effect  on 
the  existing"
"recommendations in P18B. The Petitioner has failed to establish any legal right  to"
"make any balance payment. A Writ of Mandamus cannot be sought to enforce a right"
"not of a legal basis but of a purely equitable matter as the function of the Writ of"
"Mandamus is to compel a public authority to do its duty. [see, Amarasekera v. Hon."
"Nimal Siripala de Silva and 4 others 2010[B.L.R.] 54]."
"A
t  the  same  instant,  even  if  the  Petitioner's  application  for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  is"
"granted, he is not entitled to claim balance payment as the decision in P18B exists."
"Therefore, 
issuing  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  as  prayed  would  be  futile. 
  A  Writ  of"
"Mandamus will not be issued if it will be futile to do so and no purpose will be served."
