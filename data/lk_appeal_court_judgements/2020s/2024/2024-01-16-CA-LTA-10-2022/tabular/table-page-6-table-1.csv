"of Colombo."
"Moreover, it is to be considered that the notices dispatched by the learned"
"Quazi of Negombo to the Respondent under registered post have not been"
"returned and it was not the contention of the Respondent that she has not"
"received those notices."
"In  those  circumstances,  it  is  evident  that  at  the  time  of  filling  an  action"
"(intention of talak) by the Petitioner in the Quazi Court of Negombo, the"
"Respondent  was  a  resident  in  Negombo,  and  therefore,  under  the  2nd"
"schedule  of  the  Muslim  Marriage  and  Divorce  Act,  the  learned  Quazi  of"
"Negombo had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. As such, the"
"determination 
of 
the  Board 
of  Quazi 
is 
factually 
incorrect 
and"
"misconceived in law."
"For 
the 
foregoing  reasons, 
the  Order  of 
the  Board  of  Quazi  dated"
"10-12-2022 is set aside. The Order of the learned Quazi of Negombo dated"
"25-11-2017  permitting 
the  Petitioner 
to  pronounce  Talak 
on 
the"
"Respondent and the registration of Talak on 26-02-2018 are affirmed. It is"
"declared  that  the  divorce  certificate 
issued  by  the 
learned  Quazi  of"
"Negombo on 26-02-2018 in case No. 0105/T/17/NG is legally valid. The"
"parties should bear their own costs as to this appeal."
"The Registrar is directed to communicate this Order to the Board of Quazi"
"and the learned Quazi of Nugombo and to dispatch the original case record"
"to the Board of Quazi."
"Appeal allowed."
