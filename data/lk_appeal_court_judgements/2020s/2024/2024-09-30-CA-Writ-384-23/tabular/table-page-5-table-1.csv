"Provincial  Council  is  appointed  by  election  and  subsequent  to  being  elected  as  the"
"Chairman, the said Section also contemplates situations as to how the Council should"

"Counsel submitted that upon the Petitioner being disqualified, the  Central Provincial"
"Council had elected a new Chairman for the remainder of the tenure. It was conceded"
"by all the Counsel that the so-elected Chairman under Section 7 can nevertheless hold"
"the Chairman’s position until the election of the next Council. Upon further inquiry by"
"the Court, it was submitted that this procedure had been followed and a new Chairman"
