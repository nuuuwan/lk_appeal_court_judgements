"The Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council was subsequently repealed by"
"the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981.  The Corresponding section in the said"
"Act to Section 52 of the Order is Section 66."
"O
n  a  careful  consideration  this  Court  is  of  the  view  that  the  wording  used  in  both"
"paragraphs refers to the convictions and not the sentence. The English phrase used is"
"“of his being convicted of an illegal practice.”  The Sinhala phrased used is “බර්පවේනා"
"නීිය යටහේ වූ ද වරදකට හ ෝ වරදකරු කරනු ර්ැබුවහ ාේ.”"
"H
ence,  it  is  clear  that  once  a  person  is  convicted  of  a  violation  of  Section  66  of  the"
"Parliamentary Elections Act, he becomes disentitled to be an elector or even to  vote"
"irrespective  of  the  sentence.  Hence  in  this,  instance  as  per  the  Petitioner’s  own"
"pleadings, he has been convicted of violations under the Parliamentary Elections Act"
"which is borne out of the documents marked P1, the judgement of the Court of Appeal."
"Hence, it is the view of this Court that once there is a conviction, he is disqualified to"
"be  an  elector  or  a  voter  in  addition  he  becomes  disqualified  under  Section  3  of  the"
"Provincial Councils Act as well.  The said conviction in the High Court has not been set"
"aside by the Court of Appeal. In fact, it has been affirmed and the Appeal dismissed."
"The Court of Appeal has only varied the sentence on sympathetic grounds and that too"
"with effect from 2nd of December 2021."
"A
ccordingly, as per the Constitutional provisions the Petitioner does not qualify to be"
"an elector for the period in question. Accordingly, his contention to seek compensation"
"for the salary for the said period is not tenable. Hence, the Petitioner’s main contention"
"cannot be sustained."
"I
s the Petitioner’s Application premature?"
"I
t was brought to the attention of the Court that the Petitioner’s conviction is affirmed"
"in appeal but the said sentence has been suspended for a period of five years. As per the"
"judgment of the Court of Appeal, the suspended period commences running from the"
"date of the Court of Appeal judgement. The judgement specifically gives the operational"
"period of the suspended sentence to commence from 02.12.2021. Hence, it is obvious"
"that the Petitioner is still within the operational period of the suspended sentence. As"
"per Section 303(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure an offender who is sentenced to"
"a suspended sentence of imprisonment is discharged from the sentence only at the end"
"of the operational period. Without prejudice to the above, therefore this Court is of the"
"14"
