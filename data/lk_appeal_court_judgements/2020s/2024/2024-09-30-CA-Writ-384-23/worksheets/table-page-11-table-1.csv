"a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondent to pay the salary based on erroneous"
"facts and figures has to fail."
"A
s  per  the  pleadings  and  the  submission  of  the  learned  Counsel  appearing  for  the"
"Petitioner, he has confined his claim for the period from 2015 to 2018. This period is"
"not covered by the judgment marked as P1, which the Petitioner relies on to state that"
"his sentence is suspended."
"I
t is also pertinent to note that as per the submissions made and as per the material before"
"this Court and for the reasons enumerated above, the Petitioner has failed to establish"
"that he has any right to seek the reliefs claimed."
"H
as the Petitioner established grounds for a Mandamus?"
"T
he  Petitioner  has  been  charged  for  election  related  offences  while  contesting  the"
"Provincial  Council  elections.  After  a  lengthy  trial,  he  has  been  found  guilty  and"
"convicted by the  High Court. He had been imposed with a  sentence of  two  and  half"
"years. Subsequently, he has filed an appeal and at the appeal the Appellate Court giving"
"its reasons has affirmed the conviction. However, considering the lengthy duration of"
"the  trial,  the  Appellant’s  advanced  age  and  considering  that  he  had  no  previous"
"convictions  the  Appellate  Court  had  suspended  the  prison  term  to  five  years  after"
"reducing it to two years to run from the date of the Appellate Court’s judgment delivered"
"on 02.12.2021. The learned ASG submitted that the said leniency has been showed to"
"the Petitioner on sympathetic grounds this position was not contradicted by the learned"
"Counsel appearing for the Petitioner. Leaving the said submission as it is, this Court"
"observes that the Petitioner as per his own submissions is a people’s representative and"
"was elected as a member of the Provincial Council. Furthermore, it was submitted that"
"he was elected as the Chairmen of the said Provincial Council. A member holding such"
"a high office should be an example to the people whom he governs. Despite his sentence"
"being suspended, in appeal, the conviction has been affirmed. In this background, the"
"Petitioner having obtained the suspended sentence is now pleading to receive/be given"
"his salary for the period he was unseated as a result of the conviction."
"H
ence,  as  quite  correctly  submitted  by  the  learned  ASG  by  this  Application  the"
"Petitioner is attempting to receive a salary for a period that he has not worked for. It"
"also appears that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Mandamus to reinstate him in his"
"position as the Chairman. It is trite law that a Writ of Mandamus cannot be sought by a"
"party as of a right and it is a discretionary remedy the Court exercise."
