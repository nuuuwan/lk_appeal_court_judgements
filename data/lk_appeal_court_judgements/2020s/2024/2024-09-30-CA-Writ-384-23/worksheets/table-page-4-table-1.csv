"The Petitioner has pleaded that he could have been in the Provincial Council for his"
"full-term  period  if  not  for  the  conviction  and  he  further  submits  that  he  was  the"
"Chairman of the Central Provincial Council. It is further pleaded under Section 7(2) of"
"The  Provincial  Councils  Act,  No.  42  of  1987  that  even  if  the  time-period  for  the"
"Provincial Council has now expired, if he was a Chairman of the Provincial Council, he"
"could have held that position until the next election. It was pleaded that, as a Provincial"
"Council member, he could have held his position from October 2013 to the year 2018,"
"if  not  for  the  conviction  whereby  he  was  removed  from  office  on  30th  March  2015."
"Hence, the argument is that he is lawfully entitled to the salaries from 30th March 2015"
"to 08th October 2018 and he has sought a Writ of Mandamus against the Respondents"
"asking to pay the Petitioner compensation for the due amount of his salaries and further"
"to reinstate him as the Chairman of the Central Provincial Council."
