"n Perera v. National Housing Development Authority (2001) 3 SLR 50 the Courts"
"“On the question of legal right, it is to be noted that the foundation of mandamus"
"is the existence of a right. (Napier Ex parte). Mandamus is not intended to create"
"a right, but to restore a party who has been denied his right to the enjoyment of"
"such right. A “Mandamus” will lie to any person or authority who is under a"
"duty (Imposed by statute or under common Law) to do a particular act, if that"
"person or authority refrains from doing the act or refrains for wrong motives"
"from  exercising  a  power  which  is  his  duty  to  exercise.  The  Court will issue  a"
"Mandamus to do what he should do. (R v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner”"
