"the superintendent of a prison and the provisions of section 264 shall"
"apply to every such warrant."
"It appears that the learned High Court Judge has relied on the explanation that"
"appears after subsection (2), which has interpreted the reasonable cause for a"
"remand under the section."
"However, it needs to be noted that although the learned High Court Judge has"
"relied on the explanation of section 263 to remand the accused pending further"
"trial, he has not followed the mandatory provision of section 263 (1) where the"
"trial shall, as far as practicable, should be held day to day."
"Not only  that, the summons to the other witnesses the prosecution intended to"
"call  on  the  next  date  of  the  trial  has  not  been  ordered,  as  I  have  observed"
"previously. As a result, the case will have to be invariably postponed to a further"
"date, which will result in further incarceration of the accused."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give a reason as to why the"
"further trial cannot be held day to day in his order of remand."
"Under  the  circumstances,  the  only  assumption  that  can  be  made  is  that  the"
"remanding of the accused for a period of 3 months had been done as a punitive"
"measure."
"I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the"
"relevant  law  applicable  for  granting  or  remanding  of  an  accused  or  a  suspect"
"person as provided for by statutory provisions in relation to bail, enacted by the"
"legislature in its wisdom."
"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  relevant"
"provisions  of  the  Bail  Act  No.  30  of  1997,  which  has  been  enacted  by  the"
"legislature to provide for release on bail of persons suspected or accused of being"
"concerned in committing or of having committed an offence; to provide for the"
"granting of anticipatory bail, and for matters connected therewith or incidental"
"thereto."
