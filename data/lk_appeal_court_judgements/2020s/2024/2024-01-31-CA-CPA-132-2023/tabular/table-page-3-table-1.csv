"Judge of Kandy on 5th October 2023, where the accused-respondent (hereinafter"

"application before the Court."
"At the conclusion of the arguments on this matter, the learned DSG agreed that"
"ordering  the  release  of  the  accused  pending  the  final  determination  of  the"

"after serving the indictment and other relevant documents on the accused, the"
"learned High Court Judge of Kandy has released the accused on bail."
