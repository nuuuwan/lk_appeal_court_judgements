"It  was  held  in  the  case  of  Hotel  Galaxy  (Pvt)  Ltd.  Vs.  Mercantile  Hotels"
"Management Ltd. (1987) 1 SLR 05 that;"
"“It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the"
"appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances"
"exist warranting its intervention.”"
"In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamaratnam, (Srikantha Law Reports Vol-IV"
"page 47) it was held that;"
"“Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the"
"application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the"
"Court.”"
"In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365, it"
"was held thus;"
"“Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice"
"has occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but"
"only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage"
"of justice.”"
"For  the  reasons  as  stated  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  petitioner  has"
"established, sufficient exceptional circumstances before this Court for this Court"
"to interfere into the impugned order made by the learned High Court Judge as"
"the said order has been made without giving due consideration to the relevant"
"law in that regard."
"Another matter that needs to be stated is that although, maybe  inadvertently,"
"by applying this procedure of remanding the accused without having a basis as"
"stipulated in terms of section 14 of the Bail Act, the learned High Court Judge"
"may have given several grounds of appeal that can be canvassed by the accused"
"in  case  of  a  conviction  against  him  for  the  charge,  if  the  accused  decides  to"
"challenge such a conviction in the appropriate forum."
