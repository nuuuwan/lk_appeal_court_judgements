"In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court held"
"that:"
"""It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone can be"
"punished  or  prejudiced  in  his  person  or  his  property  by  any"
"judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be afforded adequate"
"opportunity of being heard ... """
"In this case the Petitioner had absconded the court in the year 2008 and was"
"arrested in the year 2019 after seven years of the judgment. Although he had"
"come to Sri Lanka twice in 2015 and 2018, he had not taken any endeavour"
"to check the progress of his case. Further, he had taken up the position that"
"he was under death threat from an underworld figure who  had  died some"
"time back. The learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered these"
"matters in detail and had concluded that his absence to court was mala fide."
"Therefore, his application under Section 241(3) of the CPC was rejected very"
"correctly."
"Sentencing  is  the  prerogative  of  the  court.  Accused  who  plead  guilty  will"
"usually  receive  a  reduced  sentence.  The  rational  behind  this  is  that  it"
"encourages accused who know they are guilty to enter a guilty plea at the"
"earliest possible stage, so saving court time and money and saving witnesses"
"from having to attend court to give evidence. Further, victims are saved from"
"secondary victimization."
"In this case the 2nd and 4th Accused had pleaded guilty to their respective"
"charges on 14.11.2011. The Learned High Court Judge after considering the"
"submissions  of  both  parties  passed  the  sentence  which  he  considered"
"appropriate."
"The  Petitioner  in  this  case  absconded  the  court  after  the  service  of  the"
"indictment and he twice came to Sri Lanka but not taken any endeavour to"
"check the status quo of his case. He was arrested by the Sevanagala Police"
