"after seven years of the warrant issued against him. Hence, the learned High"
"Court  Judge  had  very  correctly  considered  all  these  circumstances  at  the"
"241(3) CPC inquiry and passed the sentence imposed on him on 13.03.2012."
"Therefore, the contention he advances under disparity of sentence cannot be"
"considered as an exceptional circumstance."
"Considering all the materials placed before this court, I am of the view that"
"this is not a matter where extraordinary power of revision of this court should"
"be exercised in term of Article 138 of the Constitution. The Petitioner has not"
"submitted sufficient exceptional grounds which warrant the intervention of"
"this Court."
"Therefore, this revision application is dismissed."
"The Registrar  of this Court  is directed to send this judgement to the High"
"Court of Embilipitiya for necessary implementation."
