"(b) The fiduciary duties of directors;"
"(c) The statutory duties."
"â€œ
Directors are, in the eyes of the law, agents of the company for which they act, and the"
"general  principles  of  the  law  of  principal  and  agent  regulate  in  most  respects  the"
"relationship between the company and its directors. The directors are persons selected to"
"manage the affairs of the Company for the benefit of the shareholders. It is an office of"
"trust which, if they undertake, it is their duty to perform fully and entirely. Explaining"
"the dual character of directors, Lord Selbourne said: ""The Directors are the mere trustees"
"or agents of the company - trustees of the company's money and property - agents in the"
"transactions which they enter into on behalf of the Company"" which I have quoted earlier"
