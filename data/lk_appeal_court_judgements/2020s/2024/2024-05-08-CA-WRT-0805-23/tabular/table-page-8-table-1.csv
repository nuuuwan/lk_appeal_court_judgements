ayaweera v. Asst.  Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another, 1996 (2)"

I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of"
"certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter"
"of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has a discretion to deny him relief"
"having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid"
"impediments which stand against the grant of relief.” (emphasis added.)"

"""
In my view, the conduct of the Petitioners does not warrant the issuance of the writs as"
"prayed in the Petition. A party cannot ask for a writ as of right. It is a discretionary relief"
"as  well  as  an  equitable  relief.  When  granting  such  a  relief,  the  conduct  of  the  party"
"applying for it is intensely relevant. It is settled law that a person who approaches the"
"Court for the grant of discretionary relief, to which category an application for certiorari"
"would certainly belong, has to come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose all the"
"material facts which have any bearing on the adjudication of the issues raised in the case."
"In other words, he owes a duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides) to the court to make"
"a  full  and  complete  disclosure  of  all  material  facts  and  refrain  from  concealing  or"
"suppressing  any  material  fact  within  his  knowledge  or  which  he  could  have  known  by"
"exercising diligence expected of a person of ordinary prudence...... As correctly observed"
"by Saleem Marsoof, J. in Namunukula Plantations Ltd. vs. Minister of Lands and Others,"
"if any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of a court of law is found wanting in"
"the discharge of its duty to disclose all material facts or is shown to have attempted to"
"pollute the pure stream of justice, the court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief"
"to such person."" (emphasis added.)"
