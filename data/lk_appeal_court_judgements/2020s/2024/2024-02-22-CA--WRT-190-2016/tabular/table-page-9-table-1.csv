"It is evident that the petitioner has in fact appealed to the NPC on the 11th of June 2008. As"
"far as appeal  to  the PSC  is  concerned, one of the grounds that the  PSC having rejected the"
"appeal is that the petitioner has agreed on the date of promotion as 29th of March 2007 before"
"the Supreme Court. However, it should be noted that the petitioners have not withdrawn the"
"case  but  the  court  has  dismissed  it.  Therefore,  it  would  be  incorrect  to  allege  that  the"
"petitioner has accepted the subsequent date of promotion."
"The petitioner has submitted an order of the AAT dated 21st of May 2015, concerning some"
"other party marked as ‘P 26’."
"When  comparing  the  two  orders  dated  21st  of  May  2015  and  2nd  of  March  2015,  they  are"
"identical  factually.  However,  in  the  said  ‘P  26’  the  AAT  has  allowed  the  appeal  for  the"
"reasons  set  out  therein.  Having  considered  the  present  case,  I  do  not  see  any  reason  to"
"differentiate this from the decision contained in the said ‘P 26’. Therefore, by the impugned"
"order  ‘P  23’  the  AAT  has  taken  into  consideration  incorrect  factors  and  it  fails  the  test  of"
"reasonableness and equality and accordingly, the order of AAT could not stand."
"Therefore, with regret of have to set aside the order of the AAT dated 2nd of March 2015 and"
"grant  relief (b) in  the prayer of the petition. Though the  AAT has dismissed the petitioners"
"appeal on a preliminary objection, when considered the order ‘P 26’  the line of thinking of"
"the AAT is quite evident. As I do not see any reason to deviate from the said findings, there is"
"no purpose in ordering a fresh hearing. Therefore, the relief (c) as prayed for should also be"
"granted. Accordingly, I direct the AAT to backdate the promotion of the applicant on 07th of"
"June 1999 and relief prayed in prayer b) and c) are to be granted as prayed."
