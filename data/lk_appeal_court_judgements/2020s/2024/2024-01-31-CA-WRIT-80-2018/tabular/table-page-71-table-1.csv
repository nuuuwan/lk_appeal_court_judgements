"is to hold thus: no court or tribunal has any jurisdiction to make an error"
"of  law  on  which  the  decision  of  the  court  depends.  If  it  makes  such  an"
"error, it goes outside its jurisdiction and certiorari will lie to correct it. In"
"this case the finding – that the installation of a central heating system was"
"not a “structural alteration” – was an error on which the jurisdiction of the"
"county  court  depended:  and,  because  of  that  error,  the  judge  was  quite"
"wrong  to  dismiss  the  application  outright…On  these  grounds  I  am  of"
"opinion that certiorari lies to quash the determination of the judge, even"
"though it was made by statute “final and conclusive.” (page 70)."
