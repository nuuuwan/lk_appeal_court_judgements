"This so happens, partly due to the fact that Girls’ High School was founded by"
"Wesleyan Methodists, because, that is how the provision with regard to religious"
"ratios in the circular and the proportions come; and partly due to statistics (in"
"1961 and in 2018) The rest is arithmetic."
"In C. A. Writ 183/2019 relied upon by the petitioner although the Court of Appeal"
"granted relief to the petitioner, it has been said at page 06 of the judgment, that,"
"under  Clause  4:2  vacancies  in  the  school  shall  be  divided  among  different"
"religions and categories and the word “categories” refer to those under Clause"
"3:0 (that is, under (i) to (vi) “proximity”, etc.) This is not correct. The “categories”"
"referred  to  in  Clause  4:2  are  not  “proximity”,  “old  girl”,  “sister”,  etc.,  but  the"
"denominations  within  a  religion.  To  say  no  is  the  ignorance  of  the  historical"

"religion,  also  makes  this  fact  clear  in  the  term  “for  a  given  category  of  a"
"religion.”  But,  as  said  in  this  judgment  above,  Clause  3:0  is  regulated  by"
"Clause 4:2. The categories of “proximity”, “old girl”, etc., are subject to the"
"religious  ratios.  Therefore  the  vacancies  must  be  divided  according  to"
"categories in Clause 3:0 and religions and religious categories mentioned"
"in Clause 4:2, as it was shown above by example, in this judgment."
"What was said in the case cited at page 08, in C. A. Writ 189/2019, that is, case"
