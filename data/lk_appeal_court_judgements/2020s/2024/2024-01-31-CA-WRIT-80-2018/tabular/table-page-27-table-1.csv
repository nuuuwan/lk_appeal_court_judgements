"Under section 11 of the Act if the Minister after examination of representations"
"made to him by any person or persons entitled to do so under section 08(b), (i.e.,"
"a teacher or a parent of a pupil) that the decision in favour of the proprietor to run the"
"school unaided with a right to levy fees was obtained by fraudulent or improper"
"means or after consultation with the Director is of the view, that, the school is"
"run unaided in contravention of any regulations or an order made under the Act,"
"can by order published in the gazette direct, that, such school cease to be an"
"unaided  school,  that  it  be  deemed  for  all  purposes  as  an  Assisted  school  and"
"that the Director shall be the Manager of such school."
"Under section 16 of the Act in the event of a conflict, the Act prevailed over any"
"other written law."
"Hence the state had wide powers not only to direct, that, an Assisted School shall"
"vest on it, but also to determine whether a school is an assisted school or not."
