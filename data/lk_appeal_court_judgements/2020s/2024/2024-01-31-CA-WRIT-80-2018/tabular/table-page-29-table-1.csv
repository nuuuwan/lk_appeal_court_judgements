"","“Under  the  British  colonial  regime,  Catholics  and  Christians  enjoyed  a"
"","privileged position in the field of education. By 1939, both Catholics and"
"","other  Christians  who  comprised  only  6.25  percent  of  the  population"
"obtained  73.2  percent  Government  grant","for  denominational  schools"
"","whereas Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims who constituted 93.7 percent of"
"","the  population  received  the  balance  26.3  percent  of  the  grant.  (Prof  J  E"
"","Jayasuriya; Education in Ceylon - page 3) Besides higher education which"
"was in English was fee-levying and was limited”.",""

"","“At the 1960 July election the SLFP vociferously declared that the assisted"
"","schools would be vested in the State. Accordingly the Schools Takeover Act"
"","was passed in Parliament with a majority of 60 members. Only the UNP"
"","and the Federal Party voted against it. Nevertheless the Catholic Church"
"","was getting ready from 1956 to resist the Schools Takeover. In 1959, at a"
"","meeting  held  in  Negombo,  T  B  Cooray  the  Archbishop  of  Colombo  said,"
"","“Our schools should not be touched. We would fight to the end even by"
"shedding blood” (Dinamina June 30, 1959)”.",""
"","“When the schools were taken over, many Catholics at the instigation of"
"","the Catholic Church protested against it. Some Catholics forcibly occupied"
"","schools and many schools in Catholic areas had to be closed. This took a"
"","serious turn in the Negombo known as the little Rome and Catholic areas"
"in the vicinity.”",""
