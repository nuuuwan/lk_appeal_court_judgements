"cademic Literature to this regard by Wade and Forsyth points to the idea that such"
"an expectation created must be legitimate and free from legal encumbrances."
"“It is not enough that an expectation should exist; it must in addition be legitimate."
"But how is it to be determined whether a particular expectation is worthy of protection?"
"This is a difficult area since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not"
"be  found  to  be  legitimate  because  of  some  countervailing  consideration  of  policy  or"
"law.”3"
