"the  following  paragraph  of  Brennan,  J.,  in  Attorney  General  for  New  South  Wales  v  Quinn"
"((1990) 64 Australian L.J.R. 327);"
"“The Court must stop short of compelling fulfillment of the promise or practice unless the"
"statute so requires or the statute permits the repository of the power to bind itself as to the"
"manner  of  the  future  exercise  of  the  power.  It  follows  that  the  notion  of  legitimate"
"expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasury of natural justice and it ought not"
"unlock the gate which shuts the Court out of review on the merits.”"
