"said  Council  has  infringed  the  rights  as  well  as  breached  the  legitimate  expectation  of  the"
"individuals including one or more members of the Association, who have qualified under the"
"said Act to engage in surveying in the country and who have not been registered under the"
"law to date by the Council."
"In light of the reasons given above a writ of Mandamus is issued compelling the Respondent-"
"Land  Survey  Council  to  process  the  applications  for  the  registration  of  surveyors  of  the"
"members of the 1st Petitioner- Professional Surveyors Association and the other Petitioners in"
"terms of Sections 37 and 39. Furthermore, a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions reflected"
"in the letter marked ‘P15’ is also issued."
"It is noted that the Council is entitled, if they wish, to formulate a criterion for the purpose of"
"registering  surveyors. The  said  Association  has  expressed  its  willingness,  in  letter  marked"
"‘P22’ to extend their cooperation in formulating a criterion to register surveyors who have"
"met the qualifications required under the said Act.  Several proposals made in that regard by"
"the Association are reflected in the said ‘P22’. In this backdrop, Court makes an observation"
"that the Council may adopt a process to prolong formulating such criteria and that prolonging"
"the same may affect the Petitioners in turn. Therefore, considering the special circumstances"
"of this case and on careful consideration of the whole matter, I should exercise my discretion"
"to  make  an  order,  allowing  the  Council,  if  the  occasion  reasonably  requires,  to  delay  the"
"execution of the writ issued by this Court for a period not later than four months from the"
"date of judgement."
