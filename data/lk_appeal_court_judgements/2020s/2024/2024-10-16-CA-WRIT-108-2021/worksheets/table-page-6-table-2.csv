"SC (FR) Application No. 589/2009 decided on 10.03.2011 Dr. Shirani Bandaranaykae J. (as she"
"was then) has observed that;"
"“A careful consideration of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, clearly shows that, whether an"
"expectation is legitimate or not is a question of fact. This has to be decided not only on the basis"
"of the application made by the aggrieved party before Court, but also taking into consideration"
"whether  there  had  been  any  arbitrary  exercise  of  power  by  the  administrative  authority  in"
"question."
"Accordingly, the question that would have to be looked into would be as to whether there was a"
"promise given to the petitioner or a regular procedure that future vacancies would be filled on the"
"basis of a previously held examination on which there had been selections made on the results of"
"the said examination.”"
