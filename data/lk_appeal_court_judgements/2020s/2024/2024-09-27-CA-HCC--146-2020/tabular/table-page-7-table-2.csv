"In Poovammal v State 2012 (2) MLJ (Crl.) 482 the court held:"
"“30. Under the English Criminal Law, the provocation must be grave and"
"also sudden. But, by way of judicial thinking, the Indian Criminal Law has"
"gone ahead. (K. M. NANAVATHI Vs STATE OF MAHARASTRA [A.I.R.) 1962"
"S.C. 605). In our system, there is the concept of “Sustained Provocation”. It"
"is 
concerned  with 
the  duration  of 
the  provocation.  There  may  be"
"incidents/occurrences,  which  are  such 
that 
they  may  not  make 
the"
"offender suddenly to make his outburst by his overt act. However, it may"
"be lingering in his mind for quite some time, torment continuously and at"
"one point of time erupt, make him to lose his self-control, make his mind to"
"go astray, the mind may not be under his control/command and results in"
"the offender committing the offence. The sustained provocation/frustration"
"nurtured  in  the  mind  of  the  accused  reached  the  end  of  breaking  point,"
"under that accused causes the murder of the deceased.”"
