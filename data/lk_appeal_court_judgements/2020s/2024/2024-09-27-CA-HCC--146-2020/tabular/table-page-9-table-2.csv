"Ashworth in 1975 Criminal LR 558-559 opines as follows:"
"“The  significance  of  the  deceased’s  final  act  should  be  considered  by"
"reference  to  the  previous  relations  between  the  parties,  taking  into"
"account any previous incidents which add colour to the final act” ……."
"The point is that the significance of the deceased’s final act and its effect"
"upon the accused-and indeed the relation of the retaliation to that act-"
"can be neither understood nor evaluated without reference to previous"
"dealings between the parties”."
