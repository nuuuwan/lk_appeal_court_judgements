"testimony  of  the  witnesses  led  on  its  behalf  at  the  trial  has"
"established  beyond  reasonable  doubt 
that

"commit the acts of inflicting the injuries which  were necessarily"
"fatal  and  sufficient  in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  on  the  two"

"respect of both charges in the indictment in consideration of the"
"provisions  set  out 
in  Section  380  of 
the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure  Code  Act.    Further,  acting  in  terms  of  Section  381  of"
