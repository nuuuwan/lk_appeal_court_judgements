"","that  the  person  referred  to  in  the  statements  of  the  deceased-"

"","the  appellant.  Though  the  appellant  has  been  referred  to  as"

"","testimony  to  suggest  that  there  were  multiple  people  with  the"

"","established  that  the  appellant  was  referred  to  as  “කිරිපුතා”  and"

that

the  deceased-female  have  made","one

"statement  has  been 
in","the  Sinhala 
language,  PW-15  has"
"","translated the same to the english language. No evidence has been"
"elicited  to  establish  the","fact  that  such  translation  was  done"
"","incorrectly. PW-11 also had perceived such a statement when the"
"","deceased-female made such statement, while receiving treatment"
"","as an indoor patient in the hospital. No evidence has been elicited"
"","to reveal that the deceased-female’s condition so was serious that"
"","she was unable to speak while receiving treatment as an indoor"
"","patient. The matters referred to above establish the fact that the"
"","deceased-female  had  been  able  to  speak  soon  after  the  injuries"
"","were inflicted on her and also after she had been hospitalised for"
