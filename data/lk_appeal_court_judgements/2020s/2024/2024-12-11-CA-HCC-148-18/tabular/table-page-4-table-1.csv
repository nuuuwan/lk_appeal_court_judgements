"been handed over to the production clerk by him. At 20:30 he had handed over"
"the  envelope  which  contained  the  four  bags,  to  PC  81970  Suresh  but  not  the"
"initial pink coloured covering."
"It also has to be noted at this point that PW-01 had not taken into custody any"
"personal belongings of the appellant."
"At  this  point,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  appearing  for  the  appellant,"
"brought to the notice of court that it is very improbable that the raiding officers"
"had  not  taken  any  personal  belongings  of  the  appellant,  who  was  walking  on"

"witness that he never participated in the raid. This witness too has admitted in"
"evidence that PW-01, by mistake, had not taken it into custody; the initial pink"
"covering,  which  had  contained  the  four  bags  of  narcotics.  In  the  evidence  of"
