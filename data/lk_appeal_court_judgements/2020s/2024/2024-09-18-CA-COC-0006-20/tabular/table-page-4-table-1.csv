"lankanewsweb.org  is  the  author  and  publisher  of  the  above  article  containing  purported"
"accusations which are serious in nature,"
"iii.  the  said  article  had  been  circulated  approximately  among  122  web  users  and  shared"
"roughly among 4300 readers,"

"v. all the aspersions made against their Lordships of the Court of Appeal are false, defamatory"
"and malicious."
"We have not received any evidence or material contrary to evidence adduced by the above-"
"mentioned witnesses. We find no reason whatsoever to believe purported accusations made"
"by the said Accused against certain Judges of the Court of Appeal (as allegedly described in"
"the article marked ‘X1)’. Similarly, this Court has not received any evidence to support any"

"public has adversely affected the credibility, integrity and the independence of the Court of"
"Appeal. Further, we are of the view that such statements will eventually tarnish the trust the"
"public reposes in the administration of justice and accordingly, the said Accused has seriously"
"violated his duty to abide by the law of the country and to protect the integrity of the Court"
"of Appeal."
"In the circumstances, we are of the view that the article marked ‘X1’ authored and published"
"by  the said  Accused  has  been  made  and  published  with  a  clear  intention  of  insulting  their"
