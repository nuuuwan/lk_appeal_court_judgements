"The Supreme Court in the same judgment has referred to the below paragraphs of the case of"
"Croos and Another vs Dabrera (1999) 1 SLR 205: -"
"“The  charge  of  contempt  of  Court  was  classically  defined  in  the  case  of  Regina  vs  Kopito  by"
"Goodman J as “the scandalizing of the Court”, in that the words or the acts are likely to bring"
"the Court and the Judges in to disrepute."
"The action taken with regard to acts of contempt is based on the premises that a well regulated"
"law  of  a  civilized  community  cannot  be  sustained  without  sanctions  being  imposed  for  such"
"conduct. It is therefore thought important to maintain the respect and dignity of the Court and"
"its officers, whose task is to uphold and enforce the law, because without such respect, public faith"
"in the administration of justice would be undermined and the law itself would fall into disrepute”."
