"On 08.02.2017 PW1 was absent and the trial was re-fixed for 05.05.2017."
"On  that  day  although  PW1  and  PW2  were  present,  the  trial  could  not  be"
"commenced due to non-availability of Police Information Books. As such, the"
"case was re-fixed for trial on 20.07.2017."
"On  20.07.2017  it  was  reported  that  PW1  was  hospitalized  and  receiving"
"treatment.  Hence,  the  trial  was  re-fixed  for  12.09.2017.  On  that  day  the"
"Counsel for the Respondent moved for a date due to his ill-health. Therefore,"
"the trial was re-fixed for 17.11.2017."
"On 17.11.2017 a date was moved due to ill-health of PW1 and the trial was"
"re-fixed  for  25.06.2018.  On  that  day  it  was  reported  that  the  PW1  was  in"
"remand and notice was issued through the prison. Hence the trial was again"
"re-fixed  for  03.10.2018.  On  that  day  too  PW1  was  absent  and  summons"
"issued to PW1 and PW3 returnable on 16.01.2019."
"On  16.01.2019  the  State  Counsel  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  Court  that"
"PW1 was not stable due to gunshot injuries he had received. Therefore, an"
"application was made to call for a medical report of PW1 through Judicial"
"Medical Officer of Colombo. The Court allowed the application and re-fixed"
"the trial on 24.05.2019."
"On 25.05.2019 neither PW1 nor his MLR was produced in Court. As such, a"
"warrant was issued against PW1 and a notice was issued against the Officer-"
"in-Charge  of  the  Pollice  Narcotics  Bureau  and  the  trial  was  re-fixed  for"
"10.09.2019."
"On  10.09.2019  the  State  Counsel  confirmed  that  PW1  had  undergone  a"
"medical check and requested the Court to issue an order to get the MLR of"
"PW1 directly to the High Court. Order was made accordingly and the trial"
"was re-fixed for 17.01.2020. On that day as the Learned High Court Judge"
"was  on  an  official  duty,  trial  was  postponed  for  10.06.2020  and  PW1  and"
"PW3 were warned to appear on the next day."
