"In Attorney General v Gunawardena [1996] 2 SLR 149, the Court held that:"
"“..it is important that a Judge should not, by a premature and erroneous"
"order  that  there  is  no  case  to  go  to  the  Jury,  preclude  the  Jury  from"
"performing its proper function of determining the credibility of witnesses,"
"the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of justifiable inference from"
"the proved facts and thereby arriving at a verdict”."
