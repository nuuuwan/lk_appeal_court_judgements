"T
he contention of the learned President's Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Petitioner"
"was  that  there  has  been  no  compliance  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice,  in  so  far  this"
"Petitioner is concerned, the findings are ex-facie ultra vires and have no basis. It was further"
"argued that the findings are unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.  In the circumstances,"
"the learned Counsel for the Petitioner says that the findings and the report is ex-facie, ultra"
"vires, void and has no force or effect in law.  It is important to note that, an examination of"
"the position of the 5A Respondent, supports the position of the Petitioner, and fortifies the"
"view that the findings and the report ought to be quashed."
