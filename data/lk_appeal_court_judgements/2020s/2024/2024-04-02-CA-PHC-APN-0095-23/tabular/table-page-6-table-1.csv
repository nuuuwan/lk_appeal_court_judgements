"The  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  mainly  argued  that  the  victim  and  the"
"Petitioner have come to a good understanding and love affair as it was"
"and,  now  victim  and  the  Petitioner  are  willing  to  get  married  and  live"
"together with their child who is four years old. The victim has given an"
"affidavit to that effect and marked as X5 to this application."
"The  victim  in  this  case  was  only  13  years  old  when  she  encountered"
"this  bitter  ordeal.  According  to  the  statement  of  the  victim,  she  was"
"forcibly raped by the Petitioner sans any consent."
"The  victim  was  become  pregnant  at  the  age  of  13  years  and  became  a"
"child  mother  at  an  early  age,  without  having  any  guardian  after"
"delivering her baby. She also lost her education and was in the Visaka"

"was  taken  up  on  26.09.2022.  At  that  time,  she  was  17  years  and  10"
"months old."
"As  correctly  pointed  out  by  the  Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  who"
"represented the Attorney General, the proceedings of the High Court do"
"not  indicate  that  the  Petitioner  expressed  any  desire  that  he  wish  to"
"marry  the  victim  who  was  17  years  and  10  months  old  and  extended"
"interest  in  supporting  his  child  who  was  born  to  the  victim  in  any"
"manner despite the DNA Report establishing that the Petitioner was the"
"biological father of the child."
"Further, when the victim and the child were living in children’s homes,"
"there was no action taken by the Petitioner or his family to support and"
"care  for  them  prior  to  his  sentence  being  imposed  on  the  Petitioner."
"These matters had been quite correctly considered by the Learned High"
"Court Judge at the time of sentencing."
