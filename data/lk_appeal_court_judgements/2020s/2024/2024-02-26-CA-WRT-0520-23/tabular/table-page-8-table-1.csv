"the  superior  court  of  the  land  will  be  conclusive  and  final.  Therefore,  the"
"Petitioner  cannot  invoke  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  when  the  matter  has"
"already been taken up and is pending before the Supreme Court."
"In those circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that the Petitioner"
"is precluded from invoking the Prerogative Writs jurisdiction of this Court as he"
"had already invoked the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court"
"in respect of the same grievances. Thus, the instant Writ Application is liable to"
"be dismissed in-limine."
"For  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  refuse  to  issue  notices  on  the  Respondents  and"
"dismiss the Application. No costs."
"Application dismissed, no costs."
