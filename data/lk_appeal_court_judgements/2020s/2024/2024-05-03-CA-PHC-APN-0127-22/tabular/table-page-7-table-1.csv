"in  filing  revision  application  was  fatal  to  maintain  a  revision  application"
"before the Court of Appeal. His Lordship further added –"
"“These matters must be considered in limine before the Court decides to"
"hear the accused-petitioner on the merits of his application.  Before he"
"could  pass  the  gateway  to  relief  his  aforesaid  contumacious  conduct"
"and his unreasonable and undue delay in filing the application must be"
"considered  and  determination  made  upon  those  matters  before  he  is"
"heard on the merits of the application.”"
