"before the final judgment, no application for the amendment of any"
"pleadings shall be allowed…”"
"Therefore, the learned President of the Labour  Tribunal and the learned"
"Judge of the High Court cannot be found fault with for deciding that the"
"45 day notice under the above section need not necessarily be before the"
"first date fixed for trial or inquiry."
"In the circumstances this Court is of the view that the petitioner has not"
"established  a  prima  facie  case  to  issue  notice  and  the  application  is"
"therefore dismissed without costs.”"
