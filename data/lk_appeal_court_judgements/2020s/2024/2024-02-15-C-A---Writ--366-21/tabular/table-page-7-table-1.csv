"evident  that  the  Committee  has  granted  the  Petitioner  an  opportunity  to"
"adequately present his case. As per the Report of the said Committee,  the"
"Committee had conducted its investigations after obtaining a statement from"
"the  Petitioner,  examining  the  relevant  documentation,  calling  up  further"
"information 
from 
the  Department  of  Agriculture 
and  based  on 
the"
"information gathered from the discussions with the relevant officers in the"
"Department of Agriculture (see P13). Under the given circumstances and the"
"facts 
involved 
in  the 
instant  application,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  said"
"Committee has sufficiently complied with the principles of natural justice."
"In R v. Commission for Racial Equality ex parte Cotterel and Rothon (1080) @"
"p1586 Lord Lane CJ stated “as the frequently been said, and there is no harm"
"in repeating it, all that the rules of natural justice mean is that the proceedings"
"must be conducted in a way which is fair…”"
"The requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the"
"case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting,"
"the subject matter to be dealt with, and so forth (see Russell v. Duke of Norfolk"
"[1949] 1 ALL ER 109 at 118). Under different situations and conditions, the"
"requirements of compliance with the principles of natural justice shall vary."
"In the instant application, it is observed that the Petitioner has made several"
"appeals to the Public Service Commission stating that grave injustice had been"
"caused to him by not granting him his due promotions. As per the documents"
"marked R1 and R3 it is apparent that the Public Service Commission and the"
"Administrative Appeals Tribunal had dealt with and rejected such grievance"
"in respect of the promotion of the Petitioner. Therefore, it is apparent that"
"the same claim in respect of the Petitioner’s promotion was determined by"
"the PSC and AAT before it was placed before the Committee."
"It 
is 
further  observed 
that 
the  Petitioner  retired 
from 
the  service  on"
"01.06.1997.  The  Committee 
related 
to 
this  application  was  appointed"
"pursuant to a letter sent by the Petitioner dated 14.07.2020. The Petitioner"
"seems  to  be  solely  responsible  for  the  significant  delay  in  submitting  this"
"application.  The  Petitioner  has  made  several  appeals  to  the  Public  Service"
"Commission 
in 
respect  of  not 
receiving  his  allegedly  due  promotions"
"commencing from 23.03.2012. The decision of the Public Service Commission"
