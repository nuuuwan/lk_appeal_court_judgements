"In  the  final  common  ground  of  appeal,  the  Appellants  contended  that  the"
"Learned High Court Judge had not evaluated the defence evidence from the"
"correct perspective and rejected the same in in the wrong premise."
"In this case the Appellants and the 2nd Accused had made dock statements"
"to  conclude  their  case.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  at"
"page 1214 of the brief clearly expressed the admissibility of a dock statement"
"of an accused in a criminal trial and followed several tests to evaluate the"
"dock statements of each of the Appellants and the 2nd Accused."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  and  evaluated  the  Dock"
"Statement  of  the  Appellants  separately  before  he  could  come  to  the  final"
"decision."
"Although the 1st Appellant in his Dock Statement took up the position that"
"he had previously visited the  deceased’s  house, this vital position was not"
"put to PW1 when she was cross examined. Next, the 1st Appellant took up"
"the  position  that  the  cheque  for  Rs.  400,000/-  was  given  to  him  by  2nd"
"Accused to lease out a shop space in Trincomalee. As this also a vital piece"
"of evidence but the 1st Appellant had failed to put this position to the relevant"
"prosecution witnesses to iron out the issue raised by him."
"The 2nd Appellant in his Dock Statement  did not  deny his presence at the"
"crime scene. Although matters incriminatory against the 2nd Appellant was"
"revealed in his own confession made to the Magistrate, lack of explanation"
"of those matters led to the rejection of his Dock Statement by the Learned"
"High Court Judge."
"As the evidence adduced by the prosecution overweighted the defence case,"
"rejection  of  the  defence  by  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  quite  justifiable"
"and does not cause any prejudice either legally or circumstantially. Hence,"
"this Court has no option but to accept the prosecution’s version. Therefore,"
"this ground also has no merit."
