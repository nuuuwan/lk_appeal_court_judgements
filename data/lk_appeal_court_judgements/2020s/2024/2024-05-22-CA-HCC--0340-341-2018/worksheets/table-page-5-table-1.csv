"CA/HCC/0340-341/18"
"Relying solely on a single instance of circumstantial evidence for a conviction"
"is viewed cautiously by the courts, as it may not provide conclusive proof of"
"guilt. However, when multiple independent pieces of circumstantial evidence"
"point towards the same conclusion, their combined strength strengthens the"
"case for conviction. In such instances, the court is more likely to consider"
"the evidence as a cohesive whole, contributing to a more robust assessment"
"of the defendant's culpability."
"In order to convict an Accused person on the basis of circumstantial evidence"
"it is the duty of the trial judge to be satisfied that that the facts proved are"
"only consistent with the guilt of the Accused and the facts proved to exclude"
"every other possibility other than the guilt of the Accused."
