"It  was  his  position  that  there  was  a  high  possibility  that  due  to  various"
"animosities,  the  mother  of  PW-01  had  with  the  appellant,  she  may  have"
"instigated a false complaint against him in this manner. He was of the view that"
"the evasive nature of the motherâ€™s evidence (PW-03) supports such a contention."
"It was his position that it was only the PW-01 who has spoken about the incident"
"faced by her, and since her evidence was not cogent  enough to be  believed, it"
"was not safe to act on her evidence alone."
"It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  that"
"although  it  was  only  the  PW-01,  namely  the  victim  of  the  crime,  who  speaks"
"about the incidents faced by her, her evidence was cogent enough to act on that"
"alone."
"The learned DSG pointing out to the day of the incident and the time it took for"
"the  victim  to  come  and  give  evidence  before  the  High  Court  contended  that"
"discrepancies might occur when a witness gives evidence on an incident of this"
"nature. It was her position that when it comes to the facts and the circumstances"
"of the case under appeal, it is very much clear that discrepancies have occurred"
"not due to the fact that PW-01 was not telling the truth, but due to the passage"
"of time and also the present circumstances of PW-01."
"With the submissions made by the learned Counsel as well as the learned DSG"
"in mind, I will now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal urged together, as"
"they are interrelated."
"As I have stated before, this is an incident that occurred when the victim was a"
"14-year-old girl, where she has given evidence 16 years after the event. By that"
"time, she had been a married mother of two children and expecting her 3rd child."
"She has also been employed in a garment factory."
"It  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  her  evidence  needs  to  be  considered  in  that"
"context to find out whether the PW-01 is speaking about something that did not"
"occur due to being instigated by her mother as claimed by the appellant. I am of"
"the view that the marked contradictions of the evidence of PW-01 also needs to"
