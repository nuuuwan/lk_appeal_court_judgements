"The  appellant  has  only  made  a  short  statement  from  the  dock  stating  that"
"“රණ්ඩුවක්  උනා.  ප ාලිසියට  කියල  දූෂන  නුවක්  දැම්මා.  මම  දූෂනය  ගැන  දන්පන්  නැහැ.  රණ්ඩුවක්"
"පවච්ච එක ගැන නම් දන්නවා. එච්චරයි මට කියන්න තිපයන්පන්.”"
"The Grounds of Appeal"
"At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  the  learned  Counsel  formulated  the  following"
"grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court."
"1.  The discrepancy with regard to the date of the incident has not been"
"properly considered by the learned High Court Judge."
"2.  Veracity of the corroborative evidence given by the witnesses had not"
"been properly analyzed."
"3.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  evaluate  in  the  correct"
"perspective, the omissions, the contradictions in prosecution witnesses"
"and also the dock statement of the appellant."
"4.  The prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt."
"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"It was submitted by the learned Counsel that PW-01 has stated in her evidence"
"that she and her parents went to the police station on the day of the incident. It"
"was  his  submission  that  if  that  was  so,  since  the  police  statement  has  been"
"recorded on 14-12-2007, the date of offence should be the same, but according"
"to the indictment, the date of offence is 10-12-2007, and hence, the prosecution"
"has failed to prove the date of offence beyond reasonable doubt."
"He submitted several discrepancies of the evidence of PW-01 as to the incident"
"and also alleged inter se discrepancies in the evidence of the sister of  PW-01 who"
"is said to have been present when this incident occurred."
"The learned Counsel contended that although PW-01 has stated that it was the"
"grandmother who came to the place of the incident in her statement to the police,"
"not  calling  the  grandmother  as  a  witness  is  a  matter  that  should  have  been"
"considered in favour of the appellant."
