"legs  and  has  had  intercrural  sex  with  her.  When  she  started  shouting,  the"
"appellant has bolted from the scene."
"After  the  incident,  both  of  them  have  returned  home,  and  when  the  father"
"returned in the evening, she has narrated what happened to her. This has led"
"the  father    to  scold  the  appellant  using  filth.  After  her  mother  returned,  the"
"incident has been told to her, and both she and her sister have been taken to"
"the  police  station,  and  subsequently,  to  the  hospital,  where  a  doctor  has"
"examined her."
"It  has  been  her  evidence  that  when  inquired  by  the  doctor,  she  told  him  the"
"incident faced by her."
"According to the Medico Legal Report (MLR) marked X-01, she has been admitted"
"to  the  hospital  on  14-12-2007,  and  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (JMO)  has"
"examined her on the following day."
"Under cross-examination, she has maintained the position that they went to the"
"police station on the day of the incident, and the incident occurred after she and"
"her sister returned home from school. She has stated that she went to school on"
"that day and did not attend classes in Mathugama. She has insisted that since"
"they had no money, she only attended school, and the incident happened after"
"their return from school."
"The  defence  has  marked  two  contradictions  in  that  regard  as  V-01  and  V-02,"
"where the victim has stated to the police that she went to Mathugama to attend"
"classes and returned home at around 1.30 p.m. Another contradiction has been"
"marked as V-03 where she has stated to the police that she informed the incident"
"to  her  mother  after  she  returned  home  from  work,  which  was  contrary  to  her"
"stand when giving evidence that she informed it to her father first."
"It has been pointed out that she has not stated in her police statement that she"
"went near the well with her sister, which has been brought to the notice of the"
"Court as an omission."
