"n this regard, I refer to the observation made by the  Court of Appeal in"
"Nimal Weerasooriya Vs. Guruge Property Sales (Pvt.) Ltd4.,"
"“The suppression of the material facts by itself is sufficient ground to"
"refuse  an  Application  for  interim  relief  as  the  relief  so  sought  is  a"
"discretionary relief to be granted by the Court and the party seeking"
"such relief is manifestly duty bound to appraise Court of all material"
"facts.  A person seeking injunctive relief is required to make an honest"
"disclosure of all relevant facts  the failure of  which  would amount  to"
"abuse of process of Court.”"
