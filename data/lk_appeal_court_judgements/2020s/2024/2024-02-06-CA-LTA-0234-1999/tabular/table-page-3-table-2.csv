"appeal Application."
"ord Denning M.R. in Hubbard Vs. Vosper1 observed that;"
"“in considering whether to grant an interlocutory injunction, the right"
"course for a judge is to look at the whole case. He must have regard"
"not  only  to  the  strength  of  the  claim  but  also  to  the  strength  of  the"
"defence, and then decide what is best to be done. Sometimes, it is best"
"to grant an injunction so as to maintain the status quo until the trial."
"At other times it is best not to impose a restrain upon the defendant"
"but leave him free to go ahead.”"
