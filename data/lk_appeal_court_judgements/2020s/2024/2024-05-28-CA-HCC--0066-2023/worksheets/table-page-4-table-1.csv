"CA/HCC/0066/23"
"When a person accused of a crime pleads guilty or has been found guilty, the"
"judge orders a sentence.  The judge takes several factors into account when"
"deciding on a sentence, including the circumstances surrounding the crime"
"and the situation of the person who committed the crime."
"The sentence must be in proportion to the seriousness of the crime.  The law"
"establishes  how  serious  a  crime  is  by  providing  different  sentences  for"
"different  types  of  crimes.    This  means  lighter  sentences  for  less  serious"
"crimes  and  heavier  sentences  for  more  serious  crimes.    According  to  the"
"principle of fairness in sentencing, the sentence must be just."
"As in other countries, no sentencing guidelines have been formulated in our"
"jurisdiction.    Therefore,  sentencing  is  the  prerogative  of  the  court  in  our"
"jurisdiction."
"In  this  case  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  passed  13  years  rigorous"
"imprisonment on each count of rape and for the three counts the Appellant"
"was sentence to 39 years rigorous imprisonment.  As the Appellant pleaded"
"guilty  to  the  indictment,  the  Counsel  argues  that  the  sentence  imposed"
"against him was excessive."
"When  sentencing  in  individual  cases,  the  court  must  strike  a  balance"
"between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence"
"available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person."
"The maximum sentence for charge of statutory rape is 20 years. Imposing 13"
"years for each charge and ordering them to run consecutively to a period of"
"36 years for three statutory rape charge is not appropriate in this case."
"The Appellant pleaded guilty to the indictment thus saved valuable time of"
"the court. Further, the Appellant is a married person with two children."
"Considering all the factors into consideration, I think this is an appropriate"
"case to order the sentence impose to run concurrently. Therefore, we order"
"the 13 years of rigorous imprisonment for each count to run concurrently."
