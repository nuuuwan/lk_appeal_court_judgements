"ordered to pay to the victim by the Appellant with a default sentence of 02"
"years rigorous imprisonment."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  aforesaid  conviction  and  sentence  the  Appellant"
"preferred this appeal to this court."
"The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant"
"has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19"
"pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom from prison."
"At  the  very  outset  of  the  argument  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant"
"informed  this  Court  that  the  Appellant  is  only  contesting  the  sentence"
"imposed  to  run  consequently  in  relation  to  the  three  counts  where  the"
"Appellant had pleaded guilty."
"The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows."
"The prosecutrix in this case was living with her father and brother. According"
"to the prosecutrix, the incident happened in the year 2009. Her sister was"
"married  to  the  Appellant  and  was  blessed  with  a  child.  Though  her  sister"
"lived  separately  after  marriage,  but  came  to  her  father’s  house  and  lived"
"there. Appellant was worked as a mason. During the time relevant to this"
"incident, the victim’s sister was admitted to hospital due to some ailment in"
"her  stomach.  Using  this  opportunity  the  Appellant  had  raped  her  several"
"times."
"As the appellant threatened her that he would kill her brother and her father,"
"she remined silence until she was found pregnant."
"The victim was 12 years old when she was raped by the Appellant. She has"
"given evidence very clearly in her examination-in-chief. As it was a painful"
"trauma that she had undergone at a tender age, nobody can be expected to"
"disclose  all  the  facts  accurately.  As  this  was  a  direct  indictment  case,  the"
"victim had given evidence after 9 years since the date of offence."
