"In  the  instant  appeal,  we  observe  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  did  not"
"adequately evaluate the entirety of the evidence presented. Instead, there appears to have"
"been a selective consideration of portions of evidence from the entire proceedings, leading to"
"the conclusion that the Prosecution had substantiated its case."
"I hold that the evidence led by the Prosecution is insufficient to prove the guilt of the"
"Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, for the reasons outlined above, the judgment of"
"the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  dated  2019.03.21  is  set  aside.  Accordingly,  this  appeal  is"
"allowed, and the convictions entered, and sentences imposed upon the accused are set aside"
"and he is acquitted of all charges."
