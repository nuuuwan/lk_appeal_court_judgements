"case.”"
"During the trial the Medico Legal Report of the 1st Appellant and the DW3"
"were  marked  as  V16  and  V17  and  the  prosecution  had  admitted  the  said"
"reports."
"Considering the evidence presented by both parties, ample evidence surfaced"
"about  a  sudden  fight,  provocation  and  exceeding  the  right  of  self-defence."
"But this had completely escaped the consideration of the learned High Court"
"Judge."
"As pointed out above, the incident had happened close to the house of DW3"
"and the 1st Appellant. According to PW1, the place of incident is about 1.5"
"Km from their house. Hence, the reason for going to the place of incident by"
"the  deceased  and  prosecution  witnesses  were  not  explained.  Although  the"
"prosecution  witnesses  stated  that  the  1st  Appellant  sat  on  the  deceased’s"
"body and stabbed him, this was marked as an omission at the trial. The 1st"
"Appellant admitted that he attacked the deceased using a small knife and a"
"sword brought by the deceased to attack him and his daughter DW3. The"
"injuries  sustained  by  the  deceased,  the  prosecution  witnesses  and  the  1st"
"Appellant and his daughter had been placed before the trial."
