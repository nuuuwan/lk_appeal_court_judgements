"no  alternative  but  to  attack  the  deceased  and  his  party  at  his  daughter’s"
"house  to  save  his  life  and  the  life  of  his  daughter  DW3  Palika.  They  had"
"entered the house of DW3 with a katty and an axe and behaved in an abusive"
"manner.  After  hitting  the  1st  Appellant  on  his  head,  the  deceased  and  his"
"crowd had damaged the television and cabinet. Thereafter, his daughter was"
