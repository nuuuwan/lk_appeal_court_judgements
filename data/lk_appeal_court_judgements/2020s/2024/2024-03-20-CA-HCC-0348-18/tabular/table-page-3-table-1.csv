"He  and  witness  number  2  had  stayed  watch  on  Siemen’s  Road  and  they  had"
"arrested  the  appellant  who  had  been  coming  down  the  road  and  on  body"
"search  they  had  found  a  substance  they  suspected  to  be  heroin  in  his  right"
"trouser pocket."
"Witness  number  one  had  taken  the  substance  in  to  his  custody  and  had"
"arrested him and had taken to the vehicle where the other officers had been."
"Then they had proceeded to his house which had been in close proximity and"
"they had not found any offending article."
"They  had  returned  back  to  the  PNB  around  3.15  and  after  weighing  the"
"substance  he  had  found  around  3  grammes.  Thereafter  he  had  sealed  the"
"productions and he had duly signed and had got the signature of the appellant"
"as well."
"Thereafter he had kept it in his custody until the officer who was  in charge of"
"productions  had  returned  to 
the  PNB.  Once  he  returned  that 
is  witness"
"number 3, he had dully handed over the productions to him."
"Thereafter he had finished putting his notes."
"Hence the entire raid had been supervised and conducted by witness number"
"one  and  he  had  been  only  assisted  by  witness  number  2.  Hence  witness"
"number 1 had put his notes and had dully sealed the productions and handed"
"over prosecutions to PW3."
"The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the  appellant 
stated 
that 
the"
"prosecution by not calling witness number 2 the evidence of the raid had"
"not  been  corroborated  and  the  trial  judge  had  not  been  aware  of  this,"
"which has denied a fair trial to the appellant."
"At  this  point  we  draw  our  minds  to  the  recently  decided  case  by  the"
"Supreme  Court  SC  Appeal  154-2010 
in  which  Aluvihare  J  had  very"
"succulently  dealt  with  the  principle 
laid  down  in  section  134  of  the"
"Evidence Ordinance and quoted Sir John Woodruff and Syed Amir Ali (Law"
"of Evidence 1st Edition Vol 1 Page 601 -603,"
"“It  is  open  to  Court  to  accept  the  evidence  of  a  police  officer  and  to"
"convict  the  accused  on  the  basis  thereof,  if  the  evidence  of  the  police"
"officer 
is 
trust  worthy 
and 
reliable. 
If 
the  Court 
feels 
that 
the"
"uncorroborated  testimony  of  the  police  officer  by  itself  is  capable  of"
"inspiring  confidence  there  is  nothing  forbidding  the  Court  from  acting"
"upon 
it.  The 
law  does  not 
require 
that 
such  evidence 
should  be"
"corroborated……."
