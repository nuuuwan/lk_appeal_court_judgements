"Court  cannot  reject  the  evidence  of  witnesses  merely  because  they  are"
"government  servants….The  credibility  of  public  officers  should  not  be"
"doubted  on  suspicion  and  without  acceptable  evidence.”  and  he  has"
"continued to hold that “ in this context the failure to call PC Punchihewa"
"to testify in my view could not have given rise to an adverse inference…."
"Hence in the instant matter the prosecution had not called witness number 2"
"but  had  called  witness  number  one  and  he  had  been  the  chief  investigative"
"officer  but  the  recovery  of  the  goods  had  been  only  witnessed  by  witness"
"number 2 and the failure of the prosecution to call the witness does not create"
"an adverse effect on the prosecution if the evidence of PW1 can be relied upon."
"Hence merely because PW1 is a police officer his evidence need not  be doubted"
"merely based on his profession."
"If  the  trial  judge  is  satisfied  that  PW1  can  be  believed  and  his  demeanor  and"
"deportment in Court while giving evidence had been satisfactory there is no bar"
"to  accept  his  evidence  in  the  relevant  statute  under  which  the  appellant  has"
"been indicted."
"Hence  the  learned  president’scounsel’s  submission  on  behalf  of  the  appellant"
"that  the  trial  judge  had  not  called  for  corroboration  with  regard  to  the  raid"
"conducted  against  the  appellant  is  contrary  to  section  134  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance and is without merit."
"Upon  the  conclusion  of  the  evidence  of  PW1,  the  prosecution  had  led  the"
"evidence  of  the  Government  Analyst  who  had  said  in  evidence  that  the  report"
"pertaining  to  the  instant  matter  had  been  prepared  on  the  28.72003  and  the"
"productions had been received on the 24.2.2003 and the productions had been"
"sent back to Court on 8.8.2003."
"The  main  concerns  raised  by  the  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  with"
"regard to this evidence were that,"
