"","C.A. WRIT  NO. 635-21"
"23)","In  considering  the  aforesaid  facts  and  perusal  of  the  documents  filed  by"
"","the  Petitioner  there  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  the  said  dates  had  been"
"","given  by  the  1st  Respondent  in  favour  of  the  Defendants  in  case  No:"
"","M/1192/20."
"24)","Beside these facts, there is no evidence or documents before this Court to"
"","satisfy the work load of the District Court of Kesbawa and the context on"
"","which the dates are given. To consider this, at least the Roll Book and the"
"","Trial  and  Inquiry  Roll  should  be  considered.  Without  any  of  those  this"
"","Court cannot verify on the grounds  on which the specific dates had been"
"","given to the Petitioner and the Defendants."
"25)","Most 
often 
the  District 
Judges 
grants 
dates 
according 
to 
their"
"","Trial/Inquiry Roll and the Day Book.  Therefore, without considering those"
"","documents  there  is  no  evidence  to  prove  that  the  1st  Respondent  acted"
"","favouring the Defendants by granting long dates."
"26)","Although  the  Petitioner  had  stated  his  facts  in  54  paragraphs  on  the"
"","petition, most of the facts are repeated more than once."
"27)","With the available documents there is no suspicion that can be drawn that"
"","the 1st Respondent acted favourably towards the Defendants."
"28)","Furthermore,  the  Petitioner  had  drawn  the  attention  of  this  Court  that"
"","even  after  complaining  to  the  1st  Respondent  about  the  inconvenience"
"","which  he  encountered  with  the  court  staff,  the  1st  Respondent  had  not"
"","taken any consideration of the said complaints."
"29)","It is my considered view, that it is a matter for the 1st Respondent to give"
"","oral  direction  to  the  staff  and  there  is  no  sufficient  material  before  this"
"","Court that the 1st Respondent had not attended to it."
"30)","Other than this, the Petitioner had contended that the 1st Respondent had"
"","considered fraudulent documents tendered by the Defendants in case No:"
"","M/1192/20 
and 
the 
1st 
Respondent 
accepted 
additional 
written"
"","submissions made by the Defendants."
