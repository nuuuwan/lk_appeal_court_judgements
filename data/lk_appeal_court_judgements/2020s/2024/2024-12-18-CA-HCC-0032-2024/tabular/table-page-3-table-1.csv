"a  person  aggrieved  of  a  conviction  and  a  sentence  to  appeal  therefrom  to  the"
"Court of Appeal."
"This goes on to show that although the appellant absconded the Court, nor did"
"he retained the services of an Attorney-at-Law to represent him, he had followed"
"the  proceedings  before  the  Court  diligently  by  filing  the  appeal  soon  after  the"
"conviction and the sentence."
"When  this  matter  was  taken  up  for  argument  before  this  Court,  the  learned"
"Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  who  represented  the  appellant  informed  the  Court  that"
"although  his  client  has  preferred  this  appeal  against  his  conviction  and  the"
"sentence,  he  has  received  instructions  to  withdraw  the  appeal  against  the"
"conviction and only to challenge the sentence imposed upon him."
"Accordingly, upon the withdrawal,  the appeal against the conviction is hereby"
"dismissed."
