"In the case of Sudharman De Silva Vs. The Attorney General (1996) 1 SLR 9,"
"it was held;"
"“Section 14 of the Judicature Act has specifically endowed an accused who"
"is  convicted  with  a  substantive  right  of  appeal  and  this  right  of  appeal"
"cannot  be  taken  away  from  him  on  the  ground  that  he  had  been  acting"
"contumaciously or in defiance of the law. Contumacious conduct on the part"
"of an accused is relevant only where the exercise of a discretion vested in"
"the  Court  is  involved.  Here  the  right  to  appeal  is  statutory  and  can  be"
"asserted as of right by the accused although he had jumped bail and was"
"absconding at the trail.”"
