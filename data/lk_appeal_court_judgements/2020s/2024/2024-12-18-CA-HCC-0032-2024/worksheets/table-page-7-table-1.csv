"murder  in  such  a  situation.  I  find  no  basis  to  conclude  that  the  appellantâ€™s"
"behaviour was a result of any provocation or any sudden fight as claimed at the"
"hearing of this appeal."
"As clearly submitted by the learned DSG, there was no evidence placed before"
"the  Court  for  the  trial  Court  to  come  to  such  a  conclusion.  Although  it  was"
"contended  that  the  appellant  also  suffered  injuries  and  was  warded  at  the"
"hospital when he was initially remanded by the learned Magistrate of Tangalle,"
"and that fact should have been considered by the learned High Court Judge, I"
"find no basis agree to such a contention.  Clearly,  there was no such evidence"
"before the trial Court for the learned trial Judge to consider such a fact. Even if"
"it was brought to the attention of the learned trial Judge, I do not find it as a"
"basis  to  conclude  that  the  act  committed  by  the  appellant  should  fall  under"
"section 301 of the Penal Code."
"For a person who was found guilty for an offence in terms of section 300 of the"
"Penal Code, where hurt has been caused to the victim of the crime, the offender"
"shall be liable for a period of imprisonment of either description for a term which"
"may extend for 20 years, and shall also be liable to a fine."
"It is clear from the sentencing order that the learned High Court Judge has well"
"considered  the  relevant  facts  and  the  circumstances  when  the  appellant  was"
"sentenced  for  a  period  of  10  years  rigorous  imprisonment  other  than  the  fine"
"imposed and the compensation ordered."
"I am unable to agree that the sentence was excessive under any circumstances"
"given the facts and the circumstances relevant to the instant matter."
"I do not find the submission made to the effect that the appellant has received"
"burn injuries while working overseas and had to undergo treatment, as a reason"
"that should be considered applicable in order to consider  the  reduction of the"
"sentence imposed upon him, since such a reasoning cannot be justified in that"
"regard."
