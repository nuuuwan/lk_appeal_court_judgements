"was sent for analysis. Furthermore, it had been meticulously sealed separately."
"Therefore, the recovery of N2 and the non analysis of any heroin in N2 does not"
"create any reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution. It would have"
"certainly created a confusion in the case for the prosecution if the contents of"
"N1 and N2 had been mixed together and sealed. This has not been so in the"
"instant case."
"It has been said in the case of Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade and Anr. V State of"
"Maharashtra 1973 AIR 2622, 1974 SCR(1) 489, that “The cherished principles"
"of the golden thread of proof beyond reasonable doubt which runs through the"
"web of our law should not be stretched morbidly to embrace every hunch and"
"degree of doubt…. Or else any practical system of justice will breakdown and"
"lose credibility with the community.” which we think is very appropriate to be"
"mindful of at this stage."

"perusal of the three contradictions, we find that it has not gone to the root of"
"the case. Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that it had had no impact in"
