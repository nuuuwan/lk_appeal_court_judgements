"At that point they had seen the appellant coming out of the house and taking a"
"parcel from him. PW-01 and PW-02 had immediately taken steps, to take the"
"appellant into custody and PW-02, who was a woman Police Constable, had"
"body searched the appellant. While doing so,PW-02 had found the appellant"
"clutching a parcel in her hand. That particular parcel had been taken into"
"custody by PW-01. The substance inside the parcel, they had suspected to be"
"heroin and PW-01 had kept it in his custody until they had reached the Police"
"station."
"Thereafter, they had searched the appellantâ€™s house and from the kitchen, in a"
"bottle, they had found a powder which they suspected to be heroin. These two"
"parcels, recovered from the custody of the appellant and from her kitchen, had"
"been separately kept in the custody of PW-01 until they reached the police"
"station."
"Once they reached the Police station, the first parcel, taken from the custody of"
"the appellant, had been sealed separately as N1 and the second parcel, taken"
"into custody from the house of the appellant, had been sealed as N2."
"These two parcels, marked as N1 and N2, were put into one envelope and had"
"been sent to the Government analyst. The Government analyst, in evidence had"
"said that, N1 and N2 were separately sealed and that the seals had been intact."
"But the Government analyst had detected heroin only in the parcel marked as"
"N1 and not in N2."
"When PW-01 was led in evidence-in-chief, the existence of N2 was not revealed"
"in evidence. But during cross-examination of PW-01 the existence of N2 was"
"brought in."
"Therefore, the counsel for the accused-appellant submitted that the failure on"
"the part of the prosecution to lead evidence with regards to the existence of N2,"
"in evidence-in-chief and the Government analyst not detecting heroin in N2,"
"creates a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution."
"Evidence of PW-02 has also been led and she corroborates the evidence of"
"PW-01, but there were certain contradictions marked in evidence between"
"PW-01 and PW-02, which the trial judge had considered to be of no importance"
"because it has not gone to the root of the case."
"Thereafter, the case for the prosecution had closed and the appellant had made"
"a statement from the dock denying the whole incident."
"Having considered the submissions of both parties, it is the opinion of this"
"court that the argument of the learned counsel pertaining to the two parcels,"
"marked as N1 and N2, does not carry any weight because the said two parcels"
"had been kept separately from each other from the time of arrest and until it"
