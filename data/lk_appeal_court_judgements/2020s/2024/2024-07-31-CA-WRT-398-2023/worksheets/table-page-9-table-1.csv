"In the case of Eksath Engineru Saha Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya v. De Silva; 73 NLR 260"
"it was held as follows:"
"‘He submitted therefore that mandamus should not therefore issue ordering them"
"to  function as an Industrial Court as they were now not qualified to do so. I think"
"there is substance in this submission. Parties obviously cannot be ordered to do"
"what they are not qualified to do and are therefore unable to do. Lex non cogit ad"
"impossibilia. The application is therefore dismissed but without costs.’"
