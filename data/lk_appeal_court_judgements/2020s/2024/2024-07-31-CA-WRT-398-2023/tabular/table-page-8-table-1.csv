"respondent in fact consented to be placed in the salary scale of MA 2-2. Therefore, it is"
"the petitioner's contention that the said acceptance by the 4th respondent has estopped"
"him from claiming to be placed in the salary scale of MM 1-1 later."
"In that case, the 4th respondent fails to be entitled to the MM 1-1 salary scale. It can be"
"reasonably assumed that the 4th respondent accepted to be placed in the MA 2- 2 salary"
"scale as he was well aware that he cannot be placed at a different salary scale, specifically,"
"MM 1-1 salary scale as was sought by him."
"As the 2 maxims ‘lex non cogit ad impossibilia’ (the law does not compel the performance"
"of  what  is  impossible)  and  ‘ad  impossibilia  nemo  tenetur’  (no  one  is  bound  to  an"
"impossibility) state, it was impossible for the petitioner to place the 4th respondent at the"
"MM 1-1 salary scale due to the nonexistence of the position of 'Garden Controller’ in the"
"cadre of the petitioner and it was impossible for the 4th respondent to be entitled to the"
"MM 1-1 salary scale owing to his lack of educational qualifications."
