"officers and arrested and assaulted him and took him to the police station had"
"been  his  position.  He  has  denied  that  he  committed  any  sexual  abuse  on  the"
"victim."
"The Grounds of Appeal"
"At the hearing of this appeal, the learned President’s Counsel who represented"
"the appellant formulated the following ground of appeal for the consideration of"
"the Court."
"1.  PW-01’s  evidence,  when  taken  in  the  line  of  his  mother’s  and  the"
"doctor’s evidence clearly demonstrates that PW-01’s evidence was not"
"credible and the learned High Court Judge would not have acted upon"
"such evidence to convict the accused-appellant."
"The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"The learned President’s Counsel pointed to the commencement of the evidence"
"by the victim (PW-01) where he has stated several times that the appellant took"
"him inside the shop and showed his private part, and thereafter, he ran away"
"from the place."
"It was the position of the learned President’s Counsel that the victim has child"
"mentioned that the appellant held him by his hands and inserted his male organ"
"into  his  mouth  only  after  the  prosecuting  Sate  Counsel  put  some  leading"
"questions to the witness. He lamented that the learned High Court Judge has"
"failed to consider the obvious discrepancies in the victim child’s evidence as to"
"what really happened to him."
"Pointing to the evidence of the mother of the victim child, it was stated that the"
"child has come and told his mother that the appellant gave some chocolates or"
"toffees and committed this act on him, whereas, the child in his evidence has"
"stated  that  he  did  not  buy  toffees  from  the  appellant,  but  purchased  from"
"another shop."
