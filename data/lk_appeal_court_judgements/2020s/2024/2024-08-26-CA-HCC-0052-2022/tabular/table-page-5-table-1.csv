"was working away from home, and had gone and lodged a complaint  with the"
"police on the morning of the following day."
"It has been revealed at the cross-examination that the parents of the child have"
"initially taken the child to a private hospital and thereafter, on the advice of the"
"doctor at the hospital, had taken him to the Katthankudi Base Hospital where"
"he has been examined by the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO). The said JMO has"
"given  evidence  in  this  action  as  PW-04.  He  has  examined  the  child  on  07-08-"
"2009, some two and a half days after the incident. Although he has not observed"
"any visible marks as to a sexual assault or abuse, he has opined that an incident"
"of  the  nature  described  to  by  the  child    can  occur  without  any  marks  being"
"present and, therefore, cannot overrule such an incident."
"The JMO has given evidence as to the way he obtained the history of the incident."
"According to him, he had been unable to get a proper history of the incident from"
"the child. It had been his mother  (PW-02)  who has given the history. She has"
"stated that her son returned home around 7.00 p.m. on 04-08-2009, and she"
"noticed something different  in the boy and he was attempting to vomit. When"
"she questioned the child about his behavior, he has revealed to her that a person"
"from a nearby shop took him inside a room of the shop and thrust his penis into"
"the childâ€™s mouth."
"The police officers who conducted the investigations have also given evidence at"
"the trial."
"At the conclusion of the prosecution case, when the learned High Court Judge"
"called of a defence from the appellant, he has made a statement from the dock."
"He has stated that he was employed in a shop and while working there on the"
"day of the incident, a boy poked a stick, which resulted in the goods stacked in"
"the shop collapsing. Because of that, he got very angry and wanted to attack the"
"boy  with a pair of scissors.  It had been his position that the boy went away and"
"later came with his mother and another person and  threatened him. When he"
"went to the shop on the following morning, the same boy came with some police"
