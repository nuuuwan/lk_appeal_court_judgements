"Another  matter  that  needs  to  be  considered  is  the  defence  taken  up  by  the"
"appellant when he was called upon for a defence. He has taken the position that"
"because the boy was instrumental in the collapse of the stacked goods that were"
"on display in his shop, he got angry and attempted to stab him with a pair of"
"scissors, which resulted him going to his mother and complaining."
"However, it needs to be noted that when the child gave evidence, no such position"

"in that regard as well."
"It is trite law that when an accused person takes up a certain position as his"
"defence,  he  must  put  that  position  to  the  relevant  witnesses  so  that  they  can"
"respond to it. If a person comes out with a story for the first time when he was"
"called upon for a defence, that is also without giving evidence under oath, but"
"only as a dock statement, such a statement has little or no value."
"Although  it  was  contended  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to"

"well considered the evidence placed before the Court in coming to his findings."
"At  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  reproduce  the  proviso  of  Article  138  of  The"
"Constitution, which gives appellate powers of the Court of Appeal to determine"
"appeals, which reads thus;"
