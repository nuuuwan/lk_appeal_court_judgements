"stand taken up by the respondent as to her defence, the prosecution has failed"
"to establish the charge against the respondent beyond reasonable doubt."
"This is a case where the deceased person has suffered burn injuries over 90% of"
"the body. During the time relevant to the incident, he had been living with the"
"respondent as husband and wife. The respondent was a person who has worked"
"as a housemaid in a gulf country over several years and returned. She has had"
"9 children out of her legally married husband and at the time relevant to this"
"incident,  three  of  the  younger  children  of  her  marriage  were  also  living  in  the"
"house where this incident occurred."
"The house was a one built using wooden planks in a crowded housing area where"
"several small houses were adjacent to each other. It is common ground that the"
"deceased  was  a  habitual  drinker  of  alcohol  and  a  person  used  to  frequently"
"assault and quarrel with the respondent."
"According  to  the  evidence  of  their  immediate  neighbour,  on  the  day  of  the"
"incident as well, both of them had been quarrelling with each other until 2.00 –"
"2.30  in  the  morning.  Taking  it  no  more,  the  neighbour,  namely,  PW-04  has"
"shouted  at  them  from  her  home  to  keep  quiet,  saying  that  they  need  a  rest."
"Around  3.30  in  the  morning,  while  working  in  her  kitchen,  she  has  seen  the"
"house of the respondent on fire."
"The neighbours had gathered, and although they had made an attempt to douse"
"the  fire  it  has  failed,  and  the  entire  house  was  in  a  blaze.  She  has  seen  the"
"respondent  on  the  road  and  has  seen  the  deceased  coming  out  of  the  house"
"screaming. He has stated that ‘චන්ද්‍රාවතී මට ගිනි තිබ්බා,’ while running away from"
"the place."
"The evidence of several other witnesses who were present at that time was more"
"or less the same. The deceased has informed the police officer who recorded his"
"statement, the same thing."
