"The mentioned certified copy has been subsequently filed as a part of the case"
"record.  The  certified  copy  has  been  issued  on  15-11-2017.  The  journal  entry"
"made on 27-07-2017 of the High Court case, which was a day before the date"
"mentioned in the petition, indicates that the learned Counsel has filed a motion"
"requesting a certified copy of the case record."
"This clearly demonstrates that the petitioner has not taken necessary steps to"
"obtain a certified copy of the judgement as soon as the judgment was pronounced"
"in Court. This shows that what is stated in the petition to justify the failure of"
"the  petitioner  to  follow  the  due  process,  if  the  petitioner  was  aggrieved  by  the"
"acquittal, was not correct and it was only an excuse, which cannot be accepted."
"Be that as it may, since the matter was considered by this Court having listened"
"to both the parties, I will now proceed to consider whether the application made"
"in revision has any merit."
"The petition has been filed on the basis that the learned High Court Judge was"
"misdirected as to the relevant facts and the law when it was decided to acquit"
"the respondent of the charge preferred against her."
"The  respondent  was  indicted  before  the  High  Court  of  Avissawella  for  having"
"committed the following offence."
