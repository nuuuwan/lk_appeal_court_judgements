"such an action. It may very well even be that it was the deceased who set fire to"

"It is trite law that if a  given fact can be interpreted against an accused person"
"or in favour of an accused person, what favours an accused person has to be"
"considered."
"In the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe, S.I. Police Batticaloa, 38 CLW 95, it was"
"held  that;  where  the  same  facts  are  capable  of  an  inference  in  favour  of  the"
"accused and also of an inference against him, the inference consistent with his"
"innocence should be preferred."
"For  the  reasons  considered  as  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  even  if  sent  for  a"
"retrial,  given  the  facts  and  the  circumstances,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the"
"prosecution  stands  a  greater  possibility  of  securing  a  conviction  against  the"
"respondent."
"Accordingly, I find no basis to order a retrial or to allow this revision application."
"The application is dismissed for the reasons as considered above."
"The  Registrar  of  the  Court  is  directed  to  communicate  this  order  to  the  High"
"Court of Avissawella for information."
