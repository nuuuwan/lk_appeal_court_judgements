"â€œA tribunal which has made findings of fact wholly unsupported by evidence"
"or which it has drawn inferences wholly unsupported by any of the facts found"
"by  it  will  be  held  to  have  erred  in  point  of  law. The  concept  of  error  of  law"

"wrong legal test to the facts found taking irrelevant considerations into account"
"and arriving at a conclusion without any supporting evidence. If reasons are"
"given and these disclose that an erroneous legal approach has been followed"
"the superior Court can set the decision aside by certiorari for error of law on"
"the  face  of  the  record.  If  the  grounds  or  reasons  stated  disclose  a  clearly"
