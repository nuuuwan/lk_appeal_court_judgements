"18.03.2013, almost five years before the application was submitted. Serious concern"
"has to be drawn to the issue as to why the Petitioner tendered such an obsolete plan"
"(P12) along with his application and why the authorities accepted such. Accordingly,"
"the possibility of changing the ground situation within the 500-meter radius from"
"the licensed premises by the effluxion of such a considerable period of time itself"
"could have been a compelling reason to proceed with Rule 13(h)."
