"The  Petitioner  has  taken  up  a  position  that  although  the  said 
letter  P15/R4"
"mentioned that they were in receipt of the public complaints against the Petitioner,"
"he was not informed about any such complaints or the particulars thereof. However,"
"it  is  observed  that  said  letter  which  was  copied  to  the  Petitioner  referred  to the"

"Notification No.902[Rules 13(h) and 21], this Court finds that calling such a survey"
"report  is  only  a  primary  step  of  a facts-finding  task  in the investigation  into  the"
"alleged  violation  of  the distance  rule.  Hence,  there  is  no  rigid  rule  to  inform  the"
"Petitioner about such complaints received by the Commissioner prior to conducting"
"the survey as per Rule 13(h)of the Excise Notification No.902. Even though there is"
"no legal requirement to inform the Petitioner of complaints received, I believe that"
"the reference to public complaints in letter P15/R4 is enough notification to meet"
"the principles of natural justice and to give sufficient notice to the Petitioner prior to"
"conducting the survey report."
"Further,  the  Petitioner  claims  that  the 
failure  on  the  part  of  the  respective"
"Respondents to notify public complaints to the Petitioner is a violation of Rule 21 of"
"Excise Notification No. 902. I am mindful of the requirement of notification to the"
"licensee  (Petitioner)  of  any  objection  or  protest  received  by  the  Commissioner"
"General of Excise set out in Rule 21 of Excise Notification No. 902. However, such"
"requirement to notify only arises before conducting an inquiry as specified in Rule"
"21  and  not  before preparing  a  survey  plan 
in  terms  of  Rule  13(h)  of  Excise"
