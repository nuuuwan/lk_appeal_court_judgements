"had  been  sent  to  the  Hon.  Attorney  General  to 
indict  the  suspect."
"Thereafter,  the  learned  Magistrate  has  directed  to  produce  the  suspect"
"physically  on  7th  October  2024  before  the  Magistrate  Court.  It  is  to  be"
"noted  that  when  the  matter  is  referred  to  the  Hon.  Attorney  General  to"
"indict the suspect according to the quantity mentioned in the Government"
"Analyst Report, the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to deal with the suspect."
"Section 115(2) reads as follows:"
"“The Magistrate before whom a suspect is forwarded under this section, if"
"he is satisfied that it is expedient to detain the suspect in custody pending"
"further 
investigation,  may  after 
recording  his 
reasons,  by  warrant"
"addressed to the superintendent of any prison authorize the detention of the"
"suspect  for  a  total  period  of  fifteen  days  and  no  more.  The  provisions  of"
"section 264 shall apply to every such warrant. If at the end of the said period"
"of fifteen days proceedings are not instituted the Magistrate may subject to"
"subsection (3) either discharge the suspect or require him to execute a bond"
"to appear if and when so required.”"
"In the instant matter, the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to release"
"the suspect on bail. As this is a case referred to the Attorney General to"
"indict  the  suspect, 
it 
is  obvious  that  the 
learned  Magistrate  cannot"
"discharge  the  suspect.  Therefore,  the  learned  Magistrate  could  not  take"
"any step in terms of 115(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The law"
"requires  to  extend  the  period  of  remand  every  fifteen  days  until  the"
"investigations are completed and after completing investigations, no such"
"requirement is specified in the CCPA. Hence, not extending the period of"
"remand in fifteen days after completing the investigations is not an illegal"
"detention. In any case, if there is an issue of illegal detention, the Supreme"
"Court is the appropriate forum to raise it."
