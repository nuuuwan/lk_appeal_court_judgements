"The Partitioner has given evidence in the court and has claimed that he"
"was  unaware  of  the  crime  being  committed  as  he  has  employed  the"
"Accused  as  a  driver  of  the  vehicle.  The  Petitioner  has  given  specific"
"instructions to the Accused not to use the vehicle for the illicit transport"
"of sand, timber and other items which need permits. Further, he used"
"to contact the Accused daily in the evening to ascertain and assess the"
"happenings regarding the hires and related matters for the day."
"The  representative  of  the  leasing  company  giving  evidence  said  that"
"they  had  conducted  an  inquiry  in  this  regard  but  the  inquiry  did  not"
"reveal  that  the  illegal  timber  transportation  had  happened  with  the"
"consent of the Petitioner."
"The  father  of  the  Petitioner  giving  evidence  stated  that  the  vehicle  in"
"question was purchased to transport lime stones. At the initial stages,"
"this  witness  and  the  Petitioner  had  driven  the  vehicle.  As  their  lime"
"stones business was not successful, they appointed the Accused as the"
"driver of the vehicle. Although this witness employed as a watcher in an"
"estate, he used to check the vehicle and was vigilant about the vehicle."
"After  this  incident,  the  Accused  had  been  terminated.  He  refutes  the"
"suggestion that the driver of the vehicle is a close relation of him."
"The  Accused  also  gave  evidence  and  admitted  that  he  transported"
"timber  without  the  permission  of  the  Petitioner  or  his  father.  He  also"
"said that the Petitioner had given instructions not to use the vehicle for"
"any illegal activities."
"The Learned Magistrate has dismissed the application on the basis that"
"the Petitioner had failed to show that he took all necessary precautions"
"to prevent a crime being committed."
"Further, the Accused was working as the driver since 2007. During this"
"period there was no complaint about misusing the vehicle."
