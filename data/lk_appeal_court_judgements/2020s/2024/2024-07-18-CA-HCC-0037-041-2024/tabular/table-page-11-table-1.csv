"of  section  15B  of  the  Antiquities  Ordinance,  refers  to  the  one  and  the  same"
"offence mentioned in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd count in the indictment."
"The difference being that the 1st, 2nd, and the 3rd count under section 410 of the"
"Penal Code, while the 4th and the 5th count under a  separate statute, namely"
"under the Antiquities Ordinance, which provides for the charging of an accused"
"under a specific statute for offences alleged to have been committed under the"
"same corresponding provisions of the Penal Code."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  although  the  appellants  have  pleaded  guilty  to  all  the  5"
"counts preferred against them, when sentencing, the learned High Court Judge"
"should have considered the 4th and the 5th count as alternate counts to the 1st,"
"2nd  and  3rd  count,  since,  if  not,  it  would  be  amounting  to  sentencing  the"
"appellants twice for the same offence, although under two different statutes."
"Under the aforementioned circumstances, I am of the view that sentencing the"
"appellants to serve the sentences imposed upon them concurrently to each other"
"would have been the justifiable sentence that should have been passed on them."
"Accordingly, I hold that the respective separate jail sentences imposed upon the"
"accused-appellants shall be served concurrently to each other."
"Accordingly, I vary the sentencing order dated 14-12-2023 pronounced by the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Kurunegala  by  adding  the  directive  that  the"
"sentences imposed upon the accused-appellants shall be served concurrently to"
"each other."
"It was brought to the notice of the Court that although the appellants preferred"
"this appeal challenging the sentence, they are still under the prison custody as"
"their bail pending appeal applications have not been taken up for consideration"
"up until the time this matter was argued."
"Hence, acting in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No."
"25  of  2024,  it  is  directed  that  the  period  of  imprisonment  the  appellants  now"
