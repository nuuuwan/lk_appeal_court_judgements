"follow the aforesaid Cabinet Decision. According to the Respondent, the"
"rationale  of 
the  Cabinet  Decision  and  Circular 
is 
to  get  back 
the"
"contribution made by the State in respect of the relevant employees when"
"they were not in a pensionable post."
"The Petitioner contends that the said Circular P11 has been designed to"
"take away the benefits obtained by the Petitioner in the above-mentioned"
"Supreme Court case and the same is a clear violation of the provisions of"
"the  Divineguma  Act.  However,  a  Cabinet  Decision  cannot  override  a"
"settlement  entered  before 
the Supreme  Court.  Because,  as  per 
the"
"Supreme Law of the Country: the Constitution and as per the principles of"
"separation of powers, it is only the legislature that could keep a check on"
"the judiciary and not the executive. The Cabinet of Ministers, being an arm"
"of the Executive under the Constitution, is not vested with the power to"
"overturn a decision arrived at by the Supreme Court."
"However, 
it 
is  observed  that  the  above  Cabinet  Decision  [R4(b)]  was"
"followed by the Cabinet Memorandum dated 24.08.2018 [R4(a)] which was"
"forwarded  for  the  approval  of  the Cabinet  referred  to the  settlement"
"reached before the Supreme Court on 23.10.2018. Further, it is important"
"to  note  that  Term  03  of  the  settlement  [P7]  before  the  Supreme  Court"
"specified  that  any  release  of  money  lying  to  the  credit  of  employees'"
"accounts of EPF is subject to applicable law. As concluded above, prior to"
"sending an employee on a pension, they should refund the Government"
"contribution to the EPF when required to do so as per Section 48E(a) of the"
"Minutes  of  Pension.  Hence,  Circular  P11 
that  had  been 
issued 
in"
"compliance with the applicable law, cannot be considered as a violation of"
"Settlement  P7.  Consequently,  superseding  of  settlement  reached  before"
"the Supreme Court by a Cabinet Decision would not arise."
"The  Respondents  in  their  Statement  of  Objections  have  stated  that  the"
"Petitioners except the 5th Petitioner filed an application bearing No. SCFR"
"/144/2019 before the Supreme Court moving to have the Cabinet Decision"
"dated 23.10.2018 [R4b] quashed. It has also been indicated that such an"
"application was refused at the leave stage by the Supreme Court. However,"
"it is observed that the Respondents have not taken due diligence to place"
"materials before this Court to substantiate its said position."
