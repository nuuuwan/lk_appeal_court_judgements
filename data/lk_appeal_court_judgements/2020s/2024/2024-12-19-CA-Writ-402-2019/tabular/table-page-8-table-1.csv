"The Relevancy of the Settlement before the Supreme Court"
"However, 
the  1st 
to  4th  Petitioners  have  filed  a  Fundamental  Rights"
"Application 
bearing  No.SC/FR/252/2015 
before 
the Supreme 
Court"
"claiming  that  their  fundamental  rights  had  been  violated  due  to  their"
"contribution money in the EPF not being fully released to them. The parties"
"in the above application have reached a settlement[P7]. According to the"
"said  settlement  outlined 
in  P7,  the  entire  balance  of  money 
in  the"
"individual accounts of employees' EPF (Employee Provident Fund) will be"
"released after deducting necessary payments for the W&OP (Wages and"
"Overtime Payments), as well as any accrued interest. This deduction will"
"also include any loan or advance amount obtained by employees under the"
"EPF Act, along with the interest on those amounts."
"The Respondents have taken up a stance that although approval from the"
"Cabinet for settling litigatory matters is required before proceeding with a"
"settlement, in the above Supreme Court case bearing No.SC/FR/252/2015,"
"Cabinet approval has not been obtained before reaching such a settlement."
"However,  it  is  observed  from  settlement  P7  that  the  above  application"
"before  the  Supreme Court  was  settled  on  the  terms  as  indicated  by  the"
"relevant Minister. The Attorney General's representation as the Chief Legal"
"Adviser of the Government had also been there. Further, it appears that"
"the Respondents have not taken any steps to seek any clarification or to"
"inform the Supreme Court after the settlement, of any alleged mistake in"
"reaching the settlement."
"It is observed that subsequently the above situation has been brought to"
"the notice of the Attorney General by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public"
"Administration by his letter dated 06.01.2017[P9(a)] and that advice has"
"been sought on how to implement the terms of settlement entered before"
"the Supreme Court. The Attorney General has responded to this letter by"
"its 
letter  dated  08.02.2017  [P9(b)]  stating  that  the  relevant  terms  of"
"settlements were submitted to the Court on the written instructions of the"
"relevant Minister and the relevant parties have been instructed to follow"
"the settlement. It is noted that the aforementioned letter [P9(b)] does not"
"indicate any obstacles to the implementation of the above settlement. As"
"per the said settlement, the contribution to the EPF has been released to"
"the relevant employees."
