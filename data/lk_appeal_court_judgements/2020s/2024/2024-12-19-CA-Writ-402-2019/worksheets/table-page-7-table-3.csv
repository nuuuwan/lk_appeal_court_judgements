"with simple interest on such sum at four per centum per"
"annum from the date he received payment of that sum."
"I
 am  of the  view  that  the term “other benefit paid to him” includes any"
"statutory contributions such as EPF. Said Section 48E(a) also supports the"
"stance taken up by the Respondents that the employees cannot obtain two"
"different  benefits  [pension  entitlement  and  EPF]  awarded  at  the  end  of"
"their employment for the same period of time as it is against public policy."
"Accordingly, prior to sending an employee on a pension, they are subject"
"to a refund of the Government contribution to the EPF when required to"
"do so as per Section 48E(a) of the Minute of Pensions."
