"vacant position on 16.01.2023."
"The Petitioner has challenged the particular gazette notification No. 2240/26 dated 12th"
"August  2021  on  the  basis  that  there  is  a  long  delay  to  fulfil  the  Public  purpose  of"
"constructing an anchorage at Maradana Beruwala. On the other hand, the Respondent"
"has  stated that,  subsequent to  the survey  conducted  by the  Survey Department  on  the"
"request of the 2nd Respondent they have come to know that, the extent of land which was"
"to  be  acquired  had  been  greater  in extent  than  the  portion  of  land  that  was  originally"
"depicted in the said notice. Therefore, steps were taken to exhibit a fresh notice, regarding"
"to the additional portion of the land. According to the Grama Niladhari who has informed"
"the 2nd Respondent, that the notice was purportedly exhibited. Further the Respondents"
"have pleaded that, the anchorage which was primarily constructed adjacent to the coast"
"line and established in the impugned land had been declared open on 20.01.2016. They"
"have further stated that, since a larger land to be acquired, there had been a requirement"
"to obtain fresh assessment of expenditure with regard to the acquisition of the said land."
"Therefore, they sought approval under financial regulation No 53 for the revision of the"
"valuation of the land. They admit the fact that, between 2015 to 2021 there were multiple"
"administrative issues that has to be looked into by the relevant officials which resulted"
"the  delay  to  complete  the  project.  According  to  the  Respondent,  they  have  utilized  the"
"portion of land (described in the earlier notice)  for the purpose for which it was acquired."
"The  main  argument  put  forward  by  the  Petitioner  was  that,  since  no  steps  have  been"
"taken by the Respondent to construct the anchorage, there was no need for the minister"
"to act under section 38A of the Land Acquisition Act to take over the immediate possession"
"on the ground of urgency."
"Section  38A-  Immediate  possession  of  certain  lands  acquired  for  the  purposes  of  local"
"authorities."
