"petitioner."
"I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when section"
"30 of the Judicature Act and section 9(b)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act"
"were  considered  when  issuing  of  notice  to  the  respondents  mentioned  in  the"
"application before the High Court was refused."
"I find that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the provisions of"
"section  55(1)  of  the  Judicature  Act,  which  is  the  provision  as  to  contempt  of"
"Court proceedings before a Magistrateâ€™s Court, in its correct perspective."
"Section 30 of the Judicature Act provides the forum jurisdiction for a Magistrate"
"to perform and exercise all powers and duties, which a Magistrate is empowered"
"to exercise and perform by virtue of the provisions of the Penal Code or of the"
"law relating to criminal procedure or any other enactment for the time being in"
"force."
"However, it needs to be noted that the Judicature Act in itself has provided for a"
"specific provision in relation to the matters of contempt of Court under section"
"55(1) of the Act. In such a scenario, I find that it is only in terms of section 55(1),"
"a Magistrate can gain jurisdiction in relation to matters of contempt of Court."
"It is the view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge has applied section"
"9(b)(i)  to  justify  the  actions  of  the  learned  Magistrate  without  any  acceptable"
"basis."
"The relevant section 9(b)(i) reads as follows."
