"(b) The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  erred  in  law  by  concluding  after"
"analyzing section 9(b)(i), that the Fort Magistrate has the power to order"
"an investigation regarding the alleged offence. The Hon. Magistrate has"
"no jurisdiction under section 55(1) of the Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978"
"to take cognizance of the alleged contempt of Court committed outside"
"of the Magistrate’s Court."
"(c)  Without prejudice to the above, since the impugned press conference"
"took  place  in  the  Maradana  police  area  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Maligakanda  Magistrate’s  Court,  the  Magistrate’s  Court  of  Colombo"
"Fort has no territorial jurisdiction in view of section 9(b)(i) of the Code"
"of Criminal Procedure Act."
"(d) The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by failing to consider"
"that exceptional circumstances are not required in the circumstances"
"of this case as there is no right to appeal from the impugned order of"
"the learned Magistrate."
