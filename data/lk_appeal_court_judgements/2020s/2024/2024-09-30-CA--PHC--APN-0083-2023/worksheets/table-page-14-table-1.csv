"It  was  submitted  that  the  learned  Magistrate  had  no  jurisdiction  under  the"
"contempt of Court provisions or the territorial jurisdiction to determine on the"
"alleged  statement  made  by  the  Attorney-at-Law  on  07-06-2023  when  the"
"impugned order was made."
"The learned President’s Counsel also referred to the fact that in the order, the"
"learned Magistrate has named several persons including the petitioner ordering"
"the CID to conduct investigations in relation to the alleged contempt of Court,"
"whereas, in the statement made before the open Court, the Attorney-at-Law has"
"referred to only one person. He was of the view that the learned Magistrate may"
"have acted on some prior knowledge when he made this order, which, according"
"to him, was not an order the learned Magistrate had jurisdiction to make."
"The facts submitted to this Court reveal that the impugned order dated 07-06-"
"2023  in  relation  to  the  alleged  contempt  of  Court  has  been  based  on  a  press"
"conference held in Maradana area. This goes on to show that the alleged incident"
"had occurred not in the presence of the Court or committed in the course of any"
"act or proceeding of the said Court."
"As correctly pointed out by the learned President’s Counsel, if any contempt has"
"been committed by the persons mentioned in the order of the learned Magistrate,"
"the relevant provision under which the Magistrate’s Court can take cognizance"
"of such contempt of Court is section 55(1) of the Judicature Act of No. 02 of 1978"
"as amended by the Amendment Act No. 16 of 1989."
"The relevant section 55(1) reads as follows."
