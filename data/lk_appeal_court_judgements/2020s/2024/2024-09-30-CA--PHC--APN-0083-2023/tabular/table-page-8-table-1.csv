"When  this  matter  was  taken  up  for  consideration  before  this  Court,  it  was"
"intimated to the Court by the learned State Counsel who represented the 1st to"
"4th respondent-respondents that after the completion of the inquiry against the"
"1st  and  2nd  suspect-respondents,  they  have  been  now  discharged  from  the"
"proceedings  of  the  Magistrate’s  Court  as  it  has  been  decided  to  not  prosecute"
"them for the alleged offences mentioned in the B-report."
"However, the learned President’s Counsel who represented the petitioner of this"
"matter  urged  the  Court  to  consider  the  application  before  the  Court  and"
"pronounce  a  judgment  as  required,  since  the  orders  made  by  the  learned"
"Magistrate of Colombo Fort, sought to be challenged in this revision application"
"are still in force."
"The  facts  placed  before  this  Court  reveals  that  when  the  matter  where  the  1st"
"and 2nd suspect-respondents were produced before the Magistrate’s Court from"
"remand custody on 07-06-2023 was mentioned, the CID has informed the Court"
"that the investigations have not been concluded, while the learned President’s"
"Counsel who represented the suspects sought bail for them."
"At that juncture, submissions have been made by another Counsel on the basis"
"that he is representing the party aggrieved. Yet another Counsel has appeared"
"before the Court informing that he is representing a person from an organization"
"called Sinhala Rawaya, and has informed the Court that after the two suspects"
"in relation to the case were remanded, a person called Widarshana Kannangara"
"has  conducted  a  press  briefing  and  had  conducted  a  media  circus  by  making"
"comments,  criticizing  the  remanding  of  the  two  suspects  which  amounts  to"
"contempt of Court.  Making extensive submissions in that regard and by filing a"
"video recording of the alleged press conference, he has stated that several others"
"had also participated in the said press conference and that he can also produce"
"photographs. He has urged the Court to conduct an investigation in that regard."
