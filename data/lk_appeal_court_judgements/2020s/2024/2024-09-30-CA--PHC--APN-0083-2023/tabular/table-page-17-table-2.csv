"summon  all  criminals  and  offenders  and  deal  with  them"
"according to law;"
"There cannot be any argument as to the jurisdiction a Magistrate will have as"
"provided for by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and other"
"applicable  statutes.  However,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  for  the  purposes  of"
"administration  of  justice,  Sri  Lanka  has  been  divided  into  Judicial  Zones,"
"Judicial Districts and Judicial Divisions. It is undoubted that the Magistrate’s"
"Court of Colombo Fort comes within the Judicial Division of Colombo, but has"
"been  assigned  to  perform  functions  of  a  Magistrate  in  relation  to  a  particular"
"area within the said Judicial Division."
"It  is  an  admitted  fact  that  the  alleged  press  conference  has  taken  place  in"
"Maradana area, which falls under the jurisdiction of the  Magistrate’s Court of"
"Maligakanda."
"Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Colombo  Fort  had  no"
"jurisdiction to order an investigation or inquiry as it was ordered, in relation to"
"an alleged offence that has been admittedly committed within an area of another"
"Magistrate’s  Court’s  jurisdiction.  Even  if  an  information  is  provided  to  the"
"learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort in relation to an offence, the directive would"
"have been to report facts before the relevant Magistrate under whose jurisdiction"
"the offence has been committed and obtain orders from that Magistrate’s Court."
"I am of the view that the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort was acting without"
"jurisdiction when the relevant orders were made to the CID and to the Computer"
"Crimes Investigation Division to conduct a thorough investigation."
