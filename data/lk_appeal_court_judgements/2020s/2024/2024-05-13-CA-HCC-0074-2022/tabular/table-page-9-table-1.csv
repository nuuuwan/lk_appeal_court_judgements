"These portions of the judgment clearly demonstrate that the Appellant had"
"not afforded a fair trial."
"In  this  case  the  raid  was  conducted  on  an  information  received.  Further,"
"recovery and weighing the production has failed to pass the probability test"
"in this case. If the Learned Trial Judge had examined the evidence presented"
"from  the  correct  perspective,  she  would  have  been  inclined  to  accept  the"
"testimony provided by the Appellant."
"Further,  the  Appellant  was  not  afforded  a  fair  trial  as  guaranteed  in  the"
"Constitution."
