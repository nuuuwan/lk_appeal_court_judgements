"CA/HCC/74/22"
"Guided  by  the  above  cited  judicial  decisions,  I  conclude  that  the  appeal"
"grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant  has  a  very  serious  impact  on  the"
"prosecution case."
"As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable"
"doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High"
"Court Judge of Colombo dated 20/07/2021 on the Appellant. Therefore, he"
"is acquitted from this case."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
