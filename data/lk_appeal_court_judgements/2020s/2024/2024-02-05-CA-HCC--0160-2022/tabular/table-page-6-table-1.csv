"charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner"
"in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that"
"purpose."
"In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat (supra) the court held further:"
"“In  regard  to  exact  time  of  an  incident,  or  the  time  duration  of  an"
"occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the"
"spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect"
"people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.”"
"“It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.”"
"In R. v. Dossai 13 Cr.App.R. 158 the court held that:"
"“A date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is"
"an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be convicted"
"although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other"
"than  that  specified  in  the  indictment.  Amendment  of  the  indictment  is"
"unnecessary,  although  it  will  be  good  practice  to  do  so  (provided  that"
"there is no prejudice below) where it is clear on the evidence that if the"
"offence was committed at all, it was committed on the day other than"
"that specified.”"
"As the Appellant had been given sufficient notice regarding the date of offence"
"under  which  he  had  been  indicted  and  led  plausible  evidence  through"
"witnesses  regarding  the  period,  I  conclude  that  this  has  not  caused  any"
"prejudice or failure of justice as the Appellant had raised a totally different"
"issue  in  the  trial.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  had"
"addressed  this  issue  very  correctly  to  come  to  his  decision.  The  relevant"
"portion of the judgment is re-produced below:"
