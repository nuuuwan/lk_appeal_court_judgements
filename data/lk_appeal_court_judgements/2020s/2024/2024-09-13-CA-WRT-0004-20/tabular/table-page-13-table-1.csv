"","of  Prohibition  prayed  in  the  prayer  of  the  petition.  Hence,  I  reject"
"","the preliminary objections raised by the 1st Respondent."
"58)","Having fulfilled all the obligations preferred by the 1st Respondent"
"","to  grant  a  deed  for  the  property  referred  to  the  schedule  to  the"
"","petition. The first 1stRespondent had failed the duty cast upon him"
"","to execute a deed for the said subject matter."
"59)","The only excuse provided by the 1st Respondent is in paragraph 12"
"","of the statement of objections that the 1st Respondent is unable to"
"","execute a deed due to a land dispute between the Petitioner and a"
"","neighbour, related to the subject matter."
"60)","Nonetheless, as I have mentioned before, I have decided there is no"
"","land  dispute  related 
to 
the  subject  matter  referred 
to 
in 
the"
"","schedule  to  the  petition.  And  there  is  no  document  to  support  a"
"","land  dispute 
to 
the  property  referred 
to 
the  schedule 
to 
the"
"","petition."
"61)","Thus, it is evident the 1st Respondent for no given reason delaying"
"","the  execution  of  the  deed  to  the  property  referred  to  the  schedule"
"","to the petition."
