"","C.A. WRIT 
04 - 2020"
"","Petitioner.  And  for  the  said  assessment  numbers  Petitioner  had"
"","made tax payment as evident by P7 (b) to P7 (e) receipts."
"50)","Further,  by  P8  document  it  is  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  is  a"
"","listed voter for the assessment number referred to in the property"
"","related to the schedule to the petition."
"51)","Subsequently,  the  Land  Reform  Commission  had  issued  letters,"
"","marked as P9 (a), P9 (b) and P9(c) to resurvey the same allotments"
"","again to confirm the boundaries."
"52)","Considering 
the 
aforesaid 
facts, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
1st"
"","Respondent  had  already  surveyed  the  allotments  and  valued  the"
"","said allotments for the occupants to make the relevant payments."
"53)","Considering the said valuation, the Petitioner had made payments"
"","to  the  1st  Respondent  by  P2  (a)  and  P2  (b)  receipts  and  the  1st"
"","Respondent had accepted it."
"54)","Therefore,  I  see  no  reason  why  the  1st  Respondent  should  not"
"","execute  the  deed  for  the  allotments  referred  to  in  the  schedule  to"
"","the petition, as claimed by the Petitioner."
"55)","On perusal of document P10 the Petitioner has taken steps to send"
"","a letter of demand to the 1st Respondent to execute a deed for the"
"","allotment  referred  to  in  the  schedule  to  the  petition  for  which  the"
"","1st Respondent had failed."
"56)","Thus, 
I  am  of 
the  view 
that 
the  Petitioner  has  a 
legitimate"
"","expectation  to  obtain  the  deed  to  the  said  allotment  from  the  1st"
"","Respondent."
