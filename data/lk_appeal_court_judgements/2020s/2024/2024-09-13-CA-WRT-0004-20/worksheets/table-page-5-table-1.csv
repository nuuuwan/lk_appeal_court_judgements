"Objections of the 1st Respondent",""
"16)","The 1st Respondent  raised a preliminary objection on the grounds"
"","that  the  Petitioner  is  not  legally  or  factually  entitled  to  maintain"
"","the present action."
"17)","Further,  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  bring  the  necessary  parties"
"","before this court."
"18)","Therefore, 
this  application 
is  bad 
in  Law. 
  And 
cannot  be"
"","maintained."
"19)","Further,  the  1st  Respondent  had  contended  that  the  Petitioner  is"
"","not  entitled  in  Law  to  invoke  discretionary  remedies  and  that  the"
"","Petitioner has failed ex facie to disclose any statutory entitlements"
"","to  obtain  the  land  in  dispute  and/or  statutory  obligation  on  the"
"","part of the 1st Respondent."
"20)","Furthermore, 
the  1st  Respondent  had  stated 
that 
there 
is  a"
"","boundary dispute between the Petitioner and a neighbouring party."
"21)","Therefore, the 1st Respondent is unable to alienate the allotted land"
"","to the Petitioner."
"22)","On the said grounds, the 1st Respondent had moved to dismiss the"
"","application made by the Petitioner."
