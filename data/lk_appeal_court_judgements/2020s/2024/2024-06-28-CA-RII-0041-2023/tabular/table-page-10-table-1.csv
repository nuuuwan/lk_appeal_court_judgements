"v.  Pedrick  Singho  and  others4  that  ‘the  question  whether  delay  is  fatal  to  an"
"application in revision depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. If the"
"impugned order or that part of the judgement is manifestly erroneous and is likely"
"to cause grave injustice, the Court should not reject the application on the ground"
"of delay alone.’"
"Further, it was held that ‘whenever the order challenged disclose a miscarriage of"
"justice which shocks the conscience of Court and it had deprived a right of a party,"
"justice of the case requires the use of the discretion of Court to excuse the delay in"
"coming to court5.’"
"As it was stated by Sansoni C.J. in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed6 the object"
"of the power of revision is nothing else but the due administration of justice."
"In the case of Somawathi v. Madawala and others7 (S.C.) His Lordship Justice Soza"
"observed  that,  “The  Court  will  not  hesitate  to  use  its  revisionary  powers  to  give"
"relief  where  a  miscarriage  of  justice  has  occurred.  (…)  a  miscarriage  of  justice"
"results as here, then this Court will not sit idly by. Indeed, the facts of this case cry"
"aloud  for  the  intervention  of  this  Court  to  prevent  what  otherwise  would  be  a"
"miscarriage of justice.’’"
"In my view, the statement made by Justice Soza in the case is equally relevant to the"
"current situation."
"In the aforementioned case of Saheeda Umma and another v. Haniffa and others8,"
"this Court exercised its extraordinary powers of revision despite the application for"
"restitutio in integrum being time-barred."
