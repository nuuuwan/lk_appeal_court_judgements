"District  Judge.  The  learned  District  Judge  correctly  determined  that  the  District"
"Court, being the lower court, lacks the authority to reconsider the judgment of the"
"superior court, and therefore declined to make an order in that regard. Consequently,"
"by her order dated 8th June 2023, the learned District Judge rejected the objections"
"raised by the Petitioner and granted the Respondent's application to execute the writ"
"of possession."
"In the instant application the Petitioner seeks to set aside and/or vary/revise the order"
"of the learned District Judge dated 8th June 2023 and also to set aside the judgement"
"of the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge dated 13th November 2018."
"Based on its merits, I do not perceive any valid reason to interfere with the decision"
"of the learned District Judge dated 8th June 2023. However, it must be acknowledged"
"that this order stems from the disputed judgment of the learned High Court Judge."
"Nevertheless, considering the analysis above, it is evident that there are significant"
"errors  in  the  judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  rendering  it  ineffective."
"Allowing this  judgment  to  stand  would  result  in  a  serious  miscarriage  of  justice,"
"which justifies setting it aside."
"The Petitioner has brought this application before this Court seeking  restitutio in"
"integrum  under  Article  138  of  the  Constitution.  Article  138(1)  confers  upon  this"
"Court the exclusive jurisdiction to grant relief through restitutio in integrum."
"Under  Roman  law,  restitutio in  integrum  was  a  remedy  aimed  at  removing legal"
"disadvantages that had occurred, providing protection against injustice arising from"
"the practical impossibility of foreseeing all circumstances in advance. Restitution"
"aims to restore a party to their original legal position, which they were deprived of"
"by operation of law."
