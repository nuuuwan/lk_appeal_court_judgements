"In the appeal, the learned High Court Judge overturned the judgment of the learned"
"District Judge and concluded that there is no evidence to establish that Kumuduni"
"Chamali  Perera  holds  the  land  subject  to  a  constructive  trust.  Consequently,  the"
"learned High Court Judge held that it was an outright transfer by Kumuduni Chamali"
"Perera  in  favour  of  the  Respondent,  and  that  the  Respondent  had  allowed  the"
"Petitioner to remain in the property for three years under a lease agreement."
"The learned High Court Judge allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the"
"learned  District  Judge.  Accordingly,  the  judgment  was  entered  in  favour  of  the"
"Plaintiff  as  prayed  for  in  the  plaint.  However,  in  the  judgment,  the  learned  High"
"Court  Judge  did  not  overturn  the  answers  given  by  the  learned  District  Judge  to"
"issues No. 2 to 6 and 10 to 16; these were allowed to stand. The learned High Court"
"Judge set aside the answers to issues 1, 7, 8, and 9 only, and these were answered in"
"the following manner:"
"The  first  issue,  which  the  learned  District  Judge  answered  as  ‘not  a  valid  lease"
"agreement,’ was answered by the High Court Judge as ‘Yes,’ suggesting that there"
"is a valid lease agreement between the Petitioner and the Respondent."
"The second issue, concerning whether  the lease period ended on  30th September,"
"2007, which the learned District Judge answered as ‘not a valid lease agreement’,"
"remained unchanged. In contrast, the learned High Court Judge set aside the answer"
"to issue No. 7 and answered it as ‘No’, which aligns with the learned District Judge’s"
"determination that there was ‘not a valid lease agreement’. Issue No. 8, which the"
"learned District Judge answered as ‘not a valid lease agreement’, was answered by"
"the  High  Court  Judge  as  ‘No’.  The  answer  to  issues  No.  7  and  8  contradicts  the"
"answer given by the learned High Court Judge to issue No. 1."
"The  other  issue  that  was  reconsidered  and  freshly  answered  by  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge, overturning the decision of the learned District Judge, pertains to issue"
"No. 9. This issue concerns whether the Petitioner is in possession of the property"
