"Constitution, the Court of Appeal retains revisionary jurisdiction over decisions of"
"both the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court."
"Conclusion"
"In light of the analysis provided above in this judgment, it is my considered view"
"that  a  strong  case  for  the  interferences  of  this  Court  have  been  made  out  by  the"
"Petitioner and there are sufficient exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise"
"of  Court's  revisionary  powers.  Allowing  the  judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge dated 13th November 2018 to stand would result in a serious miscarriage of"
"justice. Therefore, I set aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated"
"13th November 2018 and direct the present judges of the Civil Appellate High Court"
"of  Colombo  to  reconsider  the  judgment  of  the  learned  District  Judge  dated  17th"
"January 2014 and deliver a fresh judgment expeditiously, addressing all the issues."
"Consequently, I also set aside the order made by the learned District Judge on 8th"
"June 2023, which was based on the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated"
"13th November 2018."
"Parties shall bear their own costs."
