"struck by the appellant, the scenario described by PW-03 cannot"
"be ruled out. It is a possibility. This Court also finds the testimony"
"of PW-03 to be natural and straightforward. There is no material"
"on record to show that PW-03 was tutored or influenced by PW-"
"01 or any other person of concern. Therefore, the testimony of PW-"
"03  should  be  accepted  and  acted  upon.  PW-04  also  has  stated"
"that  the  appellant  struck  him  with  an  iron  pole  when  he  was"
"returning with the son of PW-01 to the house of the latter. In those"
"circumstances,  the  discrepancy  could  be  attributed  to  lack  of"
"precise narration."
