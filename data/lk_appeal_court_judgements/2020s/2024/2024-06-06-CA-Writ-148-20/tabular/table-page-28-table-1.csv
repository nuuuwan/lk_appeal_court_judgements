"I. 
Has the 1st Respondent issued Circulars P2 and P4?"
"27)  The main contention of the Petitioners is that the Secretary to the"
"Ministry  of  Public  Administration  and  Management  had  issued"
"PAC  3/2016.    By  the  said  Circular  it  has  specified  revision  of  the"
"salaries  in  the  Public  Service.    The  annexure  to  the  said  salary"
"Circular, the salary structure for the Pubic Service had categorized"
"that the Public Servants are entitled for the said salary structure."
"28)  Subsequently, 
the 
secretary 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public"
"Administration had issued PAC 35/2019.  In the said Circular it is"
"stated the Public servants who are retiring after 1st January 2016"
"and  before  1st  January  2020  and/or  who  are  entitled  to  retire"
"during  that  period,  are  entitled  to  get  their  retirement  pension  on"
"the revised base as at 1st January 2020 contained in Schedule 1 of"
"the PAC 3/2016."
"29) 
In P4 Circular it is specified that the said revised pension shall be"
"paid with effect from 1st January 2020.  The said Circular P4 had"
"been  issued  after  the  Cabinet  decision  made  on  11th  November"
"2019."
"30)  Therefore,  the  said  two  Circulars  have  correctly  demonstrated  the"
"revised pension of the officers who retired during 1st January 2016"
"to 1st January 2020."
"31)  On  the  said  circumstances,  it  is  obvious  that  the  1st  Respondent"
"had issued P2 and P4 Circulars."
