"Rs. Part IV A covers controversies between a workman and his employer"
"about  the  rights  arising  out  of  that  relationship.  The  power  of  the"
"Tribunal  is  that  of  giving  a  binding  and  authoritative  decision.  In  this"
"respect 
the  procedure 
is 
to  be  distinguished 
from 
the  conciliation"
"procedures provided under the Act."
"The power proceeds from the Sovereign, i.e., it is the judicial power"
"of the State. In this respect it is to be distinguished from the power"
"of  an  arbitrator  whose  authority  is  derived  from  the  consent  of  the"
"parties themselves. This factor-that it is the judicial power of the State-"
"carries with it another consequence. Justice can be done in an individual"
"case without creating any principle applicable to other cases of the same"
"sort. But the judicial power of the State is concerned with justice for all"
"and that is not attained if there are inexplicable differentiations between"
"decisions in the same type of case. The judicial power of the State must"
"therefore  be  exercised  in  conformity  with  principle.  In  Moses  v.  Parker"
"1[(1896) A. C. 245.] there was vested in the Supreme Court of Tasmania"
"jurisdiction  to  deal  with  disputes  regarding  claims  to  grants  of  land."
"Such  disputes  had  previously  been  dealt  with  by  the  Governor  on  the"
"report  of  Commissioners, 
the  Governor  being 
""in  equity  and  good"
"conscience"" entitled to make a grant. The statute which gave jurisdiction"
"to the Supreme Court provided that it should not be "" bound by the strict"
"rules of law or equity in any case, or by any technicalities or legal forms"
"whatever"".  The  Board  held  that  a  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  given"
"under  the  statute  was  not  ""a 
judicial  decision  admitting  of  appeal""."
"Explaining this case in the later case of C. P. R. Co. v. Corporation of City"
"of  Toronto  2[(1911)  A.  C.  461.]  the  Board  said  at  471  that  ""as  the"
