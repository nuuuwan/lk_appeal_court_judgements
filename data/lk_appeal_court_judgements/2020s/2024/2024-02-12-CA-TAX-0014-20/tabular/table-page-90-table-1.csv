"States  to  render  invalid  statutes  that  delegated  legislative  power  without"

"U.S. 649 (1892). See Jaffe, ""An Essay on Delegation of Legislative Power”"
"(1947)  47  Colum.  L.  Rev.  359,  561.  It  later  reappeared  in  other  contexts,"
"e.g. Shuttlesworth vBrimmingham  394 U. S. 147 (1969) (byelaw  requiring"
"that  permit  be  obtained  before  holding  public  demonstration, 
invalid"
"because of the broad discretion entrusted to an official); Furman v Georgia"
"408  U.  S.  238  (1972);  Profitt  v  Florida  428  U.S.  242(1976),  where  the"
"constitutionality of capital punishment was attacked in part because of the"
"broad  discretion  “delegated""  to  the 
judge  and 
jury

it.  Cf."
"Francis vs. Chief of Police [1973] A.C. 761 at 773, where the PC held that a"
"statutory requirement that the permission of the Chief of Police be obtained"
"before  “noisy  instruments""  could  lawfully  be  used  at  public  meetings  did"
"not  delegate  so  much  discretion  as  to  infringe  the  freedom  of  speech  and"
"assembly  provisions  of  a 
constitution  of  St  Christopher,  Nevis  and"
"Anguilla)."
"The  New  Zealand  decisions  are  conflicting;  sometimes  such  provisions"
"havebeen construed as valid conditional prohibitions, and sometimes as"
"subdelegations 
the 
validity 
of  which  may 
be 
dependent 
on 
the"
"prescription of standards governing the exercise of the dispensing power."
"(Mackay  vs.  Adams  [1926]  N.  Z.  L.  R.  518).  Issues  such  as  thesehave"
"seldom arisen in the English courts. (Francis vs. Chief of Police [1993] A."
"C.  761).  If  an  absolute  prohibition  would  bevalid,  then  prima  facie  a"
"conditional  prohibition  should  be  upheld;  (Williams  vs.  Western  super"
