"19  [The  rest  of  the  Note  is  reproduced  here  in  footnote]  Macmillan’s  appointment  of  Lord"
"Denning to the Court of Appeal, as Master of the Rolls, in April 1962 could  be seen in"
"this  context  as  an  unorthodox,  but  inherently  conservative,  attempt  to  modernise  the"
"institution of the law along similar lines to those which Macmillan adopted with regard"
"to other institutions during the period of his premiership. Lord Denning’s appointment"
"came  between  the  Orpington  by-election,  in  the  seat  next  door  to  that  of  the  Prime"
"Minister,  which  the  Conservatives  lost  to  the  Liberals,  and  the  so  called  ‘night  of  the"
"long  knives’  on  13th  July  1962  when  Macmillan  sacked  seven  Cabinet  ministers,"
"including the Lord Chancellor. It was a time ofdecided instability in the fortunes of the"
"Conservative government. In this context, Macmillan’s appointment of Lord Denning to"
"conduct 
the 
inquiry 
into 
the  circumstances  surrounding 
the  resignation  of  John"
"Profumo in June 1963 should be considered an astute manouevre; the deployment of a"
"conservative, but unorthodox, judge of Lord Denning’s calibre was perhaps the only way"
"in which the gravest crisis of his premiership could have been resolved satisfactorily. In"
"the  febrile  atmosphere  of  the  summer  of  1963,  a  judge  of  the  stamp  of  Lord  Simonds"
"would  not  have  been  able  to  construct  a  report  which  would  been  credible,  let  alone"
"have  saved 
the  government.  Lord  Denning  did  not  disappoint;  his  Report  saved"
"Macmillan,  perhaps  even  the  Establishment  itself.  Despite  his  modest  criticism  of  his"
"conduct  as  Prime  Minster  during  the  affair,  Lord  Denning  retained  a  substantial"
"amount  of  respect 
for  Harold  Macmillan.  He  concluded  his  account  of  the  whole"
"business in Landmarks  in the Law by  quoting from the letter which Harold  Macmillan"
"wrote  to  him  on  his  retirement  on  28th  July  1982  in  which  he  praised  him  for  his"
"‘commonsense, 
fair  play  and 
justice’  and  concluded 
‘as  Lord  Mansfield  and  Lord"
"Camden, so Lord Denning’. Lord Denning then commented that ‘Macmillan was a very"
"great man’. Landmarks in the Law [London 1984 p. 365]."
