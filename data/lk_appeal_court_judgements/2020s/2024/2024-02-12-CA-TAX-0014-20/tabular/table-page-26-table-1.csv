"However  as  referred  to  earlier,  the  Court  decided  that  the  time  limit  of  “Two"
"Hundred and Seventy Days from the date of commencement of sittings for the"
"hearing  of 
such  appeal” 
can  apply 
to  both 
sets  of  appellants  without"
"discrimination and, as referred to above, it said,"
"“This only clarifies the terminal dates of the time limit and it is crystal"
"clear that such provisions cannot be violative of any of the provisions of"
"the Constitution.”"
"In  this  backdrop  it  is  pertinent  to  consider  the  second  question  considered  in"
"Visuvalingam  vs.  Liyanage  whether  the  requirement  under  Article  126(5)  of"
"the Constitution is mandatory or directory."
"In  C.  A.  Tax  17/2017  the  Court  of  Appeal  reproduced  only  a  part  of  the"
"passage 
in  which 
the 
learned  Chief 
Justice 
considered 
this 
question"
"commencing from page 226 of the judgment of Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage."
"But the learned Chief Justice started to consider this question at page 225 and"
"to quote it in full it said,"
"“Before I deal with the preliminary issues I desire to deal with the issue"
"raised  on  the  time  limit  of  two  months  set  out  in  Article  126(5)  which"
"states  that  the  Supreme  Court  ""Shall  hear  and  finally  dispose  of  any"
"petition  or  reference  within  two  months  of  the  filling  of  such  petition  or"
"the  making 
of 
such 
reference"". 
The  Deputy 
Solicitor  General"
"submitted that this provision was mandatory so that even a fault of"
"the Court is no excuse. An examination of the relevant provisions of the"
"Constitution 
indicates 
that 
this 
provision 
is  merely 
directory."
"Fundamental  Rights  are  an  attribute  of  the  Sovereignty  of  the"
"People.  The  constitution  commands 
that 
they 
""Shall  be 
respected,"
"secured and advanced by all the organs of Government and shall not be"
"abridged,  restricted  or  denied  save  in  the  manner  and  to  the  extent"
