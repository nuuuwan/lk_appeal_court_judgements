"consequences  that  would  follow  where  Parliament  had  not  prescribed  a"
"sanction for breach of a mandatory provision”."
"It is pertinent to note what was said in Julius vs. Bishop of Oxford (1880) 5 A."
"C. 214 H. L. It could be a case on the question of mandatory or directory, but it"
"was not on a time limit. The case of Julius vs. Bishop of Oxford was referred to"
"by  the  House  of  Lords  in  the  celebrated  case  of  Padfield  and  others  vs.  The"
"Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, [1968] A. C. 997."
"In  short,  the  dispute  was  in  respect  of  the  request  of  South  Eastern  dairy"
"farmers  that  the  existing  “differential”  was  too 
low.  What  that 
is  will  be"
"explained in due course. They complained to the Milk Marketing Board and as"
"they  could  not  persuade  that,  to  the  minister.  The  latter  refused  to  refer  the"
"complaint to the committee. This was the grievance of the dairy farmers when"
"they  came  to  the  Divisional  Court  of  the  Queen’s  Bench  Division,  which  held"
"with  them.  The  minister  appealed.  In  the  Court  of  Appeal  the  dairy  farmers"
"lost. They had only the support of Lord Denning M. R. in a minority. The dairy"
"farmers appealed. They won in the House of Lords."
"As  Lord  Denning,  M.  R.  said  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  the  dairy  farmers  of"
"England  and  Wales  sold  their  milk  to  the  Milk  Marketing  Board.  The  Board"
"paid a higher price to dairy farmers in the South Eastern region than those in"
"the Far Western region. The reason was because the South Eastern are much"
"nearer  to  London  and  if  they  were  free,  they  would  sell  their  milk  in  London"
"and  would  have  to  bear  their  own  costs  of  transport.  The  cost  of  Sussex"
"farmers  in  transporting  their  milk  to  London  will  be  much  less  than  that  of"
"Cornish  farmers.  The  Board  recognized  this  and  paid  a  “differential”  to  the"
"South Eastern farmers. They complained that this, which was fixed long ago by"
"the Minister during the war, was too low."
