"The 
question 
is 
therefore  whether 
section  10, 
twice 
amended 
in"
"successive  years  of  2012  and  2013, 
in  regard  to 
its  time 
limit,  not"
"“spelling out” a consequence of not adhering to the said time limit makes"
"it directory and not mandatory."
"Another facet of this question could be posed as follows:"
"Will section 10 (as amended) not “spelling out” consequences of non adherence"
"to its stipulated time limit, be a bar to interpret that the outcome is a position"
"in favour of the tax payer?"
"The  Court  in  C.  A.  Tax  17/2017,  as  quoted  above,  said,  that,  the  second"
"proviso  to  section  34(8)  of  the  VAT  Act  specifically  provided,  that,  “the  appeal"
"shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  allowed  and  the  tax  charged  accordingly”  when"
"the  appeal  to  the  Commissioner  General  is  not  determined  within  two  years."
"The  Court  was  of  the  view  that  if  that  was  intended  for  Income  Tax  too,  the"
"legislature  will  specifically  state  so.  According  to  the  judgment  when  this  was"
"pointed  out  to  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant  his  response  was  that  if"
"the appeal was not determined within the stipulated time limit then the Court"
"should declare that the appeal is deemed to have been allowed. The Court then"
"said  according  to  what  Viscount  Simonds  said  in  Magor  &  St.  Mellons  vs."
"Newport  Corporation  [(1951)  2  All  E.  R.  839  at  841]  this 
is  “a  naked"
"usurpation of the legislative function under the thin guise of interpretation…If"
"a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act”."
