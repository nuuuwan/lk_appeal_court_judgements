"“The Carltona principle"
"Special considerations arise where a statutory power vested in a minister"
"or  adepartment  of  state 
is  exercised  by  a  departmental  official.  The"
"official is notusually spoken of as a delegate, but rather as the alter ego"
"of the minister or thedepartment: (Lewisham Borough vs. Roberts [1949]"
"2  K.  B.  608,  629)  power  is  devolved  rather  than  delegated.  (Regina  vs."
"Secretary of State ex. P. Oladehinde [1991] 1 A. C. 254 at 283 – 284, C."
