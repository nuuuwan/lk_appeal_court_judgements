"valid  exercise  of  a  discretion  always  requires  a  genuine  application"
"of the mind and a conscious choice by the correct authority.”"
"Hence  what  is  apparent  from  the  above  discussion,  relevant  to  this  case,"
"is that if (i) the acknowledgment of the receipt of the appeal is something"
"to be done as “a matter of course” even an Assessor may do it (ii) but if it"
"involves  discretion,  then  the  correct  authority  on  whom  the  power  is"
"vested must do it."
"Then it is said at page 258,"
