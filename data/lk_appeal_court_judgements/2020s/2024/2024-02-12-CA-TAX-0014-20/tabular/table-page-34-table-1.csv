"what  these  are  will  vary  with  the  circumstances  of  the  case  as  Tucker"
"L.J. said in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk 3[(1949) 1 A. E. R. 109 at 118.] in"
"a passage which has several times been approved. Whatever standard is"
"adopted,  Tucker  L.J.  said,  one  essential  is  that  the  person  concerned"
"should  have  a  reasonable  opportunity  of  presenting  his  case.  Lord"
"Hodson  in  Ridge  v.  Baldwin  4[(1964)  A.  C.  40  at  132.],  after  quoting"
"Tucker  L.J'.s  dictum,  added  :-""No  one,  I  think,  disputes  that  three"
"features  of  natural  justice  stand  out(1)  the  right  to  be  heard  by  an"
"unbiased 
tribunal; 
(2) 
the 
right 
to  have  notice  of  charges  of"
"misconduct;  (3)  the  right  to  be  heard  in  answer  to  those  charges."
"""These  are  not  necessarily 
features  of  administrative  decisions.  The"
"administrator is not required to be unbiased and his decision may often"
"affect  those  who  have  no  opportunity  of  presenting  their  views.Under  s."
"31C  (2)  the  Labour  Tribunal  is  empowered,  subject  to  regulations"
"which  have  not  yet  been  made,  itself  to  lay  down  the  procedure  to"
"be observed by it. We think it is clear from the authorities, indeed,"
"the  contrary  was  not  suggested-that  the  nature  of  its  enquiry  is"
"such  that  it  must  act  in  conformity  with  natural  justice.  A  recent"
"example  of  the  applicability  of  the  rules  in  this  type  of  case  is  R.  v."
"Deputy  Industrial  Injuries  Commissioner  ex  parte  Moore  1[(1964)  A.  C."
"40 at 132. (1965) 1 Q. B. 456 at 476.].  It is arguable that the rules of"
"natural justice are not applicable at all unless there is an obligation"
"to  act  judicially  and  that  if  such  a  limitation  is  imposed  on  the"
"power,  it  must  be  a  judicial  power.  Parker  C.J.  said  recently  in  re."
"Habib Khan that it may be that where there is no duty to act judicially or"
"quasi-judicially there is no power in the Court to interfere. But the point"
"was  not  explored 
in  argument  before 
the  Board  and  we  shall  not"
"therefore say more than that to hold that the Labour  Tribunal is bound"
"by the rules of natural justice is going a long way towards holding that it"
"is a judicial tribunal."
