"INTRODUCTION THE OBITUARIES OF LORD DENNING in Notes under No. 01"
"says,"
"“Lord  Denning  was  first  appointed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  1948.  He"
"was promoted to the House of Lords by Harold Macmillan on 24th April"
"1957. In his Romanes lecture of 1959, delivered in the University of"
"Oxford, Lord Denning seemed to go so far as to claim that the House"
"of  Lords, 
in 
its 
judicial  capacity,  should  appropriate 
legislative"
"powers  to 
itself  enabling 
it  to  change  the 
law  when 
it  needed"
"changing,  rather  than  having  to  wait  on  the  more  leisurely  process"
"of Parliamentary law making. Although the Practice Statement of 1966"
"was a move in this direction, in 1959 such radicalism was anathema to"
"the  senior  Law  Lord,  Lord  Simonds.  Although  Lord  Denning  often"
"dissented from the majority decision in the Lords, his dissent could make"
"little  or  no  impact.  Frequently  he  was  at  odds  with  Lord  Simonds  in"
"particular who once memorably expressed his distaste for Lord Denning’s"
"preference for ‘filling in the gaps’ left by poor or confusing drafting as ‘a"
"naked  usurpation  of  the  legislative  function  under  the  thin  disguise  of"
"interpretation.’  According  to  the  Sunday  Times  obituary,  it  was  the"
"frustration which resulted from conflict with Lord Simonds that led"
"Lord  Denning  to  accept  the  apparent  demotion  from  the  House  of"
"Lords  consequent  on  his  acceptance  of  the  office  of  Master  of  the"
"Rolls in April 1962. In the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning’s judgments,"
"even the dissenting ones, could have much more impact on the shaping"
"of the law than was possible in the House of Lords. It is also worth noting"
"that  Lord  Denning’s  appointment  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  19th  April"
"1962  was  made  by  Harold  Macmillan.  Macmillan  was  an  unorthodox"
"Conservative  who  was 
the  author  of  a  number  of  relatively  radical"
"initiatives  between  1957  and  1962  ranging  from  the  creation  of  Life"
"Peerages, the setting up of the National Economic Development Council,"
