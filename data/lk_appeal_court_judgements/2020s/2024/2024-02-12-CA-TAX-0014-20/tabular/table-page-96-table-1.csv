"Lord 
Phillips  C.J. 
suggested 
(at 
[29]) 
that 
there  was 
scope 
for"
"furtherrefinement 
of 
the  Carltona 
principle, 
and 
devolution 
of 
a"
"minister's powers should be subject to a requirement that the seniority of"
"the  official  exercising:  a  power  should  be  of  an  appropriate  levelhaving"
"regard to the nature of the power in question)."
"At the very least, it would seem that theofficial must satisfy the test"
"of  Wednesbury  unreasonableness:  he  must  not  be  sojunior  that  no"
"reasonable  minister  would  allow  him  to  exercise  the  power.(Regina"
"vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex. P. Oladehinde [1991]"
"1  A.  C.  254  at  304).  There  may  be  some  tasks  which  by  their  nature"
"ought not to allow of  delegationor devolution, such as some disciplinary"
"powers. (Regina vs. North Thames Regional Health Authority and Chelsea"
"and  Westminster  NHS  Trust  Ex.  P.  L  (1996)  7  Med  L.  R.  385)  And"
"different 
tasks 
conferredon  a  decision-maker  may  be  delegable 
to"
"different  levels  within  the  organisation(For  example  the  application  task"
"and the consultation task in Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police"
"[2002] EWHC 1087; [2003] Crim. L. R. 37)."
"The  Carltona  principle  may  be  expressly  excluded  by  legislation,  (See"
"e.g., Immigration Act 1971) butwhether it may in addition be excluded by"
"statutory 
implication 
remainsuncertain. 
Two 
situations 
should 
be"
"distinguished.  Where  a  power  of  delegation 
isexpressly  conferred  by"
"Parliament  on  a  minister,  it  may  compel  the  inference  thatParliament"
"intended 
to 
restrict  devolution  of  power 
to 
the  statutory  method,"
"thusimpliedly  excluding  the  Carltona  principle. 
(Customs  and  Excise"
"Commissioners 
vs.  Cure 
and  Deeley  Ltd., 
[1962]  1  Q.  B.  340)."
"Commonwealth  authority,  however,  suggests  that  such  an  implication"
"will  not  readily  be  drawn.  (O’  Reilly  vs.  Commissioner  of  State  Bank  of"
"Victoria 
(1982)  44  A.  L.  R.  27). 
It  has  alsobeen  suggested  that  the"
"principle  may  be  impliedly  excluded  where  it  appearsinconsistent  with"
