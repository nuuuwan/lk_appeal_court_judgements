"In  the  instant  application,  the  Loan  Agreement  marked  P8-(6)  has  been"
"reduced to a form of a document with the consent of the 3rd Respondent"
"and the Petitioner Company. In addition, an agreement of this nature is"
"required by law to be reduced to the form of a document. Therefore, the"
"3rd Respondent cannot give oral evidence, taking up a contrary position to"
"what is in the Loan Agreement and state that he has not truly obtained"
"the loan. In fact, as stated previously, the 3rd Respondent has not come to"
"this Court and said so. In addition, when the 3rd Respondent applied for"
"the 
loan,  he  has  specifically  stated 
in  the 
loan  application  that  he"
"requested 
the 
loan 
“in 
order 
to 
clear 
short 
remittance”. 
In 
the"
"circumstances, other Respondents cannot argue that the loan was actually"
"not given to the 3rd Respondent or there was no actual fund transfer. The"
"2nd  Respondent  was  also  erred  in  deciding  that  the  loan  granted  by  the"
"Petitioner Company was not truly a loan released to the 3rd  Respondent"
"and  directing 
the  Petitioner  to  draw  a  cheque 
in 
favour  of  the  3rd"
"Respondent for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 639,575.09 and the interest"
"thereon."
