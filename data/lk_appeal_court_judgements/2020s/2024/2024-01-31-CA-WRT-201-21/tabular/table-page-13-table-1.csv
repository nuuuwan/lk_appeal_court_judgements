"provisions of the MSPS.",""
"","By signing the Loan Agreement marked P8-(6), the 3rd Respondent agreed"
"","as per clause 4 of the agreement that if he fails to settle the loan by reason"
"","of his death, retirement, resignation, or termination of his service on or"
"","before the settlement date mentioned in the agreement, the company shall"
"","be entitled to recover the balance sum outstanding on the loan by way of"
"","a claim under Section 43 (Employers Lien) of the Rules of the Mercantile"
"","Services  Provident  Society.  Hence,  I  hold that  the  Petitioner  Company"
"","recovered  the  loan  from  the  MSPS  Fund  lawfully,  and  the  Petitioner"
"","Company  is  legally  entitled  to  do  so.  When  the  Petitioner  Company"
"","recovered the loan in a lawful manner, it is incorrect for the Respondents"
"to  allege  that  the  Petitioner  engaged","in  a  corrupt,  oppressive,  and"
"","exploitative  practice  to  punish  and  harass  the  3rd  Respondent.  In  the"
