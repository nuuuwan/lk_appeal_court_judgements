"doubt against the appellant and the learned High Court Judge has"
"failed to analyze the evidence in the correct perspective."
"It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  that  since"
"there  were  no  eyewitnesses  to  the  incident  where  the  deceased  received"
"injuries, 
the  circumstantial  evidence  placed  before 
the  Court  was  not"
"sufficient enough to convict the appellant. He submitted that the witnesses"
"PW-01  and  PW-02  have  stated  that  the  deceased  was  found  injured  in  the"
"veranda of the house but in fact, the place of the incident had been in front"
"of  his  house  according  to  the  evidence  of  the  police  officer  who  conducted"
"investigations. He submitted further that the mamoty marked as P-01 at the"
"trial,  has  not  been 
identified  as  the  weapon  used 
in  the  crime  by  the"
"relevant witnesses and cannot be used as evidence against the appellant."
"The  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  (ASG)  on  behalf  of  the  respondent"
"submitted that, the prosecution has provided ample circumstantial evidence"
"against 
the  appellant  and  had  proved 
the  charge  against  him  beyond"
"reasonable doubt. It was pointed out that there had been no inter se or per"
"se contradictions in the evidence and the appellant has failed to explain the"
"incriminating evidence against him."
"He was of the view that the appeal should be  dismissed, as there exists no"
"basis for the appeal."
