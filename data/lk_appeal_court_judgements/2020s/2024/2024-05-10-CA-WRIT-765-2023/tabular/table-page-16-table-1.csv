"In enforcing this rule, the courts are underlining the difference between"
"judicial  and  administrative  processes.  The  legal  rights  of  litigants  are"
"decided  according  to  legal  rules  and  precedents  so  that  like  cases  are"
"treated  alike.  But  if  an  administrative  authority  acts  in  this  way  its"
"decision is ultra vires and void. It is not allowed to 'pursue consistency"

"doctrine is applied even to statutory tribunals, despite their resemblance"
"to courts of law (See Regina vs. Greater Brimingham Appeal Tribunal ex P"

"discretion: decision quashed)). But it does not apply to prerogative powers."

"permits, and could  make no exception  even in the most deserving case."

"a discretion but as a refusal to exercise any discretion' (quoted from Banks"
"L. J., in Rex vs. Port of London Authority ex p. Kynoch Ltd., [1919] 1 K. B."
"176 at 185) and granted mandamus to compel the Council to consider the"
"application (Rex vs. London County Council ex p. Corrie [1918] 1 K. B. 68)."
"It  did  not  follow  that  they  must  give  permission  or  that  they  might  not"
"follow a policy: their duty was merely to exercise their discretion in each"
