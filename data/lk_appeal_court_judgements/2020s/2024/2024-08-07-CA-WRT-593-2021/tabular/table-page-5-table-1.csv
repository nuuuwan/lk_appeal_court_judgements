"Respondents, indicated that no statement of objections would be filed, and"
"further indicated that no oral or written submissions would be made against"
"the 
Petition, 
thereby 
leaving 
the 
Petitioner's 
facts 
uncontested."
"Consequently,  the  Petitioner  argues  that  he  is  entitled  to  the  relief  sought"
"based  on  the  uncontroverted 
facts  that  are  deemed  to  be  admitted  as"
"presented in the Petition."
"T
he  documents  marked  P2(a)  -  P6  tendered  by  the  Petitioner  demonstrates"
"the outstanding academic excellence achieved by the Petitioner. Further, the"
"documents  produced  marked  P7(a)  -  P7(m),  demonstrate  the  Petitioner’s"
"work experience. It is also submitted that the two service certificates marked"
"as P7(l) and P7(m) are issued by the 1st Respondent University itself."
"I
t is submitted that on or about 03.09.2020, the 1st  Respondent University"
"advertised

of"
"Humanities,  including  the  relevant  post  for  the  Department  of  Pali  and"

"application 
(marked

"postgraduate  degrees.  After  scrutinizing  the  application,  the  Petitioner  was"
"shortlisted  and

(marked

to"
"present himself for the interview."

t  is  submitted  by  the  Petitioner  that  if  possessing  an  MPhil  qualification"
"makes  an  applicant  overqualified  for  the  post  of  Lecturer  (Probationary),  a"
"serious  question  arises  as  to  why the 1st  Respondent University shortlisted"
"the Petitioner and directed him to prepare a presentation for the interview."
"By being called for the interview, the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation"
"of  being  duly  assessed  and  marked  according 
to 
the  council-approved"
"marking scheme."

the  Petitioner 
faced 
the 
interview  before

"committee comprising of the 2nd, 8th, 13th, 14th, 24th, and 25th Respondents."
"However, It is submitted that on or about 07.04.2021, the Petitioner became"
"aware that the selection committee had recommended the 26th Respondent"
"for the advertised post of Lecturer (Probationary)."
"S
ince 
the  Petitioner 
is  more  qualified  and  experienced 
than 
the  26th"
"Respondent, he immediately submitted an RTI Application dated 09.04.2021"
"(marked  ‘P14’)  and  received  the  mark  sheet  of  the  Selection  Committee"
"(marked ‘P15(a)’)."
