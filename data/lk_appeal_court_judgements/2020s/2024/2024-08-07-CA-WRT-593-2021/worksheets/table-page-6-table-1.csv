"It is submitted that to the Petitioner’s dismay, he noted that he was listed as"
"the  8th 
candidate  but 
received  no  marks  whatsoever  due 
to  being"
"""overqualified  for  the  post  because  of  the  MPhil.""  The  Selection  Committee"
"recommended that overqualified candidates not be considered for the post of"
"Lecturer (Probationary)."
"T
he attention of this court was also drawn to the council-approved marking"
"scheme for the recruitment of Lecturer (Probationary) at the 470th meeting"
"of the Council held on 09.04.2019 (at pages 109-111 of the brief). In terms"
"of the said scheme,  it is submitted by the Petitioner that the elimination of"
"the  Petitioner,  based  on  his  postgraduate  qualifications  are  grossly  illegal,"
"unlawful and ultra vires."
"T
he  Petitioner  claims  that  despite  being  more  qualified  and  eligible  for  the"
"position, his application was not considered, while the 26th Respondent, who"
"was  less  qualified,  was  selected.  The  Petitioner  argues  that  this  decision"
"violates the principles of natural justice and the approved marking scheme"
"for  candidate  selection.  The  Petitioner  had  sent  a  Letter  of  Demand  to  the"
"2nd Respondent (marked ‘P26’), requesting a review of the selection process,"
"but  this  was  rejected  on  the  grounds  that  he  did  not  apply  for  the  post  of"
"Lecturer (Unconfirmed), for which he was eligible due to his qualifications."
"T
he Petitioner states that the selection process was arbitrary, irrational, and"
"influenced by mala fide considerations. He contends that similar candidates"
"with postgraduate qualifications have been selected for probationary lecturer"
"positions 
in  other  departments  and  universities, 
thus 
establishing  a"
"precedent 
that 
the  Petitioner's  qualifications  should  not  have  been  a"
"disqualification."
"T
he  marking  scheme  for  the  interview,  as  documented  on  Page  110  of  the"
"Petition,  does  not  include  overqualification  as  a  disqualifying  criterion.  The"
"scheme 
outlines 
various 
categories 
such 
as 
academic 
qualifications,"
"presentation skills/teaching ability, research, publication and creative work,"
"medals,  scholarships  and  prizes  at  university  level,  and  extra-curricular"
"activities.  Each  of 
these  categories  has  specific  marks  allocated,  with"
"academic  qualifications  accounting  for  a  substantial  portion.  Specifically,"
"higher  degrees  are  awarded  marks  under  academic  qualifications,  with  an"
"M.Phil degree, such as the one held by the Petitioner earning 15 marks. The"
"fact  that  overqualification  is  not  mentioned  in  the  criteria  implies  that  it"
"should not have been used as a basis for disqualification. This oversight by"
"the selection committee indicates a departure from the established criteria,"
"leading to an arbitrary and unjust decision."
