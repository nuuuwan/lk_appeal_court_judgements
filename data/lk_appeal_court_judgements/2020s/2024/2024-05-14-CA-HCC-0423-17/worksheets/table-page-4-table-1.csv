"As such we find that the grounds of appeal raised by the learned Counsel for"
"the  appellant  to  be  without  merit  and  this  Court  also  finds  the  case  for  the"
"prosecution had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt against the appellant"
"hence, we find that the trial judge had rightly held that the appellant is guilty"
"for the charge in the indictment."
"As such, we find there is no reason to set aside the conviction and the sentence"
"of  the  trial  judge  as  such  the  instant  appeal  is  dismissed  and  the  conviction"
"and the sentence of the appellant is hereby affirmed."
