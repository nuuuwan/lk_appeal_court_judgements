"She had said that after the incident, she had gone running to the house of her"
"friend and had narrated the story to her and the  friend also had corroborated"
"her without any loophole in her evidence."
"The  farther  had  got  to  know  of  the  incident  thereafter  and  he  too  had  given"
"evidence without creating any doubt in the evidence of the victim."
"All theses witnesses had been lengthily cross-examined but they had stood the"
"test of cross-examination satisfactorily."
"The  appellant  when  the  defense  had  been  called  had  made  a  statement  from"
"the dock and had denied the entire allegation but had said that the prosecution"
"had concocted the story to obtain money from him."
"But  this  position  had  not  been  put  to  the  witnesses,  they  had  only  been"
"suggested with for giving false evidence."
"The appellant has called his wife to the witness box and she had said that the"
"family of the victim has had a dispute with them over the issue of a ring. But"
"this position also had not been suggested to the witnesses of the prosecution."
"The Counsel for the appellant had raised the 1st ground of appeal saying that"
"the trial judge had not considered the evidence of the victim properly but this"
"Court finds that the trial judge had very leghilly considered the evidence of the"
"victim and had said that her evidence had been without any contradiction nor"
"any omission."
"We too observe this to be correct hence we see no merit in the first ground of"
"appeal raised by the Counsel for appellant."
"The second ground of appeal had been that the trial judge had not considered"
"the dock statement of the appellant properly but this too we find to be incorrect"
"because the trial judge had lucidly analyzed the same ."
"Hence that too we find to be without merit."
"The  third  ground  of  appeal  was  that  the  trial  judge  had  not  considered  the"
"defense properly."
"But  we  find  that  the  trial  judge  had  said  that  the  position  taken  up  in  the"
"statement from the dock had not been put to the witnesses,  which this Court"
"also observe to be correct."
"We also find that the wife of the appellant in giving evidence has said that the"
"victimâ€™s family had a dispute with the appellant over a ring but this too had not"
"been  suggested  to  the  prosecution  witnesses  hence  this  Court  hold  it  to  be  a"
"belated unacceptable defense."
