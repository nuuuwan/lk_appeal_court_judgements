"resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s"
"death comes into question."
"Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or"
"was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death,"
"and whatever may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause"
"of his death comes into question."
"The  following  requirements  must  necessarily  be  established  before  any"
"evidence is led under section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance."
"1.  That the maker of the statement is dead."
"2.  That the statement made by the deceased refers to his/her  cause of"
"death  or  to  the  circumstances  of  the  transaction  which  resulted  in"
"his/her death."
"Hence such evidence would become admissible only where the cause of death"
"of the person making the statement is in question in the particular judicial"
"proceedings. Admissibility of such evidence would ultimately be decided by"
"the trial judge as per Section 136 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"In Dharmawansa Silva and Another v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1981]"
"2 Sri.L.R.439 it was held:"
"“When a dying statement is produced, three questions arise for the Court."
"Firstly,  whether  it  is  authentic.  Secondly  if  it  is  authentic  whether  it  is"
"admissible in whole or part. Thirdly, the value of the whole or part that is"
"admitted. A dying deposition is not inferior evidence but it is wrong to give"
"it added sanctity”"
