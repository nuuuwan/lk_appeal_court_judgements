"Judge.‚Äù"
"This case was decided under the old Criminal Procedure Code of Sri Lanka."
"In this case as per the case record, although the Appellant was pronounced"
"not guilty to the second charge, it was immediately corrected by the foreman"
"of the jury. Further, the learned High Court Judge had proceeded only after"
"clearing the confusion by directing pertinent questions to the foreman and"
"taking due steps to receive the verdict clearly, which is that the Appellant is"
"guilty of both charges. Importantly, this had been done before the jury rose"
"and was officially dispersed. Therefore, this is my considered view that the"
"corrected  verdict  did  not  cause  any  prejudice  to  the  Appellant  nor  has  he"
"been deprived of a fair trial."
"Further  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.  15  of  1979  and  the"
"Constitution of our country provide provisions to rectify any error, omission,"
"or irregularity in a judgment where such error, omission or irregularity which"
"has not prejudiced the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a failure"
"of justice."
