"‘presumption  of  innocence,  burden  of  proof,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,"
"admissible evidence, facts in issue and relevant facts are properly described"
"with examples by the learned High Court Judge in her opening address and"
"in summing-up."
"Under  the  third  ground  of  appeal  the  learned  Counsel  contended  that  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  erred  in  law  by  misdirecting  the  Jury  as  to  the"
"evidential value of the Appellant’s dock statement."
"The Counsel for the Appellant extended his argument that the learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  not  properly  explained  the  evidentiary  value  of  a  dock"
"statement in her summing-up. Further she had failed to direct the jury that,"
"if the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case,"
"the defence must succeed."
"The  following  judgements  are  very  important  as  it  laid  down  guidelines  to"
"show how it can be treated as evidence in a criminal trial"
