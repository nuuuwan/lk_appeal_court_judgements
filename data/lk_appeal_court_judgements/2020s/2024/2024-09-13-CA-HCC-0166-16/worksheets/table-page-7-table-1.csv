"of the jury. I find in the comments to section 304 of the Indian Act given in"
"Sohoni's Code of Criminal Procedure that the law is set forth as follows: -''"
"The section for an amendment of a- wrong verdict delivered by accident or"
"mistake clearly contemplates that such a verdict is amended only before"
