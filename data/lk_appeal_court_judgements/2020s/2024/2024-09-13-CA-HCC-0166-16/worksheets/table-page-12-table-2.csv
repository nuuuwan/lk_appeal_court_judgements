"n Queen v. Buddharakkitha Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:"
"“The right of an accused person to make an unsworn statement"
"from the dock is recognised in our law (King v. Vellayan[10 (1918)"
"20 N. L. R. 251-at 266.].) That right would be of no value unless"
"such a statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the accused"
"subject however to the infirmity which attaches to statements that"
"are unsworn and have not been tested by cross-examination’."
