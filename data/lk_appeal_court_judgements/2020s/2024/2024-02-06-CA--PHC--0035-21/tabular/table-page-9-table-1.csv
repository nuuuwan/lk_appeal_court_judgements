"The procedure as to the issue of summons has been defined in section 139 of"
"the Code. It has been stated that before issuing summons in terms of 136(1)(a),"
"the Magistrate may examine on oath the complainant or some material witness"
"or witnesses and satisfy that there exist reasonable grounds to issue summons."
"In the matter under appeal, when this private plaint was presented to the Court,"
"the  appellant  who  was  the  complainant,  has  tendered  an  affidavit  as  well,"
"informing  the  facts  and  the  circumstances  which  led  to  the  issuing  of  the"
"cheques and dishonouring of the same by the bank."
"It appears that when this matter was supported for summons, the learned Chief"
"Magistrate has not required  the appellant to lead evidence but  has decided to"
"scrutinize the case record in order to make an order, most probably since the"
"appellant has substantiated his case by way of an affidavit.  The learned Chief"
"Magistrate  has  determined  that,  to  convict  a  person  on  the  basis  of  issuing  a"
"cheque while the account was closed, it becomes necessary for the Court to know"
"the date from which the said account has been closed. It has been determined"
"that if the account was functioning on the day the cheque was issued and the"
"account has been closed subsequently to it, a conviction cannot be entered and"
"therefore, since the appellant has failed to submit a report from the bank along"
"with the plaint, there exists no basis to justify issuing of summons."
"I  am  in  no  position  to  agree  with  the  above  reasoning  of  the  learned  Chief"
"Magistrate."
"For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant section 25 of the Debt"
"Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 as amended by Debt Recovery"
"(Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 1994."
