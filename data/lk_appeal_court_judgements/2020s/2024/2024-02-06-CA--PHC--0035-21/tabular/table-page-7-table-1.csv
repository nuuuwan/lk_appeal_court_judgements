"The action instituted by the appellant has been on the basis that the two accused"
"mentioned  in  the  draft  plaint  and  the  charge  sheet,  issued  two  cheques  as"
"mentioned  in  the  plaint  for  goods  sold  to  them  by  the  appellant,  which  were"
"dishonoured by the relevant bank when presented for payment. It was on that"
"basis the appellant has filed this private plaint seeking to punish the wrongdoers"
"in terms of section 25(1)(b) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act."
"It is apparent from the order of the learned Chief Magistrate that the summons"
"has been refused, on two grounds. It has been determined that since the cheques"
"had been dishonoured by the bank due to the fact that the relevant account has"
"been closed, it was necessary for the appellant to establish the date as to when"
"the relevant account had been closed, and the Court cannot determine such a"
"fact until a report from the relevant bank is called in order to determine whether"
"the accused had committed an offence. Since no such report has been called and"
"produced  with  the  private  plaint,  it  has  been  determined  that  there  exists  no"
"basis for the Court to issue summons as requested."
"The other factor considered by the learned Chief Magistrate to refuse summons"
"had  been  the  appellantâ€™s  apparent  failure  to  make  a  police  complaint  in  that"
"regard."
"Having  considered  the  above  two  factors,  the  learned  Chief  Magistrate  has"
"refused summons to the accused."
"When the above order was challenged by way of a revision application before the"
"Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo, the learned"
"High Court Judge who considered the application has dismissed it on the basis"
"that the order of the learned Chief Magistrate was justified. However, it appears"
"that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  wrongly  considered  the  section  under"
"which  the  appellant  sought  to  institute  an  action  under  the  Debt  Recovery"
"(Special Provisions) Act."
