"It is apparent from the copy of the Magistrateâ€™s Court case record tendered along"
"with this appeal, that the appellant has tendered along with the plaint, the draft"
"charge sheet and the earlier mentioned affidavit, a list of witnesses and a list of"
"documents, which the appellant would  be relying on to prove the charges. He"
"has also tendered to the Court the two cheque return notifications relating to the"
"two cheques issued by the accused."
"In  the  said  notifications,  the  relevant  bank  has  informed  the  reasons  for  not"
"honouring the cheques as the relevant account had been closed at the time the"
"cheques were presented. This goes on to show that there had been no obligation"
"to the banker to honour the cheques due to the said fact."
"I am of the view that this has provided enough information to the learned Chief"
"Magistrate  to  satisfy  herself  as  to  the  necessary  consideration  that  should  be"
"looked into in issuing summons to an accused in a case filed as a private plaint."
"Since the appellant has tendered a list of witnesses that he intends to call at the"
"trial, which includes an official from the relevant bank to prove the details as to"
"the account through which the cheques have been issued, I am of the view that"
"the  appellant  has  provided  sufficient  information  as  to  the  way  he  intends  to"
"prove the charges against the accused."
"The other reason the learned Chief Magistrate has decided to refuse notice had"
"been on the basis that the appellant has failed to make a complaint to a Peace"
"Officer,  in  other  words,  to  police,  to  enable  such  Peace  Officer  to  conduct  a"
"criminal investigation in this regard. I am in no position to agree with the said"
"determination of the learned Chief Magistrate either."
"There  is  no  requirement  in  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  that  when  a"
"private plaint is instituted, in terms of section 136(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure Act, such a plaint should be after making a complaint with regard to"
"the  same  to  a  Peace  Officer,  although  such  a  complaint  may  have  an  added"
"advantage under certain circumstances."
