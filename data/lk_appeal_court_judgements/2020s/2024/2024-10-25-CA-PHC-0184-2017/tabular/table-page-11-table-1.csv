"been  fixed  at  Rs.  50/-  or  10%  of  the  sum  awarded  against  the  petitioner"
"whichever sum was higher."
"I am therefore of the view that Rule 49 (xii) (a) is the rule that had been framed"
"under Section 61(2)(y) by the Minister and does not circumscribe the right of"
"appeal granted under section 58(3) of the Law as the rule making powers of the"
"Minister entitles the Minister in terms of the Law to prescribe forms, fees to be"
"paid and procedure to be observed.’"
"Nevertheless, in Sebestian Fernando’s case, both their Lordships Fernando J. and"
"Kulatunga  J.  observed  that  the  finding  in  Somaratne’s  case  concerning  the"
"requirement of an appeal deposit being intra vires appears to be obiter."
"The word ‘appear’ suggests that something becomes visible or noticeable, often"
"without a clear cause. This does not convey  a strong sense of certainty in the"
"mind of a judge. Chinua Asuzu, in his work Judicial Writing: A Benchmark for"
"the  Bench,  emphasizes  that  a  conclusion  in  a  judgment  should  express  the"
"disposition  with  maximum clarity  and  minimal  ambiguity. Therefore,  it is  my"
"humble opinion that Their Lordships did not arrive at a definitive finding on this"
"matter."
"In light of  the analysis presented above, the  conclusion  is that  in  Somaratne’s"
"case,  three  judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  determined  that  Rule  49(xii)  is  intra"
"vires, and this constitutes the ratio decidendi of that judgment. In contrast, while"
"both  judgments  in  Sebestian  Fernando’s  case  indicated  that  the  Rule  is  ultra"
"vires, those statements were obiter dicta."
"Therefore,  I  will  adhere  to  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Somaratne's"
"case."
"This  appeal  arises  from  the  judgment  of  the  High  Court  of  Kandy,  where  the"
"Appellant  challenged  the  decision  of  the  Commissioner  of  the  Co-operative"
"Development  Department  of  the  Central  Province  in  a  Writ  application.  The"
"learned High Court Judge refused to issue the Writs."
