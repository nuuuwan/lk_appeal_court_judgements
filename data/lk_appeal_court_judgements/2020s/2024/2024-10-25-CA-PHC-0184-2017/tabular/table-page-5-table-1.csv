"The Appellant states that the 1st Respondent proceeded to hear the cross-appeal"
"filed  by  the  2nd  Respondent  regarding  the  same  award,  with  the  Appellant's"
"participation.  According  to  the  Appellant,  the  1st  Respondent  increased  the"
"Arbitrator's  award  by  Rs.  545,241.19,  raising  the  total  amount  due  to  Rs."
"1,562,157.31.  The  Appellant  alleged  that  the  1st  Respondent's  decision  was"
"neither just nor equitable."
"The Appellant, dissatisfied with the decision of the 1st Respondent, sought a Writ"
"of  certiorari  from  the  High  Court  of  Kandy  to  quash  the  1st  Respondent's"
"decision  to  dismiss  the Appellant’s  appeal,  contained  in  the  letter  dated  21st"
"March 2012 (marked as ‘පෙ 04’ in the High Court). Additionally, the Appellant"
"sought  to  quash  the  1st  Respondent's  decision  to  allow  the  2nd  Respondent’s"
"appeal, contained in the letter dated 6th August 2012 (marked as ‘පෙ 08’ in the"
"High Court). The Appellant also requested a Writ of mandamus to compel the 1st"
"Respondent to hear the appeal submitted by the Appellant."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  the  Central  Province,  after  considering  the"
"Appellant’s Petition, the Respondents' objections, the submitted documents, and"
"the submissions filed by both parties1, dismissed the Appellant’s Writ application"
"in the impugned Order dated 25th October 2017."
"The Appellant subsequently filed an appeal to this Court against that decision."
"Analysis"
"I have already addressed the identical issue on the vires of Rule 49(xii), with the"
"concurrence of Justice M. Ahsan R. Marikar, in the case of Nalani Danawathi"
"Wijethilaka v. Registrar and the Commissioner of the Cooperative Development"
"Department of the Southern Province and two others2. Therefore, I will adopt"
"the same reasoning for this appeal."
