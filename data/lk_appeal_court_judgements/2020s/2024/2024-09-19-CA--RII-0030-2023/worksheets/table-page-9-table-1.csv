"S
ri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited v. Shanmugam and another [1995] 1"
"SLR 55, Ranaraja J. held as follows:"
"Restitutio in integrum is an extraordinary remedy; it is not to be given for mere"
"asking  or  when 
there 
is  some  other 
remedy  available, Mapalathan  v."
"Elayavan.  It  is  a  remedy  which  is  granted  under  exceptional  circumstances"
"and  the  power  of  court  should  be  most  cautiously  and  sparingly  exercised,"
"(Perera-supra).  A  party  seeking  restitution  must  act  with  utmost  promptitude,"
"Babun  Appu  v.  Simon  Appu),  (Menchinahamy  -  supra),  and  before  a  change"
"has taken place in the position of the parties, (Sinnethamby v. Nallathamby) ."
"Where there has been negligence on the part of the applicant seeking relief or"
"his  attorney-at-law, 
restitution  will  not  be 
granted (Wickremasoodya 
v."
"Abeywardene). The party invoking the extraordinary powers of this court must"
"display honesty and frankness. Thus,  where a party by its own conduct has"
"acquiesced in or approbated the defective proceedings, court will not exercise"
"its discretion to set aside the impugned proceedings. For it is not the function"
"of court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of"
"the  consequences  of  their  own  folly,  negligence  or 
laches. 
(Don  Lewis  v."
"Dissanayake)"
