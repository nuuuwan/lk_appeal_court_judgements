"of  difficulty  in  a  particular  subject  in  a  future  examination  and  plant"
"dummy  candidates  in  that  subject  or  in  other  subjects.  Considering  that"
"400,000  students  sit  for  the  CSE  preliminary  examination  all  over  the"
"country every year, this would perhaps require a large scale operation by"
"coaching institutes all over the country and that again presumes that they"
"will  somehow  correctly  predict  what 
the  overall  performance  of 
the"
"candidates in any particular subject. Then again, this is only a preliminary"
"examination at the end of which a shortlist of candidates 10 to 12 times the"
"number  of  advertised  posts  is  drawn  up  for  the  Main  examination.  It  is"
"nobody‟s  case  that  the  results  of  the  main  examination  are  somehow"
"affected in that process. Further still, this Court is unable to understand"
"the apprehension of the UPSC that by disclosing the working of the scaling"
"methodology for the preliminary examination, merit can get compromised"
"and  candidates  with  less  merit  would  be  selected.  The  whole  purpose  of"
"having  three 
levels  of  examination 
i.e.  preliminary  examination,  main"
"examination  and 
then 
interview, 
is 
to  ensure 
that  only  meritorious"
"candidates are selected for government service. We are of the view that the"
"apprehension expressed by the UPSC is not well-founded.”"
