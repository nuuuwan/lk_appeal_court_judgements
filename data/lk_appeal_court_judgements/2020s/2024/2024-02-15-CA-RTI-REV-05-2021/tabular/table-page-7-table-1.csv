"The Bank relies upon the cases,",""
"(i)","Jayasinghe  and  others  vs.  R.  S.  Jayaratne,  Secretary,  Ministry  of"
"","Public Administration and others (1999) 2 SLR 385. It was decided in"
"","that case,"
"","“The view that the function of the Commission upon a reference under"
"","section  12  is  not  simply  to  record  evidence  is  supported  by  another"
"","consideration. Section ""2 of the Act establishes the Commission as a body"
"","corporate, which ""shall"" consist of five members. It would appear that the"
"","Commission must act through all its members, because the Act makes"
"","provision neither for a quorum nor for the delegation of the powers of the"
"","Commission to one or more of its members; section 7 only enables the"
"","Commission 
to  act  notwithstanding  a  vacancy  or  a  defect 
in 
the"
"","appointment of a member. The purpose of a reference under section 12"
"","was  thus  to  enable  this  Court  to  obtain  the  benefit  of  the  collective"
"","wisdom of all the members of the Commission, and not just its notes of"
"","Investigation1.” (page 393) [It was about a matter that the court referred"
"","to the Human Rights Commission to obtain its views]"
"(ii)","Paskaralingam by his Attorney at Law vs. P. R. P. Perera and others"
"","(1998) 2 SLR 169. It was said in that case,"
"","“What is repugnant to the principles of natural justice is that only two"
"","out of the three Commissioners who held the inquiry chose to express"
"","their views. Such a report cannot, in my view, be considered a report of"
"","the  Commission,  as  contemplated  by  law2.”  (page  189)  [It  was  a  case"
"","about a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry]"
