"September, 2008 the High Court of Delhi comprising of Justice S. Muralidhar"
"and the Chief Justice (judgment authored by Muralidhar J.) said,"
"â€œ17. At the outset we wish to observe that a perusal of the documents"
"submitted by the UPSC in a sealed cover, are not of such a nature that"
"can be characterised as secret, or of a type the disclosure of which would"
"not be in public interest. As regards the scaling methodology, as already"
"been  pointed  out  by  the  learned  Single  Judge,  this  is  no  different  from"
"what already stands disclosed by the UPSC to the Supreme Court in its"
"counter affidavit filed in SLP (C) No. 23723 of 2002 and is therefore in the"
"public domain. As regards the apprehension expressed by the UPSC that"
"the scaling formulation could be deciphered first once the cut-off marks"
"and  solution  keys  in  respect  of  individual  subject  disclosed,  we  fail  to"
"understand  how  if  such  information  is  deciphered  in  relation  to  the"
"examination that has already been conducted, somehow it would enable"
"the manipulation of the results of a preliminary examination to be held in"
"future."
