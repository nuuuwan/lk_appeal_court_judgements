"analyze  evidence  of  the  witness  who  claims  that  the  accused  is  a  known"
"person and examine whether the evidence is satisfactory to bring home a"
"conviction”."
"Hence  in  the  instant  matter  the  encounters  of  the  victim  with  the  appellant"
"appear to be very brief and limited to a few words and during the incident the"
"appellant and the victim had not exchanged any words, as such the victim could"
"not have had a chance to identify the appellant by voice."
"As  such  we  are  compelled  to  agree  with  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant  that"
"identification of the appellant at the time of incident was not sufficient."
"Another point urged by the Counsel for the appellant was that although the"
"victim had alleged that she had been raped by four people the doctor had"
"not  observed  any  injuries  on  the  victim  which  she  submitted  was  rather"
"strange."
"This Court also having considered the medical evidence is of the opinion that the"
"victim had been subjected to rape by four persons and it is not with consent if"
"that is so the absence of a single injury on the victim casts a serious doubt with"
"regard to the credibility of the victim’s evidence."
"At  the  conclusion  of  the  case  for  the  prosecution  the  appellant  has  made  a"
"statement from the dock and had denied the entire incident but we do not want"
"to consider the dock statement because it is the prosecution which has to prove"
"its case beyond a reasonable doubt and in the instant matter the identification"
"of the appellant is seriously challenged, which we have held above has created a"
"reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution."
"Hence  we  hold  that  there  is  merit  in  the  submissions  of  the  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant and that it is unsafe to act on the evidence of the prosecution."
"As such the instant appeal is allowed and the conviction and the sentence of the"
"appellant is hereby set aside."
