"In the instant case, according to the document marked P21, there is evidence to show that,"
"the 7th Respondent had made applications to the Respondents with regard to the land in suit."
"Accordingly,  the  7th  Respondent  has  fulfilled  the  requirements  under  Section  68(2)  of  the"
"Ordinance, thus the 7th Respondent has come into the possession of the said land within six"
"months’ time."
"We are of the view that, once the nominated successor has fulfilled the requirements to be"
"eligible to be a successor, there is no reason for the 5th Respondent to consider Section 72 of"
"the Ordinance."
"Under Section 84 of the Ordinance, it gives the 7th Respondent who is a nominated successor"
"qualified under Section 68(2) of the Ordinance, entitlement to the succession of the said land"
"to obtain a permit from the Government Agent to occupy the land."
"We are of the opinion, that the 1st Respondent had acted according to law when he arrived at"
"the decision that the decision taken by the 5th Respondent, the former Divisional Secretary"
"was wrong."
