"Decided on 09.03.2016, (2016 BLR 171 at page 173),","",""

"","provisions of this Chapter shall not be construed as a disposition of the land for which",""
"such successor is nominated.” (emphasis added).","",""
"","The ordinance defines the term “Disposition” in Section 2 and reads thus:-",""

"","automatic  transfer  of  the  land  to  the  successor  nominated;  the  nominee  is  then",""
"","required to have the permit officially transferred upon making an application to that",""
"","effect to the relevant authority. In view of the statutory provision embodied in section",""
