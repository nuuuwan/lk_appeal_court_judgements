"According to the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent had sent a letter dated 29.08.2022 marked as"
"P22 to the 6th Respondent requesting inter alia to immediately cancel the title granted to the"
"Petitioner and grant the same to the nominated successor as advised by the 4th Respondent"
"by his letter dated 24.06.2022 marked as P21. Thereafter, the 6th Respondent cancelled the"
"title  granted  to  the  Petitioner  and  granted  the  same  to  the  7th  Respondent  on  30.09.2022"
"which is marked P24."
"The Petitioner thereafter filed a caveat on 28.09.2022 at the Land Registry of Anuradhapura"
"to  protect  his  interest  in  the  land  in  question.  The  Petitioner  had  come  to  know  that,  on"
"27.10.2022 his title to the impugned land was cancelled and granted to the 7th Respondent"
"through a notice dated 04.10.2023."
"The  Petitioner’s  main  contention  is  that,  the  1st  Respondent’s  decision  marked  as  P21  to"
"award the title to the 7th Respondent is illegal and ultra vires."
"The Petitioner has thus invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking for writs of Certiorari"
"to quash the decisions of the 2nd and 3rd, 4th,1st and the 5th Respondents contained respectively"
"in the letters marked as P19, P20, P21, P22 and P23 and to quash the documents marked as"
"P24 and P25."
"On the other hand, the 7th Respondent has taken the following preliminary objections."
