"from  the  Supreme  Court,  the  petitioner  has  preferred 
this  application 
in"
"revision before this Court."
"When  this  matter  was  supported  for  notice,  after  having  considered  the  facts"
"and the circumstances, this Court decided to issue notice to the respondents,"
"which included the Hon. Attorney General."
"The  respondents  were  allowed  to  file  objections  in  relation  to  the  application"
"before the Court. However, the Hon. Attorney General did not file objections. At"
"the hearing of this revision application, the learned Senior State Counsel who"
"represented 
the  Hon.  Attorney  General  and 
the  complainant-respondent-"
"respondent, 
informed  the  Court 
that  after  having  considered  the  charges"
"preferred  against  the  petitioner  and  the  unsatisfactory  nature  of  the  evidence"
"placed  before  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court  in  order  to  prove  the  charges,  the  Hon."
"Attorney General has decided not to object to the application filed in revision by"
"the petitioner."
"Accordingly, the learned Senior State Counsel invited this Court to pronounce"
"a suitable judgment in that regard."
"This is a matter where the PW-01 has not seen the incident, where some items"
"of movable property belonging to her had allegedly been set on fire, but heard"
"about  it  from  several  other  sources.  It  was  the  son  of  PW-01  and  one  of  his"
"friends who had given evidence at the trial as eyewitnesses. According to their"
"version of events, this incident has occurred at around 8.00 p.m. on the day of"
"the incident."
"It  appears 
from  the  evidence  that  the  petitioner,  who  was  also  a  worker"
"attached  to  the  Sub-Post  Office  where  PW-01  was  the  Post  Mistress,  had  an"
"animosity  between  them  due  to  him  being  suspended 
from  work. 
It  also"
"appears that the Sub-Post Office was situated in the land adjacent to the land"
"where  the  petitioner 
lived.  The  setting  of 
fire  to  goods  as  alleged  by  the"
"witnesses had taken place on the land belonging to the petitioner."
