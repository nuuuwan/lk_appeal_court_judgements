"“The  question  of  law  raised  by  the  petitioner  is  based  upon  a  failure  of"
"natural justice by not affording an opportunity to the petitioner to be heard"
"prior  to  the  said  variation  in  sentence.  A  basic  principle  of  procedural"
"safeguards is that a man’s defence must be heard fairly."
"An omission to give a party to a suit an opportunity of being heard is not"
"merely an omission of procedure, but is a far more fundamental matter in"
"that it is contrary to the rule of natural justice embodied in the maxim audi"
"alteram partem. (Dharmadasa Vs. Piyadasa (2008) BLR 208)”"
