"mandatory. As such, the sentence should start from 15 years and goes up to"
"20 years."
"In this case the Learned High Court Judge had imposed maximum sentence"
"of  20  years  on  each  count  to  be  run  concurrent  to  each  other.  I  think"
"imposing maximum sentence is not warranting in this case. As such, I set"
"aside  the  20  years  rigorous  imprisonment  imposed  on  each  count  and"
"replace  with  15  years  rigorous  imprisonment  on  each  count  to  be  run"
"concurrent to each other."
"Secondly, I set aside the Rs.300,000/-compensation imposed on each count"
"and replace with Rs.100,000/-  compensation on each count subject to 06"
"months default sentence on each count."
"The fine and default sentence imposed on each count will remain same."
"I  further  order  the  sentence  imposed  to  be  operative  from  the  date  of"
"conviction namely 20/11/2019."
"The appeal is, therefore, dismissed subject to above variation of the sentence."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Ratnapura along with the original case record."
