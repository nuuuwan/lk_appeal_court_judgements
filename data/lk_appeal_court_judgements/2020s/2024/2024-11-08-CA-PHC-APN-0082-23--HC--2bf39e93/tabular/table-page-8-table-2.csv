"Section 126A (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states:"
"No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in the High"
"Court,  to  adduce  evidence  in  support  of  the  defence  of  an  alibi,"
"unless he has â€”"
"(a)  stated  such  fact  to  the  police  at  the  time  of  his  making  his"
"statement during the investigation; or"
"(b) stated such fact at any time during the preliminary inquiry; or"
"(c)  raised  such  defence,  after  indictment  has  been  served,  with"
"notice to the Attorney General at any time prior to fourteen days of"
"the date of commencement of the trial:"
"Provided however, the Court may, if it is of opinion that the accused"
"has adduced reasons which are sufficient to show why he delayed to"
"raise the defence of alibi within the period set out above, permit the"
"accused  at  any  time  thereafter  but  prior  to  the  conclusion  of  the"
"case for the prosecution, to raise the defence of alibi."
