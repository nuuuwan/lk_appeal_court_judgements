"by  referring  to  any  writing  made  by  himself  at  the  time  of  the"
"transaction concerning which he is questioned or so soon afterwards"
"that  the  Court  considers  it  likely  that  the  transaction  was  at  that"
"time fresh in his memory."
"(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other"
