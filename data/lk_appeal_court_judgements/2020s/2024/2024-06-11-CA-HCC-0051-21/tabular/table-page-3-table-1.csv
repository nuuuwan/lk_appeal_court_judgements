"The mother of the victim also had been called to give evidence and she had said"
"that one day the victim had complained of a stomach ache and she had taken"
"the victim to the doctor, and she had said that the appellant who is related to"
"them  had  taken  the  victim  to  the  jungle  and  had  removed  her  undergarment"
"and had abused her. She had said that at that time she had been in year three."
"She  had  been  lengthily  cross-examined  and  she  had  said  the  same  thing  in"
"cross-examination also."
"Hence, the mother of the victim also does not say anything more of the alleged"
"sexual abuse."
"The  doctor  had  been  called  to  give  evidence  and  according  to  him  the  victim"
"had given him a case history and according to which the victim had said that"
"the  appellant  was  in  the  habit  of  taking  her  to  the  jungle  and  removing  her"
"undergarment and keeps his genitals between her legs. (page 132)"
"The  doctor  had  proceeded  to  examine  the  victim  and  he  had  found  a  certain"
"redness  in  the  vaginal  area  which  he  said  is  indicative  of  intervention  on  the"
"area which could be frequent fondling."
"The doctor had been cross-examined."
"Hence  the  doctorsâ€™  evidence  and  the  case  history  corroborate  the  victims  very"
"reluctantly given evidence."
"Thereafter,  the  prosecution  had  led  the  evidence  of  the  investigative  officers"
"and  the  prosecution  had  been  closed  and  when  the  defense  was  called  the"
"appellant had made a statement from the dock, and he had denied the incident"
"entirely."
"The  main  ground  of  appeal  raised  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  is"
"that  the  trial  judge  had  failed  to  evaluate  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution"
"adequately."
"Upon perusal of the brief, the victim had given evidence after 18 years which is"
"no  fault  of  the  victim  and  by  that  time  she  had  been  married  and  has  had"
"children. Hence, obviously her outlook has changed and it is only but natural"
"that she would not have wanted the old wounds to surface once more."
"Therefore, as very obvious from the proceedings she had been a very reluctant"
"witness and she had to be  prompted on numerous  occasions and the learned"
"trial judge had been very patient and mindful of the fact that the victim giving"
"evidence after 18 years would invariably cause some lapses in the evidence of"
"the victim."
