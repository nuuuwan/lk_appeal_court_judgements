"The  particulars  required  in  a  certificate,  as  stated  in  the  case  of  City  Carriers"
"Limited v. The Attorney General17 (S.C.), include the computation of the sum,"
"the period during which the sum became due, and details regarding the number"
"of employees involved in the computation, or their names and emoluments. In"
"Mohemmed  Ameer  and  Another  v.  Yapa,  Assistant  Commissioner  of  Labour18"
"(S.C.),  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  certificate  under  Section  38(2)  must"
"contain  the  names  of  the  employees  for  whom  the  default  is  alleged  or  be"
"otherwise adequately identified, along with the period during which there have"
"been changes in remuneration and/or the rate of contribution. Additionally, the"
"remuneration related to which the contribution and default have been computed"
"must also be disclosed."
"As correctly observed by the learned High Court Judge, the impugned certificate"
"contains  the  information  required  under  Section  38(2)  of  the  EPF  Act  and"
"adheres  to  the  judicial  precedence.  The  certificate19  includes  the  membership"
"numbers and names of the employees in respect of whom the default is alleged,"
"as  well  as  the  period  during  which  the  sum  became  due.  It  also  contains  the"
"remuneration  of  the  employees,  the  rates  of  contributions  made  by  both  the"
"employee and the employer, and the total aggregated amount. Additionally, the"
"surcharge  on  the  total  contribution  due,  and  the  aggregated  amount  is  clearly"
"stated in the certificate. The Appellant contended that the necessary information"
"was submitted to the High Court through the document marked 'Y', but not to the"
"Magistrate Court. Consequently, it was argued that the application under Section"
"38(2) is flawed. However, as I have mentioned earlier, the certificate includes"
"the  required  information  under  the  law,  and  the  document  marked  'Y'  only"
"provides additional information. Moreover, the document 'Y' has been certified"
"as accurate by the Appellant himself cannot be claimed as information unknown"
"to him."
