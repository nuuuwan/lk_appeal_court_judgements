"alleged incident.  He also contended that PW-1  stated in her evidence"
"about  penetration,  but  according 
to 
the  doctor, 
there  was  no"
"penetration and thus, her evidence is not credible."
"T
he 
learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel 
filed 
of 
the 
record 
the 
entire"
"proceedings  of  the  case  bearing  number  HCT/914/2019  in  the  High"
"Court  of  Trincomalee.  In  the  said  case,  this  accused-Appellant  was"
"indicted for three counts of rape. The victim in the said case is the same"
"victim of the instant case bearing number HCT/913/2019. The learned"
"SDSG  admitted  that  the  evidence  is  identical  in  both  cases  and  it  is"
"clear  that  evidence  was  taken  once  and  the  same  evidence  had  been"
"adopted in both cases. It is apparent that evidence was taken only in"
"one  case  among  the  aforementioned  cases  of  HCT/913/2019  and"
"HCT/914/2019  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  adopted  the"
"same evidence to the other case as well. When there are two indictments"
"in two cases, evidence led in one case cannot be adopted to the other"
"case, especially when the charges in one case are Rape charges and the"
"charges in the other case are Grave Sexual Abuse charges and that is"
"entirely a wrong and illegal procedure.   In addition, serious issues arise"
"from this illegal procedure adopted by the learned High Court Judge are"
"that the learned Judge had not at least taken the consent of the parties"
"to do so and that no one knows in which case the evidence was taken."
"At the commencement of the trial, in none of the cases, it is recorded"
"that the same evidence is adopted in both cases. Not only the consent"
"of the parties has not been taken to adopt the same evidence in both"
"cases,  but  also  the  learned  Trial  Judge  has  not  even  informed  the"
"parties  that  the  same  evidence  would  be  adopted  in  both  cases.  The"
"instant  case,  and 
the  case  bearing  number  HCT/914/2019  were"
"determined  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  using  the  same  set  of"
"evidence  and 
in 
the  case  bearing  number  HCT/914/2019, 
this"
"accused-appellant  was  acquitted  of  all  three  charges  and  in  the  case"
"bearing number HCT/913/2019, the accused-appellant was convicted"
"of all three charges."
