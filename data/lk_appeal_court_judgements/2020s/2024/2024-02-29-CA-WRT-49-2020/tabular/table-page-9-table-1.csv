"expiration of their validity period. None of these permits were rescinded during"
"their  term.  Given  that  the  permits  are  now  void  due  to  the  lapse  of  their"
"validity period, the necessity to grant relief as per prayer (b) does not arise."
"I
t is also imperative to note that Section 39 and 40 of the Mines and Minerals"
"Act, which  stipulates  the right of appeal afforded to a licensee in instances"
"where  the  licensee  is  aggrieved  by  a  decision  of  the  Geological  Survey  and"
"Mines Bureau (GSMB) to either cancel or decline to renew the license provides"
"an  opportunity  to  appeal  to  the  Secretary  and  therefrom  to  the  Supreme"
"Court. Therefore, it is evident that the Mines and Minerals Act provides a clear"
"statutory  remedy  to  an  aggrieved 
licensee,  mandating  adherence  to  the"
"prescribed  procedure,  rather  than  resorting  to  the  Writ  jurisdiction  under"
"Article 140, which constitutes a discretionary remedy. The  Petitioners have"
"not succeeded in substantiating, nor have they provided any rationale or, at"
"the very least, notified the court as to the reasons behind their failure to utilize"
"such prescribed appeal procedure."
"F
or  the  reasons  detailed  hereinabove, 
I  dismiss  the  Application  of  the"
"Petitioners and make no order as to the costs of this Application."
"Application dismissed. No costs."
