"Any individual desiring to engage in mining activities must obtain a license"
"from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) specifically authorizing"
"such activities, subject to the terms and conditions delineated within the said"
"license.  The  GSMB  issues  a  variety  of  mining  licenses,  all  of  which  are"
"temporally limited. Typically, such licenses are granted for durations of less"
"than one year, although in instances of industrial mining, licenses may extend"
"for one year. Consequently, upon expiration of the validity period of a mining"
"license, individuals are required to reapply to the GSMB for license renewal."
