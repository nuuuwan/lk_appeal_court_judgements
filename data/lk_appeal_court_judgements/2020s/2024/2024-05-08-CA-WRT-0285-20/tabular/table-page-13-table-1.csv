"University also. The Petitioner has admitted in the Petition that, the 9th Respondent who"
"is  the  Secretary  to  the  1st  Respondent  and  11th  to  15th  Respondents,  who  are  the"
"Chairman, Vice Chairman and a member of the 1st Respondent, a Vice Chancellor and"
"a  Registrar  respectively  were  members  of  the  Selection  Committee  at  the  time  the"
"Petitioner  faced  for  the  interview.  When  considering  the  recommendation  of  the"
"Selection Committee marked as P17 this Court can be satisfied that in the instant matter,"
"the Selection Committee has been duly constituted in terms of the Circular marked as"
"R10 and the 1st Respondentâ€™s decision marked as R8. Therefore, this Court cannot agree"
"with the Petitioner's argument that the Selection Committee was not duly constituted."
"At this outset, this Court is of the view that the decision of the 1st Respondent to appoint"
"the 16th to 40th Respondents to the posts of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar is"
"not  unreasonable,  illegal,  arbitrary  or  capricious.  Under  the  said  circumstances  the"
"Petitioner is not entitled to the relief prayed for in prayer (b) to the Petition for a Writ"
"of  Certiorari  to  quash  the  decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  to  appoint  the  16th  to  40th"
"Respondents to the Posts."
"Moreover, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that the Petitioner"
"has completed more than 12 years of service period to the date of the interview and she"
"has  better  qualifications  than  the  other  applicants  and  therefore  she  has  a  legitimate"
"expectation that she will be selected for the post of Assistant Registrar. The position of"
"the Respondents with that regard is that the candidates were selected not only based on"
"the results of the written examination but also on their performance at the interview."
"According to P9, a minimum of 40% marks should be obtained to be considered for"
"appointment and in terms of P6 and P9, no candidate could claim that he/she is qualified"
"to be appointed merely upon passing the written examination or for the reason that they"
"have been called for the interview. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot have any legitimate"
