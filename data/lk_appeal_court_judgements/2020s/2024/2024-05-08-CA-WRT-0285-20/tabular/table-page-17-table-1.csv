"It  is  apparent  from  Section  86(a)  of  the Act,  that  the  USAB  is  only  empowered  to"
"investigate into the appointments or promotions that have been made in contravention"
"of the SoR and the procedure for appointment. Therefore, it is clear that the USAB does"
"not  possess  any  power  to  decide  matters  regarding  allocating  marks  or  to  set  aside"
"promotions or appointments made by the 1st Respondent. Therefore, this Court is of the"
"view that USAB has correctly held that it is not empowered to do so as stated in its"
"Order. Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order"
"of the USAB."
"Considering all the facts and circumstances stated above, this Court is of the view that"
"the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the Petition to this Application."
"Therefore, the Application is dismissed. The Petitioner should pay Rs. 50,000/- to the"
"1st Respondent as the cost of this Application."
"Application dismissed."
