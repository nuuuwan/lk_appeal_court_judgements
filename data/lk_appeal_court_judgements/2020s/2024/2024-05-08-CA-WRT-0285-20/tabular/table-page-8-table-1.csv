"where the marking scheme was not given to the candidates, taken up the view that, since"
"the Petitioners have not shown that this affected their performance at the interview; and"
"there is nothing to suggest that the Petitioners would have performed any better had this"
"information  been  disclosed  and  all  candidates  were  equally  disadvantaged  in  this"
"respect. Held that, failure to make available the marking scheme used at the Interview"
"is not fatal."
"The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argues that at the interview the"
"Petitioner  should  have  awarded  more  than  40  marks  under  the  first  three  headings"
