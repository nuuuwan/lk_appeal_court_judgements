"CA/HCC/48/20"
"evidence presented from the correct perspective, he would have been inclined"
"to accept the testimony provided by the Appellant."
"Further,  the  Appellant  was  not  afforded  a  fair  trial  as  guaranteed  in  the"
"Constitution."
"Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the 1st, 2nd and"
"4th  grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant  have  very  serious  impact  on  the"
"prosecution case. As such, the 3rd ground of appeal is not considered in this"
"appeal."
"As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable"
"doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High"
"Court Judge of Colombo dated 05/03/2020 on the Appellant. Therefore, he"
"is acquitted from this case."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
