"Material  contradictions  create  serious  doubts  as  to  the  truthfulness  of  a"
"witness. Further it affects the prosecution case significantly and render the"
"testimony unreliable. Therefore, it is the profound duty of a judge to assess"
"whether the discrepancies undermine the overall credibility of the witness."
"Further the judge must determine its impact on the case."
"In number of cases the Apex Court of Sri Lanka repeatedly held that “serious"
"contradictions  which  go  to  the  root  of  the  case  render  the  prosecution"

"a scale obtained from the police welfare shop. The gross aggregate weight of"
"the substance was 11 grams. Weighing such a meagre amount in a welfare"
"shop scale raises very serious doubts as to accuracy  as most of the items"
