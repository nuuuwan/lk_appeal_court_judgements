"CA/HCC/417/2018"
"In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:"
"“It  is fundamental  that  the burden  is on  the prosecution. Whether  the"
"evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden"
"is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to"
"give evidence and explain the circumstances."
"In the first ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that"
"the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  scrutinize  testimony  of  sole  eye"
"witness according to principles established in law and failed to evaluate the"
"creditworthiness of the said witness."
"Eyewitness  testimony 
is  one  of  the  most 
important  kinds  of  criminal"
"evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial"
"task  of  evaluating  eyewitness  testimony.  This  sometimes  means  checking"
"whether  the  witness’s  story  fits  with  other  established  facts  of  the  case."
"However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified"
"directly.  In  such  cases  judges  will  have  to  look  at  whether  the  statement"
"comes from a reliable source."
"Further, an eyewitness’s testimony is probably the most persuasive form of"
"evidence  presented  in  court,  but  in  many  cases,  its  accuracy  is  dubious."
"There 
is  also  evidence  that  mistaken  eyewitness  evidence  can 
lead  to"
"wrongful conviction—sending people to prison for years or decades, even to"
"death row, for crimes they did not commit."
"In considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court   should look at the"
"demeanour  of  the  witness,  the  inherent  probability  of  the  account,  any"
"internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is consistent"
"with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has any bias"
"against the accused or any family or group to which the accused belongs,"
"whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account, and whether"
"the  witness’s  testimony  is  supported  by  the  testimony  of  other  witnesses."
