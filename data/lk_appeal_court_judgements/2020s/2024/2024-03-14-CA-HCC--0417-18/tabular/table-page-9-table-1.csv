"His  Lordship  in  the  above  judgement  is  of  the  view  that  a  person  may  be"
"convicted even on the evidence of one witness."
"In this case Learned High Court Judge adequately and sufficiently analysed"
"and scrutinized the evidence given by PW1 and correctly held that PW1 is a"
"credible witness. Hence, this ground has no merit."
"In the second ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel argued that the Learned"
"High Court Judge has anticipated certain evidence be led on behalf of the"
"defence and thereby shifted the burden on certain material issue."
"The use of the reversed burden of proof is controversial, as it can be seen"
"as violating  the  presumption  of  innocence  and  the  right  to  a  fair  trial."
"However, in some cases, it is seen as a necessary measure to protect public"
"interests and ensure that those who cause harm are held accountable."
"In this case when PW11, the investigating officer gave evidence the defense"
"suggested that the murder weapon, the knife was handed over to the police"
"by  the  mother  of  the  Appellant.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his"
"judgment  commented  that  this  position  of  the  defense  was  not  proved  by"
"calling the mother of the Appellant by the defense."
"Although this is a clear misdirection, but the evidence of PW1 and PW11 was"
"not contradicted by the defense at any material point. This misdirection does"
"not  affect  the  root  of  the  case  as  the  prosecution  had  led  cogent  and"
"incriminating  evidence  against  the  Appellant  that  he  is  the  person  who"
"committed the murder of the deceased. Hence, this ground also has no merit."
"In the third ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the the Learned"
"High  Court  Judge  misdirected  himself  by  failing  to  properly  evaluate  the"
"discrepancies, inter se contradictions on material points."
"In this case the defence could not mark any contradiction over the evidenced"
"given by PW1 and other witnesses. But the defence brought to the notice of"
"three omissions on the evidence given by PW1."
