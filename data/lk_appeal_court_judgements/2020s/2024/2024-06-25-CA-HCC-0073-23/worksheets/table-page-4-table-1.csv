"done by him alone. If each of several persons commit a different criminal"
"act each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of"
"them is liable for each such act as if it were done by him alone."
"To  establish  the  existence  of  common  intention  it  is  not  essential  to"
"prove  that  the  criminal  act  was  done  in  concert  pursuant  to  a  pre  -"
"arranged plan. It can be formed on the spur of the moment”."
"In  the  instant  matter,  the  appellant  and  the  other  accused  has  had  no  pre-"
"arranged plan but it is obvious that the common intention had been shared by"
"the appellant and the 1st accused at the time of the commission of the offence."
"Hence,  we  see  no  merit  in  the  submission  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant  that  the  conviction  of  the  appellant  is  bad  in  law  because  the  trial"
"judge  had  misapplied  the  principle  of  common  intention  when  convicting  the"
"appellant."
"The appellants statement from the dock had been rejected by the trial judge on"
"the basis that it had not been put to the witnesses for the prosecution."
"But, it is the opinion of this Court that the  evidence reveal that the  appellant"
"has clearly participated in committing the act of assaulting the deceased."
"The  doctor  had  found  five  injuries  on  the  deceased  and  one  injury  had  been"
"identified  to  be  fatal  and  the  trial  judge  had  taken  in  to  consideration  the"
"nature  of  the  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  incident  and  had  found  the"
"appellant guilty for an offence punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code"
"which I think is justified when considering the evidence of the eye-witness PW"
"16."
"But, this Court fails to see how the trial judge had disregarded the evidence of"
"PW3  who  has  clearly  implicated  the  appellant,  the  1st  accused  and  the  2nd"
"accused."
"But, as the trial judge has the priceless opportunity of watching the demeanor"
"and  the  deportment  of  the  witnesses  in  the  witness  box,  the  trial  judge’s"
"conclusion  that  PW3  has  been  a  witness  without  credibility  cannot  be  over"
"ruled."
"It has been held in the case of Sunil Jayaratne vs Attorney General 2011"
"2  Sri  L.R  92  that  “  unless  there  is  some  grave  miscarriage  of  justice  it"
"would not be appropriate to interfere with the judgment of the trial judge"
"who enters judgment after careful consideration of the first hand evidence"
