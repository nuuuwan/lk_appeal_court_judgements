"was married at the time of applying for the Permit marked as P1 is a material fact which"
"has  an  important  bearing  on  the  question  of  the  genuineness  of  the  Petitioner  in"
"obtaining the Permit marked as P1. Even though the Petitioner argues that she was not"
"married at the time she furnished the relevant information in applying for the Permit,"
"the Petitioner neither disclosed the time in which she made the application to obtain the"
"Permit nor has produced any material before this Court to prove the fact that she married"
"after applying for the Permit. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is"
"guilty  of  suppression  or misrepresentation  of  material  facts.  Furthermore,  this  Court"
"could observe a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner as the Petitioner was"
"married at the time of issuance of the Permit marked as P1 and she has not come before"
"this Court with clean hands."
