"Respondents for an inquiry to be held on 27.08.2018. At the inquiry, it transpired that"
"the Permit marked as P1 had been issued to the Petitioner as an individual falling into"
"the  “low-income  category”  despite  the  Petitioner’s  husband  being  a  salaried  public"
"servant. Then the letter marked as P9 was issued requesting the Petitioner to provide"
"salary details of her husband as of the date the Permit marked as P1 was issued. The"

"at the time P1 was issued. Moreover, it transpired from the documents produced by the"
"1st Respondent marked as R9(a) and R9(b) that the Petitioner’s father was holding a"
"pensionable post in a local authority. These facts were reported to the 5th Respondent"
"by the 3rd Respondent in the letter dated 09.10.2018 marked as R10(a) and by the letter"
"dated  06.12.2018  marked  as  R10(b)  the  3rd  Respondent  sought  advice  from  the  5th"
"Respondent  in  respect  of further steps to  be taken on that matter. Then by the letter"
"marked as P11 the 5th Respondent informed that it was appropriate to cancel the Permit"
"and  informed  the  Petitioner  by  the  letter  marked  as  P12  to  hand  over  the  Permit  to"
"facilitate the cancellation."
"The position of the learned DSG appearing for the 3rd to 5th Respondents  is that the"
