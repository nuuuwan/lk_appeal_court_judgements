"“The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed"
"before  the  court  when  an  application  for  a  writ or  injunction  is  made  and  the"
"process of the court is invoked is laid down in the case of The King v. The General"
"Commissioners  for  the  purpose  of  the  Income  Tax  Acts  for  the  District  of"
"Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmond de Poignac - (1917) Kings Bench Division"
"486. Although this case deals with a writ of Prohibition the principles enunciated"
"are applicable to all cases of writs or 13 injunctions. In this case a Divisional"
"Court  without  dealing  with  the  merits  of  the  case  discharged  the  rule  on  the"
"ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to"
"her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court"
"that there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit"
"and therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of Prohibition without going into"
"the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for a full and"
"truthful disclosure of all material facts that the court would not go into the merits"
"of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination.”"
