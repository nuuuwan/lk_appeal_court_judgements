"Although  Safrin  had  claimed  that  he  had  given  the  vehicle  to  1st"
"Accused on rent after singing an agreement which was marked as ‘X9’,"
"but in the agreement the 1st Accused had only placed his signature as a"
"witness  not  as  transferee  or  hirer.  Further,1st  Accused  in  his  evidence"
"admitted that he was unaware as to the owner of the vehicle."
"In  this  case,  although  the  2nd  Accused  to  whom  the  vehicle  had  been"
"given on rent as per ‘X9’ and pleaded guilty to the charge, failed to give"
"evidence at the inquiry."
"Now  I  am  going  to  consider  whether  the  grounds  of  appeal  raised  on"
"behalf  of 
the  Appellant  have  any  merit.  As 
the  appeal  grounds"
"mentioned  above  are 
interconnected,  all  appeal 
grounds  will  be"
"considered together hereinafter."
"As the law stands today, the Claimant in a vehicle confiscation inquiry"
"should prove that he or she had have taken all preventive measures on"
"a balance of probability. Hence, the Learned Magistrate should consider"
"all the evidence very carefully before coming to a conclusion."
