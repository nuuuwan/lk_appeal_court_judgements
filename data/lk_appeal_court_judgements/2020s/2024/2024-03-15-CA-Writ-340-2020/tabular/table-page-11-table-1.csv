"","C.A. WRIT 
340-2020"
"","as the Selection Committee of the interview board will select people based"
"","on how they present themselves during the interview."
"40)","The State Counsel Shamanthi Dunuwille, argued that the methodology for"
"","selecting  the  post  for  which  the  Petitioner  had  applied  for  was  known  to"
"","the  Petitioner  and 
the  marking  scheme  was  made  available 
for 
the"
"","candidates, on request."
"41)","The  Petitioner  failed  to  obtain  the  threshold  of  the  required  marks  that"
"","should  have  been  obtained  to  be  selected  for  the  post  of  Senior  Lecturer"
"","(Grade I/Grade II)."
"42)","The  Selection  Committee  had  acted  impartially  and  given  marks  for  the"
"","Petitioner considering his qualifications.  On perusal of R2 document part"
"","1(a) requires a Basic Degree with a 1st Class or 2nd Upper or a 2nd Lower to"
"","obtain the required marks referred to in the marking scheme."
"43)","As the Petitioner did not have a degree, in the required field, he had only"
"","obtained 5 marks for the particular part 1(a)."
"44)","For Part 1(b), the Petitioner had obtained 25 marks for his PhD.  For Parts"
"","2 to 5, the marks were given to the Petitioner by the Selection Board, after"
"","considering how he performed before the interview board."
"45)","In  considering  the  aforesaid  facts,  I  do  not  see  any  ultra  vires  caused"
"","related to the interview held for the Petitioner by the Selection Committee"
"","of the 1st Respondent University."
"46)","The average of his markâ€™s summary sheet had been submitted by R9.  On"
"","perusal  of 
the  said  average, 
the  Petitioner  had 
failed 
to  obtain 
the"
"","threshold  mark  of  60,  which  is  referred  to  in  the  marking  scheme  out  of"
"","100."
"47)","The foremost question that arises is whether the Selection committee has"
"","given these marks in accordance with the circulars issued by the UGC.  As"
"","per the facts and documents, the marking scheme had been approved by"
"","the 1st Respondent Governing Council on 25th May 2019."
