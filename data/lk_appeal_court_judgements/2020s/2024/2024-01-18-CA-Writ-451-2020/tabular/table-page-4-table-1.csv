"proceedings, the Application is futile."
"The facts of the case briefly are that the Petitioner to this Writ Application sat for the"
"General Certificate of Education (Advanced Level) Examination (hereinafter referred"
"to as G.C.E. A/L Examination) in Biology Stream in the year 2019 and the Petitioner"
"is one of the first batch of students to sit for the Exam under the new syllabus introduced"
"in 2017. It is stated in the University Admission Handbook (marked as P4) published"
"by the University Grants Commission (the 3rd Respondent), that following the Order of"
"the SC (FR) 29/2012 case the UGC has decided to consider the students sitting under"
"the old and new syllabuses as two distinct populations and would be allocated separate"
"island and district ranks and the admission to the State Universities would be decided"
"on  the  composite  average  percentage  which  would  be  based  on  the  results  of  the"
"previous  five  years.  Thus,  the  said  criteria  would  place  the  students  who  sat  for  the"
"G.C.E. A/L Examination in 2019 at a greater disadvantage compared to the ones who"
"sat  for the said  Exam  under the old  syllabus.  In terms  of P4, 55% of the candidates"
"would be admitted to State Universities based on the District Merit Quota basis (marked"
"as P4A). The Petitioner has restricted the prayers to the Petition to challenge the legality"
"of the District  Merit  Quota system  in  selecting students to  the Universities  from  the"
"G.C.E. A/L Examination."
