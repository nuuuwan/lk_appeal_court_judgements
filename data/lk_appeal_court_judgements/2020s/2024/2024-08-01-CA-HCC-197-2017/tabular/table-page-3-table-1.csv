"bed resting. The victim had been alone at home and the mother had gone for a"
"meeting. The accused had been a known party and according to her he had"
"lived about 10 houses away. The victim had said in evidence that while she was"
"lying on the bed, the accused had walked into the room and had sexually"
"abused her. She had struggled but had not been successful, but after some"
"time, the accused had run away and the victim had run off to tell her mother"
"about the incident."
"The victim had been lengthily cross examined and V1-V6 had been marked as"
"contradictions in her evidence. Some of the contradictions appear to be not"
"very important but V6 and two of the omissions in her evidence points out the"
"fact that although in evidence she says that she first told her mother but"
"apparently to the police, it is the aunt who had been told first. In evidence she"
"had said that the accused had threatened her, but she had not said so to the"
"police. Therefore, there are variations in her evidence at certain points."
"Her evidence had been corroborated by the aunt, but in her evidence too, there"
"is a contradiction marked as V7 and V8, which again creates a doubt that it"
"was not her mother but the aunt who had been told first, of the incident."
"Police had received the first complaint on the day of the incident and the"
"accused had also been arrested on the same day. The doctor had been led,"
"according to whom, the victim being exposed to sexual contact had not been"
"ruled out."
"According to the evidence of the appellant, he had said that on the day of the"
"incident, between 2pm and 4.30pm, he had been playing in a match with his"
"friend Mahesh, who had been called as a defence witness. The accused further"
"says, after 4.30pm, he went to work on the paddy fields. The accused had been"
"lengthily cross examined by the state counsel but he had been very consistent"
"in his position. This version of the accused had been corroborated by the"
"defence witness. His evidence too had stood the test of cross examination very"
"well. Therefore, I observe that the version of the accused is corroborated by the"
"defenceâ€™s witness."
"The main ground of appeal by the learned counsel for the appellant is that the"
"learned trial judge has not given reasons for his conclusions. This I observe to"
"be correct. On perusal of the judgement, I observe that evidence of PW-01 has"
"been reproduced but the omissions and contradictions has not been analysed."
"Thereafter the trial judge has analysed the evidence of PW-02 but has failed to"
"refer to the two contradictions in her evidence and the impact of the same."
"Thereafter the trial judge had merely said that PW-03. PW-04, PW-07 had been"
"led by the prosecution and it corroborates the evidence of the victim."
