"critical functions. If a verdict of 'guilt' of an accused is arrived at without"
"performing these functions in a lawful manner, indeed, as rightly pointed out by"
"the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant, the accused can rightfully"
"claim that he was deprived of a fair trial. A judgment of a criminal trial Court"
"which does not reflect that these functions have been carried out by the learned"
"trial judge in a lawful and sufficient manner, cannot be relied upon to satisfy an"
"appellate Court that the accused had received a fair trial, and that he had been"
"found 'guilty' in a lawful manner. However, a determination of whether or not the"
"accused has been deprived of the constitutional right (in terms of Article 13(3) of"
"the Constitution) to a fair trial should be founded upon not only whether or not"
"the trial judge has correctly performed the above-mentioned functions, but also"
"on a careful consideration of the totality of testimonies given by witnesses and"
"the evidence of the case. However, it is important to note that a verdict arrived at"
"without the proper performance of the afore-stated testimony and evidence"
"related functions would be unlawful and hence should be vacated in appeal,"
"only if such failure on the part of the trial judge had prejudiced the substantial"
"rights of the accused or occasioned a failure of justice.”"
"In addition to the above, the counsel for the appellant cited the case of Moses v"
"State 1993 (3) S.L.R pg 401, where Justice Hector Yapa has stated that, “A"

"When a criminal case is filed, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case"
"beyond a reasonable doubt and the criminal law in our country has laid down"
"that the presumption of innocence, with regards to the accused person,"
"remains so until it is proven otherwise. Hence, when the defence gives an"
"explanation on oath with corroborating evidence, it is the fundamental duty of"
"the trial judge to evaluate the same with an unbiased mind and see whether"
"defence evidence raises a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case. In the"
"instant matter, this court observes that the trial judge has failed to do so."
"The learned Additional Solicitor General requested this court to consider a re-"
"trial in this matter but since 16 years have lapsed from the date of the incident,"
"it is the opinion of this court, that it is not fair to both parties to send this"
"matter for a re-trial, as too much water has flowed under the bridge."
"Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that the trial judge has absolutely"
"failed to give a fair trial, which is enshrined in our constitution, to the"
"appellant. Therefore, it is the considered opinion of this court that the"
"conviction of the trial judge is illegal and bias and should be set aside. At this"
