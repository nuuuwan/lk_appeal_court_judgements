"prosecution or the prisoner…..the prosecution has not made out the case"
"and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.”"
"According to prosecution’s stance, the solicitation, which would constitute"
"an  offence  under  the  Bribery  Act,  was  committed  by  the  Appellant  in  this"
"case.  According  to  the  evidence  led  through  PW1,  he  had  first  met  the"
"Appellant at the Provincial Tax Office and inquired from him about his tax"
"liability. At that time the Appellant had informed the amount and solicited"
"Rs.25000/- from him to soft pedal the case. Hence, the Learned President’s"
"Counsel appearing for the Appellant strenuously argued that leading of that"
"evidence  is  highly  prejudicial  and  maybe  inadmissible  as  it  prejudices  the"
"case for the Appellant as the money recovered from the possession of the 2nd"
"Accused was given to him by the Appellant to begin with."
"Next, the Learned President’s Counsel argued that the learned High Court"
"Judge  had  failed  to  analyse  the  entirety  of  the  evidence  presented  by  the"
"prosecution as it contained serious inter se and per se contradictions.  He"
"further stated that the Learned High Court judge should have paid attention"
"to certain improbabilities and infirmities that surfaced in the prosecution’s"
"case."
"When a witness gives evidence before the court upon oath, he is expected to"
"tell  the  truth  in  a  court  of  law.  If  the  person  gives  contradictory  evidence"
"opposing the statement, it is usually called a contradiction. It is the duty of"
"the trial judge to unearth the truth and to come to a conclusion whether the"
"Accused person is guilty or not."
"According to PW1, after complaining to the Bribery Department a raid was"
"arranged. PW2 acting as a decoy had accompanied PW1, when he went to"
"give the money. PW2, the decoy had the money when the duo went  to the"
"Tax Office. The decoy had given the money to PW1. PW1 had then given the"
"same to the Appellant and the Bribery Department Officers had entered the"
"office and recovered the money from the 2nd Accused thereafter."
