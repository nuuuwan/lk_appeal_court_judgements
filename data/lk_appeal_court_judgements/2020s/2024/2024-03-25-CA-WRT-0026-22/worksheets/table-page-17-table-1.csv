"acted upon by His Excellency the President and there are no legally binding and operative"
"recommendations to be quashed. Therefore, the issuance of Writ of Certiorari as prayed for"
"by the Petitioner in this application is futile. The learned Additional Solicitor General suggests"
"to terminate the proceedings with liberty for the Petitioner to re agitate this matter if the"
"need arises."
"It is my view that the impugned recommendations and decisions of the 1st to 3rd Respondents"
"are not final and conclusive. Therefore, this matter is now futile and academic in view of the"
"fact that the decisions of the 1st to 3rd Respondents are not final and conclusive."
"W
hen this matter was taken up on 14.03.2022, it was submitted on behalf of the Attorney"
"General  that  the  Secretary  to  His  Excellency  the  President  Gotabhaya  Rajapaksha,  has"
"instructed the Attorney General that he does not intends to refer the report of the 1st to 3rd"
"Respondents  to  Bribery  Commission  or  Public  Service  Commission  but  to  await  the  full"
"recommendation  of  the  Special  Presidential  Commission  that  His  Excellency  the  President"
"Gotabhaya Rajapaksha has appointed, in terms of the SPCOI Act No 7 of 1978.  Thereafter this"
"matter was supported for Notice and Interim Relief. This Court issued the order Notice on the"
"Respondents  but  not  interim  relief,  holding  that  the  opportunity to  make  decisions  which"
"were prejudicial to the Petitioner no longer existed (Order dated 9.5.2022)."
