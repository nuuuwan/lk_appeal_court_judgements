"determined to some person's prejudice. It is of course possible for a Commission to"
"be appointed to inquire into and report on matters in respect of which it would not"
"be necessary for findings or determinations to be made against any persons. But this"
"is  not  such  a  case.  ""The  law  is  that  a  report  maybe  quashed  if  it  is  substantially  a"
"decision  rather  than  a mere  recommendation""  or  a  mere  expression of  an  opinion"
"which is mere evidence on which another may decide to act. """
