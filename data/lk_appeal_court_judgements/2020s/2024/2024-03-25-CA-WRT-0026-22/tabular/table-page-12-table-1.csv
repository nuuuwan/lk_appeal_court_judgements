"the Court by the Commission of Inquiry is in fact sub judice, and it is an interference with and"
"usurpation of the powers of the judiciary as well."
"T
he  1st  to  3rd  Respondents  of  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  have  shown  hostility  during  the"
"proceedings of the Commission.  The Additional Solicitor General, Mr. Vikum De Abrew, PC"
"was severely prevented from making submissions on three occasions and he was also warned"
"that  he  would  be  reported  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  charged  for  Contempt.    When  the"
"objection pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Commission of Inquiry was raised on behalf of"
"the 5th and 6th Respondents by the Additional Solicitor General, Mr. Rohantha Abeysuriya, PC"
"and  by  several  others  who  were  summoned  by  the  Commission  of  Inquiry,  including  the"
"Petitioner, the Commission disregarded the said objection without giving any Order."
"It 
is  crystal  clear  that  the  Commission  of 
Inquiry  has  shown  hostility  throughout  the"
"proceedings towards the parties that came before the Commission."
"The contention of the learned  Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Petitioner was that"
"there  has  been  no  compliance  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice,  in  so  far  this  Petitioner  is"
"concerned, the findings are ex-facie ultra vires and have no basis. It was further argued that"
"the findings are unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.  In the circumstances, the learned"
"Counsel for the Petitioner says that the findings and the report is ex-facie, ultra vires, void"
"and has no force or effect in law.  It is important to note that, an examination of the position"
"of the 5A Respondent, supports the position of the Petitioner, and fortifies the view that the"
"findings and the report ought to be quashed."
"T
his Court heard the Petitioner in support, and was inclined to issue Notices on or about 8th"
"February 2023. Notices were issued and served on the Respondents, who chose not to file"
"any  objections,  having  received  the  complaint  of  the  Petitioner.  The  Secretary  to  the"
"President sought to be added as the 5A Respondent. However, no objections had been filed"
"thus far by any of the Respondents for over a year, and on this ground alone it must deem"
"that the Respondents have no objection to the grant of the reliefs.  It was argued that on this"
"ground  alone,  the  reliefs  sought,  ought  to  be  granted.  In  any  event,  the  learned  counsel"
"submits that the findings and the Report is contrary to all principles of natural justice known"
"to law."
"The Petitioner argued that he was led to believe and had a legitimate expectation that no"
"findings and recommendations would be made against the Petitioner and there would be no"
"material  collected  against  the  Petitioner  to  the  detriment  of  the  Petitioner. 
In  these"
"circumstances, the Petitioner gave evidence, as was asked."
"H
owever, the Petitioner says that;"
"a. 
No proper charges were served;"
"b. 
No complaints have been served on the Petitioner; and"
"c. 
The nature of the charges against the Petitioner were not disclosed to"
"the Petitioner."
