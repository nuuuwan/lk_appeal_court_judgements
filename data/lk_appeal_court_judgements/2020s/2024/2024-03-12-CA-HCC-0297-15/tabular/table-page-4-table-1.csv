"H
ence,  we  are  unable  to  agree  with  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant  that  PW2  has  violated  the  provisions  of  the  EO  in  refreshing  his"
"memory by reading from the notes of PW1."
"Secondly  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  had  stated  that  PNB  officers  were"
"acting  unusual  when  they  had  not  searched  the  house  of  the  person  who  is"
"supposed to have provided the alleged substance to the appellant, but the PNB"
"officers had taken the said person in to custody for questioning."
"The  next  improbability  cited  by  the  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  was"
"that  soon  after  the  arrest  of  the  appellant  the  PNB  officers  had  gone  to  the"
"house  of  the  mother-in-law  of  the  appellant  but  had  not  searched  the  said"

"to agree with the evidence of the prosecution."
"The next point raised by the Counsel for the appellant is that the prosecution"
"had placed the evidence of a single witness during trial and the trial judge had"
"believed the said witness."
"At this point we draw our minds to the case of  Rajapaksha Pathirage Justin"

"“The incident that took place in this case is a good example for the trial"
"judges to remember that the police sometimes arrest people without any"
"reasons  and  later  introduce  contraband  or  similar  illegal  items  to  the"
"person arrested to justify the arrest. When the story of the police is false,"
