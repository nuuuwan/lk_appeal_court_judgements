"Hence, if the statute has not prescribed that there should be corroboration the"
"trial 
judge  can 
form  his  own  opinion  by  watching  the  demeanor  and  the"
"deportment of evenof the single witness."
"Hence, we see no merit in the ground raised by the learned President’s Counsel"
"for the appellant that the trial judge should have looked for corroboration."
"The  next  point  raised  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  is"
"that the case for the defense has not been considered."
"The  appellant  has  made  a  statement  from  the  dock  and  he  had  denied  the"
"entire  incident  and  had  said  that  he  had  been  arrested  while  he  had  been  at"
"home."
"This position of the appellant has been put to the main and the only witness of"
"the prosecution that is witness number 2."
"The  position  taken  up  by  the  appellant 
in  the  dock  statement  had  been"
"corroborated  by  the  wife  and  the  daughter  of  the  appellant  who  had  given"
"evidence on oath."
"Both  had  been  cross-examined  but  both  had  stood 
the 
test  of  cross-"
"examination well and has had no contradictions or omissions in their evidence."
"Hence, the defense of the appellant has been right through out consistent and"
"corroborated by the defense witnesses."
"But  we  note  that  the  trial  judge  had  referred  to  the  defense  position  and  has"
"rejected the same without analyzing the said position of the defense."
"He  had  rejected  the  defense  position  by  saying  that  if  the  appellant  had  been"
"arrested at home, the officers would have made notes but if that is so the whole"
"purpose of fabrication as alleged by the appellant would have been lost."
"Hence  the  said  possibility  has  not  been  considered  by  the  trial  judge  and  he"
"has  also  failed  to  consider  the  evidence  of  the  wife  and  the  daughter  of  the"
"appellant whose evidence has been uncontradicted."
"It is the opinion of this Court that the trial judge had been too eager to believe"
"the prosecution and disregard the defense."
"As  such,  by  not  considering  the  defense  evidence  with  the  same  weight  with"
"which he has considered the evidence of the prosecution we are of the opinion"
"that the appellant has been denied a fair trial."
"As such we are of the opinion that the denial of a fair trial to the appellant and"
"the improbability of the behavior of the PNB officers during the raid as pointed"
