"There had been several video recordings between the meetings of the accused-"
"respondents and the PW-01 as well."
"In leading evidence, the prosecution has marked the said video recordings, and"
"when the trial was taken up for further evidence, it appears that the prosecution"
"has  moved  to  mark  two  recordings  of  the  conversations  alleged  to  have  been"
"made between the PW-01 and the accused-respondents."
"When the prosecution moved to play the recordings of the production marked as"
"P-25, which was a pen drive, and P-27, which was a CD recording, the learned"
"Counsel who represented the accused-respondents, has raised an objection to"
"playing the recordings and marking its transcripts in Court."
"The said objection has been raised on the following basis."
