"defendant was convicted based on the evidence."
"In the appeal filed against the conviction, dismissing the appeal, it was held;"
"“That the older rule  that a party must produce the best evidence that the"
"nature of the case would allow no longer applied except where the original"
"document was available in the party’s hands. The Court was not confined"
"to the best evidence but could admit all relevant evidence. The goodness or"
"badness of it goes only to weight, but not to admissibility. The old rule was"
"confined  to  written  documents  in  the  strict  sense  of  the  term  and  had  no"
"relevance to tapes or films. Accordingly, the prosecution was entitled to rely"
"upon  the  copy,  which  copy  the  Justices  were  satisfied  was  an  authentic"
"copy of the original.”"
