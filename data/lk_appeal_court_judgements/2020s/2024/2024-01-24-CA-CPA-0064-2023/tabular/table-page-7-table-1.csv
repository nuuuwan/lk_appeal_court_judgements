"The  first  preliminary  objection  relates  to  a  defect  in  the  motion  filed  by  the"
"petitioner to get the case mentioned before the Court. However, it is abundantly"
"clear that the petitioner has stated in the caption of the motion as well as the"
"petition that this is an application filed invoking the revisionary jurisdiction in"
"terms of Article 138 of The Constitution reads with sections 364 and 365 of the"
"Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Although the petitioner may have"
"mentioned a wrong rule in the motion, it is abundantly clear that the petitioner"
"has a right to file an application of this nature, get the matter supported, and"
"obtain a suitable order from the Court. I find that, a minute technical defect of"
"such a nature shall not stand in the way of considering an application of this"
"nature before the Court."
"The 2nd preliminary objection raised was that the accused-respondents were not"
"noticed despite an interim relief being sought in the petition. As I have mentioned"
"earlier, although such a relief has been sought, the petition was not supported"
"for an interim relief. When this matter was supported without notice, this Court"
"only  considered  whether  there  was  any  basis  to  issue  notice  only,  and  after"
"having  satisfied,  the  relevant  notices  were  issued  to  the  accused-respondents"
"along  with  the  relevant  documents.  The  accused-respondents  can  claim  that"
"they were prejudiced only if an interim relief was granted by this Court without"
"them not being heard, which was not the case in this matter."
"I am of the view that none of the above preliminary objections has caused any"
"prejudice towards the accused-respondents and find no reason to consider the"
"said objections in favour of them."
