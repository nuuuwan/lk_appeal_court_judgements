"Per Nanayakkara, J.,"
"“The object of Civil Procedure Code is to prevent civil proceedings from being"
"frustrated  by  any  kind  of  technical  irregularity  of  lapse  which  has  not"
"caused  prejudice  or  harm  to  a  party.  A  rigid  adherence  to  technicalities"
"should not prevent a Court from dispensing justice."
"The Court  should not approach the task of interpretation of a provision of"
"law with excessive formalities and technicality. A provision of law has to be"
"interpreted contextually giving consideration to the spirit of the law.”"
