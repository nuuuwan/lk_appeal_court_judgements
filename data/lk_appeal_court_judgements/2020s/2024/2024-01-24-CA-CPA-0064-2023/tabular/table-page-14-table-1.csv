"circumstances. Section 114f is a reproduction of the best evidence rule which"
"according  to  Taylor,  ‘does  not  demand  the  greatest  amount  of  evidence"
"which  can  possibly  be  given  of  any  fact;  but  its  design  is  to  prevent  the"
"introduction of any, which from the nature of the case, supposes that better"
"evidence is in the possession of the party. It is adopted for the prevention of"
"fraud; for when better evidence is withheld, it is only fair to presume that"
"the party has some sinister motive for not producing it, and that, if offered,"
"his design would be frustrated.’ ”"
