"and had obtained his signature on the relevant documents. On a later date,"
"the Petitioner had been informed by the Interview Board that they came for"
"an  inspection  of  proof  of  residency  again  and  no  one  was  present  at  the"
"residence.  Subsequently, 
it  had  been 
revealed 
that 
the  name  of 
the"
"Petitioner’s  child  is  not  in  the  temporary  enrolment  name  list  under  the"
"“Children  of 
residents 
in  close  proximity 
to 
the  school”  published  on"
"28.01.2022 on the school notice board."
"Then  the  Petitioner  appealed  to  the  School  Appeal  Board  of  Admission  of"
"Children to Grade One against the rejection of the enrolment of his child to"
"the school. The members of the Appeal Board had come to the Petitioner’s"
"house on 25.02.2022 for investigation of proof of residency. When the Appeal"
"Board  visited  the  residence  neither  the  Petitioner  nor  his  wife  had  been"
"present at home. The signature of the Petitioner’s bother-in-law, Chandana"
"Gamagedara,  who  was  at  home  at  the  time  had  been  obtained  for  a"
"statement of ownership of the downstair of the house bearing No.83/27/A,"
"Ampitiya Road, Kandy by the members of the Appeal Board. However, the"
"Petitioner 
states 
that 
his 
brother-in-law 
Chandana  Gamagedara 
has"
"transferred the said downstairs of the house to the Petitioner by the Deed of"
"Gift bearing No.1801 dated 20.01.2017 marked P6b. It is submitted that the"
"brother-in-law of the Petitioner owns the upstairs of the house."
"Finally, 
the  Petitioner’s  application 
for  enrolment  of 
the  child 
to 
the"
"Mahamaya Girls’ School Kandy was rejected by the Appeals Board by its letter"
"dated  18.03.2022  marked  P18  on  the  basis  that  the  Petitioner  obtained"
"insufficient  marks  which  is  less  than  the  minimum  marks  required  as  the"
"Petitioner 
failed 
to  prove 
the  residency 
in 
three  site 
inspections.  The"
"Petitioner states that he has fulfilled all the requirements as per the relevant"
"Circular  and  obtained  sufficient  marks  at  the 
interview.  Therefore,  the"
"Petitioner claims that he had a legitimate expectation that his daughter would"
"be  admitted  to  Grade  01  of  the  Mahamaya  Girls’  School,  Kandy  under  the"
"category  of  “Children  of

in  close  proximity 
to 
the 
school”."
"Accordingly,  the  Petitioner  states  that  the  1st  Respondent  has  violated  her"
"authority and has acted against the law by neglecting Guidelines/Instructions"
"and Regulations regarding admission of children to Grade 01 in Government"
"Schools (marked P3A) issued by the Ministry of Education. It is further claimed"
"that  the  refusal  to  enroll  the  child  to  the  school  under  such  a  category  is"
