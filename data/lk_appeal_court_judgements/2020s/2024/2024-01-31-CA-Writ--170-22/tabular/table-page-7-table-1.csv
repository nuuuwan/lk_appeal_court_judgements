"Documentary proof"
"A few concerns have arisen at the interview in respect of the documentation."
"It is on the common ground that the Deed of Gift which the Petitioner claims"
"title to the property upon included certain discrepancies/errors in respect of"
"the registration, subject property, assessment number of the property, etc."
"The Petitioner has been given an opportunity to submit a Deed of Declaration"
"clarifying the above defect and a letter from the respective Grama  Niladari"
"confirming the assessment number of the house by the Interview Board. The"
"title of the Petitioner was questionable as the impugned property no.83/27A"
"was 
leased  out  by  Hitihamy  Mudiyanselage  Udula  Chandana  Bandara"
"Gamagedara transferor of Deed of Gift bearing no. 1801 dated 20.01.2017 to"
"another person called D.A.R. Ramanayake in the year 2020 by Deed no.112"
"dated 28.12.2020 (P12). The Petitioner submitted a document marked P13 to"
"support  that  the  said  Gamagedara  has  leased  out  only  the  upstairs  of  the"
"property  but  not  the  downstairs.  However,  said  document  P13 
is  not  a"
"notarial executed document."
"Physical inspection"
"The Interview Board arrived at the Petitioner’s residence for the first time on"
"23.11.2021 at 4.45 p.m. The Respondents state that the Petitioner was away"
"from the residence on that occasion, and he had arrived at the scene nearly"
"one hour later at about 5.45 p.m. only upon being contacted. Until such time"
"the  Respondents  had  visited  another 
location  nearby  for  an 
inspection."
"However, following the arrival of the Petitioner, having considered the time,"
"the members of the Interview Board had determined that it was too late for"
"an 
inspection  of  the  Petitioner’s  residence  on  that  particular  day.  The"
"members of the Interview Board had left the premises without inspecting the"
"Petitioner’s house on that occasion, but they had obtained the signature of"
"the  Petitioner  to  demonstrate  the  arrival  of  the  Interview  Board  at  the"
"premises."
"However, 
the  Petitioner’s  narrative 
is  quite 
contrary 
to 
that  of 
the"
"Respondents. The Petitioner denies the fact that he was not at home on such"
"an occasion. The Petitioner states that his wife, daughter and himself were at"
"the home on the occasion and he invited the Interview Board to inspect the"
"house.  Nevertheless,  the  Principal  has  said  that  they  were  very  tired  and"
