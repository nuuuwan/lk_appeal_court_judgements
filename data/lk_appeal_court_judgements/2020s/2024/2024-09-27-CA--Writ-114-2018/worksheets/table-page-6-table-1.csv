"The  1st  to  4th  Respondents  submit  that  the  purported  license  P1  does  not"
"appear to make any reference to a successor. Upon a careful perusal of P1, it"
"has come to my attention that the permit holder of P1 has nominated  one"
"H.M. Banda as successor. However, it is not certain that the said H.M. Banda"
"and the Petitioner are the same since the Petitioner’s name  appears in the"
"pleadings and the document marked P5 as H.M. Bandaranayake. No evidence"
"has been placed before this Court  for this  Court to reach upon a favorable"
"conclusion  for  the  Petitioner  concerning  the  above  matter.  Under  such"
"circumstances, and upon considering the materials placed before this Court,"
"this Court is not in a position to consider the applicability of above Section 48A"
"in respect of the Petitioner’s claim, as the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the"
"factual matters specified under Said Section."
