"victim on the lap of the appellant seated in a way which he had not liked, and"
"then he had called her and taken her to the father of theirs and the victim had"
"narrated the incident to the father."
"Upon analyzing the evidence of the brother, we find that his evidence seems to"
"be too mature for a child of 9 years of age because he takes the step of taking"
"the victim to the father to divulge the incident and refrains from narrating the"
"incident  himself  to  the  father  which  would  have  been  the    most  the  probable"
"thing for a child of that age."
"Thirdly  the  prosecution  has  led  the  evidence  of  the  victims  farther  who  had"
"tried to corroborate the evidence of the victim but he had contradicted himself"
"in trying to describe what the victim is supposed to have told him."
"But  it  has  to  be  noted  that  he  has  been  cross-examined  by  the  defense"
"whether he had any land dispute with the appellant to which he had said no."
"The  instant  matter  had  been  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  authorities  by  a"
"school  teacher  of  the  victim  who  had  questioned  the  victim  upon  hearing"
"rumors  and  the  victim  is  supposed  to  have  divulged  in  the  teacher  as  well,"
"hence the lodging of the complaint had been delayed."
"The  doctor  who  has  examined  has  stated  to  Court  that  the victim  in  the  case"
"history had said that the appellant had got her to touch his penis but where as"
"in  Court,  she  had  said  that  the  appellant  embraced  her  in  a  way  that  her"
"genitals rubbed on his penis. But at this point we observe that the trial judge"
"had  acquitted  the  appellant  for  the  charge  which  describes  what  has  been"
"stated to the doctor. Hence the finding of the trial judge is not corroborated by"
"the medical evidence."
"At  the  conclusion  of  the  case  for  the  prosecution,  the  appellant  has  given"
"evidence on oath and had said that the father of the victim had a dispute with"
"him with regard to the way he has distributed his paddy lands among the five"
"children and as such the father of the victim had falsely implicated him."
"He  also  speaks  to  a  dispute  with  regard  to  the  distribution  of  some  fertilizer,"
"and  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  has  been  corroborated  by  the  wife  and  the"
"prosecution  witnesses  also  had  been  cross-examined  on  the  dispute  between"
"the parties by the defense, and the prosecution had not been able to challenge"
"the credibility of the appellant and his wife in the witness box."
