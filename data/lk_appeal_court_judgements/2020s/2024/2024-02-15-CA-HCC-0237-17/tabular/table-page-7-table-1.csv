"observed by the Court of Appeal that “The learned trial judge has come to the"
"conclusion that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt"
"before 
considering 
the 
defence 
evidence 
which 
rendered 
subsequent"
"consideration  of  the  defence  evidence.  It  is  cardinal  rule  in  our  criminal  law"
"that every person charged with an offence is entitled to a fair trial and shall be"
"presumed  innocent  until  he  is  proved  guilty.  (Article  13(3)  and  13(5)  of  the"
"constitution)  This  presumption  of 
innocence  should  be  operative  until  the"
"learned trial judge perused and analyzed the entirety of the evidence led in the"
"case, that of the prosecution as well as that of the defence”."
"Therefore,  I  agree  with  the  contention  of  the  learned  president’s  counsel  that"
"the trial judge should have concluded that the prosecution has proved the case"
"beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  only  after  evaluating  the  prosecution  evidence  as"
"well as the defence evidence."
"However, if the learned trial judge had properly evaluated the defence evidence"
"and  correctly  considered  whether  the  defence  evidence  creates  a  reasonable"
"doubt on the prosecution case, mentioning that the prosecution has proved the"
"case  beyond  a 
reasonable  doubt  only  after  considering 
the  prosecution"
"evidence could be disregarded."
"In  the  instant  case, it  is  apparent  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not"
"properly evaluated the defence evidence, especially, the inconsistencies inter se."
"Justice  Menaka  Wijesundera  has  explained  very  clearly  that  the  credibility  of"
"the  accused-appellant’s  evidence  as  well  as  the  evidence  of  the  other  defence"
"witnesses  has  not  been  challenged 
in  cross-examination,  and  the  defence"
"evidence  is  consistent  and  cogent.  Hence,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge’s"
"finding  that  the  defence  evidence  did  not  cast  a  reasonable  doubt  on  the"
"prosecution case is wrong, according to my view."
