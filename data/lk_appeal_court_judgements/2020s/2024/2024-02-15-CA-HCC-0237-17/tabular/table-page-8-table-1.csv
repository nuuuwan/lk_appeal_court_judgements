"In addition, it must be noted that the prosecution called the father, brother of"
"PW-1,  and 
the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  who  examined  PW-1 
in  order 
to"
"corroborate PW-1’s evidence. Hence, it is important to consider whether PW-1’s"
"evidence has been corroborated by the evidence of these three witnesses."
"It is needless to state repeatedly that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove"
"the  charges  against  the  accused  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  As  explained  by"
"Justice  Wijesundera 
in  her 
reasoning,  PW-1’s  evidence  and  her 
father’s"
"evidence  are  contradictory.  PW-3,  her  brother  stated  in  his  evidence  that  he"
"saw  his  sister 
(PW-1)  sitting  on  the 
lap  of  the  grandfather 
(the  accused-"
"appellant) when he went to that house (page 78 of the Appeal Brief). However,"
"PW-1  has  stated  very  clearly  that  the  sexual  act  that  she  described  occurred"
"when  she  was  standing  in  front  of  her  grandfather  while  he  was  seated  (page"
"37 of the Appeal Brief). Therefore, PW-1’s evidence and her brother’s evidence"
"as  to  how  the  sexual  act  was  performed  are  also  contradictory.  The  other"
"witness who was called to corroborate PW-1’s evidence is the Judicial Medical"
"Officer (PW-9). In the Medico-Legal Report he submitted, the short history given"
"by PW-1 is mentioned. PW-1 had stated to the JMO that the appellant had got"
"her  to  touch  his  penis.  However,  she  has  never  stated  to  the  JMO  anything"
"about the sexual act described in count one of the indictment for which he was"
"convicted.  Furthermore,  the  JMO  stated  in  his  evidence,  that  PW-1  said  in"
"giving the short history that she was asked to touch her “Loku Aththa’s” genital"
"area, and she touched that area over the sarong that he was wearing (page 131"
"of  the  Appeal  Brief).  That  was  the  only  incident  that  took  place,  according  to"
"the  history  given  by  PW-1  to  the  doctor  who  examined  her  after  the  incident."
"Therefore, the aforesaid all three witnesses who were called by the prosecution"
"to  corroborate  PW-1’s  evidence  have  not  corroborated  her  evidence  but"
"contradicted her evidence with regard to the sexual act described in the count"
"one for which the accused-appellant was convicted."
