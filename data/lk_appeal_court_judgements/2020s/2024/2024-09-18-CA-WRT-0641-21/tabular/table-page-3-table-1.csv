"by letter dated 21-10-2020 (P13) affirmed the decision of the 3rd Respondent"
"pertaining  to  the  cancellation  of  the  permit  marked  P1.  Being  aggrieved  by"
"the said decision, the Petitioner by letter dated 23-10-2020 lodged an appeal"
"before the 1st Respondent (P14). After inquiring, the 1st Respondent by letter"
"dated 30-03-2021 (P17) informed the 3rd Respondent that the cancellation of"
"the  said  Permit  is  erroneous  and  directed  her  to  issue  a  new  Permit  to  the"
"Petitioner under section 20A of the Land Development Ordinance (P17) within"
"one month. By letter dated 09-08-2021 (P18), the 1st Respondent directed the"
"3rd Respondent not to proceed with the Quit Notice marked as P6. Thereafter,"
"at 
the  request  of 
the  1st  Respondent,  a 
fresh  plan  was  made  by 
the"
"Government  Surveyor  on  13-08-2021 
(P20).  The  1st  Respondent  being"
"satisfied  with  the  facts  that  the  Petitioner  has  developed  the  land  which  is"
"described 
in  P1,  by 
letter  dated  21-09-2021 
(P21),  directed 
the  3rd"
"Respondent  to  issue  a  long-term  lease  of  1  Rood  and  31.8  Perches  of  land"
"which the Petitioner had developed in addition to the land described in P1."
"Though  the  1st  Respondent  directed  the  3rd  Respondent  not  to  take  steps"
"under the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of"
"1979 (as amended), the 3rd Respondent instituted action in the Magistrate’s"
"Court of Hambantota in case No. 59922 against the Petitioner (P23). On 25-"
"11-2021, the learned Magistrate of Hambantota made an Order to evict the"
"Petitioner from the land in dispute.  The Petitioner states that at the time of"
"issuing the Quit Notice marked as P6 he was in possession of the said land"
"by virtue of a valid permit marked as P1,  and therefore, instituting the said"
"action upon the said Quit Notice is bad in law. Moreover, the 3rd Respondent"
"has  a  statutory  duty  to  carry  out  the  directions  of  the  1st    Respondent.  In"
"those circumstances, the Petitioner seeks, inter alia, that;"
"1.  A Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting any further proceedings or any other"
"steps including the enforcement of the Order of the Learned Magistrate"
"dated  25-11-2021  in  case  No.  59922,  a  declaration  that  the  Permit"
"marked P1 is a valid document, a declaration that the decision of the"
"3rd Respondent (P8A) canceling the said permit is null and void in law."
"2.  A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained in P8A and a Writ"
"of  Mandamus  directing  the  3rd  Respondent  to  issue  a  permit  to  the"
"Petitioner as directed by the 1st Respondent and grant a long-term lease"
"as contained in P21."
"It is pertinent to note that the Quit Notice marked as P6 was issued by the 3rd"
"Respondent on 19-09-2019 and the permit marked as P1 was cancelled on"
"25-09-2020 (P8A). As such, it is abundantly clear that at the time of issuing"
"the Quit Notice, the Petitioner was in possession of the subject matter upon a"
"valid  permit  issued  by  the  State  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  the  Land"
"Development Ordinance. In those circumstances, it appears to this Court that"
"the  said  Quit  Notice  and  the  subsequent  proceedings 
instituted 
in  the"
"Magistrate’s Court of Hambantota upon the said Quit Notice are bad in law."
