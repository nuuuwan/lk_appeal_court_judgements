"","""...It has been said by Lord Denning in the case of Kanda vs. Government of"
"","Malaya  that,  ""If  the  right  to  be  heard  is  to  be  a  real  right  which  is  worth"
"","anything,  it  must  carry  with  it  a  right  in  the  accused  man  to  know  the  case"

"contradict""  the  said  witnesses  when  they  gave  evidence,","in  my  view  has"
"","occasioned a violation of the principle of natural justice, that a man's defence"
"","must  always  be  fairly  heard.  The  non  observation  of  the  said  principle  of"
"","natural  justice  would  consequently  amount  to  an  error  on  the  face  of  the"
