"unchallenged view expressed by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for almost a hundred"
"years.”"
"F
urthermore, this Court would like to note that Section 11 was amended by Section 11A"
"of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 20 of 2013. The provision to state a case to"
"the Court of Appeal was brought in by the new amendment. By the said amendment the"
"Legislature brought in the right of appeal by way of a case stated to the Court of Appeal."
"However, the Legislature also prescribes the procedure for the same. The right of appeal"
"by way of a case stated was given to the aggrieved party but it had to be exercised within"
"the stipulated time frames as the Legislature brought in the right of appeal tied with time"
"frames.  Thus, it was the intention of the Legislature to enact Section 11A to invoke the"
"appeal process of the Court of Appeal and doing so to bring in a time period for the"
"transmission of the stated case to the Court of Appeal."
"I
s Section 11A (2) an invocation of jurisdiction clause under the TAC Act?"
"It was also the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that Section 11A (2)"
"is  not  an  invocation  of  jurisdiction  clause  and  therefore  that  the  said  Section  is  not"
"mandatory."
"T
he  learned  Counsel’s  contention  is  that  the  invocation  of  the  Court  of  Appeal’s"
"jurisdiction commences with Section 11A (1). Hence subsection (2) of Section 11A not"
"being an invocation clause, is directory."
"T
his Court observes the right to appeal is given to a party under Section 11A (1)."
"A
 distinction that I wish to draw is that under Section 11A (1) the aggrieved party is"
"making an application to state a case stated on a question of law. There is a difference"
"between the application to state a case and the result pursuant to the application which"
"is the case stated and its transmission to the Court for its opinion."
"T
he jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal pertaining to the case stated commences only"
"when a case is stated under Section 11A (2) and the said case stated is transmitted to"
"the Court of Appeal and not on the application by the aggrieved party seeking to state a"
"case from the TAC."
