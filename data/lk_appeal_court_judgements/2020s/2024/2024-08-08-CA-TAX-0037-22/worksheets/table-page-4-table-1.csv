"L
 
et me first consider the Respondent’s objection."
"T
here is no dispute that the Appeal was made under Section 11A of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended by Act, No. 20 of 2013. The Respondent’s"
"contention was that there should be a strict construction of the language in giving an"
"interpretation to Section 11A (2) and that noncompliance is fatal."
"It is contended that, the said provision is a mandatory requirement. In support of this"
"contention  the  Respondent  has  cited  several  authorities.  The  Respondent  relied  on"
"Perera  v  Perera  and  another  [1981]  2  SLR  41  (referred  to  as  “Perera’s  case”),"
"Premasiri Dias Balasuriya v Padukkage Jayantha Samaratunge C.A. No. 03/1977(F)"
"CA  minutes  14.10.2011,  Thilagaratnam  v  E.A.P.  Edirisinghe  [1982]  1  SLR  56,"
"Edirisuriya v Navaratnam [1985] 1 SLR 100, Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others v"
"Dharmasena Dissanayake SCFR 206/2008 S.C.M. 09.12.2016. (“Demuni Sriyani de"
"Soyza’s case”)."
"T
herefore, the contention that this Appeal filed in non-compliance with the provision"
"of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, which would be herein after called the TAC Act,"
"should fail."
"Considering the objections of the Respondent and the authorities relied on, the Court"
"observes,"
"I
n Perera’s case, the issue was pertaining to the compliance with the provisions of the"
"Civil Procedure Code."
"S
ection 756(4) of the Civil Procedure Code specifically states that an  application for"
"leave to appeal should be made within fourteen days and it further stipulates how the"
"said  time  period  should  be  computed.  Further,  upon  failure  to  comply  with  the  said"
"provision the statute itself provides for the application to be rejected. The Tax Appeals"
"Commission Act has no such consequential provision and I find the facts of the said"
"case is totally different to the application before me."
