"T
 
o elaborate further, and in giving my mind to the said clause, I observe that the short"
"note to Section 11A (1) states “Appeals on a question of law to the Court of Appeal.”"
"In my view, this Section commences the Appeal processes by recoursing to the TAC to"
"state a case, but does Section 11A (1) enable the Court of Appeal to possess the case"
"stated?"
"I
t is my considered view, that the actual jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal commences"
"only once it is in possession of the appeal brief pursuant to transmitting the said case to"
"the Court of Appeal. That happens only pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 11A being"
"complied.  A  party  can  always  seek  the  TAC  to  state  a  case  under  Section  11A  (1)."
"However, if the said stated case is not transmitted to the Court of Appeal, will the Court"
"of Appeal have power to deal with the stated case? Can the Court give ancillary orders"
"or act pursuant to subsection (6) pertaining to a stated case not transmitted to the Court?"
"The  party  who  has  received  the  case  stated  can  keep  it  for  as  long  as  the  said  party"
"wishes but until it is transmitted to the Court of Appeal, the Court will be unaware of"
"the invocation of the appeal procedure pursuant to Section 11A (1). It is also pertinent"
"to note that the Court of Appeal will have no control over the case stated which is in the"
"hands of the party who sought the same, unless it is transmitted to the Court of Appeal."
"Therefore, I am not in agreement with the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor"
"General."
"H
ence, in my view, Section 11A (2) of the TAC Act is an invocation of jurisdiction"
"clause. It is also my considered view that an invocation of jurisdiction clause attached"
"with a time limit is mandatory.  Therefore, a  case stated has to be transmitted to this"
"Court within the stipulated time period, and noncompliance is fatal."
"F
urthermore, all the cases cited by the Respondent to justify the argument that Section"
"11A (2) is directory cannot be availed, as in the said cases the time limit attached to an"
"invocation of jurisdiction clause was not an issue before the Courts."
"I
n  coming  to  this  conclusion,  I  have  also  considered  the  fact  that  in  this  case  the"
"Appellant is the CGIR, but what if it is a taxpayer who seeks to evade the payment of"
"tax? In such a case the aggrieved party not being the CGIR, can appeal to the TAC and"
"seek a case to be stated and once it is received, he can take his own time to transmit it"
"to  the  Court  of  Appeal.  If  I  am  to  accede  to  this  submission  an  errant  taxpayer  by"
"12"
