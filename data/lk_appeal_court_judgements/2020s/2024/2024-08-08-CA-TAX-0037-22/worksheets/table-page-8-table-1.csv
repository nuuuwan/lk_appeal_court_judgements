re the two limbs of Section 11A (2) separable?"
"It is also pertinent to note that for this Court to exercise the Appellate powers under"
"Section  11A  (2),  merely  transmitting  the  case  is  not  sufficient  but  it  has  to  be  done"
"within the period of time envisaged in the Section. For this reason, in my view, these"
"two requirements are not separable as the Legislature in its wisdom has stipulated that"
"the invocation of the appeal process under the TAC Act be completed only upon the"
"fulfillment of these two requirements. This will be elaborated more elsewhere. I observe"
"that the Statute is silent on the power of Court to give an extension for the time period."
"I do not find any provisions that enable the Court of Appeal to extend this time period"
"as the Legislature has not given that power under subsection (2) of Section 11. In my"
"view, a power that has not been given by the Legislature in a  statute when invoking"
"Section 11A (2) cannot be assumed by the Court."
"I
n coming to the above conclusions, this Court has also considered Section 165 (1) of"
"the Inland Revenue Act, where a person aggrieved by the amount assessed made under"
"the Act can appeal to the CGIR within 30 days of the notice of assessment. However,"
"the proviso to the said Section also gives the CGIR power to grant an extension of time"
"under  the  conditions  stipulated  therein.  I  do  not  find  such  a  luxury  offered  to  the"
"offending party when he fails to comply with the time limit stipulated under  Section"
"11A (2) as such power is not vested with the Court under the provisions of the Act."
"I
n this context, I have considered the case of Petch v Gurney [1994] STC 689 at page"
"695. The facts of the said case are very much similar if not identical to the present case"
"before  this  Court.  It  refers  to  Section  56  (4)  of  the  Taxes  Management  Act  1970  of"
"England which contains once again similar if not identical wording with the exception"
"of the time period to Section 11A (2) of the TAC Act. At this stage it would be prudent"
"to consider the words of Section 56 (4) of the said Act. It reads as follows:"
"“Section 56"
"(4) The case shall set forth the facts and the determination of the Commissioners,"
"and the party requiring it shall transmit the case, when stated and signed, to"
"the High Court, within thirty days after receiving the same.”"
