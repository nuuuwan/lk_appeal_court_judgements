"invoking the appeal process can successfully delay the process of collecting revenue to"
"the State."
"S
pecially,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  this  Court  has  recognized  that  the  State  is  not  a"
"privileged  suitor  in  a  tax  appeal  matter,  the  scales  of  justice  should  be  equal  when"
"applying the procedural law to all litigants. If this  Court is to uphold the application"
"made by the learned Deputy Solicitor General to determine that the Appellant in this"
"case, the State can transfer the case to the Court of Appeal without complying with the"
"requirement  of  doing  so  within  fourteen  days,  the  same  will  be  applicable  to  an"
"aggrieved taxpayer who seeks a case stated and prevent the collection of revenue. In my"
"view, this would make the words in the statute giving a time limit nugatory. Also, as"
"stated above it can be used to stifle revenue collection by a party who wants to avoid"
"payment of tax."
"F
urthermore, in this instance, the delay was caused not by the TAC or a Court before"
"whom the litigating parties are seeking redress. The delay has been caused by one of"
"the 
litigating 
parties 
themselves.  Hence 
the  Appellant’s 
argument 
based 
on"
"Visuvalingam’s case that an innocent party should not be penalized for the failure of"
"the Court, or the adjudicating authority cannot be sustained and will not apply in this"
"instance."
"W
ithout  prejudice  to  the  above  but  for  the  completeness  of  the  consideration  of  the"
"arguments forwarded, at this stage, the Court will consider the response of the Appellant"
"in view of the decision in the Amadeus Lanka case. The Appellant’s main argument is"
"that the time period stipulated under Section 11A (2) is not mandatory. The rationale of"
"the Appellant’s argument is that though the statute prescribes a time, Parliament has not"
"stipulated the consequence in the event of a breach. The Appellant finds support for this"
"argument in the Amadeus Lanka Case. The Court has considered the said case and I"
"find that the Amadeus Lanka case considers Section 10 of the TAC Act. Section 10"
"stipulates that the Commission should hear  and determine all  applications within the"
"time stipulated. In the said determination in a nutshell the Court was of the view that"
"though 
there  are 
time 
limits 
imposed, 
if  a 
remedial  action  or  sanction 
is  not"
"accompanying the said time limit, then the Court would be reluctant to consider it as a"
"mandatory provision.  However, as stated above in said case the Court was not invited"
"to  deliberate  on  the  mandatory  nature  of  a  time  limit  attached  to  an  invocation  of"
"jurisdiction clause. Hence, the facts and circumstances of the said case differs from the"
"case before me."
