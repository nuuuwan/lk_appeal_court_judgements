"but  of  an  entirely different transaction  occurred  on  different dates.  It  was  his"
"position  that  this  misjoinder  has  the  effect  of  vitiating  the  conviction  of  the"
"appellant."
"He also cited several instances where he stated as serious discrepancies in the"
"evidence of the prosecution witnesses of the raid, and the manner in which the"
"raid took  place. He was  also  of the view  that  the evidence of  Lionel (PW-05)  in"
"relation  the  other  incidents  which  involved  him  had  been  considered  in  a"
"prejudicial manner against the appellant by the learned High Court Judge in his"
"judgment. He was of the view that this has failed to guarantee a fair trial against"
"the appellant. He was  also  vivid  in arguing that  the learned High Court Judge"
"has  failed to  consider  the defence put  forward  by  the  appellant  in  its  correct"
"perspective."
"The learned Counsel for the complainant-respondent in her submissions before"
"the Court conceded that  there had been a  misjoinder of  charges in relation to"
"the 7th to 12th count preferred against the appellant. However, she relied on the"
"provisions  of  section 436  of  the Code of  Criminal Procedure Act  to  argue that"
"since no prejudice has been caused to the appellant due to the said misjoinder,"
"the  conviction  in  relation  to  1st  to  6th  counts  preferred  against  him  should"
"remain."
"It  was  her position that  the prosecution has  proved  beyond reasonable doubt,"
"the said counts against the appellant, and there was no basis to argue that PW-"
"01 and other relevant witnesses have made up a story against the appellant. She"
"pointed out that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the defence"
"version  of  events  in  his  evaluation  of  the  evidence.  It  was  moved  that  the"
"conviction  in  relation  to  the 1st  to  6th  counts  preferred against  the  appellant"
"should  be  affirmed  as  there was  no  merit  in  the grounds  of  appeal  urged  on"
"behalf of the appellant in relation to the said counts."
