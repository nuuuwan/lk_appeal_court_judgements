"unless  such error,  omission,  irregularity,  or  want has  occasioned  a"
"failure of justice."
"It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge has"
"not  used  the evidence led  through  PW-05  Lionel in  relation to  the  7th to  12th"
"counts  preferred against  the appellant in determining 1st  to  6th counts,  where"
"the appellant was found guilty. It is quite apparent that it was  the person called"
"Pathiranage Lionel (PW-05) who has supplied the White Beedi to the PW-01. It is"
"also  in  evidence  that  after  soliciting  a  bribe  of  Rs.  5000/=,  and  Rs.  1000/="
"monthly thereafter, the husband of PW-01 and the earlier mentioned Lionel has"
"been arrested  for  an  alleged offence of  possessing  Ganja,  and  they have  been"
"charged  before  the  Angunukolapalassa  Magistrate’s  Court,  although  both  of"
"them have denied in their evidence that they possessed Ganja and has taken up"
"the stand that they were falsely implicated. That  is a factor which relates to the"
"1st to 6th counts preferred against the appellant, which I do not find as a reason"
"to consider that fact  has caused prejudice towards  the appellant, as  that piece"
"of evidence cannot be considered as part of the evidence in relation to 7th to 12th"
"counts preferred against the appellant."
"I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned President’s Counsel that"
"the learned High Court  Judge has  considered the said  pieces of  evidence in a"
"prejudicial manner. Therefore, I am of the view that the said misjoinder in itself"
"would not have any vitiating effect on the conviction of the appellant in relation"
"to the 1st to 6th counts, as it has not caused any prejudice towards the appellant."
"Since the 2nd to 7th grounds of appeal urged are grounds based on the credibility"
"of  prosecution  witnesses,  I  will  now  proceed  to  consider  the  said  grounds  of"
"appeal together, along with the 8th ground of appeal where it was contended that"
"the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the defence case."
"It  is abundantly clear from the relevant prosecution witnesses that PW-01  and"
"her husband  (PW-02)  or  PW-05  for  that  matter,  had  no  reason whatsoever  to"
"falsely accuse the appellant for soliciting and accepting a bribe from PW-01."
