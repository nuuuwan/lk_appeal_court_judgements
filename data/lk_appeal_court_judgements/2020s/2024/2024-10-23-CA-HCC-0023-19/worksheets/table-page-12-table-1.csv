"L.H. de Alwis, J. (Sharvananda, C.J. and H.A.G. de Silva, J. agreeing)"
"1.  That the time at which it falls to be determined that the conditions"
"of the  offences alleged had been committed  in  the  course  of the"
"same 
transaction  had  been 
fulfilled, 
is 
the 
time  when 
the"
"accusation is made, and not  when the  trial is concluded and the"
"result is known."
"2.  That  a  misjoinder  of charges is  curable under  provisions  of the"
"Code of Criminal Procedure if there had been no actual or possible"
"failure of justice."
"3.  As  the  misjoinder 
in  the  present  case  has  not  prejudiced  the"
"appellants and  occasioned a  failure of justice 
it  amounts  to  an"
"irregularity  that 
is  curable  under  section  436  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act  No. 15 of 1979 and the  appeal, therefore,"
"fails."
