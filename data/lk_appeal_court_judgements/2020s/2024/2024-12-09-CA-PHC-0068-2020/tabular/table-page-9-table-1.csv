"the driver was convicted of."
"16. There  is  no  evidence  as  regard  to  the  manner  in  which  the  logs  were"
"loaded onto the vehicle in issue. Further there is no evidence to eliminate"
"the possibility of the logs being loaded onto the vehicle in a very short"
"period  of  time  if  it  was  done  mechanically.  The  Learned  Magistrate"
"therefore has misdirected herself on that point too."

"set  aside  the  orders  dated  22.02.2017  and  25.06.2020  of  the  Learned"
"Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judges respectively."
