"PW-01 on the day of the incident."
"In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:"
"“While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether"
"the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth."
"Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to"
"scrutinize the evidence more  particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,"
"drawbacks  and  infirmities  pointed  out  in  the  evidence  as  a  whole  and"
"evaluate  them  to  find  out  whether  it  is  against  the  general  tenor  of  the"
"evidence  given  by  the  witness  and  whether  the  earlier  evaluation  of  the"
"evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies"
"on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach"
"by  taking  sentences  torn  out  of  context  here  or  there  from  the  evidence,"
"attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating"
"officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection"
"of the evidence as a whole.”"
