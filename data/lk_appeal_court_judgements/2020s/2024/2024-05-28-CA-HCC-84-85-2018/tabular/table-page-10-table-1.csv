"Consideration of the grounds of appeal"
"Although separate grounds of appeal were urged on behalf of the appellants, I"

"writing a judgment as each judge has his or her own way of writing. What matters"

"reasonable doubt before he proceeded to analyze the defence put forward by the"
"appellants."
"As pointed out correctly by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG)"
"the analysis of the evidence by the learned trial Judge has to be considered in"
