"Hence, I set aside that part of the sentence where it has been stated that the"
"sentence of four years each imprisonment imposed on the 1st and the 2nd counts"
"shall be served concurrently to each other, and the sentence on 3rd and the 4th"
"counts shall also be concurrently each other, which means a total period of eight"
"years in relation to the 1st appellant."
"Accordingly, I replace the said part of the sentence with an order that the four"
"years  each  rigorous  imprisonment  ordered  in  relation  to  1st,  2nd,  3rd,  and  4th"
"counts shall be served concurrently to each other. This means the total period"
"of sentence of the 1st appellant should be four years."
"Similarly, I set aside the period of sentence that was ordered to be served by the"
"2nd appellant and order that the rigorous imprisonment period of four years each,"
"ordered in relation to the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th counts shall be served concurrently"
"to each other. This means the total period of sentence of the 2nd appellant should"
"be four years."
"The fines imposed on the appellants and the default  sentences, as well as the"
"amount  ordered  to  be  paid  in  terms  of  section  26  of  the  Bribery  Act,  and  the"
"default sentence shall remain the same."
"The appeal against the sentence is varied to the above extent."
"Since the appellants are on bail pending appeal, I direct that the varied sentences"
"should take effect from the date this judgment is communicated to the appellants"
"by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo."
