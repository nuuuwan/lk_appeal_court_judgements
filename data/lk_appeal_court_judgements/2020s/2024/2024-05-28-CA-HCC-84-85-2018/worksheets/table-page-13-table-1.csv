"in the transaction relevant to this incident, and he has duly put forward a claim"
"voucher for Rs.65000/- in that regard. However, the evidence of  PW-06 discloses"
"that the Director of the hospital has refused to pay the amount  due to the PW-"
"01 on a basis different to the agreed terms of the tender, and has allowed only a"
"sum of Rs. 10000/- to be paid."
"The said sum has been paid some five months after the arrest of the appellants,"
"which shows that the appellants cannot have any hand in blocking the payment"
"that was due to the PW-01."
"It clearly appears that the appellants have developed this stand based on what"
"happened  after  the  raid  in  relation  to  the  payment  due  to  the  PW-01  in  an"

"that it has to be shared among them. I find no reasons to doubt the evidence of"
"the PW-01 on account of that discrepancy in his evidence, or a reason to accept"
"that as a major contradiction in the evidence in that regard."
"I am of the view that there is nothing wrong in formulating chargers based on"
"the  solicitation  and  acceptance  of  the  bribe  against  the  1st  appellant  and"
"initiating the charges on the basis that the 2nd appellant aided and abated in the"
