"Hence it is very clear from the above that the Court has to act under section 114"
"illustration (a) only if there is no reasonable explanation by the accused who had"
"been in possession of the stolen articles."
"But  in  the  instant  matter  the  trial  judge  had  totally  rejected  the  explanation"
"without giving it a thought."
"Hence, we are unable to agree with the finding of the trial judge that the appellant"
"being  guilty  for  the  murder  and  the  robbery  and  we  find  it  that  he  has  really"
"misdirected himself in considering the provisions of the evidence ordinance."
"As such we are of the opinion that on the evidence of the prosecution as it is a"
"case based on circumstantial evidence the only irresistible inference that can be"
"drawn is definitely not that of murder or robbery."
"But in view of the evidence of witness Susila and the evidence of the jewelry shop"
"owner  we  draw  our  attention  to  section  176  and  177  of  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure Act No. 15 of 1978 (CPC) and the two illustrations pertaining to the"
"said sections which reads as,"
"Illustration of section 177 says as, “A is charged with theft but it appears"
"that he has committed criminal breach of trust of that of receiving stolen"
"property.  He  may  be  charged  with  criminal  breach  of  trust  or  receiving"
"stolen property though he was not charged with the same.”"
"At  this point I draw my attention to  the case of CA-176-2007 by  Justice"
"Lekamvasam  in  which  it  has  been  held  where  it  has  to  be  decided  after"
"being convicted and indicted for Grave sexual abuse but the appellate Court"
"decided that it should be under section 345 of the Penal code and decided"
"thus,"
"“In  a  case  of  this  nature  when  the  facts  clearly  show  that  the  accused"
"cannot be brought under 365 B(2)b, learned judges should not hesitate to"
"use  their  prudence  in  deciding  whether  a  particular  set  of  facts  does"
"constitute the offence contained in the indictment or not. If not, without"
"mechanically  passing  the  sentence  on  the  indictment  already  filled  they"
"must have the audacity to act under 177 or 178 of the CPC and convict the"
"accused accordingly for a different offence.”"
"As  such,  having  considered  the  submissions  of  both  parties  and  the  evidence"
"and  the  law  analyzed  above,  we  are  of  the  view  that  the  conviction  and  the"
"sentence entered by the trial judge is not supported by the evidence led at the"
"trial but nevertheless the appellant should be convicted under section 394 of the"
"Penal Code although he has not been charged with the same at the trial."
