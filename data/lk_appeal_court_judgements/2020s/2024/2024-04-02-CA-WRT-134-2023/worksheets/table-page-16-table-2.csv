"ection 2(1) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance deals with the constitution and composition"
"of the main board."
"Section 8 deals with the constitution and composition of the branch boards."
"Very familiar statutory phrases such as 'shall be a body corporate', 'with perpetual succession',"
"'having a common seal' and 'may sue and be sued' are not to be found in either of those two"

"is not a legal person. It is neither a natural person. Also, the total complement of the members"
"has not been made parties to the writ application. Therefore, the Respondents says that the"
"Application for writ has to be failed."
