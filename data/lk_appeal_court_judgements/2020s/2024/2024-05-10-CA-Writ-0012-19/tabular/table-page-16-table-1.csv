"","C.A. WRIT 
0012-19"
"58)","On  perusal  of  6R6  to  6R8  documents,  the  said  Mohamed  Jafer  had"
"","requested  that  the  provisional  approval  granted  to  him  be  amended  to"
"","Norwood  Hydro  (PVT)  Ltd.    This  had  been  done  in  the  year  2010.    There"
"","had been no objection or no one had challenged the said amendment and"
"","or there had not been any Police complaint or that any fraudulent activity"
"","had taken place."
"59)","Subsequently,  SLSEA  had  extended  the  provisional  approval  up  to  2013"
"","by 4R12 and 4R13 documents."
"60)","Although the Petitioner had challenged that the said extensions were done"
"","fraudulently  there  are  no  documents  or  evidence  that  the  SLSEA  had"
"","acted fraudulently with the 6th Respondent and issued the said provisional"
"","approval and or extended the said provisional approvals."
"61)","This  court  cannot  investigate  into  the  said  matters  in  a  Writ  Application."
"","Therefore,  on  the  face  of  it  the  documents  produced  by  SLSEA  has  to  be"
"","admitted before this court."
"62)","The  next  argument  raised  by 
the  Counsel 
for 
the  Petitioner 
is  after"
"","extending the provisional approval by the said 4R12 and 4R13 documents"
"","the  duty  caste  upon 
the  6th  Respondent 
is 
to  annually  extend 
the"
"","provisional approval."
"63)","However,  after  extending  up  to  2013  the  6th  Respondent  had  failed  to"
"","extend  the  provisional  approval.    Therefore,  the  notice  issued  under  P35"
"","Gazette  notification  is  not  valid  as  there  is  no  public  purpose  to  acquire"
"","the disputed land plot from the Petitioner.  To support that the  Petitioner"
"","had sighted several decisions supporting that the Writ Jurisdiction can be"
"","extended to restrain an acquisition when there is no evidence that the said"
"","acquisition is done for public purpose."
