"","published 
to  acquire 
the  Petitioner’s 
leased 
land 
for 
the  purpose  of"
"","producing energy to the grid under SLSEA Act."
"86)","I have already discussed that the Petitioner throughout the argument and"
"","submissions took up the position that the provisional approval granted for"
"","the  energy  grid  in  favour  of  the  6th  Respondent  is  illegal.    Further  the"
"","Counsel 
for 
the  Petitioner  argued  even 
in 
the  event

"","approval  was  granted  up  to  the  year  2013  it  is  not  extended  thereafter."
"","Therefore,  part  of  the  Petitioner’s  land  where  the  resources  are  situated"

the  SLSEA 
is"
"","empowered to proceed with the acquisition  of the resource area identified"

"89)","The  SLSEA  Act  is  very  clear  that  all  resource  areas  to  generate  power  to"
