"In  the  case  of  Fernandopulle  V  Minister  of  Land  and  Agriculture  1"
"Samarakoon CJ has observed as follows;"
"""Are the Courts obliged to turn a deaf ear merely"
"because some statutory officer is able to proclaim, ""I"
"alone decide"".” When I open my mouth let no dog"
"bark?"" If that be the position when the rights of the"
"subject are involved, then the Court would have"
"abdicated its powers necessary to safeguard the"
"rights of the individual. I do not think that is the test."
"No doubt primarily the Minister decided urgency. He"
"it is who is in possession of the facts and his must"
"be the reasoning. But the courts have a duty to"
"review the matter."" In the case in hand, although the"
"vesting order was made in 1990 no material has"
"been placed to justify urgency; no valid public"
"purpose has been established with cogent evidence"
"for retaining the said land in the State. In the"
"circumstances, a Writ of Certiorari is issued to quash"
"the vesting order published in the Gazette No."
"637/20 dated 22.11.1990 marked P4 in so far as it"
"relates to the petitioner's land.”"
