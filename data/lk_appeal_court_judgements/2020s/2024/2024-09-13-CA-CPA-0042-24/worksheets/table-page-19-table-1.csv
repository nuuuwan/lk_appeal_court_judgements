"Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors, but it is"
"supervisory in nature, and its object is the due administration of justice and"
"not primarily or solely the relieving of grievances of a party."
"In  exercising  powers  of  revision,  the  appellate  Court  is  not  trimmed  by"
"technical rules of pleadings and procedure. In doing so, this Court has power"
"to act whether it is set in motion by a party or not, and even ex mero motu.‚Äù"
