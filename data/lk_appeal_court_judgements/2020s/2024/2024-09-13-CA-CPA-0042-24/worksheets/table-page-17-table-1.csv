"The  documents  tendered  clearly  shows  that  the  purported  freezing  order  has"
"been issued subsequent to the seizure of the property, which should not be the"
"case."
"It is my considered view, if the facts reported to the Hon. Attorney General were"
"considered  in  its  correct  perspective,  rather  than  attempting  to  justify  illegal"
"actions of the police,  this action would have not come this far. I firmly believe"
"that it was the duty of the Hon. Attorney General to bring these matters to the"
"attention of the learned High Court Judge and also to give directions to the police"
"in order to rectify the actions taken by them, and to proceed with the relevant"
"inquiry in accordance with the law."
"Another matter that needs serious attention of the Court is the procedure that"
"appears  to  have  been  adopted  by  the  police  after  the  seizure  of  the  property"
"mentioned in the B-report filed before the Magistrate’s Court of Gampaha."
"As I have stated before, there is no provision in the Act to seize property from"
"anybody’s custody other than issuing a freezing order in terms of section 7 of the"
"Act and to proceed therefrom. If the police seize any property on the basis that"
"the said property relates or  is suspected to be used  in  the commission of any"
"offence,  the  police  should  have  acted  in  terms  of  section  431  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979."
"The relevant section 431(1) reads as follows."
