"their own hands under the provisions of the Act in the guise of a freezing order"
"and to act in the manner they have acted."
"It was also submitted that the police have misled the High Court to show that"
"the  freezing  order  that  the  police  wanted  the  Court  to  approve  was  issued  in"
"accordance with the law and has failed to inform the Court that the police took"
"custody of the two vehicles, among other things contrary to the provisions of the"
"Act."
"It was his view that anything that flows from misrepresentation of facts and the"
"law to the Court can have no legal validity."
"However,  it  was  submitted  by  the  learned  Counsel  that  if  the  police  wants  to"
"conduct an investigation in terms of the Act, they can do so, and also they can"
"keep  the  other  properties  taken  into  their  custody  for  the  purposes  of  the"
"purported  investigations.  It  was  his  position  that  despite  the  illegality  of  the"
"actions of the police, the petitioner made this application before the High Court"
"of Gampaha in terms of section 10 of the Act, as he is entitled, only in relation"
"to the two buses mentioned in the purported freezing order marked P-02."
"He also pointed out the justifications he had in relation to the application when"
"the application was made to the High Court. It was the position of the learned"
"Counsel  for  the  petitioner  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  wrong  in"
"deciding  to  appoint  a  receiver  (ප්‍රතිග්‍රාහකයෙක්)  in  this  regard,  as  appointing  a"
"receiver  would  not  arise  in  a  situation  like  this,  where  the  petitioner  is  the"
"registered owner of the two buses mentioned from  whose custody the police have"
"already taken the buses.  Under the circumstances, he prayed for the reliefs as"
"prayed for in his petition."
"Making  submissions  opposing  the  application  of  the  petitioner,  it  was  the"
"position of the learned SDSG that, out of the 7 reliefs sought by the petitioner in"
"his  petition  filed  before  this  Court,  the  1st  three  reliefs,  namely  the  issuing  of"
"notice  to  the  respondents,  and  the  two  interim  orders  sought  by  him,  have"
"already been granted by the Court."
