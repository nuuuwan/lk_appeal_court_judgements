"Laws  of  our  county. 
  We  are  now  proposing 
that, 
that  age  be"
"increased  from  12  to  16  years.      The  effect  of  that  provision  is  that"
"sexual intercourse with any girl below the age of 16 years, even if the"
"girl consents, still constitutes rape in our country. I think that is very"
"necessary.  A child of 15 years does not really have the mental"
"maturity  or  perception  to  give  consent  to  an  act  of  sexual"
"intercourse.    The  child  is  not  mindful  of  the  gravity  of  the"
"consequences  attendant  upon  the  physical  act  of  intercourse"
"and  the  criminal  law  should  provide  protection  to  that  child"
"by  declaring  that  the  act  of 
intercourse  per  se,  whether  there 
is"
"consent or not, constitutes rape."
"“It  is  only  maximum  penalty  that  is  generally  prescribed  by  penal"
"in  certain  circumstances  the 
legislation. 
  But  we 
think 
that"
"offences  are  so  severe  they  damage  the  fabric  of  society  to"

"minimum penalty.”"
"“We have also thought it proper in introduce an enhanced penalty in"
"circumstances  where  a  girl  below  the  age  of  18  years  is  raped,  or"
"where  a  pregnant  woman 
is  raped,  or  where  a  woman  mentally"
"disturbed  is raped.   In  those circumstances not only is  there liability"
"for  rape,  but,  we  think,  it  is  also  just  and  equitable  that  a  more"
"onerous  and  enhanced  punishment  be 
imposed. 
 
In 
the  case  of"
"statutory  rape,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  there  is  minimum  penalty  of  7"
"years  rigorous  imprisonment,  but  in  circumstances  where  the  girl"
"raped 
in  below  18  years,  or 
is  mentally  disturbed,  or 
is"
"pregnant, we are proposing that there should be a mandatory"
"minimum sentence of imprisonment of 10 years.  That again is"
"necessary  to  protect  the  vulnerable  interests  of  women  in  our"
"community.”"
"“That  is  restriction  of  judicial  discretion  with  regard  to  sentencing."
