"appropriate punishment‚Äù. [Empasis added]"
"The  Learned  State  Counsel  in  his  sentencing  submission  highlighting"
"the  prescribed  punishment  for  Gang  Rape  under  Section  364(2)  of  the"
"Penal Code as amended, very correctly pleaded the Court to impose an"
"appropriate  and  legal  sentence  on  the  Respondents.  But  Learned  High"
"Court  Judge  disregarding  both  the  submission  of  the  State  and  the"
"applicable law, imposed an inappropriate and illegal sentence on the 1st"
"Respondent which paved the way for him to go free after exploiting poor"
"and  helpless  victim.  This  could  not  be  the  intention  of  the  legislature"
"which considered Gang Rape to be such heinous crime to attract with a"
"mandatory sentence."
"Considering heinous nature of the crime, the Learned High Court Judge"
"should have imposed  stern  sentence which  not only reflect the ghastly"
"and inhuman act of the 1st Respondent, but also serves as an example"
"for the others who might also venture on the same atrocity in future."
"In  view  of  the  above  consideration  and  discussion,  I  conclude  that  an"
"appropriate and legal sentence is warranted against the 1st Respondent"
"in this case."
"Hence, 
the  15  years  suspended  sentence 
is  modified 
to  10  years"
"rigorous 
imprisonment.  The 
fine  of  Rs.30,000/-  with 
the  default"
"sentence  of  six  months 
rigorous 
imprisonment  will 
remain  same."
"Further, the compensation Rs.100,000/- also will remain same subject"
"to a default sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment."
"Therefore, the revision application allowed subject to above modification"
"of the sentence."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  Judgment  to  the"
"High Court of Ampara."
