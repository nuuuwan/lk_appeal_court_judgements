"The Respondents claim that the Petitioners have installed two gates along the"
"southern boundary wall of the Petitioner's premises bordering the state land"
"which has been vested with the CMC, illegally and that the said construction"
"is unauthorized. In the above context, the first question that arises is whether"
"the said State Land is vested with the CMC."
"The Respondents claim that Cambel Park contains 18 Acres, and 2 Roods in"
"the extent and that the same is described in the Plan marked R2. The same"
"has been acquired by the State and had been vested over to the CMC by the"
"Vesting  Certificate  marked  R1  as  far  back  in  1902  under  Section  72  of  the"
"Municipality Ordinance No. 07 of 1887. The Respondents further state that"
"the premises in question is situated within the limits of the said Cambel Park"
"depicted 
in  R2.  The  approved  Condominium  Plan  R8(a)/P15(g) 
for  the"
"Petitioners’ premises no 15 & 15 1/1 described its southern boundary as State"
"Land  and  Plan  No.21  dated  06.11.1956  prepared  by  C.  C.  Cumarasamy"
"Licensed Surveyor marked R9 & P15(h) also describes the southern boundary"
"of the above premises no.15 as Crown Land. However, such mere reference"
"to a particular land as “State /Crown Land” in the Plan does not substantiate"
"the position of the Respondent that such land was vested with CMC."
"Despite  the  Respondents'  assertion  that  the  land  bordering  the  southern"
"boundary of the Petitioners' property is vested with the CMC by the Vesting"
"Certificate  R1,  this  Court  is  unable  to  arrive  at  such  a  conclusion  with  the"
"available materials placed before it. The strip of land which is described as"
"State/Crown  Land 
in  plans  R8(a)/P15(g)  and  R9  &  P15(h)  bordering  the"
"southern boundary of the Petitioners’ premises cannot be asserted as a land"
"vested with the CMC in the absence of the adequate evidence to prove the"
"same. The parties are also at variance on this matter. Whether the above strip"
"of State Land bordering the southern boundary of the Petitioners’ premises is"
"a  part  of  the  Cambel  Park  vested  with  the  CMC  or  not  could  only  be"
"determined by superimposing the relevant plans and by a closer assessment"
"of fact before an appropriate forum which is vested with the jurisdiction to do"
"so. CHOUDRI in his book on the Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights (2nd"
"Edition) Vol.2(at p.381) observed “where the facts are in dispute and in order"
"to get at the truth it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a"
"suit  where  parties  would  have  ample  opportunity  of  examining 
their"
"witnesses…”. In the above circumstances, this Court is unable to determine"
