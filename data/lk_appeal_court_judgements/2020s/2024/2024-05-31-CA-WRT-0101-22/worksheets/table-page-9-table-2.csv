"Corporation","(writ)  no.  298/2018,  decided  on  30.06.2020,  his  Lordship  Justice"
"Obeyesekere  has  observed  that  the  legislature  could  not  have  intended  for  the",""
"Competent Authority’s opinion to be baseless.",""
"","“it is the view of this court that the legislature could not have intended for"
"","the competent authority’s opinion, which can have far-reaching consequences"
"","on one’s proprietary rights, to be baseless. The Competent Authority's opinion"
"","must therefore be formed on a rational basis. What constitutes a rational basis"
"","would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case”"
"","Therefore, when considering the legality and /or the reasonableness of the"
"","opinion of the Competent Authority in the course of an application filed under"
"","Article 140 of the Constitution, this Court will require the Competent Authority"
"","to  present  the  material  on  which  he  formed  the  opinion  that  the  State  is"
"","lawfully entitled to the said land so that this Court can consider whether the"
"","Competent  Authority  has  acted  legally  and/or  reasonably.  This  Court  must"
"","state that in doing so, it is not the function of this Court to consider the title of"
"","the State, or for that matter, the title of the person sought to be ejected, to the"
"","said land. That is the function of the District Court under Section 12 of the Act"
"","or in an Actio Res Vindicatio. This Court wishes to state however that merely"
"","because a person who is to be ejected or against whom an order for ejectment"
"","has  been  made,  has  a  remedy  by  way  of  Section  12,  does  not  absolve  the"
"","Competent Authority from his obligation to act reasonably and legally when"
"","forming the all important opinion in terms of Section 3."
"","The principle then is that while no investigation or inquiry is needed to form"
"","the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land, such opinion must"
"","satisfy the Wednesbury test of reasonableness. What then is the ‘reasonable"
"","basis’ on which the 2nd Respondent formed the opinion that the 1st Respondent"
"","is lawfully entitled to the land referred to in the notice marked ‘P8’? ”"
