"Opinion of the Competent Authority"
"However, it's significant to note that Sections 3(1A) and Section 12 do not exempt"
"the competent authority from their obligation to act reasonably and within the four"
"corners  of  the 
law  when  forming  an  opinion  under  Section  3  of  the  act.  The"
"Competent Authority's opinion must be formed on a rational basis depending on the"
"facts and circumstances of each case. In the case of Weeresinghe v. Ceylon Petroleum"
"Corporation 
(writ)  no.  298/2018,  decided  on  30.06.2020,  his  Lordship  Justice"
"Obeyesekere  has  observed  that  the  legislature  could  not  have  intended  for  the"
"Competent Authorityâ€™s opinion to be baseless."
