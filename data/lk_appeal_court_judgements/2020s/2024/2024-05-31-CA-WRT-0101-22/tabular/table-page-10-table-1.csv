"(Gampaha) identify the impugned lots referred to in the quit notices marked X-1a, X-"

"21 of the Survey Act No.17 of 2002, a cadastral map or plan prepared by the Surveyor"

"21. Any cadastral map, plan or any other plan or map prepared in accordance"
"with the provisions of this act or any written law purported to be signed by the"
"surveyor general or officer acting on his behalf and offered in evidence in any"
"suit shall be received in evidence and shall be taken to be prima facie proof of"
"the facts stated therein and shall not be necessary to prove that it was in fact"
"signed by the surveyor General or an officer acting on his behalf, nor that it"
"was made by his authority, nor that the same is accurate until the evidence to"
"the contrary shall have first been given."
"The Advance Tracing Plan X2, Plan 1R2 and Plan 1R3 which have been prepared by"
"the Surveyor General. The above documents establish that the lands depicted in the"
"quit  notices  are  part  of  the  reclaimed  Negombo  Lagoon.  The  1st  Respondent"

"State lands based on the above circumstances and the definition of a ‘lake’, ‘public"
"lake’, and ‘private lake’ given in Section 70 and the provisions in Section 76 of the"
"State  Lands  Ordinance.  I  have  no  reason  to  reject  the  said  contention  of  the  1st"
"Respondent who has adequately identified that the lands depicted in the quit notices"
"as State lands."
"In the given circumstances, this court is of the view that the opinion formed by the"
"Competent Authority, 1st Respondent that the lands subjected to these quit notices"
"belonged  to  the  State  and  such  decisions  have  been  made  on  a  rational  basis."
