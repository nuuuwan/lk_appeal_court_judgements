l."
"When the matter came up on 21.05.2024, the Counsel for the Respondents has taken the"
"preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of this action. Accordingly, all"
"parties have filed written submissions. The Counsel for the 7th Respondent has informed"
"the following facts to the Courts in their written submission:"
"The  Petitioner  has  filed  this  application  challenging  the  elections  of  the  National"
"Gymnastic Association which has already been held on 29.05.2023. After the said election,"
"the 7th Respondent has won the election along with some other members who are not made"
"a party to this action. Further, he brought to notice that, the Gazettes that are purportedly"
"challenged by the Petitioner namely, 2310/26, 2310/27 and 2310/28 all dated 14.12.2022"
"have  now  been  replaced  by  a  subsequent  Gazette  bearing  No.  2382/32 
issued  on"
"03.05.2024 which was marked as A."
"The  said  Gazette  in  Part  (V)  has  mentioned  that  these  Gazettes  have  been  rescinded."
"However,  the  Petitioner  moved  to  quash the said  Gazettes which  are  not  in force  now."
"Thus, the reliefs sought by the Petitioner to quash the said Gazettes are rendered futile."
"Although the Petitioner admitted that the said Gazettes are not in force, the Petitioner"
"seeks to quash any action taken under and in terms of the said Gazettes."
