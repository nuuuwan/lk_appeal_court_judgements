"It is clear that PW-01 has not gone to work on the following day, but has reported"
"to work as usual on 18-01-2011. She has continued to work thereafter, and she"
"might have thought that her troubles were over, as she previously expressed her"
"displeasure for the behavior of the accused towards her."
"However, when she went for work on the 29th, she has been asked to come to"
"work on the 30th as well which was again a holiday. She has gone to the office as"
"directed, and has got herself dropped off by her husband, which clearly shows"
"that there had been no issues between herself and her husband."
"The  work  assigned  to  her  on  that  day  had  been  to  arrange some  files.  As  she"
"could not finish the work on that day, she has been allowed to go and when she"
"was about to leave, the 3rd incident as I have stated before has occurred."
"The sequence of events and the behaviour of PW-01 demonstrates that although"
"she hated the advances made towards her by the accused, she had no way of"
"escaping from it either given her situation."
"Another question may arise as to why she got into the vehicle of the accused and"
"went with him up to the main gate on the 3rd occasion."
"The evidence clearly shows that there is a distance to travel from the office of the"
"company premises up to the main gate where transportation facilities had been"
"provided  for  the  employees.  The  PW-01  has  explained  that  it  was  dark  and"
"raining at that time, and that she was fearful of going alone towards the main"
"gate. The accused has offered her a lift under those  circumstances, which the"
"PW-01 has been forced to accept despite her ordeal. However, her evidence shows"
"that  she  has  gotten  down  near  the  main  gate  and  had  gotten  into  the  official"
"transport that was  available. This clearly shows  that the  explanation given by"
"the PW-01 was acceptable. Soon after getting into the office transport bus, she"
"has given a call to her husband and informed him that she will not be going to"
"work hereinafter. If she was a willing participant, she could have kept quiet on"
"this day as well, which was not the case."
