"meet the General Manager. It appears that the General Manager of Prima Ceylon"
"Limited  being  a  multinational  company  has  taken  a  very  serious  view  of  this"
"matter and had instructed the PW-01 to lodge a complaint with the police. PW-"
"01 as well as her husband has explained further the reasons for them to wait"
"until 07-02-2011 to make a complaint to Chinabay police."
"It clearly appears that the husband of PW-01 although he was a management"
"level officer of Ceylinco Insurance at the time he gave evidence several years after"
"the incident, he would have been a Junior Executive of the said company during"
"the time relevant to these incidents. He has explained that he had to attend a"
"compulsory workshop conducted in Colombo during the intervening period and"

"Judge has cited a case dated 25-03-2008 pronounced by the Court of Appeal in"
"CA-118-2002."
"Other  than  giving  the  reference,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  cited"
"anything from the judgment."
"Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge has gone on to consider a person called"
"Aranolis, who did not initially come forward as a witness, which appears to be in"
"a case of murder. He has even referred to page 304 of the brief to justify that the"
"said  Aranolis  did  not  come  forward  to  make  a  statement  initially  and  came"
"forward 5 days after the incident. Accordingly, he has determined that Aranolisâ€™s"
"evidence cannot be considered due to the delay."
"It may be that the learned High Court Judge have mixed up the facts of another"
"case when he considered the evidence of one Aranolis in a murder case, which"
"has nothing to do with the impugned case. There is also nothing to indicate that"
"by speaking about one Aranolis and a murder case, he was referring to the earlier"
