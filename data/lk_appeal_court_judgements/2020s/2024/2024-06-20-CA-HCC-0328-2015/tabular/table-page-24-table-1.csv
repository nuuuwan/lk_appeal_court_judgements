"case cited by him, as no connection has been provided to the cited case in the"
"judgment."
"For the reasons as considered above, I find that this is a judgment that cannot"
"be allowed to stand under any circumstances."
"Accordingly, I hereby set aside the judgment dated 16-09-2015 by the learned"
"High Court Judge of Trincomalee as it cannot be allowed to stand."
"It  is  with  regret  I  have  to  note  that  I  am  not  in  a  position  to  understand  the"
"rationale behind the submissions of the learned DSG who represented the Hon."
"Attorney General during the hearing of this appeal."
"After admitting that the learned High Court Judge was totally misdirected as to"
"the relevant points of law and the way the judgment has been written, the learned"
"DSG thought it fit to argue that the judgment should be allowed to stand and"
"the acquittal of the accused was justified."
"As  I  have  considered  previously,  there  is  no  material  whatsoever  to  justify  a"
"judgment  pronounced  after  failing  to  consider  the  evidence  placed  before  the"
"Court in its correct perspective and being totally misdirected as to the relevant"
"law."
"However, to the credit of the learned President’s Counsel who represented the"
"accused  at  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  obviously  after  realizing  the  serious"
"weaknesses  of  the  judgment,  he  never  defended  the  judgment.  Fulfilling  his"
"obligations  towards  his  client  and  towards  the  Court,  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel submitted the reasons as he thought that should be held in favour of"
"the accused and the weaknesses of the prosecution case as he termed, which"
"should have been considered in a properly written judgment. He submitted that"
"when considering the evidence led during the trial, any judgment should be in"
"favour of the accused as the prosecution has failed to prove the charges against"
"his client, when the totality of the evidence was considered."
