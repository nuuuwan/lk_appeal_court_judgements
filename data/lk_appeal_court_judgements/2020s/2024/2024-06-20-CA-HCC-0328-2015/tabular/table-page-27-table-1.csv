"The  allegation  against  the  accused  was  that  he  committed  three  incidents  of"
"sexual  harassment  on  PW-01  as  stated  in  the  indictment.  According  to  the"
"evidence of PW-01, she has been summoned to work by the accused on all three"
"occasions  which  were  holidays,  and  that  was  also  in  the  afternoons  of  all  the"
"three days. The evidence given by the security personnel who manned the main"
"gate of the company premises establishes the fact that PW-01 came to work as"

"In fact, the accused had admitted that she came to his office as stated by her."

"towards  her  raises  the  question  as  to  why  she  went  to  his  office  despite  her"
"worries."
"To  understand  that,  one  will  have  to  look  at  this  entire  scenario  from  the"
"perspective of the PW-01. She was a young woman who hails from the same area"
"and had managed to gain employment in a multinational company like  Prima"
"Ceylon Limited. This may have been a dream come true for her because of the"
