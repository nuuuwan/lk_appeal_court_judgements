"After having obtained the relevant leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal, the"
"aggrieved party has preferred this appeal."
"At the hearing of this appeal, the learned President’s Counsel who represented"
"the aggrieved party (the victim mentioned in the indictment and who has given"
"evidence  as  PW-01  at  the  trial)  expressed  the  view  that  this  was  a  judgment"
"pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Trincomalee by being completely"
"misdirected as to the relevant law and the relevant facts of the matter."
"He  was  of  the  view  that  the  judgment  entered  cannot  be  termed  as  a  proper"
"judgment pronounced in terms of section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act."
"It  was  pointed  out  that  the  indictment  relates  to  three  separate  instances  of"
"sexual harassment of PW-01 by the accused. Bringing to the notice of the Court,"
"the evidence placed before the trial Court by the prosecution in this regard, the"
"learned President’s Counsel pointed out that the main reason for the acquittal"
"had been the alleged delay by the aggrieved party to lodge a  complaint in this"
"regard to the police. It was also pointed out that the learned High Court Judge’s"
"decision  has  been  influenced  on  the  basis  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to"
"establish any sexual gratification, which was a complete misdirection as to the"
"relevant ingredients that need to be proved in a case of sexual harassment."
"The learned President’s Counsel was of the view that the acquittal of the accused"
"should be set aside by this Court as it cannot be allowed to stand. The learned"
"President’s  Counsel  also  urged  the  indulgence  of  this  Court  to  consider  the"
"evidence  placed  before  the  trial  Court  and  enter  a  proper  judgment,  so  that"
"justice would be served to the aggrieved party as well as the accused."
"The submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented"
"the  Hon.  Attorney  General,  the  named  complainant-respondent  of  this  matter"
"was  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  proof  of  sexual"
"gratification  as  a  necessary  ingredient  in  this  matter  whereas,  the  indictment"
