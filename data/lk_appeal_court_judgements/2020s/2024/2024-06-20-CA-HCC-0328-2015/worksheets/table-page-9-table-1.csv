"her first experience of being  summoned her in such a manner. On that directive,"
"she has gone to work at around 2.30 - 3.00 p.m. by the vehicle sent from the"
"office. She has punched her attendance at the security office as usual and when"
"she went to the office, she has been informed to prepare a report as to the no"
"pay leave obtained by the workers. It had been only the accused and herself at"
"the office."
"While engaging in this work, the guardroom of the factory has informed her that"
"a call was received from her home. When she took a call to her home, she has"
"come to know that it was her husband and brother who called, and she has been"
"informed to come home. It was around 8:30 in the night at that time."
"When  she  was  preparing  to  leave  with  the  permission  of  the  accused,  he  has"
"come near her, shook her hands, and had thanked her for helping by placing his"
"cheek on the cheek of PW-01."
"It  has  been  her  evidence  that  when  this  happened,  she  was  shaken  by  the"
"incident and she left the place in the vehicle provided by the office. However, she"
"has not divulged this incident to anyone else. When she reached home, she has"
"come to know that her brother has got agitated with her husband for allowing"
"her to go to work during holidays and there had been an issue in the house of"
"her husband. Because of this situation, she has left her husband’s house and"
"gone to her mother’s house."
"The following day  had also been  a holiday.  Around 2.30 in  the afternoon, she"
"has received a call from the accused asking her to come to work on that day too."
"She has informed that she is not in a position to come, because of the issue she"
"had to face at her husband’s house. However, the accused had insisted her to"
"come informing that there is an urgent matter that needs to be attended to."
"Agreeing to his request, when she went to the office, yet again, the accused had"
"been alone in the office. When she informed him that she came, the accused had"
"told her that he wanted her to come, not for any work, but because he wanted"
"to know what was the issue she was facing. Although she resisted his request,"
