"Per Dr. Anand, CJI.,",""
"“In  a  case","involving  charge  of  sexual  harassment  or  attempt  to"
"","sexually  molest,  the  courts  are  required  to  examine  the  broader"
"probabilities","of  a 
case  and  not  get 
swayed  by 
insignificant"
"","discrepancies or narrow technicalities or dictionary meanings of the"
"","expression  molestation.  They  must  examine  the  entire  material  to"
"","determine  the  genuineness  of  the  complaint.  The  statement  of  the"
"","victim  must  be  appreciated  in  the  background  of  the  entire  case."
"","Where the evidence of the victim inspires confidence, as in the position"
"","in the instant case, the Courts are obliged to rely on it. Such cases are"
"","required to be dealt with great sensitivity. Sympathy in such cases in"
"","favour of the superior officer is wholly misplaced and merely has no"
"","relevance. The High Court overlooked the ground realities and ignored"
"","the fact that the conduct of the respondent against his female junior"
"","employee, Miss. X was wholly against moral sanctions, decency and"
"was offensive to her modesty.”",""
