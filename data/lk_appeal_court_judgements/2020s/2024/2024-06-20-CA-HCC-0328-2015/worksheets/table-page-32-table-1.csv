"embarrassment and unpleasantness towards her. It is my considered view that"
"there cannot be any better example of workplace sexual harassment than in the"
"instant matter."
"Hence, I am of the view that the defence taken up by the accused has not caused"
"any doubt on the prosecution evidence."
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel submitted that the fact of the Human Resource"
"Manager of Prima Ceylon Limited obtaining copies of proceedings as a reason to"
"assume  that  the  company  had  been  after  the  accused.  However,  I  am  in  no"
"position  to  agree.  In  my  view,  the  company  was  entitled  to  know  what  was"
"happening in relation to an incident  that occurred in their company, which has"
"led to a criminal prosecution."
"I do not find that  as a  reason to  hold  in  favour  of the accused in the manner"
"contended on his behalf."
"I am unable to agree that the police recording a 2nd statement from PW-01 as a"
"reason to believe that the police have gone out of the way in order to file charges."
"The evidence of the police officers who conducted investigations clearly show that"
"after  recording  the  statement  of  the  accused,  they  wanted  to  clarify  certain"
"matters.  This  shows  that  the  police  have  been  careful  in  their  investigations"
"against the accused. This clearly shows that a comprehensive investigation has"
"been conducted and only after that, the charges have been preferred against the"
"accused  by  the  Hon.  Attorney  General.  There  is  nothing  to  conclude  that  the"
"charges against the accused had been a result of the fabrication of evidence or a"
"result of partial investigations done by the police."
"One  has  to  be  mindful  that  in  these  types  of  cases,  a  trivial  contradiction  or"
"omission  cannot  be  considered  relevant,  unless  the  said  contradictions  or"
"omissions  go  into  the  core  of  the  matter,  which  has  the  effect  of  shaking  the"
"evidence given by the prosecution witnesses."
