"Citing several judgments pronounced by our Superior Courts, it was the position"
"of the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel on behalf of the accused that the evidence led"
"in  the  trial  was  grossly  inadequate  to  prove  the  charges  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt. He urged the Court to dismiss the appeal, arguing that though there may"
"be irregularities in the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the only final"
"conclusion that could be reached was an acquittal of the accused and nothing"
"else."
"Before considering the submissions made on behalf of the aggrieved party as well"
"as the accused and that of the learned DSG, I will now proceed to consider the"
"facts as revealed in evidence before the trial Court."
