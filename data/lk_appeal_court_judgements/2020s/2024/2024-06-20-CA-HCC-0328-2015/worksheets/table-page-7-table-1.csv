"the  facts  of  the  matter  under  the  above  circumstances,  stating  that  it  further"
"strengthens his claim that this was a fabrication against his client."
"He  questioned  the  reasons  as  to  why  the  prosecutrix  failed  to  complain  to"
"anybody about the sexual harassment she faced on the first occasion and even"
"on  the  second  occasion,  and  decided  to  complain  only  after  the  alleged  3rd"
"incident. He also pointed out that  what was the reason for her to get into the"
"accused’s car even after she faced the alleged last incident. He was of the view,"
"that  itself  created  a  doubt  as  to  the  genuineness  of  the  complaint  of  sexual"
"harassment made against the accused."
"The learned President’s Counsel submitted that the evidence does not suggest"
"that she was sexually harassed in the alleged 1st two incidents and even in the"
"alleged 2rd incident. It was submitted that it cannot be believed that any sexual"
"harassment occurred when one look at the behaviour of the prosecutrix after the"
"incident. It was contended that if she was sexually harassed, she would not have"
"gotten into the car of the accused and get down near the main gate of the factory,"
"and go home in a staff bus where she has not informed anyone whom she met"
"of the alleged harassment she faced."
"The learned President’s Counsel was of the view that her complaint had been a"
"delayed  complaint  where  she  has  given  various  reasons  to  justify  the  delay,"
"which in his view had no justification."
"He  also  pointed  out  the  evidence  where  the  security  guard  of  the  factory  has"
"testified that when the prosecutrix came near the security point in the accused’s"
"car and got down, she failed to mention anything to the security guards, which"
"should be considered in favour of the accused at the trial. Another point taken"
"was that there were several contradictions as to her evidence, which should also"
"be considered in favour of the accused."
