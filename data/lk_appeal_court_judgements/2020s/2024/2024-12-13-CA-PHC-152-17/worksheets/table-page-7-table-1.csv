"“In view of the aforecited Judgment, we are not supposed to consider this as an appeal"
"preferred  against  the  Order  of  the  Magistrate's  Court.  We  are  of  the  view  that  the"
"task  before  this  Court  is  to  ascertain  whether this  appeal  emanates  from  an Order"
"pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction."
"Thus, the Court of Appeal is empowered to evaluate the correctness of the exercise of"
"revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court. Similarly, the Provincial High"
"Courts  too  should  be  mindful  when  exercising  revisionary  jurisdiction  in respect  of"
"applications made against the Orders of the Magistrate's Court and should consider"
"these as revision applications and not as appeals.”"
