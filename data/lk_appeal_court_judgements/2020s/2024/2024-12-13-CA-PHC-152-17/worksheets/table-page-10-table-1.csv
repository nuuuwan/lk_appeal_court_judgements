"In  Farook  V.  Gunewardene,  Government  Agent,  Amparai  (1980)  2  SLR  243  at  245,  His"
"Lordship Abdul Cader J held that:"
"“At  the  inquiry  before  the  Magistrate,  the  only  plea  by  way  of  defence  that  the"
"petitioner can put forward is “that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon"
"a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance with any"
"written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise"
"rendered invalid.” Section 9 (2) is to the effect that the Magistrate cannot call for any"
"evidence from the competent authority in support of the application under section 5,"
"which means that the Magistrate cannot call upon the competent authority to prove"
"that the land described in the schedule to the application is a State land (Section 5 (1)"
"(a) (ii). Therefore, the Petitioner will not have an opportunity of raising the question"
"whether the land is a State or private land before the Magistrate.”"
