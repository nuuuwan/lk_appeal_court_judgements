"“The Provincial High Courts need to be mindful of this fact when they are called upon"
"to  exercise  revisionary jurisdiction in  respect  of  Primary  Court  orders  of  this  kind."
"Such applications must be treated as only revision applications and not appeals. The"
"Judges of the Provincial High Courts need to bear in mind that they would only defeat"
"the  purpose  of  section  74  (2)  of  the  Primary  Courts  Procedure  Act  which  has"
"specifically been enacted by the legislature to take the right of appeal away from the"
"Parties, if they indirectly assume appellate jurisdiction over this type of applications."
"Although  there  is  a  right  of  appeal  provided  to  this  Court  from  an  order  of  the"
"Provincial  High  Court,  this  Court  should  not  forget  that  it  is  within  the  above"
"parameters  that  the  Provincial  High  Court  has  pronounced  the  impugned  order."
"Therefore the right of appeal provided by law to this Court would only empower this"
"Court to evaluate the correctness of the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction by the"
"Provincial High Court. It cannot be converted to an appeal against a Primary Court"
"Order."
"In these circumstances, in the process of the adjudication of the instant appeal this"
"Court would need to act within the above parameters. This Court would remind itself"
"that it is not open for it to treat this case as a true appeal from an order made by the"
"Primary  Court.  This  is the  view  expressed  by this  Court  in the case  cited above  as"
"well.”"
