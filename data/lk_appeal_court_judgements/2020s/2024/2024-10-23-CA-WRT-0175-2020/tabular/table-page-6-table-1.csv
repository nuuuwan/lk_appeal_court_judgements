"having  regard  to  his  conduct,  delay,  laches,  waiver,  and  submission  to"
"jurisdiction - which are all valid impediments that stand against the grant of"
"relief.  (Vide:  Jayaweera  v.  Assistant  Commissioner  of  Agrarian  Services"
"Ratnapura and Another [1996] 2 SLR 70)."
"In Bisomenike Vs. C. R. de Alwis (1982-1SLR-368), Sharvananda, J., (as"
"he then was) observed that;"
"""A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be"
"held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. The exercise"
"of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well-accepted principles."
"The Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the"
"order  of  an  inferior  tribunal  except  in  cases  where  he  has  disentitled"
"himself 
to 
the  discretionary 
relief  by 
reason  of  his  own  conduct,"
"submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver. The proposition"
"that  the  Application  for  Writ  must  be  sought  as  soon  as  the  injury  is"
"caused  is  merely  an  Application  of  the  equitable  doctrine  that  delay"
"defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over  his rights"
"without  any  reasonable  excuse 
the  chance  of  his  success 
in  Writ"
"Application dwindles and the Court may reject a Writ Application on the"
"ground  of  unexplained  delay.  An  Application  for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari"
"should be filled within a reasonable time""."
"In Sarath Hulangamuwa Sriwardena Vs. The Principal Vishaka Vidyalaya"
"(1986-1 SLR-275), the Court of Appeal held that;"
"“The  Writs  are  extraordinary  remedies  granted  to  obtain  speedy  relief"
"under  exceptional  circumstances  and  time 
is  of  the  essence  of  the"
"Application….  The 
laches  of 
the  Petitioner  must  necessarily  be  a"
"determining factor in deciding the Application for Writ as the Court will"
"not lend itself to making a stultifying order that cannot be carried out."
"In the instant Application, the Petitioners are seeking to quash the impugned"
"Gazette marked as P11 that was issued on 29-08-2014, six years before the"
"institution  of  this  Application.  The  inordinate  delay  is  not  explained  in  the"
"amended  Petition  to  the  satisfaction  of  this  Court.  As  such,  in  light  of  the"
"above  authorities,  the  instant  application  is  liable  to  be  dismissed  on  this"
"ground as well."
