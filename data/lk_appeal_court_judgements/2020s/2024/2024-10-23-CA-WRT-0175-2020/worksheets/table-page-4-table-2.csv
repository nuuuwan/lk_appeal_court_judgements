"in Writ courts."
"In this regard, I refer to the judgment of Thajudeen Vs. Sri-Lanka Tea Board"
"(1981-2SLR-471) where the Court of Appeal held that;"
"“Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts is"
"subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be"
"canvassed  in  a  suit  where  parties  would  have  ample  opportunity  of"
"examining the witnesses so that the Court would be better able to judge"
"which version is correct, a Writ will not issue. Mandamus is pre-eminently"
"a discretionary remedy. It is an extraordinary, residuary and suppletory"
"remedy to be granted only when there are no other means of obtaining"
"justice. Even though all other requirements for securing the remedy have"
"been  satisfied  by  the  applicant,  the  Court  will  decline  to  exercise  its"
"discretion  in  his  favour  if  a  specific  alternative  remedy  like  a  regular"
"action equally convenient, beneficial, and effective is available.”"
