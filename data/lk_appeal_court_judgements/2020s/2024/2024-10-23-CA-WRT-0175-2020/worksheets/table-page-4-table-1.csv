"partition  action.  Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  judgment  the  Petitioners  have"
"preferred an appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court of the Southern Province"
"(Galle) which is pending. The Petitioners averred that during the pendency of"
"the said partition action, the aforesaid Gazzete,  marked P11 was issued by"
"the 3rd Respondent, declaring that the land in dispute  is a Sacred Land. In"
"this scenario, the Petitioners averred that they are the sole owners of the land"

"in Writ courts."
"In this regard, I refer to the judgment of Thajudeen Vs. Sri-Lanka Tea Board"
