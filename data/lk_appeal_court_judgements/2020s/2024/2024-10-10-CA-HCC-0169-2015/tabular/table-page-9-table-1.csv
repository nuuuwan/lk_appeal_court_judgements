"this view on the perusal of the submissions made on sentencing at the"
"original Court as well as the submissions made in this Court. There is"
"no  rational  reason  that  justifies  a  sentence  below  the  minimum  two"
"years prescribed for the first and second counts."
"H
owever,  on  a  consideration  of  a  totality  of  circumstances,  I  observe"
"that the offence was committed in 2006, almost 18 years ago and that"
"all the sentences of the 1st Accused were ordered to run concurrently."
"Hence,  justice  demands  that  the  Appellant  also  be  given  the  same"
"benefit. Accordingly, the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 4"
"are hereby ordered to run concurrently and the aggregate sentence will"
"thus be rigorous imprisonment for two years."
"S
ubject to this variation, the conviction and the sentence are affirmed"
"and the Appeal is partially allowed to that extent."
"A
         
ppeal is partially allowed."
