following 
this 
principle 
held 
as 
follows;"
"……………………………."
"I
t is clear that the principle so determined by the said decisions is not"
"‘offence  specific’.  but  of  general  application.  Thus,  it  will  apply  to  all"
"offences  prescribe  a  minimum  mandatory  sentence 
including 
the"
"Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act."
"B
e  that  as  it  may,  in  view  of  Article  13(6)  of  the  Constitution,  the"
"legislature is empowered to prescribe a minimum mandatory sentence."
"Therefore, many a statute and certain offences under the Penal Code"
"provide for such minimum mandatory sentences. However, as the law"
"stands interpreted the sentencing Judges are not inhibited or prevented"
"from  exercising  a  discretion  to  determine  an  appropriate  sentence."
"However,  prescribing  the  range  of  the  sentence  is  a  matter  of  policy"
"which 
is  the  purview  of  the 
legislature.  Thus,  when  a  minimum"
"mandatory sentence is prescribed, sentencing Judge cannot just ignore"
"such  prescribed  minimum  mandatory 
sentence.  No  doubt, 
the"
"sentencing Judge has a discretion to decide on the appropriate sentence"
"even below the said prescribed minimum as held in SC No. 03/2008."
"However, it is necessary to have and advert to some reason to impose a"
"sentence  below 
the  minimum  mandatory.  Therefore,  as  held 
in"
"Hirimuthugoda……………….    By  Justice  Anil  Gunaratne,  it  would  be"
"incumbent upon a Judge to set out with clarity, all the reasons which"
"are  relevant  and  salient  for  not  imposing  the  mandatory  statutory"
"minimum sentence as prescribed by the relevant Penal Provision."
