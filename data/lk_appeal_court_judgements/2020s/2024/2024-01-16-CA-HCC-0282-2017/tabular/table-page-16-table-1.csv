"used as a process of inducing belief in such evidence where such evidence"
"is not credible.”"
"At  this  stage,  I  find  it  appropriate  to  refer  to  the  Indian  case  of  Bhoginbhai"
"Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758)  very often"
"cited in our Courts. It was held:"
"1)  By  and  large  a  witness  cannot  be  expected  to  possess  a  photographic"
"memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape"
"is replayed on the mental screen."
"2)  Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness"
"could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element"
"of  surprise.  The  mental  faculties  therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  be"
"attuned to absorb the details."
"3)  Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence"
"of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A"
"witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when interrogated later on."
"4)  A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the Court"
"atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and out"
"of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events,"
"or  fill  up  details  from  imagination  on  the  spur  of  the  moment.  The  sub-"
"conscious  mind  of  the  witness  sometime  so  operates  on  account  of  the"
"fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is giving"
"truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him – perhaps"
"it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of"
"the moment."
"As  I  considered  above,  the  evidence  of  the  prosecutrix  is  highly  credible  and"
"trustworthy. I find no reason  not to believe the version of events as narrated by"
"the prosecutrix in this case."
