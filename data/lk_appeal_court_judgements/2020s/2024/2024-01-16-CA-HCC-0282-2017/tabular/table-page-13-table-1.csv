"this view by way of explanation (II) of section 363 of the Penal Code Act No."
"22 of 1995.”"
"The relevant explanation II of section 363 of the Penal Code reads as follows."
"II. Evidence of resistance such as physical injuries to the body is not"
"essential to prove that sexual intercourse took place without consent."
"However, in the instant action there had been injuries to the body of the victim,"
"as well as to her vagina and anus, which are perfectly consistent with the version"
"of events by the prosecutrix."
"The learned President’s Counsel took up the position that the learned High Court"
"Judge has failed to consider the defence position that the incident happened with"
"consent in its correct perspective."
"I find no reason to agree with such a  contention. It is clear from the stand taken"
"up by the appellants that they had not taken a consistent stand as their defence."
"When  the  prosecutrix  gave  evidence,  it  had  been  suggested  to  her  that  the"
"incident occurred with her consent. In other words, the appellants have admitted"
"having sexual intercourse with her, but has claimed that it happened with the"
"consent of the prosecutrix."
"However, when they were called upon for a defence, both of them in their dock"
"statements had not taken up the position that they had sexual intercourse with"
"her. Their position had been that they engaged in sexual activities with her that"
"were not amounting to having sexual intercourse."
"In fact, in  their dock statements, they have made several admissions as to the"
"evidence of the prosecutrix as well as other witnesses. They have admitted that"
"when they encountered the victim she was with the PW-02, and the fact that she"
"informed them that she was looking for her identity card. The fact that the victim"
"went near the house of the PW-03 had also been admitted."
