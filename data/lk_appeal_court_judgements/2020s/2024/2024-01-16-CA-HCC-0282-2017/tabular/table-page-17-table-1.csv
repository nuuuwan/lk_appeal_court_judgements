"Although 
there  are  no  eye  witnesses 
to 
the  actual 
incident  of  rape, 
the"
"prosecution  has 
led  ample  evidence  to  establish  by  way  of  circumstantial"
"evidence 
to  show 
the  credibility  and 
trustworthiness  of 
the  prosecutrixâ€™s"
"evidence."
"The  unchallenged  evidence  of  PW-03  clearly  establishes  the  fact  that    the"
"prosecutrix was forced into the three-wheeler by the two appellants, despite her"
"pleas to the PW-03 to let her into her house, where she has informed her that"
"the two persons are attempting to harass her."
"The  evidence  of  PW-02  clearly  establishes  that  the  two  appellants  came  and"
"blocked  their  path  and  attempted  to  harass  them,  and 
  as  a  result,  the"
"prosecutrix ran towards the house of PW-03."
"The police officer who investigated the matter has observed that all the places"
"indicated  by  the  prosecutrix  to  police  are  in  existence.  The  prosecutrix  has"
"straightaway  gone  to  the  police  after  the  incident  with  her  husband,  and  has"
"made a prompt complaint. Her version of events to the JMO who examined her"
"on  the  following  day  had  been  consistent  with  her  evidence  and  the  injuries"
"sustained by her."
"I  am  of 
the  view 
that  all 
these  pieces  of  evidence  have  provided  ample"
"circumstantial evidence to support the evidence of the prosecution."
"There was no basis to consider that the defence taken up by the appellants had"
"created any doubt as to the prosecution case. It is my considered view that the"
"evidence, when taken as a whole, has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt"
"against the two appellants."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  sentence  imposed  has  been  determined  after  well"
"considering the gravity of the crime and the mitigatory circumstances pleaded"
"on behalf of the appellants."
