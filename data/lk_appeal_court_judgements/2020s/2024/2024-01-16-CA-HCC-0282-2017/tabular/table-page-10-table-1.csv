"female in a compromised position near the motorcycle. According to him, when"
"he went near the motorcycle to inquire, the male person has adjusted his trouser"
"zip and moved away, and when he inquired from the female whether she is facing"

"sexual activity other than having sexual intercourse. He has claimed that after"
"the said sexual encounter, the female left on her own."
"The  2nd  accused-appellantâ€™s  version  of events  had  been  the  same,  and  he  has"
"stated that after going inside the partly built house, he had consensual oral sex"
"with her, and thereafter, the female wanted them to leave."
