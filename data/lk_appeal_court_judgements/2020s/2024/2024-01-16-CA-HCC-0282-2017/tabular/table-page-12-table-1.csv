"cannot be believed and there was no reason to accept that the incident occurred"

"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  convicted  the  appellants  for  the  offence  of"
"abduction and also for gang rape accordingly."

"prosecutrix, if it happened in the way narrated by her."
"I find no basis whatsoever to see any merit in the said argument. The prosecutrix"
"has given clear evidence that after her abduction and taken to the abandoned"
"house, through fear for life, she did not resist her assailants."
"There is no basis to assume that there should be more injuries on the body, if"
"the prosecutrix was laid on a rough surface."
"However, the medical evidence clearly establishes the fact that there had been a"
"bite mark above her right breast which cannot be attributed to anyone else other"
"than the appellants. The prosecutrix has given clear evidence that when the 1st"
"appellant removed her undergarment, her thigh got injured, which was reflective"
"in the medical evidence. The doctor has observed fresh tears in her anus as well"
"as the vagina. The prosecutrix being a  sexually active married woman who has"
"given  birth  to  three  children,  cannot  receive  such  injuries  if  she  engaged  in"
"sexual activities with consent as claimed by the appellants."
