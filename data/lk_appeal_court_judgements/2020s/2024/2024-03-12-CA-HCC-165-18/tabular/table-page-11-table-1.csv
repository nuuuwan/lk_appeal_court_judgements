"that  cause  suspicion  regarding 
the  possibility  of  committing 
this"
"murder by PW-11. According to my view, the aforesaid decision of the"
"learned  Judge  is  not  reasonable  because  there  are  occasions  that"
"murders have been committed as a result of these kinds of reasons."
"A
nother reason stated by the learned Judge to decide that there was no"
"possibility for PW-11 to commit this murder is that the accused or the"
"witnesses for the defence have never stated that PW-11 was present at"
"the place of the incident when the incident occurred (පැ. සා. 11 එම සිද්ධිය"
"සිදු වූ ස්ථානයේ සිටි බව චුදිතයන් ය ෝ විත්තිය යවනුයවන් සාක්ෂි දුන් සාක්ෂිකරු ය ෝ ඒ බවක්ෂ"
"සද න්  කයේ  නැත.  -  page  31  of  the  High  Court  Judgment).  The  said"
"observation of the learned High Court Judge clearly transpires that the"
"learned Judge has completely failed to go through the evidence of the"
"case carefully. PW-3 has clearly stated in his evidence that PW-11 was"
"there at the place of the incident. That is why he stated that after the"
"stabbing, the 2nd accused-appellant handed over the knife to PW-11 at"
"the  place  of  the  incident.  Therefore,  the  appellant  or  the  witnesses"
"called on behalf of the appellant need not establish that PW-11 was at"
"the  place  of  the  incident  because  prosecution  witness  No.3  clearly"
"stated that PW-1 was there when the incident took place. Therefore, the"
"learned  Trial  Judge 
rejected 
the  defence  version  without  proper"
"examination of the evidence presented in the Court."
"W
hen PW-11 was called in evidence by the prosecution, in the evidence"
"in  chief,  he  denied  his  presence  at  the  scene.  PW-11  also  denied"
"handing over a knife to the police as explained previously. However, in"
"cross-examination, he admitted that he picked up a knife lying on the"
"road,  and 
the  said  knife  was  handed  over 
to 
the  police.  PW-11"
"categorically denied handing over the knife by the appellant to him. In"
"the  circumstances,  the  learned  Trial  Judge  should  have  focused  his"
"attention  on  the  question  of  how  PW-11  came  into  possession  of  the"
"knife marked as P-1 and whether his story that he picked up the knife"
"when it had fallen on the road is believable. If, he found the knife on"
