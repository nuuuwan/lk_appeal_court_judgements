"stabbing which is an important item of evidence that is directly relevant"
"to  determine  the  involvement  of  the  appellant  in  this  crime  has  been"
"contradicted  by  the  prosecution  witness  No.11  himself.  When  the"
"prosecution witness No.11 stated that the knife  (P-1) that he handed"
"over to the police was found lying on the road, PW-3’s testimony that"
"the  appellant  stabbed  the  deceased  and  handed  over  the  knife  to"
"PW-11 at the place  of the incident  would be false. The importance of"
"this major contradiction is that PW-3’s testimony has become false on"
"the evidence of a witness called by the  prosecution itself, namely the"
"11th witness."
"As PW-3’s evidence cannot be acted upon for the reasons stated above,"
"there was no evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd"
"accused-appellant committed the murder of the deceased. Under these"
"circumstances, the only conclusion that the learned High Court Judge"
"could have arrived at was that the charge has not been proved beyond"
"a reasonable doubt against the 2nd accused-appellant as well. Hence,"
"even  without  considering  whether  a  reasonable  doubt  casts  on  the"
"prosecution case as a result of the defence evidence, the learned Trial"
"Judge could have proceeded to acquit the appellant."
