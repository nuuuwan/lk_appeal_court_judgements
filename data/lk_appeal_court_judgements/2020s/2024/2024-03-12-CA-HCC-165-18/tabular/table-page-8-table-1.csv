"the  evidence.  Therefore,  I  regret  that  under  any  circumstances,  I  am"
"unable to agree with the contention of the learned DSG that the concept"
"of divisibility of credibility would be applied here."
"According to the testimony of PW-3, the initial act relating to the murder"
"was committed by the 1st accused. The deceased was caught by the 1st"
"accused  when  he  got  into  the  three-wheeler.  Then,  the  deceased’s"
"hands  were  held  behind  his  back  by  the  1st  accused.  According  to"
"PW-3,  thereafter,  the  2nd  accused-appellant  stabbed  the  deceased  on"
"the chest with a knife while the 1st accused was holding the hands of"
"the deceased behind his back. If the 1st accused had not held hands of"
"the  deceased  like  that,  as  decided  by  the  learned  Trial  Judge,  the"
"stabbing of the deceased should have been done in a different manner"
"and  not  the  manner  that  PW-3  described.  Therefore,  in  view  of  the"
"learned Judge's own finding that the 1st accused did not hold the hands"
"of the deceased, the murder could not have taken place as described by"
"PW-3. In the circumstances, it is apparent that the entire story narrated"
"by PW-3 that the appellant stabbed the deceased while the 1st accused"
"was holding the hands of the deceased cannot be believed according to"
"the  finding  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  respect  of  the  1st"
"accused. Hence, PW-3’s evidence cannot be considered as credible and"
"cannot be acted upon."
