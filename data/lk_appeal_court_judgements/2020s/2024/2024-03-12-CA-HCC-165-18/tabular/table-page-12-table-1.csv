"from court until he was arrested and taken his evidence?"
"I
n  the  High  Court,  the  2nd  accused-appellant  has  given  evidence  on"
"oath. Two other witnesses for the defence also gave evidence on oath."
"The  appellant  was  cross-examined  but 
the  prosecution 
failed 
to"
"challenge 
the  credibility  of 
the  evidence  of 
the  appellant  or 
the"
"credibility  of  the  other  two  witnesses  called  on  behalf  of  the  defence."
"The  1st  accused  has  also  given  evidence  on  oath  and  stated  that  he"
"heard  people  shouting  Raja  (PW-11)  had  stabbed  the  deceased.  The"
"learned High Court Judge rejected the defence evidence on erroneous"
"findings as explained previously and accepted the prosecution evidence"
"with the aforesaid serious issues. The Supreme Court of India, held in"
"the case of Dudh Nath Pandey V. The State of U.P, decided on 11th"
