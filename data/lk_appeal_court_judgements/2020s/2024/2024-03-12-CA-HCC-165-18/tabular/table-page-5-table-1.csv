"PW-7 is not a credible witness (page 26 of the High Court Judgment)."
"The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the respondent also"
"conceded that there are serious issues regarding the credibility of the"
"evidence of PW-1 and PW-7. However, she contended that PW-2, PW-3,"
"and PW-11 are credible witnesses and the charge against the appellant"
"has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt on their evidence and the"
"evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer and the Investigating Officers."
