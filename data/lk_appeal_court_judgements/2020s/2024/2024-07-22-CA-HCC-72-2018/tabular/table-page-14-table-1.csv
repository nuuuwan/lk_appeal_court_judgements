"Held further;"
"1.  That  the  Evidence  Ordinance  is  a  statute  which  consolidates  and"
"amends the law of evidence. Therefore, the Courts are precluded from"
"refusing to admit admissible evidence on the ground of public policy."
"The Courts are not empowered to invent a new head of public policy."
"2.  That while it may undesirable that agent provocateur and others should"
"tempt or abate persons to commit offences, it is not open to a Court to"
"acquit an accused person, where the offence charged is proved, on the"
"sole ground that such evidence was procured by unfair means. Such"
"considerations may affect the credit of the witness, but such evidence"
"is not inadmissible and therefore, when the offence charged has been"
"proved on such evidence, it is the duty of the trial Judge to convict."
