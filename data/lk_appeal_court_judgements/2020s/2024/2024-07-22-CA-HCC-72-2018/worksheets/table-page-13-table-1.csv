"According  to  the  evidence  of  PW-07,  who  was  the  father  of  the  appellant,  the"
"appellant  has  come  home  a  day  after  the  deceased  was  last  seen  and  has"
"confessed to him that the deceased is dead."
"It was contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the PW-07 was"
"taken into custody by the police and had been assaulted according to his own"
"evidence,  and  therefore,  his  statement  has  been  recorded  under  duress,  and"
"thus, evidence based on such a statement cannot be accepted as a basis for a"
"conviction."
"When  the  relevant  police  officer  who  recorded  the  statement  of  PW-07  gave"
"evidence  before  the  Court,  he  has  denied  that  PW-07  was  assaulted  and  his"
"statement  was  recorded  under  duress.  That  was  the  reason  for  the  argument"
"that the evidence of PW-07 and PW-10 are contradictory in that regard."
"It is the view of this Court that no police officer will admit an assault of a person"
"under police custody when giving evidence in a Court of law. It is my view that"
"such a denial in itself cannot be considered as contradictory to the evidence of"
"PW-07."
"The admissibility of evidence obtained by illegal, improper or unfair means has"
"been well discussed by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his authoritative book, Law"
"of Evidence, Volume II (Book 2) Chapter 27, pages 989 â€“ 1041."
"He has clearly expressed the view that such evidence cannot be excluded merely"
"on the basis that they were obtained illegally, improperly or by unfair means by"
"itself."
"In the case of Rajapakse (Excise Inspector) Vs. Fernando (1951) 52 NLR 36,"
"a Supreme Court bench of three Judges consisting of Dias S. P. J., Gunasekara,"
"J.  and  Pulle,  J.  having  considered  a  case  where  in  a  prosecution  under  the"
"Excise Ordinance, an excise officer tendered evidence which was discovered by"
"him in the course of an illegal or irregular search, overruling three decisions of"
"Nagalingam, J. on the same question, held that, such evidence was admissible."
