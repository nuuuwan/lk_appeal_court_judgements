"Section 27. This judgment was cited with approval in Iver Vs. Galgoda 44 NLR"
"94."
"It is clear from the judgment under appeal that the learned High Court Judge"
"has not used the recovery made in terms of the statement made by the appellant"
"as  the  sole  reason  for  the  conviction.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  only"
"considered  the  fact  that  if  not  for  the  knowledge  of  the  appellant,  the  said"
"discoveries  would  not  have  been  made,  in  her  deliberations  and  evaluation  of"
"evidence, as pieces of circumstantial evidence against the appellant, for which I"
"do not find any reason to disagree."
"The  2nd  ground  of  appeal  was  on  the  basis  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to"
"establish the chain of custody of productions."
"It is clear from the evidence that it was the main investigating officer (PW-11),"
"who has recovered the cable alleged to have been used in committing the crime"
"and  blue-coloured  pieces  of  cloth  from  the  crime  scene,  as  well  as  from  the"
"kitchen of the appellantâ€™s house. The cable and the pieces of cloth recovered from"
"the  house  have  been  recovered  based  on  the  section  27  statement  of  the"
"appellant. After the discovery, the cable has been kept as it is until the arrival of"
"the Magistrate to hold the inquest, and thereafter, all the relevant productions"
"have been handed over to the police reserve. After obtaining a Court order in that"
"regard,  the  relevant  productions  have  been  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst"
"under proper custody and had been duly returned after the Government Analyst"
"Report was made available. Although it was alleged that there had been a break"
"in the chain of custody, I do not find any reason to accept such a contention."
"The  ground  of  appeal  number  5,  6,  and  7  was  on  the  basis  that  the  police"
"statement of the main witness, namely PW-07 (the father of the appellant), has"
"been obtained illegally under duress and torture, and because of the inherent"
"weaknesses of his evidence, it was unsafe to place reliance on such evidence. It"
"was also argued that the evidence of PW-07 was contradictory to that of PW-10."
