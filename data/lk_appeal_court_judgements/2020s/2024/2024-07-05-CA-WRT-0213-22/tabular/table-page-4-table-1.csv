"Subsequently,  the  Department  of  Pensions  issued  two  additional  awards  of  pension  dated"
"21.01.2020 marked ‘P11’ and 11.02.2020 marked ‘P12’. The 'P11' award recouped the excess"
"pension  previously  paid  to  the  Petitioner,  while  the  'P12'  award  included  an  additional"
"increment for the Petitioner. The Petitioner’s pension was further adjusted in accordance with"
"the Pension Circular 14/2019, which applies to all retired public officers."
"The Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa, affirming an affidavit, states that an amount of Rs."
"4864.02 representing 20% of the pension, was mistakenly not deducted during the previous"
"pension  revision.  It  is  observed  that  the  Divisional  Secretary  is  required  to  follow  the"
"disciplinary  orders  marked  'P5'  and  'P5a'  when  making  the  Petitioner’s  monthly  pension"
"payments.  Consequently,  Rs.  148,885.46  was erroneously  credited  to  the  Petitioner’s  bank"
"account. The excess amount of Rs. 82,688.34 has since been recovered in accordance with"
"section  43(a)  of  the  Minutes  on  Pensions,  as  amended  by  Gazette  No.  1776/40  dated"
"21.09.2012."
"The Respondents, in addition to submitting the award of pension marked ‘R1’, have presented"
"the Court with another award of pension dated 30.08.2011, marked ‘Rx’. They argue that the"
"Petitioner has not contested the said ‘Rx’ award or any other awards of pension and as such"
"the  Petitioner  has  acquiesced  to  the  receipt  of  the  pensions  as  calculated  according  to  the"
"disciplinary orders marked ‘P5’ and ‘P5a’."
"The Petitioner contends that there is no rational basis for calculating the subtraction of the"
"gratuity amounting to Rs. 295,273 reflected in the award of pension marked ‘R1’ from the"
"commuted  gratuity  amounting  to  Rs.  369,091  stipulated  in  the  award  of  pension  dated"
"30.08.2011, marked ‘Rx’, since the original gratuity payment was Rs. 287,152 in the pension"
"award dated 24.02.2010, marked ‘P7’. Therefore, the Petitioner argues that there is no rational"
"basis for paying him Rs. 73,818, which is the difference between Rs. 369,091 and Rs. 295,273."
"However, the Statement of Objections of the 1st to 4th Respondents and the affidavit from the"
"Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa outline the events that led the Department of Pensions to"
"amend  the  awards  of  pension,  which  the  Petitioner  has  not  contested.  The  Petitioner's"
"complaint is solely based on the contents of the said Accountant’s letter marked ‘P14’."
