"The learned State Counsel who appears for the 1st to 4th Respondents, referring to the award"
"of  pension  dated  30.08.2011  (‘Rx’)  submitted  that  all  arrears  have  been  duly  paid  to  the"
"Petitioner and the current pension is being paid in accordance with the said award of pension"
"‘Rx’. It is noted that the Petitioner is not challenging the contents of the said award of pension."
"I take the view that the Petitioner has not demonstrated to Court that the said Accountant"
"failed to properly calculate the awards of pension issued by the Department of Pensions. The"
"Petitioner's main argument is that there is no rational basis for subtracting the gratuity amount"
"in the award of pension ‘R1'. However, after thoroughly reviewing the documents marked"
"'Rx' and 'Rx2' (including the annexures to 'Rx2'), the Court is unable to find any errors in the"
"calculation in the impugned letter marked 'R14'."
"I find no significant discrepancies in the data reflected in 'Rx2', which includes details from"
"2010 to 2023, when comparing the awards of pension with the averments of the Respondents'"
"Statement of Objections. Additionally, I take the view that sufficient evidence or material has"
"not  been  provided  to  Court  to  establish  any  alleged  errors  in  the  impugned  letter  'P14',"
"contradicting the unchallenged awards of pension. Anyhow, I need to make an observation"
"that the Petitioner should be duly paid his pension in terms of the award of pension marked"
"‘Rx’ without him being subjected to any undue distress by the relevant authorities."
"In light of the above, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for"
"in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application subjected to"
"the above observation."
