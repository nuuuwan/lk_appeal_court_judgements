"recording of evidence, are the following:"
"1.  Assessment and determination of 'credibility' of witnesses."
"2.  Determination of 'testimonial trustworthiness' of the testimonies given by"
"witnesses."
"3.  Analysis of the evidence."
"4.  Determination of the 'probative value' (weight) to be attached to evidence"
"and the 'sufficiency' of evidence to prove the charges."
"5.  Determination of whether the prosecution has 'proven the ingredients of"
"the offence(s)' the accused stands charged."
"6.  If the defence has relied on a 'general or special exception to criminal"
"liability', whether the defence has proven such exception."
"7.  Determination of whether the prosecution has proven its case 'beyond"
"reasonable doubt', and contra wise, whether the defence has raised a"
"'reasonable doubt' regarding the case for the prosecution."
