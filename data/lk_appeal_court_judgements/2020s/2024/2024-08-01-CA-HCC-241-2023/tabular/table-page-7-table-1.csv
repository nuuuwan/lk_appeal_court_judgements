"the trial judge has correctly performed the above-mentioned functions, but also"
"on a careful consideration of the totality of testimonies given by witnesses and"
"the evidence of the case. However, it is important to note that a verdict arrived at"
"without the proper performance of the afore-stated testimony and evidence"
"related functions would be unlawful and hence should be vacated in appeal,"
"only if such failure on the part of the trial judge had prejudiced the substantial"
"rights of the accused or occasioned a failure of justice.”"
"Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that there is merit worthy"
"consideration in the grounds of appeal raised by the learned President’s"
"Counsel for the appellant and those submission have convinced this court that"
"the accused-appellant, in the instant matter, has been denied of a fair trial,"
"which vitiates the conviction and the sentence entered by trial judge against"
"the appellant."
"As such the instant appeal is allowed and the accused-appellant is acquitted of"
"the charge in the indictment."
