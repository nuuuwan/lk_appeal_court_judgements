"The sole and the only lay witness of the prosecution namely, Priyanthika, PW-"
"01, who is the wife of the deceased, had been led in evidence by the"
"prosecution to say that on the day of the incident, which is the day before the"
"new year, around 1pm, a friend by the name Sarath had visited the deceased."
"The deceased and Sarath had been talking outside and PW-01 had been"
"cooking in the kitchen, when she had heard Sarath shouting “Nandasena aiya"
"assaulted”. The witness had gone out to see the deceased fallen and the"
"accused running away with a mammoty and Sarath had been standing nearby."
"The accused is the brother of the deceased, who had lived nearby and they had"
"shared a well in the garden. Thereafter the deceased had been rushed to"
"hospital, where he had succumbed to his injuries on the 23rd of April 2010. In"
"the examination in chief, she had said that she made the first complaint on 16-"
"04-2010, but in cross examination she had admitted that there was a"
"statement made before the 16th, when the police had visited the house (pg 69)."
"Therefore, there had been two statements made by the witness and the"
"statement made on 16-04-2010 is not really the first statement. The"
"prosecution has failed to provide this statement made prior to the 16th, to the"
"defence and they have also failed to question the police witnesses regarding"
"this matter. It is a well-accepted principle that the first information received by"
"the police should always be made available to the defence to formulate their"
"case. This has been dealt very lengthily in the decided case submitted by the"
"learned President’s Counsel for the appellant, which is Wijepala v The"
"Attorney General (2000) 1 Sri L. R. 46 at 51, decided by Justice Mark"
"Fernando states that, “The failure to disclose to an accused the existence and"
"contents of the first information…. May well result in a miscarriage of justice."
"Rule 52 of the Supreme Court rules 1988, requires an Attorney at law appearing"
"for the prosecution to bring to the notice of court any matter, which if with held"
"will lead to the miscarriage of justice. That is a professional obligation founded"
"on a constitutional right to a fair trial. I hold that if Senarathna had made a"
"statement at 9.30pm, that statement should’ve been brought to the notice of the"
"court and the defence, and the failure to do so was a violation of article 13(3), by"
"which all courts are bound.”"
"Therefore, it was the duty of the prosecuting counsel to have brought to the"
"notice of court that there were two statements made by this witness and if the"
"counsel was not aware of it beforehand it is his or her duty to question the"
"police thereafter during the trial, which has not been done in the instant"
"matter. Therefore, as submitted by the learned President Counsel, there is a"
"great miscarriage of justice caused to the appellant, which has denied him a"
"fair trial."
"The witness has been cross examined further and she had been questioned on"
"a very fundamental omission in her statement to police made on 16-04-2010"
