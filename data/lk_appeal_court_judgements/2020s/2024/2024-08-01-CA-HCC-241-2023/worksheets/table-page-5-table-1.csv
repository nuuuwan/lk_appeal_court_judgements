"accused-appellant on 25-04-2010. According to the evidence of PW-01at pg 84"
"of the appeal brief, the alleged mammoty had been recovered among the tea"
"bushes by P.C Karunaratne on 16-04-2010 and not on 25-04-2010. This is the"
"evidence of the sole lay witness for the prosecution, therefore it clearly shows a"
"very serious doubt with regard to the recovery of this weapon. But the defence"
"has challenged the recovery of the weapon vehemently. The learned trial judge,"
"as alleged by the counsel for the appellant, has wrongfully considered the"
"impact of Section 27 recovery and has gone on to comment on the exclusive"
"possession of the weapon by the accused. It is fundamental that when a fact is"
"discovered subsequent to a statement of an accused, that only the knowledge"
"of the whereabouts of the said fact should be attributed to the accused and"
"nothing else. It has been held so in the case of Etin Singho and another v The"
"Queen 69 NLR 353."
"The appellant had made statement from the dock denying the incident, but the"
"trial judge has held that “the mere denial” by the accused does not create a"
"reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution which places an undue burden"
"on the appellant and is a clear violation of the presumption of innocence of an"
"accused until he or she is proven otherwise."
"Therefore, in the instant matter, the prosecution has violated its fundamental"
"prosecutorial duties such as not providing the first information to the"
"appellant, and not placing the evidence of Sarath before court or at least not"
"taking steps to explain to court as to why he was not called as a witness."
"It is a cardinal principle in the criminal justice system in Sri Lanka that when a"
"criminal charge is preferred against an accused, the prosecution must prove its"
"case beyond a reasonable doubt. But in the instant case, the prosecution has"
"failed to do so. The prosecution has not proved on circumstantial evidence that"
"no one else, other than the accused, had the opportunity of committing the"
"murder."
"On perusal of the judgement by the learned trial judge, it has to be said with"
"much surprise that the trial judge has failed to consider the basic principles"
"with regard to  the evaluation of circumstantial evidence, the importance of the"
"appellant being given all material against him to formulate his defence, the"
"applicability of Section 114(f) of the Evidence ordinance, with regard to the"
"non-availability of Sarath’s evidence in the case, the misdirection with regards"
"to the recovery made under Section 27(1) of the Evidence ordinance, the"
"appellant being unreasonably given a burden to prove his innocence in the"
"dock statement and lastly his scant disregard to the vital omission in the"
"evidence of PW-01."
"All these lapses on the part of the trial judge, have denied a fair trial to the"
"appellant, which is enshrined in our constitution. It has been held in the case"
