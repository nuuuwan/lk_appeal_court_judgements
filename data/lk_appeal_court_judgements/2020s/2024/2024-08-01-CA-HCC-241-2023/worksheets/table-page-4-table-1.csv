"(pg 80), where she had not mentioned at all about Sarath, shouting that the"
"accused assaulted the deceased. Furthermore, contradiction marked as V1 has"
"been marked where she had said to the police that there was a dispute between"
"the two brothers over the well (pg 74) however in court, she had not said so."
"This contradiction and omission, the trial judge has concluded, has not"
"affected the truthfulness of the witness, which this court is surprised to"
"observe because the statements have been made soon after the incident,"
"therefore if she had been truthful it would’ve been the best opportunity for her"
"to have implicated the accused. Therefore, there is a very serious omission with"
"regard to the presence of the accused at the scene, which is only spoken to by"
"the witness in the prosecution. It is shocking to observe that PW-01, being the"
"only witness for the prosecution, speaks of the presence of another person"
"named Sarath at the scene, who had not been called as a witness and neither"
"a statement being recorded from him. If the prosecution was to rely on"
"circumstantial evidence, as they have tried to, the presence of Sarath at the"
"scene is an important and vital link to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it"
"was only the accused and none other, who committed the murder of the"
"deceased. Therefore, the evidence of Sarath not being available in the case for"
"the prosecution leaves a very obvious lacuna in the case for the prosecution"
"and also leaves a great doubt regarding the culpability of the accused."
"On this point, the learned counsel for the prosecution relied on section 114(f) of"
"the Evidence ordinance. The learned counsel cited the case of Walimunige"
"John and another v The State, 76 NLR 488, decided by G.P.A Silva S.P.J,"
"where it has been held that, “The question of a presumption arises only where a"
"witness whose evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative is withheld by the"
"prosecution and the failure to call such witness constitutes a vital missing link in"
"the case for the prosecution and where the reasonable inference to be drawn"
"from the omission to call the witness is that, if called would not have supported"
"the prosecution.”"
"Therefore, the non-availability of Sarath in the evidence of the prosecution"
"creates a reasonable doubt with regards to the culpability of the accused"
"because Sarath’s possible involvement has not been excluded by the"
"prosecution and in addition, if Sarath had been called in evidence, he could"
"have explained how the incident occurred, as according to Priyanthika’s"
"evidence, Sarath was with the deceased at the time of the incident."
"The prosecution has proceeded to call the evidence of the police officers but as"
"stated above has not probed into the fact of PW-01 making two statements to"
"the police and as to why at least a statement was not recorded from Sarath."
"The other very glaring ground raised by the counsel for the appellant is the"
"recovery, which the police are supposed to have made on the statement of the"
