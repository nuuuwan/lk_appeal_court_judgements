"A
nother discrepancy that was shown is that according to PW-1, when"
"he  asked 
the  appellant  whether  she  possessed  with  any 
illegal"
"substance,  she  kept  silent  (page  61  of  the  appeal  brief).  According  to"
"PW-7,  when  PW-1  asked  whether  she  possessed  with  any 
illegal"
"substances,  the  appellant  had  replied  that  she  does  not  possess"
"anything.  This 
is  also  a  vital  contradiction  because 
in  her  dock"

"most  important  moment  of  the  raid,  a  reasonable  doubt  arises  as  to"
"whether a raid was carried out as the prosecution witnesses claim or"
"whether the arrest of the appellant could happen in the way that she"
"described in her dock statement."
"A

"11.50  hours  to  12  hours;  that  is,  10  minutes.  Hence,  there is  a  vital"
"discrepancy 
in

the  house  of 
the"
