"Furthermore, considering the evidence of the victim, it is very obvious that the"
"victim had not been able to state at least the specific period of which the"
"offence is supposed to have been committed. The prosecution has calculated"
"the period of offence by the date in the police statement and the victim saying"
"that the offence took place three weeks prior to the date of the statement."
"It has been suggested to PW-01 that she made a statement to the police on"
"17.10.2014 (page 57 of the appeal brief. PW-01 also stated that the incident"
"took place about three weeks prior to the date that she made a statement to"
"the police. Even if, the incident took place six weeks prior to the date of the"
"police statement, the incident should have taken place within the month of"
"September in the year 2014. However, when PW-01 gave the history to the"
"doctor who examined her on 17.10.2014, she stated that the incident had"
"taken place prior to the August vacation. Therefore, the periods stated by PW-"
"01 to the doctor and in giving evidence in court are totally contradictory."
"According to her evidence in court, the offence should have been committed"
"definitely after the August school vacation. This vital contradiction seriously"
"affects the credibility of PW-01's story."
"According to the prosecution, as the victim cannot remember the exact date of"
"the offence, a period has been specified in the charge. The said period extends"
"to more than six months. When PW-01 stated to the doctor about the period"
"that the incident took place, she had not stated how many dates, how many"
"weeks or how many months prior to the August vacation, the incident took"
"place. Dates in January, February, and March 2014 are also the dates prior to"
"the August vacation. The accused-appellant had been charged for committing"
"the offence of ""grave sexual abuse"" within the period of 01 April 2014 to 16"
"October 2014. Therefore, the prosecution has not established beyond a"
"reasonable doubt that the alleged offence had been committed during the"
"lengthy period specified in the charge apart from the aforesaid vital"
"contradiction regarding the period of offence. When the prosecution has not"
"established that the accused committed the offence during the period specified"
"in the charge, it cannot be concluded that the charge has been proved beyond"
"a reasonable doubt against the accused-appellant."
"Hence, the question arises whether the prosecution can frame its charges on"
"vague and contradictory evidence and if so, it denies a fair trial to the"
"appellant."
"Therefore, it is the opinion of this Court that the time period specified in the"
"indictment has been drafted on a wrong premise and violating the provisions of"
"the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and if that is so the accused-appellant did"
"not have a charge to answer."
