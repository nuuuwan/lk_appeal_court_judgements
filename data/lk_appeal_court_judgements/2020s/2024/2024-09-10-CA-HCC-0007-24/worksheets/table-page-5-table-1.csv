"In the said judgement, the case of Attorney General v Viraj Aponso and"
"Others S.C 24/2008, is quoted in which the Supreme Court has laid down"
"guidelines for a fair trial and the said guidelines clearly stipulate that, “It is"
"clear, that it is the responsibility of the prosecution to inform the time, place and"
"the offence clearly to the person who is charged. It is fundamental for the"
"accused-appellant to formulate his defence.”"
"In the same judgement quoted above, it is further stated that, “If the accused"
"wants to take up the defence of alibi, he cannot do so because there is no date or"
"time given.”"
"It has gone onto quote the case of R.H.M.S Premathunga alias Ananda v"
"Attorney General CA 01/2013 decided on 31/01/2014 where Sisira J. De"
"Abrew, J held that, “…...is to give sufficient opportunity to the accused to answer"
"the charge and ensure a fair trial.”"
"The parallel section to 165 of our Code of Criminal Procedure Act is Section"
"212 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, where the same ingredients of"
"Section 165 of our code has been stated."
"In the Indian case of A.N Mukergi v State A.I.R 1969 All 489 at page 496 and"
"Ram Asrey v State of U.P 1982 A.L.J 1138, it has been stated that, “The"
"charge to state the offence and contain particulars as to the time and place of the"
"alleged offence and the person against whom it was committed, is important.”"
"The Indian Code of Criminal Procedure Section 212(2) is particularly similar to"
"our Section 165(2), where an exception has been made with regards to offences"
"of criminal breach of trust and dishonest misappropriation, where it is not"
"required to state the exact time or date of the offence."
"It has been held in the Indian case of Sukhdev v State of M.P 1995(2) Crimes"
"336 at pg 337 that, “Time of the commission of offence is of great"
"significance…... counsel for the complainant fairly conceded that there is"
"substantial defect in the framing of the charge when the timing has been"
"misquoted.”"
"Therefore, in the instant matter the appellant has been charged for the period"
"of 01-04-2014 to 16-10-2014 as per 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,"
"there is no specific time or a date given by the prosecution for the appellant to"
"formulate his defence which denies a fair trial. Therefore, considering all the"
"proceedings during the trial, the oral and written submissions of both parties, I"
"find that the accused-appellant was never given a specific date/period of the"
"offence as per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Hence it is the"
"opinion of this court that the appellant did not have a charge to answer."
