"Hence, considering the other grounds of appeal does not serve any purpose."
"Therefore, there is no order with regard to grounds number 2, 3 and 4, raised"
"by the learned counsel for the appellant."
"As such, it is the opinion of this court that the prosecution framing the charge"
"within a period has denied the appellants right to be able to formulate his"
"defense and further more framing the charge within a period on vague evidence"
"also denies a fair trial to the appellant."
"Therefore, I conclude that there was no fair trial awarded to the accused-"
"appellant. Iâ€™m surprised that the trial judge has failed to observe this,"
"nevertheless justice to the accused-appellant should be done even at this later"
"stage."
"As such, for the reasons stated above, the instant appeal is allowed and the"
"accused-appellant is acquitted of the charge in the indictment."
