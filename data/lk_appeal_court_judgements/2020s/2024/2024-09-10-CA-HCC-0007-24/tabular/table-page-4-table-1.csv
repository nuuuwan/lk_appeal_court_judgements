"shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged"
"offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose."
"Therefore, with regards to the above section, every charge must contain the"
"time and place of the alleged offence to give the accused notice of the matter of"
"which he is charged with."
"But if the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest"
"misappropriation of movable property it must be sufficient to mention the"
"period (dates) in which the offences were alleged to have been committed"
"without specifying a particular or exact date. But the instant offence is not of"
"Criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of movable property."
"Therefore, it is important for the accused person to know a specific date to"
"frame his defence."
"This position has been lengthily discussed in the case of Kamburawela"
"Kankanamalage Dayarathne alias  “Chuti mama” v The Attorney General,"
"CA 188/2015 decided on 22ndSeptember 2017 by his Lordship S. Thurairaja"
"PC, J, in which it has been stated that, “As per our constitution the accused is"
"entitled for a fair trial, especially when there is a criminal prosecution the"
"charge which includes the time and the place should be clearly informed to the"
"accused, together with the relevant law.”"
