"When  considering  whether  the  dock  statement  of  the  1st  accused-"
"appellant  creates  a  reasonable  doubt  on  the  prosecution  case,  it  is"
"apparent that the position taken up from the dock has never been put"
"to  the  prosecution  witnesses.  It  was  held  in  the  Indian  Judgment  of"
"Sarvan Singh V. State of Punjab (2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652) pages 3655"
"and 3656 which was cited in the case of Ratnayake Mudiyanselage"
"Premachandra  V.  The  Hon.  Attorney  General  –  C.A.  Case  No."
"79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 that “It is a rule of essential justice"
"that  whenever  the  opponent  has  declined  to  avail  himself  of  the"
"opportunity  to  put  his  case  in  cross-examination,  it  must  follow  that"
"the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.” Therefore,"
"the learned High Court Judge is correct in rejecting the dock statement"
"of the 1st appellant  and deciding that the prosecution has proved the"
"charge against the 1st accused-appellant beyond a reasonable doubt."
