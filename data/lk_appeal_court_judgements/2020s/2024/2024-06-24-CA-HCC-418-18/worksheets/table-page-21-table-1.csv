"The 2nd ground of appeal:-"
"In  the  second  ground  of  appeal,  it  was  urged  that  the  evidence  creates  a"
"reasonable doubt as to the charges preferred against the appellant."
"It was contended by the learned President’s Counsel that when the PW-01 was"
"stopped  for  the  relevant  traffic  violation  by  the  appellant,  he  has  not  solicited"
"any bribe and it was the PW-01 who has asked for a spot fine from the appellant,"
"which shows that the appellant never had the intention of soliciting a bribe."
"It was submitted that although the owner of the vehicle was also present in his"
"vehicle at  that time, no statement had been recorded from him, which should"
"have corroborated the version of events by the PW-01. It was submitted further"
"that the appellant being a police officer has done his duty correctly, and has been"
"purposely targeted for that and false charges had been initiated against him."
"The learned President’s Counsel also mentioned that although the learned High"
"Court Judge has determined that there were no contradictions in the prosecution"
"evidence, in fact, there were several contradictions and omissions. Referring to"
"the evidence of PW-01 and that of the decoy (PW-02), he contended that the said"
"discrepancies have not been considered by the learned High Court Judge."
"It  is  trite  law  that  discrepancies  or  omissions  in  evidence  have  to  be  material"
"discrepancies and omissions that goes into the core of the prosecution case. The"
"fact that there are discrepancies, in itself, is not a reason to doubt the evidence"
"of the prosecution witnesses."
