"It was observed:"
"“The  question  then  is,  what  is  the  evidentiary  value  of  such  a  witness."
"According to E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy (The Law of Evidence Vol II Book"
"2, 818) there are two views on the question of the evidentiary value of the"
"evidence  of  a  witness  who  has  been  treated  as  hostile.  According  to  one"
"view, the evidence is of some value and is not to be disregarded altogether"
"and the other view, the evidence is of no value and cannot be relied on for"
"the party calling the witness and or the other party. It is doubtful whether"
"the maxim, “Falsus in uno falsus in omnibus” could be applied to this class"
"of cases. The underlying  principle for allowing the party to the subject their"
"own witness to virtual cross-examination, stems not so much because the"
"witness  is  necessarily  untruthful,  more  so  because  the  witness  shows"
"hostility towards the party who called the witness."
"If the evidence given by a discredited witness in terms of section 154 is to"
"be used it must be done with great caution and care and should not be acted"
"upon  unless  parts  of  his  testimony  is  corroborated  by  some  independent"
"evidence.”"
