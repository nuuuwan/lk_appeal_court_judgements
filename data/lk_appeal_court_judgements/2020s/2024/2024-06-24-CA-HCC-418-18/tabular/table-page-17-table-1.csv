"of  some  advantage  in  casting  doubts  on  the  general  credibility  of  the"
"witness, its more consequences is to cause grave prejudice to the accused.‚Äù"
"It is my considered view that considering the above-mentioned observation in its"
"isolation would be misleading as to the judgment  pronounced by  the Court of"
"Criminal Appeal."
"This  was  a  case  where  the  prosecution  called  the  father  of  the  accused  and"
"elicited  from  him  only  the  fact  of  identification  of  the  deceased  at  the  post-"
"mortem  examination,  knowing  very  well  that  he  has  spoken  more  about  the"
"incident in his deposition before the Magistrate."
"Under  cross-examination,  the  witness  has  given  evidence  to  suggest  that  the"
"other witness may not have been able to identify the assailant, there was no ill-"
"feeling between the deceased women and the accused, who was the brother of"
"her  husband.  He  has  also  given  answers  to  suggest  that  there  was  police"
"interference with the witnesses."
"This  has  prompted  the  trial  Judge  to  allow  the  prosecution  application  to  act"
"under  section  154  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  where  the  prosecuting  State"
"Counsel  has  proved  several  inconsistencies  in  the  deposition  made  by  the"
"witness before the Magistrate, of which the Court has found no fault."
"However, during this examination and due to certain remarks made by the State"
"Counsel, the Court has found that the prosecuting State Counsel knew from the"
"very outset of the case that the witness will not testify against his own son and"
"was expecting to confront the witness in terms of section 154 of the Evidence"
"Ordinance.  It  is  clear  from  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal,  the"
"above  cited  observation  had  been  made  in  that  context,  and  not  in  order  to"
"determine that the prosecution has failed to prove the case."
