"the cross-examination. It has been his position that although he was informed"
"that an action will be filed in Court on the 17th, he was informed by the appellant"
"to come with Rs. 2500/- before that date to take the licence back."
"The  witness  has  also  stated  that  subsequent  to  this  incident,  he  received"
"summons from Mawanalla Magistrateâ€™s Court and he was fined Rs. 1000/- for"
"the traffic offence. He has denied the suggestion that he filmed the events which"
"were unfolded at the police station."
"The  only  suggestion  made  to  the  witness  by  way  of  a  defence  had  been  that"
"because the appellant objected for his intention of paying a lesser fine without"
"him  having  to  go  to  Court,  PW-01  instigated  a  false  accusation  against  the"
"appellant,  of  which  the  PW-01  has  again  denied,  saying  that  he  had  no"
"connection with the appellant."
"PW-02 had been the officer of the Bribery Commission who accompanied PW-01"
"as  the  decoy.  He  has  confirmed  that  he  went  along  with  PW-01  to  the  police"
"station and met the appellant at the traffic division of the Mawanalla police. He"
"has stated that when they met the appellant, he inquired about him from PW-01"
"and wanted both of them to wait outside. However, since he was the decoy, PW-"
"-02 had observed what was happening and had  observed  the appellant  telling"
"the  other  officers  who  were  at  the  traffic  division  to  leave.  Thereafter,  the"
"appellant  has  inquired  from  the  PW-01  whether  he  brought  the  money.  After"
"having  obtained  the  money  from  him,  PW-01  has  given  the  money  to  the"
"appellant. He has seen the appellant putting the money to his right-hand side"
"pocket of the trouser. He has also seen the appellant handing over a document"
"taken out from his table drawer to PW-01. At that point, the other members of"
"the raiding party had come and entered the office of the appellant."
"When inquired from the PW-01, he has informed the decoy and the raiding party"
"that the money was given to the appellant and the temporary permit given to him"
"by the appellant was not the one belonging to him."
