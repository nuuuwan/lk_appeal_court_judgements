"station. He has seen the appellant resisting the arrest. The officer who was in"
"charge of the raid has informed him to order the appellant to cooperate, which"
"he did."
"Thereafter, he has returned to his office and had taken necessary steps to inform"
"his higher officials about the raid. The officer who conducted the raid has also"
"come to his office and made a call to the Director of the Bribery Commission."
"It had been his evidence that while he was in the office, one of the other officers"
"of the raiding team came to the office and informed the Officer-in-Charge of the"
"raid that “found in a dustbin.” However, he has stated that he did not know what"
"was found, but believed it was something relevant to the raid."
"At the conclusion of the cross-examination of PW-05, the prosecution has moved"
"to treat him as a witness detrimental to the prosecution case in terms of section"
"154  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  and  had  moved  to  cross-examine  him  on  that"
"basis. Accordingly, the learned trial Judge has allowed the application."
"It appears from the line of cross-examination of the PW-05 by the prosecution,"
"what he said while  being cross-examined that one of the other officers came and"
"said to the Officer-in-Charge of the raid that “found in a dustbin”  had been the"
"main reason that has prompted the application under section 154."
"The prosecution has established that when the OIC made his statement to the"
"officials of the Commission after the raid, he has not stated such a thing. It has"
"been suggested to him that because of his connections to the appellant, he was"
"attempting  to  help  him.  Admitting  that  he  did  not  say  such  a  thing  in  his"
"statement, it had been his position that he said that in his evidence because it"
"came to his mind while giving evidence, but not with the intention of helping the"
"appellant in the case."
"After leading the evidence of some of the other officers who assisted in the raid,"
"the prosecution has closed the case."
