"Having considered the evidence placed before the Court, the learned High Court"
"Judge has decided to call for a defence from the appellant. He has chosen to give"
"evidence under oath and to call a witness on his behalf."
"In  his  evidence,  the  appellant  has  admitted  that  he  stopped  the  PW-01  for  a"
"traffic  violation  on  06-09-2008  as  stated  by  him  in  his  evidence,  and  had"
"admitted  that  the  PW-01  came  to  him  and  told  him  to  shape  it  up  (ක ේප්  රලො"
"කදන්න). It has been his evidence that he took it as a hint of attempting to give"
"him a bribe, and he informed the Sub-Inspector Illangakoon who was with him"
"to  issue  a  temporary  licence.  He  has  testified  that  even  after  the  issue  of  the"
"temporary  licence,  the  PW-01  came  to  him  and  uttered  a  name  of  a  Deputy"
"Inspector General, but he told him to come to the Court on the 17-09-2009."
"It had been his position that on 10-09-2008, although he was not sure whether"
"it was the same driver, PW-01 came to his office at the Mawanella police station"
"and wanted him to issue a spot fine. Since the offence committed was an offence"
"which cannot issue a spot fine, the appellant has instructed the person to come"
"to the Court on 17-09-2009. He has admitted the endorsement made by him on"
"the 10th in the temporary licence. He has further stated that on the 11-09-2008,"
"the PW-01 came to his office again with another person around 2.15 p.m. and"
"wanted him to issue a spot fine."
"It had been his position that he refused that request and instructed one of the"
"WPC’s called Prabha, who was attending to office work at that time, to write the"
"Court date and give them."
"Thereafter,  the  appellant  had    his  lunch  and  returned  to  his  seat.  The  earlier"
"mentioned person has come to him again, and at the same time, some persons"
"have come and attempted to handcuff him, informing him that they are from the"
"Bribery  Commission.  It  had  been  his  position  that  since  he  did  not  take  any"
"bribe,  he  resisted  the  arrest  and  the  ensuing  struggle  lasted  for  about  ten"
"minutes.  He  has  claimed  that  no  money  was  taken  from  his  possession,  but"
"those who arrested him recovered some money under a table which was three"
