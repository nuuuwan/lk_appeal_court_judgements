"relevant to this case which were under his custody, and has spoken about the"
"appellant’s position at the police station and several other factors relating to the"
"Mawanalla  police  station.  It  was  only  when  he  was  cross-examined  by  the"
"learned Counsel for the appellant, he has stated things which appears to be an"
"attempt to help the appellant."
"Although PW-05 has been treated as an adverse witness based on what he said,"
"in my view, this was not a situation where the prosecution should have moved"
"to act under section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance, as what was said by PW-05"
"had no evidential value. PW-05 has spoken about a thing supposed to have been"
"said by another person which he overheard without even identifying who said"
"that.  This  is  clearly hearsay  evidence  which  has  no  value.  Besides  that,  there"
"was  no  dispute  that  the  money  used  in the  raid  was  recovered  by  the  raiding"
"party on the floor where the incident of struggling with the appellant took place."
"The only difference being the prosecution evidence which says that the money"
"was recovered on the floor near the table of the appellant, while the appellant’s"
"position was that it was recovered some 5-6 meters away."
"The  evidence  considered  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  evaluating  the"
"prosecution case to find whether it has proved the evidence beyond reasonable"
"doubt has only used the official documents produced by PW-05 which are also"
"not disputed documents. Therefore, I am of the view that the learned High Court"
"Judge was not misdirected when it was decided to consider the evidence of PW-"
"05."
"It is also noteworthy to mention that the learned High Court Judge has not only"
"considered the evidence of PW-05 in relation to the prosecution case, but also"
"has given equal weight to his evidence in deciding whether the appellant’s version"
"of events can be accepted in that regard. This shows that the learned High Court"
"Judge has not looked at the evidence in a partial manner."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that there exists no basis"
"for this Court to consider that no fair trial was afforded to the appellant."
