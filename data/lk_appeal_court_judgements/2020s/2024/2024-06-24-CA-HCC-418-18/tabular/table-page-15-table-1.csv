"It  was  contended  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  highly  depended  on  the"
"contents of the documents marked P-08(1) to P-08(6) in a manner detrimental to"
"the  appellant,  and  these  are  matters  where  the  appellant  did  not  have  the"
"opportunity of explaining."
"The other matter put forward as a denial of a fair trial was the learned High Court"
"Judge’s decision to  consider some parts of the evidence of  PW-05 as relevant,"
"despite  him  being  treated  as  a  hostile  witness  in  terms  of  section  154  of  the"
"Evidence Ordinance."
"It is clear from the judgment that the learned High  Court  Judge has  carefully"
"considered whether the position taken up by the appellant, that for an offence of"
"crossing the center white line, he cannot issue a spot fine and it was the reason"
"he refused the request made by PW-01 to him."
"As correctly considered at page 20 of the judgment (page 716 of the appeal brief),"
"it  has  been  determined  that  it  was  the  correct  legal  position.  However,  by"
"meticulously  studying  the  documents  marked  from  P-08(1)  to  P-08(6),  the"
"learned High Court Judge has found that although the said position was legally"
"correct, the practice followed has been to issue spot fines for the said offence as"
"well. It has been found that even on the same day, a spot fine has been issued"
"by the appellant to another motorist who committed the same offence."
"Based on the said findings, it had been determined that the appellant’s attempt"
"to create a doubt as to the evidence of the PW-01 in that pretext has failed, and"
"no doubt has been created on the evidence of the PW-01."
"The above-mentioned documents as well as the documents marked P-06 and P-"
"06(a) are documents marked and produced by the prosecution at the trial. I am"
"of the view that after failing to study and cross-examine the relevant witnesses"
"on  those  documentary  evidence,  the  appellant  cannot  claim  that  he  had  no"
"opportunity of questioning the witnesses on those matters."
