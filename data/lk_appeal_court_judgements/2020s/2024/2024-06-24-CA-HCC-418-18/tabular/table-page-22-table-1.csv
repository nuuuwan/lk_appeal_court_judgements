"(3) What  is  important  is  whether  the  witness  is  telling  the  truth  on  the"
"material matters concerned with the event."
"(4) Where  evidence  is  generally  reliable  much  importance  should  not  be"
"attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors."
"(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge"
"with  regard  to  the  acceptance  or  rejection  of  testimony  of  a  witness"
"unless it is manifestly wrong."
"In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Anthony 1985 AIR SC 48, the danger"
"of disbelieving an otherwise truthful witness on account of trifling contradictions"
"have been spotlighted. It has been stated that;"
"“The witness should not be disbelieved on account of trivial discrepancies,"
"especially where it is established that there is a substantial reproduction in"
"the testimony of the witness in relation to his evidence before the Magistrate"
"or in the session court and that minor variation in language used by witness"
"should not justify the total rejection of his evidence.”"
"In one of the contradictions pointed out, PW-01 has stated that when he went"
"and met the appellant on the day of the raid, he informed the appellant that he"
"brought  the  Rs.  2500/-,  which  the  appellant  wanted  him  to  bring.  What  the"
"decoy has stated in Court had been that, it was the appellant who asked the PW-"
"01  whether  he  brought  the  money.  It  was  also  pointed  out  that  under  cross-"
"examination,  the  PW-01  has  stated  that  it  was  the  appellant  who  questioned"
"whether the money was brought, to point out that it was different to the earlier"
"stand taken by him. It was also submitted that at one point, it has been stated"
"that  both  of  them  were  asked  to  go  out  by  the  appellant,  but  later  it  was  the"
"decoy who was asked to go out."
"As I have considered before, in a case of this nature where the witnesses have"
"been cross-examined at length, parts of the evidence cannot be considered in its"
"isolation  and  argue  that  contradictions  have  been  created.  What  needs  to  be"
"looked at is the totality of the evidence. If one takes care to look at the evidence"
