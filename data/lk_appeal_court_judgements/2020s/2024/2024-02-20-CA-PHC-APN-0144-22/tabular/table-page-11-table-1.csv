"The  Learned  Magistrate  found  fault  with  the  Petitioner  for  not  calling"
"any other witnesses in support of his claim. This is a clear misdirection"
"against the scope of Section 134 of Evidence Ordinance."
"Section 134 states:"
"“No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required"
"for the proof of any fact”."
"In  the  case  of  Vadivelu  Thevar  Vs.  State  of  Madras  SIR  S  C  614  the"
"Indian Supreme Court observed: -"
"“On a consideration of the relevant authorities and the provisions"
"of the IEA 1872, the following propositions may be safely stated as"
"firmly established:"
"(1) As a general rule, a court can and may act on the testimony of a"
"single  witness 
though  uncorroborated.  One 
credible  witness"
"outweighs 
the 
testimony  of  a  number  of  other  witnesses  of"
"indifferent character."
"(2)  Unless  corroboration  is  insisted  upon  by  statute  courts  should"
"not insist on corroboration except in cases where the nature of the"
"testimony of the single witness itself requires as a rule of prudence,"
"that corroboration should be insisted upon, for example, in the case"
"of a child witness whose evidence is that of an accomplice or of an"
"analogous character. (Emphasis is mine)"
"(3) Whether corroboration of the testimony of a single witness is or"
"is not necessary, must depend upon the facts and circumstances of"
"each  case  and  no  general  rule  can  be  laid  down  in  a  matter  like"
"this  and  much  depends  upon  the  judicial  discretion  of  the  judge"
"before  whom  the  case  comes.  In  view  of  these  considerations,  we"
"have  no  hesitation  in  holding  that  the  contention  that  in  a  murder"
"case, the court should insist upon a plurality of witnesses, is much"
"too  broadly  stated.  Section  134  of 
the 
Indian  Evidence,  has"
"categorically  laid  it  down  that  „no  particular  number  of  witnesses"
