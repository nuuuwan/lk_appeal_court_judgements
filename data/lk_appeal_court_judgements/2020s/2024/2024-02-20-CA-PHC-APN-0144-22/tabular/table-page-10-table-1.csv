"In  Mallawa  Arachchige  Supun  Malhara  v  The  Attorney  General"
"CA(PHC) 09/2015 dated 28.08.2020 the Court held that:"
"“The  Accused  is  not  a  driver  employed  by  the  Appellant;  he  is  a"
"person  doing  business  of  his  own  who  has  access  to  the  vehicle"
"when  requested.  It  is  fair  to  assume  that  the  Appellant  would  not"
"have  expected  the  Accused  to  do  anything  illegal.  This  is  what  is"
"elicited  in  the  evidence  of  the  Appellant.  It  is  quite  apparent  that"
"there is no evidence that the Appellant was privy to the illegal act"
"of the Accused.”"
