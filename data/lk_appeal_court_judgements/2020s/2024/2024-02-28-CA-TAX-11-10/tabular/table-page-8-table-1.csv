"I would like to quote the very statement of Nawaz J at this point:"
"“The Agency Agreement (P2) which is at page 68-76 of the appeal brief is"
"demonstrative of the functions carried on by the Appellant. It shows that the Appellant"
"functioned as an agent of Hattori Seisakusho Co. Ltd, Japan. The Appellant canvassed"
"orders on behalf of the Principal for which the principal agreed to “”remit to the Agent in"
"Sri Lanka the mutually agreed Commission on the realization of the payment in Japan”"
"N
awas J Further held that:"
"“In international trade a Pro-forma Invoice is a preliminary bill of sale sent to"
"buyers in advance of shipment of delivery of goods. Typically, it gives a description of the"
"purchased items and notes the cost along with other important information, such as"
"shipping weight and transport charges. This document gives an indication as to the status"
"o
f
 
the Appellant. This document strengthens the position of the Appellant that he was not"
"acting in any character otherwise than as an agent.”"
"H
is Lordship further held that,"
"“From the foregoing analysis of the transactions and the applicable law it is quite"
"c
l
ear that there is no import on the part of the Appellant. The document p4 at page 61"
"shows that the Appellant charges a commission from the customer for facilitating the"
"opening of the Letter of Credit (items ‘B’ and ‘C’ in p4), Clearing Charges (vide ‘D’,’F’, ‘G’,"
"‘
H
’
,
 
“I’ and ‘J’ in P4 at page 61 of the brief). The Appellant also charges the Customer for"
"transportation and installation (vide: items ‘K’ and ‘L’ in P4). Installation takes place at"
"a
 cost to the customer as under Clause 2(f) of the Agency Agreement the Appellant is"
"entitled to a commission”."
"In Amadeus Lanka (Private) Limited V. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,"
"CA No. CA/TAX/04/2019 decided on 30.07.2021, Sampath K. B. Wijeratne J held:"
"“On a careful consideration of the aforementioned clauses, I am of the view that"
"ALANKA,  with  the  authority  granted  by  AIPL,  provides  its  services  directly  to  the"
"subscribers in Sri Lanka, and the services are utilised within Sri Lanka. On the above"
"analysis of facts, it is my considered view that the TAC has correctly held that ALANKA"
"is an agent of AIPL.”"
"Therefore, it is clear that the Board of Review has misinterpreted the Sole Agency"
"Agreement in their determination that the Appellant was not an agent of the Principal,"
"Page 8 of 12"
