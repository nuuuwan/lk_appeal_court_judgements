"therefore treated as consumed in Sri Lanka and should not be treated as consumed"
"outside Sri Lanka. Hence, those services should not be taxed at zero rate. Therefore, only"
"the commission on sale of machinery overseas and overseas installation charges are"
"treated at zero rate”."
"The Board of Review in their determination dated 12.01.2010 also stated the same:"
"“
 We find from an examination of the document marked Aannexure-1 submitted"
"w
i
th the written submission by the Appellant dated 23.06.2009 discloses that the"
"appellant has acted independently by itself and not as the Agent in the sale of Senvec"
"Colour Sorting machines in Sri Lanka. The Appellant opens letters of credit in its name"
"and all shipping documents such as invoices, bills of lading etc are in the name of"
"Appellant. On arrival of goods in Sri Lanka, the Appellants submits Cus-Decs to the"
"Customs to clear the goods and delivers them to various destinations. Thus it is seen that"
"the services supplied by the Appellant are so directly connected with the goods as a direct"
"i
mporter”"
"Therefore, the Board of Review holds the view that the Appellant did not act as an"
"agent but instead functioned as a principal."
"However, upon examining the Sole Agency Agreement between the Appellant and"
"the Principal, the following facts come to light:"
"Hattori  Seisakusho  Co.  Ltd  of  Japan,  the  foreign  Principal  in  this  case,  is  an"
"established supplier of Colour Sorting Machines and similar machinery. These machines"
"are custom-made to meet their clients' specific requirements, particularly catering to the"
"ultimate user's expectations."
"The  Appellant  Company  is  the  sole  indenting  agent  for  the  Principal’s  Colour"
"Sorting  Machines  in  Sri  Lanka.  In  1996,  the  Appellant  entered  into  a  Sole  Agency"
"Agreement  with  the  Principal,  which  appointed  the  Appellant  as  the  sole  agent  of  the"
"Principal for a period of 10 years. According to Clause 1 of the said agreement, which is"
"available  in  the  brief,  the  Appellant  functioned  as  an  Agent  for  Sales,  Service,  and"
"Maintenance of the Principal’s Senvec Colour Sorting Machines."
