"but rather a principal himself. Accordingly, in answering questions of law Nos. (i) and (ii),"
"we  hold  that  the  Board  of  Review  has  incorrectly  interpreted  the  Appellant  as  the"
"Principal. The Appellant is solely the Agent to the Principal in Japan."
"(
ii)  Whether  the  services  for  which  the  Appellant  received  commission  were"
"consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka"
"The question that needs to be answered in this matter is whether the supply of"
"service made by the Appellant is zero-rated in terms of Section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act, as"
"amended. According to Section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act, the Appellant has to establish that"
"the service provided by the Appellant was consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka."
"In the Appellant’s written submission dated 22/12/2023, specifically in paragraphs"
"31,  32,  and  33,  it  is  stated  that  the  Appellant  functioned  as  an  agent  for  (i)  sales,  (ii)"
"servicing,  and  (iii)  maintenance.  The  Appellant  contends  that  he  received  commission"
"from  the  foreign principal  for  indenting,  promotional  services,  and  market  information"
"provided by the Appellant in relation to the machines. Once the local customer makes a"
"payment, the principal proceeds with  the  order  and  directly  sells  the machinery  to  the"
"customer.  The  foreign  principal  decides  to  export  to  the  local  customer  only  on  the"
"recommendation of the Appellant."
"Clause 2(c) of the Agreement clearly states: “That any orders or enquiries relating"
"to the Agent’s Territory received by the Principal during the currency of the Agreement,"
"will be passed on to the Agent to be dealt with.”"
"As the Appellant has rightly submitted, according to the Sole Agency Agreement,"
"the  direct  supply  of  the  machinery  is  done  by  the  Principal  in  Japan  based  on  the"
"information  provided  by  the  Appellant,  and  thereafter  the  Appellant  receives  the"
"mutually agreed commission if the sale is successful."
"Clause 3(b) of the Agreement states that the service provided by the Appellant to"
"the Principal involves promoting the Principal, taking orders from local customers, and"
"communicating  their  specific  customized  needs  to  the  Principal.  For  clarity,  the  same"
"clause is reproduced as follows:"
