"Conservation and Coastal Resources Management has the power to decide either to carry"
"out an IEE or an EIA or both such reports. Section 16(1) of the Act reads thus,"
"“Upon receipt of an application for a permit to engage in a development activity within"
"the Coastal Zone as required by subsection (3) of section 14, the Director-General may"
"require  the  applicant  to  furnish  an  initial  environmental  examination  report  or  an"
"environmental impact assessment report relating to the development activity as the case"
"may be, or both such reports. It shall be the duty of the applicant to comply with such"
"requirement. Every initial environmental examination report or environmental impact"
"assessment report shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed.”"
