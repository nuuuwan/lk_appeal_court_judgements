"have called an EIA in deciding to issue the permit. This Court in the case of Environmental"
"Foundation Limited Vs. Central Environmental Authority,1 held that;"
"“This court would not substitute its discretion for that of the expert but would interfere"
"with its exercise if it is sought to be exercised in an arbitrary manner or in matters"
"outside  the  limits  of  the  discretionary  authority  conferred  by  the  legislature  or  on"
"considerations  extraneous  to  those  laid  down  by  the  legislature.  Thus,  this  court"
"cannot issue a writ of mandamus directing the first respondent to call for an EIAR in"
"respect  of  the  said  project.  The  discretion  to  call  for  an  EIAR  or  IEER  has  to  be"
"exercised by the first respondent and by the first respondent only. Any clear departure"
"from the objects of the statute is objectionable and renders the act invalid in law”"
