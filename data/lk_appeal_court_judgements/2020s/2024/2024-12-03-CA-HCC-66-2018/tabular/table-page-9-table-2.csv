"1 Somawathie’s evidence on this point."
"18) Finally,  the  witness  claims  to  have  warned  the  deceased  and  asked"
"him to run, when she saw the accused-appellant coming with a pole"
"which the defence has drawn the attention to as an omission in her"
"statement to the Police. Neither does Somawathie distinctly admit this"
"omission, nor, is it proved. Be that as it may, as observed by the trial"
"Judge, there is no omission as to the fact of seeing the Accused armed"
"with  a  pole;  chasing  behind  the  deceased  or  as  to  the  subsequent"
"assault  on  the  head  of  the  deceased.  The  said  statement  had  been"
"made promptly soon after the incident. In narrating this complicated"
"series  of  happenings,  it  is  quite  possible  to  have  not  mentioned  an"
"incidental matter of this nature. Accordingly, the learned Trial Judge"
"has  considered  these  omission  and  contradictions  and  arrived  at  a"
"reasonable and a correct decision to disregard the same. In the above"
"premises  I  am  satisfied  that  the  learned  Trial  Judge’s  decision  to"
"disregard the said contradictions and omission is reasonable correct."
