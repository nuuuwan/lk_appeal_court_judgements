"Conclusion"
"30) It is not the function of the Court of Appeal to retry a prosecution on the"
"facts and indulge in a re-appraisal of the facts. The jurisdiction of the Court"
"of  Appeal  in  hearing  an  appeal  preferred  by  an  accused-appellant  is  to"
"examine the evidence in the case in order to satisfy ourselves that there is"
"evidence  upon  which  the  Jury  or  judge  could  have  reached  the  verdict"
"which they came to and also similarly to examine the charge to the jury or"
"the reasons to satisfy ourselves that there has not been any mis-direction"
"or non-direction. (K v Endoris  - 46 NLR  498 2. Ebert Silva v K  -  52 NLR"
