"family feud involving killings.  To my mind if the enmity was with Nimal"
"in  the  normal  course,  one  would  if  at  all  expect  Nimal  to  be  falsely"
"implicated  and  not  Nimalâ€™s  friend  the  accused-appellant.  Thus,  this  is"
"highly  improbable.  Further  there  is  no  mention  or  suggestion  of  Nimal"
"during  cross  examination.  It  is  in  the  dock  statement  that  Nimal  is"
"mentioned for the first time. This savours of being an afterthought. Thus,"
"the rejection of the Dock statement cannot be assailed. Accordingly, I see"
"no reason in law or otherwise to interfere with the finding of facts of the"
"learned Trial Judge in rejecting the dock statement and there is no merit"
"in this argument advanced on behalf of the Appellant."
