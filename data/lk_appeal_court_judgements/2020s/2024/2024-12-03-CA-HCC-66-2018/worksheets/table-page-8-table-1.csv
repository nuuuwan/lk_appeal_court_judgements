"of the previous incident and minor which in any event does not go"
"the  root  of  the  evidence.  This  previous  incident  involved  several"
"persons  and  PW-1  has  observed  this  somewhat  drawn  out  and"
"protracted 
fracas 
five  years  prior 
to  giving  evidence. 
In  such"
"circumstances, the human frailties and memory lapses due to lapse"
"of time naturally causes such discrepancies. It is settled law that the"
"court  while  appreciating 
the  evidence  must  not  attach  undue"
"importance  to  minor  discrepancies.  The  discrepancies  which  do  not"
"shake the basic version of the prosecution case may be discarded. The"
"discrepancies  which  are  due 
to  normal  errors  of  perception  or"
"observation should not be given importance. The errors due to lapse"
"of memory may be given due allowance. The court by calling into aid"
"its  vast  experience  of  men  and  matters 
in  different  cases  must"
"evaluate the entire material on record by excluding the exaggerated"
"version  given  by  any  witness. When  a  doubt  arises  in  respect  of"
"certain facts alleged by such witness, the proper course is to ignore"
"that fact only unless it goes into the root of the matter so as to demolish"
"the entire prosecution story. The witnesses nowadays go on adding"
"embellishments to their version perhaps for the fear of their testimony"
"being rejected by the court. The courts, however, should not disbelieve"
"the  evidence  of  such  witnesses  altogether 
if  they  are  otherwise"
"trustworthy. ( Appabhai vs. State of Gujarat; 1998 Supp SCC 241)."
"17) The learned Counsel for the Appellant also strongly submitted that"
"there  is  a  serious  contradiction  as  to  the  place  from  which  the"
"witness claims to have first seen the incident; if it was near  Reeta"
"Amma’s house or Nizar’s boutique. Considering this contradiction the"
"witness  had  been  extensively  questioned  on  the  location  and  the"
"setting of the locality. It is apparent that the incident had taken place"
"in a highly populated shanti dwelling area in the city.  Reeta Amma’s"
"residence is in close proximity to Nizar’s boutique. It is clear that she"
"had seen her husband the deceased coming from towards the Nizar’s"
"boutique when she also observed the Accused charging with a pole"
