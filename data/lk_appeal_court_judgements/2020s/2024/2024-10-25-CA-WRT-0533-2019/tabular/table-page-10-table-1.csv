"the Petitioner has not dispensed his burden in establishing a central fact in"
"issue."
"The Court further holds that, under the Industrial Disputes Act, an Arbitrator"
"possesses broad discretionary powers, enabling them to issue orders that are"
"just and equitable, particularly when there is palpable injustice caused to the"
"parties. This authority remains intact even in cases where there has been a"
"delay on the part of the parties. If clear injustice is evident, the Arbitrator is"
"empowered  to  disregard  any  such  delay  and  focus  on  delivering  a  just  and"
"equitable outcome. Therefore, when determining whether laches have caused"
"material  prejudice  to  the  petitioner,  the  Court  will  take  into  account  the"
"Arbitrator's wide discretionary powers. In this instance, the Court finds that"
"no  material  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  Petitioner  due  to  the  alleged"
"laches."
"In  those  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  3rd  Respondent  having"
"scrutinized the oral and documentary evidence placed before him made a just"
"and equitable award in favour of the 4th and 5th Respondents in terms of the"
"provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. I do not see any grounds to review"
"the said award under Article 140 of the Constitution."
"For the foregoing reasons, the Application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs."
"30,000/- payable by the Petitioner to the 4th and 5th Respondents."
"Application dismissed with costs."
