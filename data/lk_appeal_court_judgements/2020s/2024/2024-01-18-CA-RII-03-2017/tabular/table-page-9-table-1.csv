"Vol 1, Section 292-293) stated that “Fraud is not a thing that can"
"stand  even  when  robed  in  a  judgment”.  Vide  also  Maduluwawe"
"Sobitha Thero v. Joslin ([2005] 3 Sri LR 25 at 28)”."
"20. 
There was a duty on behalf of the District Court to ascertain whether"
"the  02nd  respondent  had  the  authority  to  settle  the  case  the  way  it  was"
"done."
"21. 
The  01st 
respondent  argues, 
that,  a 
lawyer 
represented 
the"
"petitioner. Had the petitioner been in this country, even if not physically"
"present in court on that day and had the lawyer upon instructions entered"
"into this settlement the petitioner cannot seek to set it aside successfully"
"because the proxy gives the power to a lawyer to allow a judgment being"
"entered against his client."
"B
ut here the extent of authority given by the proxy is curtailed because"
"the petitioner was not in the country and she was represented by a Power"
"of Attorney Holder whose power was specifically limited."
"I
f a lawyer could freely enter into any settlement that involves his client"
"when  the  latter  is  out  of  the  Island  too  then  there  is  no  requirement  to"
"appoint a Power of Attorney holder."
"B
ut it is a well reconised principle that once the client is not in the island"
"the lawyer cannot represent her only on the proxy where a Special Power"
"of Attorney Holder has been appointed."
"22. 
According to the 01st respondent’s written submission page 05 itself,"
"the petitioner came to know about the settlement on 14.09.2016."
