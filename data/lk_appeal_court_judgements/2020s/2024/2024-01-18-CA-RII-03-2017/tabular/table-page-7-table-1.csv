"16. 
The  02nd 
respondent 
in  his  written 
submissions  dated  04th"
"November 2022 at page 06 et. Seq., submits, that, (i) he had the authority"
"under the Special Power of Attorney to do what he did"
"H
e reproduces the clause,"
"“Also to appear and defend in the case bearing No. L 455 in the"
"District Court of Nawalapitiya and in the Provincial High Court No."
"HCR/49/2010  and  sign  seal  prepare  any  documents  to  these"
"cases on my behalf…”"
"(
ii) the law recognizes the ratification of the act of an agent and (iii)"
"the petitioner is estopped from denying his authority"
"17. 
Hence  neither  the  01st  nor  the  02nd  respondent  say  that  the"
"petitioner  knew  about  the  settlement  dated  11.08.2016  or  that  she"
"consented to the same."
"T
his  shows,  that,  the  petitioner’s  position  that  she  was  unaware  of  the"
"settlement is correct."
"18. 
The words in respect of case No. L 455 “…and sign seal prepare any"
"documents to these cases on my behalf…” is not an authorization to settle"
"the case against the wishes of the petitioner. The petitioner’s wish was"
"to proceed with the case. The settlement is to withdraw the case. The"
"authorization to sign seal and prepare any document was to prosecute the"
"case not to abandon it for considerations of money or otherwise."
