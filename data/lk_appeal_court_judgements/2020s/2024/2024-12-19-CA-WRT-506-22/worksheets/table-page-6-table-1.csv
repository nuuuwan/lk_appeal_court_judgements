"In  any  event,  the  Acting  General  Manager  has  informed  the  Petitioner  by  letter  dated"
"23.02.2022, that a fresh inquiry would be conducted based on the twelve charges against the"
"Petitioner and that if the Petitioner failed to attend the said inquiry, such would proceed ex"
"parte. However, the Petitioner states that he informed his inability to attend such an inquiry"
"to the said Acting General Manager. Thereafter, the inquiry was held on 01.04.2022 and it"
"was  fixed  on  21.04.2022  for  which  the  Petitioner  did  not  participate.  the  Petitioner  states"
"that  by  letter  21.04.2022,  the  Petitioner  was  informed  that  the  tribunal  has  decided  to"
"proceed with the inquiry ex parte."
"In the said case bearing No. CA/Writ/160/22, the Petitioner has challenged the decision to"
"hold  a fresh  inquiry.  By  order  dated  23.11.2023,  the  Court  has  held  that  the  Disciplinary"
"Authority has discretion under Rule 16.4 of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank Rules"
"to quash the decision of the inquiry and order a fresh inquiry. The Court further considered"
"that the Petitioner had failed to appear before the said inquiry despite him being informed."
"Furthermore, the Court formed the opinion that the disciplinary inquiry could be conducted"
"against  retired  officers  and  that  the  conduct  of  the  Petitioner  with  regarding  the  non-"
"participation in the inquiry."
"In  the  instant  application,  the  main  argument  put  forward  by  the  Petitioner  is  that  the"
"findings of the 10th Respondent marked as P29 where the Inquiring Officer has come to the"
"conclusion in the report by not considering the availability of the facts and material placed"
"before him. The main objection taken by the Respondent is that under Section 18.1 of the"
"State Mortgage and Investment Bank Rules marked as R2A the Petitioner has an alternative"
"remedy available to make an appeal to the Appellate Authority."
