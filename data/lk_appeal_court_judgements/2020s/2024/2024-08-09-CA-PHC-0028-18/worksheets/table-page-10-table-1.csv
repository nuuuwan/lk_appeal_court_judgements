"25)","In  the  said  reliefs,  the  present  Appellants  had  only  sought  to  set"
"","aside  the  Order  made  by  the  1st  Respondent  and  had  not  sought"
"","any reliefs against the decision made by the Arbitrator."
"26)","Therefore,  even  if  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  is  granted  to  quash  the  1st"
"","Respondent’s decision, it will not affect the Respondents’ ability  to"
"","proceed  with  the  Magistrate  Court’s  application  to  recover  the"
"","money based on the Arbitrator’s decision."
"27)","Besides  these  facts,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  reiterated  that"
"","there  is  no  ground  that  excessive  jurisdiction  was  used,  that  the"
"","wrong principles were applied, or that principles of natural justice"
"","were violated in making the aforementioned decisions."
"28)","In  observing  the  decision  made  by  the  Arbitrator,  the  Arbitrator"
"","has not violated any of the aforesaid grounds.  The Appellants also"
"","had failed to submit any documents or grounds before the learned"
"","High  Court  Judge  or 
this  court, 
that  demonstrated 
the  4th"
"","Respondent  had  violated  the  aforesaid  grounds  referred  to  by  the"
"","learned High Court Judge."
"29)","To  fortify  the  above  position,  I  relate  an  additional  fact  that  the"
"","Appellants had failed to produce that in a Writ matter, to set aside"
"","an  Order  made  by  an  official,  the  party  challenging  the  decision"
"","made 
should 
show/prove 
that 
the 
said 
official 
had 
acted"
"","unreasonably."
"30)","In the instant appeal or application made before the learned  High"
"","Court  Judge  the  Appellants  had  failed  to  show  that  either  the"
"","Arbitrator  or  the  1st  Respondent  had  acted  unreasonably  in  their"
"","decisions. In the said circumstances I do not see any reason to set"
"","aside the order made by the learned  High Court  Judge  dated 18th"
"","January 2018."
