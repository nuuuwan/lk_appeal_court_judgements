"“A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It"
"cannot be held to be a Writ of right, or one issued as a matter"
"of course. But exercise of this discretion by Court is governed"

"issue a Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order"
"of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled"
"himself

"conduct, like submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay, or"
"waiver.”"
