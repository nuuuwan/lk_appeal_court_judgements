"In  considering  the  aforesaid  analysis,  I  draw  my  attention  to  the"
"decision  made  in  the  case  of  Geeganageh  vs  Director  General"

"""By way of preface, I may say that the arguments put forward"
"by  the  eminent  President's  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  might,"
"perhaps,  have  been  more  acceptably  addressed  to  a  court"
"exercising  appellate  and  not  supervisory 
jurisdiction

judicial 
review  procedure,  a"

the"

"Written submissions. The submissions seem to be oblivious of"
"the  distinction  between  appeal  and  review  procedure.  If  one"
"appeals against a decision, one is claiming that it is wrong, or"
"incorrect."
"The Court of Appeal if it is persuaded of the merits of the case"
"may allow the appeal and so it substitutes its view for that of"
"the court or tribunal of first instance. Under the judicial review"
"procedure  the  court  is  not  concerned  with  the  merits  of  the"
"case, that is, whether the decision is right or wrong. In review"
"(as  opposed  to  appeal)  the  court  only  considers  whether  the"
"decision is lawful or unlawful.‚Äù"
