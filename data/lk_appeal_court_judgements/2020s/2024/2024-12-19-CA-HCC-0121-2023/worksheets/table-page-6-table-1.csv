"14. In  my  view  the  placing  of  this  legal  burden  on  the  accused  is  neither"
"inconsistent nor in conflict with the presumption of innocence as it is not"
"a  shifting  of 
the  burden  of  proof.  Firstly,  when  an  accused  seeks"
"exculpation  or  the  mitigation  expressly  pleading  any  general  or  special"
"exception, he ipso facto necessarily admits the commission of the offence."
"This resulting admission displaces the presumption of innocence. No doubt"
"the burden of proving the charges beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal"
"trial,  is  at  all  times,  with  the  prosecution.  This  is  one  of  the  necessary"
"concomitants  of  the  presumption  of  innocence.  However,  by  virtue  of"
"section  105  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  the  legal  burden  of  proving  any"
"special or general exception is placed upon the accused. This in my view,"
"is not a shifting of the burden of proof. Secondly, even where an accused"
"does not expressly plead any such defence of exculpation or mitigation or"
"to that matter even be it a total denial, and if, sufficient evidence of such"
"defence or exception is otherwise brought in to the record so as to enable a"
"judge  or  jury  to  arrive  at  a 
finding  on  such  issue,  the  it  should  be"
"considered."
