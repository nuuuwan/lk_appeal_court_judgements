"explanation  to  exception  4,  it  is  immaterial  as  to  which  party  offers  the"
"provocation or commits the first assault. The only evidence on this issue"
"comes from the accused himself by way of his dock statement. According"
"to him, it is the deceased who started this fight. Be that as it may, the sum"
"total of this evidence is that the fact of a fight between the two is in evidence."
"They have met by chance, and it appears to be a sudden incident. During"
"the course of this fracas, the deceased has sustained six injuries by a sharp"
"cutting weapon. The eyewitness claims to have not seen any stabbing or a"
"knife  which  he  attributes  to  poor  light,  as  it  was  somewhat  dark  at  that"
"time of the day. Circumstantially, there is a very strong inference that the"
"said injuries were inflicted by the accused and accused alone, and no other."
