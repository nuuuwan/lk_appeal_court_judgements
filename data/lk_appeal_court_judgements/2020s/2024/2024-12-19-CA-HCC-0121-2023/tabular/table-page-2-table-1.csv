"1.  When this matter was taken up for argument on 27.11.2024, the learned"
"Additional  Solicitor  General,  Mr.  Shanil  Kularatna,  PC.,  conceded  that"
"there is evidence to reduce the conviction to one of culpable homicide not"
"amounting to murder, on the basis of exception 4 to section 294 (sudden"
"fight).  Ms.  Indika  Mallawarachchi,  Attorney-at-Law,  appearing  for  the"
"accused-appellant (hereinafter also referred to as the appellant) submitted"
"that  if  the  conviction  for  murder  is  reduced,  to  culpable  homicide  not"
"amounting to murder, the appellant would mainly make submissions on"
"the sentence. Thus, it is common ground that there is evidence of a sudden"
"fight emanating from the prosecution evidence and the conviction can be"
"reduced. Both parties made submissions on this aspect as well as on the"
"sentence."
