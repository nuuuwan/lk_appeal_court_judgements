"16. The  evidence  of  the  sudden  fight  emanates  mainly  from  the  eyewitness"
"PW-03  Thushara  Pradeep  Kumara  and  then  from  the  dock  statement  to"
"some extent. At this juncture, it necessary to briefly set out the facts of this"
"case.  The  accused,  Lakshman,  is  a  labourer  who  had  been  on  and  off"
"engaged by the deceased Pradeep Kumara. Pradeep Kumara was a mason"
"by profession. On the fateful day, the accused appears to have gone out to"
"work  elsewhere,  and  around  6:00  p.m.,  gone  to  a  boutique  where  he"
"happened  to  meet  the  accused.  The  deceased  had  been  annoyed  and"
"unhappy about the accused going to work elsewhere. An exchange of words"
"and a crosstalk had led to ‘a fight,’ which had then led to an exchange of"
"blows between the two. At one point, the accused had pushed the deceased"
"and left the scene. The witness, and others who were there had seen the"
"deceased  falling  and  found  him  with  bleeding  injuries.  The  accused  had"
"been apprehended by the Police late that night. A knife had been recovered"
"on  Section 27 statement, and the Government Analyst has confirmed the"
"presence of human blood. These, broadly, are the facts emanating from the"
"evidence."
