"positions which the accused may be convicted for. This is a duty cast upon"
"the judge even if the Defence has not expressly relied upon or taken up"
"any such defence. It was so opined in King vs. Bellana Withanage Eddin"
"(41 NLR 345), where the Court of Criminal Appeal held thus; “In a charge"
"of  murder,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  judge  to  put  to  the  jury,  the  alternative  of"
"finding  the  accused  guilty  of  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder"
"when there is any basis for such a finding in the evidence of record, although"
"such defence was not raised nor relied upon by the accused.”"
