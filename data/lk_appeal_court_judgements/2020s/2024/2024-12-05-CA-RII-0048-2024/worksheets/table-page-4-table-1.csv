"As the petitioner has the right of appeal against the impugned judgment, we"
"are not inclined to grant relief to the petitioner in this application.  However,"
"we note that the petitioner’s application is dismissed for that reason and not"
"because there is no  merit in the petitioner’s application.  We  make no order"
"for costs."
