"In Sana v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SLR 48 the court held that:"
"â€œ(1)  The  corroborative  facts  and  evidence  must  proceed  from someone"
"other than the witness to be corroborated. This means that his previous"
"statements, even when admissible cannot be used to corroborate him,"
"such  as  proof  of  a  complaint  in  a  sexual  case  or  a  previous  act  of"
"identification  is  not  corroborative  of  the  evidence  of  die  witness,  even"
"though  by  showing  consistency,  it  can  to  some  extent  strengthen  his"
"credibility."
"Where an accused is charged with rape corroboration of the story of the"
"prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not from the"
"prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to the police in"
"which she implicated the accused cannot be regarded as corroboration"
"of her evidence."
