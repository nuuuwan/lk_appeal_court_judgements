"Accordingly,  the  revision  application  has  been  dismissed.  It  is  against  this"
"judgement and the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota; the appellant"
"has preferred this appeal."
"Having considered the relevant facts and  the circumstances,  and the law that"
"led to the order of the  learned Magistrate, it is the view of this  Court that the"
"learned  Magistrate  has  followed  the  correct  procedure  when  deciding  to  order"
"the appellant to pay the value of the bond he executed. It is clear from the case"
"record that it had been the appellant who has taken charge of the vehicle after"
"signing the bail bond for a value of one million rupees."
"When  he  was  required  to  produce  the  vehicle  for  the  purposes  of  the  inquiry,"
"initially he has attempted to mislead the Court, making use of a situation that"
"existed then by saying that it was not he who got the vehicle released, but the"
"finance company who had a finance leasing agreement in relation to the vehicle."
"Upon inquiry, it has been established that it was not so, and it was the appellant"
"who got the vehicle released based on a bond of Rs. one million."
"It has also been established that the vehicle in question was a vehicle used in"
"several occasions previously in committing similar offences, which may be the"
"very reason why the appellant has disposed of the vehicle after getting it released"
"on a bond."
"As the appellant has failed to produce the vehicle as required for the purpose of"
"the inquiry, the learned Magistrate had no option but to order the appellant to"
"pay the agreed sum mentioned in the bail bond. The learned High Court Judge"
"after having considered the relevant facts, circumstances and the law has come"
"to a correct finding in that regard."
