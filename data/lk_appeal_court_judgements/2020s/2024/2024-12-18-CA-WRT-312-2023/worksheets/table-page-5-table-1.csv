"the issue on forfeiture should be canvassed in the Labour Tribunal therefore, requested the"
"Respondents to direct the 5th Respondent to file an application in the Labour Tribunal."
"The Petitioner states that several correspondences were exchanged between the Petitioner"
"and the Respondents among which the letter dated 04.03.2020 marked P16(d) sent by the 4th"
"Respondent notified the Petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs. 281,385/- as gratuity payable"
"to  the  5th  Respondent.  Further,  to  the  utter  dismay  of  the  Petitioner,  by  letter  dated"
"10.11.2022  marked  as  P2,  the  2nd  Respondent  conveyed  its  decision  that  the  1st  to  4th"
"Respondents have the jurisdiction to conduct the said inquiry. Further, it was held that the"
"forfeiture of gratuity of the 5th Respondent is wrongful, therefore, the 1st to 4th Respondents"
"would resort to legal actions against the Petitioner. Thereafter, the Res issued a Certificate"
"dated  20.01.2023  in  terms  of  Section  8(1)  of  the  said  Act  to  the  Learned  magistrate  of"
"Welisara.  The  Learned  Magistrate  of  Welisara  issued  summons  against  the  Petitioner  for"
"bearing Case No. 7536/23 requiring the Petitioner to appear before the Court for the alleged"
"non-payment of gratuity on 09.05.2023."
"The main gravamen of the Petitioner is that the decision contained in the documents marked"
"as P2 and P16(d) is illegal and ultra vires."
"In this  context,  the  Petitioner  invokes  the  writ  jurisdiction of  this  Court seeking  a  writ  of"
"Certiorari to quash the decision contained in the documents marked as P2 and P16(d) on the"
"basis  that  since  the  5th  Respondent  was  terminated  for  misappropriation  of  funds  of  the"
"employer and particular gratuity was forfeited by the Petitioner."
"Before going into the questions of law, this Court focuses on what basis gratuity is awarded"
"as broadly discussed in several judicial pronouncements."
