"of  charity.  They  are  given  in  order  to  make  the  employees  more  contented  and  to"
"enable them to have a sense of satisfaction and security without being always on the"
"brink  of  insecurity  about  their future…..  However,  long  and faithful or meritorious"
"service is a condition precedent to the award of gratuity; for, gratuity still remains a"
"reward for faithful service rendered for a fairly substantial period.”"
