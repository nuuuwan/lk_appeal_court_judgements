"The
contention of
the
learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel
for
the Petitioner
is"
"that
the
Petitioner,
Director
General
of
the
Southern
Provincial"
"Development Authority (SPDA),
is not deemed to be a Public Officer or"
"does not fall under the category of the Provincial Public Service, and the"
"Governor or
the Public Service Commission has no power whatsoever,"
"regarding
the
appointment,
transfer,
termination,
interdiction
or"
"disciplinary control regarding the said post.
In terms of the provisions of"
"the SPDA Statute No. 01 of 1995,
the 1st Respondent, SPDA is vested"
"with disciplinary control over the Petitioner. Hence, the said interdiction"
"and
further
steps
taken
thereafter
by
the Governor
are
ultra-vires,"
"arbitrary, unfair, capricious, unreasonable and irrational."
"The contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the"
"Respondents is that
the Southern Provincial Council stood dissolved on"
"01.04.2019 and the Office of
the Chief Minister of
the Province became"
"defunct.
The Board
of Management
of
the
1st
Respondent was
not"
"constituted and there was no subject Minister assigned to oversee the 1st"
"Respondent Authority.
In this scenario, under Articles 154C and 154F of"
"the Constitution of
the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,
the"
"Governor
is
empowered to issue
the
letter of
interdiction (P22)
to the"
"Petitioner. However,
the
learned DSG submitted
that
the
impugned"
"charge
sheet
(P27) was
issued under
the Authority
of
the Board of"
"Management of the 1st Respondent."
"Moreover, the learned DSG took up the position that under Article 125 of"
"the Constitution, the legal
issue of whether the Governor was empowered"
"to issue the letter of
interdiction under Articles 154C and 154F of
the"
"Constitution is to be referred to the Supreme Court and this Court has"
"no jurisdiction to determine the said question of law."
