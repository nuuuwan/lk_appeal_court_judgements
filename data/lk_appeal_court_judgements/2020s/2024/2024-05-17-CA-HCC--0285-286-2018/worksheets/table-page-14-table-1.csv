"In Nuwan de Silva v The Attorney General [2005] 1 SLR 2004, the accused"
"was arrested and remanded with four others. After about 10 days of remand"
"the accused wished to make a confession to the Magistrate who recorded the"
"confession  under  section  127  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  (the"
"Code)  after  giving  the  accused  numerous  opportunities  to  consider  the"
"matter.  The  Magistrate  satisfied  herself  that  the  confession  was  voluntary"
"and not vitiated by any inducement, threat or promise. At a voir dire inquiry,"
"the  High  Court  was  satisfied  about  the  voluntary  nature  (validity)  of  the"
"confession and admitted it in evidence."
"The accused told the Magistrate that he had a love affair with a girl but as"
"he  had  no  job  the  marriage  was  objected  to.  This  was  the  motive  for"
"kidnapping the boy (on his experience of what he had watched on television),"
"to obtain quick money as ransom. He enticed the boy to his grandmother's"
"house by offering birds' feathers and telephoned the boy's father Jayantha"
"de Silva. As the boy was next to the accused at the time, the accused closed"
"his nose and mouth and took him to a room where the boy fainted. Believing"
"that the boy had died, the accused strangled the boy until he really was dead"
"and dumped him in the cess pit having placed the body in a fertilizer bag."
