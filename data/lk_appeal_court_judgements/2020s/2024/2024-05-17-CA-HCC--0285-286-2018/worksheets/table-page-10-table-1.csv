"circumstantial evidence from 1-21 to come to her conclusion that the facts"
"so  established  were  only  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  of  guilt  of  the"
"Appellants."
"The prosecution is bound to exclude the involvement of a third party if there"
"was positive evidence of an identified third partyâ€™s involvement in crime. In"
"this case the prosecution had very correctly led all evidence pertaining to the"
"crime and there is no doubt caused as to the involvement of the Appellants."
"The Learned High Court Judge had held the Appellants guilty for the 1st and"
"2nd  charges  after  giving  plausible  reasons  having  examined  the  evidence"
"presented."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  her  judgment  correctly  analysed  the"
"credibility the witnesses to come to her decision. Further, she had the unique"
"advantage  of  observing  demeanour  and  deportment  of  all  the  witnesses."
"Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had failed"
"to analyse credibility of the prosecution witnesses."
