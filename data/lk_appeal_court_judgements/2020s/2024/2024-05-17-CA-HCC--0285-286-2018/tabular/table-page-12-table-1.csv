"prosecution.  Therefore,  the  credibility  of  PW1’s  evidence  is  not  affected  as"
"correctly decided by the Learned High Court Judge."
"Both the Appellants complain that the defence evidence was not considered"
"in the correct perspective and rejected the same on wrong premise."
"As  correctly  pointed  out  by  the  Learned  Additional  Solicitor  General,  the"
"Learned High Court Judge has in the course of her judgment reproduced the"
"dock statement of both Appellants in verbatim. She has also referred to two"
"authorities  on  admissibility  of  dock  statement  in  a  criminal  trial.  At  the"
"conclusion  of  analysis,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  disbelieved  the"
"defence and accepted the prosecution’s version."
"Both the Appellants in their respective arguments have taken up the position"
"that after their arrest they were brought to deceased’s house, taken inside"
"and made them walk inside the house. According to PW13, the Appellants"
"were  arrested  at  Ja-Ela  after  three  days  of  the  incident  and  brought  to"
"deceased’s house on the day of her funeral to recover certain items under"
"Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"Although the Appellant had taken up the position that they were taken inside"
"the  house  and  made  them  to  walk  inside  the  house  after  their  arrest,  the"
"officers from the Fingerprint Department had visited the place of incident on"
"the  date  of  incident  at  about  10.00pm  and  photographed  the  foot  prints,"
"palm and finger from the scene of crime. Even they had photographed the"
"deceased  who  was  fallen  in  a  fool  of  blood.  All  photographs  were  marked"
"during the trial and the photographs bear the date as 07.06.2009."
"The Counsel for the 2nd Appellant brought to the notice of the Court that the"
"indictment was not read over to her after it was served on her."
"According to the journal entry dated 10.10.2017 the indictment was served"
"to  the  2nd  Appellant  on  that  day.  On  09.07.2018  the  Counsel  for  the  2nd"
