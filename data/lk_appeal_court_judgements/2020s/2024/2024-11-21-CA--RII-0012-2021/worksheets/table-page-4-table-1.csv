"(1)  Section  48(3)  of  the  Partition  Law  overrides  section  44  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance; accordingly, even a judgment obtained by fraud or collusion would"
"have the final and conclusive effect provided by section 48(1). Held further:"
"(2) It is to be noted that the plaintiff-respondent failed to disclose the name of"
"the  petitioner  who  has  title  to  the  entire  land.  The  failure  to  make  a  correct"
"declaration  under  section  12(1)  of  the  Partition  Law  amounts  to  a  procedural"
"irregularity which results in a miscarriage of justice."
