"officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection"
"of the evidence as a whole.‚Äù"
"It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  of  both  PW-02  and  PW-16  that  the  place  of  the"
"incident  was  well  lit  even  though  the  incident  has  occurred  around  midnight."
"There had been no dispute that the appellants were well known to the witnesses"
"as they are fellow villages. There had been no allegation that the two eyewitnesses"
"had any animosity towards the appellants or had any reason to say something"
"they did not witness."
"It was also not a disputed fact that, both the witnesses did not come out  and"
"informed the police that they are eyewitnesses to the incident at the initial stages"
"of the investigations. In fact, PW- 02 has given a statement to the police on the"
"day  of  the  incident  itself  and  has  stated  that  he  did  not  see  the  crime  being"
"committed. It was after two- or three-days PW- 02 has made a 2nd statement to"
"the police stating that he was an eye-witness to the incident and as to what he"
"saw.  PW-16  has  also  come  forward  as  an  eyewitness  several  days  after  the"
"incident."
"Therefore, the fact that both of them are somewhat belated witnesses, has to be"
"considered in deciding whether their belatedness has been sufficiently explained"
"before the Court, and that can be accepted."
"PW-02 has explained his reasons as to why he did not tell the police in his initial"
"statement that he was an eyewitness by stating that the two appellants told him"
"not to divulge what happened and he was fearful for his life because the accused"
"were not arrested when the initial statement was made. He has explained further"
"stating that, his fellow villagers persuaded him to come out with the truth if he"
"saw the incident and that was the reason that he came forward later and gave"
"his 2nd statement."
