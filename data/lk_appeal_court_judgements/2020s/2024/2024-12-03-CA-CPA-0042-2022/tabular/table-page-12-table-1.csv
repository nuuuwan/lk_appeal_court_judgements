"himself at the time of the transaction concerned which he is questioned. The"
"witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and"
"read by the witness within the time of the transaction or soon afterwards"
"concerning the matter he is questioned. It is also necessary that the Court"
"must consider that it is likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in"
"the  memory  of 
the  witness.  So, 
the  memory  could  be  refreshed-with"
"reference to some contemporaneous document prepared by the witness by"
"himself  or  made  by  any  other  person  which  the  witness  had  occasion  to"
"read. Generally, this right is being exercised by expert witnesses such as a"
"doctor  who  gives  evidence  touching  the  post  mortem  certificate  or  wound"
"certificate prepared by him. A commissioner deputed by the court can also"
"refresh his memory at the time of giving evidence by referring to the report"
"contemporaneously prepared by him. But this special privilege given to the"
"witnesses  under  S.159  of  the  Evidence  Act  cannot  be  made  use  of  by  a"
"witness in a criminal case to refresh his memory by referring to his earlier"
"statement given to the police under S.161 Cr. P. C. This is because S.162 of"
"the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  specifically  states 
that 
the  statement"
"recorded  by  the  police  officer  under  S.161  could  only  be  used  for  certain"
"specific purposes. Proviso to S.162 Cr. P. C. reads as follows:"
"â€œProvided that when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry"
"or  trial  whose  statement  has  been  reduced-into  writing,  any  part  of  his"
"statement,  if  duly  proved,  may  be  used  by  the  accused,  and  with  the"
"permission  of  the  Court,  by  prosecution,  to  contradict  such  witness  in  the"
"manner provided by S.145 of the Indian Evidence Act; and when any party"
"of  such  statement  is  so  used,  any  part  thereof  may  also  be  used  in  the"
"reexamination of such witness, but for the purpose only of explaining any"
"matter referred to in his cross-examination."
"There are series of decisions to the effect that a statement recorded under"
"S.161 Cr. P. C. is not admissible in evidence. Such statement could only be"
"used to contradict the maker of the statement as envisaged under S.145 of"
