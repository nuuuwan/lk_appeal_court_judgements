"Although I do not find any meaning in the order made by the learned High Court"
"Judge,  it  appears  from  the  proceedings  of  05-10-2021,  the  case  has  been"
"adjourned on the above basis."
"Thereafter,  PW-01  has  been  recalled  to  give  further  evidence  on  13-01-2022."
"While giving evidence for the 2nd time, she has maintained the same position she"
"took  on  the  1st  day  as  to  what  she  saw  when  she  came  to  the  scene  of  the"
"incident.  This  has  led  to  the  learned  State  Counsel  who  prosecuted  putting"
"several questions to her warning that if the witness states something contrary to"
"the statement she made to police, which amounts to giving false evidence, she"
"will  be  prosecuted  by  the  Hon.  Attorney  General  in  that  regard,  and  she  may"
"have to face a jail term and the State will take steps to initiate proceedings in"
"future."
"The way the learned prosecuting State Counsel addressed her own witness had"
"led to the defence Counsel objecting for any questioning of that nature on the"
"basis that it amounts to intimidating the witness."
"The  learned  prosecuting  State  Counsel  has  maintained  the  position  that  her"
"questioning does not amount to intimidation and the prosecution has a right to"
"initiate proceedings against a witness for giving false evidence."
"This has led to the  1st order pronounced by the  learned High Court Judge on"
"that day, marked as P-02, along with the petition, which appears as a part of the"
"certified copy of the High Court brief."
"For  matters  of  clarity,  I  will  now  reproduce  the  said  order  marked  P-2,  which"
"reads thus."
