"with the factum probandum beyond reasonable doubt, and must be such"
"as to lead to a reasonable inference as to the guilt of the accused."
"Rule 2: The party who asserts the existence of any fact from which legal"
"responsibility  is  to  be  drawn  must  prove  that  fact,  but  sometimes  the"
"circumstances may create a counter-obligation to disprove what is proved."
"Rule 3: In all cases, whether of direct or circumstantial evidence, the best"
"evidence  must  be  adduced.  The  suppression  or  non-production  of"
"pertinent  or  cogent  evidence  necessarily  raises  a  strong  presumption"
"against the party who withholds such evidence. This rule applies a fortiori"
"to circumstantial evidence which has its own inherent defects."
"Rule 4: The chain or strand of proved facts and circumstances must be"
"complete that no link in it is missing. If any vital factor which is necessary"
"to make the chain or strand is missing, or has remained unproved, it must"
"be held that the prosecution has failed to establish the case. A vital link"
"should never be inferred."
"Rule  5: In order to satisfy the inference of guilt, the inculpatory factors"
"must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of"
"explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of guilt. In"
"other words, the proved facts and the circumstances of the case must in"
"cumulative and total effect, lead irresistibly and unmistakably to the only"
"conclusion that the accused is guilty of the offence of which he is accused."
