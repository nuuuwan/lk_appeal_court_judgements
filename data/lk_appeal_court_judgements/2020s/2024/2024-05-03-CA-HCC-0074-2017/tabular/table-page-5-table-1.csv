"Around 6.00 p.m., he has heard about a murder and had gone to the place where"

"three-wheeler nearby. According to his evidence, he was arrested because he too"

"was taken up for trial, and the prosecution has marked his deposition before the"
"Magistrateâ€™s Court at the non-summary inquiry held in this regard in terms of"
"section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance."

"has prevented him from going near the person. The witness has instructed the"
"appellant to take the person to the hospital. Thereafter, the appellant has gone"
"near the person and had lifted him from his armpits and had taken him towards"
"the cemetery. The witness has not seen any blood on the body of the person, but"
