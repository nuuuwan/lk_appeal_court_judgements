"the appellant who was with the deceased around an hour before his body was"
"found."
"In fact, the evidence of PW-02 which has been admitted by the appellant shows"
"that when PW-02 saw the deceased, he had been collapsed on the paddy filed a"
"little distance away from where PW-02 was. The appellant has told him that he"
"and the deceased had liquor together and the deceased was vomiting blood, for"
"which the advice of PW-02 had been to take him to the hospital. The evidence"
"shows that it was the  appellant  who lifted the deceased from his armpits and"
"took him away to the place where the deceasedâ€™s body was found dead later."
"According to the evidence of PW-09 Sumith, when he got into the three-wheeler,"
"the appellant had something similar to a knife wrapped in a newspaper. Most of"
"the injuries observed by the JMO on the body of the deceased had been grievous"
"cut  injuries.  Although  the  witness  from  whom  the  appellant  has  borrowed  a"
"manna  knife  on  the  same  day  promising  him  that  he  would  return  it  in  the"
"afternoon,  has  failed  to  identify  the  knife  at  the  trial,  that  does  not  mean  the"
"relevant circumstantial evidence cannot be accepted against the appellant."
"The evidence placed before the trial Court has established that the appellant had"
"left his native village soon after the incident and he has been arrested one and a"
"half months later. The appellant has admitted that he left the village and stayed"
"in a temple in Beliatta area in the Southern Province, which was a place far away"
"from his usual residence."
"Having  considered  the  circumstantial  evidence  placed  before  the  trial  Court"
"against the appellant, I find that the only inference that can be drawn from the"
"evidence would be that it was the appellant who committed the murder and no"
"one else."
"I find no basis for the argument of the  learned Counsel  for the  appellant that"
"there was a possibility of a 3rd party being involved in the crime, given the fact"
"that  there  was  no  such  possibility.  According  to  the  deposition  of  PW-02,  the"
"deceased has been seen on a possible unconscious state and it was the appellant"
