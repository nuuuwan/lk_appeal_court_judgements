"It  is  an  admitted  fact  that  the  initial  complaint  by  the  prosecutrix  was  of"
"harassment  and  was  not  of  rape.  Accordingly,  police  have  summoned  both"
"parties and has settled the matter."
"The  prosecutrix  has  explained  the  reasoning  behind  making  a  complaint  of"
"harassment initially, stating that she was ashamed of what happened and since"
"she was living alone in her home and also because of the death threats made to"
"her  by  the  appellant  she  only  complaint  about  harassments  by  the  appellant"
"believing that it would stop him from further harassing her."
"However, it appears that subsequent to the settlement, the family members of"
"the appellant have threatened the prosecutrix and her family of legal action on"
"the basis that she caused insult to their family. This has led to her making the"
"second complaint, giving in detail what happened at the hands of the appellant."
"The evidence of the neighbour clearly establishes  the fact that the prosecutrix"
"has gone and informed her that the appellant came to her house while she was"
"washing her pots and pans and forced her inside the house. Although she has"
"not given much detail, the evidence of the prosecutrix is clear that she has been"
"reluctant  to  come  out  as  to  what  really  happened  due  to  the  factors  I  have"
"considered before. Even to her own daughter, she has been reluctant to inform"
"what happened."
"It  appears  that  although  the  daughter  was  made  to  understand  what  really"
"happened, she has gone along with the prosecutrix’s  intention not to pursue the"
"matter for various obvious reasons."
"When considering the evidence in its totality, I am of the view that, the victim’s"
"initial reaction to the incident can be justified given the facts and circumstances"
"unique to this case."
