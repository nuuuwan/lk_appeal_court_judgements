"the victim or any member of the family had a strained relationship with"
"the appellant or any member of his family is totally unacceptable.‚Äù"
"I  would  like  to  express  similar  sentiments  in  relation  to  the  evidence  of  the"
"prosecutrix  in  this  case  as  well.  There  is  no  probability  of  her  making  a  false"
"allegation of rape given her age and the relevant facts and circumstances, and"
"the stigma attached to such a thing becoming common knowledge."
"Another  matter  raised  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  was  that,  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  evidence  not  available  on  record  in"
"favor of the prosecution."
"He referred to what had been stated by the learned High Court Judge at page 04"
"of the judgment (page 117 of the appeal brief) to the effect that the evidence of"
"PW-02, who was the neighbour of the victim, and also that of PW-04 the daughter"
"of the victim, has corroborated the evidence of victim to argue that none of the"
"witnesses have come out with the fact that they were told about the incident of"
"rape by the victim."
"However, the careful scrutiny of the judgment shows that, the determination had"
"not been that the victim told them that she was raped."
"It was the evidence of PW-02, that although the victim did not tell her that she"
"was  raped,  she  told  her  that  the  appellant  came  and  dragged  her  inside  the"
"house. The daughter of the victim has been informed by the victim that she was"
"harassed  and  had  come  out  with  the  incident  of  rape  later.  The  learned  High"
"Court Judge has considered their evidence only in that context and nothing else."
