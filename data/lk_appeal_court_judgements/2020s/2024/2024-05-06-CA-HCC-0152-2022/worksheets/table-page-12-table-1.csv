"In the case of Bandara Vs. The State (2001) 2 SLR 63 it was held that;"
"“If there is a valid reason or explanation for the delay and if the trial judge"
"is  satisfied  with  the  reasons  and  the  explanations  given,  no  trial  judge"
"would  apply  the  test  of  spontaneity  and  contemporaneity  and  reject  the"
"testimony of a witness in such circumstances. Delayed witnesses’ evidence"
"could be acted upon if there were reasons to explain the delay…"
"Discrepancies  and  inconsistencies,  which  do  not  relate  to  the  core  of  the"
"prosecution case ought to be disregarded, especially when all probabilities"
"factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by a witness.”"
