"The Respondents have produced the IGPâ€™s Circular dated 13.12.2022 marked as 1R1"
"which increased the number of days to 21 days the combined allowance was paid. The"
"contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners with that regard is that"
"increasing the number of days from 14 days to 21 days by the said Circular marked as"
"1R1 itself establishes that the Petitioners and, the police officers in general are entitled"
"to the increased combined allowance. In the Circular marked as 1R1, it has been stated"
"that the number of days has been increased to 21 days pursuant to a Cabinet decision"
"dated  12.09.2022.  Likewise,  the  Cabinet  decision  marked  as  P16  makes  the  letter"
"marked as P8(a) futile and P16 also will be futile after the Circular marked as 1R1 came"
"into operation pursuant to the Cabinet decision dated 12.09.2022. As a result, P17 and"
"P18  also  become  futile  for  the  reason  that  those  two  documents  were  based  on  the"
"Cabinet decision marked as P16. It is the view of this Court that even though the number"
"of days has been reduced to 14 days from 24 days by the Cabinet decision marked as"
"P16, there had been no reduction of the combined allowance paid to the Petitioners but"
"it has been increased. As discussed above, the Cabinet Decision marked  as P16, the"
"documents marked as P17 and P18 are neither irrational nor unreasonable. Therefore,"
