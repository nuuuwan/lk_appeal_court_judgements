"(11th edn.) defines the concept of legitimate expectation in the following manner;"
"“Where  some  boon  or  benefit  has  been  promised  by  an  official  (or  has  been"
"regularly granted by the official  in similar circumstances), that boon or benefit"
"may be legitimately expected by those who have placed their trust in the promises"
"of  the  officials.  It  would  be  unfair  to  dash  those  expectations  without  at  least"
"granting the person affected an opportunity to show the official why his discretion"
"should be exercised in a way that fulfil his expectations. Hence there has developed"
"a doctrine of the protection of legitimate expectation”"
