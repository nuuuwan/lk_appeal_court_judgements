"Respondent requested the Secretary to the Treasury (the 33rd Respondent) to release"
"funds  for  the  payment  of  the  increased  combined  allowance.  However,  by  the  letter"
"dated 23.10.2018 marked as P14, the 31st Respondent informed the 32nd Respondent"
"that even though the Treasury has given approval to increase the combined allowance,"
"it was not sanctioned by the Cabinet of Ministers. By the Cabinet Memorandum dated"
"28.01.2019 (marked as P15), the Minister of Finance (the 6th Respondent) proposed to"
"the Cabinet to pay the combined allowance to the police officers in terms of the Circular"
"marked as P11 only for 14 days. That proposal was approved by the Cabinet as reflected"
"on the letter dated 14.02.2019 marked as P16 issued by the Secretary to the Cabinet of"
"Ministers (the 35th Respondent). Thereafter, the IGP issued the letter dated 02.05.2019"
"(marked as P17) stating that the combined allowance to the police officers would be"
"paid  as  per  the  Cabinet  decision  marked  as  P16  and  the  Circular  dated  10.05.2019"
"(marked as P18) setting out the basis of calculating it for the police officers who serve"
"other than in the North and East areas."
"The Petitioners state that the combined allowance was paid for 24 days per month for"
"officers who serve in  non-operational  areas and  30 days per month for officers who"
"serve in the North and East areas from the year 2014 up to December 2018 (P14(a))."
"The argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that the decision"
"to reduce the combined allowance for 14 days as reflected in P16, P17 and P18 is ultra"
"vires,  unreasonable,  irrational,  violation  of  their  legitimate  expectation  and  natural"
"justice and the number of days the combined allowance should be paid is not a question"
