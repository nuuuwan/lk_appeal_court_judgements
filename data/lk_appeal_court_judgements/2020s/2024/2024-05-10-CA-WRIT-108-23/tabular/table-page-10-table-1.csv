"I  like  to  refer  the  observation  made  in    Perera  v.  National  Police  Commission  and  24"
"Others, SC (FR) Application No. 290/2006, Decided on 03.07.2007, 2007 BLR 14 at page"
"17 Shirani A. Bandaranayake,J held as she was then:"
"Examining the decisions in Schmidt (supra) and Attorney- General for New South Wales"
"v. Quin [(1990) 170 C.L.R 1], P. P. Craig (Legitimate Expectations, A Conceptual Analysis,"
"L.Q.R.  [(1992)  108  pg.  79]  had  observed  the  applicability  of  the  concept  of  legitimate"
"expectation in administrative decisions and had stated that,"
"""The  foundation  of  the  applicant's  procedural  rights  is  not  simply  that  he  has  some"
"legitimate expectation of natural justice or fairness. The basis of the applicant's claim to"
"protection is that he has a legitimate expectation of an ultimate benefit which is in all the"
"circumstances  felt  to  warrant  the  protection  of  that  procedure,  in  his  instance  his"
"continued presence in the country."""
"Thus  it  is  apparent  that,  as  observed  by  David  Foules  (supra),  a  promise  or  a  regular"
"procedure could give rise to a legitimate expectation that could be enforced by court. This"
"position is clearly illustrated by the decisions in Attorney General of Hong Kong vs. Ng"
"Tuen Shiu [(1983) 2 AU.E.R. 346] and Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the"
"Civil Service [(1984) 3 All E.R. 935}."
"According to the Petitioner, he was eligible for promotion after 20.09.2017. He was duly"
"recommended to be promoted as Captain. But the decision of the 1st Respondent stating"
"that he is not eligible to be promoted for the position of captain as he has committed an"
"offence namely moral turpitude which was ultra vires."
"Considering the above facts we hold that the decision taken by the 1st Respondent in P17"
"and P33 are ultra vires. Therefore we quash both the decisions according to the prayer"
"(c) and (e) of the petition.  Although in his prayer he has asked for a writ of mandamus"
"directing the 1st respondent to confirm the Petitioner in the rank of captain with effect"
"from 20.12.2014. But in his petition, he admits in paragraphs 17 and 18 that due to the"
"punishment, he lost the opportunity of being considered for promotion for one year from"
"effect  till  20.09.2017.  Therefore  there  is  confusion  with  regards  to  his  promotion  date."
"Therefore we direct the 1st Respondent to consider his promotion to the rank of Captain"
"with effect from 20.12.2017. Thereafter if he is eligible for the rank of Temporary Major"
"under the said circular recommend him to that post."
