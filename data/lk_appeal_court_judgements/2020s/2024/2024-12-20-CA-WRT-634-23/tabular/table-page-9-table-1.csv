"The Petitioner has failed to submit to this Court the gazette notification which referred"
"the  dispute  for  arbitration  which  would  have  demonstrated  the  date  on  which  the"
"arbitration  was  referred.  The  Petitioner  has  failed  to  address  this  Court  on  the  most"
"important question of whether the arbitration, at the time of referral, was a live dispute"
"or not. This becomes one of the most crucial questions that should have been addressed"
"as it is one of the grounds the arbitrator upheld, and especially when in the order it is"
"determined that there is no live dispute. In our view by not submitting the said gazette"
"and by failing to address the said issue, the Petitioner has suppressed material facts to"
"this  Court,  and  suppression  of  material  facts  disentitles  the  Petitioner  to  the  reliefs"
"sought."
