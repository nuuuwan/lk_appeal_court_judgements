"Petitioner  had  failed  to  establish  any  grounds  that  warrant  judicial  review  and  have"
"challenged  the  Petitioner’s  right/entitlement  to  obtain  any  reliefs  prayed  for  in  the"
"Petition. Also, the Petitioner’s failure to bring in necessary parties."
"T
he Petitioner’s main contention is that an arbitrator who is appointed under Section"
"4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act should act under Section 17(1) of the Act and should"
"endeavor to make all such inquiries into the dispute and make a just and equitable order."
"It is her contention that the arbitrator should not have dismissed the arbitration on the"
"grounds referred to, but fell short of suggesting that the arbitrator should have given an"
"adjournment. However, it is contended that dismissal of the action without giving notice"
"to the Petitioner was unreasonable."
"T
his  Court  observes  that  other  than  the  Petitioner’s  contention  that  the  arbitrator"
"dismissed the application without notice, the Petitioner has failed to impugn the decision"
"on any other grounds. The learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents brought"
"to  the  attention  of  the  Court  the  document  marked  as  P7,  the  appointment  of  the"
"arbitrator by the Ministry. This Court observes as per paragraph 3, the arbitrator is given"
"the  power  to  use  his  discretion  and  to  make  an  order  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the"
"Industrial Disputes Act. The said paragraph states as follows:"
"“Furthermore, in the event of failure to participate in the inquiry of either party"
"without a reasonable cause, after having been informed to be present and ready"
"for  the  inquiry  on  the  scheduled  time,  you  have  the  discretion  to  conduct  the"
"inquiry unilaterally and make an order in terms of the Industrial Disputes Act.”"
"T
he  circumstances  of  the  case  are  that  all  parties  had  been  present  and  the  date  in"
"question was requested by the applicant. As borne out by the proceedings, at the end of"
"the applicant’s evidence the word “conclude” appears. As per paragraph 3 of the letter"
"of appointment, the arbitrator then has the discretion to conduct the inquiry unilaterally"
"and make an order according to the Industrial Disputes Act. In a situation where the"
"applicant is not present, is unrepresented, and has not given a reason for her absence,"
"the arbitrator could have acted under the paragraph mentioned above. However, in this"
"instance, the Respondents have moved for dismissal on several grounds. Section 17(1)"
"of the Act deals with the duties and powers of the arbitrator. In enduring to answer a"
"dispute referred to the arbitrator, the arbitrator has to make all such endeavors to hear"
"the necessary evidence to arrive at conclusions to the points referred for arbitration. In"
"obtaining the relevant evidence, the arbitrator should not be confined to the Petitioner’s"
"case but the arbitrator is also required to hear the evidence of the Respondents."
