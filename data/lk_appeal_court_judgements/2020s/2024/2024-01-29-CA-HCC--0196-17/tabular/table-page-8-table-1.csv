"Although at the non-summary inquiry PW1 had said that Farook’s son hit"
"his  son  on  his  head,  but  he  had  not  mentioned  it  in  his  statement  to  the"
"police. This also brought to the attention as an omission."
"PW1, in his statement to police had stated that his son was attacked by 1st"
"Appellant  and  one  Nazim  with  swords  and  the  others  hit  him  when  the"
"deceased fell down. At his cross examination PW1 had stated that he did not"
"see whether the others hit son. This contradiction was marked as 1V2."
"Further, the evidence given by PW1 contradicts with the evidence given by"
"PW2, Shiffa, the sister of the deceased on material points. Contradictory to"
"PW1 that he fell in the courtyard, PW2 stated that PW1 had fell inside the"
"house. This contradiction was marked as 1V4. PW2 went on to say that she"
"did  not  know  that  her  father  fainted  which  is  also  contradictory  to  the"
"evidence of PW1."
"PW3, Sameen, in his evidence stated that the deceased was resting on the"
"lap of his aunt till the vehicle arrived to take him to hospital but at the cross-"
"examination  states  that  the  deceased  was  resting  on  his  sister’s  lap.  This"
"contradiction was marked as V6."
"In the contradiction marked V7, PW3 had stated that he was the only person"
"in the van when the deceased was taken to hospital. But his evidence he had"
"said that several people were in the van when the deceased was taken to the"
"Bandaragama  Hospital.  Further,  he  had  contradicted  his  position  that  4"
"people  went  in  the  ambulance  that  took  the  deceased  to  the  Panadura"
"Hospital from the Bandaragama Hospital in cross examination by saying that"
"there were only 3 people including the driver, himself, and another person."
"This contradiction was marked as V8."
"The facts set out by the prosecution may not be accurate or even they can"
"be crooked, but in this background the tool of contradiction and omission"
"are very effective to shake or shatter the credibility of prosecution evidence."
"Proof of contradiction and omissions though is very useful in criminal trials,"
