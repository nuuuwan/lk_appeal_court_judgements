"evidence led at the trial."

"01 was married, and a mother of a child during the time relevant to this incident."
"On the day of the incident, her husband had been away, and she has gone to the"
"Gramasewaka’s office of the area  to obtain a letter from him. She has left the"
"Gramasewaka’s office around 12 noon in order to get back to her house. Without"
"taking  the  normal  route,  she  has  taken  a  shortcut  footpath  through  a  rubber"
"plantation in the area."
"While  she  was  walking  through  the  plantation,  she  has  seen  two    persons"
"standing on the footpath, one of them being the appellant. He was holding a rock"
"in his hand and both of them were unknown to her."
"When she was passing them, the appellant has called her ‘අක්කක්’ and had come"
"and grabbed her. He has dragged her while covering her mouth with his hand."
"She has been dragged towards a ditch on the land. Although she has attempted"
"to escape, her attempts had failed."
"The other person who was with the appellant has done nothing, but had covered"
"himself  behind  rubber  trees.  After  dragging  the  victim  towards  the  ditch,  the"
"appellant has lifted her clothes, removed her panty, and has forcibly committed"
"sexual  intercourse  on  her.  She  has  stated  further,  that  the  perpetrator  only"
"removed her panty up to her knee, and committed rape on her."
"Although she has shouted seeking help, no one has come. However, her evidence"
"has been that there were no houses nearby and there was nobody in the houses"
"situated some distance away at the time of the incident."
