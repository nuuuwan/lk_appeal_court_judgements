"The prosecution has called PW-11, the Officer in Charge (OIC) of Crimes Division"
"of Nittambuwa Police during the time relevant to this incident."
"According to his evidence, PW-01 had come to the police station on 03-07-2003"
"at 16.10 hours in a highly shocked state, and had informed that she was raped."
"The OIC has directed a female sub-inspector to record her statement and had"
"immediately proceeded with the victim to inquire into the matter. The victim has"
"shown him the place of the incident and he has observed a disturbance in the"
"grass in the place shown by the victim. He has observed that the place was a"
"rubber plantation. The house of the victim had been about 500 meters away from"
"the place of the incident."
"After the inspection, he has gone with the victim to her house,  and had taken"
"over the garments she was wearing as productions. Thereafter, the victim had"
"been admitted to the hospital. He has identified the productions marked P-01,"
"P-02,  and  P-03  as  the  clothes  the  victim  was  wearing  when  she  came  and"
"complained to the police about the rape."
"During his investigations, he has come to know about the suspect involved in"
"the incident, namely the appellant, but had been unable to arrest him. According"
"to him, the appellant has been arrested some days later during the night."
"He has denied the suggestion by the defence that after the arrest, the appellant"
"was kept at the police station in a manner others can see him. It had been the"
"evidence  of  the  OIC  that  since  the  appellant  was  due  to  be  produced  for  an"
"identification parade, he was kept properly concealed and produced before the"
"Magistrate’s Court for that purpose under similar care."
"The police officer who arrested the appellant, namely PW-14 has testified that"
"the appellant was arrested at 02.15 a.m. in the morning of 04-07-2003."
"The  defence  has  admitted  that  after  the  arrest,  the  appellant’s  statement  was"
"recorded at 9.40 am on 04-07-2003."
