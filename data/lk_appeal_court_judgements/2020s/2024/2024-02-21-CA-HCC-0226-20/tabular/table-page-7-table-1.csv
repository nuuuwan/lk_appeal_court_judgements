"years of age when the police arrested him for this offence, and was sleeping at"
"his home he has claimed that he had no opportunity of raping the victim. He has"
"also  claimed  that  the  police  officers  assaulted  him  and  forced  him  to  sign  a"
"statement."
"The Grounds of Appeal"
"At the hearing of this appeal, the learned President’s Counsel who represented"
"the appellant formulated 2 grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court."
"1.  The evidence led in the case was solely based on leading questions put"
"to the witness and the weight that could be attached to such evidence"
"is highly questionable."
"2.  The  identification  of  the  accused  was  based  on  totally  unsatisfactory"
"evidence and the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the"
"evidence in its correct perspective."
"Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal"
"As the learned President’s Counsel has taken up two grounds of appeal which"
"are distinct from each other, I will now proceed to consider the said grounds of"
"appeal separately."
"The 1st Ground of Appeal:-"
"The submission of the learned President’s Counsel was that the prosecution has"
"extracted evidence from the victim in a manner unacceptable in a criminal trial."
"It was his submission that this amounts to a denial of a fair trial towards the"
"appellant."
"However, I am in no position to agree that the manner in which the prosecution"
"led the victim’s evidence had caused any prejudice towards the appellant."
"In her evidence, after describing the manner she was dragged towards a ditch in"
"the rubber plantation, when she was asked what happened to her, she has stated"
"that it was him, meaning the appellant and no one else."
