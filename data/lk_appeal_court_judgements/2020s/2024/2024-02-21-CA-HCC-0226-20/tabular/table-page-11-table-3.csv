"persons in a crowd or in a fleeting moment. To apply the Turnbull principles,"
"the identification had to be made under difficult circumstances. In this case,"
"although the incident took place during night, there was ample light shed by"
"the bulb of  the lamppost  that  was burning. There  was no congregation of"
"multitude  of  persons  in  a  crowd  but  only  the  accused  appellant  and  the"
