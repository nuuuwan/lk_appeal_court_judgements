"the 
Defendant 
Petitioner 
agreed 
to 
vacate 
the 
premises 
by"
"31.12.2016without any damages. However the Defendant Petitioner after"
"occupying  the  subject  matterof  this  action  for  [the]  last  5  to  6  years  is"
"now  claiming  money  to  vacate  premises,  which  isentirely  unreasonable"
"and  unjust.  It 
is  respectfully  submitted  that  to  set  aside  the  terms"
"ofsettlement is purely an after thought of the Defendant Petitioner, since"
"the terms entered [are] not a ""profitable set of terms"". (paragraph 11)"
"In  this  Court  as  well  as  in  the  District  Court,  the  respondents  have  cited  the"
"case  of  Lameer  vs.  Senarathne  decided  in  1995  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  by"
"Ranaraja  J.,  (S.  N.  Silva  P/C.A.  –  later  Chief  Justice)  concurring,  in  which  it"
"was said, that,"
"“1.  When  an  Attorney-at-Law  is  given  a  general  Authority  to  settle  or"
"compromise  a  case,  client  cannot  seek  to  set  aside  a  settlement  so"

"forced into accepting the terms of settlement. Pleadings indicate that the"
"settlement  was 
first  suggested  on  21.6.1991  and  entered  only  on"
"13.7.1991.”"
"Hence,  that  was  a  case 
in  which  the  petitioner  was  allegedly 
forced 
into"
"accepting a settlement."
"Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest in this case, that, the Attorney at Law"
"was given a general authority to settle. The petitioner alleges that he agreed to"
"vacate  the  premises  on  his  belief  that  he  will  be  paid  Rs.  500,000/- 
in"
"consideration of the same, which he later found our to be a mistaken belief."
"Hence  the  ratio,  if  there  is  any,  in  Lameer’s  case  cannot  be  employed  in  this"
"case in toto. Furthermore I do not, with respect, agree what is in 1 above, that,"
"once  general  authority  is  given  to  an  Attorney  at  Law  that  amounts  to  the"
"crossing  of  the  Rubicon
