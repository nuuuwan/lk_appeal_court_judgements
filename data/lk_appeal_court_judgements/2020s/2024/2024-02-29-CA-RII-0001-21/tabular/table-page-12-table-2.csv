"memorandum 
in  writing  of  such  motion  shall  be  at 
the  same 
time"
"delivered to the court."
"Section  408  of 
the  civil  procedure  code  requires 
the  parties 
to  notify 
the"
"agreement, or compromise to court by motion and section 91 of the code requires"
"that  a  memorandum  in  writing  of  every  motion  should  be  delivered  to  court  at"
"the time it is made. The procedure adopted in this case in the District Court at the"
"time  the  settlement  was  recorded  does  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  section"
"408â€¦."
"That shows that the written terms of settlement were not before court at the time"
"the  settlement  was  recorded  and 
the  parties  had  not 
tendered 
to  court  a"
"memorandum in writing containing the terms of settlement. Therefore even if the"
"consent  given  by  the  counsel  for  the  Plaintiff  Petitioner  to  include  the  disputed"
"additional  condition  into  the  terms  of  settlement  had  not  been  vitiated  by  a"
"mistake of fact the consent decree entered in terms of that arrangement will not"
"attract the finality  given to the decree passed under section  408 of the code. As"
"stated by Basnayake CJ in Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera 62 NLR 413 ""Where a"
"statute provides special machinery which if resorted to renders a decree final, the"
"finality  prescribed  in  the  Act  does  not  attach  to  a  decree  unless  there  is  a  clear"
"manifestation of a conscious intension of the parties to resort to that machinery"
"with  a  knowledge  of  the  consequences  it  involves  and  there  has  been  a  strict"
"compliance with the requirements of the statute."" Parties to this case had not"
"complied with the imperative requirements of section 408 of the civil"
"procedure  code  and  therefore  the  consent  decree  entered 
in  the"
"District  Court  will  not  attract  the  finality  given  to  decrees  passed"
"under  the  section  408  of  the  civil  procedure  code.  Therefore  this"
"settlement can be set aside on that ground alone."
