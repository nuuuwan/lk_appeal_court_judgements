"(viii) 
an informal document dated 29.12.2010 was written"
"(ix) 
the petitioner paid Rs. 50,000/- to the plaintiffs"
"No  doubt  that  the  informal  writing  conveys  no  right  title  or  interest  as  per"
"section 02 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance of 1840. But it can be taken"
"into  account  in  considering  the  claim  in  reconvention  together  with  what  the"
"petitioner now says, that, he expected the payment of Rs. 500,000/- to him as"
"a  condition 
in 
the  purported  settlement. 
It  should  have  been 
taken 
into"
"account,  before 
the  petitionerâ€™s  grievance  was  summarily  dealt  with  and"
"rejected by all the courts below on technical or non technical grounds."
"There was no reason for the petitioner to agree to a settlement or a compromise"
"without a clause that enables him to receive the above sum."
"HenceI must say what Justice Weerasooriya said in the above case with slight"
"modification."
"I  would  allow  the  appeal  of  the  [defendant  petitioner]  with  costs.  The  decree"
"entered in terms of the [purported] settlement is vacated and the case [is] sent"
"back  for  the  trial  to  be  proceeded  with  according  to  law.  [The  petitioner  is"
"entitled to] [a]ll costs so far incurred in [this Court and the Courts] below. This"
"order  will  not,  however,  preclude  the  parties 
from  arriving  at  any 
lawful"
"adjustment  or  compromise  of  the  action,  if  they  so  desire,  and  notifying  the"
"same  to  Court  in  terms  of  section  408  [and  section  91]  of  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code. [The modifications are within square brackets]"
