"Further, it is observed that the age of retirement of the 2nd Respondent has been"
"amended in several instances, i.e. by Circulars marked X2, X3 and X4.  Although"
"the Respondents state that Circular X2 on which the Respondents rely upon was"
"issued  following  the  consultations  with  the  employees,  they  have  failed  to"
"demonstrate or produce any documentary evidence to the effect that there had"
"been any consultations and /or negotiations with the Bank prior to the issuance"
"of X2 and X4 also."
"Although the employees' union informed the Petitioner Bank to resort to legal"
"actions to resolve the matter, it appears that Circular X3 has not been quashed or"
"rescinded  as  of  this  date.  Mere  protest  or  disagreement  expressed  by  the"
"Employee’s Union would not render Circular X3 ineffective or legally invalid. At"
"this point, it is important to observe the reference which appears in Circular X3"
"“Please treat our Circular No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19th September 2008 [X2] as"
"rescinded” which exhibits the stance of the Petitioner Bank. Accordingly, without"
"formal or authorized cancellation of X3, no effect would be given to the former"
"Circular X2."

"for  nearly  15  years  before  an  appropriate  forum  since  its  implementation  in"

"employees'  concerns  regarding  retirement  age  as  per  Circular  X3  is  the  letter"
"marked  R2(1)  dated  24.05.2011.  By  the  said  letter,  the  employee’s  union  had"
"requested the Petitioner Bank to make arrangements to make the retirement age"
"of the Bank 57 years in line with the Public Administration Circular. I am of the"
"view that such correspondence would not render the Circular X3 invalid."
"In any case, regardless of whether there is any acceptance or agreement between"
"the  parties  in  respect  of  Circular  X3,  the  1st  Respondent  cannot  arrive  at  the"
"conclusion that the said Circular X3 is invalid without the same being declared"
"null and void by a competent court of law. Under such circumstances, this Court"
"is not inclined to accept the 1st Respondent’s decision that Circular X3 is not a"
"legally valid document on the grounds relied upon by him."

"The 1st Respondent Commissioner has come to a conclusion that the services of"
