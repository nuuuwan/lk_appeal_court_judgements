"years on the 19th of April 2016. At the time when 2nd Respondent reached the age"
"of  55  years,  the  existing  Circular  applicable  on  the  age  of  retirement  of  the"
"employees of the Petitioner Bank was Circular X3. As per Circular X3, the age of"
"retirement was set as 55 years giving effect to the relevant Public Administration"
"Circular. Further, Circular X3 stipulates that extensions would be granted to the"
"employees annually until they reach the age of 57 years subject to evaluation of"
"performances and the discretion of the Management. The extension for highly"
"skilled employees who could not be easily replaced and who will contribute to"
"the bottom line directly could be granted annually until they reach the age of 60"
"years.  Further,  Circular  X3  expressly  rescinded Circular  X2  by which  the  age  of"
"retirement  was  extended  to  the  age  of  58  years.  Therefore,  the  Petitioner"
"contends that the 2nd Respondent ceased to be an employee of the Petitioner"
"Bank upon reaching the age of 55 years as per Circular X3 and no termination of"
"services had occurred."
"Public Administration Circular"
"The  Respondents  argue  that  Circular  X3  does  not  determine  the  Petitioner’s"
"retirement age for several reasons. The Respondents point out that Circular X3"
"was introduced to the Petitioner Bank  to give effect to a Public Administration"
"Circular  and  was 
issued  unilaterally  by  the  Petitioner  without  consulting  or"
"obtaining consent from the employees. It is stated that the Public Administration"
"Circulars do not apply to the Petitioner Bank."
"Though 
the  2nd  Respondent  has 
taken  up 
the  position 
that 
the  Public"
"Administration Circulars  do not apply to the  Petitioner Bank, it is  significant to"
"observe the employee’s union has taken a contrary stand and has requested the"
"Bank  to  act  in  line  with  another  Public  Administration  Circular  by  letter  R2(1)."
"However, the Petitioner Bank conceded that being a private sector Bank it need"
"not be guided by Public Administration Circulars issued from time to time and the"
"decision to give effect to Public Administration Circular by Circular X3 does not"
"necessarily create a precedent. Accordingly, it is apparent that the Petitioner Bank"
"has  refused  to  change  the  age  of  retirement  as  specified  in  Circular  X3  and"
"decided 
to  continue 
the  age  of  retirement  at  55  years.  As  a  result, 
the"
"effectiveness of the Circular X3 remains unchanged. The 2nd Respondent in his"
"Written Submissions states that ‘ the series of circulars issued by the Petitioner"
"Bank,  particularly  X2  Circular,  clearly 
indicates  that  the  2nd  Respondent  was"
"entitled  to  continue  his  employment  until  the  age  of  58,  following  established"
