"It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or"
"commits the first assault."
"The way the learned High Court Judge has considered evidence shows that there"
"had been a quarrel between the deceased, the appellants and some others. This"
"has resulted in the deceased being attacked after the appellants got hold of the"
"knife the deceased was carrying at the time of the incident. The injuries caused"
"to the deceased shows that the said injuries have not been caused in a cruel or"
"unusual  manner,  but  as  a  result  of  a  sudden  fight  in  the  heat  of  passion."
"Therefore, it is my view that when sentencing the appellants, the relevant facts"
"and  the  circumstances  should  have  been  considered  in  order  to  determine"
"whether sentencing of the appellants should be in terms of limb 1 or limb 2 of"
"section 297."
"In  this  regard,  I  would  like  to  cite  the  judgment  pronounced  by  the  Indian"
"Supreme  Court,  which  considered  the  applicability  of  exceptions  stated  in"
"section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, which is the corresponding provision to"
"section  294  of  our  Penal  Code.  In  the  case  of  Jai  Prakash  Vs.  State  (Delhi"
"Administration) 1991 SCR (1) 202."
