"in arrival at a conclusion whether the offence is culpable homicide or murder."

"The language of Clause Thirdly of  Section 300 speaks of intention at two"
"places  and  in  each  the  sequence  is  to  be  established  by  the  prosecution"
"before 
the  Court 
that 
it  can 
fall 
in 
that  Clause.  The 
‘intention’  and"
"‘knowledge’ of the accused are subjective and invisible states of mind and"
"their  existence  has  to  be  gathered  from  the  circumstances,  such  as  the"
"weapon  used,  the  ferocity  of  attack,  multiplicity  of  injuries  and  all  other"
"surrounding  circumstances.  The  framers of  the  Code  designedly  used  the"
"words ‘intention’ and ‘knowledge’ and it is accepted that the knowledge of"
"the consequences which may result in doing an act is not the same thing as"
"the intention that such consequences should ensue. Firstly, when an act is"
"done by a person, it is presumed that he, must have been aware that certain"
"specified harmful consequences would or could follow. But the knowledge"
"is  bare  awareness  and  not 
the  same 
thing  as 
‘intention’ 
that  such"
"consequences  should  ensue.  As  compared 
to 
‘knowledge,’ 
‘intention’"
"requires  something  more  than  the  mere  foresight  of  the  consequences,"
"namely the purposely doing of a thing to achieve a particular end. [211H-"
"212C]"
"‘Knowledge’  as  contrasted  with 
‘intention’  signify  a  state  of  mental"
"realization  with  the  bare  state  of  conscious  awareness  of  certain  facts  in"
"which  human  mind 
remains  supine  or 
inactive.  On 
the  other  hand,"
"‘intension’ is a conscious state in which mental faculties are aroused into"
"actively and summoned into action for the purpose of achieving a conceived"
"end. [213B-C]”"
