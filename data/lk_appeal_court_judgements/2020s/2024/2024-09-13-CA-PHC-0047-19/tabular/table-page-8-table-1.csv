"20)","Further,  on  page  No.08  paragraph  03,  the  Magistrate  had  stated"
"","that a copy of the notice to quit was  filed in the  Magistrate  Court"
"","record and had considered the Provision related to Section 3(3) of"
"","the State Land Recovery Act, which specifically states as follows;"
"","“A quit notice in respect of any State land shall be"
"","deemed 
to  have  been  served  on 
the  person 
in"
"","possession  or  occupation  thereof  if  such  notice  is"
"","sent by registered post.”"
"21)","As  per 
the  aforesaid  section 
there 
is  no  requirement 
for  any"
"","authority to produce a receipt to show the notice to quit receipt of"
"","the  registered  postal  article  on  which  the  said  notice  to  quit  was"
"","served."
"22)","The  next  issue  raised  before  the  High  Court  Judge  was  that  the"
"","Learned Magistrate  had not considered  the deeds pertinent  to the"
"","disputed land.  The Learned High Court Judge had considered the"
"","said fact and decided that the Appellant had not proven his rights"
"","for the land to be acquired before the Magistrate. And the Learned"
"","Magistrate  had  correctly  assessed  the  rights  of  the  parties  and"
"","decided the land referred to in the schedule of the plaint is not the"
"","same land,  referred  to in the Appellant’s deeds marked before the"
"","Magistrate’s Court."
"23)","In  view  of  the  aforesaid  facts,  I  do  not  have  to  consider  further"
"","proof  of  the  Appellant’s  rights  for  the  land  in  question.    It  is  a"
"","matter for which the Appellant should take the necessary steps in"
"","a  different  forum  to  prove  that  the  specific  area  referred  to  in  his"
"","deeds 
is 
included 
in 
the  schedule  of 
the  plaint 
filed  by 
the"
"","Respondent in the Magistrate’s Court application."
"24)","On the said grounds, my considered view is that the Learned High"
"","Court  Judge  had  thoroughly  considered  the  facts  pertinent  to  the"
"","Order  made  by  the  Magistrate’s  Court  and  decided  that  there  are"
"","8"
