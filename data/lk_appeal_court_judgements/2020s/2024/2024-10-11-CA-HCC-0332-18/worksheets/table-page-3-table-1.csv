"PW2, PW4, and PW09 and marked productions P1 to P7 and Z in support of"
"their  case.  The  Government  Analystâ€™s  qualifications  were  admitted  under"
"Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979."
"When  the  defence  was  called,  the  Appellant  had  given  evidence  from  the"
"witness box and called four witnesses to provide evidence on his behalf and"
"moved for further time to call more witnesses. Due to an unforeseen incident,"
"this matter came before a new judge on 02.12.2004. On that day the defence"
"Counsel  made  an  application  for  a  trial  de  novo.  The  application  was"
"accepted  and  a  trial  de  novo  was  ordered.  When  this  matter  came  before"
"another judge on 07.06.2005, the same de novo application was made by the"
"appellant and amidst great resistance from the prosecution the learned High"
"Court Judge holding in favour of the Appellant, ordered a de novo trial and"
"all prosecution  witnesses were  summoned. Hence, a new trial commenced"
"on 09.11.2005."
"After leading the evidence of PW1, PW2, and PW4, the prosecution made an"

"evidence in the first trial before the learned High Court Judge (deceased). As"
"the defence did not object, it was decided to adopt only the evidence given by"
"PW9 in the first trial. After closing of the prosecution, the defence was called"
"and the learned Counsel for the defence filed a list of witnesses amounting"
"to about 11 witnesses. As several witnesses out of the 11 had already given"
"evidence in the first trial, the Counsel for the Appellant made an application"
"to  adopt  their  evidence  too.  The  application  was  allowed  and  summons"
"issued only against the remaining witnesses in the defence list."
"When the Appellant gave evidence, he stated that he was not arrested with"
"Heroin  as  contended  but  was  arrested  at  his  residence.  At  that  point,  the"
"learned High Court Judge misunderstanding that the Appellant was going to"
"raise  the  defence  of  alibi,  disallowed  the  evidence  that  the  Appellant  was"
"arrested  at  his  residence.  Due  to  this  order,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Appellant  informed  the  Court  that  he  was  unable  to  call  the  remaining"
"witnesses  without  leading  evidence  that  the  Appellant  was  arrested  at  his"
