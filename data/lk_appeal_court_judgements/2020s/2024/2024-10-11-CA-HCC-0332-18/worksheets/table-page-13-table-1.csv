"In the final ground of appeal, the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel contended that"
"by disallowing the Appellant to be represented and defended by a counsel,"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  deprived  the  Appellant  of  the  benefit  of  the"
"outcome  in  CA  (PHC)  APN  116/2010  and  thus  permitted  the  previous"
"erroneous order pertaining to alibi to remain."
"In  this  case  two  erroneous  orders  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"caused  great  prejudice  to  the  Appellant.  The  first  erroneous  order  was"
"rectified  by  this  Court  under  case  No.  CA/PHC/APN  116/2010.  But  the"
"Appellant  was  deprived  of  the  representation  of  a  Counsel  in  his  absence"
"which  had  not  only  caused  great  prejudice  to  the  Appellant  but  had  also"
"denied him a fair trial."
"To determine whether an accused is innocent or guilty, the concept of fair"
"trial plays a vital role. A fair trial is a universally recognised human right."
"Fair trials help establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a"
"case.  It  is  a  cornerstone  of  democracy,  helping  to  ensure  fair  and  just"
"societies."
"Guided  by  the  above  cited  judicial  decisions,  I  conclude  that  the  appeal"
"grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant  has  a  very  serious  impact  on  the"
"prosecution case."
"Now I consider whether this is an appropriate case to be sent for a re-trial. A"
"re-trial is a second (or further) trial on the same issues with the same parties."
"It  is  not  treated  as  an  extension  of  the  first  trial,  as  new  evidence  can  be"
"called."
"In this case the date of offence is 04.07.2000. The prosecution witnesses and"
"the  defence  had  given  evidence  twice.  Further,  more  than  24  years  had"
"passed since the alleged incident. Therefore, this is not an appropriate case"
"to send for re-trial."
