"quash  the  order  made  by  learned  High  Court  Judge  on  11.05.2010.  After"
"hearing both the sides, His Lordship P/CA held that:"
"“Learned  Senior  State  Counsel  who  appears  for  the  Attorney  General"
"contends that due process and ends of justice would be best served if this"
"matter  goes  back  to  the  High  Court  for  the  evidence  that  had  been"
"excluded, to be led afresh and the trial concluded to a finish, for the reason"
"that the same evidence had been permitted at the previous trial in 2004"
"and that can be considered as a notice given to the prosecution of the case"
"that the accused was seeking to present at his trial."
"Learned  Counsel  for  the  accused-petitioner  also  submits  that  he  has  no"
"objection to the adoption of the entire prosecution evidence that had been"
"led  up  to  the  point  of  the  conclusion  of  the  prosecution  case.  He  further"
"submits that the defence evidence at the further trial would focus mostly"
"on items of evidence that were excluded by the trial Judge."
"In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that the order made by the"
"learned High Court Judge dated 11.05.2010 (P2) should be set aside and"
"the matter is sent back for further trial.”"
