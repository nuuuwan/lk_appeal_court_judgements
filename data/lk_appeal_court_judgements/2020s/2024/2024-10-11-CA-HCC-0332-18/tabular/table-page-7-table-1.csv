"In  the  Attorney-General  v.  Rawther  25  NLR  385,  Ennis,  J.  states  thus:"
"[1987} 1 SLR 155"
"""The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence."
"His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his"
"guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt”."
"In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:"
"“the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in"
"a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is"
"well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of"
"probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond"
"the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it"
"admitted  fanciful  possibilities  to  deflect  the  course  of  justice.  If  the"
"evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility"
"in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, “of course it is"
"possible,  but  not  in  the  least  probable,”  the  case  is  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice”."
"In the first ground of appeal the learned President’s Counsel contended that"
"refusing an application made under Section 241(2) of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure  Act  is  wrong  and  the  Appellant  is  deprived  a  statutory  right,"
"thereby denied a fair trial."
"Section 241(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states:"
"The commencement or continuation of  a trial under this section, shall"
"not be deed or construed to affect or prejudice the right of such person"
"to be defended by an attorney-at-law at such trial."
"In Mohamed Buhary Mohamed Asmin v Attorney General CA/240/2010"
"decided on 09.10.2014 the Court held that:"
"“As per Section 241 (2) of the Code, it is very clear that the commencement"
"or  continuance  of  the  trial  under  this  Section  shall  not  be  deemed  or"
