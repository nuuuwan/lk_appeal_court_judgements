"grave and very serious. In these circumstances, he argued that there is a grave violation of"
"the rules of natural justice, and on this ground alone, the report and the findings should"
"be quashed."
"In  my  considered  view  that  former  President  Gotabhaya  Rajapaksha  had  appointed  a"
"Special  Presidential  Commission  by  Gazette  Notification  2212/53  dated  29.01.2021"
"appointing  a  Special  Commission  of  Inquiry  to  look  into  whether  the  observations  and"
"recommendations  contained  in the  report P6 of  the  1st to  3rd Respondents  were  legally"
"binding and had merit. The words used in the mandate at paragraph 1, inter alia, are as"
"follows;"
"""... to further investigate and report whether the above malpractices have done"
"and what extent are the respondents so responsible, and to recommend whether"
"a person should be subjected to a community disability according to the provisions"
"of  Article  81  of  the  Constitution  and  Section  9  of  the  Special  Presidential"
"Commission of Inquiry Act (Special Provisions) Act No 4 of 1978."""
"Therefore, it is clear that the recommendations of the 1st to 3rd Respondents could not be"
"given effect to until the Special Presidential Commission appointed by the President had"
"gone into the contents of the said report and made their own recommendations as to the"
"validity and legality of giving effect to the Report of the 1st to 3rd Respondents and after"
"further investigation making their independent recommendation of the course of action"
"that needs to be adopted in this regard."
