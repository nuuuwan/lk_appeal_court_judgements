"At the  same  page the  learned  writers  have  also referred  to  the  dicta  of Lord Diplock  in"
"Regina vs. Commission for Racial Equality ex parte Hillingdon LBC [1982] A. C. 779 where"
"Lord Diplock said,"
"“Where an Act of Parliament confers upon an administrative body functions which"
"involve  its  making  decisions  which  affect  to  their  detriment  the  rights  of  other"
"persons or  curtail  their  liberty to  do  as  they  please,  there  is  a  presumption  that"
"Parliament intended that the administrative body should act fairly towards those"
"persons who will be affected by their decision”."
