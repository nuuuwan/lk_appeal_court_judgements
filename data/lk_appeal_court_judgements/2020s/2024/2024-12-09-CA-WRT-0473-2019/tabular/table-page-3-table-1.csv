"In  P.  S.  BUS  CO.,  LTD.,  Vs.  MEMBERS  AND  SECRETARY  OF  CEYLON"
"TRANSPORT BOARD.2 It was held that;"
"“A  prerogative  writ  is  not  issued  as  a  matter  of  course  and  it  is  in  the"
"discretion of Court to refuse to grant it if the facts and circumstances are"
"such as to warrant a refusal. A writ, for instance, will not issue where it"
"would be vexatious or futile.”"
"Be  that  as  it  may,  the  Petitioner  is  challenging  the  said  Quit  Notice  on  the"
"basis  that  she  is  in  possession  of  the  subject  matter  as  a  lessee.  As  such,"
"there is no impediment for the Petitioner to invoke the Civil jurisdiction of a"
"District Court to obtain relief. It is provided under Sections 12 and 13 of the"
"said Act, that even after the execution of the writ, the Petitioner is entitled to"
"seek remedies in a civil court."
"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the instant application is liable to be"
"dismissed. Thus, the application is dismissed. No costs."
