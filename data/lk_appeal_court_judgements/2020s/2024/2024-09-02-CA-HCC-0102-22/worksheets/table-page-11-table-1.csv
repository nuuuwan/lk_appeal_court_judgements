"Accordingly, I find merit in the 1st ground of appeal as to the way the  learned"
"High Court Judge has considered the earlier mentioned evidence."
"However, it needs to be noted that this is a matter where the  prosecution has"
"relied on several pieces of circumstantial evidence against the appellant, besides"
"the  eyewitness  account  of  the  incident.  Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  just"
