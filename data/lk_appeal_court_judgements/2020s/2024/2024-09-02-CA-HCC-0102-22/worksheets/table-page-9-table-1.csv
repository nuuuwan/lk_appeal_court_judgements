"defence evidence, especially the defence of alibi taken by the appellant."
"Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal"
"The 1st Ground of Appeal:-"
"It was the primary submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that there"
"was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to determine that PW-01 and 02,"
"the  two  eyewitnesses  to  the  incident,  positively  identified  the  appellant  as  the"
"person who caused cut injuries to the deceased."
"The  learned  Counsel  submitted  that  since  it  has  been  established  by  way  of"
"evidence that the appellant was well-known to both the witnesses, there was no"
"purpose in holding an identification parade to identify him, and the statements"
"made by the witnesses to police clearly shows that the two witnesses have failed"
"to identify the perpetrator of the crime although they were eyewitnesses to the"
"incident. It was pointed out that they have also failed to disclose that they knew"
"the appellant, which may have resulted in the holding of an identification parade."
"The learned Counsel also submitted that there was not enough circumstantial"
"evidence to connect the appellant to the crime, and therefore, the  prosecution"
"has failed to prove the charge against the appellant, and the learned High Court"
"Judge was misdirected in his judgment as to the question of identity."
"In this regard, I find that the learned High Court Judge has gone on the basis"
"that there was sufficient light for the PW-01 and 02 to identify the person who"
"came  inside  their  house  and  caused  cut  injuries  to  the  deceased,  and  has"
"determined  that based on that positive identification, they have identified the"
"appellant  at  the  identification  parade  subsequently.  The  learned  High  Court"
"Judge has chosen to brush aside the witnessâ€™s failure to inform the police that"
"they knew the appellant well  before the incident as not an important factor."
