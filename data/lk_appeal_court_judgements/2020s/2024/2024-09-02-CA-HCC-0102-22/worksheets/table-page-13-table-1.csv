"therefore  think  the  conviction  of  the  second  accused  is  justified  and  we"
"dismiss his application.‚Äù"
"I am not in a position to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for"
"the appellant that the learned High Court Judge has not properly considered the"
"alibi."
"Although notice of alibi has been given as required by the section 126A of the"
"Code of Criminal Procedure Act, no such position appears to have been taken"
"when the relevant witnesses were giving evidence before the trial Court."
"When the  appellant  was called upon for his defence, he has stated something"
"that resembles an alibi to the effect that he could not have been at the place of"
"the crime at the given time. However, what he has stated in his dock statement"
"is not something that there was no possibility under any circumstances for him"
"to be at the place of the crime around the midnight of 02-12-2012."
"As pointed out correctly by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), his dock"
"statement in fact, cuts across the alleged alibi by him. What he has stated in his"
"dock statement, was that he left his workplace after 10.00 p.m. and left Colombo"
"around midnight and reached home around 6.30 in the morning of the following"
"day, which cannot under any circumstances be accepted as an alibi."
"However, since notice has been given of an alibi, the prosecution has taken steps"
"to lead evidence to show that such an alibi cannot be possible. There is no denial"
"that  the  mobile  phone  mentioned  in  the  call  records  provided  by  the  service"
"provider marked P-14  belongs to the appellant. In fact, the wife of the appellant"
"in giving her evidence before the Court has admitted that it was she who gave"
"the phone to the appellant and the phone was taken charge by the police when"
"he  was  arrested,.  The  phone  records  clearly  establish  the  possibility  for  the"
"appellant being at the place of crime at or about the time the witnesses say they"
"saw a tall person wearing dark clothes escaping their home after attacking the"
"deceased."
