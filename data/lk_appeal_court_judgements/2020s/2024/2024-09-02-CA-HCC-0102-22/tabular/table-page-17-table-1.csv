"Among  the  recovered  items,  a  pair  of  rubber  gloves  and  some  black  coloured"
"clothes have also been recovered which matches the description of the clothes"
"worn by the attacker when the eyewitnesses saw him."
"The mobile phone call records led in evidence also establish a high possibility of"
"the appellant being in the area where the crime occurred."
"The knife recovered as a result of the statement made by the appellant has been"
"sent for a DNA Report and the DNA Report marked P-18 clearly establishes the"
"fact that the blood found on the knife had matched the blood of the  deceased"
"through DNA analysis, which goes on to show that the knife recovered as a result"
"of the statement made by the appellant had been the knife used in committing"
"the crime."
"The JMO in his evidence has opined that the cut and stab injuries he observed"
"on the body of the deceased could be committed by using the knife marked P-8,"
"which was the knife sent for DNA analysis."
"Although a motive to commit a crime is not a matter that should be established"
"in a criminal case, I find that this is a matter where a motive can also be clearly"
"identified.  As  I  have  considered  before,  even  the  wife  of  the  appellant  has"
"admitted that the deceased had a relationship with her and they met 3 days prior"
"to this incident, where she was assaulted by her own brother accusing her of a"
"clandestine affair. The wife of the deceased has admitted this fact as well."
"It  is  highly  probable  that  the  appellant  may  have  come  to  know  about  the"
"incident that occurred 3 days before, which may provide a possible motive for"
"the offence."
"It is my considered view that when taking all these circumstantial evidence as a"
"whole, the only conclusion that can be reached is that it was the appellant who"
"had committed the crime and no one else. I am of the view that the proved items"
"of circumstantial evidence are consistent with his guilt  and inconsistent with"
"his innocence."
